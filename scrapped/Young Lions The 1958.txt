 

                        (woman) Whoo! (woman laughs) That's marvellous. Now, tomorrow, you give me lessons and I give you your money back. Oh, I feel so good. (violins play) Listen. Listen to what they're playing. Ja. ''Rslein''. # Dee da-dum # Lief er schnell, es nah zu sehn # Sah's mit vielen... Ooh! Go on. I'm sorry. Go on. Please. # Rslein, Rslein rot # Rslein auf der Heiden As a rule, Americans speak German with a very bad accent, but your accent is... is really horrible. Oh, Christian. - This has been so wonderful. - Yes. I wanna thank you. You've been more than generous with your time. Well, that's only because I've had the very worst intentions. Thank you. Oh! Oh, I hate to leave. I hate to say goodbye now. Why? Why don't you say goodbye in the morning? No. No, I can't. I've got to leave too early. Now, look. lt is New Year's Eve. You go back to America, I never see you again, and... - Please, spend the evening with me. - No. Too bad. - Do I have a rival? - Michael. - Who? - Michael. But I think Michael would not mind if I just... stole one tiny little Bavarian evening. Are you kidding? I don't think it would even occur to Michael that anybody would ask me. All right. All right, Christian, I'd love to. Wonderful. (band plays ''The Blue Danube Waltz'') - You look lovely. - Thank you. You look... really... I want to present my sister Freda. - Charmed. - I'm so happy that you came tonight, because I composed a little piece of music for you. And, uh, it's... well... - Would you like to hear it? - I'd love to. - Really? - Yes. (trumpeting) - Do you like it? lsn't it nice? - lt's wonderful. (cuckooing) Prosit Neujahr! (shouting) - Happy New Year, Margaret. - Prost Neujahr, Christian. lch bringe einen Toast. Bitte. Gott, beschtze unsern Fhrer, Adolf Hitler. - Heil! - Heil! (ripple of applause) Das Horst-Wessel-Lied. (band strikes up) # Die Fahne hoch! Die Reihen dicht geschlossen! # SA marschiert mit ruhig festem Schritt # Kameraden, die Rotfront und Reaktion erschossen # Marschiern im Geist in unsern Reihen mit... Are you all right? What's the matter? Oh... you know, I was just in Berlin and I... I saw some Nazi demonstrations. But... I didn't realise it had gone this far. Not... not here, in this... little town. lt's a little frightening. Well, do you think that being a Nazi is such a terrible thing? Christian... Christian, are you a Nazi? No, I am not a Nazi. I'm not... I'm not political at all. But I think that they stand for something hopeful in Germany. Christian, you don't really believe that? Yes, I believe this. But why? Why? What can you possibly find to justify Hitler? I think that... that Hitler will bring us a better life. - ls the life you have now so terrible? - No. My life is not so terrible, but I don't wish to spend the rest of it teaching fat little children how to ski, and being charming and picturesque. I can understand your wanting more... I think that perhaps you cannot understand what it means to live on tips from foreigners in your own country, huh? You know what I really am? I'm not a ski instructor, even. I do this for two or three months in the year, and when the season is over, I... I go to work in a little shop as an assistant to my father, - and I am a shoemaker. - And you don't want to be a shoemaker? No, I don't. I want to be something else. - Well, then, you don't have to remain one. - Oh, this is not the United States. lt's so hard to explain to you, but, you see, it's very difficult for people to rise above their class in Europe. I'll tell you something. At one time, I wanted very much to be a doctor. And I worked... I worked very hard for this. And when there was no longer any money I was forced to give it up, because we have no free university here. And I think this is... this is where Hitler can help us. I think that... that... He has promised to change all this. Christian, Hitler promises to conquer the whole world. Oh,ja. But this is a direct result of a handful of completely insane fanatics... - Ooh! Christian! - Yeah, it is, and this will pass. lt will not pass. lt's going to get worse and worse and worse. And I think it's going to end in war. I think that... we should not discuss this... because I don't know all the answers. I know you don't know all the answers. And with political discussions, we go round and round, and nothing is ever settled. Come on, let's go back in and have a nice time. Come on. (people singing ''Deutschland ber alles'') No. Good night, Christian. I'll say goodbye in the morning. (radio announcer) This is the BBC, London. Today, June 24th 1940, at 7.15pm, France surrendered to Germany. The events of the past 45 days, beginning with the German invasion of the Low Countries on May 10th, have thus come to a tragic climax. England, now fiighting virtually alone, faces the German military power whose aim to conquer or destroy the entire civilised world can no longer be questioned. ln the words of Mr Winston Churchill: ''What General Weygand has called 'the Battle of France'is over.'' '''The Battle of Britain'is about to begin.'' Leutnant, I do wish you'd order your driver to slow down. I'm reluctantly willing to die for the fatherland, but not in a traffic accident. We're late, Brandt. Go a little faster, Basserman. But we almost hit a cow back there! The only living thing we have seen all afternoon. Where is everybody? Making love, drinking absinthe. You know the French. Don't you read our papers? Where are they? When I was a little boy, I promised my father I'd kill a Frenchman for him. They shot off his leg in Verdun,ja, in 1916. So I promised him, on Christmas Eve it was, I promised I'd shoot a Frenchman for him. - Leutnant, have you ever been to Paris? - No, I have not been there. Oh, what a city! What a wonderful city that is. I'll show you a good time there. Ha! You won't keep those people indoors for ever. Not those Parisians. Ah, what wonderful girls! When I was a correspondent there, we practically lived in the streets. Simone and I, we will show you Paris the way it always was. The way it always will be. (gunfiire) (tyres screech) (gunfiire) Go up to the road and keep firing on them in case they try to come to the front,ja? Jawohl. Go! Mets-toi derrire cet arbre. Komm an. (gunfiire) Maeschen, stay behind this tree here. I go over behind the tree over there. Jawohl. (gunshot) I got him. I got him. Maeschen, stay down! (gunshot) Ne tirez pas. Je me rends. Streicher! Hold your fire. Streicher. (gunfiire) Brandt, Streicher, come on. (gunfiire continues) Brandt. Tell him to go back and tell the others to surrender because we now have them in the crossfire. Go. Allez. coutez-moi. Maeschen... is dead? - What-what? - Maeschen is dead? Ja. I'm sure his father is very happy now. Ja? Allez. Allez. Vite. Arrtez les gars! Arrtez! Arrtez! Nous sommes fiichus! - Captain Hardenburg? - Ah, Diestl. Nice to see you. - I understand you had difficulty on the road. - Yes, sir. - At ease. - Thank you, sir. They were young conscripts, sir, making a token gesture. There was a roadblock. No need to apologise. I want to commend you for the way you seem to have handled this. Thank you, sir. We had one casualty, sir. Private Maeschen was killed. Oh, yes, Private Maeschen. Did he perform his duty? Yes, sir, he killed one of the enemy, and then became, uh... excited and failed to take cover. Too bad. I'm sure he fought bravely. lt's wonderful, isn't it? Yes, sir. So, with your permission, I would like to write a letter to his family. Never mind, Diestl, I will do it. Leutnant! Since you are with us, I wonder if you would mind taking a photograph of me for my wife. - We had always planned to come here. - lt would be a pleasure, Captain. - Come on, Diestl. - I'm sure your wife is not interested... Oh, yes, yes, yes! I have written about you and many of the men. She's most interested. Just a moment. We will stand on the steps. Come on, Diestl. With the church in the background. A great day. A day of historic importance. ln years to come, we will look back on this and say ''We were there at the dawn of the new era.'' Ah,ja. Now, Captain, this is the one,ja? Wunderbar! All right, settle down! Settle down! This is New York City property! Stop spittin' and throwin' butts on the floor, and stop shovin'! The army's got plenty of room for everybody. - What's wrong? - lt's cold. Now cough. Turn your head and cough. All right, breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Out. All right, bend over. - Bend over and touch your toes. - Oh. OK. For a man your age and your profession, you're in excellent health. - How do you manage it? - Clean liquor. Give this to the board. Next man. You didn't register in California? Yes, I did, but I came east before I got my classification. - You came to New York to get a defence job? - To get any job. Michael Whiteacre. Oh, uh, sit down over here, Mr Whiteacre. You must be very busy, Mr Whiteacre. I'm told we had a special call from Selective Service headquarters, asking us not to waste any of your valuable time. - I'm rehearsing a show against a deadline. - Well, we'll try to rush you through quickly. - How long will this show run, do you think? - I don't know. No one ever does. Well, this is March. lf it runs very long, your understudy will get a break. - You're booked for Uncle Sam from June 15. - Well, I don't think that's quite fair... - You can file an appeal if you like. - Oh, I'll appeal. - ls there anything else you'd like to discuss? - No, I'll just appeal. Just see the secretary outside. (man) Ackerman. Oh, sit down over here, Mr Ackerman. Mr Ackerman, you don't seem to have any dependent relatives, or any occupation essential to national defence. Can you think of any reason why you should not be classified 1A? No, sir, I can't. I see you work for Macy's. You'll stay for the Easter rush, and you'll report June 15th. I think that'll be all. Thank you very much. Ralph Spencer. Anybody got a cigarette? - Want a cigarette? - Oh, thanks. Here. How do you spell ''extenuating''? - Hm? - ''Extenuating''. Uh... I don't know. E-x-t-e... No, e-x-t... llliteracy. That'll do it. - I heard you sing a lot of times. - Oh, you have? At the club? - On the radio. - Oh. - Are you singing at a club? - No, we're rehearsing a show. - On Broadway? - Mm-hm. - What's the name of it? - Soft Shoes. Soft Shoes. I gotta... I gotta remember that. Let's have a drink. Don't frustrate me. Anybody that can't spell ''extenuating'' is a friend of mine. Come on. Sometimes I think I give off a scent - - you know, rouses the female. - Hm? - Those girls. - Where? Oh! Wait a minute. You mean that you didn't...? Your antenna's turned off. - No, I frankly didn't notice. - Well, you're sick. Have you ever had a girl? - Have I ever had a girl? - That's what I thought. Listen, tonight I'm givin' a party - you know, girls, females, broads. And you will attend. You will capture one and carry her off to your cave. - You will attend? - Sure, yeah. Yeah. Good. Let us not discuss this sort of topic any longer. Let us discuss alcohol. # I like New York in June # How about you? # I like a Gershwin tune # How about you? # I like a fireside when a storm is due # I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips # How about you? # I'm mad about good books # Can't get my fill # And James Durante's looks # Give me a thrill May I refresh your drink? Thank you, no. I'm fine. Have you met everyone? That's all right, I was... listening to the music. Michael's told me all about you. He has? Yes. No, I meant... I only met him this morning at the draft board. - You met Michael at the draft board? - Yes. And he was 1A? We were both 1A. - Excuse me... would you? - Yes. # You saw me standin' alone # Without a dream... - I wanna talk to you. - # Without a love... - Good evening. How are you tonight? - Fine, thanks. And you? - Hi, Hope. - Hi, Mike. How are you? - Fine. How are you? - Good. - I want you to meet somebody. - Friend of yours? Yes. Noah, this is Hope Plowman. Noah Ackerman. - Hello. - How do you do? See if you can cheer him up. I don't think he really likes my music. Actually, I haven't been listening. My, what a lovely view. lsn't it? Yes, Margaret? I hear you're being drafted. - I'm not being drafted. - Mr Ackerman says you are. Mr Ackerman doesn't know what rabbits can be pulled out of a hat in Washington. Look, I'm not a hero and I'm not a pigeon. The pigeons can do my fightin' for me. What's the matter with you? You think I hate you for trying to get out of it? I don't. Really, I don't. Anything you do is OK with me, but... you start to feel guilty about it, then we start having fights and you take it out on me. I don't feel guilty! lt's just that I'm against war, and this whole drummed-up super-patriotic atmosphere. You just don't wanna get shot. Nobody wants to get shot. Stop trying to convince yourself. Forget it. - I got a sick show on my hands! - Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Look, Michael... this is me, Margaret. I understand you. You're a heel, but you're not that big a heel. And then, too, they fish for fish in the river. I was told that. - I like your tie. - You do? I just saw it and I bought it. Do you think it's gonna rain? I like to walk in the rain. - Mm. I do, too. - You do? - Mm-hm. - You want to walk? - All right. - Let's walk. OK. - What are you gonna tell him? - Who? - Michael. - Nothing. Oh. Well, maybe so. New York City must be frightening to a girl from the country. Oh, no, it isn't. lt puts on an act of sophistication, but at heart, it's strictly provincial. I don't think it's provincial. Anyway, not after Vermont. - Vermont? - Mm-hm. New York City, I must say, does have some beautiful women. Flashy, some of them, but... You know, I'm told European women are more mature emotionally. - They are? - Oh! As a matter of fact, friends of mine have told me... - Well, anyway... - What time is it? - lt's late. We'd better be getting back. - No, I'd like to go home. Oh. - Well, I'll take you home. - Thank you. - Where do you live? - Brooklyn. - Brooklyn? - Mm-hm. Well! At last. - Now we take the bus. - Now we take the bus? - Now what? - Now we walk. - (Michael) Margaret. - Yeah? - Don't. - Don't what? Don't be angry with me. Why not? You haven't been very charming. You have not been understanding. ln fact, you haven't even been conversational all evening long. I'm sorry, Margaret, really I am. But lately, it seems we can't talk without arguing. And you haven't the faintest idea what's bothering me. Honey, I'd flip without you. - You sure would. - No, that's the truth. You're so right about me. I sure am. Why don't we just sit and be quiet? And then what? Then you kiss me. Then I kiss you. Oh, Michael, I love you so. Are we getting warmer? You'll be happy to know... that we're here. Good night. Uh... I want to say... I'm pleased... very pleased, I mean, to have brought you home. Thank you. I mean, I'm really pleased. - Do that with your other girls, not with me. - Yes. No! No, I don't. - Oh, only with me? - You don't understand what I mean. You think you're so attractive that any girl would fall over herself to let you kiss her. Oh, God. Never in all my days have I met such an opinionated, self-centred young man. - Good night, Mr Ackerman. - No, don't. Uh... Hope? (door closes) (tapping on window) (whispers) Stop that. You'll wake everyone. How do I get back to the city? You're lost? No one will find me again, ever. You're a terrible fool, aren't you? Well, you walk two blocks to your left, and you wait for the bus - the one that comes from your left - and you take it to Eastern Parkway. Now, whe... Are you listening to me? I want to say something to you. I'm not opinionated. I don't think I've a single opinion in the whole world. I... I don't know why I kissed you, I just couldn't help it. I guess... I guess I wanted to impress you. I was afraid that if I was myself, you wouldn't look at me twice. lt's been a very confusing night. I don't think I've ever been through anything so confusing. (softly) You tell me tomorrow. The bus... to Eastern Parkway. Don't get lost on the way home. Uh... the bus to Eastern Parkway. And then... I love you. I love you. Good night. Thanks for taking me home. - Now this is really boring, Brandt. - Oh, don't be so impatient, Christian. Wait till you see her. A more delicious little strudel you have never seen. Really superb, typically French, and very... Well... I could use a little strudel, Brandt, but we have been here... ja... two hours. - To be French is to be late. - Two hours. lt's part of their charm. I hope they get here before I'm too blind drunk to recognise them. Franoise! Of course the men are Germans, but all Germans are not swine! - No? - I promise you, one drink. Definitely just one drink, then we'll go. I don't want to be seen with the enemy. I don't want to be beaten by my neighbours! I would not look good with a shaved head! Franoise, please. Please! All right, I'll go. But not because of your arguments, because I'm curious. I'd like to observe one of these supermen. I'm a city girl and I've never seen a pig up close. Come on. Here they are. Ah! At last you are here. lf you didn't look so pretty, I'd give you a good spank. - Perhaps I'd like it. - We can talk about that later. How nice of you to come, Franoise. May I present Herr Leutnant Diestl? This is Franoise. Enchant de faire votre connaissance. - I'm sorry, but that's all the French I know. - That's all right. Because you are all the German I know, and perhaps all I care to know. And this is my little Simone. lt's a pleasure. I am sorry we are a little late. You see? Didn't I tell you they were worth waiting for? - Would you care to sit? - How really gallant you are. Are you always as dashing as that with the ladies? Yes, always, if they are ladies. I warn you not to be deceived by this Aryan charm. He is the most famous lady-killer in the Austrian Alps. Oh l l! Tell me, Lieutenant, how many French ladies have you killed? Well, I think that I am not clever enough to do that, but perhaps if I serve in France for a while, I could learn how with your very... kind help. But I'm confused. I thought you came here to teach us something. How to be tall and blond and clean and efficient. Perhaps if you were not French and I was not German, but we were just simply Europeans, we could... learn something from each other, don't you think? United Europe. Of course, how stupid of me. You German have charmed us so that I forgot that you were all idealists. Oh, now, look, doesn't somebody know a good dirty joke? Ta gueule, Franoise, tu vas nous gcher cette soire. Vise les fridolins derrire. How many of us do you plan to murder in the name of that golden plan of yours? lf there is no unification, we will all go on murdering each other anyhow. Listen, I know a restaurant in Montmartre which has a beautiful garden. Shall we go? Ja. We can answer historical questions there, and we don't need to get arrested. No, wait. I would like to know... how many French lives you have personally contributed to that Wagnerian dream. - Look, this is no longer funny. Let's go. - Let go of me! - I want an answer from the Boche. - Franoise! How many Frenchmen have you killed? I've killed no one. No one. But if I have to sacrifice a few lives for peace... I will do it. Ja. Even if one of them is my own. Now I have seen a pig up close. Thank you for your wine. T'es compltement folle! - Franoise... - Laisse-moi tranquille! Tu te rends compte de ce que tu as fait? Tu vas aller en prison. Ah, Christian... Good night, Simone. Thank you. I am so sorry. Really I am. Good night, Franoise. Lieutenant. I am sorry. I should not have made such a scene. - No, no... - Please. My husband was killed... in 1940, in Belgium. And all this talk about sacrificing lives in order to have peace just doesn't make any sense to me. The only way to peace is to stop killing each other. I think about this... And I... I wish it would seem so simple to me. Could I have another glass of wine? Yes, of course. This is my house. This is where I live. I think that I will not... try to tell you how lovely... this evening was for me. But I would like so much to see you again. You're still the conqueror. A young, golden god of war. Perhaps... when the gold has worn off a little... Good night. That's one of the hazards you run when you have a daughter. One day she's gonna come to you and say ''I love him. I wanna marry him.'' Uh-huh. That's one of the hazards. But you haven't told me anything about this man at all. Oh, he's... he's gentle and he's clever. He's notjust a man, he's a boy. And poor. And poor. He writes me a letter a day, even when we see each other in New York every night. And he's alone. He's Jewish, Father. Father, this is Noah. - How do you do? - How do you do, sir? Well, seems to me that Mr Ackerman and I might have a little talk. Certainly, sir. Why don't you finish your coffee, Hope? We won't be very long. That's Jack Marshall's. I went to school with his father. My father with his father. Virgil Smith's law office. One of his people did the legal work when they incorporated this town. 1750. Well, looks like it's gonna be a nice day. That's the family plot. Seven generations of Plowmans there. Hope's mother, too. - There's the school. - Mr Plowman, um... I don't have... a family plot. I don't have a family. I earn $35 a week, and I'm 1A in the draft. But I love Hope. And I shall love her for all my life. You're doin' an awful thing - puttin' a man to the test of his principles. I wish to heaven you'd turn around, get on that bus, and never see Hope again. But you won't do that. Will you? Didn't think you would. Anybody from town had asked to marry Hope, I'd say ''Come on out to the house.'' ''We got turkey for dinner.'' I never knew a Jew before. You go along all your life thinkin' a certain way. Someone jolts you and you have to look inside yourself. That's what you've made me do, and I'm not fond of you for it. I was just tellin' Mr Ackerman we've got turkey for dinner. Thank you. (knocking at door) lf you don't open the door, we are obliged to break it in. ls this Headquarters' idea of a friendly little visit for me to photograph? Ja. Well, we can't wait any longer. Kraus, Faber. - Madame Brenner? - Yes, that's me. - Where is Marcel Brenner? - Oh, monsieur, I wish I knew. The boy's 16 years old. Half of the time, we don't know where he is, he don't come home at all. Kraus. Here. Faber. Marcel! Monsieur, laissez-moi passer! Kraus, take the boy downstairs! - He'll be all right! - Mon fiiston! He will not be hurt! He will not be hurt. I promise. I give my word he will not be hurt. He simply must perform his labour duties. I am sorry. (knock at door) Come in! I would like to apply for a transfer, sir. Why? I think I am not... able to do this work. You don't believe you are suited to this work? No, I don't believe in arresting children, sir. I spent four years at Spandau, two years at the war academy. I should be in Russia. But I am here. And I will stay here until I am ordered elsewhere. And so will you. What time does your train leave for Berlin? Ja. Uh, 12.30, sir. Here are your furlough papers. I wish you to do me a favour while you are in Berlin. (man shouts in pain) - What was that? - Oh, I don't know. lt is the Gestapo. (pained cries) Oberleutnant! Leutnant! Close the door! Do you know where you are? Do you know who you are? Answer me! Yes, sir. Then stop being a child! Don't you know that when you became a soldier, you contracted for killing in all its forms? I do not think it possible to remake this world from the basement of a little police station. lt doesn't matter what you believe. Under battle conditions, I could shoot you for what you have just done. And I would. The German army's invincible because it is an army that obeys orders. Any order, no matter how distasteful. - I cannot... - Be quiet! lt has no sentimentalists, no moralists, no individualists. You will have no future in it if you don't understand that. You may have no future at all if you oppose it. I trouble to tell you this because you have a fine record. You will be a creative soldier, once you get all this... thinking knocked out of you. Well... we will forget it for the present. Now... as I was saying, I would like you to do me a favour. I have secured a piece of lace. Very beautiful. Black, for my wife. I'd hoped to give it to her in person, but I'm too important here. And since I can't, I would like you to deliver it to her in Berlin on your furlough. Yes, sir. Give her my most tender regards. You may say that I think of her constantly. The address is on the package. Enjoy your leave. (buzzer) (woman) Coming. (buzzer) Coming! - Mrs Hardenburg, please. - Yes? I am Lieutenant Diestl from your husband's company and this... is a gift from Captain Hardenburg. Well... come in. Oh, yes, of course. You're the serious one. ln the photograph. With the captain. - Oh, yes, in front of the church? - Yes. - Yes. - How do you do? lt's a pleasure. He wrote me you were coming to Berlin. lf there was anything I could do for you... and so forth. Well, that's very kind of the captain. - Please, sit down. - Thank you. Make yourself comfortable. What would you like to drink? Perhaps I am intruding. You were just going out, no? Only with a general. I'll tell him I kept him waiting for a lieutenant. - Well, in that case, I... - Vodka? - Yes, wonderful. - I have some direct from the Ukraine. And how is the captain? Oh, he's fine. He asked me to give you his... tenderest regards and to tell you that he thinks of you constantly. That's very thoughtful of him. Thank you. And, uh, how is gay Paris? Well, uh... Gay Paris is not so gay. Oh. That's too bad. (buzzer) Where are you staying? Uh... as a matter of fact, I have no accommodation. You'll find it impossible to get a hotel room. Maybe I can do something for you at the Adelon Hotel. Oh, that would be wonderful. Thank you. - Excuse me. - Oh. All right, Franz. Tell him I'll be right down. Are you in a hurry to get someplace? Uh... No. Then stay. I won't be too long. And I want to talk to you about the captain. Will you? Yes. Wonderful. Now, have another drink, Lieutenant. Take some caviar. See how the home front suffers. - Au revoir. - Au revoir. (music plays) - I'm sorry. - No, no. Don't disturb yourself. I hope you were not too bored. No. I was not bored at all. As a matter of fact, I found a... a wonderful companion. Aren't you going to offer me a drink? Oh. Sure. I offer you a drink. Oh, that's too much. Enough. lt couldn't have been a very interesting evening for a soldier on leave. Well, I am, uh... I'm not a soldier, I'm a... policeman. And you don't find this interesting? Well, cheer up. Things may be different. I have a friend on Rommel's staff. Maybe he can be helpful. Wait. You... You can do this? You can arrange... military transfers? With a small effort. (music stops) (music starts) - How are the girls in Paris? - Oh... French. Very patriotic. Welcome to Germany, soldier. - Get me a cigarette, please. - Hm? On the table. - Morning. - Morning. - I hear your show's goin' just great. - lt's a lulu. Brandy and soda. Si, signore. Can you spare it? - What's the matter? - Nothing. Come on, Michael. You can usually fake an affectionate kiss at lunchtime. Something fell through in Washington and I have to take basic training. Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! I was supposed to leave tomorrow, but I can go now. I'm sorry. That's better. Why don't you take the afternoon off? Oh, I can't, Michael. The Office of War lnformation can spare you on my last afternoon. - We'll see each other tonight. - Say you're involved in a troop movement. - Really, Michael, I can't. - On the house. - This is the last of the cognac. - I bet they still have plenty in ltaly. I came here in 1924, sir. I don't know anything about ltaly any more. - That was pretty unnecessary. - Not the way I feel. Margaret, what do you want from me? I want you to act like a man. I want to be proud of you, the way Hope is proud of Noah. You want me to get shot. I've read the books. I know that in ten years we'll be bosom friends with the Germans and Japanese. I'll be pretty annoyed I was killed. Look, Michael, I don't want you to get shot. I don't... I don't even mind you wanting to get out of the army. I just want you to stop pretending that you think it's all right. - That all? - No. I want us to go someplace and get married. Now? - Mm-hm. - Look, honey, I love you. But today? Now, you've been seeing too many war pictures. - You mean no? - I could be in for years. Last chance, Michael. Honey, that'd be foolish. I almost forgot. The Office is sending me overseas. I was gonna tell you that tonight. - Oh! Hello, Mrs Ackerman, Mr Ackerman. - Hello. - Rather early this morning. - Yes, we are. - Oh, today's the day, hey? - Yes, it is. Here. Give you courage. Calm the nerves. Go ahead and drink it. lt's full of cream. Homogenised. - Good, isn't it? - Yes, it is. I drink two quarts a day myself. Keeps me young. Well, I've got to be on my way. - Good luck. - Thank you. Oh, you taste good. I love you. - Are you ready? - Jawohl. Kraus! Kraus! Ja. They are all ready, sir. All right, Leutnant. Now! - May I suggest we wait, sir? - Wait? Why? Over your shoulder, sir. The sun will be up in a few moments,ja? And when the sun is up and in their eyes, their guns will be completely useless. A wonderful idea. We will wait. Mortar. Machine guns. Fire, quick! Left, ten! Back, ten! Kraus! Left! All right! Cease fire! Kraus! I gave no order to stop firing. What are you doing, Oberleutnant? The machine guns will continue to rake the area for 60 seconds! Fire! Shoot all wounded. Leave no one alive here. We cannot take prisoners. Our movements must not be reported. These wounded can give information, and their planes will be on us before we got back. Then all our reconnaissance... useless. Proceed. Shoot him. Shoot him. That's an order. OK, fellas! Attention! At ease. Prepare for inspection. - Eighth general order? - To give the alarm in case of fire or disorder. Wipe that smile off your face, Whiteacre. You're not a Broadway big shot now, you're a soldier in the army of the United States. Rip this man's bed. This isn't the Astor Hotel, Whiteacre. The maid doesn't come in here. Two extra days' fatigue duty. Let's see the inside of that footlocker, soldier. This isn't the New York Public Library, soldier. I know this book. lt's a filthy, dirty book. The army doesn't care what you read, but I do. Get rid of it. Eyes front. All right, soldier. This window hasn't been cleaned at all. Whole barracks is unmilitary. Sergeant, these quarters aren't ready for inspection. Get them ready. You will learn if there's one sloppy soldier, it's up to all of you to teach him to be clean. This platoon is restricted to the post for the weekend. - Don't you think punishing the platoon... - No, Lieutenant, I do not. Yes, sir. Rest. All right, Ackerman. You've gone and done it. Now I'm gonna have to take you under my personal wing. - This ain't no crummy tenement. - Wait a minute... Keep your mouth shut. When I want you to talk, I'll ask you a direct question. You'll answer yes or no. That's an order. Now... lesson number one begins. Ackerman, get yourself a bucket. Do you know what? You're gonna wash every window in this barracks. You're gonna wash 'em until they're clean. White-glove clean. That's an order. Now move. Deal the cards. Here we go. Not even a pair on the table. (soldier) Here comes mama's helper. - Hi. - Hi. (Michael) Did you have a ball? Hey, uh, Cowley, you know everything. Who's our ambassador to New York? We don't have one. We don't recognise it. Just relax. They'll get bored. - lsn't New York part of the United States yet? - Nope. - What language do they speak there? - Language? They talk with their hands. - Well, how come Ackerman speaks English? - He's a spy. Hey, you guys ain't bein' fair to Ackerman. I feel sorry for him. - Oh, sure! - Really, I do. Look at the dough he could be makin', sellin' black-market tyres if he weren't in the service. (Michael) Forget it. Hey, uh, Ackerman, how come you're in the service anyway? He had no influence with the draft board. They were all lrish. - What are you bettin'? - What have we got? What'd you hear from Hope? Hope? She's fine, the last I... - What's the matter? - Oh, now I've done it. I've done it. Her birthday. I got $20 stashed, and I can't even get to a store. Maybe you can get something at the PX. Come on, I'll go with you. That's a good idea. My bank. Whose play is it? Noah. I'll lend you the 20. Let's go. You got a pen? Noah, forget it. lf I were you... You're not. Hey, aren't you gonna eat? Read this. Would you act as my second? - What second? - I want everything to be absolutely correct, and I don't trust myself to arrange it. I might lose my temper. Are you outta your head? These are the four biggest guys in the company. So? - What do you weigh? - Never mind what I weigh! Look, they're only needlin' you because you had 'em confined to the post. Will you arrange the schedule? - OK. You don't want to help, don't help. - What schedule? You want me to fight all four guys in one night? You're crazy. I don't wanna have anything to do with this. Now, take it. Take it! - OK, Donnelly, so you're a big man. - Nice punch. - Come on, I'll buy you a beer. - What do you know? The little punk gave me a bloody nose! Well, you asked for it. - Teach him a little bit about boxin'. - Come on, Burnecker, finish him! - Oh! Oh, look. - Get it over with. - Come on, Burnecker. - Lay it into him, Burny. Come on. - OK, Burnecker, knock him on his back. - Don't kill him. Not yet, anyway. Fix it so he won't wanna fight any more. Come on. Come on, hold him up, he's going down. Look out now. - That'll teach you to keep the windows clean. - Give him that one-two, Burnecker. Oh, look... look... Look, kid, look. Fall down, kid, fall down. Come on, finish him. - Yes, Whiteacre? - I'm sure you're not aware of it, Captain, but Private Ackerman has been badly beaten fighting the biggest men in the company. Yes? He's been seriously hurt, and I'm sure now that you know, you'll wanna stop it. You're quite right, Whiteacre. lf I knew, I would stop it. I'd be obliged to stop it. - But then, I don't know. - You know now, sir. What's the matter with you? Ackerman isn't one of those rich Broadway producers you have to suck around. He's just a dogface. Get some sense. I think you'll have to stop it, sir. You know, the colonel had a phone call about you out of channels from Washington. Very much out of channels. To transfer you to Special Service in London. lt's up to me to approve it or disapprove it. I still think you'll have to stop it, sir. I know the colonel would. All right, Whiteacre. I'll spell it out for you. You go to the colonel, and you won't get your transfer. And you'll have to be five times more soldier than any man in this outfitjust to stay alive. Now get out. Rickett. Get rid of him. Today. - Send his papers through. - Yes, sir. Well, I hope you're satisfied. This makes three beatings in a row. Almost had him, though. - How'd he look? - Who? Cowley? - Yeah. - Better than you do. What are you tryin' to prove? - Nothin'. - Well, why are you tryin' to kill yourself? I like to fight. I'm tired of watchin' you get your brains beat out. Look, if you fight Brailsford, you're on your own. - Sorry. - That's OK. That's all right. - Michael, I can lick Brailsford. - Well, I don't care. lt's important to me. lt's the last fight. - This whole thing has got you crazy. - Maybe. - Oh, excuse me, men. - Yes, Lieutenant? - I'd like to speak with Ackerman. - Certainly, sir. You'll be around? Mm-hm. Cigarette? Thanks. Oh. Sorry. Ackerman, I've been watching the sick book. You're the most... accident-prone soldier in the entire United States infantry. I'm careless, sir. Saturday nights in town, you're careless. Every Saturday night. On weekdays, you're on the roughest obstacle course in the post. Without stubbing your toe. Now, why don't you level with me? I know you're fighting. I think I know why. This is something for the colonel to handle. Just gimme the word. Besides, you're getting licked. You're no good to us punch-drunk. I appreciate it, Lieutenant. Thank you. But this is my business. - Whiteacre? - Yeah. I been looking all over for you. Your orders just came through. You got 40 minutes to make the train to Washington. Thanks. He's all yours, medic. Don't fall! Don't fall! Don't fall! Don't fall! Don't fall! Come on. Leave it alone. You'll get dirt in it. Ready! Hut! Ready! Hut! Ready! Hut! - Attention, roll call. Abbott. - Here. - Acaro. - Here. Ackerman. Ackerman! Any of you men seen Ackerman? Abbott, did Ackerman sleep in his bunk last night? I don't know, sir. I didn't notice. Donnelly, did he? Eyes front, you. Well, Donnelly? I don't know, sir. He's at the opposite end of the barracks. I warn you, men, I want a straight answer from the next soldier. Cowley! No, sir. He didn't. Nobody deserts this company! When they find him, I don't want him in the stockade, I want him right back here. - He's mine. - Yes, sir. Gentlemen. Your attention, please. The briefing will begin. Gentlemen, I will come directly and frankly to the point. You have heard rumours that our position is deteriorating. lt is. An American fleet of tremendous strength is believed to be approaching Tunisia to attack us from the rear. The British are about to launch a massive frontal offensive. The Resistance in Stalingrad has bled our fuel and ammunition in unexpected quantities. We must therefore prepare for a breakthrough. (aeroplanes approaching) For the present, this information is for you only. (soldier) Air attack! Dismissed. (bagpipes) - Damn you, keep awake! - I am awake. Well, stay that way! Talk to me! See that you don't fall asleep. What do you want me to say? Anything, anything. Just talk! All right. How far... how far do we have to go now? About... 400 kilometres more. Seven hours. I think I must sleep. lf you sleep, you'll wake up in a British prison camp. Come on! Talk! I wish I was in the mountains, where it is so cool and peaceful in the snow. So wonderful to feel the wind in your face. Clean and nice. And I like the smell of smoke in the winter, coming from the wood... in the fireplaces. Talk about something else! Talk about women! Women! Women! I have a French girl - Franoise - and I think I can love her. - Was she beautiful? - Yes, she was beautiful. And I wish I was with her, and not on this motorcycle, because I am... I am sick of Africa. And I am sick of the great German army. - And I am sick of doing my duty! - I should have shot you. What? I said I should have shot you! I ought to shoot you now! You'd better learn to drive this first. You will destroy us! Men like you poison an army. You let discipline slip a little one day, a little more the next day, and soon you are nothing! You are not able to fight at all! I should have shot you! - Ja, why didn't you shoot me, then? - Because I was an idiot! Yes! You recognise that you are... you are still infected with decent human feelings. - Oh, shut up! - And you hate that in yourself, don't you?! - Shut up! Shut up! - You hate that... Hello. I wanna kiss you. Why didn't you tell me? I couldn't. Besides, there's a law against harbouring deserters. You're not a deserter. The army lawyer told me you gave yourself up. Are you all right? Yes. Noah... you know what they're asking me to do? Sure. Sure. The lawyer said if you go back to your old company, you won't go to prison. Mm-hm. I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. You do what you have to. Stand up. Stand up. Honey! How long is it? - What? - How long is it? - Five months. - Five months! Why didn't you tell me? I could've written you, I guess. I... I had to work this out myself. The doctor said I should stay in bed for a while. I did. I guess that's why I didn't write you. I wanted to make sure it'd be all right. I don't want this to influence you one way or the other. Are you glad? lt's wonderful. Absolutely... wonderful! Time's up. Don't worry about me. I'm going back home. Don't worry at all. I'm not worried. Can you imagine?! Listen. Go to the lawyer and tell him I'll go... anyplace they wanna send me. - All right, soldier. - OK? I love you. Not only are you a disgrace, but your actions have caused a black mark to be made against this company and against me personally. I'm gonna see that you erase that black mark. I'm gonna make a soldier out of you if I have to break you in half to do it. Yes, sir. You'll get no passes. You'll be on KP every day for the next week. Also, you'll have the same cot and the same men around you. You'll have to make sure any punishments handed out to them aren't caused by you. Yes, sir. Now get out of here. I don't want to see you in this room again. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - (PA) Captain. - Yes? This is Major Price. The colonel requests that you report to his offiice. I'll be right there, Major. You wished to see me, sir? There are many kinds of officers that we get in a war. Men like Green, Emerson... and a few officers like you. Fortunately, a very few like you. Sometimes we find you out. Occasionally, we don't. ln your case, we've been lucky. I've just completed an investigation of the reasons for Private Ackerman's behaviour. - Sir, I can explain. You see... - I hope you can. I'll read you the charges that'll be brought against you at your court martial. ''That said officer wilfully persecuted Private Noah Ackerman by ordering mass punishment of his entire company as a means of disciplining him.'' ''By wilfully and knowingly permitting savage beatings to be inflicted upon him by members of his company.'' ''By attempting to blackmail Private Michael Whiteacre, who interceded on his behalf.'' Do you want me to go on? I thought not. I've preferred these charges against you, and... I officially serve you with them now. Hey! Hey, you guys, I think I've just seen a ghost. I don't see anything. - I think it's Ackerman. - You're crazy. He's in New York, livin' it up. - lt's somebody who looks like Ackerman. - Nobody looks like Ackerman. (laughter) All right, you guys, make room for one more. I've just found a pigeon with 20 bucks. Come on, whose bet? Five? You're outta your mind! - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, Captain. May I help you? Yes. Do you have a Captain Hardenburg in this section? - Yes, he's here. - Would it be possible to see him? - Are you a friend of his? - Mm, yes. - Very good. He's right in there. Go right in. - Thank you. - Captain Hardenburg? - ls that you, Diestl? Yes, sir. I was just released from my hospital this afternoon, and I came to say goodbye. That's very nice of you. - Well, are you feeling any better, sir? - Ja. - Better each day. - Good. But they tell me I will be here for six months. Six months? Well, I'm sorry that it will be so long for you. Why sorry? lt gives me the opportunity to think of the future. I plan to go into politics. Oh, yes. My face will be a reminder of what I have given for the fatherland. lt will stand me in good stead... with our audiences at public meetings. Well... You know, sir, that... they do remarkable things nowadays with... Yes, remarkable. Remarkable. Glass eyes, plastic noses. Reconstructed cheekbones. I have written to Gretchen in this kind of detail, to prepare her for it, and she has assured me she's proud of me, and it will make no difference. Gretchen... is the name of my wife. Yes, I know. How do you know? Ah, yes, you delivered a package for me. She is quite handsome. lsn't she? Yes, sir, she's quite handsome. She will be very useful to my career. What I would like you to do for me is... visit her again, to reassure her. I know it's a great deal to ask, to speak for a man to his wife under these circumstances, but I want her to hear from a third party that I am... salvageable. Yes, I-I-I will be glad to do that. Thank you. Thank you, Diestl. Now... come closer. Yes, sir. Are we alone? - Yes, except for... - Yes, yes. lt's all right. I have one more favour to ask of you. I want you to bring me a bayonet. - A bayonet? - Yes, yes. A bayonet. - Well, I think... - What is the matter with you?! Not for me. For him. He has no hands left. Or anything left. He wants to die. I have promised him. (whispers) He whispers to me when we are alone. And he can hear. He's a watchmaker... in Nuremberg. Specialist for stopwatches. He has three children. And he wants to die. Where is my hand? Approximately over his heart. Good. That's where I will place the bayonet. We have practised it every night for a week. Come back tonight with the bayonet. Diestl, will you bring me the bayonet? Yes, sir. Goodbye, Diestl. Goodbye, sir. (woman) Yes? lt's, uh, Christian Diestl. Who? Christian Diestl. Hello. Oh. Lieutenant. - Yes. - Come in. How are you? I'm all right. And you? Forgive me. I must look awful, but I haven't slept for so many weeks. We've had so many air raids. Come in. Excuse me. They come over two, three times a night. You can't imagine what it's like. The soldiers at the front would strike under such conditions. I mean it. There's no heat, no light. Oh yes. I remember. Sit down. Thank you. Did you bring any food from Russia? - Africa. - Of course. My husband's company. Ja. All I have left is some kmmel. No, no. Thanks. Do you hear from your husband? He killed himself. - He what? - He killed himself. With a bayonet. I have the letter somewhere. He asked me to come here and speak to you for him. Perhaps it's just as well. He wanted to come back here. Naturally, I didn't encourage him. I spent a whole night composing the most tactful letter. I told him, of course, he would be better off in some permanent veterans' hospital. What are you doing now? For heaven's sake, Christian, be a little realistic. You people are getting stranger and stranger. Stay a little while. Maybe I can find some vodka. I'll make myself pretty for you. Christian? Christian! - Brandt. - Christian, how wonderful to see you again! lt's good to see you, Brandt. - Oh no! - I can't believe it! lt was bad, huh? No. They moved us around a little bit, but, you know, it's... Listen, now - what's the matter with you, being so near the front, Brandt? What... huh? You know me. lt was a mistake in the orders. What are you doing here? Are you stationed here? No, I am waiting for transportation. I'm trying to get to Paris. Come on, I'll buy you a drink. - I see you are a captain from taking pictures. - lt's an outrage. I should be a major. You've no idea how glad I am to see you. I'll take that, and bring us some glasses, please. I've been here for two days waiting for somebody to go to Paris. - Listen, what are you doing in Paris, Brandt? - My headquarters are there. This is your headquarters - with blonde hair, who likes goose liver? - Yeah, yeah. That's the one. - ln other words, you have no orders? - Only a desire. - Ja, ja. Look, Christian, I've also managed to acquire a little French car all my own. - This follows naturally. - Yes, but look. I wouldn't last an hour before somebody requisitioned it, but you have combat orders. - With you, there'd be no questions asked. - You have this car here, just... Ja, just near here, in a little stable. - Well, we go now, we take the car. - All right, let's go. Why don't you have dinner with Simone and me tonight, huh? That would be very nice, Brandt, but I think I must report. Oh, report in the morning. You need some rest. - Brandt, do you ever see Franoise? - Why, of course. She's living with Simone now. - She is living with Simone? - She has been for more than a month. Brandt, would you like to have dinner with Franoise and me tonight? Very nice. We'd be delighted. Simone! Simone? Simone! Simone. Darling. lt's been forever. Hello, Franoise. Hello. Come in. (Brandt) I'm an American officer! Oh, my wonderful friends, I want to thank you for this beautiful night. I love you for it. And now, I'd like to make a little toast. Farewell, Captain Brandt of the army of the Third Reich! You're drunk, darling. Say good night. No, no, no, no. Christian understands me. Good night, Captain Brandt. Tomorrow you awaken to your new life: Monsieur Brandt, citizen of the world. lsn't he funny? He has such ideals. Sit down, Simone. Sit down for a minute. Christian, I... I know you don't approve, but listen to me for a minute. Tell me, are we civilised human beings, or are we wild beasts? A human being knows when he has lost, and he tries to save himself. When you are put into the army, you are expected to risk your life, but you are not expected to just throw it away. After all, in any war, Christian, after all the arms and the legs have been... blown off, it doesn't really matter, because nothing really changes. Good night... my dear friend. Franoise... be good to him,ja... because he is the best of the best. - All right, all right. - Ja. Come on. Christian. You... You won't report him? (softly) No. Thank you. You're not the same. When you are... When you are in a hole... filled with your own excrement for days on end, and when you see the faces and the bodies of the men you've killed, you change. And when you're out there like that, when you have to live with death every day... for so long... you have to keep something in front of you, or you would go insane. And so I was... I was always afraid that... I had just invented you. Oh, but I am real. Yes. Christian... please stay. There isn't anything for you to fight for. There never really was. Christian... you're not the golden warrior any more. And soon... you will be just another refugee. Don't throw this away. Please. Don't throw this away. I think... I think I've come too far. (singing) What are you staring at? The faces of the generals. I don't like 'em. lf there is one thing I cannot stand it's enlisted men, with their air of injured moral superiority. They don't look like they could lead you up the walls of a German fortress. Don't you worry, honey. They're not gonna lead you anyplace outside of a London bar. - Let's not start that again. - All right. (explosion outside) Go on, dear. Whoops. Here comes another big man. No, no, no. Sit down, sit down, soldier. How are you, Margaret? I'm all right, Sam. So far. They are a little early tonight. Oh. Private Whiteacre, I'd like you to meet General Rockland. Sam, huh? Nice to know you, sir. Thank you. Come on over to the bar. Bring your friend. ln a little while. Thank you, Sam. How long's this been goin' on? - Wouldn't you like to know! - And a general, too. (explosion) Johnny One-Note. Always criticising officers. Always turning down promotions. Why do you insist on staying a private? (explosion) Guilt, I guess. You know, Dr Freud would say I'm punishing myself because I'm stayin' outta combat. Because I'm letting Noah Ackerman do my fighting for me. - lf you wanna personalise it. - Well, then, get into it. Stop feeling so guilty. lt's getting a little sickening. I'd rather be guilty than dead. Go on, see Sam. These things get any closer, I'll probably chicken out and make a spectacle of myself. Go on, see Sam! Go on! - You would, too! - Let me go. (explosion) You stay here. What are you tryin' to do, get yourself killed? General, will you do somethin' for me? Will you? - I dunno. What is it? - Can you send me back to my old outfit? - Where are they? - They're fighting in Normandy. Well, I suppose so. Why don't you just put in a request through channels? I don't wanna wait that long. All right. - Give me your name and your serial number. - Yes, sir. Thank you, General. Thank you. Well, now you've done it! We're practically in a foxhole right now. - That's what you wanted, isn't it? - Michael, you stupid idiot. That isn't what I wanted. You don't have to get killed to keep me loving you. I won't get killed. Believe me, I'll have the deepest foxhole and the biggest helmet in the whole infantry. No you won't. I'll talk to him. Don't. Margaret, please. Come here. Now let that be a lesson to you. Margaret, I... I have to do this. I know I'll chicken out afterwards, but... by that time it'll be too late. I'm... I'm scared. - Ah, don't be scared. - I am. I wish I hadn't... I'll come back. I have to come back. How else can I marry you? - Mornin'. - Mornin'. Here it is. (Noah) Also, the mail may be slow, and I don't want you to worry. I can't tell you where I am, because the censors wouldn't like it. lf it's not too private, could you read it to us? Yeah. ''The photograph was wonderful.'' ''I'm delighted with my little girl, and I can see that she is a fine child, straight of limb, quick of mind.'' ''I promise to return to both of you with a whole body and a whole heart, no matter what happens.'' ''I shall return to tell her stories at bedtime, to feed her spinach, and to teach her how to drink milk out of a glass.'' ''To take her out in the park, and tell her the names of the animals in the zoo.'' ''To explain to her why she must not hit little boys... and why she must love her mother as much as her father does.'' (Noah) Write me... my darling. Write me. Write to me, please. Write me. Love... ''Noah.'' They're gettin' close. Look, I want no firing - no matter what happens - till they move up. Oh, no. No shootin'. We're only artillery observers, you know. I can hear the old man. ''You boys go on ahead, see what we have to clear out.'' ''lt's easy. lt's like takin' a walk on a peaceful Sunday mornin'.'' What are they doin' out there on a peaceful Sunday mornin'? - (sneezes) - Bless you. Mother. Mother! Mother! (gunfiire) Here they come. Put your guns on 'em and make it count. Now! Don't bunch up down there! Grenade! No sense in putting it off. We're French-fried if we stay here. We'll have a few minutes before they reorganise. Who wants to go first? We'll leave by twos and threes. We'll... dissolve the detail in twos and threes. No need to tell you to be careful. Well, who's goin' first? Look, when you get through the Germans... Well, I wish I could tell you where our lines are. But... don't expose yourself till it's absolutely necessary. - You don't wanna get shot by your own men. - (gunfiire) Somebody better go now. - All right. - Yeah. I'll go too. Ohhh! What's... what's the matter? lt's all right. lt's all right. OK? (gunfiire) - What you doin'? - What do you mean? Get your stuff off. - Not me. I can't swim. - Well I can't swim either. - lt can't be too deep. - There's Krauts all around us. - We'll sit here and wait for 'em. - Those are our guys across there. The minute we hit that water, they'll spray us like sittin' ducks. - Shut up and get outta your gear. - I'm takin' off nothin'. - You can't stay... - I don't know what you're doin', but I'm not doin' it with you. You're nuts. I can't swim! - Shut up! - Get outta here. - I'm ready. - Let's go. I'll go first. lt's gettin' deep. Wait... wait a second. Wait a second. Just dog-paddle. Take it easy. OK? Hold on to me. Just hold on. Hey! Not here. Not here. Hey! Hey! Here. (gunfiire) ls it bad? - No? - No. Don't try to move. - Hey! - (gunfiire) Hey, you guys! Cut it out! Cut it out! Hey! Will you quit shootin'?! We're Company C - Charlie Company. There's only two of us. And he's wounded. Gimme a hand! Gimme a hand, will ya?! - You got dog tags? - Sure I got dog tags! - Your name? - Ackerman. 3974287. OK? All right, keep your shirt on. We're coming. Take it easy, now. Be careful. Easy. Easy. Thanks. This here's Red Dog Four. Yeah, a couple of guys from C Company just come up. Ackerman and, uh... - Burnecker. - Burnecker. Burnecker's wounded. Ackerman ain't got no clothes. Better get some up here. Ask him if, uh, Lieutenant Green showed up. What about Green? Uh-huh. Yeah, I got ya. Yeah, they're all OK. They just barely made it. How was it out there? - They're sendin' up some dry clothes for you. - I found some schnapps. Get you warm. Hm. Huh? Oh, Michael. How'd you get here? I have a friend that's a general. I'm pretty big behind the lines, you know. Put these on. What's the matter? They're still, uh... Hey, uh... Could one of you, uh... pass the word down the line to hold fire for, like, ten, fifteen minutes? What gives? There's a guy over there that we left over there. Vernon, go down the line and tell those trigger-happy Joes if they see a derrire in the canal, it's one of ours. - Who's out there? - Cowley. Oh, Cowley. Good. - Yeah. Except he can't swim. - Even better. Look, you don't owe him anything. Nothing. No, I don't. You've just been out there. There are plenty of other guys. How about you, son? You look fat and sassy. Wait a minute. I just got here. Besides, I'm a coward. (gunfiire) (whispers) Cowley? Cowley? What do you want? - Come on, let's go. - Will you leave me alone?! Cowley, it's not deep. Damn you, it's not deep! The guys are waiting for us. Now come on! No. No, I'm not goin'. - OK. - Wait. All right, Noah? (aeroplane) (gunfiire) - I'd like to speak with your commandant. - Ja, Kapitn. Enter, Kapitn. - Yes? - I was wondering if you had some food, sir. We have no food. We have already been cleaned out by deserters. I am not a deserter. My company has defected, I am without command, and I have not eaten in two days. Forgive me, Captain. Sit down, pour yourself some coffee. lt's a relief to find someone who still has some sense of discipline left. How close are the Americans? Well, I think they are - I don't know - five minutes or five hours. - I'm sorry, that's all that's left. - Thank you. Everything is gone. Colonels and generals... passing by, snatching the food out of my hands. Throwing away their uniforms. Unbelievable. My men are running, too. This organisation is falling apart in front of my eyes. I'm sorry. Are you hurt? No. I can see you had a bad time. Well, so did I. I have my wounds, too, even if you don't see them. Running a concentration camp is not a picnic. With all the gas chambers, target ranges, doctors with their experiments. I had an extermination quota of 1500 people a day. Jews, Poles, Russians, French. Political prisoners. And I had only 260 men to do it. I managed it. Then they sent memorandums, inspectors - running, shouting. ln Auschwitz, they kill 20,000 a day. (phone rings) I know who it is. lt's Berlin again. For the fourth time today. Yes? Yes. Very near. A few miles. I told you. All right, I didn't tell you. I told whoever it was that called. I have ten men left. How can I kill everybody in the camp? Don't you understand? The equipment is not working. Nothing is working. I don't care what they did in Buchenwald! I am here alone, and I have no personnel left! You know what this is, this phone call? They want me to kill every man, woman and child in the camp before the Americans get here. And the man who asked me to do this... this same man will walk the streets, free. And they will come to him, the Americans, the Russians, and he will say ''I never heard of concentration camps.'' He will say there never was a national policy to kill 12 million people - the SS invented it. Nobody in the government ever heard of it. I'll be here, trying to explain to the Americans. You know, the Americans may not understand what they see here. They may not know that a German officer - our kind of officer - does what he's ordered to do. Well... We at least know... what is important. The courage to stay and face the enemy, and the honour to be able to say ''I have done my duty for the fatherland.'' What's the matter? My God... Captain, this is the mayor of the town we came through on our way up here. He says he can send a gang of civilians in to help us. As I was telling the sergeant, we have heard that some of your most important generals and newspapermen are on the way up here. I can provide you with my townspeople, who will help you to clean up this place so... Yes? Excuse me. My name is Joseph Silverson. I am a rabbi. Yes? I do not wish to annoy the officer, but I have a request to make. Yes, what is it? Thousands have died here. More will die tonight, tomorrow. I'm sorry, Rabbi, we're doing all we can. Of course. I know that. There's nothing to be done for them. Nothing material. We understand that. All efforts must be for the living. What I am asking for is a... luxury. Yes? I ask to be permitted to collect all of us - the living and... those without hope - and hold a religious service. A service for the dead, who have come to their end here. There has never been a religious service for us in this place. Captain, I don't like to intrude. I understand why the rabbi has made this request, but this is not the time for it. I'm a European. I understand things perhaps the captain doesn't understand. lf you allow this gentleman to hold the services, I'm obliged to warn you... there will be riots, the other prisoners will not stand for it, and the generals who are coming will not like what they see. The, uh, the other prisoners will not stand for it? And the generals will not like it? That's a fact. I guarantee it. I'm going to guarantee something myself. I'm going to guarantee that you... you hold your services. I will also guarantee that machine guns will be set up on the roofs of the buildings, and anyone who attempts to interfere with those services will be fired upon by those machine guns. And further, I guarantee that if you ever come into this place again, I will break your neck. That is all. Thank you very much... sir. Ackerman, you're not needed around here. Go take a walk outside the camp. Thank you, sir. Whiteacre. How do you feel? Fine. Fine. I never... Did you ever imagine it could be like that? No. My father's brother died in one of those... - Did you see them? - The ovens? - Yeah. - Yeah. Did I ever tell you about my father? No. When that guy started to talk to Green... I could've gone and blown my brains out. - I felt the same way. - And then... - Green said ''I guarantee. I guarantee.'' - I got a lotta hope for Captain Green. You know what? When this war's over, Green is gonna be running the world. There are millions of him. Millions! They're human beings! There are millions of them! They're gonna run the world!
