 

                        Neal? Neal, come on, wake up. Hey, come on, kid, get up. We're almost home. How long was I out? All the way from the airport, about three hours. What, didn't you sleep last night? Looks about the same around here. Yeah, yeah. The, um... snow just all came off last week. It was real nice. You would've... You would've liked it. Yeah. Too bad I had to miss it then. So I guess it's a lot, uh... a lot warmer in Florida, huh? Depends on what you mean by warm. See you still got that mumbling thing. I don't know. You see, Aunt Sara didn't seem to care if I talked or not. Actually, Sara cared a lot. Could've fooled me. Really? Really You know, kid, when someone takes your ass in and doesn't kick it out after two years, that's 'cause they actually give a shit. And she didn't want you gone, if that's what you think, either, okay? It's 'cause the new lady wants to meet me, right? So you did read the letters I sent you then. Yeah. Well, I didn't know one way or the other, you know. Response would have been nice. I had some, but they weren't very nice. What does Paulie think of her? Paulie thinks the world of her. Which is one of the reasons why I decided to move forward with her. And one of the big reasons why she wants to get to know you. How is Paulie? He's fine. He's good. Aw, shit. Dad? I'm sorry. Come on. It's gonna be all right. Come on. Hey. It was Angela's idea. I'm gonna love her. Hey, come on, this is important to her, all right? So just try and remember what a smile is and slap it on your face for a few minutes, please? Ohh! Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, so nice to finally meet you, honey! This is Angela, obviously. Oh, welcome home. I'm Angela. Oh, so nice to see you. You know, you must be very hungry. You want something to eat, something to drink? I mean, I've made plenty of... ...in person. You really are a cutie! - Oh! - Where's Paulie? Yeah, where is your youngest, Hausman? I figured he'd be out here dancing for joy to have Neal back. Oh. Uh, well, you know, Paul's, uh... Taking a nap, actually. Yeah, he's had a little fever recently, and he's just getting over it. You know, we just want to keep him rested for school tomorrow. Hey, Neal, you remember me, right? Mr. Evans. Hey, kept an eye on your dad while you were staying at your aunt's. Made sure he didn't get into any trouble. Are you sure about that? I think he snuck in a new wife when you weren't looking. Yeah, anyway, you remember my boys, Richard and Roger? Hey, guys. They've been talking nonstop about you ever since they heard you were coming back. Hey, we would love to have you over for our own little welcome back. You know, you and your brother can come over for dinner, you can stay the night, we'll hang out. - It'll be great. - Thanks. I'm gonna go tell Paulie. All right, great. Great to see you... Neal. Neal? Hey, Cara. I'm sorry I left without saying good-bye. We just left, like, overnight. It's okay. I'm sorry I never got the chance to say sorry about, you know, what happened. Thanks. Hey, Cara? Gonna marry that nut job? You better keep him away from matches. Shut up! I'm sorry. My brothers are idiots. It's okay. My brother's inside, so I should go. Cool. It's good seeing you, Neal. It's gorgeous. Paulie? Paulie? Paulie! Paulie! Paulie? Paulie, Jesus Christ! You really scared me, buddy. You're not Neal. No, of course, I am. It's really me, Paulie. Prove it. Okay. Well, Dad, probably flipped out when he found out about these, right? It pretended to be you so many times. Paulie, don't talk like that. Hey, what the hell's going on in here? God damn it! Paulie, what the hell you doing up here? How many times do I have to tell you not to go through these boxes? What, 2,000 times? Terry, Honey? Is everything okay? Sorry, excuse me. What'd you think, Neal's back, you get to do whatever the hell you want? Is that it? I'm sorry, Dad. - Dad? - What? Just hold on a second. What do you want? You want Neal gone? You want him going back to Florida? - Is that it? - Dad, come on! What the hell are you thinking, Paul? What's going on? This goddamn party's over, Angela. I want everybody out of my house right now. Everybody gone! Now! Okay! Okay, honey, just listen to me, okay? Move your car. You're blocking some people in. You have to move your car. Just take it easy, honey. Fine. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. How about you, Neal? I'm great, Angela. Listen, um... Why don't you, uh, just take this? Get out of the house and go and be brothers for a little bit, okay? Be back by 6:00 for dinner, all right? Thank you. You're welcome, honey. Be careful. Six o'clock! God. Aah! Wow, Neal, you're here! That's right, dude. I'm here for good. Feels like it's been forever. I know, man. I can't believe how big you got. I thought you were gonna be a midget the rest of your life. So how was Florida with Aunt Sara? Aunt Sara home-schooled me and put me in therapy, so I sat around and listened to how crazy I was for a while. What? I miss something? No, it's just funny how sometimes a crazy person is the only one who gets it right. Gets it right? You're not crazy, Neal. You never were. You can smoke if you need to. I can't smoke in here. No, I just mean around me. I don't mind. Thanks. I think I'm gonna quit. I have enough problems already. I really missed this. You know, this is the coolest place in town. Well, what did you miss more, this place or me? You jerk. I was just about to say you. Hey, guys, how's it going? Hi. Hi. Haven't seen you in forever. Thought my best customer left for another diner. Well, um, there isn't one. This is the best in town. Listen to that. So, you used to get the Reuben? - Uh-huh. - Two, please. Right on it. So you have a girlfriend? No, no. You sure? I mean, there's gotta be like ten girls after you right now. Well, um, I kind of like this one girl. She sits right next to me in... Neal? Whoa! Neal? Neal! Hey, let me ask you something. Have you seen this before? I don't want to talk about that. It's okay. It's just me talking to you, okay? There's nobody else but us. I found that sketchbook a while back, yeah. I went through your boxes a few times just, you know, 'cause it made me think of you, - and... - And you looked inside? Yeah. Is that what you mean by saying that I'm not crazy? You think that you've been seeing something like this? At night, every night. Who knows about this? You do. Only you would ever believe it's happening again. But you didn't tell Dad? Angela? No. Well, they know I haven't been sleeping, but I don't talk about it. They just think it's me missing you or school, and I just agree with them. And you think you saw me sometimes? It's one of the ways it tries to get me. I remembered you talking about visions you'd have at night and Dad saying you've got an overactive imagination. Why was all my stuff boxed up in your room, Paulie? Well, when you got sent away, I got kind of sad, so Dad packed up all your stuff and moved me in. He thought it would help. Oh, shit. Yeah, it didn't. So you've been sleeping in my room this whole time? Well, I go in there every night, but I don't sleep. Neal... you believe me, right? Okay. Ooh. Phew! Paulie, what a mess. See, is there anything else? Nope. Damn it. Oh! Okay. Oh! Oh! This was really close, too. Cara. What is it, Neal? Two Reubens! Best in town, right, big guy? Oh, my God. Hey, Neal. Wow, you've been back for two hours and you're already at Melanie's. Heh. So how was your party? Hey, it was, uh... It was not much. I mean, it was fine. It was... Well, well, well, if it isn't the firebug? You know, I heard that your dad had to send you away to keep you out of jail. Yeah, didn't something happen to your mom? Did you do that, too? You can't believe everything you hear. He got sent away to protect him from me. That's right, I'm his brother, Paulie. I don't remember what happened that night. When I came to the next morning, he was halfway across the country, and I was in a straitjacket. What the hell are you talking about? You're like three. Mm-hmm. That's how I get away with it. Let's get outta here. You seem like you came out of everything okay. Better than ever, baby. Wow. So, Neal, sorry about that. I'll see you around, I guess. Yeah. So... from the foot of the bed or the side, most often? Definitely the side. Any idea what time? Not really. It's when it's dark and late... really late. Any contact? What do you mean? Like talking, messages, or...? I don't think so. What does it do? It reaches. Dinner, boys. Come on. It's very good, dear. I see the salad is very popular. - It is. - Mm-hmm. I cut mean vegetables. Oh. Isn't this wonderful? We're finally all here. So where did you wind up going? Oh! Stop that. Melanie's. I love that place. It's such a great idea. Is that where your appetite went, Neal? - Paulie? Stop that. - Enough. You're not tossing food. No, I didn't eat my sandwich, either. You want me to cook you something? - You sure? - No, no. No, like a souffl, you know. I'd like to see that. So where's Neal gonna sleep? Well, Angela and I talked about that a little bit, and, um, you know, Paulie's in your old room, so we thought maybe you'd be okay trying something a little different. I made a bed for you in Paulie's old room. I hope that's okay. Paulie's room. That's great, considering that all... all my shit is in there. So nice to see many of your happy faces here supporting theater in the schools. Maybe that'll send the school board a message, huh? Well, you might have noticed that our turnout for this year's school play is a little light. You can thank your parents for responding so well to my original piece I wrote, Hero or Cheater?" Undaunted, I'm gonna move on to my next project, which will be a lot of fun. We're gonna do "The Crucible, the Musical," and... Wake up! Aah! Aah! Aah! Look, I get that you need some time to readjust, Neal. Okay, I do, but I got you two staring off into nothing. You're not eating. You sure as shit don't care about Angela's feelings. And you know what I don't want, boys? I don't want today to become every other day. We used to be normal. Do you remember that? We're gonna be again. We're gonna be, but it's up to you boys. Paulie? Angela and I have decided we're gonna keep you out of school for a little while. No. No, no, no, you can't do that! Why? Why? Are you actually asking why? Should we ask all your... your classmates who watched you melt down today why, Paulie? Now, look, the... the priority here is to get you guys both back to earth and back in school in a week, and we are gonna do it! But before I can enroll you, Neal, I need you to do some things for me, son. Oh, yeah? What's that? Like grow the fuck up, for one. Like become a man! You're were only supposed to go down to Sara's for a couple of months, but she wanted you there because she thought it was helping. But if two years down there is not getting you to grow up, then I'm gonna do it! Your ass is getting a job! Is getting a job gonna make me a man? Well, it's sure as shit gonna help! Uh, Neal, honey? I think what your dad is trying to say is that Paulie needs a role model. Are you okay? - Neal! Are you listening? - Yes! Yes? Okay, then what did we just say? That I'm still crazy! No, that is not what we just said! That's all that anybody thinks! I'm not even getting a chance! You don't get chances, kid! You earn them, and you're not doing it! Well, maybe I should have just died with Mom! You two go to bed. Angela's making you act completely... Stop it, Neal. Please just stop talking, all right? Now, you two brought this on yourselves. This door's gonna stay locked. You gotta go to the bathroom, you knock. Otherwise, all I want to hear is silence. Sleep tight! Don't start with me. Maybe we should consider outside help. No. We've done that, and it hasn't done jack shit. We are doing this ourselves. But something is going on here, Terry. Yes, Angela, there is, and we're gonna put a stop to it. You sleep with the light on? At night, yeah. For how long? About a year now. But it helps? Mm-mmm. Hey, let's try something, you and me. Turn the light off. Neal, what are you gonna do? Hey. Hey! If we don't make any noise, it doesn't know we're here. What about when we move? Here, let me try something. So we don't move, we don't make any sound, it's not gonna try anything, right? Paulie, he's right behind you, man! How close did it come to me? Um, not that close. Still had half the room to go. A couple of feet. We're all right with the lights on, I think. Yeah. Wonder what Angela tells Dad. What do you think of her? She's kind of cool. Seriously? Does she even have a job? She's a substitute teacher. Good for her. Substitute teacher, substitute wife, substitute mom. She's got it all figured out. Neal, you should give her a chance. Does Dad ever talk about Mom? Never, except when he'd talk about you. Does he blame me? He blames everybody. ' Hey, Neal? 'Hmm? Want to see how I get to bed? Yeah. So I was thinking about how we'd keep you off the floor tonight, Neal. I was just gonna stay up all night. Not like I haven't done it before. Well, maybe you can sleep on the dresser. I mean, better than no sleep. Worth a shot. Just run, Neal. You're gonna make it mad. I think I made it mad anyway. Well, it's a lot noisier than it's ever been before. It remembers me. It's been a long two years, Neal. I'm glad you haven't changed. What happened to you today? I fell asleep in class, and I woke up screaming. Why didn't you say anything, man? Well, 'cause I kind of like just hanging out without talking about screaming. You ready to stop screaming? Yeah. Paulie? Paulie! Paulie, if you're sleeping, wake up! Wake up, man, there's something happening! Yeah, this stuff. I don't remember this! What the fuck is this, man? Usually happens after I've already fallen asleep. What's happening?! I don't know, Paulie! Hang on! Dad! Dad, what are you doing? Dad, leave him alone! Dad! Dad! What are you doing? Get off him, Dad! Dad, what... Stop! - Dad! Neal! No! Dad! Dad, stop! Dad! Dad! No, no! Aah! Does it hurt? Mm-hmm. Do you want to tell me exactly what happened, honey? No. Paulie, you know, I can put medicine on your bruises in the middle of the night, but the only way I can truly help you is if I can stop this from happening in the first place. Paulie, honey, I love you, and I really want to help you, but you have to trust me. Please trust me. Okay, you have two ways of answering this for me. Either you did this, or he did this to himself. - Which one is it? - No. Which answer, Neal? Which answer is gonna make us less miserable? You don't really think that I would ever do that to him, do you? So he did it to himself? I didn't say that. God damn it, Neal! Knock this shit off, please! 'Cause I don't think you two can survive another day! I don't think I can survive another day of this! I know. This is not the way to protect your little brother. You know, he doesn't need you making excuses for him. He needs you being a man, standing up for him. I'm trying. Dad thinks you did it. Really? Angela thinks you did it. She does? If she says that to my face, I'm gonna call her a bitch to hers. Well, then that'd be the first time you talked to her. Did it hurt when it grabbed you? No, it... It felt worse. Like what'd it feel like? It was cold and... and numb, and it felt like I was... Falling asleep? Yeah. Jesus Christ. Okay, boys, it's late. Let's try this again, shall we? Come on, honey, let's get you back to bed. Honey, come here. I'm really worried about you. How can I make this better? Can I have my sleeping bag? Sure, I'll go get your sleeping... No. Paulie's sleeping in a bed like a normal person, and this door is staying locked. The sooner you two get past this phase... The sooner we can go on living our lives. What are you doing? What am I doing? Normal people sleep in the dark! So is he! It's a little extreme, Terry. Come on, please? Come on. Neal. Come on. Boys? Paulie? Neal? Wake up. Good morning. You okay? Yeah, Dad, we're both fine. Okay, Well, it's... It's breakfast time. Come on. I know. Thank you, Sam. I really appreciate it. Yes, I will. Thanks. Bye-bye. They understand. They're not happy, but they... they get it. I'm sorry, Ang. It's okay, honey. It's not your fault. I found Neal in Paulie's room this morning. - What? - Snuck in. Oh, my gosh. At least they didn't kill each other. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. I swear to God, Ang, I have no idea what to do. Did Dad tell you about Mom's grave? One of his letters had pictures of it. Yeah, well, she's not there. No fuckin' way. I wanted her to stay here, and Dad said it was okay as long as he didn't see it. So I keep it in here. You remember Mom staying in the house after the fire reached the living room? That night... I begged her to stay with me so she could see what was under the bed. She did, and... she died because she believed me. She was protecting us. I miss her. Look, you gotta hold it from the side, too. Keep your finger on the trigger. Keep it steady and push forward with your back hand. In. You'd have to be pretty close to hurt it with this, right? Well, yeah. We'd have to get closer than we've ever been before sooner or later. What makes you think we can kill it? I think it's afraid of us, and it wouldn't be afraid of anything if it couldn't die, Paul. Would you be? We're something this thing has never dealt with before. What? We're brothers. Oh, shit. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Uh, Neal, dear? Let's leave that alone for the time being. Dad taught me to use it before. Well, he's not here right now, so, uh, put it down. I'll be fine. Put it down, please. Come on, pal. Paulie? Sweetheart, please tell me what's going on. It's not a big deal. Well, if you can just tell me a little bit, honey, maybe I can, I don't know, somehow help you? If you want to help him, stay out of his way. It looks pretty good in there. Yeah, not bad for two hours of sleep between us. We're okay. Before I got sent away, I used to sleep anywhere I could, like the kitchen, Mom and Dad's room, outside. I slept in the garage a few times, but it only ever got to me when I would try to sleep in beds. It's bound to beds. Why? I don't know. I have theories, I guess. Beds are where people sleep the most, so if it usually strikes when you sleep, it makes sense. That's where you have the most dreams and nightmares. Maybe that's what it looks for. Maybe. I have another theory, too, but you can't freak out. Go ahead. I read once that you shed a lot of dead skin cells in your bed. Like while you sleep, you know, like, your bed is full of dead skin and pieces of your body. Maybe it starts by, like, feeding on... on your dead flesh before it, you know... Before that's not good enough anymore. Yeah. You looking at that old Polaroid? Yeah. You know about this? Yeah, I found it after you left. So that's what it looks like, right? That crazy face? I guess. I never tried to take another picture after this one, so... I did. You did? Yeah. I thought that if I could prove it was real then you'd come back sooner, you know. So I started taking pictures under the bed, staying up late, making noise, you know, stuff like that. Until one night, that mist came out of nowhere, and it's never gone away since then. Can you sleep? Neal? Neal! What? Run. Come on, Paulie, this way! ' Oh, my God! Paulie, that's my old bed! Aah! You okay? No. Come on, boys, wake up. You been asleep all afternoon. What is all that? We're gonna try something new tonight, something fun. Mr. Evans next door has offered to have you guys spend the night. His boys would love to have you both for a sleepover. You gotta be fucking joking. Neal, come on. Dad, didn't you just finish telling us we need to grow up? I mean, what the hell? - Neal, stop it. - They're expecting you anytime, so whenever you're ready, up you come, boys. Come on, it's gonna be fun. Paulie, you're not gonna need that. Give that to me. Thank you, honey. But, Dad... No, she's right, honey. Come on. - Thank you, sweetie. Here. - It's all right. Take this. Neal, get up. Here you go. Have fun, honey. Be good, please? Oh. Hey, guys- Hey, Cara. Is everything okay? Hey, boys, glad you took me up on my offer to come over. Well, it just sounded too good to pass up. Hey, there's little Paul. Boy, you're really growing up fast, little man. Only not fast enough. So you're staying here with my brothers? Yeah. I gotta stay close to Paulie, you know. Yeah, I guess. Okay, Robert, Richard, our guests have arrived. Okay, yeah. Got it. Now, uh, they're gonna be staying all night, so you make sure that they, uh, feel like this place is their home, okay? Excuse me. Hey, guys. Hey. Sorry, we don't have any extra chairs. Is it cool if we just throw our pillows on your bed? Hey, Neal. You know how you were talking about dead skin cells on our bed and stuff? Well, do you think they could be on our pillows, too? I mean, I've had this since I was six. You think that'd be enough to get it over here? No. No way. What's going on? I was gonna ask you. Having fun? Time of my life. Sorry it was weird, me being here. No, it's okay. I just came over here to say if you get bored with these spazzes, you can come down the hall and find me and I can make us some tea. We can catch up. Yeah, that's cool. Thanks. I just have to wait till Paulie falls asleep, and... Cool. Ohh. Hmm. It's a nice TV. Yeah. Thanks. Is it bigger than the one you guys have? We don't have a TV. What the hell do you mean, you don't have a TV? We just don't, that's all. Our dad took it away a few years ago. Was it TV that made you go all, you know? No, it wasn't, because... It's cool, Paul. No, actually, nobody knew at the time, so they just got rid of it. Better safe than sorry. So it's true that they took you away to the prison for the criminally insane? Why do you have to be such a jerk like that? We have the right to know who's in our house. Everybody's talking about it. They say you disappeared after your mom died. And you tried to burn the house down. So maybe I did. What the hell's with that? I mean, what happened to your brain? Do you really want to know? Neal, let's not talk about that. Do you two really want to know? Then pause your movie. These lights are going off. Terry? Yeah, yeah! I got it! God damn it. God! Oh, Terry! What are you doing? Terry? Ouch, jeez. Oh! Oh, my God. I tried to kill it with fire. Give me a break. The fire took down most of our house, and it even got my mom. But that's not what's really scary. What's really scary is that it survived. What did? Some crazy guy? Not a man, not a human. Something that you can't see and you can't read about. You can only hear about it or learn about it as it attacks you. And now Paulie's getting attacked. Paul, show them. No, Neal. Paul, show them. Whatever! You could have done that to him! I would never do that to my brother. Neal, this is stupid. Let's just leave. Yeah, you two go find something fake to hide from. Yeah, take your crazy somewhere else. What's the matter, boys? You afraid of what might be living right next door to you? Yeah, you and your cuckoo bird fuckin' brother ready to burn our house down. Paul, what did you say that thing felt like when it grabbed you? He said it felt icy cold and numb like a dead arm grasping at you. I never said that. You feel your body start to fall asleep. That's how it likes its food, immobile, but still alive. It attacks you while you sleep. If you move, if you make a sound, if you get too close... It's too late for you. Yeah, right. If you believe that, you're even crazier than anyone could guess. I wouldn't wish believing in this on my worst fucking enemy, including you two. Neal? Paul, come on, what is it? Look at their floor. Wh-what's this stuff? Fog? Hey, is this some kind of a joke? GUYS, guys, Shh! Uh, it's just mist from outside. Knock it off! Don't talk! Guys, stop! Don't move. Don't make a sound. Paulie, run! Aah! Aah! Aah! Neal! Aah! Mom! Dad! Help! Aah! Cara, stop! Don't move! You're in the light! As fast as you can, run to your room, turn the light on, and don't come out no matter what you hear! What about you? I'm going after my brother! Cara, run! Okay, it's just me. "Dad" "Dad!" - Dad! - Dad! It's us! What the hell's going... Close the door! What the hell's going on, you two? Were you guys just in here five minutes ago? No, Dad! We have to get out of this house! We have to leave right now! Was one of you walking around all wrapped up in a sheet or not, damn it? No, no, no! That's the thing that's after us! You guys are just little monsters! I've done nothing but try to be nice to you! Angela! We're sorry, but you have to listen to us now! - Listen to you? How can I... - We have to get out of this house! - We have to leave right now! - Listen to you?! Run! Get down! Get down! Aah! No! No! Honey, no! Aah! Aah! Dad! Aah! Dad! Aah! " Dad! ' Aah! Terry! Terry! Paul! Paul, get out of here! Get out! Angela! Turn the lights on! I can't, Neal! The power's off! Oh, my God! It's okay. It's okay, I'm here. It got Dad! Oh, my God. - I know. It's not afraid of us, Neal. It's not afraid. It's not gonna get us! Angela, are you okay? What is that thing? We need to get out of this house right now! We need to move quickly and quietly and get out the front door. There's more lights by the street. I'm gonna open the door, and then we're gonna move. Angela, you first, then you, Paulie, then me. Get ready. Paulie, look out! Aah! Aah! Neal! Neal, help! Aah! Neal! Neal, no! Paulie! Paulie! Paulie! Take me! Take me! Paulie! Paulie! Oh, my God! Angela, listen to me! Listen to me, please! This thing has been after me for two years. If it wanted Paulie, it would have taken him a long time ago. It just wants me. It's using Paulie as bait to get to me. But if I don't go after him now, it's gonna be too late. No, no, Neal, no! No, I think I can find a way to get to it, but I... I need your help, please. Angela, I can't do this without you. I need you. I need your help. Okay, okay, okay. What do you want me to do? Get some rope. Okay, Angela, I'm gonna do this. Come here. Good luck, sweetheart. Come back to me, okay? Oh, and, Neal... no matter what happens, I will not let go of this fucking rope! You hear me? Go, go, hurry! Paulie!? Oh, no. Shit! Paulie? Paulie? Neal! Neal! I can't believe it! I told you we were in this shit together, didn't I? Where are we, Neal? I don't know. Why are we in hell? What did we do wrong? We're not, Paulie. We're still alive, and I need you to keep it together with me, okay? Angela's still got the other end of this back in the bedroom. She's not gonna let go. Dad's dead. He's gone. Yeah, Paulie, he's gone. But we're gonna live to remember him just like Mom. Come on, Paulie! Hurry, hurry! Look, Paulie, there's the rope. You can reach it, all right? - I'm gonna hold you up! - No, no! I can't reach that! Paulie, you can do this, okay? I need you to do this! Unh! Come on, Paulie! Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, honey! Oh, my God! It's good to see you! Oh, Neal! Oh, God! Oh, thank... thank you! Neal! Oh, my God! They're all dead! Oh, my God! Die! Come! Oh! Oh! Come on! Die! Aah! No, Paulie! Neal, the ashes! Mom! Aaaah! Unh!
