 

                        I was a bit tense. Will they let us do it again? We'll do it as often as we like. Adrien, finish in the visitor's room in 5 minutes. I love you. In spite of the aggro that's brought you? That'll all soon be over. Amlie drew this for you. This how she see's us. When you get out... So, was it good? The next time we'll make it a 3... or a 4. What's the big idea?. You wanna leave here in a coffin? So what? Makes more for you. You know where the goddamn cash is. Is it safe? I can put some buddies on the job. They'll guard it 'til we get out. I wouldn't trust any buddies of yours. Yeah! And any reason why I should trust YOU? That's a nice drawing. Is it your daughter's? I didn't think we were on speaking terms. It was good like that. You know... ...there's not much nice in the world. You gotta hang on to it. Come on you two, out! Time for a walk Why I would go out today? Nice weather. You know the risk I'd be taking. You didn't have to assault that girl. I did NOT do it. Yeah...I was forgetting. And I s'pose your stickups were done by your twin brother. Or you wanted to pay for your sick mother's operation. Can I go now? OK you scum... move it! Everyone here? Let's go! [Speaking Russian] Isn't your rock-spider pal coming? Scared, is he? He's saying... I don't give a fuck what apes say. Translate that! I'm innocent. I know I'll be cleared eventually. I've got to survive in this rat-hole. I'm called a rock-spider. They want me dead. I continue praying my ordeal will come to an end. You sure? You get out. Without making touble. If you don't wanna cop shit... ...then scram. Don't you move. What do you want? As you don't go out, we've come to pay you a visit. [Russian] You hear...repeat it. "Spasiba." Go on...repeat it. Spasiba. That means thank you. You'll repeat it. Understood? We'll see if the little girls get you excited now. That's enough. Qu'est-ce tu veux?. We better go down before there's serious shit. That's enough...stop! Shut up...get out! You shouldn't've got involved. Because you defended him. That's not what the report says. The employment agency's got nothing for me. I can't afford the nanny. I can't afford the speech therapist. And we've got all that money. Do you realise that this guy Franck Adrien, went into hiding near our place after his stick-up. In Nivre. He's been put with me to protect me. I'm there to protect you. That's true. Why don't you tell me where you've hidden it? I'd just take what we need. Trust me for once. The reason I'm here's because I was trusting. I don't get to sleep. Every other day, they forget my medication. The lawyer's going to see what he can do. You believe I'm going to get out of this? Of course. Her mother said to the judge that she'd invented everything. He's going to question her and she's going to crack. You're getting out... it's going to happen. You'll give me a child. You didn't need to bring her in here. This is no place for her. She wanted to come. What'd she say? She wanted to see her father. While I'm in here I'm not her father. I don't want her to see me as a convict. I'm sorry, Franck. We miss you so. I miss both of you, too. Amlie, you'll fall over. Careful! What a cutie! What's your name? She can't reply. She has speaking problems. She's going to learn to speak. It'll take time. She may be right to take her time. Say goodbye. 'Bye, Amlie. You make a move and you're a vegetable. You wanna kill me, Novick? Don't you wanna get your dough? Exactly...the Russki won't miss you. I wanna know where the cash's stashed. So my buddies can take care of it. Look, they're not far away. You've got nothing to say? Go fuck yourself. Cough up! You know Marco's hideout I'm listening. It is under the false floor. G'day, Franck. How long've I been here? And Novick? In solitary. He only got a week. So he get's out in 3 days... gotta get outta here quick. You're worried about your cash? Whadda you talking about? The reason you're in here. Novick want's to pinch it. Do you want any help? How? I'm getting out! The girl's retracted her story. She made it all up from A to Z. There won't even be a new trial. I want to give you my phone number. Call when you get out. This is not a good idea. Why? I won't forget what you did. Let me help you. I don't owe you anything. Yes, that's quite right. You're right. OK. Cheers. Call me. There's something you could do. it's... call my wife. Tell her I'm well and that Novick's watching her. And then also, she should see my father, he'll help her. Could you do that for me? Sure, you can trust me. Nothing's changed. We even tidied your cell. Novick's out? He said you wanted to take his share. He wanted to kill you. He's been transferred to Fresnes. Happy? Cigarettes? I been waiting 3 days. Adrien. Visitors room. You can feel the evil in here. The colour-scheme doesn't help. Nobody made you come. Manuel Carrega, constabulary captain. Has something happened to Anna? Anna? I've got questions regarding Jean-Louis Maurel. Maurel?. He shared your cell. You know he was accused of raping a little girl? Everyone knew about it. He's been found innocent. What did he tell you about his life? I wasn't interested. He told me he was from Nevers, I've lived there and we talked a bit about it. He mention any places, people? What are you on about? I'm not on about him... but I am about his next victims. Wadsn't he the victim? Legally, yes. Do I trust what he's capable of? Didn't the girl retract her story? Maurel's wife managed to get to her. You haven't charged her? I'm looking for proof. I need your testimony. What have you seen or heard while you were with him? He seemed quite normal. He's a manipulator. He's cunning. He's fooled more than one person. He hasn't fooled me. for a woman. She'd left a guy who beat her up. I warned that her ex was dangerous. For nothing. He set fire to where we lived. She's dead. I've survived. I've escaped death to help save others. If anything else comes back to you. And if you'd just come from the asylum? Believe me... I'm not the mad one. The answering machine contains too many messages. Please try again later. Goodbye. Come on. I'm taking you to the meeting. He had to come Were are you going? Not far. He'll pay double. Cinderella following Big Sister, out. Waiting for Prince Charming. We'll follow and join up. OK Is it far? It's here. You want to stay? It's him who says what he wants. She's perfect. You can leave us. Will I move? We don't know if it's him. What's she doing? She's confirming. Let me do it. You start undressing first. Your turn. I'm thirsty. Could I get a glass of water? It's Costa, go! We've got him, boys! Don't move! Go, go! Turn over, you fuck! I wanna see your hands! Move it! Move it! All OK? He's in the bag. The Corsican was right. You were perfect. Come on, get a move on. You stay there. Nico, a bit of privacy. [Russian] I'm not translating. Vous tes 3! Franck. I can fix everything. Nico! Let me out! They're going to kill me! Let me out! Nico, open the door! I'll kill you, you fucker! Nico! Shit. a va, chef?. The Costas'll spend Christmas in the clink. Hang on... Ren's more cunning. We'll need to be more cunning to catch him.. Exactly. Has The Holy Ghost finished with your cover? He wants Claire downstairs. And whadda YOU want? Couldn't ask for more. The prisoner who got out dressed as a guard. Franck Adrien, in for the bank stickup. I know. So? He had 2 months to go. He's not ready. He's going to make the usual mistakes getting back the hidden loot. Anyone can catch him. I'm staying on the Costas. The boss wants the best. The troop that's just had you and your team. If it's so simple, you'll be back with the Costas in no time. Thank you, monsieur. That's OK. Would you know where to find the eggs? They're at the end, through there. Would it be too much to ask to come with me? I always get lost with all these aisles. Yes, follow me. - Melissa! I'm waiting for you. Sorry, gotta go. Doesn't matter, I'll find them myself. The man thwarted the security checks. Franck Adrien, convicted for the holdup of the Savings Bank didn't have more than 8 months of prison left. He may be armed and is considered dangerous. Got it... au revoir, monsieur. D'you think he'll understand? Nothing to worry about. The police have good info, now. Christine, we knew he'd get out one day. i've got everything worked out. He doesn't know what's waiting for him. Trust me. Nobody's going to take our happiness away. She's sleeping? She looks so adorable like that. Thanks for giving her to me. He's got very few connections. He avoids his relations. His wife? Yeah. Anna Martens. She used to visit him. She's unemployed, takes care of the kid. The address she gave is phony. And his accomplices? Guests of the state. Jrme Novick was at Mrancourt. It wasn't a great love affair. He attacked Adrien with a screwdriver. Nice boy. I'm going to question him. How much did they get? We've only got back pocket money. He's going to want to get the money back. Watch the places he knows. Houses, bars. His picture's everywhere. I've asked for his visiting room videos. a, c'est quoi?. Those who could've seen him in their area. Dobbing-in's a national sport. Has the media spoken to Anna? No. We got an address for Anna in the suburbs. Who's he? Anna?. Hey, watch where you're going! What's going on? Turn them out! Nobody leaves. Are you staying here? No, I'm covering you. Police, step aside. Out of the way! That's it. Police, open up! No one! Come here. Look. We just missed him. Marco! Coming! He's not far away. We need reinforcements, He's in the area. With luick, we'll be back in an hour. Avec de la chance, dans une heure, on est rentrs. Don't move! Don't you move. Let me past. Of course! Anything else? I can't go back to prison now. Don't move! I've learnt something very important. You can't shoot, I'm not threatening you You can see I'm unarmed Adrien is on the street. Warn everyone! There he is! Stop him! You OK? Close the next station! If the train stops he'll get off. Is he crazy? Divide up the zone and set up road blocks. I know, good...thanks. He's probably already far away. Here... ...yours? He's crazy. Something's driving him. Something really strong. "Anna, wherever you are, I'll find you." She's cleared off with the cash. Two for the price of one? Yeah, that'll make The Holy Ghost happy. Yes? Why did you do it? Franck, I knew you'd call. How are you? Tell me, why did you do it? Why did you kill her? It was all her fault. Thank God... I know how to read people. Your wife was unreliable. She would have given you problems. I chose to save you from all that. What've you done with Amlie? What've you done with my little daughter? Where is she, Maurel? Have you killed her? She's a lovely little thing. I love her very much. I shan't do her any harm at all. Unless you try to find me. What is it? He wants us to grab Adrien on his return. He's in Corsica. I'd love to go down to Corsica. Anna's scrap of paper? Amlie's drawings. Nave style endowed with a certain potential. Letters for her guy that she hadn't sent. Love letters. "I understand your gesture. It's a proof of love." The stickup. Why hadn't she posted this deathless prose? To be read in prison? Not on. They aren't the words of a woman stabbing someone in the back. And Novick? A heap of new insults. It's a put-up job between Adrien and his chick. We know the addresses he's given, except for this one. Le Pr-sur-Lamure? What's that? Their hide-out after the bank job. Martin, go round! What's this? What's this bullshit? [Russian] No thanks. Are your reinforcements coming? They're coming. The policeman's refrain. Are we gonna find the loot? If it's not already gone. What's that? Why've you come? It's nothing to do with your daughter. What would you know? Best you go home. We should be Corsican. There's something here! Capitain, come here. Stay there. Look. Robert, no! Pull him back! Nobody touch anything. It was his daughter? Yeah. Julie. Disappeared. He'd been hoping she was just a runaway. The guy who did that is a monster. Is it one of Adrien's victims? No way that it fits Adrien's profile. He has a wife and a disabled child. That doesn't fit with a killer There are always exceptions. There are some connections. He was living in the area when Julie disappeared. We found his DNA on the map and the jacket. That's not all. What else? There are 2 other maps of areas way up in the mountains. Maybe we'll find other bodies. We're not going to get carried away If it's a serial killer, they'll want to bring in the Feds. They'd want the file. We have to get him now. Listen, Claire. They don't teach this at police school, but next time, this guy doesn't get to get away. Understood? Quite understood. Have a good day. I don't want to hurt you. What the fuck are you doing here? You're going to help me find Maurel. Where are your guns? I don't have any. Don't take me for an idiot, where are they? They're there. In the cupboard. Go. He always lived in the area. I met him 5 years ago. I questioned him about a girl from Dijon. Sylvie Desme. He'd been seen talking to her. I smelled a rat. Maurel raised too many questions. He lied about details. I sensed that he was playing with me. He was a bad one. The girl was never found... no body, no proof. There were the other disappearances. The resemblance is striking. It's been admitted that it was a serial killer. But a cop investigates facts, not potential suspects. You've gone ahead anyway? Quietly. Got nowhere for a long time. He was invisible. No record, town hall official, liked by all. He was never far away when the disappearances occurred. Finally, a month apart. I brought Maurel in, but his DNA didn't match. For the second time, he trapped us. His sperm sample was at the station, Next day it'd disappeared. I was suspected. At the same time, he brought a complaint against me for harassment. I was dismissed. I'm not allowed to live near him. You're no longer in the constabulary? No, I lied to you. I investigate privately. Bugger! I was hoping you'd be able to help me. The little girl's 5. She doesn't look like these girls... Could he harm her? She's not his normal victim type. If he wanted to have a good time, he wouldn't hesitate. I've got the phone number. An old constabulary captain's maybe got some contacts? Want a snort? [Russian] - Thanks! It's good stuff. The paper? You know him? The constabulary have found 2 more bodies. Sylvie Desme and Karine Garcia, reported missing. This is a serial killer for sure! Thanks , I'm on it. A truck driver dropped Adrien at Luzon, in Nivre. You coming? Yeah, coming. I've come to see Bourgoin. You got a serial killer for 'im? Bourgoin, Luzon Constabulary office. I need information on a suspect's number. It's me. You got something? The line's been dead for 48 hours. He used it 12 times. The last time was to Pr-sur-Lamure. One of my hideouts. What else? Several calls to the Alpes-Maritimes region. Where in Alpes-Maritimes? There's an area of 40 k's around a village. Chasseignes. That's maybe where he's living. He takes a medication, Xyrex. He was jumpy when he didn't get it. Is there a pharmacy in Chasseignes? There are the cops everywhere. You reported me? No I didn't. Where's your gun? A gun's against regu... Stuff your regulations. I wouldn't need to depend on you. Carrega?. How come you're here? I was looking for Bourgoin. He's directing the search. The search? The fugitive's been reported in the area. He may have killed What do you mean? Including Sylvie Desme. You remember her. I'm going to give you a hand. Carrega... you forgotten you don't work here any more? Take the lane. We're taking the lane with the tall hedges. Your guns, over the hedge. Hurry up! Go on! On the ground! On the ground! Stay down or... Or you'll strangle me like the others? What are you talking about? Sylvie Desme, Karine Garcia, they ring a bell? What are you talking about? Your DNA on the maps in your old hideout. HQ to Bravo 2. Put me on to Capitain Line. Bugger! He's fucked you like he's fucked me. Stop! All units! Stop! Stop him! Get in! Bugger, there he is! Stop! You OK? They believe it's you... I know. Who do YOU think it is? Maurel, as I've always known. Chasseignes's 600 km. There's one pharmacy. There's the address. Bugger! They've been warned. Hang on! Stop! Jump out! Don't worry, he's gotta be stopped! Think about your daughter, jump! The injured man is in intensive care at Auxerre hospital. Condition serious. They used to think he was crazy. Now they're upset. Not my problem. Got Adrien? No. On and on it goes. Tell me, how did he make Carrega smash through a road-block? Believe me, he's very persuasive. For you, eh? All looks very nice and expensive. This isn't a parade! You had him! It's just a matter of time. There's no time left! The constabulary's furious. We've allowed a killer to escape. I'm responsible. I'm in charge. A bit of criminal analysis 'd do you good. Commander... Why did you spare him? I'm not sure he's the one who killed them. I beg your pardon? He could have shot me. It doesn't add up. You put in a report based on woman's intuition. I'm going to try and get Adrien... ...and not miss him. Cut off between D981 and D18 in the Beuch forest. Received, Delta 3. Block off the intersection of Rue de l'tang and D981... On D18... No sign of suspect. Suspect has escaped area. Christine, I've never been so happy. Me too. It's hard for me to stop thinking about that guy. His face is plastered everywhere. The police'll get him. Look. France's Most Wanted. Come on. I'm going to buy you a dress. Here's a beautiful dress! You like it? You'll try it on? You'll be a real princess. My goodmess, you're so beautiful! Jean-Louis! Isn't she beautiful with this? Jean-Louis?. No, Jean-Louis. I told you, Christine. I gave you the little girl. It's too risky. The little girl is too. You saw how she was looking at the newspapers? You got nothing new, whatta you stuffing 'round with? I'm matching Adrien's movements with his supposed crimes. Supposed? You think that we're pinning these murders on him? He thinks so. He said: "He's fucked me." Who was he talking about? I know it's someone we should be looking for. Can you help me? I should be out on the job. Please! Alright..No! Don't wanna know about it! You're a pain in the neck. Go back to Paris. Shit! Excuse me. Can you help me? We're looking for a doctor.... Our daughter's sick. She has a stomach ache. There's Dr Berlot. He's further on, in Verneuil. You need to kep to the right and... Coukld you show us perhaps? I have to get back. We'll take you home afterwards. You'd be a great help. Hullo. My wife's worried it could be serious. Alright then. Get in the front. It's easier. Let me take that. I'll mind it. Thanks. We all belt up in my car. This is very nice of you. How old are you? That's it then. At 16, girls are still very nice. Do you have a boyfriend? No. It's there on the right. No, we'd rather keep going to the right. That doesn't bother you? I was talking about, whether you had a boyfriend? Yes. What's that got to do with anything? It doesn't concern you. I want to get out. What are you doing? Leave me alone! Help! What are you up to? I love you. Will they let us do it again? An envelope for you. From Paris. Thanks I was waiting for it. It's him. What about it? He's been to see Adrien in prison. Are you saying that... They'd already met. Hadn't you realised that? They've taken ages to send this stuff. Carrega used an alias to see Adrien. Olivier Desme. One of Adrien's victims was Sylvie Desme. Carrega was obsessed with the case. He claimed to know the identity of the killer. Adrien? So, some miserable wretch... Named what? He was quetioned. What was his name again...? Yeah... Maurel! That's it, Jean-Louis Maurel. Here we are! Had some work done here... And there Careful. Attention. Ideal for a family. Rent's not high. The owner's keen. All this'll be removed. An address? You aren't on the job. If Lucciani finds out... Give me the address. Maurel rented a house in the Alpes-Maritimes He pays through a Swiss bank in Lausanne Are you going to give me the address? You're not planning on going there? I'm very late. Jean-Jacques, I know. I'll get the ball rolling. Let's go! Everybody hungry? I told him. That's him for sure. He strangled those girls? A woman has a daughter who disappeared yesterday. Girl aged 16. That's her. See you soon. Next time at our place. Return match. Take care. Jean-Louis Maurel? That's me. Claire Linn, I'm looking for Franck Adrien. That's someone I'd rather forget. May I come in? Certainly. This is my wife, Christine. My little sweetie-pie. It's Daddy. I think I've told you everything. He hasn't been in touch with you? If he had, I would've called the police. I was the victim of a judicial mistake. I wouldn't want to help a criminal. Is it true what was reported? The enquiry's underway, madame. Look carefully. Is this the man that was at the supermarket. I don't think so. What is it I'm fed up, Alex. Claire... Claire inquired about Jean-Louis Maurel. Woman's intuition? Maurel lives 20km from here. What? She's gone there. Call her. She's not contactable. Should we go there? I wish I could've been more help. Don't hesitate to call. Will do. So happy to see you here. I've missed you. How did you find our little nest? It's cosy. Thanks to you, Franck. I'll never be able to thank you enough. You're my guardian angel. He's got Amlie. Trust me...he'll give her back to us. You know, Franck, nobody understands what I'm looking for. Nobody. Nobody. Filthy scum! It's all over, now. We're all back together. The whole family. Not in front of her. Drop your gun! I said drop your gun! He's here...I've got him. He wanted to kill us! Don't move! Jean-Louis! Jean-Louis! Get him! he's got Amlie! The cop? I'll fix that. Stop here. You go on, I'll take a look. Would you like to walk on ahead, Amlie? Don't go near the edge. Stay close to Daddy. You OK, Franck? Maurel. Maurel! Don't move. Drop your gun! I've got the fugitive. He's down there. Maurel! Help's coming. Franck. it's all over, Amlie's safe. Cri de douleur There's extenuating circumstances. Trust me. I can't trust anyone. It'll be the last time. Who fired? You bastard! It came from over there! Drop it you bastard! Drop your gun! Don't move! Raise your hands. In the air! Don't move! take it easy. Look along here. That's it, thanks. I'm here. You OK? Yes, thanks. We've got Maurel. Adrien's body must have gone further. We'll find it. You know, Claire... No better. Maurel's wife's spilled the beans. He was doing all the killing and raping. Not Adrien. She's admitted 8 murders, but there's others. Without Adrien, there would have been more. Go and tell him. And say what? I lack your woman's intuition. Thank you, Claire. I tried to aim for once Three months later She's solitary, but she's hanging in there. She's working better with the speech therapist. She's happy when you come to see her. You told me to tell you about any mail. She got a letter. I have a photocopy. From Morocco? Just this, no words? No, since she got the letter, she's seemed happier. Do you know who it's from? Papa.
