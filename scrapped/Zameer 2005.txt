 

                        Come on... come on... Move ahead... come on... move ahead... Fine... fine... What is the matter? You got the salary today... ...and you are running away without meeting us? Come on... give us the money, come on. No, brother. I am in a lot of trouble this month. My daughter has been Paralyzed. I need money. I have to have her cured. Hey, what will you do by curing her? As it is, it is better if the handicaPPed PeoPle die. Get lost! Son... these PeoPle snatched my money. I need money. My daughter has been Paralyzed. HelP me, son. Brother... - What? Someone is calling you downstairs. Who? I don't know who it is. Suraj... Suraj, my friend. You didn't recognize me? It is a lot of years and therefore... I searched for you everywhere. I went everywhere. Wherever I heard that you were there... ...I would run to reach there. I had lost... ...hoPe that we would meet again. Does anyone become so angry on anyone? Suraj. I have come here to take you back. I have come here, so far... in the search of Peace. Don't trouble me. Go away from here. So... did you get Peace? Wow... The one who needs Peace... do they come to Kolkatta? Suraj... Nothing has made you stay here in hiding. What has haPPened like that, Suraj? Who doesn't have sadness in their lives? I don't want to remember all those things. I have saved myself from scattering with great difficulty. Sorry, Suraj. If I have hurt your heart, I am sorry. But my friend, if you are talking about Peace and tranquility... ...I am sorry to say, I don't agree to it. You are lying to yourself. I don't know... I don't know! This is my life. And I will live it as I wish, understood? Do I have any life or not? Am I mad to search for you since five years? I am searching you. The PeoPle whom you left and came how are they... ...related to me? Why am I wandering around for them? Am I a fool? Suraj, you know me very well. Whatever I think and do, it will be for your own good. There must be something, because... ...of which I am telling you to come from here? Suraj... I haven't come here to Pick on your wounds. I haven't come here to trouble you. Suraj, I have come here to take your troubles away. Suraj, Please believe me. I am asking something from you for the first time. You won't do this much for your friend? You won't agree to what he says? Just this once... I thought that till I would live... I wouldn't come here. I cannot tolerate all this, dildar. Why did you bring me here? See, it is late in the night now. SleeP now. We will sPeak in the morning. Excuse me... This is a girl's college. - I know. Then, what are you doing here? I love girls. Date? The date again? Come in. A date and a date once again. What do these film Producers give? Just a date? If you go to their offices ten times... ...and you get is a date! If you call... ...them uP fifty times, all you get is a date! The worst of the actors get a role. And what does armaan Khan get? Just a date! What is the matter, Mr. Armaan? Wow... what is the matter, Mr. Armaan? These film PeoPle just give two things. Either a Promise, or just a date. What didn't I do to tackle Mr. Raj. And what did he give me in resPonse? Just a date. Mr. Armaan, you will get a role. But first, Please give us something hot to eat. We are very hungry. - Yes, armaan. Tell me something. Is food not cooked in your house? You are hungry! It is cooked, Mr. Armaan. But the fact of the matter is... ...the taste of your hand cooked food... ...that is great! - Really? - Yes. I have an idea. You PeoPle have a seat. I will serve you afghani omelette today. I will have to accePt it. Pooja has kePt such a wonder fool cook. Like that, our Pooja is not less of a wonder fool. Hey... I have wonderful news. Wonder fool news? No, not wonder fool, it is wonderful news. Our college has a new lecturer today. So? What is new in that? They do come and go. He isn't of the breed who come and go. He is very handsome. - More than me? How can he be comPared to you? He is young... dashing... daring... More than me? How can he be comPared to you? He cannot be comPared to me too. But there is something... That you have and he doesn't. - What? Brains. Then, Pooja will have to be given this wonderful news. But where is she? Where is she? Where can she be? She can be at only two Places. Either in the classroom or the bathroom. Pooja... a new lecturer... ...has come in the desert of our college... ...just like a droP of rain. I heard it. Therefore, I had to dress uP ProPerly today. Let that droP of rain come to know too... That because he has come, a new flower has bloomed. Mr. Armaan. That means you have PrePared... ...the Plan to welcome him earlier? Yes. He will be welcomed ProPerly today. I will tell you about myself before the class starts. I am Suraj chauhan. You must be knowing that I am... ...dePuted here for just six months. And if you cooPerate with me these... ...six months will be very helPful to you. Another thing. I need your full concentration and sincerity in my classroom. Let's begin. Come on... come on... Excuse us. Sir. - Yes? - Shall we? Are you from this class? We were of this class till yesterday. Why are you late? The Powder had finished. - What? Make uP... make uP... sir... actually, I went in to aPPly the Powder... ...and I found out that it had finished. When the Powder came, I found... ...out that the Perfume had finished too. When the Perfume came I found out that there wasn't any cream. I had to go to the market many a times, sir. And when I had to go, I had to come too. Actually, sir... This is your first day in college... and this is our first fisticuffs... I mean... a first meeting with you, isn't it, sir? I have to look beautiful, isn't it, sir? The ones who laugh on a rotten joke are fools. And I haven't come here to judge the Miss India contest. Take your seat. Thank you, sir. Hi... Let's continue. Carbohydrates consist of... - One second, sir. - Yes? Sir, you said that the ones who laugh... ...on a rotten joke are fools. What is a standard joke, sir? My subject is chemistry, not jokes. An imPortant grouP of naturally occurring substances. Hydrogen and oxygen. As elements in... War... Terrorists in the college? I had heard about them in the Parliament. What nonsense is this? College terrorism? Yes, sir. What is all this? What is haPPening? I think you know better than me about these girls. No. We gave sir a guard of honor. Did we do anything wrong. Sir? Hundred Percent wrong. He is our guest. He has come in our college to teach for just six months. Do you act like this with your guests? I will rePort. I will rePort all of you. Should you be killed... Should be left... tell me... Sir... We stay here too, sir. Your neighbors. Will you Pet something in this, sir? I like to rear honeybees. Any Problems? No... no Problems, sir, shall we helP you? I will call you if I need you. Please call us, sir. We burst crackers in the class. But we aren't that bad girls, sir. The cracker guy? Greetings, sir. Armaan Khan. These girls stay with me. Actually, I have a lot of contacts in the society. Even if you have any Problem, tell me. Shut uP! Sister, I will go to the market. Armaan... listen... go to the market. ...and get my sPecial betel leaf. - Betel leaf? The one that you get every time. Kiwam... raw and eatable, 120, Pure. Remember it. The high society PeoPle have a high choice. Like that... what do you like... sir? I like to teach insolent PeoPle some culture. Now mind your own business. Thank you, sir. He is angry. The scaredy cat. A moon like face stays in the window next to me. A moon like face stays in the window next to me. Hey, Neeta. Did he leave? It seems that he is inside. - Okay. There is a letter box here. That means that he must be waiting for letters too. Who will send letters to such a Person? Who is always angry? Idea! Come on. Take the PaPer and Pen out. Come on, bend. The first letter will be from us. But what? Yes! Sir... Suraj sir... Yes? Sorry, sir. We are sorry. Actually, when we woke uP today in the morning. We thought about it. We thought about it a lot. About what haPPened yesterday. It was a bit more. Therefore, we girls have come to aPologize. Yes, sir, Please forgive us. You PeoPle have come to know your mistake. I was very Pleased hearing it. If laughing and making others laugh... ...crosses it's limit, the whole life is a joke. You are good in your studies. You should concentrate on your studies. Sit down. Let me sit... move... let me sit... So, where are you from? Sir... my daddy stays in Poona. It seems that I don't know your names. Sir, I am Ena... I am Neeta. - And I am Sanjana. Sir, do you know? The lecturer before you... he couldn't see straight! When he saw Sanjana, it felt that he was seeing me. And when he was seeing me, it felt... ...he was looking at Neeta. But now you have come, sir. It is good. The chemistry teacher should be handsome like you. Sir... actually, if every lecturer is as handsome as you... No girl will ever fail. - Exactly, sir. When some Professor or lecturer is sPoken about... ...one imagines a fifty year old dirty old man. You want to say something? Tell me. I cannot understand. SPeak loudly, tell me. That... What are you sPeaking about? Tell me! Your Pant's ziP is undone. Oh my God! Come on, quickly! Quickly. However, the exPerimental value of the... ...total strain in cycloblutane, this can... ...be only confirmed by the non Planar... ...of cycloblutane. Get to Page 81. You will find... Your ziP... You will find the same equation that is there. Right here. Listen to me. The one who doesn't want to study, can leave the class. And if nobody wants to study, the whole class can leave. See, you say anything. We have ragged him a lot. Now, let that Poor man go. Hey, did you look at that attitude? He is so haughty. He doesn't accePt his defeat even after so many occurances. Like that... are we lesser than him? Like that... he is more irritated because he is a bachelor. There are so many beautiful girls around him. But what can that Poor man do? He is a teacher after all. Is it? So, this is the matter. Then the decision should be made. He is very dashing. Actually, I can fall in love with him. Me, too. Wait. Put my Print out too. You come with me. Only you. Have a seat. It's okay. Sit! They will seem good. What, sir? You have moustaches. Sir, even my daddy had these long moustaches. Even I was scared when I was born. You like to laugh. Everyone likes to laugh, sir. I mean... laughing on others. You have researched on blood Pressure? I had seen it in the National GeograPhic channel Program. Your father has a lot of money, isn't it? I didn't understand, sir. The children of rich PeoPle don't... ...come to the college to study, but for time Pass. Sir, are you a communist? - Shut uP! Don't think that these hands are... ...just for changing the Pages of a book... ...or for writing over a black board. If I slaP you once, the geograPhy... ...of the whole face will become national. Remember this before committing any Prank. Get out! What haPPened, Pooja? Why did he call me? Why did he call me? Do you know? What did Suraj sir, I mean our new chemistry... ...Professor tell me? - What did he say? He said... Pooja, Please don't look at my face... ...in the class with these lake like eyes. My mind drowns in your eyes. Your eyes are so beautiful. Come on, he cannot say like this at all. Is that the case? Listen to what haPPened further. This is nothing. He said that... Whenever I see you... Something haPPens to me. I stared at him. He was scared. And do you what he said? He said that your waist moves like a serPent's tail. Your gait is like a doe. They are so rosy... and these liPs... what is it called? Like Petals... Yes, just like Petals. Listening to such Praise, instead... ...of scolding him, I was embarrassed. Is it? Are you telling us the dialogues of some film? Our Suraj sir cannot say such film dialogues. Don't you PeoPle believe me? No. Okay. If I embrace your Suraj sir one day... Embrace... You will believe me then, isn't it? Embrace? Yes, embrace. Because now... the love war has started. We aren't lesser than anyone... The girls of today... Our heartbeats have some new yearnings. We aren't lesser than anyone... The girls of today... Our heartbeats have some new yearnings. You won't see a wandering beauty like us ever... We are moving ahead, the whole world is following us. 'Goggles on the eyes like the scattered Petals. We are a wonder of nature. We have a new attitude. There are new intoxications. You won't see a wandering beauty like us ever... We are moving ahead, the whole world is following us. We didn't find any boy... Looking at whom, I could lose my heart. How will he make me year? Where will he go to? You won't see a wandering beauty like us ever... We are moving ahead, the whole world is following us. We aren't lesser than anyone... The girls of today... Our heartbeats have some new yearnings. You won't see a wandering beauty like us ever... We are moving ahead, the whole world is following us. We massage her after the bath. This is going on since ten days. Suraj... you were to come tomorrow? SurPiya was so worried. She said that Suraj must have come... ...even if there was a little sound. She didn't sleeP all night and didn't let me sleeP too. I was stuck uP somewhere yesterday. I had made her understand, but you know SuPriya. Tell me, how is the college going on? The college is going on fine. Greetings. It seems that you have come right now. The bath has had a lot of effect. Did you look at SurPiya? Her face has cleared off too. And if the almighty wishes... SuPriya will be all right. You are here now, isn't it? - Yes. - Okay. Suraj, when you are here, SuPriya has a strange strength. But when you aren't there, she becomes sad. Sometimes, she accePts defeat. She tells me to take her back home. As it is, I think that we are trying uselessly. What are you talking about? Why will SuPriya not be all right? Everything will be all right. Didn't you hear what the Priest said? I want to see SuPriya moving again like before. And I will do it. Suraj... Suraj... do you know? I waited a lot for you yesterday. I couldn't come yesterday. It must be something imPortant. Or else, whatever the time, you would have come. You told PaPa to take you back home? Yes. It is so many days here now. This Place seems to be a Prison now. When you were there before, I didn't feel it. Now, how long can you stay here? You have a new job. I am bored here. Therefore, I told PaPa. I have brought the books you told me to. You won't be bored now. Look at this. YashPal's Fake Truth. I had to try a lot to get it. I got your letter day before yesterday. The first day in college was very exciting? The girls of the college are not like you. They are really sPicy chillies. That is good. You like sPicy chillies. I miss you a lot. I will not wait for weekends now. I will come in between on a leave too. No. This isn't needed. If you write two letters in a week, it is all right. It is a new job and a new college. I wish that you should be called... ...the best lecturer in that college. Didn't I tell you? Kiran and Sarita... who were learning dance with me? Yes. Both of them had come to meet me yesterday. They started crying looking at me like this. The Poor girls. Suraj... I will never be able to walk now, isn't it? Why won't you not be able to? Our trials will be successful. Even the Priest said that you will be cured. Brace yourself. Do you not believe in our love? You will be able to walk. Don't even think such after today. Suraj... where do you disaPPear every weekend? Saturdays and Sundays are for Parties. And you disaPPear on that day? We will have Parties too, dildarbhai. Just Pray that the day comes soon. What is the matter? You seem worried. Is everything all right? Everything will be all right. Anything serious? Nothing sPecial. See, Suraj. I haven't just accePted... ...you as my friend, but as a younger brother. And as an elder brother, I have a right to know your troubles. Do you remember? You sPoke about my marriage once? The girl whom I wish to marry... she has brain tumor. And because of that, she has a Paralysis attack. She is on the bed since three years. And nowadays... She is being cured in an ayurvedic hosPital. I go to meet her every Saturday. With the hoPe that she will be cured one day. Very sorry about it. - It's okay. Looking at the rose flower here... ...you must have understood the meaning of it being here. This is the first gift of my first love. If you keeP this with you. I will understand that you accePt my love. And you have accePted me. And if you tramPle this rose and throw it away... ...I will think that you love me immensely. Your neighbour... ramdulari. Sir, you... You here? It is our fortune that you came to our house. We look at you sometimes and our house sometimes. Not house, the house of sParrows. Sir, you have a real good sense of humor. Shall I call Pooja? She is at home. No. I wanted to meet you. - Me? Do you know how to make a Paste? Paste? I am a master in making Pastes. Chicken Pastes, coriander Pastes... Pudina Paste, chilly Paste, tell me. What do you like? A rose Paste. Take this. Make a Paste of this. And sPice uP ProPerly. Then make the sParrows of this house eat it. The rose Paste for the sParrows of the bird house? My dear friends... There are being divorces all over the world... There are divorces before marriage in many Places. Today me. And my dear wife... are celebrating the tenth anniversary of our marriage. Which is actually a very joyous occasion. APPlause. Right sir, comPletely right, sir! Sir, you didn't let any third Person come between both. Therefore, this anniversary is more imPortant. Congratulations, sir. - Thank you. Thank you. Congratulations, madam. Good evening, sir. What was the need of calling these... ...mischievous fools here? - What was the need of calling them? They aren't guests. They are gate crashers. And in the haPPiness of this achievement... ...I wish to have all of you listen to my favourite song. Song... aPPlause... aPPlause... Suraj sir. Why are you so serious? Why don't you claP too? I will sing now, Suraj... Sometimes... my heart thinks... ' That... Wow... aPPlause... aPPlause... Once more... Sometimes... my heart thinks... ' Wow... aPPlause... aPPlause... There is a demand. Sometimes... my heart thinks... ' Once more... Hey, let me sing ahead. Sir, sing this line ProPerly. Then, you are welcome to sing further. Okay... Enough of the songs. We will have the food now. Do you think that anyone will digest... ...their food after your singing? This is how I have sPent ten years of marriage. Come on. Here you are, Mr. Siddu. That's enough. Madam. See there. We will manage. - Okay. What dish is this? This is the Paste of rose flowers, sir. Rose flower Paste? I didn't get it? Kulwanta... did you make it just for them? No, actually sir... Suraj sir is a bit warm blooded. So this Paste is the best to cool his warm blood. Yes, she is right. I won't eat it. The Paste seems good. I will taste. Do you know, dildar? We eat food every day. But we don't know which food is good for what. Just like these Pulses. This has oil, ginger, ghee and water. It is an excellent thing. What are you saying? Will mad PeoPle eat it? No. It isn't eaten. It is Put on the head of some mad Person like this. Very good. Very good. She makes fun of everyone! Hello. Suraj. There is good news. I don't know how to tell it to you. SuPriya has started to walk. - Really? Yes, Suraj. She is walking without suPPort after three years today. Now, you walk alone. No... I will not be able to walk alone. I don't have that strength now. Try at least. I will fall. Don't you believe in me? My heart is asking for this, beloved... My heart is asking for this, beloved... Our love should always be kePt alive. Whether we exist here or not.

He did PrePare the food, isn't it? Yummy... The reciPe of bitter gourds... You didn't eat the food till now? I am eating. I am very hungry. Hey, why are you so silent? Say something. You mean... You have forgotten Suraj sir's scolding? Oh... what was there to remember in it? Why don't you clarify that you accePted defeat? How does the question of defeat or victory arise? I committed a Prank. I was caught. Okay. That is all right. But he shouldn't have insulted you in everyone's Presence. Insult? No. A real man should be like this. Sir seemed so handsome in anger. What? Yes. His nose was beet red in anger. And his face was shining like silver. What? Pooja... What has haPPened to you? For the first time, you are laying... ...down your weaPons to an enemy? And that too such a enemy... Who has Put you down so many times. Did your adamance and anger flow with your tears? Did you surrender to your Personality? I don't know. I don't know anything. Ask the bottom of your heart and tell me... are you falling in love with him? Have you started to fall in love with him? I think so... Sir... Sir... I have come to bid you farewell. I am going to my father's house. As it is, what is the use of staying here? I think that I should leave right now. Go to your class. What? That means you didn't comPlain against me to the PrinciPal? Sir. I knew that you wouldn't comPlain against me. Because... You like me. Who said that I like you? You like me, therefore you scolded me. Sir, there are 1633 girls in this college. You never scolded them. This means that there is something in me... ...that they don't have. I know... that you take better care of me. Ramdulari liked your scolds, sir. Very good. Because... Because... ramdulari loves you! Ramdulari loves you! Ramdulari loves you! How are you? - I'm fine, auntie. I'll recover soon. Look, I'm walking. All the Plants have grown so big! Child, the wind is blowing. You better go in. - PaPa, I've come after so many days. Let me see them contently. PaPa is right. See them afterwards. C'mon. What haPPened? What are you thinking? Nothing. Just about you. Just let me see the eyes that always twinkle with a hoPe. The ones that weren't able to sleeP... ...for the Past 3 years in my worry. You had to go through a lot because me, isn't it, Suraj? SuPriya... Tell me the truth, Suraj... am I a burden for you? The lashes aren't a burden for the eyes. Didn't you yourself write this line in one of you Poetries? Recite the whole Poetry for me. Don't remind me all that. I'm Pained at that. Why, SuPriya? Moreover, you've stoPPed writing Poems? Everything has stoPPed. No, SuPriya. Nothing has stoPPed. You start writing the Poems again... ...and I'm here to Put them on PaPer. What are you looking at? Just foreseeing the hall full of PeoPle... ...and you dancing on the stage... ...and the reverberations of aPPlaud... ...and myself standing in some remote corner all alone. Since when have you started dreaming in day? What else do lovers do? Just keeP on dreaming, isn't it? Moreover, I don't have anything else to do. You'll become a big star. And, I'll become a star secretary. You'll sign the autograPhs. And, I'll count the money. Really? Had you really wanted to do secretary-shiP... ...then why did you study such heavy chemistry books? That's because I could get a gold medal... ...and for you to get imPressed and fall for me. I'm not imPressed with you. That means you don't love me? Love? Not at all. Stars don't fall in love with lesser beings. I'll fall in love with some rich Nrl (Non resident Indian). And, then I'll fly away abroad after marrying him. What will you do then? What will I do? I was in love with you, I'm in love with you... ...and I'll always love you. Even if you leave me and go... ...I would still hold no resentment against you. I'll sPend my whole life in your memory. Hey... Stars don't cry. SuPriya... ...don't cry. You'll start dancing again. The aPPlause will again be there. Everything will be alright. Now, take some rest. I've to go. Can't you wait till the holidays get over? No, SuPriya. Day after tomorrow, it's the last day... ...of returning the examination PaPer. I'll have to go. Give it. You take rest. I'll be back by next Saturday. Take the medicines on time. And, do exercises on time. And, no more crying. Promise? - Promise. Love you. Sister, Pooja! Sister, Pooja! - What is it?! Sister, after so much of struggle... ...l've bagged a big role in a small film. So, let me go! - No. Sister! See, the college has shut down. And, the holidays have started. And, all your stooges have gone to their natives'. So, what's the Problem now? The Problem is, I can't stay alone in such a big house! Alone? How come alone? You too are going to meet your daddy! I'm not going anywhere! And, you too aren't going anywhere! Did you get that?! No! And for now, you're not at all going anywhere! We've to give him comPany, isn't it? Oooh! Hey! We've the keys of sir's house, right? Go, get them fast! C'mon, stuPid! Move! Move! Greetings, sir! Here. Sir! Sir! Sir! Your keys are with me! Where's dildar? - He has gone to his in-law's Place. I mean to his wife's house. And, didn't you go to your house? - House? I'm yet to settle down with a house, sir. Sir, wherever you went; is everything alright there? Yes. It's just that a crow turned into a swan. A cow started sPeaking in English. And, money is growing on some trees. - Really?! Is it haPPening now at your Place?! Well, it haPPened much ago at ours. Why not? Won't that all haPPen at a Place... ...wherein a sPeculate like you is born? And, if it doesn't; then this might itself be a wonder. You're so right, sir! Ram dulari said something that day... ...but she hasn't got the rePly yet. Ram dulari will get her rePly. - When!? At the right time. When shall that time come, sir!? Very soon. That means till then ram dulari will have to wait for you? Fine. I'll certainly wait. Because, I'm already crazy about you! The sPring arrives and the Partridge sings. The clouds sPread and the Peacock dances. But, when shall your eyes get... ...locked with mine? Your love made my heart go crazy. Your consent made my heart go crazy. But, where has it been lost? Just tell me that! Your love made my heart go crazy. Your consent made my heart go crazy. But, where has it been lost? Just tell me that! Your love has... Our eyes sleeP at times and keeP waking at some. I'm enjoying that. Our breaths are slow at times and are fast at some. A magic is sPreading fast. Nowhere can I find Peace. Don't chastise me as such. Your love has... Slow and steady; you stole my sleeP. You're at fault for that. The world seems to be deserted without you. I'm very much aware of that. It's the magic of love. Pray so that it never diminishes. Your love made my heart go crazy. Your consent made my heart go crazy. But, where has it been lost? Just tell me that! Your love has... Sir, you!? It was good. - What, sir? Last night's song. - Thank you, sir! But, after hearing that song; I really felt... ...that I'm doing wrong with you. A sort of feeling has develoPed for you in my heart. A soft corner, you see. Is it true, sir!? I can't believe this! I went for the shoPPing and I just thought of you. So, I bought this. Is this for me, sir!? I thought of starting our friendshiP with a gift. Sir, I cannot tell you; how haPPy I'm! I'm so haPPy! No. After I go. One more thing... This is not just a gift. It's a mirror. And, you can see in it; how I visualise you. Did ram dulari like the gift? What do you think of; am I a kid?! So as to Play with a toy?! What's there to think about it? You certainly are. I visualise you in the same way. Now, go and Play. What?! I'm not a kid! I'm a girl! I'm a grown uP girl! StuPid girl! Do you know what you did?! These are university exam's PaPers! They are the future of so many students! Now, get out of here! Get out! Even my dad never raised a hand on me! And you... - Yes, I slaPPed you! I slaPPed you! Do whatever you want! Is it a crime to fall in love?! If that's the case then I've committed a crime! Go and file an Flr (First Information rePort)! Go! Send me to the gallows! But, you did a good thing! You hit me and brought gave way to my resolve! But, keeP it in mind! The same hands will feel these cheeks affectionately some day. And, if that doesn't haPPen... ...then I shall no longer be the daughter of deePraj Khanna! What will you do, huh?! What will you do?! You'll hit me?! Then, hit me! But, remember on thing... ...that I love you! I love you! And, it's a true love! Did you get that?! I love you! I love you! Your love made my heart go crazy. Your consent made my heart go crazy. Your love made my heart go crazy. Your consent made my heart go crazy. Your love made my heart go crazy. Be seated. Be seated. Sit. Sit down. Don't worry. Today, I've not come to fight with you. Actually... it's not wrong to love anybody. It's not a crime. But, PerhaPs... ...your manner was wrong. And, the Place as well. Let's do one thing... ...why don't we go for a Picnic on this weekend? Where should we go, sir? That's a surPrise. But, you all stay PrePared. Okay, Pooja? I mean... ram dulari. Bye. SurPrise number one. This house wherein Suraj chauhan started dreaming. SurPrise number two. My uncle. But, more than my father. He and my father were best friends. Both ruled the share market. One day all of a sudden... ...the share market crashed. And, my father couldn't bear the shock. After his demise; my mother also died after some days. Since then he brought me uP. PaPa, these are some students of my college. They wanted to meet you. - Greetings! Greetings. He's your future father in law. Seek his blessings. - Yeah! Hey! Hey! What... what are you doing? She resPects elders a lot. Whenever she some elder; she right away seeks their blessings. Such cultured girls still exist in today's world. You still haven't understood my students ProPerly, PaPa. Your students must be definitely like you. I'm going out for some imPortant work. You take them in. - Fine, PaPa. SuPriya is also in. Wow! You've come here walking? Yes. These are those hot chillies. The ones I talked about. Okay. This one is their leader. Ram dulari. Alias Pooja. And, Pooja... she's surPrise number 3. SuPriya Maheshwari. PaPa's daughter... and my fiance. My love... and my life. She's suffering from Paralysis since Past three years. The doctors say that she'll recover very soon. And, look... she has come here walking. C'mon, girls. See, how I did the break! Just like Pooja's love. Even her heart is shattered and scattered like these coins. The fault is Pooja's. She shouldn't have fallen in love with Suraj sir. The fault lies in the college management. What was the need to emPloy a young lecturer in a girls' college? Isn't it, Pooja? - Shut uP! Here. - Wow! Snacks! - Wow! - Snacks! So, are you all enjoying? - Yes, sir. You too take. What's uP, ram dulari? You aren't Playing carom? What's the matter, Suraj? Ever since she has come, she seems to be uPset. What's the matter, Pooja? Nothing. It's just a headache. Today, she's having an headache... ...but all the while she gives us headache. You PeoPle Play with the carom, and not with me! Okay?! Okay. Wait! Wait! Wait! Let me Put this queen. I'll helP you in that. No, no. I don't need your helP in this. Forgot? It's me who always wins in carom. But, I always have the queen. I let you have it PurPosely. Since, I've the real queen, then why do I need any other queen? Isn't it, girls? - Yes, sir! Ram dulari... You Play... I'll see to it. Pooja, don't be silly. Come. Come with me. Pooja, whatever haPPened so far, was just fun. It was a Prank. At least I took it that way. These words are aPt in the class room! I brought you here PurPortedly. So that after seeing the whole truth... ...you'll think of me in a Positive light. I'm not that fool, the way you're thinking of me! Look... if you still have anything in mind about me... ...then Please chuck that out. After going from here... you'll be my best friend... ...and you'll be my best student. C'mon. Cheer uP. There's a function in the village. We'll all go there. Okay? Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! The stranger has come! He has brought along the message of love. Stranger! The stranger has come! A message of love he has brought along. My heart's Pounding! Better take care of me! Better take care of me! Stranger! The stranger has come! A message of love he has brought along. My heart's Pounding! Better take care of me! Better take care of me! I stayed away from you, O' dear. Don't ask how I sPent those days. Even I thought of you all the time. It was your dream all the while in my eyes. These bangles jingle and tell me. I won't be able to bear the seParation anymore. Stranger! The stranger has come! A message of love he has brought along. Stranger! The stranger has come! A message of love he has brought along. My heart's Pounding! Better take care of me! Better take care of me! KeeP your Promise since you've made it. And, don't you ever try to forget me. Don't go away after coming so close. And, never hurt my heart. I'll enter in your breath like a fragrance. And, I'll fill you with my love. Stranger! The stranger has come! A message of love he has brought along. My heart's Pounding! Better take care of me! Better take care of me! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! The stranger has come! My heart's Pounding! Better take care of me! Better take care of me! Better take care of me! Sister Pooja, you're alone? What' the matter? Where are your useless friends? What haPPened? Did you start another riot or what? What haPPened to you? What are you doing? Listen, sister! Sister! Sir! Sir, that Pooja... Sir, she went to her house in Poona all of a sudden this morning. And, sir, she'll never return. Sir, it seems she has left the college. We tried to convince her a lot, but... Sir, we even told her to meet you once, before going... ...but she didn't listen. She has left a letter for you. 'Thanks for the surPrises! ' 'You found of a great way to humiliate me... '... and insult me in front of all! ' 'I should really admit! ' 'You made a great Plan! ' 'You're a sadist! ' 'I hate you! ' 'Good bye! ' Pooja... ...where did you went yesterday all of a sudden? Ever since you went away, I was thinking about it. Did I do anything wrong? At least you should have informed before going. Even your friends didn't knew anything. They were also worried. Have you come alone? Come. Don't you have a class? Have a seat. Suraj always says that... ...sometimes you behave strangely. Is it necessary for someone's behaviour to be constant? What more does he say? No. He doesn't say that in a comPlaining tone. You have a seat... I'll get some soft drink for you. I don't want anything! What's the matter, Pooja? You seem to be tense. I've left the college! Left the college? Yes! I can't tolerate anyone Passing taunts at me! Hence, I cannot study in that college anymore! I can't face my friends! And, all this haPPened because of you! Me? - Yes, you! How could I've known that someone... ...was waiting for Suraj sir in here?! What's my fault?! I really don't know how I fell in love with Suraj sir during all that fun! Tell me, what should I do now?! I can't forget him! Because no girl can ever forget her first love! Pooja, stoP! Does Suraj know this? - Yes, he knows. But, he knowingly acts na.i. Ve. He symPathises with you. The way a Patient is treated. He's being comPassionate with you. Because, you are Physically challenged. You're a handicaP! Even Suraj sir loves me! And, I'm aware of that! But, he's helPless. Because he's burdened with your resPonsibility. And, all his feelings are suPPressed under that burden! After all, what can you give him?! Tears?! Sorrow! Misery?! Can you ever give him any Pleasure?! Can you ever give him a haPPy family life?! Can you give him a child?! You can never give! Suraj sir will have to live a miserable life! You're destroying his life for your own gluttony! You're selfish! Selfish! What haPPened, PaPa? PaPa, why don't you say something? PaPa... dear, you're still not ready? I exPlained you so much yesterday, yet... come, come. Change your clothes. We've to go. No, dad. You go. I won't go. Don't be insistent, dear. It will take a whole week for me to return from delhi. You'll get bored here alone. Where am I alone? Lmaan uncle's there. Radhey's there. Pinto's there. Pooja, Pooja... try and understand, dear. I've to catch the flight after droPPing you to the college. C'mon. No, dad. And, don't force me. I'm really not coming. Daddy, Please! - I told you, no more movies! No more fun! No more Pig-headedness! C'mon, now. I won't come. I said no. Fine. Don't go. But, have you ever thought; had your mama been alive... ...how Pained she would have been after seeing all this? Had mama been alive... ...then she would have understood my feelings. Oh. Fine. By the way, Pooja, who told you to fall in love... ...with your college lecturer? You made the selection. But, I'm going through the tension. Daddy... - No, really. Well, that man has gained resPect in my eyes... ...since he has turned down my daughter's love. He might be having a great will Power. I actually want to meet him. Daddy, Please, daddy! Hey! You've started crying! C'mon, buddy. I had thought that deePraj Khanna's daughter... ...has loads of courage and guts. Hey, c'mon now! If you hide your face like this after getting defeated... ...then it will be really shameful for me. Be bold. If he doesn't want your love; then you too shouldn't need his love! Face your friends boldly! You yourself use to say that you're your college's hero. I mean heroine. Whatever! So, are heroes like this? For the sake of a silly romance... It's not a silly romance, daddy! Look, Pooja... ...we're not just father and daughter, but friends. We discuss everything, correct? So then listen to me and get ready. This is not a father's request, but a friend's. Please! Should I droP you to the classroom? - No, dad. You go. I'm alright, dad. I'm Perfectly alright. And, from today on; you won't hear any comPlaints. Okay. I know. Go. - Bye. Pooja! Hey, guys! What haPPened? Why do you all look so terrible? Of course you'll look terrible, since I wasn't here. But, right now I'm back. So, cheer uP. Hey, Print-out, are you still on with your letter writing? Pooja... it's good that you came. We were all missing you a lot. I knew it. You'll go astray without me. Hence, I've come back! You've come now? Yes. Daddy has also come along. He has gone to meet Suraj sir. You didn't go to meet her? No. For that I've to collect some guts. Though I've done a great rehearsal. Actually, Pooja, we were thinking to call you... Miss SuPriya, has suffered a very serious attack. And, the doctors say that's the chances of her survival are bleak. The day you went; we got a call the same day. The reason of attack was some mental shock. The Poor soul... she was so nice. Suraj sir is very uPset. He's really very unfortunate. And, then... ...she was dePrived of the motherly love. That's why she's a bit stubborn. But, she's not bad at heart. I know that. Whatever she did with you... she told me everything about that. The thing that she did with you... I aPologise to you for that. There's still a child in her. So, don't feel bad about it. No, no. It's not like that. Didn't Pooja come? - She has come. She has gone directly to the classroom. Actually, she was unable to collect the guts to face you. Excuse me, I've to go. Okay, see you then. We shall meet someday freely. - Sure. See you. - Bye. How are you? I'm alright, sir. I just met your daddy. You did right by coming back. Practicals, right? C'mon. Sir... That... Nothing. What haPPened, PaPa? You're here all of a sudden? Son, SuPriya has... What haPPened to SuPriya? She has stoPPed taking medicines. I exPlained her a lot. Even the doctors tried exPlaining. But, she isn't ready to listen to anybody. Just says... that she doesn't want to live. I really don't know what should I do? I've come to you since she never refuses you. Do you really think that medicines will helP me? Yes, I do feel. The Lord is very much with us. The same thing haPPened earlier. Didn't you come back after recovering? Have courage. You'll recover yet again. Take the medicines. PaPa... I want to talk to Suraj in Private. You love me? You love me a lot, isn't it? Do you think my love for you has lessened? No. I think that you love me more than before. That's why... I'm unable to bear now. Look... you love me so much... ...and I cannot even reciProcate your love. Should I tell you something, Suraj? Will you listen to me? Suraj, you marry someone else. No matter if I live or die. But, if you get married, then I won't be worried that... ...I would leaving you alone. SuPriya, enough. Do you figure out that I love you... ...since I want something from you? Is marriage everything? Pooja is a very nice girl. She came that day. I really felt the day she came here. She'll take good care of you. SuPriya, stoP it. Suraj, let me sPeak today. I've told PaPa everything. He'll talk to Pooja's daddy. But, SuPriya... - don't say no! Please! Just think this as your SuPriya's last wish. And, fulfil it. Get married to Pooja. SuPriya, don't Punish me like this. Don't insult my love like this. I've truly loved you. After all, what's short in my love... ...so as you're sPeaking like this? Every dream doesn't come true, isn't it? Some dreams shatter, the moment the eyes oPen. Our love is a similar dream. Forget me! Forget you? Fine. First you forget me. Can you forget my love? RePly me. Suraj, stoP. PaPa... PaPa... can you give me that? Suraj... Please take it. Do you remember this sari? You brought this for the girl who was... ...suPPosed to become your bride. I don't need it now. I'm returning it today. I'm breaking off my engagement with you! Daddy... you've come here all of a sudden? Come. I'll tell you. Yesterday he came home. At first I was angered at what he said. I was about to say him 'Get out.' But, gradually I felt after giving it a thought... ...that he's indeed right. After all I'm also a daughter's father. And, every father wants to fulfil every wish of his daughter. And, if that wish is the last one... ...then one fulfils it even with his own life. What's the matter, daddy? Suraj, waited for SuPriya till now. But, now... There's no meaning to that waiting, and everybody knows that. Suraj as well. The care that SuPriya's father takes of her... ...he also has the same affection for Suraj as well. Since, he has brought uP Suraj... ...ever since he was a child. So, to settle down his family and to get him married... ...is also one among his resPonsibilities. That's why he wants that you get married to Suraj. Daddy?! No, I haven't rePlied yet. Even though I could have told that... ...my daughter is young, she's studying... ...and she has to make her career, etc, etc. But, I didn't say all that to him. Because, maybe it was all during fun... ...and aProPos, you indeed loved Suraj. That's why. That's why I've Promised him that if... ...my daughter still holds the same feelings... ...then I'm not going to come between those feelings. Now... ...you've to make the decision. But, whatever decision you take... ...give it a thorough thought. Because I don't want any comPlications to arise in future. A man has to make much bigger comPromises in life. Look, Suraj... It's not the question of you getting married to Pooja. The question is of SuPriya's life. Look, listen to SuPriya and get married to Pooja... ...then PerhaPs she can start taking the medicines... ...and her life might come on the right track. Moreover, Suraj... ...Pooja also loves you. That's not love, but infatuation. That's stubbornness! An adolescent obsession! It's not Possible, dildar, that... - You want... ...SuPriya to die with her last wish unfulfilled? But... - Look, Suraj, I'm your friend. I seek your better. But, I can only give you suggestions. Look, Suraj, whatever you do; think a lot before that. Because on one hand it's a question of two lives... ...and on the other it's a question of two deaths. Never did I think before this decision. No decePtion is as big as a beautiful dream. Be it the moments of joy. Or be it the shadows of grief. One has to still live even though with a shattered heart. Never did I think before this decision. No decePtion is as big as a beautiful dream. The desire of the heart was left unfulfilled. And, now it's a Passage through difficult times. The waves took away all that was mine. So, what's left there with the shore? One doesn't get what he wants in love. And, in sPite of the ocean the thirst is unquenched. Never did I think before this decision. No decePtion is as big as a beautiful dream. One gets what he's destined to get. One loses what he's destined to lose. No matter one makes any effort. Destiny shall always Prevail. Why does time make one suffer in love? And, why does it caress after all that at other times? Never did I think before this decision. No decePtion is as big as a beautiful dream. Be it the moments of joy. Or be it the shadows of grief. One has to still live even though with a shattered heart. Be it the moments of joy. Or be it the shadows of grief. One has to still live even though with a shattered heart. Sit. So far whatever haPPened... whether good or bad... ...we'll try to forget it. You know everything. Whether anything is true or not... ...but, it's certainly true... that we're husband and wife. I'll try to be a good husband. But, it will definitely take some time. Go to sleeP. Take some more. - No, no. It's enough. Why? Didn't you like the breakfast? I liked it very much. Bye. Hi, Pooja! - DeePa, you! Pooja, how are you? - I'm fine. C'mon, let's go in. Tell me, is everything alright? But, I'm very annoyed with you. I went to meet my Parents during the vacation... ...and meanwhile you got married? But, whatever one says. You indeed acquired the one you loved. Suraj sir had to bow before your love. Isn't it? Pooja, tell me one thing... How's sister SuPriya? Is she still on the bed or is there any imProvement. Whatever you say... but, you did wrong with her. You got what you wanted. But, she... The Poor soul. Hey, Pooja! What are you doing? When did you come? Suraj has also come? You're looking beautiful in the sari. Are you alright? I want to rePent! The thing that I did with you... I want to rePent for that! I'm unable to bear it anymore! What are you talking about, Pooja? Why didn't you curse me? Why didn't you curse me? I can't live with the burden of your tears on me! You've done nothing like that... ...so as there should be a burden on you. Matches are made in heaven, Pooja. No, SuPriya madam. I'm resPonsible for this condition of yours. Just me. I was fighting my own shadow just for the sake of my resolve... ...and it's now that I've come to know about it! And, now when Suraj sir has started loving me as a wife... ...and since now I'm getting his love... ...I feel that I don't have any right on that love! Because I've snatched it! I've started feeling that I've committed some theft! I've committed a sin! Silly girl... you're getting Suraj's love... ...in fact you should be haPPy about it. You should ever stay haPPy and... ...I Pray for the same to the Lord. And, my blessings will be with you. Till my last breath. PaPa, do you recognise her? She's our Pooja. Suraj's wife. I've seen her coming! And, the moment I saw her, I got the feeling... ...that she's again uP to something! She has stePPed into this house once before! And, I and my daughter are still reaPing the fruits of that visit! Till today! Aren't you contented even after doing all this?! Yet again you're here to... - PaPa! What are you talking about? Do you know whom you're talking to? I know that! But, what should I do?! There's this Pain within! I've gone through a lot! I've suffered a lot! I kePt mum a lot! But, I won't stay quiet anymore! I wanted to tell Suraj the same day... ...but my daughter barred me from doing so... ...that none should know about it. PaPa! - See! See at my daughter's condition! See! - PaPa! Before I lose control of myself, just go away from here! Don't ever come back here! Never show your evil face here! What's the matter, PaPa? No... It's nothing... like that. No. There's something that you PeoPle are hiding from me. What is the matter? SuPriya... ...you tell me. No, Suraj. There's nothing like that. I'll tell you. Pooja, no! - You should know what haPPened! My husband should know as to what I did! SuPriya madam suffered this stroke because of me! No, Pooja! No! All haPPened because of me! I told her that you don't love her but symPathise with her! I said that she's selfish! I called her selfish! I told her that she's ruining your life... ...for the sake of her selfish goals! I called her handicaP! I called her Physically challenged! And, I also said that she can... ...never give you a haPPy married life! And, child... You did well. You really did well. SuPriya, strangled her own love... ...for the sake of Suraj's haPPiness! The father melted in the daughter's tears... ...and concealed the truth. It's just that Suraj is a fool! I couldn't understand! I couldn't understand anything! SuPriya... what was the need to give such a big sacrifice? I don't deserve this. For once... just for once... StoP your tears. Don't ever show me your face! Your tears are venom for me! You'll weeP for your whole life... ...still you won't get an absolution. Wait and see... ...your own conscience will Punish you someday. Don't ever show me your face! Your tears are venom for me! Your tears are venom for me! Where are we going? Dildar, where are we going? Just... the destination is about to arrive. This road goes to her house, isn't it? StoP the car. Dildar, I say stoP the car! Look... ...the car will stoP... ...wherein it has to stoP. Yesterday, dildar called uP and said that you're back. But, I wasn't sure that you'll come here. I'm very haPPy. Come. Dildar... move the car. I don't want to meet anyone here! Move the car! Please! Vent the ire on me if you really want to. It's me and my daughter who did a wrong thing. Come. Let go my hand. Suraj, I don't want anything. Since you've come here... Please come in for once. Please, Suraj. Come, Suraj. Suraj, come. Sit. If you're about to call your daughter... ...then better don't do it. She won't come even if I or you call her. The one who calls everybody near him... ...has taken her away. Four years ago... ...on the night of 'deePavali'... ...she left us all. Not to come ever. Whenever there are mishaPs in life... ...we often seek the suPPort of this one word. 'Wait.' All the PeoPle who came to meet me... ...said the same thing... that it was destiny. But... But, that wasn't destiny. Rather she felt that she has committed a sin. And, she Punished herself for that sin. For a whole day and whole night... ...I 'waited' with her dead body in my laP... ...in the thought that you'll come. In sPite of knowing very well that you won't come. In sPite of knowing very well that you won't come. An adolescent obsession! Did my daughter commit any sin other than this? No, I'm... I'm not justifying her. But, you should know all this. That day after you went away... ...when my daughter returned... ...she was like a living dead! She stoPPed talking! I was dying to hear something from her! Then, she didn't even come out of her room! She never cried for once! The eyes... as if looking at something far off. I tried a lot to get her treated. I tried a lot! But, that was of no use! Then, one day the doctor said that she's exPecting a baby! But, even that didn't bring a smile on her face! As she was far away from life and death! And, in the same condition... she gave birth to a baby girl! Her condition was same even after the delivery. Then, one day I... ...I found something different in her. I felt as if... ...as if a dead body was resurrected! She called me 'daddy.' She hugged me and asked for you! And, she started to sob! Daddy, if ever he comes to meet our daughter some day... ...then do tell him that my tears are not venom! And... and do tell him... to forgive me! Will he forgive me? Why not, my child? I'll exPlain him. You go to sleeP! Go to sleeP, my child. Go. I thought that my daughter was back to normal... ...and I had a Peaceful sleeP that night. But... Pooja... Pooja, dear... Pooja! Pooja! If death is the ultimate Punishment for a sin... ...then at least forgive my daughter now, Suraj! My... ...where's my daughter? Come. Who are you? PaPa. Your PaPa! Mummy! Mummy! - Pooja... Pooja. I call her Pooja. Ever since I've got her... I've recovered all by myself. Neither I took any medicines, nor did any exercises. I just recovered myself. Maybe, because... I wanted to her to call me 'mother.' And, she must have definitely fought a lot with the Lord for my life. I don't understand anything. Should I cry... or laugh? There are some things that we lose in our life... ...but there are things that we get with a sudden stroke. And, at a time when we don't even exPect that. Go. And, shower your affection on your daughter Pooja. Your soul shall be relieved of the burden. Go.
