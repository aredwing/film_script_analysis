 

                        Stay in line, bastards. Keep in line, man. Keep in line. What are you looking at me like that for, you fuck? What are you looking at? I'll fuck you up! Move! You men make sure that's tied down properly, you hear me? Careful, man! -Pa, why is it taking so long? -Go back to your mother! Move your feet, move your feet, come on! I said, go back! Sergeant Gregory, Dannie Bosman, your skipper for the crossing. -Your first time to Robben lsland? -I hear the fishing is excellent. You'll get bored with that soon enough. -What prison are you from? -Kroonstad Maximum Security. Well, Robben lsland is a totally different ball game. All prisoners below deck and secured, Captain! Ladies and children, all aboard please! -Where's your mom? -Busy putting on her lipstick. We can board now, sweetie. -How do I look? -You look great. -As long as I don't get seasick. -It's only an hour. Will I be able to get my own bedroom, Pa? Of course, you will. 'Cause I don't want to share with Natasha again. Who said I want to share with you? You two stop fighting and behave yourselves. Remember, first impressions are everything. Are all the prisoners on the island Black, Pa? All of them. But at Kroonstad, they were White. We don't mix Whites and Blacks, not even in the prisons. These are not just criminals, Brent, these are terrorists. But what's the difference? Terrorists are terrible people. They want to kill all the Whites and take our land away from us. Which is why we lock them up on the island. Sergeant Gregory? Captain Devett. I'm the personnel officer on the island. How do you do, Captain? I'm Gloria and these are... I have a jeep standing by. This way. Your furniture will follow. One, two. All aboard, Captain. This is it. You can stand down for today, Sergeant. This evening you're expected to attend an officers' braai at the OC's residence, missus included. Full dress uniform. Gloria, I can't find my step-outs! Ma is visiting next door, Pa. Why is the toilet outside, Pa? These houses are old, boet. They were built during the war. -What war? -Second World War. -What happens if I need to go at night? -Then you'll go. But there are bad people out there. Boy, the only bad people on this island are locked up in jail. Okay? Okay, Pa. -James, are you decent? -Ya. Why? Excuse all the boxes, but you know how it is. This is my husband, James. -How do you do? -How do you do? Sannie's kindly offered to baby-sit for us. Oh, that's very nice. Oh, Sannie's husband is head chef here. So if you ever need anything, eggs, flour, sugar, you know who to ask. Just don't say where it came from. -I can't find my step-outs. -Under the bed. I polished them. -And you, James? What's your posting? -Oh, he doesn't know yet. We'll probably find out this evening. You must be something special 'cause the NCOs are never invited to the Colonel's house, not unless they're in deep trouble. -Serious? -We don't mix. The officers here are all bloody snobs. I've got dinner on the stove. Give me a shout when you're ready to go, Gloria. Right. Thanks, Sannie. Hell, I'm starting to get a bit nervous now. You get in with the officers and they'll nominate you for a commission. You have to be a warrant officer first, Gloria. This is not Worcester, James. This is not Kroonstad. This is Robben lsland, the number-one prison in the country. You play your cards right and, who knows, in five years, you could be at head office in Pretoria. Dream on. I think I'm going to give you a quick little haircut before we go. Oh, Christ, woman, you never stop! -Come on! -Never! You don't have to wait to go to the mainland. I'm a fully qualified hairdresser! -Really? -And I'm good. Highlights is what you need, a bit of flair, then you'll see the heads turning. Well, are we going to keep you busy, or what? This is no holiday camp, Sergeant. You got warders stuck out here for two weeks at a time. It's a recipe for alcohol abuse, for prostitution... Prostitution? We've got married NCOs pimping their wives out to single warders to supplementing their shitty salaries. I hope Captain Devett is not painting too bad a picture of us. -Welcome to the island, Gregory. -It's an honour to be here, sir. I see our wives are already making friends. Thank you for inviting us, sir. There's someone who wants to meet you. Excuse us, Captain. This is Major Piet Jordaan -from the Bureau of State Security. -Bye-bye. I believe you speak the Kaffir languages, Sergeant? -I speak Xhosa, sir. -Where'd you learn the language? I grew up on a cattle farm in the Transkei. When you've got no brothers to play with, you end up playing with the Kaffirs, sir. Shall we take a walk, Sergeant? So, what do you think of the judgement handed down in Mandela's trial? In my opinion, he should have got the rope, sir. Then we could have turned him into a martyr. Perhaps he's more use to us behind bars. It's a waste of taxpayers' money, is what I say. They all are. All Blacks? Certainly the ones who took up arms against us, the communists. -Mandela denies he's a communist. -Well, they're all liars, aren't they? You know, in the 1800s, this whole island was a leper colony. Nothing's really changed then. How do you feel about heading up the Censorship Office in B Section? Excuse my ignorance, sir, but what is B Section? That's where we keep Mandela and all his mates. I need someone on the inside, someone who speaks their language. I want to know what they think, how they think. Anything you find odd in their letters or their visits, you report directly back to me. I want you to be my window into their soul, if they have a soul. Hell, and here I was thinking I was going to spend my first year working bloody night shifts. -You can if you want. -No. Please, no, sir. It would be an honour for me to run the Censorship Office. I won't let you down. You let me down, you let your country down. I would never do such a thing. Of course not. Well, I don't know about you, but I'm bloody starving. Let's go and get something to eat. -They asleep? -Finally. Too much bloody excitement. The Colonel's wife, Joyce, is coming over tomorrow for a cut. She bakes, so she'll pay with a cake. And Hettie, you know that nice captain's wife? Her husband dives for crayfish, so that's how she'll pay. -And that woman with the grey hair... -Gloria. What? They're putting me with Mandela and Sisulu and them. No? They want me in charge of the Censorship Office. My God, James! Why didn't you say something? I wasn't going to blow my trumpet in front of all those bloody officers. This is big, my boy! Mandela? Never mind that. I report directly to Pretoria. This is fantastic! Did they say anything about a promotion? In due course, I was told. No more Discipline Warder for me. From now on, I am in charge of the worst terrorist this country has ever seen. Do you know how many bridges he's blown up? Do you know how many police stations he and his Umkonto we Sizwe have bombed? Didn't I say this was going to be our island in the sun? -Didn't I say that, James? -You sure did, Booky. Put your backs into it, you lazy Kaffirs! Stand up, you slack bastards! Three days half rations for insubordination! Attention! I'm your new censorship officer. If you want to post a letter, you do it through me. One letter every six months, no longer than 500 words. No reference to other prisoners, no mention of prison conditions, and no bloody politics! If you fail to adhere to these regulations, your letters will not be posted! If you receive a letter, it comes through me. Same story, one every six months. Any mention of politics and that letter will be censored. Is that clear? You fuck with me and I'll make your life a lot more miserable than it already is. And I'll enjoy doing so! -Which one is Mandela? -He's in solitary. Five days for talking in the passage. Right! Back to work! Let's see you breaking some rocks! Last one on the right, it's nice and damp in there. Hey, you! I'm talking to you, man! Look at me! I'll see you, Mandela. Mrs Mandela. Sergeant Gregory. I'll be monitoring your visit. -How do you do, Sergeant? -Follow me. Vosloo, escort Prisoner 466/64 to Booth 3. Here please. You speak only in English and only about family matters. Prisoner ready. You have 30 minutes, starting now. -How are you, Madiba? -Compose yourself. We don't have much time. How are our daughters? They can't sleep at night, terrified the security will come and bash down our door. That is political, Mrs Mandela. It is not! It is about our family! There is too much harassment from all sides, all the time. It is upsetting the girls. George Bizos suggests we send them to a boarding school in Swaziland. They'll come home on holidays. Will you cope being alone? When I married you, I knew I was marrying the struggle. Have you heard from Evelyn? She has a job at the mines, typing. Thembi came to visit. -How is my son? -He is a man now. He has his driver's licence and his own car. Tell him I am allowed another visit in six months' time. He has to put in an application. I will tell him. How are our friends in Lusaka? Oliver has been appointed President General of the ANC. English only! Tell Oliver that all of us in here agree he should escalate the armed struggle. The people must make this country ungovernable. That's it. Vosloo, this visit is terminated! -This way please. -No, please! -We were talking about family matters! -Do you think I'm stupid? Vosloo, escort the prisoner back to his cell. Follow me. On your feet, Mandela! Move! Gregory! -That was quick. -They started talking in Xhosa. About what? Mandela told her to instruct Oliver Tambo to escalate the armed struggle, said they must make the country ungovernable. Anything else? Family stuff. Kids going off to boarding school, that sort of thing. When Winnie gets back to Joburg, she's going to be detained indefinitely. It's going to be front page news. I'll send you a clipping. Make sure Mandela gets it. No problem. Oh, one small thing. She mentioned his son, Thembi, the one from his first marriage, he's got his driver's licence, even has his own car. -He probably stole the bloody thing. -Right. -Hello sweetie! -Ladies! -How was your day? -Good, where are the kids? Switch on the kettle, won't you, make us all a nice cup of tea? -What do you think, James? -About what? -Her hair! -Oh! It's nice. Nice? Please, it's stunning! Wait till Jan sees it, you're in for a busy night, my girl. I believe Mama Africa paid us a visit today, James? You girls seem to know everything. Nothing happens on this island without me finding out about it, usually before it happens. -So, what's she like? -She was only there five minutes. They started talking Xhosa, so I sent her packing. -James speaks fluent Xhosa. -Really? He grew up with them, on a farm. He had a friend called... What was his name? Man! Who cares? -No, man, tell us. -Please tell us, James. Bafana. James has got a photo of the two of them. I'll get it. Gloria. No. Gloria! -No, l... I want to see it. -Me, too! I didn't know you were a farm boy, James. I'm not a farm boy. Here it is. Look. -Oh, cute, look at the little Kaffir-lover. -I'm not a Kaffir-lover. Joyce. He's even got his arm around the little nigger. -That's it! -Looks like a Kaffir-lover to me! I'm going fishing. Brent, get your rod! -Look, Pa, a starfish! -That's nice, Natasha. -Pa! I've got one! -Hey, bring him through the rocks there. Nice and slow, that's it! Hey, don't look at me, man. Don't look at me. I'm not your bloody mother, man. -Brent, give me that rod. Come here! -Move it! Bastard! Natasha, come here, girl! Stay down! Stay there! -But Pa, what about my fish? -Never mind your fish. -Faster, faster, faster! -Come, come, come! Are you trying to piss me off? -Brent, get down, boy! -But, Pa... Move it, you lazy bastards. All right, we can go back now. Come on. Okay? Move it! Don't look at me! Yes, yes. But what about my fish? I'm sorry, boy, but if those warders had seen you, I would be in big trouble. Why? Prisoners aren't allowed to see children. Why not? 'Cause they're here for punishment. Okay? This is from Motsadi's wife. "We have decided to boycott the bus service "as they have increased the fare by 80 cents." Cut it out. The following, please collect your letters. Sisulu! Mhlaba! Kathadra! Hurry up, do you think I've got all day? Motsadi. Jonas Motsadi! Where is Motsadi? -The rest of you are dismissed. -Mr Gregory. I found this in my cell. According to regulations, no prisoner may be in possession of any newspaper, or part thereof. Therefore, I am handing it over to you, the proper authority. I am surprised that you did not look at the article, Mr Gregory. Come on, come on! That's it. Yes, go Robben lsland! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah! -Wow, Daddy! -Yes! -He's really got something, eh, darling? -Very good. Gregory! For a postman, you play a damn good game of rugby. -To Robben lsland. -To Robben lsland! I think it's time I had a word with Piet about James. He's officer material, there's no question about it. Oh, Joyce, I'll do your hair for free for the rest of your life. Then I'm definitely going to talk with Piet! Are you off to Cape Town for the weekend? Yeah, my mom has been dying to see the kids. It's been ages. Then I'm going to give you a little shopping list with a good mayonnaise at the top. I can't stand this prison-issue stuff. Come here. -Granny! -Granny! Hello, my darlings! These are for you, I found them on the beach. Oh, they're beautiful. -Hi, Mom. -Hi. -How was the ferry? -Oh, fine. -The sea was flat for a change. -Oh, good. Got you some fresh crayfish, Barbara. Oh, never mind fresh, they're alive! Oh, seeing as you didn't get seasick, we can go shopping now. Nelson Mandela? That's awful! Ya, it's a big responsibility. James gets to check their mail and monitors all their visits. That's restricted information, Gloria. For goodness sake, Mom's not going to tell anyone. Gloria, come help me choose some salad stuff quickly. I'll wait outside with the kids. Come here. The two of you, stand still. Stand still. Where is your passport? Let me see your passports. Where is your pass? Your pass! Here, your pass. Come, come, come. What's going on, Pa? -Passports. Where is your pass? -They're checking for passes. -Come back here. Where's your pass? -No! No! Hey, come back, come back. -Hey! -Hey! Get in the van! Where is your pass? My baby! -You can't just leave the baby here! -Shut up! I'll take him. He's my daughter's child. It's all right. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. Maybe you should go and talk to her. Another minute and these will be done, okay? Feeling better? Dinner's almost ready. -Why didn't you stop that policeman? -Because that's his job. To take the mommy away from her baby? No. But if the mommy doesn't have a pass, then she's not allowed to be there, so they have to arrest her. Do we have a pass? We don't need one. -Why not? -Because we're White. -But is that fair, Pa? -It's apartheid. It's the way we live, Natasha, Whites on one side, Blacks on the other. It's God's way, darling. Just like he doesn't put a sparrow with a swallow, or a goose with a duck, or a cow with a buck. It's just not natural. And we don't question God. -Switchboard. -Pretoria 39001. -Jordaan. -Gregory here. A telegram just arrived for Mandela. I know. The boy smashed head-on into a bridge. Was it... What? -You know. Was it an accident? -Of course. -You'll tell him personally, won't you? -Yeah. Let me know his reaction. What's up? Mandela's oldest son was killed in a car crash. Good riddance. Do you have kids? Hey, work, you Kaffir! Hey, do you want two days solitary? Who the fuck is Madiba? -Madiba, it's Mandela's clan name. -Clan? Go tell him. Mandela, I'm sorry. Hey, work, Kaffir! Hey, what are you trying to do, man? Get back to work, man! -Van Niekerk! Can I have a word? -What? Regulation 1 6/A of the Prison Act states that if a prisoner loses a family member, they are entitled to two days off work on compassionate grounds. -Compassionate grounds? -Hey! Mandela's a lawyer, he knows these things. You don't want him laying a charge against you, do you? I can escort him back to his cell, if you like. Earlier today, South African forces intercepted a large group of SWAPO insurgents in South-West Africa, -killing 12 terrorists... -Would you like some more? -...and arresting five. -Yes please. -There were no reports of casualties... -Thank you. ...on the South African side. Dr Christian... Your food's getting cold. -What if it was murder? -Not in front of the children. James. They'd never do such a thing. I called the police in the Transkei. I spoke to the duty officer. The more questions I asked, the more he clammed up. Eventually he hung up on me. -That doesn't mean anything... -Can I serve the jelly, Ma? Go ahead, darling. I was the one who told Jordaan that Thembi had a licence, that he had a car. You're doing your job. This country is at war, James. These people are savages. They don't want to share this country with us. They hate us. If they had their way, they'd drive every single white person into the sea. They'd leave us with nothing! Not even the clothes on our back. Yeah, I know. Come and have pudding. All right, you win this time. There won't be a next time. I'll come back and visit. I promise I will, Bafana. My father says you are going too far to ever return. I have to go. This will protect you the rest of your days. I will wear this forever. -I see you, Madiba. -I see you, Mr Gregory. I want you to know that I am very sorry about the death of your son. Many times I tried to explain to my son why I was always away from home, that I fight for a better world, for my people and my family. I'm not sure he ever understood. Where did you learn to speak Xhosa, Mr Gregory? I grew up near where you were born. Then you understand. I need to bury my son. -You know they will never allow it. -I am an honourable man. I give you my word I will not try to escape. It's not you. It's your communist friends. What if they try to rescue you? What communist friends are you referring to, Mr Gregory? The whole of the bloody African National Congress. Obviously, you have not read the Freedom Charter. -I have. -You have not. It is a banned document. Where would a sergeant in the Prison Services get his hands on such a document? Well, I know about it. Then you would know that all we want is equal rights for all, a world where people like you and l can live peacefully side by side. That is what I wanted for my child. Surely you want the same for your children? I wish to be alone now. Motsadi, Mandela must eat. When our leader is ready to eat, he will eat. You can tell him his son was buried yesterday, that the boy's mother was at the funeral. -Have you read the Freedom Charter? -What? The Freedom Charter. Have you read it? -No. -Do you know what it's about? It's about the extermination of the Whites. -Stuff like that, isn't it? -How must I know? Pa, can we go watch Province play against Natal on Saturday? -Maybe. -Yes! I just need to quickly pop into Roeland Street Prison. -But my mom's got lunch waiting for us. -You go ahead. I'll be on the next train. But Roeland Street is not... Go, kids! Go. Excuse me, I understand there's a section here containing banned literature. -Downstairs. -Thank you. -Yes? -I'm with the Prison Services. I'd like to take a look at the Freedom Charter. Wait here. -You got an authorisation? -What? This is a restricted area. You need authorisation to be here. Sergeant Gregory. I'm a warder at Robben lsland Prison. So? You need authorisation from the security police if you want to look at banned material. Listen here, Major Jordaan of the Bureau of State Security personally instructed me to take a look at the Freedom Charter. Call him. It's Pretoria 39001. Give him what he wants. Sit there. You'll find it in there. Thank you. "We, the people of South Africa, "declare for all our country and the world to know "that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, Black and White, "and that no government can justly claim authority "unless it is based on the will of the... " -What are you doing here, James? -What are you doing here? I can't believe you did that. How can you lie to me? Gloria, I am working with them, I need to know how they tick. I'll tell you how they tick, James. They tick like a time-bomb. And then they blow up, boom! Sit up straight. Afternoon. Can you imagine what would happen if Piet found out about this? You could kiss your promotion goodbye, that's for sure. Please, man! What promotion? I promised Joyce I wouldn't say anything. About what? Come on, Gloria, you can't keep a secret. Piet put a recommendation into Pretoria that you be promoted to warrant officer. He even told Joyce if you carry on the way you are, you'll be lieutenant at the end of the year. Oh, that's very nice. Not if you throw it all away by doing something stupid. I'm not going to do anything stupid. With the salary you get and the little I make, we can't even afford to buy the kids new school shoes. Come on, Gloria. Come on, it's not that bad, Gloria. James, the Prison Service is all we've got. Christ, they even own the house we live in. I'm not going to mess things up. Okay? Look at me. Okay? Plumstead is up next. I don't want your mom seeing you like this. -Hey, man, how was your weekend? -Good. Did you go and watch the Province match? No, but they nailed them good, eh? Are you looking at me? Don't you look at me. Move it! Come, come, come! You slack bastards! Move it! Hurry up, hurry up! -The post will have arrived by now. -Not with this South-Easter blowing. That ferry will be an hour late, at least. Go check anyway. "The national wealth of our country, the heritage of the South Africans, "shall be restored to the people. "The mineral wealth, the banks, industry shall be transferred... " The ferry hasn't even left Cape T own harbour. -Must be bloody rough out there. -You can say that again. Mandela, I have a question for you. You claim the ANC is not communist, but the Freedom Charter says that the mineral wealth, the banks and industry shall be transferred to the people. That is communism and don't try to bullshit me otherwise. It is not. It is, in fact, true nationalism, where all the people, White, Black, coloured, lndian, all benefit from the accumulated wealth of the land. Our land. And your land, Mr Gregory. -These are ideals you'd kill for? -These are ideals I would die for. There's no justification for murder and you know it. You people should never have taken up arms against us. You White people were deaf to our pleas, blind to our suffering. You left us no choice but to take up arms. -Sergeant! -Sir! What are you doing cavorting with a prisoner? I was just telling Mandela his lawyer is coming on Monday for a consultation, sir. -Get your arse up here! -On my way, sir! Raise your arms. -Sir, I can... -Raise your bloody arms, Sergeant! Congratulations, Warrant Officer. I'll see you in the clubhouse. Thank you, sir! For he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellow And so say all of us T o James! And may his promotion not go to his head and cause us a lot of heartache! Cheers, James. Warrant Officer Gregory, may I have the pleasure of dancing with you? Didn't I say this would happen? Didn't l? You sure did, Booky. What are you gonna do about it? -Switchboard. -Pretoria 39001. Jordaan. I've got a postcard here for Jonas Motsadi. Motsadi? Motsadi? -lsn't he due for release next week? -Yes. There's a message written inside it in Xhosa. What does it say? It says he must go to an ANC safe house in Gaborone and from there, he'll receive instructions. Is there an address? Put the message back just how you found it and make sure that Jonas Motsadi gets his little postcard. ...of local cricket supporters. Included in the team are such esteemed players as Bob Willis, Tony Drake... -Watch your queen. -...and Trevor Chapel. In the early hours of this morning, the South African Defence Force launched a pre-emptive strike on a known ANC safe house in Gaborone, Botswana, killing four terrorists. One of the men, Jonas Motsadi, was recently released from Robben Island Prison where he was seRVing five years for sabotage. That's us, Pa! Robben lsland! -Did you know him? - The weather forecast for the Western Cape tomorrow is cloudy with occasional fog patches, clearing later with moderate to fresh westerly winds... It's your move, Pa. Go, move it! Yes, yes, yes! Faster. Go, go, go. -Are you sure my wife is on the ferry? -I called ahead. -lt will be Christmas soon. -My kids are already counting the days. How are they doing in school here? My son struggles a bit but my daughter is sharp as nails. You must encourage them to do well in school so they can go to university and make something of their lives. University is expensive, man. Although you bloody people think it should be "free, compulsory, universal and equal for all children," isn't it? That is a direct quote from the Freedom Charter. I am most impressed, Mr Gregory. Mr Gregory, I have a favour to ask. I have a small Christmas present for Winnie and I was hoping you could give it to her. No, man, Mandela. Now you're going too far. It's just a small chocolate. Where the hell did you get a chocolate from? That is of no consequence. I could have you in solitary right this bloody minute! I have not seen my wife for two years. For God's sake, man, where is your humanity? Where is it? Drop it and walk on. -I'll escort Mrs Mandela from here. -My orders are to remain with her. I am in charge of visits on this island and you will remain on this bloody ferry until it leaves! Please. I see you, Madiba. What have they done to you, Namzamu? They dragged me from our daughters. They beat me. English only! Please, Mrs Mandela, you have very little time, don't waste it. Mr Gregory is right. From Nelson. He says it's your Christmas present. Have a safe journey, Mrs Mandela. Warrant Officer! You recognise this? That's Govan Mbeki's writing. It was intercepted by Security Branch at the Soweto post office. Since when are prisoners allowed to discuss other prisoners in their letters? I would never have allowed this through, sir. Vosloo must have missed it. You're in charge of the Censor Office, not Vosloo. -Make sure this doesn't happen again. -Yes, sir. -Nice work with Jonas Motsadi. -Thank you, sir. -Warrant Officer Gregory. -Gregory, get your arse over here! I'm on my way, sir.
