 

                        Beloved children, I'll tell you a story. It's a story of this flute. May be, in the meadows or in the forests, it was born in a Bamboo bush. Kissed by the dew drops & the gentle breeze, Fondled by the warm sun rays. Searching for the melody of the unsung songs, One day, it's heart throb gave birth to the finest music on the earth. That was the music from this flute. You didn't tell me the destination. If you go straight, you'll reach the market. I'm going there. If you want to go by this way, you've to get down here. We will get down here. For how many days will you be in this place? It depends. We'll run the show in the crowded places. Then, we'll move to a different place. Take it. Have it with you. When I carry load, I charge for to and fro. Even otherwise, I would've come alone. Atleast you gave me company. Kunjappi doesn't want you to pay for that. In all the green meadows where beautiful flowers bloom, Below the trees under the blue skies. Till the time, this piece of bamboo breaks, Till the time, the flow of music stops, This sound will save all the living creatures, Like the sound of the Almighty. This is the sound from that flute. What do you feel about our new palace? For the time being, we'll stay here. One day, we'll build a real big palace. - And we'll stay there. Three of you should quarrel & break the bangles today itself, okay? If you buy for us tomorrow also, then, we'll break. Look at her wish. 2kg Rice, 1 kg Sugar, 100g Dhal, 100g Grams, 100g Chilly, 100g Coriander seed. Coconut oil 100g, Tea 100g, 1 bundle Pappad & Salt 2kg. Is there Dried Fish? Everything is there. If you ask all together, how will I pack? There is only one hand. Then, Have you kept your other hand for sale? Brother, won't you buy anything for me? What do you want? Those Sweet Peanut balls. Manikutta, sing after dinner. Rice'll not get cooked, if you sing. But you flew away from me, Sweet little Bird. Sit quietly. Brother, You're really a pretty girl. Oh Good Gods who reside in heaven, save us always at anytime & everywhere. We will eat. Don't talk while having the food. Praise the Lord. - Praise the Lord always. Are you a Christian? - Yes. Then, how come you can be so arrogant? - Arrogance? Do you know to whom this land belongs to? It is Church's property. Till that point, it is the property of the Church - Is it? What? Do you think you can erect a tent without anyone's consent? Is this not an act of arrogance? - I did this unknowingly... Now, you've come to know, isn't it? Then, do one thing. Remove this tent and vacate the place immediately. But father, for 4-5 days, we need shelter from sun and rain. But you can't erect it here. Come here. Do you see that boundary? You can build a tent or a place there. None'll question you. Not only for 5 days, you can stay there permanently. That's Government's Land. But father, whether the land is owned by the Govt. Or the Church, If we use it without their permission, that's... - That's? That's the act of arrogance, isn't it? Are you teaching me? No. Not at all. - Don't teach me. Just obey. Jesus... My car... Oh, what a naughty children! They've ruined my car. Where did you get these brats from? - They're my children, Father. Your children? - Yes, my children. What is your name? - Ebi Abraham. I am not bothered Whether you're Ebi or Abraham. After sometime, I'll come this way. I shouldn't find this tent, you & those children here. If I still see you here, then you'll get it. Move away... What're you looking at? You and your army, push the car. Come... Oh Great people of this town, our next item is magic trick to thrill you all. People have an opinion, that magic is fraud. But we'll prove that there's a science behind this art. This is a hat. What is this? - A Hat. Yes, a hat. It's empty inside. How is inside? - Empty. Yes, empty. Can we bring a dove from this hat? - Yes we can. We can. I'm going to bring out a dove from this empty hat. Here comes the dove... come... come... yes, come on fast. Here is the dove! Next item... The hat is going to present you with a white bunny rabbit. What rabbit? - A bunny rabbit. All of you clap your hands. Clap your hands again. Here... here is the rabbit. Oh God, it is a dove. Ouch! It is a dove again. Yes. Dove again. Symbol of Peace. Can a bunny rabbit become a dove? Can a dove become a rabbit? If it doesn't happen, then it's fraud. If it does, then it's magic. This is the magic. It's a Science. It's an art. All of you clap. The next item is a trick which none of you've seen before. If we perform magic like this, We'll be stoned. Chandru, you had put me to disgrace. But that was the rabbit's mistake and not mine. That's because we're not proficient with these tricks. We somehow managed today. We will have to find something else for tomorrow. Take out your finger. Ebi... Ebi... Ebi... Ebi... - Silence. Don't talk. I find that you're a smart man with many tricks. Your magic. Though you were fooling the people, I liked your presentation. You understood that I was fooling people? Yes... yes... How do you identify it so quickly? No. Don't try to fool me also. You'll not play tricks on me. Sorry father. We do this for our daily bread. Knowing that only, I didn't catch you red handed. Even I'm interested in magic. As you rightly said, it's a science & an art. But if you fool people like this. Keep quiet. Did you remove your tent from Church's Land? Yes. I did. Move away. - Move... move... Come. Let's go - Are you people going? Push it hard. Push it hard. Pastor's car, push it hard. Wait... wait... Come... come... Move... move from the way. Get in. Get inside the car. These kids... I wanted to ask you when I saw you the first time. How did they come to you or How did you get them? I got them from streets. Abandoned by parents, longing for love, None wanted them. So they were destined to live in the dirty streets. They're Orphans. Many years back, I was also one among them. My childhood days... Those are the days of curse. That man was nobody to me. I was not born as an orphan. In some distant land, in some house where there had been love & happiness, My parents might be still crying over their lost son. He stole me when I was playing in the courtyard, when I was very young. I don't remember. But I heard him telling this to somebody. What I knew, was the miserable life in the streets, that cruel man, And the painful bashes of his whip. Take that cane and play it. Play it. Idiot. I'll kill you. Oh God, don't beat me. Please don't beat me, please. Like an angel, I found a great man sitting infront of me. He felt pity on me. That great man became my Saviour. The treasure of love that I lost at my young age, I got it back from him. He didn't have anybody to love or to be loved. Many years ago, he had a misunderstanding with his wife and was living alone. In his Ionely life, he got a little lamp spreading rays of hope. That was me. He called me son. From that day onwards, I became his Ebikuttan. I don't know when I was born. But the day on which he picked me up from the street, became my birthday. We celebrate that day, every year with ecstasy. College life is full of joyful days. One day in the Hostel, it was an unexpected news. The death of my daddy. All my dreams and hopes got shattered. My daddy's wife, who quarrelled & left him alone years ago, came back weeping, And wailing on the day my daddy died. Her 2 brothers also came with her. Then, they didn't go back. Daddy's torment was his wife who never loved & understood him. But she loved only his money. One by one, they brought the properties under their possession. The adopted son of Thomas Abraham became nobody in that house. Who asked you to remove this photo? Who're you to ask that? This is daddy's room. You can't do here whatever you like. Is it so? Then, today onwards it is my room. I'll not let you spoil this room. You go. I'll not. Who're you to rule me? This is my brother-in-law's house. I'll do whatever I want. This is not the place for a beggar to rule. He will do whatever he wants. You get out from here. I tried to console myself that the luxuries I enjoyed so far was just a dream. Without nothing in life & unwanted by anybody, I again became all alone in this world. Go, You little thief. How do they start stealing at this young age? We shouldn't forgive these brats. Today he stole a bun. Tomorrow he'll even steal money. Why do you beat him? He is a small boy. Don't interfere in my job. I'll take care of him. Is there fish? - Yes. One fish fry. Is gravy available? - Gravy is there. One plate Gravy & double Omelette. What is there to drink? - Coffee or Tea? Don't you've Horlicks? - Yes Horlicks is there. But I don't want that. Give me 2 Bournvitas. Rs.37.50. It's very cheap - Yes... Yes... How much did it come up to? - Rs.38. I don't have money. - Why is it so? No money. - How come if you don't have money? I don't have money. Even if I've, I'm not willing to pay. What? Are you not willing to pay? - Yes, call your police. Call them. I've seen you earlier. Have I not? - Yes. Where was it? Tell me, idiot. Speak decently. - Okay, I'll be polite to you, Sir. Where did I meet you, Sir? - I'll tell you. This is my prestige issue. I've to sell tickets worth Rs.50,000 for a cursed football tournament. Please buy a ticket for Rs.5000 and help me sir. While you were pleading to my father saying this so politely, I was also there. Even now if you don't recognise, for the police club anniversaries, And all other ventures of yours, There was a rich man in this city who donated generously. Thomas Abraham, do you remember him? Oh! Mr. Thomas Abraham's son - Not son but adopted son. Okay You go - Sorry sir, I'll not go. Your people have brought a poor boy here, with a charge of stealing a bun. Both of us have done the same crime. Stealing. He is an orphan from the street. Are you like him? Of course not. Because I've the initials of Thomas Abraham. Will you take him to the court for stealing a bun? No. Instead you'll charge him with all petty thefts that had happened. Then, Court will send him to jail. To the midst of bigger thieves, finally he'll come out as a very big robber. Don't teach me this philosophy. With due regards to Thomas Abraham, I sympathise you. You can go. We'll decide what to do with the boy. Sorry sir. If I should go from here, you should also let that boy free. I... You needn't tell me. I know what you'll tell. Did it pain when they beat you? No. Always everyone beats me. I'm used to this. I'll not steal hereafter. Can I come with you sir? Whenever I feel hungry, give me something to eat. I'll do whatever jobs you tell me. - Not sir, call me brother. I don't have anybody. Can I come with you brother? Where? - Anywhere. I'm also an orphan. A bigger orphan than you. On that day, I found myself in him. My childhood days. That was the beginning... I feel like crying because of hunger. You'll not let us beg or steal. There is no money also. Then how'll we eat? I'm going. If I go to any theatre & sell tickets on black, I'll get enough money. Kutta, will you go? - Yes, I'll go. Then, what are you looking for? Steal or sell black tickets or do anything. Does anybody wants to go with him? Then go. Anybody can go. I'm not going. What is this? What is happening here? Get up all of you. What're you doing with these kids in the night? Are you training them to steal? No sir, to sleep in the night... To sleep, is it? Is this your father's property? Talk directly. I'll not consider that you're a policeman. What will you do? What do you think of yourself? Are you a collector? The other day you wanted to rescue an orphan boy. Now you've beat the police for the sake of some orphan children. Are you Jesus Christ to take care of all the destitute & orphans? What can you do for them alone? I can do anything whatever is possible for me. Stupid, Then, there're about 500 Orphans in this city. I'll hand over them to you. Take care of them. Look here, I'm telling this because of my relationship with Thomas Abraham. To take care of orphans, there's Govt. & orphanages. You can do nothing. Hereafter, try to build a good future for you. First, you secure yourself. Then you do social service. Ebi, think again. Send those kids away. Try for a job. If you've any requirement, whether it's money or recommendation, I'll help you. Your first take care of yourself. First come out of poverty. Then, you can do big. Why're coming behind me? I don't want anyone of you. Go somewhere. Didn't you understand what I said? That day I realized, that I can never depart from these children. Soon we left the city. Then we didn't stay in any place permanently. We moved from a place to another, Like birds, who don't sow or reap or fill their granaries. Coffee. Good. Nice coffee. I'll go... Tomorrow, come to church when it is convenient to you. I will be there only. - Okay father. You can come in... Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord always. Ebi, after I heard your story yesterday, I've great respect for you. The whole night, I was thinking about you and those children. But now, I feel you're a cruel man. Thinking that you're doing a big service, you've been very cruel to them. May be, you didn't intend to do it deliberately, but that's the truth. Look, when your father picked you up from the streets, what did he do? Did he send you back to the streets to beg with a clown's attire? No, he educated you. That's why you're smart. But what're you doing to these children? And they are not one or two. I want to educate them father but... But you don't have the funds. How'll you have funds? Even if you run shows throughout the country, you won't get enough for food. Have you ever thought, what they'll become when they grow up? Big clowns or bigger rowdies. Instead, you could've left them in the street itself. Atleast they would've become capable to take care of themselves. Even now it is not too late. There is an orphanage in the town. You put them there. Their expenses & education will be taken care of, And you try to get into a job. I'll help you. Mean while, complete your education also. And when you become well off, Donate liberally to such charitable institutions. This much of sacrifice is more than enough. No father, If I had to run away like that... You forgot something. I'm not an orphan. I was made an orphan. Similarly these children, nobody are born as orphan. I'll never send my children to an orphanage. They're not orphans. I'm there for them. You're sure. Is it? - Yes. What to do? Some are insistent on climbing Kakultha hills through thorns. Climb! Sit. Hey, sit man. Shall I take some wine? You want or not? No... Okay then. It's boring to have wine in the morning. I'm not blaming you. If it had been anybody else, they would've abandoned these children. You're really great infront of God. You should not fail or surrender. I'm with you. You should grow them up, educate them, And make them greater than yourself. The Church runs a school here. We can join the kids there. I'll try to get the land from the Committee for rent on a minimal price. You can build a house there. It is not enough to sit down and nod your head. Joining the children in the school alone is not sufficient. They need uniforms, books & good food to eat. What'll you do for the money? If you alone play tricks and Somersaults on the streets, is it possible? No... Then, we've to make it possible. 5 - 6 Goats, few Hens, We'll start a small farm initially, to earn money. But the initial investment? We'll avail a loan from the bank. There'll be some money in my personal savings too. Why does a pastor need personal savings? Let that money be useful for a good cause like this. Father... These tiny tailor birds are building a beautiful, warm & cosy nests with straw. Every eye and every heart has a dream to cherish. When the rainy clouds become an umbrella over the earth, And when the peacocks dance, On the mountain tops, on it's greeny sides. A thousand little birds made their nest. Tiny friendly birds. Tiny friendly birds. They're flying by singing sweet songs. Dear young one of the cuckoo bird who lives in the distant forests, Would you come and join us to build this beautiful nests? We'll make a beautiful garland with our dreams, And hang it like festoons in our nest. The blue skies are showering rose water on us. Beautiful butterflies, come and join us for a feast. This is a great pleasurable moment. This is a memorable moment. We'll join together as one body & a single soul soaring to greater heights. Oh, pretty... pretty... pretty dragon flies Today is the birthday for lotus & lilies. Move... move from the way children. Move... move... Move - Not possible. Come... Where're those kids who came in that cart? What is the matter? It needn't be told to you. Just go & bring their father here. Who? - Father. Don't they have a father? They do've. - Then go & bring him. Do you want me to call him? I'll do that. You came in search of their father, is it not? Here, it's me. The head of this family. Now tell me. Why've you come here? Tell me fast. I've many jobs to attend to. Those kids and the cart driver pushed us down on the road. Look, my leg broke. Those two boys legs have been fractured. Oh, It's a pity. You do one thing. Oh, then you go to some hospital soon. Don't waste time. We don't want your sympathy. Then, what do you want? Those kids and the cart driver should apologize to us. To apologize? I don't have any problem. Come... She wants you to tell sorry to her. Will you? No... No? - No... They say that they'll not. Then how? Kunjappi brother, will you apologize? I would've done that. But, I'm very much elder to them. And me telling a sorry to kids like them... That is embarrassing - Yes. Then, what will we do? Ouch... don't laugh. She'll get angry. Watch. I'll teach you all a lesson. Now, all of you laugh. Not the kids. It is he who has to apologize. Look at his pride. We can't accept defeat. It is a prestige issue for us. I really got wild and wanted to punch him by mixing up Karate & Kung Fu. Then, why did Mr. Brucelee stand there with folded hands? But you are our leader. Couldn't you signal me at that time? I would've bashed him like this... Oh my God. As my horoscope said, It was true that I'll get beaten up by my children. My dear Yohannan, you nearly killed your father. Hey, I'II... Uncle, he did it by mistake. If he repeatedly makes 4 or 5 mistakes like this, I'll be no more. Dear Salman, you might as well know such tricks, is it not? Will you also use it on me? Look at her laughing. These kids used to be very quiet. Only after you had come for the vacation, they've become very naughty. So, I'm the accused. I'll leave this place tomorrow itself. You can be peaceful. Oh, I was just joking. You can also beat me if you want to do so. I'll bear it, it'll be enough if we add even this in the horoscope. Yes... Kunjannamma, Had your bath? - Yes. Did you wipe your head properly? Otherwise you'll get fever. What do you want to drink? Coffee or Tea? Okay, just before bath you had a tea, then, I'll mix Horlicks. No need that, I'll take Boost. My dear Kunjannamma, don't feed me like this. I want to live longer. If you don't want, forget it. You belong to that family who used to drink porridge and eat tapioca. Listen to this Whenever I tell him to eat or drink, he resents. If it had been your father, The way he eats, the person who serves will become delighted. Why do you quote her late father as an example? Our two children are sufficient to delight you and to spoil my wealth. Don't insult food. God will not forgive you. Daddy will say like that only, What do you want my children? Shall I take juice for you? Orange juice or Apple juice? How about you, Annie? My stomach became full as soon as you asked me. I don't want anything. If nobody wants anything, Then, why should I toil like this in the kitchen? Come... She's angry. Tonight she'll not prepare anything. Alright. Atleast one night, we can happily starve. Ousepachan, what do you want for dinner? Beef or Chicken? Do you want beef or chicken? Want chicken? Caught... caught. Close your eyes... close your eyes. Close your eyes... count one, two, three. Go... run... catch the thief. Go one by one and apologize to Annie sister. Why? - For pushing us down yesterday. We didn't push you down. You fell down. Are you arguing with elders? Go... Everyone say sorry to her. We'll not. We'll not - Will you not? Run... Run away from here. Go - You fatso. I just wanted you to threaten them. Why did you push him down? I only caught his shirt. I didn't expect him to fall down. That was very bad. Is he not a small boy? He would have badly hurt. We elders should not behave like this. They all are orphans. I heard the Pastor telling this to our daddy. Who is doing this? Eggs! Daddy come here. They're throwing eggs at us. Are you all children? What's happening here? Why is this commotion? Oh God. Oh! Ouch! My hip... Hey, don't throw eggs. It's paining alot... Oh God... Hey, come here... Ousepachan, Come here... come here... - I'll come. There is a limit to play pranks... You know who that Ousepachan is? He is a big shot here. Treasurer of the Church Committee. Just because it was him, he told me. If I had been anybody else, they would've created a big scene. They gave this land free of rent to you because he obliged. What a shame! After all they're kids, father. Unknowingly... Not unknowingly. They very well know. They think too much of themselves. They got nothing else to throw! Eggs. Not one or two... Nearly a hundred eggs. If you had sold them, You would've had money for your 1 week's expenses. It was my fault that I supported these orphans. I can say only that much. Come here... I'II... Enough... stop... stop... I asked you to stop. What Father said was right. Orphans! You'll not prosper. It's all my mistake. Big shot's children can do anything. These children are after all Orphans. I didn't think of that. In anger, I told something. Forgive me. I didn't mean anything. I love you people so dearly. When I hear them complaining about these children, I couldn't digest. Come... You beat them very harshly. Don't cry, okay. What? Is nobody coming for dinner today? Are you angry because I beat you? If you're naughty, then I've to punish you only. Don't show your anger towards food. Come... come and eat something. You'll not come. Is it not? Is it like that? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 910. I've taken up the punishment. Even now, if you don't come, I'll not talk to you. Look, shouldn't people praise that you're good kids? Only then, I'll respected be infront of people, isn't it? I feel very hungry. Come all of you. You won't come, isn't it? Okay, if you don't want dinner then, I'll also not eat. Enough? - Yes, enough. Did your anger subside? - Yes. Shall we start? Good. You threw stones at the beehive & when the bee stung you, You've come with complaints here. Ousepachan's sons are Naughty idiots. Forget them. They don't know anything. Are you like them? You know the outside world, isn't it? Aren't you educated? Shouldn't I retaliate for all the insults he did to me? You don't know who he's. That is the problem. I'm not bothered whoever he is. He looks like a robber. Why do you laugh, Father? Have you read bible? Come, let's go for a walk. Do you know the Good Shepherd and his flock of sheep? When I saw Ebi for the first time, I was reminded of that Good Shepherd. Now, don't you think, That you shouldn't have behaved like that to Ebi and children? Oh Balloon, very beautiful. I want that one also. What to do now? If I don't eat all this, Kunjannamma... Will kill me father. - Me also. Show me your hat. I'll give this to the children. Very juicy grapes. Shall I give you some fried Cashews? No Thanks, this is more than enough. They're very good. Rachel had sent them. My dear Kujannamma, you brought me into this state after feeding me like this. Please spare Father. You won't eat. Why do you bother people who're willing to eat? Father, have this also. Come... Good grapes, Have it. Father is offering you with love. Have it. No... No... I don't want. You've it, Father. Where did your body guards go? They won't be available from 9 to 4. They've classes. When the children go to school, then Annie is always out. She'll wait at the gate for them to come, To roam around. What else will I do in this Ionely area, Father? It's terribly boring here. Sitting here in the house is very boring. One is occupied with his business of Spice & other with preparing dishes. You'll get from me. Don't be angry Kunjannamma. I was just joking. Enough, don't try to pacify me. Oh! This Kunajannamma doesn't have any humour sense. How do you put up with her, my dear Ousepachan? You get away from here. Her B.A. Exams are over. Is it not? What is she going to do next? She wants to go back to Bangalore and join M.A. She doesn't have father or mother. All these years, she had been in convent and hostels. I want her to get married to a good person. It's better to leave for the individual to decide all these matters. All of you get inside. Get inside fast. Quick. Get inside... Children, don't climb on the cart & play. Get down. We will have a ride, brother Kunjappi. Look here, they've some work to do. They can play or go for a ride later on. You can't make them work. Do you know? Wait... wait... I'll also get inside. Not required. I'm an expert in driving carts. Stop... stop... you guys be here. Today, you'll complete all the work in the farm. Brother Kunjappi, come... There're clothes to be washed. Go and do it. Who's it? Hey, leave my hair. Give me that hat. Go fast, sister. - You want me to go fast? Okay, shall I? You can leave. I'll take care of the other jobs. I don't have any harsh feelings towards you. It was Babu's fate. It was neither your lapse nor anybody's fault. Without the knowledge of the Almighty, even a feather doesn't wither. Let us realize that & console ourselves. Whether it is me, you or anybody, When the creator calls us, we've to go to Him. Nobody can stop that. But that shouldn't weaken us. We should also not stop, what we've started. No Father. I'll not let down my spirits anymore. God bless you and your children. Stream is flowing and the waves which moves inspires us. Those waves are showing flower petals & the ringlet is flying in the breeze. Can anyone of you sing this? I can sing... I can sing - Let me hear. Okay ... Sister, I'll sing. ... Sister, sing once again. From the beginning? Stream is flowing and the waves which moves inspires us. Those waves are showering flower petals & the ringlet is flying in the breeze. Brother... brother... - What? What is it? Sister knows a nice song. Do you know? A very nice song. Brother, please come, a very nice song. No... No... I don't know to sing. Just like that, I... Sing. Let us also hear. Keep quiet, she'll sing. Stream is flowing and the waves which moves inspires us. Those waves are showering flower petals & the ringlet is flying in the breeze. As if it is a big thing. Anybody can sing this song. Then you sing, Father - Sing. I'll definitely sing. Sing ... Yuck, who wrote this song? Why're you laughing? Why don't you try? It is very easy. In the beginning even I thought the same. If it's very easy, then please sing. I'II... Stream is flowing and the waves which moves inspires us. Till that you've escaped. Those waves are showering flower petals & the ringlet is flying in the breeze. This is how I sing. Make it faster. You want to make it faster? Yes... sing... sing - I'll sing. He'll sing children. You'll not be able to make it. Shall I sing? Stream is flowing and the waves which moves inspires us. Those waves are showering flower petals & the ringlet is flying in the breeze. Sang... he sang. There is melody in the sweet smile. There is melody in the salty tears too. The dancing peacocks, singing cuckoos are searching that melody. Whose foot steps are you waiting for, my little lamb? Don't you have sweet dream cherished in your heart? Heart is searching sweet tender coconut water. It's available in your smile. It's quenching the thirst of my burning heart. Then it leads us to a golden dream world. That smile contains a sweet tune. Apart from that, there's a dream world. The wind which blows touching the bee-hive, Also touched your beautiful fingers, And disturbed the silence. While the wind carries the cold of winter, It takes rest in rainbow coloured flowers. Will you touch the creepers on the fencing? Brother Ebi, what happened? Get up, brother... What? What happened? What happened, Ebi? - Nothing. Nothing - What happened? Nothing. What happened, son? Nothing! Nothing? - Yes. Nothing? - Yes. There's a melody in the sweet smile. There's a melody in the salty tears too. The dancing peacocks, singing cuckoos are searching that melody. Of Enchanting Rhythmic Waves. Ebi brother. What? - Look at this. A gift from Annie sister. New dress. Today is her birthday. You gave gifts to everybody, what about me? For the Good Shepherd, I've brought a flute to play heavenly music. By the way, it is me who should give you a gift. Give me. I'm ready to accept. What do you want? Can I ask you anything? - You can. Will you also include me in your flock of sheep? In the deep green forests, Can I accompany you with your flock of sheep? No. We shouldn't do anything forgetting ourselves. Will you take me for sight seeing in the deep green forests? I'll definitely take you with me one day, But not today, My Sweet Heart. Today, the whole day, I'll sit on the mountain slopes alone & sing about you. Today, I'll be dreaming only about you. Good Shepherd... Good Shepherd... Where did he go? Go... Good Shepherd... - Good Shepherd. Good Shepherd. Good Shepherd. What did you call me? Good Shepherd. With whose permission did you go inside? Why should I seek permission? Are you that arrogant? I entered your heart without anyone's permission, isn't it? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. We love each other. In this birth and in all the births, I bind you both together. How was the dream? A dream is always a dream. No Ebi I've decided I'll get my exam results soon. If I want I can go back to Bangalore. Then, M.A. For two more years. After that I can settle down anywhere. But I'm not going anywhere Ebi, do you know, my parents brought me up with utmost love, Unlimited wealth. I was the only child. Anything that I asked for, was granted immediately, But... How fast I lost that fortunate life! When I was in the convent, One day in the newspaper, the news was about plane crash. My parents were there in the list of those who died. They were in Kuwait. They were anxiously coming here to see me. I'm also an orphan like you, Like your children. It's God who made us meet. Look Ebi, I can do whatever I like with my property. Nobody will oppose. We will spend that here for the children. Annie... That's... Don't say no. We'll have more children along with those that we've now. We both will be a brother and sister to them. And when we have our own children, They'll also grow along with these children. None of them should never be called as Orphans. Tomorrow is my Daddy's Death Anniversary. I've to go and pray at his tomb. I'll go to the town this evening. I'll be back only day after tomorrow. Till then the children should be taken care of. You go with confidence. I'll take care of them. Kunjappi is also there. But why Kunjappi? Now, Kids don't want me or you. They're becoming inclined to somebody else. Annie. She'll be there to take care of them. Won't Brother Ebi come today also? He was supposed to come yesterday itself. Why didn't he come? Today he'll surely come. Watch! He'll come. But he hasn't come yet. He will come. It is me who is telling. Don't cry. He may not come. He would've got some job there. Will you be quiet? Didn't he come yet? - No. Kunjappi brother has come. Let's go now. No. Stay here till Brother Ebi comes. Let her go children. I'll come early in the morning, tomorrow. No, please don't go. - Okay come. He'll come. Why're you worried so much? It's a week since he left. He would have had some urgent work there. Otherwise, why should he delay? The way you're bothered, it seems as though he'll not come. You both became so intimate, isn't it? No, not like that. Children are very much worried. Yes... yes... only children... I can understand. Where were you all these days? You scared us. Couldn't you inform us if there was any delay? That girl is terribly worried, And kids are weeping bitterly. You should be more responsible, isn't it? What herculean task did you've there? What happened? I've the privilege of only to dream, Father. My children... I'm worried about them. Ebi, what're you saying? What happened to you? I don't know. I started on that day evening itself. I fainted on the way. When I woke up, I was on a bed in some hospital. I couldn't make out what had happened. Next day, they sent me to the medical college. For past 3 days, they conducted many tests. Finally doctors told me, That only prayers will help. It's been very late it seems. Too late. What is remaining might be only few minutes or few days. The problem is with my heart. The doctors were surprised as to how did I survive till now. They didn't let me go from the Hospital. I stayed there for 1-2 days. Waiting for death in the midst of unfamiliar faces there, I was scared. I wanted to meet my children. I wanted to meet everyone who loves me. At night, I silently came out of the hospital. I didn't want to tell this to anybody. I wanted to come back here, play, dance, sing and crack jokes, And to die all of a sudden. Brother has come - Where? Are you all angry with me? I could not come on time as committed. Were my children worried? Look here. What all I've brought? Toys, colour pencil, water bottle. I've brought all that you had asked for. Aren't you convinced yet? When I bought for kids, I Wanted to buy something for you also. It's a sari. I've never seen you in a sari. I don't know whether you will wear it also. But I wanted to buy one. So I got it. Are you also angry with me? Don't be angry, please. I'll not go anywhere hereafter. Is that okay? Are you angry still? I'll take up the punishment. We are not angry. We're all first in our classes. Jump with joy, Ebi. Isn't toady the happiest day for us? I'm very glad. My children are very smart. Your children, is it? Then I'm not related to them, isn't it? These men are always like that. When there is a credit, they own it for themselves. No, you take all the credit. I don't want anything. That is also not agreeable for me. We'll share it. Even the Bible says so. Ebi, we've to celebrate this. What shall we do? Tell me. Everything is left to your discretion. Then, We'll do one thing. I'll get my results in two days. I'll definitely get a first class. We'll celebrate everything together. What? Not just a small celebration. We've to do it in a grand scale. A real festival. Let the whole world know, that there is a Heaven here. I've also found a name for our Heaven. "Heaven of Dreams". Why are you silent? Nothing. You go and change your dress. I told everything to Uncle & Aunt. First, they opposed. Then, I used my last & powerful weapon. I cried and wept. Finally they agreed. Uncle wants to meet you. Day after tomorrow, we're leaving to Bangalore, To settle everything. Then, we needn't go there again. One week of separation. As soon as I come back, we should get married. Poor girl'll come running with lots of dream of building a Heaven. How do I console her? Forget about Annie. She might cry. But after sometime, she'll forget all this. She will have a better life than this. But my children... If I'm not there, then who else is there? You'll be there. But you can't devote yourself completely for them. All of them are very intelligent in studies. But if they're let in the streets again, I can't even imagine... Ebi, don't bother yourself with unnecessary thoughts. Hear my words. We'll go to some better Hospital. God is merciful. No father. Nobody can make us immortal. Death can only be postponed. But for how many days? No... My heart says that only few more days are left. I'm not coming anywhere. I wish that my last moments shouldn't happen on the Hospital bed. My son. Don't worry about me. But my children... What will happen to them? I thought a lot. There is only one way. They should be put in an Orphanage. When you told me that earlier, I disagreed. I wished that they shouldn't grow with the label of an Orphan. But... Now... No... They're Orphans. Why... why're you all so silent? There'll be many children like you. You can play and go to school with them. The school is nearby. Don't want... you'll not be there. I'm going somewhere for an urgent job. It might take few days for me to come back. Till such time, how will you be alone? That's alright. Sister is there. But she has gone to Bangalore. Father'll take you there tomorrow. We'll not go. You should go. It's me who's telling that. Don't you want to become smart? Don't you want to study and become Great people? When will you be back? Beloved children, I'll tell you a story. It's a story of this Flute. May be in the meadows or in the forests, It was born in a Bamboo bush. Kissed by the dew drops and the gentle breeze, Fondled by the warm Sun rays. Searching for the melody of the unsung songs, One day, it's heart throb gave birth to the finest music on the earth. That was the sound from this flute. In all the green meadows where beautiful flowers bloom, Below the trees, under the blue skies. Till the time, this piece of bamboo breaks, Till the time, the flow of this music stops, This sound'll save all the living creatures, like the sound of the Almighty. This is the sound of this flute. Whatever I heard was true? Ebi, say no. You lied, just to cheat us for a fun, Is it not? It was aunty who told that. I didn't believe. No, I don't believe anybody. You're alright. You're perfectly alright. When did you come from Bangalore? Is there so much of a distance between us? Don't weep. What all dreams did we have? I'm scared. You've sent the children to the Orphanage. Where will I go? Wherever I go, Can I forget you? Can you exist peacefully without seeing the children? Why did you send them away? Am I not there for them? Shall I go and bring them back? No... They've gone with the hope that I'll come back with lot of gifts. They shouldn't know anything. When they become tired of waiting, they'll slowly forget me. When they attain the age of understanding, I'll remain as a memory in their minds. That's enough for me. Go home. It's getting late. No. I'm scared to go leaving you alone. I'm scared even to close my eyes for a second. By that time, I'm scared whether you'll go leaving me alone. Will you do that, Ebi? Will you leave me alone and go? I haven't seen you enough. I haven't loved you enough. Brother... Brother... Brother Ebi - Brother Ebi. Brother Ebi. He is not to be found anywhere, Sister. There he is - Where? - There. Brother... Brother... Brother... Beloved children, I'll tell you a story. It's a story of this flute. May be in the meadows or in the forests, It was born in a Bamboo bush.
