'You can see me in you.' 'I love you more than myself.' 'You're the one for me.' 'The heart is obsessed' 'about making you mine.' Officer. - Yes? You spared some time for us in this bad weather. We're truly grateful for that. That's the kind of relationship we share. I always come whenever you call me. I just told you about Rohan. What do you think? It's an interesting story. I've cracked many difficult cases. But Rohan's story has so many anomalies. You'll see Rohan in a while. He is a bit shaken up. But you have to help him. Please. Consider it done. - Sir.. Come on. You should come home someday. All we do is talk over the phone. Please come. Tea? Yes, please. Our police station and your newspaper office are the safest places. Karan updated me about your case. But I want to hear it from you. In detail. Hey, Ronnie. Are you done with the story? I already mailed it to you. - What's your take? Well.. A 32 to 35 year old woman. Depression. Husband is in the Gulf. Found with a licensed pistol in her right hand in a hammock. They also found a suicide note. According to the police, it's an open and shut case. And.. What's your verdict? Murder. Successful! Beautiful! And in the end just awful! Just like every love affair. Did Priya call? Come on, man. Enough is enough. It's been almost a year since Priya moved to London. Since then she hasn't called or replied to your emails. What does it mean? She has gone. Forget her. I'm looking for ways to forget her. Don't change your house, change your bed instead. You need to sleep with someone, buddy. Get laid. Really. There's a property on Coco Beach. The landlord lives in the main house but he also has an outhouse. Let me know if that suits you. I have met his daughter couple of times. Who's more attractive the girl or the outhouse? I'd say a girl in the outhouse! Your cabin is like your sex life buddy. Start the engines. But she wasn't an ordinary girl. Hello. Hello? Hello? Hello. Oh, shucks! Be careful. Excuse me. Don't be scared. He is my pet. You have a pet too. - Yes, but.. So why are you being scared? But that's a.. He was just 2 months old. He was very badly injured. Had I not brought him home, he would've died. I'll keep him here for another month and later, I'll set him free in a lake. Are you the landlord's daughter? - Yes. Actually Karan has recommended this place. Why do I feel that I've seen you before? I have a pretty common face, right? I mean to say.. The outhouse is over there. There.. Thanks. You're welcome. You're welcome, Mr. Neighbor. Hey! You? I've called an electrician but he'll come tomorrow morning. Be careful! Thanks, Ronnie. Hey.. How do you know my name? I don't know your name. But didn't you call me by my name when you said 'Hey Ronnie'. No. Never. You're trying so hard to find out my name. then I am Maya. Nice meeting you, Ronnie. See. You know my name. You just said your name is Ronnie. Fuse box! Oh, God! Come on, sister, pick up. Hi, sister, you didn't.. Fine. Forget it. I have to tell you something. You know what? Your words are literally coming true. You predicted love at first sight in my case. That's exactly what happened. I'm in love. He moved here a while ago and.. Hey.. Hey, little Bobby. What's up, little buddy? Yes. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Maya ma'am asked me to come here. I am the electrician. Sir, it'll take a few more minutes. How long have you been working here? - Since I am a kid. I am from Coco beach. My father was also an electrician. And Maya.. The one who sent you here. How long have you known her? Three years. Very nice lady. She has been living here since her father got ill. She also has an elder sister but I think she lives in Delhi. Hey! Good morning. Nice. Good night. Bye. Oh shucks.. I am.. I am so sorry. You sneaked up on me and scared me. Was I sneaking in? Why would I sneak into my own house? By the way, why were you snooping around in my house? Well.. I was looking for you. I know I am so special. You know, I am a good habit. Thank you for the electrician. - You're welcome. Why don't you have dinner with us tonight? That's okay. You don't have to.. I mean.. - No? That can mean both yes and no. So are you coming? Don't worry. My cooking is just as special as I am. Sure. Why not. I'll see you. Okay. Yes! Is everything okay? - Doctor.. I was always scared of venturing into jungles since I was a kid. But as a crime reporter I have to go to these places. I fought all my fears, doctor. I never let anything defeat me. But I can't face my fear of heights. Acrophobia. Vertigo. It's the fear of heights. But why suddenly? I mean I was fine until now. And no one in my family had it either. It doesn't have to be hereditary. It can also be the result of extreme stress. And to fight with this stress it's only love and passion. Because when a person is passionately in love all his problems disappear. It's been a long time since Priya. You should move on. Reduce your stress. Go out! Go to parties. Meet new people. Expand yourself. Okay. 'Gold necklace around her neck..' Madam. Give me the keys. I'll hand it over to Ronnie. Oh hell! Hey, Ronnie. - Yes? Good morning everybody! How are we? Hello, sir. How's the place? - It's nice. And Maya? Come on, sister. Pick up. Hi, sister. You know what? Ronnie loves me. You know what? He moved here for me. He has got my photographs. He saw me and followed me here. He found out our outhouse was vacant and he shifted here. Tonight he is coming over for dinner. 'I felt I am so lonely for the first time.' 'I felt I am so lonely for the first time.' 'I am worried and I am hapless to say.' 'I need you for staying alive.' 'I need you for staying alive.' 'I felt I am so lonely for the first time.' 'I am worried and I am hapless to say.' 'I need you for staying alive.' 'I need you for staying alive.' 'I need you..' 'My heart races away' 'the moment I come close to you.' 'Every time, I look in the mirror' 'I see you next to me.' 'Let me wash away in the tide of love.' 'I need you for staying alive.' 'I need you for staying alive.' 'I need you for staying alive.' Are you telling me that she fell in love with you? Sort of. Mr. Karan.. I thought love heals all problems. So why not vertigo? Do you always drop in like this? Scared, are you? Fuse box! Is it 9 PM already? But the sun hasn't set yet. That's because it's not the time for sunset yet? I think I invited you to dinner. I am very forgetful. Actually I'm here to invite you. - For? For a party. What do you say? Yeah? - Okay. Will it be too late? Dad is alone at home. We'll leave whenever you want to. Is it a yes or a no? What should I do? Yes or no? I think it's a no, right? No! Yes. Good. So I'll see you. Yes. I'm going out on my date. Obviously. My first date ever. I'm already feeling nervous. I wish you were here. That would've been so good. All I know is that I love him and I think he loves me too. Obviously. Why else would he take me out on a date? Date? No, I just find her interesting. She is sort of strange, but cute. No. I'm not having an affair. At least not for some time. You know, don't you? Yeah, I'll tell her. Of course, I'll tell.. I am sure she won't misunderstand. Wait. I'll call you. Maya? Ronnie, did you lose something? You look gorgeous. 'I'm struck by love. Heal me.' 'I'm struck by love. Heal me.' I love this place. Let's head to the bar. Come. Come on. Hey, Frankie. - Hey! Pour some shots, man. - Here you go. Right from this.. Come on.. - No. Please. For me. Please. 'You're my desire. You're my intoxication.' 'My heart is your slave.' 'I wish to live with you with no bounds.' 'Come and dwell in my breath.' 'You're my desire. You're my intoxication.' 'My heart is your slave.' 'I wish to live with you with no bounds.' 'Come and dwell in my breath.' 'I'm struck by love. Heal me.' 'Come and touch my heart.' 'Come and touch my heart.' Sister, I'm going to tell him tonight. I'm going to tell him. I love you. Fuse box. Ronnie! Hi! Nancy? Wow! - Come on! Oh, my God! - Nancy! How are you? - I am good. How are you? I am not talking to you. You broke up with my sister. How could you forget me? You changed your phone number, but didn't tell me. You broke all contact.. - Okay. Okay. Had I met you, you would've reminded me of her. I just wanted to get away from everything. For a while. Okay now. I'll take your number. You will call me. - I will call you. Promise? - I promise. It's the same number, right? - Yeah. Are you okay now? Okay, let's dance. Guys, let's dance. Come on. Let's go. - Come on! Oh, my God! - Hey.. Ronnie! 'God brought you to me.' 'I made you mine.' 'Don't ever separate from me.' 'Love is essential for the soul.' 'Come and touch my heart.' 'Come and touch my heart.' See you, Ronnie! Bye. - Bye. Where have you been? Come on. No, I don't want it. What happened? Something wrong? No, it's just.. Bad mood. Now? It's just my mood. It's better now. I am in a good mood now. And I didn't know you were so moody. But I was a moody girl. Then I thought, we just get one life why waste it? Moods no longer control me I'm in control of my moods. You know what? You're such a.. Such a cute doll. Can we have some music? - Sure. Rock? - Hip-Hop! Hip-Hop! - Or jazz. You have 'Bhangra'? - Do you like any music? I like the music you like. Fuse box! Fuse box? Ronnie! Oh shucks! Oh my God! Maya! Who was driving on the wrong side of the road? It was raining heavily and it was very dark. I don't know who was on the wrong side. You didn't try to call the police and fled the scene. I didn't run. Shucks! What have I done! Oh, my God! Shucks! Is anybody there? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Maya! Maya, come here! Maya, someone's down there. - Ronnie! What happened? - Someone's there, Maya. How can I be so stupid? What happened? - Someone's down there! I have vertigo. You have to take him out. - Will you relax? We have to save this person! Maya! - Relax. We need to take her to the hospital. - Just relax! Ronnie, I am a nurse. I'll take care of him. Wait here. Just wait, I'm coming. Don't move from here, okay? Just wait here! Shucks! Help! Somebody help! Help! Is anybody there? Help us! Maya! Is everything okay? Maya, is she okay? Ronnie! Maya, please tell me everything is alright! Ronnie! Ronnie! Help! Anybody there? Anybody there? God! Maya, tell me what happened. Ronnie, too late. What? - She's dead. Maya, what do you mean? - I tried my level best. We can't stay here any longer. Are you out of your freaking mind? How can we leave her here? - Listen to me. We can't stay here any longer! - Maya. It's dark here and it's raining heavily. If the police find out.. Don't forget you're drunk! Let's go from here. Let's go. Let's go. Shucks! - Come on! What if someone finds out, Maya? - Come on. Maya, listen. Listen to me. - Let's go. Get inside the car! I killed her! I killed her! I killed her! I killed her! I killed her! I killed her! I killed her! I killed her! - Calm down, Ronnie. I killed her! - Ronnie, just calm down. Why.. Ronnie. It was her fault. It was dark and raining heavily and she was speeding on the one-way street. She was drunk too. We should go to the police. We'll confess everything. - Ronnie. I'm telling you. This.. Ronnie, I'm a single woman! And if the police find out.. Drunk driving! Attempt to murder. Who will look after my father? What.. What will I tell my sister? We can't go to the police. Don't do this. Maya, I am so sorry. Ronnie, you're not alone in this. Even I am there. Maya. Please. Maya, I am sorry. Relax. - You'll be fine, Maya. Bobby, don't.. Breakfast? Eat something. I don't feel like eating. At least, have some coffee. You haven't eaten since last night. Just leave me alone. Fine. You got a call from Karan. He told me that the girl who died in the accident was at the party too. Did he say a name? - He said some girl Nancy. Hey! I am so sorry, little buddy! But daddy is in a deep mess. You'll report about the flood in Margaon. Figure out who is your photographer. I want impactful visuals. The water should look neck-deep. Alright. Hey, Ronnie. I'll talk to you later. Good, you're here. I think you should cover the hit-and-run story. Sorry? Which story? I called you for this. Didn't Maya inform you? That one.. Yes. Some hit-and-run. Some hit-and-run? Ronnie, I am serious. Didn't Maya tell you anything about Nancy? What happened to Nancy? Oh! - What? Shucks! You mean? No! - Hey, man! You mean to say that.. Shucks! Nancy is dead. You mean to say that Nancy is dead? I must call Priya. - Hey, listen. Listen, man. Listen. I understand what you're going through and I am really sorry. But this is big! I mean we shouldn't give up on this story thinking it's just an accident. Come on, man! Don't you understand? This has the ingredients of a huge lead story! A lonely girl on a desolate road. It was very dark and it was raining. And then hit-and-run. Boom! My friend, this is up your street. Make it happen. Find me some controversy. Shame the cops. Embarrass the government. Come on, man! Get me a rocking story which can stay on our front page for weeks. Hey! Hey! Listen! Give it to Thomas. Give it to Rita. Give it to somebody! But I am already following up with the Sonia murder case. I can't help you. I am sorry. Hey, Ronnie? Any problems? The Deputy Superintendent of Police is taking an interest in the Sonia Singh murder case So I can't delay. Ronnie, I asked any problems? No. Why? You've been working for me as a crime report for four years. And this is the first time that you're late. What's up? - Actually my car broke down. There were no taxis available either. And the date? Date? Maya and you went out on a date, didn't you? Nothing of that sort. I am just trying to know her. - Oh listen. Explore away. I believe you. In fact, I'm with you on this. But hey. Take my car and go to the site. Don't worry. I'll talk to the DSP. Don't worry about the minister. The favorable articles our newspaper wrote after the minister's son rammed his Skoda into a school bus is the reason he still has a sterling reputation. So the minister owes us big time. Don't worry. Go on. Make me proud. Help, Ronnie! Ronnie, help me! Ronnie! Hello, Mr. Rohan Achrekar. Any leads? Was it a truck or a pick-up? Bus or car? What's your guess, Mr. Crime Reporter? I guess investigation is your job, not mine. Who was the driver? Was he rash? Or he just didn't see it coming? Or was he drunk? His car could've skidded. I'm trying to unfold the mysteries behind this case. Because there's something bigger than evidence. Truth! I uncover the truth and don't just gather evidence. Whatever. Shucks! Where's my car? Maya! Maya! Maya! Maya.. Everything was so dirty. I thought I'll clean the place. - Where's my car? Your mirror.. You write everything on it. - Where the heck is my car? Your towels. Look, how dirty.. Where the heck is my car, Maya? Don't get hysterical, Ronnie! I am not getting hysterical. I am freaking scared! My car's paint is on Nancy's scooter. Do you know what will happen if the cops find my car? I'll go to jail. I should've never listened to you. I shouldn't have listened to you at all. Ronnie, your car is safe! Your car is safe! 'I love you more than myself.' 'You're the one for me.' 'The heart is obsessed' 'about making you mine.' 'I want to immerse myself in you.' Where's my car? - 'Look into my eyes.' Can you swim? 'You can see me in you.' 'I love you more than myself.' 'You're the one for me.' 'The heart is obsessed' 'about making you mine.' Maya, what have you done? Why are you complicating things? It's still not late. We should tell everything to the police. Maya. Maya, stop for a second! I am talking to you. Don't you have any feelings? I don't have any feelings? I'm doing it because I have feelings. My feelings are for you, god darn it! What's wrong if I want to save you and save myself? I am a girl. A single woman. But I'm trying to stay strong so that you stay strong. Maya, listen. But now.. I am scared for you. What if something happens to you? If something happens? I am scared. Maya.. - I am scared. I am scared. - Maya.. I am scared! When was your car stolen? - Saturday night. Which car? Scorpio. Color? - Grey. License plate number? GA 01 6666. Nice number. In the name of the Lord. He that stands in the house of the Lord's. In the court of the house of the Lord's Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good. Sing praises onto His name, for God, it is pleasant. For the Lord has chosen Nancy Smith as His pleasant treasure. For I know, that the Lord is great and that our Lord is above all gods. You killed me! Ronnie! You killed me! No! You okay? How is your vertigo? I heard your car got stolen. Yes. The car that rammed Nancy's scooter was also grey. Evidence number one. Yeah? Yes? Does Ronnie Achrekar live here? Thanks. Are you his colleague? No. He is a friend. Today was my sister's funeral. You might have read in the papers. Nancy. I'm so sorry for your loss. But Ronnie isn't at home. Okay. Excuse me! - Yeah? What do I tell Ronnie? Priya. - Priya. Well.. You said he isn't.. I am so sorry about Nancy. I can't believe Nancy is dead. She was so excited. She was supposed to come to London and now she's no more. She did not deserve this. So young. So happy. It doesn't make a difference to anyone here. This is just another case for the cops. But not for me. I have to find out who killed Nancy so mercilessly. Ronnie. Please help me find that rascal. Coffee. He was inhumane. He could've taken her to the hospital. The police said that injury wasn't fatal. Had she been taken to the hospital, she could've survived. Ronnie, only you can help me. I want that creep behind bars. You're a well-known reporter. You can write articles and put pressure on the police! You know, maybe a single article can help us find a witness. You know? Perhaps someone will lead us to the car or to the driver! Give me something! Anything, Ronnie! Anything! What the heck can I do about it? Am I the police or the lawyer? Am I the witness? No, right? Please, Priya. Try to understand. Please. The other day you didn't even meet me at the graveyard. I should've understood where our relationship stands. 'When we met, it was the trial of our love.' 'We parted ways.' 'Yet our destination didn't change.' 'You were with me on my excruciating journey' 'like my shadow.' 'You're the one who encouraged me at every step.' 'When we met, God blessed me with His grace.' 'When we met, God blessed me with His grace.' 'Filled with sorrows.' 'My heart was filled with sorrows.' 'Without you, my heart was filled with sorrows.' Darn! Shucks! Oh, God! You're implying that someone fiddled with your car brakes which caused the accident. And you still got away without a scratch, huh! We'll have to inspect the car. But I already sent the car to the garage. Very strange. Three sugars please. You sent your car to the garage without filing a police complaint. Are you sure this was an accident? But this doesn't look like an accident. What do you mean? Nancy was your sister, right? - Yes. Step-sister? Yes. - Thank you. Welcome. Beautiful house. Whose house is it? It was Nancy's 18th birthday gift. From dad. - When was her birthday? Today. And after Nancy? - Mine. I see. So this place is all yours since last night. What do you mean? - I mean perhaps.. Nancy was murdered. Somebody killed her. I don't mean you. Not yet. This is my number. Call me if you have any information about the case. Are they investigating Nancy's murder or me? He's investigating you in connection with Nancy's murder. But why? Because only you benefit from Nancy's death. That's why. I am going back. I can't handle all this. But I thought you wanted to come back. Yeah, but.. Not like this. I missed you every day when we were apart. And trust me. Every single day. I was wrong to think that I could be happy by staying away from this place, from you. But I was wrong. - Now what? It's not possible for me to stay here any longer. Why don't you come with me? It's not that easy.. Nice drink. Is it new? - Sort of. Nice mix. Old relations and a new drink. Wow! Wow! Sorry for twice interfering in your illogical lives with my logical findings. Excuse me. According to forensic report Nancy didn't die of the accident. She was strangled. Nancy has been murdered. What? Ms. Priya, when did you come in the city? You came here a day before Nancy's death. Not a day later. Am I right or am I right? Now this is an official warning for you. You cannot leave this city without my permission. Without my written permission. Is that clear? Another question. Who else did know you came here a day before Nancy's death? I mean who else? Ronnie? And if Ronnie knew then Praise the Lord! I mean.. This is going to be so much fun! It will be so much fun! It will be so much fun. Maya. Maya.. I've been knocking on your door for so long. Why aren't you answering the door? Even your phone is switched off. Maya. Maya, you know what? I met Inspector Moses today. Forensic report says that someone murdered Nancy. No. Not possible. How is this possible? Nancy had an accident. We were there. Moses is lying. - I just don't get this! I am so confused. Someone is trying to prove the accident as a murder. But why? Why would anyone do it? - Who is Priya? What? - Who is Priya? What does she mean to you? What do you care? - What's your relation with her? Why do you meet her every day? What I do and who I meet is my personal business, okay? It's not your personal business, Mr. Rohan Achrekar. Don't forget. Even I am involved in everything that's going on. And Priya who you meet every day is actually Nancy's sister. It was Nancy who died because you rammed her with your car. Because you were drunk. And I.. I was with you. Understand? You won't meet Priya again! That's it. I can't do that. - Why? Why can't you? What does she mean to you? - She's my ex-girlfriend. I knew that witch will ruin you. What did you say? What did you call her? Come on, tell me! What did you call her? Your Priya! She is a witch! - Maya! Maya, I am so sorry. - Don't touch me. Maya, listen. Maya! Maya! Mr. Achrekar, why did Maya hate Priya? Jealousy. Jealousy. Jealousy. 'You are mine, just mine.' 'Wherever you go, you just come to me.' 'I am a stone.' 'Come and break me and turn me into a mirror.' Hey buddy, your article was sensational. My newspaper sales have gone up by 100 percent. Last year, it was the parents and this year their daughter died in an accident. Nancy was still alive after the accident. She was murdered later. Yes. Right? - Yes. If the driver intended to kill her.. He screwed up. Or maybe someone accidentally rammed into her.. And fled the scene thinking she was dead. The murderer took advantage of the situation. You know what this means? He climbed down the ditch and he found that Nancy was alive. God darn it, Ronnie! Do you know what you're saying? Of course. Come, I'll show you. Nancy was supposed to leave the bar and attend some guy's surprise birthday party. Someone was supposed to kill Nancy between the bar and this party. Maybe the boy himself. Unfortunately she met with an accident on a one-way street. After the accident, the driver fled the scene and the murderer strangled Nancy to death. And of course, this accident wasn't planned. Nancy was supposed to die that night. Whether the accident had taken place or not. This accident was incidental. This accident.. Hang on! Hang on, Ronnie. Hang on. Maybe this is just a conspiracy theory. I mean, I think it's a hypothesis. Yes, it's a hypothesis. Nonetheless any hypothesis which has the potential to be proved right and anything that can be proved makes a great story. And we have a great story. Hello. - Maya. I have some news for you. Read tomorrow's headlines and you'll understand everything. Dinner tonight? Why did you choose tonight? Just.. You're lying, aren't you? You know Saturday is my birthday. So come home, I'll cook a nice meal for you. Of course, it is. How could I forget? I had a question. Give me that fish. Did you meet Priya again? No. I trust you. Bye. Bye. Yes! Your phone is ringing. I was busy and the phone was on silent mode. Anything urgent? Moses called. They've found a witness. I want you to come with me. Please don't say no. It means a lot to me. It was very dark. It was also raining, so I couldn't see much. Did you see a car? - Yes, sir, I saw a car. It was at a distance. - Which car? It wasn't one of the regular cars. It was big. A big car. How many people? - Two people got down. A male and a female. Just like these two. Just like these two. - Are you sure? Not sure, it's a hunch. The guy was carrying a torch. First, he climbed down and then climbed back up and then he fled. And the girl. Where was she? Which girl? You said a guy and a girl got down from the car. Where did the girl go? - Where was the girl? The girl.. Tell me. The girl? Speak up! The girl.. Sir, I'll come back as soon as I remember where the girl was. - Idiot. I'll come back when I remember where the girl was. - Out! Ms. Priya, I hope you remember. I told you. You can't leave the city. I am not going anywhere till Nancy gets justice. I think it'll be better if you stop suspecting Priya and find the murderer. Hello. - May I speak to Rohan Achrekar? Mr. Achrekar left with Priya in the afternoon. Who is this? Hello. Hello? Can you stay for a while? I am a little scared. Sorry! Actually, I have dinner plans with someone so I'll be late. I mean, I have to go. It's okay. I understand. Good night. Yes, Maya. - Hello. Where are you? - I am at the office. I'm working on Nancy's story and I have some more information. I'll be late. I'm sorry, I can't delay this. No problem. I'll wait. No, no, no. Actually, don't wait up. If it gets too late, I'll sleep in the office. I'll see you tomorrow. Hey, I am really sorry. I'll make it up to you. 'I love you more than myself.' 'You're the one for me.' 'The heart is obsessed' 'about making you mine.' 'You are mine, just mine.' 'Wherever you go, you just come to me.' 'I am a stone.' 'Come and break me and turn me into a mirror.' You didn't go for your dinner. How could I have gone when you were scared? You know, I could never leave you alone. I missed you a lot. I missed you a lot, too. You know what? I knew you wouldn't leave. You know what? No one knows me better than anyone. 'I have found a reason to live again.' 'I found the shore when I immersed myself in you.' 'I have found a reason to live again.' 'I found life again.' 'When we met, God blessed me with His grace.' 'When we met, God blessed me with His grace.' 'Filled with sorrows..' 'My heart was filled with sorrows.' 'Without you, my heart was filled with sorrows.' 'I have a secret to share with you.' 'Be my confidante.' 'I want to say something to you.' 'Be my words.' 'I have a secret to share with you.' 'Be my confidante.' 'I want to say something to you.' 'Be my words.' 'Since we parted ways' 'I stay silent without you.' 'Come closer to me' 'and be my voice.' 'When we met, God blessed me with His grace.' 'When we met, God blessed me with His grace.' 'Filled with sorrows..' 'My heart was filled with sorrows.' 'Without you, my heart was filled with sorrows.' Maya. Maya! Bobby. Here boy! Bobby? Where is he? Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Maya! Bobby! Bobby! Maya! Maya! Maya! Maya! I tried to save Bobby, but.. How did he get out of my room? I was inside and I saw him playing outside. I dashed outside. By the time I could save him it was already too late. What's happening with me? Someone is playing games with me. Accident, Nancy's murder. Priya's accident. And now.. Bobby. He was like a kid to me. He.. Hold on. Only you had the other key to my room. You're accusing me for all this? You think I did all of this? Was I driving your car? Did I kill Nancy? Am I responsible for Priya's accident? And now you are accusing me of killing Bobby? Maya! Maya, listen to me. Maya, open the god darn door! Maya! Maya.. Maya! Maya, don't be stupid. Maya! Maya! Maya, listen.. Maya! What the heck are you doing? What the heck are you doing? - Leave me! Give this to me. - Leave me! What are you doing? Are you crazy? Are you? - Yes, I am crazy! I am crazy about you! And I am in love! I love you! I can't even think ill of you. Hurting you is out of the question! I love you, darn it! - Oh my God, Maya! Oh, my God! Maya, I like you a lot. Really. But love.. I never thought about you like that. You're lying. You also love me. - Maya. You're lying, right? You knew me before you even moved here. I saw my photographs on your computer. What was that? You took me on a date. What was that? You.. You arranged for dinner on my birthday. Why? Why? Don't you love me? You just left a rose in front of my door. Why? Maya.. - Because you love me, don't you? You're lying to me. I love you. Listen to me, Maya. Maya.. Wait.. I'll love you for the rest of my life. Maya, we got to sort this. Listen to me, Maya. I can't stay without you. I can't.. I love you. I love you. I love you. Oh Maya! Maya, what have you done? I am okay. Give that to me. - I'm okay. I'm okay. - You.. I love you.. For girls, it's all about attraction, possession jealousy obsession. This is obsessive. Obsession is a disease. Love is a disease. There you go. Come on, man! Rohan, I can understand why you didn't go to the police after those incidents. But what I fail to understand why the police didn't come looking for you after what took place. Thank you. Your phone is switched off since last evening. Your landline is not working as well. Priya called me so that she could contact you. She came here last night looking for you but the door was locked. What kind of girl is Priya? Why are you asking me personal questions? If you don't mind I would officially like to ask you some personal questions. How was the relation between Nancy and Priya? They were step-sisters. It was a love-hate relationship. And? And Nancy was 6 and Priya was 13 when Nancy's mother and Priya's father got married. I see. And? And what? Priya thought Nancy had taken her place. Tell me. Could Priya and Nancy have fought over money? How would I know? She's your girlfriend. How could you not know? Ex-girlfriend. - Right. Last night you were at your ex-girlfriend's house. Am I right? Why did you call Nancy an hour before she was murdered? Do you remember? You're right. I gave her a missed call. Why? Obviously to exchange numbers. Where? - Tony's Bar. Secrets! I love secrets! Yes. Why didn't you mention this in any of your newspaper articles? Yes. Like how was her mood? - It was normal. Normal? - Yes. Right. Why didn't you tell Priya about this? What difference would it have made? I am sure it will make a difference to her. If not you, it will definitely make a difference to Priya. Think about it. Thank you. Welcome. By the way, just for your information. I'm giving you a headline for tomorrow's edition. 'Inspector Moses solves Nancy Murder case.' Here. It will help. You will sleep better. Priya's responsible for Nancy's accident. Priya did this with someone's help. Because besides Priya nobody benefits from her murder. It was supposed to look like an accident. But she had a real accident. Hey, Priya. How are you? We're really sorry to hear about Nancy. Who was she here with? - Her regular friends. But she left alone. She danced with Ronnie for a while. Ronnie? She came here with Ronnie? Ronnie came here with some other girl. But he met Nancy here. Why didn't you tell me you met Nancy on the night of the accident? You came here a day before the accident. Even you didn't tell me. What's the difference? The difference is that Nancy was killed, Mr. Rohan Achrekar. Don't you get it? And I thought you loved me. I still love you.. - Don't touch me! I'll find out who killed Nancy. Screw you! Maya! Maya! What happened? Ronnie! Are you telling me there was someone else besides the two of you who knew about the accident? The license plate nailed to the door was a warning? It's not only interesting, but also exciting. And what about Priya? Did she contact you? Excuse me. Hi. - Hi, ma'am. How many ferries ply on this route? Just two and both are mine. Do you operate round the clock? - No, madam. We shut down at midnight, and start again at 4 AM. 16th was a Saturday. Were you here that day? Yes. I own this ferry. I was right here. Do you maintain a record of all the vehicles? No, madam. Why? Madam, did you say 16th? The night of the storm? - Yes. That night we had to shut our services at 8:30 PM. If the ferry service is closed what's the alternate route? You drive via the old bridge and it's dark out there. Priya-Nancy. Priya-Nancy. Priya-Nancy. Okay. Fine. JD, repeat please. Priya? Hello, Ms. Priya Ronnie is not at home. Actually, I have the keys to his house. You can check. Good! I came here to meet you. I went to Tony's Bar. This is Nancy, my sister, she was there too. You must have seen her. I don't remember. How did you two get back? Ronnie and you? We drove to the ferry in Ronnie's car. After that his car broke down. Before getting on the ferry or after getting off? After getting off the ferry. But Ronnie's complaint states otherwise. It says his car broke down before getting on to the ferry. Why are you asking me? Because you are lying. - Why would I lie? You and Ronnie caused the accident, didn't you? Shut up! You were in Ronnie's car, weren't you? Have you lost your mind? - You were drunk. I said no! - And then you fled the scene as you were scared. Just shut up, okay? No! You killed Nancy. - You killed Nancy. And you left her there to die. You killed your step-sister for the property and money. You left my sister to die. - No! Yes! You killed Nancy! - No! Yes! You killed Nancy. Leave me! I'll kill you. - No! Priya! Help! Help. What? Shucks. Maya! Sir.. What's this? Hello. Hello. It was raining heavily on the night of the accident, right? Which night? What accident? The night Ronnie and you went to Tony's Bar. That party! That same night Nancy met with an accident, right? That night.. Oh, my God! How can I forget that night? It was raining heavily, just like this, you know? And Ronnie got me so drunk. All I remember is that I got into his car and fell asleep. Then his car broke down and Ronnie woke me up. I don't remember. Actually, I have to go. Where is Priya? What? Where is Priya? Why are you asking me? Priya had called me. She knows who murdered Nancy. She asked me to come here. Maybe. But I don't know. I was at the market. But why is Priya's car parked here? I have to go. I'll see you later. One second. Let me just call Priya. Nancy. Bobby. Priya! No. I knew it was you. What.. What will I tell my sister? I love you. I am crazy about you. You're sick, Maya. Oh really! You think so? Your sister is dead. You.. You killed her. Why? Why? Yes, I killed my sister. She would always snatch everything I liked. My toys. Clothes, everything. She even snatched the boy I fell in love with. Had she been alive she would've snatched you too. It wasn't my fault that she couldn't swim. I killed her. Is it my fault? Is it? No, right? You're sick. I killed Bobby. And my child.. that alligator. I had to kill him, too. And Moses.. he was just going out of control. He made my life hell! So I killed him! I had to kill him. He was just going out of control! He suspected you. So you killed Nancy. You're missing her? Yes. I killed Nancy. Help me. Did you think you could snatch Ronnie from me? Help me. Not that easy. Help me. Priya is still alive. Would you like to see her? I always had a dream that we would get married somewhere high up in the sky. Today is the day. Don't open your eyes. One, two, three. Welcome to Maya's kingdom! I've got a surprise for you. Priya! Priya! I will save you. No! Priya! Sit. Well, well, well. Let me get you something to drink. Read. This is Priya's confession letter. It says Priya killed Nancy. After which she'd inherit the entire property. But she's committing suicide now and no one's responsible for it. Ronnie, you know what? I love you so much. That I can kill both of us. I wanted you to love me. Maya. Maya. How can anyone love so much? I don't want the police to catch us now. After Priya's confession.. As long as we're together, no one can catch us. No one will come here either. Make love to me, Ronnie. Make love to me. I love the smoke smell. I love the way you smoke. Priya, you're safe. Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Maya, no. Priya! Leave it! Let her die. Let her go. Maya. - I'll kill you, I'll kill you, Priya. Maya! Please. No one can save her from me! Not even you! Priya! Priya, he is mine! You're mine, okay? You're mine! I'll kill you, Priya. Priya, give me your hand! This time I promise, I won't let you go. Priya! I love you so much! Maya. Maya! Remember I told you. I end up losing anyone I love. You've seen the real strength of love. Love doesn't mean snatching. It means to give. To sacrifice. Come on! Give me your hand, Maya. Come on! - Maya, give him your hand. Is that what you want? For the sake of my love? Maya, give us your hand. - Give me your hand, Maya. Come on. Give me your hand. Maya! - Maya! 'I am a stone.' 'Come and break me and turn me into a mirror.' Rohan, you were a successful crime reporter. You got involved with an obsessed girl. Well, if everything you said corroborates then there is no problem. Karan, we'll have to file a charge sheet of this accident. I made a mistake. I should be punished for it. I understand. Go home and rest. Come to the police station tomorrow morning. I will make sure you get bail. Thanks. Thanks, mate. Officer, I'll speak to the Home Minister and stop your transfer. If I don't get transferred Ronnie will have nothing to worry for five years. Thank you so much! Ronnie. Oh shucks! I think someone's fallen down. I'll go take a look. Wait here! Okay? Hello, Priya. I rammed her like we had planned. Is she dead? - Ronnie? No. - This is our chance, Ronnie. If Nancy dies, that property will be ours. Die! Die, Nancy! Die! Did you call the police? - Have you lost your mind? You're drunk! I'm drunk. It's our secret, okay? We can't go to the police. Get in right now! Right now! We'll have to do something about Moses. I've found a solution for that, so don't worry. I know you've learnt the truth. This says you murdered Nancy. So you're committing suicide. I promise you. As long as your father lives, I will look after him. Sign it. Let me go. I won't tell anyone about it. I love you! I love you! I love you, Maya! Grandma's stories. Stories from our school days. Childhood stories, teenage stories. Real stories, fake stories. We all love stories.
