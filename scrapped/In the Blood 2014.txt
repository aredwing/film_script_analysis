( DOOR HANDLE RATTLES ) He was an outlaw, and he knew his days were numbered. He told me that the only person I could ever rely on was myself, and even that person may let you down. ( MAN WHISPERS ) Fuck this. ( BARKING CONTINUES ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) WOMAN: My father taught me how to fight, to survive, to never be a victim, to never cry, because those tears would be used against me. ( GUNSHOTS ) (GRUNTS) ( MAN COUGHS ) WOMAN: When he was killed, I never cried. Never. MAN: What the fuck? WOMAN: Not once. ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) MAN: I want you to be happy, but it doesn't hurt to be cautious. It's not like you guys were high school sweethearts, okay? I mean, you guys met at a needle exchange, for Christ's sake. It was Narcotics Anonymous, all right? And she is the reason that I am still clean. Yes, and I appreciate that, but there's still a lot of unknowns given her history, which has a habit of repeating itself. ( CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING ) WOMAN: My brother's a lucky man. ( CHUCKLES ) My dad always said consistent luck was skill. Well, then, my brother's consistently lucky. ( GUESTS LAUGH ) MAN: Prenups are the norm today, Derek. Marriage is business. If it goes south, you're going to need an exit strategy. Ava already signed. If you want to disown or disinherit me, please, draw up the papers, and I will gladly sign them, but I do not need an exit or... -( PAPER RIPS ) - ...a strategy. Now, is there anyone out there I should introduce myself to? Any family, friends? Uh-uh. That's okay. You've got us now. We're your family. PRIEST: Please be seated. ( MUSIC STOPS ) Derek and Ava have arrived at this very special moment in their lives. "L, Derek..." I, Derek... - "...take you, Ava..." - ...take you, Ava... - "...to be my wife." - ...to be my wife. - Oh, my God! - Freaking out. - Freaking out. - I'm not freaking out. Bienvenido. DEREK: My grandfather, he bought this back in the '40s for nothing. We used to come here in the summer when we were kids. But now my dad thinks it's too rustic, and he'll only stay at the Four Seasons. What do you think? - It's amazing. - Right? Right there, that is my grandmother on her wedding day. Oh, and this here, that's my uncle and my mom when she was... two or three years old. Wow. You know, this is the first time that I've actually been here since she died. She would have loved you. I wish I could have met her. Yeah. Whoa. Whoa. ( DEREK LAUGHS ) Why aren't I driving? I should keep this rocket ripper. ( AVA LAUGHS ) Whoa! Yow! (LAUGHS) What?! Whoo! ( CALYPSO MUSIC PLAYING ) What are you thinking? I think I'm supposed to be asking you that. - Typically, yeah, but... -( LAUGHS ) Oh, my gosh. Hello. May I? What's your name? - Ricardo. - Ricardo. Oh. You're handsome. He looks good on you. It works. - You think so? - I do. Hello. - Hello. - Uh-oh. - He wants his daddy back. - And we'll take him. -(LAUGHS) - Come on. Come on, little one. Let's go. You know, you will be a great mother. - You think so? - Oh, I know so. I didn't really have the best influence. Yeah, well, you know, we both got an education in how not to raise your kids, so... El bafio. I have to go to the bathroom. - That's Spanish for... -( LAUGHS ) Learn something new every day. All right, I'll be right back. Hey, give me a kiss. Do not go anywhere. Stay right there. Do not move. ( IAUGHIL19 ) - Hola. C6mo est? - Bien. Manny. Ava. Nice to meet you, Ava. - Beautiful view, isn't it? - It's gorgeous. - Where are you from? - Connecticut. Do you know Earl Sanders? Mm, uh... I don't-- I don't think so. He comes here every year. He's from Connecticut. Oh. Connecticut is kind of a large space. Si, si. I-- yo tengo familia-- I have family in Texas. Okay. Okay, not that close, but okay. Babe, this is Manny. He has family in Texas. - Manny. - Hey, man. What's up? - Wow. What's up? Good. - All good, all good. - Welcome. - Thank you. Thank you. So how much longer are you guys on the island? - A few more days. - And nights. Have you been to Cabarete? I don't think so. It's a beautiful, beautiful place. The longest zip lines in the Caribbean, in the rain forest. No. I'm afraid of heights. - That sounds awesome. - Oh, come on. - My friend runs the place. - Zip line. I can take you guys tomorrow. And it's a very safe place. Only one person died there last year. - Only one person. - Yeah. Relax. I'm joking. I'm joking. How about dancing? You guys like dancing? Ooh. Prefer zip-lining, but... Well, I love dancing, but this one... I can't dance, so why would I-- My friend runs the hottest club on the entire island. We can go there. I don't care. -( IAUGHS) I'd love to. - Well, we can do both things. - You'd love to? - Yeah. I'll tell you what I'd love to do. - ( DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ) - ( SINGING IN SPANISH ) - Whoo! - Come on!

( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( SPEAKS SPANISH ) ( GROWLS ) ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( LAUGHING ) All right. All right, ease up on the hands there, chief. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Here we go. DEREK: All right, babe. Come back here. Come back to me, babe. Okay. Hey, forget that gringo. You're dancing with me. Relax, man. Hands off my girl, all right? Relax, man. Just take it easy, man. - Oh, okay, Derek. - ( CROWD SHOUTING ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) -( BONE CRACKS ) - ( SCREAMS ) - Get the fuck off. - ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( YELLS ) You little bitch. - No. Ava, it's me. - MANNY: Let's go. DEREK: Manny, we got to go now. MANNY: Come on, come on, come on. All right, Ava. You're all right. Let's go. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Let's go, Manny. Come on, man. Come here. Come here. Come here. Get in. Get in. Get in. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) I'm fucking tired of this shit. I was just dancing with that con la chavala esta. MANNY: Yo, what the hell? I guess we're not going to that club tomorrow night, huh? You know that man that you just messed with? That's Big Biz, dude. That's a fucking bad hombre, dude. They better watch out for you, girl. You went crazy. Like fucking ninja fucking crazy. Manny, Manny, let it go. Drop it. ( SIGHS ) What the hell was that? Huh? I'm sorry. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) MAN: Best piece of advice I ever got... don't trust anybody. You hard like your old man? ( DOG BARKING ) Hmm? I got no problem with 15. I like 15. Sometimes the only way to defend yourself is to attack. Hold her down, God damn it. You just want to be harder, quicker, faster, dirtier than the next guy. You understand? ( SCREAMS ) Fucking bitch! Eventually you forget about the pain, forget about the fear. You remember the lesson. You understand me? - Too slow. - Get back here, fucking bitch! Most people have a limit they won't go beyond. You're going to learn to go beyond. You're going to learn to go beyond the limit. Fucking bitch. Fucking bitch. Somebody's going to put you down... you put them in the ground. ( BIRDS CHIRPING ) ( POUNDING ON DOOR) What time is it? I don't know. My God. -( POUNDING CONTINUES ) - All right. All right, I'll get it. ( POUNDING CONTINUES ) Coming, coming. - Manny? - Yeah, it's me. Just open the door, man. - Yo. - What? Big Biz from last night, he's on his way over with his boys, and he's not coming to apologize. How could they possibly know where we're staying? I don't know. Maybe the taxi driver told him or something. Just get your shit on. We're out of here. Seriously? Where the hell are we going to go, man? Huh? I'm just fucking with you. (LAUGHS) - Not cool. - I just had to get you guys up so we can get to the zip line in time. - Come on. - No. No, I'm not going. Yeah. No, when did we even agree to that? Vmonos, vmonos, vmonos. Safest place for you guys to be. We have to go, 'cause if we get there late, JoJo, the guy from the zip line, is going to leave us. ( MANNY LAUGHS ) (YELLING, LAUGHING ) - All right. - No. - Next. - You're next. - You're next. - Please. Oh, God. - All right, babe. - Oh, God. - You got it. All good. - Will you make sure this is-- Yeah. Everything's good here. All right. Just in case I don't see you again. Don't say that. Slow with the glove there, okay? Lean back and enjoy the ride. - There you go. - Oh, my God! Lean back! Lean back! Oh, my God. MANNY: Whoo! Don't look down, baby. You're here. You're here. You're here. Yeah. Look out. Look out. - Whah. - Huh. MANNY: Do it, man! Whoa. Oww! (LAUGHS) ( YELLS ) Yeah, brah. How was your trip? How was that, man? - How you feel? - Wow. That was awesome. - Ah, man... - That was awesome. ...you have not seen anything yet. What do you mean? Where we're going to go now, the real deal. El Viudador. - What does that mean? - The Widowmaker. - Widowmaker. -( LAUGHS ) MANNY: So here we are, El Viudador. - AVA: Oh, my God. - MANNY: Check this out. MANNY: It's amazing, isn't it? AVA: Oh, I don't think I can... MANNY: It's the longest zip line in the Caribbean. I can't-- I can't do this, babe. Don't. - Please. - Like, seriously you can't? - I don't think so. - Just sit back, enjoy the ride. - DEREK: Enjoy the ride. - Okay? - AVA: No. - Let's do it. - So I'm the only one going? - Yeah.

I don't know. I don't know. ( SIREN BLARING ) ( CAR HORNS HONK ) ( TIRES SQUEAL ) ( ENGINE SPUTTERS ) ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) No, no! I have to go to Centro Mdico. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( SIREN BLARING ) Excuse me. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. - ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) - Excuse me. My husband came in here, Derek Grant, about 20 or 30 minutes ago on the ambulance. Can you check your charts? ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) No, no, no. I'm fine. He's in much worse condition. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Please check a Derek Grant for me. Please. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) He's blond with blue eyes. RECEPTIONIST: American. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( PHONE RINGING ) You've reached Derek, but guess what? He is on his honeymoon. ( CONTINUES SPEAKING SPANISH ) You've reached Derek, but guess what? - No Derek Grant. - Is this Centro Mdico? - Are we here? - Si. Si. They-- they brought him here. The ambulance people gave me this card. - No. - My husband is here. They dropped him off. He got in an ambulance and came here. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) No Derek Grant here. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ls there another Centro Mdico? ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) GUARD: Sefiora, no! - ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) - Sefiora. Hello, sefiora. Escucheme, por favor. ( RINGING CONTINUES ) GUARD: Sefiora. ( GUARD SPEAKING SPANISH ) Please don't touch me. Get your hands off. Get-- please, ma'am. (WOMAN CRYING ) Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me. Estoy buscando a Derek Grant. - Here. - ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Est aqui. Can you check your charts? This is him. Is he here? Did he come in here by ambulance? No. Excuse me, ma'am. Por favor. Estoy buscando a Derek Grant. I'm looking for my husband. This is what he looks like. - Ma'am, have you seen him? - No. Can you please help me? - Hello. - Sandy, it's Ava. Oh, hi. What's going on? Has Derek called you? No. Why? What's wrong? Perdn. My husband is missing. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) No English? Do you speak English? No. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Yes. WOMAN: She call hospital for your husband. Okay? FATHER: Quit moving. Think you need my help, babe? Think you need anybody's help? ( CHUCKLES ) You don't. Only person you can rely on is your own self. Ah, this'll heal up. Survivors have scars. Losers have funerals. Scars is what you want. They're like tattoos, but with better stories, huh? Ava, you are made of the toughest stuff around. Don't you forget that, all right? ( PLANE ENGINE HUMMING ) And who called for the ambulance? I'm not sure. I think that his name was JoJo. That's what Manny called him. This Manny, he took you to the zip line? Yeah. He's on the left. - Last name? - I don't know. Where'd you meet him? At some restaurant on the beach. OFFICER: Some restaurant on the beach. Why didn't you ride in the ambulance with your husband? They wouldn't let me. They wouldn't let you? I think they said it was because of some insurance problem, but I tried. Did they say where they were taking him? I already told you this, Centro Mdico, Punta Cana. Punta Cana? Punta Cana. Okay. ( DOOR OPENS ) Excuse me. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Gracias. There's no record showing of your husband being admitted into any clinic or hospital on the island. Maybe he decided to not go. Okay, not 9Q? He was unconscious and his leg was completely sideways. How the hell is he not going to go? There's no activity on his credit card, no outgoing calls on his phone, so it's either dead or his battery's been taken out so it can't be tracked. Maybe the ambulance had an accident on the way to the hospital. Maybe it fell into a ditch and nobody was able to contact us or call, okay? I don't know, but we need to be out of here, out there, looking for him. Maybe we're not getting all the information that we need. What does that mean? Was anyone drinking? You know there wasn't any drinking. I have a right to ask. You already know the answer to that. Well, there are many ambulance companies on this island. They're unregulated, so it's highly competitive. First one on the scene gets paid. It's a wonderful island, but with opportunistic and dubious parties, everybody's trying to make a better standing for themself, especially when it comes at the expense of wealthy Americans. Then again, I could be wrong. If he was kidnapped, we should know something soon. I would say within the next... - 24 hours. - Oh, my God. So what's our next step? (YELLING, LAUGHING ) MAN: Well, we were closed yesterday. Actually, we're always closed on Monday. - So there was no one here. - AVA: No, no, I was here. I was here with my husband, Manny, and JoJo. No. No, sorry. We don't have any Manny or JoJo working here. Well, Manny doesn't work here. He said he was friends with the owner. I actually am the owner. Okay, the name of the zip line is called El Viudador. Nah, nah, nah. We don't call any of our lines El Viudador. - Are you sure it was here, 'cause-- - Yes, it was here. Well, we have a perfect safety record, and there are, like, four other line operations on the island which they don't run that way. Look, it was here. I remember the road in. I remember the fire station. I remember all of this. There's another zip line about 30 minutes from here with the same kind of road, and it looks exactly the same. Hey, wait. - JoJo, right? - Uh... You were here yesterday when my husband fell from the zip line, right? This is JoJo. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) He said he doesn't know who you are. Why are you lying? You called the ambulance. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) - Why are you lying? - Okay, okay, okay. Hey, hey. - We were here yesterday. - ( SPANISH CONTINUES) Admit that you were here. Admit that you were here. Okay. Okay. Let me handle this, okay? Let me handle this. Okay, so maybe he thinks he's getting in trouble. Maybe you think you're getting in trouble, he got paid off. I don't know. Listen, you don't understand. It wasn't here, okay? - You are scaring my clients. - It was here. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Okay, okay, look. - Let's go back to my office. - No! Let's talk about the next step here, okay? - Get him back! - No, no. We gotta go. - ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) - Let's go. We need to go. - Please, please, please. - Listen. Listen to me. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) AVA: That was him. That was JoJo. Fine. Yes, we'll go back, and we'll talk about it at the office. Everything okay. Everything is safe. You're going to enjoy-- enjoy yourself so far? Have a seat. Let's talk about Sunday night. I got an e-mail sent to me of video footage from Club la Sola. And apparently you have a really violent side to you. You on drugs? Because you nearly killed this guy. I was defending myself. Why didn't you say anything about that? 'Cause I didn't see how this has got anything to do with Derek's disappearance. You sure about that? Gracias. So you got into a tangle with a guy named Big Biz. You know, he makes people disappear. Then why aren't you interviewing him? We will. So how were you and your husband getting along? We're great. I understand you're the main beneficiary of all his assets. I'm his wife. What are these? Sketches. Why aren't they being distributed? Because they look like half the men on the island and I have to appropriately allocate my resources. Yeah, what exactly are you doing with your resources? Right now, talking to you. If you're not going to look for my husband, I will. - Let's go. - What happened? ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Have you seen him? No. - No. - No. Have you seen this man? Derek. Derek! Stop! Stop! Derek! ( TIRES SQUEAL ) - Hola, sexy. - Como estas? Oh, no, sorry. Wrong car. I'm going to make some pasta. Do you want some? No. No, thanks. Ava, you haven't eaten in two days. Maybe just some water. ...Derek Grant, who disappeared three days ago. The couple were on their honeymoon on the island. All previous leads have been dismissed as attempts to cash in on the considerable reward money. Did anyone call? You're not really expecting any calls, are you, Ava? - What? - What really happened? What aren't you telling us? You think there's something I'm not telling you? I think there's a great deal you're not telling us. Dad. Maybe something went down in that bar and Derek got killed. Maybe somebody wanted to kill you... and killed him instead. Maybe you guys just kind of... fell off the program and things got violent. I don't know. But I do know that you are the reason he's gone. And I think you're trying to tap into my finances. ( SIGHS ) I don't give a shit about your finances, Mr. Grant, but I love your son. I love him more than I've loved anything in my entire life, and I always will. But fuck you. ( DOOR SLAMS ) I'm sorry. - Ready? Si? - Si. Yay! ( LAUGHS ) ( LAUGHS, SPEAKING SPANISH ) Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. - What? Lady, no. - Hey, JoJo. You need to wait a minute. - She's going first. - Remember me? Oh, shit. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Let's find someplace more private to talk. No, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Fuck! Shit! Whoa! No, no, no, no! No' no' no, Nos no; no! Nos no; no! Nos no; no! Nos no; no! No, no, no, No, no, no. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Okay, JoJo, you're gonna start telling me some information or else you're going to die. Do you understand that? Look at me. What happened to my husband? I don't know, lady. - You want to drop? - No! No. Did you take me and my husband zip-lining? Look at me. Did you take me and my husband zip-lining? - Yeah. - Why'd you lie to the cops about it? I don't-- Manny. Manny told us to be quiet. Manny. Manny told us that they were very dangerous. Who was dangerous? Who is dangerous? I don't know. I don't know what-- Listen, you want to drop, motherfucker? - No. No! No, no. - Okay. Look at me. Who called the ambulance? Manny called. Manny called the ambulance, so he knows-- he knows everything. - AVA: Okay, okay. - I have his number. AVE: All right. All right, what's his number? It's 809-555-310... I tried his cell phone. it went straight to voice mail, but it's definitely Manny's voice. You believe me now? Manny knows where Derek is. We need to find Manny. Let's go. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) - Turn around. - What? Turn around. Let's go find my husband. Hey! ( OVERLAPPING CHATTER IN SPANISH ) Get off me! Maybe you can torture people in America to get a confession out of them, but not here. And I'm going to let you leave here with some dignity intact. Officer Santos is going to take you back to Puerto Rico. You are no longer welcome on this island. Do you understand that? ( FERRY HORN BLOWING ) Excuse me, sir. I have to go to the bathroom. ( SPEAKS SPANISH ) El bafio, por favor. Pronto. Vamos. Are you going to take my handcuffs off? Well, you're going to have to come in here and help me. ( URINATING ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) Can you get me some tissue? (GRUNTS) ( HANDCUFFS CLICKING ) ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( GASPING ) So my boyfriend thought it'd be funny to throw me in the pool. ( SPEAKS SPANISH ) - Si. - Okay. I'm going to kill him. ( LAUGHS) Let me check you. You alone? Let's hope so. ( DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ) (SINGING IN SPANISH ) J' Looking so good in your work clothes J' J' What time do you get out? J' J' 'Cause I'm trying to have a small conversation J' J' And I'm about to hear what you let out J' J' I like the way you make me work for it J' J' So take your time getting to know me, know me J' J' Why you making me work for it?

I'm here-- here illegally! I can't talk to the cops or they'll send me back. Oh, you're going to wish you were back home. I swear! Oh, God, I don't know anything about your husband! - Where's Derek? - I don't know! - ( GASPING ) - Who called the ambulance? Look, I did, but when I called, they said that someone else had already called. - Who? - I don't know. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) -( POUNDING ) ' ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) -(COUGHS) - Who are these guys? - Who are your buddies? - I don't know. What is that? What is that? It's a tattoo that one of the paramedics had. - This guy has that tattoo. - That's their fucking neighborhood. That's "TS." Territo rio-- Tierra Sindicato. They run that shit. Like, everybody knows that. Police, the politicians, even the putas know that. If you're fucking with me, things are going to get nasty. Nastier than this shit? -( POUNDING ) ' ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) - You're not safe here. - Tell me something I don't know. Ah! If you want me to help you find Derek, you have to do exactly what I say. ( POUNDING CONTINUES ) ( DOG BARKING ) ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Over here. This is my room. ( DOG BARKING ) So you live with your mom. I came over first and made enough money to bring her over. There's not enough work, the island that we come from, except for the fucking drugs. Tomorrow, you're going to take me to Otrabanda, and we're going to work together to find this guy. They say that if a person isn't found within the first few days, - the likelihood of them-- - No, don't. Please don't. Just don't. I'm sorry. Derek is alive and I'm going to do whatever it takes to get him back. You should probably understand that. I do, so relax. You should get some rest. Just get in there. Go on. MANNY: This place, there's no law, there's no mommy, there's no daddy, okay? Everything you see is not really what it is. Everybody here is just trained to be unwelcoming. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) No. Everybody here is off the grid. They're either not from here, or they been let go by everyone. Stay here, okay? Hold on. Hold on. Hold up. Hold up. - What? - That's it. That's it. - What's what? What? - Stop. Go back. Go back. Why do you-- what is it? Just stop. This is not-- this is a bad neighborhood. - That's it. That's it. - What is what? - That's his tattoo. - What's what? The paramedic, the one with gold teeth, that is his tattoo. Look. What's this? That's where they-- they do the cockfights and stuff. I know where it is. Let's go. - All right, let's go. - Let's get out. No, no, no, no, no. Don't get out, okay? Just give me the flier. Okay. Stay here.

( SIREN BLARING ) ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) ( CAT HISSES ) ( SIREN BLARING ) ( DOG BARKING ) (ARGUING IN SPANISH ) ( BARKING CONTINUES ) ( SHOUTS ) (GRUNTS) ( GROANS ) -( INSECTS CHIRPING ) - ( MAN GROANS) You and your partner took my husband in your ambulance. Where did you take him? I don't drive an ambulance. ( SCREAMS ) My father was not a well-educated man, but he did know a little something about the human anatomy. He showed me where all the vital organs are. You have the wrong guy. See, the tummy is squishy. It's got the colon, the small intestine. It's the squishy stuff that's hard to puncture. Puta! Where is my husband? I told you I don't know anything. ( COUGHS ) Maybe I should just go for your spleen. ( SCREAMS ) Oh, but you can live without your spleen, can't you? Where's my husband? I don't know. Or I could go for your liver. Puncturing it would probably make you bleed out in five or six minutes. Okay, okay, okay. ( GROANS ) Okay, this girl was texting me. I got dropped off. I don't know what happened after that. I swear. Next day, Omar shows up with a bunch of money, told me to quit my job and not to say anything, so I did it. Okay, I did it! You're looking for Omar, not me. It's him you're looking for, not me! ( GROANS ) What are you doing? What are you doing? - I'm texting your brother. - He'll fucking kill you. You tried. How'd that work out for you? ( CAR RADIO PLAYING MUSIC ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( SPEAKS SPANISH ) ( DOG BARKING ) Tito? ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Remember me? Bet you do. ( GASPING ) Now you're going to tell me where my husband is. Where is my husband? ( BOTH GRUNTING ) (GUNSHOT) ( SIRENS BLARING ) Look, if you break into someone's house and assault them, they have every right to use deadly force to defend themselves. Tito admitted to taking my husband in the ambulance. - He's in on it. - In on what? I don't know. He said he got paid. Let her out. Let's go. Let's go. I'll tell you what I think. I think you paid those two guys, who are admittedly not choirboys, to kill your husband, and then you silenced them so that they wouldn't implicate you. You know, from the beginning, the only violence and wrongdoing that I've witnessed has been perpetrated by you and only you. You are being held for the murder of Omar Tavarez and the attempted murder of Tito Tavarez. And you are now officially the prime suspect in the disappearance and probable murder of your husband, so you know what? A bath, a shower, and a lawyer, whatever order you want, that's what you need. Look, fine. Take me. My husband's alive. You need to find him. He's still out there. He's alive. I'm taking you to headquarters... - Please, please, look at me. - ...for interrogation. - Put her in. - My husband's alive. Yeah, well, we're going to transfer you over to headquarters for the interrogation. Derek's father and sister have requested that you be charged with a capital offense. Please find my husband for me. Please do your job. Good luck. My husband is alive. ( DRIVER SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( LAUGHS ) We're not going to police headquarters, are we? (LAUGHS) ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) OFFICER: Come on. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) - ( CRACKS ) " ( GROANS ) ( CRACKS ) - Andale. - Whew. -( BONE CRACKS ) - ( YELLS ) No! (GRUNTING ) No! ( CRICKETS CHIRPING ) ( PHONE BUZZING ) Ava? Why don't you come to your daughter's room and we can have a little talk. - Please, don't. - Shh. Keep your voice down. You don't want to wake your daughter. Gun. Sit. My family-- Your family? Let's talk about your family. What would you be willing to do? Where would you be willing to go? Look, it was me. I did this. You don't understand. I owe him. Who? Abelard. The doctor from Villa Jaragua Clinic. Look, he did something for me, okay? She was too young and he just made sure the family didn't find out about her pregnancy. I owe him everything. If my wife and kids ever found-- Yeah, you're a real family man. I can see that. Where's my husband? The doctor, he made a mistake. He tried to set his bone... and he punctured his femoral artery. He tried to save him. Look, he asked me-- he begged me to cover it up. Otherwise, the Americans would make sure his clinic was finished. He wanted to make it seem like he never made it to the clinic at all. You've been lying to me this whole time? You knew my husband was dead? And you tried to have me killed? You need to go. Please don't do this, not in front of my family, my daughter. Please, I understand, okay? I don't deserve to live. I'm a bad man. Please, not here. You have two options. One... two. One of these is quiet. We can go to the bathroom. I'll make sure your wife finds you and not your kid. (CRYING ) What the hell happened to you? He's gone. He's gone. I'm sorry. ( KETTLE WHISTLES ) Derek showed up when I could have-- he saved me. He changed me. You changed you. He just gave you a reason. I have to finish this. When all the bastards are gone and dead, only then rest your head. Caray, that's cheery. ( SCOFFS ) Where's that from? I heard it every night before I went to sleep. That's a pretty shitty lullaby. I can help you. No, you can't. I have to do this on my own. What the hell happened to your hand? You should-- you should go see a doctor. I plan to first thing tomorrow. ( GASPING ) Please check a Derek Grant for me. Please. No Derek Grant. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) You have a limited amount of oxygen, so I want you to listen to me carefully. I want to know what happened to my husband. He's the American with the broken leg. I want to know how he died and what happened to his body. Are you ready to tell me everything I need to know? I don't know what you're talking about. - I have no idea what-- - Really? Derek Grant. Garza, the little girl, the pregnancy. Please, I just need to know. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Fine. Fine. All right. Espere. Espere. Wait. You don't understand. You don't know what you're asking for. Really? Because I think it's pretty fucking simple. ( BUZZER SOUNDS ) Wait. Wait. I think you're going to find out more than you ever wished to know. Take a look. Take a look. You told Garza he's dead. No, wait. I can help you. You pull that trigger and your husband is going to be dead for sure. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Muy bien. Kristy. Kristy. Silvio Lugo. What happened to your hand? Got it caught in a door. - Stupid door. - Right? Yeah. I'm going to need to search you. ( SNIFFS ) ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( CELL PHONE BEEPING ) Call me. ( MONITORS BEEPING ) There he is. How you feeling, my man? Huh? Ready to give some of that miracle milk? You're my golden ticket. ( MEN LAUGH ) - Doc, what are you waiting for? - Some anesthesia. OH! NO: no; no, I10, I10, I10. My man can handle it. Can't you, papi? Yeah, fuck that. Go. That's it. Get him all nice and clean. ( GASPS ) Perdn. But you're so cute, I don't care. It's all good. You can do anything you want. -(LAUGHS) - That's it. Show me, Doc. ( GROANS ) SILVIO: Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay, papi. You can handle it. - ( GROANING ) - Ah, there you go. There you go. - ( GROANING CONTINUES ) - SILVIO: It's okay. That's it. You're doing a good job, bro. Doing a great job. That's it, Bubba. That's it. Good boy. That's a good boy. Come on, Doc, give me that. SILVIO: Yeah. That's what I like to see... a real fountain of life. Thank you, papi. ( SILVIO CHUCKLES ) Ah, fuck. Trying to put me to sleep? Doc, where'd you find this girl? ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Nobody fucking move. - Put your fucking hands up! - Hey, hey. Give me the gun. Down. - ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) - Get the fuck down. - ( MEN SPEAKING SPANISH ) - AVA: Gun. SILVIO: Who the fuck are you? I'm his wife. Oh. So you're the girl my man here has been speaking so highly of. ( MAN GROANS ) Whoa! Whoa! Was that necessary? All this violence. Seriously, we're all helping each other here. Your husband has been a real lifesaver, you know? I have this rare type of cancer. - Multiple myeloma. - Yeah, yeah. That's it. And the only effective treatment are these stem cell transfusions from bone marrow. You know, I pay the doctor here good money to find me donors, but it ain't easy, is it, Doc? Stay back! Hey, Kristy, you need to learn more Spanish, baby. Listen, I can call some of my men, the ones you haven't shot already, and they can help you find your way out. I can find my own way out. Are you sure? It's a big building. You know what? Thank you, Kristy, for sharing your husband. (GUNFIRE) ( GROANS ) ( SCREAMS ) We're going to get you out of here, okay? So... what you been up to, huh? ( ELEVATOR RUMBLES ) I'm going to need you to help me, okay? Yeah. Okay. All right. ( DISTANT VOICES SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( FOOTSTEPS ECHOING ) Wait a minute. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( SCREAMING ) Shoothen SILVIO: You guys suck, motherfuckers. SILVIO: Easy, easy. Keep this on him. I can pay you for all you've done. I should have offered you money up front, but people are so selfish when it comes to donating their body parts. I just couldn't take the risk when it's so hard to find a bone marrow of a donor whose tissue's a perfect match. You know, with your husband's bone marrow and my strict diet-- ( GROANS ) Bro, your girl hits hard. Where you going to run, little rabbit? You realize you're on an island? My island. Things are going to end up badly for you guys, seriously. Tell me, Derek, do you even know how to use one of those things? ( SCREAMING ) - Apparently I do. - Conyo! You two motherfuckers are crazy. ( TIRES SQUEAL ) AVA: Do you see anyone? ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) -( HORN HONKING ) - Right there. Go left. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) Right there in the yellow dress. - Go left right there. - Got it. Come on. Come on. Come on. ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) Where's this next kid? Right there. Right there. Right there. Pink shirt, next right. ( BOYS LAUGH ) ( SHOUTING IN SPANISH ) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's go. Get out of the car. Whoa, whoa. Come on. Come on. All right. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( GUNSHOTS ) I know where you live! ( GUNSHOTS ) I'm going to find you! ( SPEAKS SPANISH ) Si. Si.

Hey, come, come, come. ( MOTHER SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH ) - Shit. You've been shot. - What? What? Come here. No, no, no. Come here. You sit down. DEREK: Damn it. - ( MOTHER SPEAKING SPANISH ) - Shh, shh, shh. We can't stay here. It's not safe. Where is safe? -( HORN HONKING ) - ( SHOUTING IN SPANISH ) Hey! ( WHISTLES ) Hey!

Let me go. We can't have tourists being kidnapped to prolong the life of this piece of shit. Give me the knife. Give me the knife. This doesn't concern you, cabrn. It does! It concerns my business! What business? Fucking putas and gambling business? Yes! My putitas can't work without tourists! And we're going to gamble by ourselves? Give me the knife. Give me the knife. Give it to me. Come on. That's right. Aren't you dying, L119')? - Aren't you dying now? Huh? - Yeah. Correction... ( CROWD GASPING ) ...you're dead. - Derek! - Let him go. Let him go! Are you okay? Are you okay? Okay. You, it's time for you to go home where you belong. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) All right, that's my friend Carlos. He'll be taking you to Puerto Rico soon. And keep the shirt, bro. Brought me good luck.
