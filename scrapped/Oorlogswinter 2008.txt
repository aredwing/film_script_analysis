We found this boy near the crashed plane. I expect better manners from a mayor's son. You're right. It won't happen again. Michiel? Michiel! He wasn't alone. Who was the other boy? He says he was on his own. You shouldn't upset the Germans now. I'm supposed to suck up to them too? BICYCLES NAZl Schafter. What's that? - It was in the plane. Did you say anything? No. Theo! You have to help Dad. I'm so glad you're here. You had to go? - Yes, raids for the work camps. How are you, Michiel? - Fine. Can he sleep in my room? - I don't know if Uncle Ben wants to. Can I put this in the attic? I'll do that. (resistance paper) How is school? - It's closed. The law of the what? The lair of the beast. The lion's den. No, I can't help you. You know where they are. You can't ask me that. I bring a case of ration cards and you want them thrown in the river? You let your own people starve because you have to be neutral! Weakling. Michiel? Can you help me? No time. I have to go to Caesar. Hi Dirk. - Hi. Can I have a word? - No time, he has to go to Caesar. Sucker. Thanks for keeping your mouth shut yesterday. Did you get in trouble? - No, not much. Can you deliver this if I'm not back tonight? - Why shouldn't you be back? If I don't, take this letter to Bertus van Gelder. You can do that. - Not if it goes wrong. What are you going to do? Swear not to tell anyone. No one. We're taking out the ammunition depot at Lagezande. One, two... Let's try it. May I? What is it? - Soup! Can't you taste it? Watch out or I'll shop you to the Germans. Michiel. Come with your mother. Left... ...turn... ...backwards. Dad! Let me look. Now it's my turn. Why do they want the neighbours? You laugh with the Germans. Laugh? Wasn't Dirk here today? Did he say anything? No. He took part in a raid. The Germans were waiting for them. Two dead and Dirk's been arrested. Michiel. No. No, he didn't say anything. What a fuss. Theo's your best friend, isn't he? And do you know his brother Dirk well? It was pretty tough, wasn't it? You know what will happen to him now? If I notice you getting involved in the war, I'll knock your head off. Clear? Hey, Bertus. I have something for you. Dirk Knopper came yesterday... Ah, Michiel. Caesar need a new horseshoe, right front. End of the afternoon. - Can't you do it earlier? End of the afternoon. Schafter was first. Michiel! You heard about Dirk? - He's been arrested? I have to stay with Grandma. Mum thinks it's too dangerous. You're lucky with your dad. They won't harm you. Dagdaler Woods. Old hunting cabin. He's been arrested. When I come back, I'll whistle this. No, Bertus just ran away. That was stupid. If you run, they're allowed to shoot you? - I mean he didn't have a chance. What shall we do? We can't just let this happen? Who's in the resistance here? - Not again, Ben. I can't help. You don't want to. You'd rather talk to Krauts. I want everyone to survive the war safe. If you know how, go ahead. But not in my village. "Your" village? You have no power. You proved that today. Michiel. Where did you come from? Where did you get that? Rule one in wartime: keep your mouth shut. Not hungry? - It's German. It might be poisoned. Uncle Ben. The Germans at the ferry drink tea every day at 3 o'clock. An acquaintance has to cross tomorrow. - I saiI all day. He has to cross at 3 o'clock. What do you have for me? What do you mean? As long as it's edible. Okay. See you tomorrow. You can have more later. That's Michiel, our youngest. Michiel, this is Aunt Cora and ehm... ...Janneke. Janneke from Amsterdam. Will you cut some firewood? Michiel. Why do I always have to? She never does I'm already busy. You can do something. Michiel. Give me a hand. Hold that leg. I've seen Grandpa do it. But I'm making a mess. Watch this. Right. Hang it for a few days and we have a feast. With grateful thanks to the Nazis. - Meat is meat, Michiel. Or would you rather have soup again? ...Jesus Christ and God the father... Great, we lost our room. I never heard of Aunt Cora before. But Hanneke? - Janneke. Hey! MichieI. Erika... Michiel, now I want to know where we're going. To a patient. - Who? I don't have time for your games. Michiel! - The less you know the better. Well... You're a long way from home. We ran out of wood. I'm going back. Look for someone else! Is there water and a bowl here? This is going to hurt. Come on, let's go. Yes. Of course. Does Dad know about this? - No, of course not! But he has to know. What if they find him? - They won't if you keep quiet. Michiel! - I take care of Jack and you shut up. More hot water? What d'you want of me? What are you up to? Hey, what did I tell you? You won't? - I didn't say that. I'll take care of it. What are you doing here? Jack is my patient. Jack is mine! I'll take care of him. - You want him to die? How is he? The fever has dropped. What are you going to do? - None of your business. If I can help... - Get lost, that helps. Come on. Hurry. The ferry leaves at 3 o'clock. "Bastard"... - "Bastard"? Your sister is a reaI "bastard"... Come on. Hurry. Michiel? Are you okay? Help lay the table. - It's Erica's turn. You can help though. How is Jack? The woods are full of Krauts! Is he safe? Where is Jack? I lost him. Van Beusekom speaking. Yes. Yes. Call me when you know more. They found a dead soldier. Where? - Dagdaler Woods. A German? - Yes. He'd been there for some time. Shot. Now they want the culprit. Michiel. What d'you know about that dead German? Nothing. You will be careful? If there's anything I can do... There's nothing. The package is on its way. We'll go to Zwolle when the Germans leave the woods. Tomorrow or maybe the day after. They found a German in the woods. Dead. What happened? Has he asked about me? What did you talk about? - Just things. I'll help you. Give me the razor. Try it yourself. Carefully. Don't cut yourself. Not too hard. And hold it at an angle. We have to do it differently. Dad. Look after yourself. I have to know. He's my husband! Where's Uncle Ben? There's no time to cry. Do something! - They won't say where he is. Michiel, please. We can't leave him, do something! - We don't know where he is. Vught, Amersfoort. Prison in Deventer. He's at the town hall. Here? In the village? Stay polite Michiel. That helps best. Good morning. I would like to see my husband. Van Beusekom. I'm sorry. I can't let you in. - I have brought clothes and food. Thank you. I'll make sure... - I want to give it to him myself. Please. I'm sorry. I really can't let you in. Stay there. I have to see my husband. - Impossible. He hasn't done anything. He hasn't! I know he hasn't done anything. Don't be so difficult! Johan! Johan! All I ask is to speak to him. Johan! Aha. The mayor's son again. I can't remember inviting you. Get lost! Well? Bomb the town hall. - Dad will like that. Then we have to attack. Come on! What else? We have to do something. We can't just leave him! I'll see what I can do. - I'll go with you. No. Stay with your mother. Look after her. Be careful. Uncle Ben. I'Il do my best. I promise. Uncle Ben. Mum, where is Erica? Mum? Erica! They're not. No. Dad will be free. Uncle Ben will help. All on his own? - Who says he is alone? Let's go home. Mum is alone. No. That's not necessary. You'll get shot. You die. He'll be freed tomorrow. I did all I could. Michiel? Right turn! Order arms. Let go of me. I know who did it. Are you coming? Michiel? Is he coming too? Of course. Then I won't go. - Michiel. It's his fault. It was the Germans. Not Uncle Ben. God save the Queen. Jesus. That's for Jack. He has to be moved, Michiel. I want to ask Uncle Ben... - No. Tomorrow he can take the ferry at 3 o'clock. That's safe. He has to go to Zwolle. Sorry. Michiel. Can we help maybe? Claus, you take the left. Push it under... One, two and push! Come on out. You have to help! He doesn't speak German. Ah! Schafter! Give us a hand! What's wrong with the wheel? - No idea how to fit it. Let me have a go. Lower it slowly... I decide when we go. Come on. Germans shot him. Not you. Sarah! Sarah! Inside, quick. British military, here in the shed? A kid from the RAF? He has to leave as quickly as possible. What's the plan? Michiel? Who's in charge? Me... You didn't involve anyone else? You don't know what you're up to, do you? From now on throw snowballs or bully girls. I'll take over. Erica, Jack's gone. Michiel. There are checks everywhere. Michiel... - What? Go on then! Bastard... Ah, here you are. Fortunately it's nearly all over. Dirk should never have used you. See you later. Okay? I never mentioned Dirk... In the Name of the German People. Michiel! - Bastard. Michiel, put it down. - "Dirk should never have used you. " I never mentioned Dirk. I didn't tell anyone. He told me about the raid. He was arrested. He also talked about Bertus. He was arrested too. Look, he works for the Germans. The Russians will be here soon. Then we'll see who's occupier and who's liberator. Michiel. Can have a cigarette? Where's that resistance of yours? Hey. Michiel. Michiel, I want to make a deaI. Let me go and I'll leave Jack alone. - Oh, just like Dirk and Bertus? Terrible things happen in all wars. - And Dad? I had your father free. Shut up! - Really. I arranged it. They'd take someone else at random. But your father refused. It was his choice. Think about it, Michiel. I'm a bastard, but I'm your uncle. I always protected you. Your father was going to help me. Stand up. Stand up. Germans. Mum! Michiel! Here you are. Why don't you go outside? Why don't you come to the party? You want a go?
