 

                        All my life, I always wanted to fly. I always wanted to live like a hawk. I know you're not supposed to be jealous of anything, but... to take flight, to soar above everything and everyone, now that's living. So, we'll burn 15 seconds off the clock, and we'll end this thing our way in his house. We stack it up. I want Odin, Michael and Billy to handle the ball. Hugo, you and Todd set up the screens. At 13 seconds, we run the Tulsa play for Odin. Give me that. Todd, you're in the stack with Michael. Hugo? Hugo! You're at the right elbow. Billy, you're at the low block on the weak side. And remember, lads. Hugo and Todd are decoys. Decoys! I don't want to see either one of those guys with the ball. At 13 seconds, we free up Odin for the one on one, then clear! If it's not Odin, Michael. Put them in. What time is it, team? Game time! Rah! All right, let's focus! Move, move! Good passes. I want good passes! Keep it tight. Tight! Go, go, go! Take the ball! - Tulsa! - Tulsa! Don't stop! Don't stop! Don't stop! Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Yes! Yes! Yes! Coach Duke Goulding! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. All right. Odin, would you come down here, please? As you all know, I am a man of few words. Except for when one of us is late for practice, right, Pop? I'll pretend I don't know who said that, Hugo. I'll get right to the point. By virtue of having won our divisional championship, as well as having the best record in the league, we will have home court advantage in the State Championship, all the way up to, and including, the semi-finals. And one reason for that is this young man standing next to me. And I'll tell you something else too- and I'm very proud to say this publicly. I love him like my own son. Not only is he a shoe-in for this year's USA Today high school All American, but he is going to lead this team to the 20th State Championship in the 115 year history of this institution! You can stay on your feet, 'cause at this time, I am very proud to present this year's unanimous choice for most valuable player to Mr. Odin James. Congratulations. You know, at the beginning of the season, we decided to go all the way. And I did give it all I had, but that wouldn't have meant nothing if I didn't have a go-to guy. Big Mike, come up here, man. Come on, now's not the time to be shy. Come on. I told the coach I wasn't accepting the MVP award unless the "man with the hands" could share it with me. That's for you, baby. It's all you, baby. I don't understand. Are you going to get Desi and I together? - She's with him. - They're breaking up. When people are breaking up, they don't grind. Those two are definitely grinding. We're going to break them up. I thought you were his friend. You hang out with him all the time. And that's perfect, 'cause if we're going to do this, I've got to act like I'm cool with him anyway. Look, you know what a utility man is? A what? I'm considered a utility man. I rebound, I can shoot. I play guard, forward, power forward. You name the position, I fucking play it. - What's your point? - The point is, I'm the MVP on this piece of shit team. I've been banging in the paint and setting screens for the past four years, and he chooses Michael. Fucking sophomore! No way! Look at this shit. - Roger, don't wuss out on me now. - He'll boot me out of school. We are two blocks away from the Roger Calhoon Senior Library. Your father is this fucking institution. Do you want Desi or not? - Yes? - Uh, hi. Dean Brable? Yes. Who is this? I don't know how to tell you this, sir, but someone sort of stole something from you. What are you talking about? Your daughter. What about my daughter? We're going to run them until they drop dead or we drop dead! And that means pressing on defense too. And by the way, my friend, Hugo, your ass was dragging in the fourth quarter. Either you get back to your position on the traps, - or you give me some reason why. - I'll be all right. You got to be better than all right, son! Everybody look at me, not him! This goes for you! On your feet, gentlemen. Good afternoon, Dean. You're welcome here. Good afternoon. And I have a witness who says he forced himself on her. What? Who? Look, if Desi says that I did anything even close to wrong to her, - I'll leave the goddamn school. OK? - Take it easy, son. Bob, that's a very serious allegation. - You say you have a witness? - Come on, there's no witness. I would never do anything like that. Ever. You're telling me you never had any run-ins with the police? No, it means I didn't force myself on Desi. That's not what I just asked you. What are you trying to say? - You know what I'm saying. - You're saying I'm not clean? Is that what you're sayin'? Cause I'm not on that shit no more. Come on, coach, you know this. I mean, test my ass. Test me. This is fucked up. This is fucked up. And a lot of the things I hear you say about Desi are fucked up. - Bob. - Don't underestimate me, son. Don't underestimate me when it comes to my daughter. Hey, Bob! Please, please! Back off! Now, come on. Please. If you were so worried about me, how come this school busted its ass to get me here? Because you were worth it! Yes? Come in, sweetheart. Please, sit down over here. D, you've got to tell these guys what's going on. - We know what's going on. - We've got to be reasonable. Now, come on. Honey... we've never had any secrets before, right? I just want you to tell me the truth. Did Odin ever harm you, force you to do anything that you didn't want to do? Anything at all? Odin and I have been together for four months. "Together"? What does that mean, "together"? Dad, that's none of your business. I asked you a question. And I said it's none of your business. Listen, Bob, this is a family matter. Maybe we shouldn't be discussing it here. I mean, he's a good kid. Don't do this. Talk to him. Let's give him a chance to talk. Outside. Sir, I just want to tell you that you've got a great daughter there. And I really, really care about her. You've got to understand that what we have is beautiful. No. She deceived me. What makes you think she won't do the same to you? If you ever lie on me again, I'll fuck your punk ass up a lot worse than this. You understand me, Rog? Huh? See you at dinner. You're going to keep doing this shit all year, yo? You tell me, man. You're the pharmacist. You know, some of these drugs I sell will guarantee to have you twisted up. This steroid, 50-50 chance. I put three inches on my vertical this month. I took half a second off my 40, bro'. It's doing the job. When you start playing for North Carolina, don't forget about me. Shoot the nigger some tickets. I'm talking about court side. We're going to cycle you to something else next week. You've been drinking enough water? By the gallon, man. I'm surprised it doesn't come out these holes you keep sticking in me. I know you're all into this basketball stuff, but if it don't work, don't trip. I'm saying cause there's some things in life we weren't meant to have. I mean, don't go out there making yourself all crazy and shit. How can I go crazy when I've got you selling me dream in a bottle, man? So, have you talked to him about it? There's nothing to talk about. I do everything for him, but he's been acting completely weird lately. Lately? Try always. Sorry. What's the deal? Everyone at school likes Hugo, except you. Nobody doesn't like him. I don't trust anyone who doesn't have at least one enemy. Well, I guess he does. I didn't think you were going to make it. Oh, come on now. You know I can't beat Magnolia tomorrow without seeing my good luck charm first. - What's up, Em? - Hey. Hey, I've got something for you. It's over 100 years old. It's over your price range is what it is. It was my great-grandmother's and it's always been in my family. It's supposed to stay that way, but... I feel like we're already family. Yo, Em, don't think I forgot you. I got the new Harlem's Finest for you, baby. Enjoy that, all right? Come on, Emily's here. I know. We're not going to do anything. I just like feeling your skin next to mine, okay? Come on. My father's a smart man. But he's never actually been through anything. He acts like he's in control all the time, but really he's just scared. You never seem scared to me. Are you asking me how I got that scar on my back? You do have the best stories. I was a C-section baby and they cut too far. My mom couldn't afford a good doctor. Are you serious? I fell off my skateboard. Are you crazy? I get scared all the time. - You do not. - Yes, I do. When? When? Okay. The first time I tried to talk to you, I thought I was going to faint, or something. That's not true. The second sentence out of your mouth was, "Do you still have a boyfriend?" I said I was scared. I never said I couldn't handle the pressure. You know I've got them player skills. Oh, Ladies and Gentlemen he's getting a little cocky. Don't say "Iittle" and "cocky" in the same sentence when it comes to me. Especially when you know the deal. Shut up! No, but you really think I'm too cocky? No, it's okay. You should be. - You pulled me, didn't you? - Yes, I did. Yes, indeed, I did. I don't know how, but you did it. What do you mean, you don't know how? I pulled you 'cause I'm that kind of nigger. Uh-oh. Don't be acting like that. See, I can say "nigger" cause I am a nigger. You can't 'cause you ain't. Don't be jealous. And why can't I say it? My people invented the word. You can't even think it. You're the one who started it. You said I was so fine you'd let me dress you up and play Black Buck Got Loose in the Big House. Don't go repeating that, all right? If another Black person knew I said that, I could get my suffering-Negro- league card revoked. Then you'd better watch out, because I've got some dirt on you, player. Got some dirt on me, huh? You better not let that leak. And now, your year 2000... low country preparatory league champion, Palmetto Grove Hawks! Push! Push! Shit. Injured on the floor. Palmetto Grove's number four, Odin James. - Is he okay? - They're doing a CAT scan right now, so we'll see. Don't worry. Edmund, did you bring the insurance card? - I've got the card. - So we're covered? Mickey gets more kisses from my girl than I do. Could you stop being a sarcastic asshole just once? I was joking, all right? Relax. What's the deal? I'm gone for a couple of hours and you're already taking my girl, Big Mike? - What's up, dude? - You get right home and get some rest. I will, man. What's up, baby? I was worried about you. You were the one who got hurt, stupid. No, you don't understand. I was worried that if I hurt myself, who was going to take care of you over there at Duke? Oh, right, right. You're still going to play "Big House" with me, though, right? Hey, stop it with that. Then you better stop getting hurt. - I love you. - I love you too. You kids need to get back to the dorms. Let's go, Hugo. I'm going to give a shout at the boys, all right? - Mike. - Hey, man. - We did our thing today, bro'. - Yeah, we did good. What's up, Em? How are you doing? Hugo. Thought we lost you there for a second, bro. I ain't going nowhere. But did we take it to them or what? You took it to them by yourself. You know that, player. You're coming to that party off campus? Yeah, I need to get a ride with my dad, though. All right, man. Don't take too long. Later, Hugo. Come on, don't worry. He'll get there. Yeah, Roger. We've got plans tonight, man. When I passed out, I think I had a vision. Have you ever ridden on the handlebars on one of your friends' bikes before? Yeah. Well, I used to ride on the bars and try to close my eyes. I could never do it. It's some scary shit, cause you've got... to try to trust the other person not to crash. You're tripping me out right now. I feel like I can close my eyes with you. Look... we're 18, and personally, I'm not trying to get married by some Elvis impersonator in Vegas, but... I figured maybe we could pretend for a while, you know? That is the sweetest thing I've ever heard. Oh, yeah! Now we're feeling good, huh? Go get them, tiger. Now go out there and you find that girl. - Time to pull some weeds. - Just for the record,... why am I doing this again? Because this is how you get Desi's attention. Now get your honky ass in gear. It's about team work. Hey. - Excuse us, Roger. - Excuse you? We're talking. What, are you diagramming some basketball plays? What did you say? I don't care if your father owns the whole fucking school. Shit. Excuse me. Roger! Take it easy, big guy. - Not so tough, now, are you? - Hey, Rog! What are you talking about? Stop it! Your shooting ability isn't helping you now, is it? Take it easy, pal. Back it off. Stop it, man. Come on. That's enough. Oh my God, Roger. You're bleeding. Shit. So, this lad loses a pint of blood, and you guys have got nothing to say for yourselves. It was an accident, Pop. Roger's been starting crap all year. Who threw the first punch, Michael? Hugo, did Michael throw the first punch? Answer me, yes or no?! Yeah, Dad. Michael threw the first punch but it wasn't his fault. All right? He just had a few too many beers. That's all. I didn't hear that. I did not hear that. You understand? You have disgraced our team. You know the rules. You can attend practice. That's a privilege that I give you. But you will not play in at least two games. Then, we will see. You know what this is going to cost us? This young man sitting here... called you up to share the Most Valuable Player Award, and you just shit all over it. And you know, you're lucky that this didn't happen on campus, because your over-privileged ass... I know, sir. Get out of here. Get out of here, all of you. Is there some reason you're still in this office, son? No, Pop. You fucked us up, Dogs. Fucked up. If Odin had got into a fight, would you have sat him too? I'm eating now. I'm going back to the dorm, Mom. So what did Roger say to you anyway? I'd feel guilty kicking his ass. Save it, Hugo. You'll be back on the team next year. So, who cares? Dude, it's different for you, cause your dad is cool. But my parents are going to find out. Why are you in school, man? What? Are you here for your parents or for you? So they'll be a little pissed off. What are they going to do? - Are they going to spank you? - Hugo, my parents always talk about reputation. Reputation? Who gives a fuck about reputation? I love you, man, but you're a little bit of a mamma's boy. The only person you have to answer to is yourself. You make your own rules. The minute you figure that out, you're free. Look, Mike, you really want back on the team? Why can't you just talk to your dad? Because I'm telling you, my dad trusts Odin, all right? If Odin says we need you back in there, you're back in there. Yeah, but Odin won't even talk to me, man. Mike, am I your boy? Am I your boy? All right, then. This is what we've got to do. You're friends with Desi, right? Yes, of course. Well, now you're her best friend. And you're going to get her to talk to Odin for you. Pour your heart out to her. Girls are suckers for guys who pour their hearts out. And then she talks to Odin. But listen to me. You've got to hang with her. That's the only way this thing works. It's worth a shot, bro'. Yo. Hugo, thanks, man. What are you doing with this stupid bird? - People are looking for it. - I borrowed it. We've got things to do, and you're playing pranks with the fricking mascot? I can't stop thinking about her. Why don't you rich shitheads ever have any patience? Anything worth anything takes time and sacrifice. You spoiled fuck. What do you call this? You did get your ass kicked pretty good, though. No, I got my ass kicked pretty good twice, in less than a week! I need to know where this is going! Friends, this tournament has seen some excellent play, but nothing better than Odin James of Palmetto Grove. Tonight, James and his Hawks face the mighty Bulldogs of North Charleston, in the first face-off between these two hoops powerhouses in nine years. The Hawks, now an amazing ninth in the nation in prep ball are just two games away from the State Championship, but they'll have to do it without their team mascot. Evidently, the bird was stolen. So it looks like James will have to do all the flying himself. Watch the hands! Watch the hands, ref! He's open! He's open, Hugo! Give him the ball! Push, push, push! Pressure the ball! Pressure the ball! Todd, get back! Todd, stay with the ball! Put a body on him, for Christ's sake! Play the man, not the ball! Come on, put a body on him! Come on, he's slipping! Time! Come on, let's go. We've only got 20! Lads, you're getting into the wrong guy's face. Number 45 is taking us to the cleaners. Every time he gets the ball, he's freed up. It's an automatic deuce because nobody is putting a body on him in the paint. So put a man to man with a floater. Odin, you're the floater. Billy, look at me! You deny that son of a bitch the ball, understand? And Odin, if he gets away from Billy, I don't give a shit if you have to pull his pisser, his feet do not leave the ground! Enough said? All right, put them in. What time is it now? - Game time! Rah! - All right, let's play! Odin, Hugo, come on! Wake up! Let's finish this thing. Give me another board. Come on, let's go! Get it up! - Watch it! - Watch him, Odin! Push him! Come on, help him out! Watch the perimeter. There you go. Take the shot. Yes! Hugo, stay on the elbow. Stay on the elbow. Pop through, Billy. Pick it up! Oh, Jesus. Hey, man. You know, I've been thinking, man. I think I'm going to talk to coach about Mikey. He should be a part of all this, man. Listen, did Mike know that you and Desi were getting together? Yeah, he knew. Why? I didn't think he knew. You know, Mikey's the one that hooked us up, man. Do you trust Mike? I trust him out there on that court. The man can play some ball. Yeah, but do you trust him? Yeah, he's cool. What's up, man? Why are you tripping? It's nothing, man. Come on, Hugo. Say what you've got to say. You're not a jealous person, man. I am. It's a weakness. You know, sometimes I see things that are not really there. Yeah? You don't want to hear what I have to say. Let me be the judge of that. I can't help but think that... you should watch your girl, bro'. I mean, she and Mike spend an awful lot of time together. And so what? All I'm saying is that her and Mike are always together. And I know the Dean would rather see Mike up in that piece. How can you say some shit like that to me, man? See, you're right. I shouldn't have said nothing. Forget about it, man. Mike's a good guy. Wait, wait. No, man, you can't say some shit like that and just break out. What's going on, Dogs? All right. You and Desi were going out for four months before her father had a clue. So obviously, the girl knows how to keep a secret. You grew up in the hood, and you've seen plenty of hustlers, but the one thing I do know better than you is white girls. And white girls are snaky. All right, they're horny snakes. They act like we're the ones who want sex, but they want it worse than us, man. They're just subtle about the way they go after it. Hey, man, my girl's not like that. But just think about the way she played her father when he found out about you and her. What? Emily said something to you? No, but she wouldn't, because they stick together. There is one way to find out, though. - Yeah, like ask Mike. - No, because if there is something going on- and I'm not saying that there is something going on- but if there is something going on, they're not just going to come clean. Watch her. If she keeps hanging out with Mike, if she keeps talking about Mike, then we've got something to think about. We don't let on, bro'. We just watch. What's up, man? Hey, O, what's that all about? - Hey. - Hey. I'm almost ready. Cool. Just cool? I've been planning this night for a month. Do you know what I had to do to get that car? Yeah, I know. - Do you have your pass? - Uh-hmm. What's wrong with you? Hello? Hey, D... you never used to go out with Mike, like- Iike before I got here or anything like that, right? Michael? He's like my best friend, except for Emily. But I thought I was your best friend. Oh, does my baby feel like he's got a little competition? Come on, stop playing around. Come on, stop! Damn. Let's just go, okay? Did somebody say something to you? No, let's just go. Look, just give me the money. It's only 100 bucks. This is it, dude. I'm tapped out. Dad said he won't send any more. Then you'll have to use his credit card. - We need a cell phone. - What? If this is going to work, we have to keep in constant contact. Hey, guys. Hey, Roger, could you do me a favor? - Sure. - Get lost. I have something for you. You have things for lots of guys. You're amazing. What are you going to do with it? Nothing. I'm not going to keep it. It's just a little prank. When it turns up missing, she's going to go nuts. What would I do without you? All this time I've been looking for romance, and all I had to do was steal something. You didn't steal anything. You just borrowed it for a little while. And if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to borrow you. I want you to be able to do anything. I want you to do what you want with me. Yeah? I want you to have me however you want. I want to give myself to you the way you want me. Don't hold back. Ow! Odin, stop! Stop! Stop! No! ...purposely uses this maternal imagery to get him into doing this dirty work. "I have given suck and know how tender it is to love the babe that milks me." Odin, did you give Desi a scarf a while back? Yeah. It was silk or something, right? Yeah, I showed it to you. Gentlemen. Wait, you gave that scarf to Desi? You know I did. You want me to give that to her? Don't tell her it's from me. I think I saw Michael with that same scarf about an hour ago. I'm not sure, but I'd swear it was the same one. Thanks. Get the fuck out of here! Mr. Goulding, Mr. James, would either of you care to name one of Shakespeare's poems for me? I thought he wrote movies. Perhaps you two should pay attention. That way, after you've won this nationally televised championship, you'll have something more profound to say. What do you mean, rough? He forced you? No, it wasn't like that. We were already doing it. Did you say "stop"? He didn't rape me. Desi, you know I like O too, okay? But you act like the guy's a saint or something. Well, maybe he's not a saint, but he's never done anything even close to that before. Half the time, he doesn't even want to do anything. He just lays naked with me. Desi, you said stop. Would you be so concerned if he were white? That is so easy. D, it's me. What are you doing? It's after hours. I know. I'm sorry. I just had to see you. - To say how are you doing, Emily? - Good. Sorry, baby, no presents for you this time. Where were you? Michael was looking for you. Mike? Yeah, Michael. Can I have a kiss? Hey, D, how come you never wear that scarf I gave you? I hadn't really thought about it. - Can I see it real quick? - Yeah. I keep it right here. - What, you lost it? - No, it's here somewhere. My mamma gave me that scarf when she got real sick. She said to make sure to give it to someone very special, and it'd keep our love right. I'm sure it'll turn up around here somewhere. - Could you look some more? - She'll find it later. - Come on, I'll help you. - No, I'll find it later. Right now, I really want to talk about Michael. You know, he deserves to play, and he's your best friend. - That's all he talks about. - I really need you to find that scarf. And I said I'll find it later. Hey, D... you'd never give out no love behind my back, now would you? I mean, maybe I'm not enough for you. You know, especially with you being all hot and shit. What? You know what I'm talking about. Hey, Em, you've got to see this girl in action- Are you kidding me?! That's really shitty! Okay. But check this. If you were a virgin like you said you were, how come when we're doing it you're acting all freaky and stuff, telling me I could do whatever I want with you? - I don't need to be here right now. - No, Em. - I don't think you do either. - That is not what I meant! - What the hell is wrong with you? - Look, let's just find the scarf, OK? - Emily's going to help us. - What if Emily doesn't want to help? I think you should go. - Where is my scarf? - I don't know. - You lost it. - No, I'll find it later. Does Mike know where my scarf is? Is that why you want me to talk to him? What? If you want to ask me if I'm cheating on you, get some balls and ask. No, I'm not! Michael?! You're the only person I've ever been with and the only person want to be with. And if you want to be with me, don't ever talk to me like that again, ever. I'm always straight with you, O. Two on one half break. Let's go! Let's go! Push it! Push it! Push it! Hugo! For Christ's sake, look where you are! Look where the basket is! Protect the basket! For Christ's sake. It's two on one fast break! What, are you deaf? Odin, where are you? At some picnic? We've got 10 full minutes. Let's make it count! Come on, stack it up! - Come on, man, stack it up! - Let's go! Come on! Push it! Give me the ball. Give me the ball! Damn it! You guys are lolly-gagging the ball up and down the court Iike a bunch of snails. You play this way come game night, you won't beat the Sisters of Mercy! All right, Michael, come in here and run the point. Odin, why don't you take your nap on the bench? It's more comfortable there. Let's go, Michael. I said let's go! Come on! You've got eight minutes. What's your fucking problem, man? You get back here, son, and apologize! Odin! Odin! You get your ass back here and apologize. Jeff, run the team. Hey, Pop. Have a seat. It's been a while since you invited me in for dinner. What is going on with Odin? I don't know. I saw him in class today. He seemed all right. By the way, I'm getting an A in English again. That's great, son. Congratulations. You know I don't ever have to worry about you, thank God. You've always done well and you always will, but Odin's different. He's all alone here. There's not even another Black student in this whole damn place. We're his family. I want you to keep an eye on him, find out what's going on. - Sure, Pop. - All right... 'cause if he's got a problem, we've got a problem. All right, Dad. You know, your mother just doesn't understand us. You stay here and finish your supper. The state finals are a few days away, and Palmetto Grove comes in as a heavy favorite. Coach Duke Goulding, or The Duke, as he is called, has got to be even more jittery than the players. A win right here could pave the way for a position at the college level. But first, you're about to see something that might make the NBA's finest a little bit nervous. And that's why all the scouts are here. It's the Southeast regional high school slam dunk contest. And young legs mean lots of air. - What's up, man? - What's up with you? You got that for me? - This ain't your style, player. - It ain't gonna be. I just ain't slept in a couple of days. Why the fuck are you worried? Give me the shit and get your ass on. Money's for customers. This is a one-time thing, right? You're going to have to get in line, I'm afraid. Every conference in the country's been after this kid, including the ACC, the Big Twelve, Pac Ten, Big Ten. I hope you don't think you're sitting there. - Bye. Good seeing you. - I had this seat with Hugo. Well, Hugo's not here, and I'm telling you to get lost. - Later, Roger, as in peace. - Jason, stop. Leave him alone. Michael, come on. Go ahead and keep sitting there. - Maybe I won't kick your ass again. - It's okay, Roger. You can sit there. It's fine. - Faggot. Tag along, faggot. - Jason! Why don't you go sit with some other friends. Oh, you don't have any. Everybody hates you. Stupid tag-along. Get lost. Flea. - Fucking faggot. - Fuck off. - Loser. Fucking loser. - Get out of here, Roger. It hurts, doesn't it? Then get lost. You've got five minutes, man. What's going on? You really fucked me up, man. - Me? - Yeah, you, bitch! If I knew Desi was going behind my back, I could deal with that. But all this wondering you got me going through is bullshit! You can't be thinking about that now. I'm going to tell you like this, Hugo. You better hope and pray you can prove that Mike is fucking Desi. You understand me?! I try to help my friend and this is what I get? Why don't you just fucking forget about it, man? I mean, you fucking got everything. I would give my left nut to be in your shoes. Fuck Desi! She's not some gold medal you need to win! You're the fucking medal, man! From the first time I saw her- the only reason I ever wanted to do something big was so she'd be proud to stand next to me. Shit. Look, is she cheating on me or not?! What the fuck? Let's talk about this after you win this thing. Don't you hold back on me, Hugo. Not now. - Come on. - No, you come on, bitch! - What, are you going to hit me? - I will if you don't speak to me. I don't know if it's true, but he told me they were together last night - and I don't know what else. - God damn it. That's all I'm saying for now. We can get together tonight and talk about this. They don't know who they're fucking with. What's that? I said they don't know who they're fucking with. They don't know who they're fucking with! Better hurry up, son. You're late. Knock them dead. - Odin James. - Okay, highest score is 50. You get one minute to do three dunks. I'm only doing one. - What? - I'm only doing one. But you get to throw out the two lowest. And now, our very own Odin James. Grab your jockstraps, gentlemen. He's about to blow you away. Go! Go! Go! Wow, he dunked it! I didn't think he could do that anymore. Go! Go! Go! Yo, man, that dunk was all that, - but I need the ball back, kid. - What? - The ball, homey. Give it up. - This ball right here, shorty? No, nigger, the balls hanging under your dick. Watch your fucking mouth. Who are you talking to? I'm just asking for one last game, Bob. One game for whom? For you... or for him? Because he's lucky he's not suspended. Yeah, Dad, who's your favorite now? I'm going to take care of you, man. This shit right here... will help you make it through. I don't want to be doing this. Just making it through, player. Just making it through. So, while the shit was going down tonight, I was doing some detective work. Mike says half the time, she doesn't want to have sex. She just wants to lay naked in the bed. But they're fucking, O. And they have been for over a month now. They do it in her room. And there's one more thing... Don't get mad at me for saying this, but... they call you "the nigger," man. Desi wouldn't say nothing like that, man. Shit. - Hey. - What's the matter? Nothing. What do you want? Man, I just need to talk to you. I'm a little busy. Just give me two minutes. - All right, but- - Give me two minutes, all right? Wait here. Hey, O. That's Mike. He wants to talk to me about Desi. Listen, I'm going to ask him what's up. All right? You can hear for yourself. Come on, let's take it out here. Hugo, you're my man for life. Forever. Just stay on the porch no matter what he says. Just stay on the bench. Be quiet, all right? Hey, man, what have you got going on here? What's up, big baller? Don't remind me of basketball. So, you and Desi have been spending a lot of time together. If you could just handle her the way you handle Brandy, then you'd be in business. That girl does whatever I say. She might be in love with me, though. I heard she thinks the two of you are going to get married. Yeah, right. Give me some credit. She's a slut. Man, I was at the library yesterday. She took me in the back. In the freaking library? No fucking way. And check this out. She said, down the road, even if she's with somebody, even if she's married, she said she'd do me until the day she dies. No fucking way. She does follow me everywhere. Have you seen Michael? What about Odin? What about him? He's a freaking loser. - The ghetto just popped out of him. - You don't have to go there. Listen, the nigger's out of control. And I'm glad he's off the team. And if he comes at me again, I swear I'll kill his ass. Hugo, where's Michael? Hugo, I know Mike's in here. - Open the damn door! - Oh, boy. - What's up? - Hey. What the hell do you think you're doing, giving me something you got from some other bitch? What? - Asshole! - What are you tripping about? - It's a present. - Yeah? Well, I like presents where I was the only owner! Brandy. You see what I have to deal with? You want this? How are we going to kill this motherfucker? How are we going to kill this motherfucker? That's a big step. What about Desi? I don't get people in here with that kind of money. But it is one hell of a watch. What are you looking to get for it? You have any papers on this .38? On what? Don't even look in that case. Don't even think about it, unless you're ready to pull out some ID. Listen, you want that watch. I want that pistol. You've been everything to me, O. To me, you're not my friend, you're my brother. And when a brother is wronged, so am I. I'm you, O. I'm a part of you. The plan I've come up with is flawless, planned out to the minute. I've spent the last few days going over every possible detail and angle. All we have to do is set this thing in motion and never look back. Tomorrow I'm going to talk to my dad. I'm going to tell him me and Mike will find our own way to the game. I'll say we want to get there early. We'll take Roger's car. You're going to talk to Desi. You'll tell her you want to make up, a little love session before the game. She should be alone in her room. Emily will go on without her. For it to work, we have to make sure it looked like Michael did it. We'll leave behind a little present. At exactly 7:00PM, you take out Desi... and you plant Michael's glass. When that's all done, you call me on Roger's cellular. We'll have a rental car waiting on the side of the road. When Mike gets out to help, we'll make it look like a suicide. Then we all make our way to the game on time. I know my dad. Without Mike, he's got to play you. So we win the game, and we all swear we never saw Mike or Desi at all. If we stick to the timetable, this will work. What about Roger? Roger thinks you and Desi are just breaking up. But after it's all over, I'll tell him. He'll be so scared, he'll go along with whatever I say. And if he doesn't? You said you're going all the way with this thing, right? About what time was the car checked out? Yeah. All right. Yeah, thank you. Okay. I appreciate it. Bye. Herb's on time, so far. All right. Hey, man. Man, it's game time, baby. Let's do it. A little pep-up for the road? No, I can't. Not tonight. Oh Mike, come on. This is my last game as a Hawk, bro'. I'm too nervous, man. We shall go no more roving so late into the night. - Look, man, I can't. - Mike. All right. Oh, fuck! I'm supposed to meet with Brandy. - She was going to ride with us. - Not anymore, comrade. She's got wheels. Don't worry about it. You sure you don't want me to wait? - Save me a seat. - Okay. Later. Man, you're driving like my grandmother. Come on, man. The Duke is going to kill us. Did you see that car back there? What? The one with the flashing lights. - The guy might be in trouble. - No, no way, man. We're going to miss warm-ups. It'll take just a second to check out. It's going to be freezing tonight. We've got to check it out. Send someone over to check on their rooms. Hurry! Let's go, lads, let's go! Duke, this is Mr. Bradley, head of the Game Council Athletic Department. Yes, sir. It's a pleasure to meet you. It's a pleasure to meet you, couch. I tell you, I've been following you all year, and you've done a great job. Thanks very much. I appreciate that. I wouldn't mind helping you guys out next season. I hear that. I'd like to talk to the Odin kid, if any way possible. Sir, the whole world would like to talk to Odin. Saw him in the North Charleston semis, he lacerated their defense. Nobody's done that all year. - He had some good coaching. - Bradley: I'd have to agree with you. - Let's talk after the game, couch. - All right, sir. He'd sure look good in that garnet and black. - Did you comp his ticket? - Yes, I did. Come on, lads, let's go. Come on, sweat it up. Hey, mister, you're all right? What the fuck?! Do it, Rog. Do it. Fuck! Let it go! Let it go! What the fuck, man?! What's wrong with you, man? All right. No! Shit! Fuck, Rog. It's got to look like a fucking suicide! Fuck! I got him! Just like you said. I shot the fucker! Now, we do it close. No, the cops can tell someone else shot the first bullet. You herbed us, man! You fucking herbed us! You fucking herbed us! - Hugo, we have to go. - Where's the scarf? - You know I gave it to you. - Where's the scarf? - We have to go. - Where's the scarf? - Let me get him off the road. - Rog! Rog! Rog! When that car gets here, I'll tell them you shot him in self- defense. He attacked you and you shot him in self- defense. If he wakes up, he's going to tell on me. It won't matter, Rog. Desi's dead. I'm sorry, bro'. What time is it? Hold on! Hold on! Brandy, call 911, okay? Roger hit Michael with a crow bar and then Michael shot him. - Brandy, help me! - Oh, my God! I need your help! We need to get him to a hospital! Come on, Brandy, you need to help me, please. Come on, Brandy! Brandy! Fuck! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Odin. I saw Mike with the scarf. He's dead. He told me you were with him. Now he's dead. He's dead. Stop. Stop. I want to be able to let you go, but I can't. I wish I could, but I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. Shh. Shh. Shh. Go to sleep. Shh. Stop. Please. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. - Jason, have you seen Desi? - Nope. - What about Hugo? - Uh-uh. No? Desi? Desi? - Shh. - Desi? Hey. They killed him! - They killed Michael! - What are you talking about? Hugo! - You killed her? - You shut up! - Shut up! - You fucking killed her! - Hey. - No! Tell me Odin is lying. Tell me you didn't say Desi was cheating on him! - I told him what I heard. - That's a lie! Desi and Michael!? - You said she slept with him!? - Emily, shut up! - Somebody get an ambulance! - Fuck off! Get off her! - Emily! - She was a ho'! Desi was fucking Mike! He admitted it! And she gave him my scarf. They were laughing at me! Hugo, tell her! - Tell her, man! - That silk scarf? Emily, be quiet. No. No, Hugo. - Shut the fuck up, Emily. - Hugo had that scarf. - Emily. - You begged me to steal it for you! She's fucking lying, bro'. She is fuckin' lying. Don't even fucking pay any attention to her. - You gave that scarf to Michael. - Tell the truth! - You gave that scarf to Michael! - Tell the truth, Emily! You gave that scarf to Michael! Stay down! Jason, ask him why he did this. Ask him! You won't ask me nothing. I did what I did. That's all you need to know. From here on, I'll say nothing. Hugo... Hugo! Sit the fuck down! Everybody sit down and shut the fuck up! Now, somebody here knows the truth. Somebody needs to tell the goddamn truth. My life is over. That's it. But while you're all out here living yours, sitting around, talking about the nigger who lost it, back in high school, you make sure you tell them the truth. You tell them I loved that girl. I did. But I got played. He twisted my head up. He fucked it up. I ain't no different than none of you all. My mom ain't no crack head. I wasn't no gangbanger. It wasn't some hood rat drug dealer that tripped me up. It was this white, prep school motherfucker standing right there. Put the gun down! Come on, son! Drop it! Put it down! You tell them where I'm from... didn't make me do this. All my life, I always wanted to fly. I always wanted to live like a hawk. I know you're not supposed to be jealous of anything, but... to take flight, to soar above everything and everyone... now, that's living. But a hawk is no good around normal birds. It can't fit in. Even though all the other birds probably want to be hawks, they hate him for what they can't be- proud, powerful, determined, dark. Odin is a hawk. He soars above us. He can fly. And one of these days, everyone is going to pay attention to me... because I'm going to fly, too.
