WHY ARE WE ONLY LOADING YOUR PLANE? I GUESS SOMEBODY THINKS I NEED THE PRACTICE. AN ECM POD? WHY DO YOU NEED A RADAR JAMMER? FOR REALISM. WAIT A SECOND. RYAN CAN'T WAN IRON BOMBS.

THEY DON'T HAVE THE PROPER RELEASE SYSTEM. OK. UM, COULDN'T WE JUST FORGE THE EXTRA PINS, AND, UH, MOUNT IT ON A CONVENTIONAL BRACKET? I GUESS I COULD. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GONNA DROP IT, OR ANYTHING. I MEAN, IT'S A DUMMY. WHAT'S THE POINT? YEAH. YOU GOT ME, SERGEANT. I, UH-- I'M JUS FOLLOWIN' ORDERS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. I DON'T GET THIS. THERE'S GOTTA BE A MISTAKE. WHY DON'T WE PUT ON A MODE 2? NO, UH, NO, YOU BETTER STICK TO THE MANIFEST. UH, INTELLIGENCE HAD A HAND IN IT. MILITARY INTELLIGENCE... IT'S LIKE JUMBO SHRIMP, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? HEH. HELL, THEY DON'T PAY ME TO THINK. COME ON! TAKE I TO THE HOOP! NICE SHOT. LET'S SEE THAT KIND OF CONCENTRATION IN THE AIR TODAY. WE'RE GONNA KICK BUT TODAY, SIR. I APPRECIATE YOUR FIGHTING SPIRIT, LIEUTENANT, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING YOUR DOGFIGHT SCORES HAVE BEEN SO PATHETIC. MAYBE THAT'S NO OUR FAULT, SIR. OOH, IT'S THE BLACK ANGEL. YEAH, WELL, CAPTAIN GORDON'S GOOD. BUT SO ARE THE REST OF YOU, OR YOU WOULDN' HAVE MADE IT THIS FAR. THE DIFFERENCE IS, WHEN HE'S UP THERE, HE BELIEVES IT'S REAL. THAT'S 'CAUSE HE'S A NUT. YOU'RE OUTTA LINE. GORDON DOES WHAT YOU'VE ALL GOTTA DO, TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. IT IS NOT A GAME. YOU ARE EITHER A FIGHTER PILOT, OR YOU ARE A TARGET. THE CHOICE IS YOURS. NOW, I'M NOT HERE JUST TO TEACH YOU TO SCORE KILLS. I AM TRYING TO TEACH YOU HOW NOT TO DIE, AND BELIEVE ME, GENTLEMEN, UP THERE, DYING IS EASY. NOW HIT THE SHOWERS AND SUIT UP.

SWITCHING NOW. WINCHESTER? CONTROL, DO YOU READ? AFFIRMATIVE, RINGLEADER. SIR, WE HAVE A DEFINITE LOOSE CANNON SITUATION. BLACK ANGEL IS ARMED, JAMMING RADAR, 2 PLANES DOWN. WE'RE SITTING DUCKS UP HERE. NO WEAPONS AT ALL. MATT, FOR GOD'S SAKES, RETURN TO BASE IMMEDIATELY. THAT'S NOT ADVISABLE. I THINK HE'S GOT BOMBS. IS RED FLAG HOT? I'M GONNA LEAD HIM INTO THE S.A.M. RANGE. THE RANGE IS HOT, BUT THIS IS A NEGATIVE. REPEAT, NEGATIVE. ANY PLANES ON ALERT? NO, SIR. HOW LONG TO GENERATE AN ARMED FLIGHT? 15 MINUTES, MINIMUM. DO IT. YES, SIR.

HE'S GOT HIM IN S.A.M. RANGE AGAIN, SIR. ALL RIGHT. TELL 'EM TO FIRE. MATT, HERE THEY COME. RED FLAG NUMBER 3 AND NUMBER 5, YOU HAVE CONSEN TO FIRE. BILL, HE'S TAKING OU THE S.A.M.s.

YOU'RE CLEARED FOR IMMEDIATE TAKEOFF. NEGATIVE, SIR. HE JUST TOOK OU THE RUNWAY. [PANTING] COME ON, WHERE ARE YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH? HE'S STILL JAMMING US, SIR. I CAN'T GET A DECENT FIX.

VALERIE, WHAT ARE WE DOING? YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS WEIRD, THOUGH, ISN'T IT? MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL THE COPS. [BABY COOS] UH, BREAKER 1-9, BREAKER 1-9, DOES ANYBODY OUT THERE HEAR ME? BREAKER 1-9, PLEASE COME IN. Woman on C.B.: THIS IS GARRISON COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. UH, YES, UH THIS IS VALERIE DWYER. WE SAW SOMETHING ON THE ROADWAY--OHH! DON'T DO ANYTHING. [BABY COOING] [CRYING] FREEZE! DROP IT! HANDS IN THE AIR! DROP THE GEAR, PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR NOW! DO IT! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING, SOLIDER? I'M LIEUTENANT COLONEL MATTHEW RYAN. SORRY, SIR. THINGS ARE PRETTY RAGGED AROUND HERE. WE THOUGHT YOU MIGH BE THE OTHER ONE. JEEZ, SIR, I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET YOU TO A HOSPITAL. NO. TAKE ME TO THE BASE. SIR, I REALLY THINK WE OUGHT TO-- THAT'S AN ORDER. [ENGINE REVS] [BABY CRIES] YOU HAVE ANY TOOLS IN THE VAN? GET 'EM. [CRYING] HE'S HUNGRY. I--I HAVE TO FEED HIM. GO AHEAD. HEY, IT'S OK. SHH! DON'T WORRY. SHH. I'D LIKE TO TAKE HIM IN THE VAN. NO. OK. SHH. SHH. [HUMS] PUT 'EM DOWN. GOOD. THE KEYS. GO, GO, GO, GO! SIT DOWN. OH, PLEASE, YOU DON' HAVE TO DO THAT. WE'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING. WHAT DO YOU WANT? JUST TELL US WHAT YOU WANT. I HAVE WORK TO DO. BASED ON HIS SCHEDULED FUEL LOAD, HE COULD BE ANYWHERE FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER TO OREGON, OR AS FAR EAST AS COLORADO. WHAT ABOUT SALT LAKE CENTER'S RADAR OR L.A.'s? NO, HE WAS FLYING TOO LOW AND HE WAS JAMMING OUR G.C.I. SITES. THEY NEVER GO A FIX ON HIM. HOW ABOUT FIRST STRA WING AT BEAL? THEY RELEASED 2 U-2s AND A TR-1, SO WE'LL HAVE PHOTO AND INFRARED IMAGERY. THE PROBLEM IS, THEY'RE ASKING TOO MANY QUESTIONS. TAC WANTS TO KEEP THIS IN THE FAMILY. OH, CHRIST. SCREW THE POLITICS, BILL. THIS IS SERIOUS. I KNOW. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY TAC WANTS TO KEEP A LID ON THIS INFORMATION. THE LAST THING WE NEED RIGHT NOW IS A MEDIA LEAK. NOW LANGLEY RELEASED AWACS TO US, SO IF THAT BASTARD TAKES OFF AGAIN, WE'LL CATCH HIM ON THE AIRBORNE RADAR. AS FAR AS LANDING, WE KNOW HE COULD'VE USED ANY LONG STRETCH OF HIGHWAY, A SALT FLAT, OR DRY LAKE BED. AT DAWN, WE'RE GONNA CONCENTRATE OUR SEARCH IN THE DESERTS. WE'RE GONNA MOVE DOWN TO THE AGRICULTURE AREAS AND SO ON. A 40-FOOT COMBAT JE IS NOT THAT EASY TO HIDE. GORDON'S SMART. HE'S NO GONNA LEAVE HIS ASS EXPOSED. WHAT KIND OF AN ANIMAL SLAUGHTERS HIS OWN FAMILY LIKE THAT? I DON'T KNOW, BILL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU. THE BASTARD HAD ME FOOLED. MATT. THIS IS HARVEY GLATMAN WITH JANAC. HE JUST CAME IN FROM LIVERMORE. NOW FOR THE BAD NEWS. WE THINK YOUR MAN'S STOLEN A NUKE. OHH. CAME UP ON THE COMPUTER. HE MUST'VE SWAPPED SERIAL NUMBERS WITH ONE OF YOUR TRAINING UNITS. CLEVER. FORTUNATELY, IT'S A COMPARATIVELY SMALL ONE... 50 KILOTONS OR SO. THERE REALLY ISN' ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. HOW'S THAT? IT CAN'T GO OFF. LOOK. THERE'S A CONVENTIONAL EXPLOSIVE UP FRONT, RADIOACTIVE FISSIONABLE MATERIAL TOWARD THE OUTSIDE AND THE PLUTONIUM CORE. NOW ON A DEVICE OF THIS TYPE, THERE ARE 8 FAIL-SAFE ARMING MECHANISMS. THEY'RE DESIGNED TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DETONATION. THE ONLY WAY TO TRIGGER THE WEAPON IS TO ENTER THE PROPER ARMING CODES, AND I CAN ASSURE YOU, YOUR MAN DOES NO HAVE ACCESS TO THE ARMING CODES. WHAT IF HE DISMANTLES THE BOMB? COULDN' HE RECONFIGURE THE DETONATOR AND DEFEA THE FAIL-SAFES? MAYBE. BUT THEN THE EXPLOSION WOULD BE REDUCED TO A FISSION BLAST, AN A-BOMB. LIKE HIROSHIMA. UH, ABOUT THAT SIZE. BUT HE'D ALSO DESTROY THE FUSE. THE CONVENTIONAL BLAS CAN'T BE TRIGGERED ONCE THE FAIL-SAFES HAVE BEEN TAMPERED WITH. IT'S A MOOT POINT. OPENING THE BOMB IS SUICIDE. IF HE BREACHES THE CONTAINMENT VESSEL, HE'LL BE EXPOSED TO MASSIVE DOSES OF PLUTONIUM GAS. RADIATION SICKNESS. HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO KILL HIM? DEPENDS UPON DURATION AND PROXIMITY. HE'D SUFFER INTERNAL HEMORRHAGING, MASSIVE TISSUE DAMAGE. MY GUESS, 36 TO 48 HOURS. WELL, THAT'S PLENTY OF TIME. BESIDES, GORDON ISN' AFRAID OF DYING. WELL, HE'S JUS A PILOT, RIGHT? HOW LIKELY IS HE TO HAVE THIS KIND OF TECHNICAL EXPERTISE? VERY GODDAMN LIKELY. YOU'RE UNDERESTIMATING HIM. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THE SON OF A BITCH IS ON A MISSION. WHAT? BLACKMAIL? NO, IT'S NOTHING SANE LIKE THAT. THIS ISN'T RATIONAL. HE'S NOT GONNA GIVE US A LIS OF DEMANDS. IN THE AIR... I HEARD HIM PRAYING. STUFF FROM THE BIBLE. I THINK HE'S DECIDED HE'S SOME KIND OF AVENGING ANGEL. GOD HELP US. [GAS ESCAPES] UNH. NO. NO. IT'S OK. NO, IT'S NOT. UH, PLEASE...SIR. THE WIRES, THEY'RE CUTTING HIM. CUT HIM LOOSE. YOU CAN GO TO THE VAN IF YOU WANT. YOU CAN SLEEP THERE. LEAVE THE BABY. OH, NO. PLEASE. I--I CAN'T. SUIT YOURSELF. [GAS ESCAPES] [ELECTRONIC HUMMING] BEDFORD CONTROL, THIS IS ASPEN-1 NO SIGN OF TARGET ANGEL. REQUEST UPDATE, OVER. NEGATIVE, ASPEN-1. NO SIGHTINGS. WE'RE COMPILING DATA FROM LOCAL POLICE THROUGHOU THE TARGET ZONE. MOVING TO GREAT HOTEL 6. ASPEN-1 OUT. [WHIMPERS] GET UP. WE'VE GOTTA FIND A TOWN. NOT HIM. JUST YOU AND THE BABY. UH, YESTERDAY, RICHARD AND I PASSED A TOWN ABOUT 20 MILES FROM HERE. GARRISON, I THINK. WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO LAS VEGAS. [BABY COOING] THAT WON'T BE THERE MUCH LONGER. WHAT? PULL OVER. PULL OVER. [VOMITING] WHAT'S WRONG? NOTHIN'. YOU, UH... KNOW HOW TO HOLD A BABY. YEAH, I HAD A LITTLE BROTHER. YEAH? THIS IS A MISTAKE. WHAT? MAKING A BABY. MAKING MORE OF US. IT'S WRONG. HE'S SO CLEAN. YES. HE IS. IT WON'T LAST. HE'LL BE POISONED. WELL... WE, UH, TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT. BRINGING A BABY INTO A WORLD THAT'S FALLING APAR LIKE THIS. YEAH, BUT YOU DID IT ANYWAY. GO ON, KEEP DRIVING. [WHISPERING] Wait at the counter. Don't talk to anyone. [CASH REGISTER BEEPING] UM, DO YOU TAKE TRAVELER'S CHECKS? YEP. AND PUT YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER ON THE BACK. [COUGHING] YOU'RE SICK. YOU NEED SOME MEDICINE. WE PASSED A PHARMACY BACK THERE. I'M FINE. I NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK. WHAT IS I THAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR PLANE? NOTHING. MY PLANE IS FINE. WELL, THEN WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON? FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, SHUT UP! PLEASE-- SHUT UP! [BABY CRYING] YOU'RE RIGHT. I NEED SOMETHING. TURN AROUND. [CASH REGISTER BEEPING] UM, TRAVELER'S CHECKS OK? Pharmacist: UH-HUH. THERE YOU GO. 30, 40, AND 50. LET'S GO. THANK YOU. WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU? [BABY WHIMPERS] NOTHING. IT'S OK. WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?! RICHARD, DON'T. HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA GO ON? TILL IT'S OVER. TILL IT ALL STOPS. TILL I MAKE IT STOP. OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE, WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET US GO? WE WON' TELL ANYBODY WHAT YOU'RE DOING. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. I'M BRINGING 'EM THE LIGHT. THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? BRINGING WHO THE LIGHT? THE DISEASED. THE UNCLEAN. THE CORRUPT. THE LIARS. ALL THE DIRTY SONS OF BITCHES. [BOMB BEEPS] JESUS, I KNOW WHAT THAT IS. MASSACHUSETTS LICENSE PLATE. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] [BABY CRYING] [GUNSHOTS] GO, GO! [GUNFIRE] [GUNSHOT] AAH! [GUNSHOT] RICHARD! [GUNSHOT] OH, GOD. Valerie: UHH! [BABY CRYING] [BABY CRYING] [TELEPHONE RINGS] NOTHING FROM THE AWACS. THAT MEANS HE'S STILL ON THE GROUND. THESE ARE NEW. THE ONE IN COLORADO IS A FALSE ALARM. IT WAS A FOILED ROBBERY. THE GUY JUST HAPPENED TO LOOK LIKE GORDON. SACRAMENTO, THAT'S A CRASHED HANG-GLIDER. HOW ABOUT THIS ONE? THAT'S AN ABORTED C.B. COMMUNICATION OF SOME KIND. SOMETHING ABOUT A LANDING. PROBABLY A UFO NUT. WAIT A SECOND. WAIT A SECOND. THIS SAME AREA REPORTED A HOSTAGE SITUATION. ANY RESOLUTION? LOCAL COPS INVESTIGATED, BUT THEY HAVEN' REPORTED IN YET. THAT'S THE BEST SHO WE'VE GOT SO FAR. IT'S ONLY A COUPLE OF HUNDRED MILES. I WANT TO CHECK IT OUT. MATT... YOU'VE GOTTA TAKE A COUPLE STEPS BACK FROM THIS ONE. LOOK, I KNOW YOU FEEL RESPONSIBLE, BUT YOU CAN' HANDLE IT ALL YOURSELF. GORDON HAS KILLED PEOPLE... THAT I CARED ABOUT. JESUS CHRIST, MATT. HE BOMBED THE HELL OUT OF MY GODDAMN AIR BASE. DON'T YOU THINK I WANT THE BASTARD'S ASS AS MUCH AS YOU DO? EMOTIONS ONLY MAKE YOU SLOPPY, MATT. NOW, THIS IS A MILITARY OPERATION, NOT A PERSONAL VENDETTA. WILL THAT BE ALL? YES. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] UHH. OH. [BABY CRIES] IT'S OK. IT'S OK. [WIRES BUZZ] [BOMB BEEPS] [BEEPING] [BABY CRYING] [AIR HOSE HISSES] [BUZZING] [BABY CRYING] UHH! UHH! OH, GOD. UHH! UHH! [TIRES SCREECHING] Truck driver: HEY, LADY! YOU ALL RIGHT? WE SHOULD MAKE GARRISON IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES. DID SHE SAY WHO DID IT? MM-HMM. RIGHT. WELL, UM-- THE SHERIFF'S NOT AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT, BUT WE'LL SEND SOMEONE AROUND. THANKS FOR CALLING. SO? THAT WAS THE HOSPITAL IN MILFORD. THEY GO A GUNSHOT VICTIM. A WOMAN WITH A BABY. ANYTHING ELSE? APPARENTLY, SHE'S BEEN BABBLING ABOUT A BOMB OR SOMETHING. Nurse on P.A.: DR. COLLINS TO O.R. STAT. Valerie: JAMES. WHERE'S JAMES? YOUR BABY'S FINE. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM UNTIL YOU'RE OUT OF SURGERY. NO. SOMEBODY'S GO TO STOP HIM. HE HAS A BOMB. I--I SAW IT. IT'S OK. I'M NOT CRAZY. Doctor: CHECK THE I.V. WAIT! IS THAT VALERIE DWYER? Nurse: NO VISITORS NOW! THE BOMB. TELL ME ABOUT THE BOMB. Nurse: WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? TALK TO ME! SHE HAS TO SPEAK TO ME! HE'S THE LIGHT. HE--HE'S GONNA DESTROY THEM. THE PILOT, EDDIE GORDON. HER PULSE IS DROPPING, DOCTOR. DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS? WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO VEGAS. EXCUSE ME! IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE. HE'S DESTROYED THEM. OK, JUST RELAX. Ryan: CLOSE EVERY AIRPOR WITHIN 200 MILES OF LAS VEGAS. GROUND ANYTHING THAT FLIES. THE ONLY THING IN THE AIR SHOULD BE THE 34th AND 421st TAC SQUADRONS. YOU CAN'T BE SURE HE'S COMING TO VEGAS. Ryan: ARE YOU WILLING TO GAMBLE HE ISN'T? MAKE THE CALL, BILL. AND TELL THE 34th I'LL BE DROPPING IN TO HILL TO PICK UP A PLANE. I'M GONNA FLY LEAD. Douglas: HE'S NO YOUR RESPONSIBILITY ANYMORE. Ryan: NO, SIR, HE IS MY RESPONSIBILITY. AND I WANT HIM. [PANEL BEEPS] [TURBINE STARTS] [BEEPS] BEDFORD CONTROL, THIS IS RINGLEADER. I'M AIRBORNE. COME IN, OVER. ROGER, RINGLEADER. THIS IS CONTROL. LISTEN, YOU MAY NOT HAVE TOO MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT. OUR ADVISORS INSIS THAT IF THE PACKAGE HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH, IT WILL NOT DETONATE. HE CAN DROP THE BOMB, BUT WITHOUT A FUSE, IT WILL NOT GO OFF. WHAT IF HE'S NO GOING TO DROP IT? WHAT IF HE'S THE FUSE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? LET'S SAY HE RIDES IT DOWN, GOES KAMIKAZE, BLOWS UP HIS PLANE. A COUPLE OF HUNDRED POUNDS OF JET FUEL MAKES A HELL OF A LO OF FIREWORKS. IS THAT POSSIBLE? CAN HE USE THE PLANE TO DETONATE THE BOMB? I DON'T-- HE WOULD HAD TO HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE REWORKING OF THE BOMB CIRCUITRY. IS IT POSSIBLE? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE. RINGLEADER, LISTEN TO ME. YOU'VE GO TO KEEP HIM AWAY FROM POPULATED AREAS. REPEAT, AWAY FROM POPULATED AREAS. GETTING SHOT DOWN MAY BE EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS. I COPY YOU, CONTROL. PROCEEDING TO RENDEZVOUS POINT. TANGO UNIFORM. Ryan: BLUE ZERO 4-FLIGHT, THIS IS RINGLEADER. WE ARE IN PURSUI OF AN F-21 MIRAGE, AND HE IS HOSTILE. HE WILL BE JAMMING AND FLYING LOW ON HIS APPROACH, SO KEEP YOUR HEADS OUT AND CLEAR. ALL COMMERCIAL AIR TRAFFIC IN THE AREA HAS BEEN SUSPENDED. WE ARE TO PURSUE AND REPEL FROM THE CITY, BUT NO SHOOTING. I REPEAT-- DO NOT FIRE ON HIM. RINGLEADER, THIS IS FALCON ONE. WE'VE BEEN GETTING A LO OF DOUBLE-TALK BACK AT BASE. COULD YOU BE STRAIGH WITH US, SIR? [SIGHS] ALL RIGHT. WE ARE IN PURSUI OF A RENEGADE PILOT. OUR BANDIT IS HOT. SUSPECTED TARGE IS LAS VEGAS. WE'RE DEALING WITH A REAL SITUATION HERE. AFFIRMATIVE, FALCON ONE. [GEIGER COUNTERS CLICK] CONTROL TO RINGLEADER, COME IN. READ YOU, CONTROL. HE WAS DEFINITELY IN GARRISON, UTAH. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. PLUS AWACS JUST PICKED UP A NEW RADAR PAINT. BANDI APPROACHING VEGAS FROM THE NORTHEAST. YOU PICKED IT, RINGLEADER. HE'S ALL YOURS. RINGLEADER COPIES. OUT. OK, GENTLEMEN, THIS IS IT. LET'S GO TACTICAL AND COVER THE BRIEF PATROL POINTS. REMEMBER, THIS IS THE REAL THING. GIVE IT ALL YOU'VE GOT. [CAR HORN HONKS] [RADAR BEEPS] [BEEPS] VISUAL CONTACT. THIS IS FALCON ONE. I HAVE VISUAL CONTAC WITH AN UNKNOWN COWBOY APPROACHING BELOW ME FROM THE SOUTHEAST. I AM DESCENDING TO ANGELS 2,000 TO VERIFY. RINGLEADER COPIES. USE EXTREME CAUTION. I'M ON MY WAY.

PLEASE FLY BEARING 2-3-5 DEGREES. RINGLEADER, HE'S ON MY 6! GET OUT OF THERE! HE'S ALL OVER ME! BREAK HIGH! BREAK HIGH! LEAD HIM HARD LEFT! HE'S GOT LOCK ON ME! RINGLEADER! FALCON ONE, COME AROUND-- NO! NO! Ryan: COMMAND, THIS IS RINGLEADER. FALCON ONE IS DOWN. GORDON HAS BROKEN OUR PERIMETER EN ROUTE TO CITY. NO ONE ELSE IN RANGE. I AM IN PURSUIT. CAN YOU STOP HIM, MATT? Ryan: I DON'T KNOW. RINGLEADER OUT. BLACK ANGEL! BLACK ANGEL! THIS IS RINGLEADER. DO YOU COPY? RING LEADER TO BLACK ANGEL. DAMN IT. I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME, EDDIE. THIS IS COLONEL RYAN, COME IN. COME ON, YOU CRAZY BASTARD. WHAT'S HIS HEADING? 3-0-0. Ryan: EDDIE, THIS IS A MISTAKE. YOU'RE NOT THE ONE. Gordon: THIS IS BLACK ANGEL. FAILED TO COPY LAST TRANSMISSION. [RADIO BEEPS] Gordon: PLEASE, REPEAT. -I SAID YOU'RE NOT THE ONE. YOU'RE NOT SPECIAL, EDDIE. YOU HAVE NO MISSION. YOU HAVE TO LAND YOUR PLANE. I'M THE ONE. I HAVE THE POWER. I HAVE TO USE IT. THIS POWER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. IT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU. IT DOESN'T BELONG TO ANY OF US. IT BELONGS TO GOD. I'M DOING HIS WORK. -KILLING YOUR MOTHER? YOUR FATHER? YOUR FAMILY? IS THAT DOING GOD'S WORK, EDDIE? YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. EVERYTHING DOWN THERE HAS TO BE DESTROYED. WIPED CLEAN. IT'S GOD'S MISSION. -NO, EDDIE, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GOD. IT'S YOU. YOU HAVE TO STOP. Controller: 20 MILES TO CITY CENTER. RINGLEADER, THIS IS GENERAL LINDSAY AT SAC HQ. I AM AUTHORIZING YOU TO DOWN THE TARGET. YOU HAVE GO-AHEAD TO FIRE. YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS. IF I HIT HIM NOW, THE BLAST ALONE COULD KILL 20,000-30,000 PEOPLE. General Lindsay: WE'RE PREPARED TO ACCEP CIVILIAN CASUALTIES. IF WE WAIT ANY LONGER, WE'LL LOSE THE WHOLE CITY. WE'VE GOT NO CHOICE. Controller: BANDIT, 15 MILES. EDDIE, I CAN FIRE RIGHT NOW AND END YOUR MISSION. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? I CAN KILL YOU RIGHT NOW. WHY DON'T YOU? I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO PROVE YOURSELF. MAYBE YOU REALLY ARE THE ONE, EDDIE. MAYBE YOU REALLY ARE DOING GOD'S WORK. SHOW ME, EDDIE. SHOW ME YOU'VE REALLY GOT THE POWER. TAKE ME OUT. General Lindsay: DAMN IT, RINGLEADER! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?! Controller: 10 MILES. I'M GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO PROVE YOURSELF, EDDIE. YOU TAKE ME OUT, WE'LL KNOW YOU'RE REALLY THE ONE. YOU FAIL, WE'LL KNOW YOU'RE LYING. YOU DO NOTHING, AND I'LL SHOOT YOU DOWN RIGHT HERE! YOU UNDERSTAND ME? Controller: 4 MILES AND CLOSING. I'M COMING AROUND TO TAKE MY SHOT, EDDIE. YOU WANT TO STOP ME, THEN YOU COME AFTER ME. Controller: 3 MILES. Ryan: IT'S UP TO YOU, EDDIE. YOU PROVE I OR YOU DIE. Controller: ONE MILE! [RADAR BEEPS] IT'S WORKING. GORDON'S FOLLOWING HIM. COME ON! TAKE YOUR SHOT! COMMAND, AM I OVER THE BOMBING RANGE YET? AFFIRMATIVE, RINGLEADER. KEEP THE OTHER PILOTS OUT OF THE AREA. RINGLEADER, IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN FORCE HIM TO LAND? NO. I HAVE TO TAKE HIM OUT. MATT... THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN SURVIVE IF THAT DAMN THING GOES OFF. RINGLEADER COPIES. GODSPEED, MATT. IT'S OVER, EDDIE. NO. GO TO HELL. NO! TV news anchor: ...YESTERDAY'S DETONATION OF A TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPON OVER THE NEVADA DESERT.
