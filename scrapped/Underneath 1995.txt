 

                        - Are you getting off at Austin?|- Huh? Yeah. - Going home?|- Sort of. - Visiting?|- Yeah. - Relatives.|- Yeah. - What kind?|- Mother and brother. - Mother's getting married.|- Hmm. - Is he nice?|- My brother? - No. The man your mother's gonna marry.|- Oh. Haven't met him. - I'm Susan.|- Michael. - So you live here?|- Yeah. - Where do you work?|- I'm training to be a teller|at the Grand Texas Bank. Ah.|So when do you take your test? Oh, I don't know.|It's a self-study, so you can take it|whenever you're ready. Just don't think|that I'm ready yet. Well, there's one way|to find out. Mom? Michael? Michael! - Give me a hug!|- Oh, I stink. I've been on a bus. I don't care. Nice butt. You bastard. - How's it goin'?|- Good, good, good. Shouldn't you be out clubbing motorists|or something? No, I'm on the night shift.|Plus, I'm beating the homeless now. - Oh, I see.|- They're not as mobile. So...|how's it goin'? It's goin'. You workin'? - You hirin'?|- Yeah. That's what the force needs:|Another confused white boy. Hear she's dating a small-time hood that|bought the Ember, if you're interested. I'm here for the wedding. Tell me|about Ed. Did you run a check on him? - No, I did not.|- Bullshit, I know you did. All right, a small one.|But he's clean. - No moving violations, no nothin'?|- Not in Texas. Hurray for Mom. I don't know.|I, uh... I can't decide right now.|You go first. I don't play the lottery.|It's a waste of money. Well, if I won, it's always been|a dream of mine to breed dogs. - No. No.|- No? Okay. - How 'bout a stamp collection then?|- Okay, that I'll go for. All right. - How 'bout you, Michael?|- I wouldn't believe it. If it were true,|I'd smile. I'd just sit there quietly|for five minutes, smile and be rich. I don't know.|Come on, Mom, what? You know I can't make decisions,|but, um... I know one thing I want,|I want the biggest TV they make. Two of 'em,|with everything on it. - Extra cheese?|- Yeah. So how long you|gonna stay, Michael? Maybe a little while.|See some friends. We got an opening,|if you're looking for somethin'. Thanks.|It's a kind offer. I thought you needed law enforcement|or military service for a job like that. Helpful,|but not mandatory. If I put in a good word,|they'd probably take him, no problem. - Beat goin' back to Sports Town.|- I doubt that would be an option. This is the official|lotto Texas drawing for August 13, 14. In the next 60 seconds, you can become|Texas' newest millionaire! - Are you registered somewhere?|- Michael, when you're getting married|at 56, you don't register. Oh. Can you get me some quick picks|while you're out? - Sure. How many?|- Oh, five or so. Don't wait up. Good luck. Mind if I sit? How is it you can show your face|without getting hurt? I squared with everyone. - Everyone?|- Okay. So how are you? Tommy, this is|Michael Chambers. Michael,|Tommy Dundee. - Heard you moved.|- Mother's getting married. - To who?|- A good guy. Never heard of him. Well. Let Tommy buy you a drink.|You'll buy him a drink, won't you? - I'll buy him a drink.|- Some other time. Good to see you. - Nice to meet you.|- Uh, yeah. - What the hell was that?|- What? - What's he doing here?|- I don't know. He just showed up. Yeah, nobody's ex just shows up.|He wants something. - Don't have an aneurysm.|- Let's go in the back. I'm tired of watching guys|sit up and b-b-beg you. It's like goddamn|Sea World in here. - Hey, did you get my Twinkie?|- Huh? - My Twinkie. Did you get it?|- I'm sorry, you wanted a Twinkie? - I'm kidding, Michael.|- Oh, okay. - Close it up.|- All right. I hope I didn't wake you|when I came in. Did you get|my quick picks? Oh, jeez, I totally forgot.|I'm sorry. I-I'll get some,|I'll get some today. Rachel called. She leave a number? By the phone. We're on the back nine,|a short par four. I hit a big tee shot. Lands in the wrong fairway. This guy hits a beautiful drive,|cuts past the dogleg, drops about 20 yards|from the pin. Do you wanna hear this? - Please.|- Okay. Uh. - Uh, where was I?|- The pin. Right, right.|So I'm down 200 for the game. This jerk is really ridin' me,|talking about my hair gettin'|in my eyes and crap like that. So I bet him two grand|I could win the hole. He says, why not three? I say,|why not five? Then he hesitates. He says, okay, five.|Then I knew he was... a eunuch. So, I'm 230 yards out,|I hit the best three... wood of my life. I'm on the green,|putting for a bird. He sculls his approach shot,|the ball sails over the green. - He's double bogey for the hole.|- Gosh, that's exciting. - If you keep this up...|- Keep what up? Chambers! - Yeah?|- How'd you know Dallas|was gonna beat the spread? You know, I can't begin|to describe to you how. - I just knew.|- Some people are interested|in trying to garnish your wages. - I suggest you take care of 'em.|- Okay, thanks. Take my advice.|Don't spend that money. - Get yourself squared.|- Thanks. Hmm. Feels almost as good|as you. God, I love betting. I was surprised|to get your call. I was surprised|to see you at the club. Just getting my weekly dose|of secondhand smoke. Right. - So how's the acting gig?|- I gave it up. - Really?|- Isn't that what you wanted? I never interfered. Oh. So beneath|the apathetic exterior, there was actually|a raging indifference. I get it. - So tell me about Tommy Dundee.|- Tommy? - We go out.|- How long? A few months. He treat you okay? Not as well as guys|without money. He's gonna teach me|how to manage the club. He looks like he might be into|a few things besides managing a club. Yeah. - For instance?|- I don't know. You don't know 'cause you don't know,|or 'cause you don't want to know? I don't know|'cause I don't ask. I wrote you a long letter|after you left about everything. - Took me a week.|- I never got it. - I burned it.|- Ooh, I walked right into that one. Must be a new sensation for you,|walking into something. - Is this yours?|- Yup. - Nice.|- Men buy me Mustangs. I don't know why. - Can I see you again?|- I don't think|that's a good idea. - Rachel.|- You humiliated me. I didn't get a warning,|an explanation, and I had to deal with all|the ugly shit you left behind. - It wasn't right.|- I know that. Don't call me.|Don't try and find me. It makes it hard with Tommy. - She goes where?|- To the library. She's been taking this|correspondence course. She's studying. - Until 11:00 every night.|- It closes at 11:00. I checked. Gee, you're a one-man|Warren Commission. Take my advice.|Follow her. - I couldn't do that.|- You'll thank me. - Hey, Ed.|- How's it going, boys? You know, same shit,|different day. I wanted you to meet|Michael Chambers, Annie's boy.|He's putting in an application. - Tom.|- Casey.|- Nice to meet you. - Comin' to work here?|- Yeah.|- You'll love it. If you like saltpeter. Someone under 40, you|tryin' to scare him off? - Just doin' our part.|- Look at us. We're only 22 years old. - See you guys later.|- Nice to meet you. The library? That's right. Ed, Ed! Can you take my spot|on number five run? Deborah's having some|strange contractions... - and I'm gonna meet her|at the doctor's office.|- Okay. Go ahead. - I'll take it.|- Oh, thanks. - You better start workin'|so I can retire.|- I'll do my best. Let me tell you|about Hinkle. When you first go in, he'll offer you a candy mint.|Don't take it. At the end of the meeting,|he'll offer it to you again. Take it and eat it right in front|of him. You'll get the job. You're kidding, right? Do I look like|I'm kidding? - First time, no; second time, yes?|- That's it. Okay. Thanks. Mint? No, thank you. Fine. Ed Dutton speaks highly of you.|He's a very good man, Ed. I hope so. He'll be my stepfather|in a few days. Yes. That's a copy of|Armored Transport Now! It's a magazine we publish, not just for|ourselves, but for the entire industry. And here I thought cash|was on the way out. Many of the services we provide here|used to be provided by the banks. For example, a bank might have us pick up|all the cash from a fast-food chain, process and verify it here and then|deposit it directly into the Fed, bypassing their branch|altogether. - That sort of thing.|- Oh, I see. May I keep this? Where have you been working|the past couple of years? - Offshore.|- That's serious work. - Serious money.|- Mm-hmm. - You have any experience with firearms?|- No. He'll learn. We don't need marksmen,|just people who can think clearly. That I can do. Good. Well. Are you sure you|wouldn't like a mint? Actually, now that you|mention it, I would. Mmm. We'll be in touch.|Sometime this week, we'll have|you come in for the polygraph. A polygraph? Great.|I'll look forward to it. - Where are my fries?|- You didn't ask for fries. - Well, you got fries.|- Michael, you want fries, you gotta ask. Yes, Officer. - How's Rachel?|- She's fine, doing the audition thing. - Tell her I said hello.|- I will. Listen, I talked|to Mom last night. She told me you hadn't|sent her any money in two months. We had an arrangement.|She needs the money. I got the money. I can give it to her|today, with interest. - I can give her three months in advance.|- She doesn't care about interest. She doesn't care about "in advance." She|wants to know if you can be counted on. It's really boring having|this conversation every six months. - I agree.|- Jesus! This is our mother. She needs our help. And seeing you avoid|being around after Dad died... Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. - You didn't even go see her...|- Can we not turn this|into a Eugene O'Neill play? - I've got the money.|- This time. Thanks for the protection, Officer. You never should've left|the Village People, David. Fuck you. - Hello?|- Michael. Hi. - Are you there?|- I'm here. - How are you?|- Good. - What about you?|- Good. - Are you on a car phone?|- Yeah. - Courtesy of...|- Mm-hmm. So, are you staying? I think so.|I might get that job. Really? Um, I gotta go. - W-W-Wait...|- I'll talk to you soon. There's one question|this test never gets around to asking. It's a question|I need an answer to. What's that? When can you start? - That's it?|- That's it. - Welcome aboard.|- Eleven. Forty-one. Twenty-three. Here we go. - What do you think?|- Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry.|Do another one. - Twelve.|- Not so smiley. - Nine.|- Much better. Why go up for this?|It's not acting. It's exposure.|Like Vanna White, you know. Oh. Well, that's|something to aspire to. I hope you like egg salad,|'cause I'm making a ton. Great.|We'll have it for dinner. I thought we were going|to San Miguel. Let's go to San Miguel after the game|on Saturday. I gotta make some calls. I'm not staying in.|I told Diane we'd meet her at the Ember. That's fine.|I'll be here. You never do what|you say you're gonna do. Florida at LSU. This is the|fork in the road for both teams. Some are calling it a toss-up,|but given the home field advantage... and nine apparently|healthy seniors... Hey! Whoa!|Hey! - Remember me?|- Rachel, right? Dick. I'm sorry.|Hi, Dick. God, the picture|on this TV sucks. It sucks,|and it's small. - Smallish and sucky.|...convert that threat|into scoring opportunities. - Everybody in yet?|- No, there's one still out. Hey, come on in! - Mom, you look beautiful.|- Thank you. - You really do.|- Thank you. - That's a nice suit.|- It's Dad's. I-I wanted to give you|this beforehand. Oh! Oh, David,|they're beautiful! I'll have to get|my ears pierced. I don't have anything. That's all right. I'm just glad you're here.|I don't need presents. Would you repeat after me:|With this ring, I thee wed. With this ring,|I thee wed. And pledge to thee|my faith and love. And pledge to thee|my faith and love. I can't believe you wore|Dad's suit to Mom's wedding. I now pronounce you|husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Well, it depends. Some say he's doubtful;|some say he's probable. What's the difference|between doubtful and probable? Doubtful means|he probably won't play; - probable means he'll play,|but there's some doubt.|- Oh, that clears everything up. - So is he doubtful or probable?|- Doubtful. - Michael, did you get a call...|- How close is your source? - You wanna know how close|my source is, he's a she.|- Wow. - This is inside inside.|- Wow. - Michael!|- I gotta go. Talk to you. Isn't that amazing? It's a 12-foot|Paraclipse with terrestrial filters. - I don't care if it turns|coffee beans into diamonds...|- How did you know? - What's it doing in our back yard?|- Wait till you see the image quality. - It's like looking out a window.|- We have plenty of windows. We have one more. It's the new TV. Excuse me.|Is that thing safe? Yes, ma'am.|It's, uh, it's safe. Just don't stand|in front of it. - Come on in.|- Where do you want it? Try right in front of the fireplace.|God, it's big. It's huge. - Did you order a stand?|- It comes with a stand, doesn't it? - It doesn't come with a stand.|- I gotta have a stand. - There's one in the truck. Costs extra.|- Fine, fine. Don't answer that. - The one-fifteen.|- Great! It's huge! - Michael.|- Yeah. Tell me you didn't use|the rest of the money to buy this stuff. - Okay, I didn't use the rest of it.|- Thank God. - I used some of the rest of it.|- Michael! What else was I gonna use?|We've lost our credit cards. - You lost our credit cards.|- Fine, I lost 'em. It doesn't change the fact|that I had to use cash. - How much cash?|- I got an incredible deal|for not charging. - How much? For everything.|- For the dish, the installation, - For everything! Michael!|- The subscription fees... About seven. Hundred? You're so good.|That's good. - Seven... thousand.|- Yeah. How are you gonna pay the people|you owe? They call constantly. Listen. Grrr. I got this whole thing|worked out. It's not even a system.|It's more like, I just know. I just know which way to bet.|It's like being connected. It-lt's like knowing something|that no one else knows. - God, I wish I could describe|the feeling to you.|- You don't have to. - Hey, how did it go?|- What? The audition. Hmm. Did Jane Duncan call|after I left? Jane Duncan? No. When you were on the phone|and I was getting ready,|did anybody try and click through? - I don't know.|- They were trying|to call me not to come. Because they decided to go with a|lottery official instead of an actress. I sat there for an hour looking|like an idiot before somebody told me. I'm sorry.|That must have been awful. - There's the stand.|- Did you at least remember|to get my plane ticket? Yes and no. - What the hell does that mean?|- I did remember, but I didn't get it. - Michael, this audition|has been planned for months!|- I got you something else. - Julie's expecting me!|- I got you something else.|I got you something else. - What? What did you do?|- I'll give you a hint. We don't have enough|to fly to L.A., but you could|drive there in style. What?|That's mine? - Michael...|- You hate it, I'll take it back. - Wait.|- Uh, if you like it, we'll keep it. - You make me really, really mad.|- Ooh, careful! Careful, it'll come off.|Ooh, ooh, ooh. Oh, I don't know,|about 45 minutes. Forty-five minutes?|What do you think went on in there? I don't know.|I wasn't inside. You don't have to be|inside to figure it out. - Look, I gotta trust her.|- Michael Chambers, line 2. - Michael Chambers, line 2.|- You're either very smart|or very stupid. I can't figure out which. - Hello.|- It's me. He proposed. Christ. Christ. What did you say? I pretended I wasn't|expecting it. I said I needed time. This is my problem: When I think about|trying again with you, I have no idea if it's a moment|of strength or a moment of weakness. Do you remember|the last time we went away? - The conversation we had|in front of the fire?|- Yes. I don't want to be on the outside. It's too painful. I won't make that mistake again.|I promise. What do you think would happen|if we went away for the weekend? I don't see how we can|resolve this any other way. We could go back|to Whispering Pines. We could do that. We had a good time there. What about Tommy? I'll pick you up|Friday at 6:00. - Can we take my car?|- Yeah, we can take your car. I forgot. Suddenly, Friday at 6:00|seems like a long way off. It's only two days. - All you have to do is say no.|- No. The mobile customer|is away from the phone... or has traveled beyond the service area.|Please call again later. - Rachel around?|- Nope. - What about Tommy?|- Nope. It's sort of important. We were supposed|to hook up, and she never showed. - Don't know where she is?|- Everybody got in a car and took off. - Where to?|- Uh, Vegas, I think. - Rachel too? You're sure?|- She's hard to miss. Michael. Hi. How are you? - Good. I had a feeling I'd see you.|- Yeah, me too. - Hi, I'm Deborah.|- Hi. Michael.|- I'm sorry. Listen, I'm sorry.|I-I gotta run. - Oh. I'll talk to you soon?|- Yeah. - Still have my number? You're sure?|- Yeah. It was nice to meet you.|I'll speak to you soon. - I gotta go.|- Bye. - He'll call.|- What do you want?|You met the guy on a bus. Have you seen David lately? Not since you and Ed|got divorced... married! I'm sorry.|Excuse me. Michael, when you get to be|my age, you realize... sometimes the planets|just don't line up. And there's nothing|you can do about it. Of course, sometimes|they do line up. And there's nothing you can do|about that either. Hi, this is Susan Crenshaw.|I'm not in right now, but if you leave me a message,|I'll call you right back. - Hi, this is Michael Chambers.|I'm sorry to call so late...|- Hello! - Oh, you're there.|- Yeah. - I just didn't feel|like talking to anybody.|- Okay, bye. No, I didn't mean you. What are you doing? Sittin' around.|What are you doing? Sitting around. Are you with me? Yeah. I feel like you're somewhere else. I feel like I'm|in an ad for fine wine. But it's nice,|really nice. I like to be close. This is close. This is close to you? Isn't it? - You're not very present tense.|- Wh-Wh... Is that like|an acting thing? I love you. - Mmm. That was nice.|- Mmm. There's somebody else,|isn't there? - Sort of.|- Sort of? Where is she? I don't know. There's what you want|and there's what's good for you. - Uh, they never meet.|- They never meet. Except for my mother|and stepfather. Maybe they think they're|wrong for each other. Nah, they're too old|for that shit. Then why do anything|with anybody? Because anything|is better than nothing. The idea that you think you make sense|is really terrifying. Yeah, I know. - Have a nice day, Michael.|- Nice seein' you. That the last of it? - That the last of it, Michael?|- Yeah. Listen. Give me two minutes.|I gotta use the bathroom. Michael? - Oh, hi.|- Hi. - How are you?|- Good. And you? Good. Did you|just get here? - No, just on my way out.|- I have to go downstairs|to meet a delivery. Great.|I'll go with you. Later they find out that Bob,|this manager, is letting|this new guy fill the ATM... without having the second person there|with the offsetting key. Which you're not supposed|to do, obviously. It turns out this guy|was stealing money... and splitting it|with Bob. - A little office intrigue.|- Yeah. - Hello. Susan Crenshaw?|- Yes. I need you to sign. This is for you. - Here you go. Bye-bye.|- Bye. So. Oh. Yeah. - Back to work.|- All right. Take care. - Rachel in tonight?|- Haven't seen her. Hey, I need three scotch waters,|dirty Tanqueray martini up, two Rolling Rock|and a Red Stripe. I'm trying to get a message|to Rachel. Is she here? Tommy's wife?|Yeah. Tommy's wife? Right. Tommy's wife. - Yeah, she's in back.|- Do me one small favor, and the other half... is yours. - Call it.|- It's my club. That's what I call it. Hey. I-I put it down right in front of her,|and she wouldn't look at it, - so...|- Thanks. Yeah! Ow! Loser racks. Whatcha readin' about, hon?|Tit jobs? Yeah, I'm thinkin' about having|one put on my forehead. Ooh. Could be interesting. - What the hell is this?|- What? What the hell is this? I don't know. - Are you rolling this guy|behind my back?|- Tommy. I swear to God I have no idea|how that got there. That's all that happened,|Tommy, I swear. See?|I didn't ask him to come here. If he bribes her to take me a note,|I can't control that. - Tommy, I just...|- Get out of here! - If you want him out of the club,|keep him out.|- You bet I will. If I find out you're seeing him, I'll|make the both of you very uncomfortable. Why "uncontested"? You could've|hit her with the rug salesman. - No point. She'd only|been seeing him a few weeks.|- That the last one? Yup. But if you get adultery,|you can slip out on alimony. - Didn't want to get into all that.|- He'll never make it. The company'll be eating interest|big time, especially on this haul. He'll make it.|He'll make it. George Rittenhouse, line three. George Rittenhouse,|line three. Yeah? What?|Oh, no. I'll be right there. - Deborah broke water.|- Hey, good luck. - Good luck!|- Thanks! So why didn't|you want to get into it? - Bastard. Who?|- Somebody. - Since when?|- Since before the beginning. - Hello. Myself speaking.|- That was a really stupid thing to do. - Don't ever show up again.|- Rach! Where are you? - I'm in my car.|- What happened? I was waiting and you never showed|and then you're fucking married. - What the hell is going on?|- I don't have time|to play games with you. Why didn't you come? It is idiotic to be having|this conversation after what happened. - What are you talking about?|You owe me an explanation.|- Michael. - There's nothing to explain.|- You haven't told me|why you didn't show. - I shouldn't have to.|- What the hell happened to you? All right, let's just get this|over with. Where are you? - I'm in the Salem Street house.|- Oh, God, you're kidding. - You're renting it?|- Yeah. You don't do anything halfway,|I'll give you that. - I'll be there in a minute.|And no funny stuff.|- Fine. - Chambers.|- Yeah? Thirty dimes on LSU. - Thirty?|- Yeah. Okay. All right, all right,|all right, all right. Get us a field goal. - Come on.|- Good call to go for the field goal. You've got time,|if you make it, to go for an onside kick. Here's|the kick. It is long, and it is good. - A tie. I can live with a tie.|- We have a tied game,|with 1:1 to go, at 13. I can live with a tie. Come on, Florida.|Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep. Dropping to throw, Morris. Throwing to the sideline. Complete.|Out of bounds to Emmitt Smith. - And that'll stop the clock.|- We're all right. We're all right. Morris, deep over the middle,|complete to the 45. - Oh, I can't watch this.|- To the 44-yard line. They're edging toward field goal range|with that catch. - Again, Morris...|- Oh, God! God! - They got a bunch of it.|An 18-yard pickup.|- Come on, come on, come on. - Thirty seconds remaining now.|Morris is four out of five.|- Hit him! Hit! Emmitt Smith going to the far side|of the field. That may hurt them, - because they may not|be able to stop the clock.|- No more time outs. They got wrapped up|at the 24-yard line by Jimmy Young. - They're done.|- They're gonna have a hard|time stopping the clock. - The game is over, gentlemen.|- Nine seconds, eight, seven, six, - five, they're at the 24.|- The game is... He drops back and throws it|away with one second remaining. I believe the clock is retired,|but they'll give 'em the one second. They'll give 'em the one second|even though the clock shows nothing. It's come down to this. This field goal try... will be attempted|from about 41 yards. Here's the snap,|the kick; it's high. It is long, and it is...|good! Florida has won|on the final play of the game. Sixteen to thirteen. In the final analysis,|it will be the penalties... and the Tigers' mistakes|that cost them this win, because they really played well|against the Florida Gators. I got good news,|and I got bad news. The good news is I have|till Tuesday to cough it up. The bad news is I have|till Tuesday to cough it up. So I have a year to get you|a present, right? - Yup.|- I figured I'd get you something|you could really use. Like hemlock. Happy? Like an Oscar winner. You know me.|I like money. - Not much.|- Beats goin' to jail. Jail? What's jail|got to do with it? Ask your brother. What?|What did he do? He threatened me. How? When? When you left town,|he was pursuing me. He'd call.|He'd follow me. This went on|for a long time. I kept asking him to stop.|Finally he did. - That night we talked about going away...|- Mm-hmm. He saw us. He saw us in the car. He came to see me. He said he was still|obsessed with me, that if he couldn't have me,|neither could you. He tried to come on to me.|I started screaming at him. If I didn't|stay away from you, - he'd frame me for possession|and send me up.|- Jesus. I tried to call his bluff,|and he pulled out a bag... and started dragging me|to his car. Why didn't you call me? Because when your psychopathic|brother with a badge starts|throwing his weight around, I figured, forget this.|And forget you. The Chambers family|is a bad investment. But why Tommy?|Why marry Tommy? - He did ask.|- Aw, come on. That's not a reason. - You asked once.|- Tell me it was the same thing. Look me in the eye,|and tell me it was the same thing. He treats me bad. - Look at my arms.|- Oh, my God, Rachel. I know they've killed people.|I just know it. I don't know how|to get out of it. You can get out of it. How? I'm married to Mack the Knife.|How do I get out of it? We leave. We'll live somewhere else. I'm good at leaving.|You know that. He'll find us. No, he won't. - What was that?|- Somebody's in the house. Michael? In here. Hi, hon. You know, it don't look right. You... can't exactly say it|looks right, now can you? It's a risk... in business that|the people closest to you... may do you wrong. Usually I can...|figure out a way to get... satisfaction. Let's say they're...|skimming. Well, they can|give me the money back, work it off,|something. I'm... pretty good|at balancing these things out. But, see, you can't|unfuck my wife! So I find myself looking|to the outer edges of... acceptable behavior to... make myself feel better. It's not nice,|what comes to mind. - Tommy, it was my idea to come...|- That's not helping, hon! I wanted to talk to you. So the napkin should have|been under my drink. Now everything makes sense.|I had it all wrong, didn't I? - That's right.|- I see. I wanted to make you|a business proposition. I wanted her opinion first|about how best to approach you. And she suggested that you... seduce her|as a way to approach me? What business could we|possibly have together? A job. A job. A job job? Yeah. Why come to me? You're the only|crook I know. Is that... polite? What kind of a job is it, Michael,|that you need a crook? - Where I work.|- Where you work. Armored cars. I work with armored cars. And? And every Monday the cars|go to the retailers, and they collect all the cash|from over the weekend: Lottery ticket sales|and merchandise sales. It's taken back to the company|to be verified. And the whole wad's|taken to the bank. In one truck. Could be anywhere from a couple|hundred thousand to a million. Small bills. Totally untraceable. Well. Hey, school's out. So what now? - Well, it's you and me, kid.|- What? - George collared me.|- Oh, th-that's not fair.|Y-You've been out all day. What about Casey, Tom? - Suddenly I'm not good enough?|- No, no, that's not it. It's just what I said.|You've been out all day. Aah, it's a short run. - Number 1, Chambers and Dutton.|- Well, here we go. Number 1, Chambers and Dutton. Trucks complete their runs by 4:00. Trucks complete their runs by 4:00. The money's wrapped|and verified by 6:00. The truck has to be|at the bank by 6:30, or the company pays the interest|on missing the day. So the entire facility is geared towards|getting every dollar on that truck. This is how it works.|When we get into the bank, there are loading docks|in the secured delivery area. You go in, just after we arrive,|in a van, posing as a legitimate vendor using the|4-digit access code which I'll provide. - And then you scoop it up.|- How do you make sure|you're the driver? I check. If I'm not assigned,|I go to the driver... and tell him|I need the extra hours. - And he just gives them to you?|- I can be pretty persuasive. Hmm. If it goes smoothly,|they'll know somebody was on the inside. - They're gonna put heat on you.|- I just keep denying it.|There's nothing they can do. - They're gonna put heat on you.|- I just keep denying it.|There's nothing they can do. All right, this is how we'll handle it.|I know this guy, a broker. I don't know his name,|and I don't want to know his name, because he is serious. You think I can exert pressure?|This guy scares the shit out of me. But this is what he does...|He organizes jobs. He's got some high-level day gig|with an insurance company or something, so he knows all the ways to|beat the cops and the ops. That's why nobody knows him|by name or face. I call him up and tell him everything|about what we're doing. And then he puts the whole|thing together. He hires the men from out of town.|You won't know them. They will not know you.|They'll just do the job, and then they will drop|at a predetermined time... to a predetermined person|at a predetermined place. That's good.|Who handles the drop? We'll use one of my guys. - I want somebody I know.|- Gee, that's tough, Michael!|I want somebody I know! - What about her?|- "What about her" what? He wants you to hold|the money. And if I say no? - Then it's off.|- You're holdin' the money. When? - The sooner the better.|- One more thing.|I'm not taking a short count. The broker alone takes 20 percent|on any job he crews. It's a two-way split.|You can cut your half any way you like. I'd rather eat airline food. Can you do it without me? - Well, Michael, you know I can't.|- Then it's 50-50. - I don't like it.|- When you see all that|cash, you'll like it. So what's the total|for the day? About a million three. Hello? - Hello?|- When you pass Brazos... - Who is this?|- Shut up. When you pass Brazos|going down Fifth Street, you'll see a man wearing|a yellow suit and sunglasses. If our end is going according to plan,|he'll take off his sunglasses. If your end is going|according to plan, you signal him by lifting your fingers|off the wheel for one second. If you don't lift your fingers,|we will assume you want to abort. Wh-What if... Thanks for calling. Are you sure we should|go through with this? You could say they|wouldn't switch you... No, no, we're very close now.|We have to follow it through. It's gonna be fine. This time tomorrow,|the hard part will be over. God, I hope so. Once you get the drop, drive|straight to Whispering Pines. Don't stop for anything. It may take me a couple of days.|They'll be asking questions. We'll have to let things|cool off. I can't wait for this|whole thing to be over. Watch it! Jesus! Sorry. Whenever you're ready,|Michael. Yeah. - Cash or coins first?|- Ed, I hate to ask you this,|but could I stay with the truck? - How come?|- Well, there's a woman|in the bank I'd prefer not... - Ohh, a woman. |- No problem. Thanks. Susan!|Hey, hey, how are you? Good. Stay there! Ed, get down! Are you awake? I don't know. I might...|I might be dreaming. I might be dreaming. You're going|to be fine. They say you'll recover completely. Mmm. Everyone is very proud of you. Proud? For trying to stop the robbery. I'm... I'm really sorry you couldn't save Ed. I know you tried. I know you tried. I'm tired, so tired. Michael. Michael, if you can|understand me, just nod. I-I can understand. I want to let you know that|Perennial Armored Car... - is very proud of your performance.|- Very proud. And even though you've only been|with the company a short time, we want to make very sure|that you don't worry about the|financial side of your illness. As a matter of fact,|when the time comes, we'd like very much to do|an in-depth profile of you|for Armored Transport Now! I think I told you it's read|by everyone in the industry. - Don't forget about Mr. Fox.|- Oh, yes, Mr. Fox, the founder of Perennial|and a wonderful man, would like to meet you and have|his photograph taken with you... to accompany the article. When the time comes,|of course. When the time comes. I said, is there something|I should know? Ah, you're all right. Yeah. Yeah.|How about you? I can't tell. Michael.|Michael. They've been|asking questions. The police and your brother. My brother. I think they want something. And I don't think what they want|is good for you. I told you. Those things never meet. Yeah, you told me. I told you. I told you.|I told you. No, you didn't,|Mr. Chambers. - I'm sorry?|- I want you to describe what happened... from the moment you entered|the delivery bay of Grand Texas Bank... until you lost|consciousness. I... I-I pulled up. I pulled into the dock. - Dock number one.|- Yes, number one. I-I-I a-and Ed. I, uh, I turned the engine off, and, and Ed... Oh, they killed him.|Didn't they kill him? Yes. Maybe, uh,|maybe we should come back. You fake bastard. You think you got everybody fooled. You think because the job|was sloppy and people got shot, nobody thinks you were in. It won't wash. I'm gonna bring you down. Not because you got Ed killed, although that would be plenty|reason enough. But because I think|you're worthless. You've always|been worthless. You were nonexistent|as a brother to me. You didn't lift a finger|to prop Mom up after Dad died. You've skated along on your looks|and charm, just like a woman, leaving everybody else|to clean up after you. Well, I'm gonna|clean up, all right, and I'm starting|with you. Get out. - You're an accessory to murder.|- No, you don't know|what you're talking about. - You were the inside man;|we both know it.|- You've got nothing. I've got a bank employee you seduced|to obtain a vendor I.D. Number. Uh-huh. How did it happen?|They come to you? Trap you into it?|Was it her? What kind of shit did she tell you?|Did she make you promises? Tell you Tommy was mean to her,|you two should run away together? Or did she get you in a compromising|situation? You only had one way out. Was it like that? You really think|she's waiting for you? You think you're safe from the bears,|locked in your log cabin, bolts on the door? Well... You just locked yourself inside with|another bunch of grizzlies. Here's how. Let's say she is on the level. She double-crossed Tommy Dundee,|and she's waiting for you. You think Tommy Dundee is gonna|let you get away with that? You better hope she double-crossed you|and that her and Tommy are laughing, because if she's not|with him right now, somebody's gonna make their|way in here to check on you. And they won't be interested|in your full recovery. I suppose I could|protect you, stake somebody outside|the door. But since you're|such a hero, I convinced my boss you|wouldn't need protection. Who'd want to hurt|the man of the hour? The pillar of courage? Hell, people want to|shake your hand. Couple uniforms downstairs to keep away|the press and the well-wishers, sure. But somebody|outside the door? What's the point? - It's all your fault.|- Right! - Oh, if you'd left her alone.|- No. If you had left her alone! What is it with you? Thank God|you're bedridden. I wouldn't be able to stomach|the hypocrisy of you showing up|to Ed's funeral... and standing next to our mother. Mr. Chambers, how are you?|What can I help you with? Could you adjust these pillows?|My neck is really getting stiff. Of course. Well, part of the problem|is you've got your bed... tilted too far forward.|Let me take you down... No, no, no!|I really like it this way. - But...|- It's just the pillow. The angle's fine. - If you could just adjust the pillows.|- All right. - How's that?|- Fine, thank you. I was about to see you anyway.|It's time for your pill. That's all right.|I really don't need it. Well, I think you'll find it|very difficult to sleep without it. It's okay. Maybe a little later.|I really feel okay. Well, you don't look okay. No, really.|I'll have it later. If you say so. Say... Could you tell me who|that gentleman is waiting out there? Why is he here? Oh, that's Mr. Rodman. His sister was in a traffic accident|last night and hasn't woken up yet. Maybe he'd like to come in|and talk to me? I don't know.|I can certainly ask, although visiting hours|are nearly over. Could you ask? I'd really,|really appreciate it. Of course. Leave the door open! - Why, Mr. Rodman said|he'd be happy to talk with you.|- Thank you. Uh, Mr. Rodman? Mr. Chambers. - Howdy.|- Hello. Uh, she said you just wanted|to talk about... Yeah, l-l-l...|Please, sit down. I-I-I, uh, I just|sorta came alive... and felt like talking. With my luck, all my|visitors were already gone. I'd reckon you'd|get a lot of visitors. - Why do you say that?|- You're famous, ain't ya? Yeah. Well. Oh, boy. What's that? Your pills? Yeah. - That's a pain pill, ain't it?|- Yeah. That'll make you sleep. - You better take it, hadn't you?|- No. I'm fine. Okay. So, who, uh...|What you got in there, spare shoes? - What's that?|- In your coat. Oh, I gotta carry that|for my job. They're obnoxious as hell, but... I'm in real estate, and|I really don't have a choice. They're convenient. So, where'd you|say you work? Oh, I didn't.|Uh, Don Sembera Realty. Oh. How long you|been there? About six years. You must know|Jeanette Scott. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Jeanette. Yeah, she sold me|a house once. - Is that right?|- Yeah. Small world. Who are you? I don't know.|Who do you want me to be? Who are you?|Did Tommy send you? Buddy, I don't know|who you're talking about. Tommy? I don't know any Jeanette Scott.|I made that up. Thank you. I-I didn't know|who you were talkin' about either. I didn't know... I didn't recognize|that name. I was tryin' to be agreeable. Trying to be agreeable!|Tommy Dundee sent you here to kill me! I'll leave. I was tryin'|to be nice. I'm sorry. I mean, goddamn you. Goddamn you.|My sister's layin' down there, and I don't know|if she'll get up again. - There's other people in here|got problems.|- Wait. Wait, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.|Please forgive me. I'm... I'm... I guess|I'm a little spooked. Half the time l...|l... - I don't know what I'm saying.|- I know, I don't usually talk|like that either, but... you catch me off guard|like that... She told me you wanted me|to come in here and talk. - I know. I'm sorry.|- I wanted to talk too. P-P-Please sit down again. I'm sorry. So, uh, tell me about your job. Do you like it? I got a good job. The market... basically sucks right now, but... It's... Unless you're buying. Uh, you weren't thinking|about buying, were you? Somebody's gettin' sleepy|over there. Sorry. Uh, I'm gonna let you sleep. - No, no, please.|- I'm gonna get out of here. - No. Can't do it.|- Uh, could you do me a favor? Just a small favor. A favor? Yeah, I'd really|appreciate it. Really. It ain't a sponge bath, is it? That was good. If you could, uh, just wait here until|I've gotten a little nap? Just sit here with me for a while|until I've slept good. I'd like to, but...|I got my sister down there. Please. L... I just need a little sleep. - Okay. Just for a little bit, okay?|- Thank you. I'm just so, uh... I'm just gonna sit|over here, okay? It's time to go. What's he payin' you? Ten?|Twenty-five? I'll give you|a hundred. You know I've got it. You know I do. Rachel. I don't know how it happened when you|were a kid, or who you learned it from. But you have very strange|ideas about... sharing. All our negotiating,|20 percent, 50 percent, that's playground bullshit. A fair share|is whatever you can take. And I'm taking everything. Oh, Jesus Christ,|Howard! You're not gonna bleed|like this are you? Rachel. Rachel. Rachel. Rachel! Please. Are you fucking|kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me? You have made a mistake. I will deal with you|and your mistake in a moment. You... You don't have any choice.|You have to shoot me. But I don't think you will. Oh. I can't get up. If you could just...|give me a hand... When you left, there was|something I didn't understand. You didn't just leave me,|you left... everybody. Everything. It made me feel very... interchangeable. But now I understand the appeal|of just walking away. There's something very powerful|about being absent. I think you did the right thing|when you left. But you shouldn't have|come back. Rachel.|Rachel, please. Michael. Right?
