The next person to take advantage of you, Mrs Lippmann, will be the first. How's that lovely daughter of yours? - She's fine, thank you. - Send her my best. Good Shabbos to you, Mr Steinberg. Good Shabbos. Ah, Mrs Lippmann! - For your little friend. - Oh, thank you. That's very kind of you. Thank you. Something else, Mrs Lippmann? Oh, um... let me see. I'll have a piece of that chocolate cake, please. How big a piece would you like? - Bit more. - Here? - That'll be fine, thank you. - Good. Hello? Hello? Something else, Mrs Lippmann? Um, no. No, that'll be all, thank you. Mrs Wilburn? Mrs Wilburn? Oh, hello, Zucchini. I've got something nice for you later. Shh! Where do you live? Get off me! Move! Open the door. Please do it! Do you live alone? Huh? I said, do you live alone? You're a Jew. Ah! Do not move, Jew. Get up. Oh! Sit there. No! Please don't hurt me. Killing you means nothing to me. I simply rid the world of one more Jew. Do you have a car? Are you deaf? I said do you have a motor car? Uh... uh... Jamal, Yusuf is with the Prophet. In paradise. Everything went wrong, Jamal. Everything went wrong. The number you are calling is switched off. Please try again later. You're a Palestinian. What have you done? I know you've done something terrible. Shh! I lived in Israel for many years... I said shut up, Jew! I've known men like you all my life. You know nothing of me. I know what it is to have men stomp up the stairs, march away with the women and the children. I've known this. I've seen this! No! No, please! No! Hello? Hello, Mama? Hello? Are you there? - H-hello. - Oh, thank God. Oh, Sophie. I was so worried about you. I have been ringing and ringing. Hello? I- I was shopping, darling. I'm fine. Have you heard? There was a bomb at the Balaclava Shule. It's on TV. It's horrible. Mama? Is anybody hurt? People have been killed. A lot of people. Nobody knows how many yet. They'll be people that we know. You know that, don't you? How could anybody do this? I don't understand. What would possess somebody to do something like this? Are you sure you're OK? Hello? No, I'm... I'm fine. You've got to stay off the streets now. You've got to stay inside. That's what they're saying. Or come to Sydney, stay with us. No, this is my home. I lived here with your father. I can't just leave. Well, promise me you'll just stay inside. You... you worry too much. Just promise me, OK? OK, OK. Good. I'll call you tomorrow. Kiss the children for me. What? What are you talking about? I- I said kiss the children. But they're in New York. You know that. Are you OK? I'm fine. OK, stay inside. I will call you tomorrow. - I love you. - I love you too, darling. 'Bye. It doesn't work. If you have any information regarding this matter, please call the number on your screen. Police are continuing their search for a second man they believe may be able to help with their inquiries. Again, that hotline number... They will find you. You know that, don't you? It's just a matter of time. When they find you, they will kill you. I am not afraid to die. Oh, such a brave man. If you do not shut up... ...I will kill you where you sit. I'm an old woman. Do you think I'm afraid to die? No! I-I... no, I do have a car! There is a car. It was my husband's. You take it. You take that and you go. Scream and you die. Oh, why should I scream? I want you to go. The keys. - Where are the keys? - They're up there. No. - No. I stay. No. - Get in. Why can't I go? You have the car. Oh! Mrs Lippmann! Mrs Lippmann! Oh, Mr Nathan, I'm sorry I took so long. Good Shabbos, Mrs Lippmann. And to you. Mrs Lippmann, have you heard what happened? I can't believe it. Here, in this country! Terrorists, fanatics. They should be taken out, put up against a wall and shot, all of them! Prison is too good for these people. - I... I agree with you. - It's a terrible thing. A terrible thing! Ah, oh... Oh. Have you guests, Mrs Lippmann? No, no. I thought maybe your daughter is staying. I... I have to go, Mr Nathan. I need to lie down. I'm really very tired. I'm sorry to disturb you, Mrs Lippmann. I brought this up for you. Oh, thank you. It's very kind of you. Move! Mrs Lippmann, I'm sorry to disturb you again, but is this yours? I thought maybe you had dropped it. I found it just there. Oh, thank you. What would I do without you? You are very kind. Please leave. I want you to leave, right now. You think I want to be here? How can you do these things? I am a soldier. This is what soldiers do. You're not a soldier. You're a terrorist. You know nothing. You people are everywhere. You have infected the world. - You heard what happened? - Yes, yes, I did. You'll need a doctor. I've seen men die from losing blood. I know what I'm talking about. I was a nurse. Who is this? That's my son. It was taken a long time ago. Where? Where was the photograph taken? In Israel. Was he born there? No. Of course not. He was born in Germany. What was he doing in Palestine? Well, we went to live there after the war. What gave you the right to live in Palestine? We were given the right. We'd lost our homes, we'd lost everything, so that's why we went. So it was OK for you to occupy my country? That's not how it was. Then how was it? We were Jews. We had no land of our own. - You are fucking terrorists! - No. You take our homes. Move our people from their land. You treat us like dogs. You want Palestine without the Palestinians. You think you are better than us. Oh, that's not true. So where is your son? He's still occupying my country, isn't he? - No. - Then where is he? He is dead. The world is full of suffering. The Jews think they have more right to suffer than anyone else. Hello. Hello? There's no-one there. The number you are calling is... Hello. Hello, Jamal. The number you have called is disconnected. Please check the number before calling again. He doesn't want to speak to you. You need a doctor. No. No, don't... don't gag me, please. I... I won't call out. L-I... I need to sleep. Help me. Oh, my God. Oh, help me. My pills. Oh, I need my pills. It's my heart. My heart pills. I need my pills. Wake up. Wake up. My heart pills. I could die. Please... untie me. Please. Untie me. I'll get my pills. God! Come on. - Please. Untie me! - Hey, hey. Oh! "Despite all efforts by our surgeons, "your son succumbed to his wounds "early this morning. "All at Sadan Command share in your family's grief at this time "and deeply regret his loss." Excuse me. Um, I would like to report... - Name, please. - Oh, uh, Mrs Lippmann. - Back at my home there is... - Balaclava Police. Just take a seat over there, madam. I'll be with you in a moment. Where did this happen? Yep. Right. Just come in over here. OK. Mrs Lippmann. Mrs Lippmann? Oh, God help me. What have I done? How dare you?! How dare you bring that into my home? Could that explode if you take it off? Take it off. Why have you done this? I said, take it off. Why are you helping me? Why didn't you blow yourself up like the other man? I think, when the time came to actually kill people... ...you couldn't do it, could you? I am a coward. No. Not doing such a thing doesn't mean you are a coward. Something stopped you. What was it? What was it stopped you? Tell me what stopped you. I am a soldier. You are not a soldier. I am ready to avenge the blood of generations, to strike terror into the infidels... You kill innocent people. - YOU kill innocent people! - No. I'm talking about ordinary people. Innocent people who are murdered. Innocent people die every day at the hands of the Jews in my country. They occupy my country, they kill my people. Innocent... people. Innocent people. You were in a concentration camp. I was the only one of my family to survive. So you know what it is to hate. If you could, you would have killed them, wouldn't you? The Nazis. The ones who killed your family. You would. What I know is... ...that your mother would not want you to do this. My mother would be proud. - Oh, no. I am a mother... - You are not MY mother. Those who die soldiers of the Prophet live with him in paradise. It is our way. Our mothers would be proud of that. Mothers don't make wars. If this world was run by mothers, there would be more sons. Are you not proud of him? Well, of course I am. Then tell me how he died. Tell me. You're so proud. Tell me how he died. Tell me. My son died a soldier. An Israeli soldier. He died killing... ...my people. Does that make him a better man than me? I'm helping these officers, Mrs Lippmann. Thank you, Mr Nathan. You can go now. Sorry to trouble you, madam... This is Mrs Lippmann. She is a good woman. Upset, of course, by these very terrible events, as we all are. - I mean, isn't that right... - Thank you, sir. You can go now. Oh, anything else I can help, you know where I live. We'll talk later, Mrs Lippmann. Now, madam, you're aware of what happened yesterday? Yes, of course. We just need to ask you a few questions. What... what sort of questions? It is Mrs Lippmann, isn't it? - Ja. - Do you mind if we come inside? Oh, no. I'm sorry. That's not convenient at the moment. Madam, I must insist. This is about the terrorist attack. No! How dare you? You've no right to come in here. It's just that everything's such a mess, you know? Have a seat, Mrs Lippmann. This will only take a moment. Have you seen this man? Oh. Um... No. No. I've never seen him. What are you doing? Aren't you supposed to have a search warrant to do this? You said you wanted to help, Mrs Lippmann. Excuse me. This is my bathroom. What you expect to find in an old woman's bathroom? I was making myself some coffee. Would you like some? Thanks, but no. If you do see anything suspicious, anything at all, please call this number. And we advise you not to open your door to any strangers. Have a good day, Mrs Lippmann. They've gone. You can come out now. When I was eight years old... ...I was playing in the street with my friends. It was just after I'd eaten at home. I remember my mother telling my baby sister, Lina... ...not to rub her eyes with her hands. They were itchy. "They won't get better if you keep touching them," she said. My mother smiled. When I was outside with my friends... ...the Israeli tanks came. It was not the first time. We were used to tanks in our village. We were used to funerals in our village. The men on our roof started firing at the tanks. Our house... ...and shop were completely destroyed. It happened so quickly. Everything was gone. My mother... ...my father... ...my baby sister, Lina. All dead. She was only five years old. She used to wear a small gold crescent. I keep it with me. Where will you go? I don't know. I have friends in Sydney. Well, I know about your friends. No. University friends. Is that you? Mmm. We met before the war. We married afterwards. Oh, it was a miracle we both survived. I was so young when I met him. It was 1939, and I looked at him and I saw that he had dirty fingernails and the heels were walked off his shoes and when he talked, he looked down. Now, my father had always said, "Don't bring anybody home who has dirty hands "and can't look you in the eye and has untidy shoes," and I thought... ...I thought, well, this is going to be a very difficult meeting. He was a nice-looking boy. And a wonderful dancer. Oh, we would dance and dance. We'd put on my parents' records... Franz Esling and the Dance Orchestra. And we loved the waltz. And then... ...well, the Nazis came and they, you know... ...they started rounding people up. They separated the men from the women and the children and I thought... ...I thought I'd never see him again. It was a miracle. It was a miracle we both survived. Yeah. I saw a little girl. Five years old, maybe six. She looked at me. I couldn't do it. I could not move. She was like my sister. My friend Yusuf walked in, turned and looked back at me. He knew I was not going to do it. I was hit by flying metal. I ran away like a dog. No-one has died by your hand and God knows that. The reason why you could not do it has nothing to do with your sister. It's because of what's in here. Deep inside you. And you should not feel ashamed. There's no honour in killing people. This was taken on the boat the day we left Europe. Ari was 2.5. He was running around trying to pull the labels off people's luggage. Oh... what a boy. And the photographer said, "You are taking that boy to the land of his forefathers." Oh, we were so happy. And then, when he died, I had to leave Israel so... ...we came here with Sophie. You know, I lived in this place with my husband for many years. And then one day I came home... I thought he was sleeping. He looked so peaceful. And I took his hand. And it was cold. The fingernails were still dirty. Be careful. Hello? May I speak to Sadiq, please? I would like to speak to Sadiq, Mrs Lippmann. Jamal. Do not answer it again. They are coming to kill me. I have one on Qantas flight QF430. Departs Melbourne 12:00pm, arrives Sydney 1:20. Good. How much? I am paying cash. And name of person travelling... it's one 'P', two 'N's? No, no, no... two 'P's, two 'N's. Lippmann. Of course. And your first name again, Mrs Lippmann? A- R-I. Ari. Ari Lippmann. It's for my son. Are you there, Mrs Lippmann? Mrs Lippmann? Mr Nathan. What are you doing in my home? Mrs Lippmann. I'm so glad. I was worried about you. So was Sophie. Sophie? What, my Sophie? What are you talking about? She called me. She was worried. She tried to phone you. Mr Nathan, Sophie treats me like a child. I would thank you not to do the same. Now, could I have my key back, please? Mr Nathan, do you mind if I have some privacy? What would you have done if he'd found you? Jaeger Road, number 24. No, no... 2, 4. One. Lippmann. Yes, ready now. You'll have to hurry. You have to go. You'll miss the plane. What will you do when Jamal comes? Oh, I will say you are gone. Now... you have everything. Now just go. No. Wait. Go. God go with you. You have no luggage, sir? Ari! Your book. Oh! Target down. Oh! Oh! Oh, get away from him! Get away! Oh! No! No. No. Oh, no, no, no, no. In breaking news, the second of the terrorists responsible for the bombing of the Balaclava Synagogue was shot dead today by members of the Special Operations Group. The man had been holding an elderly member of the Jewish community hostage for the past two days.
