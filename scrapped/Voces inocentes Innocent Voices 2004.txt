 

                        In 1980, a civil war erupted|in the small country of El Salvador. It began as a conflict between|the Salvadorean Army and the peasants over land. The peasants soon organized and|became the guerrilla army known as the FMLN. This conflict escalated into|a brutal civil war that would last 12 years. Cuscatanzingo was one of the last villages|trapped between the guerilla and the army. Here is where this story takes place. INNOCENT VOICES BASED ON A TRUE STORY I'm so thirsty... ...and my feet hurt. I have rocks in my shoes. They're going to kill us for sure. Why do they want to kill us|if we haven't done anything? My dad left us... ...and went to the United States|when the war started. Mom didn't come|out to say goodbye. She said that now I was|the man of the house. But first I had to pee. Two wings.|Who could have two wings? Two wings to fly. This afternoon in the mountains,|I almost had them... ...and the desire to spread|them open over that sleepy ocean. No, not me! Fito, help me! Help me! Let's go. I'm home, Mom! I'm sorry. I had to walk Antonio|and Fito home. Don't they have feet|to find their own way? You know how chicken they are. Don't be late again. These soldiers aren't playing. One day, God forbid, they'll grab|a rifle and shoot you. You understand? Yes, Mom. Temo! Temo!|Temo! Temo! We were all scared|of turning 12... ...because that's|when the army takes you. I had one year left. You know, Ancha?|Me and you are alike. We are!|We're both little. - Yes, I'm little.|- Big. In size, but not up here. Ancha was my friend. Everyone said he was|a fish brain. Thank you, Anchita. But he was the only one who|wasn't scared to have a birthday. Good. God bless. Hi, farty sister. Where were you?|It's late. - Take care of your brother and sister?|- Don't worry. Rosita... ...dear, don't feed Ricardito|after eight, okay? Even if he screams. Why, mommy? I love you.|Take out the garbage. And close the door, bolt it|and don't let anybody in. - You're my man of the house.|- Yeah, right, the man of the house. You don't even know|how to wipe your own butt. Leave my brother alone!|Come and eat. He fell asleep. The mattresses, Chava! I want my mommy! Watch out, Chava!|Don't get up there! Get under the bed!|Quick! Get under here! - Good night.|- Good night. Grandma Mama Toya! Mama Toya! - Have you heard from Beto, mother?|- Nothing. I haven't heard|from your brother... ...since they closed|the university. Let's hope he's alright. We'd know if he wasn't.|Bad news travels fast. He'll show up. It was really bad last night. And the kids were alone. I have to quit my job. And who's going to support you? Why don't you come live here? How can we, Mother?|There's not enough room. I don't mean with me.|Refugio's house is empty. That way I can keep|an eye on the kid's... ...and help with their homework. If we move,|he'll never find us. Don't fool yourself. Those who go North|get swept away. Lift your head up, Kella. Those who leave suffer|more than those who stay... ...and those who stay fight. Take these savings... ...and buy yourself a weapon. Since Mom started|working at home... ...the war didn't seem so big. Beto loves you a little,|a lot, or nothing at all. Cecilia!|It's curfew, go home. Just a little longer. Angelita, don't worry|your grandma. Go inside. Please, grandma, five minutes.|Tell her. Bye. You too, Chava. One day, there they were.|The Gringos. The same as they are|in the movies. They said they were|here to help us. Don Yeyo! Spit that out, Chava. - Don't you hear me? Spit it out.|- Why? It's yummy. Because the men who|gave you that gum... ...are training our soldiers|to kills us. Not so yummy anymore,|is it? Angelita finished first|in her class... ...so her grandma is|taking her to the beach. - But she's a dummy.|- What do you know? Lots. You wish. - You too.|- Kids! - You more.|- Kids! Go to sleep. Get on the floor! Ricardito! Ricardito! Get down! Uncle Mario! Dear God... why? Why? Why? What happened? You drunk! Wake up! Go home shame on you. - I'm going to tell your mom.|- Don't get mad, lady... - ...he'll get his cut.|- Drunks! It's for the hangover. What hangover?|Go home! It's for the hangover. This time nothing sold. I'm sorry, Chavita. Are you trying to steal it? - What are you doing? Answer me!|- Just playing. - With whose permission?|- I need to work. - You want my job?|- No. Take it.|It's yours. I got you, kid!|I got you! Why do you like driving? Because... you go lots of places... ...cruise the streets|and make lots of money. Yeah, right. - How old are you?|- 11. Let's see. Stand up. Hold on, hold on. You want to work? Here's the deal. You call the stops,|I collect the fares and drive. But if you rob me,|I'll cut your balls off. Shorty. Downtown! Downtown! Downtown! What happened with the dresses? Where did you get that? I didn't sell anything,|but I got a job on the bus. So you don't have|to work so much. You should have asked me first, right? Can I? Will you be careful? And you'll be back|before curfew everyday. I promise, ma. - Where did you get the money?|- I got a job. - I'm driver.|- Yeah, right. Did you hear Miss Sol|had a nervous breakdown? - Why?|- Because of all the shooting. They say she's in the nut house. Chava!|Chava! The following boys will form a line. Pablo Argueta... ...Manuel Ayala... ...Antonio Gutirrez... ...Jos Rendn... ...Alfredo Argueta... ...Mario Snchez... - What's your name?|- Temo. - Temo what?|- Morales Morales. - Get in line!|- He's only ten! It's not fair!|How can you do this?! - Temo! Temo!|- Sergeant! Sergeant! Soldier! Mario Snchez... ...Arturo Reyes... ...Gerber Reyes... ...Roberto Olsen... Continue. Roberto Olsen... ...Bardo Prez... ...Agustin Reina. Quickly! Quickly! You should feel proud, boys. You're going to be soldiers like us. You will defend your country. Sergeant... ...let's go. Who gave the order to do this? Step aside, Father. Worry about their souls. Hi, baby.|How was school? Are you deaf? How was school? What's wrong, baby? Tell me. Did somebody hit you? - Did the teacher punish you?|- They took Antonio. - Antonio? Who took him?|- The soldiers. They took him in a truck|with some other boys. And they took Temo. Temo? To find the common denominator... ...multiply these two numbers... - 3x4?|- 12. Very good. YOU'RE UGLIER THAN A FROG|CHAVA If you like her so much,|go tell her. Don't be a chicken. Hi. Hi. I wanted to know|if... maybe... ...if you can...|and if you want to... ...come play with Chele,|Marcos, Fito, Ancha and me. We're going to fly|paper fireflies. - Uglier than a frog?|- I didn't write that. No?|Then who? If you want, we can meet at|Dona Celia's at 4. Okay. - Let's go!|- Let's go, Chava! - The paper fireflies were fun.|- Yeah. Well... I have to go. Bye. Ancha! Let's go! We were flying paper fireflies... ...and they started shooting|and we had to run for it. I'm going to show you some fireflies.|So you learn to be back early! Sit down and eat. Stinky girl! Farty sister. Sorry, ma. Yuck... ...that really stinks. Uncle Beto! ...so, mom bought|a sewing machine. She makes dresses|and I sell them. And I give her my money|from the bus. I collect fares|and call the stops. Yeah? Show me. Downtown! Downtown!|Downtown! That's great, munchkin. And since mom keeps telling|me I'm the man of the house... ...I take care of my|brother and this one. Yeah, right.|Especially me. I'm glad you're|so responsible, munchkin. Daddy! Oh, this boy!|He calls every man "Daddy". - What's your name, little boy?|- Ricardito. Ricardito. Mom is worried about you. Don't disappear like that again. You're not in trouble,|are you? My brother takes care|of me and one day... ...he bought me a cookie but|I dropped it and the ants ate it. Chava, the mattress! Chava, Rosita!|Under the bed. Shhh, baby. Angelita! Angelita.|My God... Help! Dona Amalia, it's Beto!|I'm coming! Beto! What are you doing? - Chava! Chava!|- Angelita! Angelita! Get down, Chava! Get down! Baby? Chava! - What's happened?|- My girl. I'm here with you,|don't be afraid. Chava, press here.|Hard, okay? Uncle Beto! Kella! Stay there! Don't move! Angelita! My girl, don't leave me! - Angelita!|- Help me, please! My girl is dying! Don't leave me. Angelita! Angelita! - Angelita!|- Baby! Baby!|Baby! Oh God! Please help me! Angelita! My girl. Dear God! My girl! Dear God,|my girl has died. What's happened? Oh God, help me! Don't cry, baby! Don't play that, Beto.|They'll kill us all. How sad the rains sounds... on the cardboard rooftops. How sad my people live... in the cardboard houses. Children the color of my land... with the same scars... bellies bloated with worms. Look at the suffering. The burden of the suffering. Above in the village... he leaves his pregnant wife. Below in the city... he gets caught in it's web The bullet that killed Angelita could|have come from the guerrilla. How long have you been involved? For a while. We're preparing an offensive|to disrupt the army, Kella. This is the only place left between|the capital and the guerrilla. And it's going to explode. It's going to get dangerous. It's going to get much worse. Chavita's about to turn 12.|We've got to get him out of here. Yes... ...your side also take boys. Morazn and San Vicente|are liberated areas. He'd have a roof.|He'd have food. We're building schools. What he needs, Beto... ...is to be here,|with me. He's too little. - If you stayed here with us--|- Kella... You've got to understand, please. The army will take him away. At least with me,|he'd be safer. Let me take him. - Got a girlfriend?|- Just one. Just one? - What's her name?|- Cristina Mara. The new teacher's daughter. She's the prettiest of all. Listen, Chavita. What I'm about to tell you is|very important. So pay attention. What happened to Angelita|are things that happen. Chavita, I won't lie and say|things are going to get better... ...because they'll get worse|before they get better... Understand? This might help you understand|what's going on. Look for "Radio Venceremos" here. It's the voice of our people. It's not always on,|so you have to keep looking. But Chava, it's banned|so you have to be careful. You can find the song|I played last night. Did you like it? - Ratn!|- Chavita! Will I see you again,|uncle? Next time I'll take you with me. At this moment we are|broadcasting... ...Radio Venceremos, voice|of the guerrilla resistance... What's your answer? Hey, no! And you? I asked you first. One. Two. - Three!|- Three! Can we go out? - Did you finish your homework?|- Yes. Okay... ...but don't forget the curfew.|Chavita, take care of her. Let's go. Don Yeyo! Hey... That's, Don Yeyo. He won't talk to anyone|except to his animals. Why?|Doesn't he like people? This song is banned. My mom says we have to fight|so that nothing is banned. - You're really pretty.|- And you're uglier than a toad. But I like you too. Damn! Bastards! - Good afternoon.|- Good afternoon. See you. Let them go! - Let them go!|- Let them go! Out of the way!|Move! - Father!|- To what do I owe this miracle? Are you okay? Yes, Chava. Thank you. The soldiers hit you really hard. There are worse pains than this. And the girls? Did they recruit them too? No. Are they going to kill them? Here... ...help me light the candles. Get out of the way!|Come on! Come on!|Are you crazy?! I hate loudmouth women. Didn't you see it was|running out of gas? What?|Was I the one driving? Can I? You look like a bald girl. What's wrong with you, baby? What happened?! We were working and|we ran out of gas... ...he started sucking gas|from the can with the hose... ...he swallowed half. You irresponsible old man! Daddy! Daddy, my ass! Get out! Don't come|near my son again! Get out! ...in the cardboard houses... Down comes the workman... Turn it off. Turn it off! Below in the city... ...he gets caught in its web. That song is forbidden, Father. Nothing is forbidden to God. I must ask you to turn it off. Turn it off yourselves. But|leave your weapons here. No one may enter the house|of the Lord with weapons. Children the color|of my land... What kind of crap|is in your head? What did I do now? Give me the radio. Why?|I didn't do anything. Don't lie to me. I'm sorry, mom.|I didn't mean to. I won't do it again. I know you won't. Because you're going to give|me that radio right now. I won't do it again. I'm sorry. Give me that radio. For the last time,|give me that radio! Don't just sit there sulking.|Help me, fussy. And don't grunt. Your mother|knows what's best. Why do you always take her side? There's only one side here. But you're very touchy, Chava. You hear something you|don't like and you run away. So I can be with you. But when you're on your bus... ...you don't see how bad it is. And it's getting worse. And you still don't know|how to take care of yourself. So you have to obey. - Can I ask you something?|- Of course. - Do you pray?|- What do you mean, do I pray? Do you pray for the war to end? Not for that. This damn war will|never end with a prayer. Never? Who would like to read their poem? - Okay, Yanira?|- May I go to the bathroom? Go out quietly|and don't take long. Let's hear yours, Chele. None of the kids in my|school want to fight. They don't like war because|they want to play... Don't be sad about your radio, Toad|Cristina Mara But when the soldiers come,|me and my friends will hide. What's wrong, Yanira? Chava! Chava, get down! Don't shoot! There are kids in the school! No, son! Chava! You're crazy! Go back! Chava! Mommy! You asshole.|You let them in the bell tower. You son of a bitch. That sniper killed three of my soldiers. Brothers... ...there will be no mass today. But I want to speak|to you here... ...on the street. I want to speak to everyone. The word of Our Father|must also be heard... ...by those who have not yet|found grace within themselves. What is grace, brothers? Grace is the presence|of the Divine... ...in every one of our actions. Look around you. The faces of our children|have lost their innocent spirit. In its place,|there is fear. Because our children have|lost the hope to survive. The skeptics say, if God|existed, there would be no war. And I respond... ...if men would obey the word of|God, then there would be no war! Because God, Our Father... ...has given man the privilege|to live in grace... ...or, on the contrary,|to provoke disgrace. I assure you, brothers,|when one lives in the grace of God... ...war does not exist. Nevertheless... ...there are those who|ignore their own divine nature... ...and they satisfy|themselves by robbing... ...humiliating and killing|their own kind! Brothers... ...it is the time to raise|our voices against them. To defend our right to live! To use our strength|to oppose the force of death. Today, brothers,|it is not enough to pray. They closed the school for good. Ancha, hurry,|walk faster! Because our village was|between the guerrilla and the army... ...mom decided to move us|to the other side of the river. Because she said it was safer. Grandma Mama Toya! Boys! No, Ancha. The table! I like my new house. Why did you change the station? Put on Radio Venceremos. Fito! Shhh. What's up, shorty? - When are you coming back to work?|- When I grow up! Then you're never coming back! Where are you going?! You're on! Let's go! You're going to run|out of gas, shorty! What's wrong little boy,|what's wrong... Shut up, boys! ...they ask me at school and at home. Now I know all of the sudden... ...when I heard roll call|and she was not there. The girl with the blue backpack... ...and sleepy eyes... Got me very excited|and low grades. Super bomb! Super bomb! - Antonio!|- What's up? - Where have you been?|- What are you doing here? Just hanging around. Look at me, like a monk. Every day, more a hunk. - Yeah, right.|- Who do you think you are? Come on, let's play. Do you know how to skip stones? When we arrived at the army base|we we're more than 40... ...the majority 13|and 14 years old. I was one of the youngest,|but I learned fast... ...because our teacher was a Gringo|who had been in Vietnam. He showed us how to shoot|and ambush. Last week we ambushed some|guerrilla motherfuckers... ...and I was the one who|caught them with this. You guys are next. They're recruiting everybody. Big ones... ...and little ones. So... are you still a|bunch of chicken shits? - I'm not a chicken shit!|- Me neither. Fucking chicken shits. Don't call us that. You'll be pissing your pants|when they come to recruit you... ...like the chicken|shits that you are. Chicken shits! Chicken shits! Chavitita! Don't be scared.|It's me, Raton. I heard shots last night. Was it you guys? - We cleaned out the area.|- And uncle Beto? He sent a message. The army is recruiting tomorrow.|Warn your friends. Hide. Okay, drivers, you know what to do.|One under each door. Let's go! Recruitment tomorrow Where are the boys, lady? I haven't seen them since this morning! Where are they, lady? - Sergeant, there are no boys!|- Keep searching! ...9... ...10... ...11... ...12. Did we count right?|Chava is 11. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you, dear Chava! Chava! Wait, Chava! Chava! Chava! You run fast. Here. Open it. It's batteries for your radio. Toad. Thanks. Recruitment tomorrow We've got a snitch. Chava! Chava! What happened? Chava! Chava! Father! Father! They're going to kill Raton!|Help him! They took him to the river! - Where's the priest?|- The soldiers took him yesterday. Don Yeyo. Chava!|Did you know fat Marcos left? - Where?|- To join the guerrilla. - When?|- I don't know. - Chava!|- What? Maybe we should go too? - To join the guerrilla?|- Well, what else? Let's count them. Look at that one! There's another one! We would stay there all night. One time we counted|up to 230.000 stars. I wanted to tell Cristina Mara. First I thought|I was on the wrong street. That it wasn't her house. Hey, kid!|Where are you going? Let me go! Let me go!|Let me go! Chava! Chava! I have reasons|to look for you, I have the need to see you,|to hear you, to talk to you. I have reasons|to wait for you, Because I don't believe there is anyone|in the world I can love. I have reasons,|more than enough reasons, To ask the wind to return|you even as a shadow. I have reasons|to not want to forget you, Because that little piece of happiness,|it was you who gave it to me. - Chava, let's go.|- We know where to go. Marco's mom said we have to get|to the Carita hill. Turn off the light!|Shut up! - Who else is with you?|- No one. Shut up!|Follow me. Sleep here. Tomorrow we'll|see what to do with you. Chele, Chava! Silence! No names here.|Lie down! - Do you have anything to eat?|- Cookies. Shut up! Lie down and go to sleep! - Want one?|- Yes. Hands on your heads! Wake up!|Wake up! What's wrong? We've to go. The soldiers are coming.|They're burning everything down. Grab their clothes!|Get dressed. Hurry! - Where are we going?|- I don't know. For now, into town|with everyone else. Let's go! Baby, wake up. - Where's your brother?|- I don't know. - Where are we going, grandma?|- We have to leave. - Chava!|- We have to hurry. - Because of the bullets?|- Yes, because of the bullets. Chava! Chava! The Birth Certificates,|where are they? Put your and your|brother's clothes here. His clothes are gone. And his good shoes. Where's my brother, mommy? Let's go. I'm so thirsty... ...and my feet hurt. I have rocks in my shoes. Take the sewing machine. I'm going to look for him! Soldier go home! Your house is being burned|by a soldier like you. Murderers! Murderers! Chava! Chava! Mommy? Let's go away from here. His documents are here. I didn't want you to sell|your sewing machine. Don't worry about us. Promise me you'll be strong. - Promise|- I promise. - Bye, farty sister.|- See you. Be careful. Bye, brother! I'll miss you! Take care of yourself! Now I'll be the man|of the house. I don't want to go|to the United States. But if I stay,|they're going to kill me. But I'm coming back... ...because I promised mom,|I would get Ricardito out before he turns 12. This story could have been told|by Fito or Chele or Cristina Mara. But it was left up to me. It's for them. Chava escaped to the United States|where, with the help of many|he reunited with his family 6 years later. The civil war lasted with more than|75,000 deaths, and around one million exiles. The United States government|sent troops to train... ...the Salvadorean army and|over one billion dollars in military support. Today more than 300,000|children are recruited in armies... ...around the world,|in more than 40 countries.
