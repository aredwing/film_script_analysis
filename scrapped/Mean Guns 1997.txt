 

                        1 Here I sit alone and wait... Surrounded by broken tablets and new tablets half-covered with writing. When will my hour come? The hour of my going down and going under, for I want to go among men once more. For I am waiting now... For I am waiting now... For first of the signs that my hour has come. Meanwhile, I talk to myself this one last time. Nobody tells me anything new. So I tell myself... Myself... You want to see me? Yeah. Commissioner gil... You play chess? What's going on? We got the dedication ceremony in the morning at 10:00 sharp. I think you'd better leave. Relax. We got just enough time for a game. Perez prado... The original mambo king. What? The music. I'm not sure I understand your strategy, Mr. moon. Redemption. Redemption... Separates the wheat from the shaft. Checkmate. And I do understand redemption. Outward-bound passage leaves in 5 minutes. Outward-bound passage leaves in 5 minutes. Outward-bound passage leaves in one minute. Last call. Outward-bound passage leaves in one minute. Last call. Next passage of track 666 in 15 minutes. Next passage of track 666 in 15 minutes. Good to see you, cam. When I say I don't want feds, I mean it. Got the photos? Walk with me, cam. Where are you taking me? Commissioner giltner's turning state's evidence. Moon's in trouble with us and the syndicate. He's desperate, cam. He's trying to clean out the problems. Clean out? Everybody who even looks like a problem, clean. Lord knows it's his only chance. I need those photos in case moon gets to giltner. You want out, cam? Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Now, that's more evidence than any D.A. Could ask for. Don't ask me to testify. I'm leaving tonight without the escort. Negatives? Stashed. Hey...Look... I gave you what you wanted. You don't need me! Just let go! Oh, shit! Shut up. Rat. I want 15 grand for those negatives. Getting cam wasn't gonna be... Getting you... Is what Mr. moon wants, Jerry. Aah! And thank you. We've already got the negative. Ricky. No! Purgatory systems is checking your clearance. Stand by. What is this place? It's one of the syndicate's construction projects, a new correctional facility. It's a prison, Ricky. Now, how in the world would the syndicate get to build a prison? Payoff, stupid. It's opening tomorrow, ribbon-cutting and everything. Moon has got a twisted sense of humor. Why does he want us up here? This is spooky. Because he's here. Looks like the workers cleaned out fast. What's this damned thing all about, fellas? Hey, don't do that. I hate that. Do what? Swear when you don't have to. What the hell are you talking about, boy? Ha ha! I'll say "hell" whenever I wanna say "hell," asshole. You shut up! Man's trying to make a damn cultural point, right? Enough! What are you, my God-almighty father, all of a sudden? Are we there yet? Ok, my space... Your space. Look at that, Marcus. Strange, isn't it? Us here and now. Uh-huh. Why are we all together on this? We? We're together because we were told to be. Yeah, yeah. And moments later, we'll be picked up by a damned limo at the corner of fifth and Broadway. So why don't you crawl up his ass for saying that, Ricky? For saying what? "Damned limo." Jesus. Are we back on this? Direct quote. Doesn't count. Is "damn" even a swear word? Who cares, for Christ's sake? Hey look d, I got a healthy respect for profanity, ok? It's just that they're not happy words, and it don't make me happy to hear them. Use something over and over and over again, you know, it ceases to have any meaning. Hell, hell, hell, hell. You know what I mean? So what do you care if I use it if it doesn't mean anything? Look, all I'm saying is, maybe you use them a little less, they mean a little more. Especially in the movies. Well, that's why I use them, Ricky, because they don't mean a damn thing. Purgatory requests all weapons be checked in with cerebus at the portal gateway. Just take the girl. The other one's dead. Hey, Ricky, I'm not gonna carry that bitch. I'll get her. Oh! Uhh! What the hell is this? None of our business, darlin'. How about the other one? Well, he's not Lazarus, and Jesus ain't showin' up today, so lock it and leave it, Bob. You are now in the purgatory security network. Audio and visual surveillance is constant by Lucifer command. Purgatory requests all weapons be checked in with cerebus at the portal gateway. Let's see your weapons, boys. What's up? What is this? Mr. moon doesn't want any heat at the meeting. Bang. You're dead. Well? It's green eggs and ham. Let's see your weapons. You are now in the purgatory security network. Audio and visual surveillance is constant by Lucifer command. Oh. What the fuck is this? Take it easy. Never seen you before, man. From out of town. Who are you, Dr. fuckin' Seuss? Funny. Ooh. Check everywhere, sugar. You never know what I'm hiding. Come on. Come on. That's gotta be you. Get goin'. Long time, d. Double "d." Buttface... Dickhead. I'm dickhead. I'm buttface. Don't forget. Anytime. Anyplace. She wants us. Lucifer command is recording audio and visual surveillance of your visit. I'm taking care of it. I'll turn the prison back over to the city tonight. It'll be ready. Hey, moon... Nothing else will go wrong. What the fuck is this? I know the deal. What is this? I don't get it. Marcus, what's up, stud? How's the world? Spinning right along. Jesus, I told you bring her, not rip her head off. She's got a lot of balls for an accountant. Yes, she does. Your boys are kind of fresh, boss. I'll make sure to tell 'em. Come here, slut. Aw, sweet pea, I didn't expect you to be here. This is like a members only thing. Big Bob said it would be ok. Did he? Hey! Best laid plans of moon and men. I'm sorry, boss. Marcus, you keep your head about you, ok, man? The original mambo king. Huh? Makes you want to dance. Asshole. You have all betrayed the syndicate. Maybe in little ways over a long period of time. Maybe once. Maybe one big time. Maybe something in-between. You blabbed, you stole, you plotted, you saw too much, maybe you did too little. Now, your individual sins are written right on the cards right in front of you. But I'm sure you know, and we all know, what happens to those that betray the syndicate. Our first intention was just to murder you motherfuckers. Throw your punk asses in a big-ass hole, cover it up with lime. That'd be the easiest way. But that ain't the most interesting, nah. So I convinced them, why don't you let me give out prizes to the winners? Let the syndicate watch? This shit's gonna be better than pay-TV. So look at all you tough motherfuckers... Who is the best killer in here? I don't know. Oh, shit. Best backstabber... Step up, claim your prize. Gold, bronze, silver... To the losers... Who gives a fuck? We are gonna find out who the coldest 3 motherfuckers in this building are. Better believe that shit. What's the prize? Obviously, loyalty means nothing to anybody in this room. The prize is $10 million cash. Split 3 ways. That comes up to $3.3 million dollars each for the coldest motherfuckers in this building. But every good game has to have good, tough losers, too. So, who are the losers? So, what's the rules? Just like life... Survival of the fittest. To win, you eliminate the competition. All competition! Except 3. This whole prison has been vacated and cordoned off. That's the ballpark. Elevators and gates are cut off and locked. Everything else is open. Deep inside the ballpark is a briefcase filled to the top with cash. That's the prize. Now, once everybody gets spread out, why don't you killers give a guy a call? Let me know what's going on, who got took out. That way I'll know when my game's over. The number's on the back of your card right in front of you. There's phones all over this joint. If any one of you gets a bright idea and tries to leave this ballpark, you'll be disqualified permanently. It's the deadliest game. The true test of your skills, whether real or imagined. No more bragging, you fucking rats. Motherfuckers got to show and prove now. Let the deadliest survive. Questions? What the hell you talking about, man? Questions? Yeah. Is there a predetermined length for this game? Good question. After 6 hours, you all die. After all, they dedicating this place tomorrow. Question? Yeah. What if we don't want to play? Then don't! Any other questions? Yes. Where can I get this cd? You like prado? Yes. Makes you want to dance. Are there any other questions? Good. All of you are more or less professionals in here, so I expect you to act with some form of dignity. We're not civilians, so I know you understand the world. Life is not fuckin' perfect. What's going on? Shut up! I'll see you later. Get out of me it's going! It's going! It's gone! Get her! Go! Go! Come on, punk. Let's see if I'm really as bad as I say I am. D... Well, that's just too damn bad, Ricky. No! No! No! No! Aah! Bobby? Bobby?! Bobby?! Whoo! I'm enjoying this! Come on, man. Hey, there goes the bitch. Hey, man! Hey, man! Come on, curly. That the best you can do? Oh, fell down! Let me get the rules straight. We kill everybody else before they kill us, and we get $10 million dollars? That's it 10 millions 10 millions simple enough. Yep. But it's only... The last 3 alive who get the money. Last three, what if it's only 2? He wasn't that specific. He wasn't that specific? Yeah, he wasn't that specific, he didn't say. He didn't say. No. Hey, Joey, you up there? What? Joey? Joey! Aah! I don't think this is so damn funny. Oslo. You think you scare me? I would have thrown that knife by now. Even when you were good, you were shit. Yeah, but I would have thrown that knife already. I mean, why take the chance? First, I want an answer. No answers. Nothing. Zero. Nada. No way outta here. No way you can get off the hook. Then you're no use to me. I told you. Don't hold the knife. Throw the fucking knife. Like the old days. Like the old days. You be good. You be bad. He be uglified. Get her! Damn! Don't shoot! Put the gun down. She's with me d. Marcus... There's room for all of us. Come on, lady, if you wanna live. Ok, room for 3. But you better know how to take care of business when the time comes, number-cruncher. This ain't the junior league. I know how to cover my ass. You better learn how to cover mine. You stinking bitch. How do we know we can trust her? 'Cause I say so. I got shot. But you got out. We're not out yet, and there's a lot of problems in here with us. Why'd they all just go along with it? Because when you drop a pile of guns and bats into a room of killers and tell them to go, they're gonna go. I'm not part of this. Look, lady, reality is a cold, hard thing when it comes up and bites you in the ass. You're telling me. So what's the plan, big man? Check the perimeter and see how secure it is. You'll need this. No! No! Please! No! No! Don't! No! Wait! Where's your father, little bitch? Lou! Now we're having fun, sweetie. You ok? Get down, Lucy. We're really having fun now. Oh, man. Take somebody out. That's right. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. I got one. I got one. It's Lenny. Whose idea was this anyway? What does yours say? It's not your concern. What about you, sweetie? Been skimming the cream off the top? Let's see. What's that... A camera? What the hell were you doing, taking pictures of big man's wife? Don't get comfortable. He's getting ready to run, isn't he? Maybe I could get over there, and I could throw my jacket over the fence. Snipers. So running is out. He can't. He is Vincent moon. He can do what he likes. Hello, Marcus. We all do as we like. I truly hate this man. I know what you're thinking. And you're right. 4 is too many. Should I make it 3? Three, three, three? No. 4 is good, Lou. Would you like to hear what it sounds like to have a bullet rattle around inside that thick skull of yours, d? Room for 3 at the end of the game, Lou. You heard the rules. Rattle, rattle. 4's good, Lou. 4 is good. I'll put you down. You put her down, and we're down to 2. I'll give you 5 to put down the gun, or I'll spray you all over her. One. Countdown to destiny. You know I would. I like you, d. Don't get me wrong. I just knew this would be the best way to get my point across. You know, me... Everything's fine. 4 is good. Please, Marcus. Marcus. I want you to know if I miss, I'm sorry. 4 is good. 4 is good. Just like my good friend d is saying here. Because there can only be 3 in the crow's nest. But 4's got a better chance than 3, Marc-o. But 4 is too many. That's not a problem, because at least one of us is sure to buy it along the way. So we start with 4... One as ballast through the game and if we're the only 4 left at the end, then... We'll burn that bridge when we come to it. But 4 is better than 3. And much, much better than 2. Sorry. We're agreed then. Logic prevails. Come on. We're settled, partner. Put it up. Bang! You're a crazy man. I knew you'd hold up, d. You always do. Don't push me, Lou. Don't push me. You always back up. Why not push? I'm killing everybody. I'm killing moon. I'm killing moon's mama. I'm killing any little moons. I don't care who... No warning next time, eh? Right. Let's go call in, huh? Forgot about that. Moon... The asshole. Yeah, the boss gave us those cards... Want me to call in? To keep track. Keep track, who killed who. Good to see you again, big man. You know him? Yeah. Political job back in '92. He knows me. Who's the squeak? She's with me. Ohh. Isn't it romantic? Ding! I don't see where you fit in here, Lou. You're not one of moon's regulars. Well, I was in town on another... Rather more personal matter. Heard about this little party beforehand, asked moon if I could pull up and play along with all you fine, fine people. You wanted to be here? I was absolutely dying to be here, d. Stop. Stop! What are we gonna do? I don't feel like dodging sniper fire and spending the next 10 years looking over my shoulder. D's right. 4's better than 3. We'll play the game... And finish it. Minus one of us. Right now let's eliminate the enemy. What I figure is, everybody's going after the milk. I would. 10 million of moon's money. Whoever's got the cash has got the position. Which is exactly what everyone else is planning. What they forget is that it doesn't matter who's got the money first. What matters is who's got the money last. Marcus: Let's get on with shaving the odds. This is good for you. I can tell. Builds your character. Hey! Age before beauty. Joy. You're happy to see me. I can tell. You and I... We speak the same language. No. No, we do not. What's yours say? Picture of a moneybag with wings. Mine, too. They caught us red-handed. Red-handed. How do you think he found out? He found out. It doesn't matter now. No, not one iota. Good word, "iota." Call in? And see who's dead? Yeah. Add ours to the tally. 6, maybe 6. I don't know. I got 2 in the warehouse. I got one. Polite guy. Bad hair guy. Staircase guy. This guy. Is that all? Yup. No, no. Yeah. There was 3 in the warehouse. Blackie, bad hair guy, big guy, uh, staircase guy, this guy, and, uh... The screamer. Screamer. Bingo, 9. Beautiful. Rat trap. I am not an animal. I am not an animal. So, we call in. Moon will have a fit. Shit fit when he finds out how many we tagged. Let's find a phone. Let's go. Ok. Are we gonna call in and listen to the messages? It would be nice to know who's still out there. What's the difference? We have to kill them all! Can we do that? Sure, we can. Better to keep off the line for now. Oh, the element of surprise. Shut up, Lou. What is that? Valium, Prozac, and ritalin. Breakfast of champions. So, how'd you get in the business? It's the only thing I ever wanted to do. And what I didn't know, your government taught me. That was very nasty. Honey, don't even try it. What do we do now, boys? Hi there. You idiot. She's quick. Thanks, blondie. Help me. Help me. Would you shut him up? No. Save your bullets. Use that. Beat him to death? Get away from me, bitch! Get away! Get out of here! Go away! He's a mad dog who needs to be put down. Prozac, ritalin, valium. The man is a toilet. Get away from me bitch! No, no, no, no, no. I thought I told you to shut him up. I can't. I just can't. No, no, no! I can't. I can't! Please stop. How about I shut you up? I can't. Did he get her? Just shut up. Oh, shit! Shut up. Shut up! Shut up. On the count of 3, one of you is gonna be dead. 1... 2... Marcus! I can't! I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. Just too much fun. You do know how to use this, right? Little trigger under the heavy part. We can do this. What's wrong with you? It's them or us. Ok, that's enough. No, not ok. I need to know that this babe can do it. You were thinking, "let's get somebody else "to take care of the problem. I'll be over here knitting." You're an old woman, my friend. I don't know whether to screw you or kill you. You've made your point. She's got to pull her weight. I'm not like you guys. I didn't ask for this. Pull the weight or lighten the load. Like this? How about I just lighten you? Like this. What are you, her mother? God. Gonna take a lifetime to win this. Yeah. I'm depressed now. Got an idea how we can speed things up. We just have to find a way out of here. You can't. It's a goddamn prison. Hey, she's got you there, d. Well, let's say once upon a time there were 3 bears. God, not another story. Yeah Marcus, just spit it out. The bears went out one day looking for food, which was other bears. Ah, cannibalistic bears. And when these 3 bears got back to their house, they found little goldilocks sleeping in their bed. Just before they could eat her, papa bear said, "no, just wait. We're cannibalistic bears." Yes, yes, we are. I want to be mama bear. 3 bears. "Ahh," thought the bears. "Goldilocks is tasty to us, "so goldilocks is tasty to other bears. "And what we really like to eat is other bears, "so why don't we use goldilocks as a trap for the other bears?" And all the bears nodded their heads, and they said that it was good, so they did. And goldilocks was a very good trap for the other bears. And the 3 bears went back to their nice homes that night simply stuffed to the gills with bear. Yum yum. The end. So who do we use for bait? Not goldilocks. Not who, but what. Precisely. I'm lost. Of course you are. You're stupid. You're pushing the limit, Lou. All right, we tell everyone we found the money and invite all the bears to try and take it from us. So how do we set up the trap? There's got to be a p.A. System around this joint somewhere. All we've got to do is find a guard station. Provided we can find a good spot to do it and not get whacked ourselves. Already spotted a place. Marcus... Why is everybody saying you're stupid? Now... You do know how to use that, right? I mean, squeeze your finger and all? We've already been through this, Lou. Not to my satisfaction. So she's goldilocks? And you are an idiot. So what? I've had just about enough of you, Lou. Don't even joke about it, d. Anytime,amiga, anytime. You're a player in this. No choice. The sooner we get it over with, the sooner we can go back to our lives or go back to killing each other. Right now we've got a lot of problems to take care of. You'll stick with this bunch, or I'll end it now. All but one of us gets out, isn't it right. That's moon's rules. And rules are made to be broken. At least some are. Let's go. Ho, man. Getting hungry. For competition. Yeah. What should we do? Meat loaf. Kitchen. Food. What have you guys got up your sleeves? Oh, that's twisted. Twisted, but fun. Ah, yes. Mmm, popsicle. Whoa, hello, Betty. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! They're dead! They're dead! You saved my life! Thank you! Thank you! They were hunting me! You saved my life. You... You don't understand. Whoa! Let me get out of the way! If you had the chance, you would have killed us dead as dickens. I don't belong here! I don't belong here! I was with a friend! Yeah with a friend huh? She's cute. Can we keep her? Neither one of us can afford to go soft for a nice pair of tits. Not today. I won't be any trouble. I won't, you guys. I can help. I'll be a decoy. I'll do anything you want. She's your pet. You feed it, you clean it, you kill it. Hey, I really appreciate this I really do. A hundred percent. You can count on me. Can I have a gun? Get this straight, nipples. This ain't the girl scouts or Melrose place. Cute doesn't cut it all the way to the tree line. You do what we say when we say it and maybe make it out of here alive. Get in our way or cross us, we'll put you down. You're built like there's no tomorrow, but I'll put you down just the same. If you think for one minute we trust you, you better think a little harder. This is no time for slutty games, get me? Yes, sir. All right, I'm sick of this. I'm calling you guys out. I'm taking all comers in 15 minutes back in the place where this all started, and I will personally put holes in all of you. Anyone who wants a face-off, bring it on. And by the way, I found the 10 million, but I don't figure moon's gonna let me leave with it unless you're all taken out. Goody. Prime time. Let's go. Everyone's gonna be there. Easiest way to clean up this mess. Should have thought of it, hoss. Hoss? Need some more bullets. A lot more. Your name's hoss? Hoss. Hoss and crow. Ever read Sam Shepard? Tooth of crime? Fantastic stuff. And who are you? Barbie. Like the doll? Like bonanza? I'm crow, this is hoss, you're Barbie. Can we go now? Nice bottom. Tight bottom. About the money... I was just wondering if they even have it, or is it just a trick? Beg pardon? Well, the money's the whole point of this thing, right? I don't think she gets it. Barbie. Barbie. Look, honey... The money doesn't matter. The 3 that walk out of here are gonna the 3 with the money. You're putting the cart before the horse. What if it's a trap? Of course it's a trap. We kill people. We're killers. We set traps for a living. Of course it's a trap. Do you think it's smart? I don't remember asking your opinion, pissflaps. Need a gun. Got one... Got 2...Got 3. Meant her. Eighty-six that idea right now. You lead. I do. You do what? I do need a gun. If somebody takes a crack at me, I'm toast. How I can help you? How can you hurt us? Bro, huh? I think I've been clear. I do need a gun. They're gonna blow my brains out. Then keep your head down until you grow one. Let's move. Come on. What if they don't come? They know it's a trap then we'll just have to kill each other. This is warped. Warped? Watch mtv. That's warped, man. What's the world coming to? How many flies and maggots can you work into the shot here? You got lesbian leather dykes on one hand, piss and b.M. In somebody's mouth on the other. It's oglethorpe's playground to a madness. And you'd know all about that. What was that, d? Forget it. I didn't catch your remark, d. You said it. Must want somebody to hear it. I said... Nothing. Like always...Hot air. All talk, no walk. You're gonna buy it today, Lou. I just got a feeling about it. We're all gonna buy it today, d. Haven't you figured it out yet? Shut up. Everyone, chill out. This rabbi and this priest, they walk into a bar... A rabbi? Hey, d, rattle, rattle. I swear to Christ, Lou, if you don't shut up... Waah-freaking-waah. Boo-freaking-hoo. Dammit. I didn't mean to you. I think I'm going to have to kill you, d. Don't threaten me, Lou. You're not the stud you used to be. In fact, people say you're through. You just don't know it yet. You remember the first one, d? I mean, the first real one. I do. It felt like freedom. Knowing what you can do to the world. The next time... You didn't feel a thing. No guilt, pain, remorse, fear. We can change the world with what we do. There is nothing to be afraid of, is there the devil won't come. There is nothing to stop you. Till you lose it. Exactly. Until you lose it. And when that happens, d... You feel everything. Remember me? Your stepfather and mother discussed it with me. Get out of here! We've decided this is a bad place for you. You don't like it here, do you, Lucy? Good. You can't come in! What the hell do you think you're doing? You never gave a shit before! I do now, Stan. Listen, Lucy, I get off hurting bad people. You don't have a problem with that, do you? After this, neither of us will have to worry, ok? Where the hell are you going? I gotta piss, Lou. Sit down. Lou, let her go. What do you want me to do, Lou? Go right here? I said, sit down. No one's going nowhere until this is over. Piss in your mouth for all I care. So, what time is it? Piss off! This is wrong, man. This is just wrong. I can't be here for this. This is wrong. Wrong time, wrong place. D... Wrong life. Wrong life. I gotta get out of here. I'm not waiting here to die. Load! Load! Load! The fourth person. Load! Barbie, you bitch. Bob! I'm out! Bob! Shut up, bitch! Bobby, no! One hour left, then all the cows come home. Forget it. I'm taking my own chances now. Bitch. Just kill me, you goddamn freak. Crow. Hoss. We're the only ones left. We're the only ones left, moon, goddamn it! There's more, asshole, and you got one hour left before I clean up all of you. Cam! Ollie, Ollie, oxen free! You goddamn snitch. All right, we're closing in on the winners. What do you say I speed up the action in this ballpark? The money's in the third floor locker room. That's 15 minutes, tops. Go get it. Hey, moon, how do you like it? Where's Lou? Is Lou your daddy now? And is he a good daddy? We're partners, right? You and me. We've got to get out of this joint. There's a lot of nasty guys out there, so we'll be very, very quiet, yeah? Take my hand. Ugly. Yucky fuckin' yuck. Probably some novice to get that messed up. Some high-school punk who thinks he's tough. Happens all the time. Yeah, maybe in your world. Are we there yet? We're on the third. Split up? No. You've got 2, and you've got 3. I've got none. You guys, you're not gonna leave me out on my own to die. Fine. So we stick. Fine. Fine. Give me a gun! Give me a gun! You tried to kill me, you son of a bitch! You just wanted the money like everyone else. You thought he was special? Drop the gun, Barb. Hold still a sec. She can keep it. My gun. No. Yes. You want to reconsider that thought? Just don't shoot me. We're not done yet, crow. Think she'll shoot you? Just cap her and call it over. I can't. Because I'm between her and the bullet. All damn day. I like her. She doesn't get the gun. She doesn't get the gun, she's dead. Doing fine so far. So far? So far. Shoot her. Shoot her right now. Damn it, hoss. Don't make this harder than it has to be. Look, you gave us this third leg, and now I've gotta deal with your emotional life? I've been playing buddy because I'm supposed to play buddy, and so are you, and I'm sick of playing baby-sitter. You shoot her, and you shoot me. You hear me, crow she gets the gun, she kills both of us. Can't you see that? Look, you're not thinking straight. I don't want to have to shoot you, crow. How do we settle this? Gunfight at o.K. Corral. Don't play. Jesus. You draw first, she dies. I draw first, she gets the gun. Don't. Ok, partner, you there behind the wall, you yellow-bellied sapsucker, let the little lady have what she wants. No. Ok, crow. I call draw. You slap leather. Stop it. Ready, partner? You're gonna shoot me dead as dickens, aren't you? Dead as dickens. And bingo was his name, oh! I'm rich. I want you to stay here and guard these cases, partner. Ok? Ok. How you doing? Good. Well, tooth fairy won't be far away now. Come on, let's go. I'm not part of this. I don't belong here. I didn't do anything. I'm... I'm going. I'm... I'm getting out. She didn't shoot at us. That's a lot of silver. They're platinum. Like 'em? You having a good time, little girl? Yeah. Me, too. Only gonna get better. You can't get them all. But what if I'm really, really good? You'll see. It's not gonna be that easy. Well, then what do you want? What happened to those pictures? They're in my pocket. Do you want to see? Better than I expected. You want to see the best of show? Councilman graves. That would have done it. Would have. All this work just to get out. Just out is plenty. I didn't know I was laundering blood money. I didn't know who I was working for. Not until you told me. Just out. That's all I wanted. Yeah, just out. Now... Is that the money? You didn't take these. No. Who did? They were sent to me. Somebody with a big grudge. Who took this one? Who knew you'd be there? Bob. Bob. I just killed his wife. It was a contract. Barbie? How did Bob find out about that? He didn't. You got these pictures because Bob wanted to expose Vincent moon. So, then what does moon have against you? Let me ask you a question. There's a man who's killed 26 people, some innocent, some not. 26? Yeah, 26, not including today. And if when you ask why he did what he did, he's got reasons he can tell you, would that make it all right? No. No. I didn't think so. Don't make any calls. I'll call you when it's over. Just... Stay out of sight. I never asked you why. Why you helped me. Doesn't matter anymore. All right, Louie, there's only 3 left. Come see me in the meeting room. Gather for the grand finale. Lucy. Lucy. How was your day? I'm cold, Lou. I'll be just a little longer. Then we'll go to a hotel. Then we'll get you a nice, hot bath, ok? Ok. You can call me daddy. Daddy. I'm doing good for us. Ok. Kill that creep, will ya, Marcus? Marcus. That's it. Game's over. We win. They're all dead? What about d? Just you, me, and Lou. Can you come to where we first all met? Yeah. Yeah, all right. Focus. You can do this. And baby makes 3. Purgatory preset time lock is released. Personnel transfer... Si, si. I am an asshole, but everybody in here understands how these things work, or else you wouldn't have made it this far. So where do we go from here? Well, I'll tell you where we go from here. We know. Damn it, Vincent. I'm so excited about this. You and Marcus... 2 of the best. What a challenge. You haven't lost your skill since you went into management, have you? No. I've been practicing. We don't want 3 left. We want one. The last little Indian that could. It's so bent and twisted. I know exactly where you're coming from, Vincent. This is beautiful. I am so glad that we all agree. We're all gonna kill each other? Why? I thought we won. But we won! Very classy, Vincent. Final stage. This is the good part. Uno. Dos. And to the lady. Redemption time, people. Time for some good old-fashioned redemption. Winner takes all. I don't belong here. You're the first one down, lady. Let's do this. 3... 2... Oh, Lou... Did I forget to put bullets in your gun? Rat-fucking ass. It's not fair, Vincent. You know, Lou, nobody can ever blame you for wanting to kill somebody that raped your daughter, but, man, you always been a little bit too bloody, way too bloody. To tell you the truth, you scare us. That's what I do... Scare bad people. Syndicate feels you're an issue now. You know, you've developed this problem, you know? Parental responsibilities, stuff like that. None of your goddamned business. It's all our business. So you knew. When you passed out the guns, I knew. Lou was too dangerous. Definitely needed the edge. All gone. There's still you and me. Yeah, you and me, amigo. Just one of us walks away. Is that it? Or is it none? I get it. Yeah. Syndicate wanted us all to disappear, didn't they? 'Fraid so, Marcus. You know, maybe they don't kill us all today, but sooner or later... So I say, hey... Why wait? Let's just go out in a blast right fuckin' now. Come on, Marcus. Let's get down. Your call. Fuckin' Marcus I used to be way quicker than that. I'm getting slow. Practice. I gotta practice. Yeah, I gotta practice more. It's a bit late, old fella. Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive. You still... You still don't mean shit, Vincent. What a pathetic way to go out... For a couple of studs like us. Gimme your gun. I'll do you in. Suicide is a sin, you know? Oh, don't worry about me. I can't go yet. I've got my little girl to look after. She's been taken care of, Lou. You didn't. She was my daughter. She was my real daughter, Marcus. Tell me you didn't kill her, even if it's a goddamned lie. I didn't know she was your kid. I was making good for us. And you killed her. Make good now, Lou. Make good now. Gladly, Marcus. The man said to come in when all the shooting was done. He said he wasn't really going to kill you, just make you look dead. He said he was going to shoot you here, not here or here. What? What man? Are you all right? I will be. I will be. Said this was for you, too. Lady... Are you my new mommy? I suppose I am, sweetie. Buckle up. Do you like that? I love mambo, don't you?
