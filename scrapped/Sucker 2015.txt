And those of you who don't are lying. Who wants to play? Who wants to play? You can't win if you're not in. MAN (narrating): This one's a classic... one of the oldest street swindles in the world... the three-card monte. Find the lady. Toss the broad. The lady in red will get you ahead. The jokers black will set you back. MAN (narrating): See if you can do it. Keep your eye on the queen. (laughing) Ten-to-one. "Ten-to-one," the man says. Those are the odds and not the time, unless it's time to play! MAN (narrating): Let me introduce the Professor. The beauty of the three-card monte is that even though people know it's a scam, they still play. Everybody wants to beat the man. In fact, no sucker will ever win the three-card monte. CROWD: Ooh! - (cheering) - Unless he's in on the game. Yep, that's me. And I'm no sucker. - Three-card monte's the name of the game. - (cheering) A few years ago, I learnt to tell lies for profit and pleasure. You would probably call me a con man, a swindler. I prefer the term "professional liar." So let me tell you the truth. Come on, trust me. MAN: And start. MAN (narrating): You recognize this scene, right? Final maths exam. Chinese kid. Nervous, but he's totally gonna ace it. Well, you'd be right if you were talking about him. But we're talking about me, the good-looking one. Aaah! It's all fun and games, Master Lawrence, until someone loses an eye. Can my son still sit the exam? Lawrence has brought great shame to the school. There's also the injury to young Jeremy Fong to consider. But no exam means no university. I'm afraid Lawrence must suffer the maximum penalty. Lawrence? There are no short cuts. Cheating will never get you anywhere. But, Mum, everyone's going. There'll be girls. - You're not going to Schooler Paradise. - Surfer's Paradise. You promised us you studied. - You lied to your family. - Our entire family is full of doctors. Don't we have enough? - What are you going to be then, huh? - I don't know. My sister in China has bought a ticket to come to your graduation. - What am I going to tell her? - You can tell her about Schooler's Paradise. (speaking Chinese) Fine! I'll pay you back. Every last cent. LAWRENCE (narrating): What did they expect? The average person lies six times a day. And I only cheated that one time. I guess you gotta start somewhere. (man chattering) - What the hell! - You want a phone, you need a job. You want a job, you need an education. - (bell chiming) - (woman on PA, indistinct) - Chinese lucky money? - Call as soon as you get there. With what? Try to be a good boy. (Chinese) Look at these monkeys. They think they get something for nothing. But they're just idiots for us to laugh at. You need to work hard for what you want. Life is not a game show. Lawrence, just because your father sent you here as a punishment does not mean you cannot have fun. I can put on my computer for you to play on. - Do you have a modem? - No, Lawrence. A Macintosh. (button clicks) LAWRENCE (narrating): Uncle Sam loved chess. I mean, really loved it. Chess taught him everything that was important in life... discipline, tradition, self-control. I want to die. (clocks ticking) Lawrence, Soo Jin is our club champion. Lawrence is very smart. Make a good Chinese boyfriend. (chuckles) I will leave you two kids together. I'm sure you'll have lots to talk about. - She's eight. - No, Soo Jin is 10, and I'm 52. Anyone who can beat your uncle in a game of chess must have something worthwhile to say. (loud clattering) (chuckling) That's the spirit. Excuse me, sir. If you're not here to play chess, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. My good man, I am here to play. A visitor's game is five dollars. (chuckling) Who's the president of this fine establishment? - I am. - Oh, excellent. You're a man of chess, no less. A yellow Kasparov. (chuckling) I, too, am quite the master even if I do say so myself, which I do! I've not been beaten for nine years. This is a tragedy, but I've come all the way... to the antipodes for a new challenge. Mr. President, I propose to you a wager. Defeat me in a single game, and you can ram-jam ramabam these 50 clams... into your old skyrocket. I don't play for money. Oh! (mutters) (chuckles) So who is the best player in the club? - Me! - Ah! I won the club championship three times. Oh, my. Delighted to meet you, young lady. Enough! In that case, I shall defeat you all. This is a serious club. Very well. I shall defeat at least half of you. Gentlemen... and young lady... the terms of tonight's wager. I shall play you, Chairman Mao. In fact, I shall play you all. I stake my money that A: I will defeat you, sir, B: I will defeat at least half of you, and C: I will play you all at exactly the same time! Hmm. Hmm. Well. (grunts) Checkmate. Yes! (grunting) Gentlemen, thank you for being so gracious in defeat. But ruminate on this. Next time, I might play sober. - (chuckling) - (murmuring) SOO JIN: He's brilliant. Yeah. Very clever. Why would you be following an old drunk down an alley? I'm a good judge of character, young man, and you don't look like a ruffian to me. - You forgot something. - Ah, my whiskey! Thank you. Your cold tea. A harmless little deception in order to lower the expectations of one's adversaries. You're very perceptive for a young man who doesn't play chess. Neither do you. But you just saw me play 10 games at once. I'm the grand pooh-bah. I haven't lost a match in 12 years. - Nine years. - Well, time flies when you're having fun. You didn't win 10 games. You didn't win any games at all. You played them against each other. You watched the move one player made against you... and copied it on the opposite board. Of course you would win half the games. And you beat my uncle because you played him against the club champion. Checkmate. Yes! (laughing) Lawrence, isn't it? Well, Lawrence, you've busted my gaffe. You're Joe hep. You're hep to the game. And your keen eye has earned you a pineapple here tonight. Would you mind? So you walk in, steal their money and walk away just like that? Lawrence, that hurts. I didn't break any of the Ten Commandments tonight. I didn't murder anybody. I didn't covet my neighbor's donkey, and I certainly didn't steal anything. You've just insulted an old man who gave you $50. My uncle's $50. The lure of easy money... clouds rational thought. You cannot cheat an honest man. That is the first rule of my occupation. A con man. I prefer the term "professional liar." - SAM: Lawrence! - I should go... Wait! - My money. - Easy come, easy go. That also tends to be something of a rule. I need that money. If you want to earn it back, Sunday morning at the mall. Good evening, Lawrence. Come on, mate. Good morning. Good morning, young man. It's Lawrence. What are you doing here? You said you might need a hand. What kind of hand? With whatever scam you've got going on. Do you think you might like to speak up a little? I don't think everybody quite heard you. Look about you. What do you see, hmm? Magazines. For every imaginable interest, but they're all concerned with desire. People want what they can't have. Some are more obviously concerned with desire. Persuasion is about giving people what they want. - I don't want this. - Perhaps not, Master Lawrence. But ask yourself this. (muttering) Turn around. - What do you want, hmm? - (writing) Thank you. - My wife is seven months pregnant. - Excuse me? A long-time customer of this establishment. A subscriber to many fine magazines. I'm sorry. What was her name? - And you send her this. - Oh. Dear. Perhaps we could just exchange it for the correct publication. Yes, of course. I do apologize. - No, no, no. - If there's anything I can do. Not at all. However... (chuckling) she's always complaining about the lack of a good pair of scissors. Ah. How much for your very best pair? Oh, please. It would be my pleasure, sir. Oh, that is too kind. Thank you. Good day. Confidence is about trust. - Can I borrow $50? - You already have my 50. Hmm, I suppose you might see it that way. Do you really think you've got what it takes, hmm? Sure. Convince her to take the money. - My $50? - Yep. But you have to keep the wallet. Oh, sorry. Is that your wallet? Um, no. Is it yours? - No, it's a man's wallet. - Yes, um... - Anyway, do you want the money? - What? No. I mean, I just thought I'd keep the wallet, and you could have the... Here. See if there's any ID in it. - Look, a family man. - Oh, and $50. - Don't you want it? - No. Isn't there, like, a card or something? No. Wait. All right. - (change drops) - (line rings) Hello. Is this... Yes, speaking. Oh, really? Oh, thank goodness. What is your name? Sarah. Oh, that's lovely. (chuckles) Yes, I have a daughter called Sarah. Listen, anyway, we've got your wallet, so... Look, I'd like to give you a reward. Those photos mean so much to me. How does $200 sound? - That's not necessary. - No, not at all. It's for your honesty. It's such a rare quality. - Hey! Give me the wallet. - No, I found it. - Look, I want the wallet. - Keep the 50. I'm keeping the wallet. - It's a man's wallet. - I want it for my dad. You take the money. The wallet's worth more than $50. Yes. So? Take the money? No, you idiot. What are you doing? - Please take the money? - Oh, my God. (picks up receiver) He's an idiot. He wants to talk to you. Hello? You're supposed to say, "How 'bout I sell you the wallet? How much are you willing to pay?" This is the guy that busted your chess swindle? This is Lawrence. He's no Laurence Olivier. But he is damn cute. LAWRENCE (narrating): Yeah. She didn't say that. (voices rewinding) - This is the guy that busted your chess swindle? - This is Lawrence. I told you that scam was rubbish. It's old, and so are you. Lawrence, meet Sarah. Come on, Dad. We can do better. We leave tomorrow night. WOMEN: Don't, don't Don't, don't Don't, don't This ordinary thing Can be more colorful than you say it is The cardinal sin Is to tell a lie, but now you must give in The storm came down on you Just like it was the end I've never heard of such a thing. It's like a bus with medical students. We drive around to help out country hospitals. - Medibus. - But you are not a medical student. Not yet. I need a job if I'm ever going to pay back Dad. Lots of driving. Very dangerous. At least if we have an accident, the bus is full of doctors. Hey. (speaking Cantonese) It's a joke, Uncle. Why don't you ever speak Cantonese? Thanks for everything, Uncle. Make sure to call every few days. I will. Ah! (Cantonese) (gasps) With a belly full of hot tea, all is in harmony. - Confucius? - No, Lawrence. Antioxidants. - (chattering) - (silverware clinking) I want to learn to do what you do. What do you think it is that I do? You're a con artist, aren't you? I'm a reader of people. Ordinary people. What about that man? What do you think he does? - He's a businessman. - Mm-hmm. - A stockbroker or something. - How do you know that? It's an expensive suit. Cheap shoes. The affectation of status. That's his tell. He's a salesman, popular at school, probably captain of the football team. - He's married, but he's having an affair. - How do you know? He has a mobile, but he's using a pay phone. - His wife checks his bills. - The battery could be flat. (chuckles) I used to have partners. Long ago, far away. We pulled long cons, short cons, card scams. We played the Melon Drop, the Rainmaker, the Fiddle Game, the Wire, and even the Badger. Always assume that the more sordid explanation is correct. (cell phone rings) Hi, honey. Yes. Still at work. Yeah. Sure. Lawrence, the game is not a game. - You would have to follow my directions. - Of course. I need to be able to trust you. There's no running back home the first time things become tricky. It's not going to happen. And another thing. You must never tell anybody about this. Ever. Any of it. Would you promise? LAWRENCE (narrating): I... promise. WOMAN: Borders and horizon lines (car door opens, closes) - We're alone, but side by side - (door opens) We're yet to dream We're yet to dream Nothing here is what it seems There's an animal inside There's an animal inside Half awake and almost dead Keeping empty beds elsewhere We're yet to bleed We're yet to bleed All the time and energy Ah-ah-ah - Ah-ah-ah - In silence Ah-ah-ah In silence Could we try to reinvent Feed the head... LAWRENCE (narrating): My parents would have killed me. I wasn't even allowed sleepovers. - And these people were criminals... - (snoring) but I didn't care. I was exactly where I wanted to be. The first scam I learned was the Lost Trinket. We would look for the worst pub in town... - (sheep bleating) - with the dodgiest barman. Someone with greed in their bones. I call these suckers tin mittens. (clinking) You know I did drama at school, right? Shut up, Lawrence. Do you want to go home to your stupid family? - What can I get you? - A drink for me and the lovely lady. Just a beer, thanks. LAWRENCE (narrating): There are five steps to any good con. First is roping the sucker. (laughs) We'd have a drink, sit around for a bit, then leave. Could you quit the Hamlet routine? What? The next day, I would come back to the same bar. Hello, my good lady. - Hi. - Hi. - My intended and I... - My fiance and I... - were here the other day... - And when she was dancing by the jukebox... when she went to powder her nose... - we think she lost... - she dropped... - her pendant. - I was hoping you might have... - Wondering if you found it? - No. - It's really special to us. - Family heirloom. - It really means a lot to me. - So if anyone finds it... - could you ask them to call this number? We're willing to offer you a $1,000 reward. LAWRENCE (narrating): Some time later, the Professor would arrive. (laughing) His favorite routine was to pretend to be drunk. - (groans) - (grunts) - Ooh. - Look what I found. Fuck me. - That's mine. - Oh, finders keepers. It's worth a pretty penny, I'd wager. Mmm. (chuckles) - Fifty bucks. - A hundred? Looks like gold to me. 200. That's it. I think I'll just hang on to it. - 250. - 300. - 375. - 400. And a six-pack. LAWRENCE (narrating): The most money we ever made was... (cash register dings) Hand it over, codger. (groans) The final step is the most important. Come on, come on. - When the bartender calls the number... - Yes. Hello. Listen, I've found your necklace. The family heirloom. What? (speaking Chinese) Huh? - Shit. - Fuck. LAWRENCE (narrating): If he tried to sell the necklace... And best of all, she can't tell the police... because she took the money straight from the cash register. Sneaky fuckers. Ah. Dodgy prigs. (sighs) Fuck this. - Where are you going? - I'm going for a walk. He could be ages. - Do you actually do that? - My record's two minutes. I've never been able to do it. My mum taught me. She can do it in 90 seconds. Here. She sounds like fun. If you think it's fun being a kid. Where's your mum? She left. What do I do first? Because of the Professor? He says the older I get, the more I speak like her. You know, I can see her face, but I have no memory of her voice. I wonder what she sounds like now, who she's talking to. You're not the only one who gets treated like a child. LAWRENCE (narrating): We pulled all kinds of different scams, but what the Professor really loved... was cards. No one knows exactly, but it's believed that cards were invented... somewhere in the seventh century... by the Chinese. LAWRENCE (narrating): What didn't we invent? PROFESSOR: Cards were brought down the Silk Road to markets in Egypt and the Holy Land. Originally, they were used to predict the future. In the 15th century, in Germany, the printing press allowed cards to be mass-produced. - Games of chance flourished across Europe. - (men laughing) And of course, the card cheats weren't far behind. - Hold out your left hand. - I'm right-handed. Oh, really? This... is your deck. The cards must become an extension of your body. But keep them in your hand even when you're asleep. You must become intimate with the weight, the feel, the size of them. Like the touch of a lover's breast. Wax on, wax off. That's a bezique deck... from 1910. All 64 of them. Cards used to be known as pasteboards. You just feel the thickness of those. There's over a hundred years of grit on them. It's the most valuable thing that I own. - What about me? - I don't own you, my dear. That much is obvious. These are beautiful. Where'd you get them from? They were a wedding gift from an old friend. The only thing from that friendship that survived. (chuckles) You never talk about Riley. Who's Riley? We could have been brothers. He taught me how to play cards. - He was a confidence man? - He was no con man. He was a thief. You blame him for everything. He took something very precious from me. Maybe she was just bored. MAN: You don't have to fall in line Life is such a crazy fight Live louder Uh Live louder Uh Hoo Hey, look, I did it! Uh Live louder Yeah, ow Get up and dance like you dance when there's no one around Sing a song the way you sing when you're in the shower Lose yourself, let your soul redesign a new kind of cool Redefine a new kind of - La-la-la-la-la-la - Louder - La-la-la-la-la-la - Live louder - La-la-la-la-la-la - Louder La-la-la-la-la-la Let it go Don't ever let anybody tell you the hand is faster than the eye.

Go, go, go, go, go Dance like you dance when there's no one around - Sing a song the way you sing when you're in the shower - I wanna hear you Lose yourself, let your soul redefine a new kind of cool Sure, Uncle. I'm making money. Quite a bit, actually. I don't have it all yet, but I will. - Live louder - Anyway, I have to go, Uncle. Talk to you soon. La-la-la-la-la-la MAN: No. No. No. - WOMAN: What? - No! - Excuse me! - If you want to check the sign out there, you'll see it's "secondhand record store." It's record. Analogue. A-N-A-L-O-G-U-E. So if you want to listen to music on your telephone, then I can't help you. Ai-yi-yi-yi. The chopsticks are an extension of your body. Very amusing. Yeah. I thought you were supposed to be good with your hands. Well, I know when I'm beaten. Ah. (chuckles) Charity. Thank you. Lawrence, this is actually really good. Mmm. You have excelled yourself, young man. I would like to propose a toast. Yeah. In order to welcome Lawrence to our little family of outcasts. Lawrence. I've had an idea for a scam. (bell dings) - Yes? - (broken English) Oh, wow. Very happy I am you have this band. I've looked all over Japan for it. I've looked on worldwide super highway. eBay. No can find. How much you want it for? Uh... Mmm. Minimal stylus damage. Patina on the cover, slightly foxed. Let's say $15. - Fifteen dollar? - Australian. Fifteen dollar? Are you crazy in the mind? All right. Ten? I not pay you 10 or 15. I pay you 50! What the hell was that? - Japanese foreign exchange student. - Aren't you Chinese? - I've got range. - Great con. So we're $50 down and holding a piece-of-shit record called... - Oh, my God. - Telling the Tale. Ah, excuse me. Have you carry another album like this one? Ah, no, no. Sadly, no. Oh! Because I need two album. One album to take home to Japan. I'm from Japan. To put in picture frame on wall to show my high school friends. And one to play, to listen to it. One album to play, to listen to it, and one to put in picture frame on my wall to show my high school friends, in Japan. I'm afraid I can't help you. This is a very, very obscure item. It's very rare, and it's quite valuable too. I know. You not tell me this. I looked on eBay. Rory MacLachlan. So popular in Japan. That's where I'm from. Listen, Jackie Chan, you understand the meaning of the word "obscure"? Tunnel of Sound is a rarities and collectibles emporium. We sell only the exceptional and the uncommon. Now fuck off. Oh. - Mister. - (groans) You don't understand. I'm a really big fan. - What? - A really big fan. Please, listen to me. I come back in one weeks. If you have another album like this one, I will pay you big money for it. Top dollar. He will believe me, 'cause I just spent 50 bucks on a shit record. Okay. What now? No fucking way. - Let's go over what you're going to say. - Can we? Your boyfriend's dumped you. You're upset, on the verge of tears. He gave you these records, but now you want to get rid of them. Wipe the slate clean. - But when you get to... - I couldn't only sell it for 50 bucks. I get it. What if he recognizes his own record? He won't. He'll get distracted by your... - My what? - Outfit. - Don't forget to upsell. - Lawrence, I got this. This guy's gonna pay up big for his own record. (broken English) Top dollar. (bell dings) - Did you want to sell those? - Yeah, sure. I'll give you 20 bucks for the lot. Wait! Thank God I found you. Sorry. These are my father's records. - That's my sister. - Your sister? (whispers) She's adopted. Aaah! (broken English) Oh. Oh, Rory MacLachlan. So cool in Japan. No, he's not. I looked it up. (slurping) LAWRENCE (narrating): The mark of a good con is not how much money you make. It's how clean you get away. Well, you broke it, you bought it. The old china. (slurping) Just as long as you gonna get what you need - It would have worked. - Don't worry about it. - I've seen worse. - You've seen worse? No, not really. (laughing) Oh, my God. PROFESSOR: Don't despair, Lawrence, my boy. You've made a great beginning. Oh, my first con. (continues, faint) Ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh LAWRENCE (narrating): The Professor loved to play poker. Even more, he loved to cheat at poker. After all, poker is a game designed to be played by liars. The ultimate form of the lie is the bluff. Bluffing turns a game of chance into a game of skill. LAWRENCE (narrating): But that's not the only reason the Professor loved poker. As far as I could tell, it was across a poker table that he met... her. WOMAN: In my foolish lover's game She was a small-time cheat, a peeker. She used shiners, tiny mirrors, to get a glimpse of the cards as they were dealt. It's easy to spot if you know what to look for. The Professor did know what to look for, but he also liked what he saw. The Professor was mucking back then, introducing foreign cards into a game. He was good, but so was she. Or maybe he tipped his hand. They became partners. More than partners. And together, they became readers. Readers use a marked deck. On the back of the cards are tiny dots or hidden patterns. Readers switch the honest deck for their own. This is called cooling the deck. LAWRENCE (narrating): Together, they could take on bigger rooms, higher stakes. But cooling the deck is a dangerous game. If someone suspects another player of being a reader, all he needs to do is demand a new deck. Take my breath away - Take my breath away - But they were good. They were very good. There's no encouragement like success, and they wanted more. - Enter Riley. - Take my... (all laughing) Riley was a great cheat, a card mechanic. He was always looking for an angle, and he cheated at every opportunity. By the time Sarah was born, it was over. Maybe he should have seen it coming. But you cannot cheat an honest man. (snoring) SARAH (whispering): Hey, Lawrence. - Where did you get that? - Out of your bag. Do as I do. - (coughing) - (chuckles) (exhales) It's one of the oldest in the book. Don't worry about it. I'm not my father. Keep your money. - Did you bring me in here to scam me? - What else? (chuckles) - Do you have any friends? - And what would I do with friends? - Normal people sometimes have some. - Have you ever had a girlfriend? - Sure. - Bullshit. (sighs) I've never had a girlfriend. (chuckles) I will drink to that. To no girlfriends. - To no boyfriends. - To no fucking friends at all. My father has no friends. - What about me? - (chuckles) Has the old fucker still not told you? (chuckles) (pouring liquid) (retches, groans) Oh, God. (retches) Okay, okay. (retches) Ah! (traditional) LAWRENCE (narrating): When something looks too good to be true, it usually is. Lying to people was really fun, but being lied to, not so much. - Forty. - Correct. - I don't know, about 30. - Ah, Lawrence! - Thirty-two. - Yeah, that's good. - Nineteen. - You're not concentrating. What am I doing here? You are studying the art. That's not what I mean. Why are we here? Where are we going? We're going to Melbourne. Melbourne? I don't want to go back to Melbourne. What possible reason could you have to go there? A card game. A big one. Every year for the past 50 years, a game's been played... in the same kitchen in Melbourne. The Cook's Game. Once played by the head chefs of fancy hotels, the Cook's Game is now worth the kind of money that attracts serious gamblers and dangerous men. I don't intend to lose the Cook's Game a second time. It takes $10,000 and the right connections to get a seat at the green felt. You aren't answering my question. It's called the Little Red Riding Hood game. I'm the brass. If I win my deal, the lambs know I'm a mechanic. So the old Professor needs a secret partner. I send a basket of goodies to grandma's house. I need a wolf in disguise. So all this time, you just wanted someone for a card game. Did you think I was teaching you out of the goodness of my heart? - And afterwards? - You'll get your share. What you do with it is up to you. Look, you asked me why I brought you here. I told you. But ask yourself, why are you still here? Because you love it. Lying, cheating. The gift of the grift is inside you. Always has been. Now I told you you could leave whenever you wanted. And so you can. (chuckles) But you won't. Watch me. Lawrence, don't let him get to you. (line ringing) LAWRENCE (on answering machine): Hi. You've called Leo, Mai-Ling and Lawrence. - No one's home. Please leave a message. - (beeps) Hi, Mum. Hi, Dad. It's Lawrence. Remember me? - (fireworks exploding) - It's noisy here. I just want to tell you... (sighs) I just wanted to say... LAWRENCE (narrating): But the Professor was right. (Chinese) I did love it. Every businessman knows you need money to make money. To get two seats in the Cook's Game, we needed money. Lots of it. In a hurry. Lawrence. Can you come here a sec? (sighs) - How old are you? - Nineteen. Eighteen. I can tell when you're lying. (scoffs) Seventeen and a half. - You haven't touched a girl before, have you? - Sure. What's my tell? A twitch? My voice? What? Do you really want to know? - Do you like me, Lawrence? - No. And there's your tell. I didn't see anything. Let's see. You come from a leafy Melbourne suburb with nice cars and a public library. You're a mama's boy. Your father had such high hopes for you. What would he say if he could see you now? But what you really want to know is if a girl like me could ever be with a boy like you. Could you? I mean, do you like me? No. Aren't you gonna call my bluff? And follow your own heart now Always I remember you Slow down And try to tell the truth I have a good poker face. You act angry when you're lonely, which is most of the time. You don't want to play the Badger, but he told you to. Your mum left you when you were little. And one day... One day you'll have the guts to leave too. But not yet. (sighs) It's only business. Come on. LAWRENCE (narrating): The most lucrative con we ever pulled was the Badger. Sarah played the Mack. The suckers were businessmen, married and in town for business. All kinds of business. - Hit me. - What? Hit me. (sighs) You fucking liar! - Don't call me a liar. - I trusted you. So I lied to you. Big deal. - I thought you loved me. - Grow up. People cheat. - Go back to the motel. - What if you need help? Go back to the motel. LAWRENCE (narrating): The Badger followed the five steps of a con, but was different in one important respect. In the Badger, the suckers roped themselves. Hey. LAWRENCE (narrating): The Badger doesn't rely on a sucker's greed. It plays on a different instinct altogether. You're in a hurry. You are... so beautiful. Do you have anything to drink? Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. LAWRENCE (narrating): When the moment was right, the Professor would barge into the room, claiming to be her father. The Badger was the one time he told the truth. Oh, no. He'd tell some story about how she was only 16, threaten to talk to his family, his work, the press. And the sucker would always pay. Through the nose. Guaranteed. Please. But the worst thing about the Badger was that it was so effective. We played it night after night. It's only business. Share the risk, share the reward. Hmm. Dinnertime. - They grow up so quickly. - Mmm. - Hello, Henry. - Sarah, my dear. You look more like your mother every day. Lawrence, this is the Birdman. Hello. Are you sure you're ready for this, Master Lawrence? - (chuckles) - (chuckles) It's an international affair. Elmsley's in again, and, um, some serious gambling junkie from Dubai. And then of course there's Riley. Now what about the, uh... Ah, let's eat. I'll do what I have to to get you the cards that you need. Bet big on my deal, but do not try being creative. For you, this is just about good card playing. - So I've learned it all for nothing? - They'll carve you up. At the end, it'll just be you and me playing cards. (chattering) (dance) [ Riley ] Beautiful. Isn't she? Who are you? You know who I am. And I know who you are. What do you want? A drink. You should stop following that old fool around. It's got no future. - He's not a fool. - He's always been a fool. Now he's an old one. - He'll beat you. - (chuckling) Let me see. The Little Red Riding Hood game? Perhaps a little cold tea in a hip flask? You play your little game. I'm going to win anyway. (continues) Ever been in love, Lawrence? No. (chuckles) I knew it. You have to work on that tell of yours. Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me. Love. It can make a man do things... things he will later regret. I don't think the Professor's ever likely to forgive you. Sour old bastard got what was coming to him. I'm talking about that little baby girl. My daughter. That's right. He hasn't told you that, has he? So, Lawrence, is my secret safe with you? May the best man win. Hey, stop! Lawrence? What are you doing here? You're in serious trouble. She's only 17. I'm afraid the only course of action available to me, sir, is to contact your family. - No, Lawrence! - That is, of course, unless you can think of another way we can sort this out. (grunting) Get off him! (wheezes) LAWRENCE (narrating): It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye. - Sarah... - Shut up. Here. Nothing broken. I've never been in a fight before. It really hurts. No shit. I was trying to be normal for one night. Sorry. You shouldn't have followed me. Just looking out for a friend. Lawrence, you're not my friend. I told you, we don't make friends. It's not what we do. It's just Dad and me. He's... not... He's not here. You'll never be one of us. That's why I trust you. We can do this, Lawrence. We have to. We can leave him. Together. LAWRENCE (narrating): I know I look confident, but I got pretty good at pretending. But pretending is just another lie, and the Cook's Game was the real thing. (clears throat) You look great, Dad. Hmm. This is it, Lawrence, my boy. (clears throat) I'll see you there. Do me proud. (door opens, closes) Don't move your eyes to the right when you're bluffing. That's my tell? It's that obvious? Why couldn't I see it? Think about it. (chuckles) You can't see your eyes moving in a mirror. Time to go, Hamlet. (sighs) Ah, what up, dog? Ooh, yeah, uh They say these songs ain't the style no more When these kids go wild, man, I ain't so sure Yeah, uh, check it out, uh They told me live within your means, kid I don't know what that means, man I dream big All day, I got these scenes where we light the night up like gasoline Turning average into magic like a pocketful of beans And it seems so simple But when I turn the windows of my soul out the window Point 'em at my kinfolk - What name, young man? - Jeremy Fong. Good luck tonight, Master Fong. This way, please. Baby hate the mirror, get her pretty face all modified And I wish that I could change it, love But ain't nobody plans this stuff But it's gonna be all right I'm crystal balling Don't worry about that shit We'll work it out in the morning Get your last call in This is Master Jeremy Fong. Oh, you're younger than I expected. Welcome to the game. Please, take a seat. I don't recognize you, kid. Where do you normally play? Shanghai. Macau, sometimes. My father's casino. I like him. If the kid pays, the kid plays. Macau? (Chinese) Sorry. I don't speak Cantonese. Only Mandarin. (door opens) Gentlemen, some of you may have met Mr. Riley. Two-time winner of the game. You've met Rashid. This is Alex Elmsley, Jeremy Fong and... Hello, Vernon. How's that little girl of yours? Please, Mr. Riley. Keep it nice. All friends here, Alice. Now... (cracks knuckles) let's play some fucking cards. You ain't gonna see me comin' Got a quick draw LAWRENCE (narrating): Poker is a game designed to be played by liars. But not all liars are equal. What about you, Professor? Have you grown a pair? Two pair actually. (chuckles) LAWRENCE (narrating): The inexperienced pretends to have skill. The skillful pretends to be green. Screw you, kid. And so we control the cards. The only variables are the other players. Motherfucker! Something to remember me by. Riley! Get him out of here. You ain't gonna see me comin' So take your best shot LAWRENCE (narrating): Ladies and gentlemen, the Little Red Riding Hood game. The Professor stacks his chips dirty to tell me Rashid's number is up. First, I signal what cards I have. This card is a queen. He goes rabbit-hunting in the muck to get the cards we need. Then he goes south to stack the deck. He false shuffles with a push-through or an up-the-ladder so the deck stays stacked. He crimps the bottom card before he gives the deck to the next player to cut. And a classic pass gets the cards back in order. (clears throat) With the cowboys we dealt him, he has to take the bait. The flop turns both pairs into trips. And right now, his three kings beat my three queens. Three kings... the Christmas special. The Professor bottom deals, and there she is. Rashid's money card. Now he has the boat. Kings over queens. Almost nothing beats a full house. Almost. Four queens. The Village People. (foreign language) (lighter flicks open) LAWRENCE (narrating): Con men don't play games. They play people. And people are unpredictable. To be honest with you, they were happier times. Salad days. (chuckles) I remember them with affection. I remember differently. You've done a really good job with Sarah, you know. She's a beautiful woman, just like her mother. Though she has my eyes. She's nothing like her mother. Really? When she finds a man who gives her what you can't, she's gone. ALICE: Hey! It's only cheating when you get caught, right, Professor? ALICE: Get him out of here. I trust that no one else will insult the house. She left me too, you know. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. I was the card player, but she was a better liar. What are you doing here, kid? I mean, really, what the hell are you doing here? You sure about that? (chuckling) Yes. Don't feel bad. Honesty. It's a good quality. (exhales) You little fuck! (grunts) Mmm, mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah Oh, ah (vocalizing) Whoa, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah (man rapping on radio) - (stops) - (sighs) I can't do this. It's our only chance. I wrote a letter. I should take it in. I'll do it. Back in a minute. - She finally did it. - Shit! My little girl's grown up. She's on her own. Good girl. Not on her own. We planned it together. This note, it's for you. I think you'll find, my dear boy, it's for you. LAWRENCE (narrating): In a sweetheart con, the suckers rope themselves. Listen, anyway, we've got your wallet, so... To no fucking friends at all. We can do this, Lawrence. We have to. We can leave him. I wrote a letter. I should take it in. SARAH'S VOICE: I'm sorry for leaving like this, but it's all I know how to do. I can imagine how you'll feel, but I just couldn't face good-bye. Not with you. You know what they say... "lucky at cards." (chuckles) Thank you for everything. Say good-bye to him for me. "I will miss you and think of you often. Love always, Sarah." You were great out there tonight, my boy. You're a real player. - I let the team down. - But... The better man won. Aren't you angry? (sighs) I'd have given it to her if she'd asked. It's only money. Mine's a dying art, my boy. An art of grace and tact. Nowadays, a chap in a suit can hit some keys in a machine and rob honest people of millions without even lookin' 'em in the eye. We trick people into giving us money. We make them dishonest. They're dishonest to begin with. Even you. Chinese lucky money? You might need it. How about you? I'll be fine. You saw it coming, right? This is a con movie, you said to yourself, and all con movies end with a scam. Well, you're right. But even though it does end with a scam, this isn't a con movie. This is my life. (voices rewinding) (breathing deeply) I can't do this. - Sarah, listen... - No, Lawrence, you don't understand. I was going to leave you both. I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do. Sarah. Children grow up and leave their parents. It's what's supposed to happen. He just needs to know he's been a father to you. (inhales, exhales) But what about you? You're the only friend I've ever had. LAWRENCE (narrating): Some things are not quite lies and not quite truth. I'll be okay. They're just what people need to hear. PROFESSOR: "I'm sorry for leaving like this, but it's all I know how to do. I can imagine how you will feel, but I just couldn't face good-bye. Not... Not with you. You know what they say... 'lucky at cards.' Thank you for everything. Say good-bye to him for me. I will miss you and think of you often. Love always, Sarah." You were great out there tonight, my boy. A real player. - I let the team down. - But... No, the better man won. No. He might be the better mechanic, but you're the better man. You raised her, even though you knew she was his daughter. You gave her a life. You were her father. (chuckles, sniffs) I have confidence in you. Thanks. But I'm going home. Hmm. Chinese lucky money. But you might need it. What about you? (chuckles) I'll be fine. LAWRENCE (narrating): You don't always need to beat the man. Sometimes it's enough to be the man. I haven't seen the Professor since that night. I'm sure he's still out there, somewhere, doing what he does best. I haven't seen Sarah either. Someone sent me a photo one time. But there was no name. Perhaps she didn't want to lie. Told any good lies lately? Lying is a part of human nature. We all tell lies. And those of you who don't... are lying. (rock intro) It was summer when I saw your face Looked like a teenage runaway And God, I never thought we'd take it that far Some killer queen you are Now I'm running and I can't stop The beauty of the three-card monte is that even though people know it's a scam, they still play. Everybody wants to beat the man. So, who wants to play? Who wants to play? You can't win if you're not in. The three-card monte. Toss the broad, find the lady. It's a story of two jokers and a queen. And it's such a roller coaster Some killer queen you are We took the bones out from the road Those endless nights that we traveled we stole You let your clothes fall to the floor - Hey, man. - Hey, thanks. So you know that thing about your tell? Is that true? - No, it's all bullshit. - What about everything else? Is that what really happened? Nah. (chattering) (pop intro) WOMAN: The look on your face When you lie is something kind of beautiful, beautiful Babe, I get played Every time you change your mind Then I better watch Mark the space As something kind of dangerous Strange as it seems Where we lay Soul to soul, this love was bound to break Baby, the day you ran away Was like a bullet to my heart Why do we make the same mistakes Every time? And I know there's nothing left to say Somehow we always fall apart The shining sparkle fades away Between you and I The look on your face When you lie is something kind of beautiful, beautiful Babe, I get played Every time you change your mind Then I better watch Mark the space As something kind of dangerous Strange as it seems Where we lay Soul to soul, this love was bound to break 'Cause, baby, the day you ran away Was like a bullet to my heart Why do we make the same mistakes Every time? And I know there's nothing left to say Somehow we always fall apart The shining sparkle fades away Between you and I If the truth isn't true An idea is something that you'd like me to Like to believe But I don't When does love become a state of war? Cross the fire, little liar Something creatin' hate in what we used to adore We collide And I can't even look you in the eye 'Cause, baby, the day you ran away Was like a bullet to my heart Why do we make the same mistakes Every time? And I know there's nothing left to say Somehow we always fall apart The shining sparkle fades away Between you and I The shining sparkle fades away Between you and I Between you and I The shining sparkle fades away Between you and I
