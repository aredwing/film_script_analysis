 

                        You understand what we're dealing with here is classified material? - Yes sir. - Good. Miss Riley, why do you think you were nominated for this project? At the NSA, I specialized in military psychology... and was promoted to a senior position within six months. I am one of the youngest. We usually don't recruit people over 25. They're too hard to break in. I base most of my work on your theories and case studies. So you have this... unique ability to break down advanced physiognomy and micro-expression? Yes sir. You are able to tell if and when somebody is lying to you? Yes sir. That must be quite useful in all walks of life. By the way, my name is not Mr Phillips. Is that true or false? Your evaluation here today is pretty simple and straightforward. I will judge your reactions to a selection of pre-recorded material. That means that your own observations are very important. But for someone of your pedigree I don't foresee a problem. You still have the option to walk out the door. Congratulations. These tapes do not exist. This room does not exist. Ready? All Echoes, we advise, Test Group 17 in receiving with 3 males, 1 female. Roger, Data Control, we have a cleanup crew nearing completion. - Control receiving. - Go ahead, receiving... - Control, first candidate is out. - Roger that, receiving. All Echoes, we advise candidate in transit. Stand by to initiate phase 1. Echo team standing by... All of this happens in that room. TOD 10:00 hours. Initiating phase 1. All personnel reconfirm dumping candidate. - Roger Control, we are Oscar Mike. - Roger data control, standing by. Please read this over carefully and sign right there where it's needed. Thank you. Oops, sorry. Isalano, K. Female. DOB 1972. Criminal record: negative. Okay, can you confirm status as married? - Status married confirmed. - Confirm. Ma'am? I broke it. How many different ways can I give you my date of birth? - Um... excuse me... - Yes ma'am? - Oh no, I meant her. - Oh, right. I broke my pencil. What the fuck? Looks like they've already had a problem before, huh? How is it? Uhm,... it's a lot. It's pretty confusing. - Please carefully consign... - That's alright, I've got my own. Haines, C. Male. D.O.B. 1965. Criminal record: affirmative. Code 1202 Roger, Data receiving. We have the candidate now. Dude... you look a total pro, uh? Well, let's just hope... this isn't the one where they feed you some of your shit for 3 days. Excuse me. You'll need these. And this... And do remove that hood, please. - Brody, P. Male. Criminal record: negative. - Roger that, receiving... Hey, you guys are "native" or "naturalized"? What would you be? Well, were you born here? Were you born in this country? - Yeah. - So you'd be naturalized. That's what I thought. - What's that? - That's what I thought. But youre not a native of... this country... That's it! Need a hand? Yeah, you just wanna check each one of these... right there on the bottom... you wanna date it too... - eh, what, what's that? - K.I.? No, I know. - Isalano Kerry. - Thank you. - Yeah. Observation, please. It's hierarchy and subordination. We simulated the Gottan experiments in Grad. School. We put a man and a woman, a couple, in a room together. And one partner acted superior, it was almost always an expression of contempt. And no relationship survives contempt. Hierarchy and subordination. I think you will find this project a little bit more complex. When was this experiment conducted? Affirmative, received all candidates' input. We are safe. Designation Test Group 17. I say again, designation 17. Look about, gentlemen. Mother is watching. Listen baby, uhm, I'm gonna be late tonight. They have to drive us back to our cars after this. So I would ask you or something? Ah, go look by the bed. Mom's check is in the envelope there. It has to go out today. Okay? I love you baby, and uhm, I'll see you when this wraps up. Okay? - You, you've done this kinda thing before? - Yeah. - What do they usually pay? - Well, uh... it's... you know, 50, 100 bucks. Depends on how long they keep you. Usually about a day. This place... I have a feeling it could be little bit more. Let me just hope... they don't make us take... diet pills or something, drugs... something to turn us into zombies or whatever the fuck. In all seriousness, as a long time lab rat... careful about wishing for things, you know. You don't wanna hope for anything, 'cos usually don't turn out that way. But I'll tell you what, the flip side of that... I don't know another job where you get non-stop medical attention. Hi! - Right? There you go... - Thank you. Mother entering. Negative contact. TOD 10:15. Morning, everybody. I'm Dr Phillips... and I'm gonna be your supervisor here today. But before we get going, I'm required to ask you a couple of questions... and to collect these forms, which will have made absolutely no sense. We're all American citizens, right? Absolutely. - We're all of sound mind? - Most of the time. We're not crazy? Good. No one forced us into being here today? - No. - Good. That takes care of that. Well, our little experiment here today... concerns testing quite extensively... the nature and the limitations of the human psyche. The test is subdivided into four separated, escalating phases, the first of which began the moment I walked in through that door. Oh, listen up... the final payment for the day... Wish I was doin' that kinda money. I do apologize for these consent forms. I know they're a pain in the butt, but... don't look at me, guys. Wasn't my idea. And the final thing... up in the right top corner there, if you can write a contact number. - What if you don't have a contact number? - If you don't have one, leave it blank. If you don't mind, I would like personal effects in these envelopes. That's anything from watches, wallets, cell phones, box cutters, hand guns, thermo-nuclear devices... whatever you've got in your pockets, please put it inside the envelope. Stealth bomber, bazookas... - You don't have anything in your pockets? - No. My, uh... my girlfriend's supposed to call. Might find it best not to tell her anything incriminating. You know they usually don't make us do this in these things... Oh, you'll have it back by the end of the day, I promise. How... how many hours will we be here? Oh, eight. - What's that, 30 an hour? - It's 31,25. Are we going to be doing any tests like that might make us feel uncomfortable? No, no. Nothing like that. - I mean, you were tellin' me that before. - What? I... No, I promise. You know what? You won't be running to the john every five minutes. Hey, back to phase 1. It is basically a process... of elimination. We'll begin with all four of you, then narrow it down to three, then two and so on. But don't you worry... the order in which you are eliminated... will have no impact on your final monetary compensation. You will all end up with Is everybody ready? Let's do it. By the way, what's your name again? - Kerry. - Kerry. All echoes, we are closed traffic. We have 'nimble sweater'. What's the present, Echo? Control, Echo 1. Confirm need of medical carry outs... - Stand by, Control. - Roger, Echo 1. Stand by for report. How bad? - I think she's dead. - She's fuckin' dead? That was fuckin' amazing. Well done! Well done! Smile boys, It's fuckin' shit. It's gonna be all over fuckin' YouTube. It's a fake. It was fuckin' fake. You got us! Congrats. We're all a big bunch of pussies, but we wanna go home now. Thank you. - It's not fake. - It was a fake. It was a half fake. I saw a fuckin' bullet... Come on, you fucker... Fuck! We need help! Get us some fuckin' help in here! Help! Help! Negative, Control. No contact. - Maybe this is what it's supposed to be. - What is supposed to be? - Maybe this is what this is. - What the fuck you talkin' about? The doctor, the experiments, the test, whatever... They shoot someone in front of you and they see how you deal with it. You put 4 people in a room and shoot one of 'em, and leave the rest to fend for them fuckin' selves. Now what, they're watching up there taking notes? Yeah, to see how we react... - Stand by all teams. Hold short. - Roger, Data Control. All team leaders: Sit red. - Echo team, we are go. - Medical team standing by. All teams, KR-13 is clear. How are you getting away with this? Families report them missing. Happens all the time. It is important for you to take it all in, remain calm, never lose control. It can't be government. The MK Program has always been outside the government. Outside everything. The MK Program? That's not possible. How can it...? Are you military? Patriot Act? Several people you admire had these questions. NSA Intelligence Director, Michael Zimmer. Your own deputy director, Eric Rogante. - Heading out. - Roger that, Control. Emily, everything will make sense. You can't just be killing people. I been thinking about it. Some kinda experiment... or something like that. Somebody would've found out by now. What if they're doing this thing completely in secret? It's not secret, no, it's in the fuckin' newspapers... it's in the classifieds, right here, people knew about this. People are going to that, but do you know where we are? No! 'Cos everything started looking the same to me after fuckin' Mansfield. Well that was a long drive. Nobody knows where, nobody has any fuckin' clue where we are. And you know it! That's the whole point. Why do people answer this fuckin' ad to come and get shot? Look, I've been doin' this stuff steadily for a long time. Okay, but have you ever been taken from one place to an ultimate location? It's not uncommon. They pick you up, they bring you to another place, but people don't just disappear. You don't think anyone's gonna know if she don't come home tonight? You hear that? - It opened. - What was that? What they used to kill her. Let me see. - It's you. - What? How do I know you're not in on it? - Ridiculous! - No, he's not in on it. Let's just stop, let's talk about this, alright? Get him to talk about it. Only one of us is gonna make it outta here. Four phases, four people. You know what, phase 1 is already over, and it's fuckin' her... welcome to phase 2. - Hold on, hold on... - Check, check the gun. Medical Unit, move to KR-13 and stand by. How many bullets you got in that gun? Why don't you press the button and check the mag? It's empty. Check the slide. One bullet. There's one bullet and there's three of us. Maybe the purpose of the gun is not to kill each other, but to maybe get outta here. I think you should calm him down, and shoot the fuckin' window. No, no, calm down, calm down, alright! We're not gonna shoot the window. The window's bulletproof. We're just going to calm down, wait for the next thing. What the fuck? You have two hours remaining. Please answer question. What? What does it say? It's a... It says... "What number do Americans choose most frequently between 1 and 33"? "Subject furthest from correct answer will be next civilian casualty" "Refusal to provide answer entirely results in automated end of all remaining subjects". "Best luck". Best luck! Best luck? It's "good luck". Mother! Mother fuckers! Alright, alright. No! Help! - Open the fucking door! - Come on! TOD 11:37. Test Group 17 progressing positively. Stimulus 1-Alpha now active. You haven't asked me yet what we're trying to accomplish here. if I asked that, this interview would be over. Good. Observation, please. Observation? Miss Riley? The language following the question is purposely stilted... uses English as a second language. You came to that conclusion well ahead of others. Good job, I'm impressed! Sir, Sanction 9 controls stopped The Rockefeller Commission. President Ford signed executive orders shutting down the entire MK program. Carter and Reagan too. With all due respect, how can you circumvent the orders of three presidents? Well, after 9/11 we were out of options, I guess. But our actions here have been granted a full amnesty. - Amnesty? - Mmm. Is this "the killing room"? Is that what you call it? I'm gonna tell you what my superior told me some 20 years ago, before I defected. Never forget that our enemies have someone just like you... someone just like me... doing exactly the same thing as we speak. Initiating audio playback. Commencing Stimulus 1-Bravo. All Echoes, we are going and live. Take 1-Bravo. Initiating... You hear that? What the fuck is that? What language is it? - What language is that? - I dunno, could be anything. - Sounds Muslim? - That's not a language. Whatever it is, it ain't English, it ain't American. Echo-4, reframe camera 1. Roger that. Echo 1, increase audio playback for adhesion and hold. Roger, Control. increasing for adhesion, Roger that. Al Qaeda? They're gonna fuckin' kill us. You think about it. Al Qaeda. Hire some friendly-looking white guy. You don't know who it is. Could be anybody. Listen, you gotta be careful about... screwin' up your head. That's exactly what they want. You'll be telling me what... I mean, I watch the news. I know they're living here everywhere on U.S. soil. They're renting the houses, hotels. Yeah, so why would they wanna go after these normal people? Because they wanna broadcast this shit. Just like they did with those people when they cut their fuckin' heads off. They wanna put it all over the internet. Help. What? Somebody like, etched "help" into the wall. Candidate Delta has discovered stimulus 1-Charlie. Roger that, Echo 4. TOD 11.40. 1-Charlie discovered by candidate Delta... at 2 hours and 10 minutes. Be advised all Echoes, we are live at 1-Charlie. Roger, Control. Stat chart puts candidate in 95th percentile. Think there's more down there, too. - Yeah, everywhere. Holy shit! - These are names... There's T... T... Tammy. "Remember". Hey, they're more than names, they're more than names here. But they've painted over, so that you can't fuckin' read it. Rita Hatinburough. Oh, shit. I gotta read it. May be something here that can help us. What does it say? "Pray, pray... Pray for us". "Pray for us". What, what does it say? Kate M. December... December 25. I told you it was them. Christmas. It's fuckin' Muslims. They killed a guy on fuckin' Christmas. They killed a guy on fuckin' Christmas. "Pray... Pray for us here". No prisoners, hey? Muslims. There's gotta be a clue in here. There's a way to beat these bastards. The project is continually changing, evolving. You will help it to do so. As you can see, everything is meticulously planned... and initiated just like any other MK program. It's an exact science. We have to stay on top of it, we have to refine it, refine, refine. It usually took us 6 to 8 hours to reach this point. But after we put those names on the wall, now that really sped up the process. 13. Now. Now let's screw it. It's not that hard. It's 7. everybody al... always picks. - Why would it be any different, 1 to 33? - No, because this isn't 1 to 10. No one can answer the fuckin' question, no one can answer the question. Maybe, maybe it's 2 Maybe 1 to 3, 3... talkin' 1 to 33... Fuck you! - Wait! - No! You feel better now, buddy? Just what'd ya think you're fuckin' doing? Stupid, fuckin' stupid, stupid, you could've... Think! Fuck it! That bullet goes off, it would've bounced all over the fuckin' room. I'm tellin' you, he better start fuckin' thinking! I don't want it. Shoot! Shoot! - Shoot! - He's not there. - Shoot! Shoot! NOW! - He's not there! Get... C'mon. - Can you see him? - No. What happened? - There's nothing there. - You, anything? - No! What, what? I was only feet away. I was fuckin' near nailin' em... Wait, wait... Echo 2, amplify transmission. - Wilco, Control. - They can't see us under here. - Okay? One of us is gonna die next. It could be me or it could be you. Initiating audio stimulus 1-Delta. There's somebody out there. Go to the window and distract them. - How? - I'm goin'. Go to the window. Get over, get over here! Relax your hand, relax your hand. Fuckin' get us out of here. They're fuckin' movin' the clock. How long does a race horse last when he looks like this? You are definitely the most entertaining of all of us. They're probably gonna want to keep you around so they can... so they can watch you. Get me up, man, get me up! The elimination must be rigorous. We have to be certain the perfect candidate emerges. Considering the lengths you'll go to find it, what you're looking for must be... extremely rare. Is this a problem for you? Not a problem. Ready? Yes sir. Victor 1, reporting tape 2 TOD 13.29. Test Group 17 active in KR-13. Test Group 17, the second of 4 test groups running today. Correct status of Test Group 17 is 1-Delta with 3 active candidates. Nearing completion of 1-Delta. Waiting for a candidate designation. Mother is present in the control room and all designations are his call. Mother reporting a possible match in this group. Echo team reports Echoes 1 through 6 active and at their posts... and Medical Unit 2 is standing by. - Echo team, how do you read? - Gimme Charlie, Control, another busy day. Listen, listen. So we're each gonna pick the same number, okay? Each one of us? - Then it's a tie, and nobody dies. - Everybody dies. No, nobody dies, because it's a dead heat. We're all equal. We need to just follow the rules. One of us has got thirty minutes to live. We gonna have to start picking some fuckin' numbers. I'm unlucky with numbers. Hey, hey, hey, we need you to stay with us. We're a team. What's your name? - I'm Tony. Anthony. - This here's... - Crawford. - Crawford. Paul. I'm gonna pick a really easy number, okay? Yeah, now when I 1st saw the questionnaire, the first thing came to my mind was 17. No, 17 was on the wall. It's gotta be 7. - 7's fine. - 7? - 7 it is. - 7? Who's gonna answer the question first? Tony? - Yeah. - Paul, you go second; I go last. When I'm dead... Gary Brodie... Buffalo. I think he's still there and not in Syracuse. Just tell him I was here. Nobody knows. Gary from Buffalo or Syracuse. I got it. My girl, Costa Billings. Spell it how it sounds. Just tell her I love her, and uhm... make sure she takes care of my mom. - You? - Me? No. Nobody needs to know. Hail Mary, Full of grace, The Lord is with Thee, You think they're really gonna go through with this? Yes. These people won't stop until everybody's dead. Amen. - Alright, 7 - 7, right? 7. I have a kid named Mae Ann Haines. I never get to see her. Please submit answer. Recognized. Please submit answer. - 17 - Fuck! Recognized. Please submit answer. Thank you. Next casualty selected. All candidates static. Initiate transfer to Medical Unit. Roger, Control. Transporting 3 statics to Medical Unit 2. Most people can't even look into that room.

Clawed your way up from the pool of thousands. There's been some criticism... that you're cold, self-serving... I read somewhere... one of your superiors labelled you as... ruthless. Just want you to know that's why we chose you. - Medical, data sit red. - Roger that, Control All teams. 3 statics have returned. Controllers, stand by for KR-13 re-link on my mark...

Roger, Control. Playing Mozart's 'String Quartet No. 17 in B Flat'. Mother, all systems show green. Can't see, can't see! They took our blood. They took our blood. Can't you see it? We all agreed to say 7! Activate stimulus 1, Echo. Do it! You're fuckin' one of them! You are! You're fuckin' one of them. Do it, do it, do it! Be advised, all Echoes. Candidate identified barrier, escape route 18. 1, we already have that in the pre-action report. - Echo 1, initiate stimulus 1-Foxtrot. - Roger Wilco, Control. What's it say? "Where does the United States of America rank... on the international list of overall average Intelligence Quotients"? "Subject farthest from correct answer will be last civilian casualty". "Fail to provide answer entirely or providing same answer as other subject... will result in automated mutual end". "Best luck". People will do anything to survive, don't you think? I'll go to Hell for what I did, Uh? Yeah, you'll go to Hell. - What's an intelligence quote? - Quotient! Quotient. It's your IQ. You know the answer? I didn't... I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. No, you just uh, you just did what you had to do. Right? You did what you had to do. Right? All teams be advised. Initiating stimulus 1-Gamma. Who's that talking again? Talking, talking... No, that's not talking. That's praying. They're fuckin' praying. Tony was right. Come on! Come here! Now right above my head is a very thick ceiling... with an air shaft. Alright, do you understand what I'm saying now? It'd be easier with you, but I can manage without you. No, no. I was thinking... the only way out would be just to cooperate, maybe, to cooperate. Cooperate? How many of these people, these names on the wall, do you think cooperated? Look at all these names. How many people? These fuckers are up to something with us! How many days, how many weeks how many years... you think these fuckers have been doing this? Studying people. They are capable of doing shit to us that we could never imagine. Now we have to do... we have to tell somebody. We have to, we have to go tell somebody. Anybody. And let people know that these fuckers are here. Right now, they're here. I'm just going to do what they tell me to do. All teams, Mother identified final candidate for this test group. When they first recruited me to MK-Ultra... I was just like you. A young doctor, trying to save some lives. If you have to terminate a candidate... you have to do it quickly, as painless as possible. It's not easy to kill a man. Or a woman for that matter. Observation, please. You know who the final subject will be. You've known all along. From the questionnaires before you started. To a point, yes. Some candidates fall below expectation. Now, nobody will never fuckin' remember me. I know it. If you don't wanna spend another moment in this room... answering another fuckin' question, I can get us outta here. - You wanna stay here? - You're gonna get fuckin' killed. - Subject to change facility breach. - Roger that, Echo 2. Help me up, why don't ya? Come here, Paul! Help me up! Come on! That's it, that's it, come on! Push up! 2 and 4, hold short. Remain observers only. Do not engage. Don't interfere with the experiment. - Candidate 3 is now into escape route 16. - Roger that, Echo 1. Go! - Echo Team. How do you read me? - Temperature under control. .5... Heat-ray intensity .5... Go to... .8... Increase retabs to 245.8... Approaching red light, Control. Approaching red light, Control. Looks like Candidate 3 heading east along escape route 18. Team B, upper level. Echo 7 and 13, stand by to engage. Do not interfere with KR-13. - Echo 2, amplify transmission. - Wilco, Control. Roger that, Echo 3. Echo 7 and 13, stand by to engage. Candidate 3 is still moving east along route 18. - Control, this is Echo 7. - Roger that, Echo 7. Stand by to engage. Echoes, engage and suspend. Control, this is Echo 7. Contact with Candidate Delta. - Candidate is suspended. - Roger that, Echo 7. Mother, candidate is static. Medical move to external shaft 16. Equip candidate for transfer. One candidate in external shaft 18 for transfer back to KR-13. Transfer to begin immediately after medicals visit parameter. - Control, Candidate Delta is unconscious. - Copy. Sir, Medical Report: Candidate Delta is unconscious, and transfer teams are bringing him back now. All teams prep for KR-13, log down and relay. Good work, gents. Mother is pleased. Transfer teams: Position static, and maintain an aggressive posture. Get up! Come on, come on! Come on! Security breach. Security breach. KR-13 security breach. Corridor 3 unsafe. Exit and enter. Give me the key. All teams standing by for re-engagement. I know this can be overwhelming, life-changing. You have let me down. They told me you were ready. You're not ready. Stand by for viewing-room lock out. I am ready. We're testing the breaking points of civilians. We're proving what they're capable of. You're wasting my time. You wanna hear my observation? Your analytical skills are exceptional, but you don't have the stomach nor the resolve to be part of our program. Apoptosis. Apoptosis, that's your objective isn't it? There's a more effective way to reach your outcome. How much time? "Where does the United States of America rank... on the international list of overall average Intelligence Quotients"? Five... five. Five? What's that? America is definitely in the top 5 in IQs... I read about it in Time Magazine, when I doing that fuckin' Graham experiment. You go with 5. It's your best bet, I'm tellin' you. And then, you know, one of us dies, but... one of us survives, right? What do you think they're gonna do with the survivor? Do you think they're gonna let us go? - We have to be prepared. - Prepared for what? In half an hour, that door over there is gonna open... One of us needs to be prepared to run out, make a run for it... Look at me. Do you remember the layout of the building? Outside that door there's a hallway. Turn to the right. And all the way down to the left there's a staircase. Do you remember that? You take that staircase down... you take that until you find the first emergency exit. Pull the lever. We have to be prepared. That's enough! They can't grab hold of you, see. That's slippery. You can't do that. I... It's slippery so they can't get a hold of you. They slip right off. Maybe alright, the door opens, you grab the gun and you shoot and kill 'em. You kill the doctor, you create chaos. - Now take your jacket off. - No, no. - Just take your jacket off, trust me... - No. I won't take... - Trust me, trust me. - I can't. I can't! fourth, fourth highest average IQ. 4. - 4. - No, you can't pick the same number. - 4, I was gonna say 4. - We can't pick the same number. I'm saying 4. Say 4, there are 4 on 5. That way neither one of us goes to Hell, and they stay the bad guys. Bite, grab into anything you can! You kick, you pull... - head butt... - shut 'em out there... and you just point, aim... fire. Point, fire, run. Point, fire, run. Point, fire, run. We're gonna save lives. in your head. If you can you beat 'em there, then you've already won. "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not... " - Man, man. - Two minutes. We're gonna save lives. We're gonna save lives. Tell me what you know about apoptosis. All Echoes: Mother has locked in candidate designation. All teams move to your positions for casualty execution. Read. Roger, control. Echoes 6 and 7 standing by for KR-13 breach. It is a mechanism in the human body where an inferior cell realizes... it's detrimental to the system... a cell willing to sacrifice itself for the greater good. One of us has to survive and let people know that these fuckers are here. Right now they're here. It jumped another 30 seconds. Please submit answer. Go! Go! I would've never made it. - But you will! - Pull! TOD 19.00 hours. Designation is a positive match. Transferring KR-27, rear corridor 3. Hold short at intersect 7 to receive Mother's instructions. Roger, Control. Over and out. Only a select few have made it through the entire process. Congratulations. Test Group 17 is a success. Test Group 17 is a success. We have a positive match. All teams: We have a positive match. Our program here successfully proves... that one out of 20 ordinary Americans have the disposition... to become a civilian weapon. A civilian willing to kill themselves for their country... a civilian guaranteeing to take his own life for our country. So you're creating American suicide bombers?
