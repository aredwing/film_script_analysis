 

                        Not far now. Stay together! What are they? Johan! Johan! Mr. Jones, help us. Please. Please help us! Oh no. Theo's on the left. Oh, he's away. Oh no. You're going to die if you do that. A police car. Police? Why is there a police car? Where's Mum's car? -I'm scared. -Rachel. There are a few formalities we'll have to go through. Rachel, there's been an accident. It's Mum. Rachel... Rachel... Dad's crying. Theo, there's been an accident. No... No... Theo, please, I need you. No, I can't. Theo, are you there, are you there? On the left, you'll see, One Tree Hill, formerly known as Muangakiekie Pa. That's just one of the almost fifty volcanoes that Auckland City is built on. -Let me see. -Get off. Where is he? Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Ah, did you see my phone? Did I have it? What's the time? -Sorry I'm a bit late. -That's okay. -How's it going? -It's great to see you guys. Nice hickey So your dad, he's okay, right? Yeah. He just needed some time out. He's having a total meltdown. That's a really great thing to tell people. It's true. Hello, you two. Good to see you. Hello. Welcome. Cool place. If you want to live in a concrete bunker, eh? Nobody's forcing you. Ricky's room is down the end there. And you're in here. Bunks. -You're so much like her. -I know. I'll let you get unpacked. See the volcanoes on the way in? Are they dangerous? Only when they erupt. But that hasn't happened round here for a few hundred years. I want to go check them out. You don't have to go far. You're right on the edge of one. -The lake? -It's a crater. what's that smell? It's like rotten cabbages. I can't smell anything. The beach is just over the way, but it would be a bit cold for a swim. Just getting close to the fire. And there are kayaks? Richard, you'll show them the kayaks? They're under the house, round the back. Show them. When do we get to meet this girl. What's her name? Tangerine? Clementine. -What's with that old house? -The Wilberforce place? -Wilberforce? -They're freaks. No, they just keep to themselves. I've seen him sitting out there by the lake at, two o'clock in the morning. Old people have trouble sleeping. You'd know. -It used to be a funeral home. -Richard! Who told you that? The crazy old guy still drives the hearse. Honestly! His car does look like a hearse. I bet the house is full of corpses. Probably does autopsies and taxidermy and stuff. Shut up, Theo. He might embalm you if he catches you. Shut up. Oh God. Another one. Don't everyone get under the table at once. That was awesome. That's got to be a 3.5, a four even. Really? We've been having them for months. Aucklanders ducked for cover last night as the latest in a... series of small earthquakes rattled the region. The Seismic Research Institute said today that the quake is... unlikely to be an indication of volcanic activity and have no cause for alarm. That's One Tree Hill. That's Mount... Krakatoa, Mount Vesuvius. Mount Etna, North Head... And Rangitoto, over there. I thought Auckland was supposed to be warm. Yeah, not so much. No. I'm going to check out the crater. Another one. Is he okay? I can't get through to him. It's like he's on another planet. On your way, boy. "Bleeding Skies". I know. I'm sorry. We will. I can't. I'm supposed to drive my cousins around. I know. I do want to. I promise. Theo? Bleeding Skies. Uncle Cliff... this stuff is disgusting. You'll see. They love it. Got something. -How am I looking? -Yeah, you're great. Stellar. Can you smell that? It's the same smell as the lake. It stinks. It's a hearse. Must be them. The Wilberforces. Well, don't open it. Theo! What is it? Gross. What are they doing here? Theo, are they watching us? Theo! Why don't you lock your door? Keep the light off, Ricky. Enjoying the view? Please... Just... call me when the school holidays are over. Text me? thanks a lot, Theo. Is she your girlfriend? -Have you...? -No. You think they're home? Theo, it's just a creepy old house. -Why don't we go check it out then? -No way. -Why not? -Because it's a creepy old house. Don't blame me if old Wilberforce keeps a shotgun under his bed or something. Theo! Don't go in there. I can do what I want. Ah, the gargantua. Come on. They shake the earth. Soon the gargantua are free. What is it? I smelled them. On the lake. Twins. Does the fire-raiser know? The fire-raiser watches the mountains, but his fire is dying. And if the twins find the fire-raiser? Then we make them dead. Soon, we make them all dead. -Are they gone? -Yeah. Down that hole. Come on. Let's go. We have to go. Where goes this go? Come on! Look! Why did you have to go into their house? No one asked you to come. We're supposed to be there for each other. Why? Because Dad says so? -We should tell someone. -No. But they're going to kill us. So? -You don't mean that. -Get off. Theo, please... Get the hell out of my head. Leave me! We need to know you're going to leave us alone. I feel so alone. We are alone. We feel so alone. Get used to it. It's him. The fire-raiser. Get up. I need a favour. Get lost, Theo. What would your old man say if he knew what you were doing in here last night? I wasn't doing anything, thanks to you. What do you want? Come on. What is it that you want, boy? That's you, right? -No, you're mistaken. -You're the fire-raiser. No, my name is Jones. But they call you that. The Wilberforces. I don't know anyone of that name. And I don't know you. Wait! They said they'd kill us. Me and my sister. You're twins. Yeah. And they've seen you, these Wilberforces? They could smell us. What is it? Where is your sister now? Our Aunt and Uncle's place. The lake. She's alone? At Lake Pupuke? Hey, get out of my car, old man! It's okay, he's with me. Well, he's not with me. -Do as you're told, son. Drive. -We have to go home. Half an hour ago, all you wanted to do was get out of there. -Who the hell are you? -Now, Ricky! Ricky? Ricky? Aunty Kay? Theo? Who is it? Police. Open the door. Please. Message for the twins. Been an accident. What? It's mother... Been hurt. But that's... not possible. Open the door. Why are you doing this to me? Open the door. Leave me alone! Open... the door! What, what is it? Help me! Help me! Lovely day. Bloody foreigners. Rach? Rachel? Theo! Rachel, what happened? -Rachel, are you okay? -We have to get her inside. -I'll call an ambulance. -No. No ambulance. Are you, are you a doctor now? Quiet please. Theo, This is crazy. Or maybe I'm crazy. Rest now For now, they think she's dead. It will buy us some time. We must leave. Ricky, can you drive us somewhere? No. I know another way. A way we won't be seen. Help me get her up. Over here. Now, put this on. What the hell? -Now you, Theo. -Theo. Some dodgy old man... no offence... wants to have a group hug and I'm supposed to be, like... Cover for us, okay? Hold on to me as tight as you can... And whatever you do, do not let go. I am in charge. No one is going anywhere. How did you do that? How did you do that? Inside. Inside. Now listen. And listen very carefully. I was not always what you see. You're right, Theo. I am the fire-raiser. And I am not of this world. Just as they are not of this world. They can take human form, but human they are not. What are they? The ones you call the Wilberforces were a predatory species. Merciless, cunning, greedy. Their hunger for power was great. All they lacked was the strength to conquer... until they met the gargantua. Gargantua? The gargantua are immense beings... with the power to lay waste to entire worlds. The Wilberforces tamed them and together they were unstoppable. They learned to travel through space... To make whole worlds their own. And they did it again and again. -To your world? -Yes. It was a catastrophe. But a few of us escaped and we gathered our strength... and we followed them here. And we imprisoned them under millions of tons of rock. -The volcanoes? -The volcanoes. The largest gargantua, the mother, under Rangitoto Island. Her children, under North Head, Mount Victoria... One Tree Hill, Mount Wellington... Lake Pupuke and Mount Eden. Seven Wilberforces. Seven gargantua... Seven volcanoes. But now the Wilberforces have freed themselves. And the gargantua will follow. Together they will make the Earth a festering wasteland... where only they can survive. -When? -Soon. Then... -Let's call the Army. -The New Zealand Army? No. The Wilberforces can only be defeated... with these. Rocks? These are weapons of a strength you can only begin to imagine. When we realised that the Wilberforces were waking up... we knew we had to destroy them. We captured the last of our fire within these stones. And my twin and I were chosen to wield them. Your twin? All of my people were twins. We shared everything. The journey here was hard on us both and my twin did not survive. My only hope was to find other twins who could use the stones. They must be thrown together into the crater of Rangitoto. The fire will be unleashed... the Wilberforces will perish and the seven gargantua will be destroyed. This alone can save your world. But only twin-ness can ignite the power. Twin-ness? Yes. You know what I'm talking about. Not all twins have it, but I think you do. But your twin-ness must be strong... for you to have any chance of defeating the Wilberforces. So... Theo... one of these is for you. This one. And this one is for you. Pick it up, Theo. It's heavy. Warm. Open to your mind to the stone. Feel its power. And let it feel yours. I saw other twins. Yes. They tried to use the stones. Many years ago. What happened to them? They failed. Now try yours. She looked really upset. He just dragged them inside. -And you, you saw them arrive. -Yes. Theo, if you believed in your twin-ness... Rachel would be able to hold her stone. She needs you. And you need her. Do you understand? You need to fix this. What are you so afraid of, Theo? Rach? I'm sorry. I'm sorry left you this morning. I thought I was going to die. I won't ever let that happen. Rach, I can take care of you. I can be strong enough for both of us. Is that what you think I want? It's them! It's alright. It seems these officers want a word with us at the station. I think we should do as they say. Theo, yours, I believe. Alright, son. You're not in trouble. We just want a word. All we're concerned about is that we don't know who this man is. Or what he wanted from you. He gave us these stones. They're weapons. Ah, please sit down. Theo? What's going on? We leave you for one day, you destroy the house. The front door is ruined. What are we going to do with you? We're going to the beach house. What? There won't be any trouble there for you to get into. We have to stay. Uncle Cliff, please. We realise you've been through a lot the last few months... but we can't watch you every second of the day. Especially if you're going to run off with complete strangers. He wasn't a stranger. Dad, I saw it. Rachel wasn't going to... And you are coming too. Bit of time without... cell phone coverage might be good for you. You know what? Sometimes you have no idea. Get an early night. We'll be off first thing. As soon as they're asleep I'm going to find Mr. Jones. What if Mr. Wilberforce comes? Then I'll deal to him. No passport, Driver's License or date of birth. Not even a Christian name. Frankly, Mr. Jones, we're puzzled as to just who you are. When did you first make contact with Rachel and Theo Matheson? They found me. But you didn't discourage them? Two impressionable teenagers... vulnerable, open to suggestion... They were a means to an end. Just like the others. Others? They were frail... weak. You all are. We all who? All you humans. I see. Without me, they'll be dead by morning. I think you should let me go. Come with me. Not your brother. Just you. Rach? Rachel? Rachel! Mr. Jones, wait. It's safe. They've gone to the mountains. Mr. Jones? Well. I have to leave now. Do you now? I suggest you get everyone out of the building. I'm tired. I don't know how many more times I can do this... And I don't know what will happen when I do. I don't think you're going anywhere, Mr. Jones. Now sit down. Mr. Jones? Mr. Jones? It was you. Rachel! Get back! I said, get back! You should not be... in my house. Theo, up here! Come on! Let her go! -How did you do that? -I don't know. They're locked. I found the fire-raiser! I'm going to stop you! Is that so? Did the fire-raiser tell you... what happened to... other twins? We... made them dead. The fire-raiser... observed them to die. He does... nothing. No. he wouldn't! Now you die. One will be enough. You, boy? Or give us your sister. No. No way. It must choose. Jump! -What? -Jump! there's more coming. there's no other way! -No, we can't! -Come on! Theo! Air-con must be on the blink. Gross. We have to find a way... out. That's a gargantua? There are seven of those? How are we supposed to fight that? this must be the one under the lake. They're coming. Over there! -You go first. -It could go anywhere. We can't stay here. Listen... some stuff's been going on... really crazy stuff. What stuff? What if I said... What? What if I said that the world was going to end? Maybe real soon. How soon? Maybe tonight. Then I'd say... we don't want to die without... Dirty old man! Oh, Ricky. He's coming over. I'll take care of it. The twins need your help. The twins are in bed. You're supposed to be in jail. They're out there somewhere. Give me ten minutes. If they die. We all die. Five? Ricky, what's going on? I have to go. But then I am going to come back. Come on! Oh, it's a dead end. It doesn't make sense. A tunnel's got to go somewhere. Water. Salt water. I'll help you up. Take a deep breath... Then kick as hard as you can. Okay, ready? Swim! Rach! Come on. Nowhere to run. Mmm. Theo! Rachel! Theo! -Ricky! -Here! Get in! Go! Go! Go! Drive, Ricky. Drive. The twin learns. It burns us. Does it lean enough? Find them. Make them dead. No more twin smell. Wait! Make it hurt. I did it. I made the fire. They were scared. I thought that's what you wanted. You've shown them what you could do. Now they won't rest until you're dead. Now you must destroy them before they destroy you. What do you mean? We're going to the mountain tonight. Ricky... Get us as close to Rangitoto as you can. What's this? Tunnels from the war. In case Australia invaded. Or the Russians, or something. Are you okay? We need to get to the mountain. Can't you just flame on or...? No. That takes fire. And mine is dying. Another journey would kill me. Okay. Meet me in an hour. Down by the rocks. What, the boat? Uncle Cliff will never let you. Like I'm going to ask. If the Wilberforces find out what you're doing, they'll kill you. Reckon I'm more scared of Dad. -Be careful, Ricky. -You too. Be quick. We can't hide here for long. Come on. Come on. From now on, you do exactly as I say. -No way. -What? You lied about the other twins. I told you. They failed. Pretty hard to throw a stone when you're dead. Mr. Jones? If I'd told you the truth... you wouldn't have done what I asked. What happened? Their names were Johan and Lenart. I'd been searching for so long, hoping to find what they had - a bond. They gave me hope. I thought we could destroy the Wilberforces... before they broke free. I was wrong. Johan! Johan! Mr. Jones! Help us! Please help us, Mr. Jones! Please! You just left them there. I had no choice. They had Johan. Lenart alone was useless to me. If I'd risked myself to save them, who would've been left to find more twins? You don't need twins. I can make enough fire for both of us. Rachel believes in your twin-ness. It is her belief that gives you power. But at the beach they were afraid of me. -You were weak. -No. They were afraid. Only because she believes! You're wrong, old man. I'll prove it. Theo? Come back. We have to throw the stones together. I need you. I need you, Theo. I need your help. There's no one else I can trust. Is this that end of the world thing? 'Cause, I've got work in the morning. Please. I'll explain on the way. Mr. Jones? Mr. Jones? He's gone on ahead. we have to get to the boat. They've found us. What? Where are you going? would you believe night fishing? Get out of the car. I know this doesn't look good, but I'm asking you just to trust... Get out of the car. Dad, you're going to have to trust me. If I say I've got something important to do, it's important. Dad? Get out of the car. Take the wheel! Tell me that wasn't actually your Dad. This way. This way. Stand back! -How am I looking? -Okay. Okay, go! -I didn't know you could drive a boat! -How hard can it be? Sorry. Sorry, there's a... you've got to balance. Go! Go! Go! End of the road, losers. Where are they going? They're going to the island. To wait for us. Theo! Come closer. Ricky. You're going to have to jump. -Where are the others? -They're not coming. -What? -I'm going alone. -Now Ricky! -Yeah. Yeah. Watch out. They're waiting for you. They've left us! We won't go far. Rach! Be careful. You too. Listen! They're hunting him. Then help him! It's too late. I told you alone. He's nothing. Take me to him now. No. Your brother is already as good as dead. And if I take you, it'll kill me. They'll kill you too. Maybe those other twins would have made it if you'd stayed. If you'd helped them instead of saving yourself. You can go find more twins if you want. But I don't get a choice. I'll die before I turn my back on him. Wait! I'll take you. I'll take you now. Mr. Jones! -He's here. -Theo? Rachel... Rachel, take this. Take it! Remember, your belief is your strength. Hold on, for Theo. Hurry, Theo. Now you run. Not this time. Then I will observe you to die. Then twins die. If they have to die... let them die together. I will make sure of it. Rachel! Put her down! No! Rachel? The gargantua rise. It's twin dies. How does it feel? I'm alone. Rachel... I need you. Rachel, I need you. Rachel, I need you. Theo? I'm here... Rachel. I'm here... I'm here. Cliff! Cliff! Mr. Jones? Where's Mr. Jones? Dead. Gone. He's dead. What do we do now...? I've got to go up there. I got to go up there. Just be careful Ricky! Did we do it? You did it? -I knew you were coming back. -That went off really well. We should get off the volcano. You and me have some unfinished business, mister. I was wrong... about Mr. Jones. I was wrong about everything. Let's go home. With all this going on... I don't think Dad's even going to notice the boat's missing.
