 

                        My best friend Lily thought she was drowning. Drowning in the Salton Sea. Even though the water was tau polluted to step foot in and left everything in our town either dying or dead. Lily? Are you okay? Hello? Lily was determined to never let it get her. I'll see you later, okay'? Hey, Aunt Bonnie! Good morning. You're like a fucking tornado, kid. You know that'? There's my poor little cousin. You're late. Did you get my cigs'? Yeah. These come open now'? Hey, handsome. Shh. Shh. You trying to burp him or break his neck? God, I really can't do anything right today. Well, I don't want him ending up with shaken kid syndrome. I might be doing him a favor. What does that mean'? Huh? You want this'? Hmm? Yeah, yum. Look at the cartoons. What's happening? Look, he's thinking about a bird. He's flying like a bird. Can you do that'? Wham Lily. Get off your ass and grab your uncle's Epsom salts. I got to go help out your mama, little one. Lily You wanna hand me the salt'? Sorry. Hogan says the fish don't die from pollution, because when the algae blooms, it sucks up all the oxygen. And then the fish suffocate. That's boring. I don't think so. You're such a baby. I'm two months older than you. The train's coming. Come on. What are you doing? Is baby scared'? Do you want mommy to sing you your song'? Cut it out. Hush little baby, don't say- Stop it! Come here. No. Mommy's gonna buy you a mockingbird Cut it out. And if that mockingbird don't sing mommy's gonna buy you a...? Lily, is that you? Yeah. Oh, hey, Ali, how are you'? Good. Ifs Alison, Mom. We're not, like, five years old anymore. I didn't realize you guys were so grown up now. She's staying for dinner too. Oh, actually, I was gonna go cook my dad dinner. Oh, how is your dad'? Oh, he's good. He found some copper wire... Have you seen my black pumps? Are they up your ass'? No, Lily, I don't believe they are up my ass. You're such a spazz. You interrupted Alison. I'm sorry, Ali. That's fine. It's Alison, Mom. Alison. Your dad found some wires? I was just trying to say he's good. Same as always. That's good. Well, tell him I say hi. Yeah. Was that so hard'? Since when did you become Miss Manners'? For once someone's gotta be civilized in this house. Why don't you help me find my shoes? So I'm going to go meet some friends at the bar. And don't forget, we have your appointment tomorrow. Fuck. And we can't cancel because I lose money every time we don't cancel 24 hours in advance. It's such a waste of time, Mom. Don't say that. You need to talk to someone, kiddo. You need to. And you're surely not talking to me. I talk to you every day. I just want to understand why you did it. Did what, Mother'? You know what. I'm sorry, Mother, but I surely don't. Why did you out your leg'? I was shaving. I guess I'm just not that good at it yet. Okay, your appointment is tomorrow at 10. I got you something'. Yeah? Ifs in your room. Thanks. Hey! Does this look okay'? I have to get ready. Can you give me some space to fucking pee by myself, please? You know, stop saying the word "fuck" so much. You sound... Well, then will you give me some privacy, Mom'? I'm just asking, does this look cute'? I don't know. I don't know. Does this dress look cute'? You look old! You should take down your hair. You seem bored. I don't understand why I'm being punished. What makes you think you're being punished? I'm here, aren't I'? Well, what would you rather be doing instead of sitting here with me'? I don't know. Shooting myself in the face'? Dousing myself with gasoline and lighting a match. Ifs funny how you often mention hurting yourself. Thanks. I thought I was funny, too. No, I guess I meant ironic. But with your father and all, it's interesting. Your mom's interesting too. I'm curious about the structure she provides. Have you seen any drug use'? Does she have a boyfriend? I'm trying to help, Lily. Why do you think you cut your legs? Why don't you just out it off'? Cut what out'? Cut it off. Off'? Yeah, the hair on your face. Are you talking about my mole'? That fucking gross thing on your chin. We're here to talk about you, Lily. How am I supposed to talk when I feel like I'm gonna barf'? How'd it go'? Yeah, it was great. I think it's really starting to help. Do ever feel like you're going to die'? Like in a car crash? Yeah. Like... I don't know. Like the seaweed Hogan was talking about. Algae. I feel like somethings stealing all my air. That's messed up. Hey! Cut the shit! It ain't yours. So, it ain't yours neither, and I hope it bites your face off. I hope he bites your tits off. Stupid fucker! You touch that dog again and I'll burn down your fucking welfare ass trailer. They took the baby for the day. They took Mark for the day. Probably going to parade him around the neighborhood. Our son, the war hero. He is a war hero. Great. Give me his medal in one hand and shit in the other. See what I got. Fuck. That whole table there is 40 percent off for just today. Thanks. Till death do you part, right'? Mark died the day some sand nigger buried an IED in a garbage can. What they sent home... I don't know what that is, but ifs not my husband. Did you get lipstick all over me'? Look, it's the Bobbsey Twins. Aw, they're like a little cartoon duo. Lily and Ali and the case of the haunted mansion. She doesn't want to be called Ali anymore. What does she wanna be called? Alison. Oh, excuse me. Lily and Alison in the case of the haunted mansion. Jesus Christ. Come sit next to your old mom. I've got a mystery for you. Who's shit-faced at two o'clock in the afternoon? Guilty as charged, Scooby Doo. That's right. Yeah! You look cute. Maybe you should do something with this hair, though. Like put a deep conditioner on it or something. Wow. You know what'? You should do something with your face, okay'? That's not nice. Can we dress up'? No, I have to sell this stuff. Why? You can use the things over there. No, I wanna use this stuff. Don't use the feather thing. Why? it's the best one. Can I wear the skirt at least'? Yeah. At least that one picked something normal. Look, I want to look like a fuzzy alien. At your service, my fearless queen. Lily! Lily! My fearless queen, don't you dare! I'm going to push you in the water. Yes! Yes! No! No! No! I'm melting. Oh no! Don't die. Ifs too late. Here. Don't you ever forget me. Then, I'll put one on. What's that sound? I don't know. Let's investigate. My queen, you are alive! Shh! You look stupid. You guys want some beers'? Sure. Climb over then. Lily)'- What, are you, like a raver or something? What's that'? Somebody who dresses all crazy. No, it was just this stupid thing. I like your boots. Yeah? Yeah, I think they're cool. Thanks. You know, you can't find empty pools like this in L.A. no more. We heard about this spot and drove all the way out. But your town smells like shit. Ifs the salt influx from the sewage and irrigation runoff. Are you a scientist? No. See all this white stuff'? The sand'? It's not really sand. it's dead fish and bird bones. Cool. Yeah. So, you have a boyfriend? Jesse, let's fucking go! You cold? What the fuck? Let's go. Thanks. Sorry. If you're ever in L.A. Sorry. Bye, Lily. Bye. Woo! Where'd you go? Didn't think you'd notice I'd left. What's up your ass'? Nothing. I kissed that boy. Yeah? Yeah. I bet he's kissed lots of other girls. Maybe. We're gonna hang out in L.A. How are you getting there'? I don't know. You can come along if you want. Maybe. Hey, Tiger Lily. I know you're awake. Why do you always have to touch me'? Because I didn't get to hold you for that whole first month you were born. You were stuck in the incubator. Your dad said that you looked like a little chicken who came out of the oven too early. Mom. Please, Mom. Lily, what are you doing here? I figured it out. We're gonna take Hogan's truck to L.A. No way. He's never gonna notice. It just, like, sits here all the time. Shh. Hey, Lily. You here to unload some hay'? No. Well, I hear worlds good for the soul. My soul's beyond repair. Think about it. I see that charm school is really paying off. She don't mean it. She just doesn't like living here. Well, one day she'll realize ifs just geography. Where's the furthest you've ever been? Bora Bora Bora Bora. No way. I found work on a freighter. We docked there and I decided to stay. Was it amazing? I got a job at a resort where this mangy dog and her pup would hang around begging for food. The guest complained, so the manager sent me and this other guy, just a local, out to get 'em. The mother, she trusted humans, so she was easy. But her pup, she was a slippery little sucker. We couldn't get her no matter how hard we tried. We were supposed to take her out to the bigger island, about a 20-minute boat ride. My co-worker wanted to get home for dinner, though. His wife was making a Poisson Cru. So he threw the dog off the boat about halfway there. Oh, my God! That night the whole island could hear that pup howling and crying for its mother. I traveled halfway across the world to find out that people are dumb and cruel everywhere. I could've just stayed home. I went to Aunt Bonnie's. You weren't there. Did you change your mind'? I can't, Lily. I can't do that to Hogan. Fine. What's so great about L.A. anyway? Ifs not here. Where are you going? I don't know. Can I come'? No. You're ugly. So'? So don't go walking around here acting like you better than everybody else. I don't. You told my brother you was going to burn down my house? No. Liar. I'm gonna ask your ass again. Did you tell my brother you was gonna burn down my house? Don't look at that cunt. Look at me! Look at me. No, I didn't say that. Next time I see you I'm gonna stab you in your little frizzled head. Thanks a lot. What was I supposed to do'? I'm leaving tonight. How? I'll wait by the bar and get some trucker or methhead to drive me. Are you stupid? That'll get you dead in a ditch somewhere. Yeah, well,if I stay here, Shawna's just gonna kill me anyway, so, what's the fucking difference? I knew you'd come through. You're my best friend, stupid. Fuck you! Woo! What the fuck? it's fine. Did you just fall asleep? Ifs three in the morning. You're such a baby. Fine, Lily, why don't you drive? Oh wait, nobody taught you how. You don't have to be a bitch about it. I'm sorry. Let's just pull over and sleep for a while. Do you remember when we thought that your mom was gonna marry my dad and we were gonna be sisters for real'? Yeah. Then we realized that your dad's, like, and super ugly. You're just upset because we saw Darryl Baker's father coming out of your mom's room in his underwear. Oh, you cried. You cried so hard thinking that Darryl was gonna be your brother instead. Yeah, my mom was gonna marry your dad. And we were gonna move to the beach. A real beach with a real ocean. And every morning we would wake up and roll out of bed and dive straight into the water. Yeah. Hey- Hey" So Jesse said we're not far out. Woo-hoe. He gave me an address for where we got to meet them. Hey, where'd you get those chips? I bought them. But I thought you didn't have any money. Fine. Whatever. I stole them. Sue me. Lily. What'? Who cares, huh'? Something for you anyway. Hypocrite. Hey, I'm just kidding. Where are you going? To pay for these. No, if you pay for them, they're gonna know I took them. For the first time in your life, could you just not be a baby'? No fucking way. No. God damn it. Your friend send you back for more'? No, I was just putting it back. Do I look that fucking stupid'? No! I'm sorry, okay'? We're gonna wait right here for the police. No, please let me go. You and your little girlfriend come in here thinking the sun shines out your asses. Well, I got a rude awakening for you, all right'? This is a citizen's arrest. Stand back! Ow! Lily! Rum What {he hell are you doing? Don't! Fucking, drive! Come back here! Go, go, go! Come on! Shit. Fucking bitches! That's not funny! "This is a citizen's arrest." It's a little funny. Hey, there they are! Look! Pull over. Pull over. Come on. I'm going. I'm going. Pull over. I'm going. Where am I supposed to park'? Lily, where am I supposed to park'? Lily! Hey. Where's Jesse? Ifs Lily. From the pool. He said he don't want to see you. What'? He said to go back to wherever the hell you came from. Why'? What did I do'? Yo, we're just playing'. He's there with the homeless dude gettin' booze. Yeah, I'll keep you safe till he gets back, what do you think'? Yeah? No. Where's your ugly friend? She's not ugly. She ain't pretty. Lily? Hi. Hi. Dickhead, you trying to get busted'? Let's not stand in the middle of the fucking street with beer. Huh'? Use your fucking head. What do you think'? Jesus. What's going on'? Just drive. Let's go. Take a left. Yo, so there are, like, a bunch of Wildcats up here like fucking cougars and shit like that. They fucking are eating people, like, all the time. No way. I don't believe you. That's bullshit. I swear. I swear. David. What'? No, man. They all died in the wildfires. You know that. You're fucking full of shit. He's just trying to spit game... That's really awful. Like, a wildfire? Like... Yeah, you know, ifs crazy. Me and David, after the last fire, we snuck up here. But you gotta be really careful because there's firemen and police and you gotta sneak in. And then when you get up here, there's nothing but charred rabbits and fucking coyotes. Then there was the fucking deer tree. There was this tree somewhere. I don't remember where we were, but there's this deer just strung up... it was in the tree'? I don't know, he must've had his antlers stuck in a branch when he was trying to outrun the flames or something. But when we found him there was nothing left. He was, like, just charred meat and skeleton... Okay, we get the picture. Okay, we get it. It was awful. No, it's awesome. That's reality. Living's hard. Especially around here. Living's hard everywhere. Oh, wise one, do you have any other pearls of wisdom for us today'? Screw you. No thanks. I like girls. Okay. Okay. I'm serious. Okay. Be nice to Lily's friend. Okay. Let's be friends. Shut the fuck up and do what you're told. Wait. Where are you going? To piss. You want to hold my dick'? I like him. I know you do. Are you drunk'? I don't know. I'm, like, totally fucked up right now. Be careful. Of what'? I fucking love it here. My bad. Excuse me. Hey, watch where the fuck you're going. Lily. Wow, there's no reason to be a bitch. Fuck you. Lily. Okay, tough guy, have a nice life. What's up'? Hi. What happened? Nothing. Nothing happened. This guy called me a bitch. Did you call my friend a bitch? Listen, I don't got a problem with you. Well, maybe I got a problem with you. If I offended anyone, it was my mistake. And I'm sorry. Okay, but you don't need to apologize to us. You need to apologize to the girls. I'm sorry. Oh shit! Gimme this bag, mother fucker. Run! You okay? Run! Yo. Come on. Come on. Hurry UP- Jesus. What is this place? This is where we live. This is cool. Yeah, it's sick. David even tapped into the power. You guys don't get in trouble for staying here? No, every once in a while you gotta come through and kick some fucking homeless people out, but... Yeah, they poop in the hallways. That's gross. Okay, so we got a laptop, a calculator, and a bunch of books. Probably get, like, a grand on Craigslist for the computer? Yeah, but that guy probably needs it for school or something, right'? Golly gee willakers, she's right. We should probably turn it into the lost and found. Actually, the next time we wanna hear from the my bitty titty committee, we'll be sure to ask. my bitty fifty committee. Are you gonna make outwith Louis? What'? No. I think you should hook up with him. Why'? I don't wanna be the only one. Then why don't you either? Can you just try to have fun'? For once? For me'? I think you're pretty. Really? Kinda. I have to go to the bathroom. I have to go to the bathroom. Hey, I hope you didn't drop a deuce. The plumbing don't work. Where are we going? I wanna show you something. Hey, where did you go'? Jesse? Home sweet home. This is your house? It used to be. Where's your family? Moved to Arizona about six months ago. Are you rich? If we were rich, we would still live here. So then out of the blue my dad says we're moving to Scottsdale. And we're staying with my grandparents. And they told me that I wasn't allowed to take King. Who's King'? King was... this big dumb... fat, and he's completely retarded, he was this big, fat, ginger cat that I had, you know, since I was, like, five years old. He was cool. But he got kinda sick, so he needed, like, a lot of medication and stuff. So one day my dad drove him to the animal shelter while my mom and my sister packed up the house. And then it was just like that. We were, we were up and gone. I bet he ended up going home with a really great family. Or he's dead, put to sleep. You know, I stayed, like, in Scottsdale for about a month. Close to a month, and I couldn't take it. So I snuck out one night and hopped on a bus and I came back here. Aren't they, like, freaking out looking for you'? Yeah, probably. Fuck it, you know? Now they got one less mouth to feed. I'm-can you do me a favor and please don't tell the other guys about this place, okay'? Why'? You should all live here instead of that nasty motel. No, they'd just come and trash it. I mean this is still my home. Okay. Here. Get it. Hello? Is that them'? Hello? What'd they say'? Nobody there. They hung UP- Hello? I'm sorry, Hogan. Look, I swear I'm gonna bring your truck back without a scratch on it, I promise. Oh hell, I don't care about that truck. I care a little about that truck. I care a whole lot more about you getting home without a scratch. How's Lily'? She's okay. We're both okay. I don't know. I don't know anything anymore. Well, they say if you're not confused that means you're not thinking enough. I'm sorry, Hogan. Now, now, hey, hey, hey. So what kind of trail of murder and mayhem have you two left'? Not too bad. Really? No harm, no foul, right? You just come home. You got people here worried about you. Okay. It's time to come home. BYE, Hogan. Hey, come on. You sure you wanna do this'? 'Cause we don't have to. I know. I want to. What is that'? Ifs nothing. Are they scars'? Uh-huh. What happened? I don't know. I got bored. Did it hurt'? No. I'm sorry. Maybe we should just wait anyway, you know? Whatever. ...foreclosures now. Oh, shit! They're ripping up the carpet and faucets. I don't know. That's disgusting. Seriously, that's gross. Really. I'm not sure how I feel about... and we'll probably have to blast out these walls to make room for the nursery. The kids could always live in the backyard. What do you think you're doing? Maybe make a shed for them or something. Excuse me. Yo, you gotta check this out. Thick uncut cock ready to unload. What are you talking about'? Young sexy couple looking for a kinky girl. I really don't wanna look at porn with you guys. It's no! porn. It's this website where people put these personal ads and they meet up and fuck. Any ladies in need of some big black dick this morning? Yes, please. Who the fuck is Tina'? Everybody's looking for her. It's crystal meth, idiot. All this shit is drugs, like party favors, snow, powder. We're gonna write one. Why'? We're gonna lure some pervert back here and rob him. How exactly do you plan on doing that'? No. Come an. We'll be right in the bathroom hiding. She says the code word, fucking... We jump out. Yeah, and then what happens when she gets hurt'? How'? We're right there. Okay, then, what happens when they call the police? Oh, you think he's gonna call the fucking police? "Yes, Officer, I was about to have sex with this underage girl and then some hooligans jumped out and robbed me." Fuck that. Yeah, fuck that. Shut the fuck up, Louis. Shut the fuck up, Louis. Come an. I don't know, man. See, everybody always wants to be down and when shit gets real... No, look, I'm just sayin'... Yeah, you're just saying you're a fucking pussy. What about you'? What do you say'? Okay. Thank you. Fuck. Some nuts, finally. Young, white girl looking for my big daddy. That's gross. Must be white and very generous. Hi. Hi. Come find Alison with me. Shit. I keep losing the connection. Please? Come on. Yeah, we're gonna go look for Alison. Holy shit! What'? Look, dude, look at all of these responses. Come on, come on. Get up, get up. I'll be your daddy. Sugar daddy here. What can Daddy for you'? Oh! Oh! Dude just sent a picture of his dick. Oh my God, I'm going to throw up. What about this guy? I don't know, he looks nice. Yeah, no, he does. You guys are pathetic. This guy's a piece of shit. He looks nice? What the hell's the matter with you people? What'? We're going to rob a perv. Come see. Lily? This is so stupid. She could be abducted. She'll be fine. This feels like a surprise party. Where are we going? My car is back there. I just gotta grab my stuff. You live back here? Yeah, just for now. Are you a runaway? I guess. Well, does anyone know where you are'? You do. This is taking too long. Shut up. Sorry. Nice little setup you got. I like it. Looks like the bed's seen some use. Did you bring money? Maybe. How generous would you like me to be'? I like your eyes. Surprise! Whoa. Very generous motherfucker. We were just talking. I don't give a fuck. Give me your money, you fucking pervert. Okay. Okay. Let's all relax. No. How about I leave and we pretend this never happened? Yeah, go and get the fuck out of here! Get the fuck back! Whoa, hey! Look, relax, man. We got his money. Just let him go. I know you got a phone. Give me your phone. No, ifs a Blackberry. I don't give a fuck, motherfucker. Here. I'm gonna assume that somewhere in that phone there's a number that says "home" and at said home there's a woman who would be less than pleased to find out her husband was trying to fuck a 15-year-old girl. I'm sorry. Shut the fuck up! So when I ask you for the PIN number I assume you're telling the truth. Otherwise, I'll have to call your wife and ask her for it. Seven, four... Speak! Seven, four, nine, four. Is that your final answer? Yes. Yes. Michael Kenneth White. Glendale, California. Yes. Get the fuck out of here. Go. Go. Holy shit! That was such... a fucking rush. Is that your final answer? Fuck! What the hell? You never said anything about a gun. I didn't realize I had to clear it with you. Can I hold it'? Lily, be careful. You're such a baby. Yeah, well, I know a lot more about guns than you. I shoot with Hogan all the time. What the fuck's a Hogan? It's Alison's Big Daddy. Screw you, Lily. Careful. it's not a toy. Let's go get some fucking shit. Fuck yeah. What if he had hurt that guy'? He didn't. No, I know, but what if he had'? Ifs not a big deal. We have to go back. What'? No. Not yet. Okay, when? I just want to spend some more time with Jesse. We'll go back tonight, okay'? Promise? Sure. No, you have to promise me, Lily. Okay. Don't spazz out. Oh, shit. The only time they put the jump man on anything other than Jordan was the P-Rod collaboration. How do you know? Well, because I'm not some stupid fucking spic who doesn't know jack shit about sneakers like you. I got you something. What now'? We are gonna go buy more sneakers. If we don't do our part, the terrorists will have won. Come on, Alison. Louis, I can physically hear you developing diabetes. I'd rather have diabetes than drink diet soda and get rectal cancer. Alison's mom died of cancer. Lily! What? it's true. Yeah, but it's none of their business. I don't go around talking about your dad. What'? That he killed himself? Wow. Everybody knows now. I guess I should totally freak out. How'd he do it'? A gun. That's so fucking cool. Shit, if I was gonna kill myself I'd use a gun, too. or jump off a big ass bridge. Yeah, I hear when you jump off a bridge you fall and you die on impact when you hit the water. The bridge gotta be high, though. Thank you, Louis. That's very enlightening. Of course ifs gotta be fucking high, otherwise you'd just hit the water and drown. I hear drowning's a really beautiful way to die. It's really peaceful. Who told you that'? I don't know. I read it. How the fuck would they know? They obviously didn't drown if they wrote it in a book. Well, maybe they, like, maybe, like, almost drowned. No. No. No. Yeah. Why? Maybe someone came and saved them. No, but that ain't drowning. Like... what if almost drowning was all peaceful and shit like those last few minutes of actually drowning is fucking horrible. I mean, how fucking pissed would you be'? You're fucking, like, expecting rainbows and fucking angels and shit... and it's just this total fucking horror. Sweet. Okay. You're meeting' your next guy in 20 minutes. What do you mean? What do you mean what do I mean'? Did I stutter'? Well, you already got a bunch of stuff today. Yeah, and now we're gonna get a bunch more stuff. So you can either shut the fuck up or get the fuck out. 'cause you've been a stupid fucking cunt since you got here. Good. Come on, Lily, let's go. Let's go. Come on. We're gonna go. Good riddance, bitch. Hey! What are you doing? I'm going home, Lily. Sorry. Why do you have to ruin everything? I'm not ruining anything. I just don't even recognize you anymore. That's because for the first time in my entire life, I'm really happy. Good for you. Let's go. Let's go home. I'm not fucking leaving Jesse. He doesn't care about you, Lily! You're just some stupid girl to him. We're moving in together. What'? Into his parents' place. What'? They're gonna let us live there. Ifs huge. Ifs got a pool and everything. Right. Mm-hmm. What about your mom, Lily'? Now she'll have one less mouth to feed. What are you talking about'? You know what, Alison? You should go back to the Salton Sea. You belong there. Don't say that. Things are different now. No, they're not! Lily, nothing has changed! Nothing! Maybe not for you, but they have for me. You're supposed to be my best friend. Who the fuck else was I supposed to hang out with, huh'? You were it. Fuck you. Are you Lily'? Yeah. I wasn't sure I was gonna find the place. I came out from Whittier. Passed by a couple times to make sure there weren't any cops. You're not a cop, are you'? No. Yeah. No, you look too young. You're like a kid, huh'? No, I'm 18. Okay. Want something to eat or anything? I'm not really hungry. Do you just want to go'? I'm not hungry either. Go'? Yeah, let's do it. Cool. Where are we going? I'm staying in a motel just up here. Oh, good. Hey, do you have a cigarette? No. Oh, sorry. I'm a little wired. Do you party'? Ifs right up here. Oh, cool. You staying in here? Yeah. I don't know, I smell a trap. What are you talking about'? I don't know. I don't know. What's wrong? I'm going to go in there and your big black boyfriend is going to bash me in the head with a pipe. No. Yeah? Come on. Ow! You gotta promise me. What'? Promise me that I'm not gonna get my head bashed in by some nigger if I go in there. Okay. 'Cause I couldn't handle that. I couldn't fucking handle that. Okay. I promise. Okay'? All right, I promise. My room's right over here. Okay. You sure you're all alone in here? Yeah. I'm sorry, you know, ifs just that... something seems too good to be true... Whats in there? it's nothing. It's just the bathroom. You don't get scared here all by yourself? Take your clothes off. I want to see what I'm getting into. What the fuck'? I like your eyes. Mother fucker! Give me your fucking money! Give me your fucking money! Oh, I knew it. Give me your money! You're a liar! Shut the fuck up and empty your pockets. You gonna shoot me'? You gonna shoot me'? Shut the fuck up and empty your pockets. Oh, you're gonna shoot me. Shut up and give me your money. Shut the fuck up! Give me the money! What the fuck are you doing? Do it. Do it. What the fuck is wrong with you'? He's a fucking psycho. Hey. Look man, we don't wanna fucking hurt you, okay'? So just get the fuck outta here. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Well, get the fuck outta here, man! Come on. Hey, Stop! Stop! Get off him! Stop! No! No! We're sorry. Please. We're sorry. You're just a bunch of fucking kids screwing around. You're just a bunch of fucking kids, huh'? Cut it out, please. You're just a bunch of fucking kids, huh'? Oh! Oh, why didn't you do it when you had the chance, and it was right in me'? Jesse! Is that what you wanted? A little party'? Huh'? You only get a little time between a cut and knowing how deep if is. If it's gonna leave you nicked or disfigured forever. All you can do is try to stretch nut that moment for as long as you possibly can. Cause once you know... there ain't no coming back.
