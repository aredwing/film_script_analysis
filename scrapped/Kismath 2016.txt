It's true that he's my brother: But he's crazy. First a long time he was obsessed music albums the bikes.. And now it's you. For God's sake, get out of it while you still can. He's fickle. I know! I am sister. But, you don't worry. You still have time. You don't worry about anything else lrfan, please ponder over what I just said. You please sit down. What is your name? Anitha. Anitha! You should ask him and try understand what I've told him, 0k? Cheer up, son. Selena, come let's go. Don't tell him about what I just said to you, he's crazy. Are you going to the mosque now? Anitha, you need to act your age now. The boy doesn't love you. They just need more people in their religion, - - especially they want lower castes from our religion. For that, they are even getting foreign funds. Did you understand what Ganesh said? You come with us. We have arrived at a decision. What decision? We have found an apt suitor for you. So you have found someone else? I've also seen many, but they wanted something else from me! Irfan is only guy I found different. I will not allow you to live your life as per you wish. Not while I am alive! Do you understand! I will not leave ln'an. I'll only live with him. All these years, you took decisions for me. It's time for me to decide now. I will not allow all this nonsense here. Get out! I know your intention... Ganesh, take him out! Chandra come. From now, you are dead to me! Do you understand? Leave me! Go on! Serve her sweets for what she has done!! Chandra, Come, we'll son it out. Why did he lock the door? What are they up to in there? What are we going to do now? What? Nothing. I came to tell her something. You both need to loosen up a bit. He will marry you for sure. People are trying to talk sense into his father. He'll agree. Do you really think he's going to agree? Can you just keep quiet. Look at you. 'kNhat do you have for yourself? Do you have the nerve to stand up to your brother and father? So, first you keep a level head. Look at me. There is a slim chance that you might have to convert to Islam. It's ok right? I have told your father everything on our way here. He understands. Now, you please come with us. In'an, please listen to us I will give it to him. Here, its mother. She wants to say something. Mother. In'an, my baby! Please listen to your uncle. Don't be afraid. Father has agreed to everything. Are you listening? Yes mother. They have talked things out. Everything will be alright. Please come home. You give that to me. What will Anitha do? KT will tell her everything. Now, it's not safe to move her to another place. Her family might cause trouble there, too. Why don't we take her to a rescue home? She'll be under police vigil there. But, Anitha should insist that she would only go to a rescue home. Tomorrow is Sunday. We can settle everything on Monday. You have to take the final call. First you please let her go and then I will come. Don't you trust me? It's not than. I don't trust policemen. Don't worry. You go tell her. You go with them. Mother has promised. Isn't it best that you go to the rescue home? You'd be safe there ln'an, can we ever live together? Of course we can. I'm there for you. Look at me. Even if they resist, I'll come for you. Abu might have told you everything. Your mother is crying her heart out, for you. Selena and me are leaving. You come with Khaleel. We'll talk the rest once we reach home. I shouldn't go right? Everything is going to be fine. You should go. You should go. I will come back for you. So, he went with his family. What is your plan now? Call Chandran and ask him to take her home. No sir. I don't want to go home. Where else would you go? I will go to the rescue home. We will decide where you go, not you. You are not going to any rescue home. Call Chandan right now and ask him to take her home. Sit there. Hello ln'an! Things are not panning out the way we expected. They are planning to send me home. Don't go home. Don't listen to them I'll come right away. Don't panic. We are in the car. Brother turn the car. They are planning to take her home. I have told them. She should be heading home now. That is not what we decided. Decisions keep changing. Are we supposed to dance to your tunes. Shut up and stay quiet! Stop the car. No, I won't stop the car. Ali, take his phone. Give me back my phone. Go to hell! Sir, that's not going to happen. Chandran has made clear that they have nothing to do with her, anymore. Now, she's going to be a headache for us Take her to the rescue home. Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother has gone to Abu's house. Why? Because I felt so! To get out of here, you need her, right? You won't step outside of this house again. So, you where making a fool out of me? What did you think that we were gonna marry her to you! In'an, your father is a reputed person in society. Please don't ruin it. This relationship is not meant for you. She is of a different religion and different caste. Besides, she's elder to you. Please forget about it. Is it her fault that she was born into that religion? And is it my virtue that I am born into this religion? Khadija was 15 year older than Mohammed Nabi when they got married. I cannot forget her. I won't create any trouble or spoil your name. I promise. We will go some place far. You are going no where! Didn't you hear what father said. I am going to get her out of there. Come here! W Anitha come with you'? I think she'll. I have never stopped her from doing anything. The day he comes to get her, I'll marry her off to him. Look at you dear. Haven't I told you a million times not to get smitten by love? Look at me. I am going to be single and happy till I die. Anitha, you go with your aunt. Don't be sad, everything will be alright. No aunty, my brother will come there too. I just don't care two hoots. He doesn't have the guts to come in front of me. Come with me. Now, shed your long face and go. You go with her. Anitha, you forgot your phone. I am leaving. What's happening there? You give that inside. Get the ambulance ready, Postmortem is over. What is your son's name? I rfan. Who found the body first? Take your time I guess you are happy now! Stop the vehicle. What happened? Man is standing there. Did you see ln'an? He hasn't come here since two days. I saw his bike there. What happened? Nothing.
