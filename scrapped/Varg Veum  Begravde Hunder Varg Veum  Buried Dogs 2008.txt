 

                        Now the Adu case. The charges against the police officers have been dropped. 18 year old Mikael Adu died after his arrest in Bergen last August. Police methods were criticized. Party leadership candidate Einar Bergene sees this as a victory for law and order. This has been very tough on the three officers. They were pre-condemned, accused... This inquiry shows they only performed their job well. An 18 year old died. Is that to 'a job well done'? We have to realise society has changed. The police often has to face violent individuals. Einar Bergene's comments since the case was dropped meet vivid criticism. Last night over 3000 people took part in protest marches in Oslo and Bergen. In Bergen the march developed into violent riots. Around hundred arrests were made. Marit Haug, was this a 'job well done'? No, it wasn't. Bergene is not representative for our politics. Will this make you win? Let's hope so! BURIED DOGS A free adaptation of Gunnar Staalesen's novel Deputy party leader Einar Bergene hails Adu's arrest by the police as 'a job well done'. Mikael Adu died during the arrest. Einar Bergene's remarks have stirred up a storm of protest. Party leader Kristian Fredriksen and the second deputy leader, Marit Haug, have not made any comments so far. Party leader Kristian Fredriksen's dilemma is that he cannot reject Einar Bergene without alienating an important part of his electorate. At the same time this type of remark is totally incompatible with the party's wish to enter government after next year's general election. And Marit Haug, what are her chances? - Varg Veum? - Yes? I'm Marit Haug. I can see that. As the party is electing a new leader, she's an obvious choice. - You're getting a lot of attention. - Not for our policies, I'm afraid. A boy is strangled and your colleague calls it 'well done'. Your policies seem quiet clear. I didn't come to discuss politics. Okay. Do you need help? I have... for some time been pursued by someone. What makes you think that? I just know. I can't be more specific. As a public figure it is perhaps normal? A few months ago someone broke into my flat in Oslo. - Did you report it? - Yeah. I don't think they will do much. The police has "limited resources". I'm sorry, but... I'm not a body guard. I guess I'm not from the right political camp. If you have anything specific, I suggest you go to police. In case you should change your mind. Norwegian People's Party, Marit Haug. LAST NIGHT'S RIOTS - Anything else? - I'll have a coffee. - To go. - Make it two. He'll pay. I did some research on Mikael Adu. - You were his Child Welfare contact. - All of that is confidential. - Have a nice day. - But you knew Adu! I said no! Marit? I don't get this. Shouldn't you speak before Einar? - Here you are put after him. - Honestly... Thanks. Kristian? - Shouldn't I speak after your address? - It's better if Einar goes on first. We must put an end to this Adu story. Everybody expects it. - I thought you were informed? - No. Damned... Is it all right? Not really. Now I have to rewrite my introduction. Great. All right, everyone. We're on in 5 minutes. I'm ready. Let's see how he will get away with this. He has to back down. If he thinks he stands a chance against Marit Haug. - At least she's better than him. - Bergene is harmless. - How can you say that? - He's stupid enough to be honest. Whereas this Marit Haug gives their program a pretty face. JUSTICE FOR ADU Hello, Bergen! On behalf of the party... my two deputy leaders and myself, I wish you welcome and thank you for your warm reception. This Friday opens our national convention, and when the weekend is over, ends an era for me and my party. After 30 years as party leader, it is with regret I pass on the chairmanship. But I enter this process totally confident that the convention can chose between two worthy, competent candidates. And now, please welcome Einar Bergene! I know that many of you have come to hear what I have to say on the Adu case. I also know that many among you expect me to make an apology. Which I have no intention of doing. What I do deplore is the situation created by the Adu case. I also deplore that anti-social individuals and immigrant groups use violence instead of their democratic right to express themselves. I deplore. . . All the weapons on the street. And that more people chose to use them. People with psychological problems, with other views and values than us. This is the new reality the police is facing. A reality we naively are importing from other countries. A reality the government coalition refuses to act upon. I've had enough. I'm off. . . . Doing their job. We can't blame the police for maintaining order. Life is strange sometimes, Hamre. - What's happened now then? - Marit Haug came to my office today. She said she felt pursued. And what did you tell her? To go to the police if she had anything specific. My, oh my! She gave a vague description of a man. I think she saw him in the crowd today. We'll talk with her. But first Bergene. He was the target here. She felt threatened... And three hours later she's inches away from a bullet. - Coffee? - Thanks. There could be a connection? True. It could also be that it doesn't take her much to ask for help. - Like a break-in. - Right. You take it. No witnesses, nothing missing. Is she inventing? The Oslo police has at least used a lot of resources on her complaints. Why would she lie? For a politician having a bodyguard gives a certain status. If she needs attention, she should go to the press. Depends what kind of attention we're talking about. - That bad, huh? - Yeah. If we want it in the papers, we must make a statement now. No, Jan Arild. First we'll see what the police says. - And release a press statement later. - I'll take care of it. We'll let Jan Arild deal with the press. What? That could be misunderstood. We must appear in person. - It would seem as if we don't care. - We'll discuss this later. Everyone knows we've had our conflicts. Now we must show our sympathy with Einar and his family! That we can do later. The important thing now is to stand together. There is not much we can say so far. She stable, but the situation is still critical. It's great if one of you could stay with him. I could stay, if you want. Thank you. - But I would rather that Kristian... - Yes, of course. Marit Haug, how is Eva Bergene? It's too early to tell. We'll issue a press release later. Could you yourself be in danger? The only thing that matters now... is that Eva will pull through. NPPleadership candidate Einar Bergene. . . "I understand I'm not from the right political camp. . ." You've reached Marit Haug, I can't come to the phone. . . You can't stay at the hotel. I'll take you to my place. You'll be safe here. The break-in at your house... The police says there was no sign of entering. - And nothing was stolen? - Not that I know of. - How do you know someone was there? - I'm certain of it. Tell me one thing... Why break in if you don't want to steal anything? Information. They've accessed my computer. All right. - Hello? - Ingvild. Watching the news? - No, why? - Just put on Channel 2. . . . It's a development our party has warned against for years. Does this mean you hold immigrant groups responsible for the attack? No. My point is only that these events. . . . . . Show that we need someone like Einar Bergene in Norway today. To drop the Adu case, and Einar Bergene's. . . - Hi. Have you seen Kristian? - He's in there. - Why aren't you taking the phone? - Oh, I'm sorry... I had to disconnect yesterday. And that improvised press conference? Einar wanted to thank people. - Why was I not informed? - You just said it... It was improvised. The press came, so we just played it by ear. But to hold a press conference... ...and I'm the only one not present... Don't overestimate your own importance. This is first and foremost about Einar. This is Varg Veum. I asked him to check a few things. Shouldn't we rather let the police do that? I will only need 5 minutes of your time. My schedule is full. We're having a meeting now. But see if Marianne can fit you in. I have to go. We'll speak later. Let's see... It was already tight, and with all that has happened... I understand. That looks great. And perhaps you could put the flyers on the table here. Great. I think that's it. Excuse me... You have 2 minutes? - I have a meeting. - We can talk on the way. - You work with Marit Haug? - Yes. - I've been her assistant for 8 years. - Then you must know her well. - Has she mentioned being stalked? - She's not one to complain. What do you think then? Is she inventing? Is that what you get paid for? Snoop around and talk shit about her? - Why should she invent it? - The police says... They've never believed her. Not even when... When? They say she's made groundless reports. She's been terrorized for 2 years! By Trond Rogn. Rogn is a former party member. I've just been to the hospital. They've put Eva in artificial coma to give the body some rest. They will not know more before tomorrow. I'm sorry. Shall we then postpone the convention? Well... What's happened is a tragedy. And my heart goes out to Einar and Eva. But this might take time. How can we postpone such an important... Einar is one of two candidates. It is unfair to go ahead with the election now. Marit scores 60% in all opinion polls, and more within the party. So why pretend Einar is a contender? Out of respect for a competent colleague? We will not decide on this now. Have you read Jan Arild's note? To say such things before the police gets back to us, will not seem serious. We only express what people are thinking. - We must take people seriously. - You're accusing all immigrants! Did you see this report? A majority sees the attack as a result of a failed immigration policy. We must respond to that! They are our electorate. Black granite, imported from Russia. Fantastic quality. Fully polished. Will last for ever. - Are you Trond Rogn? - Trond Emil Rogn. Varg Veum. I want to ask you about Marit Haug. At NPP's national convention. Marit was host and I was regional leader. The youth section was there, so we partied a bit. At the afterparty this black guy had managed to get in. He made a fuss, and a heavy political debate followed. So one of us had to throw him out. Later the same night, he turned up again. In the harbour, drowned. You may remember the story. I got connected to it, and that bloody cunt claimed it was my doing. What bullshit. I mean, the case got dismissed. I was excluded from the party. Two years later I had to move, I was stigmatised as a killer. - See what I mean? - And you started terrorising her? I'd rather say harassing. And I did harass her quite a bit. I was quite bitter then. Then I went to Russia, got a new life. Is doesn't bother you that Marit Haug might be the future prime minister? - You got back? - 6 months ago. Things go well? You have a lot of stone. You know what? People die all the time. Thanks. - Look who's coming... - I could feel the smell. - I realised that. - Sitting comfortably? Look at that... - Perfect shooting range. - Yes, it was a good choice. Great view, no cameras. Just shoot and leave. - What did he use? - A FAL rifle. - Trond Emil Rogn. - What a face. Former NPP member. Excluded after claims of racist violence. Marit Haug was behind it. He gets back to her, stalks her. She reports it, to no avail. But then... Then Rogn moves to Russia, and the harassment stops. Two months ago she feels stalked again. Curiously at the same time as Rogn decided to move back home. Rogn is a trained Home Guard soldier. He could easily handle a FAL rifle. Trond Rogn was not in town during the attack. He got back late last night. Thanks for looking out for me, but that was old hat. We distrust Marit Haug because she made a false statement. Rogn had an alibi. With the trajectory from here you simply can't miss. What does that show? It was an amateur... Someone who overreacted after the Adu case. - You know what I think? - No! I think that suits you fine. A mad perpetrator, of foreign origin, is the perfect solution for you right now. Bastard... That bloody idiot. - He will use this for all it's worth. - Ingvild, relax. Our position is safe no matter how much Jan Arild gets out of this. People want us to get into government. With Einar that is impossible. I just can't stand to see you treated like this. Oh, Ingvild... It's okay. I can handle it. - I think this is a bit... - Yes, you... - Could I get a word with you? - Sure. - Just you. - Okay. Will you clean it up? Why didn't you tell me about Trond Emil Rogn? - Who told you about... - Listen, Marit. I would have found out in any case. I apologise. It was stupid not to tell you. The police says you made a false statement? I was convinced I saw him. But he had an alibi. He had been with Einar. As if that can be called an alibi! Trond Emil and Einar were best friends even then. - For all I know they were in on it. - Did you smear him on purpose? Trond Emil fronted extreme views that would have destroyed the party. Just to recap, Einar Bergene dislikes you because his friend got excluded. This was years ago. It's all forgotten. - Was it Trond Emil who? - No. He has already been cleared by the police. The last polls give Einar a jump to 47 per cent. Just a phase of sympathy. Or people are starting to realise his views are not so extreme. - They are not part of our program. - Perhaps they should be? People are getting concerned about the way things develop. They want a harder line. But we've ignored this and failed to respond. We've worked hard to become a credible coalition partner. If we adopt a populist anti-immigrant line, we can forget any... Marit... Isn't it more important to be taken seriously by our electorate, then to flirt with potential coalition partners? We must postpone the convention to give Einar a chance. You want to influence the election. I realise you dislike this development. But this is how democracy works. The convention is postponed. With two days. "I have information on the attack. Sentrum hostel, room 210." Come on, come on! - Are you Leif Hansen? - What do you want? Know who stays in room 210. Do I look like a receptionist? He's from Bosnia. Stocky build. - Does he have a name? - I don't ask people's names. - Has a woman been to see him? - No idea! I haven't seen him since he came. Be quick. I don't really like this. Finished? What the fuck... Isak... Isak Bala. Had you listened to Marit Haug, this could've been avoided. Don't accuse me of killing people in front of my men. - He was in any case suicidal. - So you already conclude on suicide? A big, strong man, and no fight... We can't really tell before the autopsy. Can we? What about the note? Why was Haug asked to come? We're trying to find the girl on the hotel's CCTV. You seem eager to close this case. Because of political pressure or are you in a hurry? I have to deal with reality here. Which is more complicated than politicians think. We have many criminal immigrants, with severe diagnoses, but they get no help. They're sick, and they have weapons! Our only instrument of protection is common sense. Common sense proved successful in the Adu case. ...six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four. Come on, turn around, over... Hips, around... and up. - What's happened? - I just need a name, Synne. Someone I can ask. I've quit the Network. The police started asking questions. Please. - Synne... - You know I can't. - It's vital that we keep silent. - You know you can trust me. You should speak to Markus Vik. Reverend Vik? - Reverend Vik? - Markus. Isak. I'm sorry. I've been worried about him lately. Last time I saw him, he seemed a bit... - What? - A bit unbalanced. When was that? It's okay. Here. I got you a new one. - Hi. How are things? - Good. That's Elena. She's a doctor and helps us sometimes. That was his bed. - How long had he been here? - 4 weeks. He had just been informed he would be expelled. Did he have any friends? - Someone he confided in? - He kept mostly to himself. Are you quite sure? He didn't speak with others as far as I know. - And no other personal belongings? - No. - Who did he send money to? - To his family. Without them they would starve. They shouldn't go hungry for a while. Hamre? What happens to your theory if I tell you that Isak Bala received Who told you? Veum, it's illegal to withhold information! It was just a hypothetical question... - Can I give you a lift? - No thanks. The bus will be here soon. Did you treat Isak Bala? I don't know the name. Did you know him? I'm sorry. I don't know him. - What are we having? - Pizza! Don't laugh. It's tasty, easy to make, and about the only thing I can prepare. Marit... Isak Bala received 150000 just before the attack. - He was on a contract? - That's what it seems. I want you to be extra careful in the next coming days. - Marit. - Hello, it's Kristian. - Eva Bergene has just died. - What? She had a complication. And nothing could be done. Yes, that would be good. I'm so frightfully sorry... My condolences. - Einar... - Leave me! - As your friend I stand by you. - She's gone. You realise that? - How the hell could that happen? - Look ahead, otherwise you'll go mad. I'm finished. I can't go on. The grief won't diminish if you quit. What would she have said? You know what a support she's been. She believed in you! Would she like to see you give in? Things have lost their meaning, now that Eva's gone. We understand that you will need some time... You don't have to do anything. Listen to me! Marit is all fucked up, and people have so much sympathy for you... You don't have to give interviews or do anything! We only need to publish a few pictures of you and Kajsa... Not Kajsa. Eva asked me especially not to. You understand that? Here he comes! Bergene, do you wish to say anything? This will make him win the election. - Varg Veum. - Anders Larsen. You called about the FN FAL, right? Fantastic rifle. Very precise. - Especially at long range. - Are they easy to get hold of? Easy? Well, perhaps not easy, but possible. If you have the right contacts. You're after the guy who used it. - Yes. - Wait. I'll show you something. Look. Did he shoot this? Not very good... Watch this. - Wow. He missed on purpose. - Exactly! Hamre, it's Veum. - Who else knows about the 150000? - If you're not telling us. . . You have to give me everything you know about the money. I will not reveal my source. If you don't comply, I'll press charges. What would you achieve by doing that? Why so interested in the money? You have your psychotic immigrant. Who committed suicide. Case closed. We got a DNA match from Interpol. The chap you found is not Isak Bala. His name is lbrahim Checu. Kosovo Albanian, lives in Oslo. Status as humanitarian refugee. He must have borrowed Bala's name. Then perhaps you could trace this transfer. A nice lump sum. Why would a man with papers hide in a church? I'd like to know the same thing. Marit? Marit? THEIR SECRET LOVE TRIP Marit Haug and secretary in Thailand! It's weird. I know half the population, but have no one to talk to. Thanks. Have you every been to Bali? That's where this picture was taken. On our first trip together. I have so many lovely memories. Until I saw this spread on the front-page. Have you... been together long? For... ...two years! The way I look! What did he say? You must be kidding... Anything for a front-page? I'll call you back. Hi, Varg. What's the score? Your boss applauds every time you ruin someone's life? Are you so sensitive? Why take it personally, it's Marit Haug! She might become prime minister. It's of political interest and... ...a news story if she's gay. - Who gave you the pictures? - I don't know. - Don't fuck with me, Alex. They were delivered to the desk anonymously. They were stolen from Haug's PC some months ago. Why do think they came now, just before the party election? This is crap, Alex. Someone wants to break her, and you let yourself be used as a handy idiot. It has... been some difficult days for our party. Einar Bergene has been hit by a tragedy. In the middle of this comes our convention to elect a new leader. In view of these circumstances, it is absurd... to be sitting here discussing my private life. But the reason we do that... is because... a local newspaper... found it suitable to print an article which claims I have a secret relationship with party secretary Ingvild Steen. There is nothing secret about my relationship with Ingvild Steen. She does an incredible job. And we have been friends for years. And as good friends it happens we give each other a hug. So I would like to make it clear once and for all... I am not gay. And I've not dated Sweden's Crown princess as some claim. So... any questions? Varg! A tipster claims Marit Haug has made private use of parliamentary funds. I will not print it. This whole thing stinks. - Who handed in the tip? - I don't know. Wait! I think it might be an insider. - Within the party... Bergene? - From his side. It's no secret there's an ongoing power game within the party. But if this is true, then it's totally crazy. Thanks, Alex. Take it as anonymous tip. That was quite a performance. How can you be the leader of a party that refuses to accept you as you are? It's about more than just sexual orientation. Do you realise how hard I've worked to get where I am? Hard enough to renounce on love. To live as a lesbian couple... ...is totally incompatible with the leadership of a party like ours. You're only nave if you can't see that. - There are more important things. - Such as? A chance to change society, make it a safer... Power. The power to achieve things, yes! Send me an invoice for your services. Eva Bergene is dead, lbrahim Checu is dead... What happens in your bedroom is totally irrelevant, all right? A source claims the pictures were planted by someone in the party. And thinks it could be Bergene. - He doesn't have the guts! - Listen... If the burglar and the gunman is the same person... - I refuse to believe this! - Was it the same guy? Yes! I don't really know any more... Chin up. Come with me. I want you to sit here... See if you recognize the woman who gave you the message. Use this. His name wasn't Isak, but lbrahim Checu, right? He was hired for an attack and you took him to the church. You helped him find a hideout, and you informed Marit Haug. Please! I have a little girl in Russia. Let me be. The best thing you can do is to tell me what happened. You didn't know what this was about, perhaps. I don't know anything. - What do you want? - Ask your girl a few things. She's my wife. Go inside. Perhaps I should ask you instead? About what? Isak Bala... It doesn't sound familiar? What about lbrahim Checu? - Get the hell out of here. - So that you knew... Go! Get the hell out of here! - You OK? - Did you see him? - Trond Emil. - They're married! Trond Rogn must be the man behind Checu. The attack and the press leak are connected. - It's all a political game! - It wasn't her. It has to be. She's part of the Network and he's your old political enemy. But it wasn't the girl I saw. Are you protecting someone? Ingvild perhaps? - I must think of the convention. - What is this? It's not my job to solve this. The police can do it. Or you. FOR A SAFER FUTURE - Is it Trond Emil? - Yes. And Einar. You have to find out if there's a connection. Check their mail... See if you can check Einar's and Jan Arild's mail. You want me to check all their mails? Marit... What's going on? - Ingvild, you must help me. - I can't do it. Please... All right. User. Jan Arild Sanne Hi! From. Kristian Fredriksen. To. Jan Arild Sanne. Einar Bergene's speech - Marit? - Hi. Could you come up? - I must show you something. - Coming. "Dear friends. A week ago my life was changed." "I was the victim of an attack." Look at the date. Einar's speech was written before the attack. - Have you taken a copy of this? - Yes. I'm calling the police. - No, don't. - What? We must think. One wrong step could harm the entire party. You can't withhold this. We've worked so hard to get here! Should we let this destroy everything? Lying just creates more lies. We just have to find the right strategy. We'll talk about this later. We're in the middle of our convention. You can't come here. I can't come here? Two people are dead. It's not a good idea to run your own game. If you have anything specific, I suggest you go to the police. Dear colleagues. Dear friends. Less than a week ago something happened which changed my life for ever. I was the victim of an attack. An attack that became fatal to my wife. I lost the one person who... ...who... I lost the one person who is dearest to me. Next to my little daughter Kajsa. But I know that Eva would have wished that I continue my life in politics. That is also what I have decided to do. Elena? - You must see a doctor. - No. No doctor, no police. I know Trond is behind all this. He forced you to hide Checu, didn't he? He said I never would see my daughter again. - This is all my fault! - No, this is not your fault. Elena... Thank you. - Isak, he... - Ibrahim Checu, you mean. He came after the shooting, terrified. He had to leave Norway. He wanted to give information to Marit Haug. - Why? - He needed money. I wanted to help him, but Trond forced me to tell where he was. Why didn't you go to the police? In two months we will have been married for three years. Then I can get a divorce and have my daughter come from Russia. She's only 10 years old. She has no one to rely on. What the fuck have you said?! She didn't have to say much. I found a lot at your office. Damned... Fucking hell! You fucking bastard! The perfect plan. A fake attack... ...to give Bergene sympathy. And then slander Marit Haug. You call upon an expert shot who pretends to miss but stays in full control. A masterly plan! - You can't prove it! - No, but the police can! As the amateur you are, you left a treasure trove for the technicians. Because you had to fight to kill that guy, huh? You'll be nailed for the attack and two murders. But tell me. Did you operate alone? Was it your plan? Was it Bergene? He provided an alibi, but will you sacrifice everything for him? I won't say a fucking word! - Want one? - No thanks. How is Kajsa doing? Fine. Under the circumstances. I don't know... - How much she understands of it. - Right. These things take time. You have a difficult time ahead of you. I would like you to step down. It would be the best for your family, and for the party. That's absurd! - The whole party is behind me. - It has to be this way. You will do it for the best of your family... - And wish Marit... - Why? Einar, your time will come. But if you want a future in this party... ...then you'll do exactly as I say. Einar has come to the conclusion that he after all... ...is not strong enough to stand as party leadership candidate. By being present here today, and in view of the challenges we have ahead of us... he has realised that he's not able to fill this function right now. His family needs him, and it's Einar's wish that we give all our support to the other candidate, Marit Haug. Thank you! Do you know what day it is today? Mikael Adu's birthday. He would have been 19 years today. I have said all I have to say on that issue. You thought it wise to call his death 'a job well done'. - You went a bit far. - What do you want? Talk about the attack. We know that Trond Emil Rogn hired lbrahim Checu to perform a fake attack. We know it all. What the hell are you saying? Was Trond Emil... in on the attack? He's been arrested and taken in for questioning. My wife... My wife was killed! It gave you a good amount of sympathy. What the hell are you saying?! That Eva died... to make me win the party election? You didn't know? You knew nothing about the plans... Jan Arild Sanne... He put pressure on me to stand. He pressured me. Insisted I should stand as candidate after Eva's death. Wait... Kristian must have discovered something. - He just asked me to step down. - I'm sorry. In a few months we might for the first time... be in government. We will with our solutions... create the safe society we wish for ourselves and for our children. Whether you distribute flyers, have a seat in Parliament or... stand as Prime minister candidate, this is what it's about! "Einar knows. Meet me in the lobby." Trond Emil God bless... They say we get the politicians we deserve. I think we deserve a little bit better. Must remember to vote then... One question... How did Marit make Fredriksen change his mind? She wanted to run her own game and you helped her, didn't you? You found something to use against him. That much for honesty and idealism. I think that... I think that Kristian wanted Marit out when he discovered our relationship. - As if homosexuality was... - An illness? But that Marit could fall that low... I'm so disappointed. Thanks. Oh, thank you, they're lovely! How will the voters notice a woman is elected? Hopefully they won't notice. Fredriksen! - How do you see Bergene's step-down? - Congratulations. You are your own worst enemy. People like you create Adu cases. You don't respect people. Nothing is true or real. It's only a game... to achieve power. ...but the party now has a candidate that is just as strong as Bergene. What the hell was that about? Look at the date. Take it as an anonymous tip. Kristian Fredriksen, ex-leader of NPP, is being investigated for having. . . The paper claims to have information linking the party leader to the attack. The two party bosses, Fredriksen and Sanne, are charged with complicity in the murders of. . . Fredriksen and party colleague Sanne are charged with complicity in the. . . But did Marit Haug know about the contact between Fredriksen and Trond Emil Rogn? Did she withhold this information?
