 

                        A virus which initially appeared to be a common flu has turned out to be a far more serious problem. The number of victims of the mysterious epidemic is rising disproportionately. After the infertility, now the epidemic. For the first time in the history of mankind there is a birth rate of zero. ... new letter by the Plague Spreader. "I am the necessary evil. The unfaithful will die!" It seems that there have been The whole world is in a state of alert, from Rome to Moscow, from Sydney to Mogadishu. Even the army are unable to hold back the revolt of the dead. A nuclear solution is now a distinct possibility. The world is on its knees. Back to the studio. The government has announced the opening of extermination camps for the infected, but is it possible to kill the dead? Neo-Nazi groups proclaim themselves the New Death Militia. Humanity is in total chaos. The Pope committed suicide at 9 o'clock this morning by shooting himself in the head. He left a note saying, "I do not want to come back." Aren't you tired of watching all that stuff? What do you think you'll find? An answer? An answer to what? Maybe I'll understand why we are in this hell. Maybe why the two of us aren't dead too. You're a pain in the arse. Listen, maybe you like sitting here on your own, watching TV, but I don't give a shit about understanding what has happened. It happened, and that's that. Do you know what interests me more than anything else in the world? To see a woman's face again... Fuck, that would make me happy. I swear, I'd be willing to settle down. Even if she wasn't beautiful... No, well, not that ugly, but... Igor, there is no one left. You know that too. It's been months since we've found anyone alive. Except for the painter and those bastard Nazis, who else remains? No one. Only those dead bastards. I'm not looking for any answer, for the simple reason that there is no question. Even if there is an answer, what the fuck do you need it for? Once the two of us are dead... that's the end! I seriously doubt that you and I and those perverts will ever be able to spawn a few brats to continue our line, do you? Anyway, it's all the Plague Spreader's fault. Yes. Maybe. You're doing my head in with your "maybes"! He was the one who spread the virus. I swear, if I ever meet him in person I'll pump so many slugs into his face... He would be dead too, by now. And how can you be so sure he's responsible for everything? This is what I think... our friend, the fucking Plague Spreader, is a repressed loser with an alcoholic mother and a violent dad, but with a brain the size of Einstein's. And one day he decided that the best way to get his revenge was to play his trump card - get rid of us all. Maybe it's merely a coincidence that the virus attacked women first. Maybe it's connected to the infertility. I don't know. I don't think you need me to tell you what we are without women. Dead. Yes. Dead sums it up pretty well. Where are you? I need you two here in the lab! I can't fucking stand this guy. "Lucky me to have found you two, "rather than standing out there having my arse bitten off." - Fuck off. - At least he made it back in one piece. Sometimes I wonder where it is that he disappears to for days at a time. Actually, you know what? I'd rather know nothing about it. Listen, you speak to him. I'm still not sure whether he just pisses me off or if I'm frightened by him. And let's get moving, so we can go out for our usual useless stroll around, then get back and drown our sorrows in a few litres of beer. Let's find out what he's discovered. At least he's trying. He's been amusing himself with experiments for months. Why did he have to be one of the survivors? A restaurant chef would have been better. At least we wouldn't have had to eat the same slops every day. How about if we place an ad? Maybe someone will show up. It is just as I thought - the infection is a sort of worm. It gets into you and sucks your brain. A parasite, a guest - but who says it is unwelcome? Sure, who wouldn't like to have a little fucking worm sucking his brain? What do you mean by "unwelcome"? I don't follow you, Gyno. The epidemic has certainly been a big blow for mankind, no doubt about it, but what if it was an inevitable step towards the sudden evolution of the race? What if the virus isn't an enemy, but is here to help us evolve? Viruses evolve, change with time, genetically modify themselves, but unfortunately we can't control them. That's enough. It's entirely a question of, "How do we control the infection? How do we contain it?" In order to avoid rotting, like a piece of meat left out in the sun. Are you trying to convince me that all this is actually a good thing? The only "inevitable step" is that I have to put up with your bullshit every fucking day of the week! Igor, let him finish. Fuck him. And fuck you too, Alen. I'll be waiting outside. I need some more, Alen. Trust me, I'm about to discover something great. There are only a few left in the cage. Tomorrow you're going out to look for survivors, aren't you? So, since you're going anyway... OK, got it, man. We'll take care of it. Did you manage to get the surveillance cameras working? As you can see, I've done it. I managed to intercept a satellite signal which is still being transmitted. Funny, isn't it? Spy satellites still sending signals from space. It's a pity there's no one left to spy on. Yeah, OK, OK. Where's the best place for us to focus our attention? I think you will find plenty of fresh flesh in Sector F. Sector F? It's a fucking jungle. It'll take at least two days, if we make it there alive. I know, it's quite far away, but we'd better not attract too many of them to this area. They haven't been seen for weeks, and I don't want to darken our good star. It's not safe for us to venture that far out. All right, fine. You'll get what you want. But you must speed up your experiments. What a shitty world. Here, you smoke it. It can't kill you any more. Do you know the joke about the two ducks? Ducks aren't funny. And the one about the two truck drivers? Truck drivers aren't funny either. Shit. There's a fly in the soup. If you're not going to eat it, I... Hey, Doc, did you hear? Sector F - what a great place. Last time I went there I was in danger of having my dick bitten off. I guess the doctor is sending us there to piss me off. And that freak expects me to believe that it might be possible one day for a man to... How would I look with a big tummy? Forget it. Good night. Good morning, Doctor. Good morning, Alexis. How are your tests going? Well... Listen, I've been hearing about this testing programme for RB Pharmacology's new drug. I'd like to get involved. The patients have already been selected. Doctor, you know how much I want to have a baby. Please. As a doctor, I understand that there's always an element of risk in these tests. I'm willing to take the risk. I'm sorry, but the risk is too great. Promise me you'll never leave me. I promise. Until the end of the world. Until the end of the world. Where the fuck have you been? I heard you taking the Corvette again. One of these days you're gonna get yourself killed. Do you think you can help her this way? You even know how to have fun in your sleep. Eh, party boy? Come on, get up. It's hunting day. They're for Arsehole Caravaggio. You know what that son of a bitch is like. He may be the Lord's right hand, but I don't think he knows much about Christian love. I can't believe it. You finished all the beer again. Not only is there no beer left in this shitty place, there is hardly anything left to eat. Since we also have to go on a corpse hunt for Dr Kildare, - we might as well go shopping too. - You've convinced me. But don't call him Arsehole, he'll get pissed off again. Call him Caravaggio. That's the way he likes it. Caravaggio? Fuck off. "Arsehole" suits him better. I'm curious to know how he's getting on with The Annunciation. How ignorant of you! It's The Deposition. You spend your days reading fucking books, and now you mix up life and death? Fuck off. Check the jeep. Brakes, tyres, everything. Hey, who do you think you are? Lieutenant Columbo? Listen, don't be an arsehole. You and this pig spend all day fucking around, while we work our arses off out there. It would take me less than three seconds to cut off your dick and make myself a belt like yours. What are you fucking laughing at? See to that fucking jeep. That one... One of these days, I'm gonna... This belt is a tribute to my Indian blood. My mother was descended from a famous tribe. And everyone knows that my mother was, above all... a slut. You sure know how to endear yourself to people, eh? They think they're warriors, but they're just arseholes. They don't even have the guts to leave this place. It's easy to shoot a puppet. I'd love to see them out there. Don't be so hard on them. They're only trying to kill time. You're right. Although it's obvious now that time is trying to kill us. Listen, Mengele, we're going to get you those arseholes, but you could at least cook us something that doesn't taste of shit. Thanks. Break a zombie's leg! Are you off on holiday, guys? I bet you've got a date with a nice survivor. Nope, only dead flesh. Only dead flesh. Watch your back while we're away, mind you. Don't worry, there are plenty of bullets in my baby. Buck up! The beauty of life is that you never know when it will end! What's up? You homesick? Do me a favour. The slaughterhouse needs a good clean. It's my turn to do it but, as you can see, I'm on the road. Send those two dickheads over. Just think up some excuse. Get them to clean up all that shit. I don't know if I can do that. I don't want any trouble, you know? Have I convinced you? Go in peace. I'll see to it that those two wallow in the shit. Slim-Jim! Dickhead! Come here, you fuckers! I'm sorry. Every time, I feel swamped by bullshit. We should just kill them and that's all. Bang, bang! That would be fun. Not risk our necks every day to catch some of them alive. We're a survivor salvage team, not undertakers. Let's give him another chance. Maybe he really can find an antidote. - Maybe this way, Alexis... - For God's sake, Alen! Alexis is dead. Fuck! She hasn't got flu, she's dead! All this is insane. You're wrong. Her heart is still beating. She's been contaminated - and I don't know how or why... - but she is a healthy carrier of the virus. - Healthy? Don't you realise she's... There's no getting through to you. Let's get moving and find some heads to blow up. Don't forget, Gyno wants them alive. Billions of people have died. It won't make any difference if I kill a few more, will it? Besides, that arsehole kills a lot more of them than we do. I don't feel like arguing. Let's change the subject, OK? Fine, let's change the subject. What do you think we'll get from Caravaggio in return for what we're bringing him? Today, whatever we want. I've got a real gem - the kind you only find once in a lifetime. I'm not sure I want to know what it is. Let's try and get out of this city without attracting any attention. Smile, I'm taking you to the countryside. Lucky me. I'm a city boy, not a fucking farmer. I hope that maniac still has some of that booze of his left. I'm mad about it. My God! That stuff stinks of shit, you can smell it a mile away. God knows what he puts in it. Ah, what do you know about it? Stop. Fuck! Stop! Shit. What's the matter with you? How cruel Mother Nature is. I'm serious. She's pitiless. Have you gone off your head? Look over there. I can't allow an angel such as this to be dissected by that butcher. So what's your solution? A real Samaritan. Yes, I'm the romantic type, after all. What the fuck do you want? Good morning to you, Arse... Caravaggio. We've got something really special for you. Yes, pieces of dead people - bowels, titbits... Just shut up. Take a seat, please. No thanks, Caravaggio. We're in a hurry. We want food and beer - a lot of beer! Just a moment. Calm down, boy. Nowadays, being in a hurry makes no sense. Stop and listen to the silence God gave us! It's a blessing, not a condemnation. Cogito ergo sum! Quid pro de... Pro quid, quid pro... Quid pro... Do tu des! Come on, give it up! That's the way I like you, old man! I can't believe it! I've been waiting for this moment for months! It's not that bad. No. We're impressed. Seriously. Very impressed. But now we have to go. You know, the food... Eh? What? Oh, yes. Go in and take what you want. Bye. See you. - If I were you I wouldn't do that. - What are you trying to tell me? I'm not saying it's corpse flesh, but I can't picture Caravaggio doing any hunting. Fuck, that guy has some sick shit going through his mind. He's no worse than our son-of-a-bitch doctor. At least Caravaggio doesn't harm anyone. And, what's more, thanks to him we can eat and drown ourselves in beer. Are you enjoying the show, guys? - How long till we get there? - Sector F is miles away. You know that. - Why are you being such pain in the arse? - I need a piss. Why don't you just say, "Alen, can you stop the car, please?" Alen, can you stop the fucking car, please? I need a piss. Don't go too far. I can't do it if somebody is watching. Our primary-school teacher made us go with the toilet door open while she stood watching. When I shot that fatso dead I should have pissed on her head. Fuck you! You took your time. I've got a big one, you know? It takes me a while to drain it. You're bloodstained. You don't say. Alexis, Alexis. You are the key to everything. I'm sure of it. Yes... I've sent Alen away. We won't be disturbed. What's that? You like my hair? Oh, thanks. I think you're beautiful too. Doctor, look. The reagent of the stem cells actually seems to be changing. Well, I think it's unlikely we were about to win the Nobel prize for ethics anyway, but I doubt that regenerating dead tissue will help to win anyone's favour. This modified virus seems to really work. It's a question of saving thousands of lives, so fuck ethics. I'm going for lunch. Would you care to join me? No, I have to work. Fuck! Billions of people have died, and you still can't get a moment's peace to take a nap. I know him. We worked together at the garage. I still remember his name. It's Janosh. Janosh Manfreduk. He came from the East. Fuck, what an unlucky guy. How interesting. I wish I had time to hear the whole story. Let's get the fuck out of here. Sorry, I just can't stand the taste of vomit. I know. I've had enough of those sacks of pus for today. Sector F is miles away. Why on earth are we doing this? You have any better ideas? Yes, sir. This is my plan - cut across Sector B and we'll pass the old distillery, then... Stop, I know what you're going to say. Forget it. I can't stand those guys. Come on, don't be a shithead. I'll talk to them. We'll trade them some beer for zombies. Remember, we have a score to settle with them. The Block A generator. They left us in the dark for a week. It's a sin to steal, but a greater sin to daub our walls with their fucking swastikas! Let's go over and settle the score, and we'll be enemies once again. Have I convinced you? Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't you already settle the score in Sector E? Do you think it's safe to show up there after you almost turned that fucker into a cyclops? Don't worry. They're stupid and they're always drunk. They're bound to have forgotten about it. It'll be a piece of cake. Yeah, sure. They'll have forgotten that you stabbed one of them in the face. Come on, please. I'll clean the bog for a month. For a month? Yes. Only if you swear that the worm between your legs may wither if you break your promise. I swear. - Fuck it. Let's go. - Oh, yeah! Go! You're free. We had some good times... attempting to change the destiny of humankind. Do you remember, Alexis? So, how are your tests going? There is some sort of reaction, but it isn't satisfactory yet. First it looks like the tissues are going to regenerate, but after a few minutes they return to their original state. I don't know where we're going wrong. I think that's a good sign. Keep going with it. You know, as time goes by you get more and more beautiful. It's almost as if you're getting younger. Flatterer. You needn't give me compliments to make me work harder. Hi, hunters. Hi, Rudi. We were wondering if... Not now, man. I'll deal with you later. Right now, it's time for target practice. Ladies and gentlemen... Or rather, gentlemen and gentlemen only! Since God did us the favour of freeing us from our bitches. Is that not so? Are you ready... for the grand "Shoot the Dead" tournament? On my right... the greatest whore fucker the world has ever known - Pablo! On my left... the man with the burning arse - Heinz! Just one shot. Just one chance. The punishment for anyone who makes a mistake... is death! We don't accept any losers in the Militia! We are about to make a natural selection! You win or you lose! Death makes you free! So, gentlemen! Are you ready? Three... two... one... Fire! Incredible, gentlemen! The winner is the man with the burning arse - Heinz! Well, hunter! I didn't think you were stupid enough to show your face round here again. I'm touched. Really. Come on. Let's bury the hatchet. I need some of your dead... and I want them alive. No way, my friend. As you can see, we need them for ourselves. Go fuck yourselves. I just saw the good use that you make of them. We can give you beer and cigars. Sorry, but I really can't help you. Why don't you let me talk to the short-arse? Surely he'd be interested in trading. What? What did you call him? Short-arse. Are you deaf, as well as being an arsehole? You must have respect for him. You must call him Fhrer! OK. Where is he? That short-arse, the fhrer? Now you've done it. What are you going to do about it? Come on! Let's get out of here! Fuck! Did you see those bastards' faces? You deserve an Oscar for coming up with the idea to shoot the chain like that. - Have you nothing to say for yourself? - Why did you do it? Do what? Come on! You were the one who was saying how much you hate those bigheads. - We taught them a lesson, that's all. - They might all be dead by now. Oh, God! You're right. Fuck them! Fuck! They were a real band, man! I'm not gay, I swear, it's just that... What the fuck was I talking about? What the fuck are you doing? Sinners, pigs, impure ones. This is the Plague Spreader, speaking to you from the New Church of Purifying Evil. Die and be reborn in the name of God. Join the brotherhood of the cult... According to the detector, that signal's coming from somewhere quite close, about 50 kilometres away. I don't know about you, but I'm dying to find out more about these cult brothers. So am I. Maybe there are also some cult sisters. Besides, I have a promise to keep with our friend the Plague Spreader. Calm down. First, I want him to explain to us why he did all this. But first we have to find him. OK. But then I'll take care of him. It's not safe to move at night. Let's wait until dawn. Are you mad? We're leaving right now. I don't care if it's dark. I don't want the good star that has protected that son of a bitch - to save him just as I'm about to box his ears. - OK, but you drive. I'm tired. That's music to my ears, daddy. We'll be there in a flash with a real man at the wheel. And this is why I'm saying, thank God for the gift he gave you! Once you were merely soulless maggots, but now... you are souls without sin, ready to be born again into the Kingdom of God! Jesus Christ! It smells revolting! Do you know what this room is used for? Hey, don't you remember the last time we cleaned it? I'm hungry. Fuck! My fault, my fault! Come on, let me drive. OK. We're nearly there. At last. I really need some action. Are you sure that fucking thing works? Sure. The army used these in Afghanistan to track down Bin Laden. Too bad they never caught him. Come on. Dosvidanya, son of a bitch. Sinners, pigs, impure ones. This is the Plague Spreader, speaking to you from the New Church of Purifying Evil. The new God awaits you. Set yourself free from your obscene sins. Die and be reborn in the name of God. Join the brotherhood of the cult. And this is why I'm saying, thank God for the gift he gave you! Once you were merely soulless maggots, but now... you are souls without sin... ready to be born again into the Kingdom of God! And the Father said to his son... "From death will come life." And he gave his son the weapon which would allow him to deliver life. "Here you are, O son. Kill for life!" The weapon extinguished the fire of the Lord, and Evil returned to hell, where he belongs. Then the son said, "Thank you, Father, for opening up..." Fuck! Alen, he's alive! Are you a priest? Do I look like a priest, dickhead? - Wait. - What? Why does a priest need a priest? No, I'm not a priest. I would have loved to be one, but I couldn't resist sin. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. There's nothing easier than confession. This guy destroyed the human race, and now he thinks he just has to make amends. That's all lies! Only lies. I made it all up, but I did it in order to save the survivors. I wanted them to fear me. If you fear someone, you listen to him. Yes, like a tyrant. No. Like God. I only wanted to save the survivors. And what have you been doing in the meantime? Enjoying some snacks? I know, I'm a monster. But all the food was finished, and I had to protect her. - Protect whom? - Who are you? - Forget about him, he's lost his mind. - Whom do you have to protect? Are you... Are you a priest? No, arsehole, but I know how to perform last rites. Who knows how many people that bastard killed? All because his head was full of shit. And he ate them alive too. God! Spreader... Plague Spreader, my arse! I'm tired. I'm tired of all this. For months, we were led to believe that the Plague Spreader was responsible. For months, he was the centre of attention. They said he was the devil incarnate. And the worst thing is, I was convinced of that too. Now we discover that he was nothing more than an aspiring killer priest. A madman, a nobody. It makes no difference whether he is a cannibal or not. I can't stand living like this. - Maybe I should... - What? Shoot yourself in the head? Excellent solution. What the fuck am I going to do? End my days with Dr... "I had so many problems as a kid"? Listen to me, you son of a bitch. Get your shit together, stand up, and let's finish what we started. Maybe this life is nothing special, but look on the bright side - we are the owners of the world. And you'd give up all this? Let's try and catch the next one alive. Let's walk around the building. They rarely stay isolated. She's alive. Damn, I'd never have believed it. Seems like there really is a God. He has helped me to find what I was looking for. Calm down. She can't be any older than 15. - What about the wound? - What wound? Your arm, idiot. It's just a scratch. I'm not a queer, like you. Don't worry, baby. You're safe now. Will you tell me your name? Fine. Come on. Sure. You couldn't be in safer hands. - How's your arm? - It's just a scratch. How much do you want for the girl? For God's sake, stop it. Come on. I'm only joking. But don't tell me the idea hasn't crossed your mind that there could still be hope. Maybe we won't be the last ones. Providing she's fertile. But tell me something - would you give birth to a child that is destined to live in a world where the dead lay down the law? Now that you mention it... Well, I don't necessarily have to settle down and get married, eh? Luckily she's sleeping. Dad said people were dirty. He said that the dead were the fault of dirty men. Then he brought some people. They were good, they loved me. When our supplies ended, Dad asked each of us to make a sacrifice. Then we received more supplies, but someone went away. Dad used to say they had gone to heaven. But I didn't trust him. He became evil. By the way, my name is Cristina. And I need to pee. I'd better go and keep watch. What shall we do now? We've found her, we'll find others. It's not the end, mate. It's not the end. They have weapons. Christ. I've never seen them armed before. What do we do? - The usual. I go right, you go left. - You fascist. - Ready? On the count of three. One... - Two... Three! Fuck. Bullets and arrows. Poof. Why... dead? Why... dead? Fuck, Igor! That one was talking! Yeah, well, I can talk too. But he was asking too many questions. OK, let me do the talking now. Why... dead? With her... I live! He... says... live! He? Who's he? Him! Him! Who locked you in here? Him. White... man. Arsehole. I can't, but you can, eh? She was asking too many questions. I told you so. Wait here. Don't come in, whatever happens. And who are you? You might as well lower that gun. Can't you see the state I'm in? He used to work with Alexis. - Who put you in that state? - Gyno. And he keeps me... alive... so that I can help him with his experiments. You call this living? So this is where Gyno used to come? There are talking zombies up there. Well, they stopped talking after we'd dealt with them. They still have a very limited vocabulary. They have become less aggressive, and have started to develop cognitive abilities, but they are like children. Fertilin's retrovirus is only half working. Fuck. But they are dead. They should go to hell. We succeeded in making them reproduce. Now the women are fertile... but they give birth to dead babies. There are already too many dead people around. Wasn't it enough? Our team was conducting genetic experiments on dead tissue. It was being financed by the government. The results were not considered satisfactory, and the programme was cancelled. We decided to keep on going, doing more extreme experiments. At that point we had already transgressed the ethical boundaries... that should guide any research. I wasn't aware of these experiments. After Alexis had a miscarriage, she changed. - She hardly ever came home. - Alexis had tried Fertilin. The drug was being tested, but it didn't seem to be working. All the women had spontaneous abortions after a few weeks. Alexis injected it directly into the body of a corpse. The reaction to that substance went beyond all expectations. She had brought a corpse back to life. The woman bit another doctor. And from that point on, everything changed. Now we're using it on them! But Gyno isn't satisfied. He wants to stop doing these tests. It's high time that bastard gave it a rest. He wants to move on to the next stage... a living being... with one of the undead! Oh, God. We have to get back to the base. Wait! Wait! Give me your gun. Are you kidding? Not this one. Take this. If he dares touch her, I'll kill him. Would you mind telling me what the fuck is going on? That son of a bitch is so crazy, he thinks he can give life to a new race. Dead with dead generates dead. But alive with dead... or better, with the living dead? Are you saying that pervert wants Cristina to scr... A zombie and her together? Yes, and why not Alexis with him? My God! The moment I see him I'll cut off his dick. I promise you. I promise. I'll talk to Gyno. I don't want to kill him unless it's necessary. Then we'll find our answers elsewhere. But you have to promise me you'll stay out of it. I'll take care of it. You... Well, you piss off! - OK, daddy. - Fine. Bastard. Stop the car! Sons of bitches! Just think how happy he'll be when he sees her. The world will be mine. Everything will be mine! You'll be my queen, and I'll be your master. Your king! Gentlemen, we have two brave hunters here in the arena... Dickhead Igor and Arsehole Alen. Let's place our bets. Son of a bitch! That's my lighter! Fuck, this is tough. And now... let's begin the zombie fight! What are we gonna do? What are the rules? Just think about how you're gonna save your arse, dickhead! Come on, fuckers! Show some balls! You'll like it. Get down! Son of a bitch... I told you it was better to bury the hatchet. I'm taking this back. I'll kill you, you son of a bitch. I'll kill you. Thanks, kid. You saved our arses, girl. Let's grab the weapons. You stay in the car. Get out! Go and check on Cristina. I'll take care of Gyno. She is no longer yours. Now she belongs to me. Shit. I don't know how to defuse it. Nothing personal, mate. It's not like we're really... in love. It's more to do with the continuation of the species, you know? What have you done to her? I knew you wouldn't understand. After all, you're only a man, whereas we... are gods. - You're utterly insane. - I was right. The infection marks the beginning of a radical change, an evolutionary acceleration without precedent. Like an immense metabolic propulsion. I know you saw my guys in Sector F. A bad business, but it was only to be expected. How can life be reborn from something which is dead? Understand? I'm living, but actually dead. It's incredible! And I feel as though I've been reborn a million times over. And she... She is my muse. Now we are like Adam and Eve... the progenitors of a new breed. You bastard. You're infected. You're one of them. Wrong! You are one of them! A little, old, useless man! But don't you worry. I'm generous. I'll make you into a new being. You can become one of us. Why did you do all this, Gyno? We used to be friends. Well, friend, in a world where the dead walk the streets surely you can understand that I have to put science ahead of friendship. How many wires are there? Three. Yellow, red and black. What happens if you make a mistake? We get blown up. You said that if you made a mistake we'd get blown up, but if you'd done nothing we'd have been blown up anyway. Right. That's right. Take this and wait for me in the car. Don't touch her! Stupid. I'm helping her. This syringe contains new life, and I'm about to give it to you. You will become one of us - a god! Fuck, fuck! Igor! - Igor, help me! - You'll ruin everything! Ungrateful bastard! Don't worry about your friend, after you it'll be his turn.
