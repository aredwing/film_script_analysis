 

                        1 An ambush. Cute. Well now... It's my dear sister, Anna. Nina. It's been a long time, hasn't it? It has. What do you say we celebrate? I'm just waiting on you. Look at this. You think you've got me cornered? Nina! 'Til next time. Sweet Anna. All units, pursue. Lock down all train lines. There's no need for that. We're pulling out. Yes, but what about the intel? Our mission is complete. It's about time for an update from the Far East Branch, anyway. She was nothing more than bait. This was all just a decoy? To be honest, I didn't think it would be so easy. Now we just have to wait for Jin and the Mishima Zaibatsu to make their move. All right, what's next? Where else do we look? Relax. It wasn't a complete loss. Every single research facility has been shut down and the data erased. Go on. Explain to me how taking their bait wasn't a loss. It revealed to us they're as hungry for intel as we are. Proving that G Corp hasn't gotten their hands on the specimen, either. Well, in that case... Off to Russia you go. Oh? We're using it again? It's perfect for espionage. Kazuya keeps an eye on the doctor. What if he finds out? Then let him find out. I hope you realize what will happen, if you two fight. If the world can be destroyed by a mere father-son quarrel, then so be it. Who are they? Survivors of the Mutare? I finally have some good news. Our team in the Far East just sent in a report. This is from Kyoto. We've found our target, and he's quite handsome. So he was in Japan. Just as expected. I'll be flying to Kyoto tonight to confirm. Run a background check first. Last thing I want is for Jin to find out. That won't be a problem. We're using an organic approach. For this particular job, I have the perfect candidate. Very well then. Kyoto it will be. One minute, twelve seconds left! Hurry up! Whew. We actually made it! For a job well done! I'll come see you at lunch, okay? Don't be so picky. Bamboo isn't free, you know. Xiaoyu Ling of class B. I'm not late! I have seven seconds left! You have been summoned to the principal's office now! Expelled? Why? Because you think I'm late? That's not it. Your gym repair bill. Three hundred grand! We have no budget for a student like you. You always told me you didn't have a budget. Every time you go to P.E. You destroy something. That's because you keep telling me not to hold back. And then there's this. Yesterday's test results! You're flunking every subject! Come on, you don't have to be so harsh about it. And you have a complete lack of discipline. So in accordance with our rules, you'll be expelled and transferred! Now. What's next, principal? Transferred? Wait a sec, you can't do that! Principal, my butt. Who are you? Originally from China... And well-versed in the various martial arts of her native land. Don't act like you know me! Who the hell are you? As of today, I am your new counselor. Get used to it. You'll be transferred to a high school in Kyoto. Make contact with this student and learn what you can. Huh? What are you talking about? Why me? The answer is simple. Because you'll make a perfect spy. A spy? Whatever. I think I've heard way too much psychobabble for one day. Later, crazy lady. The Zaibatsu isn't the only one with access to Mishima Polytech. Before you walk out that door, perhaps you should stop and think about how I got your data. Mishima Zaibatsu... You mean the tournament?! Yes. See, that's how we handle things at G. G? G Corporation?! Exactly. The only worldwide conglomerate that is capable of thwarting the Mishima Zaibatsu's ambitions. Now I believe you know who runs G Corp. Kazuya Mishima. And checkmate, my little pawn. You'll be attending Kyogoku Academy, one of the most esteemed international schools in Kyoto. Affluent families from around the world send their children here. Security is air tight, making access to personal records impossible. The best approach will be by sending in a student of our own. Tell me, is that spelled with a Y and a U? Uh, yes! So, Mr. Lee... Excellent. Welcome to my classroom. Now, if you will. Take a seat right over there. Uh, where exactly? Any. Just pick whichever one is available. But, sir, every seat is available. The students are busy with the coming festival. I'm sure they'll be here tomorrow. Now, shall we begin? Aw, c'mon. Man this guy's a pushover. International schools are easy. You know, I could care less about G Corp. If he wasn't so hot there's no way I would be doing this. The challenge is figuring out a way for the two of us to meet. It would be great if I could just turn a corner and bump into him. Like in some cheesy soap opera. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I'm in a bit of a rush. Please excuse me. Man, running into some girl's not gonna help me. No uniform? International schools sure are the way to go. He should be right around here somewhere, but where? Ow! A shoe? Oh my god! What the? That's... What are you thinking? You'd normally be dead. Well, I'm not normal. Were you trying to... it's none of your business. Excuse me for helping. Just relax. I slipped, that's all. Hey, wait... Hm? This must have come off when... Actually, that's the second time it's happened. What?! He's slipped off the roof twice?! Twice in the three months he's been here. First time was there. He jumped. It was sort of like he did today. So is he actually trying to kill himself? I don't really know for sure. It's obvious! Well the first time, he sort of lunged off the roof. I was sitting on a bench, and then suddenly he was right on top of me. It happened so quickly. So, he fell right on you? Is this guy a friend of yours? What? Oh no. However... Oh-ho... If I get caught, I'm gonna end up in major trouble. Anybody home? He did go to Mishima Polytechnic. Wait, that's Jin! We all went to the same school? Why was he trying to hide this one? 78M? What's that about? Jeez, it's just the fridge. Don't scare me like that. I'm not usually the type to peep, but... I'll just take a quick look. X-Xiaoyu? Ls that you? Come on! Huh? It won't be long. The time is near. See you soon, my fair maidens. You're playing them off each other. Excellent job, 78M. I know you're waiting to send a report, so do it. But there's one thing... Never call me that number again. What were you doing there? I'd like to ask you the same thing. Well I was just... bringing him something. And you were going to give it to him in the shower? Course not! You were peeping there, too. My intentions are far more decent than wanting a peep show. Huh? Well to be honest I kinda have a crush on Shin. Wham? That's why I come by his room every night, to keep an eye on him. But why were you there? Oh, well, I was just... This is awkward. I knew it. You're a voyeur, aren't you? That is so not it! If you don't come clean, I'll report you. Hey, hey, wait a second. You're just as guilty! All right, fine. I have a crush on him too. What? Do you mean that? It's true. I also like Shin Kamiya. Really? Look, I'm sorry. This means you're my competition now! Huh? And I will not lose! Whoa, come on. Seriously? This is perfect! You'll make an excellent opponent! So then, I'm guessing you made contact. I'd say I made more than just contact. Fess up, this is why you chose me for this, right? Shin used to go to Mishima Polytech. And he was friends with Jin. You couldn't have told me this before? That makes them two years older than you. What is this? A mass disappearance? Out of the blue one day, an entire class suddenly went missing. No details were given and the investigation closed. The whole case was just swept under the rug. But one guy survived, didn't he? Correct. The only one among them who couldn't be killed. Are you saying Shin Kamiya is somehow immortal? Learn what you can about him. Easy, right? This means there's a chance Jin might make contact with Shin. I knew I picked the right person for this job. Now then... Tea? Only three years old, Kyoto Castle is an excellent cultural legacy, like the New Golden Pavilion. It is built on an ancient burial site where the sacred earth goddess spirit was enshrined. Here, below the castle, is a coffin where... And then there were none. What do you say? Let's go on a date. You'll like it. Thanks, I'll think about it. Look, it's my savior. Where have you been? Savior? Wh-what're you talking about? You said you'd go home with me today. Huh? Ls that true? Did you tell him that, Xiaoyu? Not at all! We gotta go. See ya! Hey, wait. Why are you calling me your savior? She's finally gone. Who? Alisa? She wouldn't give it a rest! I had no choice. But she does have interesting taste. A pair of tickets to the Mokujin Exhibit? What was she thinking? You've saved me twice now. Huh? Some day, I'll thank you properly. See ya. Wait! You dropped this the other day. That was my old school. Mishima Polytechnic. That's a big coincidence. Never thought I'd bump into someone from that school here. So, it's not a coincidence. Were you attending Mishima when this happened? Dunno. It's all a blur. One night, a whole class just vanishes. And it was your class. Sounds crazy. I have no idea what you're talking about. But the number in the photograph... What photo? Are we done here? Yeah. Fine. Later. Hey. About Kazama. You mean, Jin? He and I used to be on the same team. You guys talk? No, it's been years. I just hear bad rumors about him now. Like he's leading the Mishima Zaibatsu with a huge bounty on his head. You know, it's all too much to believe. I remember him being so easy going. Yeah, me too! But unlike everything around here, people change. Kyoto's this ancient city that stays the same, year after year. But like all cities, it's man-made. It could never endure like nature can. Everything humans do, either good or bad, will eventually turn to dust. W-wait! Shin... Hey, are you running away from me again? Sorry, girls. Gotta go. I think it's time we got started. Here. For you. That's so nice. Thanks. Um... Do you think I'm coming on too strong? Too strong? For what? I mean to try and get Shin to notice me. Right, that. I don't know what to tell you. Sorry. This love thing... It's really hard! Yeah, I know. I hear ya'. A while back, I lost a really good friend of mine. I've never stopped missing him. Never. Were you in love with this guy? No it wasn't like that. We were just close. I-I'm sorry. Hey, I think you're doing fine with Shin. So do you believe I should keep trying? Of course! Thanks. I'm starting to feel better already! Well that was easy. Hey, I've an idea! We can settle this battle using our talent and charm! Using what? I'm not following. The school festival. There's a popularity contest. And all I have to do is win! See there's also a contest for the boys, too. And the winners of each contest, usually end up becoming a couple. I know that Shin's a contestant, so if he and I win, I'll become his girlfriend! Each contestant creates a live broadcast and then all of the students vote on it. They vote on it?! That could get ugly. Hm? What do you mean? Look, Xiaoyu! It's about to start. Where is the AV room? I can't believe they're recording these things live! Don't worry about it. I have no doubt that you and I will come in first and second! Shin! It's starting! I'm Shin Kamiya, and this is my entry video. What you're about to watch is a bid like no other for this title. Hey, who the...? Somebody! Help! Wow! He's a really good actor! Uh, that's not acting! That was real! Xiaoyu? Shin! You here? Hey...they're supposed to be recording it live in here. Don't tell me! They weren't recording it live. So what does this mean? It means that there wasn't a live broadcast. And that Shin's already been kidnapped. That clip was like a ransom note. Kidnapped? Ransom note? Activate emergency mode. Code red. Begin protocol. Contact with target Shin Kamiya, lost. Suspect, G Corporation. In contact with possible enemy agent. Awaiting command. Hey, what's with that voice? Hold on. Alisa? Copy. Eliminating agent. What are you... Stop! Mission complete. Roger. Returning to base. Just what on earth are you? There's no data on her at the embassy or with Immigration because she was imported? Alisa Bosconovitch. Mishima Zaibatsu? What? Imported item? Not only do you come back a failure, but now you've reduced yourself to petty thievery. Ugh, Anna. I'll find the specimen. I want you to take care of that nuisance Alisa. You knew she was working for the other side? I wasn't certain yet. We were just waiting each other out until one of us finally blinked. Are you mad? Then find that little girl and destroy her. Can't...breathe... The first friend you made at school is now your enemy. I got your message and accept your challenge. It was all a lie from the very beginning. I failed my mission. It was nice of you to share intel despite my shortcomings. I'm quite grateful. Were you lying when you said you loved Shin? Perhaps. But you lied as well. Right? Alisa? We had our orders. And now I'll complete my mission. Attack mode! Your head?! I have been programmed to destroy you. I can't believe that you're a robot. Battle mode activated. How could a robot know that I was lying?! Exactly. Because I'm not human, I see your flaws. I see your vulnerabilities. I don't believe that for a second! He was kidnapped by the G Corporation, wasn't he? You tell me. You're the one who's good at deception. If you wanna take me out, then just do it already! There's either conflicting data surrounding this or once again, you are lying to me. What good would lying do for me now, huh? I don't trust you. Oh, come on. There's no point in us fighting! Alisa. Alisa? Heat signature detected. Overhead! Saved by the mercy of a robot? What a pathetic heroine you are. Anna. How long were you watching us? Long enough. Well look at this. It's Bosconovitch's robot. You're not what I expected at all. You're with the G Corporation. From whom do you take your orders? Listen scrapheap. I don't just take orders! Now gimme intel. I want all you got on the Mishima Group in that tin-can brain. You don't have proper clearance for that information. I'll jam a cable in your head if I need to. Self-defense systems activate. Must adhere to programming. Xiao...yu... Alisa. Can you move? She's nothing more than a bag of bolts. Forget her. She saved my life. This is the least I can do for her! Feel free to do what you want, but this will make you our enemy. I don't care. Go on, make me your enemy. I was never on your side to begin with. So young and so naive. No turning back now. Then I guess we're done here. Toot-a-loo, dearie. What? What's going on? Thanks, Panda! Emergency escape mode activate! Alisa, this is awesome! Search Unit, you're up. Find them! What is it? Are you sure about this? About what? You know they're gonna come after you too, now. Anna and Kazuya never had my back. What about you? Are you gonna try and kill me next? Actually, it would seem I owe you one. Owe me? No. You saved my butt with that last move. The two of us are even. Well if I'm the one who saved you last, then aren't you the one who's in debt to me again? Isn't that how it works? That will make it go on forever. That's fine with me. I like this. If we owe each other, we have no reason to fight. Right? Well. What a pleasant surprise. Mr. Lee? Excellent! This place is like a castle! Ls this really where you live? It is. My humble abode has 62 bedrooms, 21 full bathrooms, and 18 half-baths. This is what you could call the premiere guest room. Please, make yourselves at home. Feel free to peruse the closet. Whoa, this is like going to the mall. Check it out! You're right. It is. Oh, right. I forgot. Look Alisa, don't do that so much. It's creepy. Here, let me get these for you. Thank you so much, Xiaoyu. So it would appear that the G Corporation isn't the one responsible for the kidnapping. No. And your orders have stayed the same, which means The Mishima Zaibatsu isn't behind it either. So then, who could it be? I don't know. But more importantly, why is everyone after Shin? Nobody ever briefed you on this matter? Guess they felt it wasn't necessary for me to know. Same here. They told me almost nothing. I was simply told to investigate Shin Kamiya and also to gather intel on him and his contacts. Well then, guess we were both pawns in their game. Those orders you received... They came straight from Jin? Negative. They were from Nina Williams. Nina? She works for Jin. They all call her his right hand. You ever met Jin Kazama? No, I haven't. Why do you ask? Oh, no reason. It appears she's doing her own investigation now and ignoring our orders completely. This was my fear. It's why I warned you against using A.I. in the first place. Sometimes in order to succeed, you have to fail. G Corp will try and hone in on her internal transmitter. Fine. That just means we'll have to shut down her network link. We must also find the specimen. You're on your own now. All right, let's see what ghosts from the past turn up this time. So, this was your old school, huh? If Mishima Zaibatsu or G Corp didn't take him, then maybe some kind of clue from his past will tell us who did. Yes, but please remember that I lost my net link, and that includes any access... ...I had to the Mishima Zaibatsu's data. Maybe, but there's more than one way to get info. Yes, that's true. We can learn other things here, too. Like what? Like embarrassing things you did when you were a student here. Well they're aren't any. Now c'mon, start scanning! Who knew my old school had so much going on underground. Well it's protected by a thick shielding making it detectable only by active sonar. It appears to be some kind of research facility. Look. This was where they took this photo. What is with this place? It's like a hospital. The data these machines collect would be used for genetic engineering. Genetic engineering? Like DNA? Can you hack in? Let me give it a try. Oh, no. There's nothing here. All the data has been erased. It's okay. We're not sunk. We still have other tools. Hmm... 78M. Let's see... The seventh bookshelf eight steps away from where we are. It's the medical records. Look. All right. Let's see what's under M. Ha! I knew it! It's the group photo with Shin. This is wonderful. What's that? It seems like there's more. Look at the chalkboard. What's written on it? Perhaps if I scan it I'll find something. Okay? Sure. Writing deciphered. Mutare Experiment. Mutare Experiment? I'll check my internal database. Results: Latin. Definition: to change. The term dates back to the 18th century... ...where it was first used in experiments by botanist and geneticist, Dr. Hugo de Vries. It's from his experiments the term "mutant" was derived. Mutant experiment... It says they were looking for M cells. I can't believe they experimented on students! According to this, the only survivor was... Shin Kamiya. That's it. So then, he's immortal because... Because his genetic code contains the rare M-cell. Which explains why he's being targeted. What's wrong? Like me, Shin is trapped in a body that defies nature. And he too, is thought of as nothing more than a pawn. That says Heihachi Mishima! Then Shin is with Heihachi! Xiaoyu... what's the matter? My god! Xiaoyu, wait! You forgot your shoes! Principal Heihachi Mishima passed away three years ago. He's dead? He once ran Mishima Zaibatsu, but then Kazuya killed him. Heihachi? Kazuya? I can't link this data. For some reason my access has been denied. Heihachi was Kazuya's father. And he's Jin's grandfather. Grandfather? So they span three generations. The Mishima bloodline is all about conflict and rebellion. Fathers and sons hate each other. It's weird. Whenever Jin and Kazuya meet, Heihachi turns up too. So then that means Heihachi... I don't know. But let's find out. "As you suspected, data surrounding Heihachi's death is inaccurate." "Who knows what happened to him..." -Lei. What exactly is Mutare? Will this just mean more bloodshed? I hope not. It's all over for you. Take that! Death Blow, Miracle Launcher? Go, Rocket Fist! I see you don't approve. Then how about... Skyrocket Super Punch! What is this? You think you're a super hero now? All super powers must be named. Those are the rules. Maybe in cartoons it is. When did you two become bosom buddies?! This battle is between humans, so humans can stop it. Alisa? There's still time. If our will is strong enough, we can stop this Mishima family war. Which means if my feelings are honest and true, then I'll be able to rescue Shin. Yes, but are those feelings real or programmed? It's true love. That's what makes someone human, right? You know for a robot, you're kinda cheesy. Oh, look! You're smiling again! All right. I get it, I get it! Thank you. You've been sort of quiet since we got back today. Did getting soaked in the rain make you a bit sad? Well, good evening, my little vermin. It's time for you to be exterminated. Alisa, it isn't the rain. What is it, then? I wonder how much more blood with be shed. Blood? Mishima blood. I'm positive it was Heihachi who kidnapped Shin. I am so out of my league right now. So three generations are going to fight each other over Shin. From the data I can access, there's nothing that describes Jin and Kazuya as father and son. On the contrary, it seems Jin has actually disowned Kazuya as his father. Look, this isn't about raw data. Family relationships are way more complicated! I'm, I'm so sorry. Forgive me. Please. Uh... No, no. I'm sorry. There's one thing I don't understand, though. What is it? Is it wrong for families to fight like this? Huh? I have a father too, you see. It's the professor who built me. Part of my embedded programming is to search for him. But what if my objective... I doubt it's to fight him. Chances are he just wants to see you again. He's your dad. He programmed you to try and find him because he misses you. But the Mishima family... What if he's like they are? Listen, they're not even human now. That's really awful. Xiaoyu? Alisa, you're just like a refrigerator. Huh? When I was a little girl, I'd press my cheek up to the fridge at home. It was kinda warm to the touch and the hum was sorta comforting. How could a refrigerator possibly feel warm? Believe me, Alisa, it was warm. Xiaoyu? Are you recharging now, too? Good night and sweet dreams, Xiaoyu. Sleep well now, my kittens and panda. G Corp is on the move. They got a jump on us. All right. I'll go ahead and restore Alisa's network link then. Give her a fighting chance. Network status linked. What? You're back online now? Cross referencing Heihachi Mishima and Mutare Experiment. Scanning internal documents. Searching classified files from the Mishima Zaibatsu database. Three years ago they acquired a genetic research facility. Searching for specimen transfer locations now. A tomb? The Mokujin Exhibit. Kyoto Castle! Shin's gotta be there, too! I'm afraid your time is up, kiddies. But look on the bright side. At least you've got a nice warm bed to die in. Kill them! Enough! They've escaped! But how? What'?! Well, now. I see you've been busy, Anna. I like my work. It's good to see you, Nina. Man. That was way too close! I'm glad my connection was restored. But I wonder why the feed was suddenly switched back on. Long as you've got full bars, who cares? True. Finding Shin is our only priority! Shin! It's him! Shin! Are you all right? Say something! Are you hurt? Well done, you two. You lured them right in. Lured them here? What do you mean? Thanks to you guys, the time has finally come. Don't look so confused. This is the real bait. World's first immortal cell. I'm cursed with a body that refuses to die. Your organizations have hounded me, vying for this power. But everyone got a little careless. Jin! You came, Jin Kazama. Welcome. Shin Kamiya. I knew you would be searching for this body. All that you want is to stick me under a microscope, so you can have this power for yourself. You'll want to control it Jin, but you can't. Like you want to free the devil inside you. That's the fate for a Mishima man like you, right? Get to your point. Kazuya! Who knew I'd be coming to a kiddy party. Shin, what are you after? You know what I want. I won't last long. I'd be glad to finish you. The stage has been set. It feels good to be back. Hiding in the shadows after you've feigned your own death is a bore. In fact it's down right tedious. I thought I'd thrown you into the depths of hell. Hmph! If you thought that was enough to kill me, you were gravely mistaken. This is quite the reunion. It's been years since we were all under the same roof. It makes my blood boil. Seems you choose your allies poorly. Wrong again! He is nothing but a pawn to me. Fair enough. But don't think you're the only one with a plan in his head. I too, have waited for this. Really? Heihachi Mishima, you are finally within my reach. Go on. Look at what you've created. I know that pattern. There's no mistaking it. You're none other than 78M. I said don't call me that! The Mutare Experiment. Shin. Shin, please stop! You've no idea what this is like. My hatred goes beyond anything you've ever seen! Just be glad you're alive, boy. I allowed myself to be used to bring you all here. It's exactly what I planned. You let them play you like a puppet just to kill me? So you'd feel my full wrath before you die! I've failed. You'd do well to know your place, weakling! I don't wholly despise this hatred of yours. I shall claim my vengeance by spilling the blood of Shin Kamiya! Enough. How low will you go? The depths of hell aren't low enough for me. Know why I did this? Developed the M-Cell, manipulated data, and lured you both here like beasts to a slaughter?! It isn't for immortality. That's not what I'm after. What I desire is power! The absolute power that comes with the Devil Gene! It'll never be yours! I've had enough of you, 78M. It's time for you to die! No! Oh, no! Shin! Shin! You're still here. I never got the chance to properly thank you two. Don't worry about it. It's not important. Shin, why?! I had to. I was running out of time. But now I can die a human. Xiaoyu, there has to be something we can do for him. Jin, it's up to you now. Wh-what? Shin! More blood has been shed. This family is a curse. Jin, tell me! Why did he have to die?! I will put an end to this. Jin! Don't let hatred turn you into a monster! But I am a monster. It's all that's left. You're wrong! Can't you understand? All this fighting is pointless! It's never going to end! It will end with this bloodline. And that is why I fight! Well said. You see, this is our fate. We Mishima live to fight! I've had enough talking. It's time for war! Jin. Just stay outta the way, Xiaoyu. Three generations gathered for a wonderful family reunion. Welcome to the bowels of hell! Your final resting place! Say hello to the bowels of hell. He finally proved to be of some use. Thanks to him, I no longer have to track you down. I hope you like it here. Because it will be your grave. So that's the Devil Gene's true form. The devil gene acts like a catalyst. It strengthens his cellular compounds to ten times that of a normal human. They must have experimented on Shin with Kazuya's blood. And that's the reason Jin wants to end everything. Is this all you've got? Where's that power? Jin, no! Wait, Xiaoyu. Alisa! Don't do this! Emergency programming. I'll handle him. Stupid girl! Get out of my way. Alisa, power down. Enter standby. What did you do to her? Alisa! Hiding behind a doll? You disappoint me, Jin. What have they done? She has nothing to do with this! You're right. She doesn't. That's why I shut her down. This is not a fight for little girls. Yes. It's time I put an end to this. For good. Jin, stop this! You're finally showing your true self. If you want to end the Mishima bloodline, then I have no choice. I must finish you! You're too weak for this. You can't control the Devil's Power. This can't be! I never needed the M-cell. I can control it. What? You're able to control it with reason alone? Now the devil's power is mine. Don't think that this is over. Tell me. You let them get away, didn't you? Are you hurt? I'll be fine. Copy. We'll dispose of this woman and withdraw. Take her to the relief squad. Relief squad? You're letting her live? Yes. It'll prolong her humiliation. Who're you? This house was once my pride and joy. So, you're the owner. Sorry about the mess. Tell me, why bother saving her? Ending the fun so soon would be such a bore, don't you think? Ooh. Excellent! C'mon... Alisa, wake up! No use. If people only understand each other through fighting... Then what was the point of us ever meeting?! Hatred can be suppressed with reason. But you must give in to it at times or it will eat you alive. I can't believe you feel that way, Jin. I will be challenged again someday. There's no doubt. It could be by someone more powerful or it could even be you. Either way, I'll be waiting. Jin. I will gladly be the one to step-up and annihilate you! Kyoto Earth Goddess! Spirits that lie dormant! The time has come for you to rise! It would seem the legend was actually true. Behold! What you see before you is the true form of Kyoto Castle! This is the very reason... that I have drawn you all here! I don't believe it. All the castle trees were Mokujin. As you can see, the legend has finally awoken from its slumber! Its hatred is so strong, it makes the devil seem weak! Now die! You never give up, do you?! Alisa, I can't move anymore. I'm sorry. Hm? What is the problem? Why are you waiting? Hurry up and destroy him! Listen well, Heihachi Mishima. Enough. Stop trifling with that pet and do as I command. We Mokujin have learned something. They have shown us the bonds that exist between humans and their surroundings. What importance is that? You only have one purpose. And that is to follow the commands that I give you. There is no room for compassion in this fight! Does your thirst for power know no limits? Precisely. I will use the power of the Spirits myself! You stand no chance! I can't believe how he's using the Spirits. Why do they keep fighting? It's pointless! Humans should just... Should just disappear! Xiaoyu, stop it. Don't say that. Alisa! I have to say I've grown rather fond of all of you. I learned something from Panda. Let me show you. As your refrigerator, I promise to do my best! Alisa, stop! Skyrocket... Super... Punch! It's time to end this. Now! What? This cursed bloodline must end! Now! Jin. This is the human bond they spoke of. Humanity survived because of her. Because a robot believed in us! Who'd have guessed. You think this is irony? No, this is karma. Only humans can stop their own destruction. If they don't... Reboot system. Exit standby mode. Xiaoyu? Alisa! Jin! I know that one day you will come to defeat me. And I'll be waiting. Know how to achieve world peace? We should get the whole wide world to turn into one big amusement park. So then, your dream is a Global Theme Park? Yup! Then that way everybody will be happy. You know what? Leave that up to me. It's like you're speaking in code again. No, listen. I have data stored for Jin, Kazuya, and Heihachi. Specifically, battle data. If I analyze it then, I might spot a weakness in the Devil Gene. Oh, I get it. So...the Tekken Tournament, huh? Sure! I say we both enter! What? You want me to enter as well? Really? Of course. I mean we're friends, aren't we? Yes, Xiaoyu. We are friends.
