 

                        Today is my first day without her. It's so cold. I'm ashamed of every breath without her. I steal every one. And again and again... No, that's not me. It's just a reason for a photograph. That's how that day began. Katya, have you finished your solo? I can't work like this. Stop. Intermission... Igor, do something with your colleague. She's... she's distracting us... I can hear it, it drills into my head. First volta, second bar. But we agreed at the beginning... we agree, called. Why...? Come here! Come on! Come you shithead! Kolya, please, you can see he's drunk. I'll kill him. She's a simple girl, plays the cello. I'm going crazy about him, you know? During sex, she never closes her eyes. You know that kind of look... She's very strong. I'm even afraid sometimes. I want him. I don't know how this whole story will end, but... We'll definitely never forget one another. Open up... Open up... Open the door! Open up... Open the door! Help me. Help! Help me! Open up! Hello. Hi. Are we not mistaken, do you really exchange an apartment for love here? Actually you may keep your love, if you really have it. Anything else? Yes, please, fresh orange juice and coffee. Yes, of course... excuse me. Don't worry, it happens. So, what do we have here with the apartments? Put away your gun. Roman... So. We have to decide about the apartment... Uh-huh. First about the apartment, shall we? Go ahead, I'm all ears. Go ahead... Go ahead... First, there's that crazy old woman with her small flat in the slum and the old KGB colonel... You know, I'd prefer some old woman without any superstitions, and a three-room apartment, in the center of the city, for the same price. Miracles don't happen. Of course they do. No, they don't. - They do. In matters of housing, definitely not. Although, for those who believe in miracles... an apartment in in the center of the city with a bank account. Only those really in love are welcome to apply. Phone number and address. An interesting offer, but not enough. For love - it's very little. But Roman, you yourself wanted it. You are so sly! Don't shoot me any more. Please... Listen, let's go to my place. It's so nice there. I've got half a bottle of whiskey, fresh bathrobes... we'll draw a bath ...launch your boat and... Let's go! Then it's either the old woman or the colonel. Katya, listen, I stopped believing a long time ago in all these free apartments, trips to the Canary Islands, dollars... and you know why? No, I don't. Because in any country, in any city, in any spot on the globe you ought to remember one thing: "Free cheese can be only in a mousetrap." Don't you know that? All these stories end very simply - You get your money taken away, that's all. Stupidly, cynically, routinely, understand? Do you love me? First of all it's a game. You can't come in. The game has rules. The first rule: No contacts with the outside world. No TV, no phone, no pager - no contact at all. Rule number two: You live in this apartment together. This game is for those who need only each other. It's so easy to live... I can hear you. You can hear me. Tell me... Was it always this way? Always. I don't want to be a mystery. But I want to remain enigmatic. Don't ask me what you don't want to hear. And I'll answer all of your questions. So, what's the prize? After my death you become the owners of the apartment and of all my savings. Around two hundred thousand euros. And I have only about Maybe less... (make me happy) You'll receive a letter informing you of my death... This will mean the game is over. And you will become owners of all my property. Okay, I got it. We'll think it over... Thank you in advance. Katya, let's go. Once I left too. And I never had a second chance. And? My lover died in that apartment. Well, I hope there's no blood on the walls Or brains smeared all over the titles. I gave him a piano. The piano was delivered in the rain in that container. That day we found out he had AIDS. Every morning he nailed a board to the window. When the window disappeared... so did I. So, it's a choice between an old Advetist-woman and a surrealist old man. Stop it. Okay, okay. But damn it, we have to know where we're going to live?! Yes. But candor for candor. I also have the right to know who's going to live in my apartment and spend my money. Okay. How did you meet? In a tram. No. it was earlier. In a hospital. Don't. What? It's raining anyway. You love. Why? That's it. Come here, a bit closer. You know, I've got this feeling we'll part soon. Why? Katya. Stop. I don't think so. I think we're doing to live like in a fairy tale, a long and happy life, and die on the same day. Because our guardian angels have already arranged it. Now it's up to us. Let's not look ahead. You know, when there's too much of everything around, I run. From yourself? No, towards myself. You're crazy! You're not afraid of anything. I'm afraid of everything. Really. I'm afraid of cars. When I was a child, my parents and I were in a car crash. And ever since then, I've been very afraid. Then after the orphanage, I was afraid of people. Didn't know how to talk to them. Thought they looked down on me. Especially strangers. Never knew how to approach them, what to begin with. They all laughed at me and made fun of me. This is what helps me understand people from within. This is my weapon. Bang! Killed! But most important I've got hope now to open the doors to myself, to understand who I really am. Now that's a character. I don't want this piano to play. Let it be our table. It's not an instrument at all. Where do you see a piano here? What, there's a piano here? Can it be... it could be our table... What is it? It's definitely not rain. Come here. Rule number three: You are not to leave the apartment. There's a video camera above the front door. You can leave the apartment only once. Once and forever. Roman, what are you doing? Roman... - I'm thinking. Listen, let's go for a walk! Let's go see what's happening outside. We'll take some pictures and then come back. Come on, get dressed! Roman! Now what? I'll go alone if you like. I'll be back soon... Roman, but what... what about the apartment? What about the apartment? What will happen to it? I'll jump for ten minutes - and be back. I'll be quick. So... Camera Okay, bye. I'll be quick. Katya, where's the key? The door is locked. The door is locked. You hear me? Hey? Katyusha? I have it. Give it to me quickly. Please. Give me the key. Roman, you can leave. But only once... once. Sweetie, why such conditions? I'll jump out for a bit, take some shots and come back. Katya, listen, give me the key, please. Do you hear what I am saying? I want to go out. Katya, I wanna go out! Give it to me! Roman! Roman! No! Let's play. Just for ten minutes. Okay, I'm sorry. Honey, forgive me. Do you hear me? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Stop it. Understand how important this is for me. Hear me? You love your instrument, you love your music, and I love my work the same way. You hear? It's so simple. Truly. Please, understand me. I have to go. Go. Go? Go... Katya, it's so important for me! This is very important for me! Why was I trying so hard to explain this to you? Why did I open my soul to you? For you to understand anything? Anything! Don't set any conditions for me! I'm a free man! I'm used to it and I can't live any other way! Can not! It's always the same thing. Why should I be forced to choose? Goddamn it. I don't eat meat. Are you hiding something? In general, yes. But not now. How did you happen to be in the hospital then? I just wanted to see what hides inside a person when he's always in fear and doubt. But still believe up until the last moment. And at the same time I did some tests so thy would let me in. I wanted to shoot such a picture, you know... And you? I just heard a lot in school. I have never done a full set of tests, to check out everything, and all at once. Why don't you look at me while I'm sleeping? What? But I do. Then why don't I feel it? Do what? Unbelievable... I don't feel it. Don't feel it? Do you feel that? Choose. I'm dazzled. Collect you thoughts. Choosing a sea is a very important decision. The most important is that we have a wide choice. Where have you been? I have been everywhere. I've been photographing since I was 16. I look for interesting faces all over the world. People are interested in what they cannot see. Things that arouse keen interest. War for instance. Is it interesting for you? What do you know about war? I see. It's such a word..."war" But what it means... ...is unclear. Imagine... a double-page spread: a street skirmish in progress, not even a skirmish, a real gun fight. Flesh. Nearby children are running across the street. In the crosswalk. That's detail. I want... what do I want? I want people to believe you. That's why, if you want the viewer to feel a little sad, you yourself must weep over the photo... Roman... Roman... What? And that's how you've been all around? It's always different, not always so extreme. Sometimes even fun. You probably have a girl in every country. Sometimes even two. Go ahead, choose. Which sea is the loudest? The loudest? I don't know, they are all loud. I want to go, Where I can hear only your voice. What are you doing there? Music. I'm watching you sleep, how you breath... so quiet, like the sea in the morning. What sounds does the sea make? The same that you do. In the morning it's so quiet, and then it becomes louder and louder... You've never been to the sea. What lies are you telling me here? I saw you! Leave me alone! I'll punch you in the eye! Crazy girl. Who's there? Hey, mail. Ah, where is that long expected letter? Here, this is for you. Bills, bills, bills. Why did I give anyone this address? This one's for you. From the editors of "The Extreme World". Must be a check. The conservatory - I must've been expelled. Look! Oh, congratulations! It's so good that I gave them the address. What's this? From the clinic. Your test results, where are mine? Here they are, all of them. No, no, no. Let me read yours, and you read mine. Ok? Right, bloodsugar - did they prick your finger? Yes. - Well your sugar's okay. Is my urine normal? - It is. Platelets? - Normal. Leucocytes? - Normal. Syphilis? I don't understand... I'm kidding! I can account for all of my relationships. Let's go, AIDS, negative... Well... Roman, Did you feed the fish? No. I can't find the fish food. I'm hungry, let's eat something. Not too hot? Pleasantly spicy. I'll get it. I'll get it. It's sweet. It doesn't matter. Leave it. I'll clean it up. Roman, sit down. Katya. Please, don't. We're together. There's no more "us". Why are you talking such nonsense? Where did that come from? You're here, I'm here. What are you saying? Get it out of your head. What do you feel? - You. You're lying. You're already thinking how not to offend me... Stop it. - not to say too much... My sweet baby, stop it. We love each other. I love you. We are together. Look. Why torture the fish? This is us. Katya, It doesn't matter how long you live, but how you live. Take the jar away. Things will never be the same. Do you know why I went to the hospital? Do you want me to tell you? - You don't have to say anything. Coward. You can't do anything for - Enough! I've had enough! Look at her! She's decided everything! It's me that's decided! I wondered, why she like those ribbed condoms so much! What, did you save me? Did you save me, Mother-Theresa? You come here listen to me carefully, I want you. I want you right now. If you're not brave enough, I'll find enough lust! Come on! Shout! It will happen, whether you want to or not. Forgive me. Forgive me. Help me. I see the game is over. Please, help me. You can only go out once. Those are the rules of the game. You can not return. Please, I want to go back to her. Go back. But in any case, game over. Only you can help me. Unfortunately. How? That's the first question. The second - what's in it for me? The game turned out to be not very lucky. Infect me... hear me? You have to help me! I don't owe you anything. Scum! What do you know about love? You left your love to die alone - I don't want to do the same! That's not true. - It's true! It's true! Yes, it's true. You say you're running away, unable to stop. Well, I don't want to run. You're already running away. It's true. But it's easier for you. You're practically at the finish line. I still have a long way to run. You can make one last bet. But on one condition. Okay, What is it? If I win, you must go on living... Shall we play? Let's play. Did you talk to her? It's pointless. Yes, I know. Well, let us trust in fortune. So, let's play: zero or one. Life or death. Hi. I brought you some oranges. I broke the juicer. Let me fix it. It's not worth the trouble. I see you've been quite busy. Is it cold outside? Noisy. I've packed your things. I can see. Everything is alright. What is 'alright'? Everything is alright. We're together, so, everything is alright. Who's together? What's alright? Roman? Roman, I beg you. Please, don't start. I missed you so much, I haven't seen you for such a long time. And now you are here, with me, it's so great! Damn, it's so great! We're together. Nobody is going to come between us anymore. We're the same. We're the same. I don't understand, Roman. We're together. You are so beautiful, so beautiful No... my baby... Roman! You idiot! Roman, you! What have you done! Roman! What have you done!!! You think you are a hero? You think this is some extreme sport? I love you! There is nothing left... There is no life left! My girl. I can't go on like this, I can't... Seems that our guardian angels forgot about us. (Our apologies... ) (Your HIV test... negative... )
