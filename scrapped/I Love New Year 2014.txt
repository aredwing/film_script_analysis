The same old sky-scraper buildings, matchbox homes.. "The same old numbered streets. The same old McDonalds, Starbucks at every corner of the city. And the same old routine life in this standardized city. Unaccounted moments in the office..alone! The same old fast-food lunch..on the go. And the same old coffee. Vanilla Mocha. On the go. This routine never changed. "But now I intend to change it. Now..no more office on Sundays. No more fast food lunch. And favorite coffee.

So this is your New Year's gift. This? Thank you and goodbye. Goodbye for what, lshaan? What for? That's why? I've seen enough of your third-rate drama. I don't know him, ask him. He's lying on this bed..in his underwear. And you don't know him. WOW! This story keeps getting better every minute. But no thank you. I don't want to hear it anymore. - lshaan. Ishaan, you will have to listen. This is not my fault. Actually, it's not her fault. Why is he giving explanations? Why? So that I break his face.. ...and you feel that lshaan's cheap, like us. So no problem. Ishaan, you're calling me cheap. I am not cheap. He came here coincidentally. Actually, he and his friends are alcoholics. So you know his friends, and their habits too. How long has this been going on? Nothings going on. He came here coincidentally. Nothing going on. He came here coincidentally. - Yes, I did. Romi was supposed to come. - Shut up!

Only you! Look..l can explain. What? This? Anything else? Let me go. - lshaan, give me a chance to explain. After that you can do anything you like. But let me speak. Go on. Actually, he and his friends are drunkards. They had too much to drink today..and made him board the flight. Oh, I am so stupid. - His friends.. There was a airplane in the gym. It was at the airport, not the gym. - Shut up! No, actually they went to the airport. ...and his friends made him board the flight. And then he..got here in his drunken state. Actually, his address is same as mine. 309 West, 7A. But his is in Chicago, not New York. You say the address is same. - Yes. But how did he get in the house and your bedroom? Ishaan, he had the key. You gave him your house keys? No. - You never gave me in all these months. Ishaan, he used his own house keys. I wasn't even here, lshaan. He got here accidentally. Oh..so he got to your home accidentally. He accidentally took his clothes off. And accidentally fell asleep on your bed. And you made a mistake thinking that he made a mistake. And now..you want me to sit on the pile of these mistakes. Oh, God! Oh, God? Look, Miss. Miss. Forget it. Let me explain. On every New Year.. The guy's in your bedroom. "But doesn't know your name. What moral fiber? Amazing. Ishaan. Whose morality are you talking about? How can you accuse me with someone? Have you seen his condition? He's a drunkard. He's got no clue where he's going. He's a joke. Right..l am just a joke. Please don't ruin your New Year for this drunkard. But believe me.. "This key fits the lock. And the address is 309.. - Get out! Sorry. Hi, Happy New Year. New Year! Ishaan. - What were you thinking, Tikku? Some drunkard was lying on your bed.. And you're kindly showing him the way out. Rather than calling me or the police. Like normal people. Ishaan, I thought he's Jas. - Now who is Jas. Talking about me? I am Jas. How the hell.. Who the hell.. Sorry, Vidya's boyfriend. - Yes.. Vidya said there's no one at home so I came by. I am sorry about that. And she even gave me the keys. - Yeah, I know. Hold on, I'll get the dress and passes. Yes, please..you know, I am getting late. Nice suit, man. - Who asked you? Here. - Thank you. You're welcome. - Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Thank you. You gave everyone the keys, except for me. Right? I didn't, Vidya did. - Alright, Vidya. Don't be angry. Why does this happen only with you? Why? No drunkard would dare to barge in my house. But you? Why does he get in your home? I don't know. - What are you? A child. It's because you're careless. You're always prancing around..like a buttery. You've no idea what's happening around you. Do be.. - I don't want to be angry. But you make me angry. Excuse me, is this really New York? You really shouldn't drink so much, man. Excuse me. Can I borrow some money? No! Why is everyone asking for a handout? It's New Year. New York! Ishaan. Look what I am wearing. Ishaan. "Come to me.." "Come to mesweethean." "Don't be upset, beloved." "For my sake, sweetheart" This aloofness will definitely kill me. "Come to me.." "Come to mesweethean." "Don't be upset, beloved." "For my sake, sweetheart" This aloofness will definitely kill me. Who did you make these for? You know I don't like sweets. You said..let's take the nuptials rounds.. "..With you right now." "Why are there tears..in my eyes now?" "Tell me.." "Tell me..please." "Didn't you promise me?" "l am always where you are." "So why this distance between us?" I have no money. I've heard about the craving for love. "But no one's craved like me." "l walked for miles and realized.." "There's no place like home." "Turn around.." Turn around..my arms are yearning for yours. "L am treading on your path." Take me in your arms, and fill this void. "Where are the paths?" "Who cares where we'll go?" "Who knows..take me to.." "..where the hean roams free." "Come to me.." "Come to mesweethean." "Don't be upset, beloved." "For my sake, sweetheart" This aloofness will definitely kill me. Stop crying, okay. Open your new year's gift. Ishaan, do you trust me? What if you had seen me in a similar condition? A girl..in my bed. Would you trust me? If you were holding a gun, and a dead body lying in front of you. I will still think you're innocent. Because I know..you can never do anything wrong. I trust you. Even after all that happened, I am still here. I didn't go anywhere. What more do you want? - But, lshaan.. Leave it now, please. Stop discussing this. Open your gift, and make me happy. Perfume! Limited edition. - Like it? Awesome. I've a gift for you as well. It's in the bedroom, I'll go get it. Another gift..in the bedroom.

I'll pay you back as soon as I get to Chicago. Send it through wire transfer. You two have my address as well. Yes, we do have your address. So what's the problem? You're in trouble. And you're an Indian. We should lend you the money. Right, Tikku? I think we should. If you say.. I'll get it right now. Okay? - Okay. Thank you. You can give this excuse to someone else. What's the real deal here? Why do you always come back here? Look..l genuinely need money. - Why? Is this a donation camp? Tell me honestly..where are you from? I told you everylhing inside. Tell me everylhing again, from the beginning. Come on, man..from the beginning. Look, every year.. ...l and my friends meet at the Health Club on 31st December. But this year..l drank too much because. Because? Because my marriage was fixed. - With whom? A girl, who else? Look..l came here by mistake, honestly. Let me tell you how genuine your mistakes were? You went to the gym, didn't you? Were you sober or was that a mistake? - I was sober. Were you sober when you had a drink or was it a mistake? I was sober. And did you get to the airpon by mistake or in your senses. I was still in my senses. But I wasn't completely in my senses. I had to drop Romi at the airport So you didn't do anything by mistake. You were still in your senses. Ask what happened next? I got on the plane by mistake. - Oh yeah. Airplanes have special reservations for drunkards. I have to find that out too. How could they let me board? I don't get it. - You don't get it. You don't know who you're messing with. I work at the Treasury Department. I'll file tax abetment charges against you.. ...and get you deported forever. Send you to India. You'll keep sobbing for the rest of your life. Got on the plane by mistake. Are you blind? Got in this house by mistake. Even got on the bed by mistake. And by mistake, your bedroom cunains will have flowers on them. And your sofa must be brown. Stay inside. - What happened? Nothing. Stay! Stay inside! Let it be, I'll manage. I mistook New York for Chicago. The house is a small thing. Believe me, I was not in my senses. Not in your senses. You just admitted that you were in your senses. You're a big fraud. Ishaan. Ishaan, don't spoil your mood. Take this money and leave. Let's go inside. One gets paid for spending time in your bedroom? You never told me that. So why throw me out. I could've made some extra money. What are you saying? You've crossed all limits. Do you know what you're saying? - I do now. Everyone said "Avoid single girls of New York". If you want to settle down, check her family background. But it was my mistake. Your sweet voice and great figure deceived me. Excuse me. I am sorry. I don't want this money. Oh, how sweet. You could've at least waited until I left. Ishaan..you're leaving me? Yes. This aloofness will definitely kill me. I am sorry. What did you say? What did you say? You ruined everylhing! I told him what I told you. I told him the truth. Don't worry, I'll go get him. Ishaan! Come on, lshaan..be reasonable, man. Stop, lshaan! Ishaan! Come on, stop. Ishaan! Ishaan..you made her cry. Ishaan! "Come to mesweethean." Miss. His car was too fast. I couldn't stop him. Your friends, family..shall we call someone?

What is all this? What kind of girl are you? Even after everylhing that happened.. ...you're still celebrating. You're still happy. Why? Yes! Because I am a foolish, silly, stupid, delicate type of girl. But..the President of Unlucky Club.. ...has a solution to everylhing. And the solution for depression is Chocolate'. Eat chocolate, and it fixes everylhing. But you haven't seen the ring yet. The ring's inside this. Here's the ring, and now we're engaged. What a silly.. - Oh no! Who's there? You're back again.

You left me here alone.. ...and went to your ex in New York? Aren't you ashamed? If you wanted to dump, you could've just said it clearly. What dump, Riya? I'm the one who's been dumped..in New York. So stay dumped in New York. And I'll even send your papa there too. You two can stay dumped in New York..together. And I am not there either. So you'll be happy. Where are you going? It's not like that. - It's exactly like that. Son said yes and papa said no. And let his son elope to New York. I'm leaving your house-keys behind. But. And don't think that I'll waste even a minute regretting. Because..there's a queue outside my house. But don't bother to join that queue. Or else I'll clobber you black and blue. Understand. But we were supposed to get. - Goodbye. Sorry! Here. My story ended with a clobbering. Nothing serious for men. You can find many more Riyas. But I am not like one of those. It took me really long to find one nice girl. Ishaan! You should always be positive. Those who get angry quickly, also calm down real soon. Go on. Go! Hold on. If lshaan sees me here, he'll be upset. Where can I hide? - No need to hide anywhere. Just sit here quietly. Wait! All the best. Hi. What's up? - Baby. Happy New Year, ma'am. Happy New Year, Tweety. Happy New Year, baby. - Happy New Year, dear. You too. - Congratulations. Thank you. We thought we should wish you too. No, actually..lshaan and I want to.. Ishaan. Let's wish your fiance as well. Ma'am. - Come, come, come, baby. Tweety, look at him. - Looking. He's nice. - Yes. Very nice. Handsome too. Isn't he a bit simple? Jeans on his engagement? Simple men are best. The ring should be big enough. Right, Tikku. Where's the ring? Ma'am, we didn't get engaged yet. - You didn't. Well.. Ishaan's flight got delayed. Bad weather, you see. - Delayed. So you should say like that. I was wondering what does "Not yet engaged" meant? Anyway, this is for you. - Thank you. Non-alcoholic. This is also for you. Thank you, ma'am. It's okay. Now mama is here. Things always happen for the best. We'll get you two engaged. No problem. Tweety, call up Mr. Khan and tell him to come here. Quickly. Done. Hello. Mr. Khan. - Tweety.. Please come down here, at Tikku's home. Yes, bring everyone along. Good you invited over everyone. Allahwonderful. So sweet! So charming. I had a big desire to meet you. I've heard lot of praises from Tikku. Mine? Really? Oh..introductions first. This is Khanum, Tikku's boss. And I am Tikku's colleague, Tweety Chawla. I am Tikku's adopted mama. Mama. - Mama. She adopted me, and I adopted her. Right? I'll just get it. - Yes. Actually, Tikku and I made a plan. You see. I hope you will like it too. He will..of course he'll like it. Is everylhing alright? - Of course. Come in. Meet him. This is my husband. Mr. Khan. Hello. - And that one at the back..is Bashruddin. Hello. Naima..Abida..Nasir..Firoza, lmran.. Imran, lmran.. And I am lmran too. - Yes, of course. Since there are so many lmrans.. ...there has to be one lmran Khan. Dear, why did you call us here? Why? We've to get Tikku and lshaan engaged. Ishaan? - Yes. But where's lshaan? He's so funny. He's got a sense of humor. Ishaan, come on. This is not the time to joke. He's funny. So funny. Let's first get you two engaged.. ...and then we'll together search for lshaan. Good sense of humor. I like it. What are you doing? Why are you calling me lshaan? What. Why will I make you lshaan? Who do you think you are? You think" - Hello..conversation in private. Shave. You look more handsome. Until then I'll help her freshen up. Come on. Randhir..don't say a word. Let things proceed as they are. - But. No! It's imponant for you to know.. ...others don't treat me the way lshaan does. I am quite respected. ...and especially, in the school where I work. I'll even be the principal next year. I'll get promoted. Please don't say anylhing. Or else my impression will be completely ruined. Please.. - I won't say anylhing. What do you want? We should get engaged..to save your impression. So..you want to say that you won't help me? So should we get engaged? You see..l just got out of a relationship. I don't like to get into commitments. I don't like what's happening. You think I like this. You're standing in my bathroom with lshaan's shaver. And you think I like it. What's lshaan's shaver doing in this bathroom? Ishaan's shaver will stay in this bathroom. And all his things will stay right here. I see..where's lshaan now to help you out? When lshaan didn't help me, why would you? I'll tell them the truth myself. Thank you. Hold the veil like this. - Hold it up.. Ma'am, I've to talk to you. - Not now.. "Do Re Me Fa So La." "Do Re Me Fa So La." "No one said a word." "Or revealed this secret." - But you.. "Could you be the one?" "Could you be the one?" "One for me." 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4..3, 2, murder 1.. "Love's at the door." "Hear the soft footsteps." "Here comes trouble." "Try to understand." "..the delicate situation." That. - Everyone thinks I am crazy about you. Why.. - Because all my happiness stans with you. Love.. - This is what everyone says..says to me. What.. - Say that you feel the same about me. "You.." "Are you the one?" "The one my hearl's..crazy for." "And my feet are staggering." No one knocked on the door of your hean like this. Now that you're here..there's a hustle-bustle everywhere. "Nothing happened between you and me." But still..the earth keeps slipping from under my feet. You.. - Whether you ask me or not, but I'll have to tell you. L.. - Whatever you do now, the head's crazy about you. Love.. - This is what everyone says..says to me. What.. - Say that you feel the same about me. "You.." "Are you the one?" "The one my hearl's..crazy for." "And my feet are staggering." 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4..3, 2, murder 1.. "Love's at the door." "Knock, knock, knock we go bonkers." Knock, knock, knock we're show-stoppers. Tonight we're gonna blast the speakers. "Scream out loud and lose your voice." I was holding a blank paper in my hands. "But you filled it with many colors." Why did the hean blossom and staned humming. Why wait for another lifetime for such happiness? You.. - Can turn around whenever you like and take a look. L.. - I'll walk up and cuddle back in your arms. Love.. - This is what everyone says..says to me. What.. - Say that you feel the same about me. "You.." "Are you the one?" "The one my hearl's..crazy for." "And my feet are staggering." Tikku. So, lshaan, isn't Tikku really special. But life's been really unfair with her when it came to families. But still..she's always smiling, cheerful. Tikku's a sunshine child. And Allah has blessed her with a reward. Otherwise, how could she find a groom like you.. ...from that bloody Matrimonial Ad? No! But see..you two did meet. Now lshaan, you have to wipe the tears behind that smile. ...and fill the void with a family. Right, lshaan. Won't you take good care of Tikku? Good. Bless you, Tikku. Thank you. - Bye, Tikku. Thank you so much. Bye. Thank you so much. - Bye. What a nice man. I really like him. He's a gem. Thank you, ma'am. Congratulations. Why did you do it? What else could I do? If I told them the truth.. ...you would've never become the Principal. That's why. Congratulations for what? Everyone wished us on our engagement. But we didn't wish each other. Very funny. Exchanging rings mean nothing. Think of it as some scene from the movies. Take the ring out and dump it. What has the world come to? First the girl insists you to get engaged. And then..she chucks the ring away and breaks it. Here, you do it. Just to remind you.. ...you insisted for this engagement, not me. Yes..but now we got to think" ...how we'll introduce them to the real lshaan. We? - Yes. This is not our problem, it's just my problem. Ishaan's gone. And I guess this chapter is over. I'll make any excuse. I'll tell them that lshaan rejected me. You mean..l rejected you. - Not you, lshaan did. But..when they talk about lshaan, they will think of me. So what's the problem? The problem is that only a fool can reject you. But why do you want that fool to be me? I made such a good impression on them. Didn't you hear? They called me a gem. If you had barged in their home.. "They would've called you a thief. Not a thief, a poor unfortunate guy. All thieves are unfonunate. Can I open one of these gifts? - No. I have to return all this. Well, legally half of it belongs to me. And by the way, I never saw anyone return gifts. I love this track. Can we hear it once before you return it? I do have a right to a dance on New Year's. May l'2 Pink Chiffon.. Clown! Years later, when we think about this new year.. ...we'll have a big laugh. Yes, when you got up you said.. You're Dolly-Pauli right? What are these flowers? And you should've seen your face when you fell down. It was like this. But the best was "Where's my mama's crockery?" "Where's my mama's crockery?" very funny. Yes, but no one sell's mama's crockery on Ebay. Can I ask something? - Yes. Did you buy those Reindeer shorts especially for Christmas? Can I come in? Are you angnl? I won't yell at you anymore. He's still here. Oh..so you were listening to music, I see. Very nice. I've switched off the music, happy? Can we talk inside for a minute? Why is he still here? I am ready to hear this time. - This time? Stop making a scene, Tikku. Tell me the reason, that's it. He wanted to call Chicago. I told him he can call from here. Has he finished calling? - Yes. Good. Ask him to leave. No! - Why? Because he helped me when you left me. Would you like to know how? Not at all. Because all this is just a story. Tell him to go. Why? Why should I always do what you want? You don't want to send him away. Tikku, what's going on between you two? You tell me. - lshaan, don'tstarl again. Tell me. Ishaan, you're huning me. Tell me. What's going on between you two? - lshaan. Tell me. - Leave. Leave her. Get out. Do you how much she was crying after you left? Forget it, Randhir. - No, he'll have to apologize. Say sorry. Okay..you're right. He's right. Okay. Here's my 8PI9V- Hey Doesn't apologize and also ruined the kid's butteries. Come on, say sorry. - Here's my sorry. I didn't tell you to hit me, I told you to say sorry. - Really. Say sorry. Ishaan. - What are you doing? You broke the window. Ishaan. You two messed my house. You have to say sorry. Come on, get up. - Randhir, stop it. Come on. Say, Tikku, I am sorry. Tikku? Earlier he was calling you Miss. Now it's Tikku. Stop it. Randhir, stop it. - Leave my hand. Please leave him. Please? Please leave him. Please. - Fine, I'll leave him. Say sorry now. Sorry my foot. Ishaan. - Say sorry. Say sorry. Ma'am, is this yours? - Oh yes. Is there a problem here? No..no problem. Everylhing is okay. Hey..move! Say.. - Hold it. Why call the police? I could've dealt with him. Ma'am, are these guys bothering you? Would you like to press charges? Yeah, charge him. Both of them. - Right? Both. Okay, put your hands behind your back. Both of you. I will never forget this New Year. Move. He staned the fight, but I am sorry. Any problem, call us ma'am. Move. Come on, move. Get in, come on. Move. Get in. Get in there. Shut up. Come on. Come on, get out of there. Hurry UP- Come on, ladies, move it. Quit talking. Come on, move. Come on. What are you waiting for? Come on. What's that? Keep this. Alright. Thanks. Come on, move. - Move out. Move. Come on. He's cute. Okay, yes. My jail story is coming to an end. I am going home. Won't you ask how? Money. If you've money, even/thing's clear. No need for money. We'll be out in a while. H ow? Tikku will come bail us out. You're an expen on Tikku now. Give me the money. - Hey man, where's that money? Give it to me. Come on. Where's the money? Come on, slugger. Even I like breaking faces! What's going on here? - Nothing. Yeah, right. Okay, you're free. Let's go. You're out of here. Let's go, move. - Don't forget to say sorry. Who cleared us both? The lady from the house. You should thank her. Next time no brawling on New Year. Hey, Gary, we need you over here. Sorry. Sorry? For getting him out of jail again. And sorry so that I forget everylhing and forgive you. We can discuss this in private. Why? Since last year this has been a three-ringed circus. Excuse me. Ishaan, I am sorry.. I couldn't be the girl that could make you happy. Not just me.. You can't make anyone happy. You like living alone. You don't get along with families. That's why everyone leaves you. And I'm going too. Because you and me are finished. Shall I drop you home? Here's the money. And take this taxi to Chicago. First I'll drop you home.. ...and then I'll go. Tikku..should I go? Excuse me, sir. Sir..l got to go. - Yeah! Thank you. You see..l just got out of a relationship. I don't like to get into commitments. What do you want to say? You won't help me. Now lshaan, you have to wipe the tears behind that smile. ...and fill the void with a family. Right, lshaan. Won't you take good care of Tikku? Randhir. Why are you sitting here? I left my keys in the house. I am waiting for Vidya. Here. - What's this? Keys..one I used to get in. Are these keys..or a bundle of trouble? Thank you. See you there. - Bye. Tikku. If you ever come to Chicago, do drop in. I know the address. BYe- - Bye. Tikku. Randhir, you're just looking for excuses to stay. Actually, I got clobbered all day. And no one offered me anything to eat. And I am very hungry. Will you eat? Thanks. Food and coffee at 4am. Great. I made it to impress someone. I am impressed. I have an off today, no hurry to go back to Chicago. So I thought why don't I go back in the evening. I'll see New York today. With you? With me? But I didn't invite you. So do it now. Why? Why not? - Why should l? Now you can invite me. This will stay here. At least let him stay amongst the books. No! It will stay here. Randhir. Randhir. What are you doing? What did you say? Why will you invite me? I don't want to hear anylhing. Randhir, go down now and get that photo. Never. You won't go? You know..you're audacious. I did become this year..in New York. In New York? - Yes. You mean..l made you audacious. - Yes. And I like it. But I don't like it. Go bring it back up now. No? Fine, you can lie there..like shameless. I'll go and get lshaan's photo. If anythings stolen from my house, I'll show you. I know your address. Excuse me. What are you doing? Wait a minute? Give me your foot. Why? Did you work at a shoe-shop? This often happened when I used to get angry. Give it a tug and it'll be fine. It's okay if I go out in this cold, but not you. To get his photo, never. Fine, stay here then. Shameless. "L wonder why..you dwell in my heart." "Why did l..keep thinking about you?" Your image keeps floating in my eyes. "My lips only mention your name." "l want to hold your hands." "..and keep walking for miles." "Come to me." "Come to me." As night spreads across..it's hard to forget. "Come to me." "Come to me." "l want to hold your hands." "..and keep walking for miles." "Come to me." "Come to me." The night spreads across..it's hard to forget. "Come to me." "Come to me." "l want to tell you.." ...things that I didn't even tell God. Your memoriessurround me all the time. "Since the time we met." "What is this all about?" "Slumber's missing from my eyes." "My eyes..are the witness." "l want to hold your hands." "..and keep walking for miles." "Come to me." "Come to me." As night spreads across..it's hard to forget. "Come to me." "Come to me." Hey..who are you? You will break Tikku's umbrella. If you want to break my head, use this. You know Tikku. I know you too. "L want to hold your hands." "..and keep walking for miles." "Come to me." "Come to me." The night spreads across..it's hard to forget. "Come to me." "Come to me." "l want to hold your hands." "..and keep walking for miles." "Come to me." "Come to me." The night spreads across..it's hard to forget. "Come to me." "Come to me." Yeah, we argued, but then" ...l just threw the photograph. HaPPY New Year! Happy New Year! - Hey, baby. What a story, buddy? Same house, same key.. This can happen only in New York. And that too, on New Year. Totally awesome, right? But..you took so long to come up. Good job, Randhir. I'll go meet Jas. Isn't it great I found lshaan's.. Randhir! Tikku. Tikku. Why are you crying? I hate you. I want you to go away. You're lying. I am lying? Iam lying- How do you know I am lying? What do you know about me? What do you know.. Why are you so shameless? I've become one..since I met you. - Why? "L wonder why..you dwell in my heart." "Why did l..keep thinking about you?" Your image keeps floating in my eyes. "My lips only mention your name." Before he breaks down the door, I'll see who it is. "L want to hold your hands." "..and keep walking for miles." "Come to me." "Come to me." It's me. I am the one breaking down the door. How can I go without wishing you new year? Happy New Year, baby. Ishaan. I can walk. Excuse me. Ishaan, what are you doing? Taking a steam bath. Please stop it, lshaan. Please. You can say please 100 times, but I won't stop. Get out! At least take off your coat. I'll take my steam bath with the coat on. What do you care? Mr..Waah-Waah! Her new name. I kept it on New year. What a great guy. Every new year he goes to the gym. At the gym, he drinks a lot because he's getting married. Then..they dump him..on a plane. And Mr. Waah-WaahJands in another city. And.. In the other city.. ...he meets someone else. He forgets his girl in Chicago. ...and settles down with his new found love in Chicago. What are the thoughts of.. "The President of the Unlucky Club? Good name, huh! I gave her that. Wherever she goes, bad luck follows. Enough. You can taunt me all you like, nothing more. 0K8'!- I can praise you, right? Fair deal. Tikku. Tikku. Tikku. In this single night, you can cross-off your past. "But not make a future for yourself. And not with a fraud. The key fitted, my foot. Have you ever heard such a DUII-S story? Ishaan! Ishaan, don't go out. It's cold. Ishaan! Ishaan! It's cold outside. What if you catch pneumonia? So what? It'll be better than your company. I'll stay myself out. Randhir, please go. I don't know what I am doing? But I know this is all wrong. Yesterday I was with someone else.. ...and now I'm with. No! If papa had been here, he would say.. "Tikku, you're wrong." "No one likes a girl like that." "No one." I do. - But I don't. Please go away. I beg of you.. ...please go away. Don't say, please. Please! Fine..l am going now. But I will wait for you. I will wait until you don't come. "What is this separation?" "There are tears in my eyes." My head's drowning. So let it just drown. "This happened for the first time." "Why do I feel like.." My head's drowning. So let it just drown. Passengers travelling to Chicago on Flight AK-420.. ...Is now ready for boarding. Please proceed to Gate no.9 for check-in. My hean prays..that you're always happy. "Ask yourself..what your hean wants." "l know..what lies in your heart." "Tell me..why are we separated?" Tikku. BYe- - Bye. Tikku. "One thing troubles me.." "..whenever I think about you." "Why did you get upset with me?" "l wonder why we got separated." "This happened for the first time." "Why do I feel like.." "That I fell in love with you." I stan crying with a smile on my lips. I stan laughing with tears in my eyes. "And I say to myself." What had to happen..has already happened. Randhir, you're looking for excuses to stay back. Are these keys or bunch of trouble? Randhir.. Where were you all night? I called..but your phone was switched off. Where were you? I called Riya and she said "Never call me again". I came here and saw your mom's crockery was broken. Where were you? New York. N ew York? How did you get to New York? I had too much to drink with my friends. And they sent me to New York instead of Romi. Sent you? You're not luggage that they sent you there. Papa, I've a headache. I want to sleep. Go inside and sleep. - No, I'll sleep here. Son, call up Riya. Your headache will be cured. Forget Riya, papa.. ...she'll find someone better. Someone better? Until yesterday, you were good enough for her. What's wrong now? There is someone else. Someone else? Someone else? Someone else in a single night. You're become so audacious. Someone else in a single night. Papa, even she says I've become audacious. Son.. You look so sad. Does it pain? It pains, doesn't it? My son's in love for the first time. Tell me who the girl is. At least tell me her name. Dear, Tikku, I admit that Chocobar is better than Orange Lolly. You win, dear. I promise that from now on.. ...only Tikku will choose the flavor of ice-cream in this house. Love you, papa. You're my one and only, my favorite. So please, don't forget to eat your veggies. Love, P8P?'- Your mom was my Ms. World! But you even broke her record. From today you're my Ms. Universe. Happy sixteenth binhday. Love, P8P?'- Dear, Tikku. I never imagined I'll get such a short-time. ...to write this last letter to you. But the accident was so sudden.. ...and even the Lord arrived in a hurry to take us away. But I said to Him.. "Wait a moment." First let me make proper arrangements for my Tikku. "And then we'll leave." But the Lord said.. "Don't give excuses of Tikku." You won't find anyone smaner than Tikku in this world. "She's more sensible than you are." "She is perfect the way she is." So I said.. Tikku's marriage..that's my responsibility. "Let me fulfill that." But the Lord said.. "Now that's my responsibility." I'll bring the boy to Tikku and introduce them. "Come on now." And I said.. "L am coming." "But how's the boy going to be?" The Lord said. "Gem." Since Lord has taken guarantee, I'll go happily, dear. Love, P8P?'- He'll be a gem. 'He's a gem.' 'Didn't you hear?' 'She called me a gem.' Vidya.. - What? What? What? I am going to Chicago. - Why? Because God wants us to be one. But I wanted you two to be one even before God, Hold on. Hey, baby gm. Come back victorious, roomie. Your tea, miss. HaPPY New Year! I love New Years. "Do you have any idea where you are?" "309 West, 7A." "My house." "309 West, 7A is my house." "Papa and I live here." "l wonder why..you dwell in my heart." Your image keeps floating in my eyes. "The key fitted, my foot." Have you ever heard such a DUII-S story? "You can cross-off your past." "but not make a future for yourself. "And not with a fraud." Tikku! Tikku! Sorry. Young man, you should be running through the park.. "Not the sidewalk. That's right. Thank you. Randhir, stop. Randhir. You were leaving without meeting me. I went to your house.

I've already checked the key. - Listen to me. One second. - You're lying. Left was your house, and.. Right. There. Randhir. Forgive me. I am sorry. Actually, I don't trust my fate. I am the President of the Unlucky Club. Don't say that. You're the President of the Lucky Club. Come on, let's go in. This is just like my house. Oh..so they are your Dolly-Pauli? Just like my home. M'! Photo. Where did you get it? I stole it. You're caught red-handed. Where's papa? - Papa. He's gone to see the house? - Why? Now that you're here, he'll be here too. Happy New Year, uncle!

Hello..say thank you to sister-in-law. Thank you. - Thank you so much From today..l swear I won't touch alcohol. Sure? - Of course, we won't even smell it. You should be ashamed. Buffoons, don't start the first day of the year with a lie. Sorry. Papa.. Papa. Tikku. Hello, uncle. Tikku! Who's Tikku? Romi, who's Tikku? - I don't know. Lord has already given you the keys to this house. We just need to welcome you. Welcome, dear. Welcome. Till yesterday sister-in-laws name was Riya. Yeah. We had double pegs for Double R. So who's Tikku? I don't know. But I know one of them is Randhir. I want to thank my mischievous friends. If they weren't so drunk.. ...and made me drink too, then I would've never landed in New York. And I would've never found the same building, same lane.. ...and same house and a girl in that house. With whom I am really happy today. I am happy too. HaPPY New Year! Same to you. Many, many congratulations, sir. "Love is sweeter than jaggery." "Love is sweeter than jaggery."
