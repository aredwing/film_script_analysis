Let him approach! By whose leave do you cross my lands? A chief's lands are those his men can hold with arms, Temjin. The Merkit Chief comes to dispute them? Were we alone, it would be easier, Targutai. Your blood brother speaks in riddles. Targutai is not so wanting in wit as he would let believe. [Targutai] Nor courage, Mongol, should you seek to challenge it. [Jamuga] Would two lonely hunters challenge a Merkit force... under Chief Targutai himself? [Targutai] Such humbleness sits ill a Mongol. Targutai is not deceived. But I seek no dispute. This journey is an occasion ofjoy. I am taking for myself a third wife. A Tartar woman, Temjin. I share your taste in women, Targutai, but not in blood. Farewell, Tartar woman. For much less, my father would have slain him. The thought came to me, but- But you feared the Mongol dog! Not so, woman. Targutai fears no man! I put violence from me lest I imperil you. Would a Mongol dare touch Kumlek"s daughter? You know ill the son of Yessugai. An insolent pig. [Shouts] [Shouting] Let the guards spread out. As ChiefTargutai orders. Come on! Come on! [Shouting Commands] I suspect Temjin had men concealed nearby, and was seeking to provoke me. By such tricks does he live since the death of his father Yessugai. His clans are scattered. Thanks to my father. Your father Kumlek did well to destroy the old Mongol Chief. His tribe is now of no more consequence than lice... on a fat gelding. Yet still you dare not brave Temjin! Bring me to drink! And make haste, vermin! Tempting. Tempting but unwise, my brother. Listen to me. There are moments for wisdom, Jamuga, then I listen to you. There are moments for action, then I listen to my blood. I feel this Tartar woman is for me. My blood says, "Take her." [Goats Bleating] [Men Jeer] [Men Laughing] Not even the mighty Kasar bends iron forged by Sorgan. There"s a secret in the dipping of it. [Shouting Encouragement] [Grunting] Our little brother exercises himself. [Grunting] So there"s a secret in the dipping of it, eh, Sorgan? Come, Kasar. There is sport more suited to your strength. Put on your armor. A raid? A raid. Yes, a sport worthy of a man, eh, Sorgan? [Men Laughing] Nugal, take this to the tanner. Share the meat among you. I greet you, my Mother. Falconer! You return empty-handed from the chase, my son? Not so. A fine gazelle. Now we seek bigger game, Hunlun. How many Merkits did you observe? Thirty. No more. We"ll take twice that number. Call Borgurchi and Subaya. A small caravan. With one flight of arrows. No man bends his bow until so ordered. I want Targutai"s woman unharmed. Targutai! We attack the Merkit Chief himself? This troubles you? The Merkits are numerous and close! The Tartars are more numerous. And the woman I take from the Merkit"s Chief is a Tartar woman. This raid may reap us more grief than spoils, Temjin. True! Aye! What says Jamuga? Aye, what says Jamuga? Well, what says Jamuga? I follow my blood brother, and so do we all. Are you women that you tremble before a force half your number? You fear the Merkits" revenge. I seek it! Let him who shrinks from it say so and be gone. There is no room in my tents for those who fear... or question my orders. [Borgurchi] None question your orders. They offer counsel, brother. Would they fear to follow Temjin who is without equal in battle? Jamuga of the silver tongue. We attack as planned. [Shouts] Lord! Whoa! That jackal, Temjin! To arms! Guard the carts! The Mongol! The Mongol! [Shouting] [Shouting] [Shouting] Lord, they"re on us from all sides! Your horse! Mount! We flee! From a pack of lice? Make haste, woman, lest I leave you! Go, my gallant suitor! Bowmen! Targutai! Greetings! [Whinnying] Why such haste, ChiefTargutai? Do you spurn the hospitality of my lands? Arise, valiant one! Come out from under there! It"s all over! Come on, get out from under there! On, brave suitor! Would you desert your bride unkissed? Make haste, craven! The Tartar wench awaits you. What would the Tartar woman have me do with her hero? What does the jackal do with a rabbit, Mongol? Return to your people, Targutai, and speak well of the Mongols" generosity. [Yells] Take this in memory of your Tartar woman. [Jamuga] Away, Targutai! The wounded beast is more dangerous than the whole. Better that you had slain him. I have no fear ofTargutai, wounded or whole. Here"s the one I must fear. You say well, Mongol. I am Bortai, daughter of Kumlek! Chief of all the Tartars! Slayer of my father. And of you and all your mangy tribe before this moon has waned. What say you of my prize, Jamuga? Richer than you dreamed, my brother. Borgurchi, we march! [Shouting Commands] My Mother. See to the sharing of the booty. All? Place her tent next to mine. Ahh! A fair prize, my son, if my eyes see well. Fairer than you know, my Mother. She is the daughter of Kumlek. Kumlek"s daughter! Spawn of evil! Let your slaves have their sport with her! I will not have her within our tents. I say who stays in our tents. This woman is for my pleasure. You will take pleasure... with the offspring of your father"s slayer? She will bring woe to you, my son. And to your people! Stay, my Mother! There will be feasting... and rejoicing! Rejoicing? The memory of your father is heavy in my heart. And for me there is no rejoicing. ?? [Guitar, Drums] ?? [Melancholy Song In Native Language] ?? [Singing Continues] ?? [Singing Continues] ?? [Song Ends] ?? [Lively Music] [Shouts In Native Language] Dance! No! No! Let"s see the Tartar woman dance! Huh? [Cheering] [Cheering Continues] I do not dance for jackals. No? But for Temjin you"ll dance! Dance, Tartar woman. Dance for Temjin! Know this, woman. I take you for wife. Is Temjin so wanting for a woman that he will quench his fire with ice? You had no love for Targutai. This l"d swear. So I must be overwhelmed by Temjin, flattered by his drunken ardor, returning kiss for kiss. The least of my slaves will give you more pleasure, Mongol. Guard! Lord? Take this captive to her tent. Come. [Panther Snarls] Woman! [Whispering] Jamuga. Jamuga! [Gasps] Lord, my mistress wishes to speak with you. Bortai? Where is she? A captive in her tent, my Lord, else she would have come to you. Come. What mischief do you want of me, woman? Mischief? Temjin did not think it mischief... until I refused him. You I would not refuse, Jamuga. Suppose, having taken your favors, I refuse the favor you seek? Then I would reveal your betrayal to Temjin. Horses for me and my slave woman, and safe conduct out of this camp. Is that so much? I am tempted, woman. Tempted above all to let you go from here, for you will bring sorrow between me and him, and disaster upon his people! Let me go, then, Jamuga. He"s dearer to me than life. I cannot betray him, even for his good. Better to betray him for his good than be thought a traitor... without profit. What are you saying, woman? That I will cry out and call your beloved Temjin! [Men Shouting] Back! [Snarling] Hyah! Out, Mongol! Out! Out! Out, Mongol! Targutai! [Man Shouts] - Temjin! - [Man Shouts] Mongol! [Dog Barks] Why is this carcass lying here? It is an omen, my son. What woman"s talk is this, my Mother? Rid us of this carrion! And what of your dead? Those who died needlessly for this cursed child of Kumlek"s! Jalair! Lord? Let two men guard this woman in her tent. If ill befalls her, they shall die the slow death. Chepei! If the outpost guards still live, bring them before me. You would punish your outposts... after deserting us and leaving Jamuga to defend the camp? Greetings, Temjin. Ah! To drink. I could drain ten brood mares dry. Where is Jamuga? Where is Jamuga? I am here, my brother. What of the Merkits? Routed and well-bloodied. But Subaya was wounded, half his men slain. Men we shall miss when the Tartars descend upon us. Leave the Tartars to me. [Man] As with the Merkits? I dealt gently with this oaf. If others would speak, let it be now! Lord, the outposts. Ah! So you had the guard last night. Yes, Lord. The Merkits fell upon us unawares. You were fortunate to have escaped death. Truly fortunate, Lord. We had drunk much. Hang them. Come. Let all pay heed. I have taken the Tartar woman for a wife. My son, this you cannot do! There"ll be an end of talk on her account. Bring meat and drink. Jamuga! Miserable fools! They fear what will befall when Kumlek strikes. Who shall blame them? For less cause, tribes have slain their chiefs. And you stand with them? Where is your faith, my brother? I was to bring under my standard all the tribes of the Gobi. None would dare stand against me. Was not that once your dream for me, Jamuga? And still is. But the time is not yet ripe. So I share the fear that Kumlek"s daughter will bring disaster. Or lead me to achieve what I have too long put off: the destruction of the Tartars. How so, my brother? With the forces of Wang Khan. Could it be that this woman has touched your wits as well? Sharpened them, more likely. Were not my father and Wang Khan blood brothers as you and I? I have a blood claim on him l"ve never made, even in my early trials. Because the young Temjin had pride, and knew that Wang Khan would not lift a finger, save in his own interest. I go to him now not as a beggar, but as an ally with gifts... and grave intelligence. Kumlek, I learn, is preparing to attack Wang"s city of Urga. That lie will not deceive him. He"ll send spies to test my report. We"ll waylay them. Their failure to return will confirm my warning. It could succeed... if Wang does not take counsel of his Shaman. It is said he places much reliance in soothsayers. What venture is without hazard? But not without retreat, as this is. If Wang discovers your deceit, we"ll never leave the city. This is a hazard I run alone. You"ll remain here, making all ready for moving camp on my return. And the woman? I leave her here, Jamuga, in your trust. You are troubled? There"s something I would tell. Concerning her? She used her wiles on me last night to gain her freedom. What took you to her tent? That is a poor thought between us, Temjin. Her slave came to me. I divined the reason, but went nonetheless to learn her intent. There is no limit to her perfidy! She is a woman, Jamuga. Much woman. Should her perfidy be less than that of other women? I take her with me. Jalair. Yes, Lord? Take three men and make camp to the north. If any man comes riding hard from Urga, question him on his purpose. Torture him until he speaks true. If he goes to spy on the Tartars, slay him. And send word to me at all speed. As you command. [Shouting] Chepei. Proceed to make camp at the water hole. You"ll find more ease this night than last. For me there is no ease while you live, Mongol. Your future promises much discomfort. Why is no tent put up for me? Because you"ll share mine. I will sleep outside. You, bring my fur robe. Tend to your men. You"ll have no further need for furs. Come drink. By night, my warmth, and for adornment by day... I shall heap precious stones on you and rare ornaments. I want no more your stolen treasure than your vile warmth, Mongol! Those furs are mine! The dowry for my marriage with the man you slew! [Groans] I have taken you for wife, Bortai, and I take your dowry. Tomorrow in Urga, I make gift of it to Wang Khan. [Chepei] Lord, the woman! [All Laughing] You"re beautiful in your wrath. Were Wang younger and more nimble at dodging swords, I might give you to him and keep the furs. For they, too, are beautiful. I shall keep you, Bortai. I shall keep you, and responding to my passion, your hatred will kindle into love. Before that day dawns, Mongol, the vultures will have feasted on your heart! Who goes? Temjin, Chief of the Mongols! Taleek! To the palace! [Vendor] You doubt thejuiciness thereof? Ahh. Temjin salutes you, O Khan! Temjin! My eyes are rejoiced by the sight of you, my son! Your welcome touches me. My heart is reminded of your father Yessugai. My blood brother so treacherously poisoned by the Tartar Kumlek. What say you, O Khan? Is a daughter a fair exchange... for a father? Be it fair exchange or no, she"s a fair daughter whoever"s she be. What means, Temjin? This is Bortai, daughter of Kumlek. Daughter of the Tartar? I had thought to bring her to you as a gift, but I could not do you this ill service, for her nature is as ugly as her body fair. [Chuckles] I bring you instead a gift of equal beauty... that will give you endless pleasure without endless trouble. Ahh! A regal gift indeed, Temjin! A regal gift! Come. Let there be music and a feast... befitting Temjin, Chief of the Mongols! ?? [Dance Music] ?? [Cymbals] ?? [Music Continues] A woman of Samarkand. I recognize her by the, uh- There are no finer dancers under the heavens. And without compare in the arts of love. After them, all other women are like the second pressing of the grape. [Wang Chuckling] ?? [Music Continues] ?? [Stops] Had I made captive such a one, O Khan, she would have made a worthy gift. ?? [Music Begins] Does not their skill excite your admiration? Or even envy? It seems your Tartar woman does not share our delight in these dancers. Forgive her, O Khan. But lacking the talents of these women, the sight of them is irksome to her. [Gong Struck] ?? [Music Continues] ?? [Stops] Chepei! To the woman"s quarters! I beg forgiveness for her, O Khan. With such gestures does the Tartar woman prove her love. You see, she would"ve made a poor gift. Wine. Temjin spoke earlier of grave intelligence. May we not hear it now? Yes! Yes! Let"s hear it now. Be gone! Be gone! The Tartars and the Merkits are joining forces to attack us. You are surprised, as I was. Yet we both have cause to know the perfidy of Kumlek... and the Merkit, Targutai"s, ambition. True. For long l"ve nursed revenge against Kumlek. When I heard his daughter was to be the Merkit"s bride, I struck, waylaying them. Targutai, I slew. And with his dying oath, he swore he"d be avenged: that soon Kumlek would rule the Gobi. A vain boast in death. And so I took it, until the woman, in her wrath, spat out like threats. I forthwith sent spies to Tartar territory, and learned the news... which brought me here in haste. What say you of this, Shaman? lfTemjin"s spies reported truly- Let the Khan send out his own spies. What think you of that, Shaman? So grave a question demands a surer answer. Let a sheep be slaughtered, and the shoulder blade brought hither. The spirits shall speak. Gods of fire and gods of water, gods of air and gods of thunder, show thy message in the blade bones... burning hot before my eyes. Through the vapors, from the heavens, make the truth arise, arise! [Chanting] [Chanting Continues] [Sizzling] Light! It is even as Temjin relates, O Khan! The Tartars prepare to attack your city. Alas, there is no peace! Even for him who seeks only to enjoy his hard-won riches. This yet can be, O Khan, and your peaceful city spared all strife... by destroying the Tartars in their camp. Send swiftly and in secret to your clans to mobilize, and join with me in wiping out the Tartars and the Merkits. Thus my father will be avenged, and much stock and grazing land added to our own. Temjin speaks wisely, O Khan. So let it be, then. I depart with the first light. You will get word from me naming the day and the place... for the meeting of our forces. Halt. Well, Shaman, what brings you out at this early hour? The rising sun never finds a servant of the heavens sleeping. I come to speed you on your journey, Temjin, and wish you well. I would speak further, but, uh- Chepei, wait outside. And guard the woman. I value your good wishes, Shaman, for all your doubt of my report last night. The spirits confirmed your report. And who am l- humble servant of the eternal heavens- Who am I to doubt the spirits when they have spoken in the prescribed manner? The Khan grows idle and full of years. Soon his petty chiefs will fight among themselves to take his place. Then other tribes will fall on us like jackals. The moment is ripe for a young Khan of bold cunning. I wish you well, Temjin Khan. I wish you well, Shaman. Your tents burn well. Chepei, leave the packhorses, disperse, and at nightfall go singly into camp. l"ll await you here. Lord, as you command. [Shouts Command] Tartars! Farewell, Mongol! [Shouts] Tie him. The Mongol! [Shouting] [Groaning] Temjin! Jamuga. Ambushed. I know. Tell me of the battle. Kumlek and his Tartar dogs revel in our tents at this hour! Bortai with him. Our losses? This needs more care than I can give it. Our losses- Are they great? A few. The tents were ready as you ordered. Thus much was saved by our retreat. Nor were we long pursued. It is you he seeks. An eagerness we share. I came with scouts to warn you, but too late. Tartars fell upon us, and I alone escaped... afoot. Your place is with our people. They are secure under Borgurchi in the western gorges. Your perils are greater. Coming upon the signs of ambush, I sought you among the dead, and then recalled this cave of our youth. The place of our blood rite... and much dreaming. Temjin will yet conquer! First we must get you to your people. We need horses. I will seek them in the camp. Guard yourself well, my brother. What venture is without hazard? [Laughing] [Drunken Chatter, Laughter] Mongol! Mongol I am, Tartar! Mongol General come freely to speak to your great Chief Kumlek. March, Mongol! Come, little one. Come! [Men Laughing] Lord, a Mongol General. Jamuga, seeking to serve you, Lord. Jamuga? I have deserted Temjin. His folly in abducting the great Tartar Chief's daughter has aroused his people against him. He is unfit to lead. Was he captured? I made him captive, Lord. You lie! I came openly into the camp, and sought to be brought to you! Ah. I will speak with you more in daylight. Take him away. The man lies, my Father. He would die the slow death before betraying his blood brother. Hmm. [Chuckling] Before we march tomorrow, he shall be put to the test. But tonight, back to your tent, my daughter. Come, little Mongol. [Man Laughs] [Woman Screams] So, you would betray your blood brother! The lie chokes you, eh, Mongol? What is there in this Temjin that makes you love him thus? Untie him. Put him in a tent and guard him well. [Gagging] Follow. Do not return without Temjin. [Whistling] [Whistling] [Whistling] Hyah! Temjin, fools! Temjin! [Captain] The Mongol Chief! Seize him! He served you well, your beloved blood brother. You lie! Look, Mongol. [Captain] I, myself, heard him betray you to Kumlek. I salute you, Temjin! [Whip Cracks] [Crowd Cheering] Behold, Tartars! I bring you Temjin, son of Yessugai. Gaze upon him, Chief of the Mongols. [Jeering] To drink! Wine! When the beasts have been watered, do likewise for the Mongol. You thirst, Mongol? [Crowd Laughs] [Laughing] Loose him! I grieve. He grieves! Already the Mongol whelp whines! I grieve that I cannot salute you as I would. I am bereft of spit! Stay. Tell us, Mongol, in like circumstance, what punishment would you decree? What else, my wife, but the slow death? So be it, Temjin. The slow death. Joint by joint, from the toe and fingertip upwards shall you be cut to pieces. [Kumlek] And each carrion piece, hour by hour and day by day, shall be cast to the dogs before your very eyes... until they, too, shall be plucked out as morsels for the vultures! [Laughing] Away with him! You do well, Kumlek. For while I have fingers to grasp a sword and eyes to see, your treacherous head is not safe on your shoulders, nor your daughter in her bed! Away, I said! [Crowd Jeering] Music! Music. The bear! Bring the bear. I am weary, my father. ?? [Dance] [Laughter] More wine. [Laughing] [Laughing] Set yourself alight, Juggler. Give us some real sport! Bortai. Bortai. [Whispering] Bortai. He has suffered much. Deny not the heart. Bring food, and lead him to the horses. [Laughing] Let us see if the Mongol sleeps. Let us! Yes! Bring the bear. We"ll have sport with Temjin! [Laughter] [Laughing] The bear! Make haste with the bear! We"ll tie him with Temjin. [Laughter Continues] Guards! The Mongol"s gone! Up, you dog! Where is he? Here, Lord. Fool! Rouse the guards! Search the camp! Where are your men? [Shouting] Guards! Guards! Guards! You are lost, Mongol. This will spare you much agony. [Hoofbeats] He cannot go far! Search the reeds! Over there! [Arrow Whistles] Temjin! Lord, we believed you slain. Death comes not easy to Temjin. Believing me slain, whom did you acknowledge as Chief? Who else but your blood brother could lead us in our adversity? His joy will be great. [Shouts Command] Ho! Give greetings to Temjin! Our leader has returned. Temjin lives! [Cheering] Temjin! Temjin! Temjin, my brother. I have returned, Jamuga. My son! My son, a miracle has been wrought! You live! You didn"t suckle me to be slain by Tartars, my Mother, but to destroy them. Here. Burn these foul rags! [Groans] Oh, my son. Oh. Small wonderJamuga thought you dead. Jamuga erred. Temjin! Stay, my son. Kasar, fetch my healing leaves and ointments. I see no betrayal there. But this, the blackest kind of treachery, can thus masquerade as brother"s love. Speak then! Deny it! I will not. To deny it would give substance to your thought. This shame l"d spare you! Curb that silver tongue! Speak straight! Did you betray me to the Tartars? No! Hunlun, my mother. Come tend my wound. [Hunlun] I come. This he shall pay for tenfold. We march against the Tartar. With Wang Khan? With the legions of Wang Khan, and the Mongol clans I gather. What folly do I hear? We march against Kumlek. Jamuga, depart tonight for Urga. Let Wang Khan know I await his forces... in the hills of Kerulon at the full moon. My brother, I know your plan. But I doubt if- Kasar, go you with Jamuga. Your brawn may serve to complement his wit in case of trouble. Let us be on our way, Kasar. Come, my Mother. Work your healing on this. Would that I could cure the madness that possesses you. Is that your woman"s way of saying... you oppose my plan to seize this chance for power? Can you speak thus to me, your mother? Did I not hold our tribe together, and raise you with but one thought: to regain your father"s power and avenge his death? Now you"d thwart me and let our vengeance cool still longer. You lie, my son. You seek no vengeance for your father. No, not even for yourself. You seek this Tartar woman! My compact with Wang Khan calls for- Wang Khan? He will betray you into disaster, or rob you of your spoils in victory. Were you not blinded by lust for this woman, you would see- Lust? You, too, are blind, my Mother. Blinded by your hatred for her. Daughter of Kumlek? Even were you right about Wang Khan, yet would I venture this unaided. For I will have Bortai, though I and all of us go down to destruction. For good or ill, she is my destiny. Envoys ofTemjin, Chief of the Mongols. [Shouts] [Shouts] [Sighs] Precious musk ofTonking, Lord. Oh, no! The scent of musk fits ill the celestial signs. Ah, bring civet. Lord, two Mongol emissaries seek audience. Mongols? Bring them to me. My hat and beads. Be gone, be gone. We bring greetings, O Khan, from our Chief, Temjin. He lives? Approach, Jamuga. Word reached me that he was slain by Kumlek. A Tartar lie, O Khan. They tried in vain to hold him captive. My heart rejoices. My Shaman! My presence is desired, O Khan? Ah, my Shaman! Always at hand. Jamuga and Kasar bring word ofTemjin"s escape from Kumlek. A miracle indeed! What say you, Shaman? My heart rejoices. We come to name the day and place where Temjin will await your forces. Speak! The slaves, their tongues have been cut out. Speak freely. The hills of Kerulon at the full moon. Ah, all is well. I have- These envoys must be weary, O Khan. Oh, true. Rest and refresh yourselves. We"ll talk again in the cool of the day. But, Jamuga- We accept your hospitality, O Khan. I like not this tale ofTemjin"s miraculous escape. I catch the scent of treachery here. Treachery? Treachery. How say you, Shaman? I have long thought on this, O Khan. Were the Mongol"s secret purpose to trick us into war with Kumlek, he would not act otherwise. To what end? To fatten on our flesh, O Khan. Remember, they say that when Temjin was born, a clot of blood was found in his clenched fingers. A certain augury of greatness. Beware, O Khan, beware... lest the Mongol"s greatness be achieved at your expense. What say the spirits, Shaman? I was consulting them when these emissaries arrived. The signs are yet unclear, and time presses. With your leave, I will, myself, look further into Temjin"s designs... before our forces are committed. My faithful Shaman. Should ill befall you- Jamuga is much beloved ofTemjin. Hold him, O Khan, the young bull also, as hostages to my safe return. Well, if our brother did not await- Shh. [Claps Hands] The slaves are at the command of the Khan"s honored guests. Remember your father Yessugai. What? Touch no meat nor drink. Poison? Maybe. There"s something afoot. Then why stay? Why not return? If there is treachery, we must penetrate it. To do so, we must stay- listening, not shouting our suspicions. Sit down. Whatever we learn will serve our brother naught while we remain here. I say he should be warned! They would have stopped us had we refused to stay. None would stop me- Shh, shh. What? [Grunting] Wait! We"ll need more than brawn for this enemy, Kasar. All is well, Shaman. Should they escape- They shall not escape, Shaman. The dead never escape. And beneath the cloak of darkness, who shall know what befell? [Speaking Native Language] I do not see what use this will be. Pry it loose! Come. Between the bars. Thus! Ah! [Grunting] At last, a purpose worthy of these muscles! Go first, Jamuga. And cease henceforth to twit me for my brawn. Henceforth, l"ll proclaim it far and wide! Yeah. My brawn now holds me captive. Take my hand. I think- I think- The Mongol! After him! Wherefore such haste, Mongol? For want of a thrush, we eat starling! Seeking Temjin, we find his blood brother. Tie him on the horse. The full moon is long since high. He promises much, this whelp of Yessugai. [Hoofbeats] If we"ve aroused our clans for naught- Lord, for close on a day"s march distant, there"s no sign of Wang Khan"s forces. Ah. You"ve traveled far. Refresh yourself. He let himself be tricked by Wang. My vassal chiefs tremble. Will you meet Kumlek"s men alone? You assured us Wang Khan"s forces would unite with us! But for the promise of Wang Khan"s alliance, would we have been fools enough to gather our tribes? Your plan is but- You will yet share Temjin"s triumph! [Animal Howling] Eternal skies, Yessugai my father, hear me. Summon the spirits of heaven to my aid. Send me men! Men! This day I have long awaited. And now I am beset by weaklings and traitors. And victory is slipping from my grasp. Spirits of heaven, Yessugai my father, do not desert me in this fateful hour. Let not treachery prevail! Lord? Lord, an envoy from Wang Khan. Temjin. I bring you ill tidings, Temjin. I doubt it not. Secure in his city, Wang Khan waits word... of your destruction at the Tartar"s hands. You rode two days to bring me such news? To give you warning, and a plan to thwart the old man"s treachery. And the plan? Seize Urga! And bleed my strength in siege of Wang Khan"s city? There will be no siege and no battle. I, myself, will open the gates, and taken by surprise, the city will fall like a ripe plum. The time has come, Temjin Khan, if you would tread the path of power and riches. And the young Khan will know how to reward a humble servitor. What of my brothers, Jamuga and Kasar? Wang holds them captive. Strike camp. We ride on Urga. [Shouting] We ride! Sorgan. Keep this Shaman always in your sight. If he leaves our ranks, slay him. Ho there. Stand! Hold. The Shaman of your Khan. l"ve come with the Mongol Chief for audience with the Khan. Open. Our news awaits. The gates. Bow! Come on! [Sighs] Ah, my Shaman! What word bring you? The spirits grow impatient for your coming, O Khan. [Screams] You are avenged, Temjin Khan! Temjin, beware the viper. He anticipated my vengeance, traitor. Not I, Temjin, not I. He spoke poisoned words against you. To confound him for your advantage! He wished me to abandon you to Kumlek and- And... my brothers? Kasar- My... humble servitor! [Groans] [Shouting] [Groans] [Shouting] Ho! Hear me! [Shouting Continues] [Crashes] Hear me! Hear me! Wang Khan is slain! Urga is ours! [Cheering] [Crashes] Lord, Wang"s generals swear allegiance. [Temjin] Let all take heed. I, Temjin, Chief of all Mongols... and henceforth ruler over the possessions of Wang Khan, make known to all men present and afar off: Those who oppose me shall be destroyed: those who submit shall be spared: and those who freely unite with me... shall profit richly for I march against the Tartars. The Khan! [Cheering] [Water Dripping] No torment moves him. The man is iron! I care not! You will make him talk, or every torment he has had shall be your lot! Make fire. For three days now your men have worked on him. Is not your pleasure satisfied, my Father? He sickens me. But he shall talk! l"ll know the whereabouts ofTemjin- Then let me talk with him as I have asked you. I know the nature of this man. No torture will persuade him like a woman"s gentleness. My eagerness is no less than your own to know the whereabouts ofTemjin. Do with him what you will, but make him talk! Captain! Let him be brought to my tent. You have slept long. Drink. You have suffered much. But you will spare me further suffering if- If it is in my power. Let us speak low. Three of my father"s guard watch this tent. The hand is gentler, the koumiss sweeter, but no more potent than the water to make me speak. I ask nothing but to know he lives. I am well rested. Call your guards. You cannot trust me, yet I aided his escape. And you will aid mine if I tell you- Nothing! Only that he lives. Is he recovered? Tell me, Mongol! Guard! Go! Go! But you- Fool. For this betrayal, my father would tear my heart out with his own foul hand. I chance this gladly just to know Temjin lives. To reach his arms, l"d cast Kumlek to his fate... and betray my people into Mongol bondage. Do you not understand, Jamuga? You said once you loved him more than life. I am consumed with want of him. I can take you to him. Where is he? No, no. Do not tell me. I will find a way. It must be soon. A danger threatens he must know of. I was hastening to warn him when your men captured me. It must be tonight. If he should die- He will not die. The peril is chiefly to his enterprise. His life is charmed, for destiny has marked him. Tell me ofTemjin. I know of him only that on a sudden, my hatred for him could not withstand my love. He has a quality of spirit that commands love, and makes men greater than themselves. Lacking this spirit, I found fulfillment in our brotherhood, and strove to inspire him to the greatness he knew not yet was in him. That was the purpose of my life. "Was,"Jamuga? He has found greater inspiration, Bortai. We must go to him. I must find a way! Bortai! Bortai! Temjin! Ah, my brother! No, Temjin, no! Die, traitor, die! Temjin, beloved. Ten men will guard you with their lives. I go to avenge my father. [Shouts Commands] [Shouting] [Shouts] Mongol dog! Hyah! Hyah! He comes! My heart is glad that he lives to rejoice in your triumph. Open your heart to him, Temjin. His love and loyalty for you are no less than my own. Let there be brotherhood between us as before, Jamuga. Though your tongue calls me brother, your heart denies me, Temjin, for the worm of distrust has entered into it. The past shall be forgotten, Jamuga. The worm buries deep but never dies. Temjin would be uneasy by day, and by night sleep fearfully. Let"s hear no more of this. I have made great conquests. I shall need your wisdom henceforth. You have no need of me henceforth, my brother, for you have found your destiny. Far greater conquests will be yours, Temjin, and men will call you Genghis Khan, the perfect warrior. Jamuga of the silver tongue. I have ill repaid your love, my brother. Ask now any favor of me, and that I take my oath to grant you. Grant that I may die swiftly. No! Jamuga! That is the favor I ask, my brother. I hold you to your oath. As in the sacred ritual of our ancestors, let my dying be without bloodshed, so that in the eternal heavens... my spirit may forever counsel and protect the Great Khan. So be it, my brother. [Jamuga Narrating] And the Great Khan made such conquests... as were undreamed of by mortal men. Tribes of the Gobi flocked to his standard, and the farthest reaches of the desert trembled under the hooves ofhis hordes. At the feet ofhis Tartar woman, he laid all the riches of Cathay. For 100 years, the children of their loins ruled half the world.
