I'm from Santiago, I don't know my way around here... What?! You're from where?! Santiago. Ahh, You're more full of yourself than we are... - But I don't know the area. - Don't tell us that story again That's why I'm inviting you. You're more full of yourself than we are... in Santiago, they made me go to apartments, strange shit... I went and saw one and said: This shit is like the South. Have you been to the South some time? My friend, excuse me... you can be a cameraman; You can be a T.V. director. You are mistaken. But for a man to be a man my dear friend... if you know Santiago and Calbuco... you're just getting to know Calbuco, but you knew it already. Why are you asking? Why are you making these questions? Yes, you know Calbuco. You're just playing dumb. Look, when I went to Santiago, a girl told me... - What do you do for a living? - I live my own life. But for money? How do you make a living? - I'm just a loser. - How's that? Why am I a loser? I was never a loser, my dear friend. I'm a person, man. I'm a person. I'm not a loser. Shit, I am truly a person, man... How do you support your family? - Ah? - How do you support your family? I left my home for eleven years. I went to Aysen and made a living. But with what money? What money... - Ah? - With what money? Just me. Right here! But where? Where do you get it? - From my own money - Where?! - Because I work. - In what? And if there's no work, I don't. There's no money. Man! If you knew the way I am What happens is they don't want to pay me. They don't pay me anything. Look! They're paying me, fuck, I'm buying a piece of land and, fuck, and I... from Don Jose. From Don Jose. I lent my lough to Don Jose; He hasn't given it back. He hasn't. When is Don Jose going to return that shit to me? There' re many hectares, aren't there? How many hectares? - 150. - That's not bad. Really? Yeah... to see what it's like. Don't you want to go and try? Yes, I would like to. I'd like to... Can you get me people? We have to see those lands. Perhaps they have something there... They're good for livestock. This, this board is... let's talk about a discount right away... For you it's $ 800 pesos. I should charge you $ 1.100, but you can have it for $ 800 pesos. For the floor? The floor... Well, here we commonly use Yew for flooring... or Laurel. But I don't have that type now... I only have pine flooring, that is over there... And... But I don't have the amount you need rig ht now, Howmuch would you need? Besides working with wood... I'm a minister in a church right now. As it turns out, I carry five heart attacks on me... and during the third, I was dead. But I came back to life. And in that heart attack... I went to a place... I had never been before. First, I went through a tunnel, and then I arrived to this vineyard... and in this vineyard... My wings sprouted and I flew to the third heaven... and there I heard...things... tremendous things coming from God. I talked to God, And there in heaven, He designed a church for me. A wonderful church God designed it in heaven, in the infinite... and His voice even told me its dimensions, 10x25. ..And take people to live there. I'm going to give them land. - You are going to give them land? - Yes, as their own. And a house too? Yes, that's why I'm building them. The faith... in your heart... that which made you, as you say, get something out of nothing... is something huge that you can still get from life. You're a young man; You still have dynamism. And, here... there is... a relic, we could say... a piece of wood... that I believe, God apparently kept for you. If I give it to you, would you accept it? It's from when this church was built, and I want to give it to you. If you offer it to me... why not. Lord... this simple piece of wood... There once was a man that said: "Lord, from these four pieces of wood... hangs America's destiny." On this piece of wood... let all this man's good intentions depend, Lord. Let all the work from his hands thrive. I believe and I hope, by Jesus Christ, my savior. Amen. OK. Now we're ready. Why didn't you come? No, it's just that... my friends hid my boat... and what do they do that for? Just to goof around. Because I'm an outsider. It does n't matter. I'll get another boatman. At least say "thank you" for the tools. Take them back, then! Asshole... How did it go in town? Just as I thought it would. Typical town full of half-asleep jerks. Look... The town minister gave it to me. Are you an Evangelist? No. I don't believe in those things. Hand me the handsaw. Hey. Yeah? Why did you come here? It's all I've got. Thanks for the tools. What story do you want to tell? Here, people are always making up stories about lonely men... about lonely people... Because it's full of empty places... There's less people, less things... everything is just like that, down to minimum. But there are lonely men everywhere... and empty places too. Why travel this far? Taben, Queullin, Chidhuapi, Lin, Aptao, Quenu, Huito. Huan There're around 14 islands in the area. Yes. A lot of islands. People are born on their island... and there they are... but they are not. They are there, and they are not. Sometime they go far to find their fortune... This way and that way... This way and that way...and back again. Morons! And, in the end, where do they end up dying? Just on their island. Each one to his own island. That's how it is. Once, there on Huito island... a gringo arrived, one of those with red hair... who had bought a lot of land there. The guy started to travel around the other islands. He came with a very strange idea... He wanted to rent all the animals in the area, and take them to his island... to make them produce more... so everyone would win. Even though he didn't expect it... everyone said yes. They even signed documents for him. The gringo got excited... and got more money... and built a huge shed. About one hectare, there on one of the grasslands... And the day came... when the people had to show up with the animals on their boats... and no one came. And there was the poor gringo, waiting. After a while, nothing was heard from him. And there lies his shed still. Empty"... with not 0 ne an im al. From time to time, people get together to drink there. That's how it was. Near those trees back there, that is where I want the houses. Hey! Let them go. And you? What do you do? I work at night. I service men. And you? I used to look after a place. What kind of place? Aland that belonged to a wealthy lady. And now? Now I'm here. Those clothes will never dry. It's soaking wet. I don't understand why these assholes won't stay. Want some? OK. You own a place when you are on it. Weren't you a caretaker? So? You used to live in a place... in which you didn't own anything. It does n't matter. Want some? OK. Before I considered coming here... I once thought of moving to Virgin Island. Which one is that? The farthest island in the area. Nearly no one lives there. Just animals. Why so far? I didn't want any contact with people. I wanted to go with my mom. But it's dangerous at her age. You should have a look there. What for? I don't know... It's an island. Not many people live there. It might be useful to you. And you Rodrigo? It's too far. The sea is dangerous out there. It's around here. How long does it take? About six hours. I don't know if I want to go that far. As I am saying, may God be with you. Everything that you are doing... I hope that such is the message. I come from Santiago. I'm here to stay. One question... What will you work on? I have some land nearby. It's nice working together... if the children are around, right? That's the most important thing I also want to work... on my own things, but in Calbuco. Are these lands yours? No, over there. I live there. But it's nice...but... I only contribute. Because the whole thing is to work... My cousin lives in this land. I live over there. But, you can feel at home. Who do you work for? I'm a fisherman... I'm a boatman. This is the flashlight I'm carrying. Flashlight. Flashlight. Flashlight! This one is for working at the sea Deep down. Where you dive. This is for that. Flashlight. - I want to take people to work... - Yeah. - How about it? - Yeah. - I can give you a piece of land... - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah... Yeah, yeah what? Yes or no? I don't accept impolite people at my home. The batteries... Four batteries. Four To talk. I have two. I have to charge them. I charge them with electricity. I have a cellphone. Yes, I do. Youjust come, plug it and it's charging. If it is out of charge, what can you talk? Nothing! No charge, no talk. I have a cellphone here, with wires. You plug it some place where there's electricity... it charges rig ht away. Rig ht away. I have no woman here. I have nothing. I just do my stuff by myself. Because I'm used to be alone. There's people that are used to be alone... and that's it. Right? Aman that has been alone, is lonely until death; But calm, and with good manners. Educated people are worthwhile. But some are too rude... they're no good here. I don't accept impolite people in my home. No, no, no, take it easy, dear. Don't pull me so hard. Take it easy, dear! Are we going to Calbuco? ], Have some bread. Thanks. Have some bread! Have some Mate tea. OK. Are you the one who serves the Mate tea? No one else? You! Have some Mate tea. Thank you. Here's your food, little guy. Are you having some coffee? A little sun... The weather is going to be nice. It's all going to be for my son Beltren. I live with him. I tell him, get married, get yourself a woman. When I die... when I get sick When I eat too much... this... my glands... and my liver... It isn't working right. I know myself. They'll put me in a hospital, and then, my son Beltren will be alone. Our things are invested in land and animals. There they are. It's sad for those who have nothing The land never rots. Because land is eternal, my friend. Because it has everything in it. It raises the animals. What I don't like, I told my son Beltren... pigs. They don't give any money back. They eat too much and are dirty. What's this? Agift. I like the way you live. Why? You know how to live alone, without bothering others. What's your name? Manuel Ribera. Do you want to keep it? What for? It's useful for the land. I'll install it... and I'll leave. It must be the antenna It does n't matter, leave it like that. OK, there it is. Want to stay for a while? Sure. Do you live with your family? Yes. You? Damn, you make a lot of questions. I used to live with a woman and my daughter... but I don't know why, at some point I stopped caring about them I got bored. So I decided to look for another job. I heard a woman needed her land looked after in Melipilla... and one day... I had my bags ready. Without letting anyone know... I picked up my bags... and left to live alone for fourteen years. Without warning anyone? Without warning anyone. I left my place for someone eases place. But the lady died... so I couldn't stay, and I couldn't go back. No one knows why the lady left me this island. And here we are. Which story do you want to tell? In reality, men are always alone... and that's it. He has something, but not much. And with a little, a little, no more. That's fine. A piece of land, and that's it. What else? Oh yes. Alone you can only have a little... And that's the way to have something. And that's why it's a little... but not so little. You have to know how to be at one place, to fence your land in. Afree man doesn't run away... He knows how to stay in his own place... with dignity. To tame, you must be there... Animals must be tamed... So with children. Oh yes. You can't keep beasts in the backyard. That's why those who travel are only fooling around. Just fooling around. Because, if you're not here nor there... where are you then? You're nowhere. Long ago, in Quenu island, a long time ago... the people decided to put a lighthouse on the dock. And to make the island famous... they ordered a lighthouse from the United States. What a huge lighthouse it was! The light was so bright, that it illuminated the island across from it. Even ships from other places came here... only to see it. But the lighthouse lasted no more than a month. One day, a group of pirates came from Argentina and stole it. And the island was left in darkness again. And the ships stopped coming. That's why it's important for islands to have a lighthouse on their coastline; To show that there are people there; Not to show off. It's no good to show off so much. That's how it was. Hey, Don Manuel, we're going to need more batteries... for this to work all night. Hey, Don Manuel, we're going to need more batteries... for this to work all night. Don't worry. I am bringing a generator. A big one. This place is going to be really nice. Once, I was invited to a party at a country house. Halfway through the party, the energy cuts off, and the owner... pretty drunk by then, goes to check the generator and confuses the cans... and instead of fuel he poured cyder into it. No one knows how it kept working all night. But the next morning it stopped working. Why do you tell us this bullshit? Remember that I told you about the mussel beds? Sort of. It's just that... I got offered a job there for 3 months. You' re going to leave? I believe so. It's a good salary and they need the money at my home. Since the boats and all shipyards disappeared, my dad... he's not doing well... he doesn't have a job. When do you leave? I don't know. They have to confirm. Anyhowl have plenty of things to do. They gave me some money to fix the boat and... and I have to buy my uniform, sol don't know if I can come by. Will you leave anyhow? Yes, I already told you. Otherwise, I would n't have said a thing. I'm here for the generator. The generator? I sent it to Lin Island. But we agreed you would sell it to me. You never came... But you gave me your word. But... well... I needed the money. You know that money talks here. Could you cancel the auction and reserve it for me? If you want it back, you must get there first thing in the morning. Because the auction is around noon. - Lin Island you said? - Yes. Lin island. OK. I'll be there early in the morning. OK, I hope it works out. - Yes, because you gave me your word. - Alright. We will arrive in no time in your boat. No. No. It's only going and coming back. You can always arrive a little late to your job. You recommended this generator. Yes, but that doesn't mean that I have to go and pick it up. I have a lot of things to do... I have to get up early tomorrow. I must have my boat ready. We have the people, we are building up the place, you can't just ruin it! Hey, you know what? I have important things to do as well. I have to take care of them... this is important to my family. Here. A boatman that might help you. If you want I can help you contact him. You're mistaken, Don Manuel. You're mistaken. That's the law of men... How much is your service? Too m uch. Do you do something special? Yeah, mine is made of gold. No, platinum is more expensive! It even has marble laces on it! No, I don't do anything special, but I put the price I want, get it? You can't come here and say it is too much ortoo little... But the price is related to the kind of service. Well, that depends on the man... if he likes the service he'll come back, and if he doesn't, fine. I already have my money. - Manuel, you have any cigarettes? - No! don't smoke. What a miserable rat. You must remain calm. About ten years ago I wanted to do something else. Sol rented the second floor of a downtown house. I used it as a hostel. I worked for about two years. Everything went fine... but on the second year... for San Juan night... I got scared, I don't know why of so many drunk people partying... with so many lit candles. Sol asked the residents not to bring any more candles; Specially lit candles. That was my first San Juan night with no candles. Around six in the morning... we were all outside, watching how the first floor of the house was on fire; And my hostel too. I don't know what is the point to all this; Though you might have things, they are not yours; They are simply not yours. You must learn to let go, Manuel. Just let the kid go and do his work. You will figure out a way to get there. May be. Are these lands really yours? This is what you get fortresspasing other people's spaces. Don't ever play with people, Don Manuel.
