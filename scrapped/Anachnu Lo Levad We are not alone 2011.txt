On the 23rd of May the present cycle of human civilization will come to an end. Many archeological findings attest to this end and the signs are already visible. But most of you prefer to ignore them. In a few days I will leave you and go... Eddie... Eddie... copy? Roger, Eddie here. Get over to Gate 7, please. - Roger. Over. Hey, Vlad. What's up, champ? Vadim. You're coming to my going-away party, right? On Thursday, before the shift? Don't forget. We'll make a toast, have some snacks. It'll be cool. WE ARE NOT ALONE Yes, sweetie. It's Daddy. Daddy. Yes. Of course, sweetie! Yes. You made cinnamon cookies? Lots and lots of cinnamon cookies. Yes. You know how much I love you? More than that. When I get home tonight I'll taste the cinnamon cookies. No, when I get home tonight. Okay. Bye. See you later. Are you crazy? What are you doing? I'm doing a security check. You call this a security check? Just fuck me and get it over with! But I don't want to fuck you. Do you have a weapon? How are you feeling, Eddie? In what way? Come closer. Let me see. Does that hurt? - No. And now? - Uh... yes. Now it hurts. Watch out for people. All right. Learn to keep your distance. Hmm? No one can see you here, man. There are no cameras here. Come take another balloon, Eddie. Sit down. Cool. Chill. The problem with you, Eddie... is that for such a long time people have been looking at you without really seeing you that you've started to believe you're transparent. Invisible. But you aren't invisible, Eddie. Those clothes? They're camouflage. - Camouflage? Exactly. Camouflage. You're... a lizard. Yes, yes. You're a chameleon. Sort of. What's so funny? You're the lizard. No. No, no, no, Eddie. I'm not a lizard. I want people to see me. I have aspirations and dreams... Dreams... and aspirations I have dreams and aspirations, too. What do you dream of? - I... I dream that after the world is destroyed and our culture comes to an end, I'll start the next cycle and it'll be... Everything will be... you know... all new, and me and everybody... It'll be different. It'll be totally different, it'll be much better. I don't get it. There are these statues. Where? - On Easter Island. They just stand there and stare at the sky. Waiting. I want to be an actor. Mr. Eddie? Eggroll, wonton soup, beef noodles? - Yes. Thank you. Come. Come, please. Eggroll, wonton soup, beef noodles? - Sit. Sit. Eggroll. Wonton soup. Beef noodles! - It's good. I need money for take-away! Yes, yes, I'm at the location, Niso. I'm right there. Okay, just don't mess up again. Of course. You can count on me 100%. - Let go! Let it go! Leave me alone, you pervert! Excuse me, did you call security? - Get her away from me! Nutcase... Well, I'm not sure what you did... Get her out of here! - I'm explaining to her. One second. Excuse me, sir? Keep going! What are you looking at? Well? - I'm dealing with it. Well? Come on. Say... do you mind walking? I'm getting tired. Thank you. This way. Eddie? - Yes. Is that short for Edward? Are you a descendant of the English royal family? No. "Now's the time to run away from the inevitable "with NoPoint's wide range of stylish running shoes" Well, this is Park-3. Where are you parked? Hey! Hey! Eddie, do you hear me? Behind you! Behind the pole! Go on, move! Lady, this isn't fair. Is everything okay? You aren't really hurt, right? Get in your car and go home, okay? Lady, don't make trouble. I don't have a car and I don't have a home, either. You don't have a home? No. What do you mean? My mother died five months ago. Cancer of the pancreas. I'm sorry. A month later... boom. My father died. The exact same disease. Symmetrical death. - Wow. Do you have any... family, friends, relatives... anyone who can help you? No. - No. Now do you see why I'm giving you such a hard time, Edward? Yes. It's just... All right, I'll tell you what we'll do. You're going to leave the mall now... and come back in 15 minutes through Gate 5. What? The cameras there are being repaired. "...There are those who are observing us from above. Who have always been watching us Dear reader... We are not alone. From the dawn of history the human race has been graced with visitations of more advanced civilizations. The great stone statues of Easter Island are a message they left behind. Here is where you must wait. On the designated date we will return in order to give you a chance to begin anew. Lady! I'm asking you, please step back behind the safety rail! The safety rail was installed here for the customer's safety. Is it because of your parents? The symmetrical cancer... And all that? Edward? Is that you? Yes. What's up? Couldn't be better. I know that feeling! Maybe it doesn't show now, but I've also been through times when... I didn't have anyone to talk to. No one to take care of me. I don't need taking care of, okay? Okay, okay. Do you mind if we say goodbye now? - Yes! I mind very much! I'm not leaving here until you come down. Do you really want to save me, Edward? - Yes! I'm giving you the count of ten... Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one... boom. Where are you going? - Home. I thought you didn't have one. Well, thanks for saving my life and all that. You're my knight in shining armor, okay? Now get lost. Well, then... You know... sometimes... life can get a little rough... Anyway, I'm sure that tomorrow morning you'll feel... much much better. Are you one of those people who believe that life is a wonderful gift? That everything works out in the end? This is the end. What do you mean, "this is the end"? The end of the world is coming. When? Now? "On the day when the planets align, side by side... "Then, the time of the fifth Sun will come to an end..." It's a phenomenon that occurs once every 5,026 years. It comes out a week from now. Precisely. It's okay. When Galileo Galilei said the Earth was round they all thought he was crazy and no one believed him, either. He didn't say that the Earth was round, he discovered that the Earth revolves around the Sun. And no one believed him. What, a flood? A plague? Global war? Yes. Good to know. Now I have something to look forward to. Good night, Edward. Go away! I'm sorry, but... I'm not allowed to let you stay here after closing time. There's Chinese food in the fridge. You? - No. Chicken and Sichuan beef. It's from yesterday. This? No... I don't know them. What? I'm just watching over the place. Wow. - Yes. You know what that makes you? - No. The only person in the world who guards 24 hours a day. Oh, yeah? Thanks. What is this? Do you collect shoes, Eddie? - No. No, no, no... Don't touch that. Don't touch that. - Sorry. Sorry, Mrs. Imelda Marcos. - It's all right. What's your trip, Eddie? Uh... My trip... Are you an astronomer? - No. Astrologer? - No. - Astronaut. - Mm. Are you looking for the stars to align or are you just staring at... the next-door neighbor's tits? - At... the stars above. Yes... I'm onto you, Eddie. I understand it all. You're a creature from another planet. "Eddie phone home" You can sleep on the couch. I usually sleep on the couch, but I don't mind sleeping on the floor. What's wrong with the bedroom? It's not permitted... Well? Are you coming? What are you doing? Let's get this over with. Get over with what? I don't even know your name, and here you are... naked. May. Like the month. Pleased to meet you. So... Good night... May. Good night. If everything goes as planned, you land on Easter Island... On May 23rd, at 12 noon, just as you requested. One way, right? Right. Okay, so 1,315 plus 825... that comes out... Wow, that's a lot of fives. Five is an excellent number in numerology, did you know that? - Uh... It signifies progress, adventure, openness to life, change... My number is nine. Stubbornness, idealism, and intense consideration of others. Take me with you. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. The new Gally collection, now in the flagship store... My dear readers, my fellow brothers of mankind. The precise date has been set. Our ancient forefathers warned us time and again. They tried to prepare us. The foreboding signs are all around us, but most of us choose to ignore them. And now the time has come." Leave me alone! Get away from me! Both of you! What the hell's wrong with you? Get off of me! Don't you have work to do? - I'm on a break until 14:00. I brought you some pizza. I hate olives. They're only on the very top. I'll exchange it. You're welcome. Whenever you're hungry I can bring you a pizza. For the next few days, you know, at least until... But mix it up a little. - Right. So you don't have to do what you were doing there. You don't have to do what you're doing, either. What am I doing? - Your stupid job. I like my job. Yes. It's an important job. I'm responsible for people's lives. People trust me. That's why they let me check them. It's like they're giving me permission to get a bit closer to them. Really? Has anyone ever thanked you for risking your life for them, Eddie? If you ask me, no one even notices you're here. You have to treat people like you're at a safari. You close your windows and watch from a distance. And if you can shut out the sound, even better. Like that. "30 percent off all science fiction and fantasy books now on..." Which are you looking at? The right one or the left one? The right one. Obviously. Can I? Thanks. What are you doing? It's... for my mementos. To remember... the world and the people I met here when it's all gone. Oh... The end of the world. Yes. When is it again? In a week, no? Six days, yes. - Six days... But you're part of the end of the world, too. Are you planning to take the souvenirs to the grave? I'm going... to Easter Island. It's in the Pacific Ocean. The end? It isn't the end for everyone. For most people, yes, unfortunately. But for some, those who get there in time, they'll be saved... by aliens. We are not alone, May, you understand? There are other cultures, more developed than ours, whose purpose is to guard and protect the human race. It's all in the book "The Fifth Cycle" by Prof. Gabriel Jose Santo. It may be the most important book ever written. Never heard of it. I know, that's the problem. A lot of people have never heard of it. If you want to... you can come over later and read it. If you want to. Yes, I want to. - Then you can. Okay. - Okay. You'll have to wait until I finish my shift. - Of course. Great. Very good. Good. Eddie! Hey. What's up, champ? I'm a champ? You're the champ. I'm onto you. Dancing, gettin' it on... Oh... right. Who's the girl? Just someone who... I threw out of the mall and... - I hope you're being careful. How's it going? Come here often? Careful? In what way? Did you give her any money? Buy her anything? No. I bought her some pizza. Has she already moved in with you? Girls like those don't waste any time. It's not what you think. Her parents are dead. - Uh-huh. She's all alone. - Right. Heartbreaking. Eddie, you're talking to a guy who's been around, okay? I understand you, believe me. At first everything's great. Give her a lollipop and she's yours forever. The problem starts right after that. - What problem? They cling. Like shit to a shoe. They're the Depriveds. - Depriveds? Messed-up families, drugs. Why do you think they hang out here all day? I had one like that. Don't remind me. Let's just say she messed up my life real good. Really? - Police, trouble... - Wow. You're leaving soon, aren't you? Yes. M.D.F., Eddie, M.D.F. Motivation. Drive. Focus. Motivation. Drive. Focus. Motivation. Drive. Focus. Motivation... Motivation. Drive. Focus. Eddie! What? Bring me a towel. What? - Bring me a towel! You're getting my book wet. Don't worry. - Uh... I'm not worried. It has nothing to do with worrying. Just don't get my book wet, okay? Got it. - Okay. Are you comfortable here? It's okay. Why, am I bothering you, Eddie? - No. Not at all. You know... it doesn't bother me when you touch my things and take showers, and use the bedroom, even though it's not allowed... - I see. It's just... I have nowhere to go, Eddie. - I'm in the middle of something. They're coming after me. - Something very important, and... Who? The people who killed my parents. Your parents died of cancer. My parents were murdered. I know who did it. I don't believe you. You don't believe me? - No. You can believe in flying saucers and dying civilizations and aliens who will save you from global disasters, but when I tell you the simple truth... - May, I'm not in the mood! You don't want to believe me? I'm in the middle of something very, very important, May. Something I've been waiting for... ...for a long, long time. It's something... You don't have to go now. You can sleep here... Spacious storage compartment, netted fabric divider, rubber inner pocket, improved combination lock, a very high-quality suitcase. Where did you say you were going? - I didn't say. To Easter Island. - You don't say. Where is that, in the Caribbean? The Pacific Ocean. Cool. Have fun. I'm not going there to have fun. - No? No. I'm going because I have no choice. Sure, you need some fresh air, eh? I'm dying to go somewhere myself. You'll die if you don't go. May 23rd, Easter Island. I highly recommend that you get there. Silicon wheels, 360 degrees. - Yes. Take it for a spin. I don't want to. I'm not interested. Stop it! Fuck you. - Enough already! Stop it! I don't want to! Oh, suddenly you don't feel like it. Fuck off. Get off of me. Calm down! Bitch. - Fuck off! Son of a bitch! Let me see. I took a first-aid course. There must be something here... Shit, it's out of paper. One second. It's nothing. You got bruised, it's just... a little red. Are you okay? Does it hurt? That's it. You hear, Eddie? There's a suspicious suitcase near Gate 2. Yes, I know. I'm on my way over. Good evening, May. Good evening. I don't think they look like that in real life. I missed you. Really? A little. - Yeah, me too. A little. About what happened that night... I just wanted to say I'm really sorry. I... I didn't mean to... Forget it, it doesn't matter. Besides, you're leaving soon. - In two days. Yes. Two days... Have I introduced you to my friends? Alex, Michael... We have fascinating conversations sometimes. I never had a doll when I was little. It took me a while to get into their head-space. I actually had lots of toys. My parents had a small beachfront hotel. It was empty most of the year, but... in the summer months it would fill up with families with other kids. That was really fun. But then, when summer was over, they'd all disappear at once and I'd find all kinds of toys they forgot or just left behind. Check me. What? I want you to check me. Why? Because I trust you. No, there's no need. Besides, I don't have my metal detector. C'mon, loosen up. What is that? "Eddie phone home." "Eddie phone home." Wow. "We come in peace." You're great, Eddie. Thank you, May. Do you know that people spend one third of their lives sleeping? Do you think that's a waste? I think that's the best third. People are prejudiced against sleep... Ow! - Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I woke you up, I just remembered that... How's that? Nice? Yes, definitely. Ever had a girlfriend, Eddie? Nothing serious. And anything not serious? No. Why not? I don't know. I think... I never really had time for relationships. I believe that relationships take up energy that I personally preferred to spend on, you know... other things... You know, preparing... Preparing for... - For what? Uh... I don't know... It's basically a matter of different priorities. I think getting to know people is... something you have to learn when you're still a kid. Otherwise you... never really know how. It's beautiful. Yes, it's very beautiful. I don't want you to go. I want you to stay with me. Yes, but I have no choice. If I don't go... - We're having a good time together, aren't we? Don't you like being with me? - Very much. Yes, very much. Did you ever consider that it might not be true? What? The whole "Fifth Cycle" thing. It's possible, isn't it? It's possible that you'll get to Easter Island on May 23rd and you'll sit there all alone and no spaceship will come and the world won't end and nothing will happen. No, that's not possible. It'll happen. This cycle is about to end, May. There's evidence, there are signs. Do you really think it's that easy to run away, Eddie? What do you think will happen? You'll sit there, wave your finger, and a flying saucer will stop by and save you from this shitty life? It won't happen. - It will happen. It will happen. It doesn't matter what I think... or what you think. It will happen. It's already happening. Global warming, tsunamis, hurricanes, AIDS, SARS, epidemics, wars, nuclear armament... Do you think it doesn't mean a thing? Could all that be meaningless? It means something, right? The Mayan calendar was proven to be accurate. There's proof, May. There's also a prophecy in the Book of Daniel and in the Gospels of the New Testament. And the statues on Easter Island have been there for thousands of years, right? And the pyramids, and Stonehenge? They're there, right? Yes or no? Yes. The end of the world is coming. It has to. That's just the way it is. We have to start all over again. Goodbye, Sasha. You're a good guy, Eddie. - Thanks. Thanks, Zaltzman. I wish you well. Okay, enough. Back to work. Good luck. Dear... Dear people. In a few days I'm leaving on a journey of thousands of light-years. Due to Einstein's Theory of Relativity when I get back I'll only be a few years older, but... you'll all be gone. According to a large body of archeological and scientific evidence, on the 23rd of May the Fifth cycle will come to an end and a new cycle will begin. Eddie, are you crazy? What do you think you're doing? I know that many of you don't believe me... Eddie, come out! ...but I felt I should tell anyone who might want to join me and say goodbye to those who don't want to. Eddie, I'm warning you! While fulfilling my duties here at the mall I've always tried to give each and every one of you personal attention. You were always like one big family to me. And if I could, I would hug you all now. But I can't. For the sake of the coming generations, I hope that the next cycle of mankind will be better in every way than the current one which is ending now. Eddie, I'm warning you! May... If you can hear me... I wish I'd met you sooner. I'm sorry we didn't have... enough time... to get to know each other... longer. I'm sorry. Open up! Thank you very much and have a nice day. Well done, Eddie. Well done! Motivation, drive, focus! "...The end of this civilization isn't necessarily the end of the human race. This book was written for those of you who can bravely face the inevitable. Those of you who are strong enough to overcome your doubts and lack of faith and are determined enough to bear the Ioneliness of knowing this. You are the foundation for the rebirth of a new world which will rise from the ruins of the Fifth Cycle." Hi, May. Hi, Eddie. For your trip. Thanks. It was on sale. So what are you going to do now? I don't know. But I don't feel like staying here. Then where will you go? It doesn't really matter now, does it? Bye, Eddie. Eddie? Where are you coming from? My apartment. Did you pack this suitcase yourself? Yes. Was there anyone else with you when you packed it? No. Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one... boom. So when does it start? What? The end of the world. It already started.
