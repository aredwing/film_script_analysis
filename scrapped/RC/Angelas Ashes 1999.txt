and told me his stories of Cuchulain Roosevelt and De Valera Later hell be home singing and offering us a penny to die for Ireland Itll be different now Because its bad enough to drink the dole or the wages but a man who drinks the money for a new baby has gone beyond the beyonds Mam couldnt find him Go to bed Frankie With Confirmation you will become true soldiers of the Church That entitles you to die a martyr in the event were invaded by Protestants or Mohammedans or any other class of heathen You will have the gifts of the Holy Ghost Wisdom understanding counsel What is the Third Station

sleep perchance to dream Aye theres the rub Frankie are you dead Isnt it grand Seamus Its Shakespeare loved the Shakespeare It was like having jewels in your mouth when you said the words do believe induced by potent circumstances that thou art mine enemy do believe induced by potent circumstances that thou art mine enemy do believe induced by potent circumstances that thou art mine enemy Bye Bye

Welcome home Frankie Youre a grand soldier Frankie credit to your mother and father Welcome home Frankie Hello Frankie Its grand to have you home soldier Thank you Mrs Purcell Goodman Frankie Ah Francis my boy But the moment saw me dad with Alphie on his lap was an empty feeling in my heart because know hes out of work again Welcome home son Da Its good to see you You too Get a wee sit right St Wilgefortis mom had nine children But still loved having my dad to myself in the morning loved his stories where motorcars and planes went under water Submarines flew up in the air and polar bears wrestled with elephants on the moon He was the Holy Trinity wasmy dad with three people in him The one in the morning with his tea and Woodbines telling us the stories The one who tried so hard to find work but never did And the one who came home at night with the smell of whiskey on him But he was reading all the time he was at the hospital m sorry Mrs McCourt Hes missed over two months of school Hell have to go back to the fifth class m really very sorry Mom dont want to go back to fifth class Malachys in fifth class and m a year older than him Oh come on Frankie But all me friends will laugh at me because ve been put back No What needed was a miracle and it happened right there outside the Our Lady Of Liberty Pub looked up at her She smiled And when looked down there was a penny spent the penny on a candle and prayed to St Francis for him to get me out of my little brothers class Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be Thy name Take that sour look off your puss Francis McCourt or you will feel the end of my stick Francis McCourt is going to show you how well he learned to write in this class last year Hes going to write a composition on our Lord Arent you McCourt Hes to tell us what it would be like if our Lord had grown up in Limerick the holiest city in Ireland Wilgefortis dad wanted to marry her off to the King of Sicily but the beautiful young Wilgefortis was desperate not to marry the scabby old man Oh And McCourt scores a brilliant goal They said that Limerick was the holiest city but everyone knewthe reason why there were always people in the churches It was because it was always raining and they were in there to get out of the wet The name of my composition is Title McCourt The title The title of my composition is Jesus and the Weather What Jesus and the Weather sir All right read it dont think Jesus who is our Lord would have liked the weather in Limerick because its always raining and the Shannon keeps the whole city damp My father says the Shannon is a killer river because it killed my two brothers When you look at pictures of Jesus Hes always wandering around ancient Israel in a sheet It never rains there and you never hear of anyone coughing or getting the consumption or anything like that And no one has a job there because all they do is stand around eat manna shake their fists and go to crucifixions Any time Jesus got hungry all He had to do was to walk up the road to a fig tree oran orange tree and have His fill Or if He wanted a pint He could wave Hish and over a big glass and there was the pint Or He could visit Mary Magdalene and her sister Martha and theyd give Him His dinner no questions asked So its a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that nice warm place Because if He was born in Limerick Hed catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldnt be any Catholic Church and we wouldnt have to write compositions about Him The end Did you write this composition McCourt did sir The miracle worked was back in my old class Stock your mind Its your house of treasure and no one in the world can interfere with it Fill your mind with rubbish and itll rot your head You might be poor your shoes might be broken but your mind your mind is a palace And McCourt gets the ball he goes round one man he goes up to the second man Peggy Sean Kathleen come in for your tea Come in for the lovely leg of lamb and the gorgeous green peas and the floury white potatoes Oh shut up will you woman Its a lowclass mind to torment your neighbors when theres nothing but bread and tea we have Get off to work in England like the rest of our husbands Go and help England win a war wouldnt give the English the steam off my pish No youd rather drink the dole and watch your sons run around all skin and bone with their arse hanging out of their trousers Kathleen come in for your tea If could work d be in the English factories factorys no place for a woman Sitting on your arse is no place for a man And the game restarts in the second half Hes got the ball Hes going on the run Oh you got the ball off him Get off me will you m worn out Thats the end of it for me No more children good Catholic woman should perform her wifely duties Oh feck off will you Youll face eternal damnation Angela Well as long as there are no more children eternal damnation sounds just fine to me Malachy Come on lads come on Youll miss the train Youll miss a good job Come on Weve got the Guinness and weve got the Jameson in England all right Right Uh Remember your religious duties And above all you obey your mother right Youre the man of the house now Francis Mind yourself Come on Lets go Mam said all we had to do was wait two weeks for the telegram with the money order Soon wed have enough
