It is early Monday morning and am in pain My sisters and Anna are taking turns staying up Good morning Did anything happen No shes been very quiet Thank you fell asleep Anna see to the fire thank Thee dear Lord for allowing me to awaken well and cheerful this morning after a good sleep under Thy protection and for the enjoyment of a restful night beseech Thee also today and each day to let the angels watch over and protect my little girl whom Thou in Thy unfathomable wisdom tookest unto Thyself in Thy homeland Amen Mother is in my thoughts nearly every day although shes been dead for over years remember she would often seek the solitude and peace of the grounds also remember that would follow her at a distance and spy on her without really meaning to because loved her to such a jealous extreme loved her because she was so gentle and beautiful and alive and so allpervadingly present But she could also be cold playfully cruel and rebuff me Yet could not help feeling sorry for her and now that m older understand her much better wish could see her again to tell her what understand of her boredom her impatience her longing and her loneliness And when the wicked witch at last realized that little Gretel had tricked her her nose started to grow and grow At Twelfth Night Mother always gave a party and Aunt Olga would come with her magic lantern and her fairy tales always felt frightened and left out When Mother spoke to me in her hurried way could hardly understand what she wanted of me Mother and Maria always had many things to whisper about but then they were so alike Jealously used to wonder what they were laughing at together Everyone was in gay spirits was the only one who couldnt join in the merriment Another time remember it was autumn hid behind the curtain and in secret watched her She was in the red drawing room wearing her white dress sitting quite still with her head bent and her hands resting on the table Suddenly she saw me and in a gentle voice called me Come Uncertain went up to her thinking that as usual she was going to scold me But instead she gave me a look so full of sorrow that nearly burst into tears raised my hand and put it against her cheek and for that moment we were very close Theres someone out there Anna Theres someone out there Good morning Agnes Good morning Doctor She is very tired now dont think it will be long Thank you know the way David Its been so long When can see you again No Some years earlier when Agnes had gone to Italy for her health Maria and her husband Joakim were staying at the manor One evening Annas little daughter was taken ill and Maria sent for the family doctor who lived in the nearby country town Now say ah Ah Once again Ah That hurt a little can see that What a good girl That wasnt too bad eh Off to bed with you now Youll feel better after a good nights sleep Thank you Doctor are you hungry If youd like a little supper the tables being prepared Oh yes that would be nice Thank

the time now Am bothering you No its all right Why are you so formal Couldnt you let the past be forgotten Come here Marie Come Look at yourself in the mirror Youre beautiful You are probably more beautiful now than before But you have changed a lot too want you to see how youve changed Now your eyes cast quick calculating side glances You used to look ahead straightforwardly openly unmasked Your mouth has taken on an expression of discontent and hunger It used to be so soft Your complexion is pale now You use makeup Your fine broad forehead now has four wrinkles above each brow No you cant see it in this light but you can in broad daylight Do you know what caused those wrinkles No Indifference Marie And this fine line that runs from ear to chin is not as obvious any more but it is etched there by your easygoing indolent ways And there by the bridge of your nose Why do you sneer so often Marie You see it You sneer too often See Marie And look under your eyes The sharp scarcely noticeable lines of your impatience and your ennui Can you actually see all of that in my face No but feel it when you kiss me think youre joking with me Its evident where you see it Really Where You see it in yourself Because were so alike you and You mean the selfishness Coldness Unconcern usually find your arguments boring Is there no absolution for such as you and havent any need of being pardoned Good morning sir Good morning Thank you Good morning Joakim Welcome home Good morning Maria Annas little girl is quite ill you know The doctor was here last night He sends you his regards and hopes you can get together to play chess again The weather was so bad asked him to stay overnight He left early this morning before we were up Did you enjoy yourself in town or was there too much work

little thirsty Yes of course Shall read a little Oh d love it Chapter in which Mr Pickwick thinks he had better go to Bath and goes accordingly But surely my dear sir said little Perker as he stood in Mr Pickwicks apartment on the morning after the trial Surely you dont really mean really and seriously now and irritation apart that you wont pay these costs and damages Not one halfpenny said Mr Pickwick firmly Not one halfpenny Hooray for the principle as the moneylender said when he wouldnt renew the bill observed Mr Weller who was clearing away breakfast Sam said Mr Pickwick have the goodness to step downstairs Certainly sir replied Mr Weller and acting on Mr Pickwicks gentle hint Sam retired Anna Cant anyone Cant anyone help me cant Help me cant God our Father in His infinite wisdom has called you home to Him still in the bloom of your youth In your life He found you worthy of bearing a long and torturous agony You submitted to it patiently and without complaint in the certain knowledge that your sins would be forgiven through the death on the cross of your Lord Jesus Christ May your Father in Heaven when you step into His presence have mercy on your soul May He let His angels remove from you the memory of your earthly pain Should it be that you gathered up our suffering in agony into your body Should it be you bore with you this hardship through death Should it be that you meet with God as you come to that other land Should it be that you find his countenance turned toward you then Should it be that you know the language to speak so this God may hear and understand Should it be that you then talk with this God and he hear you out Should it be so pray for us Agnes dear child please listen Listen to what have to tell you now Pray for us who have been left in darkness left behind on this miserable Earth with the sky above us grim and empty Lay your burden at Gods feet the whole of all your suffering and plead with Him to pardon us Plead with Him that He may free us of our anxiety and of our weariness of our misgivings and fears Plead with Him that He may make sense and meaning of our lives Agnes you who have borne your anguish and suffering so long are most surely worthy of advocating our cause She was my confirmation child We often had talks together through the many years Her faith was stronger than mine If you dont mind could see you tomorrow and we can discuss the formalities of the funeral Thank you Some years earlier Karin and her husband Fredrik were pursuing a diplomatic career During a visit to their native land they stayed for some months at the manor Please Anna may have a little more fish Wont you keep me company No thank you What are you smiling about m not smiling Do you want coffee or are we going to retire

each other After all were sisters We have so many of the same memories Karin its so strange how we dont reach one another how we only make small talk Karin why wont you be my friend Weve both been happy and unhappy We could laugh and cry together We could talk together for days and nights on end We could put our arms around each other Karin wander through our childhood home sometimes where all is at once strange but familiar and it seems am in a dream and an event of great importance is in store for us Yes know am childish You read much more than do think much more than do Your experience

wept or grew hysterical Thank you Have you finished packing Anna just have to bring the last trunk down maam Hurry up We are pressed for time The music was fine Thankfully the bishops address was short Fortunate that he had a chill so we could call off the dinner Hadnt something better be done for Anna Sorry but dont understand what you mean Shes looked after Agnes for the last years Shouldnt we offer her a small sum or help her find a new place Out of the question Shes young and strong and has had it very easy up until now Her future is not our responsibility did promise her she could take a memento with her Of her own choosing think she has that right do detest that sort of spontaneity but you cant renege think we should speak to her right away Anna you may stay on here for a time if it is necessary You were promised a memento of Agnes Thank you want nothing at all Shes trying to play a nice role But she wont get anything for it Stay til the months end Yes Well if theres nothing left for us to attend to Lets leave before the roads to the station are snowed under Goodbye now Anna Thank you Thank you Thank you for all you did Hurry now Could speak to you a second Of course That evening we came close to each other have you thought about what we discussed Yes of course ve thought a lot about it Could we hold to all of our resolutions Dearest Karin why on earth shouldnt we do that have no idea Its that everything seems different since that evening think weve become very much closer What are you thinking about m thinking about the conversation No youre not was thinking how Joakim hates it if keep him waiting have no idea why you call me to account as if were on trial for my thoughts Karin What do you want Nothing No If theres nothing you want dont be hurt because must say goodbye to you now You touched me Dont you remember that dont recall each stupid act and never try forcing me to answer for one Dearest Karin give the children my love and keep well Til Twelfth Night As usual well meet then How sad Wednesday the third of September The tang of autumn fills the clear still air but its mild and fine My sisters Karin and Maria have come to see me Its wonderful to be together again like in the old days and am feeling much better We were even able to go for a little walk together such an event for me especially since havent been out of doors for so long Suddenly we began to laugh and run toward the old swing that we hadnt seen since we were children We sat in it like three good little sisters and Anna pushed us slowly and gently All my aches and pains were gone The people am most fond of in all the world were with me could hear their chatting around me could feel the presence of their bodies the warmth of their hands wanted to hold the moment fast and thought Come what may this is happiness cannot wish for anything better Now for a few minutes can experience perfection And feel profoundly grateful to my life which gives me so much
