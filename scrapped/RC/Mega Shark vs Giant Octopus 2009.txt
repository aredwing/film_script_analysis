seas in the evening You know before it explodes Mr Orry m Dr Shimada from the oceanic Institute am here to Liar Who is lying All They say that it was a design error saw it on before they arrested me know They say that all were killed No survivors How the hell can they say what when sit right here Do not worry Quiet My family think m dead and can not call them Well contact your family soon But you must to cooperate with us These people can be unpleasant if they do not get their way Believe me know Are you not for them As said am a scientist And you have seen would like to talk to you about saw it saw its eyes How they looked Please show me that Take your back sir Right up your seat miss Right up your seat sir Change your seat up Change your seat up Change your seat up Please sit down Its just turbulence We need to marry for days Youll handle it This is the captain Fasten your seatbelts Holy shit Emma wait You are not my boss more Dick Emma youre a good employee you just need a little discipline Want some advice No Love is not the ocean too much it will not be returned Professor Sanders Emma McNeill When we last seen For years ago be away from my favorite pupil What is wrong with the teacher You got me away from the gutter So it makes us almost to the family Its all a bit messy at the moment Tell me everything Are you sure youre okay You look tired have just been fired from the Foundation And am sure that no shadows me Who Bloody Du hunter you until you bleed Do not worry Emma will not let them touch you see you have taken laboratory with you Is there anything you want should look at Funny you should ask You stole it from the scene Work calls tooth It has a big smile Very big Inches Oh God Feet Feet Crazy Who do you think it belongs That do not know You are past palontolog would say the strains from a very old guy dinosaur You must be crazy Why are you unsure Did not always taught you Good to doubt but better to investigate Yes am proud of it Say hello to Megalodon It means Big teeth Lived for million years ago and was the largest rvdyr in his time The extinct order million years ago The biggest fish ever existed And possibly the largest shark who have ever lived Previous studies have shown That Megalodon ate larger animals including whales Are you trying to tell me that a extinct prehistoric shark Ate my whale Clearly not extinct It is impossible Are you sure can not turn on the without hearing about Unexplained disasters at sea But inexplicably does not re prehistoric monster Why not Observations of havmonstre Has existed for many years have written articles about it It has never told me Students may be a bit skeptical was fired from the could not risk was fired from the university And besides it would no believe me Yes Dr Shimada nice final to hear your voice Dr Shimada have heard everything wild about your diving adventure They are amazing To steal a nuclear submarine so it does not hit a dolphin would say is more than game Indeed it was a youth So you were thrown out of the fleet May introduce my former pupil Emma McNeill Brilliant havfotograf and pilot Miss a pleasure to meet you Should we was surprised when heard that your government needs help Well technically Dr Sanders Lamar So Lamar Technically speaking it is not my government who have asked for help Its me This makes it only better Diplomatic seen am not here Despite many reports no appears with the root cause This is probably lack of physical evidence Or pictures or anything else And if there was evidence they would not come forward The government would hide them To avoid panic They are afraid They are not ready to a catastrophe of enormous scope And when they realize the situation gravity will be too late That is exactly why came So we can determine what we are facing and what we can do about it It was not what expected not from the attack characterization How accurate are your attack look like The injuries we can not be compared with a Megalodons physiology However got talking to one of the only survivors of the attack Before my government took him away Look at these sketches Note the eye Enormously with a large vertical pupil agree It is not one eye from a shark No it looks like more It is for you For me Who knows am here It has no sender The minisubmarines camera Vince must have delivered it Who My friend Vince was present when it happened Given what happened Oh God Thought it was a nightmare Definitely a shark Megalodon And its friend The same as in the diagram The expected What giant squid Octopus Octopus Chips am on diet Wise to deliver video to you instead of to the authorities He knew went to you spoke often about you One thing is certain now we have half the equation The photographic evidence good starting point as possible to give an answer Amazing Two prehistoric creatures is mysteriously Released in this world Maybe not so mysterious All icebergs melt because of the ozone layer Perhaps it is our fault We are at We are ready sir We have not seen anything yet Give my president personal word To arrive we find the monster we send it to hell Shark yards and coming closer Ready for battle Time to move forward Start Operation Delta Start the Delta repeat Start the Delta comes ever closer The target is fixed Fire repeat Fire Stop no Send the big monster back to hell The target disappeared sir The target is hit We can not confirm yet sir Washington dialing up the target is hit But sir The target is returned The resurrected No No Stand up sleeper snouts Seiji you will have coffee Yes Sugar Yes Good morning What can help you It is not a particularly nice place do you It has the same illumination as in Guantanamo am pretty sure See not so scared off Dr Shimada You will not be sent to Mansanar No Mansanar were Americans Very well Miss McNeill amazes me safely over why we disturbed your sleep Let me guess our country needs us One point for Irish Actually am amazed at the fact why it took so long We exhausted all opportunities before we called the reserve team Your plan did not work We are facing a threat Which no one had imagine Like Hurricane Katrina Very good and fun Dr Shimada Do you know that your Japanese Government has given us full control over your destiny Your life in my hands Unless you want to commit ritual suicide It is wrong And it comes from someone whose career is in ruins Sleeping on your previously learned sofa What now Will i have some money for rent Hey Do not worry You should be happy This country would like to hear what you have to say For years were my ideas ignored Why should it have changed To be honest In the losers that everyone on line You said the shark Since all spoke of seismic disturbances What you want from us Solutions If we do not find a way to stop it Will Sharkzilla dominate the oceans If you dominate the seas dominate your world hope i is aware What With many more opportunities is that The red dots show where Military ships have been attacked These show attacks on civilians Megalodon does not discriminate But yes he is a Fair killing machine And he is not alone What the hell squid They were frozen together But now individuals Unless you believe that the shark Tlport from place to place think youll see it fits Timeline of the disaster giant squid It is crazy We have talked about how we can contain them Do not destroy them No we believe containment Yes these monsters are a threat But they represent also the main scientific discovery of our time You can not just wipe And we want your words that you do everything in your power To catch these monsters Believe in it And what do get You get our full support Professor Sanders and Both agree To isolate them in areas Where it is possible to contain and catch them Could Bay in San Francisco and Tokyo Are the best opportunities in this scenario Look at it as a coral And how would we get them going ideal for these places By sending them an invitation We are working on Work quickly Naval intelligence indicates that they will continue their attacks They are not they kill only Then find a solution as soon as possible See here Thank you It was so little Do you It is not easy to work where there are armed guards As far as know it is not new to you to be under pressure To sail a submarine at night seems to be exciting Yes have always been attracted by water Has always felt myself a part of it have too No matter how large or strong waves were They never scared me You scared even me Everyone in my family were fishermen Lived on the water Were alive because of the water Everyone wanted me to follow in their footsteps Why did you not Death was everywhere saw a dolphin being caught when was a child could not liberate it The panic in its eyes Despair is That was it never got over worm on the hook would go for a walk You know a trip You smell good To do well Fragrances are a powerful thing They can form basis for relations Scents can even explain Why is chemistry between any people You say the most romantic thing Really They say that physical attraction literally based on the scents What Pheromones Oh my God do you think that Pheromones It means we can use to attract them Yes Emma is brilliant agree ve taught her everything she knows Before ordering cake and balloons Is there anyone who will tell me what the hell is happening The smell Scent biological effect Pheromones are the means linking all species It is the source of procreation The ultimate magnet We use San Fransicos and Tokyos bay as bait With pheromones from both monsters Shark and octopus captures smell and are drawn to And think ahead a partner in them tragic decision How are we sure they bite the bait They have been frozen for millions of years Would you not be horny These pheromones released into the water And attracts our friend San Franciscos bay We can use technology to place the feeding strategy To lure them directly into the trap And if may ask what is your case exactly You may well ask And may the people of San Francisco to ask questions What they do not know If you need assistance please call will do Lucky for us my Government produced the substance Is necessary to catch squid They had hidden it But it is not destroyed And weve only just learned to know each other know In this darkness you were my only light only hope If the fate will be our turn Are you sure you want to clear you Sure It is always best to fight on ones own home which says Yes am waiting for you in Tokyo Good luck Sayonara Well Julia back to work Sparkling this is TangoDelta have seen something We have seen something It could be the guys Shark or octopus Octopus It is hard to say They have almost the same size The image disappears TangoDelta reduce delay your account Sir we are flying in height a lower height could put the mission in jeopardy When you say put the mission in jeopardy do you think yourself But sir Go down and keep an eye on the monster Or ll get your wings involved Roger What is the point If he flies lower Is it possible to make it work as having been paid for Black Bird flying down to height Understood See How lowflying the aircraft Approximately feet above the surface Soft enough to take pictures Stig What Get him to grow now Mayday Mayday crash Pin his last position No Get ready to fire Fire Firing The missiles are on their way The goal is gone sir Yes along with the aircraft Now when we have placed the bait how long does it With the current rate and speed would say he frames The first goal of hours And where is it It is located there Far from civil activity The place is like a big cave If you push it against the wall it has nowhere to go And what about delivery We put them these guys must not destroy it You put me in a difficult situation Last time he was behind the helm he hit a sandbank violation is costing several million dollars At least rescued your submarine get us into just heard from Seiji Squid are on their way to Tokyo and our sharks are on the way to do so Are you okay Yes and you We have to be very careful out there Lassie know We are entering into their world now Your backyard They have the advantage It is strange have always perceived me as an observer scientist not a soldier Well in a perfect world it would be the case But every scientist faces for something like this sooner or later When to intervene for humanitys sake am thinking of Einstein and Oppenheimer The extent of it Devastation Yes it is a great one But ta no mistake Emma What we are doing here is necessary and true am just so happy you could be with me do not know how would do it without you Of course you know it am proud of you Emma have always been But never again yet am now Ready Roger Heather makes clear On my signal Frakobel Heather Quietly How does it feel to be behind the helm again Nervous We were sitting Megalodon Are you nervous love it sgu We are about meters Okay take my arm meters Roger In position Understood Is on the starboard side Roger Quiet now Prepare for frigring Are ready Okay Unlock it said freeing it know heard you What are you doing It stuck Stop the Christmas game and release it Have you not heard of genius Armen stuck Sir What The goal came because the first two and maintains the expected rate How long does it before it reaches the bay Its speed has increased to almost threefold In two listen up The shark will be with you in about minutes Find a way that frees it or leave the submarine The submarine has no anchor If we leave the it can operate in a net fisherman Or enter the Bay To unlock it it had to be here Find out We run out of time have always loved the dodgems Quiet You are destroying it It will not happen The goal has increased the speed to knots sir Jesus he is quicker than a jet Try to come out of here try we are stuck Expected arrival minutes Admiral Scott expected arrival about minutes Make you ready Get us in position Yes sir Nemo repeat Nemo Drop the chain of command When give the order slider in order to kill We have lost his arm So what Get away The goal is within reach Within reach sir Wait for the order Wait for the order Wait for the order Hey Are you okay Fire Fire We are firing repeat we are firing Reports Reports Too much dust sir Impossible to see sir Fire again Anything to see Still nothing new on the target The target is destroyed The goal is ruined repeat the goal is ruined Who will have hajstvler Sir get a signal Some orders sir Some orders sir Sir Oh dear Hold on Turn off the autopilot Turn left Now Sir the target is moving towards Golden Gate Bridge Sir The goal is gone sir It can not be seen on radar Call Shimada in Tokyo sincerely hope that i had more successful than we had here in Tokyo Shimada what happens As can see weve tricked squid to the bay But our military has only supposed to make it sour Like a rabid dog the more aggressive than ever Its crazy The change course sir Wait a moment It seems that the monster flees Oh my God what have we done Tell me had success with the shark Very little fear Sir cephalopods is disappeared from radar Then we have much more to watch Did Dr Sanders and Mrs McNeill it okay Yes we have it good Yes but the city is in ruins Thousands have died What the hell happened Watch your tone or if you smoke in arresten She not going anywhere and do you know Her idea is the only one who could be used on this mission Seiji what happened We got problems Bait worked as you said Emma But when he came to the Bay You are a failure Cephalopods were affected by many shots but no effect The same here It seems that our weapons almost no effect Conventional Weapons What do you suggest Perhaps it is time to use something more powerful What nuclear weapons Yes can not believe you are saying can not can It is a Standard military solution There are many deaths on both sides of the globe And you want to add more Nuclear weapons may be our only realistic solution And that is what would recommend to Washington Before we have a global disaster Do you think he will really do it He speaks with the Pentagon at the moment We can not allow that this happens Efficacy of an underwater nuclear explosion would be catastrophic The destruction of marine life unthinkable And the sea will be polluted of radioactive fallout Potential damage to coastlines and loss of life Will be extremely high And many tidal waves We need to think of something fast propose that we get some sleep and think about it We can not reach something so tired we are destruction of marine life unthinkable i Jesus What Trilla in Manila Say it again We get them to kill each other That do not care about Same battle as they were frozen in for millions of years ago Will be the battle as kill them It is brilliant Emma Just a moment Can interrupt this for a moment How to propose in we bring the two together We use the same pheromones process which we used earlier It was the only worked perfectly Okay Lets say they meet How are we sure that they will fight to death It is in their nature They are natural enemies The fact that they were frozen midst of battle makes it clear Since isalderen came nearer the animals were panicked and fled But not these two They chose to be and fight to death Only hatred stronger than their instinct for survival May have led to this Your hatred is our last chance Precisely Physics laws take effect Both possess a force as our military has not But do they spend their forces on each other Bang They kill each other Secure But we have a small problem What we see there No answer Nothing point for you They move in silence and low depth spionflyvene have no signal And if we get a signal They move so quickly that we can not detect them They are adjusting Uro All marine life accelerates under stress And they can increase their speed by up to three times when they are tense Yes we make them sure Yes they make me and all world leaders acidic They control the oceans completely All the boats are in port can not carry anything There is only one solution Place the bait in the ocean and room them They will continue where they left off Everything we do is to get them in the ring What insurance place far from civilization place where anything they can do are harming each other assume you have submarines to patrol out there now Yes all are in full alert The Japanese do the same So get us into a submarine with our with pheromones and get us out there The release of pheromones is crucial It is important that the system pumps every minutes Understood The system works Thank you captain You are a little green Going to sygelukafen No the pills will work There are several buttons on it now You used to sit behind the helm Yes but it was in the past Well from the old school The release of Dr Sanders pheromones works perfectly Brilliant have some questions about our current course Why Because the further north we sail Despite tougher is the sea You are surely not afraid Sunday captain too You have to forgive my old pupil But she can li to use his leisure to drown Latest position on the shark was to the north How do you know it will keep the price know Intuition It must be good to be so inaccurate reach you at work It frightens me but you start with what you know Instinct followed by track and a solution Hopefully What kind of solution that we hope bloodbath Full speed ahead Everything seems to go according to plan We continue to follow them north It seems that our friends prefer the cold climate It looks like this Unusual but none of them has followed a certain pattern Yes but in a way or duck it makes sense What do you think They are programmed to to cross each other The point random or intended Is what that creates life and destruction The universe was created of such an intersection point The events in our daily lives is also created by them Or destroyed them True Still whatever Ahead am pleased that our paths have crossed each other Yes it has been a pleasure Julio Cesar said In todays end which came on But the battle will end Also will the end be known But if we meet again why we should smile But if not Then there was this battle a success need to talk with navigator think much of the night So do Every time get up We talk to you later Okay Every man on the bridge Put it on medhr Yes What happens Sounds like Russian They say they are being attacked Who is under attack thought there were no ships out Captain have confirmed that Petrox from a tanker has been hijacked By the Finnish coast three days ago Petrox would not pay ransom As the crew was killed They shout suhyre It sounds to monster got them up and running Captain suggest you change course immediately If we are lucky the rest after his meal And we could overtake it Maybe we can get it to to hunt us Hunt us Pin transmission We change course there Ready for battle Pirates They have been hit hard What kind of monster did this Impossible to say Released in still the bait Every minutes as ordered Good And if he turns out So are we ready for him Maybe he escaped Shark What the hell is happening Shark attack He is just above us Captain Time to move forward Roger Time to move forward Callback Jack up Say they have to do torpedo are ready We have full speed on Devil with the heels Jesus How in the liver to such an Torpedo and are ready sir Get ready for firing Fire torpedo Fire torpedo Move Torpedo will stay on course Frames of Torpedo are missed Oh God He tails at us Wolf Pack Fleet is ready for service Good shot boys but is delayed Sorry boss We did what we could This is unacceptable This command must be reported This command saved your ass Should have timed it better Send another team torpedoes away Lets keep him at a distance thought you would have him to follow us will But will not have him so close Yes sir Sonar Reports Pack away sir What do you mean gone All ships Destruction of an octopus Squid How See if you can get them All communication is dead sir Try one more time Yes Captain octopus approaching Time to move forward Full speed ahead Yes Captain Not now Dr Captain know these waters well There is a massive passage Passage ve been there It is risky but we can escape from them He is right We do not slip away from those in the high seas The goal we seek meters Enable ndturbo now But sir it will overheat It was an order Enable ndturbo now Ndturboen is now activated Enabled If we do not have the speed of we are dying here guys Speed increases sir The engine keeps Roger The speed increases captain Take us to the path he said Yes Captain Dr We have discovered some disruption on our radar There are several intercepted signals near the arctic circle That must be them There are many disorders it could be explosions Explosions My last message shows only one submarine Only one Trying to communicate with the submarine tried to make contact with all ships No response It is perhaps only a communications error Disorders due to depth or errors in the system itself What about the submarine It is impossible to say now We must be optimistic and help the survivors Navigator Take their rate Leave We are approaching Should reduce the speed sir Negative Keep the current pace The goal is gone No traces of squid Should we stay on course Yes We have an estimate sir The width is less than meters Sir the target is returned It seems to be the shark How are we meters wide Distance to target meters and comes closer Captain meters Keep her calm now Captain We do not Quiet Captain he Quiet Reduce speed now Improve speed now We frames wall Improve speed now Negative You are insane Will you kill us all Drop your weapon The aim is approaching continue Drop your weapon Go back back You are insane The speed is restored We are in favor Hold the hat and glasses Isvg straightforward Turn right How many torpedoes is left Only Prepare torpedo Ready Shoot You got it Captain Speak up The goal comes ever closer The goal comes ever closer Captain pick up a lot underwater disturbance Two animals Hard to say what they do It works They are together They are struggling What happens Who has taken over It is impossible to say There are many sounds Sir the targets are separated They just lick their wounds It is not over yet Captain the animals were separated But is still active Can we not get away from here we need to see what happens Take us periscopes height Yes sir Good work sir Can you handle it It is like to ride sir Americans are still not equal Are you sure There is nothing here sir If the submarine has survived it could not have come this far Are there any signals at all No Maybe it sunk No never There are intercepted activities in the water To the north by a passage Of course That is where we are going Are you crazy It is impossible to navigate there And the radar shows that may have been an avalanche Or something else Changing course Captain Sir both targets disappeared What They were on screen for a moment ago and now they are gone Perhaps the dead of their injuries Dead It would be good Real communication Barely online Only short range See if you can get in cash with the Japanese submarine Yes know these waters How have been together some whales here Captain may look Yes Just when you think there is no logic Life is just a random mess Something hit us We have multiple damage sites Get us to the surface now try but do not respond Make clear the missiles Yes sir With this speed youll kill us Step down We need to come to minisubmarine Get us up try Get in Sir it comes straight at us Captain we need a minisubmarine Go Move You can not beat it You have to leave the ship Move Get away from here now Back Disconnect us now Isolated Sir it is just against us Fire torpedo s There Hang on Emma move up We will not handle it Got you What happened Oh God It is Seiji Yes Seiji No What are you doing take there To do what To save my friend You can not You kill us all Lamar Its too late knew they could not stay away from each other It appears they finally finish it As they began to for millions of years ago Can anyone hear me There are Shimada There The Shimada Can anyone hear me Emma It was incredible You could have been slightly longer am thinking maybe could be a little longer What do you think Now there are several great secrets could be as long you want me to be am not the type who stands in the kitchen and cook food am a mermaid My home is there The sea like you Do you know that only of the oceans has been studied It sounds like a challenge Have you ever seen a herd of whales swim to Mozart think soon will Emma Seiji Lamar Oh no You have the facial expressions Well thought Oh no teacher To find these monsters were a unique event What is it new unique event volcano type of volcanic life Protected Where are they taken In the North Sea Are you ready Oh yes And you Lets go
