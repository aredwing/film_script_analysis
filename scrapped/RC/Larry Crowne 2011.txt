Bernard Shaw Uh thats Geography Show remember Right the study of the Earth Yes study of the Earth and there goes my opening remark Thank you The equator is that imaginary line that separates the Earth into the northern and the southern hemisphere And when you cross it for the first time its a very big deal if you are in the Navy even if youre a culinary specialist The old guys make you dress up in goofy costumes and you have to sing these bawdy songs And they play practical jokes on you When did it for the first time years ago a chief petty officer ordered me to stand watch until saw the equator as we passed it and would recognize it by the big posts that were sunk into the ocean floor and spaced every yards And obviously never hit my rack that night Remember the old commercial for the Navy Join the Navy see the world Well its true did saw landmarks that were both manmade and the natural things saw deltas saw mountain ranges saw the Rock of Gibraltar saw Hong Kong And saw the southern sky which has different stars than the northern sky does In the Navy went around the world five times saw the aurora borealis had shore leave in Australia couple of times Quite memorable And saw the Great Lakes from the rail of a missile frigate while was on the Great Lakes boiled and peeled and mashed and hashed an awful lot of potatoes saw pasta once a week Spaghetti Wednesdays when was in charge of the galley learned a lot of geography in the Navy but would never be able to communicate it to you with such ease unless had taken a class like this believe it was George Bernard Shaw who
