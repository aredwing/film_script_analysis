Somewhere in the vaults of a bank in London is a tin dispatch box with my name on it lt is not to be opened until years after my death lt contains certain mementos of my long association with a man who elevated the science of deduction to an art the worlds first and undeniably most famous consulting detective To my heirs ln my lifetime l have recorded some sixty cases demonstrating the singular gift of my friend Sherlock Holmes dealing with everything from The Hound of the Baskervilles to his mysterious brother Mycroft and the devilish Professor Moriarty But there were other adventures which for reasons of discretion l have decided to withhold from the public until this much later date They involve matters of a delicate and sometimes scandalous nature as will shortly become apparent lt was August of and we were returning from Yorkshire where Holmes had solved the baffling murder of Admiral Abernetti You may recall that he broke the murderers alibi by measuring the depth to which the parsley had sunk in the butter on a hot day l wish youd give me a bit more warning when you come home unexpected ld have roasted a goose had a few flowers for you My dear Mrs Hudson criminals are as unpredictable as head colds You never quite know when youre going to catch one lll unpack your bags Heres an advance copy of Strand Magazine Theyve printed The Redheaded League Very impressive Would you like to see how lve treated it l can hardly wait lm sure l shall find out all sorts of fascinating things about the case that l never knew before Just what do you mean by that Oh come now Watson You must admit you have a tendency to overromanticize Youve taken my simple exercises in logic and embellished them embroidered them exaggerated them l deny the accusation Youve described me as whereas l am barely bit of poetic license Youve saddled me with this improbable costume which the public now expects me to wear That is not my doing Blame it on the illustrator Made me out to be a violin virtuoso Theres an invitation from the Liverpool Symphony to appear as soloist in The Mendelssohn Concerto Really The fact is l could barely hold my own in the pit orchestra of a secondrate music hall Youre much too modest You have given the reader the distinct impression that lm a misogynist Actually l dont dislike women l merely distrust them The twinkle in the eye and the arsenic in the soup lts those little touches that make you colorful Lurid is more like it Youve painted me as a hopeless dope addict just because l occasionally take a solution of cocaine seven percent solution Five percent Dont you think lm aware youve been diluting it behind my back As a doctor as well as your friend l strongly disapprove of this insidious habit of yours My dear friend as well as my dear doctor l only resort to narcotics when lm suffering from acute boredom when there are no interesting cases to engage my mind Look at this An urgent appeal to find some missing midgets Did you say midgets Mmm six of them The Tumbling Piccolos an acrobatic act with some circus Disappeared between London and Bristol Well dont you find that intriguing Extremely so You see theyre not only midgets but also anarchists Anarchists By now they have been smuggled to Vienna dressed as little girls in organdy pinafores They are to greet the czar of all the Russias when he arrives at the railway station They will be carrying bouquets of flowers and concealed in each bouquet will be a bomb with a lit fuse You really think so Not at all The circus owner offers me five pounds for my services Thats not even a pound a midget So obviously hes a stingy blighter and the little chaps simply ran off to join another circus lt sounded so promising There are no great crimes anymore Watson The criminal class has lost all enterprise and originality At best they commit some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official could see through it Mrs Hudson Yes What is it What have l done now There is something missing from my desk Missing Something very crucial What Dust Youve been tidying up against my explicit orders Oh look l made sure l hadnt disturbed anything Dust Mrs Hudson is an essential part of my filing system By the thickness of it l can date any document immediately Well some of the dust was this thick That would be March Oh How can you stand this Why dont you let me air the room out Please Mrs Hudson hes working on a definitive study of tobacco ash Oh lm sure theres a crying need for that ln our endeavors it is sometimes vital to distinguish between say the ashes of a Macedonian cigarette and a Jamaican cigar So far he has classified different kinds of ashes All of which will wind up on my rug That will be enough Mrs Hudson All right if you gentlemen want to stay and suffocate Shes right l am suffocating Oh let me open the window Not from lack of air From lack of activity Sitting here week after week blowing smoke rings staring through a microscope theres no challenge in that Personally l consider it a major contribution to scientific criminology How l envy you your mind Watson You do lts placid imperturbable prosaic But my mind rebels against stagnation lts like a racing engine tearing itself to pieces because its not connected up with the work for which it was built Holmes Holmeswheres your selfcontrol Fair question Arent you ashamed of yourself Thoroughly but this will take care of it There was nothing l could do when he went on one of his cocaine binges except hope and pray that some interesting case would come along to snap him out of it Why are you being so stubborn Holmes Why wont you go lts the final performance of the lmperial Russian Ballet The house has been sold out for months Tickets are going at a guinea apiece Thats precisely it Why should someone send us two free tickets Anonymously at that Well whoever sent them must be in great distress The note says Please you are the only man in the world who can help me l suspect its some sort of plot You mean somebody wants to lure us into a trap Somebody wants to kill me Kill you Thats right lts a plot to bore me to death l detest ballet But this isnt just any ballet lts Swan Lake You know of course Holmes that swan isnt really a swan lts an enchanted princess Mmm Fabulous woman Dont you think so Holmes Who The great Petrova Very strong arches l must admit They say twelve men have died for her Really Six committed suicide four were killed in duels and one fell out of the gallery of the Vienna Opera House Thats only eleven The man who fell from the gallery landed on top of another man in the orchestra That makes an even dozen in a messy sort of way Mr Holmes Yes l am Nikolai Rogozhin Director General of the lmperial Russian Ballet So glad you accept invitation This is Dr Watson Nice to meet you Youre enjoying lmmensely Tell me Mr Holmes how is your health My health Better consult my doctor Oh hes in excellent shape Any insanity in your family Diabetes Asthma Would you mind telling me what this is all about Certainly Madame Petrova she has problem Can you be more specific Certainly not Liaison with a

she thought Oh l didnt mean to be Short tall who cares lt is the brains that count Well thank you Thank you Baskervilles Madame is great admirer of yours She has read every story Her favorite is Big Dog from Baskervilles lm afraid it loses something in translation Nikolai Mr Holmes you know about fiddles What is your opinion of this Antonius Stradivarius Cremonensis Anno Well the label is authentic Judging from the shape the color of the varnish and the tone l would say it is a genuine Stradivarius of the best period You like Oh its magnificent Nikolai Here Take it Madame says it is yours Mine For services you will render My fees as a detective are not exactly trifling but a Stradivarius youre not serious l am not but Madame is All right l will pour vodka and explain Mr Holmes what you have seen tonight is last and positively final performance of Madame Petrova She is retiring What a shame Shes been dancing since she was three years old and after all she is now thirtyeight l must say she doesnt look thirtyeight That is because she is fortynine So Madame has decided to leave ballet and spend life bringing up her child How admirable Problem is how to find father Oh is he missing Correct And thats why youve called me in Also correct We must have father Because without father how could there be child Oh l see The whole thing is still in the planning stage Correct again Madame would like child to be brilliant and beautiful Since she is beautiful she needs man who is brilliant Zo sdarovya Whats in it What does it taste like Red pepper Thats whats in it l beg your pardon Madame would like to know when you can be ready Ready To leave for Venice All the arrangements have been made You will spend one week there with Madame This is all very flattering but surely there are other men better men To tell truth you were not the first choice We considered Russian writerTolstoy Oh thats more like it The mans a genius Too old Then we considered philosopherNietzsche Well absolutely firstrate mind Uhuh too German Then we considered Tchaikovsky Oh you couldnt go wrong with Tchaikovsky We could and we did lt was catastrophe Why We dont know Because Tchaikovsky how shall l put it Womennot his glass of tea Oh pity that Madame is very happy with her final choice Madame must not be too hasty She must remember that l am an Englishman So You know what they say about us lf theres one thing more deplorable than our cooking its our lovemaking We are not the most romantic of people Perfect We dont want sentimental idiots falling in love committing suicide One week in Venice with Madame she goes back to St Petersburg with baby you go back to London with fiddle An equitable arrangement About my medical history when you asked me l neglected to mention one small detail There is hemophilia in my family Huh Were all bleeders Madame says not to worry she will not scratch you Well thats reassuring to know but there Madame says you talk too much You find her attractive or no Well l Oh excuse me What does prokyzhynik mean lt means you little devil lt does l am Thank you l repeat question You find Madame attractive or no Oh l find her most attractive for a woman that is Then no problem Maybe a slight one You see l am not a free man Not free But you are bachelor bachelor living with another bachelor for the last five years Five very happy years What is it you are trying to tell us Well l hoped l could avoid the subject but some of us through a cruel caprice of Mother Nature Get to point The point is that Tchaikovsky is not an isolated case You mean you and Dr Watson Heis your glass of tea lf you want to be picturesque about it Tchaikovsky Believe me Madame the loss is all mine But l would rather disappoint you now than disappoint you in a gondola in Venice lt would have been catastrophe Watson Watson are you coming What is it old boy Were going home Home Not a chance Not the slightest not the remotest chance Toodleoo Hey Good luck Just one moment Whats going on What happened to the girls Why do you not prefer it this way What way Oh you dont have to pretend Mr Holmes told us everything about you and him About me and him Come on No need to be bashful We are not bourgeois Maybe between doctors and detectives is unusual but in ballet is very usual What is Caprice of Mother Nature Look Cahvel and Misha Boris and Demitri and llya and Sergei Sergeihalf and half Holmes Holmes There you are You wretch You rotter You blackguard Of all the vile unspeakable fabrications What do you have to say for yourself Well dont just sit there Speak up man Holmes Are you all right Holmes Holmes From the sound of your footsteps l gathered that you were not in a particularly amiable mood Howhow could you invent such a dastardly lie What the deuce were you thinking of Watson you have my most abject apologies But have you ever been cornered by a madwoman lt seemed like the only way to get out of it without hurting her feelings And what about my feelings and my reputation You realize the gravity of what youve done the possible repercussions So therell be a little gossip about you in St Petersburg These things spread like wildfire l can just hear those malicious whispers behind my back lll never be able to show my face in polite society And if it ever got back to my old regiment you dont know the Fifth Northumberland Fusioneers Theyll strike me off the rolls Theyll cut off my pension Watson youre running amuck Dishonored disgraced ostracized What am l to do Well for one thing ld get rid of that flower Oh you may think this is funny but were both in the same boat We must take desperate measures We must stop this talk Maybe if we got married Then theyd really talk Obviously we cannot continue to live under the same roof We must move apart Of course we can still see each other clandestinely on remote benches in Hyde Park and in the waiting rooms of suburban railway stations This whole things ridiculous We have nothing to hide Thats what lve been trying to tell you Let somebody start a rumor just one ugly word Well sue them for slander No one would dare After all you have an enviable record with the fair sex Damn right l can get women from three continents to testify for me and you can get women to vouch for you too cant you Holmes Can you Holmes Good night Watson Holmes Let me ask you a question l hope lm not being presumptuous but there have been women in your life The answer is yes youre being presumptuous Good night Holmes What indeed was his attitude towards women Was there some secret he was holding back or was he just a thinking machine incapable of any emotion l was not to get the answer until we became involved in what l considered to be the most outrageous case in all our years together Were you expecting someone Not at this hour Maybe Mrs Hudson is entertaining l never found her so l dont know nothing about it Then ld like to speak to the master Well l think hes in bed lts important What is it Mrs Hudson Theres a cabby here says you owe him two and six For what For the fare governor The young lady dont have no money What young lady This one Well what have we here Who are you miss What happened to you l dont know Thats all she keeps saying l dont know l dont know Where did she come from From the river l was driving down the embankment just below Westminster Bridge and there she was in the water drowning Wasnt easy governor what with the cold water and her fighting me Why did you bring her here Because l found this in her hand Baker Street Thats right isnt it Young lady what did you want at this address l do not remember Rather perplexing wouldnt you say Rather Well gentlemen you want her its two and six Or shall l throw her back in the river Oh Mr Holmes you cant let him do that Watson you better accept delivery Keep the change Thank you governor No extra charge for the use of the horse blanket Youre shivering my dear Come along let me get you out of those wet clothes Sit here my dear Shes suffering from shock and exposure There was some printing on the back of this but it seems to have come off in the water Look at this Shes had a nasty blow on the head Could she have hit her head when she fell or jumped into the river No The blood had already coagulated So it would appear that she was the victim of a deliberate attack Get my bag will you Who are you lm Dr Watson and this is Sherlock Holmes Oh Do the names mean anything to you No Think lm trying Can you think of your own name No Shes obviously had a concussion which often leads to temporary amnesia So all we know is that she was coshed on the head dumped into the Thames and subsequently dumped into our laps We know a lot more than that From her accent we know shes foreign From her ring we know shes married Theres one other clue we have Namely Something l deduced when l was helping her up the stairs No corset Good work La Femme Elegant Are you French Vous etes francaise Non Je ne suis pas francaise How can she say shes not French in French Vous etes suisse Non Alors vous etes belge Je ne suis pas sur Vous etes belge de Bruxelles Bruxelles Oui Je pense que oui Oh dash Will someone

are you doing in London l dont know When did you arrive from Brussels Where are you staying l dont know What happened at the river Think Pensez Thats enough Holmes l will not permit you to question her in this condition Here Mrs Hudson Put her to bed my bed lll sleep on the couch Come on l better give her a sleeping draught Watson l think we should arrange to have her removed to a hospital Under no circumstances She should have medical attention She can get that from me but more important she must be protected Theres already been one attempt on her life This temporary amnesia how temporary is it lt depends on the extent of her injury lts like veils shrouding her memory lt could clear up in a few days or a few weeks Watson this is a very small flat We dont want to clutter it up with women Holmes weve never had a case like this woman comes to us with a problem We dont know who the woman is We dont know what the problem is Dont you find that challenging Quite but we cant afford to wait for these veils to lift We must break through them as quickly as possible You really feel its that urgent l do The sooner we solve the case the sooner we can get rid of her Oh Emile Emile Emile ls that you Emile Yes Gabrielle Oh Emile l thought l would never find you Oh Oh Emile Hold me tight lts been such a long time so many nights Do you know what l did before l left Brussels What l hope youre not going to be angry with me l bought myself an expensive negligee Did you pink negligee with marabou feathers Dont you think its a little bit foolish for a married woman Come on Where is the negligee ln my luggage Come here And where is your luggage Oh l dont know Come Emile Come come here Please Oh please Come here What is it Emile What are you doing Dr Watson Porridge is getting lumpy Hadnt you better get up l would like to very much but Mrs Hudson would you mind planting your knee in the small of my back Yes l would Please lm in excruciating pain bit higher just below my seventh

awake Dr Watson shes gone Gone Holmes Holmes Shes gone Well l never Mmm l smell porridge Lumpy as usual l suppose Ah there you are Holmes We were just wondering how uh We certainly were Mrs Hudson why dont you go down to the kitchen get a towel and wipe that look of disapproval off your face Liberties in my house You cant really blame her l mean the way it looks lf l didnt know you better l might suspect youd taken advantage of the young lady As a matter of fact l did take advantage of her Would you hand me the butter knife please Of course You did what Thank you Holmes this is reprehensible Where are your professional ethics Have you no sense of decency no shame None whatsoever lf you must know l found her body quite rewarding You cad Especially the palm of her right hand ld rather not hear about it Very well Then l wont bother to tell you how l traced her suitcase Thats her suitcase Remember that piece of soggy cardboard with our address on it lt was a luggage ticket The number had rubbed off on her hand And since she mustve arrived from Brussels by the boat train l concluded that she had checked her belongings at Victoria Station By Jove if youre right we should find a clue to her identity Or at least a pink negligee with marabou feathers Voila Well lets see What else is in here Now were getting somewhere Oh Who do you suppose this is Good morning Madame Valladon You are Gabrielle Valladon Yes And this is your husband Emile Valladon Yes Sorry to have ransacked your valise but since you came to us for help Where am l Baker Street Oh yes Which one of you is Sherlock Holmes and which is Dr Watson Dr Watson is the handsome one Thats the way he affects most women Coffee You want some strong coffee lts all so confusing Well lets try to sort it out You came to London looking for your husband right Yes Hes a mining engineer We were married five years ago in the Congo Where your husband was working in a copper mine How did you know Your wedding ring its made of copper Last year he invented a new kind of air pump and was hired by an English companyJonah Limited Here we are Jonah Limited Go on Weve been writing to each other regularly then suddenly three weeks ago his letters stopped l kept on writing but no answer So finally l decided to go to that address Ashdown Street Yes lts just an empty store nobody there So l tried to find Jonah Limited No such company exists How decidedly odd Madame Valladon can you think of any reason why your husband shouldve lied to you about these things Emile Never He loves me and l love him l gathered that much l went to the police They said they would send out a missing persons report but they didnt sound too encouraging Then l went to the Belgian embassy They suggested l should consult you You couldve done worse l was on my way here Then suddenly there were footsteps behind me and a hand over my mouth and a smell of chloroform and the next thing l knew l was in the water And then a man was wrapping me in a blanket Madame Valladon somebody tried to kill you last night Do you have any idea who couldve done it l dont understand any of it Oh what does it all mean Mr Holmes Where is my husband You must help me find him Well do our best l assure you Madame Valladon l want you to send one more letter to your husband To Emile Valladon Ashdown Street what was that number Thirtytwo What do you want me to say in the letter Nothing Nothing Holmes youre sending an empty sheet of paper to an empty shop That empty shop is obviously being used as an accommodation address or letter drop But what gets dropped must be picked up The question is how and by whom and why Hammer Chisel Here lts so strange to think lve been writing to a place like this all these months Look Canaries Suppose this couldve been a pet shop Maybe Shh Here comes our letter Well now we are faced with the most nerveracking part of a detectives job doing nothingjust waiting Mr Holmes Mmhmm l dont know how lm going to pay for all this The purse with my money in it is somewhere at the bottom of the Thames lt could be worse You could be at the bottom of the Thames much to your discomfort and much to my chagrin l dont understand how anybody picks up letters here Theres no footprints just tracks What does it mean l would surmise somebody was using ice skates if it werent for a conspicuous absence of ice What do we do now This way Oh Good morning my pretties Heres Mum with your breakfast You think ld forgotten you Some of you will be going on a little trip soon l hate to lose you but even an old womans got to live Though you might well ask why Oh Oh You never told me We have a letter Ooh Got it Yeah All right Come on you old body Right lll be taking them Morning duchess Good morning What have you been doing with

to be picked up in person Go on Right you got it Wait All right Up All right my pretties Back to sleep you go Ooh l really thought we were done for The art of concealment my dear Watson is merely a matter of being in the right place at the right time Did you hear what she said You really think Emile is going to pick up the letter himself lt certainly would simplify things wouldnt it Letter drops wheelchairs canaries And what was all that about Jonah And what do you suppose theyre doing up there And where is up there My guess would be Scotland lnverness to be more precise lnverness Didnt you notice the paper at the bottom of their cage The lnverness Courier Mr Holmes this letter What about it lt is addressed to you To me But thats impossible We sent it ourselves Nevertheless My dear Sherlock l expect you and Dr Watson to join me at the club immediately upon receipt of this note According to my calculations that should be at Your brother Mycroft What time do you make it Watson Either your watch is wrong or Mycroft has miscalculated and knowing Mycroft l suggest you reset your watch Right Holmes l dont mind telling you lm a bit apprehensive about this lm rather curious myself to know whats going on in that Machiavellian mind of his No l dont mean Mycroft l mean Madame Valladon Oh dont worry Shell be perfectly safe with Mrs Hudson To see Mr Mycroft Holmes Right you are sir Hes expecting you in the upstairs study Now if you gentlemen will sign in Surname Christian name address nature of business Gentlemen Hmm Jamaican no doubt Either Tropical or Golacina lm not quite sure Come in Come in Sherlock Dr Watson Sit down Youre looking very fit both of you Thank you How are you Mycroft Hows your gout Under control except for an occasional twinge lve got a treat for you very old Madeira There are only six bottles left in the world lve got two of them and lm negotiating for a third lf you dont mind my saying so anybody whos susceptible to gout shouldnt be The last doctor who warned me about that was crossing Picadilly slipped on an orange peel and was run over by a delivery van from Fortnum and Mason To your very good health Why are you wasting this precious stuff on us l see you so rarely How long has it been Not since the uh case of the Greek interpreter lsnt it ridiculous Two brothers living in the same town Same town perhaps but not in the same world This is superb How old did you say it was One year before Waterloo One year before Waterloo Think of that You do know where Waterloo is dont you Doctor Why its lts in Belgium isnt it Quite And speaking of Belgium it has come to my attention that you are interested in the whereabouts of a certain engineer Yes l am Well l can save you a lot of trouble ld be grateful for any suggestion My suggestion is that you pursue it no further For any particular reason Because it involves the national security We are handling the matter ourselves We Whos we The Diogenes Club of course l didnt say that lve always suspected there was some kind of underground connection between this stodgy and seemingly calcified establishment and the Foreign Office in Whitehall That is neither here nor there lt seems to me the Diogenes Club is here there and everywhere When there are rumblings of revolt in the Sudan an expedition subsidized by your club conveniently shows up to study the source of the Nile When theres trouble along the lndian frontier some of your fellow members pop up in the Himalayas allegedly looking for the Abominable Snowman What a vivid imagination my brother has At the age of five by carefully observing a neighbors house he deduced that babies were brought not by the stork but by the midwife in her satchel As good an explanation as any Yes Wiggins An immediate answer is requested sir Oh yes Tell them that the three boxes go to Glennahurich and the red runner goes to the castle The three boxes to Glennahurich The red runner to the castle Very good sir Why dont you crumple it up and swallow it just to make sure My dear Sherlock there are certain affairs that do not come within the province of the private detective They have to be dealt with on an altogether different level ln other words you want me to stay within my limits l do indeed And speaking of limits what exactly is Jonah Limited Sherlock when l said drop this case it was not merely a suggestion lt was an order By whose authority By the authority of Her Majestys government l hope l have made myself clear Perfectly And now if youll excuse me gentlemen Goodbye sir pleasure as always Just a minute You forgot yourtool kit You will be gentle wont you when you tell her youre dropping the case Watson what does the word Glennahurich suggest to you Absolutely nothing lts Scottish ls it And like all Scottish names its really a word picture Glen means valley na means of the and hurich if memory serves me means yew tree Youre just trying to impress me So the three boxes go to the valley of the yew tree And lll be in Scotland before You are dropping the case arent you Holmes Open that door Dont shoot Mrs Hudson Youre liable to lose two excellent tenants Oh at last lts been a ghastly experience Why Whats happened Did you ever try doing embroidery with a gun in your hand Youll be relieved to know it was not loaded Holmes are you planning to disobey Mycrofts orders Hes not just your brother you know Youll be defying Her Majestys government Any news Did you find out anything Lets just say l know what the next step will be Yes l want you to pack your things Where are we going Holmes let me caution you At this evening Dr Watson and l are going to take you to Victoria Station and put you on the boat train The boat train Oh thats better Youre sending me back to Brussels is that it Madame Valladon you must understand l came here to find my husband You were going to help me Yes my dear but circumstances have changed The great detective Maybe this case is too small for you On the contrary its being handled on a much higher l wont go back to Brussels Maybe youre giving up but l am not lm going to go on looking for him and nobodys going to stop me Even if they try to kill me Are you quite finished lf you recall what l said was that we were going to put you on the boat train l didnt say you were going to stay on it Shes not At Mr Holmes and Dr Watson will be seen waving goodbye to Madame Valladon at Victoria Station At Mr and Mrs Ashdown accompanied by their valet John will appear at Euston Station and board the Highland Express to lnverness Mister and missis Thank you lm sorry for what l said Thats not necessary lll go and pack Maybe l should do it since lm the valet Holmes exactly what are you up to As you like to put it in your chronicles the game is afoot But what game Are you really that interested in the Belgian engineer Or is it the wife of the Belgian engineer You dont like me very much do you Nothing of the sort Quite the opposite but theres more to this case than meets the eye Looking for something Yes My other glove Let me help you Here it is Thank you All right You can look now Am l embarrassing you Mr Holmes Not at all Would it surprise you if l told you l once spent a night with women Oh very interesting case in a harem in Constantinople Oh lmsorry Father l mean Friar Or is it Abbot Going to Scotland you gentlemen So are we lm a valet My master and mistress and l are on our way to lnverness Ever been there Beautiful country Oh forgive me You must be one of those orders thats taken the vow of silence Trappists l think youre called l see youre reading The Book of Jonah Funny We were just talking about Jonah this morning Never mind HmmWomen are never to be entirely trusted not the best of them What did you say l didnt say it You did according to Dr Watson He gave me some old copies of Strand Magazine The good doctor is constantly putting words into my mouth Then you deny it Not at all l am not a wholehearted admirer of womankind lm not very fond of them myself The most affectionate woman l ever knew was a murderess Oh lt was one of those passionate affairs at odd hours right in my laboratory And all the time behind my back she was stealing cyanide to sprinkle on her husbands steak and kidney pie You mustnt judge all women by Of course not Only the ones l was involved with and l dont just mean professionally Kleptomaniacs nymphomaniacs pyromaniacs Take my fiancee for instance Yourfiancee She was the daughter of my violin teacher We were engaged to be married the invitations were out l was being fitted for a tailcoat and twentyfour hours before the wedding she died of influenza lm sorry lt just proves my contention that women are unreliable and not to be trusted Good night Mrs Ashdown Good night Mr Ashdown Sie sputen mach lnverness Doch steigen die aus Dort mussen wir finden den Valladon l will take that Lets see now One two three four five How do you get to Glennahurich How far is it Glennahurich You know a valley with a yew tree lts about a mile out of the town Why do you want to go there Well it sounds like a nice peaceful place for a picnic lts a peaceful place right enough but its no place for a picnic Why not Because its a cemetery The three boxes ls that it Holmes l would think so The two small ones they must be childrens coffins Earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust ln sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the Communion of the Holy Spirit be with us all Amen lts so sad Sad and rather odd There were no flowers and no mourners Good morning Morning Working you hard dad No not really You see this is healthy country Sometimes you sit around for weeks with nothing to do Then you get three in one day What happened An accident aye father and two sons they say They were found floating in the loch Local people No no No one around here knows em The story is their boat capsized in a swell but l dont believe it What do you believe Well you may think lm an old fool an old drunk but lve been living around Loch Ness all me life Are you trying to tell us it was the monster Damn right MacLaren saw the kids faces when they were pulled out of the water Looked just like old men They mustve died of fright Thats incredible ls it Last Easter Sunday the wife and me on our way to services when suddenly Ah whats the use Here you are dad Thank you Thank you You seem like nice people lf youre wanting a holiday in Scotland go to Loch Lomond go to Holy Loch but stay away from Loch Ness To think that people still believe in that nonsense l mean here we are living in the nineteenth century lm ashamed to admit it but l was relieved when he mentioned a father and two boys lt couldnt have anything to do with Emile lt would appear not However there still remains the clue of the castle and the red runner whoever he may be lf theyre unidentified graves why are those boys bringing flowers Because its their brothers who have just been buried Their brothers And theyre not boys Theyre as tall as theyll ever grow Hand me some pebbles Pebbles Take a look at their faces They arehow do you call them in English Midgets Boys with the faces of old men l still dont see Would it help if l told you they were acrobats Not at all Do you remember a tumbling act six brothers missing from the circus That case you turned down l completely forgot Some of us are cursed with memories like flypaper and stuck there is a staggering amount of miscellaneous data mostly useless Mr Holmesif those are not children then Quite The question now is whos in the third grave Holmes Shes fainted Hand me that lantern lt is Valladon isnt it Obviouslybut what is not so obvious is why his wedding ring has turned green and why there are three dead canaries in the coffin White canaries Youve a lovely view of the loch from here as soon as the morning mist rolls away lf you have a mind to do any sightseeing heres a guide to all the local points of interest Thank you This way please lll show you to your room l suppose youre putting me in the basement No your rooms in the attic Good lts the privy thats in the basement Oh May l have your wedding ring please Just as l thought there is a distinct difference in color between your ring and your husbands which leads me to believe that the cause of death was not drowning l wish you would stop that Stop it lf we are to continue if we are to find out what really happened to your husband you cannot act the griefstricken widow lmlmsorry l know its not easy but you must remember were that nice couple from London on holiday in the Highlands lll try Thats much better Thank you Now if l may proceed without further interruptions Mr Ashdown Holmes l saw it l saw it from the attic window lts out there in the lake You saw what Telescope Wheres the telescope What did you see The monster The monster Therethere it is Look for yourself There it is there There there See it There See it l see nothing Nothing lts gone Gone Maybe it was never there Holmes l swear to you l saw it as clear as anything Watson as you so succinctly put it we are living in the nineteenth century Maybe that grave digger was right the swell and the boat overturning Monsieur Valladon may have been found in the lake but he did not drown He died of asphyxiation Asphyxiation Theres only one substance that can turn a copper ring green and bleach the color out of canaries chlorine gas Well that may be but the fact remains that l saw something out there figment of your imagination Now let us be logical The only concrete lead we have is the reference to the castle The question iswhich castle You call yourself logical Youre the least logical man l know Am l How can you say its a figment of my imagination when for years youve been saying l have no imagination whatsoever We have so far investigated eight drafty castles had our bicycles attacked by sheep and our ears assaulted by bagpipes and we are exactly where we started Would you like some more cranberry sauce dear Yes dear Would you pass the cranberry sauce John Yes dear l say there Good afternoon Remember me Theres some chaps l met on the train We had a long conversation or rather l had a long conversation because they are not allowed to talk Trappists you know Just study their bibles Oh youll never guess what the one next to me was reading The Book of Jonah lsnt that odd Quite What is it dear Whats the matter Oh a bee Well l dont think we have to bother with this castle lts just a pile of rubble Then why are they taking all these precautions Why indeed Lets go Go where When rebuffed at the front door ones only choice is to try the tradesmans entrance Sorry No visitors allowed Are you the guide here Yes but the castle is closed to the public while work is going on Oh what are they doing lts being restored by the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments Oh thats too bad l particularly wanted my wife to see Urquhart Castle The tower is one of the most interesting examples of medieval architecture About wasnt it Thats right Let me see was it built by James ll or James lll The lll but if youd like to come back next year well be finished then and lll be glad to show you around Thank you Pleasant sort isnt he Pleasant but ignorant He was off one hundred years and one James lts actually and James l lf hes an official guide shouldnt he know lf hes an official guide Listen do you hear anything Watson No Those birds are making too much of a racket Theyre not just birds Theyre our old friends Sulfuric acid The more we find out the less sense it makes To a graduate chemist it makes a great deal of sense Sulfuric acid when exposed to salt water produces chlorine gas John would you mind clasping your hands please Like that No like that Lower Thank you That tower may be more interesting than l thought and not just architecturally Holmesl have a feeling were redundant here We have now observed the castle from the front from the back from the side from land from water What now Planning to spend the night out here lf necessary Youre gonna catch your death of cold you know Wouldnt it be ironic if Holmes last case were a case of pneumonia Sorry Whats that Holmes Theresa Quick Watson After it Holmes what are we doing We should be going away from it Keep rowing damn it Weve lost it At least you admit there is an it not just a figment of my imagination Quiet Do you have your stethoscope with you Never without it What is it l can hear something lts getting closer and closer Holmes Get back Get back Get backyou beast Are you all right l lost my parasol Wheres Watson Watson Thank you lhave come face to face with maneating tigers l was once caught in a stampede of wild elephants lndia you know but l wasnt half as frightened This beast seems to have a personal grudge against us Well l just hope it doesnt come back l dont think it will Look What strange goingson Not really l would say that the monster after a hard days work has returned home for his supper Yes l know But would you believe you cant borrow a decent pair of trousers in this place All right Holmes Want to confide in us Whenever he starts whistling l know hes getting close to a solution lts nothing new actually Weve come across this situation before We have Where At the ballet Ballet Theres a lake and theres a castle and theres a swan that isnt really a swan or in this case a monster that isnt really a monster Then what is it What is it indeed that feeds on canary birds and sulfuric acid and has an engine for a heart An engine The stethoscope is a very sensitive instrument and water is an excellent conductor of sound There is no doubt that we are dealing with a mechanical monster Oh Not only is it equipped with an artificial heart it also has artificial lungs Judging from the bubbles on the surface of the lake it uses some form of air pump You think my husband was involved in all this Yes Madame Valladon lm sure of it But why would anybody want to build a mechanical monster Just to scare people Not very likely Why did they try to keep me from finding my husband And why was he buried anonymously l think l have a pretty good notion of what theyre up to the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments better known as the Diogenes Club Diogenes Club Come in Mr Ashdown l have a bottle of champagne for you bottle of champagne l didnt order it No indeed You are to deliver it Those are my instructions lnstructions from whom Deliver it where l wouldnt know sir but theres a carriage waiting for you downstairs Are you sure youve got the right Mr Ashdown Quite sure Mr Holmes Well Watson l would say the curtain is going up on the last act l dont like the sound of it Please be careful Holmes youd better take this with you Wellwhos minding the castle Youd better get on lts getting late Where are we going Some sort of party You wont be disappointed in the guest list Whos the host Jonah Mr Ashdown l presume The red runner l presume You shouldnt have gone to all this trouble just for me lts not for you McKennah May l have the champagne please Not a very good vintage is it Mediocre but then again its not for drinking Tie it up will you ln here lnterestingand educational Despite my most emphatic warning you persisted in meddling lt would have served you right if you had all drowned Sorry to be so unobliging Valladon Hmm l imagine that this belongs to the pretty lady and this belongs to yourvalet We found them floating in the lake Speaking about things floating in the lake how much do you know Orthink you know l think youre testing some sort of underwater craft camouflaged to mislead the gullible l think its an experimental model operated by a crew of midgets l think it is powered by sulfuric acid batteries and uses canaries to detect escaping gas Altogether a unique contraption Not quite that unique Right now four countries are trying to develop what we call a submersible but none of them could solve the critical problem how to stay submerged long enough to make it effective What does the good book say And Jonah lived in the belly of that fish for three days and three nights That was our goal and thanks to Valladons air pump we got a jump on the rest of them lts a highly complex system of filtration so we had a series of trials And at least one error During a test run in the Moray Firth pressure caused a leak in the hull sea water mixed with the acid in the batteries to produce chlorine gas Before they could reach the surface Valladon and two of the crew were dead So you had them buried in unmarked graves to preserve your secret lt was essential to keep the information from your client You went to all those lengths to prevent Madame Valladon from finding her husband Your client isnt Madame Valladon lts the lmperial German Government They were after the Belgian engineer or rather his invention They knew he was employed by us but they couldnt find out where So they enlisted the best brain in England to help them You my dear brother have been working for the Wilhelm Strasse And Madame Valladon what part did she play in all of this Madame Valladon is dead Dead The Germans disposed of her three weeks ago in Brussels This is Gabrielle Valladon The woman who was brought to your house in the middle of the night apparently fished out of the Thames and apparently suffering from amnesia is in fact llsa von Hoffmanstal one of their most skillful agents Am l going too fast for the best brain in England Go on They planted her on you quite neatly l must admit so that you could lead them to their objective the air pump very much like using a hog to find truffles And now perhaps youd care to join me lm expecting a certain royal personage from Balmoral Your Majesty l trust you had a pleasant journey maam lt was long and it was tedious and it had better be worth our while Mr Holmes l can assure you maam it will be Now what is this curious ship we are supposed to christen We call it a submersible maam lt travels under water Under water What a fantastic idea Maam may l present some of the scientists responsible for this achievement Ferguson naval architect Your Majesty Professor Simson our leading expert in hydraulics Your Majesty Prescott coinventor of the revolving periscope Your Majesty And this is my brother Sherlock maam Ah yes Sherlock Holmes We have been following your exploits with great interest Thank you maam Are you engaged in one of your fascinating cases at the moment ln a manner of speaking maam When can we expect to read Dr Watsons account of the case l hope never maam lt has not been one of my more successful endeavors Oh There she is maam Her Majestys Ship Jonah And what may we ask is the purpose of that hideous gargoyle Merely a decoy maam Oh To frighten away the sharks we imagine Something of the sort The crew will now demonstrate the workings of the submersible Stand to Arent they rather small for sailors They are maam but because of the size of the craft the Navy made an exception They should make it a rule lt is quite fatiguing to pin on all those medals while standing on our toes This is the main engine which propels us under water at the rate of two knots The reciprocating stabilizer mechanism the highvoltage acid batteries the multistage compressor ballast tank trimmer the air pump which filters and recirculates the air How charming The air pump maam Canaries Must make the crew feel at home Yes maam These are for firing the torpedoes which are accurate up to as much as feet the telescope for scanning the surface of the water But where is the glass bottom The what maam The glass bottom You knowto observe the fish And the plants and the cockles Thats not quite the idea maam Jonah has been commissioned as a warship warship Stop that noise Stop it Maam if l may explain You had better The admiralty regards this craft as the ultimate weapon in naval warfare lt can seek out enemy ships and destroy them with those torpedoes while remaining completely invisible You mean it can fire at other vessels while under water Yes maam Without any warning That is correct maam Without showing her colors lndeed maam Mr Holmes we are not amused lt is unsportsmanlike it is unEnglish and it is in very poor taste We will have none of it l beg your pardon maam Sometimes we despair at the state of the world What will scientists think of next Thats precisely it maam At this very moment the Germans under Count von Zeppelin are experimenting with a dirigible dirigible And what pray is that rigid balloon which could fly over London and drop a bomb on Buckingham Palace lt is being developed at the express orders of Kaiser Wilhelm ll Nonsense We refuse to believe that our grandson Willie would do a thing like that We have conclusive proof maam Our agent in Friedrichshafen a man named lbidson actually saw the dirigible and made a drawing of it Unfortunately he was apprehended before he could cross the border Nevertheless we want no part of this beastly invention Get rid of it Scuttle it The sooner the better May l point out maam And do not concern yourself about that dirigible dropping bombs on us We shall write a very sharp note to the kaiser Nowwe wish to return to Balmoral Well Mycroft it seems we have both been undone by a woman What a shame all that superb engineering and all that cunning espionage for naught Not necessarily lf the Germans want that submersible so badly why dont we give it to them Give it to them lnvite them aboard for the final journey feet straight down And how are you going to arrange that lm rather counting on you to do it since youre on such intimate terms with Fraulein von Hoffmanstal Shall we say goodbye to Her Majesty Sorry about that but as long as youre up what is the German word for castle Schlos isnt it l think so And how would you say under the castle Unten das schlos or die schlos l dont know My German is not that good Your Trappist friends are waiting outside to hear from you lts a chilly morning We dont want to keep them standing around too long do we Fraulein Hoffmanstal Come now its too late to play cat and mouse Unten dem schlos Thank you Here is your signaling device lts rather bent lm afraid Would you care to tell them where they can find the submersible No Then l shall just have to do it myself l only hope my Morse code is adequate to the occasion Wellits up to the good monks now You can consider your part of the mission accomplished Fraulein Hoffmanstal Youre all wrong about me My name is not Hoffmanstal lt isnt lts von Hoffmanstal l stand corrected l suppose once they are in the castle Must amuse you Mr Holmes Trappists walking into a trap lts more amusing than that Once in the castle they will encounter surprisingly little resistance lt will take but a small bottle of chloroform to overcome the guards You mean youre going to let them have the air pump Better than that Were going to let them have the submersible They will find it with its engines running all set to go l assume theyre all expert sailors And since theres a German battleship cruising off the coast of Scotland l expect theyll try to sail it out of the loch and rendezvous at sea Did you say try to l would suggest you get your things together Mycroft will be here to take you into custody l never had you fooled for a moment did l You knew right from the beginning when the cabby brought me to Baker Street Let me see Not quite that soon lts so funny l asked for this assignment you know l was scheduled to go to Japan but l couldnt resist the challenge of coming up against the best lm sorry l didnt give you a closer game Close enough Youre just being kind l failed miserably We all have occasional failures Fortunately Dr Watson never writes about mine Holmes Holmes l saw it again That thing lt came from the castle lts out there lt was out there Now its gone lts gone Forever Look for yourself bottle of champagne And a Bible Thats all thats left of Jonah Holmes For once would you mind being a little less cryptic lt would seem that someone carelessly loosened the bolts of the submersible What a fitting end for Trappists Now they are resting in eternal silence at the bottom of the lake Do you know what hes talking about Fraulein von Hoffmanstal Yes Mr Holmes lm all ready lf theres one thing l like about the Prussians its their punctuality lf theres one thing l dislike about the British its their climate l understand your jails are very damp and your heating facilities totally inadequate They are but youre not going to jail Youre going back to Germany Germany You will be conducted to the SwissGerman border and be exchanged for one of our agents a man named lbidson Thank you Oh dont thank me Thank my brother lt was his idea Frankly l think were making a very poor deal Youre much better than most operatives working for British intelligence Dont you agree Sherlock And better than some consulting detectives Shall we lll take that Gentlemen All right Holmes You dont have to explain anything to me if you dont want to l appreciate that Watson After all lm only your official biographer Anyway l dont think she would care to have this story spread all over the Strand Magazine The public has a right to know these things lf shes a German spy why should we concern ourselves about her feelings Giddyup Holmes if l promise not to write a word about it would you enlighten me as your friend as your valet Quiet lm trying to read a personal message Message Whats she saying Aufwiedersehen Auf wiederthe nerve letter from the Diogenes Club Maybe Mycroft is putting you up for membership lf only to have the distinct pleasure of blackballing his brother Arent you going to finish your breakfast Holmes lm terribly sorry about this Where is it Watson ln the files May to July Youre getting better
