Youre lying to me Tell me the Look at me and tell me the truth They had s out Four of them You know a lot about guns No dont know anything about guns except But you know they had an Everybody knows

Gluck He was having chest pains Paramedics have him They told him to say that if any cops came near the door theyd throw out two dead bodies He thinks theres four perps Says they came in dressed as painters Theres a video system in the bank Were working on getting a download from Manhattan Trusts central security office but itll take a while We got the block locked up got men in the windows Were checking on the sewers with What about the phones Cut and diverted into Were the only ones theyre gonna call Cell phones are monitored and we can jam the air whenever you say But we like to leave it

kinds of things And when they cant well they dont call me Their people call me So immediately know that theres something in that box that you dont even want your closest aides to know about No problem with me You tell me dont need to know whats in that box and dont need to know But if you tell me that its a bunch of old baseball cards and find out that its the launch codes for a nuclear missile

to anyone Except you Okay Well first there are men with guns in there so cant guarantee any results Agreed Of course All right Now what makes you think that they want to rob your box dont Well why

of the bad guys Even if we considered someone as a possible suspect theres one or two or three other people that would rule them out Its like the thing never happened What about prints Everywhere So what All it shows is that these people were there Alibis Just about everyone Even if their alibi was weak a hostage would identify them as being one of the good guys There we are back to square one Priors We got one employee who had some juvie stuff One customer had Excuse me One customer had an outofstate warrant for child support Another one had a couple of priors mostly Again same problem Plus he was a fucking idiot Bank cameras Useless m telling you they thought of everything Almost Sounded like everything to me But this We havent found that or the perp that was holding it If you did

arrangement Let me tell you how this works You No let me tell you how this works You press here to record and you press here to play Theres also the matter of the that seems to have walked away from the Madrugada chequecashing bust didnt have anything to do with that so Wed like to be in your corner on that In exchange for what mean what do you want me to do something unethical mean no disrespect to the both of youse but dont need you to be in my corner Mr Mayor Look m innocent Innocent or guilty youre still going down Give Miss White whatever she needs or your career is over Done Kaput So You gave me what wanted Your career is blossoming and all is right with the world What was Case hiding You know theres a famous saying by the Baron de Rothschild When theres blood on the streets buy property think Mr Case really took that sentiment to heart But he is no different than half the Fortune Let it go Detective Youre a good cop This city needs you Lady Lady youre in the wrong place have an appointment Arthur Good morning Miss White Have a seat Thank you Vincent Thats all for now Thank you Well What did he say Well Detective Frazier turned out to be quite sharp But just fasttracked his career a little and hes under control hope so Tell me about the envelope Where is it now Well the gang leader is going to hang on to it as an insurance policy to keep you from seeking revenge Clearly he has a very low opinion of you And what might that be Well lets see In a nutshell that you got rich doing business with the Nazis during the Holocaust Yes It was years ago was young and ambitious saw a short path to success and took it sold my soul And ve been trying to buy it back ever since But you and this mystery man you have an understanding think so And he managed to get out of there with that envelope If someday he comes back to blackmail you well youll pay him And youll get it back So guess thats it suppose so Bullshit beg your pardon He didnt go through all that just to stick your envelope under his mattress Look they left money untouched Arthur So So he had to have walked out of there with something else The bank says that there was nothing missing So there had to have been something in that box that was worth more to him than your envelope You dont have to tell me Theres only one thing it could be anyway Diamonds And then theres the ring Cartier ring It belonged to the wife of a Parisian banker Wealthy family of French Jews And when the war came along the ring and everything else they owned was confiscated and they were shipped off to concentration camps None survived We were friends could have helped them But the Nazis paid too well Can trust that you will keep what youve learnt here today confidential Despite whatever you may think Yes Arthur Well d love to tell you what a monster you are but have to help bin Ladens nephew buy a coop on Park Avenue If that were true you wouldnt tell me Were listing you as a reference My name is Dalton Russell Pay strict attention to what say because choose my words carefully and never repeat myself ve told you my name Thats the who The where could most readily be described as a prison cell But there is a vast difference between being stuck in a tiny cell and being in prison The what is easy Recently planned and set in motion events to execute the perfect bank robbery Thats also the when As for the why beyond the obvious financial motivation its exceedingly simple Because can Which leaves us only with the how And therein as the Bard would tell us lies the rub Hes gonna smell like shit What do you expect after a week Yeah Why do you think rolled down the window Oh shit That cop Frazier and his partner are walking into the bank Are they coming for me Cant say Its just the two of them Yeah everythings going great today No Yeah about Okay Sounds like fun Okay Talk to you later Sorry Excuse me Mr Hammond Good morning Detectives Just like he planned got a court order here to open a safe deposit box Number Oh thank God Where is it left it in there This way Detectives Why did you do that You left the ring Trust me left it in good hands m no martyr did it for the money But its not worth much if you cant face yourself in the mirror Respect is the ultimate currency was stealing from a man who traded his away for a few dollars And then he tried to wash away his guilt Drown it in a lifetime of good deeds and a sea of respectability Let me get that Let me It almost worked too Okay But inevitably the further you run from your sins the more exhausted you are when they catch up to you And they do Son of a bitch Certain It will not fail What do you think thats worth If you got to ask man you cant afford it Thank goodness my girlfriend aint here Follow the ring Detective Frazier Mr Case How are you am great Nobody got killed at the bank Everybodys happy My kind of day Thats wonderful Wonderful Detective Mitchell Mr Case Be seated gentlemen Thank you Can offer you anything No must say was most impressed by the way you handled that business Thank you Mr Case Whenever hear the term New Yorks Finest youre who think of You keep the rest of us safe and make it look easy Pardon

missing Its got to be the first time in lawenforcement history never heard of it before So you got to ask yourself What the fuck happened Dont you Mr Case m not quite sure like your tone Officer You

on ll tell you what think happened think you sent that woman in there to patch things up Miss White think you paid her What was she doing in there Look this is absurd Are you implying that had anything to do with it Safe deposit box Whats the story on that have no idea what youre Dont lie to me Mr Case dont lie looked at all the records All the bank records for safe deposit boxes at your bank At first glance everything looked fine but there was one safe deposit box that had no records mean going all the way back to So started thinking Who would have the answer to this riddle Probably
