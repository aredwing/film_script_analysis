Once upon a time there did exist a world without video games Like so many things distinctly human electronic games were born out of a combination of innovation necessity and curiosity Early tinkerers made electronic amusements cheap crude entertainment that would transform in time to something potent and alive This would not just happen by electronic wizardry but by the endeavors of artists designers and entrepreneurs whose initial goal to entertain also came to challenge captivate and enlighten millions of people around the world The men and women who created this industry allowed their own experiences and the world around them to inform their creations This is the story of video games This is Video Games The Movie Havin a good time m a shooting star leaping through the skies Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity m a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva m gonna go go go Theres no stopping me m burning through the sky yeah Two hundred degrees Thats why they call me Mister

dont stop me Ooh ooh all right Ooh m burning through the sky yeah Two hundred degrees Thats why they call me Mister Fahrenheit m traveling at the speed of light wanna make a supersonic man out of you Dont stop me now love video games because have the same experience that have when watch a movie that love or read a book that captures my imagination But m an active participant instead of a passive observer Video games have a really interesting role to play in the future of our species and were just starting to figure it out right now feel like video games at this point are intrinsically linked into our culture in a way thats irrevocable think from here on it goes deeper think video games root deeper and deeper into everything were doing until theyre just part of our lives in a way we dont even notice All medias relevant to its time For example records and cassette tapes disappeared from existence but music didnt disappear it was digitized The same is true for movies and books They evolve from one form to another For video games the evolution is the same They will change and evolve They will forever be a part of our global culture hundred two hundred years from now video games will still exist According to The Entertainment Software Association the average gamers been playing video games for years Adult gamers have been playing for an average of years Males average years of gameplay while females average As of percent of all households own a dedicated game console and those that do own an average of two The average game players age as of is And no its not all males Fortyseven percent of gamers are females Fortytwo percent of game players believe that computer and video games give them the most value for their money compared with Ds music or going out to the movies Who buys video games The average age of the most frequent game purchaser is The point Video games have grown up and now theyre not just in arcades or our living rooms Theyre in our pockets Fifteen percent of the most frequent game players pay to play online games while percent play games on their smartphones and percent play games on a handheld device Most gamers who own dedicated game consoles use them for other entertainment media as well like watching movies shows and music Are gamers social Sixtytwo percent of all gamers play games with others either in person or online What about rating game content Over percent of parents are aware of the rating system which rate a games content and match it with the appropriate gaming age for Everyone or Teen for Mature But the question on a lot of minds is do parents really control what their kids play Over percent of parents believe that the parental controls available in all new video game consoles are useful Further parents impose time usage limits on video games more than any other form of entertainment Over percent of the time parents are present when games are purchased or rented and percent of the time children receive their parents permission before purchasing or renting a game Much like movies games have specific genres and subgenres such as action adventure role playing casual games shooters strategy games open world versus linear games sports games racing games This list goes on and on and each genre offers its own special mix of interactive entertainment And yes each is wildly successful in its own way In the past decade video games have gone from a six billion to an over billion annual industry far surpassing movies and music The bottom line Video games are here and they are here to stay But where did all this begin The answer is well a bit complicated Thats the debate of the century whos the father of video games And you know you can always say Nolan Bushnell because he founded Atari The godfather of video games has to be Nolan Bushnell Its gotta be Nolan Bushnell would say Bushnell Nolan Bushnell would probably give that to Bushnell Nolan Bushnell would probably be in the Nolan Bushnell camp Man who came up with the whole Atari series d have to say the creator of Atari Whoever created Pong Ralph Baer You know back in the late s early s makin the Brown Box Ralph Baer cause he created the first console think we both agree it was Ralph Baer Oh Ralph Baer can take two different angles here can say you know whoever started the entire ball rolling is whoever created Pong Whoever started games as we know them today m gonna have to say Shigeru Miyamoto from Nintendo Miyamoto Shigeru Miyamoto think think you know who Shigeru Miyamoto is But d go all the way back to the guys who did Spacewar John Carmack Hideo Kojima m telling you right now brilliant You cant just pick one because its doing injustice to all the other people that have helped develop the games dont think ve ever really thought about who started gaming just appreciate that they did Some say it began here a small back room at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in on the the first computer to utilize a visual display Steve Russell which consider to be the fellow who stood on the shoulders of did a game called Spacewar for the And played that in college while working in an amusement park and felt if could bring Spacewar to the arcade it would make a lot of money It was a game developed as a demonstration of the capabilities of a digital equipment corporation computer back in group of students and employees at wanted to create a game that really would showcase the capabilities of this new machine that had one particular feature they were really interested in and that was a display screen Before that most computers had maybe paper tape outputs or something like that But this one had an actual screen on it would go back to Steve Russell because hes the one that actually made the first playable game Russells product was so much fun to play it infected every in the world and they were trying to get the people to get it off the machine cause it was wasting so much computer time Others argue that electronic games began much earlier or that video games were a byproduct of Cold War technology As usual the truth is somewhere in the middle While many industries and innovators combined to pave the way even for the possibility of the first video game there is little argument as to the visionaries and the company that finally brought video games to the public in a big way All the colors of the world should be Lovin each other wholeheartedly Yes its all right Take my message to your brother And tell him twice Spread the word and try to teach the man Whos hating his brother When hate wont do ooh Cause were all the same Yes the blood inside of me is inside of you Now tell me Can you feel it Tell me can you feel it Can you feel it Ooh when you see whats goin down Can you feel it in your bones Can you feel it Really Nolan brought to Atari the understanding of what makes a good game He played a lot of games and understood them When we started this thing we found that the games that were most successful were those that were simple to learn but impossible to master Pong was somewhat of an accident It was what we consider to be too simple but when it got all wired up and it was done by Al Alcorn he put in some twists to it that were just remarkable and made it a massively fun game One of the design features flaws in the original Pong game was the paddle would not go to the top of the screen all the way and was gonna fix it but didnt get around to doing it and realized that that feature kept the game from two good people from playing it forever It would never end The coining of the phrase video game refers to an or red green and blue raster or video display device Lets take PacMan for example the original This is a bitmap image of PacMan When enlarged individual pixels appear as squares Zooming in further they can be analyzed with their colors constructed by adding the values for red green and blue bitmap corresponds bitforbit with an image displayed on a screen bitmap is technically characterized by the width and height of the image in pixels and by the number of bits per pixel or a color depth which determines the number of colors the pixel and ultimately the image can represent The more bits the better the games looked More bits however meant more memory was needed which was in short supply in the early days of gaming This resulted in games that looked blocky and simple But that didnt stop designers and gamers from diving headlong into this amazing new medium Over time and as technology advanced bits became then and so on With each generational jump in graphics and so called image fidelity the depth of story and immersion in games seemed to progress as well The technological limitations drove the art form and vice versa Games were slowly evolving and those on the inside were growing up with the very art form they were creating It was the Magnavox machine think it was called the Odyssey and to show you how different things were mean basically it allowed you to play Pong really That console had no real graphics There were just squares of light on the screen So there were Mylar overlays that you would stick on the screen And so like then youd put up like a haunted house And then all of the sudden the white Pong ball would be like a ghost you know moving through the house So you had to kind of use your imagination and those Mylar overlays to understand the story they were trying to tell Magnavox presents Odyssey the electronic game of the future Odyssey easily attaches to any brand black and white or color to create a closed circuit electronic playground Odyssey gives you all the exciting action of hockey and other challenging play and learning games for the entire family had a very dear friend who was the head of Records She had an Atari console in her office And she pointed at it and asked me Do you know what that is And said Well kind of but what is it And she said to me Its a license to print money Attention shoppers The new Atari cartridge game is in Only Atari makes the worlds most popular home video games The only Space Invaders The only Asteroids The only PacMan And the only way you can play any of them is on a home video system made by Atari Come and play Atari today The first game that ever remember playing was Space Invaders on the Atari was six years old and was at my friends house and was just blown away by the fact that you could manipulate an image on your television My first console remember playing was the Atari We played everything We had Donkey Kong obviously Baseball loved BurgerTime remember my brother saying like Wow look at the graphics Pitfall Was like a wonderland because you know like there were so many colors you know you could only really run you know it was a side scrolling game but it was amazing You just see the same screen over and over again Youre like Oh they added an alligator head that time or Oh theres a vine The fact that you could go underground in Pitfall like totally blew like oh you can go there You know knew enough about computers to know that it was a computer game and this was but it was simulating you know this alien invasion with one ship on the ground like defending Earth from this alien invasion and to me it was almost like being there Even with those rudimentary graphics it was just the first time d ever had control over something on the television or something on a screen Probably the most memorable console of my entire life and one that miss that wish still had was my original Nintendo Entertainment System The Nintendo Entertainment System Your parents help you hook it up Whats it like to play the Nintendo Entertainment System When you play the system with the most arcade hits youre playing with power The Nintendo Entertainment System now youre playing with power think that one of the reasons we get nostalgic about things is its not necessarily the thing that we were doing Its not that song its not that game or that movie or that book its what was happening in your life at that time It hit at exactly the right time in my life And the then was an amazing amazing game system Games got better fast it seems like Before made it to my teens everything was kinda it didnt look as great as the games did in the arcade But by the time Nintendo came out things started getting a lot better was fortunate to first be exposed to Nintendo as a consumer And for me that very first system that was exposed on was the Super And have many fond memories and many great stories around my interaction with that system Playing for many many hours Playing games like The Legend of Zelda Link to the Past games like Chrono Trigger all of these fantastic experiences that for me were my very first gaming experiences And eventually got a Super Nintendo and then was all about Star Fox And was so into Star Fox and the story and what was gonna happen next Most of the games when we got into the Super all of a sudden you had a reason to go do this because you were tryin to save somebody And so just that little bit there brought story elements into the game And what think was really great about Nintendo during that era is they really wanted to make sure that all the games on the system were really high quality But Sega Genesis was an entirely different thing Sega Genesis was to my experience in college as the Nintendo was to my experience in high school You know that was a very stateoftheart console back then think the next time bought a console was the And was like All right These games are getting ridiculous So got a PlayStation Hey plumber boy mustache man Your worst nightmare has arrived Pack up your stuff got a little surprise for you here Check it out What do you think about that Sony PlayStation has more than games Faceoff Jet Moto Tobal No Destruction Derby Crash Bandicoot could go on m gonna give you a personal demonstration You cant stop grandma You cant Oh you go girl PlayStation m gonna have to ask you to leave Youre hurting my elbow All of a sudden you had this incredible amount of data on one disc that could also play music and everything else To me it was a portal to modern gaming today When Tomb Raider came on the scene in it brought people into a world that they hadnt really participated in before the world It was an immersive world in a time when there wasnt many games like that And think over the years that has grown people latched onto that one When talk to developers and talk to fans around the world they always hark back to their first experiences playing Tomb Raider And it touched them and it was something special And begged my mom for a console begged her And it wasnt until the came out that she finally gave in If we go to the PlayStation and the Nintendo you started to see for the first time What that allowed the vision of Mr Miyamoto to do was to say now that have the ability to manipulate polygons in real time at a fast enough frame rate then instead of just going back and forth now can run around in circles or move into or out of the screen So it brought a whole new dimension to the gameplay And the controller was actually designed with an analogue joystick to be able to control that movement It started to add a whole new dimension into what gamers were used to And so for a long time it had been this sort of parallaxing planes But as you sort of moved into that era you started to see people start to play with you know what are the kinds of mechanics we can do now What are the things that we can actually play with Whats this new world of this other dimension And so you know it was painful at first Certainly there were good examples of it but it was hard Its hard to give the players this whole other level of freedom that they werent used to And then we started getting consoles that were bigger and better and you could bring in you know more of a environment better frame rate and better sound And then you could put more polygons on the screens so the guys could look more realistic Finally with the PlayStation and the PlayStation you started to see some really interesting stuff happening You started to get you know avatars on screen that were more representative of people Theyre easier to understand what they were tryin to make you go through Especially on the PlayStation it started to feel like we have enough graphics to really render interesting people You know they werent real but they were real enough And so you could sort of start to believe in them more had grown the business pretty well and was starting to look at the console business and thinking Wow that would be a nice business for us to be in But we really didnt know anything about it And then one day these guys walked into my office They were from the Direct team and they said they had this idea to put Direct into a box It was gonna be this Direct box And Direct is the name of the Windows for gaming So this Direct box was basically it was gonna act like a game console on the outside but on the inside it was really gonna be a running Windows and Direct That was the original plan And so what think we didnt really understand at the time was that we were really bridging these two worlds that Xbox was gonna be this bridge between what was happening in gaming culture and what was happening in console gaming culture And then when we got to the PlayStation we really said Okay this things gonna give us enough power to really go back and revisit that idea of telling an interesting characterdriven narrative in a way that we might be able to do that no ones done before First time that held a Wii controller it was a piece of plywood with some electronics taped onto it and they had a demo of a tennis game And when first picked it up and started playin it thought This is gonna be a hit That was the first thing that popped into my head It was just so much fun The Xbox s a spectacular console Its just fantastic absolutely love it And like the as well Not really interested in you know the holy wars about which one is better guess theyre fan boy arguments is how you can say it Like like Nintendo like Sega like Sony you know its think this is actually what happens because was a kid wouldve had a Genesis and a Super Nintendo wouldve had a Nintendo and a Sega Master System if couldve afforded it but you know youre a child You cant afford all that stuff So then you start defending the one you have and think thats where that comes from Xbox No PlayStation still to this day stay up till four in the morning playing the latest Xbox that came out yesterday or whatever it may be m you know always constantly still immersing myself in it With the continuous waves of technical and artistic changes sweeping over the industry and games getting better and bigger the video game industry began to anchor itself within the public consciousness many starting to argue that games are as much an art form as anything The trouble is with art is its a subjective term You know one persons art is another persons rubbish And this is where you know you come back to the semantics of the word art which is problematic Whether that is a film or whether that is a book or whether that is a painting or whether that is a computer game it elicits a response It makes you think about the world or look at the world in a slightly different way ve always believed that games are absolutely an art form You know as Phil Fish said its the culmination of every form of art and expression that mankind has ever had goes into a game You look at the staff that builds a video game You have a music composer You have a writer You have an artist who does sketch work You have a technical artist You have level designers who create spaces much like architects It really is kind of the Avengers of talent when you really think about it Nowhere is it more obvious than in video games You have these artists creating these beautiful threedimensional worlds And the technology allowing players to come into those worlds and have them be as real as possible is the ultimate example of art and science working together The best description of art ever heard from a professor of mine when was going for my was that art is somebody whose put together something that deliberately provokes a response in an audience The consumer actually is a participant in the art Its almost like being part of a great art experiment about a living art experiment Yeah theres a lot of like basic logistics Like you push and this happens or you push up and that happens But if thats all games were we wouldnt be playing them anymore you know We wouldve lost interest a long long time ago Surprisingly modern game technology is still based on the same fundamental concept of early game tech combining new layers of science and art to reach higher levels of innovation and expression Modern game systems represent not only quantum leaps in hardware and graphics but also the utilization of parallel data processing and memory within the Cloud What does all that mean Simply put it means from here on out anyone will be able to play any game anywhere at anytime with amazing speed and quality The Cloud is something that you hear a lot about these days and theres really two very different concepts The first one is the one that we all sort of understand as being the Cloud You know ve got a picture wanna upload it wanna tweet This is all being uploaded into the Cloud and stored on hard drives So think of the normal version of the Cloud as a lot of storage space Theres another very very big idea which is why not use the computers and the Cloud to give you computing power thats far beyond what you would generally want to purchase for yourselves And what that means is that the software that you would love to experience will be running there and then the actual the video or the output from the game is delivered directly to wherever you are on whatever device youre on Theres more processing power in the Cloud behind Xbox One than the complete processing power that was on the planet in the year Were now able to put scenes on screen that are almost beyond lifelike in some ways But then you have the power of the Cloud behind that box that allows us to draw upon thousands of servers to help make the box thats in your home actually significantly more powerful than it is by itself But there was a time when the future of this now mega industry was in serious jeopardy After the explosive financial and cultural success of the first generation of video games the industry began to think it was invincible You know when all these companies saw that there was a market for video games and they just you know they flooded the market with so many games You know there were a few companies out there that really wanted to show they have a really awesome game but then there were you know for every one really awesome game there were really crappy games What happened was there was this manufacturing of great expectations that the next Christmas would be better than the previous one And people just sort of moved on People got tired of being sold the same thing again and again with pretty poor entertainment experience People started to produce games at a kind of very accelerated rate And the quality of the gameplay went down substantially to the point of where some of the games were so bad that they ended up havin to throw a lot of them in landfills With scores of new game developers springing up overnight and venture capitalists pouring money into what seemed to be a sure thing product the writing was on the wall The market was becoming saturated and in the final nail was driven home Atari made a deal with Universal Studios to create a video game adaptation of the popular movie The Extra Terrestrial Only from Atari made especially for systems from Atari the video game that lets you help get home Just in time for Christmas Happy Holidays With only weeks to make the game Atari scrambled to put out a subpar product Overconfident and high on their previous success in the fall of Atari shipped millions of cartridges despite its poor quality The backlash was legendary It caused a ripple effect throughout the entire games industry and by the summer of consumer confidence in video games had reached an all time low and Atari along with many other rising game companies went down like the Titanic So there came a lot of conflict and the whole management style blew up and Warner basically took over They put their man in Ray Kassar who was from the east coast no experience in entertainment in games technology or Silicon Valley And he just didnt really understand or play games So when youre that way its really hard as a president to really assess the quality of whats going on It was that kind of attitude and creating terrible product that was driven by advertising and marketing and not by any content and guess what It didnt sell The one story about s cartridges being buried in the desert is actually a true one The fact that Atari rushed this game just to have it out with the movie to use the license of cause was huge in the s Both the and the PacMan games those were two of the games that didnt do well they were trying to cram something into the Atari that it did not want to do The big crash happened in and toy stores were unloading consoles for next to nothing Everybody just thought they could schlock any sort of games onto the system and it was the first lesson that the industry learned in the fact that the consumers are smart especially gamers and you cant just put shuffleware out there and fool them They will not buy it But after the crash they realized that you know for a lot of people itd been a fad but for a core group of people they still wanted to play games For a couple of years after the crash many people thought that American video games would be relegated to the popular fads section of st century encyclopedias and forgotten Enter Nintendo a Japanese toy company who understood that the popularity of classic games like PacMan Donkey Kong and Pitfall proved that people liked to play as a character not just a spaceship or nameless block of pixels Even with the crudity of the early bit graphics the concept of immersion and being a character was still very appealing to the public And little did the world know their favorite videogame character was just around the corner This is Nintendo a flashy little computer that lets you play video games on your set This is called Game Boy and industry analysts say that there may be a run on this as the holiday demand exceeds the supply This is Super Mario its been a longawaited game Super Mario of course was very very popular Super Mario was extremely popular now Super Mario is coming out Its been the best selling toy in this country for three years running Twenty million of these things now inhabit American living rooms Inhabit is a very good word Because of the crash no retailer wanted to touch a quoteunquote video game system And so a lot of what we did was to try to come up with something that was uniquely different it wasnt just a game system it had other features to it And eventually we came up with the Robotic Operating Buddy and the Zapper Gun and two cartridges and we sold it as an entertainment system Even with that it was a hard sell to get the retailers to take it but it was fairly successful And during that first initial phase Super Mario came out and that sold like hot cakes It was an extremely successful title Nintendo Entertainment System was think you know a big landmark system you know because before that there was a real question mark about whether or not video games were gonna be able to stay popular You know theres the big video game crash and then Nintendo showed us how we can bring them back and make them really popular again remember seeing Super Mario Brothers for the first time and just being completely blown away it was like Wow theres an arcade in my house This is the coolest thing ever And Mario Brothers was great and Zelda was great and so put a lot of hours as a player into those early Nintendo games love those early Nintendo games saw the Nintendo Entertainment System and said Wow this is new unique different bringing new experiences to the consumer saw the original Mario Brothers and said Wow this is new this is different The same for the original Legend of Zelda So after the video game crash kinda fell out of love with games for a while and just ignored them And then one day a neighbor kid down the street go over to his house and he has this gray box with this the Robot and he has the Zapper Gun and were playing this Duck Hunt game and then he fires up the Super Mario game and was like Okay this is some nextlevel stuff And remember the first time that jumped and hit a block that was there that didnt know was there one of the secret blocks with an extra life in it my mind just exploded cause like here are secrets in games now With the rebirth of the games industry a new breed of gamers was rising The appetite for simple mazebased games was waning Gamers were ready for more Becoming a character living out a virtual story and being absorbed in something otherworldly was not just technically possible now but the expectations for deeper more immersive experiences was growing As the game business evolved um people were making larger and more complicated games requiring page manuals and hours of gameplay to get into You never really cared about the characters in Gauntlet you know It was just that Gauntlet was an addictive game But now we not only spend more money on games but we see them as entertainment mediums where we want to be invested in the story we want to be invested in the world The huge difference is that the older games think were a lot tougher Like if you did not get your jump exactly right to land on a platform you were not getting through that level Timing was everything now you have a lot more freedom You can you can kill a boss many different ways It used to be before that the whole point of a game was literally shooting pixelated aliens that were falling out of the sky but we didnt know why those aliens were falling out of the sky we didnt care why those aliens were falling out of the sky we just wanted to shoot them But nowadays not only do we know why those aliens are falling out of the sky we know the names of their moms and we know their future childrens names and we know we have to destroy all of them feel like games as theyve developed throughout time have kept a lot of the same traits theyve just sort of um manipulated how they act in the game world because people have different desires for games They want to be more involved they dont want to just sit down and sit at a bar for a little while and play Pong they want to actually be invested in that game world a little more In the beginning it was simply the industry understanding What are these mechanics How do players interact with an interactive medium As we started to understand those rules a little bit better other aspects of crafting something really highend or beautiful get worked in And so highend graphics start to become more relevant because were you know learning how visuals interact with the storytelling and interact with the gameplay In those days the game designers main job was to create the rules of a game that is all It was very much like chess or cards In the s with PlayStation and more powerful technology arriving we had the gift of expression Games became characters could talk music could be created characters could emote through detailed facial expressions In the late s and early s the industry was reinvigorated with new technology new customers and new talent renaissance in game design was arriving which not only gave birth to some of the greatest video games of all time but eventually a new industry that would generate billions of dollars and a new generation of game designers In the fall of a small group of computer science students at Stanford Universitys Artificial Intelligence Laboratory got the idea to convene the very first Intergalactic Spacewar Olympics with the use of the computer labs very own Contestants fought it out on the machines at the time impressive inch raster display Two events were held fiveman freeforall and a team competition In Spacewar five distinctively rendered vessels nicknamed Pointy Fins Roundback Birdie Funny Fins and Flatback battled to the death in the displays circular arena dominated by a star whose gravitational pull drew them to the center This was the very first video game tournament and the beginning of a community that would soon become a culture In my dorm room we would throw cables over the balcony down to other peoples computers and start these kind of homebrewed competitions where we were playing all kinds of games from shooters to Ss to anything that we could just play together Doom was like a bomb dropped on my s lived in a house with a bunch of other geeky guys that used to play Dungeons and Dragons with and we first got Doom and built a in our house and we had network cable going from each room and oh my God that was all we did for like the next year could swear it was just play Doom and Doom four players And just something about blowing your friend in half and then hearing him in the next room like curse at you like nothing is more satisfying Growing up in America the one place you go was the mall was like that as a child and remember there was an arcade at the mall near our house called The Dream Machine and it was this stygian cave of noise and all these portals to all these other worlds you could go in and out of Mr Do Dragons Lair Joust Centipede Frogger all of them And every time a new game would show up would be around it and on it and there would be crowds around it And eventually to the point where fighting games became a thing later on You would literally go up and put your quarter next in line and try and take down that one kid whos kicking everybodys butt as ChunLi There was a time period where kids in arcade games who could rule like at Chuck Cheese or at the mall arcade or at the in my case a lot of time the bowling center people would crowd around you if you were owning a game global society was born society that now not only plays and connects online but has produced lifelong friendships thriving communities even marriages And this community doesnt just exist for entertainments sake Gamers are not only one of the most connected and vocal groups they are some of the most loyal Friendships forged within a game experience somehow yield a bond that isnt easily broken One of the things that is really exciting about games in general is that theyve evolved far beyond the local community aspect of being able to you know just play the game or enjoy your game with some of your local friends into truly global experiences where you can share your passion with people all around the world love the connectivity have lifelong friends that ve met online and we started out just playing together and then ended up you know meeting up for competitions or just meeting to go hand out and kind of actually meet each other in person and it sounds silly but a lot of those friendships are really solidified around that joint experience that you have while youre playing a game and think that thats something special its something magical Thats something saw working kinda in the internet industry all through the s and the early s was people um who would meet other people online and become really enamored with them and sometimes move to another city to try living with this person or you know people would get married or meet that way and thats a whole new kind of human relationship that didnt exist or years ago Its like a new thing people can meet and fall in love and not have ever met in the real world cant tell you how many stories weve gotten of people being hookups because of people eventually getting married because of the game people that have gone through you know some sort of horrible medical condition that theyve had to deal with and the games kind of let them work through that see that you know deaths of key characters really affected people and made them cry in the game or they got tattoos of the logo of the game on their bodies or a man and his wife met on Xbox Live playing the game and now they play coop every night There are kids out there who exist now because their parents met in World of Warcraft you know Like um video games have changed the you know the course of human evolution to some degree and created whole new mating rituals and ways of social interaction that didnt exist and thats as a result of the internet and video games so its gonna be interesting to watch all of that evolve video games are gonna get more and more real and connect more and more people around the world used to play EverQuest quite a lot as many EverQuest players did guy that met in South Karana Ping we became friends ended up going to his wedding ten years later were family friends now and its phenomenal because we have this shared passion for games we had a lot of similar values and ideas and we had a lot of great shared experiences online where we really formed a deep bond and true friendship and has blossomed into a great longlasting friendship in the real world saw someone recently speaking about he uh a boy whose parents were killed in a car accident so he was left alone in the world and and without video games to sort of fall back into hed be sitting in his room depressed out of his mind and his video game world and all his friends in his video game world really supported him through that really painful time and the guy who was observing this was basically saying You guys dont really understand it cause know you hear this all the time that violent video games are the problem in the world et cetera et cetera but games are so meaningful to people and the friends that they build around it and the sort of the creativity and the immersion and everything else that comes with it is actually very valuable and its something you learn a lot from walked into the stairwell here and this shooting cant even really describe it but basically fell down the stairs um cause had had a stroke as they later revealed to me ended up in the hospital for about nine ten days and youre really scared and you really dont know where to mean youre like sad and you have all this anger and you dont know where to aim it and my friends started bringing stuff up to me and at first it was food and then they started bringing ways to play games up got a little Nintendo um and was playing Zelda on that and had a laptop and was playing mean had Steam on there and had just and Left Dead and Borderlands and that really was the turning point at the hospital where wasnt as scared guess anymore wasnt as mad had something to do um Cause part of the stroke that was awful was went blind out of my right eye and its sort of crazy how not just the games in the hospital that really got me through it its been everyone around me in this industry In all different companies and all different states So yeah in a very literal way think video games really did kinda save my life The world is now engulfed in an artistic social and technological revolution like never before Interactive entertainment is the ultimate expression and delivery format but who will determine what stories are told and how we will experience them in the future The answer is simple Children have a limitless capacity for wonder imagination and creativity and they arent afraid to fail When learned history in school it was the most boring old books with black and white images in them and saw a girl in a video recently from Carnegie Mellon that was talking about trebuchets which is this old medieval siege weapon But she had actually experienced using one because of course she had done it in a virtual world And to have think she was six to have a six year old girl telling you her opinion of medieval siege weapons versus my version of it which was so incredibly boring is a fundamental change to education through entertainment that can make history and things like that much more engrossing My kid he is and he is faster at things that m not as fast at He is better at things and its because while his mind was developing he had access to interactive media that was much more advanced than the interactive media that had and the interactive media that had was the first time My parents didnt have any interactive media when their brains were developing Video games think they provide a space for learning how to fail safely and successfully think as a culture we have a real obsession with always getting things right Were afraid of failing Video games provide us this very safe space to learn how to problemsolve to think through an issue that we cant quite get right to help us realize that its okay to fall on our face occasionally if we learn from that and we eventually can succeed Because its simulation we can do things and experience things and practice things and test things that either arent feasible or arent safe in real life in the real world Despite the mainstream acceptance of video games in the s and early s by the late s the term gamer still seemed to be a close cousin to geek or nerd If you were a serious dedicated gamer you were seen as part of a strange subculture But the winds of change were blowing and this perception would soon shift Being a gamer would soon be en vogue can feel it burn Were taking over were taking over Now try to lead them will they ever learn Were taking over were taking over Every time breathe in can feel it burn Were taking over were taking over Now try to lead them will they ever learn Were taking over were taking over Hands up in the sky let me hear you say Every time breathe in can feel it burn Were taking over were taking over Its a borderline religious experience to stand in the middle of an eSports stadium packed full of tens of thousands of players cheering for their favorite teams Its just awesome to see because its easy to doubt that that kind of passion would actually manifest in a physical environment and people would pay hundreds of dollars or travel thousands of miles to come to these events to watch people play video games and they do and they love it ve always been kinda frustrated by the perception of video game nerdiness and things like that Um for my career making games that feel like summer blockbusters and dont feel like you know basement games to having the courage to put myself out there on camera and put on a clean shirt and kind of change that perception as well to just evangelizing games overall and to also evangelize the career And so over the course of my plus year career in this business ve always hoped that there are some kids out there who see a football player or you know astronaut and theyre like Yeah thats awesome but you know maybe video games Maybe thats where want to be And there are a lot of people wholl message me or send me emails and they they are just miserable because theyre super lonely they havent found their friend group you know And think thats sort of like my mission is to connect people and make people happy and give people friends cause never had that growing up never had my nerd group think thats how communities have really started up its just being able to find people with similar interests You know when youre a kid its really only like if your next door neighbor played but now were all adults and have the ability to reach out and connect with someone else Its clearly a culture where everybodys having fun everybodys got a smile on their face Theyre living their life in a very very you know powerful way The old way of sort of Oh computers are for geeks and stuff and video games are for geeks has died is dead No one doesnt have Facebook Angry Birds people dont almost dont even think of that as a video game People dont think of Theres become this blur of like what is a video game and what isnt Is Facebook a video game kind of think it is mean its interactive like a video game and you can do stuff on it The worlds really different now and think its because those of us that grew up being ostracized and looked down upon and treated like we were radioactive by mainstream culture created our own culture and we took the things that we love We took the video games and we took the technology and we took that engineering and we built our own world out of those things and that world is so awesome that the mainstream culture that made fun of us when we were kids for loving this culture thats so awesome could not deny it and could not help but be seduced by it Were celebrating video game week starting today From Studio in Rockefeller Center the National Broadcasting Company presents Late Night With Jimmy Fallon Look it looks slick come on Well its the most powerful video game console ever made We were targeting about ten times the performa Ten times really Yeah ten times didnt think you can get better than but you can ten times guess Were gonna play this together So this is Super Mario World Yeah yeah thats my man love Mario broke a sweat on that video game Ladies and gentlemen heres a professional actor reading the line Itsa me Mario in a very dramatic way Itsa me Mario Hey Conan Brien here Once again know absolutely nothing about video games which is why ve decided to review them Take a girl for a ride Oh my God ve never licked a remote before look like John Tesh after hes been dead a year What did she just say hate tombs Yeah guess what than dont be a tomb raider Oh m sorry meant to compliment her and almost kicked her In the late s with realism in games reaching new levels and more visceral action packed fare appearing on game shelves a new conversation started Violence home video games isnt holding back the violence Mortal Kombat two of the bloodiest games to date were released yesterday This game encourages players to shoot this gun which is called a Justifier Kids who play video games too often are more likely to be violent Thats the finding of a new study out of Japans Tohoku University There was no rating on this game at all when the game was introduced have a great deal of information that is racist sexist and promotes models of violence recommendations on guns after that series of meetings and as you mentioned the latest with video game makers who said Dont blame us Theres always a lot of media talking about violence in video games and certainly there are violent video games but thats not how you describe the medium of gaming If were to go to the cinema and were to just watch Saw movies and came away and you asked me what felt about the cinema would say It was the most disgusting violent gratuitous thing And thats what the media has done is its focused on a few titles and that has ended up in consumers minds defining what this industry is Its weird how when you watch the people you know they go to Congress and theyre angry you know Our kids are being corrupted m like Yeah exactly your kids You should be not corrupting them leave em alone ten hours a day mean its like finding your dads Playboys under the bed and then blaming Playboy You know were just like any other industry that that we have these ratings systems in place and theres gonna be something for everybody We put measures in place are our guidelines We make sure that we build our game to the rating It gets checked on a regular basis The interesting thing think with games is that we actually have an even better ratings system than movies but theres still kinda this this general misunderstanding with the elder generation that somehow all games are like Grand Theft Auto People like to make just kind of a causal link and say video games cause violence and its like Well lets see so theres more crime in the summer and more ice cream is sold in the summer therefore ice cream causes crime Thats not how legitimate scientific research works Violence unfortunately is a part of human nature and last time checked Cain didnt bludgeon Abel with a Game Boy Genghis Khan didnt have an Xbox Live account and you know Hitler didnt play Crash Bandicoot We have unfortunately had a lot of gun crime in the United States recently and remember someone tweeted after one of the most recent incidences that when people started accusing video games of being an influence for this they were like Wow wonder how all those other countries with the same exact video games as us dont have as much gun crime You know itd be like saying We dont want anyone to go watch movies because all movies are violent But people dont say that because everyone really understands movies as a medium dont believe that video games are murder simulators If anything what the statistics prove is that its exactly the opposite Weve survived a lot of things as gamers for a really long time Weve survived Congress weve survived busybody parents weve survived religiousbased hysteria You realize that its about imagination and invention and a connection to a world and it doesnt have these big trappings that people apply to them So think its a problem thats just gonna naturally evolve away and we just have to defend the industry until that evolution happens The campfire Weve all been there whether an actual campfire or just listening to someone tell a great story As humans we have always had the ability and desire to suspend our disbelief If only for a few minutes a day we want to escape from the treadmill of life and give it up to be immersed in something outside ourselves We have this opportunity to be storytellers to be able to give the consumer the opportunity to lose themself in a world for as long or as little as they want We have the realities of life every day whether its the economy or whether its getting by or whether its a job and earning money but we have a medium that we can lose ourselves in Daytoday life isnt always that exciting and if at the end of the day you can turn on a tablet a a console and just kind of escape into another world think its a wonderful thing that essentially allows you to kind of live the dream The storytelling in games is just as good as movies Its just as good as reading a book With the resurrection and renaissance of the industry coming into the s and early s games began another evolutionary step forward Story This fundamentally changed the audiences expectations of what a good game really was and raised the bar for game designers everywhere Storytelling in games is a tricky tricky beast to tame As game makers we have to set up rules we have to set up universes that make sense and have their own sense of logic and once weve established what that logic is then we let the players mind and imagination solve problems and work their way through those worlds think one of the things weve really learned over the last maybe decade is ways to tell stories without a cut scene without stopping the interactivity to have the story be something that emerges from the play itself Video games are a lean forward experience whereas film and television are a lean back experience Youre driving every moment of the game friend of mine a while back actually compared games to novels in the fact that if you stop reading the novel doesnt keep going Video games are very much the same Telling a story in video games can be a lot more difficult because then you have to you have to anticipate the actions of the player whereas in a movie you decide what both characters say and then you write it down and thats what they say Storytelling in games is an interesting problem right now because we dont fully understand it The movie industry has been around for a hundred years or whatever and they have a really good idea of what it means to tell a story in that kind of visual medium and the game industry doesnt have all those rules yet Either reading a book or watching a movie its completely passive Youre letting the storyteller give you their vision of their world or whatever story they want to tell you and you are youre listening to it its unfolding for you Youre not affecting that With a game the journey is the reward more than say the ending or the payoff This is our routine Day and night all we do is survive It never lets up The idea of spontaneity within storytelling is something thats unique to video games You cant just change how a song sounds midway through You cant just change the end of a book while youre reading it but in certain games your decisions have a direct outcome on the ultimate fate of characters and thats unique and sweet And think thats what people respond to Can you imagine if you were redoing Star Wars and you get to Empire Strikes Back and Vader says Join me and you as Luke Skywalker go Okay And then the rest of the movie and all of Jedi are completely different because you made that choice And that is where think video games fundamentally and vastly differ from every other kind of nerd media that love Who lives who dies get it Were meant to choose Heads up there he goes Guns down You dont have to get involved We must choose If you insist do not see how could save the lives of other people also lost someone loved Whether the classic Arthurian legends or more modern translations one thing humanity has never had a problem with is the willing suspension of our disbelief The earliest storytellers saw the primal power in writing reading and telling stories true or fictional think that once you show a player what a world looks like and how a world functions they get into the world and then that is their reality And so think as modern game makers we have to keep remembering that the suspension of disbelief comes from the creation of a universe and the creation of a world and an immersive world that has rules that are predictable and that are logical and not from the visual eye candy that we get you know with all this horsepower And now that we have these consoles that deliver mindblowing graphics and beautiful explosions and immersive worlds theres something more to it Weve taken our inspirations from outside of games with emotion and character development and storytelling in a way that weve tried to break new ground that you have an association and an attachment with a character in a game that makes you want to feel for that story makes you want to feel like youre there making the decisions all along the way Good storytelling is not just entertainment Good stories can help us grow They can teach us about the past and challenge us to aspire to higher and greater things The story experience in a video game is no different the campfire is just a bit brighter and more colorful So many things have to perfectly sync up for it to work You have art you have writing you have music you have backgrounds you have timing you have the voice actors you have acting and then video games you have everything on top of that it has to be an engaging user experience as well so think a good video game think is probably the hardest thing to make If you want emotion you need the human face and in the world of film that is the cheapest thing that you can get You point the camera at somebody and you have it instantly But in the world of games you have a multimillion investment in technology before you see anything that looks like a human face think the most exciting part about this industry is that were constantly inventing and being fearless about that challenge of invention And inventions difficult because if you already knew what it was going to be you wouldnt be inventing it It would already exist right So whenever we invent whether its a design idea or a stylistic thing or you know something related to the story we kind of depend upon this trust that there will be inspiration that there will be revelation Then you gotta get in and start prototyping stuff so you build a bunch of prototypes and you start trying to understand hey are the ideas we had really fun once you put them into an interactive environment You know think at the alpha stage hopefully well see the fun Its pins and needles time because its that awkward teenage years that you know youve got could be an awesome experience it could really come together nicely everyones really enthusiastic because theres something there to play from beginning to end but you know there are some weird elements to it and you know you just had a bunch of people come through and point out all your you know awkwardness your buck teeth and your you know crazylookin eyebrow and all that stuff and youre sort of hoping that okay see that understand it now need to kind of go back and fix those things a little bit make myself a little prettier get back out on the street and show myself off again You start layering on all the really rich assets things like a great story the high fidelity art the fully detailed characters and once you start marrying the super high production quality with those original bare bones prototypes of your design ideas you can start really bringing the product together And then the work to go from alpha to beta is generally speaking a laundry list of things that we have to check off and make sure are working properly We dont touch those as much at alpha but they certainly are on our minds at that point as we start to kind of polish up the game make those adjustments to the gameplay really try to hone down on whats working well and maybe give it some more resources and time to develop and sort of put aside those things that arent working as well One of the big revolutions we had in the s was we started bringing in people to play our games and watched them play Thats it But it transformed the way that we make games mean up until that point wed pretty much been making the games for ourselves and so if we thought it was fun we were done You sort of had to make a game and then do you know kind of one of these Did it feel right You know youd have your department but you know they were paid employees so you never know if youre getting the best feedback But now we have this beta testing and ability to talk with the fans and if youre utilizing that correctly its really powerful So you hand this what you think is the gold master off to the first party in the console world anyway The sides definitely still more of a wild west but theres a lot of backlash certainly if you cant deliver quality or you have lots of bugs in a product So you hand it off to Microsoft Sony Nintendo and you wait and you wait and you wait And usually its you know a tenday waiting game and you know its always the most nerveracking time is that okay is this gonna make it through And so you know we get that call maybe or email you know maybe ten days later or so and you know its Hey looks good Celebration ensues Or Youve got these critical issues and these minor issues and you need to fix you know the critical issues and as many minor issues as you can and resubmit And yeah and then it hits the streets People either love it or hate it most of the time both You get you know you get both ends no matter how good your game is And you sort of have to you roll with the punches you let people say their piece look out today things have changed beyond belief Titles we saw man years of programming art work and design work went into them Its astonishing Its making a movie times a thousand It is daunting dont know why do it The evolution of great storytelling in video games couldnt have come at a better time It seems as if the technology rose to the occasion at precisely the right moment From the turn of the century to now games have never looked better felt better or played better Enter the nextnext generation m feeling so good so incredible Some sort of chemical is spreading thick around my brain ve got the sun and wont let it go It burns a fire in my veins Lets get out tonight Youve got the fire ve got the fight Whoa In my young blood Lets light up the dark Youve got the fuel ve got the spark Whoa In my young blood Our Ms are in the red Driving closer to the edge Up on Flagstaff Road still remember what you said Are you living Are you dead You better let me know Put on display just like a cinema Standing naked on the stage And m unashamed Its so easy to be cynical Lets turn around and start again Lets get out tonight Youve got the fire ve got the fight Whoa In my young blood Lets light up the dark Youve got the fuel ve got the spark Whoa In my young blood Oh Ohohohohoh In my young blood Its funny because every few years the industry really kind of reinvents itself whether thats we figure out a new way to give that experience to players or theres a new piece of hardware out there or some new technology some new interface Theres always that new challenge Right now is a really difficult time for the industry We are in transition of consoles and we are seeing a lot of the economic score cards have come in about what games do and do not make money and which are the best to be doing Honestly its so hard to predict mean no one would predict that the platforms that are most popular right now five years ago or ten years ago no one would have predicted that thats what would be the norm now Every new console generation we get more and more horsepower and every console generation there are people who say Is this enough Okay oh this is really awesome And then five minutes later Eh guess it wasnt that awesome need a new awesome thing you know because were just so spoiled with it The medium has grown up a lot from the early days think part of it is that we finally have the technology to render characters in a believable way As we look as a studio how were gonna evolve our new and moving into this next phase the next generation of consoles were having to think outside the box Were having to look at how we set the foundation of a structure for the next ten years think at this point were in a pretty interesting crossroads in the history of games Publishers especially in companies are fairly risk averse right now because everybody foresees a big change happening and nobody knows what it is often compare indie developers and big huge studios to a couple of guys in a Zodiac raft and an entirely fullyloaded battleship Each one has its own strengths and think where the indie guys literally and figuratively run circles around the big publishers is that theyre a lot more mobile They dont have to make as many complicated boardroombased decisions They can focus on the kind of game that they want to make and because of things like Steam they can take their game make it awesome and then get it directly to players who then spread the existence of their game because they love it so much that theyre telling other people about it theyre sharing it on forums theyre giving it to their friend lists and they dont really need to make that investment of ridiculous amounts of money on advertising and marketing The games have beautiful graphics big budgets incredible art teams but thats not always necessarily what makes a great game Really whenever a platform has opened itself up to allow hobbyists to be able to create products you get incredible amounts of innovation The interesting thing about that is when you get to a team of like people the ability to innovate is pretty much zero You have to basically go with what was designed originally and thats what the game becomes The smaller the team the more you can discover the really important flashes of lightning and flashes of insight that happen after large parts of the game are done And then youre like Oh you know what would be really cool is in this section and that section if we could do this You know and if you have a person team you cant pivot on a dime like that you have to be like Well that would be nice but we dont have time and we have to get done do think that theres like a revolution afoot in gaming where people are interested in finding those games that have more character and soul than what theyve experienced before large game developer might not be able to take big risks on a virtual reality title that only works in and really utilizes it But in indie theyre driven by passion by wanting to make the best game possible Theyre usually not sitting there saying How can make something that really gives me a nice return on investment And think that thats going to become more and more important in the game space in the coming years Where do we go from here Many think that when it comes to the nextnext generation of the campfire the traditional game controller tied to a screen gameplay experience may have its limitations One of the things m most excited about is virtual reality think a lot of us can remember back in the early s when movies like The Lawnmower Man came out and was gonna be the next big thing and it never really was cause the headsets were big and clunky the graphics were crappy Well thanks to recent advances in smartphone technology and screens and tracking devices is set for a big comeback didnt actually start out to create a virtual reality headset set out to buy a really nice one So tried buying all manner of different head mounts and none of them was really what wanted for playing video games immersively And so said Oh shoot well it looks like m gonna have to actually try to make my own And actually found that it was something that there was a lot of technology that had advanced over the last few years and it was actually something that was finally possible to do How do you walk around in a virtual world How do you physically move in a natural way beyond just sitting down and using a keyboard and mouse Thats why we developed the Omni Its an interface that allows you to walk and move freely and naturally in your favorite game Well when you break it all down hope we never get rid of the kind of gaming where just get to sit on a couch and push some buttons for a while Could those early pioneers whose ideas eventually gave birth to an industry have guessed what it one day would become Would it be foreign to them Or did they have a feeling from the beginning that the ideas and creativity of each generation of new designers and artists would forever reinvent the medium You know back when we were working on games on the Atari think people would have laughed if you said This is gonna be a meaningful art form and its gonna be in The Smithsonian one day never thought it would amount to anything Nolan was running around saying Oh its gonna be a big industry Were gonna sell millions of games and its gonna take over And fully expected that Atari was gonna fail until the day Nolan and Joe came back from visiting Warner He informs us they want to pay this money for us you know like million or million dollars It was like What The amazing thing for us you know back in the early days is we envisioned this We really did look forward to a day where video games would be interactive movies would look like interactive movies And mean we are there The spirit of curiosity and invention that was there at the industrys creation is still its driving force Todays game designers continue to give audiences new and fresh interpretations of classic stories What began as a single pixel has now redefined what storytelling is for the st century and beyond The future of games inherently gets tied up into the future of technology in a lot of ways And its really hard to know beyond a couple of years where technology is gonna go We have a faster rate of invention than probably any medium before it think video games in the next to years are going to be unimaginable where you cant tell fantasy from reality and you can live the dream that youve always wanted to live They have a lot of really intelligent people becoming intelligent through the use of this stuff Video games feel like are inching towards the holodeck because thats the end goal is to have to be as much like real life as possible Couldnt the whole world just be digitized and that make it an easier safer and better place could see us getting there and getting there quick What is the ineffable sort of characteristics that make real life important think this is what video games are going to start challenging in the next years The size and scope of the modern video game industry might well be far beyond the greatest expectations of the men who began it But games will continue to be created as they always have by drawing on history and culture imagination and technology to deliver stories and experiences that delight and challenge generations to come whatever form the games may take think thats why a lot of nerds play video games because we have it pretty tough we dont quite fit in But in a game we always fit in Always Even though make them every day even though play broken games for years before theyre perfect and we put them on a shelf and you know theres so many issues that go along with that still have the capability of being transported back to that little kid wrapped in a blanket staying up way too late sitting in front of a tiny television obsessed And really really wanna give that to another eightyearold kid and have him feel the same thing thirty years from now as well Its the same reason that kids play cowboys and Indians when theyre young or you saw Star Wars you wanted to be that Its fantasy fulfillment and being able to do fantasy fulfillment on the level of fully interactive worlds that you can explore and get lost in It was how to get my game to delight as many people as possible And its coming back to this fundamental thing that we do in the games industry is delight people is entertain people You know used to say to people you know Someday everybodyll be a gamer And you know that was like an aspirational thing Now cant even use that line anymore because everybody cause its like duh well everybody is There is something which we never expected which was an assumption youd have in the film industry to some degree that youd make a film and people could archive the film and see it decades or hundreds of years later In the game industry never thought that would be the case And seeing people who are still loving these old games means that theyll probably be surviving for decades to come in some form or another There are a lot of people that have dreams like to say everyone who has ever had a shower has had a good idea Its the people who dry off and do something about them that make the difference think the world is way too interesting to dwell on your past And m proud of my participation in this industry but think that what is really more remarkable is how we can take all the things weve learned and push it yet one step further You know said its true can feel the love can you feel it too can feel it ahah You know said its true can feel the love can you feel it too can feel it ahah can feel it ahahahah You know said its true You know said said said You know said its true You know said said said You know said its true can feel the love can you feel it too can feel it ahah You know said its true can feel the love can you feel it too can feel it ahah Nananana No oh oh yeah No no no no all right gotta tell you gotta tell you Tell you gotta tell you Tell you gotta tell you Tell you Tell you You know said its true You know can feel it too can feel it now You know said its true can feel the love can you feel it too can feel it ahah You know said its true can feel the love can you feel it too can feel it ahah You know said its true can feel the love can you feel it too can feel it ahah can feel it can feel it can feel it can you feel it too Too Ah can still remember some of the music think my favorite memory from playing video games was when first played Bonks Adventures The one with the fighter and the one with the motorcycle things BurgerTime loved BurgerTime Oh Crystal Castles Ghosts n Goblins would close my eyes and see falling Tetris blocks and thats when knew Tetris was going to be my favorite video game of all time And the elevators Its something my family and have always bonded over Its the common topic around dinner tables and its molded and sculpted my life into what it is today My wife is kinda like my mom when it comes to video games She tries to regulate how much play First game that actually remember playing was Pitfall for the Atari Its from that point on that had a special place in my heart as a gamer And also the Atari had so many problems Like if it got dusty your games didnt work so youd have to blow on the games and bang the games This is really cool Excuse me Being an engineer think this place needs more cross bracing One of my favorite gaming memories ever is the first year that signed up for Extra Life and in the first year raised over dollars for the childrens hospital of my choice and it made me so proud to be a gamer Thank you And playing Return to Castle Wolfenstein and met a lot of great guys during that some still consider friends even though ve never met them in real life Wherever the industry takes us next will definitely be there for the ride Gamer forever People kill each other at a toy store in order to get that Nintendo game m one of those people m in space The end
