miras horoscope how was he able to accept her marring a foreigner How can you absolutely know nothing about still dont believe this story Father this is father i know i know this is rasya and this is freddy Your friends from the marine institute know them Vinay told us that you know the past present and future Now im convinced No vinay has told me so much about you Love birds who crossed the border to nest am a bit curious Is it possible to know our future Astrological progressions can only give you an insight to opportunities and trends from the cosmic angle Tell me your date place and time of birth We shall see Because i understand that indian astrology is based on the planets But plutos no more planet This is also based on some misunderstanding According to the nine stars only five planets are included from the solar system So actually it is only the sun and the moon that has the maximum influence on our daily life Much more than other bodies and planets You believe that destiny cannot be changed Sometimes the vibrations from the hymns of the veda they can have some effect That is why we have the prayers Where is mira Mira See whos here Come Hi mira He always talked about you Mira did this mira did that never spoke of another woman He lived with your memories mira for years Each and every second of it every since Why did you ditch him Yes i ditched Not him but my dreams Do you anything about me Do you know anything about my love Nothing Have you ever experienced the pain while sacrificing your love But i did have never lived for myself Its all my faith dont understand Come This is all he left for me dont know when i started loving him Happy birthday Thank you Father read my horoscope and discovered that marriage would hold nothing But tragedy and sorrow for me He performed many rituals and prayers to try cleanse me of this curse Vinay believed in none of it why did you leave me and go Why did you break my heart and go away Where are you now Where are you Wherever you will be there shall be she was very annoyed after vinay left for his studies Will we ever meet again Will my lost love return to me How they realised how they felt about each other He checked the compatibility of our horoscopes He was shocked to learn that we werent destined to be together even for a day He studied every old manuscript he could find a solution He was not able to accept a positive disaster m only saying what im seeing He revealed everything to me In the beginning i could not accept it as my fate But i knew he was never wrong in his prediction Whenever we tried to express our love it was followed by a tragedy engrossed myself in learning treatment from father And devoted more time to practice it Then one day mark came to treat his psoriasis His wife had left him because of his skin condition Mark grew closer to me This is a finally he asked me to marry him Father was surprised to see the compatibility of marks horoscope with mine He believed that the rituals and prayers have brought me this luck of one in a million chance For me it was an exit from everything And i said yes to marks proposal But i didnt know how to face vinay How dare you invite me to your wedding Dont you know i love you You never told me All my life you lived with me and you didnt know You didnt really mean it have made up my mind You made this for me You have given me just one gift That is only that is only your memory Mark was cured by then He understood everything and left very quietly Its all destiny accepting my fate i took a break from my professional study You could have told me everything am sorry this misunderstanding has been very painful You know there are two sides of a coin So close yet never knowing each other You never told me what happened with you tried to forget And you blame me for not telling you everything Youre right am sorry met sandra on my first voyage She was the daughter of my captain It was just the beginning She is beautiful We were like needles in a clock You know difference of breed different purposes Meeting at different times dont even know why we even got married didnt want sam to grow up in an atmosphere like this Dont
