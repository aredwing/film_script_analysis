approval of the minutes of todays meeting Judas Collaborator Nothing lasts forever Lucien Your Mathilde do you know What about her Never mind Is that all right Yes thanks Its just for today It was nothing serious d forgotten to take my pills and thats why this happened Lucien what is going on Why are you avoiding me Whatever gave you that idea You bark on the phone you pretend youre out when

Shell think m your new fiance Just like you think that Alain But its true isnt it never cheated on my wife No No never Not even a little bit What do you mean Youre a liar but can understand why youd lie Why do you think do that Because need a man need his warmth his body Because every now and then want to give myself over to a man when my instinct tells me he can give me what want No questions asked and no strings attached Does that make me evil Are we still friends Youre my sweet friend Astrid really didnt like it the Chinese kitchen It disgusted her She used to say they mixed rat in their food Good oldfashioned Flemish cooking was all she needed Lesson three add a little soja oil Just a little Not too much Lucien said a little oil Now stir it Let me get that Hello Please come in Get him out here Hes in the kitchen Just get him Why did you ring the bell when you have a key Heres your key wont set foot in this house again and dont come knocking at mine Youre a bad person The things youve done to my mother and now me you rotten bastard The things youve done to my mother and me Listen to yourself And Lucien doesnt count suppose because of what Lucien did to your mother and you Its been like that all my life and m fed up with it All the moaning whining and nagging and being bossed around all the time Lucien do this do that dont drink so much dont do that to me She even blamed me for that damn cancer that took her mother Well you can kiss my ass Get out If they want a war then ll give them one Do you think thats wise Its just a misunderstanding Dear editorinchief That professor Verdoodt claims that medical treatment for the over s costs loads of money while being absolutely useless and should therefore be done away with In my opinion these ideas completely destroy the principle of solidarity our Western society is so proud of The elderly whove worked all their lives and paid social contributions would no longer have the right to claim medical care unless they can pay for it Thats a rich mans measure This is not just a subject for the papers but for as well You hit the nail right on the head Lucien Well said Hello were from Mr Knops Rik Sylvia Sorry let me just You can sit next to your father if you like wouldnt want to distract Lucien ll go wait in the garden You wrote an angry letter to The Laatste Nieuws What do you mean shoot What was in the letter think its not right that elderly people who have worked all their lives Can you honestly say you trust those charlatans All theyre good for is getting their face on With all their drivel The world is becoming a decadent place Hes on a roll now How did it go Fantastic Very interesting Just watch the news tonight Mr Knops Madam Were off to interview professor Verdoodt It went well didnt it Is that his nurse round for everyone from the chairman Well the honorary chairman m so glad you dropped by Lucien This is the chap who unseated me Unseated nothing lasts forever Lucien Am right madam Sylvia pleased to meet you You were chairman for thirty years Hows your health Couldnt be better ll take your word for it Sylvia wait Like this Back up a bit more Stay calm and try to relax Put your hand here Max turn on the will you Yes m going to be on the news You on the news They came to interview me Youll be a celebrity then gave them a piece of my mind They thought it went well They congratulated me They were at my place all afternoon must say they were really impressed Stop refunding the medical expenses for the over s Its useless to invest in health insurance schemes for the over s Thats a remarkable theory professor Perhaps but the future of our health insurance is bleak The increase of the ageing population is making it expensive Reactions from the various sectors This guy has benefitted from society all his life He has executed lengthy studies at the expense of society and now as a professor hes getting rich on fees Those involved are also outraged like pensioner Lucien Knops The common man is left in the cold and the rich can afford better doctors You really told them Julien At least you have an opinion And thats important right think he did a good job Very good round for everyone publican Here Lucien Have a cigar Thanks but no thanks have an idea Lets go out tonight just the two of us What did tell you knew had booze in the house somewhere Youve got to
