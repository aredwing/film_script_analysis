predates Darwin and dares suggest that an objective analysis of what it is to live as a human thinking sentient being whose sole trajectory is toward the grave Particularly once children have been reared would have us perhaps choose not to be born at all Imagine that Better not to live than to live and suffer But Eros seduces us not only into striving for the falsely ethereal but worse propagating and thereby subjecting another generation to the same suffering we endure In short to love and reproduce is at some level a sinister enterprise because we deposit offspring into such a shitty world Anyway you look at it grim stuff So Friday then Just years ago was certain the answer was no The Greeks had it right Were just atoms But who knows In your lifetime not mine thank goodness well perhaps become immortal You believe in that stuff Our thoughts anyway Measurable in bits Everything reducible to symbols or their absence used to believe in nothing Now believe in everything My

a half We agreed that we And now twice this morning m sorry ll do right by us just dont know what that means Cant that be good Not knowing It just seems so irrelevant Arguing interpretation with the other people that have read the same text as you Millions would be more accurate Not these days Something mustve kept you interested through a masters program You become accustomed To abject despair To choosing a life that relates directly to very few but quite directly to everyone What if youre fooling yourself That very question is what its all about Fooling ourselves At the heart of human interaction is the agreement that were all going to fabricate Which is to say agree on certain precepts we call truths but would be utter nonsense to anyone not in on the game Consider language We call an elephant an elephant with a certainty that will go so far as to marginalize even ostracize those who refuse Society depends zealously on this so we can structure it In this case communicate with one another even as each of us has his or her own disposition toward elephants Why should philosophy in any form be different Because ultimately who really cares Everyone regardless of how few want to try to understand it which is why ve spent my life gorgeously and so can you Why have you done this to yourself Sophie To know that m here May ask how Curling iron mostly If to be wounded is to exist youre giving yourself a pretty narrow endgame Have you sought counseling Been to health services There is a woman that ve started to see yeah Is she aware of this You have to tell her Will you come with me Well you know Mr Cohen already makes me paranoid enough But thats hours from now Besides hes harmless All you have to do is use the word dichotomy and hell eat out of your hand still dont know what that word means He actually misuses it Specifically its the rhetorical contrasting of opposing or divergent ideas thus the prefix dicho and then tomy meaning to cut Make out with me Hal Yeah think m ready This weekend my parents will be away Is this cause my mom has cancer No asshole Its because want to So its not a sympathy thing If you ask me that one more time were breaking up and you can keep fucking your hand Wow Friday might be tricky but can just tell my parents m staying at Gregs could spend a year like this every day How do you fit it all into one life Mmm You leave the world with things still to do Thats tragic Tragic is becoming satisfied Why didnt meet you years ago Mmm the Atlantic Ocean Child abuse Wheres that one from Malaysia This shape is incredible Mmm The lower and upper sepals are for protection This petal is the labellum and its always the largest It lies flat like that to make it comfortable for pollinators All that beauty is is just about making more of them Right Sam Youve got to be kidding me What is it Thats my daughters teacher ll take your picture And thats my daughter Come on Sophie months What made you start An accident With the iron Cigarette Was it an accident guess not Go on it It concentrated me to the exclusion of everything else And that was good It was like a drug Whats everything else The world has just become so inhuman Everyones plugged in Blindingly inarticulate obsessed with money their careers stupidly arrogantly content cant talk to them fight them wanna destroy them even crave interaction crave it But you just cant anymore They pull their devices out for every little thing to reinforce their petty convenient notions To decide where they are going to shop what theyre gonna eat what movies they are gonna watch everything they ingest Why does that upset you Because what is left oh my God But that doesnt have to be you Okay Its like this is all a game and havent been told what the rules are Or even worse if had am illequipped to follow them All can do is provoke become spiteful m just as bad as they are They m m worse fucking hate myself for it m am so fucking lonely Why is the world so base Why is it so insensitive Why is it so selfish Why am am not for this world Fucking shit Youve been asleep a long time How long From when they say you come in last night hour Seriously It aint up to me But you could undo them couldnt you Extricate my ass And lose my job Where you going Other patient m just hungry like a motherfucker Were gonna get you food bring you water You got some crack can smoke m afraid not You know just a little bit Fire that shit up Motherfucker Motherfucker Fuck you Fuck you Fuck you Fuck you Fuck it We were just out of school living uptown We both had really lucrative job offers She was gonna maybe go to London Chose the Far East instead to be with me The next logical step was marriage and kids and we just did that kind of without even discussing it hypereducated young adults making the most significant decision in life without a single real conversation We talked about movies we saw more than the meaning of a future together remember being um what would the word be frozen when she was pregnant the first time thought oh you know something is definitely over And never stopped to enjoy it But you like having kids love having kids get home you know usually too late for dinner Shes into her third drink and have about an hour before the girls have to go to bed and go into their rooms with a plate and dont leave Most of our interactions these days consist of algebra and whatever selfconsciously multicultural book theyre reading at the time As they get older they get quieter The older one Allie shes uh shes getting belligerent Mmm Your wife drinks cause youre not really there Yeah thats obviously part of that Not exactly the raucous time we were thinking of huh Honest Thats ironic Mmm dont wanna go home yet You have to Sam Just one more day Shes not expecting me yet One more day Are there friends you can speak to Your father Your brother Hal isnt it What is this with me needing to talk to anyone Just to know others are concerned and care about you And you believe that That people care about each other We treat people the way we want to be treated Its just a compassion dont consider myself compassionate have no respect for my father because he is bossed around by my mother Now not only hate her but resent her because its interfering with my life All of this is natural And pretty fucked up too Youre young You dont want your life

Sambuca Discovered the good stuff a lot later And your friend Now he a fancy nigger lawyer who dont answer my calls Maybe him busy with him life Oh yeah You cant see you in charge of yourself you cant do nothin Do you think dont know that So why you here in a bed got straps But then what do all these thinkers weve examined this semester have in common If we truly explore to find a common thread At the outset of a century that would constitute the bloodiest in human history Along with scientific and technological advancements that would literally make us like Gods Even as we began to dismantle the very meaning of God They ask what is a life Does to live any longer have a how Does it any longer have a why Against a backdrop of industrialization people will contend with alienation dislocation population on a mass scale and murder on a mass scale Theyll consider the constraints of truth Whether metaphor or paradigm with many concluding actual truth has never existed nexus in the great human saga when we dared to trade the organizing bliss of good and evil right and wrong as determined by a creator for other opiates Communism socialism capitalism psychology technology any learnable system to replace what had begun to evaporate The th century My own But also the one into which each of you was born For many an era of hope liberation possibility For others of abandonment and despair most human century in which we begin really to understand that Nietzsche was right We are beautifully finally achingly alone In this void philosophy at its worst becomes selfreflective linguistic semantic relativism having rendered any discussion of right and wrong good and evil to be the quaint concerns of another age At its most provocative it asks other questions Those concerned with locating our stranded selves when meaning seems to have died Hes expecting your call So you gonna sign me out or what Nothing less in short then why do we live at all Call him Go there And what makes us who we are They ask what now And were still asking it What will fortify us as another century your century commences Do we abandon finally the search for truths that seem ever more elusive even silly to some The ethical The moral The good Principles that by definition can never be proved when so much now can be proved Or is all this finally and forever pointless Are we done We can destroy cities alter the planet irreversibly speak instantaneously facetoface from across the globe Create life where there was to be none even while intoxicating ourselves with it all And yet how do we still seek purpose And where do we hope to find it if were so busy convincing ourselves there neednt be any And so we wander eyes closed to the dark while technology science medicine and godlessness blaze illusions around us With less to guide us now than ever Seemingly omnipotent but more human and just as afraid These quandaries do not end with this course in a week from today They begin And certainly havent taught these writers for years just so you can drop references to existential thinkers and their antecedents at dinner parties The crowd is untruth In an era darkened by the false shade of imperviousness you and those who pause to question carry the light Its been a wonderful years Lets not be strangers Either to one another or more importantly to everything weve learned from one another May your best years be yet to come And so for us all Thank you thank you thank you Hey what are you doing Thats my purse Hes taking my purse Motherfucker So heard you gave quite the final lecture in the survey
