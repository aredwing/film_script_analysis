good love you Hi baby You having fun on your birthday Izzy Hey Sylvie hey let me call you back m What They tell you anything Just to wait here until were called Theyre treating him like hes some kind of major criminal John All right well straighten it out Is he under my last name or yours You know he changed it to mine Why are you even asking Hi my son Jason Collins is Take a seat and wait to be called Can you at least tell me where he is Have you noticed anything different Like what With him who hes been hanging with anything out of the ordinary No John havent noticed anything This is such bullshit mean he is a good kid Mikes sending a lawyer Good you can afford it Didnt you quit Mr and Mrs Matthews Yeah thanks for coming Wheres Jason Theyre moving him from his holding cell to a courtroom Hes scheduled to be arraigned this evening That could take a little while Thats all right leave him in jail for a little bit scare the hell out of him No ones trying to scare your son This is a federal case The amount of or Ecstasy they found means theyve charged Jason with distribution of narcotics Jason said that a friend asked to have the drugs sent to the house What friend friend by the name of Craig Johnson Thats his best friend Christ have known Craig since he was little Mr Johnson was arrested trying to mail the pills and he agreed to work with the government What do you mean Agreed to work with the government Both Craig and Jason are being charged under federal mandatory minimum sentencing laws These laws were designed to ensnare highlevel drug traffickers to get them to snitch on other traffickers in order to reduce their own sentence However most of the convictions over half have been firsttime offenders like your son So Craig is implicating Jason Yes In order to reduce his sentence Craig told the that Jason agreed to have the pills sent to the house and also has agreed to help sell them What Now Jason has denied both of these accusations Do you believe him Of course believe him He would never be involved in anything like this Are we talking about probation here or could he actually go to jail for this The mandatory minimum laws are very simple The amount of jail time depends upon the amount of drugs There are no mitigating factors What does that mean Jason is facing a mandatory minimum sentence of years in prison Ten years Are you out of your mind He just got accepted to college John tell him Oh God Jason United States v Jason Collins How could they deny him bail Hes never even been arrested before You want to know the truth knew something like this was gonna happen figured if just got him off to college but no Jason has no goddamn idea what real responsibility means Especially with Sylvie babying him all the time And when your own son doesnt want to have anything to do with you anymore Thats not true Thats not true Thats not true at all Its just really hard for kids who go through divorces It was acted out when my father left Yeah well hes not a kid anymore Not while hes sitting in that cell Are the sprinklers on Does everything have to go to shit Heres the situation Its very simple You help them make trafficking arrests and they will reduce your sentence from years to two One suspended told you dont know anyone else Just Craig Bullshit Your mom told me she smelled marijuana on you before Whered you get that from huh Jason this is serious Come on honey you gotta tell us who sold you the pot didnt didnt have to buy it Amandas dad grows it He has a medicinal license Its legal We just took some just wanted to try it Okay are there any of your friends who do drugs who might be interested in selling What like setting someone up Like Craig did to me No way No way You better wake up You better wake up right now cause this is really happening Youre gonna take that plea and youre gonna help them make the arrest You hear me ll take my chances in court No you wont No you wont You do not work with the prosecutors and they can raise the minimum limit to years Which means youll be out in time for your th birthday And they are batting over on convictions Oh God Jason baby please listen to him We dont have another choice m not setting anyone up Baby please m not doing it wont do it Yes you are Listen to me damn it You think you know what youre doing You have no idea until you spend the next years of your life in prison m not gonna let that happen to you son You hear me Youre not the one whod have to do it Morning John hey need to show you something This is Well theyre beauts aint they They said the other two will be ready next month Yeah theyre great gotta make a call Terry John Matthews Good No we definitely gotta get out Well hit a few Very soon Hey let me ask you something Do you have a connection to Joanne Keeghan The Attorney downtown Go ahead and have a seat Mr Matthews You have a lot of friends in this city received four phone calls in the matter of an hour m sure youd do the same for your kids dont have any children All right well lets see Eighteen years old Well you must have had him when you were quite young Sophomore in college Me and his mom were high school sweethearts Well you have my sympathies But believe in the mandatory minimum laws Were fighting a war right now not just on drugs but on the violence they bring And we are losing badly so its time for all our sakes we have to turn this around Miss Keeghan agree do But my son Jason hes not a drug dealer Hes a good kid and he just made a really dumb naive mistake And hes willing to do anything he can to help out his situation But the only drug dealer that he knows is Craig Johnson who you already have in custody Well m really sorry to hear that Please theres gotta be something can do Well now the laws are designed to preclude any special circumstances so its really quite simple We need your son to help us make arrests before we can help him reduce his sentence If he cant do that or isnt willing to do that then theres really nothing we can do m sorry And now have to be somewhere else What if did it for him What What if helped you make arrests Its not the way it works Please just want to help my son understand And really am sorry but my hands are tied Theres nothing can do Thank you for stopping by How you doing Hi Who are you here to see Jason Collins Okay Just sign in Proceed to booth Thank you

talk about this No goddamn it tell me now What is happening Is my sister in danger Mommy Where are we love you John do They knew my wife and kids name damn it What if they know about Jason They dont How the hell do you know that Because from the moment we started this operation we logged you separately into What is Its a Fed database Anyone who logs into your case file runs your name or Jasons they notify me They ran your name yesterday at noon Thats why they know about Analisa and Isabelle And not Jason No because hes listed under his mothers maiden name and you dont have the same address Hes safe Whod you meet with Malik called him El Topo Who is he Hes Juan Carlos Pintera They call him The Mole El Topo Hes ex Mexican paramilitary and he runs this region for the Nuevo Len cartel Thats who he is Getting Pintera would seriously cripple their organization What did he say about the run Just that there was another pickup And gotta take it into Mexico What into Mexico Why Because that means youre running their money this time You see John one of the ways that were fighting the cartel is to stop them getting their profits Right now its virtually impossible for them to wire money in so they have to physically transport it Hundreds of millions of dollars This could be an incredible opportunity for us Especially if we got Pintera too Can talk to you for a minute Yeah sure John would you excuse us for a second d appreciate it Thanks What You know damn well what El Topos a game changer and hes way out of his depth Are you kidding me We can still bring in Malik No no no We can squeeze him for a third strike We get Theres no way El Topos gonna be at that exchange tomorrow am not missing this opportunity Even if we dont get him you know the way this works You follow the drugs you get players You follow the money Yeah You get a kingpin Yeah you know that if he crosses that border hes never coming back You good with that John Sit down Drink No Coffee No Look we had a deal deliver Malik to you you reduce my sons sentence to a year m really sorry but we are way past Malik now If we pick him up were going to tip off the cartel And what if go to a judge You can if you want to but with the mandatory minimum laws a judge has no say to reduce the sentence Only the federal prosecutor does And thats me Look this is the last stop Youve been very patient give you my word Your son is coming home soon Immediately Excuse me go through with this Jason comes home that instant Then ll make sure that every parent out there knows how compassionate youve been to my son Okay You complete this and will have the judge release your son But need the money and the arrest of a cartel player Nothing less Hey John What time are they calling you with the pickup address tomorrow morning The reason they pick Sunday its a high traffic day at the border Less inspections You dont think this is a good idea do you Hey man dont matter what think You made a deal with the dragon lady Not me John you gotta know theres a reason they picked you so quick for this run Cartels dont use their own people to carry loads They recruit Guys like you Favorite target is a middleclass kid in a school Make it sound all exciting to carry a backpack full of dope for pockets full of cash And then they do it These guys threaten to kill their families They use them they abuse them They end up in a barrel full of acid Thats it theyre gone Done Easy come easy go Because theres always gonna be another mule to take their place Brother you gotta know this is one serious backpack youre about to
