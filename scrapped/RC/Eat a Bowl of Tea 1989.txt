Havent been too lucky huh Seventyfive Years back the Chinese came to America leaving their women behind They thought they were going to get rich And theyd go back to China and be big shots But it seldom worked out that way Then the Exclusion laws came down on them They were treated differently from the rest of the immigrants For years the Chinese couldnt become citizens and no Chinese woman could come to America Not even a wife Not even a daughter Chinatown was dying The men just kept getting older Their sons couldnt find women to marry And there were no families Well the second world war changed all that China became Americas ally Congress passed new laws The oldtimers could become citizens just like everybody else And the boys who fought in the Armed Forces could go back to China take a bride and bring her to America So one day we were dying off and the next thing you know everybodys talking about arranging marriages for their kids and how many grandchildren they were going to
