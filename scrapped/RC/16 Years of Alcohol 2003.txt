wing We had dreams and songs to sing cowboy go get your mother Come on Mum Dad wants to go Hurry up have always had a strange feeling about love It seemed tricky Happiness and sadness ugly and beautiful real and unreal One thing ve always known though is that have wanted to be around love Quietly not too much Just enough to make my heart happy It didnt have to sing just smile a little smile

a man say no Just when you thought it was in your grasp you find yourself back where you started Nothing is ever as easy as people would have you think Nothing Vodka vodka vodka Where is love when you

to the jungle Fuck off Maybe could stand in for you take your place keep her bed warm said fuck off Miller Maybe should take the boys to hers for some fun She looks the type whod like that Shes educated isnt she It makes sense why have one when she can three The world is silent The clocks have stopped again can see the ship that sailed has sunk to the bottom of the sea burn My heart beats the tune that this is not a fantasy this is real This is when you become dizzy with hate Hi everybody Welcome few familiar faces here and weve a new member welcome ll explain the process Anybody that wants to speak gets a chance m off first today m Jennifer and m an alcoholic Er its been quite a good week actually actually went swimming me swimming Felt really good about that Wednesday was hard Day off was going to do all these things do this see friends never did it got caught up watching the telly in the morning Was Kilroy hes enough to make anybody greet him watched it and there was this guy talking about his life just started to cry couldnt stop uncontrollable wanted a drink God did want a drink all day But didnt heId on got to Thursday got back to work got back to normality Now m here got through the week My name is Frankie and am a violent man woke up one morning It was winter could see an oak tree standing right next to me It was cold At first couldnt feel anything and then realised that my face was frozen to the ground couldnt lift it It was stuck was lying on the ground Beneath a tree Frozen to the ground dont know how long had been there but long enough to freeze me Something bad had happened Something violent My hands were free and they were red Blood red Strangely enough my thoughts were clear Very clear could almost hear them racing around in my head They told me was a dead person Dead Dead No longer living Lifeless remembered everything Everything from the past The past was there in front of me As the sun came up the ice thawed and my face was released For a while didnt want to get up just lay there listening to my thoughts about the past This is where the world spins in the wrong direction where it ends The realisation that everything that you ever wanted will never happen Gone like the wind Gone forever fucking years of nothing Gone Think of all the love you gave people who never understood that what you did was only for them and all you ever wanted back was something small Hope Not charity You wanted them to make hope beautiful again Hey how you doing Weathers shocking Yeah Terrible weather How are you doing Cant complain Whats a man got to do to get a drink in here Whats the rush Will you join me Its turning cold Think itll snow After a while got up and think for the first time ever understood something that had real meaning You cant escape from what you are You can only try and make you a better person m trying thats all m doing trying to be better trying not to give up guess what m trying to say is sometimes things dont work out Like you might have hoped and its up to you to get on with it Even though you feel hope is tired and suddenly it isnt available any more Christ listen to me going on Sorry Can end with an odd and hopefully funny thought Things got so desperate that ended up going somewhere just for a little while where they encourage you to be to be someone else went to acting classes Happiness Now that ve found peace at last Tell me Jesus Will it last Now that ve found peace at last Tell me Jesus Will it last Birds are laughing in the trees Its only make believe Its only love Its only love You Whats

all the games all the shit all the fun that theyve had at each others expense all comes to light So take a moment and well give it a go Ready Frankie So were in a bar in the quiet part of the city Its the kind of bar where sad people go and drink and stare into space Smoke is hanging in the air People talk in whispers Alright Mary in your own time Men watch me know see them like it Look at the sad bastards watching wanting thinking What is she wearing under that dress bet shes wearing nothing at all Frankie Sorry Sorry was listening and thinking That it was your line No was thinking How odd it

best You walk in late as usual and what do you bring to the table Your fucking baggage Dont you think its about time you stopped wallowing in your own story in your own selfpitying bullshit m sorry

shall we try again Right Danger past The feeling that something has gone Something that was part of you Something that you needed It protected you The violence that you wore like a cloak of honour The feeling that you could protect your world with fists has gone Its pouring out of you Running away fast fast faster Youre of no use to it any more Maybe maybe now you can fly with the gods Happiness Happiness Happiness Happiness Happiness wanted more wanted more Happiness Live with less Happiness Happiness Happiness Happiness Now that ve found peace at last Tell me Jesus Will it last Now that ve

Are you ready Frankie Maybe you should just go Fuck you Fuck all of you Watch your back Frankie you never know what might be behind you everyone came here with someone who thought that it was the palace of the gods There are no gods in this city Frankie Just us love how you can do that Exclude the world at will What else do you love about me In all our time together youve never said that Said what That you loved me love you love you That easy its that easy for some When will you tell him About me Me and you Us Together Forever When He will be coming soon Coming here to see me To see me and for me to tell him its over Say it again Its over Over and Over Us Together Forever Its over know what they are doing Saying In their head What it means tonight Tonight is a bad night Where are the

Dont panic can see her changing Dont panic Dont awake me Keep dreaming Keep dreaming Hes here The fool He came He came The fool The fool He came came came to tell you To tell me To tell her that love

say that Fortune grieves him While the star of hope She leaves him Me nae cheerful twinkle lights me Me You Dark despair around benights me Forever and ever ll never blame my partial fancy Naething could resist my Nancy But to see her was to love her Love but her and love for ever Had we never lovd sae kindly Had we never Lovd sae blindly Sometimes the city takes your heart and moulds it into something you dont recognise Something lost The lost heart In the city of hope Where nothing belongs to you Frankie Frankie will you talk to me please Hello Mary Can you not even look at me Whats happened Frankie One minute were fine were happy even the next minute youre gone Gone Yes youre gone No one can believe it They thought you got lost again we were all worried about you Frankie will you look at me please Are you alright Did you Whats happened Happened Frankie dont know what to do Help me out here m not cant go on like this m not strong enough to To fool me To fool you What are you talking about To fool you What do you mean Maybe m the fool Maybe m the fool keep running after you keep trying Dont do this Frankie Dont do this to me ve been through a lot with you ve waited ve waited for you to want me more than a friend or a lover or ve waited for you to love me Do you know how that feels No Because all that mattered was you We made a mistake Mary No we didnt make a mistake We had a chance took it You dont want it You dont want it At least tell me why Why you dont want it Why you dont want me If everything that youd ever ruined fell from the sky at this moment then the world would be covered in darkness Is this what you really wanted Is this the dream Do you have it now The shape of yourjourney at last you can see it Maybe its time to start the clocks ticking again Look time in the face Look at time in the face and forget about the past Stop the past leaking into your heart Forget just stop the past leaking into your heart But then Sometimes for some people things dont work out as they might have hoped Hope is a strange thing a currency for people who know theyre losing The more familiar you are with hope the less beautiful it becomes Dream
