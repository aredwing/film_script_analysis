house Lets go All right all right But m warning you its messy Excuse me Hi Workin hard as usual Jocelyn Well not as usual And what are you doin here Got a problem with your insurance No m here tryin to figure something out What are you tryin to figure out Well busted this kid name of Dodge for hackin into a telephone companys computer system Theyve also listed a bunch of other companies and different offences He used the phone companys computer to get into other companies systems Thats what figured But these people here Brigantine International they didnt list any offences nor did they press charges Let me check on Centrals computer That would be wonderful Someone else accessed this information today Who was that Savannah Detective Agency According to this theyre a holding company for corporations with offshore accounts in Europe and South America Can you figure out on that thing who owns Brigantine International The primary stockholder is a Frank Mantajano Mantahano Whatever Beautiful vessel isnt she Would you like a drink No dont drink Tobacco want to congratulate you on your Chinese cooking enjoy my work We want to commission you to do another job We want you to locate Luke Dodge a convict that escaped from a Georgia prison today We need to find him before Monday He has a computer disk that belongs to us All of our accounting information is on that disk We want you

aint makin any friends mouthin off Well m not tryin to make any friends m tryin to do my job Oh yeah What job might that be Say where are you goin Let me talk to you for a second Why do you think the Attorney General and a marshal are involved in this Theyre following orders from superiors which you cant seem to do Would you listen for a sec Warden Nichols said the Attorney General had Dodge placed on that road crew Plus Dodge hacked into Brigantine Internationals computer system Why dont we have a record of it Because the key stockholder is a Frank Mantajano who is currently under indictment by the Attorney General So So whatever Dodge discovered inside their computer system they wanna keep it secret Great police work Maybe can get you assigned to the Hoffa case next Henry Are you outta your fuckin mind Blanks Found em on the road where Dodge escaped Police issue Its all right Its Listen dont have all the pieces to the puzzle yet but just think about it Dodge makes off with million of Mantajanos money and the corporation doesnt press charges This is evidence Did you tell Schiller My guess is he knows He had Dodge put on that road so hed run But things went sour People died So Schiller wants this out of the press What the hell does that prove What it proves right is that Dodge has something big on Mantajano and the Attorney General wants it bad Now have got a hunch and need an old friend to turn his back for hours so can play it out you got hours Not a minute more And Matthew you fuck this up friend or no friend its your ass know Henry Believe me know So whered
