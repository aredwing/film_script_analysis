It is not the challenge of dollars it is the challenge of ideals and ideas If the producers of pictures see only the dollar then believe those production efforts will fail This is Harry Warner With three of his brothers he founded and ran Warner Bros for over years They did this with no education a huge amount of chutzpah and the belief as long as they were told they couldnt do something they knew they were on the right track To me Harry Warner was just Grandpa the guy who loved nothing more than riding me around on the tractor at his ranch Grandpa passed away when was following a long struggle within the family business The last time saw him he was bedridden in an antisepticsmelling room His eyes moved to take me in He smiled as his hand took mine He tried to speak but no words came His grip tightened Something special was being entrusted to me squeezed back promise was made It wasnt until years later that would realize the magnitude and meaning of that moment As a kid often went to the studio lot As long as the red light wasnt flashing could go into any sound stage and watch the magic happening Cut it Lets move in on a close shot here It was better than going to the circus It was a place of wonder a kingdom and a factory of dreams and creativity being fashioned by my grandfather and his brothers Today the family business has been reincarnated into another body corporation thats part of an even bigger corporation thats part of an even bigger corporation In other words a conglomerate So does anyone even know who the original Warner brothers were Can people possibly imagine that this huge company was once run by an actual family People with a story a past a passion and a purpose decided to find out When say Warner Bros What comes to mind Bugs Bunny like Bugs Bunny Cartoons Do you think there were actual brothers or that Warner Bros is just a brand name dont know dont know dont know m sorry have no clue Why do care think its just a brand name Its just a brand name If there were brothers what do you think their names were wanna say Anthony ll go with Mike and Charlie because got no idea Homer Oscar and Stanley Diego dont know Time Warner And Time Warner would think When say the name Warner Bros whats the first thing that comes to mind Jack Warner If one does remember the brothers they remember Jack He was the last man standing He rewrote history and pretty much left the other brothers out The truth is they were a phenomenal team that built an empire on a dream and revolutionized Hollywood while making the most classic relevant movies of their time reserved a table Victor Laszlo Yes Mr Laszlo right this way Warner Bros had a definite stamp to their films Thatll learn you to sit up and hold onto this The lean hard look of Warner Bros Its gritty and its tough They were interested in issues of prejudice of ethnicity Your moneys no good here Come on lets go You too Hold on a minute Warner Bros by far was known in Hollywood as a studio with a social conscience Warner Bros had a motto to educate entertain and enlighten If there was a champion for a patriotic way of life it was Warner Bros Warner Bros was America You could not have a Harry and Jack Warner saying The hell with my profits There are some things more important than profit think any studio chief who said that today would be looking for another job tomorrow Four brothers born into a family of children Out of the moviemaking four Harry the eldest was born in Albert followed three years later then came Sam who was seven years younger and last but not least kid brother Jack who was years Harrys junior born in Our family entered this country from Russia now Poland ve been searching for over years to find out what our real surname is GreatGrandpa Benjamin wanted to leave the past behind There was too much pain connected to it ve been told Theres one thing for certain It definitely wasnt Warner The reason my father came here was because he could not educate his children number one and number two to work for a living because the right to work did not exist over there First of all they were mostly uneducated Jews and when they came to this country the educated Jews which was the Russian The German Jews wanted nothing to do with them So they had to find something They got into the clothing business the rag business they got into anything they could get into which you could without an education We couldnt go to school so we started working because we had to earn a living So sold papers and shined shoes on the corner of Light and Baltimore Street We had to stay out pretty late at night because if we didnt bring home we didnt eat much And think that was the greatest lesson of my life learned how to work and appreciate work And then one day they seized on an idea all about the same time They saw the future of what was a nickelodeon It was Sam and Harry put their nickels on a plate and sat through three shows back to back until the manager threw them out Watching others go in and out of the theater they looked at each other shook hands and said Were in the motionpicture business At the same time in another city Brother Albert had become a nickelodeon junkie When he arrived home he announced that he too wanted to be in the movie business Kismet fate call it what you like a decision was made Sam got wind of a secondhand kinetoscope projector invented by Thomas Edison that came with the film The Great Train Robbery the rave of the day The whole family excited about the potential of this new business piled their savings on the dining table Still short Father Benjamin pawned the family heirloom a gold watch as well as old Bob the horse who pulled his meatdelivery wagon Now they were in the motionpicture business To open up their first storefront theater the brothers hung a sheet on the wall and cut a deal to borrow chairs from the funeral parlor next door Sam ran the projector Albert fed the film through it Harry collected the nickels sister Rose played the organ and Jack sang or more accurately chased everyone out when the film was done was used as a chaser in the early days of the motion pictures movies nickelodeons They wanted to get rid of an audience theyd have someone like me come out and sing Are you ready Yes My greatgrandfather Benjamin Warner believed profoundly in the value of unity His constant advice to me was this Harry he would say You are the oldest of my sons and it is your responsibility to keep your brothers together As long as you stand together you will be strong He had been brought up from age to take care of and so he had a lot of responsibility all of his life and so thats the way he lived his life as a very responsible person Harry was born Hirsch and had the middle name of Morris named after his mothers brother Usually he was just Harry or sometimes Harry Warner took the business very seriously Was he a big jovial givingyouabearhug sort of a guy No Was he humorless No He was a quieter person Well you know everybody loved Harry you know Well they did mean he was just He was a gentle soul you know It wasnt that he wasnt tough and strong and like you know running the show but there was a gentleness about him that everybody appreciated He wasnt a fast talker he didnt tell stories He was just a straightshooting honest person and This is who am you know And you better be who you are And if you werent he didnt like it and hed let you know Albert was a very large man He had a large head huge hands He was impressive in his bulk would say that And he did not like to attract any attention to himself Hed sit at the dinner table and hardly say a word Always called everybody in his family a bunch of bums The philosophy of life that that would reveal is that hard work prevents you from being a bum Sam was described as the familys visionary the dreamer who loved anything mechanical and had the nerve or chutzpah to match Well Sam was a remarkable man He was a very rough character but he was a very colorful man He was extremely bright In the family he was a buffer between Harry and Jack If m trying to picture Jack Warner walking around the set he was a brisk walker Not really smiling but animated all the time He had this brush mustache which he dyed It was always brown and his hair was always slicked back and always dyed brown And finally understood that Nobody was gonna catch him being gray Very strong very direct very big desk You know just like youd cast the head of a studio for a movie you know The youngest brother Americanized his name Jacob or Yankel in Yiddish to Jack He added a middle name Leonard because he thought it sounded classy Jack Warner had a ring of formality or authority to it but he preferred the snap of just being called He was the frontman and he was the youngest right Well the youngest m the youngest m an actor put the light on me please because theyre getting all the attention all the time Hello He was definitely a man to notice When he walked in a room you knew someone of importance was walking into that room Every crisis was an incentive for the brothers to take their next step It became difficult to get a supply of films They formed The Duquesne Film Exchange acquiring films for themselves and for others to rent realizing distribution was more profitable than exhibition When one of the films arrived as a negative print Jack advertised it as the first picture made with all colored actors When it became nearly impossible to get new films Harry leased an abandoned foundry to start to produce their own films and Warner Features was born When Edison tried to control the East Coast market for tworeelers Sam and Jack joined the exodus to Hollywood with Harry and Albert to follow Even though times were tough they werent interested in selling their fledgling company World War broke out Sam and Jack got hired to make training films for the Army In their first film Open Your Eyes Jack played the part of a soldier who caught the clap Tired of working for others Sam bought the bestselling book written by the ambassador to Germany called My Four Years in Germany which told of the atrocities committed by the Kaisers troops Their gamble paid off It was the companys first politically conscious film and their first moneymaker Although others offered more money Harry convinced the author that Warner Bros was the biggest movie studio in Hollywood and would deliver the biggest box office The famous Hollywood backend deal was born With their profits they bought their first studio in Hollywood Each brother took on specific roles within the fledgling company Harry served as president the financial wizard and strategist Albert oversaw distribution and exhibitor relations Sam was the producer acquiring books ideas and new technologies while Jack oversaw the daytoday operations Those were the good old days Positively Thats his handwriting Is it Wow think so These are wonderful Thats right Yeah This one love This one is so touching Thats sweet yeah This one is Hal Wallis very young Hal Wallis Yes indeed Oh look This is your th birthday Society Cinema Mom You got in Society Cinema on your sixth birthday How about that Even when Grandpa took time off he was still making movies He produced a short about my moms th birthday in God everybody was having such a good time Thats my cousin Jackie who was very close to me as a friend Thats my mother and my sister And my dad Hes so cute Its funny to see him excited and having fun Yeah Yeah its so cute My sister Doris was eight years older than was And my brother was years older than was The truth is was unexpected Yeah was a surprise My mother and dad were married for over years which in those days was unusual in Hollywood He relied on her and he liked being with her and he felt reassured when she was with him Oh thats Jack and lrma Jacks first wife Thats Jack and Jackie Thats Jack and his second wife Ann Okay you know the rest People in the family disapproved of Jacks divorce and him marrying his mistress especially when there was a child involved One of my regrets was the friction between Harry and Jack But think it was mainly that my father resented authority of his older brother When Jack first started out he was a lightweight And it bothered Harry terribly that this younger brother was just not going anywhere and he was crazy about girls and parties and so he was not happy with him His idea was that his son Lewis would take over the studio and not Jack Sam Warner came to New York and saw me and met me And was He was In those days a man years old is old especially when youre It didnt take long for Sam to propose and marry Lina Mother was under the impression that Sam Warner was a bigshot movie man So she was very upset when she found out the truth that Sam wasnt such a bigshot They were struggling in those days the Warner brothers They had to sell Rin Tin Tin pictures to meet the payroll was earning more money as a salary from Ziegfeld Follies than he was getting from the company For years Edison and others had been looking unsuccessfully to add sound to pictures In Sam was introduced to a new system developed by Bell Labs and Western Electric which he thought could work It recorded sound on a inch record disc My brother phoned me that there s an apparatus should see and after seeing it then made up my mind that through this instrument talking pictures would be possible One example of Harry Warners willingness to take risks was his decision in to buy Vitaphone Harry gambled everything they had borrowed million which today would be million oftentimes paying for this money at percent interest There s a Yiddish expression tokhes afn tish put your ass on the table And they did that It was the music of the instrument that saw that attracted me mostly and beyond that was attracted by the screen being used as our future education because through the screen you could educate What was impossible to do with the silent picture was possible to perform by this instrument It was the general belief at that time that motion pictures had progressed as far as they could go as a medium of dramatic expression and satisfying entertainment My brothers and believed otherwise We were determined to break the barrier of silence and bring full life to the screen by giving it a voice To this goal we dedicated the full resources of Warner Bros There were setbacks and discouragements and a great deal of criticism from doubters who were annoyed with us for not letting well enough alone If you look at history of Hollywood theyve always been skeptical of any innovation and so that was the reason that most of the moguls wanted nothing to do with sound Its very difficult especially for large successful companies to change quickly and so any sort of introduction of new technology puts into question every business and profit model that they have in place and rehiring people and restructuring is a very scary risky thing Sam didnt see it as a risk but more as an opportunity He was determined to make the synchronization of sound on film a commercial success He named it Vitaphone the living voice Sam and Lina now had a child and she had gone back to Paramount as an actress and wanted Sam to bring his invention to a bigger more successful studio begged him begged him to sever his relationship with the company and go to Paramount At the last minute you know they got his mother and the father on the phone and they cried and the sisters and there were other brothers too you know And really never quite forgave him for turning down the Paramount deal The brothers made a historic decision to do a feature film Don Juan with the star John Barrymore The film had a track of swords clashing doors opening and the shattering of glass as well as using the best orchestra money could buy the New York Philharmonic which only the wealthy could afford to go to hear at the time The closest any actor came to making a sound was during the kisses Barrymore laid on his costars Don Juan created a lot of excitement but it had drained the coffers and bankers were turning a deaf ear to Harrys pleas for more loans Mama darling if m a success in this show We re gonna move from here Oh yes were gonna move up to the Bronx Lot of grass up there and lot of people you know Theres the Ginsbergs the Guttenburgs and the Goldbergs lot of Bergs The brothers gambled everything to hire the worlds greatest entertainer Al Jolson to star in The Jazz Singer and show the perfection of a synchronized voice moving exactly with the picture This was the scene that put sound on the map The whole film contained barely two minutes worth of synchronized talking Stop Jack Warner has always had the credit for The Jazz Singer Sam was the one who produced The Jazz Singer Wait a minute wait a minute you aint heard nothing yet Wait a minute tell you you aint heard nothing You wanna hear Toot Toot Tootsie All right hold on It was Sam who insisted that Al Jolsons famous line which was adlibbed be kept in the film He knew magic when he saw it Sam was popping aspirin like candy due to terrible headaches and sinus troubles t the end of filming when he showed an unsteadiness on his feet the doctors demanded that he go to the hospital for treatment The other brothers went to New York to get ready for the premiere on October th His condition worsened Harry and Albert grabbed two specialists and got on the first train they could to Los Angeles They arrived three hours too late as Sam had died of a cerebral hemorrhage Regarding Sams death Jack said The Jolson debut was an empty victory for us Theres no doubt that The Jazz Singer killed him Something wonderful went out of our lives Quiet Albert was moved to give a rare statement to the press The three of us who are left will carry on and believe we will always accomplish more work in one day than any other trio of men will in three not because were smarter but because we trust each other implicitly was doing a film at Paramount when he died All of a sudden m a widow at with an months old child and probably was very foolish was young and rebellious My mother was young and she was a different religion and Harry Warner was very conservative you know that and didnt dont think really much liked actors and actresses and people like that They just never never let up on me particularly Harry Warner After Sams death Harry and wife Rea petitioned the court to adopt Lita Lina was awarded and Lita was raised by Harry and Rea as one of their own really look back and love them and they took great care of me and had a probably much better life than would have had They werent wrong give them a lot of credit dont think would in my s would have wanted to take on a little child another child So Harry Warner think one of his beautiful things about him is he wanted to take care of the whole family Many a time walk out of the theater with tears in my eyes because when you find the dream realized and you know that no dream such as mammoth as that one was to undertake was done easy Today to have all of you enjoy that which even life was given for Opening night of The Jazz Singer at Graumans Chinese Irving Thalberg came out of the theater he turned to my father and said This thing wont last its a one shot Really Yes They were stuck with a lot of pictures that did not have sound on them and if this idea worked they were all in trouble The Jazz Singer was the thing that inspired Steamboat Willie the first Mickey Mouse cartoon The Jazz Singer came out and Walt goes Gotta have sound Started a whole new in secret Now the studio at the time was like five people And in secret from the other four he had an animator start up this talkie and it became this worldwide phenomenon but it was because of the success of The Jazz Singer that that all happened And we were into the era of sound The Warner Bros What else did they do They didnt have to do anything else Think what a thing it was to bring sound to movies And it will take them from povertyrow status to firsttier studio status The Jazz Singer remained the biggest moneymaker in Hollywood history until Gone With the Wind The brothers had made it to the top The next challenge was how to get theaters wired for sound They bought First National which had the largest theater chain in the country and a sprawling lot in Burbank Then they went on and they made the great pictures of the s and s Great stars and all that Nobody had a crystal ball saying The Depression is coming But Harry was smart enough had enough business savvy to say its not really the smartest thing to have all of our eggs in one basket And so he diversified the company in the late s so that they got into publishing and they got into music Leading this new division was a Warner brother of the next generation Harrys only son Lewis Thats Lewis and my dad And Arthur Thats Arthur And whos the pretty girl dont know but guarantee it was with Lewis and not Arthur Lewis was always a bit of a devilish character And my father And my father Yes he was was very shy very shy Gorgeous Okay Yeah he was a leader and a half that guy Lewis was Oh yeah But not always in the right proper direction Well that depends If you like girls it was the perfect direction Thats what he was known for The house was always like a party and he played music a lot And yeah he was a fun person He was great to be with He was marvelous to me He treated me you know extremely lovingly He was in New York at the New York office and he was helping with that He was also producing plays on Broadway He was a very attractive young man and very bright and wonderful personality He had two girlfriends and he decided that he and one of his girlfriends would go down to Cuba for a vacation While he was down there his wisdom tooth which was impacted bothered him and he had to come back By the time he got back it was infected so they put him in the hospital and two weeks later he was gone Years later Grandpa is quoted as saying The one thing wanted in this world was to have a son but God took him away when he was years old and was He had a tooth pulled If it had happened today penicillin would have saved him but God took him Probably the biggest tragedy in my dads life was that my brother died before both their dreams could be fulfilled No music was allowed in the house as Rea mourned for three years Harry tried to bury his grief by working even harder as the Depression was well underway When we think about the history of Hollywood if you ask somebody Whats the purpose of Hollywood most people would jump To entertain me Let us entertain you Take me away from my worries Harry Warner certainly was committed to education and a lot of that think he got from his father His father said to him If you wanna go into films then take that tool and make it a tool for social good think that film is the most powerful means of communication that there is actually think that it does affect the way you think or feel and it can effect social legislation And because of that think that We filmmakers have a powerful social responsibility And think you always must entertain but you have to be aware of the messages that youre sending and think you have to act responsibly Take a look at that The skunk Youre next Take his stinking shirt off Warner Bros Iooked at some of the harsher realities of the United States and thats another think sort of courageous move on Warner Bros part in that they looked at the prison system they looked at sort of the underside of America All right let him out Come on Public outcry resulting from this film forced prison reforms throughout the United States It is true that Warner Bros was sued by the Ku Klux Klan Soldiers of the Black Legion you see before you an instrument of death We give you this In the film Black Legion they wore uniforms that looked very much like the uniforms of the Klan And the Klan believed that the film was being made to disparage them They sued Warner Bros and they lost Criminal disregard of germs and their power to invade the bloodstream is causing a death rate in childbirth alone of three out of every mothers or in the city of Paris over innocent and helpless women annually They were really trying to enlighten people and trying to educate people It wasnt just entertaining They did And they did a great job of it too Because most of the things that learned as a kid and think most of Americans was what we learned from the movies in those days Really was Hey Tom Wait a minute What happened Nothing just got burned up thats all What do you Wanna run out on me for Were together aint We Sure You know in connection With that Whole idea of the criminal element or the loner or the antisocial person being the hero of the film to a certain extent theres been that kind of continuity of attention being paid to that kind of hero at Warners They brawled their way through life and its one thing and another and thats what those characters in those movies did Jimmy Cagney the ultimate brawler Now boys boys dont let all that smooth talk fool you Farrell and the rest of that gang of leeches up at headquarters are supposed to be working for us We sweat blood to give them their fat salaries their fancy offices and highpriced cars to ride around in You bet Thats right There was a time when there were more films of social relevance and they came out of the studio system And today ve come to believe actually that the marketing of a movie is more important than the movie And that is to me a very very sad thing And perhaps that explains Why there are less films of social relevance because theyre harder to market It wasnt only message films that my grandfather liked to make Producer Leon Schlesinger tickled the brothers fancy and Merrie Melodies began in exhibiting their scene of humor and spirit of play remember Bugs Bunny can quote Words from Bugs Bunny can quote the little character in That was looking out to kill a rabbit Elmer Fudd Fudd yeah thats the guy And he goes up to this big rabbit and he looks at him and he says Say What is What is a rabbit So Fudd says Well a rabbit has big ears And then the rabbit says Like this Fudd says And a rabbit has a little tail And the rabbit says Like this And then Fudd says Hey youre a rabbit am a rabbit The Warner Bros cartoons with a figure like Bugs Bunny a kind of a cynical ironic figure makes a connection to the audience there Looks at the audience What am doing Bugs looks at the audience a lot more than Mickey ever does Now another thing those cartoons do that always intrigued me is how often they bring the movies themselves into the cartoons Say pardon me but could you help out a fellow American whos down on his luck Hit the road was fascinated by GreatUncle Jack who had all the cockiness of Bugs Bunny We only met a few times as he was rarely present at family gatherings and in fact his name was said only in hushed tones If you could think of Jack Nicholson as The Joker that would be sort of Jack Warner Oh think Jack Warner was a big ham and he had the smell of show business Well you know he told jokes all the time Even They Were terrible And he then would repeat them When he didnt think people got the point of them Hed trap you oneonone where you made eye contact and you couldnt escape He knew he was Jack Warner and hed start his oneliners on you And of course m hahahaing and he knows it Hes not a stupid guy And hes rattling off nine or and m laughing and anybody else who he trapped was laughing He always liked Jewish humor Yiddish humor you might say vaudeville humor like just as much corny Yiddish vaudeville shtick Yeah always say the khe You know youre mishpokhe And you know that means Mishpokhe means your family The khe If you can say khe right Over the years Jack became known for things hed say in public that could hardly be believed can only imagine Albert Einsteins reaction when Jack told him Hey bub ve got a theory of relativity too Dont hire them And who can forget Jacks historic meeting with Madame Chiang Kaishek How could be so dumb forgot my laundry ticket No tickie no laundry right When the lights went up after Warren Beatty showed Jack the first cut of Bonnie and Clyde So Jack what did you think always know when a pictures too long Really How Depends on how many times get up to take a leak One piss fine Two piss trouble But goddamn it kid you made a threepiss picture dont think Harry or Albert played parts think they were simply your Jewish uncle that is very familiar But Jack was And thats how he did it It wouldnt be fun for me to play that part Thats a tough Thats a tough part to keep playing And so many people think youre a jerk you know because youre out there doing that But the great thing was he didnt care He didnt have to care and he could go to Monte Carlo he could do can do anything want Thats the kind of attitude that he brought to it dont care What you think m me and fuck you And he did that with a kind of aggression too so that you stood back It was clear that that Jack was more interested in publicity more interested in playing the media game more interested in the machinations of Hollywood But Harry was clearly doing it for moral reasons These poor devils have all had their homes burned their families beaten and starved to death by your taxgatherers Bless you Robin well never forget you Our humble thanks master May we be worthy Robin You are Mother you are Have you eaten Well friend Yes thank you Robin m sorry to have to show you that but once these poor people Were all happy and contented just simple villagers who never harmed a soul Grandpa often read the newspaper as he took pride in being aware of local and world news His associate told me that he would often come across a story about somebody being persecuted or experiencing some personal difficulty Hed send someone to collect more information so if he could he would anonymously help them out with a couple months rent or a job came back from lunch one day and had all this money on my desk went in to Sylvia and said Somebodys left a lot of money on my desk Do you know who it belongs to And she says Its yours said Mine How did get it It was about dollars Well that was like a weeks salary in those days And she said Mr Warner bet his horse Honeys Alibi on all of us across the board and it won That was pretty nice In Los Angeles the Medical Achievement Award goes to Harry Warner president of Warner Bros Apparently others noticed his generosity as he was given the title of the man who brought charity to Hollywood m grateful to our great country for having given me the opportunity that enabled me to do whatever have been able to do for my fellow man for which seek no honors He was on his way to Germany to open up the exchanges and as a side trip we went to Belgium to the Aragon and in through the forests where a lot of the First World War had been waged And he took us down in the trenches and told us the stories you know of the people in trenches being feet apart and shooting at each other all day and then at night exchanging cigarettes and talking to each other mean that kind of antiwar premise was spoken You know war was stupid and hell and unnecessary In Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany One of his first acts was to order a boycott of Jewishowned businesses Harry is convinced that he cannot do business With Germany as long as Hitler is in power This is the first studio in Hollywood to stop doing business with Nazi Germany and other people thought he was crazy People you know Louis Mayer says We cant live without the German box office didnt realize how lucrative a market Germany was and Europe was in the s but found out that about half the gross was made outside of the United States So it was a very big deal for someone to actually pull out of Germany in years before any of the other studios decided to pull out So think thats putting your money where your mouth is Ultimately to make some socially responsible decisions you must be willing to give up some level of profit some level of squeezing every last nickel out Its not just the Hollywood industry that is selling its product overseas but Americans across the board are doing business with Nazi Germany You know the International Business Machine for example Working With Nazi Germany In fact they develop the device to catalog the folks who will go to the prison camps Warner Bros wanted to make a film called Concentration Camp This was based on reporting that had been coming in about the concentration camps Dachau opened in March of mean people forget that the camps started that early Harry Warner ordered folks in the studio to start collecting stories You know start going through newspapers Theyre going to focus on the horrors of the camps mean they cant be as graphic as they could be today but about people losing their civil liberties being rounded up you know put into these camps for forced labor So the Production Code says No you cant do that They say If you try to go through with this film Well contact the State Department Its a funny thing to me that if Warner Bros knows theres concentration camps in the mids then other people know And so it was a real attempt at making a very hardhitting film that they didnt get to make The Production Code Authority was putting a lot of pressure on Warner Bros Warner Bros was pushing the envelope more than the other studios were not to offend foreign governments not to offend pressure and interest groups Blocked by the Production Code Grandpa found other ways to convey messages throughout the s Porfirio What does it mean this Word Democracy Why it means liberty Liberty for a man to say what he thinks to worship as he believes It means equal opportunity There was also a strong virulent element of antiSemitism There were a number of posters and pamphlets and That were leafleted around that were saying these were Jewish studios and how dare they speak up as a minority when in fact that was again one of these American values and American principles that Warner Bros knew so well Harry Warner himself took the word Jew out of The Life of Emile Zola It was not there in the dialogue He said it should not be there in the dialogue Its there Its Written At one point somebody points to the list of the members of the general staff and it says Dreyfus Religion Jew He says How did this person ever get on the general staff there So its clear whats going on But its not there in the dialogue Now hes been criticized The film has been criticized for this It wasnt up front enough It didnt say it To me think its a different kind of thing Because in fact by taking out the explicitness in that way it makes the idea of prejudice a lot more general You will not say like many What does it matter if an innocent man is undergoing torture on Devils Island Is the suffering of one obscure person worth the disturbance of a great country Not only is an innocent man crying out for justice but more much more great nation is in desperate danger of forfeiting her honor You had an industry that was run by Jews censored by Catholics and an audience of Protestants So only in America thank God each night that such an organization as the American Legion exists in our country The American Legion has become the watchdog of democracy the guardian of equal rights for all a warning to destructive interests the world over that Americans will stand alone if necessary in support of true democratic government and against the hates and prejudices of a world gone mad Confessions of a Nazi Spy The most defiant motion picture ever made Confessions of a Nazi Spy is the film Harry had been looking for where they could actually use the word Nazi in a film and let people know what Hitlers up to We are proud of our new Germany Confessions of a Nazi Spy was definitely a milestone in American cinema Its the first American movie that is an explicitly antiNazi film They were writing it in shooting in the beginning of and it premiered in April Until then the Production Code Administration had consistently turned down every project that had to do with Nazis They would not let the studios make anything attacking Hitler was this your first trip to Germany No was born in Germany Really Where In Runaborg Do you know it Yes we always get our Christmas candles from there They smell so good Yes they smell of honey and heather Heather almost as far as the eye could see And you found it changed Changed The sheep are gone now Why Theres a Hitler stormtroop barrack in the middle of the heather My old pasture is in a concentration camp My friends talk in Whispers When they talk at all You have family left in Runaborg Yes my brother and some relatives and their children Oh wish that You believe in that system believe in the purposes and destiny of the Third Reich and our Fuhrer Adolf Hitler What happened in February the uncovered a Nazi spy ring operating in the United States and they brought them to trial in early October in New York And the Warner Bros realized that this was their opportunity to come in and make their antiNazi film Because now they were making a film about a real case It was an story They flew out one of their Writers to watch the trial in New York They then signed up Leon Turrou Who had been the agent Who broke the case And Turrou flew out to Los Angeles as a consultant Where he Wrote in a number of articles how impressed he was by the Warner brothers and by the real dedication of the studio and everyone involved with the production to make an antiNazi film That information concerned only enemies of our party and our Fuhrer Your Fuhrer thought you said you were a loyal American am They came under tremendous pressure not to make this movie number of actors turned down parts because they feared that there would be Nazi reprisals against families that were still living in Germany or Austria or any of the occupied lands The German council came to the studios came to Will Hays and threatened that Germany would boycott all Hollywood films if they allowed the Warner Bros movie to be released Warners got tremendous pressure from other studio heads who said Look youre really endangering our wellbeing by making this movie And perhaps the worst was Jack Warner came home one day and there was a big envelope that had come in the mail and when he opened it up he found a blueprint of his home And inside was a letter saying We know where you live And so the message was clear Dont make the movie but they made it anyway Germany invades Poland and the Free State of Danzig Efforts and hopes of diplomats for peaceful settlement are transformed into the roar of gunfire Warsaw is bombed blasted and shelled Poland is in ruins People were isolationist for the most part The polls that Were taken We dont wanna have anything to do with what was happening in Europe dont Wanna be no corporal Whats that dont Wanna be no corporal Why not Wait a minute captain let him talk Well you see Is it because of your religious convictions York Yes sir thats it Youre a religious man York Yes sir You Want to Worship God in your own Way Yes sir Youre a farmer Yes sir You wanna plow your fields as you see fit and raise your family according to your own rights And thats your heritage and mine Every Americans But the cost of that heritage is high Sometimes it takes all we have to preserve it Even our lives How you going to answer that York Wow You done give me a powerful lot to be athinking about Well take your time We all know that the fight against intolerance did not end with the armistice of It may never end It has been Well and truly said that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty In Harry was called before a Senate subcommittee to testify about using motion pictures as propaganda and charged with creating hysteria by inciting Americans to go to war In defense of Warner Bros films he responded The only crime we are guilty of is accurately portraying reality week later the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and the charges were dropped The brothers dedicated all the studio resources to the war effort and made training films for soldiers It s been a wonderful evening and d like to stay some more But gotta get a move on now sail at half past Heil That troop ship bound for Africa pulls out at half past Good evening Hollywood Canteen The brothers recruited Hollywoods biggest stars to support the troops and to raise millions of dollars in war bonds The only way you can see the Canteen is to join the Army the Navy the Marines Even Casablanca rallied Americans to join the fight against fascism All right major you asked for it Bogart is the archetypal American Who has to be persuaded in one way or another that you need to engage with the war That you need to engage in the fight against fascism and Nazism You have any idea what youd look forward to if you stayed Nine chances out of Wed Wind up at a concentration camp Isnt that true Louie Major Strasser Would insist Youre saying this only Casablanca of course is the greatest romantic melodrama ever made and it has this character at the center who is very bitter and very cynical about everything Who ultimately is redeemed by love and by the noble effort of the Second World War Although Casablanca reflected Harrys convictions about fighting fascism it was Jack who ultimately took the Oscar for it Hal Wallis the producer of Casablanca and many other top Warner Bros films rose to accept his Best Picture Oscar only to see Jack Warner make a beeline to the stage before he could even get to the aisle In Wallis words couldnt believe it was happening Casablanca had been my creation Jack had absolutely nothing to do with it Let me tell you about Jack Warners editing skills knew one of his first editors and he said He was the kind of a guy its gotta be his way Hes always right said How did you get around that He says would cut the days work and d always have one obvious flub mean obvious Eddie Anybody who didnt know about the picture business would see it and say Hold it What the hell are you crazy Didnt you see that Fix that goddamn it And he wouldnt bother with anything else and loved that because it was my cut In Los Angeles vast crowds hail Frances thanks for Americas Friendship Food Train Highlight of the ceremonies the presentation to Harry Warner of a torch lighted from the eternal flame at the tomb of Frances unknown soldier National chairman of the American Friendship Food Train Mr Warner expresses the hope that these examples of international brotherly love may be the forerunners of peace on earth and goodwill toward all men among all the peoples of the world In When people never mind What their faith is that is immaterial were persecuted and executed that we didnt rise Had we have risen at that time there would have been no war If or dogs Were being executed in Germany m positive that the World Would have risen But oh no We hear arguments about isolationists about everything under the sun except making a home for those that were persecuted When he heard that they were thinking of taking all the Jews out of Germany and bringing them to Israel he said This is not a good idea This is a place that is now inhabited by both Arabs and Jews and this is not a place really that they should spend the rest of their lives He said Try Alaska Of course dont know whether he spoke to the Jews about that but that was one of his suggestions Jack also found himself wrestling with postwar problems The Cold War brought with it a congressional committee that spent years investigating Hollywood for possible communistic and subversive activities And am happy to have had the opportunity to testify If you want you can do it over Yeah blew it Ideology term Ideological terms rather Termites have burrowed into many American industries organizations and societies Wherever they may be say let us dig them out and get rid of them My brothers and will be happy to subscribe generously to a pestremoval fund We are willing to establish such a fund to ship to Russia the people who dont like our American system of government and prefer the communistic system to ours believe that there is definitely an antiSemitic component to the House Committee of UnAmerican Activities really believe that If you look at people called to testify people who are accused of having communist sympathies or theyve been to communist meetings or if theyre socialists there seems to be a preponderant number of Jews For many of the investigators antiSemitism communism and antifascism were all part and parcel of the same thing People who had been part of the antifascist movement in thes and earlys were immediately accused of also being communists He never felt that he had any Writer in his studio on the lot Who was Writing subversive material Whereas Jack wasnt so sure So there was a split between the two of them almost immediately during this period of the picture business being attacked During this time Harry is quoted as saying If my own brother were a communist d drag him down to the But its unclear whether that says more about his feelings for Jack than his feelings for communists and Harry Warner they dont There s problems there You know thats all ever heard You remember him taking lunch at a different time than Jack He went usually earlier than Jack yeah He Would go think around noon Whereas Jack Wouldnt come by Because he had to go by our office to go to the private dining room so would see him every day He would maybe go like and and he would miss Mr Warner of course and he very seldom came in the office There was so much anger going on between he and Jack and his illness would said the same thing be exacerbated by some meeting at the studio and You know and then he would come home and you could see the veins in his neck So that was from meetings with Jack Oh yeah m sure didnt put it quite as strongly but thats What said too The role that Albert played was keeping peace between the two brothers dont think people really understand how Jack and Harry just did not get along And anything Jack did Harry was furious about and m not so sure but understand he had quite a temper and Jack always thought that he was the Warner Bros Walt and my dad had a fiveyear fight Really They didnt speak Walt sort of Wanted to be king you know They finally resolved it semiamicably It was It was brutal My father Worked at the studio and he ended up being the referee between Jack and Harry And then d go to the lot with him on Saturday and d see this booming factory of creativity going on and yet was hearing these stories about these guys chasing each other wanting to kill each other mean literally my dad had to stop my grandfather from killing Jack with a Yeah With a lead pipe Really And people have witnessed you know Only brothers think used to say that about Walt and Dad too Only brothers could fight like that Anybody else would have said Walt m through with this deal m going into some other business Yeah yeah Extraordinary But the blood was important The struggles with Jack were taking its toll Harrys health was deteriorating and the family was encouraging him to retire against his wish to stay in the game When they did receive an offer Jack and Abe were ready to sell Harry had not Wanted to sell the studio and Jack insisted this was a good price a good time it was time for them to get out of it and so on He had argued and argued and argued with Harry and Harry finally said Okay Jack sold it to Semenenko who was head of the Bank of Boston at that time Semenenko had it for one day and sold it back to Jack without Harrys involvement which is a Wow As far as know we all tendered our stock Jack made a horrible deal for the family That a brother would do that to another brother after being in business all those years and the business having been run and survives because of the older brothers business acuity and And somewhat Sam Warner too And without Sams invention nothing forget it If Jack and Ann had been hard up and you know needed money you know there mightve been Not an excuse for it but some rationale to it But Jack was a very rich man with more houses and villas and things than you could count on both hands He didnt need it mean he just didnt need it And it was just a dirty trick And that was the betrayal to end all betrayals Albert couldnt stop talking about that to me About what a son of a bitch Jack was how he could have done it He couldnt believe he was his brother at any time And at that point Albert Major never spoke as far as know to Jack again ever Mr Warner just had a fit You Want me to tell you What he said Over my dead body will he be president of this company But he actually was and Mr Warner found out then that he couldnt do anything about it And that really hurt him you know he was so broken up And felt so sorry for him when he went to leave He came over and shook my hand and he said m gonna leave now And said Well youll come back wont you He said ll never put foot in this lot again said Yes you Will He said No Wont And dont think he ever did Now greatness returns to the screen Yahoo guess youre about the bestlooking gal Weve seen around here in a long time The star who became a legend who spoke for all the restless young as no one has before or since Why thank you Jett Thats a very nice compliment And m gonna tell my husband ve met with your approval Oh well now Wouldnt do that mean Well no l had made Rebel Without a Cause and then went into Giant with James Dean Jimmy and were having lunch and suddenly Jack Warner and Serge Semenenko were walking toward us And Mr Warner said Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy want you to meet someone Serge Semenenko And Serge Semenenko reached out his hand to shake hands with Jimmy Jimmy reached into his pocket and pulled out a bunch of change and threw it at their feet and walked off And sort of wentand followed him like m years old followed him like a little puppy dog saying What was that all about Harry got stabbed in the back by his brother Shortly after the studio sale hit the trade papers Grandpa suffered a debilitating stroke It was his th Wedding anniversary and they were having a big celebration out at the ranch Harry now is completely isolated a prisoner in his own body and down in the yard in the tent are all the family was in the room alone With Harry Who couldnt speak and just sat looking out of the window And my father pops through the door all cheery and bright with jokes Poor Harry some tears came down his cheek and rolled down his cheek There was only one way he could get away from this man Who he hated Who had done terrible things so he closed his eyes At this time my father was in the south of France and immediately sent him a cable that Harry had died They hadnt planned the funeral that we were gonna wait to hear about Jack coming back He didnt communicate With me but evidently sent a cable that he couldnt come back Jack was in a terrible car accident about five or six days later Had he come home to his brothers funeral this might not have happened He was seriously injured and didnt return to the studio for about six months We used to think Jack Jr Would take over Everybody there liked the guy Before Jack came back to the lot he had an attorney fire his son for supposedly giving the press the impression that he was dying Said m terminated as of then and will be paid for six months And said Why Then he took me aside and was like Every time he looks at you he sees Irma Thats my mother They changed the locks my name was gone All boom like that As m leaving theyre putting up a sign over the main entrance that says Welcome back Jack You know you always wonder about film whether its mirroring whats going on or leading whats going on What was going on the year prior to the sale was the production of the film East of Eden a family drama about rival brothers Your son Aron he s everything that s good James Dean played the unappreciated son James Deans next role was a lonely discontented rebel without a cause You re tearing me apart Finally on his own with no older brother looking over his shoulder Jack took creative risks with films like Whos afraid of Virginia Woolf Virginia Woolf Virginia Woolf Whos afraid of Virgin He said Wexler Mike Nichols wants you to shoot Virginia Woolf And said don t know whether said sir or not but certainly felt sir and at that time it was And said was signed up to do Fine Madness with Kershner Jack Warner did not waste much time He said Youre gonna do Mike Nichols picture He said the famous lines about not working in Hollywood again There was a feeling when Nichols arrived with this group and this kind of material and Haskell things would Jack understood that That things Were now changing You still look like you have a good body too Is that right Have you Martha decency forbids Shut up Is that right Have you kept your body Its still pretty good Work out Do you Yeah Yes Warner Bros did Whos Afraid Of Virginia Woolf Which was a very bold movie that no other studio would have touched at the time And he was the one who approved it and got it made and stood behind it so landmark movies continued to be made by Warner Bros until Jack Warner was finally put out to pasture Camelot Camelot Camelot is a big romantic musical produced by Jack Warner who brought My Fair Lady to the screen He personally supervises the project Its fascinating to me that Camelot was Jacks last studio film Lines like Happiness is a virtue but no one can be happy and wicked They can be triumphant but not happy And then theres Blood is thicker than water was invented by undeserving relatives The same thing happened when Seven Arts came in They bought Warner Bros from Jack as recall a figure of million Amazing to think of today in million Of course they said Well youll have an office Youll still be Jack Warner head of the studio you know He had nothing to do no papers crossed his desk you know and in a year he was gone know everything everyone said about Jack and could see you know but understood it He had dreams of What he Would liked to have been of what he would have done if he could have and so forth But those are the things that Made me fond of Jack because saw the longing in him to be something that he wasnt The key to the real Jack Warner may be hidden on the back of an unsent postcard found buried in an old box On it written in his handwriting are these words have made a new resolution not to speak Never never say a word Not to utter more than absolutely essential to erect barricades and walls of silence between myself and the world One has to be a cobblestone or a diamond not to be shattered by the hardness of most people Perhaps it is much harder to struggle against oneself than against fate Mr Warner was relieved of his being the frontman and all of a sudden he had a lot of powerful lawyers telling him what to do which didnt sit very well just know everybody was terribly upset and that Mr Warner went home He Went home to his big house It was an honor to be under contract at Warner Bros It wasnt sort of It wasnt a little thing It was like going into the major leagues you know It was You know it was the Yankees and the Dodgers all combined for me This was a place you belonged to It was a family You were part of a family And for that privilege of being a part of that family you did what they told you to do Hello Hi is this BetteAnn Yes Its your grandfather My grandfather and the Warner Brothers father were brothers So you know what the real Warner last name is Yes do think my sister and are the only ones who really know That is so amazing Can you tell me what it is Yes its Wonskolaser Wonskolaser Won And you say it Wonskolaser Right Now is that Is that That is like Oh my God Can you imagine Wonskolaser Bros Presents Yeah exactly The Warner Bros made the pictures that they wanted to see and that they thought were valuable and worthwhile Thats a whole different mindset Thought you were smarter than to stick your kisser in couldnt stand by and watch him shoot you down The potential force of motion pictures for good has just begun to be tapped All we have done is only a foundation for future greatness but we can take pride in the fact that our foundation is a firm one It is solid bedrock for future generations of pioneers to build upon My brothers and thank you one and all You have made us very happy tonight United they stood divided they fell Yet their ideals live on in all those who believe in using media to educate entertain and enlighten In other words those who have the chutzpah to put their tokhes on the table to make their dreams a reality And Jack Were family Were mishpokhe As your heartfelt postcard said It is much harder to struggle against oneself than against fate But now fate will not have the last word d like to believe ve kept my promise to you Grandpa
