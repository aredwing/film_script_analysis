As far as con man stories go think ve heard them all Of grifters ropers farofixers tales drawn long and tall But if one bears a bookmark in the confidence mans tome it would be that of Penelope and of the brothers Bloom At and Bloom and Stephen the younger and the old had been through several foster families No Thirtyeight all told Mischief moved them on in life and moving kept them close For Bloom had Stephen and Stephen Bloom and both had more than most Another home another Main Street Stephen looked around and summed the burg up thusly Bloom weve hit a onehat town One theater One car wash One cafe One park One cat which through some mishap had one leg Sweet Jesus Look at that One public school one tightknit group of local welloff kids Their pocketchange bought rocket pops The brothers Pixy Stix They were the they all wellloved rooted happy as you please always there in every town Playground bourgeoisies Could he simply Talk to her Just drop his fears and go Leave his brother in the woods and join the children No So in the root of Stephens psyche something now began seed of grand epiphany hook tale plan fiction both for profit and to ease his brothers heart simple con in steps And this is where we start And then as if a curtain had been pulled back from the sky some barrier within the younger Bloom was broken Hi So Bloom performed his role in Stephens story to a And being who he wasnt could be as he wished to be So the tale You tell them Theres a hermit in the woods oneeyed steeltoothed vagabond With bloodred eyes Thats good He stopped you coming home from school And told me of a cave What kind of cave cave of wonder Shut up Dave At noon on every Sunday there appears a ball of light which flutters like a butterfly willowisp Thats right It guides you If you can keep up to where the treasures lay So wheres this cave Yeah where The hermit didnt say He got this greedy glinting look the filthy redeyed leech and said hed tell for bucks Well thats just bucks each And so that Sunday straight from church into the woods Bloom led They stopped Their hearts leapt There it was Just like the hermit said For just one moment Bloom forgot himself and ran too fast Hed catch the light and find the treasure but the moment passed They didnt catch the willowisp but didnt really care It seems to me that in the end the perfect con is where each one involved gets just the thing they wanted Yeah guess so Our fledgling thieves were satisfied The childrens parents less so bitter ending Maybe But theres sweetness in the mix The brothers Bloom had found their calling as shown in number six Cut meant to negotiate Percent percentage deal Henrys was the towns one dryclean shop Pleasure doing business with you So hows it feel In truth young Bloom wont know for years just how he felt And so well skip ahead now in our story Let em melt He gets the scarab you get the money and get the girl So in the end everyone gets everything he wants Victor Charleston what have you done Oh my God Oh God hes dead He was the only one who knew where our money was buried and you shot him Charleston you dunce The man named Charleston that you met four months and years ago in a hotel bar in Jodhpur is dead If we see each other again itll be as strangers As for the money let it rot Wow Wow is the word youre looking for Wow Youre a genius Stephen Were genius Bloom Now in defense of that shiteating grin on my older brothers face what he just pulled off was pretty amazing He hinged the entire con on this question Would Charleston our spineless mark would he actually pull that trigger Maybe But Stephen wanted better odds He positioned me in the same spot where six years ago Charlestons wife had stood and told him she was leaving He picked my suit to match her outfit He even phonetically matched my final words to hers This is the end Charleston Youve always been such a dunce So in the end everyone gets everything he wants Tastes like tinfoil So does real blood Buy you a drink Nine months and years ago He was quoting from Kipling He stole that from Kipling No he didnt So wheres this wrap party Make way make room for the brothers Bloom Yeah yeah All right here we go Gather round friends and accomplices Think of a card You got it No If do it enough someday its gonna work on someone And then itll be the best damn card trick in the world Its true you never work with the same crew twice Well shit Except for the Bang Bang You know m pretty big into anime Shes our fifth Beatle She knows the ins and outs dont think she speaks more than three words of English Campari So shes with you and Bloom till the end Till the wind changes Where is Bloom There you are You hiding Yep ve been learning Stephen likes to talk about you He tell you the cave story Is it true What else did he tell you You two kicked around until your early teens winding up in the grotty outskirts of St Petersburg where you learned the big con from an oldschool grifter named the Diamond Dog Is that true That was his name Yep And he was your mentor But get the sense it ended badly Stephen took his eye out with an antique rapier Why did he do that The brothers Bloom lit out on their own to make their fortune as gentleman thieves Sounds romantic It does You dont understand what my brother does He writes his cons the way dead Russians write novels with thematic arcs and embedded symbolism and shit And he wrote me as the vulnerable antihero And thats why you think you wanna kiss me Its a con m going nuts Theres the big two We missed the sunrise That would have been nice Is this the bathroom No This is camels Hold on must make piss At least youre honest All right lets do this Lets just get it done So first you say m quitting Stephen m out Then say Do we have to go through this again Go through this again And then you make a show of putting on your jacket and you say No mean it this time Stephen This time m really out And then you say Lets have a drink and in the morning Bloom youll have come to your senses Its a major design flaw in fake blood by the way And well be moving on Real blood turns brown Listen to me Stephen after half an hour This Scotch cost more than your suit Listen to me The flask stopped a bullet in Normandy Listen Holy shit Thats my new favorite camel hate you Okay Oh God cant do this anymore cant wake up next to another person who thinks they

painful ways to cut into a mark you know Score to beat is Keep your head in the game The Japanese judge is very tough This is a banana seat man Dont give me that blank look you know what a goddamn banana seat is Oh Shit Shit Theres actually a knack to this If youre trying to fast track into a marks sympathies theres nothing quite as effective as having your first conversation be from a hospital bed they put you in What Oh come on actually think this is kind of a great thing and ll tell you why Dostoevsky was an epileptic His seizures were preceded by an enlightened euphoria a sort of opening of his spiritual eye think the fact that she saw your face the instant before a seizure is a pretty goddamn good foot to start things off on right The next step is to figure out a way to insinuate yourself into their personal life think they took my car Could you drive me home Yeah Okay m gonna Step three engagement Find a connection with your mark through conversation Get invited in for coffee Tell them the full tale Set your hook didnt really have anyone except each other growing up and our father was in the antique business He had a shop in Charleston We realized one day we saw the

pinhole camera You can make a pinhole camera out of anything hollow and dark Its gotta warp the image though right Yeah yeah it does mean thats whats good about it mean you could point this baby at the most menial everyday little thing like the fabric or your Your face or anything and depending on how the pinhole eats the light its gonna be warped and peculiar and imperfect and odd and its not gonna be reproduction its storytelling Its a lie that tells the truth dont know about truths photograph is a secret about a secret The more it tells you less you know Whats changed between now and

Yuengling like the beer No So what are your plans in Greece dont plan Good for you When they begin the beguine It brings back the sound of music so tender You look very nice It brings back a night of tropical splendor It brings back a memory of green What was your childhood like made cameras out of watermelons Lonely When was five got really bad rashes and allergies and hay fever So my mom took me to the doctor and he did that test where they use needles to prick a grid on your back with different toxins on them you know to see which ones youre allergic to Next day come in the doctor lifts up my shirt and my back is a patch of oily moldy blackishgreen doublepuff marshmallows was allergic to everything So they sealed the house with plastic and a special ventilation system and spent the rest of my childhood and adolescence indoors Alone Lonely Wow It wasnt till was they discovered what was actually allergic to was the aluminum alloy the hypodermic needles were made out of Then was gonna leave but my mom got sick So stayed She stayed sick a really long time Do you Feel cheated The trick to not feeling cheated is to learn how to cheat So decided this wasnt a story about a miserable girl trapped in a house that smelled like medical supplies wasting her life on a dying person she sometimes hated No This was a story about a girl who could find infinite beauty in anything any little thing And even love the person she was trapped with And told myself this story until it became true Now did doing this help me escape a wasted life or did it blind me so wouldnt want to escape it dont know But either way was the one telling my own story so No dont feel cheated at all dont suppose in all your hobbyacquiring you ever learned how to dance went through a phase when was mildly obsessed with the bolero Give me a minute Its a long time since last encountered the brothers Bloom Are you in antiques Antique wonder my dear if you know the true nature of the men you travel with little fear
