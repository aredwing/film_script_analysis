voice And it was the most beautiful voice ever heard And it said m going to take your baby but you are going back And woke up and there was Ralph and the doctor was legally dead for four and a half

He could use some air You guys could get him some fluids Thanks for saving my life It was so much fun Lets get that blood pressure going Are you all right wise one feel like a highlytuned instrument

Got him successful Hurley lives Its okay Joe It was great Here it comes Just let him talk Define great dont know Its not thinking about the past or the future Its difficult to explain Maybe impossible Dying is funny that way Nelsons right There definitely is activity beyond death Absolutely The experience was strange It was almost erotic Hes dead and he gets laid Wait a second What do you mean erotic dont want you to think it was casually wantonly sexual by any means That never would have occurred to me in a million years It was friendly There was something vaguely feminine guiding me This could be the conquest of our generation The last great frontier First you had the sea then America Then the West the moon Mr Leary drugs the inner journey Miss MacLaine and our former First Lady the outer journey But this is ours We did have disco We have found something worthwhile to upstage those fucking baby boomers Watch your mouths found something Lets not forget that came back from the dead tonight Doesnt surprise me We had Elvis in here last night Pay when youre ready okay Did you find it difficult at the end getting back Not that remember But you remember everything else You guys are full of shit m not buying any of this probably wouldnt buy it either unless d been there What about it Youre an atheist Youve got nothing to lose m going next Wait a minute Nobody is going next Theres no answers here You saw what you wanted to see Give it up Its getting too dangerous Who the hell are you We cant turn back now m going further Two minutes Whoa you just said changed my mind Two minutes Well looks like we found a winner Enjoying yourself Nelson Joe was there anything negative about your experience Anything negative at all No Nothing Good Hold on Was that your idea of chivalry Absolutely not Maybe trying to show me up What makes you think everything is always about you Because nobody seems to want me to go under dont need your protection There seems to be a lot of speculation about what you do need Manus Does there And what did you decide in your infinite wisdom decided that when someone as smart and driven as you are and incredibly beautiful it makes the rest of us very nervous Whyd you change your mind m the skeptic the control on this experiment should go next If theres nothing there wont convince myself there is Then theres no reason for us to go any further How do you explain the similarity of death experiences all over the world People from different cultures and religions all seeing the same things in the same order dont know Maybe theres a chemical or hormone released from the brain at the time of death that makes it more palatable to us No youre reaching What if you go and there is something out there Well then you can kill yourself for as long as you want m not going to kill myself m glad to hear that because havent known you for long but might miss you Why this obsession with death Its not an obsession its an interest Its a personal interest Good night Can drive you home No thanks didnt take your money You gave it to me got your toaster Too many appliances make you love me Right Nelson Because in the end we all know what weve done Champ Come on boy Come here Champ Come here boy Come on Champ What are you doing here kid You all right You okay Are you lost Halloween morning Rotting pumpkins Burning leaves Black cats mating like rats in the alley It was as It were as if we felt no fear As if we were already dead and had nothing to lose by dying Or perhaps it was because we lived life so well and loved life so much that we imagined ourselves immortal overwhelming the powers that be with the force of our passion for science Or maybe we were just fucked in the head m Joe Hurley Youre Terry right heard you had a neardeath experience dont want to talk about it Wait a minute had a neardeath experience also You did Yes and need somebody to talk to This thing changed my life First of all they didnt believe me What the hell do they know We were there right Tell me all about it But if you have class maybe we can get together some night and discuss it All that day knew something was going to happen ve always

You were brain dead There was no mind But some electrical currents still circulating through my body It would have shown up on the You were dead Tell us what happened Its hard to verbalize Its like being paranoid without the fear Like being watched It was probably just you guys standing over me Who could be watching The dead didnt say that But the skeptic did feel something didnt you m going again No way ve been bumped twice Bidding starts at four minutes Labraccio went for That was a mistake We almost lost him Anything under four minutes Would be redundant No one is going for four
