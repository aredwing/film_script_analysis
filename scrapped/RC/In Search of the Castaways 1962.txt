that again What do you mean Ever since posted the reward for news on your fathers ship people have been turning up with notes theyve found in bottles How many is this John Twentytwo father If had my way every last one of the culprits would be hanged from the yardarm Exploiting human misery it is Nothing more vicious more treacherous But it is from my father can tell Monsieur Paganel show them the note you found Speaks French Well Oh m sorry Wrong bottle Laughter This is the one First question Whered you find the bottle You see went fishing with some students You cut open a fish and found the bottle Oui oui milord a pound shark Throw this man off the ship before turn him over to the police No your lordship But it is the truth what tell you Why should a shark swallow a bottle Oh what was in

could be alone for a moment Take your hands off me monsieur Never have been thrown from any place in my life Lets not set a precedent Speaks French Children dont you think d be the first to respond if thought there was a chance of finding your father or his crew d go to the ends of the earth And thats no idle boast The Glenarvan motto Persevero Been the family creed for years But its not a hoax saw the note myself and know my father wrote it The way he makes his letters Just more clever than the rest thats all When you consider the odds itd be fantastic finding the bottle But this business about it being swallowed by a shark Well what would my father have to do come back here himself and say wrote the note Come and find me Did understand you to say you came from Plymouth Tell Osmond to get cabins ready Well drop them off there Very well But what about Paganel We cant go off and leave him Now my dear m only doing whats best for you Speaks French Howd he get past you in the first place

wine Follow me please This way miss Cabin number five on the starboard side Course Fitchets a lot older than you Maybe not actually in years but Oh hes been around more dont know what you mean by that Theres probably nobody else in the world my age whos made as many trips to the Mediterranean Well thats just it mean have you ever been to South America for instance As a matter of fact no Mary Pacific Ocean Ever seen that Its only an ocean You should have waited and had breakfast with my father Hed have to give the order to change course for South America Oh he would go Nothing could stop him If it were for something you could believe in and not this note in a bottle Let me ask you something If you were a castaway and you had a bottle would you put a note in it and throw it into the sea Oh dont think so After all its such a small chance Isnt it What would you do then Just sit there with the empty bottle until you died or something All right suppose would try it But wouldnt expect someone to find it inside a shark Well if thats where they did find it you wouldnt expect them to just forget about you would you John You never saw that Frenchman before until he showed up with the bottle and yet you believe every word he says And no matter what he says you and your father refuse to believe him Suppose d told you d found a bottle with a note in it Would you believe me Well did you Yes And what did it say It said Disregard first message suppose you think thats funny dont you Youve got your father so to you this is just a big joke Wait a minute m not making a joke of it m trying to show you Do you mind ll make you an offer What kind of an offer dont believe this story about the shark swallowing the bottle but am getting fed up with these infernal trips to the Mediterranean Gasps Down boy Good old boy ll bring you a bun or something later Thats a good boy Barking Bonjour In case youve emptied your own pockets And just dont let any shark get this away from you Chuckles Thank you assure you mademoiselle your case shall be properly presented After all Father suppose it was you cast away Do you think would give up if had even the slightest clue d live up to all the legends of Glenarvan persevere if had to move heaven and earth Why dont we try Corsica Thursday Will you listen Havent been there for years Suppose you were cast away and had a bottle You wouldnt sit staring at it until you died would you Youd try putting a note into it Suppose for some reason it did get swallowed by a shark Most unlikely d say Very well then If you wont listen shall be getting off at Plymouth with Mary and Robert Glenarvan Come come John feel strongly If thats the way you feel about it lets look at the note Where is it In the bottle Wheres that The Frenchman has it Confound it wheres the Frenchman You had him thrown off the ship in Glasgow Thats a fine thing When want something no one takes notice drop a casual remark Casual remark Throw him off the ship before call the police We ought to hang him Now were in a fix That Frenchman might be anywhere by now Wheres Captain Mangles Tell Captain Mangles to Oh Oui milord Good gracious the Frenchman thought Oh but give you my word was put off the ship Fortunately do not let such things upset me The note milord Useless Theres practically nothing left Oh but with a little study a little intelligence it is possible to make out what is said You will see one thing without question Their location is given as degrees minutes south in latitude Thats no good without the longitude Consider first milord on the th parallel there are only a few places they could be ve always said If Captain Grants anywhere hes in Australia Its logical if you know about shipping and commerce Use the head milord The note makes reference to being captured no You can make out the word Indian or Indians So where on the th parallel would they be captured by Indians Australia or course Aborigines yes Indians no By George ve got it South America Couldnt be anywhere else If he was captured by Indians the west coast Its a matter of simple logic monsieur Well go there And follow the th parallel over the Andes until we find Captain Grant Osmond find Captain Mangles Tell him m gonna change course Thank you Oh chuckles Now dont forget it was me who arranged Thank you Thank you milord Oh please m an Englishman you know

He said bring help And he will If he got through Dont even think such things All right But if may paraphrase what a wise girl once said to me many years ago If you were marooned in an ombu tree and you had logs and something to tie them with you wouldnt just sit there till you died or something would you Thats very good For a girl mean Sighs suppose most girls are taught embroidery and things

only in and around the Indian Ocean Thats what the word Indian means in the note Not that they were captured by Indians If you knew this why didnt you tell me before paid all that money kept hoping milord that maybe somehow could be wrong This can mean only one thing Captain Grant is in Australia Australia Thats where wanted to go only let you talk me out of it Oh my dear children m sorry it all had to end like this Listen Thalcave speak For many years my people hunt Trail game many miles Sometimes sneak up but game not there But Indian knows if game not there it somewhere else Keep looking Otherwise Indian die out many years ago Keep looking Hes right you know Now we know where Captain Grant really is And by Jove well go and find him Oh thank you Thalcave Thank you How does she look to you Just what we need Aint a ship hereabouts could overhaul her What about the steam We can learn The old man wants to know what happened to the Britannia Maybe should tell him Youre not serious are you Maybe should tell him The very spot your lordship where she sank beneath the waves Me own dear brother lost his life trying to put out in a small boat to save the crew It was shocking All right pay them off Very good Thank you lordship Much obliged Glenarvan wont see anymore Very good Look at that Ridiculous preposterous How can a ship go down in a dozen different places sometimes miles apart answer me that Confounded wharf rats Lie to you Take your money Cut your throat given half a chance How the dickens can tell where to start eh What do you want Mr Ayrton to see you didnt want to see anybody else This is a gentleman hope havent arrived at an awkward moment couldnt get here sooner would have warned you Youll find very little integrity among some of the men who frequent our waterfront It happens that have the very information you require About my father This is the daughter of Captain Grant Well if could reunite this delightful child and her gallant father that is the reward m interested in Were you ever in Plymouth Plymouth England No havent had that pleasure May inquire sir as to the nature of your information Two years ago was caught in a violent storm in the Tasman Sea We picked up a poor fellow badly battered and halfdrowned just off the coast of New Zealand New Zealand He said he was from the Britannia Shed gone down with all hands He died in the night and our ship combed the area the following day Until read about the message in the bottle had no idea there were any survivors Why wasnt the sinking reported when you reached land assumed it was was only a passenger on the ship If he landed in New Zealand he must have been captured by the Maoris ll report this to the authorities m afraid it isnt as easy as that Why ever not You havent had my experience in dealing with our government You learn to get along in spite of them They talk endlessly and they need authorization from London Youll be lucky if theyre ready in a year Anything could happen to him in a year What do you suggest Oh cant get mixed up in this ve told you all that know ve got my own estates to run Sir the lives of three men are at stake d like to speak to this gentleman alone please The trouble is New Zealand is not in the Indian Ocean Theres something strange Very strange dont care what he says ve seen that man Youre just imagining it No m not cant stand people that look at me like that Delightful child Gallant father Its a good sign that neither of you take to him because everything else that youve welcomed with open arms has turned out dead wrong Shuddering dont wish to break the law Certainly not dont intend to leave Captain Grant in the hands of bloodthirsty cannibals So appeal to you as a man with experience and knowledge of local conditions to help us before its too late All right ll gather up some men who know the Maoris and who can handle any kind of situation By Jove you mean we just go in and have it out with them Oh no Well take along some supplies to barter and if Grant and his men are still alive well buy them back Capital idea cant tell you how grateful am to you need hardly remind you that we must be discreet about what we plan Of course Dont want to be tied down by a lot of red tape do we Just my son John and Captain Mangles otherwise not a word to a soul Yes just as it should be Man Get this crate down in the hull Men shouting Motley looking lot of fellows youve got together Well when you look for men to go into Maori country you dont choose from among the social elite Laughs Jolly well put didnt realize youd require quite so much merchandise The days have gone when one could impress the natives with a handful of colored beads If they choose to sell their prisoners dearly wed better be prepared see John youve got to tell me whats going on out there Ah mademoiselle you are too beautiful in ze new gown to worry your little head about such things But whats in all those boxes If my father wanted you to know he wouldve told you Every man out there looks like a fugitive from the penal colony John youve got to do something Dont let this man make a fool of your father Just because he calls you a delightful child and you dont like it hes trying to make a fool of my father It is better that we think it monsieur than give him the opportunity to prove it Let me tell you something both of you My father huffs and puffs a little bit and weve all smiled at him just in fun but dont think anybody is going to make a fool of him as easily as Well certain people could name Gasps And now if youll excuse me Patience dear Nous verrons ce que nous verrons We shall see what we shall see ll wager shes faster than any ship in the Royal Navy d say that steam was the coming thing if it werent so complicated to handle Dont know about complicated Its simple Yes Pardon milord Could talk to you sometime before too long What about No matter how much think about it it is always the same Captain Grant is in Australia There is no way the note could mean he is in New Zealand My dear fellow dont worry about that note Mr Ayrton knows precisely where the Britannia went down Of course Milord ll be the happiest man in the world if it turns out that once again m wrong have no doubt you will be If its no trouble d like to see the engine room Delighted to take you think youll find theres nothing complicated about steam Its a beautiful day Why not enjoy it Let bygones be bygones Now that were at sea can let you in on our secret if youre interested Those boxes you were wondering about Would you like to know whats in them Trinkets trade goods Theyre for barter so we can buy your fathers freedom Who told you this Mr Ayrton And you believed him All right Miss Suspicious If itll make you more companionable ll take you below and show you Men chattering Well here you are All right Pandora which box do you want me to open That one You sure you dont have a guilty feeling After all it is rather like spying on someone Especially when theyve gone out of their way to be nice Open it will Straining Nothing is too much trouble if it satisfies your curiosity Voila mademoiselle Trade goods Trinkets he said So thats his game Hes using my fathers ship as a gunrunner Pity you did that Wilcox down here Whispering We must warn the others ll lead them off Make for the door Men shouting Man There he is Man see him Man Grab the boy Oh Now is that a nice way to behave when were taking you to meet your father Come on Make no noise Just stop the paddles Anything else and ll shoot Bell dings Been to New Zealand before Yes twice Do as tell you Perhaps youll live to make it three times Bell dings Were stopping That is most strange Raise the hands Quietly Do as he says Robert Screams John Help Lord Glenarvan Help Lord Glenarvan Help Lord Glenarvan thought heard the boy call for help You did Now give me that gun and no harm will come to him Glenarvan You cant put us out there without oars Its not human Oh the current will carry you to the shore if thats any consolation But m afraid well have to keep your crew on board until theyve taught us the fine points of using steam Were unaccustomed to such luxuries in the South Pacific Youll pay for this Youve got it backwards old man we have been paid for it and quite handsomely Cheer up Frenchy You promised youd be the happiest man in the world if you were wrong about Grant being in Australia And you were Brian and Riley lay her off and stand by to make sail Man Aye aye sir You were in Plymouth My father signed you on the day he sailed As third mate What a memory Youll hang for this you know ll see to it personally ll make a report to the admiralty Chuckling You do that And heres a bottle to put it in Hope it isnt swallowed by a shark Lower away Youll never get away with this Thats what Grant said when we put him over the side at this spot With his two rather foolishly loyal mates If youre lucky you might all end up in the same stewpot Men laughing If anyone is interested might explain It is the influence of the west wind drift playing against the East Australian current that might drive us right up onto the shore Yes yes yes Thats the second of my ships hes got First the Britannia and now my beautiful new steam yacht Its all clear now It was a mutiny Theres no reason why he should lie about it My father was set adrift here Then he must be a prisoner of the Maoris What did he mean we might all end up in the same stewpot Not to change the subject but our reception committee seems to be waiting Glenarvan Maoris Hundreds of them deuce of a fix no trinkets to bargain with What have we got to offer huh Just us suppose Shouting Laughter Good gracious You come a stranger ll take you in have prepared a place for thee in the presence of thine enemy Shouting Screams Its all right m sure hes harmless What think ye now be crazy eh Not a bit of it be smart Mark ye well the words of old

Grant My fathers Captain Grant of the Britannia Well why didnt you say so before Fine ship she was walked her decks across the seven seas Clattering Woe be unto thee Moab for thy sons are taken captive Who is he He seems to be the mate from the Britannia Do you know where he is Can you tell me Where is Captain Grant Have you no eyes Can you not see Hes gone Where Same as before Dianes Inlet Did the Maoris take him Nay he be smart too He learns the way to keep alive For they need him when they get more guns Guns That must be Ayrton Aye thats who it be Somehow the devil has got another ship Were there three of you Aye three of us there were Captain Grant McKnabb and old Bill Gaye against Ayrton and all of his mutinous crew Shouting My father Captain Grant did he and McKnabb go together to Dianes Inlet Nay my child say unto you McKnabb he was not smart Cackles He was caught when he tried to escape Poor devil Shouting Cackling Whats he laughing at For this child have prayed And the Lord hath granted my petition which asked of him This is the night the Lord hath given us our salvation What think ye Could a man force himself through there Even a man who has gone without food to make himself as thin as a man can be Nay say unto you it is impossible It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle Robert do you think you could crawl through there Maybe if tried very hard Cackling You be smart too If he could what good would it do ll show you now The Lord helps them that helps themselves Two years we took to make it From the hairs of our heads from the garments we wore from a thousand things we gathered Preposterous What could the boy possibly do all by himself Therell be more to it than that For this be the night of the harker Bide ye your time till the night be well be gone And the horns sound and the flames will leap upward and the devil hath seized the souls of our captors Then will show the way Shouting in native language Mary Nobodys looking Now John Up you go It looks awfully small Bill Go on Go on Straining m stuck Let out all the air Exhaling dont know which is worse crazy man who thinks hes smart or a Frenchman who admits hes stupid Hold that Grunts Now to get the pendulum swinging cackles Oh do be careful Cackling Lower away ve the unhappy feeling were going out of the frying pan into the fire Straining cackling He cant
