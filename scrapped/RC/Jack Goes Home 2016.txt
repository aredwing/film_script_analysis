nothing is wrong their mother sang loudly amidst flight and song You are with me the sky and the sea you who love and you who love me The boy sat down at the edge of the cliff tears in his eyes and wondering if But soon he would smile because all the while it was simply a dream and no evil scheme Mother alight lifts babe in her arms holding him tight with all of her charms She sings a sweet hum
