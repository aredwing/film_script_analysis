There he is How nobly he bears himself Oh it must be wonderful to be a man and a hero He carries himself like a king His eyes constantly look up searching for the queen Isnt he wonderful Yes love too has its victories And this think belongs to Her Majesty An easy victory if one is a queen and may command it What if Her Majesty should overhear you The day when Essex returns every petticoat is chosen with an eye to pleasing him Come along my son into the presence chamber You may do as you please Father ll have no part Dont be a fool Cecil Elizabeth is difficult even on good days Good or bad well see little of her with Essex home Somethings got to be done to tarnish him or hell share Englands throne Then where shall we be ll be hanged if welcome him You may be hanged if you do not my son You know Her Majestys infatuation for him But Your Majesty beg you to reconsider Essex is a proud man You must not do this thing to him Bacon this will not be easy for me Whatever he has done he is the man of all men closest to my heart Whatever he suffers suffer a thousand times more intently Then why Your Majesty why Because the necessities of a queen must transcend those of a woman His ambition has jeopardized the prosperity of the English people It may endanger the very peace and stability of England Your Majesty forgive this frankness but your love jeopardizes the situation situation fraught with gravest consequence for my subjects Bacon My personal feelings must not enter into this God help me Go now Let me alone Your Majesty My fan Hurry Present arms Up Robert Devereux by grace of Her Majesty Earl of Essex general of the horse and knight of the Garter Charles Baron Howard of Effingham Lord High Admiral of England Walter Raleigh knight vice admiral of the fleets and warden of the stannary Do you kneel in homage my Lord Essex or in shame Shame Your Majesty Have you lost your hearing as well as your military skill Stand up believe my military skill was well demonstrated at Cdiz madam Has our commissioner not brought you news of my victory Your victory For three years the rains of England have rotted our harvest to the ground Three years of famine and a depleted treasury But my Lord of Essex had the cure for that Yes indeed Raise me but madam says he and ll sail for Cdiz and fetch you such a Spanish treasure fleet as will make England rich again So did taxed my already overburdened people Got him his Now where is my Spanish treasure fleet Look He cant answer He darent answer Lf Your Majesty will let me tell you Go on then Unfortunately it was you who called the fleet back before my plans had been carried out Unfortunately the Spanish treasure fleet with million ducats lies beneath the waters of Cdiz Harbor sunk by the Spaniards themselves While Essex against the advice of Howard and Raleigh gathered fame for himself by storming the town There was naught else to be done It was for the glory of England For the glory of Essex Will that put food into the mouths of my starving people Can they subsist upon laurel wreaths from your heroic brow You think theyre displeased with what did at Cdiz madam Listen The English people are more readily pleased than their queen They cry your name but what will they say when must tax them again to pay off the soldiers and the fleet Is it nothing that pieces of Spanish ordnance were sunk in my hollow victory And the Spanish fleet totally destroyed Thanks to my Lord Howard and Sir Raleigh It seems youve no reward for me as a soldier madam That the soldier can endure But the man had hoped for a different kind of reception You meant well perhaps but my rewards are for unselfish effort not for things half or meanly done Sir Walter Raleigh From today you take rank as commander of our guard My Lord Howard Your Majesty In grateful return for what you tried to do at Cdiz without thought of self and only for your countrys honor appoint you lord lieutenant general of all England commander of my army and my fleet and name you Earl of Nottingham Your Majesty Thats impossible Keep silent will not Do you intend this Earl of Nottingham to take precedence over me Hell take precedence over you as he did in wisdom at Cdiz You were in command and abused it with Essex first and England second Think that if you will but its an injustice you place Howard before me feel you have no right have have no right As a queen yes But as a woman do mean nothing to you Nothing Lord Essex Do you dare turn your back on Elizabeth of England You dare would not have taken that from the king your father Much less will accept it from a king in petticoats If the courier comes send him to me at once You may go said thats all Well With Your Graces indulgence theres another matter Well what is it Whats it about Essex Did not forbid his name to be spoken at court But Sir Thomas Egerton received a letter from him from his manor at Wanstead knew hed come to it Cecil Begging Egerton to intercede for him of course Well perhaps was a little harsh What did the letter say When is he coming home have it here Let me see He says owe to Her Majesty a duty of allegiance in which never can never will fail Poor darling Of course hes sorry But a little apprehensive perhaps Go on Go on But do not owe her the duty of attendance upon her And had that duty Her Majestys conduct has canceled it As for asking her pardon why should ask pardon for receiving an insult Stop it No No go on ll hear it When the vilest of indignities is done to me not even religion enforces me to sue have received the wrong Let her seek pardon of me And if she refuses all her power can show no more strength in oppressing me than can summon to resist it Cecil this is intolerable Are you sure Essex wrote this Not you or your friends Your Majesty Dont Your Majesty me You slimy toad know human nature Nothing would suit you so well as to see Essex saying farewell to his head Will Your Grace examine the letter more closely Rumor hath it you are not unacquainted with Milord of Essexs writing And rumor hath it have a heavy hand for insolence Have you forgotten it Now get out But madam Get out say Robert Robert dont know which hate the most you for making me love you or myself for needing you so There has seldom been a man so unwise so headstrong but he could see the necessity of keeping friends and not making enemies at court But you quarrel with the queen because she wanted peace and you wanted war War There is a war with Spain And such a silly frightened womanish war as only a woman would wage Let me answer that You are not forthright with yourself You wish to complete your record as general crush Spain make a name like Caesars and climb to fame You won Cdiz and caught the peoples hearts Caught their voices until the streets ring with your name when you pass Take care You are too popular already My lord you are loved better than the queen Thats your danger She will not suffer a subject to eclipse her she

taught a king a noble may teach a queen You talk treason and death The old order is dead Your house will die if you cannot learn This is Elizabeth we deal with Whats a king but a man a queen but a woman Theres one man she fears and that mans yourself And she has good reason to fear you To fear me Why m loyal Youre a man not easily governed moreover a general popular and acclaimed And last she loves you which makes you more to be feared whether you love her or not Love her most certainly do love her My lord a man as young as yourself lf she were my mothers kitchen hag toothless and wooden leg shed still make the others colorless Shes a witch Shes got a witchs brain love her hate her adore her That side of it you must know for yourself But my lord permit me to caution you Dont count too much on the loves of queens Thanks Schoolmaster Bacon for that sound lecture and the sound advice Which you probably will not take Which probably will not Whats the shortest road to London Up the hill

woman in love with a man much younger than herself Are you mad Pen Shell beat you or send you to the tower Come live with me And be my love Enjoy with me The pleasures here above That hills and valleys Dales and fields And all the wooded mountains yield If could be As young and fair as you Believe what every shepherd Said was true These pretty speeches Might me move To live with you And be your love And will make your bed of roses In lovers vows there is but little truth And of a thousand fragrant posies And love cannot endure without its youth cap of flowers and a kirtle The flowers fade When summertime is ended Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle Our love is dead love we thought so splendid If these delights Your mind may move Then live with me And be my love But were young And loved so well Then might hold you close forever So you brazen wench you defy me You dare hold your queen up to ridicule You forward hussy You who can keep neither your eyes nor your nose or your person where they belong Look at you Because a gentleman once glanced at you doesnt entitle you to come into my presence dressed like an indecent hedge drab Take it off you shameless baggage Get out of my sight You too Do you stand around like a herd of stupid cattle while am treated so You too think am too old too ugly for a man to look upon with love Take them down Do you hear me Smash them

a right to be With Baganolds forces in Ireland isnt he You want him home again suppose Oh more than anything in the world He shall be recalled dont know how to thank Your Majesty But its doubtful if hell come shall command it And when he takes you in his arms again thank heaven youre not a queen But thought to be a queen To be a queen is to be less than human To put pride before desire to search mens hearts for tenderness and find only ambition to cry out in the dark for one unselfish voice and hear only the dry rustle of papers of state To turn to ones beloved with stars for eyes and have him see behind them only the shadow of the executioners block queen has no hour for love Time presses events crowd upon her And for a shell an empty glittering husk she must give up all that a woman holds most dear And now fetch me Master Francis Bacon Master Bacon At once Yes Your Majesty Will your steps always be so laggard when send for you Master Bacon My steps have lost the habit of being summoned by you And your tongue has lost none of its sharpness see To bed and hopeful dreams Youre a friend of my Lord Essex arent you am whatever Your Grace desires And your own interest dictates

dearer She loves you But being a woman she has her pride Her pride Look theres no mystery to handling women Theyre like this lady here You starve them a little to make them keen Starve them too long they turn and rend you ll look to myself Better look to England Baganolds been defeated in Ireland Whats that Baganold defeated Killed and his army destroyed That is the reason Her Majesty commands

lord or your own Havent you built your name high enough In spite of your blunder at Cdiz theres no name like yours in England If we were to ride in the streets its Essex theyd cheer not me Is it for this that you hold me back from a raid on Spain It is because believe in peace and have no faith in what wars bring The truth is you fear me fear what might become do fear you because youre flattered by the praise of fools until you think youd make a better king than a queen You think youd rule England better because youre a man do indeed Thats exactly where you fail You cant think and act like a man ll make you sorry for those words Think like you is what you mean And why should when my thinkings wiser What is your plan To take over England To depose me Fiery wench arent you Its me bringing

such asked you not to be angry Not angry When you think cant outflank such numskulls as Raleigh and his clique Very well Go if you like Only love you and say what would be wisest The things love in you most your honesty your reckless pride are the very things they would play upon sweet All ask of you is be careful Surely you can do so little for one who loves you so well Will you promise Promise

present taxes or a series of additional taxes Kendrick will not endure it Milords let us leave this question Any further business before us There is one perpetual subject Your Majesty which we take up time after time and always leave unsettled Tyrones rebellion in Ulster Its no longer a smoldering coal Its a running fire spreading north to south Which means Men Money Ships And more than that a

Essex is master of the ordnance need him here Who else Sir Walter told me before the meeting that hed go if Your Majesty wished But we both believe Essex should go with him In what capacity Leading an equal command Two generals landing north and south meeting to crush Tyrone Youd have two lord protectors in Ireland It was our thought to name Raleigh lord protector And under him Since your Cdiz adventure ended so lamely Raleigh should have first place in this My Thats an insult speak for the good of the state You never spoke for any cause but your own Stop this instantly Whoever makes you angry has won already Essex Youd make me swallow insults from this bookkeeper who never waved anything more dangerous than a quill Well were you not wrong at Cdiz Thats not for you to say And if go to Ireland ll go alone Will you ll have something to say about that Dont you see what theyre trying to do see what Cecil and his friends are plainly enough Yellow rats who only show their teeth when cornered Essex Who bow and smile and scrape and spend their nights gnawing the chairs and floors out from under us all Madam this is fantastic Lf were to discuss Do what you wish about Ireland wash my hands of it That we dont doubt Its a difficult dangerous job so how can we blame Lord Essex for refusing to risk it You challenge me to go Give me the men need Put me in command If fail to crush Tyrone take my sword ll never use it again Oh you fool Theyve challenged me It doesnt matter You must not go Dont you see Of course see know that once ve gone theyll try to strip me here at home And

council saw them draw you into this and tried to warn you but it was no use Why not win in Ireland No man wins there Irelands been fatal to every commander who risked his fortune there Even the cleverest of soldiers would find it difficult But youre so dazzled to command an army that youd follow the devil in an assault on heaven Thats one thing the devil doesnt know Heavens always taken by

bring it to him and hed forgive me And once long after when hed forgotten and was angry it saved my life Darling if youre ever angry rings wont help Yes this one would d think of you as you are now and it would ll take it to remember you in absence No Take it for a better reason Take it because the years are long and full of sharp wearing days that change us into people we do not know lest you

food and precious little you had and supplies is warming the hearts of Ireland The roads tore up Your guides came back to me My guides Theyre my men Glad to lend them to you Me whole armys drawn up betwixt you and the sea In short Lord Essex youre trapped Now maybe you understand what meant by submission ll not do it while have an army ll fight Without food or munitions Youd only get yourselves butchered or drowned Throw down your arms and save your lives the whilst you can If m trapped why do you spare us Am a fool to believe that if destroyed you d destroy England If we fought it out now d

Ltll be your pride against the life of every one of your men Come now Essex What do you say Will you not disarm Between you here and betrayal at Whitehall it seems ve no choice Then heres me hand on it and a message to the queen thanking her for victory for youre the most dangerous foe ve had to face If shed given you the support your campaign deserved without the word of a lie man it would be me and not you that would be surrendering this day ll give her your message with my whole army The mob does nothing but cry the name of Essex It was your intellect that got us into this We are grateful Dont be a fool How did know that Essex would rise and revolt thought hed be killed Instead he lands in Wales rearms his men and even now marches through London on the palace That means were in grave

something else something within myself Something cant explain If you had shown anger could have spoken easily Its not easy now Perhaps you have no need to tell me Loving you so well know you better than yourself This thing Isnt it ambition a thirst for power Yes thats stronger than myself And deeper than love Its true The thrones yours by descent and possession but if this had been a freer time if people could elect d have swept the country Since were equal in love why cant we be equal in power as well But we are equal have made you so No Its still all yours to grant me or take away as you see fit Can it be otherwise ask you this in all devotion Am not as worthy to be king as you to be queen Must you rule alone Darling Youre so young in policy If granted you this do you know what people would say That you had forced it on me by revolution and all the security and safety which have built for them through years of planning would be blown away Is that your reason or is it that you wouldnt trust me as king No would not trust you No Youre jealous of your rights your throne Yes So the courts in my hands the country mine you my prisoner must disband my army give your kingdom back

thinking himself forgotten turned against you but it wasnt his fault He didnt know It was mine You tell me this because you want to save him Yes yes do But also its true You must believe me Send for him If it is true do you realize youve spoken your own death warrant Yes know but it doesnt matter Nothing nothing matters but him Penelope come closer You love him greatly dont you Oh yes Your Majesty too but he has never loved me But he does love you was jealous of you Thats why Jealous You poor child Because he loved you and me not at all He told me so What did he say He said love her more than life And then warned him against you but he laughed and went in to you Perhaps should have trusted him more but its too late now No one dies happily queen or no Will he send me the ring do you think There is still time No not now This is the end On no no You must send for him Hes as proud as you are Hell say nothing You must send for him Bring him here No shall live and he shall die Oh shall walk about and give orders for a horrible while But even though my heart goes into his grave along with him will never send for him He must ask to come to me He will ask He will told you He has sent someone to plead Enter By your leave Your Grace Well All Londons outside the tower protesting the execution Havent ears Cant hear them What of it The captain of the guard begs permission to use force to scatter them So thats what you came to see me about thought you brought word Milord of Essex would hardly condescend to plead through me Your Majesty And for an excellent reason He could never be sure of the form in which youd deliver it This is your day Cecil The snake in the grass endures Yes the snakes mind is best To the end of time it will be so The snakes and the rats they shall flourish and those who are noble and free of soul go down But madam if youll pardon me the crowd is dangerous Lf may order the guard You may not But will give you a task less to your liking Go to my Lord of Essex in his cell and send him here Well are you struck dumb But Your Grace Lord Essex is preparing for execution Even now a priest Go tell you Oh Your Majesty Penelope Iook on my face What you see here he will also see Oh but Your Majesty youre tired and worn and your beauty Has gone and left a bitter aging mask need no mirror to tell me now And you are young and lovely still And he too is young and beautiful And if he looks at you and then at me Penelope do you mind You must not be here when he comes You sent for me Yes You spoil me for death Wouldnt it have been kinder to have left me with my thoughts Are you so set on dying cant say care for it but if its to come why then its best go forward quickly You must have known never meant you to die ve been found guilty of treason Treason is punishable with death Robert Be kind to me just this once am proud too and bitter with much cause but did speak first sent for you Are you going to degrade me further make me tell you how have longed for you You can tell me that because youve nothing to gain or lose by it But if were to tell you that love you you might suppose d do it to save my life You love me still No you have never loved me loved you And that was your nearest way to power This is the hour for truth so let me speak am older than you but a queen so perhaps it was natural that you should flatter me and believe you Why yes yes Thats true if you wish And now may go This dying sticks in my mind and makes me poor company But remember this did love you And still do Yes Then why didnt you send me the ring d have forgiven you everything at any hour of the day or night waited thinking of course it would come And the nights went by somehow like the days and it never came And here it is the last morning the last quarterhour Even if believed you couldnt have sent it Why not Because if d tried to hold you to your promise and youd broken it d have died more unhappy than am But d have kept my promise d keep it now If were to offer you this ring now youd pardon me love me as before Oh yes Everything as before And what would happen to your throne My throne Why nothing Now there youre wrong for d try to take it from you played for power once and lost but if Listen Do you hear that Elizabeth The people are all with me And if had another chance d win Why do you tell me this Dont you know it means My death Yes know only tell you because ve loved you love you still can never accept pardon from you without you knowing the truth and facing it So its best leave Robert you cant You cant go like this wont let you love you Then are you ready to give up your throne No no no cannot And you talk of love love that clings to a tinsel throne Robert wait Listen do love you ll always love you till life is drained from me no matter how long and lonely the after years may be But there is another love greater even than that have for you Whats this greater love that lets the lesser go to its death England That is my greatest and most enduring love And when think what you would do to my country if you were king will see you dead yes and your soul condemned to eternity forever before d let you do it You think dont love England You do But your love does not match your lust for power For the greater glory of Essex you would make war upon the world drag your country down and drown her in a sea of debts and blood had hoped in prison you would lose conceit of yourself a little for prisons very quiet Be content to reign with me so we could leave behind us a legacy to our people of peace and happiness But no You stayed crazed with ambition and faithless to England as well as to me to the end Perhaps youre right and d have made a sorry king So then its better this way But this d have you know If things had been different you simply a woman not a queen and a man with no crown between us we couldve searched heaven and earth for two perfect lovers and ended the search with ourselves Of all the things on this earth that m now to leave care about leaving none of them but you Robert Stay with me Share with me Give me the ring Give me the ring No For if did d be your death or youd be mine and you and England must live Isnt that true Yes So then goodbye my love No m old m old With you couldve been young again Why cant you love me enough to give me your love and keep me as was dont know only know cannot Robert take my throne Take England Its yours You may loosen my hands m ready
