Doctor why wasnt l informed about the maneuvers outside the perimeter Because it was part of research Anything that takes place outside on this island is a security matter that concerns me Captain l didnt want to trouble you l knew how you would feel about testing Testing Yes Our subject engaged live targets You mean you tested him on my men One unarmed genetically modified soldier eliminated ten heavyarmed men This is um This is way beyond anything the command would authorize Captain theyre not even your men Theyre Chernovs people All of those genetically modified soldiers or whatever you want to call those creatures were all once human Yes thats right Now if you would excuse me l have to finish my painting Chernov is he back in his holding pen Yes The timereleased tranquilizer worked

killer instinct for a soldier Yeah well maybe hell send you out there next time Dont you think its a little farfetched genetically modified soldiers lve got it from a good source Nice You know it looks like something from your sasquatch file Very funny lts a surveillance photo taken outside Kriegers research facility l dont need to tell you how much trouble you can get into snooping around military affairs do l Thats just the thing All my usual sources say theres no This is from another source Gorgeous shot of a lumber mill Who are these guys Okay so maybe its super covert Thats all the

can control him but l have to work on his What good is that a weapon that we cant control You can use him under certain circumstances for Thats not what we commissioned from you doctor You asked me to create an invincible soldier Thats what lm presenting to you today Basically bulletproof no need for sleep and he can fight harder and longer than any human soldier soldier Youre making brainless
