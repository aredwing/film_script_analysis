slammin into them rocks Get away from there you goddamn fool Whats the matter with you You want to swamp us you crazy son of a bitch What are these guys doin out here What are they doin back there Theyre chummin right now What is that Theyre tracking the shark now divided four ways is what Lets show Mr Hooper our accident Victim identified as Christine Watkins female Caucasian And heres the way we have it Probable boating accident The height and weight of the victim can only be estimated from the partial remains The torso has been severed in midthorax There are no major organs remaining May have a glass of water The right arm has been severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss in the upper musculature Thank you very much Partially denuded bone remaining This was no boat accident Did you notify the Coast Guard about this No It was only local jurisdiction The left arm head the shoulders sternum and portions of the rib cage are intact Do not smoke in here Thank you very much This is what happens Indicates the nonfrenzy feeding of a large squalus possibly longimanus or isurus glaucus The amount of tissue loss prevents any detailed analysis however the attacking squalus must be larger than any normal squalus found in these waters Didnt you get a boat and check these waters This is not a boat accident And it wasnt any propeller It wasnt any coral reef And it wasnt Jack the Ripper It was a shark wanna go and wanna get on the state wire services See if Bostonll pick it up and go national Call Dave Axelrod in New York and tell him he owes me a favor This is the shot want with everybody and the fish in it Guys could we please get organized want to get a picture for the paper Ben Gardner get this No no We caught it Thats swell Its a beauty eh need a picture for the paper Clear out of the way please Just the guys that caught the fish Open it up a little bit want to get a picture of the guy with the fish need a picture for the paper Could we get the sign

throat Frank Yeah but what kind What kind of shark Tiger shark what We can start breathing again Is Ben getting plenty of pictures You bet he is What is this bite radius crap You stuff your friggin head in there man and find out if its a maneater All m saying is that it may not be the shark want you to meet Matt This is Larry Vaughn our Mayor Matts from the Oceanographic Institute Nice to meet you There are all kinds of sharks in the waters Hammerheads white tips blues makos And the chances that these bozos got the exact shark There are no other sharks like this here Its to m not saying that this is not the shark It probably is Martin Its a maneater Its extremely rare for these waters The fact is the bite radius on this animal is different than the wounds on the victim want to be sure You want to be sure We all want to be sure Okay What want to do is very simple The digestive system of this animal is very very slow Lets cut it open Whatever its eaten in the last hours is bound to still be in there And then well be sure It may be the only way to confirm it Look fellas lets be reasonable This is not the time or the place to perform some kind of a halfassed autopsy on a fish am not going to stand here and see that thing cut open and see that little Kintner boy spill out all over the dock just found out that a girl got killed here last week And you knew it You knew there was a shark out there You knew it was dangerous But you let people go swimming anyway You knew all those things but still my boy is dead now And theres nothing you can do about it My boy is dead wanted you to know that m sorry Martin Shes wrong No shes not All right fellas lets cut this ugly son of a bitch down before it stinks up the island Harve you and Carl take it out tomorrow and dump it in the drink Come here Give us a kiss Why Because need it Get out of here The door was open Mind if come in m Matt Hooper Oh hi Ellen Brody Your husbands home d really like to talk to him Yes so would Can get you some coffee Wine How nice How was your day Swell got red and white didnt know what youd be serving Thats nice Is anyone eating this My husband tells me youre in sharks Excuse me Yes ve never heard it quite put that way But yes am love sharks You love sharks Yeah love them When was years old my father got me a boat and went fishing off of Cape Cod hooked a scup and as was reeling it in hooked a four and a half foot baby thresher shark who proceeded to eat my boat He ate my oar hooks and my seat cushions He turned an inboard into an outboard Scared me to death and swam back to shore When was on the beach turned around and saw my boat being taken apart Ever since then have been studying sharks and thats why m gonna go to the Institute tomorrow and tell them that you still have a shark problem here Why do you have to tell them that m sorry thought that You told me the shark was caught heard it on the news heard it on the Cape station They caught a shark not the shark Not the shark that killed Chrissy Watkins And probably not the shark that killed the little boy Which wanted to prove by cutting the shark open You may want to let that breathe Nothing Youll be the only rational man left on this island after leave tomorrow Where are you going am going on the Aurora The Aurora What is that Its a floating asylum for shark addicts Pure research Eighteen months at sea Martin hates boats Martin hates water Martin sits in his car when we go on the ferry to the mainland guess its a childhood thing Theres a clinical name for it isnt there Drowning Is it true that most people get attacked by sharks in three feet of water about feet from the beach And before people started to swim for recreation mean before sharks knew what they were missing that a lot of these attacks werent reported Thats right Now this shark that swims alone whats it called Rogue Rogue yeah Now this guy he keeps swimmin around in a place where the feeding is good until the food supply is gone Right Thats called territoriality Its just a theory that happen to agree with Then why dont we have one more drink and go down and cut that shark open Can you do that can do anything m the Chief of Police We start in the alimentary canal open the digestive tract Just like thought What Came up from the Gulf Stream from southern waters He didnt eat a car did he Tiger sharks like a garbage can Itll eat anything Somebody probably threw that in the river Thats it ve got to close the beach call the Mayor You got a bigger problem than that You still got a hell of a fish out there with a mouth about this big How do we confirm that by morning If he is a rogue and theres any truth to territoriality at all we could spot him between Cape Scott and South Beach Wherere you going To find him Hes a night feeder On the water Were not gonna find him on the land m not drunk enough to go on a boat Yes you are No m not cant do that Yes you can m tellin you the crime rate in New Yorkll kill ya Theres so many problems you never feel like youre accomplishing anything Violence ripoffs muggings The kids cant leave the house Youve got to walk them to school But in Amity one man can make a difference In years theres never been a shooting or a murder in this town No kidding Want a pretzel Where are we Were right in the stretch where hes been feeding Can you get the Late Show on this thing No its a closed circuit system have underwater cameras fore and aft Who pays for all this stuff The Government The Institute This stuff cost a lot of money paid for this mostly myself actually Youre kidding You rich Yeah How much Personally or the whole family Doesnt make any sense They pay a guy like you to watch sharks It doesnt make sense for a guy who hates the water to live on an island either Its only an island if you look at it from the water That makes a lot of sense What is that thing doing Its a fish finder Its probably just a school of mackerel or something all clumped together Wait a minute Theres somethin else out there What is it About yards south southwest Thats Ben Gardners boat You know him Its all banged up Sure know him Hes a fisherman What happened got to go down there and check their hull Wait Why dont we just tow it in We will just got to check something out Keep the lights going Lets tow it in Dont worry Martin Nothings gonna happen What am supposed to do while youre gone Nothing Absolutely nothing Dont touch any of the equipment ll be back in two minutes This is a great white big one Any shark expert in the world will tell you its a killer Its a maneater great white shark has staked a claim in the waters off Amity Island Hell continue to feed here as long as theres food in the water Theres no limit to what hell do Weve had three incidents Two people killed in a week Itll happen again It happened before the Jersey beach Five people were killed In one week Tell him about the swimmers shark is attracted to the exact kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever people swim You cant avoid it If you open the beaches on the Fourth of July its like ringing the dinner bell for Christ sakes pulled a tooth the size of a shot glass out of a boat out there It was the tooth of a great white It was Gardners boat all chewed up helped tow it You shouldve seen it Where is that tooth Did you see it Brody didnt see it He dropped it on the way in had an accident And what did you say the name of this shark is Its a carcharodon carcharias Its a great white You dont have the tooth We depend on the summer people for our lives You are not gonna have a summer unless you deal with this problem We have to close the beaches and hire somebody to kill the shark We have to tell the Coast Guard Youll have to contact the Shark Research Panel Youll have to ring this entire harbor dont think either one of you are familiar with our problems know that you are going to ignore this problem until it swims up and bites you on the ass Wait a second There are two ways to deal with this Youre either gonna kill this animal or cut off its food supply We have to close the beaches Sick vandalism That is a deliberate mutilation of a public service message want those little painthappy bastards caught and hung up by their BusterBrowns Thats it Goodbye wont waste my time arguing with a man whos lining up to be a hot lunch Dont do this What we are dealing with here is a perfect engine an eating machine Its really a miracle of evolution All this machine does is swim and eat and make little sharks And thats all Now why dont you take a long close look at this sign Those proportions are correct Youd love to prove that Get your name into the National Geographic Larry if we make an effort today we might be able to save August August For Christ sake tomorrows the Fourth of July And we will be open for business This will be the best summer weve ever had If you are concerned about the beaches do what you have to to make them safe But those beaches will be open for this weekend want to know how many men youre going to send dont need to come to Brisbane when have a great white shark right here We need men to patrol the swimming area Weve got to have help

tail Well we didnt know Because our bomb mission had been so secret no distress signal had been sent They didnt even list us overdue for a week Very first light sharks come cruisin so we formed ourselves into tight groups Kinda like old squares in a battle like you see on a calendar like the Battle of Waterloo The idea was the shark comes to the nearest man and he starts poundin hollerin and screamin Sometimes the shark would go away but sometimes he wouldnt go away Sometimes that shark he looks right into you right into your eyes You know a thing about a shark hes got lifeless eyes Black eyes like a dolls eyes When he comes at you he doesnt seem to be livin until he bites you Those little black eyes roll over white and then then you hear that terrible highpitched screamin The ocean turns red in spite of the poundin and the hollerin they all come in They rip you to pieces You know by the end of that first dawn we lost men dont know how many sharks Maybe dont know how many men they averaged six an hour On Thursday mornin bumped into a friend of mine Herbie Robinson from Cleveland Baseball player Bosuns mate thought he was asleep Reached over to wake him up He bobbed up and down in the water just like a kind of top Upended Hed been bitten in half below the waist Noon the fifth day a Lockheed Ventura saw us He swung in low and he saw us He was a young pilot Younger than
