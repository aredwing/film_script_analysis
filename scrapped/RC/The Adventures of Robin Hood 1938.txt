full of jewels and silks and more about golden marks wrested from the northern shires You wouldnt dare Sit down Some of you might think our host intended this treasure for the coffers of Prince John

Just simple villagers who never harmed a soul And now Tortured eyes put out tongues slit ears hacked off They come to me for protection against your Norman friends But youve taken Norman lives Yes those that deserved it The cruel and unjust Youre a strange man Strange Because can feel for beaten helpless people No youre strange because you want to do something about it Youre willing to defy Sir Guy even Prince John himself To risk your own life And one of those men was a Norman Norman or Saxon Whats that matter Its injustice hate not the Normans But its lost you your rank your lands Its made you a hunted outlaw when you might have lived in comfort and security Whats your reward for all this Reward You just dont understand do you m sorry do begin to see a little now If you do then thats

escort her the rest of the way Oh master may go too With your permission my lady Goodbye my lady Goodbye He took everything you collected Every silver penny And you two nincompoops sat there and let him do it Oh we resisted as well as we could Where are your wounds Your bruises And where are your men What did Your Highness expect With the Lady Marian in our company and Locksleys men outnumbering us And not an arrow wound to divide among them suppose And more than marks in the hands of that wolfs head That fellows got to be taken Understand And how does Your Highness suggest that he be taken If may be so bold as to inquire Mind your words Gisbourne Youre fortunate not to be paying for this with your head Your Highness sir could muster an army and surround Sherwood You couldnt capture him Mind your words if he sat in your lap shooting arrows at a crow Arrows Arrows He said shooting arrows at a crow Take that silly looking bonnet off That stirs something in my mind Perhaps we cant take him by force Hes too well protected Knows Sherwoods hidden paths well But But what Well outwit him Well hold an archery tournament Archery tour And have him fly in on the end of one of his own arrows Thats marvelous Hes the finest archer in the North Think hed forgo shooting against the archers of all England Well give a prize Say a golden arrow And ask him to risk his neck for that That wont be the only bait with the Lady Marian presenting the arrow herself What do you mean When they came out of the forest she seemed very friendly And didnt you notice how his eyes never left her Yes yes noticed Well then Well then how do we get word to him Get word to Robin who has an eye in every bush and ears in every wall But even if he comes wont he be disguised Whether he be dressed as priest beggar knight palmer what disguise can conceal the finest archer in England The man who wins the golden arrow will be Robin Hood Will you take that bonnet off hope our little golden hook will catch the fish You hope Oh it will if hes here If hes not well stick your head upon the target and shoot at that Are your men sure of their orders Yes Theyre stationed all around the field Even a worm couldnt get through You talk as if this were a trap No my dear Just a precaution in case the Saxons create a disturbance By orders of His Highness Prince John the champions of Sir Guy and the knights will be limited to three flights of arrows for the eliminations The winning team will meet all comers You know its a trap golden arrow from the lady herself Theyve cooked this up to take you Well what of it You know whatll happen if they do Wheres your sporting blood Sir Guy accepted our invitation Wed be rude not to accept his Itd be ruder to get your neck stretched There my band getting fat and overfed Wheres your love of fights risk adventure Since our friend seems to have gone a little mad ll have to see him through Well have to see him through Prepare final flight Does my lady find it interesting Lady Marian Oh m sorry asked if you found it interesting Yes very Theyre splendid archers Youll find it much more interesting later on The winning team will compete as individuals Captain Phillip of Arras Elwyn the Welshman Matt of Sleaford They now challenge all comers The men whod shoot against that lot have to have the eyes of a falcon Theyre far too good for me m not shooting today Remaining archers will use center target Matt of Sleaford out Elwyn the Welshman out Ah The tall tinker Now is the time Not so hasty Sir Guy m enjoying myself Let them finish the match But he could Have your men close in if you wish Look Yeah theyre closing in hope Robin sees them must commend Your Highness for the subtlety of your scheme Very good Would you say youd seen that tall fellow before And if had what interest could a tinker have for me Phillip of Arras shoots next Tie You will be allowed another flight Targets a deal too close Can we have it removed to a fit distance to shoot at Another paces If your archer captain wins at that distance ll give you gold marks for him Win or lose ll give him to Your Highness for a favor Provided you let me deal with this wolfs head in my own way Done m leaving for Norwich right after the tournament anyway so you may do what you please with him Why he cant win now No living man could beat that shot ll wager marks on Phillip of Arras He split Phillips arrow The tinker wins He wins What is your name archer Godfrey of Sherwood Your Highness How is it that a tinker learned so well the use of arms Even a peaceful tinker must protect himself these days from treachery and other things Its earned you more than you bargained for today pronounce you champion archer of England From the gracious hand of Lady Marian Fitzwalter youll receive your reward Advance Here is your prize sir archer Its indeed an honor to receive it from the hands of so beautiful a lady How is it you didnt use a black arrow Thats my court of last resort Sir Guy Its verdict is always final Arrest this man Thats a good idea Youre a very rash young man And m sorry cant be in Nottingham to see what Gisbourne has in store for you Itll be something special m sure m sure Sorry underestimated you Next time perhaps Therell be no next time Take him away Robin of Locksley Known to some as the outlaw Robin Hood After trial in which you did not produce one witness in your behalf youve been found guilty of outlawry murder abduction false pretenses contempt of the Crown poaching in forests and high treason Havent you forgotten a count or two Surely its a crime under the noble Prince John to love ones country To protect serfs from injustice and be loyal to ones king If could add anything to the charges against you would most gladly do so It is the sentence of this tribunal on the morrow at high noon you be taken to the square in Nottingham and there hanged by the neck until you are dead There may be some who will regret that a man of your peculiar talents should be cut off so early in life But You think the sentence extremely lenient Thank you Whats troubling you my lady Is it the outlaw Yes hate to see a human being trapped Bess you

time that what you were doing was right and that we were wrong No let me finish You taught me England is bigger than Normans and Saxons fighting and hating each other That it belongs to all of us to live peacefully together loyal only to Richard and to England But darling you could help could help much more by watching for treachery here and leaving you free to protect Richards people until he returns Now do you see why you have to go back to your men alone Go now quickly dearest Goodbye darling Goodbye Goodbye my love Goodbye You gentlemen have traveled far Yes quite a distance m sorry

enough to deserve your interest Landlord wheres our ale Coming sirs Will you gentlemen be remaining here tonight We hadnt decided Your Grace What would you advise Well theres so much danger on the road youd be far safer here We will then since well have the added pleasure of your company should like to stay but recollected some urgent affairs at my abbey Some other time or perhaps you would break your journey and sup with me tomorrow Your Grace is too kind Then bid you good evening gentlemen and God speed you in the morning Thank you Good night The window Are there beds prepared landlord Lets to sleep then m tired m afraid he suspects sire fear so His Grace is a Norman Did you see the fear on the landlords face when he came in ve seen it in the faces of thousands since we returned ought never to have left England noticed when Robin Hoods name is mentioned The mysterious outlaw whom we have sought In vain However the bishop didnt have any difficulty meeting him Which gives me an idea And youre sure it was Richard No doubt of it How like my dear brother this is He couldnt rot in Durnstein like any decent man But Richard has no army No Your Highness If he had we should have heard of it If my brother were to be killed England would have a new king That would be murder ll have no part Youll do as youre told Thats very simple Keep your mouth closed Your Highness beg of you How long will you retain your abbey if Richard survives to find out what youve been up to these years hes been away Go on Gisbourne Whos to Dickon was a knight before your brother hacked off his spurs over some little mischance Theres nothing he wouldnt do for a king whod restore him to rank You dont love my brother hear have little reason to Your Highness You know this tavern Yes If Richard dies Dickon returns to the roll of English knights Am not right With the manor and estate of Robin of Locksley to support his rank When shall start Now How many men will you need shall do it better alone Your Highness The sooner youre crowned king The better for my friends Youre a clever fellow Gisbourne Thank you Your Majesty Return to your abbey and make preparations to proclaim me king here in Nottingham the day after tomorrow Do you suppose she heard dont know Now you know why Robins got to find King Richard at once and warn him Take this note to Much at Saracens Head My ladys hearing is a little defective tonight When you knock at a ladys door as if it were a tavern you deserve to wait You seem upset Upset Why should be Oh come now my dear Lady Marian Youve played the innocent long enough Lets be frank with one another dont see the need Youre charming but not exactly clever You couldnt have failed to overhear what Prince John and were talking about Oh no no no Please dont trouble to deny it And your first thought as Richards loyal ward was to warn him Am not right Why how could warn Richard How did Locksley and his men arrange his escape from hanging after the archery match Someone here in the castle must have got word to him Thats ridiculous When Richards in danger what more natural than that you should try to warn him through Locksley And you do intend to warn him dont you Dont you No If thats true perhaps youd explain before Prince John and the Court of Execution the meaning of this Guard Escort my Lady Marian to the Great Hall Not only has she consorted
