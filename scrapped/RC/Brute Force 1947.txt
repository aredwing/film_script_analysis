morning boys Morning sir Oh good morning Gallagher Morning Captain understand youre responsible for settling that little feud over in cell block We appreciate your assistance of course but The boys and were only trying to help You and your boys Theres a very old bylaw in this institution about gangs or cliques We dont like them We dont want them Why dont you break them up Captain Gallagher when are you gonna remember that youre not back home running a gang of hoodlums Let me be the policeman eh You just serve your time And that way well both get paid off Thats right Captain Like the Book says we always get whats coming to us All of us Oh excuse me sir Whats the matter with you Wasnt his fault Sorry Lister Ah the wardens breakfast ready and made With the ham and eggs and the marmalade Sounds like a very important meeting youre going to this morning Doc Is uh Captain Munsey gonna be there Mmhmm Mmhmm Brandys the very best drink in the world If you drink enough your toes get curled Calypso statistics show that if the level of alcohol in the blood exceeds one half of one percent the blood pressure is affected a cerebral condition occurs and then youre cockeyed And maybe thats the way it should be You dont like this place Doc What for you stay here You havent got much choice Calypso Neither have But its not as easy as all that Mr McCallum This prison This prison has almost twice as many men as it was built to accommodate Theres not enough work to keep the inmates occupied Why not The world we live in Yes we can give them real work teach them trades produce things But the civilian manufacturer says were competing with him Trade unions say were putting their people out of work Nobody wants to help Not us Manufacturers unions You might as well blame the weather What youre really saying is you cant handle the situation Excuse me sir dont think you quite understood what the warden meant Its not only a matter of controlling the men He wants to help them Munsey what this prison needs is absolute discipline not charity Your loyalty to the warden doesnt change the fact that he may be getting too old for his job Age Mr McCallum is a matter of arteries not years Its a pity Walters youre a better philosopher than you are a doctor But m getting tired of you in both roles was sent here today for one reason to tell you that if theres any more trouble if this prison isnt brought under the strictest control Mr McCallum There will be an immediate change in practically all personnel We dont want to be bothered anymore Is that clear Warden Yes sir Clear to you Doctor Oh absolutely You cant be bothered Well that simplifies everything The great public and its servants You put up prisons thick walls and then your job is over finished But is it over You and your patent medicine remedies Change the warden New personnel Absolute discipline Do you know what this prison is Mr McCallum One big human bomb And you say kick it and itll be quiet Smash it and it wont explode Munsey what do you think of the doctors viewpoint think sir that on occasion the doctor becomes unduly alarmed Warden Uh dont dont know do Like so many dreamers and drunkards the doctors emotional words are empty Whats your solution All know is that when people are sick you dont cure them by making them sicker By your methods we send the man back to society a worse criminal than he was when they sent him to us Platitudes Doctor m waiting for your solution For men like you Mr McCallum there will never be any solution Wait a minute Walters Not while you wanna destroy instead of build What we need here is a little more patience and much more understanding Weve been patient too long And as for understanding m positive the purpose of my visit cannot be misunderstood Youll remain here Warden only as long as theres no further trouble Good day Doctor ll see you to the gate sir ve been warden here for such a long time wouldnt know where to go what to do The place looks so

wanna see For example the last couple of days now shes had me thinking about Flossie never told you gentlemen about Flossie did To me shes all the women ever knew and a few hope havent met yet ran into Flossie one night in Eddies Place in Miami had just sold a trusting gentleman a few shares in a radium mine and was trying to parlay my luck had only met Flossie that afternoon but we were already very good friends The dice were hot and she kept them that way was heading for a fortune Suddenly just when everything was sunshine and roses heard the old familiar noises Leave it to the police to break up a wonderful evening It looked as though everybody was caught with their chips down The raid didnt worry me but the gun was carrying was a problem So Flossie had me slip the gun into her purse She was not only beautiful she knew the score as well Furthermore she knew precisely how to guide me through a back exit Obviously the girl was no tourist My car was waiting there just as pretty as you please And with my money and my gun still safe off we drove Driving along with such a dream doll beside me figured myself a pretty lucky guy Flossie had looks brains and all the accessories She was better than a deck with six aces But regret to report that she also knew how to handle a gun my gun Before had only suspected that she was talented Now was positive didnt do much talking because for once in my life couldnt find the right words She wanted all the money had won and never refuse a lady especially when shes armed Accordingly stepped out of the automobile without any arguments whatsoever And that gentlemen was the last ever saw of my car my cash or my Flossie wonder who Flossies fleecing now dont get it Why would a guy want to hang on to a memory like that Who knows guess when youre on the inside even the phony things on the outside seem wonderful Just so they happened on the outside All right Go ahead Joe hows the boy Hello Johnny Regan Its me Collins

Warden Men m going to try to talk some sense to you m gonna lay it right on the line There has been in recent weeks a mounting unrest in this prison Dont think for one minute that dont know about it Up to now youve enjoyed the regulation privileges However if you persist in fighting among yourselves antagonizing the guards and making way for accidents like the one that happened in the machine shop this morning then all your privileges will be revoked at once Be careful of your associates Always remember that one bad prisoner can spoil things for the rest of you So watch your step Its up to you to protect your own interests as am compelled to protect mine If theres one more infraction of the rules if you cannot conduct yourselves without creating a disturbance without further accidents then shall have to use every means to keep you under control So thats it men Meet me halfway and you can depend on me to see that every prisoner is treated fairly Cell Convict McLain of cell buried

Spencer talk Weve talked too much already There are ears all over this drum and they all belong to one guy Whats the answer to it Are we going to have to keep every prisoner in ritual solitary Other prisons must have these same problems but they clear them up keep things running smoothly Weve been through difficult times before Warden Oh never like this And McCallum is coming tomorrow Why Why cant he let me alone Everythings gone wrong dont know whos to blame but do know that every prisoner hates us Not us Me Its me they hate wonder why You put on a guards uniform and see how much they love you You talk to the prisoners over a loudspeaker talk to them with a club You only make the rules have to enforce them Maybe its the way you enforce them Maybe it is Oh m not criticizing Munsey Its just that But you are And perhaps youre right All know is that ve tried to do my job as saw it But if m the cause of this trouble if m wrong and those convicts are right then you can have my resignation immediately No Munsey Thats just what the inmates would like No no Thats not the answer As you said weve been through some difficult times together here Well were still here and were still together Lets uh leave it that way hmm Well the situation seems to call for a drink Warden Thanks uh m going to turn in Good night Dont be discouraged Warden Its a rule in all the best stories Everybody always lives happily ever after Good night You dont believe meant what said about resigning do you Doctor In a million words no Youre wrong really want to help the warden Its just that hes confused He doesnt know that kindness is actually weakness And weakness is an infection that makes a man a follower instead of a leader Seems too me a very great leader once said the meek shall inherit the earth Science contradicts that Doctor Nature proves that the weak must die so that the strong may live Authority cleverness imagination Those are the real differences between men walk amongst these convicts these thieves and murderers alone unarmed But they respect me They obey me Fits you doesnt it Hmm The wardens chair It fits you Youre drunk Why not m a very ordinary man get drunk on whiskey What makes you drunk Power You flatter me Doctor m just a policeman carry out the wardens orders Did he ever order you to crucify the prisoners Were you ordered to make convict Lister hang himself What are you talking about You were seen going into Listers cell and you were seen coming out What happened in between Did you censor his mail Wouldnt he give you any information Or did you tell him a few lies about his wife You better stop drinking Doctor Your imaginations working overtime Visiting cells is part of my job helps me keep tabs on the men In that way can control them Control them You mean torture them dont you The more pain you inflict the more pleasure you get Thats why youd never resign from this prison Where else would you find so many helpless flies to stick pins into You talk to me like that If didnt keep you here youd be starving You surgical butcher For me its the last stop anyway But for you its just a beginning isnt it Why youre Genghis Khan Alexander the Great Caesar Look at you in the wardens chair Caesar trying out his throne Thats enough Caesar cries Enough Come come Youre obvious Munsey Your every move is obvious Youve cheated Youve lied Youve murdered Youre worse than the worst inmates of this prison Youre the psychopath here not they Thats it Munsey Thats it Not cleverness Not imagination Just force Brute force Congratulations
