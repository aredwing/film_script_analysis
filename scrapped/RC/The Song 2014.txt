Live from the Opry studios in Nashville Tennessee make welcome David King cannot hear have no sight Dark is near And your blinding light Can you hear me When cry Catch me when fall But cant hold on Take it away boys The words of the Teacher son of David Killer job man Killer job Great show baby This teaching is a light Yeah man now youre talking Good show Correction and instruction are the way to life keeping you away from your neighbors wife Go Do not go near her door Where you going boy Keep to a path far from her Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or be captivated by her eyes Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned Can a man stand on hot coals without his feet being scorched Another mans wife preys on your very life Hey baby you okay in there No one who touches her will go unpunished looked and saw all the evil that was taking place under the sun declared that the dead are happier than the living But better than both is the one who has never been born who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun Hello Jealousy arouses a husbands fury He will not accept any compensation however great it is No No No Daddy Dont leave man who commits adultery has no sense His shame will never be wiped away But And do you David take Bethany the one who confesses and renounces sin finds mercy to love and to cherish for better or for worse from this day forward do As you do not know the path of the wind or how the body is formed in a mothers womb you cannot understand the work of God Watch his head The maker of all things Hi Jed Who knows what is
