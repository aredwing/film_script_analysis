why these people these innocent people are persecuted and their blood spilled in the streets Their fears have overpowered both their minds and their consciences It has reached the point where they think that everyone who is not a Jew is their enemy Did that hurt No m fine Islam is a religion of peace ln this land Jews Christians and Muslims lived together in peace for centuries Wherever theres

create a homeland for homeless Jews little lady The Arabs do not want us here in our land in the land promised to us Youre lying At first youre right they wouldnt recognize the state of lsrael but now

do you want what is your objective Youre saying you have the power to give me whatever l want have the power to grant you whatever you want anywhere in the world then give back the lives of the people you murdered Ask me for something reasonable and lets resolve this amicably Are you trying to negotiate with me Yes am sure we can reach a mutually agreeable settlement My position is simple Get Moshe here so can kill him Then l kill you Then leave amicably Lets see how much you really mean to Polat Alemdar fear no one but Allah But what you fear most will ultimately come to pass Hes not from around here and he asked me to watch out for you so l brought you here for him to see with his own eyes Just how well can you see with only one eye can see well enough to spot your weaknesses Make sure to remember what you see because lm not going to let you see any more Isnt it a shame that youre going to die in this land You will pollute the Promised Land dont know what part of this land was promised to you But l can promise you the part six feet under You are very generous And if he asks youll give your life as well wont you Boss Let me tell you a little story long long time ago one of the Russian Tsars started a war against the Turks and some of the soldiers he drafted into his army were Jews While packing her sons rucksack the Jewish mother gave her son some advice Son when you wake up in the morning kill a Turk but then take a rest If you get too tired youll get sick Then kill another Turk change your shirt because if youre all sweaty youll catch a chill Then kill another Turk and have dinner then kill another Turk and get a good nights sleep Of course the son couldnt contain himself and said m killing Turks and all but its not like theyre doing nothing what if one of them kills me And his mother replied Why would a Turk kill you What did you ever do to a Turk What dont understand is this What did we ever do to you to make you come here Memati weve got to get going Boss But there was some advice your mother forgot to give you We are a people who even on the front worry about a kid whos afraid of catching a chill We say hes just a kid so were patient we say hell grow up realize hes making a mistake We wait patiently for him to grow into a man but if we see thats not going to happen we wont wait wed sacrifice the entire world rather than seeing the innocent suffer Get in the helicopter and leave this country Make sure and rest until l get back let that sweat dry Well meet again Were going Take Avi inside Aviiii dont care if you have to go to the very pit of Hell find them find them This is an lsraeli base Thats exactly what l wanted Were going to confiscate their weapons Boss how we going to carry these You take care of the children What are you
