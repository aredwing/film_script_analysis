is Life by Miss Europe nineteen hundred and something Workers forward march Sceptres crowns to pieces well break Slaverys chains from our limbs we will take Terrible sometimes our purging must be But this we must do to make people happy Hey Thats why we fight without pity for you Still we know the workers will one day win through Bourgeoisie butchers to hell with them all Mercy for all the others Hey Our one ideal alone Yes Were just practising a song for a play No m not going The weathers so bad Are you going out In weather like this Arent you going to march No m certainly not a type of society governed by industry in faith we accept this word Coming along nicely Here are the ones Thanks is equal to plus n square root of two plus x squared divided by two The function is thus small f and y as mentioned before Hey Petteri The former Miss Europe has written a new book Childhoods Environment With May Day we experience the awakening of spring dropped off during the lecture nearly dropped a test tube How did your May Day go was visiting relatives Are you coming to the biology class tomorrow Of course theyre the only lectures attend Every time wake up The books called Bread or rockets or something Has it got anything to do with Indirectly If the seed is treated This result was reached because it was considered that the most burning questions are biological in essence and that biology can solve them According to some conceited people there is no such thing as a population explosion because the world population is increasing by only annually Then the rodent eats the seed Excuse me would the gentleman there like to continue m sorry Please go on sir Thank you In the past thousand years the number of people has increased times more quickly than previously If a substance burns times more quickly than another one we should certainly call it an explosive substance And it wouldnt be gunpowder it would be a hydrogen bomb As a solution the biologists have offered two methods One of them is to increase the production of food and the second solution is birth control In this connection biological research certainly offers more pleasant methods than for instance mechanics Still biological means are granted about a millionth part of the funds that are devoted to the more traditional method that is war The morality of our society is based on theses according to which birth control is immoral Is it morally right that the human race should become the cancer that will take our planet back to the ancient virgin state with the only difference that in this new situation no new kind of life will be possible Thank you Hello Hi Tenu Lets go along the shore Swedish professor says that if you eat six pheasants in a row you die Our children and grandchildren will stand side by side on Earth eating algae off each others shoulders and making love to whoever happens to be standing next to them only hope my son happens to be next to a really niceIooking woman dont see its got to get as bad as that The straight line leading to overpopulation will start bending bet theyll think up something before that Theyll think up some new wars to thin the population out a bit In my opinion the pill is the easiest way We go this way Bye Love to Lulu ll tell her read in some paper about a Swiss couple adopting an Indian kid Its one way the individual can help Yes Still think most people want to have their own babies even if its only to see what theyll look like Why does there have to be all these frontiers Why do Indians have to be crowded into a too small bit of land Why cant the Chinese and the Japanese walk over their frontiers Statesmen talk about population policy for developing countries and breed like rabbits themselves without ever thinking they could adopt a child from India Yes thats true suppose But all the same Are they going to use all those pictures in the play She just asked do you mean to use all those pictures in the play dont think its so important whether we use the pictures or not What is important is what relation and contact we ourselves have with this Finnish fascist movement These pictures help us to find that out By Christ and by this hand No one blasphemes here Against our God and Fatherland Our Fatherland so dear Next line please We cannot wait till law is sent We cannot wait till law is sent To bring the reds in line The government We cannot trust The Lord God Only be our sign And the Lords chosen leader Together well bring order to this land And the Lord give power to this hand If in revenge trust Youre sure to suffer from that too For more revenge to come and come it must revenge you revenge we revenge anew Forgiveness is wiser and better Hell be forgiven that learns to forgive Forgiveness cant make a man less clever Learn to forgive and youll learn how to live God is truly strong but man is weak dont understand it at all Does it have to be done this way cant use any old mannerisms But when think of what has happened in the past few days feel the weakness This is going all to hell Man is weak but God is strong All right can do that any way you like feel weakness Listen Petteri Now if you make that caricature so bloody strong well be running into farce and our reviews will suffer Isnt this a comedy after all Its not the same thing to do comedy and make farcical types Lets try a song If we can get the song going as simply as possible youll find you can do the lines too Lets try it The earth is pressing pressing on the beam The earth is pressing Earth is pressing on the beam And the dead ones pressed Into the earth Yes now its coming thought so too The colourless aspect is the main thing All right lets try it like that So its tomorrow then My uncle is a pastor and hes a very nice man see The way you do that fascist priest in the play is that your idea of the clergy No its my idea of the fascist priest in this play The Lapua Opera The pastors and bishops of that time distorted the image of the church How do you know Were you living then Theres clear documentary evidence about how the clergy helped in acts of violence by giving their blessing and by choosing the Gods chosen leader They even went so far as giving their blessing to murder Have you ever thought about the private motives that the priest might have had that made him act that way They dont really interest me You talk too much about the individual m interested in how what he did affected the nation as a whole what he achieved by giving his blessing You dont seem to think much about individual If we try to have an effect on some whole on a herd its got to be intensified You cant handle big masses with featherlight stuff If they come and it has a terrific effect on them and theyre shocked when they see the play what will they do then There you go talking about individuals again If we can affect the general opinion then we should do it Its much better to do that than if we dont do anything The motives of the Finnish movement were pure patriotic and unselfish Communism was a national threat It threatened the recentlyachieved independence The Communist Party was forbidden Nevertheless Communists operated publicly openly communistically The Government could not ensure that its decisions were carried out The independence of the country was in danger Independent action was an ancient tradition independent action to the point of taking up arms And then they made widows and orphans How can you ever justify killing other people Still it must be true when theres evidence of kidnapping and murder Why didnt they tell me all about that Who can trust now Is Kari here Yes Juhamatti Yes Karipekka Here Anni Heidi Juhapekka Kalle In the water do what youve been told Put your head in the water and slide along flat and kick If conditions are ideal a child will learn to swim in three days What will we do then There are various examinations The public is again requested not to spoil the view by hanging clothes on the trees Grownups have wicked eyes They spy and they frighten Grownups have ugly mouths They spit and they sneer But children have happy eyes happy eyes happy eyes And pretty mouths with little teeth little teeth little teeth Grownups have hard hands They hit and beat and whip Grownups have such big feet Feet that stamp and kick But children have little hands little hands little hands And white slippers on their feet and white slippers on their feet Liisa Hi you here already ve got something to tell you Can you wait a minute ll just see those children are all

Here go This is Nipa and Hessu Limited Incorporated Friendship Free intercourse Turn with confidence on your backs could have both of them together It might be a bit tiring Specially if they are demanding They are nowadays What if one woman had two men at the same time There are women who can take seven men all at once And there are chaps who can manage several women in one night All at the same time What a man of steel Where do you find one like that can give you the address Dont give her mine If you had seven women in one night What would it be in a year lot of alimony at least Lulu see This one is much quieter In India they sterilize all the fathers after three kids They get a transistor radio as a reward know one case you should give a Wife of a Finnish farmer who was pregnant for the th time Her doctor said ve told you how you can avoid getting pregnant The poor woman replied But our pastor says that is a sin They should sterilize the pastors mouth How can there be such ignorant people nowadays Or are they lazy Maybe its the work of the Holy Ghost Women nowadays ought to know what theyre up to Science has gone so far Theyve invented all sorts of pills and coils and what have you Besides you couldnt get a modern woman pregnant even if you tried You bloody pig d never marry a bastard like you And its your sort become fathers Dont This is the landlords old sewing machine bet you can see a long way from here on a clear day You see all sorts of things from here Once there was a big ship that got burnt before it was finished They repaired it One day there was a

months late Youre late thirty thousand times a year Youre late again Whats that cabaret called Women and people Oh dear Only a certain kind of man says no What the hell are these women studying for They just get married and have children Dont you think men have anything to do with having children suppose m oldfashioned but believe a womans place is at home Lets just watch the show Youre studying art history right Lets hear what you think about modern architecture See you got nothing to say All that art history rubbish has got nothing to do with architecture Cant you keep quiet d never marry a woman who has some silly notions about having a career Noone like that would want you That got her Never mind Why do they keep making such a fuss about womens rights Its clear that a woman should stay home with her children Youre quite right there What do you think Are you leaving Yes Bye Why did you leave like that couldnt stand that man Then you started to tell me off The chap was so drunk you shouldnt have answered him at all know but he kept pushing his ugly mug into my face What shall we call it How about Jussi No not Jussi There are plenty of other good names besides Jussi Cheese In this country there is unemployment hunger want We have had to become accustomed to many highhanded methods But when men of darkness destroy the freedom of speech then a dagger or rather a Finnish knife has been sunk deep into the heart of our civil rights Marxism must be destroyed right down to its last remnant And it will be even if we first have to destroy the government The government should show that we live in a constitutional state Do we have freedom of speech freedom of press The newspaper in question almost outdid the reds who shared its ideals The only proper measure to take was to destroy the printing press and render the paper harmless Freedom of speech is for everyone Not for socialists The protection of the law is for everyone Into the car with him man like that talking about law and rights Lawyer Judge Got no balls Where did you lose your balls mate pig ate them when he was little as you can see and hear Put him in the car Send him all the way to Asia Shall we take him far Not this time This dirty bastard can take himself Well make him take the Lapua Oath so he wont interfere with the affairs of patriotic citizens again Men If necessary he will confirm his oath with blood The Lapua Oath Through the dark woods you hear the drumming wheels Of the black cars that clear away the Reds Bold are their tasks and bold are their ideals Bold are the patriots who proudly hold their heads high Our drivers never stopped by the weather Nor by the fear of any strangers gaze Destination unknown driving hell for leather Only the task and the order he obeys If it should happen that the police came And ended the journey before the task was done Our driver never would tell even his name His tongue is silent always as the dumb If all goes well with noone interfering And the car reaches the Russian frontier No fear of awkward witnesses appearing No fear the mystery ever will be clear The black car boldly drives on Its not sure that about man Anything good will be said after the bomb If the journey goes on to the grave Mans behaviour will earn no praise But must it go there No If the command is senseless And against humanity It cannot bind us If we really understand this language Then our heritance will be the land Not the grave cannot burn my military passport dont have any other papers cant get into a bar without it What was it all about the burning of military passports It may seem a bit emotional at first sight but all the same it emphasizes the common sense Yes agree that from their personal point of view it was ethically right but it didnt end any wars and it wont stop the next one starting All of us have to stop and think about our personal attitude to these matters The passport burning was a kind of selfrealization of this reflection Yes but when war breaks out what are they going to do then Then it will be too late This is kind of a preventive measure They should get women in the army for service jobs for instance The prettiest ones could become entertainers There has been plans for a womens army here too Women can be just as coldblooded as men First they give birth then kill We would probably be reserve lieutenants Liisa Tenu would be a second lieutenant Lets talk about something else Everyone goes on about developing countries and black children What about the poor backwoods of Finland Thats just the wrong sort of patriotism thinking that Finns should only care about Finns Hessu just means that theres no reason to go there yet but of course youve got to take a universal view Weve got to help everyone Anyway thats what both of us think about the matter Forest Finn Whats the use of all this talking and burning passports Do something so people can see how you think At least people talk about these things Talking is better than keeping silent While were chattering away children are dying in Vietnam They become blind or crippled or burned Mothers are being shot and their children starve to death Why are they born at all Why dont you do something for the children born today instead of talking and thinking that youll persuade people all over the world to become pacifists dont know what to think anymore ve been told the world can be changed Lets do it then feel tired The world is such a huge machine people cant control it It just goes on and on Everything is so complicated and mixed up dont even know what to do with my own life used to sit and plan my future for hours on end But cant anymore m frightened You said the worlds so huge that people cant affect it But the world is in people Thats how the world can be affected somebody elses world youre in love with You dont need to think about India or Vietnam You dont need to think about that all the time love you love you too If the pomegranates in bloom Come my love to the countryside In the village well spend our night In the morning well see in the vineyard If the vine is budding If the buds are open yet If the pomegranates in bloom There will give my love to you Hasten my love like a gazelle Like a mountain deer on a balsam hill There will give you my love Come my love to the countryside In the village well spend our night The berries of love are fragrant And before our door fruits grow Costly fruits fruits new and old For you my love have saved them Hasten my love like a gazelle Like a mountain deer on a balsam hill There will give you my love
