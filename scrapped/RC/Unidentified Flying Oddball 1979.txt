Stardust should definitely travel faster than light which as you all know is miles per second Wow Thats really pouring the coal to it We wont be using coal Senator Milburn Stardust will actually collect atoms while in flight ionising the medium ahead of the craft and guiding the ions into the intake area here This can be accomplished by the use of intense magnetic fields In just four and a half years the craft could reach our nearest star Alpha Centauri Arent such speeds supposed to turn back the clock or develop a time warp This flight will put Einsteins Theory of Relativity to the test The crew wont be aware of time passing Did you say crew The ship is designed for two crewmen You can stop right there Doctor You intend to put fine young American men into that untried

punishable by death wasnt aiding anybody You are my prisoner Do you contest that No Discretion is the better part of valour Very good must tell that to the King Lead on prisoner to Camelot Go on with your story Well Sir Mordred wanted Fathers land but Father refused to give it up He believes that every freeman should own the land he works isnt that right Father What is that They keep doing that They think youre a goblin Goblins come out in the evening Do you still think m a goblin Heaven forbid never thought it for an instant Goblins dont fly When did your father become a goose gander dont believe it Oh its quite true No mean the castle Thats Camelot It is King Arthurs Camelot Come on When returned from Haymarket the gander was in Fathers chair eating crumbs off the table So you figured it was your old man transformed by some evil spell What else could it be Father was nowhere to be seen and the door was locked If only could see Merlin know he could make Father himself again Merlin The magician Yes How would the likes of you know Merlin Oh just by reputation Now most gracious King Arthur shall transform this pinkeyed white rat into vintage red wine If were to turn you to stone Sir Gawain possibly might continue uninterrupted Rattray vanishay Et coldon hideway Howmay By my soul Thats wine Wine And that concludes my dazzling display of black magic for this evening Your servant Fear not have it subdued Your Majesty Mordred what have you in tow this time King Arthur after the ceremony Your Majesty with intention to rob this creature and five like it fell upon me in the forest with firebrands and lances despatched the others and spared this one as a curio for Your Majesty The head resembles a bug and ve not seen tentacles like that on a man creature before Its this space suit Your Majesty In sand shoes slacks and a blazer What are your plans for it Its not large enough for a beast of burden was thinking more along the lines of a burning Excellent suggestion Mordred With Your Majestys approval could do something out of the ordinary with this creature What do you mean burning Burn who For what Burning is a fit punishment for the offence Very well then burning early tomorrow Burn him When do get my turn to bat Wait wait Wait Let him speak would know something of your plan could sell this better without this helmet Do you have a wrench around here

you wont feel a That face Hi Er you wanted to hear about my plan suppose should start with a little history or in your case a little future In a man named Christopher Columbus is going to discover America America is another continent approximately miles from here Columbuss ships will be named the Nia the Pinta and the Santa Maria lot of people think that Leif Ericson got there first dont know All know is that all the banks are closed on Columbus Day not Ericson Day Ericson Day So we jump a couple of hundred years So when Stardust blasted off prematurely was trapped inside You recall my explanation of the law of gravity and how that theory is applied to orbiting objects Well Stardust Yes yes we all recall Madame Curie and Fultons steamboat and that imbecile who flew kites in the rain Just think what we could do with the likes of them today if they were not just the creation of your disordered Those are the straight goods It happened just the way told you or at least it will And you seriously expect us to believe that you were alive years from now Then why arent you years old Well thats a little difficult to explain With your permission may suggest we put an end to this travesty Agreed Take him away Wait a minute can tell you how the Crusades come out Mordred tries to take over your kingdom Maybe with a little historical licence can help you out King m very good with a screwdriver Just listen Food for Sir Mordreds latest prisoner Sandi over here Thing hardly recognised you without your head on Stop with that thing thing This is getting serious m gonna be burned at the stake Can you believe that Me burned at the stake heard But see ve brought you something Clarences hammer to free you from your chains You did all this for me Well youve harmed no one You should

special suit It resists heat Its even got its own temperature control like a builtin airconditioning system Now between that and the asbestos mater Asbestos material need a match Didnt that hurt No no Here hold that candle And that doesnt either must go now No reason to be afraid ll be safe This material is a mixture of a silicate of calcium and magnesium It doesnt conduct heat Now do you understand Of course No Sandi m no different from you or anybody Ow What was that Next room The mans got growing pains It cant last for long Are you all right Who Who asks such a stupid question Tom Trimble m Sir Mordreds prisoner Satan himself He wants me to confess killed one of his deer If confess to his charge must forfeit all my properties to him It is my only legacy to my beloved daughter Alisande Are you Sandis father You You know my daughter Yes yes Poor child must think me dead Actually she thinks youre a goose goose Her own father She must get word to our sovereign Dont worry After

radio think not Your Highness That was er That was Babe Ruth And Uncle Milty was will be the first man to fly correct believe he invents the horseless carriage but dozed off through that period He

thou Plainly he comes from hardy stock Your Majesty Merlin fan the flames Merlin Do you think this creature has unholy powers Impossible mean Your Majesty my liege may have underestimated his capacities d rather he was with us than against us Weve already abused that option cant have it roaming the halls of Camelot Mordred it was all your doing And should be the things undoing There is nothing to fear We have yet to see how this creature resists cold steel Page Go inside and fetch my sword Me Thou jests Thou art on thin ice bid thee obey Youre in trouble Mordreds looking for you

attached to it hate to impose on you Your Majesty but would you be so kind ll fillet thee like a flounder May remind you Mordred that you are a knight of the Round Table Ohhh If youd be so kind Is that fair good knight must use his own judgement Sir Mordred is one of our own Release it quickly find it impossible to oblige you It is metal it attracts Touch not metal with the blade His head be

knight trust you have proof Oh do Follow me Wait king does not follow a captive however weird he may be Sorry King go ahead Downstairs and to your left King Sir Mordred put him down here Poor guys just skin and bones It appears hes wasted away to nothing If indeed he ever was here Mordred m told youre involved in a what Land grab Wresting property from free men blatant lie Your Majesty My honour had been impugned demand satisfaction on the field Again He has that right though ve lost some good knights that way Maybe made a mistake Maybe he said Moorhead not Mordred joust to the death

that Clarence are you alone Go away My hours are numbered as it is ve got a proposition for you This is yours to keep if youll help me get outta here If you dont fight Sir Mordred youll be banished from England for ever That still beats a sharp stick in the chest What do you say Theres a rope by the old chapel ll be there at Whats that oclock What news upon my worthy opponent Weve searched the castle He has fled Obviously hes cast his spell on the guards and fled which gives little satisfaction to me If he has not made an appearance soon well consider him vanquished And with it trust his heinous charges against Sir Mordred my liege Hello whats this Oh Father he looks so handsome All in white with his little red white and blue flag We must give him something to take into battle and his world beyond You shall not have your victory without bloodletting after all My pleasure Lets get on with it Oh Thomas it would make me most proud if youd carry something of mine into battle Please wear this Oh its from Father too Thank you Is it over yet Not yet But the maid Alisande is talking to your twin brother Hes not my brother Sandi Yes Hes a humanoid a robot When we reset his staticizer programmed him to joust for me Well if thou say so Thomas wouldnt dare speak like this if ever had to face you again But since youre going to be killed see no harm in revealing my feelings for you Clarence think she likes me We really have no time for this If one of Sir Mordreds servants found us here dare not contemplate his wrath All right Hermes thats enough Put her down and get on with the joust Hes programmed to react but this is sheer insubordination Hermes put the girl down and go on with the joust Thats an order You feel soft feel soft Thats it Thats all you have to say Later There is no later can turn you off as fast as she can turn you on Get what thou seeks and let us vacate these chambers Youre right Giddyup Should somebody should tell him his arms missing cannot intercede made the rule Hows it going Ah look at that Hermes turn around and do it again You just have to keep going till you cant go any longer Hows Hermes doing Not very well m afraid He seems to have lost his head Hermes is cool Oh you mean lost his head m sorry Hermes but this is to save England have seen similar phenomena in chickens My Lord This is England sire Sir Mordred Can you not put an end to this It has long ceased to be sport As Your Majesty knows tradition demands he must yield or die Well at least its out of its misery Come The contest is over down there Hows Hermes Done for Maybe can put him together again All the Kings horses and all the Kings men couldnt do that Look at this This is it Just wait till King Arthur gets a load of this mon lets go Pity was becoming rather attached to it whatever it was It will no longer be a source of torment ve despatched it from our midst for all time With your permission will keep these remains for my laboratory and gain an insight into its origins and feeding habits Yes well do as you please Merlin but tidy up thoroughly Merlin Oh m sorry Might prevail upon you to change my father over there into his old self Its seems Later later my child More important matters demand my attention You and your father can wait in my quarters Wait a minute Everybody stay right where you are Merlin keep your mitts off Hermes Sandi m all right You are This is too much You reproduce yourself like a lizards toe You change colours like a chameleon have documentary proof that Mordred is acquiring territory arms and men for a takeover How did you acquire such holdings see youve been levying your own taxes To what ends Sir Mordred Well To take over Camelot and with it England He sees himself in your chair King Seize that knight Death to Arthur Stop him Gawain theres something unholy about this Wouldnt it be better to let him rest in peace Perhaps a dandelion poultice would help Its not as bad as thought can bypass his synthesiser and keep his command analyser functioning Maybe you can do something about Father told you saw your father talked to him Are you certain Hes about stone and fivefootnine He may be a little taller than that now We must thank you for revealing Mordreds treachery Is there no way we can repay you No m glad to help out We must inspect the castle defences m worried about Mordreds attack may be able to help out there Hmm Hang in there Hermes well have you up and about in no time No hard feelings about the joust You are so brave Hermes Oh dont worry hes resting comfortably Clarence werent you supposed to help hide the valuables So er how would you like a personally conducted tour of Stardust Oh think not ve got some Ps you havent heard Fleetwood Mac Rolling Stones Thanks anyway Hey why the hot and cold bit Didnt you say before the joust that you felt pangs Oh Thomas made an awful fool of myself didnt know who or what was talking to bared my heart to to your brother here and it turns out that hes full of

get to see Merlin now Keep a sharp eye Fear not sire we shall defend our castle whatever the cost may be We shall fight on the beach heads we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the courtyards and in the halls we shall never surrender ll be darned Well said Winston Theyll probably come from the north Theyll come from the south Mordred will make an assault on the gates with battering rams and superior forces Theyll have to bridge the moat first have the answer to that You do Yes sir See that hay cart down there We can all see the hay cart What wizardry hast thou now This is called a laser gun Hermes was supposed to use it on planets for collecting rock samples You pull the trigger there and dont point it at anything that you wanna keep cart is a cart Lets see how effective it is against the stone walls of Camelot Wait one second Now Well what do you think Well have always had the highest regard for you Tom remain sire your most obedient servant Gawain please cease thy fawning prattle This is very dangerous Be careful it doesnt fall into the wrong hands Dont worry King keep it handy at all times Oaf its going to be impossible for Mordred to take Camelot with that American and his magic candle Oaf kill No Arthur would have an immediate investigation Theres more than one way to skin a cat though it could get pretty sticky Find that demented girl and tell her the magician will see her in the lower chambers And will take care of the American You understand what you are to do Oaf Now you be nice to the magician when he sees you Hes there to help Merlin is expecting us The first visit is two gold coins payable at time of treatment The magician will see you now Well my dear what is the matter m all right sire its Father Let me go Let me go Get

Fiendishly clever the American Who else wouldve thought to hide it there But he did not reckon with the clairvoyant powers of the invincible Merlin Will it make a big noise again Hope not had the cotton packed too tightly last time Thats why it exploded Hes trying to get thrust to propel the craft into the air Cant you see that Very good Hermes Wheres Sandi Forget about her cooled my heels for three hours waiting for her She and are through You put her out of your mind too Thats not easy here goes Hey m terribly sorry Use that dagger when Mordred attacks think can fix it Hey what have you got there Its a goose as anyone can plainly see Its a gander Where did you find him It was on the moat Then it flew up to the parapet Hell make a splendid supper No he wont Keep him in protective custody And not that care but where was the girl There was no girl about just him did hear a woman scream from yon wood saw her with Oaf going to Merlins room That quack King think were in trouble You havent misplaced her there The laser guns gone Whod take it Merlin He lured me out by saying Sandi would meet me Merlin and Mordred Absolutely Theyre in cahoots Where Theyre partners Whered he take her The seaside is awfully nice this time of year Please This is serious Mordreds camp no doubt Weve got to do something Dont look at me ll take care of it myself Youre not going after the wench The poor kid needs help got it King need your armour Oh really You keep forgetting youre a prisoner dont lend prisoners my armour The answer is no Then Mordred will reduce Camelot to dust Well perhaps my

night and makes strange breathing sounds Call out the guards It is the American He has taken the bait Its King Arthur himself No its Tom Trimble ve come for Alisande You shouldnt have come Theyll kill you With your choice of weapons Get behind me That will serve little purpose We have seen the awesome power of the magic candle It will annihilate you both in a flash Now Mordred do the honours Any parting words American d like to speak to Sandi for a second Be brief All right Sandi just want you to know that groove on you My idea of heaven would be to split a pizza and a pack while watching the Super Bowl maybe smooch a little at the half Well what do you think Any news of Father Didnt you hear told you loved you m not going all through that again On the other hand if its between you and Oaf ll take you Great Pull down my visor Get behind me Yes Fire at will Mordred Mordred cease before you destroy your entire force He has bewitched it Stop them Oaf hold these two ll settle with them
