but thank you Well we brought foam fingers And were doing the wave if things get dull Dud Welcome everybody to the Young Voices of Journalism Panel m Arthur Gordon a professor of English here at Yale and shall be moderating todays panel Were joined today by the editors of some of the countrys most prestigious collegiate newspapers Whoohoo We have before us editors from the Harvard Crimson the Daily Princetonian the Cornell Daily Sun the Daily Pennsylvanian and the Yale Daily News all here today to tell us whats on their minds to hear where they think ivyleague journalism is heading and more broadly to share their views on the future of the free press in America Whoa Heavy So will begin by posing a series of questions to our panel Now lets begin was wondering how the panelists would describe the state of journalistic ethics on a collegiate level in the postJudy Miller era and Wonderful question Quentin Walsh Daily Princetonian The ramifications of the scandal to which you obliquely alluded ought not to be underestimated hate this guy already Rory told me about him Thats Pompous Princeton Guy Well sure If your parents name you that what chance do you have The struggle to preserve the fundamental principles and rights upon which our free press depends was made far more difficult by the choice of certain reporters who shall remain unnamed to capitulate to governmental pressure and divulge their sources Hes unbelievable Hes wearing a bow tie Should dud him myself have on occasion felt tremendous pressure to divulge unnamed sources but ve stood my ground knowing that while may suffer for my principled stand there was a much greater issue at stake If may Rory Gilmore Yale Daily News While agree that there is no greater or more important tool for a free press than confidential sources also think it unwise for us to presume from our limited experiences editing college newspapers that we really have any true understanding of what it must feel like when the federal government of the United States puts the screws to you just think it would be the height of hubris for us to claim for fact that we know what we would do when faced with that kind of pressure But thats just one reporters opinion We created her Out of thin air just dont care how funny the picture is If its not newsworthy and cant see how it would be would not publish a picture of the university president stuffing his face with key lime pie at the drama club bake sale m sure President Levin will be pleased to hear that If someone pushed key lime pie in the presidents face as a statement that would print Me too front page Quentin you agreed with me didnt think you were capable On that collegial note m afraid we have to end our discussion d like to thank all our panelists for a terrific discussion and thank you all for coming Our girls got skills She even had her arch rival laughing with her by the end Shes keeping her enemies close and giggling Very devious So If had a cooler of Gatorade d pour it over your head Sounds refreshing So was pretty good wasnt You dazzled You totally wiped the floor with Pompous Princeton Guy Well the floor looked a little dirty So can we
