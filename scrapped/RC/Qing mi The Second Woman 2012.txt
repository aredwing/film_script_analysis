Yup Bao is coming back for dinner tonight Is her hubby coming with her Hubby They arent married yet Your younger sister should get married Theyve been going out for a long time Nan is a nice guy Quite a talent in drama too Uncle tai you didnt know his mother was a very popular Cantonese opera actress Of course didnt know We mostly did old tunes Like this one its silent in the garden at midnight the night is tender and charming being in the countryside of Moscow Blessed is the lady who will be his wife Can you fish in this low tide Therere only stones Not a chance ll leave it to fate If the fish is willing well be very happy m just doing this to kill time Your sister and nan are made for each other They both studied theatre Met each other immediately after graduation Youre right Bao is really lucky Sister Huiniang You mustnt be so obstinate a girl without true love cannot live long but being killed ruthlessly is too much of a tragedy Huiniang life is nothing but an illusion Please stay put for a while You must understand this is the fate of us concubines Sister Huiniang Are you alright nan Nothing Am Honestly was thinking of casting two actresses to play the roles The pressure would have been too heavy for one actress plus the two characters have to appear in the same scene However think whoever is being casted the two roles must be played by the same actress Pei falls for Zhaorong because she looks exactly like Huiniang If the two roles were played by two different actresses you wont get the same impact Bao Do you agree Yes youre right of course No question about it Nonetheless my performance has to be matched by others Your lines were all wrong Theres no rhythm And emotion at all Jiangxian should be sympathetic with Huiniang Youll ruin the performance of your partners d say as director shouldnt you consider casting another actress for Baos role Its still early We have time to adjust that Bao you must work harder You must listen to Amys opinions m glad that everyone thinks this is a good script Dont waste this opportunity Try your best Thanks director Thanks Ms Amy ll work harder Daydreaming again Are we going to dry read Easy Stop thinking about rehearsals What else should think about Me For me Have you forgotten Its your birthday Its unimaginable for such a small potato like me to be with you d say you are the best birthday present from god

Huixiang Arent you bored by facing all this darkness everyday No Look There are ships passing and theyve got lights Nonetheless at times find it scary just feel like being sucked by all this darkness As if nothing has ever existed Just kidding Nan said hed like to take a walk At this hour Its kind of late Its the cat Dont be afraid told you didnt want to come dont care about your crickets Do you want to stay at home with your mom Stop bantering with each other You should know very well that Baos biggest fear is darkness Please no rats Am such a coward Really See wholl get the crickets first Where are you going rat Look at yourself You were laughing at Bao Happy birthday It comes in a pair bought it for the two of you You bought it primarily for her If thats what you think you may throw it away Its too dark here Much darker than the stage think the opposite The stage is often very bright So bright that you can never see the audience Yes This has an advantage At least you wont feel nervous It wont ruin your performance You dont have to care about how others would look at you You seem to be freer on stage Wont mind how others think of you One can also choose ones favorite part to play when ones on stage and play it as one likes Thatll be heaven You cant play the way you like on stage You have partners and a director Not to mention the playwright Its not as simple as youd think Right hows your play the legend of the plum blossom going Its okay Its just Bao is in trouble The director is very demanding The female lead is fussy too Can go watch your rehearsals Its okay if the answer is no dont mean that Were still at the beginning You may come later when we dress rehearse Did you find any cricket No Did you find any cricket Didnt see any ll look further Lets go too Have

Huixiangs ve heard Huixiang is not home these past two days She had something to take care of Thatll be fine If something happens do call the police Well deal with it immediately know But since Huixiangs family didnt report the case were not entitled to do anything understand passed by Huixiangs shop everyday Its almost a week that its been closed Isnt there an uncle tai whos very close with her Huixiang always chatted with him at the pier He should be having his break at the tea restaurant now Its his habit Never miss a single day Old chaps are like that Did her sister ask you to look for her No its nan He was here this morning Oh He asked me for the overcoat Its the one uncle tai found on the seaside two days ago They thought it was Huixiangs We brought it to Huixiangs mom But she denied it was hers Shes very angry Isnt that her mom know there is something wrong with her eyes But nan also said the same when he saw it this morning That proved her mom was correct Uncle tai My name is Wang saw you get off the boat You have good eyes This is my name card heard you found an overcoat on the seaside Yes Why are you interested in it Nan is my good friend m tracing something for him know nan told the police about the overcoat Nobody cared Does it look familiar Who have you seen wearing it Honestly Im not sure But its not Huixiangs style This Im pretty sure But it does look a bit familiar Mr How are you What Can ask something Anything strange happened here saw Huixiang going to the pier hurriedly on that morning Are you sure it was Huixiang recognized Huixiangs clothes Boss Is it usually so quiet Boss Its particularly quiet lately Why Its that old theatre over there its haunted Youre quick You were just inside a second ago Everything reminds me of her dreamt that she talked to me Huiniang The handkerchief it was a token of love Is it because look like her that you it was my mistake to have loved you Peilang Whats the difference between you and Jia Sidao Great Thats the way it is Well continue tomorrow was rehearsing Huixiang m Bao Sorry m wrong again Bao ll change first Excuse me cant locate the cloth Zhaorong wears at the climactic scene Sorry guess well fix another time Let me find again ll call you for another appointment Okay m really sorry You called her Huixiang deliberately right Yup You really want to look for clues here You think it may upset the people here No one in the troupe knows she has a twin sister Best avoid that see Nan have you found out that the overcoat the police discovered was Baos Why didnt you tell me Me and Huixiang see Are you suspecting the same cant believe Huixiang could have killed Bao You said you saw Bao holding Huixiangs hairpin know now The one you saw isnt Bao Shes Huixiang Huixiang was passing herself off as Bao had thought so too But theres something weird Nan got confused too He cant differentiate between Huixiang and Bao If Huixiang really passes herself off as Bao he should have recognized After all theyve been together for some time Have a examination Just a few thousand bucks So simple of twins are identical It doesnt work This leaves only the fingerprints Do it then Its not easy We need to have the fingerprints of both persons for comparison Itll end up to nothing Are we stuck ve got it Its time for my entrance Brother nan What are you doing here Its about Huixiangs disappearance My brother seems to be totally clueless Thats why Im here to check and see Nan have you made sure yourself whether its Huixiang or Bao that were seeing m going to the back of the hill The back of the hill Why ll go with you Fingerprints if we have some objects with Baos fingerprints to to compare with those of her right now we can easily find out the truth Right She had stayed in my house too The fingerprints of both must have mixed together Its very difficult to verify Is there some place shed have gone only by herself Let me think will too d like to stay a bit longer Can you go down by yourself Sure Why would the scholar on the bridge return to this place Maybe its harmless to meet him Greetings scholar You only care about Huiniang Scholar doesnt this red gown remind you of someone Shes dead Shes disillusioned and this caused an accident She visited the lake but met her death instead Please come in ll be ready in a minute This is for you Put it on and see if it fits ve missed you If there was no Bao will you be with me nan told me about the disappearance of Huixiang m here to gather some clues Its very quiet here Very quiet indeed At times it makes you feel scary Its disturbing Fan do you know why didnt report to the police about Huixiang after all these days Why think its Bao and not Huixiang whos staying with me now They have different scent But must say Im not at all sure Because at time smelled Huixiang seems like shes nearby It may sound absurd Before lost my sight couldnt differentiate between them They liked to swap cloths to fool me when they were young It was at those times that was completely confused about the two of them Luckily was able to finish Zhaorongs dress in time lost the original The director was mad at me Just be more careful Lots of unfortunate things have happened Huixiang has watch out There was uncle song who died inside the seaside motel The body was discovered only after more than ten days Poor chap More than ten days With this weather the smell must be awful True We dare not walk near the place haunted house no one dares go near why is there light Fan have the whole picture now What do you mean Didnt you say when you were at the troupe earlier someone told you that Bao was seen in the props room but was spotted at the gate in the next brink So what ll have to go to the island for more clues Hey What Dont go alone Theres nothing can do if something happens to you Stop worrying m not a kid anymore Hey what again The report on the fingerprints has been issued What does it say There were two sets of fingerprints on the hairpin One of them was identical with that on the tape recorder The hairpin belongs to Huixiang That means Yup That proves my assumption Eat something What happened the other night m asking you What the hell happened Let go to the back of the hill and talk You and nan Is there something going on that Im not aware of There are things that should remain unsaid Stop asking Lets find a shelter Its alright The thunder will pass Huixiang why do you have to do this to me There are things that should remain unsaid As long as you believe isnt that good enough Lets concentrate on tonights performance first Okay Fan what happened How did you find out Im here You texted me Not me It must be Huixiang Huixiang She tied me up here Wheres she Dont know She said something like Bao is the female lead for the first time tonight Female lead m nan please leave a message Shit hope didnt regain consciousness Why Thank god youre still alive Otherwise Bao and all of us will be heartBroken Bao is the lead for the first time in tonights show The mountain is bidding farewell to the sun The moons reflection is bathing in the lake The breeze is stirring up my sadness Separated from the outside world was held captive in desertion was suffering great pain even in my dreams found myself trapped in a deadEnd Nan found Baos hairpin in the hills This proves that they were there But how come they were out on the sea Did Huixiang mention this to you Yes Do you remember our childhood days when jun and all of us went sailing on a stolen boat How Ive missed those simple days recall the time when almost fell into the sea It was you who saved me Is that so have forgotten Huixiang lets steal a boat and go sailing Honestly you and nan look What a lovely sky Look at it Its so beautiful No wont Huixiang must make sure whats going on among us Bao there are certain things that should remain unscathed No No must make sure of them If thats the case things will come to an end dont care Even if the result is disastrous have to do that Do you know what he likes best Do you know where his erogenous zones lie Pervert If you dont know What exactly do you want to make sure know know Why is he nan Why Theres one more thing you should know too That is youre a rotten actor And a rotten girlfriend too Bullshit Its bullshit Bao Huixiang save me Huixiang Bao Come come You want to drown me You want me dead You are sick Bao Bao Bao Did Huixiang explain why she didnt go home She remained unconscious in the sea for a while But she was choked and came back to life by the water She held herself to the boat and made sure Bao went ashore before she swam back Baos clothes were all soaked She changed in Huixiangs clothes and left The person whom uncle tai saw the other morning was in fact Bao But things just happened too suddenly and horribly According to Huixiangs personality shed be totally clueless in facing Bao Thats why she was afraid to go home see now She must have hidden inside the old theatre Didnt you mention that there were signs of people staying there Right bumped into her hiding place Thats why she had to find another place Intermission for minutes One thing keeps bugging me Why didnt Bao say anything about what happened on that night Did she really think she had killed Huixiang It might have been like that she found out soon that Huixiang was still alive Because Mrs li from the next door received a call from Huixiang Didnt Bao make that call had thought so But it was actually Huixiang who called Do you mean she had known that Huixiang was alive Exactly Thats why she objected to calling the police She even went to Huixiangs hiding place Not so fast bro But why did she hide the fact that Huixiang was alive Difficult to fathom Maybe it was deliberate She may want to know what Huixiang really wants yearned for you and had waited in vain the parting three years ago languished in my memory There wasnt a single night didnt find myself in tears Peilang youre the cause for all these unbearable torments was on the battlefield for three years this token has stayed with me all the time wonder if could have persisted without it My dearest Huiniang How have missed and longed for you No If have returned to meet Zhaorong shouldnt have indulged myself in Huiniangs memory Shes dead and thats that To do that is simply unfair to Zhaorong No must not do that But Huiniang died because of me How could be so heartless in forgetting her and destroying the token Huiniang my beloved How Ive missed you Peilang my Peilang have waited three long hard years in vain Huiniang is the woman who has been occupying your thoughts If indeed that is the case fine Youll have my blessing Despite the sadness caused by parting love will ultimately turns into dust ll never cease the yearning for my beloved Zhaorongs jealousy has caused her to develop hallucinations She imagines herself as Huiniang to satisfy Peilangs craving Arent you Huiniang Werent

happily ever after Will you What but why Dont you realize Youre dead in his mind You shouldnt have returned to badger things Huiniangs dead The one you saw was just an illusion Let me ask you one thing Do you want her or me love Zhaorong yet love Huiniang too Stop making a victim of yourself ve had enough Arent you dead Why did you return From the very beginning this stage should have been my
