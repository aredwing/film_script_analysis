she had any reason to be scared dont know Not more than anyone else The neighbourhood is what it is Well there were signs of a burglary but no forced entry which means Miss Gamon knew her assailant Or at least let him in dont want to speak badly about anyone but think you should consider the possibility that she brought someone home man mean She she was aggressive sexually Jeff Ali you dont know and didnt want to say anything but Did you see someone or what No no nothing like that But she came on to me pretty aggressively one night just think that maybe you should consider the possibility Maybe Maybe Tell me Mr McAuley when she came on to you did you encourage her in any way No Well the murder weapon appears to have been a plate or a dish of some sort plate Well not really a plate heavy dish of some sort We found small pieces of ceramic in her wounds casserole dish Yeah maybe You said Miss Gamon brought something over for dinner Yes Did she take it when she left No No she left it here May see it It might be part of a set Sure Is that the dish She brought some sweet potato stuff in it Lets have a look Alright Thats it for now If you remember anything else please give me a
