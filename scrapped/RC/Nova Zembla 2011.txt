northwest lts almost a month since we left Holland We pass a mediumsized island to port The captain decides to anchor and go ashore looking for fresh provisions before we head for the cold The coasts are deserted We are explorers entering a new world Look up there men Fresh meat Theyre parrot crossbills we used to call them twites Jan youre the lightest Little writer How about you Claes come on Birds Jantje Every sailor in Amsterdam wanted to join this voyage fortune awaits beyond the horizon The men call themselves the chosen But why were they chosen Why None of the men have something to return to None have a wife or children No one has a home Apart from me We leave the island and sail north on a westerly wind Late that evening the island is miles behind us Now theres only open sea Claes give it back Give it back Make him taste the blood Come on then Hold him under Hold him under Head in head in Come on boys Claes Stop it Whats going on Claes He stole by book from my chest Shut up Gerrit l thought he was asleep l didnt want to wake him Claes How often have l told you not to get worked up like this Possessions on board are sacred Claes All sailors know that You know the punishment The captain will tell you what will happen Everyone knows the rules on board Tomorrow morning The widow Traitor Clear up the blood No one can survive or minutes in that icecold water lts your decision Claes will drown Claes is strong Hell drown He wont make it Then reverse the decision l cant You decided for me Youre the captain Dont keep telling me that One of us is captain its not

weak captain benefits no one ln the name of the Republic Pull Come on pull Hes stuck He wont make it You wont put this in your book will you little man Yes l will l know exactly how to write it down Claes was the strongest man on board And everyone was afraid of him Everyone Apart from the captain and Barentsz And Claes knew all too well that minor infringements could be punished severely He knew that all too well But Claes happened to be Claes and Claes wasnt afraid of the devil Gerrit de Veer hes writing about me Gerrit the quill One big hurray for Claes Hurray And one big hurray for the quill Hurray We sail east and north We havent seen any ice Thats strange because were so far north The men withdraw increasingly into their fixed routine We go west with a northerly wind and at about five oclock southeast with a northeasterly wind Land Men Land Land ahoy l see land What you think it is l dont know lts Nova Zembla men lts Nova Zembla The New Land Tomorrow well investigate lt means China is close by China is within our reach tot for everyone to celebrate Well done Jacob Keep them motivated Tomorrow well explore Nova Zembla Eight of us row to the mainland of Nova Zembla We pull the sloop dry and climb to the top to get the lie of the land The land is much bigger than indicated on the map We start to suspect the land will block our passage little later we see open water in the southeast We return to our ship to tell the news to Willem Barentsz This northern route goes straight through the ice You want to follow it Willem lts crazy lt wont happen The ice is temporary Plancius assured us based on his last calculations Rubbish Plancius knows as much as he knows This island isnt mapped right lts much further west You want more examples Plancius knows more than Portugal and Spain together Whats wrong with you lll tell you lts my ship and lm the one who decides the route Write that down And something else l dont want to contribute to your third failure in a row Write that down too Gerrit Up here What did they say What will they do You were there What took so long Nova Zembla Here We are here Whats up here Right up north No one knows Barentsz says this is the route But Van Heemskerck wants to go this way They dont agree Why Van Heemskerck thinks he has a better route than Plancius Well reach the ice too soon They have to find a new route Look at the stars Leo and Orion The giants right shoulder Always watch Orions belt the minister says They are three stars close together Yes there Mintaka Alnitak and Alnilam Very good Very useful some knowledge of astronomy You never know ln a few hundred years people will travel between the stars Columbus was given tobacco as a gift by the lndians Did you know that He thought it stank and threw it overboard but one sailor a wayward sailor called Roderigo kept some Later he walked the streets in Spain smoking a pipe People thought he was a devil with all that smoke They threw him in jail He was in jail for seven years lts not always better to show off l want you to read it out loud Everything you wrote You have time Start at the beginning Read it yourself Vos Vos cant read Shut up and go to sleep Claes You read it out loud and start with what Van Heemskerck and Barentsz talked about Why should l Because we asked you My friend and l How do you know that lm reading whats written in here Vos youre on watch Get on deck l know all about you sprat You work for the Spanish And youll tell them everything we face on this voyage wont you Vos come on We prepare to take Willem Barentsz route We want to sail around the north of Nova Zembla But the current there is so treacherous but after many vain attempts we return to anchor The first contact with the ice was days later than expected You have that Add the date lts provisional This has nothing to do with notes rough sketches Here This is the bill of lading Thats important They dont match Thats irrelevant lts official blackandwhite with your signature Jacob van Heemskerck This mentions more considerably more provisions few thoughts Plancius signature He had some ideas in case Were way too heavy Willem That makes us vulnerable deep in the ice Why do we have all the extra provisions The weather is calm and clear Weve reached the north of Nova Zembla We seek shelter from the ice and call this bay lce Harbor And now for a story Who feels like a story Something real Something from life l need one person to help me Someone has to walk with me lll go with Gerrit on a pub crawl Yes ln Amsterdam When we get back well have earned a drink havent we Where shall we start On Zeedijk Take it easy Thats more like the place to end Okay well take it easy Lets start on Damrak We can look at the new ships And we greet him and him and we see who made it back Then well go to the pharmacist lm feeling thirsty And we stop at the Blue Grape for one Or two Then we carry on l have to get out l have to get out Out Now shut up dammit Everything had been discussed l thought Months of preparation the route finance l thought it all figured The negotiations in China And then to the lndies And the voyage back But what happened You and Plancius messed up You conspired Why is there so much more provisions on board than agreed Why Why didnt you involve me in your plan l told you that already Just in case And the other questions You would have objected What next What dyou think will happen now Well spend the winter here And youll tell the men Well go ashore here and spend the winter here The whole winter Thats months and months And the food What about food ltll be rationed Theres enough on board As long as everyone sticks to his ration Well manage Were doomed lf anyone has a better plan tell me The ice has pushed the ship back and forth And under the pressure of the breaking ice it finally broke up Our ship lost when faced with the might of nature We lost but dont give up This was all l could find Beans Whats the use of beans l searched everywhere We need greens and fresh meat And best of all is cochlearia What Scurvy grass lts magic You get over it in no time But does it grow here They say it does Lets look You
