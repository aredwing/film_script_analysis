Genes ideas about the future and about man are wacky doodle Red alert shields up David Gerrold He was a flawed man He had great virtues he had great flaws thought Gene was going to come across the table at me saw first hand Genes battling with the studio Rick Berman Gene was considered somewhat of a pain in the neck he was kind of a blustery guy Fontana Gene wasnt the easiest person to get along with but he stuck up for his beliefs and his concepts It was just a lot of in fighting it was all chaos Ira Steven Behr There was really scary stuff going on Theres a lawyer going around looking in peoples desks when theyre not there Brannon Braga spent the first couple of years just worried was going to be fired Sir Patrick Stewart My agent was the first person to talk to us There wasnt a hope in hell that this show would even make it through the first season William Shatner This film is about the turbulent years that marked the beginning of Star Trek The Next Generation How it got off the ground and survived the chaos of the first three years became fascinated with the struggle not only the creative struggle but the struggle for power Those doors are opening up on Stage where the bridge for The Next Generation was first constructed Power is an ephemeral its what is perceived In order for power to exist it has to be acknowledged by the people who are involved in the work What began to see was Gene Roddenberry the creator of Star Trek aging and in diminishing health trying desperately to hold on to his creative vision his legacy and ultimately his power Hurley Roddenberry had an incredible loyalty he was very loyal to his friends No Gene screwed over all his friends as well as his enemies You know he had a lot of demons He was very perceptive had a high Gene was a historical revisionist Creative and contributive and collaborative Very intimidating guy His good nature He could be a bully But he was a nice man and was a generous man Gene had a way of making you feel really good about yourself He could inspire people to do better than they believed they were capable of just found him a decent man And had a lot of worldly experience bomber pilot in the Pacific decorated Pan Am pilot world wide had great arguments about philosophy and all sorts of things He was a really remarkable man thought Gene was fun but then later as things were not going as well think he got sour Theres this twenty year in the desert for Gene Hes the forgotten man Fontana The things that didnt happen were disappointing and very saddening His wife Majel would go to the conventions and they would sell memorabilia and make some money that way and that money helped sustain him When youre out of work as a writer in Hollywood and you cant find it its a difficult life guarantee you he had a difficult life between Star Trek and the first movie We get back together for Next Gen and for him its like hes been called back out of the desert and given a position of power again At the time Gene Roddenberry was considered somewhat of a pain in the neck he was kind of a blustery guy who was not very agreeable Everybody else forgot him after Star Trek the motion picture this epic disaster Every aspect of it got out of hand this was a runaway train He wasnt trusted with anything He had been relegated to being the executive consultant on the movies They paid him very well think that may have been enough He had a big corner office in the Hart building He pretty much spent his days in correspondence with people from all over the world who had become Star Trek fans So they gave him this emeritus status and he was a has been Arnold The Summer of a special summer Star Trek about to come out twentieth anniversary about to happen and everything seemed to be building towards this peak The studio had decided to start developing a new series Without Gene Without Gene The president of the television group was a guy named Mel Harris He called me one day and he said Were gonna do a new Star Trek The studio came to him and said we want to start a new series Gene wasnt all that excited about doing another Star Trek for Paramount And so created this series and Gene went Whoa wait no He saw the studio as an adversary Gene and the studio it was a war It really was Gene says No youre not doing Star Trek without me its my property Gene had the power Arnold They werent going to proceed And he said Well damn it can do it Finally after years of trying to convince him to do a new Star Trek series he agreed He didnt mean to go in there and come out with a new series in development He was looking forward to retirement in just a couple of months Gene agreed and we had a very very contentious negotiation with Genes lawyer from Bullhead City by the name of Leonard Maizlish Oh Leonard Genes wacky attorney Who in himself could be a movie of the week chuckles He was not the nicest person in the world lot of people hated Leonard can recall one day when Leonard was almost clutching his chest and m saying hope you die personally never had problems with Leonard Gene wanted to be the good guy so the lawyer got to be the bad guy Leonard was carrying the wrath of Gene for all these years because Gene felt he had gotten screwed on the original series Paramount owns the rights There was never any dispute about that but Gene Roddenberry is the creator of Star Trek Gene had as much celebrity as the show itself actually thought he was imperative to the of a successful reboot of Star Trek So what happens needed Gene Roddenberry and needed to make a deal and Leonard Maizlish knew exactly where he had me Pike Look his job was to represent Gene Roddenberry and as tough as he was he did a hell of a job at doing that We made the deal giving Gene a compensation package that was sufficient to Gene and to Leonard Paramount would still own the property Star Trek but Gene would take his fair share out And by the way it was a handsome share So Gene said yes to doing a series and then suddenly hes startled by his own statement Yeah dont think he was prepared for what that meant And he wasnt a fit man Gerrold Every weekend Majel would pour him onto the train and send him to La Costa the facility where theyd dry him out Because of the drinking because of the recreational drug use he needed to clean himself up Which he did over the next couple of months As everything was being worked out the s were being dotted the s were being crossed Now it was decided all right Gene you will assemble your team Does anybody have a concept at this point No they had no cast they had nothing Do you go back and conceptualize what this show is Gene brought in almost immediately Eddie Milkis Bob Justman me Dorothy Fontana Arnold People that he had trusted and relied on heavily during the original series production We began to meet at lunch time at the Paramount commissary in the private room there Gerrold Everybody in the commissary would watch us walk in and walk into the executive dining room There goes a hundred million dollar deal on the hoof And it was fun it was really fun Arnold The fans you would have thought wouldve been Genes biggest supporters absolutely not think that a lot of the fans were very verbal about someone taking away Captain Kirk Gerrold They were angry because he didnt have Kirk Spock and McCoy in the new series and how dare he call it Star Trek had done a show called Get Smart Again which was off of the Get Smart series and think theres a big problem if you try to recreate its quicksand Crosby When got this script to come in and audition for The Next Gen and thought Oh my God dont know if this is something that anybody should be doing because it was such an iconic thing Star Trek at this point You cannot revive an iconic series you cannot replace those guys This had the markings of some little seedy John De Lancie It was both really exciting and also there was this thing in my mind of going Ooohhhh are we trying to create or recreate Ronald Moore In the s people started saying that Gene was a visionary he had this utopian vision of the future think that he started to believe that and then Next Generation became a vehicle to demonstrate this utopia remember he used to tell me that Ron Hubbard was a friend of his and that he went and started a religion Gene always thought that if he had wanted to he probably could have done the same thing Gerrold He would go to conventions and he loved being the great bird of the galaxy Who wouldnt He gave college lectures for years in the s and tens of thousands of people would show up at these lectures He was starting to believe his own publicity Isaac Asimov sent Gene a copy of his book called Asimovs Guide to the Bible Gene got very interested in learning more about humanism Shatner The research prior to The Next Generation lead him to have a thesis that if not perfection man was evolving in a humanist way In The Next Generation he tried to impart his humanistic philosophy Most science fiction that we experience today is a relatively dismal view of what the futures going to be like Gene was obsessed with the idea that the future was going to be better There was tremendous anticipation because it was the rebirth of this phenomenally successful series Barry Diller had this idea of starting a fourth network Pike And he wanted to take Star Trek and use that as the corner stone of a new network We had the commitment to do the new series and we assumed it would be a twentysix episode commitment Well at the eleventh hour they cut that to thirteen cant make the numbers work at thirteen need twentysix m not sure what to do here but let me go explore the other three networks It was a science fiction show and at that point in the mid eighties there was no science fiction on television First went to to Brandon Tartikoff it was dismissed out of hand then went to and Brandon Stoddard and he thought it was simply a bad idea The third meeting was with Kim Lemasters President of Entertainment and he said lets do it as a mini series Well that clearly doesnt work It is then when we went back at Paramount Lucy Silany who was President of distribution said Wait a minute can give you twentysix episodes Why dont you produce the program and we will take it out in firstrun syndication Well nobody had ever done a program like that in firstrun syndication Tell me what firstrun syndication is Firstrun syndication is programming that is basically sold market by market station by station on independent stations wherever they wanted to place it or on network stations outside of the socalled prime time which is eight to eleven So all of a sudden we went from a corner stone for the Fox Network to this new hybrid for firstrun syndication and by the way Gene Roddenberry believed we were going to do a network show The studio think its in their manual tells you that the director the producer and the studio are always going to be loggerheads about something Because they have different needs Because they feel that thats how they can control the cast the budget This was a lowbudget television show and it had enormous expectations How did you know that Star Trek has always been a low budget production And Star Trek always has enormous expectations Yes see Berman The first meeting that went to in Roddenberrys office the big discussion was whether it would be a onehour or a twohour pilot Roddenberry wanted it to be a onehour pilot the studio wanted it to be a twohour pilot and it was a big blustery argument Pike The premier episode we have to make a splash with and that must be a twohour episode Roddenberry didnt want to do a twohour Pike thought Gene was going to come across the table at me Were not doing a twohour and m not writing a twohour And said Gene quite frankly if you do not do this will bar you from the lot We are going forward with a twohour dont know whos going to write it and now everybody is looking around the room and nobody is saying nothing m looking to my left where my bosses are m looking to my right where the syndication people are Theres poker being played right here And nobody is backing me because when said will lock you out of this lot m not kidding you What were you thinking m thinking what if he gets up and walks out m screwed If this program were not blessed by Roddenberry we wouldve placed the franchise in serious jeopardy These millions of dollars are hanging on his yes to a twohour Pike And its more like tens of millions of dollars its a lot of money All right so you were bluffing was bluffing Holy cats And he knew was dead serious But you were bluffing was bluffing he blinked You play poker Occasionally was asked to come in by Gene and he said Would you write the pilot And brought in Encounter at Farpoint So was writing introduction of the new Enterprise the new crew the new captain obviously David Gerrold Then he says have to add thirty minutes to the script because the studio wants my name on the pilot which was a lie Gene wanted Dorothy to write the twohour script She said she couldnt do it she said cant in less than two weeks Gene on the other hand could write very well under pressure and he came back the next week with Encounter at Farpoint the twohour story which introduced the character who was not in the original story that Dorothy wrote Fontana was so totally different It was like he was thrust into that story and like John De Lancie thought he did a wonderful job And came back in other stories Right it has nothing to do with John Nothing to do with that but it was like this is not what the story was supposed to be about It was supposed to be about the mystery of Farpoint and putting this new crew together He wrote the character Yes And fleshed it out another half hour Right And then said it was a script by Gene Roddenberry Well that went to arbitration of course it was a split credit Gerrold What he had done was he had jumped her credit He was now getting half the residuals for that episode and thats in perpetuity Gene did this brilliant job of turning this onehour story into a twohour story he wrote half of it she wrote half of it He came back with a script and to this day have no idea what that episode was about But there was no way in the world was going to give any notes whatsoever to Mr Roddenberry Berman One story that is one of my favorites about Gene had to do with the casting of Captain Picard We looked at a whole bunch of people and Bob Justman had seen Patrick Stewart give a class or a lecture Bob Justman went by a hallway where he was teaching at and heard this voice reverberating down the hallway It was Patrick Stewart Arnold Patrick Stewart who was not Genes first choice In fact he kind of fought even reading him first but Bob Justman insisted so Gene did Bob Justman said You got to meet this guy this is the captain And Gene met me and understood some time some time later that Gene said Absolutely not This guy couldnt be more wrong Gene said m not going to have a bald English man playing the new Captain Kirk And dont think he quite understands the nature of my background and where d come from and what d done except that was this guy who had a lot of classical theatre experience But Gene respected that Its final casting and its Gene and Rick Berman was sitting there had my vision my vision was want Bill Shatner want a good looking guy whos young and virile We were down to three actors Mitch Ryan was number two Roy Thinnes was number three and the one that thought was interesting was Yaphet Kotto They were all but despairing of finding a captain This is silly Patrick is by far the best person that weve talked about and Roddenberry said ll have him read to the studio and this was John Pike He said ll have him read but hes got to wear a wig Patrick had a toupee that was in England It was FedExed across to Los Angeles and it was sent to me in my office He went to read along with one other actor because you never went with just one actor Patrick did a really good reading but he had a British accent and he had a really really bad toupee on and Gene says you know that number two guy that Patrick Stewart guy lets bring him back And they grabbed Patrick as he was on his way out and he had already taken his rug off Bring him in and read him baldheaded Well Patrick Stewart one of the baldest heads in the world mean theres not a hair anywhere And he comes in and he reads it and he nailed it And Gene said We got him And said Gene he doesnt have any hair we cant make the Captain a bald guy And he looks at me and goes Hair doesnt mean anything in the twentyfifth century laughs And it was remarks like that that there was no way you could counter And the next thing you know Patrick Stewart got the job Stewart About two weeks before we started filming say you know Come on Gene give me stuff want background and all of this And he said No theres just one thing have for you And he fished down and brought up this pile of these Horatio Hornblower books and said There he is thats your man and the rest he left up to me It was brilliant he didnt tie me down to anything at all except he said that The nature of the man is in this character Gerrold We were having great fun until December of And about February Leonard Maizlish moved in full time and things started to go to hell He came on the lot and got his own office When we went into production the first season Even though he was the executive producers lawyer he would hand me scripts saying these were notes from Gene but knew Genes handwriting and they were not notes from Gene The writers got ahold of this knowledge that Leonard Maizlish who was not a Writers Guild member was working on scripts Heres a guy whod never written a word in his life and he was telling writers how to write Star Trek scripts And this is very much against the Writers Guild My agent took this stuff to the Guild and the Guild filed a grievance and Leonard Maizlish got banned from the lot But then he kind of snuck back in again Wed gone to lunch wed come back Leonard Maizlish had snuck into peoples computers see that Maizlish hovering around my room opening the door peeking through like to see if was in there And just said Is there something can help you with Leonard And he leaped about a foot and a half think he thought he was speaking with Genes voice but dont think Gene ever heard the way he spoke to people Nobody liked him Gene had these wonderful relationships with people who had worked on the original series like Dorothy Fontana and Leonard was horrible to Dorothy In particular didnt like him Leonard Mezlish was running around hiring people Maurice Hurley Bob lewin neither one of which knew anything about Star Trek but were immediately promoted above me and Dorothy Why are people being promoted above us We are the ones who should be the show runners the producers here found him to be an unsavory character Hes standing right next to an open window no screen no anything and m thinking it would be so easy to push that bastard out the window it would be so easy Say it again David go do it Go push that bastard out the window theyll give you a medal Pike remember there was this huge screening in the executive conference room at Paramount Pictures and all the hitters and everybody that was important and up we put on the big screen Encounter at Farpoint Everybody looked at it and they were visually knocked out at how stunning the twohour looked As had looked at it and wondered what is this about what in the world is that thing that looks like a big jellyfish It didnt even really have an ending and it was a smash Did you realize that The Next Generation it was possible to characterize it as Gene Roddenberrys dream of heaven would never have thought that at the time but now that were talking with his conception of the future and human beings in the future and is God mean just look at the character look at everything about the character Gene was a well known atheist but he invents Typical so typical Savage life forms never follow even their own rules As sit here its pretty startling Gods a character a literalized character On Star Trek The Next Generation By an atheist By an atheist Very interesting Stewart had never filmed in Hollywood in my life before had no ambitions to film in Hollywood didnt know how to wear these costumes didnt know how to speak or move or sit but was going to work and work and work and work would always be prepared would know my lines when came on set Frakes Sir Patrick took the work very seriously and if we fooled around which we would do we meaning the Americans of the cast and if he was not in the mood he would let us have it Stewart thought there was a lack of concentration and focus on the set That people were taking this far too lightly We would sing and we would dance and we would wrestle Bill Youre acting like you didnt do this No Oh Bill Okay so heres of the of you are singing and dancing No Maybe not at the same time Sackett People did not realize the closeness that we had We did have a long lasting personal very intimate relationship that developed over fifteen years This was his final chance and he knew it pretty much That this was his last gasp because it is hard to go back to do something you had done twenty years before He was feeling the need for some support and he wasnt getting it from anybody except Maizlish Once Leonard Maizlish was there wasnt even invited to meetings anymore So it was like okay no longer have input on the show why am here We keep hearing Maizlishs name what was the magic there There was none No but why was he there To help Gene In what way To keep him protected wouldnt say that he was the puppet master of Gene but Gene was not just having his doubts about his ability to write but he was also having some health issues Gene started experiencing a series of mini strokes But it was one meeting when the other producers and and Gene were in Gene got up to turn and he literally went in a circle and slammed into a wall Genes energy level was so up and down and Genes direct activity with the show was so mercurial it was all over the map By that time Gene was his condition was deteriorating worse and worse And people were being fired left and right and screaming matches in the hallway and all kinds of insanity was going on And so the leadership that you needed from your executive producer was not there We were shutting down sometimes because there was no captain of the ship at that point There was a power vacuum Very much so Hurley get a call from Paramount saying come and meet Roddenberry we want to consider you as a writer for Star Trek The Next Generation said thats a joke thats a joke But want to meet Roddenberry Who wouldnt wanna meet Roddenberry was coming off two cop shows was coming off Miami Vice very good show Equalizer very good show So he gives me the first episode to rewrite We pass each other in the hallway four or five times a day he wont look at me Apparently Gene didnt like what he wrote It was probably the first time we heard them battle And he raises up behind his desk this great birdlike creature and he points his finger at me like this and he says You dont know the difference between shields and deflectors And that went on for weeks What did that say to you about what you were confronting He didnt want me Hurley the writer He didnt want me to write me he wanted me to write him Hurley Genes ideas about the future and about man are wacky doodle He sees us now in our infancy where we just gather and accumulate like a threeyearold in a crib thats mine thats mine give me this you cant have that need this need that He believed that mankind in the twentyfourth century had resolved all conflict between themselves That developed between the first Star Trek and the second Star Trek Gerrold Back in the s Gene wanted to be the womanizer and always gets the beautiful woman and always punches out the bad guy and always wins And in Gene is not going to be down there on the front lines punching but he will be the allseeing advisor the wise man Genes conception on Next Gen is almost heavenly in that everyones at peace Hurley It takes away everything you need for drama in Genes wacky doodle vision of the future Shatner The real trouble in year one is the dictums how to get a good script out If you tell a writer that the characters cant have conflict between them youre just cutting his legs off Some writers chaffed against Genes vision of a better future where there was no conflict The essence of drama is conflict There was no evil Theres no money anymore There was no jealousy Theres no fighting anymore No separate individual goals or ideas We couldnt negotiate No tension what liked the dramatic constraints it put on me as a writer Really Well had to find new ways to tell stories When you look at the original series theres a lot of conflict between those characters They argue a lot and crewmen on the Enterprise are yelling at each other If our people are perfect and have no conflicts or problems between them there is no story here We would walk around in each others offices going dont know how to write about that dont know how to write about perfect people That was Genes vision of Star Trek The Next Generation take it or leave it and work within it or dont The dictums gave the writers a lot of stress and struggle and then in most cases Gene would just take the scripts and rewrite them And these writers were not used to that and that was very frustrating and a lot of writers left And the turnover that first season was thirty writers and staff members left the show The first season of a show with that kind of turnover There was a writer who wrote an episode he was a huge Star Trek fan he was so excited Gene called him to say congratulations and Gene told him how great it was The next day Gene came to him and said m sorry friend but were going to have to part company and he thought Oh my God Gene is leaving the show And then found out the furniture in his office had been moved into the hallway and thats how he found out he was fired and he lasted about a week Crosby know that the fans were always surprised that this wasnt some glamorous redcarpeted moneythrownatus affair On the first year On the first year Your trailer was so bad you didnt want to go back to it It had no air conditioning No bathroom no wash basin no telephone They were those little Jerry Lewis boxes remember on the steel wheels Things that they dug out of some back lot that no one had probably been in since You remember those do used to look at them from afar Of course you did We were a syndicated science fiction series we were down the status ladder at Paramount would go to Rick and say This is how much money weve got to spend per episode They werent throwing a lot our way in terms of any perks If was in trouble financially could go to Rick and say Rick need two million dollars this year Can you find it And he said ll get it for you used to go and steal food from the set of Cheers You mean there were no craft services table Not really Rick at the end of the year on the numbers We would literally have sliced tomatoes and Cremora So this made you think what Well you feel like the illegitimate bastard in the back lot Hurley Gene at this time in his life didnt really care about the management of television its a sausage factory You got to turn out a sausage every day He would come up with a story say this is the story we want to do then when that story was written out hed want to tear it up and throw it away Oh no got a better idea Gene would read a script three days before shooting and decide he didnt like it If you throw this story away because this one is different but not better the machine breaks down Because this has to go to the stage and we have to have something to shoot on Monday Meanwhile we had a production meeting and everything had been set for this episode and suddenly we were having to make changes So wanted to leave He said m turning the show over to you And said ll do the show if you leave And he said Majel and were thinking of going to Tahiti said ll buy your ticket and make your reservation And he left This trip that they took had an enormous effect on the show It couldnt have been at a worse time And thats where Berman and took his idea and ran with it Rick Berman and Maury Hurley were trying very hard to respect Genes wishes and perhaps they were doing so a little too literally If in one instance Gene said No that should be blue Suddenly everything had to be blue Gene had intended fully to step away and he found he couldnt dont think he realized things would get so out of control so quickly Maury got elevated to sort of the show runner position was a little surprised because he had never written any science fiction in his life he had done mostly cop shows People questioned Maurys ability to run a room Maury didnt like the way certain people took notes dont really care what people think mean when m doing what m doing dont care m going to do what m going to do and thats the way it is First thing he did was he took Bob Lewin and he moved him to a tiny little office on the ground floor and took all of his power away and didnt like that at all grew up in a show business family and ve seen all of the bull shit and dont like it The power pull The politics and the back stabbing and all that stuff All for For personal power Maury was really trying to stick with Genes plan and think was a lot of resentment about that too because a lot of people would come in and they had their own ideas And you know Gene didnt want anybody to have their own ideas this was his world No writer could come in and give me an idea that would accept no matter how great the idea was if it broke that concept wrote this thing called Conspiracy and was intentionally trying to shake things up and do a different kind of story was the keeper of the grail and nothing was going to change it Maury came back to me and said its not Star Trek its too dark its got a dark ending its unhappy its this and that and he turned it down Somebody overruled him and maybe it was Rick Berman but somebody loved the script and that it was exactly what we should be doing but Maury and had a very bad relationship from that point on Stewart In that first season wed had Denise go half way through the season which was just such a screw up Episodes would go by and d maybe say Aye aye Captain She was such a popular character Now Denise Crosby clearly is not Katherine Hepburn but you know the camera really loved her used to ask them to do a mock up of my legs and just put them up there on the bridge Youd have to come in for a shot was always there fifteen hour days just standing on the horse shoe The actor inside of me was beginning to chew on my own arm And Denise quit after twenty some odd episodes to become a motion picture star When think about the Israeli Palestinian negotiations think about you know sometimes they seem to negotiate the way the studio was negociating with Denises people and it ended up with her just going dont think you can sustain a show where the characters are not accessible to the audience Where you dont see somebody over coming a flaw if theres no conflict and no tension between people then theres no relationship between people and that show will wither And thats what was happening tried to make it sustain wanted to create this new adversary The Borg want the Federation to form allies against this overwhelming awesome adversary At the end of the first season theres an episode called The Neutral Zone which was the arc for the second season and the arc for the second season was going to be here come The Borg At the end of the second season they defeat The Borg Then what happened Writers strike End of the first season writers strike begins Couldnt talk to the writers couldnt talk to Roddenberry And the hiatus dragged on and on and on it was five and a half months Stewart remember having lunch with a couple of executives from Paramount and they were saying Its really bad and think your show will be one of the first to be canceled its looking so bad And had already adjusted to the idea that maybe wed get two or three years out of this show Suddenly the strike was resolved and we went back and we started the second season very late and we started it without Gates Shatner The end of the first season Paramount Studios was more than happy that their gamble on the rebooted series was paying dividends but on the inside behind the scenes oh the in fighting the chaos and the power shifts was about to get worse And in the center of it a man that ve worked with and deeply admire Maury Hurley Shatner Tell me the story of Gates McFadden Shes let go at the end of the first season and then shes rehired Tell me how that happens At the end of the first season Hurley became the successor to all of the other writers and was going to be coming back as the head writer He felt very insistant about a new doctor Gates McFadden Coming out of academia having done a lot of stage direction and being in New York theatre was used to you can sort of say what you think about something and youre respected You fight your argument and then you either win or lose He just didnt like the way the character of Doctor Crusher was working out Thered been a few issues over that first season about Doctor Crushers character and think they thought at times that Gates was a little bit high handed and you know maybe being a little demanding never experienced that had heard that somebody said its either her or me you know one of us has to go She was adored and suddenly she was gone We ended up casting Diana Muldaur who was a pretty wellknown actress at the time That never quite worked Why Just didnt get on with the cast all that well and the character of Doctor Pulaski never quite solidified It was awkward a lot of the time Muldaur They were not that interested in renewing me and was certainly not that interested When worked with you we had scenes because it was all actors By the time you got to Star Trek The Next Generation it was a vast technical world that had some characters placed in it At the end of the second season remember feeling like Maury was getting very frustrated Gene would allow things to come into the show that were against his own concept and would go ballistic Maury had kind of gotten the show back to where it had fallen apart because of the writers strike Hurley He said This episode is good want to do this episode And then hed say This episode is crap When have to fight Roddenberry about maintaining the integrity of his concept know ve lost the fight He didnt seem to want to be there anymore think he was tired think he was tired of fighting whoever he was fighting And egos kicked in in the second year Big time Mine as much or maybe more than anybodys get a call from the set Patrick Stewart wont read this line There was an argument and it went on a little bit too long Patrick got a little angry So now its this Its the producer and the actor And he sort of said if you guys dont get out of here m getting out of here say to Berman Fire them all ll build the second season on the absolute tragedy that the Enterprise exploded by unknown cause And lost everybody and now we must find the new Enterprise crew Systems are off line Core breach is eminent All hands abandon ship Repeat all hands abandon ringing Rick Berman called me one day and said Weve got a problem Patricks very unhappy Hes creatively not being satisfied said ll fix that said Have Patrick come over and meet me for lunch today want to make sure that he is in costume itll be a one oclock lunch happened to have a table in the back of the executive Paramount dining room At one oclock the commissary is packed so intentionally said to my assistant at the time Maris let me know when its one fifteen She said youre meeting Patrick at one oclock said let me know when its one fifteen Youre a game player Patrick walks in promptly at one oclock goes back to the table in costume sits down by himself and now has to wait for fifteen minutes And walk up and m out of breath and say Patrick lets just cut to it do know that you are not creatively not being taxed Youre going to have to bear with us for a couple more weeks but weve already put the script in the works and we will write your character out Now m looking at an actor who isnt even blinking What are you talking about The one thing dont want is my lead actor unhappy Lets just cut through this thing no harm no foul d like to thank you John thats terrible Patrick Stewart and never had another discussion after that was interested in the comment that John made because dont recall that meeting very well recall another meeting which was very different We were advised by the studio that Good Morning America would be coming into town they were going to film on the set of Cheers and they were going to film on the set of Star Trek said No screw you We are working hours a day to persuade people that we are living in the twentyfourth century and were out in space They basically said Theres nothing to be done youre just an actor said Okay can we lay down some ground rules Taking this stuff very very seriously for the sake of our fans No gags no jokes no Klingon jokes no fooling around And they said No no absolutely not Theres going to be nothing like that And so walk onto our set the show is going out live just in time to hear them say And now were going over to todays weather forecast now heres your weather man wearing my uniform Hes wearing the captains uniform wont repeat what said but walked off the set Were live were live youve been announced were coming here said you m out of here had hardly been home more than a few minutes before my phone rang phone ringing John Pike wants to see you in his office at two oclock this afternoon stood in front of his desk and was basically read the riot act He said d let the studio down d embarrassed the studio they were trying to keep it out of the press and we finished the conversation and was about to leave and he said By the way off the record totally understand why you did what you did And said Thank you John The first best thing was when took over Roddenberrys idea That was the first best thing that happened The second best that happened was when they didnt pick me up for the third year When left the gate at Paramount was laughing said this is insanity have just left the coo coo house Just go down to Paramount youll find a great bird of the universe only no body knew he was a coo coo bird Moore First and second seasons of Next Generation are almost unwatchable in almost all honesty Theyre very plot driven and very alien of the week The shows are kind of creaky and dont work very well But there was some crucial concepts that were done in the first couple years some things that would reverberate through the entire series Like The Borg the idea of the holodeck in my opinion was Genes greatest invention in the Next Generation it was very ahead of his time Making a show is difficult under any circumstances especially early on but the story telling got sharper As it went on As the show found itself It had the advantage of having a great brand behind it before it started People were giving it more of a chance to last longer than a show that had no brand recognition whatsoever The fan base kept the show on the air for those first two rocky years And thats an amazing salute to the audience thats out there for this material They were going to stick with it they were going to stick with it and believe it was going to be better The ship had tilted you know all the way over on its side already and Rick was just at that point tearing his hair out The first day walked into someones office and they said come into this bathroom used to have a big board that was in my bathroom And there on the wall printed out was the name of every writer who had gotten fired so far in the first two seasons How many names It was a lot of names on a show that was only around for two seasons have the third season fixed in my head as being a time when there was a change in style Berman Michael Pillar was a writer who had written on a number of network television shows and a very rigid producing writer when it came to the process and he believed that the process that existed prior to his arrival was a mess Shatner In the context of the way Maury Hurley ran his room How was the room that Michael organized Ira Behr was sort of his number two and Ira was the guy in the trenches with us Michael had never run a show Michael wanted me to deal with the writers Michael stayed in his room as often as he could to do re writes When finally got a script of my own to write came up with this idea of this pleasure planet Captains Holiday the visit to Risa its the only planet name actually remember Patrick kept saying the trouble with the show is theres not enough fing and fing Fighting and fornicating And said have a feeling our audience might like to see our captain just getting blown away by meeting somebody new The writers were real excited Well Rick says Youve got to go in to see Gene So go in and hes very nice but he says like the idea of pleasure planet and want it to be a place where you see women fondling and kissing other women and men hugging and holding hands and kissing and we can imply that theyre having sex in the background Huh really m going Oh man m in the freakin twilight zone go back to Rick he goes Pft pay no attention to that just get the captain laid think Gene knew that there had been this subtle erosion of his authority and power The equation moved from Gene Rick Michael to just Rick and Michael because Genes health had started to fail and he was less and less involved They knew there were workarounds for things they wanted to have done And Michael along with Rick found a way to make the show work better Michael refocused the show he said this is all about our characters this is a war story this is a Picard story this is a Data story How is this episode going to affect one of our people and make it a characteroriented show in that sense And that fundamentally shifted the direction of everything Michael Pillar whos very adept at creating conflict between characters that was so organic that you didnt question it Data And what Klingons do to their children Data am not talking about parenting am talking about the extraordinary consequences of creating a new life Does that not describe becoming a parent sir Moore When started in third season we were still the bastard step child of Star Trek All we were still getting was Picard isnt Kirk and theres no Spock And we were the pretenders and we werent Star Trek and theres only one real Star Trek and that was the one with Kirk Spock and McCoy Even though Gene was running it How did you feel when you heard that there was going to be a new Star Trek Did that piss you off Seriously had a twinge Absolutely it was a sense of loss When heard Star Trek and my name isnt associated with it had a twinge to saying Youre now the captain to Patrick It wasnt until after The Best of Both Worlds cliff hanger that you felt the whole thing shift and suddenly we were Star Trek am Locutus of Borg Reistance is futile Your life as it has been is over Mister Worf fire But what was genius is that it took Picard who compared to Kirk was an administrator more than an adventurer and by cutting him off and turning him into a Borg it kind of gave his humanity back to him Making the man more human and vulnerable and prone to error and mistake was a great decision When came in sensed that there was a transition going on Gene was beginning to phase out and Rick was ceasing power Rick was generous and allowed me into some of his thinking and some of his longterm planning and to just talk in a relaxed way about the future of the series which d never really been able to do with Gene Everybody that worked there could see the deterioration of Gene is his walking his talking and his ability to kind of communicate had changed drastically When a powerful figure like a king or an emperor has their faculties erode and therefore their power erodes that diffusion of power Eventually think Rick Berman solidified the power he replaced Gene Gene was clinging to the world he had built trying to make it the most beautiful thing it could be vision of humanity and think he became far more obsessed with his legacy then he was with his history of a storyteller The guy who created Star Trek why in trains with the stars As his health failed as his faculties were failing got sense from a man that things were simply slipping away from him We had been sitting watching dailies after lunch and Michael Pillar pulled every body into his office and every body came from the set knew something was up but didnt know what it was and had a really bad feeling and he announced that Gene Roddenberry had died that morning Shatner Genes passing brought an end to an era but also gave a new group of talented writers and producers an opportunity to take the franchise to new worlds If we had not shifted from plot to character in the third season the show wouldve continued but dont think it wouldve broken through the way it did think it wouldve been that other series that they did of Star Trek and get the feeling that Star Trek would of kind of stopped there wouldve been a Deep Space Nine there would not have been a Voyager and so on and certainly not more movies If he had not come back and done The Next Generation think there would be people that would say that Gene Roddenberry was a very lucky man who was a failed producer who had one show that did well for three years and thats what they would limit his legacy to sort of discounted him in a way Everybody did They all did most people get one shot have one triumph Gene had one it was elusive and so when this one came back again Hold tight Hold it dont let it get away from me Stewart ve enormous respect for his achievements for many of his unique ideas and beliefs Berman think he really believed in this positive vision of what man kind was capable of And you subscribed to that vision subscribed to that idea all throughout all the different shows that we did because believed that owed that to Gene think at his best dont think Gene wanted the franchise to fossilize into this you know theres no way out youve just got to recycle everything over and over again it was too rich a franchise there was too many possibilities should have done this a long time ago You were always welcome So card stud nothing wild and the skys the limit Shatner The sky is the limit in its seventh and final season five shows were nominated for nine Emmys and the series as a whole was the first syndicated television series to be nominated for outstanding drama series To this day The Next Generation is the only syndicated drama series to be nominated in this category Not so wacky doodle after all music playing
