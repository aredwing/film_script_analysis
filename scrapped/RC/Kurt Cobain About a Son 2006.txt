the guitar it became so obsessed and for me there fissai cos many years every day for a few hours in the evening before you sleep the guitar was the only thing did wanted to make Punkrock for a long time because was a subscriber Creem Magazine then was in the room to make pretend Punkrock sound or what was Punkrock guitar At the end Similar It just noise Noise agreements made by and screams felt that the Punkrock could be this When moved once from Aberdeen to Montesano which is Km from Aberdeen a village Sizewood knew Buzz Osborne ndt the Melvins whom pass a little compilation of Punkrock of on tapes made by him wanted us some days to assimilate wanted me pleasure it was like another world suddenly felt stuff from another planet felt like if speaking so the most clear and realistic of the usual texts Rock n Roll By the end of the week was a selfdeclared Punk rockerJournal cos Pleased that approached the Punkrock at that time because said that those years used to grow and to make fire my values and what kind of person am In reality become Punkrocker aliment my selfesteem because Help me understand that not had become a Rockstar not wanted become Rocka star instead not can diventarla because lack the balls So m always conflicting with these positions swings yet to not importarmi not wanting and not power still trying to affermarmi with others knew to do something special to have something to offer and knew that would have had the opportunity to show people could write beautiful songs or at least contribute something musically When you Krist met remember having seen in high school a little times and that it wanted certainly know But have not ever seen if not in meetings Partecipava always somehow skit and it was just a type intelligent beautiful and burst It was blatant that wanted to form a group and find people with which to play while Krist did not want So did the demo Fecal Matter with Dale ndt Crover Melvins trying to Krist to make you feel what not decided never to do Finch is a day pass by me and told me finally heard your tape Not Evil We are a group It was the hour So the group begin cos You had never done a jam together When did cover of Creedence Clearwater did Jam in the big house from Krist in Aberdeen which was very big It was freddissimo a Met winter and in the walls you saw the holes from which passed the air Then found work the Polynesian Resort leaned over It was a shit The hated But could not work more than time because mainly spazzavo the chimneys of each Chamber of and therefore could not know where was during my hours daily Often no one was using the fireplace then pulivo some fireplace correvo in here and l and then slept for a few hours and watched Just a beautiful job Unfortunately it insospettirono and began monitorarmi to and beccarono Since Cos Th have always been extremely lazy especially at work Not Work in s And try to stay away from other colleagues have always had a terrible relationship with colleagues do not own agree with people in the media give nuisance give the cos nerves time can not to ignore them must face and tell them that the hatred or not even speak For almost all winter did not have a place to live Dormivo on sofas people or in a box the veranda of Dale Anywhere It was ganzo perch was convenient sleep on sofas people because finivo for buy beer and that night bevevamo and restavo l that night and the day after was from another party Facevo tour the houses of all After a couple of months for was not the most welcome and was in misery Dormivo often under a bridge and was also one of winters most coldest weather memories cold bestial remember that walking all day without goal and finivo always in the library ho past agonize read waiting for the end of the day was proud of me to be able to survive without a job was living the life by Punkrocker Version Aberdeen It was pretty easy Nothing compared to that that happens to the children fleeing in big cities Chiedevo continuously to my few friends to move with me in Seattle wanted to go in Seattle because there was life But none wanted to go and alone was afraid was in poverty pi total always somewhere small and sudicio For Was fun was a bachelor for the first time All alone Your mother said that you were happy when you trasferisti in that place Well perch Had a group felt independent remember that years ago asked Eric Shilinger How could success have a group if incrociasse the Black Sabbath with Beatles What would be want to do all types of music want to do a little such as Led Zeppelin but move from Punkrock extreme the songs insulse It seems to me impossible because nobody would understand the same group At that point understood that We had a unique style do not think that we were quite original asked many people and we thought often interesting perch many people to which ask Not surprisingly Kurt in that period meet Not a fregava cock of what we thought the other No We certainly thought that that people would have thought my music because knew that in order to do ci wanted had to get a base of fans would not have used these terms at the time do not understand how does the music and as you pull on the public We began to do what seemed to us at all costs and there fregava a cock if not liked even if trying to accontentarli beginning to see what happened Oh just mentioned our first concert It was at a friends house of Erin in the woods What fun They were all so afraid of us who hid by us in the kitchen We had taken all the rest of the house There were toxic hidden in cooking because did cos much noise cos we were drunk Dolly and Tracy pomiciavano and saltavo above the table and accarezzavano We are aware ridiculous Obviously by late in the evening most of the girls present were convinced their engaged in stonfarci It time to make the suitcases and disappear boys Divenni obsessed by turtles and bought or and put in a bathtub bath in the living room They are very docile Do not move not show feelings cos inanimate m the idea most stupid for a pet They are the exact Unlike dogs Do not hate dogs They try too get pleasure and you can do everything like cats and animals that require attention Of which you must take care and that in return have a attitude of vaffanculo They are locked in a bathtub m from disgusting you hate and esibir for you Those shells are not of great help They are sensitive and if there peaks feel pain Not That much protection one imagines that one They can fall back break and die always liked go to Olympia because was a wave of culture There was a real scene Something unique that could not be find elsewhere in the United States For three years was gone a lot of a school on weekends to see groups and stay with friends began to go out with this girl Tracy and we put together and we moved along with Olympia found there in this town with all the attention to art lived for the first time in a town with culture It was an experience magnificent felt relieved Everyone seemed to share the same ideals and the same reasons It was a community of strambi Students were outcasts even from the world Punkrock of but listened strange stuff and were influenced from The Shaggs and the Velvet Underground and the Garage Rock had to thank the Records and new music was introduced as the Vaselines and a lot of European music especially British as the Young Marble Giants and the Clean axe did accorgermi which were years not ripensavo to my childhood had tried to remove it did reconsider and draw good memories Reminders of innocence So made tatuare the symbol of Records to remember childcare To remember remain child It was become a utopian place where all scopavano you and there were events improvised where groups played stranissimi in places come on the scales of corridor of a building or somehow alley Everything was oriented towards the community Everybody gave a hand with each other and played with everyone groups of the other Their goal is not was the success or do disks or go to tour They were satisfied if played between them Inventavano groups which were not real groups They were jam with friends But m not there integravo well with them because tuttosommato were boring One of the things fiche type bohemienne Olympia was that there were festivals where none drank or drogava but took the coffee and a rose and esibiva Andavo to these festivities and not happening nothing All l Seating hear the music while optavo for ascoltarmela alone lived in my world art imaginary in Aberdeen and did the same to Olympia Not That a aimed at Olympia was blossomed and had begun to attend the rounds and to participate in cultural life but traevo benificio standomene anyway on the sidelines Restai a Monaco have always cos been Still Closed at home Passavo week without leaving home What do you Tracy thought this your closure from the world without doing anything There has never been conflicts between us because knew that would be was equally happy a car or live in in a substep The few times that propose cercassi a job rispondevo Now go and m going in the car And then replied No it should be well It is well at home He had just one maternal character He had to take care of things and people It was in four to spend on me Andavamo shops and if there was something wanted and did not have the money would have preferred not take it but she took and the then taking me out to dinner It was thick This me feel guilty because ate often outside was always looking for someone who was artistic with whom can share things artistic and with you was impossible So together did things to husband and wife Activities Typical of torque American Media as shopping and eat had a strange attraction Magnetic for flies The flies attracted me svegliavo the morning and these flies me kept awake for hours Ronzavano and rimbalzavano on the face attacked continuously and always been so In summer once while living with Tracy every morning bombardavano and decided to attack moschicida paper but it bought and are each So had type hung above the bed Anywhere And the apartment was great Charter moschicida everywhere He is very Deathrock have all these flies death hung have always furnished my house with gusto was not the type to be put crucifixes on the wall It was always a pair but those beautiful did a lot of artistic stuff at that time how to take models of skeletons and ricoprirli clay making them become small dolls Then the vestivo Scioglievo candles and we did scenes of nativit Roba ridiculous Copiai a lot cassette and the spedii to all labels would think with small gifts inside or letters Condoms used with ants inside Formichine plastic Coriandoli This was for find a label Th have sent to Touch and Go a to Alternative Tentacles At all Touch and Go will avr send It was the label that wanted most of all because were the my favorite groups thought that we were like groups as Scratch Acid and Big Black and the Butthole Surfers Three of my Favourite groups At that time the Hardcore had died was quite the Speedmetal Odiavo that shit And the only solution was to do stuff cheerful or newwave as did at the beginning The Scratch Acid cos liked time was perch their songs were a pop and very simple you took us as a piece of Aerosmith scombussolato but and why did What wanted to do had developed Krist a hatred for Seattle and for the people of Seattle simply for our need of not belonging There were never felt part of something and suddenly be accepted in a scene or one company would not be normal state for us So we in costruivamo head these things and we talked always evil in Seattle It was cos Degrading be seen as a guy Aberdeen that played rock and that he did not know even the wipers Then they listened years alone The scene Was not intense as we expected or we wanted it to be They are not grown in Seattle and not the Highbourgeois fought against this thing at all times People were good with us but not ammettevamo We have known Jonathan ndt Poneman of Sub Pop in a bar and Krist was drunk by morning We met at and Krist was drinking by It was sbronzo and fradicio cos aggressive which was impossible to speak business with Jonathan because Krist it was aimed and pull rutti and ran shooting to scream something to customers in the bar What you have to look cock With his vociona He realised ridiculous It was buffissimo One of the things most funny that have ever seen Jonathan was ready to get up and leave do not recall even if we found an agreement that day Krist was too disruptive Do not made anything believe that the influence of Sub Pop and what we tried to do we did think about what to do ourselves Acoltavo the individual of Mudhoney and stuff of that kind think we influenz In strip our style and write a pop song We had pop songs There were many things we wanted to do we wanted to experiment and vary with the hard Bleach but there was cos so pressure from Sub Pop which was not fig do if you were a pop Punkrock group and wanted to mix the two things But was intimidated by the possible reaction of the public if had done the stuff a little pop had done so Load philosophy bohemienne musical revolution Having lived in Olympia that started to prove resentment wanted that people do not cos take cock seriously All seem in dellUtopia search in the scene Underground but there are so many factions that if we do not can unirne even a couple and to make them stop bisticciare on each smallness on which no disagree then as cock claim to have an effect on the masses Well my group was in a situation in which we expected that combattesse in a revolutionary against the machine of corporate And thought How dare cock a dispute cos under pressure stupid Tell more about that when sapesti gave Love Buzz on the radio and that while expecting guidavi that the mandassero and finally you have approached and you have called the station you requested the song and you had to wait in machine that mandassero because were for losing the signal remember As was to hear Your piece on the radio Fantastic did not believe that would be never arrived at that point thought had a group and that would have done a demo But my feeling piece on the radio was more than what was wondering Great It was like having success immediate and fame well beyond my hopes or my voluntary But at that level once had a taste thought it was ganzo and that wanted to hear My other recordings on the radio Managing to pay the rent with this group would have been wonderful We were poor Prendevamo a night if played But we saw for the first time the and we were a group and guadagnavamo enough to survive It was fantastic Great Libert Total did not believe that there would be could go better than what The rest of my life would have been playing and turn for the premises and interview any time my pieces on the radio and live in a apartment After a short called by all these corporate brands and you were served and revered by all We were pretty good with the labels and we brought to dinner two three times It was that we wanted remember went to Capital because was cos disgusting who finished for go met meeting There was enough of a taste their radio programmer type Texan It seemed ready to stonfare someone God that fear He asked me Well That Song Polly youre beating the stronza replied Absolutely Then came two other big radio programmers and said We Tickets for the Lakers It lifted all in feet to rejoice Capimmo that was not the tag for us Friend let us not kid ourselves We want to become the star To tell the truth That we wanted to hear because not at that point believed to have opportunity band almost Alternatively shit from anybody Pensammo the idea of have an impact from commercial and did not appear what As unreal a year earlier All that quellinverno passed along and Dave in that small apartment was the period pi depressing of those years It was cos Fottutamente small and dirty and cold and gray Every cock day almost the madness do not reggevo was cos Bored and cos poor There were months that we had signed with Geffen and we did not have a penny We had to commit the amplifier and just to have the money to buy the Corn Dogs He was having stranissimo signed with this corporation multimilionaria and be completely green was tired of live in Olympia without anything to be done The place had not pi nothing to offer me need to relocate Of go to Seattle Usavo much heroin What mean by much Mah once per week do not know none Once called Krist as a fact and told him drogavo and worried He and Shelley drew to tell me what love and who do not want droghi It been a nice gesture My stomach for was getting worse noticed during nero American tour They are heartburn nausea the worst sore stomach imaginable and it hurts feel a heart in stomach and suffer feel that inflamed in a region Towards Met meal when the food arrives Dov inflamed begin the pain Why Food us is laying above Burn managed to go forward It happens often while eat that suffer a lot but no one notices because broke to complain In tour happens cos often because have no choice not me my facts while others have no idea that am suffering like a dog Towards Met the European tour remember having said that would not have pi toured until not risolvevo this thing wanted to kill spararmi head from what had stew can not cos live was become a schizzato neurotic was destroyed psychologically and mental problems because had pain Chronic daily When he was this For the last years arrived in point in recent two tour did not know how would have never done so to make others But since started drogarmi had the most pain How did you know Courtney have known both time ago in Portland at one of our concerts It was a quick meeting The said a sticker parlammo and a little seemed type Nancy Spungen The resembling It seemed a classic pupa Punkrock felt a little attracted to you wanted to sweep that night but and forth wanted only a little more than emotion in my life had never no known what jerk and charismatic She is a magnet for exciting events Although passeggiavamo in the street together spuntava someone who assaliva us with a knife Without reason just because seems that type of person that attracts these things felt a rebel because there went around to buy drugs a sweep against a wall and stuff of that kind Facevamo rows in public both for the sake of it Both perch Entire people of a table if it was mogia to eat It was so divertivo and it was fantastic interpret this role with a person who suddenly rose up and destroyed a glass on the table and urlava against and buttava on earth Really fun Krist is the kind that makes things but in return wants the glory It must take the reins It must receive all the attention do not Permit be nice at his own level do not ever see my humor when m with him This perch Do everything not to react if it happens do not think have ever did laugh out loud and know that it is capable to make people laugh Courtney do the always laughing and feel comfortable in being sympathetic with you and with Dave and other friends But with Krist c Some strange barrier that separates us We have always had enough respect to understand what the ferisca feelings of others and what are the defects personalit both that give us discomfort in so that we do not quarrel We have not ever offended one another not perch us cos we want well but both see the other as hypocritical with elements that disprezziamo For the good of the group does not make sense Once you are the money arrived understand what was pi under pressure from the other and accruing Various of pi am the singer and Articles are on me have to suffer all the pressure And then must also deal composition of the pieces and am also good if the others are recognized but expect at least one Financial greater recognition This was a big problem with him and Dave Credevano honestly to earn a credit equal to mine stronzate Stronzate totals was ready to dissolve the group for this thing we do not believe Often it is a nihilistic idiot fottutamente sarcastic and others are very vulnerable and sincere And Cos are the songs It a mixture of these things And Cos That are many people of my et minute sarcastici are and another are apprensivi They are still with the Monitor things that gave annoyance years ago m not necessarily personal things but also rapes violence am posted everything So all these songs speak of my battles against things that make me posted And is the theme of the album Of all my albums They say all the same thing What have this conflict between good and evil man and woman people who do things cruel to other people without reason And want them beat blooded Heres the point The only thing can do instead scream into a microphone Once read an article about me Cazzo qu Seem a depressed person and emotional sudden changes in mood And the author said to me But the six And No do not have like fun every so often And all that see as an emotional disaster Like a dark star negative People always accuse to be bad mood and ask me What And have absolutely nothing m not arrived to the point that dovermi look in the mirror and try to understand cos that sees people thought Maybe should shave the eyebrows It might help Me asking continuously went in a room a couple of months ago and a boy cos asked me Christ Kurt but perch Seems you are always angry m not angry am happy now Piece of shit Something wrong Are you sad Many people believe that if the watch and not sorrido mean run balls effort to show m enjoying Generally always fun and are almost never depressed And most easy cos Opiates me always procured that security bramavo that in which no hated cos both people could try of affection for them or at least look beyond the superficialit of their personalit and think about them as real people Maybe had problems of childhood or their environment that makes them so In short in order to appease the animosit that nutrivo towards the people needed to do so because was tired of cos hate both the people and to be always so Critical against them know it seems that defend my use of drugs Sounds like an excuse must make a drugfree period if only to see things from a point of view better In recent months was doing stuff for per day and was notice of odd in my memory and that sooner or later it would have affected my health But the truth That was pi in flesh and healthy then that now said immediately that do not pentivo do not repent This perch Used the as a means as an antidolorifico To rid the pain And reason main And in that sense do not repent But any person who becomes dependent on drugs finir for fottersi life Unless it takes a year we want two And cos Obvious have seen succeed all those who we fall It a classic The drugs are evil and you fotteranno knew that would have stopped sooner or later and marry and have a daughter is a very good incentive But many do not ce have Then a rich Rockstar milionaria and both be considered have a lot of reasons for not drogarmi but many people who will influenced by my drogarmi will be people with a job normal that already make fatigue It seems you should say that goes well if you droghi you know in fact And why have to move forward say that sooner or later if had continued drogarmi to would have lost everything What attracts you to these models transparent do not like puzzles but like the idea that unmount them fascinate the casings and bodies How it works Often spoiling But Difficult to think that a person can enter stuff harmful as drugs and alcohol in his system and that the body the bear For a while But that little astounding God it has been incredible One of the things most amazing Especially perch was not a photo was a video and we saw move It was the first time that we heard it was a living creature Incredible We saw the heart beating And the first thing that has done with your hands been the greeting metal with horns waving his arm If n Also noticed the pediatrician and us What sign of the devil Doctor Some days feel most paranoid than usual but now what born Frances are not pi Yes Simplified everything in recent years since real relations of friendship with real friends with the group ever most famous and then find a person love has solved many problems It very exciting perch what always wanted ideal It is better to me probably because find myself in a situation most stable than Courtney Find many difficulties in find confidence in herself because his character been very targeted She and her group are cos under examination It should bring out a disc incredible only to be considered decent believe that his songs are really good but very difficult convince you of this think a little people ask why deals affairs of her husband Why am too lazy to occuparmene Both would bend and put me in culo from them And forget always things and c people we campaign and exploits For me to do something from management must ask times And we bring type months At the end Courntey them calls and cries in the face Her cries the remain in the head Riattaccano and think What whore But the thing is done for the good of our children make sure that have money for the next years But we do progress m learning from her But often jumps suffered the conclusions and his weakness do not like not come taken quite seriously And the type of person seems selfish and bad but with these things very most loving me If we think or me is recalled then do it But you Always to do things for others to buy gifts And Always me compliments It something fantastic People reads various stories on Vanity Fair or Copycat but nobody thinks effect on persons to whom is happening Of course We are cock of characters in the comics Mica we have fottuti sentiments us And the people who think this can the succhiarmi cock and give me for my disc Li willingly take their money One thing did not never understood that the classic response a celebrit who complains Have you wanted a bicycle Now pedal And us That expect Six domain public and everyone has the right to know everything about you No journalist has a cock of right to ask me if drogo am not their cocks If they want to ask the music and of how write we will Obviously also the related to staff but not as people believe have always After harassed and disagree with those who say Everyone has a right to know have the right to change that perception have the right to change the way in where people think to celebrit It should be changed Should be treated as human beings and respected in matters private As believe that we can take if we are ever attacked cos They believe that we always scioglieremo fault of our actions But it would be only a reaction to that that we are cock of the press Have you ever thought to sciogliervi for this In continuation This year left the group times Officially which are to the point that not cos both the group to be affected most these consequences Moreover the attacks are all against Courtney and me Krist and Dave should not letting a cock to do The other day he Krist bed in Melody Maker that would be involved a reading of poems in England And Monitor How dare And God Krist at least not you have defined a fucking heroin who kills her newborn or forget in a taxi People there smerdano continuously They want dirt and telling lies about us do not understand never tried throughout my life to do something scandalous do peace want picchiarli to death am a firm supporter revenge is a time and a place for violence in every situation Obviously very much to lose now therefore not potr do so But have everything else of my life do not want to gain influence over in my family If ever trover Into misery and avr lost my family if find myself in front the cleft face have always been able to vendicarmi against those who break me They are the life form pi that there is ruthless Journalists Think of heads cock menefreghiste and evil The people most cruel that have ever known They are disgusting have no respect for journalists Shit Forgive me But you also do other things in life Try to find the story inside without inventarci round of lies They are the ones persons referred talking

most common to find pleasure at that point The moment the most beautiful of a band Stage the first to become really famous would like to be a band that does this every two years Take a step back whenever explodes Yes cock The best memories have of this are before the group of Nevermind It was a fun Without that want become a job What like it or not It something that love and would always do but honestly do not like pi As once when tried every night Imagine as it was Not the most as in the first two years Playing before a handful of people Load a van and go to a concert Rock Playing That privilege can not play after years Sometimes fall asleep when m tired of persons or bored if they are immersed in a group of people and do not want to be type in the backstage or during the tour in general sleep all day Prefer to be in a coma would like to wake up on stage and playing and then tornarmene in my own little world Based on the assumption that everything on stage is working and youre playing by God and everything is going to what you pass for the head Are you happy It a mixture of all emotions that have ever tried And everything Rabies Death and bliss absolute Happy as when was a child without concerns that pull the stones the cops And everything Every song feel differently And the energy that transmit the public Often m playing thinking to another and lifting her gaze Public notice that are really enjoying And makes happy Do you believe that this group durer until the next decade do not but it could It depends everything because they are good songs was surprised to find lately to work as a real unit We even wrote a piece together and coming not bad Typically me occupavo it myself But do not know how much can still do with Dave Krist and sounds of my voice and guitar would like time play with other people But Almost impossible to find people with whom go in favour and people the musically think like me And why Cos easy to play with Courtney Whenever improvvisiamo write a great song incredible because she is a person which takes the command and is not afraid of be the boss And when you have two leaders together everything worked well How wish could play with other people and create something new d prefer that to remain in Nirvana It sad to think what will the state of Rock n Roll between years feel that when the Rock will esploder dead the whole world And Gi Cos Fried and refried copied what barely alive now disgusting For the children of today are not interested in pi because once the Rock As the latest generations Now Become only a declaration of fashion and identity that children use to sweep and have a social life And at this point do not see really as the music could most have a for a teenager Useranno sounds and tones in their machines in reality virtual in order to receive the same emotions And then go to a party There Sar Machinery in reality virtual with a lot of headphones And potr Talk to the people while listening to this machine and then go to room and fuck and drink but believe above all that reality virtual sar a drug The technology we arriver And there are toxicdependent from reality virtual Li will find dead on the sofa for overdose Death in general or death by overdose In general whole life expect to death as any normal person thought cos often to kill for stomach pain that do not fregava a cock to die would be fired in the head Both true risk die for the drugs sad your story No Not really There Nothing incredible or new if for that No do not They are the product of unAmerica flawed Think about what could have been be worse my life if had grown up in another place perhaps in economic crisis There are endless things worse than a Divorce can happen to you only bramato and suffered for a something that could not have a family solid Unit family After a long time am well m happy to share this with similar cases All in all Sad that two people can not if they decide to marry and make children at least get along wonder that persons think they love can not Nor do pretend or at least have enough respect for the children to talk to the few Sometimes you meet where they take the children on the other
