Somebody warned him thats all But who Hey Take some beautiful photos of LiPuma Rest assured Captain well do a good job Who could it have been dont know but they did and he got away Did you call the district attorney disguise Yes how did you figure that out The hair much too long Has he been identified Good morning m Captain Giacomo Bonavia Traini District Attorneys office Thats Michele LiPuma a wellknown killer What happened Do you know Ferdinando Lomunno the building magnate Yes ve heard of him Thats his secretary LiPuma came in disguised and asked her to announce him to Lomunno When she heard shots she ed Anyway the disguise was supposed to give LiPuma a few seconds advantage But it didnt work out that way because they were waiting for him on the other side of the door On the other side of the door You mean Lomunnos Yes Lomunno and LiPuma were cronies from way back but they fell out after Lomunno mistreated LiPumas sister They tried to klll each other more than once LiPumas autopsy will show more than a couple of bullet scars Lomunno knew that one day LiPuma would try to take his revenge you understand Thats why he had his people waiting for him But LiPuma came from here instead of there and took them by surprise Vincenzo Arlotta from Trapani It seems he caught LiPuma from behind After that It seems that he was accidentally shot by his accomplices From here to the door crossfire Lomunnos chair And this ls an old acquaintance Dano Gaschetta from Salemi wanted for a double murder two years ago We havent identified that one yet His machine gun had jammed All characters from out of town all recently hired feel partly to blame for this Lomunno had two professional bodyguards who he trusted had them put in jail a couple of months ago When a hotshot like Lomunno has no protection he starts to have a problem breathing he feels uneasy He needed temporary help so he hired some cheap people Well you can see the mess that they made Two professional killers in prison three amateur killers dead Soto speak the maximum result for a minimum of effort Nice work Bonavia How ls It that you arent more familiar with Lomunno Why should be He moves In high circles even if he is a murderer Why not arrest him Something funny Sort of ll repeat my question why not arrest him Because dont want to be made a fool of again seeing as how ve already arrested him three times before Lack of evidence What said due to lack of evidence Due to lack of everything Do you know how much this concrete jungle has cost so far And killings Those are the ones in the cemetery great many of them are buried right here in cement But what are you gonna do tear down half the city Where do you live anyway Here in the vicinity Well watch out One of these days youll tum on the lap and blood will run out Or youll see something in a crack in the wall scrape It out and what will you see finger or an eye You live in a penthouse have three rooms on the second oor Why Sounds kind of small Youll see one of these days a friend will approach you and offer you the penthouse at very good conditions You inspire confidence Are you sure Lomunno wasnt present when the shooting took place And risk getting shot They have people that get paid for that Okay you can Okay all is in order Anyway ll take a chance on making an ass of myself again You give me a warrant and ll arrest him Youre certain that this was Lomunnos work If he was warned that LiPuma was out to get him why didnt he just Inform the police of that Thanks Instead you suggest that he set a trap For me its still not clear ll Issue a summons for Lommuno to appear for questioning Lets see what he has to say If you want can tell you say what he will say ll proceed with questioning Lommuno If you get orders from me to arrest him there wont be any lack of evidence Send me your interim report as soon as possible and the file on Lomunno Goodbye Goodbye Mr Traini Go fuck yourself you piece of shit What are you looking so happy about Me Nothing chief Its cold thats all ll repeat you need to keep all this to yourself Were up to our necks In this and want you to stay out of it No Captain m like Ivy where stick there stay The newspapers Hello Mr Traini Its me have Mr Malta on the line for you Hello Traini Good morning Mr Malta How are you Good So this shooting In Via Plebiscito a real massacre There were more than shots fired There were four bullet holes In Pumas body two of which were fatal When did he get out of the insane asylum What said When was he released from the mental hospital Who Well LiPuma You mean you havent been informed of that yet Whos in charge of the investigation Captain Bonavia Ah the best man for It introverted mulish but efficient Didnt he tell you about the asylum Yes Its In the report he sent me Michele LiPuma confined in The commitment paper was signed by his sister Serena LiPuma And when did he get out Two days ago So how would you explain why a man like that was released when he was clearly st abnormal not right in the head The Doctors declared him healthy You see youve barely been in the job any time and you already have a very serious case on your shoulders Tell me hows your mother Slightly better but she still needs more time to fully recover Is she still in Switzerland Yes in Lausanne And you hows the move to the new apartment going Quite well thanks Remember me to your mother when you write And here In this case How do you intend to proceed ll be interrogating Lomunno tomorrow It may be that a certain person found Lomunnos recent acquittal disagreeable Lomunno stood In his way Do you understand You mean that an old rival wanted him dead Such viciousness would indicate that Theres someone to see you Ah Lomunno No his lawyer Show him in Be careful hes a fox Advocate Canestraro wasnt expecting you You were expecting Lomunno know d like to see him myself He was admitted to hospital After the shooting he suffered a shock Ah and which hospital is he in dont know Well you find out what clinic and tell him want to question him Lomunno obviously has a murder trial ahead of him It only needs to be established what his relationship with the three killers was the ones armed with machine guns who were waiting for LiPuma Weve not been able to learn who they were ll make that clear we do not know who they were Therefore Lomunno has no fear of being investigated He respects the law But he ls still worried that he will be killed LiPuma was sent there to kill him Fortunately Lommuno was out of his office otherwise he would now be dead What makes you think that someone sent LiPuma there Given past events d say that Puma had enough reasons of his own to hate Lomunno Quite right So they opened the tigers cage and the tiger came out You mean to say that If you wanted to get rid of our successful builder youd have had Puma released from the asylum Me Yes or whoever else Allow me to express my surprise that a paranoid murderer could have been set free so easily Go on have nothin more to say Mr District Attorney Find your client and tell him he must come here for questioning What guarantee can you give for his safety police escort It would be better not to inform the police Ah you think that If word were to get out then the word may get wings and return in the form of a bullet Its no mystery that my client ls In the cross hairs of certain police officers Youre referring to the times that Captain Bonavia arrested him Three arrests to be exact The courts answer has been three acquittals ll let you judge What could Captain Bonavia personally have against Lomunno Yes Er There could be many reasons man can hate out of his love for justice In that case If you think Bonavia is so perfect What do you think Tell me something about him think that it ls necessary to judge a public official even by his private life And that would be Bonavia has a mistress young enough to be his daughter Thats not a crime Of course not Of course not Listen Mr District Attorney ask that you forget regulations just this once and be so kind as to visit my client because he has suffered a great shock Tomorrow morning Thank you Its been a pleasure It would be an honor for me to accompany you personally Good day Call Mr Maltas office fox Lomunno is willing to see me tomorrow morning but he has asked that visit him He doesnt want the police to know where hes hiding out Why His lawyer says that Lomunno thinks Bonavia has it in for him And assuming he does Well Lomunno is afraid that the police would intentionally let out information that would harm him Whats your opinion Traini ll go along with him even though his distrust of Bonavia annoys me The most important thing is to hear what Lomunno has to say and as quickly as possible Of course the investigation is paramount Well authorise you to proceed What about the lunatic asylum m going there today with Bonavia Clinically speaking there was no reason to keep him here Is that so In your opinion he was cured Did he often have visitors Never Not even his sister No She sent him a few packages It says here that six months ago LiPuma tried to strange his cellmate It was a unique emotional crisis but it was never repeated d like to talk to that former cellmate You promised me the other day Why wont you talk with me m not dangerous Take it easy youre sweating No dont sweat weep from my skin Where Is he Next door But can tell you that now is not a good time Should open it Ahh Who is this in my cell Why are you here What do you want Go away go away That ones But the others All assholes You what are you m just an officer of the judiciary My name ls Giuseppe Lascatelll Is that not an important name Why dont you answer me Why are you quiet You must answer me Calm yourself Pepe Okay General Do you know Captain Bonavia Ah and howl used to pass all the Information on to him while was inside They had tons of strychnine so they put the strychnine in the coffee and they got rid of a boss a spy lookout man and an asparagus Who What do you mean who Dont you listen when say something Enough Pepe Hes talking about those that have been poisoned in jail Continue There was a pipeline under the prison oor We dug a hole in the ground and petrol came out Like a geyser psss Mimi the fairy he used to sell It for us How beautiful he was And how did he get it out With the asparagus With the what What language is this guy speaking He comes In here and makes fun of my cosmic revelations m going to smash him Tell the official what you do to us instead You keep us locked up in this dump And you beat us You damn bastards Bastards Calm down Pepe Have a cigarette Its miserable In here why dont you send some women in Only faggots have a good time in here Were you a friend of LiPumas The world should belong to generous men like him He gave my son a news stand because he was my friend They kept him here the doctors kept him in here because Lomunno and his sister wanted him out of the way Bastards Wed better stop Alright d like to talk to him alone You were a police Informer isnt that right Come on Pepe have courage Scratch me behind my ear first cant stand it Puma knew you were an informer right One clay he said to me Bonavias your friend so tell him m not crazy said no Then he tried to strangle me Continue Bonavia came to ask me some questions said What did you say Go on What did you say Hmm Let LiPuma out And what did he say Impossible thats what he said Thanks Pepe Shall we go Who had LiPuma released Bonavia The doctors declared him cured Dont you believe in doctors Anyway tell me who are Lomunnos enemies Half the people In the telephone book more or less Who would you put at the top of the list Even then its hard to narrow it down His rivals In the construction business Madonna Norvese Chiaracame all those and their relatives that Lomunno destroyed economically or killed Atop up No thanks To return to Lascatelli wanted to talk with him alone because the presence of police officers often intimidate people He said that LiPuma could hardly wait to get out so he could try to kill Lommuno That could be but It surely wasnt Lascatelll who informed Lomunno that Puma wanted to klll him and had disguised himself as a guard as he couldnt have known how or where LiPuma would try it So who did inform Lommuno Perhaps m reading you wrong but think that youre thinking this was an act of personal revenge Because of the sister So you think that Puma was merely a tool of his sister Theres no evidence of that But she could be a suspect Its possible Its quite possible that the massacre wasnt just an isolated incident that the Intent was far greater than a simple personal vendetta that ll Involves Important people In conicting interests and billions of lire Shall we talk about politics Why not See the man sitting over there at that table With the light suit the mustache and the expression on his face that seems to say What have got to do with It m innocent You mean His Honour Mayor Nicotra Thats right And to his left the one with the thick glasses thats the Grisi And on his right Is the President of the regional bank Santa Croce with the Chairman of the Building Commission Remember those words Building Commission Theyre the key to everything coffee and the bill please There ls also a free seat at the table Guess who is missing Lomunno Right Shall we continue So about two years ago Nicotra and Lomunno drew up an agreement anticipating the big business that would come with the citys new development plan hmm Lets assume Lomunno bought up some unremarkable land for the price of farm land shall we say lire per square metre Now this ls where the Mayor comes into the picture Using the taxpayers money the city government for no apparent reason supplied the area with water electricity sewerage roads etc etc So the value went up from But you see the taxpayer doesnt get anything out of it you wont find any schools or hospitals in that area The pie was out up between the Mayor our Member of Parliament the head of the building commission Lomunno the bank that financed the deal and a few others There was no great risk Involved because if anybody raised any objections he was first warned then threatened and if that wasnt enough he disappeared What ls the police department doing about this Making arrests If they can What are the courts doing Handing down sentences when theyre given sufficient evidence Since when has evidence been sufficient in our courts If you want a wider picture of the situation can give it to you but you be careful of this investigation it is a very slippery path Its a trip well take together Now our starting point will be the killings in Via Plebiscito We might not change the world but our duty today right now is to find and punish all those responsible Well start by questioning the doctors at the medical institute Lomunnos personal enemies and his rivals in the construction business And what did his lawyer Canestraro have to say That Lomunno is in hiding and that no one knows the three killers who killed LiPuma He says there are those that want to kill him but he does not say who told Canestraro that he should tell him that If he doesnt show up for questioning ll issue a warrant for his arrest Youll be arresting him for the forth time And wholl free him Nobody if we do our job well man over on that table has been trying to attract your attention for the past few minutes Excuse me have to be going Bonavia d like to talk to Serena LiPuma We tried to find her No luck Keep trying Certainly My respects Mr Mayor No news on Lomunno No When Is he gonna surface You really scared the hell out of him Yes hes terrified Maybe even a little too much And how did your talk with Traini go Well see man could klll me the District Attorney could send me to jail the man who killed me could be sent to all but the District Attorney always goes free Well see whats better for him dont get it Whats better for what Not only a killer can klll a prosecutor can ensure that a troublemaker is eliminated Traini Hes in with them Calling all cars Proceed immediately to Bucciaria Okay Whats happening over there Attempted robbery In progress The suspect Is holed up in a church Hes reported to have a gun He hasnt done anything hes a good boy Leave him alone Calm down Let me through Calm down calm down Where Is he Inside Has he shot anyone No but he says hes going to Keep away or ll klll you Calm down Keep away Youre nothing but a piece of shit What are you doing Have you fired It No Have you threatened anyone with It No Captain the crowds getting restless Should call for reinforcements Dont be stupid Calm down Calm down There is nothing happening Calm clown He didnt even have a gun He was just kidding Stay back Stay calm Back Stay calm Out of the way Out of the way Get a move on And you what are you looking at fine professional am Its over Go home Have you got a match Yes d like to have seen Traini here with his expensive suit Nicola when did you get out Last month Captain Now you know dont you that its illegal to tap any telephone wires without the courts authorization Especially when the telephone belongs to the District Attorney So If transfer you back to their department do you think that you can handle it inconspicuously You still refuse to let go of it eh You still want to know who warned Lomunno Well of course can handle it Yeah who warned him and where the orders came from Well find out To your health Trainis lying He says Lomunno wont come out of hiding What does he take me for that son of a bitch This way please Go right in Ah Its very kind of you Mr District Attorney to go out of your way like this for me feel so much safer here because in a way this is home to me My client finances this institution for orphans He had a difficult childhood himself Hey come on dont want the District Attorney thinking that youre trying to make me out for a saint dont deserve It Please So here am The predetermined victim thank God because death is ugly Now am at your disposal here to answer your questions Mr District Attorney Why was Puma after you Was it because of his sister think so Or maybe because of resentment over old business dealings No never had any dealings with this guy LiPuma However when he became dangerous you had LiPuma put in a mental institute It was his sister who had him committed And she at that time was your mistress Yeah but whatever she did was under her own initiative Who told you that Puma was out that he was coming to kill you Who told me If d known would have asked the police for protection Nobody ever goes to the police Oh Thats a shame Anyhow noone ever told me a thing didnt even know those three men who were killed with LiPuma Your lawyer hinted that Bonavia apparently has a grudge against you Is that true Sure he does sure Its envy because make big money while he only gets a small salary So he spies on me my property is watched and once In a while he dreams up a charge and arrests me m sorry for him understand him You understand him and you feel sorry for him Why Because he grew up alone without satisfaction Some people drown the past In wine He drowns his in justice He is dangerous Nonsense Mr Lawyer So contrary to your lawyers opinion you arent afraid of him have bigger enemies You contradict yourself Your lawyer said you were in hiding because you fear the police And now you say you have no fear of the police So who are you afraid of There was an attempt to klll me Now m afraid to go out on the street But theres no need to be afraid Even If you assure me that a Police Captain has acted badly Youre a citizen and m your District Attorney Dont forget that Youre my what m your District Attorney And would defend you as would any other citizen If necessary Men like you give us faith in the law Getting back to the discussion though If you want to know who wants to see me dead m telling you there are a lot bigger fish than Bonavia In the business world dont want to accuse anyone But if you think for a minute whoever got Puma sprung it took money a lot of money see What else can you tell me Only what told you just now Which ls what What said Which Is not very much We havent concluded much have we Well what do you expect m the victim here Thats why want to take care of you Dont leave the city and keep yourself at my disposal Do not doubt it At your service And thanks again for going to all this trouble for me Mr District Attorney Who Is this Traini Whats he looking for Hes just looking Easy for you to say but hes likely to stumble onto the zoning law deal Ahh And youre the one responsible Ferdinando The mess youve got us Into Machine guns everywhere are you trying to start some kind of civil war And what should have said Please go ahead kill me ve been reading the headlines and don want anything more to do with it And neither do the others Is that clear Tell me something senator How did you get into your position It was because of my men village by village that you got votes got you In yesterday and can get you out tomorrow Who do you think you are senator He goes to Montecitorio makes speeches gives interviews on television but who are you You tow the line and play the game my way Calm down Ferdinando And If the game bothers you step down Take it easy Go over to the opposition For every one that leaves have ten more But you dont want to leave your comfy chair do you Take it easy Ferdinando You too and the president of the bank and the Mayor You calm down you handsome boy understand And now what are you thinking about me huh Who told you that Puma disguised as a guard was coming to kill you Guess Did you have the insane asylum watch him Or were you watching Bonavia Or maybe one of your friends Only two people know God and me Lomunno Have you gone out of your mind Lomunno Here am trying to cast suspicion onto Bonavia and you clear him What are you thinking of accusing your competitors when you know as well as do that theyre not involved Whats wrong with you You really think the believes what tell him If want him to think white its better to say black Trainis no fool Let him have the satisfaction of thinking That whatever he figures out came from his own brain with his university education Lets let our new work out his own theory let him make the connections put the little pieces together Ah youre back already Did you take her to my house She didnt want to come So where is she Shes waiting at the comer of Via Ruggero Come in come in were leaving now Good boys Serena Get In Wait there Hello Serena Good evening wanted to take you somewhere else because Its not good for me to be seen on the street For the moment What have done to displease you Your brother wanted to klll me so its not like would have had him released Imagine d forgotten he even existed You can be sure that after me he was going to go for you the name on the court document that committed him six years ago You encouraged me Have you forgotten that Thats all over with anyway Theres no point dragging the past back up again Well all right well forget It Whats on your mind What did you want to meet me for You have to go to Cleveland to see your relatives will pay Why Because there are people who are out

when you return ll see that you get a new apartment on Via Le Strasburg or by the sea whatever you want promise dear Ferdinando that can add to the collection Oh dont be like that We need to find a way to understand each other again Serena We need to rekindle that thin we used to have for each other If youre willing to give It a try well go to our old restaurant in Mondello and well talk the

Commission has stated that the lengthy Investigations Into the connections between the mafia and the political world will shortly be concluded The report will be sent to Parliament as soon as possible An Important member of the Commission commented We will not be taking any action before the report is issued This is better than a comedy Theyre saying the same things as they were when we met The people expect us to be as thorough as possible Oh erm this Is Michele Cammino Miss Lina Paladino m very pleased to meet you Likewise Excuse me Sure Nothing to smile about Cammino So The life death and miracles of District Attorney Mr Traini He must be a mummys boy he calls his mother in Switzerland constantly Shes in a hospital but we dont know why kid called and asked him for an appointment boy You think he could be a faggot Youre talking about an Important person the least you can do is call him a homosexual Are you going Well its getting late Well until tomorrow Bye Lets get back to your weak allegations say eh No doubt it Go on He called Judge Malta to tell him hed met Lomunno Lomunno accused his competitors of having had LiPuma released And did he say anything about me Bonavia is a neurotic He pursues Lomunno out of envy but Lomunno doesnt consider him dangerous Malta authorized Traini to Investigate Bonavias private life He urged him however to be very discrete because Bonavia is a public official and thus a representative of the state What else Malta authorized Traini to tap your phone Unfortunately their surveillance center Is even more effective than ours Well we had the idea first they dont know that they must watch what they say on the phone We do Was there anything else Schiro called Traini Schiro Why He asked Traini to meet him where the shooting took place Good old Schiro He is a piece of shit Whats Schiro got against me anyway Hes never forgiven you for your report which stopped him getting promoted What report When he roughed up that student during the riot at the university Oh d completely forgotten about that ll make that bastard talk You dont do anything understand Please note on March th the sum of Bonavia withdrew the money the following day Thank you Youre welcome sir Follow me please An ideal place for a crime isnt it Well if you say so Have you heard of Gianpaolo Rlzzo the trade union activist No Well he wasnt my brother nor a relative he wasnt even my friend He was more than that to me He was a young man that admired When left the village to join the police force he remained here to help the vulnerable people Do you know what It means to be a union activist around here There is a law that guarantees you a regular set wage All of you Lomunno Is cheating you all This cant continue Why are you afraid The sheep are afraid but that does not save them from the wolves The more fear you have the more likely It ls that youll be eaten by the wolf why do you hide In your houses behind the windows know you all even if you hide And know that youre all with me Lomunno robs the workers and gets rich from our sweat He who gives us bread ls our father we say But he throws us crumbs And what kind of a father ls It who brings us hunger and uses his power to fire us whenever he wants to He cant do this according to the law What law is this then If he says we must work for hours a day then we must work for hours If he says children will get lire a week then they get exactly lire He says m firing you and that is that You feed his power with your fear If we dont demand our rights whos going to give them to us Him Here he ls Don Ferdinando Lomunno here to try to make me shut up He thinks he will chase me away Listen well to what say we will make him be the one that shakes in his boots Dont work on his construction sites Friends go out on strike now No one must go back to work until he comes to terms with us The contracts must comply with the law Who are you trying to convert Youre trying to fill these decent peoples heads with your stupid ideas You talk like a criminal And m not finished yet If one spits Into the air the spit will fall back into ones face You exploit the poor people who have nothing to eat Youre the real criminals here Stick a finger In his belly and see what comes out shit What are you waiting for Arrest the shooter The first to leave the square would lose face Rizzo knew that So he stayed there lying on the ground in the square for hours even at the risk of bleeding to death That episode made Rlzzo a hero but being a hero isnt always an asset If we hold together well make em run like scared rabbits Ah heres an old friend who has dropped by to congratulate me But he is also a policeman and since my call for a strike was not legally authorized hes come to arrest me Isnt that right Giacomo have to take you to Palermo The judge will let you off with a warning warning warning telling me to mind my own business and not disturb public order You went to school why did you join the police You think Its the only way to get respect from important people believe in the law But youre going to arrest me anyway And dont tell me that its your duty How much evidence do you need before you arrest Lommuno Its just a matter of time You two are on the same side you the police and him the gangster both on the side of the wealthy Over the years ve thought a lot about what Rizzo said and can never forget it And the more think about It the more ashamed feel Have you ever felt anything like that Have you never felt that you were just a tool lust there to look after the Interests of whomever happens to be in power policeman whos also an anarchist You are a living contradiction Bonavia Havent you ever had any doubts about enforcing unjust laws Its not for us to judge the law but to To enforce it Yes knew you would say that But lets say tomorrow the law changed and stated that we had to use torture Dont be absurd Sure torture was abolished but that doesnt affect the fundamental question Would you use torture if the law would allow it But youre using an extreme example here Alright then whats your limit How much Injustice would you stand for in the name of the law If you go on ll arrest you was only referring to Rizzos ideas Let me talk to him Youre a few years too late Thats where they killed him Lomunno young shepherd heard the shot Lomunno used dynamite to seal Rizzos grave meters deep It took us two days and two nights to remove all the soil And then we found the body It wasnt the face of a dead man It was the face of a man who had never known justice and who never would And then on a Sunday afternoon arrested Lomunno had a witness And Did Lomunno know the boy had seen him suspected he did so asked to have the kid closely watched But someone obviously regarded me as a psychic word got out that d requested a guard and somebody got suspicious Nooo Anyway imagine that thats how it happened Naturally they said the kid slipped but there were scratches on his neck obviously made by fingernails And what did the autopsy show didnt have access to the report Thats absurd ll check the file You cant Why not It disappeared And three years later more bloodshed brought Lomunno into court in February of had the necessary proof It didnt hold up read the records Did it say by chance that the jury was threatened Thats Impossible There would have been a new trial know that they were threatened Prove it cant prove It Conclusion Lomunno is innocent Ah Bonavia fear that instead of sleeping at night you lie awake concocting elaborate fantasies You think that because youre convinced others are too But m not However lets get to the hard facts Rizzo that is You mention his name and you want instant justice criminal doesnt want justice to mete out justice You want the opposite and in that youre just as wrong You cant question the law Its not your job to question it It must remain unmolested As an officer of the law you must enforce and not criticise the law And that means Obey the law and confess Confess what If you have any respect for justice youll freely confess you had Puma released knowing hed kill Lomunno How do go about accusing myself Maybe you can advise me will tell you right now Firstly you recognised LiPumas body from the street He was disguised his head was covered in blood and he was hidden by the grass Noone could ever have recognised him like that and you were also some distance away You even said get photos of LiPuma Those were your exact words And secondly When we were at the mental Institute a man reproached you for not having listened to him the other day Why did you go there two days before LiPuma was released Thirdly Two days after your visit Li Puma was released And fourth After all you were behind the planned assassination attempt Only the motive remains to be determined Could be that youre a fanatic meting out his own kind of justice policeman who unleashes a killer because he has no faith in the courts But doubt It have always been wary of moralists You dont convince me Bonavia And so You could be an accomplice working for one of Lomunnos rivals Sold out to the underworld for money Were you daydreaming or nightdreaming when you came up with this fairy tale What did you say What did you say that could be a paid accomplice You say that have fantasies could never dream up that one Lets see now You say that Lomunnos rivals figured it out this way Lomunno has no respect for agreements Lets get rid of him How Simple Theres a police chief who can do the work for us He doesnt cost too much and he has the means to do it right Youre with me up to now But If there are people who paid me to have Lomunno killed there are also people who paid you to save Lomunno from that person namely me Listen to me or know or youll have me arrested But theres only one thing want to know Excellency Which side are you on And dont lie to me And you Whose side are you on m on my own side and can prove it to you You say they paid me to have Puma released alright arrest me Go ahead arrest me Thats what want And then well find out who warned Lomunno and why he did it That man will be my cellmate and that man will have a nice honest face like yours would like to see you trying to sleep amongst the bugs You wont get away with that Bonavia You fight me with your proof and ll fight you with slander The more unbelievable It ls the more credible it will sound Dont be ridiculous What will you accuse me of Ah dont confuse the Issues said slander not accusations What slander That which you hide from everyone that your mother is in a Swiss asylum Shes mad What My mothers worn out shes just resting know know but ll just say that youre lying thats all And by whom am been accused By a man who has an insane mother Possibly hereditary insanity Now we know a lot about that dont we Traini And then ll say that youre a fag Take It easy now dont lose your temper That you corrupt minors youve been seen in the company of a young boy Pietro Delia Right He ls an orphan a child that Oh know know that Hes the child of a deceased friend youre helping him through school Ah you really seem to be deaf said slander And am the first one to admit it Now need slander Do you know why Because when they Investigate me theyre also going to look into your past and find out that you dirtied your hands working for Lomunno Now what other vices do you have Gambling Drugs Thats enough Youll go to prison for life Just because have spoken about slander No no for the crime that you committed

Cammino claims he was working alone on behalf of unknown persons Let him speak for himself month ago two men offered me a lot of money If would unlawfully record Mr Trainis telephone conversations It seemed like like easy money so agreed Once a week left an envelope with the transcripts of the calls in the bar The next day an envelope with the money in it would be left for me Thats the way It was And we should believe that It ls the truth the pure truth Would you swear it on the Virgin Mary d swear to all of It Superintendent Take him away Captain forgive me if l have betrayed your confidence in me needed money you know Debts women a whole load of bad habits Out You had the temerity to have my phone tapped didnt you You dared to believe that a District Attorney could be derelict in his duties Do you deny having my phone lapped No If youll admit that you also had my phone tapped Where is Serena LiPuma You picked her up yesterday Mimi the fairy gave us that information could tell you that couldnt find her and maybe your Information was wrong couldnt Why are you being evasive It ls up to you to prove whether m telling the truth or not Thats what we agreed to right Youre no better than the criminals you say you hate so much That plot you worked out to klll Lomunno was worthy of a criminal mind Your friend Rlzzo certainly wouldnt have admired you for what you did Brigadier Schiro ask them to come in here These two men admitted youd found errors In the financial accounts of the institute and that you had threatened to report them Thats how you arranged to have LiPuma released We had not even the slightest Idea about what was behind it nor what his intentions were How can you believe what those two shits say They steal from their patients food allowances theyre crooks they admitted it But theyre not murderers They volunteered Information because they were afraid of being implicated They volunteered because they had no other choice after the attempt to kidnap the doctors son Didnt you know about that Bring me this mornings report You know our maid ls nervous she started screaming for help because someone invited my little boy to see the circus The poor man was so frightened he ran off Look how terrified he is Hes paralyzed thinking about what they might do to him Whatever he told you wont hold up in court Traini You can go m going to start proceedings

upside down Go on get lost Beat it but Bonavia Is a ranking police officer Cant we avoid his incrimination somehow dont think so Hes obstructed the Investigation by hiding Serena LiPuma the principal witness Hes a fanatic If there Is no alternative then go ahead But find It unforgivable for an officer of the law to do something like this for money Well m not surprised theyve also tried to bribe me How do you mean was offered a penthouse apartment and a large loan as a gift so to speak By whom dont know And why dont know If they were trying to thank me for taking action against Bonavia or if
