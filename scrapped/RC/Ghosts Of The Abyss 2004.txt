believe things can happen of such an intensity that they do resonate through time create like an echo The story of the Titanic is very personal to each person who hears it almost like a biblical story This giant ship all these people in the middle of the ocean this iceberg the warnings What would it have been like to be there on that fateful night knew Jim was going to go back to the Titanic He had talked about it He wanted to take another expedition since he had made the film He had invited me in passing But guess didnt really seriously consider would actually go Hello Hello You speak English Speaking Russian Great m looking for my room My cabin Speaking Russian Oh Oh thank you Thank you thank you thank you But then when he actually said No really want you to come along and experience it for yourself and just take it all in had to go Glen Phillips Departure plays Leave my past Leave my home ll find my way To the great unknown The Keldysh is the largest scientific research vessel in the world And all the activity onboard is focused on the Mirs and what they have to accomplish at the bottom of the ocean They take their work extremely seriously Everything is checked and rechecked just like a space mission But like the shore finds the ocean Like the night finds the day ll find an answer to these questions Far away Far away Oh My name is Lewis Abernathy m an underwater explorer got them all have been trying to thumb a ride down to Titanic for probably years now What do you got We got bots slimy bots and deck deck deck Huge rusticles like this big around My name is Lori Johnston My position was as a microbiologist looking at the rusticles The idea that she spiraled down spitting objects My name is Charles Pellegrino was one of the historians and biologists on the expedition We tend to think of it in stcentury eyes m Don Lynch and studied the Titanic based upon the testimony and accounts of passengers and crew The people who were there and witnessed it My name is Ken Marschall ve been studying the Titanic for over three decades now checked it out The Straus suite Through those years and study ve sort of become a visual historian about the ship and her structure and appearance It was an amazing expedition in terms of all of the stateoftheart technology and engineering we were using in terms of the camera system The were amazing On the cutting edge of technology Just try to keep the light in right where ve gone in m gonna explore these cabins There is no script We dont know what were gonna see We dont know what were gonna encounter The crucial thing about deepsea photography is lighting Just come up over and light all this business down here You see what mean Yeah So we had a sister ship on the expedition called the The had this giant lighting chandelier called Medusa The theory was to lower the chandelier down over the wreck and do this overlighting almost like moonlight There was no manual for any of this Nobody had ever combined this many elements into a singledive operation before at these depths We were pushing the limits of technology which was a little eerie given the fate of the ship we had come to explore This is where it all happened It could be any other part of the ocean but theres something special about knowing this is the spot and the wrecks down there Why this shipwreck Why not the Lusitania Why not the Moro Castle Why not the Atlantic Theyre all good Theyre all good but why is this one Look at the stuff that comes with this Youve got the biggest ship on its maiden voyage the president of the company onboard that owns it the builder onboard And it hits an iceberg and it sinks so slowly that youve got all these hours for drama to be acted out You dont get that with other shipwrecks Its really a Greek tragedy for real She was so cheated She was so beautiful So much energy went into building this creation You know the epitome of human engineering and architecture maritime architecture at that point And to have it taken away stolen just four days out of England And thats part guess of the odd attraction to it The fact that you could never have such a thing happen before or since The ship remains at the bottom of the sea as an eternal memorial And we can visit that memorial We can bear witness to the event And if were gonna do interior exploration we have to do it now because five years from now there might not be anything Five years ago the technology didnt exist We had to will it into existence Monday August Tomorrow morning we will descend miles into the cold dark netherworld and see Titanic for ourselves as she lies broken on the seafloor How do you prepare for such an experience Okay Dive one Its gonna be And Bill in Mir and me and Vince in Mir Pilots are gonna be Genya Chernaiev Mir Anatoly Sagalevitch Mir Okay Heres your checklist Have your last will and testament in order make sure your insurance is paid up write a final note to your family These are the kind of things you think about Next stop Titanic Happy hunting Lets rock and roll The moment of truth See you in the sunshine To get in a threeman submersible and descend feet down into the bottom of the North Atlantic it just was maybe a little more adventure than wanted Oxygen Yeah Thats good Yeah Be sure to turn that on Yeah can see how you get kind of queasy sitting up here Look at the colors change Speaking Russian Boy thats fast This tells you the oxygen up here right Yes So its at Thats good Now if that gets below then its Whats the number you watch for Its Its good also Its good Yes But if it gets below what Does the battery sound okay It sounds sluggish like that Thats normal Yes its normal Now if you have a real emergency and everything fails heard something about you can disengage drop the main battery Just Yes we have many possibilities hope we never drop battery because its very expensive How much Its think mean would you take a check Yes Thats pretty deep Rattling Something wrong Its okay Yes Thats handy And its fixed adjust for them for later Oh okay Okay Good Yeah Mir Mir this is Mir What is your depth Over Mir Mir this is Mir Depth is meters See you on the bottom Jim out see bottom Its bottom Oh yeah You see it Yeah Just barely Bottom of the ocean Look at that Look at that It looks like the dark side of the moon It wasnt just the idea of putting your faith in these little submarines and going to the bottom of the sea Theres thousands of tons of pressure against you But where we were going where we were going Well see more debris as we go Theres a piece right there Yeah look Theres some china See the china Yeah we got her You want to see Titanic on the sonar Youre gonna love this Its like there she is baby Oh man Okay Bill its the bow Oh look at that Oh God There it is What a sight What a sight So Medusa is lighting it up Look at that Oh man Oh now you get a sense of the size of this thing My God This was the Titanic This is the fabled liner that lies in its grave at the bottom of the North Atlantic You approach it with incredible reverence Bill it is bow anchor Oh God Its port side in good conditions That is incredible Look at that Look at that Its dug in all the way up to the anchor Oh its amazing just to be floating above it Gosh you could just reach out and touch it Were near the anchor crane Its right there See it Look Right here Okay Oh yes Okay Okay Youre clear knew we were gonna get close but not this close The experience of being in one of the submersibles is almost like an astral projection The way you float around it it really is an ethereal kind of ghostly experience Were here Its Hatch Number One Oh yeah Look You can see right down the cargo hatch Boy it just falls into just a black well Oh theres the crowsnest door right there They climbed up inside the mast to get out to the crows nest Thats where Fleet stood Right there when he saw the iceberg Bell dinging Iceberg right ahead You see the it looks like the port electric crane What is that Yeah its a gate Yes its gate Yes Closed gate Officers locked that to keep the steerage passengers down below decks Of course d have been just climbing over that thing Oh God So thats right where the bridge was And theres the telemotor The helm The helm of the ship Try to imagine what it must have been like to be on the bridge that night First Officer William Murdoch is on duty Quartermaster Hichens at the wheel That splitsecond decision Murdoch had to make Bell dinging Iceberg right ahead He can go left or he can go right Men shouting indistinctly Quickly Murdoch is suddenly staring an iceberg right down the barrel Murdoch knows how many passengers are onboard how few lifeboats there are what grave danger the ship is in Golly That is history right there We are touching the legend Lisa Torbans Darkness Darkness plays Darkness darkness Be my pillow Take my hand And let me sleep Wow Just like a cliff just falling in the abyss n the coolness Of your shadow n the silence Of your deep Mir Mir be advised that we are Were gonna be going up Did they start up Well lets clear Titanic before we turn the lights off Titanic was good to us today Speaking Russian Goodbye Titanic Indistinct voices on radio Oh Oh Groans Hello again Hello Sergei Whoo Welcome to Keldysh Quite a ride If the bow is so dug in you just dont get that depth And seeing that wall going all the way down and falling into nothing even just with the Mirs lights really was like Holy cow This thing is so big What exciting work We were exploring the Titanic with new technologies and these incredible new cameras Have you ever been in any sub Only at Disneyland This is different Speaking Russian Good luck See you later These dives every one is so precious want to make sure we pack as much information visually and historically as can possibly get into these eyeballs Ha Ha Ha You know you have historians scientists It was a great camaraderie screamed like a girl the whole time Crying like a kid Cried like a baby The were fascinating Initially they were called Bot and Bot But ultimately they were named Jake and Elwood My name is Mike Cameron m the Creator The vehicle is not unlike a little creature Its got a brain Its got a computer onboard Its got eyes in a couple cameras up front Give it a little forward You are in Daddy Youre in Its got this character about it thats alive The real revolutionary part is the fiberoptic spool Its like a spider spinning out its own silk Come in here explore these rooms come back out If these bots worked like we were hoping they would we could go through the entire ship The bots are finally going to Titanic Three years in the making Mir Jakes just coming out of his hooch Over Here he comes Hes out think we were so intent on watching the screens Very quickly forgot where was The Had just unconsciously become our eyes This is what its all about Cruising around at feet Jeff stand by Were about to launch Bot a Elwood Sight enabler Com link Camera power All right think were ready to fly Elwoods coming out Pretty cool Looking good Elwood Tell them well meet in the center of the grand staircase Were gonna meet in the center of the grand staircase Copy that The grand staircase on Titanic was in my opinion the most beautiful feature of the ship And the dome the wroughtiron dome overhead was just beautiful Its really a blessing that this staircase did break apart and float out because it allows easy access to the interior of the ship Whats Elwoods Right above you Getting ready to start our descent Over Okay We see him Thats them Okay We see you Okay Proceed slowly Proceeding slowly This is so much like flying a helicopter We knew the beauty of the grand staircase was gone But no one knew what wed find deep inside the ship Continue down one Youre crossing the floor of deck right now Youre looking into deck right now Do not go into deck Awaiting instructions deck deck Theres deck All right Hes in position to enter deck Stand by there Jeff Your first move would be to enter deck Roger that You getting ready to go down there Do want to be pointed aft or what Yeah Okay Okay Tell him to move ahead slow Move ahead slow Moving ahead slow Tell him to move real real real real easy Move real real real real easy Real easy Moving real easy Believe we are heading toward starboard Were looking at a light fixture Looks like it had four or five bulbs on it We should come to the right Come to the right Jeff And well head for the boiler uptake Copy that So far the vehicle is handling like a champ Its performing beautifully How much tether do we have out Just shy of feet out Okay Sagalevitch speaking Russian Move forward to that doorframe We are inside the Titanic Tell him to slow down still cant get over it Slow down Copy that still cant believe that were actually here keep waiting for somebody to yell Cut and m gonna go back to my trailer dont think can get out of this and get back to my trailer My trailer need to call my agent Its getting a little skinny right in here Looks like Carlsbad Caverns in there Is he pinned Is there no way forward from there Go left Go left Making the turn Thats too close to the bottom Tell them to come up Youre too close to the bottom Copy that Oh Boy this is nerveracking Theres something there See what that is Windows windows Diningroom windows Were going for the window Were going for the windows Look at that Unbelievable Thats amazing Take it real slow here Those are the leadglass windows Try to get your light up on those Amazing huh Yes Turn off his spotlight Turn off your spotlight Make a nice image of the windows Make a nice picture of the windows in front of you Look at that Look at that Oh boy Beautiful Still intact Very much intact Looks like the glass all the leaded glass its all there Its not broken The firstclass dining room was beautiful Among the passengers who ate here were John Jacob Astor and his wife Madeline who were on their honeymoon She would be widowed before the end of the voyage We are not in Kansas anymore think you got a friend Oh Theres Sam Sam stopped by to say hello Hes giving us the tour Follow me he says Its like a fantasy in here isnt it The craftsmanship The delicate beauty That human hands created these windows that human eyes looked at these windows And then you realize that youre feet beneath the sea Oh look at that woodwork Thats all wood Genya Thats all carved wood But these things created by man in this dark abyss where they just shouldnt be Theyre not supposed to be here Unbelievable Who wouldve thought that would still be there Its the dream come true for me Whats significant about the reception room is that this is where Elizabeth Lines overheard a conversation between Captain Smith and Bruce Ismay the owner of the Titanic And she heard Ismay telling Smith to have the Titanic arrive in New York a day early think were going to beat Olympics time and arrive in New York Tuesday night Were holding at the firstclass entrance starboard side Isnt that beautiful Gosh It looks like its just been made more beautiful by time Titanics main firstclass entrance was on deck And she had two large gangway doors on both the port and the starboard side Through the eyes of the we could see the wroughtiron gates just inside the doors which were unknown to historians until this expedition We had no idea what was inside and now we know This is the way they boarded the ship They came in through that door and then this inner door And in this entrance vestibule there was a large sideboard against the aft wall where lots of firstclass china was stored The dish cabinet had more or less rotted away But you could see the teacups and the little dishes stacked perfectly there wish had those dishes you know Give it up on eBay Theres the elevators Theres Theres the shaft Look at that thought they called them lifts but you know what The ship was owned by an American company Hmm Like you could just call them now Whenever youre looking at the elevator grilles try to remember to turn and look forward and see There may still be paneling right amidships and there will be brass letters that say deck deck deck or deck When you come out of the elevators Most likely that paneling is down But you never know That would be a classic shot to have that lettering still clinging Ken loves this stuff feel like m making a film for one person Ken Marschall And there it is Bingo baby Tell him bingo Bingo The had recently fallen from its own weight That brass letter was heavier than the Okay see where we are We just peeked into We were methodical exploring the interior We had to be because the wreck can be very disorienting It was spooky was the cabin of Henry Sleeper Harper and his wife Sitting on the remains of the wardrobe cabinet is Henry Harpers bowler hat Just the idea that we know whose it was Hey look Theres some kind of glass Maybe a mirror Lets see if thats a mirror It is Were gonna go see ourselves was occupied by Edith Russell Before getting into a lifeboat she went back to her cabin to lock her trunks because she didnt trust the stewards onboard Jim was looking for Molly Browns stateroom We had a good idea where that stateroom would be And he was searching for a forwardfacing window The Is narrow enough to scoot through that And saw there was jagged glass at the bottom of the windowsill That could sever the tether commit suicide Ken says we can do this Its a gamble Dont do it Dont do it Youre gonna be laying your tether right across the glass There he goes Hes in there Thats what m talking about Okay now that youre in its not that bad of an idea Thats not a brass bed Thats a wooden bed Its kind of creepy dont know Molly Brown said she was in a brass bed dont see a brass bed Molly Brown was a character She and her husband had made their fortune mining out west And she was desperate to be accepted by high society The Titanic tragedy made her a legend Uh Genya Yes Um need to pee dont think can hold it much longer No problem Okay For me personally ve always been kind of a nervous you know pisser Laughing need a little privacy But when you got to go and youre miles down you got to go Its okay Um ll turn around Can you turn around Okay Thank you Thank you Lets see here Point your lights straight into deck My God Look at that Look at that Tolya brass bed sitting right in there Maybe Molly Brown did stay in a brass bed But which one Theyve built bigger ships since Titanic but dont know that theyll ever build one as luxurious And even now after years of laying on the bottom of the ocean its beauty came to light Okay Were in Okay Tell them were in the promenade Jakes in the promenade We did get into one of the millionaire suites on deck Private promenade They call them private promenade These were the fanciest most expensive lodgings on the ship And in April you would have paid over to book your passage This must be some of the facing Yeah its some of the Tudor facing We are in the room Jakes in the room This is Bruce Ismays suite This is the guy that left the ship with people still onboard Ooh thats a beauty We are in the sitting room looking at the fireplace Isnt that amazing That ribbon design is still there These little touches of elegance You can almost feel the hands of the guy that made that Bruce Ismay was managing director of the White Star Line and he vetoed the idea of having lifeboats He felt fewer would be fine that as long as they met the law they were okay It is Smiths bathtub Oh Captain Smith Wow The captain of the Titanic used to take his baths right there His little pink butt sitting right there in the tub Captain Smith was called the millionaires captain because he was so popular with the firstclass passengers Perfect record This voyage was to be his crowning achievement He was going to take the biggest most beautiful ship across the ocean on her maiden voyage and then retire n archeology we carry these ghosts of the imagination with us And was kind of imagining Thomas Andrews out there on the deck Thomas Andrews was managing director and president of Harland and Wolff Shipbuilders He designed and built the Titanic from the ground up He knew the ship better than anyone He put davits on the ship that were designed to take a lifeboat from here and lift it outward and then go inward and pick up a second lifeboat in a second position and go out n his own hand in his notebook he has the number of lifeboats that are supposed to go on the ship that he designed it for He was overruled and forced to comply only to the minimum of the Board of Trade requirement Andrews cared about the ship and crew and was onboard to make lastminute improvements and make sure everything ran smoothly If only there were a way to let him see these submersibles sending these incredible robots into his creation Move a little right to avoid the arm There you go Okay Were good Were coming out Its coming out folks Okay Ease it forward Okay We explored all three forward cargo hatches and made it into several crew and thirdclass spaces that had never even been photographed before Is that the deck think so Yeah think youre right All right Thats it Theres the other hatch So just ease on in there Ease it on in there Okay Heres our stairwell It should go right up to it So we got into third class We were in the general room in the bow under the well deck There wasnt a lot of detail in this room because it was never a welldecorated room The bar at one end that still had the little tap there There were table bases still there in place The tables and bench bases rising up from the floor It was neat to see those Thats a very big table The place where they all ate They wouldve sat here and played cards This was where there was a party held by many of the thirdclass passengers on Sunday night And it really was moving to be able see this room where so many of them spent their last few happy hours There was a brandnew Renault beautiful car that was strapped down in the cargo hold And we have some fairly good historical projections of what it would look like now Going from deck to deck solid hatch cover as advertised But its open And it would be barely recognizable as a car Only a few items would show up recognizable as a vehicle We were on deck We went through the hatch cover We are now on the orlop deck Correct You are Tilt up and youll see the car Snorts Tilt up and we see some gak see some light back there Yeah Maybe that is the car It is think thats the car It is Its the car No No It cant be that easy It is Chuckles dont think thats the car think were seeing cars Shiny piece of Oh my God m thinking That looks like wheel Jim thats a fender dont care what planet youre on thats a tire and fender This is headlight Were seeing cars boy Laughs All right the best thing to do now that were here is to just look everywhere Theres a car Thats a car No those are Thats a trunk right there Wicker trunk Thats a tire There were some pretty interestinglooking structures obviously manmade stuff but nothing clearly identifiable as a car Yeah we should be able to get all the way forward Are you in Yes Oh baby Thats awesome Oh dude this is so cool Count doors on the right Thats how well orient ourselves There should be two doors side by side The first door should take you into the firemens mess You want to go in there Yeah Thats definitely the firemens mess Oh look at that Table after table You can see the bow tapering in Exactly Shape of the ship You can imagine exactly what this place looked like The firemen were segregated from the rest of the crew probably because they had the dirtiest job So their quarters are in the tip of the bow They had two staircases which took them to the very bottom of the ship and to the boiler rooms Imagine spiraling your way down to the furnaces of this hungry leviathan to join hundreds of men shoveling coal into the gaping maws of the boilers Thats kind of spooky And when you finish your shift hours later you climb back up into your little world below decks at the very bow of the ship where you eat you sleep then you do it all over again Even here we could feel the hand of Thomas Andrews At the top of one of the spiral staircases we found a drinking fountain m sure that even this small kindness must have been greatly appreciated Here weve got a plan that illustrates pretty well what happened that night The Titanic was divided into separated by Thats these white lines here And the ship was designed to be as unsinkable as they could The worst they could imagine is a collision at the juncture of two compartments which would flood two adjacent compartments The ship would only sink so far and still be safe She was also designed to float with any three of the first five compartments flooded Or the first four in a row could still flood if they were in some traumatic That was the worstcase scenario Run into a rock or something like that just fullon Shed buckle back and the ship could still float With all of this combination of safety factors she was considered virtually unsinkable What they didnt envision is what happened that night Titanic struck the iceberg a glancing blow along the starboard side scraped along and ruptured plates or split the seams moving along into this cargo compartment into this cargo compartment and this baggage and cargo into Boiler Room Number and two feet into the coal bunker of Boiler Room Number And as the ship sank just at the point where it was about ready to stabilize it reached the top of this watertight subdivision and started flowing up the stairways across the deck and down into the next compartment It was just a mathematical certainty There was no way no matter how you slice it that the ship is going to make it So where exactly did it split Well it broke in two right back here Just right about at the third funnel and after that Theres a natural weak spot here in the hull right above the reciprocating engine room There is a large air shaft here for light and air to ventilate the reciprocating engine room My God What that must have sounded like looked like What that must have been like What a deathblow to this great ship Imagine the vortex to create that kind of twisting Thats what gets me Seeing the end of the stern piece and seeing how Cant you just see one of those fish swimming along And then Imitates crashing And you know what the fish wouldve done Whoa you know Exactly Our best shot is probably of the reciprocating engines on the starboard side right Thats the guts of it Starboard side Sometimes see him come here and come up Yes Thats good Good Like that And lose sometimes good shots when Victor stays here Right But the thing is that Victor cant face us He cant otherwise his lights will hit the camera He has to be above with the lights down or like this Yes Maybe here So sort of this This sort of thing See if the water is clear thatll make a good shot The engine room where those guys were fighting to keep that thing alive They were Titanic They knew it was dying They didnt die with a brandy glass in hand They died with a monkey wrench trying to stop the bleeding That is the starboard engine Look at that Oh man Look at the size of that thing Okay keep panning because m gonna be coming around this way Oh man It does give you the scale seeing that little bot next to that giant sphinx of an engine When you see the stern section where it tore in half and there are the two reciprocating engines standing four stories high they really do look like these twin sphinxes that are guarding the forbidden tomb When the historians look at Titanic they think of the lives that were lost When look at the ship as a scientist look at the life that still is on Titanic Titanic is very much alive Rusticles are bacteria microscopic organisms bugs that are actually eating the steel and the insides of the ship look at a rail and think Oh look at the bacteria Theyre breaking Titanic down and taking her back to nature But then you immediately go back and think Who touched this railing last Helen Candee is one of my favorite passengers She had written one of the centurys first best sellers Basically the theme being how a woman can get along in life successfully without a man And thats how she was traveling firstclass on the Titanic And on the very last sunrise that the Titanic would ever see she snuck out to the very point of the bow just to greet the sunrise alone And she wrote about it and how she felt the power and the beauty of this ship and that it was stronger than nature itself maybe even stronger than God itself And then suddenly she felt very darkened as if she had thought something sacrilegious Mmm Its good Whats in borscht Thats good borscht Borscht in Russian What is in borscht Borscht Speaking Russian Cabbage potatoes bouillon Everybody eat borscht Singing in Russian Anatoly has a song that he wrote about the blue sky that you see when you return to the surface and the hatch opens And think thats very apropos because its something that you didnt think you would miss but you do Its very difficult to wander through the Keldysh and not think of the Titanic and draw some parallel You know what wouldve happened if the engineers hadnt stayed at their station when the Titanic had gone dark say an hour earlier It would have been absolute pandemonium became very close with the men in the engineering section Its quieter in here Hello my friends There wasnt a lot said But there was still very much a bonding that went on Tell me If we were going full speed okay and all of a sudden the bridge said Iceberg Or Drunken fishingboat captain in our way And they ring alarm what do you do Speaking Russian Alarm rings Ah Full speed Speaking Russian The engines all stop Singing in Russian Whoo Yay Song ends Ah Anatoly Dal Dal On our last dive to Titanic we found some interesting organisms Inside yeah Yes inside the ship It almost has wings See the wings that are flying The oddest creature that was seen down there was something we call the batwing And to my knowledge nobody has identified it yet Several creatures down there that dont think are known to science Titanic because there is so much interest in it has really allowed us to do a great deal of research You could actually see gelatinoustype clouds of bacteria as they floated by and fingerlike structures that were hanging from the ceilings Intertwined with this woodwork well see these lavender worms Shimmery strange things almost transparent sometimes And they particularly like the mahogany paneling Lets go up to him Even the fish dont look like the same rattails that are found outside To me they appear to live exclusively inside the ship Hes heading for the elevator shaft Hey he knows where hes going Wow cant believe it didnt think d see the boilers on this dive had no idea we were approaching the bow from this angle Were awful close to this stuff Mir you got a steam pipe above you Be careful Its safe to be this close What are you worried about If something happens to us your artwork will be worth millions Oh great Thatll do me a lot of good see a real shiny thing straight ahead Oh these are whistles Genya Whistles from the funnel Oh my goodness Right under me Ooh look at this What is that Genya Yes Like a hatch cover Its a hatch cover think Yes dont think weve ever seen a hatch cover saw it earlier Yeah So thats Hatch One It got blown off when the ship hit the bottom Its just blown right out here in front of the ship Oh my God What What Heres a glass carafe Oh look at that Unbelievable Can you believe it survived Thats a firstclass stateroom Water decanter Yeah was pretty calm going down As a matter of fact we saw in my porthole there was this womans shoe It was perfectly preserved And it was laced up You know was just like Oh my God Thats somebodys grave marker Thats the only grave marker they have You see now that we are coming to the davit Yeah Davit Number One This was Lifeboat One where Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff Gordon had escaped with only other people in a lifeboat that could have held two dozen more The law of the sea is women and children first when you go to evacuate a ship For the time being shall require only women and children On the port side of the ship Second Officer Lightoller took it to mean women and children only and he only let women and children into the boats and then as few crewmen as possible to navigate it Please Daddy Dont you worry Working on the other side heres Murdoch getting the boats in the water as quick as he can shoving men women children firstclass thirdclass He didnt care May get in the boat wish you would Yes maam n you go Lower away Almost of everyone who survived have Murdoch to thank for it Moving into the deck promenade with the it really looked familiar long sweeping open deck Half of it was open The forward end was enclosed by large glass windows This is right where they walked you know John Jacob Astor put Madeline Astor into the lifeboat right through one of those windows right there Because she was pregnant he asked Second Officer Lightoller May accompany my wife No sir Women and children only Come on Here darling Take these And so he told her hed be seeing her in New York No sir Step aside ve been thinking about my family a lot being out here and were going on these dives Theres an element of risk involved Its a calculated risk But think the idea of suddenly being on the deck and saying love you you know and trying to bear up Now just go in the lifeboats Daddy will be along in a little while Thats just torturous Trying to make your family think that its okay Youre just keeping up a brave face Exactly Also its the question of personal character that you keep going back to For me ever since was a teenager the whole idea is the question of how would have beared up Would have had the character to stand back and shown that kind of nobility shown that kind of courage And as we romanticize the image of Titanic and its such a romantic time and everything you want to put yourself with the men standing there with dignity But you really cant assume what your character would be in that moment unless youve been through that kind of thing Absolutely You see the doors the entrance to first class Yeah Thats the entrance This is where the band played This open area right here The orchestra would have gathered and they started playing ragtime Alexanders Ragtime Band playing You think of the band in terms of how heroic they were They played knowing that everyone else was getting into a lifeboat except them But how calming that band music was to the people who were onboard Okay This right over here should be the Marconi Room Everyone knows the important role that the Marconi Wireless played that night Senior Marconi Wireless Operator Jack Phillips and Junior Operator Harold Bride worked in tandem until the very end You should try Its the new signal Yes it might be our last chance to use it During the final moments of the sinking the ships power was becoming unstable Harold Bride was in the Silent Room trying to compensate for this loss of power To our great astonishment are the handles the settings still visible on these two field regulators They are in the final settings that this man manipulated Hey thats better They have the human touch to them Pull Pull together Many of the boats had been launched halffull Return to the ship Boat Return We need to go back No Its our lives now Now row The suction will pull us down if we dont keep going Titanic was a stage where God says You have hours to act out the rest of your life What are you gonna be Will you be a hero Will you be a coward Time for one more hand Poker Five card draw Glass breaking Creaking Would you fight to survive Would you take your place meekly with the people that were relegated to the thirdclass spaces and wait patiently until someone unlocks a gate and lets you free Help us What would you do Please How would you act think its fortunate that most of us will never be put to that test Any more women or children Anyone else men Anyone else Quickly Quickly men quickly Prepare to lower Ready on the left Bruce Ismay Hes the guy who was responsible And yet he did survive when others died Right and left together dont know which man wouldve felt worse that night Bruce Ismay for vetoing more lifeboats or Thomas Andrews for not having fought that decision harder There was absolute pandemonium just chaos as those last boats went down Get back say Gunshots screaming Get back Link arms Form a chain Women and children only please It was precarious There was one lifeboat where they werent letting adults in This forced women to decide whether they were gonna be separated from their children They were trying to take children only There were so many people and a few lifeboats Several women said am not going without my children Theyre not leaving without me They overcrowded that lifeboat but the water was so calm it made it It had over people but the water was calm enough It must have been up to the gunwales It was that far above the water You couldve put your hand over and trailed it in the water At the very end Murdoch was trying to get collapsible off the roof while the ship was sinking out from under it Get back Get back Step away Get back Crank this down there men They cranked the davits in to drag the collapsible over the side But by then it was too late Water rushing The numberone davit remains in that crankedin position an unspoken monument to Murdochs dedication and heroism After the lifeboats had gone we have evidence of some thirdclass passengers just going back to their cabins They had no hope of surviving and they took it gracefully Creaking rattling Screaming in distance To me it must have been tough for the people who survived knowing they could have possibly gone back and rescued some of the people in the water once the ship had gone under To go in there would have been suicide and nothing less Weve got people in the water all screaming for help fighting for their lives You could easily have trying to climb onboard at once Theyre sitting in a lifeboat safe To not row back or to have that not in your mind cant believe that of somebody How safe are you in a lifeboat in the middle of the North Atlantic Titanic is that thing you always try to measure yourself against What would have done if would have been on the deck Heroism and character will always be the domain of the individual not the group Thats what will never change On one of the later dives Jim decided to go back into the firstclass spaces on deck and have Mir shine lights through those leadedglass windows from the outside Getting ready Yes Here comes the light Nice Perfect Not since April had human eyes seen light pouring through these beautiful windows lot of the washstands have fallen over yet here was one that was still upright And so someone took a drink of water set that glass down and walked out of that room and years later that glass and that carafe are still there n the middle of this you see this perfect object It really ties you to the people It does You still see things where people had last left them Lamps still plugged in The medicine bottles still in place Its the things people touched that bring the pictures alive in your mind So were looking at it right here like this need more power Come on baby React react react We have a problem What We got a lowbattery warning here Whoa theres something really terribly wrong here Uhoh Are we gonna lose this thing Oh Jesus Did we crash Were dead Were dead Were dead and buoyant Drop it Drop it Buoyancy right now Easy easy easy Battery is starting to die Oh were not gonna live Guys get a visual on us because we just lost power Youre headed for the ceiling Youre sitting on the ceiling Jim Were dead in the water We have a dead battery Were watching you Were gonna sit and watch you The whole thing was melting down The batteries they were melting down and venting It was very bizarre It was like Houston we have a problem They flew beautifully right up until the point that we had an absolute total majormalfunction system crash ve had a debate with myself as to whether would even ever try a rescue because better to lose one than two Its almost a straight shot except theres a couple of columns in the way think theres a way to bring it back Yeah its not too far from the stairwell No But the first thing we got to do is get some weight on it The weight with a piece of Velcro on top want to fly up underneath it and stick the weight to the bottom sink it to the floor then come up dock with it and carry it out Thats the only way to do it Let me know if m going too fast We had to rescue Elwood not just because these bots are expensive but because in some strange way hed become part of the crew Oh where oh where is my little bot now Look up Look up Hello Elwood We tried to attach weights to the To make it come down off the ceiling If can just go forward What the hell was that Something fell dont know See were thrusting up against it so it may not come down right away All right so let me get set for the separation maneuver Its on there Its on there We have it m gonna have to get out of this no matter what Otherwise were not coming home m going out Oh Link error We lost Its gonna come past us in a second We might as well get it on tape Here she comes Say goodbye Probably two hours without radio contact from Jim All we hear over the radio is Say goodbye to Jake Say goodbye to Jake Whats happened Hit our own tether Cable broke cant imagine what it was like in Jims sub He goes through a range of emotions He loses one robot Then he loses a second robot Well we got our ceiling scenario and we got our kite scenario The two ways we thought we could actually lose these things And after a quick exchange we noticed the tether coming up past our sub Genya grabs the joysticks that control the sub manipulators And he grabs the tether and starts winding the tether up around the arms of the manipulators This is scary See what hes doing If he breaks it before he gets a wrap on it Oh my God cant watch this Youre scaring me now Genya To wind up this tether it took minutes of the same motion over and over and over winding this up that weve been at this Hey Lets see it thought it was on the ground You got him All stop All stop Our next task is to take a Velcro patch and slap it on top of the robot with the manipulator arms and pull the robot in that way You got him Still got it As Genya is pulling up on it the Velcro rips off the robot and for this brief second the entire robot was free and starts floating back up Theres no tether holding it Its free Grab it Grab it any way you can Genya the most amazing operator of any machinery ve ever seen in my life grabbed these manipulators He pulls it back in and hugs it tight to the Mir m going gray over here think hes got it in that garage Hes got the tool out saw the tool Yes Whoo Garage closed Laughs He lives another day Oh my God do believe Genya deserves a raise do believe you owe everybody here a beer Dude ll buy you a brewery That was incredible That was absolutely incredible The Department was almost out of a job Was that amazing That was the most amazing thing ve ever seen think aged a year And we sat there and we just watched him just fly up out of the grand staircase and keep on going Genya wound it all in like a kid winding up a kite string Great job man Good job So we got the rescue half done We installed the weight and then we had a problem We saw it with the weight hanging on it dont know if it came down or not think metal hooks would work if you get a fishing lure that you can stab into the screen and pull it out by the screen told you wed nab him Just remember when you hook up peel away to your right Come on baby Were in Were in n Were in Now m gonna sit for a minute Take a little break Very good Excellent Excellent Were halfway Theres nothing in front of him Push him a little bit and think we busted loose Hooks pulled out Put him in the cage Hooks pulled out And think we knocked him off his weight Yeah the weight wouldve come off anyway though All right The question is do we have another try Somethings right over me Oh there we go Got rid of that Now were rising All right Time to go for the kill Okay Not the center We could bend our hooks on the Oh that looked good Push him a little bit then all back full yaw right The hooks still there Negative It looks good Lets go for a drive and see if he comes with us Oh m yawing in a weird way so that must mean have him so m just gonna keep playing him m gonna play the hand think the door is down there Tell him were here Mir we see the door Were on station Theres the light Tell them we see them Mir Mir we see your lights Maintain position All right Theres the way out Hanging up m hung up Were stopped And were stuck See it Its like hitting a wall We are hung up solid Absolutely solid Nothing think we lost it dont know what to do m sure nothings changed but well try it again Okay m gonna back up take a little leash And then charge it Now we get to the same spot and Hey Were going Youre going Go toward the light Jake Go toward the light Oh come on baby Come on Mir Mir tilt your light down Tilt your light down Copy that Tilting it down keep feeling shocks think still have him Oh thats why Theyre coming this way Tell them to take a visual on us and see if we

the two of us Just the two of us Just the two of us We pulled it off Daddy Yeah Whoo Great job Everybody did a great job Elwood is safe and sound And the time is September See you later Whats this thing thats going on The worst terrorist attack in history Jim We all were wrapped up in what we were doing and thought it was important Hit by two separate hijacked commercial jets And then this horrible event happened and slammed us into this perspective God The morning after the attack on September th kept thinking how trivial this expedition suddenly became It just wasnt a big deal anymore The emotional parallels came first We now understood what it felt like to be a witness to tragedy The sense of shock and numbness and the disbelief that the unthinkable has happened It does happen Occasionally life sits on your head But hey ve been knocked down before We all have We get up We go on think thats what makes us great Everyone decided to continue the expedition think that after wed gotten over the initial shock Titanic did seem to become important again Not so much for itself but as a symbol of what can happen when warnings go unheeded and how think we all hope to face death when it comes Archie Frost was in the engine room that night Just barely into his twenties and had worked with Thomas Andrews when the ship was being built After a certain point Andrews had come down and told them The ship does not have much time to live and if you stay here you will die Archie Frost said Well stay here as long as we need to be here Those are the everyday heroes The people who ran those machines kept the generators running and kept power for the telegraph going who kept the crowds calm You find the ordinary hero that was standing next to you When you see the stern where people had died dont really know how to describe it You cant help but be emotional Theres no doubt people were taken to the bottom in the stern But theyre no longer there Every trace of their human existence has been dissolved into the ocean Okay Mir Get in position to lay the plaque Jim getting into position to lay plaque The souls lost here still speak reminding us always that the unthinkable can happen but for our vigilance humility and compassion Goodbye We had been at sea a long time was thinking about being home again On the final day as we left at the stern of the ship was a white rainbow It was almost like a halo effect over the wreck of the Titanic And it had an ethereal feel to it think you leave Titanic but it never leaves you Its always there And many times when close my eyes m suddenly back there floating over the wreck and feel like am a ghost of the abyss SkyFury
