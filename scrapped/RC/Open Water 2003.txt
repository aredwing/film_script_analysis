threepronged like forked thing right below us Youre unbelievable You can find some obscure little coral formation in the middle of the ocean but you get lost going to my mothers l need an incentive You love my mother They obviously cannot see us Think its time to swim Swim where l dont know l think that ones the closest Honey its a bad idea Why Because we are not sure if thats our boat And if its not our boat then that means we could be swimming farther from our boat Besides you know how far away that is lts really far lts further than that And if its not our boat they could pull away at any time And then our fucking boat wherever the hell it is will have a hell of time trying to find us You going somewhere Just my face l hate to tell you this but l didnt see anything that looked like any kind of coral formation Could you just show me ld just feel better Sure You see l didnt see anything Shit What You dont see it because its not there So does that mean Just since weve surfaced were

look Look around us We are stuck in the middle of the ocean with nobody Even if we had been swimming for the last five hours we would not be any closer to a boat than we are now The only reason we are even out here in the first place is because of your fucking job What lf it were not for your job we would not have thrown our plans out of the window rushed around at the last minute and settled on this fucking trip We would be at home in the middle of our hectic lives which right now sounds like heaven to me And in a months time as we planned seven months ago we would be where we were supposed
