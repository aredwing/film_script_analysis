question for you Yes How did yall meet you and Naomi Well was taking my dog Molly for a walk in Hyde Park one morning a border terrier a wonderful dog And my wife had died a year previously Molly had become my constant companion always trying to lift my spirits noticed a very attractive woman standing by the bronze statue of St George slaying the dragon And she had a camera obviously a tourist And she spotted me and she asked me in a very attractive Southern American accent if d care to take her picture Of course said d be delighted So she gave me the camera And was expecting her to stand in front of the statue and smile d take a snapshot of her d give her the camera back and wed go our separate ways but not a bit of it Not a bit of it No instead she absolutely astonished me by climbing on the back of the horse sitting astride it behind St George as quickly and as nimbly as a monkey Sounds like her yeah was laughing so much had difficulty in taking the picture properly Anyway thats how met Naomi just always wondered about it Always wondered Yeah Hey kid Whats up Just going outside for a smoke You Just having my cereal Youre up early Not really aint been to bed yet How come Connell and me were up all night talking Connell got drafted Shit Does Dorothy know yet No he aint told her yet Man Poor thing She loves that kid to death Its weird Daddy How can government just come and tell you what to do like that He was gonna go to California get in the music scene Its fucked up know it aint right mean thats why m telling you you gotta get in college Thats why m against it you know So a kid like Connell that has a dream gets a chance to live it But you know there is something cool about it though Connell being a soldier No son Theres nothing cool about it Well looky there Here we go Nobody else is going to church Why do we have to Cause we always go to church Because we love the Lord Well we went to church yesterday No we didnt God damn it We went to a funeral Its different Hello Hello Good morning And then the hydrogen atom and good things are gone Hi What are you doing Getting the car on m just fiddling around in here What are you doing Oh Its hot Yeah Very hot So when are you gonna get naked and recite something to me in your accent hmm Come on tit for tat No is not an acceptable response Listen uh Hmm Yes Hop in Okay Yeah Kingsley you heard of Jayne Mansfield Jayne Mansfield Yeah Yeah the film star blonde with those Titties Thats right Thats right Well she was killed a couple of years back in a car wreck in Louisiana And a friend of mine just called from town They have the very car she was killed in out at the discount store And theyre selling tickets And its a big deal And darn near forgot it was today Would you like to come with me Come on All right Oh Lets go All right How grotesque Its a good spot come out here to do my thinking used to bring Patty Overton out here and just wear her ass out That was before the war She married a Primitive Baptist preacher She was harelipped and you needed Grandpas bifocals to see her titties but you know she had a ass and God damn she could take it right up to the gills without so much as a hiccup Oh think she sounds like a lovely girl Yeah Right enough beating about the bush Lets get on with it fly boy think a little Tennessee Williams would be appropriate Do you know Streetcar Named Desire You hear that No dont Birds Silence Thats what was hard to get used to It still is sometimes Its kind of like floating on a peaceful lake with a tornado in your head or something never did want to see wrecks didnt want to know what somebodys last thought was before they died never wanted to see dead faces looking at nothing just wanted to fly When was a kid read books on it Once in a blue moon one would fly over and d watch it till it disappeared So thats how come joined in We werent even in the war at that point just wanted to fly up there in the quiet and the still was a navy pilot How about that It wasnt quiet and still though It was loud and crazy and scary But you went up every time you were supposed to did what you were supposed to do And went up with three minds One mind was always thinking One way or the other m gonna get back m gonna make it back And then another mind was always thinking This is probably gonna be the last day of my life And then your third mind was right down the middle and didnt think about anything It wouldnt let the other two in You know people say they dont like to talk about war because it brings up the bad memories and the nightmares and everything dont believe that believe they dont talk about it because nobody wants to hear it See in the early part of the war the Japanese were good pilots better than we were really Later on we got better but made a mistake that day It was a clear blue day and he got in behind me and got hit right here and back up there in the back And couldnt believe d been shot And at the same time d been expecting it all the time you know one way or another bailed out didnt want to was scared to But didnt want to burn to death Thats what we were mostly worried about up there Yeah You know how lucky am No landed right in the middle of the goddamn marines It knocked me out broke my right leg collarbone a few ribs pelvis both hands dont remember a lot about it to tell you the truth November the th Guadalcanal woke up in a hospital had both my hands in casts and my right leg just tore to pieces And the hospital got hit And nearly burned to death saw a guy coming at me with a big ol wet blanket or something and he threw it over my head thought he was trying to kill me But he saved my face as Jimbo says for what thats worth and got me out of there Carroll got to come visit me a couple of times Thats real special And that was the end of the war for me mean God damn honey you cant get out of your own skin no matter what it is Anyhow it takes five kills to become an ace And got six m an ace Skip Uh didnt beat off Come on know a place Her and her boyfriend and her chauffeur they all got killed in Louisiana in the middle of the night The kids was in the back seat didnt hardly even get hurt little ol dog of hers deader than Rin Tin Tin Yes can remember when it happened Its always shocking when the rich and famous die Theres no reason for us to believe that they should have immunity but we seem to Yeah Yeah You reckon how many people would live to ripe old age if we didnt go anywhere cause transportation kills a lot of people Yeah What if the last thought in the world was God damn it here comes a car across the center line about to kill me cause had to get out at at night for a roll of toilet paper Well wish would have just wiped my ass with a sweetgum leaf Yes ve been thinking a lot about last thoughts recently hope dont have one Yeah d rather go in my sleep so there wouldnt be any conscious thoughts Oh thats good just a dream instead Yeah hopefully a good one Yeah Yeah Three please Whew Yeah Yeah Yeah Move over son so we get a better look Yeah Mm There it is Whew Mm Yeah What they said was there was the car was headed through a road in the swamps And there was a mosquito truck on the road spraying pesticide And it comes drifting across the road like a cloud just this fog of poison And this tractor trailer rig slowed down when it hit the fog And Jayne Mansfields car slid right under it That was it That was all she wrote Yeah Mm She was decapitated wasnt she lot of people think that but it wasnt the whole head No it was just the top of it Yeah Mm Kingsley you spend a lot of your time figuring things out You know Jim these days think spend more time accepting things Not me spend all of my time figuring things out Yeah That aint her real head Shit dont you think know that My daddy says its probably not even really her car Aint you got anything better to do than to pester me Huh Huh Thats right Yeah ll be in the truck Yeah Well mm seen enough Just about Just about Whew Mm Mm Yeah dead mans stare aint any different than that plastic heads stare Aint nothing in either one of them saw it on the battlefield many times m sure you did too Yes m afraid did The fact is we all have a crash of some sort awaiting us Yeah Hey you hear that Yeah Yeah put pieces together all the time and they all fall apart Before can ever get it all put together they all fall apart Thats it exactly Everythings been turned upside down Yeah Listen love my boys but for the life of me cant figure them out Jimbo is a good hand around here turned out normal didnt even see combat The other two was outandout heroes turned out to be hardly naught but hobos You think itd be the other way around Yeah Yes well have to say that Phillip has been a bit of a disappointment to me too Yeah well times are changing Good lifes disappearing Sometimes pray m not here to see it go Oh my God do you believe them Theyre acting like longlost buddies know m amazed Lets go sit down a bit all right Its really quite a storm Rest your bones Look at them No telling what they was up to while we was at church Yeah m gonna go freshen up Well hey sister Vicky Lets take a walk We had fun riding Its about my sister You what We had fun riding You need to leave her the fuck alone Well now see here dont know what youre getting at No no no no m m not pissed off at you dont even like you only get pissed off at people like Theres nothing in this for me This is for your own damn good Dont get mixed up with her The powers out See what got to put up with Like was fixing to tell you she aint a bad gal sometimes But she can suck you down in the hole youll never be able to crawl out of Neal used to be a slim muscular goodlooking humble guy Now he runs his mouth off like a threshing machine just so he doesnt have to hear himself think And if you look at him he cant even hardly squeeze into a damn leisure suit eats whatever you put in front of him drinks two cases of beer a day Like all the shit you done You want to have some spending money in your pocket Careful careful and not to have to work like a slave keep your sanity let her be Shes tricky Shes as whiny as a twoweekold cat aint even sure thems his daughters stop and see whats going on now Get me Hippies dope laziness They call it free love Its a free ride is what it is What astounds me is the lack of respect You know the people that we fought and that died next to us if they were to see what was going on today they would literally spin in their graves Its just a crying shame While our boys are fighting in the jungle the hippies are theyre singing songs and pissing on our flag Well dont they realize that there is a rising tide of communism thats going to sweep up onto our shores and overwhelm us if its not stopped in places like Southeast Asia Exactly what ve been telling Carroll word for word This war is not about communism Its about nationalism The Vietnamese people just want to be free of foreign domination first the French and now the Americans We aint trying to dominate anybody Were just trying to bring freedom At the point of a gun Yeah well sometimes violence is a necessary evil Thats right Thats right It was my turn in And then Carroll and Skip had to go off after Pearl Harbor And pretty soon well its gonna be Alans turn We need to keep Alan around here We gotta groom him to take over one of these days Well now theres plenty of time for that What you want him to come home with a chest full of medals too or get killed Or both Hey Well m just glad got girls and not boys Dont you think youve had enough Father mean youre just a day out of hospital ve had quite enough of you hectoring me about my drinking Its one of the few pleasures that have left And also ve had quite enough of you posing as some sort of military expert Well m no expert but do know something about war was a soldier too Oh yes d forgot Yes you fought in the glorious battle of Singapore The Nips surprised us Yeah Our heavy artillery was pointed seaward and they came up behind us through the jungle And we surrendered to a force a third the size of ours the most disgraceful
