scathing report on us We better waste him l know what to do Let me handle it Fatso You take care of him There had been a lot of rumor in Hong Kong recently This is due to a boxing competition that had been arranged Unfortunately a Chinese boxer rather overestimated himself and challenged our champion Twister reluctantly accepted the challenge and although he held back during the fight Unfortunately the Chinese boxer was so weak that he couldnt stand up to Twisters fists And after a few punches he tragically died We are sorry for this regrettable accident To quell this riot and give Twister justice have decided to organize a Chinesewestern boxing competition Twister will fight the Chinese people in a fair manner on the stage In order to protect my name and reputation ve agreed to fight any Chinese person Now from what l hear the Chinese like to use this And would like to stick to that tradition So ve agreed to fight any challenger for as long as this thing burns And this is a pretty big joss stick so its gonna give plenty of opportunity for any challenger to come forward But be warned l would not hold back y the time this thing has burnt to the end there will be no more Chinese boxer because d have kill them all In fact dont even think that were gonna use this thing because l doubt that there is any Chinese fella that has the guts to get in the ring with me Chinese burns incense not only to tell the time Besides telling the time whats important about the Chinese tradition of incense burning is that it represents our modesty which is inherent to the Chinese culture Mr Miller lm challenging you to a fight Youre making a big mistake Zhun hurry up Dont let the Landlady wait too long lll take you there in a moment Mom why are we staying with the landlady Dads practice
