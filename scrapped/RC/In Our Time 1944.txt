Oh iUh Stephen like your Miss Whittredge So do Stephen faintly m trying to tell you that m in love with her Man thats a very common affliction my boy Fading for every ailment theres a You know how i was living had everything and had nothing Nothing that really mattered You were the one who always wanted me to settle down Settle down yes but with the right girl This is the right girl Stephen did you come here to ask my consent Or to announce your decision d hoped youd give your consent And if dont Well An embarrassing question see Bring the girl in Telephone buzzes Hello Bring her in want to talk to her On telephone yes this is Count Orvid No If France and England wish to make a move Thats their business We have a nonAggression pact with Germany And we intend to keep it As for the Soviet Union think it inadvisable to carry on any conversation With the soviet ambassador at this time It might be misconstrued by our governments m not interested in the protests of the polish people They do not know what is best for them Well if the students at the university continue to riot Call out the police Theyre hotheaded fools and they must be stopped GoodBye If anyone else calls m not here Tell them i am on a boar hunt Come in Uncle Pavel this is Jennifer Whittredge Miss Whittredge How do you do Stephen get a chair for Miss Whittredge Miss Whittredge What have to say to you may sound somewhat strange Even a little harsh But believe me mean it only for your good And for Stephens Yes love my nephew as if he were my son But hes inclined to be Shall say Impractical Impractical in the sense of allowing an emotion To obscure certain considerations That affect you quite as much as himself dont think quite understand what you mean shall try to be very explicit Please uncle do we have to Stephen please until have finished You are english i believe Yes You also have a class which we term aristocratic You must be aware that its members Not only enjoy privileges But also accept certain limitations Particularly in the matter of marriage think i understand that But uncle its something in the past Its different today Our tradition is the faith we live by Its our duty to preserve Not to destroy can see that you are much more realistic than my nephew ll have to rely upon you To decide what is best for both of you Count Orvid all know is that love Stephen Naturally want what is best for him m sure you do Thats why m taking the trouble To acquaint you with the consequences That your marriage would inevitably bring Social ostracism Well perhaps you can adjust yourselves to that But then there is the matter of Stephens career had hoped eventually to find him a place In one of the ministries of our government dont care about the ministries can do something else Yes What Stephen Well Dont know exactly Perhaps could manage the estate The Orvid estate hasnt paid for years know make up the deficits However Stephen money isnt the real concern would not cut you off and add to your embarrassments In fact would feel obligated to increase your allowance To take care of your wife Thats very generous of you uncle That is perhaps the one compensation can offer Miss Whittredge If you and Stephen insist on going through with this And uh if you succeed In adapting yourself to our way of life You would marry into one of Polands great fortunes And your child would be its heir You see am not unfair am giving you both sides Well Stephen really must be going now If you dont mind uncle Excuse me Stephen will you stay please Would you mind waiting in the other room my dear Just for a moment No not at all Miss Whittredge Whatever you do wish you every happiness Thank you ll be right out darling Well Do you realize our train leaves in less than an hour Oh m

building the future Nothing will La lechka knew youd say that Come on Stephen lets finish lunch Stephen as told you before It is very simple to handle a tractor When you plow deep you use the first gear That is for heavy pulling If the load is lighter you use the second And if you want to go faster Let us say back to the barn on a rainy day and you must hurry You use the third Now who will be the first to learn Bucyk Stanislaw Come The tractor wont eat you In fact it will give you more to eat Stephen think there should be Some sort of prize for the first to learn dont you Yes thats right

Please Who else will try Men murmuring dont think they will Whats the matter with you This will make work easy horse is better Why should we risk our lives over work Murmurs of agreement You try bujansky ve had enough Stephen Stephen Stephen please dont be angry This is the first time theyve tried it Oh Jenny theyre stupid They dont care to learn Theyre not even interested But darling weve only just started Give them a chance Theyve been the same way for centuries How can we expect them to change now Well perhaps by changing ourselves Changing ourselves What do you mean Darling listen to me What have we ever done for them ve been in their homes seen how they live just cant tell you how felt It was as if d Well d gone back into some other age Theyve scarcely enough to keep body and soul together So how can we expect them to be interested in work That only gives them the barest existence What can do about it cant raise their wages havent the money Well darling if we cant afford it now Why dont we give them an incentive By promising them something in the future What for instance Well a share in the harvest Then theyll take more interest Because theyll be working partly for themselves No Jenny Things like that arent done Stephen Youre beginning to have doubts about more than the peasants About all were doing arent you No Jenny i didnt say that No not in words But can imagine how often it must have occurred to you What am changing my whole life for and everybody elses And it would be so easy to go back to things the way they were before That was unfair of me m sorry But it just means so terribly much to us That you dont go back to uncle Pavel and all he stands for At least not until weve tried everything What else do you want me to do Well i want you to gamble with me You said the machines would till times as much land If the peasants took hold Right Well then lets give them a chance And if m wrong and we lose Well you can still go back to your uncle They wont even know what we are talking about Well thenThen well explain it to them Oh darling this isnt so new Its been done in America and England and Well think people are pretty much the same everywhere Theyre always looking for a way to make a little better life for themselves And when the peasants realize that then Thenwell Well My serious little girl Oh no darling Look youre trying to change the subject Please promise me youll think it over It means so terribly much to us promise for a kiss Oh you promise you a share in the harvest The harder you work the larger your share will be Well start work tomorrow early Let us say Darling let us say Jenny voiceOver so the peasants learned how to operate the machines They werent stupid after all If you never teach people anything they never learn Its as simple as that They plowed and cultivated and reaped a bountiful harvest The ripe grain ran like the sea across the land Nodding and rippling And the happiness of the people grew Until it was almost more than Stephen and could bear To watch their faces They were gathering the fruits of their labor It was their fruit too Grown as the bible says by the sweat of their brow And by the strength of their muscles And it was sweet to themand to us We are gathered today to give thanks For the rich fullness of our harvest In receiving the fruits of our labor Our hearts even as our hands Are filled to overflowing But now my friends As we share a common blessing We also face a common danger foreign country has cast her eyes on our polish harvest We pray that we may avert the menacing threat of war That god may see fit to darken the sun with storm clouds And let rain fall upon our polish earth The invader might be discouraged If our roads were to turn into a sea of mud Wherein the enemy tanks would be engulfed As were pharaohs chariots under the red sea Now we will kneel and recite the our father Church bells ringing Now that weve thanked heaven for permitting the harvest We should do something to thank the people who helped make it possible Yes thats a good idea What could we do speech from you perhaps Oh no not a speech Not this time Stephen mean a kind of celebration think that would be wonderful kind of celebration to give thanks Thanksgiving Yes thats it like the American holiday Oh darling could we Yes We might have a party in the barn partyThats it But why in the barn Where else Why not at home In our home Yes of course dont know What do you think Jenny Oh darling you know how feel But perhaps it would be nice if you discussed it with your mother Yes uh think i should Chopin mazurka playing Jenny may have one more Uncle Leopold that is your seventh Fifth Fifth ll weaken it The old stump wont sprout without being watered But thought you drank only when you were unhappy Tonight drink because m happy Because see in this room the promise of a new Poland Far better than the old Have a little one with me All right Na zdrowie Na zdrowie Countess Yes dear have a surprise for you cant imagine what it is Oh darling you never forget La lechka Thats enough farmer May have a cup for father josef Yes Here you are Thank you Nice and strong There you are father Laughs na zdrowie Sigmund lets have a polka Take your partners Well have a dance All cheering Uncle Leopold could you forget another vodka For a dance with me My lovely niece that would be intoxicating enough To forget everything including my age Thank you Polka playing May have the pleasure mama Oh my darling i am too old But much too gracious to refuse Very well Hands clapping to music Ah no more You shouldnt have danced My spirit is willing My body is not Its time you were asleep Yes Yes Come darling ll help you upstairs m a little worried about Janina Polka ends Thank you Countess It was a pleasure darling Excuse me Count Stephen Yes Pyotr Your uncle is in the library He wishes to speak to you Thanks The philosopher must be in trouble think youre right Good evening uncle didnt know you were here When did you come Only a few minutes ago You will forgive me for not using your front door Stephen But perhaps you can understand my reluctance to appear at your party May sit down Please Thank you asked to see you alone Oh excuse me But since your wife is here she might as well stay d intended to come to see you sooner Stephen but as you know we face a desperate situation and every moment of my time has been spent in trying to avert war d not even be here tonight except that ve been assured that the german government will not resort to force until we have had more time to discuss the corridor question Thats good news Yes But its most discouraging Stephen am doing everything can to preserve Poland And you are doing just the opposite dont understand Even the walls in this old house must feel strange tonight If youre referring to the peasants being here can assure you that they are behaving most respectfully Naturally Its their first visit May ask why it was necessary to have them here at all It seemed only right to celebrate the harvest With those who helped make it successful As understand they are not only celebrating it But sharing in it as well You are surprised that know But am aware of everything that is going on here However dont blame you completely for what has happened Undoubtedly your wife has been the inspiration for most of your activities Whatever Jenny has done has been for my good and m grateful to her Are you sure its always been for your good What do you mean Count Orvid would you mind explaining that My dear its the nature of a human being To destroy that which he cannot attain Whether you admit it or not You have probably found a great deal of satisfaction In tearing down the tradition of this household Thats ridiculous uncle wont even discuss it Stephen may i please Count Orvid The idea of tearing down The tradition of this household To satisfy myself Has been the furthest thing from my mind My only desire has been to help my husband You accuse me of being destructive Well if helping Stephen to become independent If trying to prevent you from humiliating him as you once did If treating the peasants as human beings is destroying Then perhaps am But know Stephen doesnt share your point of view And today hes in a position to do and think as he pleases Which he wasnt before Not quite You forget that he is my heir And as such he has a duty and responsibility Not only to his class but to his country as well What have done is only decent and just And how run my farm is my business There have to disagree with you Stephen You dont realize the implications of what you have done Democracy is a powerful but dangerous weapon my boy You must be sure that you give it to those Who can use it wisely and carefully Unfortunately the people are neither wise nor careful Witness our present difficulties If we had a strong government They would ignore the people and negotiate peaceful settlement with Germany Instead they have listened to the voice of the mob And nothing but disaster can result Unless can force them to change m sorry uncle i dont agree Someday you will In the meantime i must insist That you consult me about your actions If you dont You will cut yourself off from your family and friends And you will leave me no choice As to my future consideration for you advise you to think it over And if your wife has your interest at heart advise her to think it over also will Count Orvid Boom Sounds like thunder Boom Stephen think saw a flash

Good night Good night Distant explosions continue Boom Glass shatters Stephen Stephen Crying Oh darling Oh thank god youre alive Sobbing Oh darling Darling youre hurt Oh come on darling La lechka Come on darling Jenny Stephen Stephen Uncle Leopold Uncle Leopold Distant bombing continues La lechka Youll be all right darling Stephen Philosopher Whats happened to your regiment There is no more regiment Every man was killed or wounded No more army Stephen please try not to think of it now Thats all think about mechanized divisions Against one planes against Men against machines Horses against tanks They came in a column of fire and steel miles wide We charged But each time men and horses Were ground up in the tracks of the tanks Thousands of them Wheels going around Torn flesh between them The horses screamed But it closed in on us Like a wall of steel Stephen We prayed for rain But the roads were sunbaked hard as concrete The rivers dry It was slaughter Well darling how did you get home dont know jumped on a tank Threw a hand grenade inside Thats the last i remember Then found myself on a wagon not far from here The driver had been killed The horse was gone Man on radio attention Attention Attention Citizens of Warsaw Citizens of Poland The order of the day of the commander of Warsaw Has just been released It reads as follows The commander in chief has entrusted us With the defense of the capital He has demanded that the attack of the enemy Be stalled at the gates of Warsaw At that the devastation of polish territory Come to an end The only report which we can submit must be The order of the day has been carried out And now here is mayor starzynski Our courageous leader with a message for you Starzynski on radio my fellow countrymen On the morning of september Without warning or a declaration of war The german armies crossed our frontiers Violating every rule of international law and common decency We are the target of a barbarian aggression Which has seen no equal in the past centuries Our towns and villages have been recklessly bombarded Our citizens mercilessly shot down And yet this does not weaken my faith In the final victory of Poland In the final victory of justice and freedom You have heard the order of the day Warsaw will be held and defended until the last And if it does fall into the hands of the enemy It will mean that they have entered the city Over the body of its last defender This is an historic opportunity But we need help As much as we can get We call for volunteers wherever they are We believe that our sacrifices will not be in vain And with our blood we shall swing the balance of victory As soon as have finished speaking You will hear the immortal polonaise begin And you will know As long as you hear it being played Warsaw still holds out Death to the enemy Death to fascism Wellwe havent lost yet Theres still something we can do We must get the peasants together want to talk to them ll get them Stephen and even though our army is scattered We mustnt give up as long as there is a chance to fight The first thing you must do is burn and destroy everything in sight Leave nothing for the enemy But the harvest belongs not only to me You all have a share in it And wont burn it without your consent Are you in favor of this Opening phrase from polonaise plays on the radio All yes All shouting agreement knew youd say that As long as there are men and women like you Theyll never destroy Poland Door opens Zofya Stephen Stephen Oh Youre safe Youre safe Thats all can ask for Stephen We thought we would never see you again Uncle Pavel has arranged for a special train To take us to romania And from there we go to monte carlo m sorry mama m not leaving Oh please dont argue You must get away from here as quickly as possible m not leaving Poland mama Butbut Pavel Pavel Stephen isnt going with us Do you realize its only a matter of time Before the whole country is in german hands The mayor of Warsaw has called for help The city is going to stand siege am not running away But its madness Sheer madness To resist The city will be destroyed Well be killed And for what What can be accomplished ve heard you say it before uncle Lets not fight Lets compromise Yes know ve made mistakes But did what i thought was best You did what you thought was best for yourself And now when Poland is crying for help And the people are still defending her You say give up Run away But Stephen No Polonaise continues playing on radio At some point a man must stop compromising At some point he must decide what he wishes to live for And what he will die for This is so futile How long do you think Warsaw can hold out That doesnt matter As long as a nation preserves its honor it will always survive You are his wife Cant you make him understand You must realize how hopeless it is But Count Orvid The people are ready to fight for something That means more than life to them Not just the army the people Those in whom you had such little faith Well Stephen is one of them And nothing can persuade the people That what they are fighting for is hopeless Now m sure you will understand But we havent very much time Very well wish had your faith But havent have nothing left to fight for And now Nothing to live for My world is gone hope you will have better luck GoodBye Polonaise continues on radio ll wait for you in the car Zofya Leopold Uncle wont you go Stephen all my life have done nothing but talk This is my first opportunity to do something You cannot deny me that All right philosopher GoodBye mama GoodBye Jenny GoodBye mother Try to understand Stephen Jenny Polonaise playing on radio You know what you have to do Time is short Go to work All talking at once Stephen youll need this ll go with the peasants Thanks uncle Jenny Darling know what youre going to say But it doesnt matter what happens m with you Distant explosions La lechka Life has been good Stephen And its going to be even better For those that come after us Jenny voiceOver for days and nights The people defended the city of Warsaw Finally it was smashed to ruinsBurned to ashes But the people fought as long as it was possible Until at last starvation and disease forced them to submit Not the nazis Today we have what we needed so desperately then For the first time in history The massed forces of humanity are on the march And like London Bataan Stalingrad Warsaw has become a symbol of the future world We are fighting to achieve That will be achieved In our time
