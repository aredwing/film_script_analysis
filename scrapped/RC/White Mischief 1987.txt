checked stocking which you say you retrieved from the bonfire Yes it is Was there anything peculiar about it Yes l noticed some stains which l took to be blood Recording evidence Lord How long did it take you to walk from the murder spot to the house Twentyfive minutes Was that at a normal pace Yes Thank you superintendent Your witness Mr Morris Chief Superintendent Poppy youre a man of Sound in wind and limb Yes ls there anything in this crime to preclude the possibility of it being the work of a woman No Amongst the letters you found in Lord Errolls house were some from a certain lady notorious for having revenged herself for the disloyalty of a lover by shooting him with a revolver Yes Have you discounted the possibility of her being a suspect l have On what grounds She was in bed with a gentleman at the time We werent doing anything that l can remember Silence At this party to which you refer what did you say to the accused l attempted to console him l dont remember my exact words How would you describe his attitude Morose Bitter Resentful Enough to murder his wifes lover Obiection In my opinion yes Sustained No more questions This moroseness that you describe could it not be attributable to the fact that the accused was obliged to wear womens clothes l do not think so You find that normal lt was simply a party Were you in love with Lord Erroll l was fond of him yes We had been friends for many years l say that you were extremely fond of the deceased That like many women in this court you had been his mistress Obiection Sustained And you are so upset over his death that you have become irrational Objection Strike that from the record Thank you Your defence man is good Damn well should be the amount lm paying him You can afford it Jock Hes a bit rough Hope that wont be a disadvantage No dont worry No jury in Africa is going to convict an English gentleman After all there is a war on Rains are late What are they saying at the club This doesnt help lts Diana l feel sorry for This trial is harder for her than it is for me After its over ld like to get her something special What do you think shed like Pearls Do have anything to say to this scandal Hello You killed him you vicious tart Lady Broughton are you all right l dont even know her Please let us through This is a picture of a cartridge case from Soames farm where the shooting practice took place What brought your attention to it Youll see here here and here these are powder markings The powder is black lt is of an extremely rare type its not been used since the Great War Thank you l would like the jury to reexamine Exhibit His Lordships ear is peppered with black powder May l see it This is too much No further questions Mr Fox remind me Was the revolver stolen from the house of the accused ever recovered No So youve never examined it No Thank you How will the trial affect world opinion l would think the world was far too busy to pay any attention lsnt there a war on Are you the lady the defence counsel referred to Which one The one who shot her husband Which husband lsnt it scandalous that while in England people are suffering rationing l have just the thing for you The way some people behave here in Kenya This is a treacherous climate We all must take care of our skin Countess were you in love with Lord Erroll Of course Everyone was Is that true Its true lm rarely in love but when l am l know it because this violent heat shoots through my nipples Were you very upset by his death No Joss is very lucky Hell always be who he is Hell never grow old l was an officer in the Irish Guards for years l have been a magistrate for years l was the chairman of the bench for county of Chester You have inherited considerable wealth Yes One of your hobbies is horse racing Yes lve owned race horses for over years Winning and losing without regret Certainly Before you married Lady Broughton was any pact made between you governing your future We agreed that if either of us fell in love with anybody else we would release each other So you were fully prepared for the events which followed even though you did not welcome them lt was a risk worth taking When did you first learn of the affair with your wife When Lady Delamere told me Did you feel any bitterness or resentment No Only sadness My only choice was to resign myself to the situation What did you decide to do l decided to go to Ceylon on my own and return after three months to see if my wife had changed her mind Was that likely Girls do Did you know of Lord Errolls reputation as a ladies man l would prefer not to answer that unless much pressed Let us come to the evening of January rd You dined with your wife Lady Carberry and the deceased at the Muthaiga Club What was the atmosphere Very jolly as l recall Lady Carberry has stated that you drank heavily that night l may have had a little too much She says she accompanied you home and helped you upstairs l cant remember She may have Do you swear under oath that you did not leave the house l could not have left without someone hearing me The house was full of servants ls it true that while Ieaving with your regiment for France in you were laid low by a severe case of sunstroke Yes And the British Army medical board found that as a result of that you suffered a weakness in your right leg and hand and night blindness Yes Chief Superintendent Poppy a man sound in wind and limb walked from the scene of the crime to your house in minutes Would you be physically capable of doing that No l would not Chief Superintendent Poppy mentioned the burning of some rubbish on the day after the murder We saw the remains of a checked stocking he found there You did not recognise the stocking lve never owned a pair of checked stockings in my life May l ask why you decided to light a bonfire on this day lt needed to be done l was distressed by Lord Errolls death l thought it might cheer me up lve always loved a bonfire Do you consider yourself a sportsman and a gentleman ln short a man of your word l do Thank you You may sit if you wish Thank you Sir Delves ls it a coincidence that Lord Erroll was shot with a revolver like the one stolen from you lve not thought about it Youve not thought about it You thought it flattering for a man to fall in love with your wife l think it is One always likes to see ones possessions admired The same as if you have a beautiful picture Exactly But its a very different thing when your friend instead of admiring your picture proceeds to remove it from the wall and take it away with him What was your reaction to Lord Errolls death l was dumbfounded But wasnt it a satisfactory solution to your troubles Not at all What do you mean No man would relish resuming life with a woman who was madly in love with another man even if that man were dead The car isnt here lm sorry Are you still in love with Lord Erroll l love my husband One more question Lady Broughton what would you say Lady Broughton My car hasnt arrived Lady Broughton may l ask you one question Are you still in love with Lord Erroll lm extremely grateful Do you find the accused Sir Henry Jock Delves Broughton guilty or not guilty of the murder of Captain the Right Honourable Josslyn Victor Hay nd Earl of Erroll and Baron Kilmarnok Not guilty my Lord Silence Is that the verdict of you all It is my Lord The accused is acquitted and discharged Bad luck Walter Didnt get me that time Our whole way of life here is over That man has done for all of us Thats not funny Whats not funny Lizzie says everyone

be held at her grave is for Alice who does nothing right her beloved she yearns for each night is for Colvile whos gone off his head for de Trafford who hates being wed is for everyone hot and in season is for fucking we like with good reason is for Gwlady looking round for the fight is for heartaches to the left and to the right l is Idina so fragile so frail is for Joss a sting in her tail
