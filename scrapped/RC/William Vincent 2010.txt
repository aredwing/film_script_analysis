Dear Ann ve come back to New York Some years ago you asked me about myself What are you doing you asked didnt answer then but want to now When youve read this letter if you wanna come away with me if you want me to take you from here tell Victor you can trust him Hell find me ll start somewhere near the beginning William is not my name few years before met you was returning from a place d always wanted to visit Japan was transferring in San Francisco to a flight home Once was back on the plane asked if could go back to the boarding area because had left a book there By the time found my book the gate had closed so sat and read my book until the plane took off without me decided to take the long bus ride across the country to my home in Connecticut just outside of New York Several hours into the trip heard on the radio that the plane missed had crashed into a mountain closed my eyes and slept The next day learned that they had not been able to recover any bodies The plane and all the passengers had been incinerated on impact got off the bus in New York and decided to stay for a while realized that for all anyone knew no longer existed For no particular reason without really thinking about it bought a passport under the name of William Vincent took a class and learned a trade and got a job editing nature videos for use in the schools think thats what theyre used for m not really sure managed to find an empty storefront to live in in a neighborhood in Chinatown not far from the East River Okay Yes From They can hover in midair They can hover in midair by rapidly flapping their wings They can fly backwards and are the only group of birds able to do so They can also stop in midair Hummingbirds are continuously hours away from starving to death and are able to store just enough energy to survive overnight Hummingbirds are capable of slowing down their metabolism at night or any other time food is not readily available They enter a hibernationlike state known as torpor During torpor the heart rate and rate of breathing are both slowed dramatically the heart rate to roughly reducing the need for food The most astonishing quality of hummingbirds is their ability to broadcast color Hummingbirds radiate like hot coals in the sun The color that reaches your eye is created by pigment which absorbs some colors and rejects others Like soap bubbles hummingbirds color comes from iridescence not pigment It winks on and off depending on the light source and the angle of the viewer Thats a nice dress Whered you get it Its a kimono know its a kimono

scotch is Youre very beautiful Wow Joseph Sorry enjoyed tormenting the man in the bar and think it was nice that might have made the woman happy Even for a moment Even if didnt care about her There hadnt been many that had cared about Only two brothers that d known when was a teenager back in the town where grew up d lost touch with the two brothers but thought of them often and saw them in a way in parks on the street different places And saw them as d known them as young boys not as the adults they would be now It was a lovely thing to imagine but knew it was just that Imagined But saw them as if they were really there wondered how they were where they were Anyway wherever they are its probably best that they dont know me given the man ve become knew them when was this age the age am now in this shot m now so the things remember are from a long time ago His name was Joseph back then not William He did some odd things but think he was a nice person Maybe a little He could run very fast We used to race He was a beautiful runner Really beautiful runner d been living as William Vincent for three years before met you In that time we might have passed near to one another and not known it wonder if either of us might have felt something in the passing If it happened For instance wonder if you were nearby that night saw that man wearing suspenders and a bow tie Hes just kind of drifting down the sidewalk looking at his phone What the fuck The man just walked away unaware that had lifted some things from his pocket Just a receipt and a business card Nothing But it seemed as if there was something else in the air that night Something odd It was an unusually quiet empty night But felt as if something had happened There was something wrong that night but didnt mind might have even liked it went out to eat still with the sense that there was somewhere wrong in this city somewhere Hi Hey What time is it Its late Whats the occasion Do need an occasion You are an occasion This place sucks Watching whats going on You dont have to flatter me you know Is that a good tip Excuse me Is that a decent tip Yeah it is Hes just trying to earn a living Youre a fucking asshole Open the iris all the way and bring the condenser up The subject now appears against a dark background just like aspen leaves against a dark sky The color seen in dark filled lighting can give new information Dark filled lighting is a good technique for viewing the smallest observable life forms And also helps us understand that William never meant any harm Nor did he mean any kindness He never meant anything We can take the risk if if were able to Right dont know that were able to and dont know that we need to wait for everything Excuse me Excuse me think you might have taken something of mine dont think so Give me my phone Like said dont think so m not fucking around Give me my phone Okay Does your friend have a problem dont know how can make this any clearer want you to
