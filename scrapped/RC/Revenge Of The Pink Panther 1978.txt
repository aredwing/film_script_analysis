flag is lowered to halfmast The president has declared a day of national mourning Only a few hours ago the great detective stood in this very courtyard and was decorated by the president for outstanding service to his country According to the coroners report Chief lnspector Clouseau was probably dead before his car hit the telephone pole and burst into flames The president called me at this morning dozen countries have offered the services of their finest detectives but the president made it painfully clear that this must be solved by Frenchmen and quickly or we can all hand in our resignations spoke with Dr Laprone at the hospital and he assures me that Dreyfus is completely cured Its amazing ve seen some lunatics in my time They were all pikers compared with Dreyfus He was like a wild animal Didnt he actually bite you Oh yes On the leg had to take rabies shots just in case The doctor swears that his recovery is complete He said that in the last hours Dreyfus has literally become a new man Thank God for that because we need him If anyone knows about Clouseau and who might have murdered him that man is former Chief lnspector Charles Dreyfus Isnt it fantastic Doctor Reinstated at my former rank with no loss of pay or social benefits Yes It could actually be called a psychic rebirth am in your debt shall be eternally grateful only helped led the way But in the final analysis it was your victory Charles Our victory Paul But only at the expense of another Huh Oh Clouseau you mean It could be said that he died so that you might live wish could feel sorry You feel no guilt None To be honest when first heard he was dead there were a few moments when was actually convinced was in a state of grace Is that wrong It isnt a matter of right or wrong Look hated him He literally drove me out of my mind as you know Isnt it natural that should feel happiness even joy at the thought of him being dead out of the way and gone forever Natural yes But there is a danger that such feelings might promote guilt Clouseau could come back and haunt you have no guilt Not now Not ever Clouseau is gone and am free forever Now have a cigar Thank you Charles ve made the necessary arrangements for your release The surete is sending a car for you to be picked up at Remember youre on probation for months If you have any problems call on me immediately Thank you Paul
