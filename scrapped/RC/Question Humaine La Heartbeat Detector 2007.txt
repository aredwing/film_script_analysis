Mr Jst Since restructuring we store all our data on computer staff changes recruitment reports layoffs Itll be two years until everything is computerized How far back can you go To the opening of our branch in They kept records back then Of course found the files you asked for on the Farb Quartet They last played together eight years ago Have you been asked to look into it No Why had to get permission to access the archives Really No its my own idea What would you think of an orchestra in the factory Management is obviously interested Karl Rose gave his consent immediately hope it wont be old fogey music We want to get down Youre good at that Why dont you come to our parties did Remember No Thats the point You came to two then played dead get down but play dead Youre annoying Simon dont mean to be Was it you who called me Jacques Paolini Yes We can talk in a caf if you like have very little time and even less to say to you Who told you about the quartet Some of the old guys who miss it Really The Farb Quartet brings back bad memories What do you mean Take four cards a king a queen a jack and a six Or a king of spades a ten of clubs a six of diamonds and a three of hearts You cant win You have to throw in your hand m sure you can guess the cards a a secretary a sales rep and a chemist Music doesnt tolerate hierarchy The Franck quartet was a disaster Was Mr Jst the violinist How did he play He was extremely tense obsessively exact He was so meticulous he stifled the music Perfectionism belies an appalling fear of emptiness Why are you interested in the Quartet Management has asked me to come up with some ideas for the events committee thought it would be fun to start an orchestra Forget it Factory workers dont like classical music Other stuff is better techno house heartpounding beats You must know about raves My sons at Polytechnique Thats all he listens to You cant be serious Techno at Farb Why not What does management listen to Violence is a thriving market a way to let off steam a kind of necessary ritual Remember getting ragged when we were students m going m late already Mr Jst would be mad if he knew was worried about him Hes a very thoughtful man He has difficult moments like everybody else personal problems Dont worry m here to help not judge Everything you say will remain between us Mr Jst sometimes gets very sad terrible loss hes never gotten over The sadness can last for months Its very painful but its only human isnt it Of course Sadness frightens people People avoid you like the plague Got a cigarette You close your eyes like a friend havent seen in years Really pianist melancholic woman But m not sad Mr Jst isnt sad by nature Just now and then Its no big deal Mr Tessier Hello Hello come in Hello Mr Tavera Hello Please come in All right We can talk for an hour or longer if you wish think an hour and a half would be good All right Todays meeting has a dual purpose to get to know each other Well focus less on your work experience and more on you as a person Your likings aspirations and desires When weve finished if youve any questions about our company feel free to ask them certainly will How would you like me to begin Its very simple If you had some close friends here whod studied with you how would they describe you Thats a surprising question My mother would say was studious She made me join a class for gifted children My girlfriend would say it didnt prepare me for the real world What do you mean by that cant cook Touching food makes me nauseous Have you tried to overcome it for her What does she do Were not married We dont even live together For now m concentrating on my career Excuse me Yes Its me Hello Mr Jst Yes m researching the Farb Quartet have a few questions to ask wont take up much of your time Fine Thank you You were talking about your career Can you tell me why youve applied for a job with us What do you expect from the company There are more opportunities for career advancement here You want to move up quickly Yes To be honest if accept the job at Total d have a good profile after a few years But think that people move up the ladder quicker here What makes you think that asked around and read the trades This company is a hitech industry leader so people get promoted quickly So your research has convinced you that this is your best bet Yes thats exactly how d describe it How can help you Since the restructuring feel the staff need to bond to get together have parties something that could even involve families So m looking into forming one or more company orchestras inspired by the quartet you formed Meaning play an instrument Most play piano but there are violinists percussionists and guitarists d like to contact them and ask if theyd like to give some concerts Maybe you have some suggestions for the repertoire How is your name spelled Kessler You arrived here after the Quartet broke up Who told you about it The senior executives and Mr Paolini your cellist ve heard a lot about your seminars It seems you get our executives doing group therapy stuff right Yes amongst other things The company cant be an abstract entity Its economic health depends on its staffs physical and mental health My goal is simple to push our executives to their limits and use this motivation within the production unit Our executives have to become competitive again so that we can return to our production levels Its hard for some of them ll have a look may have a recording in my own archives Fine Aimless wandering In search of what youll never find tramway from beginning to end Meaningless journeys And the bitterness of not knowing Where to go or what to lean on All you see are people Who come and go Unconnected Almost crippled By misery By misery Sometimes life Is like a fantasy When you expect it least It gives you what you wanted most Even if it takes it away again Afterwards If what m saying is a lie If its not the truth May God punish me May He punish me if he wants to People who believe Their way is right Are easily lead astray In the vile comedy of love What good is a soul to us Youre better off Going your own way Than lying to those you meet What good is a soul to us Youre better off Going your own way Yes Good evening like to know youre alive Now Why not dont pursue my desires He who clings to a dream Because of one kiss Only sees the flipside of life What exactly is your job You work for a big company but what do you do Why do you ask Youre on call No m not Look what time they call you Dont those guys ever sleep Which guys Your boss My boss shouldnt have my number You dont have to go then Well no but guess will If it gets nasty call me Maybe you dont know that love Despite its own laws Bewilders peoples

pretext that d forgotten my lighter couldnt refuse her invitation was completely wrapped up in the story The anger that had surged through me that night was soothed by the blue eyes of the woman talking to me As you must have seen my husband is not well Music is an insurmountable ordeal for him He says he feels pain Knives slicing through his body Thats what he says But what terrifies me are his eyes Its like hes lost control want to show you something As followed her the sight of her neck gave me incredible pleasure resisted could have either kissed her or bitten her He shuts himself in his study at night hear him pacing around and talking to himself wanted to take his handgun away because he says dreadful things but its no longer in the drawer What a good dog What a dear dog Saphi The other day caught him here He was sleeping on the floor by our little Alos crib Imagine his big body took his hand He let me lead him away Mrs Rose and were great friends but he stopped me from

Shut up dont know you bitch Remember No No nothing didnt say that to you Wait Tell me Yes was just leaving Fine The business world is unforgiving How do you reconcile the human factor with the companys need to make money How did you cope with the restructuring process was only indirectly involved Dont be so modest You played a major role in the decisionmaking process Yes was there But you made the project a success You were the one behind it Thanks to your dynamic collaboration asked you to refine the employee evaluation criteria You really gave us your all We went from units to We recovered our shareholders It was a huge success The quality of the files you presented was most impressive You know exactly how to define selection criteria according to the companys needs Thats your strength Mr Kessler ve never hesitated to hire a candidate you put forward And ve never had cause to regret it Unfortunately others have made mistakes which have caused us serious financial damage Its their loss too Recruitment costs money One has to accept ones responsibilities pay them to choose the right people Today theres not one alcoholic left in the factory Before restructuring we created special jobs for them to be charitable You had no qualms about laying people off They gave us real safety problems in some areas Of course You didnt give an inch when the unions tried to intervene You stood your ground They didnt know the risk we were running Keeping on sick workers Icoholism is a sickness Theyd be incapable of responding to an emergency Imagine a vital pump breaking You have to react immediately Theres no room for error The workshops are dangerous Theres gas hydrogen Disaster is always looming Safety regulations were ignored ve seen specialists handling toxic products without gloves or masks Weve got hydrogen sulphide nitrogen oxide phenol Take your pick And they blame it on staff shortages Crap just couldnt let it go for their safety and for ours And you were right never noticed you worked outside office hours m well aware that Karl Rose told you to keep an eye on me He gave you this task Hes turning my own people against me Karl Rose has decided to undermine me If he wants to get rid of me its because he knows ve got some extremely serious confidential and compromising information Karl Rose used to be known as Karl Kraus In Heinrich Himmler founded the Lebensborn movement literally source of life gathering from shelters and maternity wards Aryan children many of whom were orphans By the end of the war these children had been adopted by German families which was the case of Karl Rose He is a Lebensborn child It obviously isnt his fault He grew up in a family nostalgic for the Schwarzen Orden and maintained dubious links with people sharing the same ideology have concrete proof of this He sent donations to a bogus company which passed them on to an extreme rightwing group which had its own paramilitary cell have all this information at my disposal Do you understand now Now you can do as you like ve said everything have to say Hows your little orchestra going Did scare you No Where are you going Whats wrong Whats going on Whats happening Stop it What My lover is a madman Look Youre cold Dark as a prison Yes now m scared The letter Rose sent me filled me with unhealthy curiosity It looked like an ordinary technical report full of production figures and staff data Rose wanted to draw my attention to the differences between the version written in German by Jst and the typed copy Lynn Sanderson Concern Selection Reintegration Restructuring plan Relocation Concern Selection Reintegration Restructuring plan Relocation Reading the handwritten letter again noticed that it was full of missing words as if Jsts mind contained a censoring device like a computer virus deleting certain words and leaving blanks as if they belonged to a forbidden secret language One morning was struggling to complete a routine selection file It was the first time d felt distaste even disgust for my job called in sick with the flu Jsts report is due at the end of the week but cant write a word m going to make a hole need your cigarette What Dont move let it burn push it well in Do it again Annoying isnt it Usually only do it once Is it lit Youre trying it on the cashmere Cashmere burns well It works the same way Dont move Oh whats going on ll give you another one Good evening gentlemen Police Hands on the table Stop playing please What did we do Mathias This accident has really shaken me up Have you spoken to the doctors Yes of course But they were very discreet didnt find out much And Mrs Jst She says her husband is very sensitive Since their childs death hes had bouts of severe sadness Of course You could have tried harder to find out what really happened Mrs Jst was very distressed didnt want to press her further Before this incident what was your clinical opinion of him Hes difficult to read Hes highly principled with a strong sense of duty workaholic with a one track mind Hes suffering from exhaustion Despite his hard exterior he seems very sensitive to what he calls the human question Where did you meet Here in his office How many times Twice You mentioned a third meeting just now The first time was over the phone As said tried to find out more to ask more personal questions but without success He is very wary You mean hes paranoid No meant his irascible nature makes it hard for him to confide in people Hes just going through a hard time Hes got worries that might lead to a personal crisis The kind weve all been through What do you mean the kind weve all been through Its a phase more than a crisis Its not depression An ordeal Thats a better way of putting it Wait a minute Is it a crisis or not Depression or not You mentioned exhaustion What kind Thats the impression got Maybe he just needs a vacation Theres a difference between clinical exhaustion and needing a break And his secretary She doesnt think theres a problem You must be joking Shes the one who first alerted me She spoke of a breakdown depression discrepancies in his work If brought you in it was to report on his mental decay To be honest this assignment is causing me great distress Whats making you pull back What are you keeping from me want to know everything Everything is in the file Youre contradicting yourself playing dumb and avoiding questions think the mans just tired Youre lying You lied about seeing him When know you saw him at his house needed a clearer picture of him What happened Nothing just gave him a file dont understand your distress Youre not making yourself clear By calling a personal crisis a phase youre either trying to create a smoke screen or deliberately misleading me with unrelated facts think was wrong in coming to you overestimated your professional abilities Youre a dutiful subaltern but you lack imagination For a moment saw him as Jst had Karl Kraus child of the Schwarzen Orden nobodys child one of another breed of children all perfect and alike child with no childhood no heart no soul no descendants child from the new pure technical generation For over a year Karl Rose has been blackmailing me couldnt stand it anymore betrayed Mathias was afraid of reprisals and his state of health scared me Its kind of you to have come so quickly You sounded worried on the phone was Mathias girlfriend at the time of the Quartet We grew apart because of his unpredictable and violent behavior He drove me home after rehearsals found poetic letters he had left me Mathias was an anxious possessive lover obsessed with the idea that wed be caught loved Mathias Hes been nursing his sorrow for so long ve often seen him cry still love the inconsolable child in him His wife was at the hospital Did she tell you what happened Not really think he passed out Youre not telling me the truth Mathias father was called Thodor During the war he was in a police battalion He collaborated with the during the occupation in Poland and Belarus He did more than just administrative tasks There were many Jews there He was involved in relocating them if you see what mean Got a cigarette Mathias never knew exactly what his father did But he did witness one particular event One day in the early s he was eating out with his father man recognized Thodor Jst He came and spoke to him Thodor pretended not to hear him but the boy remembered what the man said saw you in Miedzyrzec in October There were women and children lying by the cemetery wall Remember Thodor Jst got up grabbed his son and left Next day the man was waiting outside the school He gave Mathias a note addressed to his father The boy couldnt resist reading it Miedzyrzec place and some figures He asked his father Wheres Miedzyrzec What is His father beat him shut him in the cellar yelled death threats through the door One day in the bathroom he tried to drown him The child wondered what the bodies were doing face down on the ground Daddy there were women and children lying by the cemetery What were the bodies doing there What were the children doing Daddy what were the bodies doing The women on the ground The bodies the children Were the children dead can feel it Its going to fall can feel its going to snow It will be beautiful Hello sir Do you have a cigarette Come with me please Come with me m happy you came couldnt ask Lucy Here Apart from you dont know who Its pure lies Youll see how spiteful men can be Should read them Do what you like Its worthless disgusting repugnant past Lies My father wasnt in Berlin at the time He wasnt a technician He was just a shopkeeper in Hamburg He was forced to enlist in a Polish battalion in the east of the country have nothing to do with this The envelope contained three letters Jst had kept them on him They were anonymous posted in Le Mans The first sent a year ago wellknown to Shoah historians Enclosed was a facsimile of a memo written by an engineer dated June th stamped Secret Affairs of State Since December in exemplary fashion using three vans without any sign of defect The explosion in Kulmhof should be seen as an isolated case caused by an operational error Special instructions have been addressed to the services concerned to avoid such incidents One To facilitate rapid distribution of carbon monoxide without pressure buildup two centimeter vents will be made at the top of the rear wall These vents will be fitted with adjustable metal valves Two The normal load capacity is from to pieces per meter squared But the large Saurer vans cannot be used for that many The problem is not one of overloading but the effect of maximum loading on the vehicles maneuverability It therefore seems necessary to reduce the cargo area by one meter Reducing the number of pieces as weve been doing is not the answer because the empty space must also be filled with carbon monoxide The manufacturer pointed out that making the van shorter at the rear would cause the cargo to shift towards the front and might overload the axle In fact there is a natural compensation in the distribution of the load There is a natural compensation in the distribution of the load caused by the fact that during the operation the load tends to force its way towards the rear doors and ends up lying in this area Consequently the front axle is not overloaded Three The pipe that connects the exhaust to the van tends to rust because it is eaten away from the inside by liquids that flow into it Pointing the nozzle downward prevents this from happening Four To facilitate cleaning a watertight drain will be installed in the floor The cover of the to centimeter opening will be fitted with an elbow siphon to allow for the drainage of thin liquids during the operation Thicker dirt will be disposed of through the large drainage hole during cleaning To enable this the floor can be tipped slightly Five The observation windows can be eliminated as theyre rarely used This will save a great deal of money Six Grills should cover the lamps high enough to make it impossible to break the bulbs Experience shows they can be done away with However when the back door is closed and it gets dark inside the load pushes hard against the door This is because the merchandise rushes towards what little light remains as it gets dark This hampers the locking of the door It has been noticed that the fear aroused by the darkness provokes screaming when the doors are locked It seems expedient to keep the lights on before and during the start of the operation Lighting is also useful for night work and for cleaning the van You cant sleep here m not asleep You must have fainted then Really Come on Thank you Come and drink something No m fine should call a doctor No thank you Where do you live Nearby The memo had been submitted for examination and decision to Obersturmbannfhrer Rauff It had been signed By order of Jst Feeling better What did you mean by black as a prison Why did you say that You frightened me thought you were going mad We kissed We wanted each other We were going upstairs And then you remembered your mail You went to get it When you came back you had changed You were a different man Cold You really hurt my wrists It was the other guy that did it He must have been hiding in the hallway He appeared out of nowhere Louisa Lets go back to before the mail touched your breast With my other hand remember was stroking your back felt you against me pressing against my stomach took you in my hand When was a child d close my eyes and see the sun through my eyelids It was red frightening like an explosion could no longer feel Louisas body clung onto her flesh could no longer see her eyes face without a mouth sort of body without arms or legs The second letter Jst had given me was composed of pieces from the report pulled apart broken up deconstructed The words were scattered over a sheet of music didnt know it but held the proof of the senders identity Whats the good news Mr Corporate Shrink Hello Mr Paolini Whisky wine pastis Whisky Its not my office but its better than in that busy cafeteria Have you ever played this piece Its short It must be the Franck the second movement We had a go at it May the composer forgive us Why are you so obsessed by the Farb Quartet As told you m forming a little orchestra If organized a concert this summer would you take part What an appalling idea Here No ve always hated company parties They make me think of mass burials thought the young executives could meet the old boys They were all really fond of the quartet Which old boys The few that are left have forgotten it or have gone deaf by now The quartet was total crap Youre lying No one would have talked about us Yes Lynn Sanderson did She was madly in love She couldnt hear a thing We only had one real musician Arie Neumann He was great He came from marketing He was laid off during the restructuring program He was an amazing guy Lynn never mentioned him No The quartet broke up when he stopped coming to rehearsals Did you stay in touch No dont know what happened to him Why arent you answering You have clients Have you seen the time Youre right Its stupid Shall we go Mr Paolini lets go somewhere else Its hell here dont have the time m sorry just got this letter It was addressed to me personally At least look at it Why dont you sign the letters you send Do you find this revolting game funny didnt write it Please stop bothering me ve received a second anonymous letter this time at my home m angry and frightened Like the letters sent to Mathias Jst it was posted in Le Mans It mostly consists of ordinary phrases taken from a corporate psychology manual that know well but invaded and devoured by another text can see a clear allusion to my job and my contribution to the eradication of all those whom judged affected by alcoholism absenteeism and unable to meet the companys criteria Any element unfit for work will be dealt with accordingly in line with the objective criteria as one deals with a sick limb Well bear in mind items such as according to abilityconvertibility not forgetting the regularly updated evaluation codes It must be remembered that faulty individuals may have a negative influence on their successors Security checks will employ modern electronic technology to detect stowaways and other undesirable elements in the vans by picking up carbon gas emissions in the breath Weve recently installed heartbeat detectors which are more efficient and enable us to detect signs of life The device will examine each vehicle No one can escape it since the beginning of the year The engineers are pleased with their results We used to arrest per day This figure has now dropped to a month thanks to increased FrancoBritish collaboration in this field Our operation will progressively spread to all French and English ports affected by the same problems found this article in a daily paper from February Here you are Enjoy your meal Thank you beer please News from Patrice He got attacked And Hes going to report it Hes right Goodbye Whats wrong with him Bladder stones Its something cats get Couldnt you have prevented it No you cant do much about it Almost all cats get them know but After a certain age its bound to happen Give him a little kiss from me okay always get Kimsala and Kimsal mixed up Its Timsal always get it wrong say it every morning Its crazy Did he say it was serious It happens to cats when theyre nine know Just give him a little kiss for me Another coffee please Its been ages ll give him a hug Even if its a cat we dont care promise ll give him a cuddle Hell be happy m going over there Dont forget your knife Thank you Hello Hi Philippe How are you Arie Neumann Yes thats me You wrote to me Sit down Its cowardly to send letters without signing them Why did you come to see me Your last letter was particularly insulting You could have ignored it You could have just burned it Maybe But wanted to see your face Each one of these texts is signed with a name or by the system that produced them Its perverse to hide like this Its not human Youre right Those are the exact words not human gratuitous play on Jsts name play on a name one word for another resemblance Its so common these days Language is a powerful means of propaganda Its the most public and the most secret at the same time The effect of this propaganda isnt produced by speeches articles and flyers It seeps into the masses flesh and blood Did you know we dont have poor people anymore Only people on modest incomes We no longer talk of issues such as social issues but problems that our specialists split up into a series of technical details For each one theyll find the optimum solution Efficient methods But But words emptied of all meaning Its a break down of the language dead language Neutral Invaded by technical words language which gradually absorbs its humanity Understand see a gray truck crossing the city Its an ordinary steel panel truck heading towards the mines two or three kilometers from the last houses Neither the driver nor the escorting officer look back through the observation window into the truck Theyre tired Theyve still got transports before night falls in difficult conditions All the more difficult because in the first few minutes of the transport they have to run the engine at full throttle to drown out the screams and the strange lurches and jolts that almost make the truck topple over Fortunately things soon go quiet again and the transport is always completed on time in keeping with the schedule Where do the trucks go asks the child standing at the window At nightfall the child sees the vehicles lined up in the schoolyard He sees the drivers handing around a bottle of Schnapps The men are exhausted happy to end a day which began like the others much too early The escorts finish off writing up their figures and hand in their daily reports The child sees his father the officerforeman slap each man on the back and joke with each in turn The officer thinks that if the weathers fine and theres no rain to bog down the trucks he might be able to finish his mission by the end of the week And his superior the Obersturmbannfrher who issued the order from a place kilometers away will congratulate him on the smoothrunning of the operation If you were to ask each man what he was doing he would reply Everythings going as planned although its possible were a little behind schedule Hed answer using that same dead neutral technical language which makes him a truck driver an escorting officer an Unterfhrer a foreman a scientist a technical director an Obersturmbannfhrer Were you the child at the window The child at the window was OfficerForeman Neumanns son He didnt want to tell me his first name but know Arie wasnt the one his father gave him The musicians took their places and saw the scene from my dream Arie Neumann came in last holding his violin He remained standing looking directly at me saw a man go towards the door but didnt shout for him to stop saw the black mass of tangled bodies Merchandise Cargo saw a world of nakedness under the yellowish cagedin light which slid down a lightly sloping floor exposing a hand a leg a crushed face a twisted mouth bleeding Fingers clutching a dirty undergarment stained with urine vomit blood sweat drool Liquid Here was part of a back the head and arms buried under other bodies There a body entwined around another And all these bodies Pieces Rolling over one another shifting the weight of the mass towards the pit All these corpses tangled up still muddled together but slowly separating from the mass with the shifting weight Shifting weight Each one gradually pulling out of the suffocating human embrace grimacing face turned blue stuporous And beneath The shit Little children cradled in womens legs Scrawny old men little girls with sunken eyes naked boys covered in bruises All these creatures Pieces who had names Pieces Mose Moshe My brother Robert My father Armand Miguel Amos Hannah Samuel Pieces My mother My love Pieces My sister Simone Magdalena Each of these bodies gradually emerging from this vast naked sea to fall one after the other in pairs in bundles into the dark hole of the mine Darkness sea of bodies buried swallowed up
