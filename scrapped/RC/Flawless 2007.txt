regime is our fault What are the Soviets saying m afraid the Russians are leading the charge Theyre pressing for sanctions Theyre going to war with us the week that we are renewing their contracts We dont need the Russians With respect sir if the soviets broke away it would be disastrous They could align with Botswana Sierra Leone or even Angola Combined production would exceed our own We would no longer control global supply The cartel collapses and prices would free fall The Russians are paid well above market They wont break ranks In any case officials from the Soviet diamond trading organization are en route as we speak Precisely To end our relationship Very well Now we have two days Two days to find a solution Wait wait uh um one final item d like you to join me in

Always the first to arrive and the last to leave Your colleagues must value your dedication Whats that bit from the uh from the Bible You know he who is last shall be first and he who is first shall be last Is that how it goes Yeah What a load of rubbish We all know you take what you desire Fortune favors the bold Take those South Africans for example Do you think we should hand them their freedom or let them seize it for themselves Well thats an interesting debate but a dangerous one maybe But for my money d say things are never as simple as they would seem m sure youre right Miss Quinn Youre the one with the suit Good night Good luck Living dangerously Miss Quinn Recklessly Henry Recklessly Man Something troubling you Miss Quinn The existing Russian contract propose we simply extend it m sorry Youve lost me Was it not you that suggested the Russians were on their way here to sever all ties If we allow the soviets to publicly disassociate with London Diamond let them pound the table at the denounce racist capitalism and so on and so on but secretly we extend our contract and keep it a strictly private matter at least until the storm has passed over While they continue to wholesale diamonds at a magnificent price Thats not bad Thats not bad at all Who else have you told about this Man Its much better now than it ever was Second man In such a short time Laura is that you Harold Reynolds good god Gentlemen this lady is the cleverest person ve ever met and shes American Ran circles around the lot of us at Oxford Of course dont talk to her anymore She turned me down for dinner three times was just testing his resolve If he had tried one more time would have said yes m with allied banking heading up syndications Weve just been sweating over your accounts lot of ice down there No doubt impressive but its making people nervous But now know youre here can sleep a little easier Um unless of course youre considering a career change with allied banking world domination can also be arranged Henry Earliest and brightest as usual Miss Quinn Oh do my best Henry Thank you No you wont Miss Quinn Miss Quinn Why dont we sit in there Mr Hobbs Yes Mr Hobbs m flattered but m m m really not looking Oh please please dont panic Miss Quinn m m a happily married man And wouldnt be so courageous have a proposal to put to you Its its a trifle Just give me five minutes Please Come and sit Its something do to get sympathy War wound The Blitz My wife and we went for some music at Wiltons Very explosive performance Anyway we both survived that one only to find out that my wife was living on borrowed time thought you were happily married Oh am Miss Quinn And always will be Are you always in the habit of reading private correspondence Would you hold these for me please Correspondence This is more like a diary of frustration Number of Lon Di subsidiaries worldwide Number of female Managing Directors That first number is not correct Its now but the other number that is quite accurate Youve succeeded in arousing my curiosity Now m wondering what it is you want Well think the question is Miss Quinn is what is it that you want Hey this is ridiculous Theyre theyre going to knock over a bank in the middle of London in broad daylight could have your job for this Yeah and they might just give it to you know that youve been passed over six times in the last three years for someone less qualified than you You know this has been illuminating but am really am very very busy Miss Quinn please Please sit down Please sit down Please havent got to my point yet Theyre going to fire you Excuse me Yes your ingenious Russian proposal How do you know about that How do you know all of my business Shh Shh m only trying to help You know its extraordinary the conversations people will have in front of their cleaners Its like like we dont exist What conversations Well m not a businessman but certainly got the gist of it What conversations Well the Russians wont accept your plan unless its kept secret among senior staff and only the senior staff They dont seem to think that you qualify Well dont believe you Well uh you youre probably right The ramblings of an old man eh Who would notice Hey this is a good bit Look there Would you like a peanut Oh is in Hes just left Thats odd Someone from the Prime Ministers Office is in the lobby Says he has an appointment Hmm Oh no thats not right at all Ahem Well seem to be the end of the whole restaurant You look wonderful Well heard reinvention was the latest craze Thought d try it on for size Thank you for seeing me Well dont thank me too quickly Um ahem Its bad news m afraid We cant offer you a position Really why not Theres a conflict of interests Lon Di is our largest client back to the Boer War We funded Ernest Ashtoncrofts first diamond mines years ago Well its done all the time You simply ask their permission to speak with me Say know nothing about it unsolicited That sort of thing did Look and tell you this in confidence as an old friend But theyre saying youre grossly incompetent Claim you botched their relations with the Russians That is absolutely ridiculous am sorry Word came down quietly you are not to be touched by us or in all likelihood by anyone doing business with Lon Di Well thats every last company on earth You said you um had something else to discuss Well feel stupid now was going to finally accept your offer of dinner Well that um would have to be unadventurous Married now five years three rather boisterous girls to prove it You should come over one Sunday Mmm good soup Early lunch Miss Quinn Very early and very long m taking the afternoon off Placed a bet Miss Quinn Oh never gamble Not on dogs cards or strangers You were right Was Why do you want to steal from the company Who said did Hypothetically War and plunder the two most reliable sources of income didnt realize we were at war In six months time shall retire to a hearty pat on the back and a not to hearty pension a situation in dire need of attention So money plain and simple Suppose wanted to do something for my wife Your wife who died years ago The one youre happily married to Lovely You did your homework guess you would What else did you uncover That youre far from stupid and you were forced to apprentice under your father the one with the drinking problem Oh yes married at and years later when your wife became ill you took the night job at London Diamonds so you could spend your days by her side You never did use those qualifications Clever Miss Quinn Clever How do you know wont turn you in Are we still speaking hypothetically mean what makes you think you can pull off such a thing Well simply because have a plan What propose involves the least possible risk because we dont have to change our normal routines Each night at they lock the front doors which means that for hours no one can go in or out of the building They increase the security on the main floor but on the lower floor they just keep these two guards here and here by the lift which is the sole point of access You intend to go for the vault Thats where the diamonds are You cant be serious Generally each evening start on the fourth floor and work me way down see Nice day today Once through the outer floors m escorted to the sub basement The next few hours are spent on rubbish collection mopping waxing minor repair and maintenance During that time ll work mostly unattended Once an hour or so someone checks up on me Otherwise m left entirely to myself mean in theory could take off all my clothes and walk around naked frightening thought Miss Quinn Dont dwell on it ll try not to ve saved the vault hallway for last The long corridor that leads to a circular door behind which lies one of the largest singular deposits of riches on earth For years ve been working within a hares breath of that door and for years ve never opened it not once You couldnt if you wanted to not without the codes The codes are changed weekly and entrusted to only two people Mr Eaton lifelong company servant portrait of reliability Rumor has it that the swiss use his pulse to set their clocks by And of course Sir Milton Kendrick Ashtoncroft aging ruler of everything that daylight touches And you plan to obtain the codes how Thats where you come in Miss Quinn Until recently this was supposed to be a solo operation year ago quite by accident discovered that Sir Milton kept the codes concealed in his desk Then some months back they were gone Night after night searched the office but they never turned up Whyd you wait Why not do it while you had the chance Oh ve asked myself that question a thousand times told you m m not courageous But my hesitating will be your gain Will it And what will that require Here proof of conviction You are on the uh guest list are you Its business m expected Were entertaining the Russians You suspect he keeps the codes at home On Saturday go to his study and look under the center drawer in his desk This is ridiculous Say did find the codes and you were able to slip in and out of the vault undetected How would you get the diamonds out of the building How much will it hold How much would you like it to hold Whats the price of revenge Difficult eh Would a million pound do Each should think so They wouldnt even notice that much Well by then ll be retired and youll have been let go Why should trust you The same reason have to trust you We have the same objective Oh you make it all sound so easy Is that a yes No it isnt Be sure to wear something nice Good evening sir Come on in The Russians here To pressurized carbon Here here Now thats a sight worth seeing Sir Clifton Sinclair our very own insurance man making a rare trip down from his ivory tower at Kings Row No doubt losing sleep over our somewhat top heavy inventory Oh dont think Sinclairs the type to lose sleep Its rather unnerving to consider a man with that history as London diamonds greatest guarantor Ooh you didnt know He was mixed up in all those insurance scandals before the national health service Of course hes completely innocent or he was never prosecuted Otherwise we wouldnt do business together Allow me to present Vladimir Dmitriev head of the Soviet Diamond Authority Mr Chanson my second in command How do you do And miss Laura Quinn one of our brightest gems Ballet vodka diamonds the three things closest to the Russian soul And which do you prefer Diamonds of course ll drink to that My lord And what would you have done had said ballet would ask you to dance Of course have ulterior motives And um what makes you think dont shall miss her Hows the old man bearing up Oh expect hell outlive us all Well only ask because should think hoarding basically a worthless commodity would be very bad for his heart What am doing ask myself that repeatedly Sorry didnt see you Purely by design Youve stumbled into my lair my sanctuary of sorts Yes think know what you mean At least the evening is a success Your fathers spared no expense Never does always first class so long as its discreet and doesnt attract attention Yes hes famous for his discretion Is it true he paid pounds to the families of the miners who died in protest Anonymously Pulled the bullets from the caskets Should be a discount for that What sort of man does such a thing man of conscience Miss Quinn Mr Hobbs m having trouble with the heat in my office Uh Miss Quinn do you want more or less heat in your office If we do this want to know every last detail Understand Ok Man Now if you just lock it off under there We have to call it off Theyve installed security cameras Closed Circuit Television monitoring everything ve been with them all morning showing interest Cameras in the building Yes inside outside halls lobby In the vault No but the vault corridor They dont want security guards staring at mounds of diamonds all day Can you blame them Oh security cameras goodness gracious Whatll they think up next Is there any way around them No absolutely not No There are eight separate cameras covering the entire sub basement including one dedicated to the vault corridor The cameras link to the guard station and Eaton has a man on watch hours a day seven days a week Basements here Weve got reception boardroom the corridor So youll just have to reconsider that pension of yours All right So fool proof eh And you came all the way over to the wrong side of town to tell me when you couldve told me tonight Youve seen a way havent you have not Mr Hobbs Your tenacity reminds me of my wife Why are you being so persistent Because hate English winters Now tell me how it can be done All right Theres one possibility but m telling you it wont work Although there are eight cameras in the sub basement only four images are on screen at any one time Four on four off and since the images cycle in second intervals they reappear in the order they leave So each image is offscreen for Yeah seconds but thats not enough time Enough time ll be in that vault in seconds flat You cant be standing outside the vault when the image goes off screen and be nowhere in sight when it reappears You have to start at the end of the corridor and thats yards long Well dont have a problem with that With all due respect Mr Hobbs you can hardly walk let alone run m telling you can do it This has gone too far m sorry Youre involved now whether you like it or not beg your pardon You gave me the code Miss Quinn so youre involved Make no mistake m going through with this And dont you pretend to me that you dont want it because you want it more than do You want a life that means something that adds up And you know that this is the only way youre going to get it Miss Quinn you said it yourself Theyre never going to notice it This is how itll work Tomorrow well synchronize our watches but it has to be tomorrow before they realize the flaw in the system At the exact moment youre at the vault corridor ll call the guard station That should buy you at least more seconds When this is over think best we not speak again Evening Miss Quinn Evening Henry Evening Henry Albert Evening Miss Quinn May Whats the word Henry Ask me again on Friday Good night sir Good night Ah Ah Damn it Willis Hello Man Halt m afraid theres a problem If you wont mind come along with me Uh Mr Lewis m afraid God knows what that man ingests Would you mind ll uh leave you to it Mr Hobbs Morning Miss Quinn How are things this morning Henry In a word dull Isnt there a sight next week Fifth Monday Thats very odd The sorties have gone home Man Is he here yet is he here yet No sir Mr Jameson what happened What is so important Man Miss Quinn Miss Quinn you in there need not remind you were all bound to the strictest confidentiality Under no circumstances are we to discuss the incident Any acts to the contrary will result in the severest consequences Is that clear Yes of course The elevators the single point of entry no underground tunnels three narrow ventilation ducts all of which lead nowhere The entire sub basement is encased in concrete marble and the outer casing is solid steel This has to be the most secure facility in all of Europe Thats certainly what we believed Besides there was nearly two tons of diamonds You would need an army of men and several vehicles Now you all know Sir Clifton Sinclair from Kings Row our underwriters Well weve talked it through and we have agreed that our utmost priority must be the appearance of business as usual mean any police investigation and subsequent publicity would be a disaster Just like that all confidence gone So we handle the matter privately Sinclair As you all know Kings Row has been behind London Diamond for the last years And today is no exception With that in mind d like to introduce you to Sir Gavin Finch our Chief Insurance Investigator Mr Finch Good morning everyone Please there is no need to panic We will find your diamonds No need to panic The royal supply of diamonds has vanished into thin air and theres no need to panic will see inside the vault now and if the night staff could be called back thank you What have you done Its all in hand Miss Quinn In hand In hand The contents of a thermos you said When youre finished meet me at the caf at the corner of Hatton Ground Mr Hobbs Yes This way please Not one of your better ideas Miss Quinn suggest we cut this short What have you done with the diamonds want answers and want them now Youre gonna get them all in good time Oh cant breathe insist that you remain calm What did you say to Finch told him went on shift as normal waxed the floors for a while emptied the rubbish a normal night lied want you to go back to work do exactly what we discussed keep to your routine and well talk again Ok This is where ll be tomorrow Miss Quinn Sir Miltons office is asking for you urgently Should you elect to purchase the goods you must notify me by weeks end Its my understanding that specifics as to the inventory and to the purchase terms are explicitly set forth in this letter And importantly m not to be made privy to any arrangement between my client and yourself You are simply to alert me to your intentions at which point will provide instructions regarding method of payment My client will then convey where you may take possession of the goods Mr Boyle are we to understand the identity of your client is unknown to you Thats correct As is the nature of this inventory Also correct Excuse me but theres a call for Mr Boyle from his office What in the name of God is all this Now available a selection of uncut diamonds market price million pounds sterling Is that it Is that all it says Payable within hours Weve been hijacked by madmen Shouldnt this man be detained m afraid Mr Boyle has told us all he knows Pardon the interruption Is there anything further will await your call Good day The South African Star Get Sinclair back Now Ah Miss Quinn may m working my way through personnel Yes please Thank you Take a seat Would you care for a cigarette No thank you Thank you Now Miss Quinn youre American but you were educated at Oxford You have been working here for years and you are now a Senior Negotiator Thats right Would you say you have done well for yourself Yes Not married No And you are Thats right Mr Finch certainly hope thats not a crime Do you have any leads Ahem Now in your professional capacity Miss Quinn who would you say were London Diamonds enemies Its potentially a long list We are a major global business Why do you think there could be more to this than money The diamond that Mr Boyle has left the Kimberly cut diamond in the world If it were motivated by money its unlikely it would still be in our possession Are you saying its symbolic Its also known as the South African Star Thank you Miss Quinn Thatll be all for now Oh uh that Mr Hobbs youre on good terms with him suppose so Hes one of the night janitors Always seems quite jovial You were speaking to him today in the corridor Yes ve been having problems with my radiator asked him if he could come and look at it Its erratic Temperaturewise And did he manage to solve the problem believe he was going to try and find some time this week Good Thank you again Miss Quinn Thank you gentlemen for the instruction ll get back to you in hours Thank you Good morning Miss Quinn good morning You seem bright and breezy this morning d like to be given authority to liaise with Mr Finch on the investigation Why With the time pressure were under we all need to be communicating as efficiently as were able And and Finch was hired by Sinclair Well dont see why not Theres a whole explosion of nothing downstairs see the Kings Row lawyers are back Surely theyre not prepared to pay the ransom on our behalf Not if Sinclair has anything to do with it Hes already lobbied the other members of the syndicate against settling the claims Saying the uh the deadlines are unreasonable But then of course he would wouldnt he Hes the majority shareholder His life would return to zero where he started Theyre not bound by contract Miss Quinn as m sure youre aware where large personal fortunes are concerned contracts have a habit of developing loopholes And if that happened then were insolvent No diamonds No sight The world knows All hell breaks loose Youll speak to Mr Finch Tell him that ll be assisting Its our official company position Well you seem terribly keen Well my job is at stake All of ours are All right ll speak to him right now This has just come through Mr Finch Miss Quinn Mr Jameson may have spoken to you uh m to assist you in any way can with the investigation Yes he told me m going down to the vault now Oh these monitors The new security system Well actually not very secure Every seconds each corridor is left totally unobserved for one full minute Well one minute thats not very much time Time enough to pass undetected The lift is the single point of entry But the diamonds were not removed by way of the lift Each activation is recorded prompting an electronic time stamp As usual there were three trips that night In each instance the lift returned at once to the main level So the lift was never stationary long enough in the sub basement to load the contents of the vault Thats right You may need these Excuse me Steel three inches thick floor ceiling walls But to get the diamonds out they must have penetrated it somewhere No forced entry They knew the combination So all things considered Mr Finch what conclusions have you arrived at Isnt it obvious what conclusions ve arrived at Miss Quinn woman of your intelligence must surely have guessed were expected upstairs stop gap to restore diamond inventories to an acceptable level Five million pounds That is what youve come up with eh Financing the stones is impossible You control all the major trading centers across the planet When the first diamond turns up within hours youll get the rest Sinclair we are the sole supplier of diamonds to six continents Any hint we can no longer supply would be catastrophic Money is no substitute for diamonds Miss Quinn is here with Mr Finch sir Well paying the ransom wont guarantee your diamonds back and will make it more difficult to apprehend those responsible That is your problem not mine Now Mr Finch believe Mr Finch has got something to tell us which may alter all our perspectives am now in no doubt that the crime was perpetrated by either one or a number of London Diamond employees believe also that the perpetrator obtained the codes to the vault from Sir Miltons residence most likely on the evening of last Saturday during a party team has been sent over to the house to dust for prints Mr Finch you said that you deemed the motive for the robbery to be political Were it a crime for profit a single handful of diamonds would do Now Mr Finch in your opinion who are the most likely political factions The Soviets and the South African rebels would top the list And are there any members of personnel in London Diamond who might be associated with uh these political factions Well there was one name that came to the surface Ahem Oliver Ashtoncroft age whilst attending a Marxist Leninist rally But this is ridiculous That was nearly two decades ago Just because dont advocate everything that goes on at this company does not make me a communist or a thief That is enough You really have sunk to the dregs this time eh Well m sorry but unless we can remove even the slightest hint of fraud Kings Row will not even consider full settlement Sinclair as the syndicates largest underwriter you stand to lose a great deal of your ill gotten fortune Or do overstate Ill gotten Well now that is rich coming from a de facto dictator of an entire slave nation For years we have paid you inordinate sums of money for your security We have done so in the hope that one day we may receive something in return Well that day has come Sinclair and what eh Nothing will crush you Sinclair will take everything you have And then will piss on your fucking grave Howd you do it Mr Hobbs Howd you get them out Do you know what the hardest substance in the world is And whos really behind this The diamond You rub it with a cloth it lets off a charge You put it in water it comes up dry Its only enemy is another diamond You do know youve rendered the stones worthless All of them They cant be sold London Diamonds the only buyer on earth Precisely And to that end we have demanded a ransom We No there is no we They wont pay They couldnt if they wanted Theres no money And that investigator finch he saw us talking He will find out have absolutely no doubt Have you ever thought about your plans like No mean when you get your share what you gonna do with your life mean are you gonna be a giver or a taker Why you stupid old man Wake up Dont you understand That the only life for us is one behind bars Ok look can negotiate our way out of this ll go to Ashtoncroft Offer him the diamonds in exchange for our freedom and our silence Hell hell accept the deal His terror of publicity will see to it All you have to do is tell me where the diamonds are m m sorry Miss Quinn d like to help but do not intend to negotiate Well then have no option but to turn myself in Oh really Is that what youre gonna do eh After all these years clawing your way up laughing at mens jokes subservient neglecting your opportunities giving up on love no time for the simple the decent Doing all the dirty work youre really going to throw all that away just to spite me require the money in full And yes they can pay it It is precisely what they are insured for As you wish Then shall find the diamonds myself Oh is that a fact Oh it certainly is shall find the diamonds Make no mistake about it Is this a bad time No no not at all Its just a formality you understand And we have requested the same from all employees who were present a Sir Miltons party set of fingerprints Of course May Theres really nothing to worry about Its simply to rule you out conclusively from our investigations Sorry its quite warm in here Isnt it Now if youll allow me Are you really considering Ollie to be your prime suspect What Mmm Wouldnt you say he had the greatest facility to obtain the codes But does he have the courage The requisite spine of ambition Its hard to imagine anyone capable of so audacious a crime Audacious or just ambitious Ambition is something you understand Miss Quinn No longer married Mr Finch No m not She tire of all your investigating Yes she did m sorry Here Thank you Oh and just one last thing Miss Quinn need your assistance downstairs Could you Its just a matter of a few minutes Certainly Now want you to tell me in your opinion Miss Quinn if this man is lying Mr Hobbs believe you know Miss Quinn Uh third floor second office from the lift yes Shes been kind enough to act as my second set of ears Uh are we still discussing Tuesday night sir would like to revisit the period in the sub basement from am Three hours The bulk of which is unaccounted for The nature of my job sir is somewhat solitary Now you stated earlier these hours were spent waxing and polishing floors Yeah mostly Yeah Thats a great deal of time devoted to polishing floors Oh marble is very particular sir It requires a certain type of polish and a lot of time to set At what time did you tend to the vault corridor At the very end Between and Yes Why then Why wait until the end Oh its its a cherished task Its akin to tending the palace throne imagine always save the best till last Hmm Any hobbies Mr Hobbs leisure time activities Yes read a good book now and then Anything in particular Graham Greene uh Wells sometimes Emily Dickinson Nothing more radical No Soviet literature in your collection Mr Hobbs Oh tried War and Peace but couldnt finish it You frequent Greyhound races You like to watch dogs run around in circles And also wash my smalls on Thursdays if youre interested Now see your wife died some years back of cancer Her name was Margaret Thats right It must have been excruciating for you Sitting by watching her wither away Taken in the very prime of life Mr Finch you sound like a man whos lost something Perhaps if you were to tell me what it was could help you locate it Mr Finch Yes We have something that may be of interest Excuse me Mr Finch Come on Thatll be all for now Mr Hobbs will see you later Miss Quinn In Ashtoncrofts study used a handkerchief but in the heat of the moment may have left a fingerprint know why you did this know its not about the money Nothing important ever is understand you have political convictions but you have to know Kings Row is trying every tactic not to pay And have a feeling theyre going to succeed Our only way out of this is to negotiate Theyll never find the diamonds then Youll get nothing Absolutely nothing just a lifetime in jail Is this cause of yours worth it mean would the cause do the same for you This time tomorrow morning this will all be over Whats that old phrase about two wrongs a right do not make Thats nonsense Sometimes to make something right you have to do something just as wrong Oh get oh yes my cause Its worth a lifetimes in jail for me Miss Quinn Some day you will understand Maybe it will inspire you to look beyond these marble walls Theres a remarkable world out there Oh and if its any consolation never really intended to involve you Get the forensic department to verify it Yes sir How about the dog track Anything Yes um this one here m pretty certain thats him sir the janitor Christ Hobbs How did you do it m telling you We have no more time Taking on Ashtoncroft when his back is to the wall will lead to a blood bath Someones going to be ruined And what about finch He says he has some leads dont think we can rely on him We dont have any choice Make sure that he comes up with something and quickly What the hell do you think have been doing Contact the syndicate members All of them Convene a meeting tonight And tell them what Tell them tell them Tell them if they do not come here with their wallets open to pay me everything they owe me will dedicate my remaining years on this earth to ruining every last one of them Tell them that Word for word Woman London Evening News Put me through to the news desk please was looking for you need some air Will you have a drink with me You know youre quite someone Miss Quinn true maverick Why was it again no one married you My mother said beating the boys wont make you popular or happy It turns out she was right Were the same you and outsiders loners We could almost be brilliant But what would we achieve with all the hours we put in Absolutely nothing Man Anything else sir Come in Sir the press are outside The press What do they want m not sure sir ll speak to them Ladies and gentlemen please Mr Milton Ashtoncroft is not available at the moment So Miss Quinn are you going to tell me how you did it Remove million pounds of diamonds past cameras walls of steel and security guards and sealed doorways For the life of me cant unravel it wish could help you but m really not that clever Maybe you struck a deal with the Russians Who knows You could look after their new cartel once Lon Di hits the scrap heap Do appear so diabolical Weve seen a photo of you at the racetrack with Mr Hobbs You must be mistaken never gamble We also found some fingerprints at the Ashtoncroft Mansion By midnight we shall have conclusive results Oh and um did you know my fee is five percent of recovered goods understand what youre doing Mr Finch Youre testing me measuring my reactions my stimulus responses But the truth is you havent arrested me because you have no evidence Because ve committed no crime Perhaps havent arrested you because m waiting for you to reveal whos really behind all this Sir theres been an incident News of the robbery has leaked to the press Mr Ashtoncroft has had a heart attack Is is he all right m afraid not madame The board are reconvening back at the office hope you have no intentions of leaving town Miss Quinn Shit Ohh Arent you a picture Clever girl eh Filthy but clever Ashtoncrofts dead or was that all a part of your plan Mr Hobbs m going back and telling them everything m afraid cant let you go Miss Quinn You see the deadline for the ransoms in about an hour and m guarding the entrance to Aladdins Cave in case someones smart enough to figure it out Look at you Youre quite an asset to the company Arent you Miss Quinn Theyre not going to pay and youre insane to think they would Oh they will m sure of that Ever think what youre going to do when all of this is over Ugh Ugh You know you remind me so much of my wife Once she got her teeth into something Did ever tell you how she died Cancer But first they said that not only was her cancer operable but it had been caught early and she had an excellent chance But you see we paid what little money we had into a private hospital policy But then the insurance company told her that she had to wait her turn for a stay in hospital So we pleaded our case all the way up to the Chairman of the company But he said it wasnt an emergency So you know but by the time she was admitted to the hospital well it it was she was too far gone then Its Sinclair Yeah At that time Clifton Sinclair was the biggest seller of private hospital policies to the British underprivileged And he used that money to establish himself as London Diamonds largest insurance underwriter Individual participants in Kings Row syndicates are liable to the full extent of their private wealth What is the meaning of this What the hell are you doing here Weve been discussing the situation What situation The impossible situation that you got us all into What are you talking about In case you didnt know we own percent of the London Evening News believe you spoke with them earlier Yes Going to the press means you dont have to come up with a quick settlement The scandalous news your time is bought that was the plan wasnt it Mr Ashtoncroft has however agreed to dismiss all charges pending an immediate settlement of the claim which have just authorized You have what Kings Row signifies one thing Reliability Now just our business was built on it Our reputation demands it You will never ever get the money back Its for a ransom for Christs sake Are you telling me you waited years for the absolute right moment All this to punish one man Patience they say is a virtue He took from me the one thing in this world that truly loved Mr Hobbs you have so much valor No Didnt we How did you solve it My clumsiness and your background Come on come on Here it is sir Thank you This is the telex from the bank confirming that the deposit has been made corresponding to the exact amount as requested by your client Everything

being returned Good day The South African Star so it wasnt a message Shh shh More complicated Would you mind ll uh leave you to it Man My client will then convey where you may take possession of the goods Excuse me but theres a call for Mr Boyle from his office Yes Has there been a delivery May give you some advice Miss Quinn Well you are the one holding the gun Life is for living Its there for

Miss Quinn Mr Finch Congratulations The idea came when you were dropping your earring in the sink is it right Sorry lost you your finders fee We didnt find prints on Sir Miltons safe We found them on the opera glasses in his office They werent conclusive Mr Finch Whatever it is you have to say Miss Quinn now is not the right time to say it Maybe there will never be a right time As strange as it
