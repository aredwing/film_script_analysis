as evidence for the final verdict and as an indispensable expert psychiatric report for information and advice of this case to determine the time of the research of Madam von Ribecks disease or other disabilities show that the issues detract too much from her duties as a doctor to perform properly The psychiatrist is the SaintJean de Dieu hospital in Brussels and on behalf of its disciplinary tribunal report published on July The psychiatrist seriously doubts that Madam von Ribeck will be able to properly fulfill her duties as a doctor in the future The psychiatrist found that Madam von Ribeck not at all understands what shes done After the examination the psychiatrist says also that Mrs Von Ribeck shows no insight and suffers from an underdeveloped conscience This means that Madam von Ribeck insufficiently expressed regret about the acts she has committed during the period in question In this case empathy for the accused persons position isnt justified and the need for health allows no risk to run The verdict of the central medical disciplinary tribunal to remove Charlotte Gudrun von Ribeck from the medical register should therefore be executed The time will be about one week One week Yes You sure Are you sure this will done by Friday m pretty damn sure Yeah will check Five meters Yes Let me do it maam ll do it No no Ms Shanti thank you can finish it by tomorrow Yes
