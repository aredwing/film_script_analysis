This is the comeback story of all time Our guest has the number movie out Your album is coming out next week youve won an Oscar a grammy a Tony an Emmy Youre getting Nobel Peace Prize for the work youve done in Middle East Your charity saved the whales and trees while feeding the children Its changing the world as we know it guess life is good It hasnt always been that way has it dont hold it against you to bring it up let me start with that Its my job was a man that seemed to have everything And yet had nothing What changed You wouldnt believe it Try me Alright Rockbottom Thats where was had nowhere to go Like naked women be With baseball bats just for kicks It wasnt until wrote away to this little advice column in the newspaper wrote to a man named Mr Know It All And his advice guided me and helped me To find my way to find my way to a better place It actually brought me to where am now Who is Mr Know It All Hes an enigma Maybe we should have him on the show There are people that live fun exciting lives And then there are people like me Its not because im boring Well am boring Ut dont need excitement in my life think its overrated just see life like it is People ask me is the cup half full or is it half empty just say hey be happy you got a cup Have always been like this think theres a point in every kids life Where they hear and see something and they go what the Things are going great life is great and then For my friend Patti it was my th birthday party But that bubble bursting moment is different for everyone Goldie has been sleeping for a really long time For me it was when heard the story of the Monkey Paw mean you guys know that story right Guy goes into a pawn shop tries to buy an evil Monkey Paw Why would anyone want this ugly thing Its great to honor three wishes ll take it But the owner wont sell Says its too evil the guy steals it and brings it home for his wife The wife is thrilled to get three wishes Even though the guy warns her that the Monkey Paw is evil The wife wishes for Suddenly the telephone rings and theyre informed that their son is dead Mangled to bit in some construction accident But the good news is they get from the company The wife is totally distraught and wishes that the son was alive again Suddenly they hear a tapping noise coming from the front door But the husband realizes that if the son was alive again He would be this mangled tormented mess Oh my dear God So the husband used the third wish to wish that his son was dead again So in the end all they get is and a dead son And the moral of the story is Is Be careful what you wish for What the What kind of children bedtime story is that freaked out started to remember stuff wished for wish didnt have to go to piano lesson That day there was a fire in my dads dry cleaning business And since my dad didnt have insurance it wiped us out financially So hey no more piano lesson And the time wished for a puppy Thats enough Well my dad left us to live with his new girlfriend But the condo they were living in wouldnt take her dog My dads girlfriends used puppy Thats my girl Crap It all made sense now after the monkey paw my bubble bursts Careful what you wish for is my mantra Make a wish sweety dont waste my time with hopes or wishes deal in facts Arent you gonna make a wish Mostly useless But over the years that useless knowledge has come in handy for my day job My not forever job As write books Actually write book But plan on writing the second one once my first one is published But for now write a newspaper column Ask Mr Know It All How many hairs on a human head Well that depends Is it a blonde a brunette or a red head Over all am happy to have things just the way they are No changes no surprises Hi Sal Its Patti Girl we are famous What
