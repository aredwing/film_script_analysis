Our true land The original inhabitants Of course Unlike us Uprooted half and halfs imported intellectuals Actually we cannot decide what comes first People or theatre Is the party festoon Yelling people people all the time The theatre workers want to concentrate on theatre Bhoba not meetings rallies and politics Why are they herded into regiments Here No Does anyone care about theater The lights the sets the acting Tea You cannot stage plays without a revolving stage Not enough light rundown sets no theatre schooling the discipline is gone good play has to look good No It must speak the truth Youre being impatient Bhoba Even anarchy has a discipline You lack that Youre irregular When you do come youre busy with your truth Is that wrong Truth is relative Bhoba Todays truth may be tomorrows lie Think about the theatre Its the same for beauty Shibuda say it as we speak of theatre cant do theatre for the sake of it m in for peoples theatre But your mass plays your new fangled drivel m not game Hence the new play at Srirangom is selling so well and were a flop Let it sell m not here to entertain people Moron Be it true or beautiful do we have the ability to write a good play The same old hash Brecht Chekov Ibsen You too are stuck at Shakespeare Anando Try something original Thought of something new Bhoba Yes ve decided the name too Anguish Whats the theme Partition Refugees That same old documentary style of plays No Suicide What Why Why suicide Why not Head the papers those days Ripples of suicide in Calcutta was writing as the Bengal Correspondent Thirty one suicides in a city consecutively And the reason Do you have suicidal ideation Oh no Wasnt satisfied by just the article so wrote an entire play It was turning into a good play Expressionist approach much like Strindberg Stop these depressing stuff the audience will reject it In the morning was warming some borrowed milk for the little one The rest the rest hadnt eaten since yesterday Suddenly Nutu my third one came and stood beside me He loves to eat you know But we have never afforded anything fancy He came before me said Ma want to eat wicked boy gave him one whack next thing know my Khuki screams Ma something is wrong with Nutu Something is wrong with Nutu Something is wrong with Nutu You are glorifying suicide You are behaving like the Police chief Are you the secret mole of the Police Censoring Whatever we write will be questioned Is this a free country That is how the British police censored Nil Darpan shows So whats new Bloody pimp Come on Start cried cried a lot Sat at my door and wailed And wailed Is there anyone Anyone out there who understands my tears Is there anyone Is there anyone Is there anyone whod understand those tears Bloody scoundrels all You understood Right Because l was a peoples artist that was my job The rest were just the choicest bastards plain mediocre or s agents Think about it and tell me About what Why did those news of suicides move you so much Because they were just the symptoms wanted to get to the root cause Like you Hmm That was Poverty what else was only recording the great changes But the why did your Party oppose you Why could you not finish your Gorky play Why You left Why Theres no one with you today No friends no one Why Because some looked for name fame bank balance Some got depressed and looked away and some went down fighting Hence But was smelling the gunfire on the streets We have no language no homeland All thrown out of their own country We have no destination no homeland Grabbing our land now There is no good There is no evil No kith nor kin Who says to slay is sinning When this world is a giant Carnival of killing Killing in the woods Killing in the huts Killing in bird nests Killing in worm burrows Killing in vast oceans Killing in azure skies Killing to survive Killing for play Killing for no reason Killing unintended What are you thinking Many things lam unable to tie up the ends Theatre or films Within the party or outside being unable to settle down anywhere You are being chased by your flight of thoughts They never let you be and thats what fear demonic criminality strange madness What kind of madness Have you read about the Greek legend of Sisyphus King Sisyphus was punished by the Gods to bear stones all his life So that his enormous strength may slowly ebb Because that was what he needed His strength made those around him weak You must chastise yourself You must control yourself Bhoba You must simmer down your smoulder Or else all will be scorched around you Whats happened The Plays a hit But Bhoba all your broad big exaggerated gestures keep coming back Its all like only your body is acting false But that is what the audience is lapping up Maybe because in this play Raghupati needs to be played with a superficial touch What are you thinking Thinking How have begged borrowed and stolen for a few shows It is so pointless How many people have seen them How much can you tell with so little Have you seen De Sicas Bicycle Thieves Animesh explain it to Bhoba Listen Because you do it yourself you dont feel the pressure for profits Had a producer been breathing down your necks Correct But Cinema know How long have you been around Huh Think about the sheer numbers Theatre provokes an immediate reaction but that is inadequate And why are we looking at films as money making machines am fed up of my job as a medical representative There is a reason why am tense Eisenstein Pudovkin had access to government funds at a point of time The rest like Chaplin De Sica had a problem with funds Take my example How much do earn as an editor We can all pitch in we are the producers Brilliant As in Is this a joke Bikram da l have not fallen in love with films It is just a weapon for me And tomorrow if you get a sharper sword Will kick aside movies and go forward Have you thought Bhoba what you will work upon know him had seen him Still stands the huge city its sky scrapped by a jungle of black wires had seen him under that sky In a crowd of thousands of city dwellers another city dweller How long will your work deal with migrants and refugees As long as can Because dont believe in these very terms Stop labeling people But no one saw all that But that does not prove there is no hardship and sorrow in the world And what about us Youve begged and borrowed to make the film But you couldnt release it There are others making movies too Theyre being shown around the world getting acknowledgments And you going around like a Vagabond There is no money in the house Money wont remain Dugga But my work will Youll see Your wife has a complaint you are very whimsical Which do you prefer Doctor a slushy pond or a gushing mountain stream wouldnt have been able to to lead the life of a school teacher Therefore from poetry to prose to theatre to films had a lot to say This is not me This is Maxim Gorky Dinonath has just translated it why will we have to justify this Nobody wants to believe you Bhoba Maybe not today but tomorrow You all are there the party is there Where is the party The party has dropped you Bhoba What They say you Mohit and Anando You are TrotskyteAnarchists Bastards Theyve also been wary about my relationship with Nilkantha But Aslam and have already sent our justification about the cultural front What happened to that Thats also missing What That is the problem There is a oneman commission on our new play Comrade Basu had written a letter protesting on our behalf but that too is missing Perfect So we then cannot remain in group theatre anymore Even if am not here peoples theatre will remain in me Feeling very tired Doctor am off to bed You are one stubborn man You must take your medicines regularly Might make you drowsy May come in Need to talk About what It is a new dawn in Asia These are a few sunrays Again at your nonsense Without booze Or d abuse too Please leave We have work Work Jobless
