Colombian drug lord Raoul Ochoa is bankrolling it His plan is to put in rebel General Miguel Alvarez in power We have less than one week to prevent that With his man Alvarez running the country Ochoa could very easily gain access to the Panama Canal We have only one shot at Alvarez and it is absolutely critical that we eliminate the general prior to next weeks election Now this operation wont bear congressional scrutiny lt must be completely covert You wont be getting a medal for this But there will be other tangible benefits First ones Alvarez Most recent photo was taken ten days ago The ponytails Ochoa Ochoas never seen outside of Colombia Thats Alvarezs hacienda Thats where youll find him Thats your shooter Thats Master Gunnery Sargent Thomas Beckett Hes the Marine Corps top man Hes logged more time in the jungle than any other sniper On this particular mission your function is to be his spotter Mr Miller should anything happen to Beckett your duty would be to eliminate Alvarez Personally Dont worry about having to shoot him Beckett is the best and lm sure it wouldnt come to that l may not have any kills but have had men in my sights Good Were giving you rank on this one The mission is under your command lts your responsibility Good luck Consider it done Gentlemen One last thing This assignment is critical lf at any point Beckett becomes a liability or he endangers this

rebel leadership Youre sending it my way sir Yes l am Were getting a little long in the tooth for this kind of thing Tom But l figured that this would make a great capper for a fine career The

a whole offensive on what they take off you lm ready for a game now He doesnt have time for a game Miller lot of attitude around here Welcome to Marine World Those people thought you were a sniper lts an outcast profession They always go out in platoon strength We go out in pairs sometimes alone Their idea of combat is tearing up the countryside with heavy artillery and millions of rounds Well wait days for one shot one kill Well l guess its a different version of war Theres a lot of them and just a few of us Whats that Sometimes these shells get nicks and burs on them This little son of a bitch will take your head of at yards Have you had a chance to look over our operations plan Yeah l have but l wanna study it a little more All right Forget the specifics How about an overview Well get to that later l have a few things l have to do See you at Having had Having had what Breakfast This is Corporal Papichs gillie suit ls that our ride No Thats our ride l thought this was a deep jungle

thing myths are made of Yeah it was pretty unreal Yeah Roll down your sleeves Miller Were going in the bush What What l miss a spot Come on On your feet l had a lot of training all right Urban antiterrorist tactics lve never actually done a creep The army ever put you in the jungle If you call deepest darkest North Carolina a jungle yeah You wanna survive this right You want an answer to

the First it indicated a chopper insertion which we wont get into But then we were supposed to head east you know Due east You think Washington knows the best way to get through this jungle You think they know which streams are flooded which trails are boobytrapped What l know about this place son is because lm here Changing directions Good North Holy shit What the hell is that Hotel Europa What

Our mission isnt about assassinating people for lndians El Cirujanos listed as a target of opportunity That means we see him we take him out Listed where lts not in my orders man El Cirujanos gonna be at this river up ahead and Miller Youre the designated hitter on this So batter up Hold on a second now lm not buying into this And l dont buy that you shot a man from a moving helicopter Its got nothing to do with anything Youre gonna look Cirujano in the eyes and put a bullet through his heart because until l see you kill a man youre a liability to this mission Thats not my purpose here Maybe but when we get to Alvarezs hacienda theres gonna be two targets Now what Thats right lntelligence changes all the time Alvarez is setting up a meeting with a man called Raoul Ochoa Hes a Colombian drug lord thats financing the rebels We got a chance to get them both Where does this information come from Any new intelligence has to come through me local contact Father Ruiz Hes a priest

well You put them in the back of your mind and you just keep on going Until they decide not to stay in the back of your mind You may find this hard to believe but ld take a nice office on the Hill

danger Were about yards out This is our rendezvous point lf l dont show you cross country to the nearest river follow it downstream to the coast Whatever Hacienda The most logical position would be to take our shots from that tree line over there But theyre going to be expecting that So somehow we gotta get in the clear to make our shots When Ochoa arrives l figure we got ten seconds after they greet and then we drop them Then we gotta fire our shots simultaneously or theyre gonna vector in on our positions Heres Ochoa Hes yours Theres a clear shot from that metal utility shed You got
