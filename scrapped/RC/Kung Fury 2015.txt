were chasing down a mysterious Kung Fumaster Youre under arrest punk Show us your hands Good work Dragon That crazy stunt couldve killed us both But goddammit youre the best partner ve ever had Thanks learned from the best Youre like a father to me With one fatal blow he hit my partner could tell he was dead straight off Before could pull the trigger was hit by lightning and bitten by a cobra blacked out And saw images of ancient Shaolin temples and monks mastering the art of Kung Fu There was an ancient prophecy about a new form of Kung Fu so powerful only one man could master it The chosen one When woke up saw the Kung Fu master running towards me could feel my body mutate into some sort of Kung Fu freak of nature You You are the chosen one Knock knock Whos there Knuckles As a memento put on a strip of cloth from the dead Kung Fu master decided would use my new super Kung Fu powers to fight crime So became the best cop in the world became Kung Fury dont wanna hear it Kung Fury just got back from city hall million worth of damages and got the mayor up my ass like a fag on Viagra How am going to explain this to the press hm You just destroyed an entire city block for Christs sake Didnt you tell me to block it out told you do it by the book Cut the bullshit Nobody else could have stopped that arcade machine and you know it Oh man listen to me Kung Fury You need to

call But thats impossible Not for me it isnt Hackerman hes the most powerful hacker of all time Follow me was able to triangulate the cell phone signal and trace the caller His name is Adolf Hitler Hitler hes the worst criminal of all time Do you know him sir guess you could say that In the s Hitler was a Kung Fu champion He was so good at Kung Fu that he decided to change his name to Kung Fhrer But he didnt stop there He knew of the Kung Fury prophecy and wanted to claim the throne He and his posse of Nazi soldiers conducted experiments for years But they werent able to figure out how to master the art of Kung Fury And one day he disappeared from the face of the earth And noone has seen him ever since Until now guess he figured if he could find and kill the chosen one he would become Kung Fury himself He must have traveled in time in order to get here thats probably why he disappeared So whatre you gonna do My job m gonna go back in time to Nazi Germany and kill Hitler once and for all So how are you gonna do that m not sure need some sort of time machine Wait a minute using an modulator might be able to conduct a mainframe cell direct and hack the uplink to the download
