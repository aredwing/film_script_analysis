Once upon a time not so long ago Ah This is the story of me Jack There am absolutely shitting it d been carrying a carving knife with me for three weeks due to an irrational fear of being murdered couldnt sleep at night As soon as got into bed started seeing killers These killers were the subject of a series of plays had been writing for television The nature of the project necessitated research into heinous Victorian criminals And had unwittingly familiarized myself with all the famous hackers dosers and severers of the th century Faces that wouldve frightened the Ripper Many a long night spent there drenched in thoughts of bloody murder became particularly disturbed by a man called The Hendon Ogre maniac from North London who had boiled the arsenic out of fly papers and introduced the result into his lodgers broth d lie awake for hours thinking of the brute terrified someone was slipping arsenic into my diet In the mornings d inspect grapefruit and milk bottle tops looking for evidence of interference with syringes Trivial events became vital clues in the detection of my assassin If the telephone rang at half past four d look at the clock and say it was half past four when the telephone rang that fateful evening How could anyone have known at the time how important that telephone call was to become My situation became unbearable suspected everyone and everything Innocent passersby Creeks in the corridor Bumps in the night got so bad started plugging my head shut But d soon have to get up and check for killers in the bathroom in the kitchen in the fridge or in the hallway where they kept a low profile crawling about in the shadows lurking behind creaky doors Ah Bloody windows bloody draughts Oh God come on Argh This fear that would be murdered all began sometime before At lunch to be exact The day saw my literary agent Newspaper Clair De Grunwald Thanks No problem Shed arranged to meet me at a respectable establishment in Soho You like newspaper Shall bring sir the wine list Yes Okay Pleasure The body was found in the East End of London but the Hanoi Handshake is the unmistakable calling card of a Vietnamese gang killing According

story you see about how they become killers How do they get there What fills them with need to victimize and kill Why choose mass murder Why not become a writer Well actually writers and serial killers are very similar Theyre practically brothers Hemingway says What do you need to become a writer An unhappy childhood Its the same thing with serial killers Whatever happened to the hedgehog What He had to cross the road and go into the woods but he was afraid Harold the Hedgehog Harold the Hedgehog Dear little chap Whatever happened to that story You never finished him He nearly finished

heard of this man Harvey Humphries of Humbolt Mews didnt like the sound of it The name seemed innocent enough but there was something that jarred It might be the Harvey Humphries Humbolt bit that was worrying me But had a friend Garry Gordon in Garrick Street And hed never caused me any problem No It was something stronger than just a repetition of the It was more a sensation of having heard Harvey Humphries in some unsavory context Harvey It was the Harvey Harvey was the middle name of Dr Hawley Harvey Crippen the Yank Whod spent all night in the basement of Hilldrop Crescent separating his wife Hed done her in lime Crippen had come from America Humphries was going to America within hours of completing his business with me Was Humphries related to Crippen Farfetched as it might seem to others it was not impossible Crippen was an American Yes And so was Humphries Surely it was more than a coincidence that a man going to America should be excited by a title like Decades of Death and have the middle name of one of the most famous killers of the lot No No no no Facts like that are beyond the realm of coincidence Hello Whos there Speak up cant hear you Oh no Clairs not here just

it was Clair and that she meant no malice After all she has no reason to wish me any harm She had no way of knowing a man related to a murderer Only a highly suspicious paranoid cynic Or someone like me with an eye for clues and patterns could possibly connect the dots Could see the truth staring him in the face That Harvey Humphries is in fact Hawley Harvey Crippens grandson No more questions

Just calm yourself Jack want you to take a deep breath Now inhale and exhale Thats right Fill your entire body Imagine every cell being rinsed clean with lifegiving oxygen Do you have any clues where the origin of this phobia lies ve had it all my life ve tried to get on top of it went to a washhouse when was at college but was just so terrified accidentally trapped my load in an An Yes An out of order machine was in there with about six months of unimaginably sensitive material The room gathered round engineers were called It was a nightmare No sympathize with you As unpleasant as the experience may have been it cannot have been traumatic enough to create such a phobia Its ruining my life Look can help you but you must be completely honest And you must trust me Close your eyes want you to take another deep breath and imagine you are sitting here with me now in my office having a consultation Think of my office like a space capsule From here we can go anywhere in the universe in space and time by the power of our mind To your childhood to your dreams Can you see the little hedgehog Frightened little hedgehog lives in an old hedgerow by the church Can you see the spider Clever spider Waiting in the shadows And Mrs Ladybird And Mr Rabbit How about old farmer Did you have a happy childhood What is your earliest memory The orphanage on fire Youre being facetious No m not really The orphanage was in caught fire November the th Somebody let off a Roman candle in the dormitory Luckily no one was hurt Youre an orphan m sorry didnt My mother abandoned me when was years old She just packed a little suitcase for me one day and disappeared How did it happen Jack Its all right to feel vulnerable These pyjamas arent helping Try Jack Try to go back The only memory have of my mother is of a book she gave me Fairy tales suppose you call them With these awful talking rodents Look truth is it doesnt bother me dont miss my mother because dont remember her just m sick of these irrational fears Like the bloody launderette Its stopping me from living my life Well you can do something about it Youre not a child anymore once treated a girl who had a phobia of bananas When this girl came to me she was so pleased with herself Shed been able to overcome her phobia to the extent that she could sit in the same room as a closed banana It had to stay closed unzipped or else shed go completely psychotic But the point is open or closed she had not made the connection between her phobia and her fear Of bananas No It was something else past trauma Something more threatening than a mere banana Do you understand Its like a movie screen She projected her fear onto the banana because looking directly at her trauma was too terrifying It was a projection Onto a piece of fruit Exactly Her bananas no different to your launderette also have a recurring nightmare about an eyeball What sort of eyeball The giant floating kind Sort of eye of death watching me All fears and neurosis can be traced back to our early childhood To the first terrifying recognition that we are alone in the world When a child is abandoned it has no concept of time No understanding that things can get better That there is hope For a child Jack mother equals life Take away the mother and the child is literally swallowed by death But didnt die did No You lived To experience your own death Thats some scary shit Dr Friedkin Its the primal trauma we are all trying to forget To bury in our subconscious But it inevitably finds expression either in dreams or fears or infantile fantasies Dad How much longer are you gonna be in there Just finishing up sweet pea m sorry Jack We have to end now dont know how to thank you Dr Friedkin Perhaps as a teenager you were subliminally drawn to that because somewhere deep in your subconscious you recognised that you too are out of order Broken You dont work anymore The primary defence mechanisms you relied on to get you through childhood no longer support you as an adult m sorry Youre fucked up Jack You need therapy havent got time ve got a meeting Return to the scene of the crime and retrieve those unwashed articles locked in the machine Release your raw true inner self Begin a new life free from fear Fear of death The irony is we must all journey through Hades before we can reach our heaven Dr Friedkin think its time faced my

comfortably Once upon a time not so long ago there was a hedgehog whose name was Brian Brian lived in a cave deep in the forest a dark and terrible place called the Wyrd Wild Wood After dark the forest would echo with howls and screams And sometimes it seemed to Brian as if even the moon conspired against him But the more afraid Brian became the angrier he got until one night frightened out of his wits he turned himself into a terrifying monster He put on weight painted his face and started insisting on being addressed as Balthazar the Berserker But then a strange thing happened Brian received an unexpected visitor Come any closer and ll scratch your eyes out He snarled angrily at the ickering eyes in the trees Brian Whispered a voice Is that really you Who the fuck are you calling Brian said Brian as menacingly as he could manage Why Brian it is you It was Harold his brother last seen by the road walking with mother a long time ago He said m so happy found you Brian old chap ve been terribly lonely and fancied a chat But Brian had crossed that road and never looked back Hed erased the memory and his soul was now black Harold mate hate to be blunt But look in the mirror you prickly idiot Youre a worthless pathetic sniveling fool d rather spend time with the worms in my stool With that he chased him into the trees and over the dells screaming ll eat you for supper or meet you in hell But fate intervened and Brian got lost And to make matters worse there was a treacherous fog Hello he cried Is anyone there But no one replied and Brian got scared And thats when he saw he wasnt alone small crumpled body was lying in the road Why didnt you leave me said Brian And just let me die Youre my brother said Harold How on earth could And thats when they heard the pitiful cries of a very small hedgehog whose mother just died And suddenly Brian just started to blub He picked up the babe and gave it a hug This little thing you know reminds me of us Left all alone when Mum
