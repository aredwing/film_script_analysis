wonder woman on Hollywood boulevard At Manns Chinese theater Not with Manns Chinese theater just at Manns Chinese theater man where are you from m from Knoxville Tennessee thought you were from

let me be a human and she let me make mistakes And she knows all my mistakes But she knows all my accomplishments as well And my dad missed out on some of my accomplishments Because he was too busy worrying about mistakes The year that she was a cheerleader They won the national champions didnt they They won the cheeroff It wasnt the national It was a cheeroff at six flags over Georgia But theyd never done that before No People thought that should love high school And that should was voted miss union county in high school And best allaround my senior year And was homecoming Queen was on

like was suffocating in that town Karen Wenger she made a few bs you know mostly as And she made a few bs But that wasnt the important thing for her in school It was socializing That was what she was here for To make everybody happy By spreading her own little quality Own little brand of sunshine Around everybodys day every day She thought that she was put here to entertain The people here This wasnt where she was supposed to go and learn always liked to perform Cheerleading you know loved to choreograph dances and stuff like that So performing was what wanted to do knew that She done many a musical or play up there If people were gonna be on a stage She wanted to be there too mechanical whirring Heres what happened the day decided to move to was at college was a college cheerleader and

Are you hot No m used to it laughs feel so much like a loser because didnt come out here To get in a costume and stand on Hollywood boulevard To make chump change You know m out here seriously Trying to make a name for myself Howdy To me it was a different way of panhandling have to say performing you know for money You know and thats basically what see it as Originally m from Texas was born and raised there Born in Austin raised in Houston and Dallas And then lived in Waco The last few years was in Texas Youngest of you know three kids An older brother an older sister You know the whole scenario So yeah kind of a rambunctious kid Lets just say Rebellious and then So it was kind of a rough childhood Batman just kind of fit in to it It just kind of fell in place more or less in didnt really start to get into acting Till about And it was just extra work And of course you need money to invest into like headshots And everything else And of course at the time didnt have it So it took me you know its an investment Acting is actually an investment Then everybody started telling me you know you look just like George Clooney And couldnt figure out who George Clooney was So of course er So that made it even worse for me as an actor Because you know now youre a lookalike ve actually got a black belt in tae kwon do Got one in tiger kung fu studied ninjutsu for a bit And then of course know handtohand From the special forces training So of course started doing lookalike things You know trying to you know fit in somewhere And thats when met superman superman Chris And hed been doing superman out in the boulevard For God years And so he said you know you should come out And work with me as George Clooney Of course the doctor from er and thats how started out Well like Batman think the whole deal is pretty good He gets a lot of attention on the boulevard Hes done birthday parties and has done Christmas parties At like elderly highrises as Actually that he doesnt do as Batman He does his Dr Douglas Ross Because he looks like George Clooney And um But yeah its a living It helps pay the bills cause m disabled So m not able to work right now My relationship with my wife is very good Well my wife guess she likes My wife likes what do She actually wishes of course made more money at doing it But shes kind of proud of the fact That she can tell people that shes married to Batman For one thing and the fact that look like George Clooney She likes that fact too Sandra describe Maxwell Well hesall in all hes a good man Hes a good provider Hes spontaneous very protective Protective of what he loves and what he cares about He has a bit of a anger problem He doesnt necessarily take the anger out on me But he usually tends to get angry over things That he cannot control Love you Take care Youre on your own then Sandra if he would realize that getting angry doesnt change it He would have a better handle on his anger engine revving Dennis you being a

know Trying to get me to get into the industry a little bit She had access and stuff you know So should have jumped on it then But didnt You know cause to me was a wild kid just wanted to go out and find a job that was fun So started off with landscaping On her deathbed she asked me to give it a try You know and before that was in denial didnt want anything to do with it cause saw the headaches and stuff that she went through Coming back thinking she did really crappy on an audition And it turned out to be she did really good And they wanted her for the part Pam Dennis this is something that comes from his soul Its whats driven him Just like my aunt was an actress And it came from her soul and thats what she had to do Whats wrong Why all the crying Wheres your mummy and daddy Gwen where do you live Gwen Pam Dennis in the times that talked to him couple times his stories have varied really wildly He told other people he was with her at her death know that he wasnt there She was a very private person in a lot of ways Her personal you know emotional stuff but And dont think shes his mother mean when would she have had a baby Well m not going to leave him All right all right ryk and its impossible to believe of Sandy That at that point She wouldnt have said to you guys and you know have a son Right right mean thats just unbelievable man and people think that Sandy Dennis Never had you know what mean Never had a son know ve heard that What mean whats your take on that Well thats their opinion You know all know is shes my mom you know Were you close to her in your childhood wasnt really that close with her was more of the troublemaker But think most of what was doing was going out Trying to seek attention you know cause she was always busy with her work And of course my dad he didnt stick around at all You know they werent even married When turned That was the last that ve ever heard from him At that point was already in shelters and group homes And stuff like that Because my mom figured she couldnt handle me Maybe these people can You know and even they didnt have that good of luck with me Something had to have been that think was difficult Because see instances now where sometimes think He didnt get maybe everything That maybe a child needs growing up Maybe attention that every child needs Something cant put my finger on it And again because he doesnt talk about that stuff too often There was a time in my life where was doing Crystal meth And you know just doing speed And decided that enough is enough You know was sitting there was watching And you know how if you do enough speed You start getting delusional So of course m sitting there m watching and see a death scene So it was like for like an instant It was almost like was seeing my
