you two were living rather modestly dont think the number should be too bad Theyre probably talking about something like dont have that money Unfortunately you do The house Its value went through the roof since you bought it And renovated it with my mothers money Well its all community property now So he gets half the house and alimony Theres leeway and well make all the arguments we can But there is a bargaining chip He wants the house He wants to keep living there Yeah And if you let him have it you could end up with a lot of money in your pocket understand he wants it pretty badly m sorry

five minutes The contessa feels she has asked too little since you agreed to buy it That logic is absurd Excuse me What is the price Are you bidding against us Wait We accept the new price No this is a beautiful house And whoever wants it has to pay double The contessa says that since there is so much interest in the house the price is now double Since the last seconds Normale You greedy Americans You think youre so entitled You ruin everything lot of us feel really badly about that Were going Well look in Provence Fascists And her How much will she pay Well see Is it really double the price

have a sudden urge to weep that doesnt mean youve made a mistake Everybody knows old houses have their quirks Especially yearold houses have inherited empty wine bottles one grape every issue of La
