command of Umkhonto we Sizwe the military wing of the African National Congress The state contends that the accused are responsible for acts of sabotage aimed at facilitating violent revolution and an armed invasion of this country with the intention of overthrowing the government Accused number Nelson Mandela Do you plead guilty or not guilty My Lord it is not but the government that should be put in the dock plead not guilty The state has formally advised me that they will be asking for the supreme penalty permissible by law Which is death Our best chance is to attack the credibility of the charges We dispute every falsehood we challenge every charge We think theyll bring in a guilty verdict but we might be able to avoid the death sentence Agreed Agreed Agreed Then be happy Smile This may be the greatest service we will ever do for our people Mandela Mandela My name is Nelson Mandela m the first accused do not deny that planned sabotage did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness nor because have any love for violence The hard facts are that years of nonviolence had brought the African people nothing but more and more repressive legislation and fewer and fewer rights Africans want a just share in the whole of South Africa We want equal political rights one man one vote have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people have fought against white domination have fought against black domination have cherished the ideal of a free democratic society where all persons live together in harmony with equal opportunities It is an ideal which hope to live for and achieve but if needs be it is an ideal for which am prepared to die Amandla Awethu Amandla Awethu Before the judge imposes the supreme penalty there is one more step He will ask the first accused Nelson Have you any reason to advance whether the sentence should not be passed You could then say have nothing more to say That wont help your appeal There will be no appeal No appeal We have talked about this We are ready All rise have reached my verdict The defendants will rise The accused are all found guilty as charged The accused have made high moral claims for their actions In essence they have courted martyrdom at the hands of what they call their oppressors But will not give them that satisfaction Let us show the world that we are a nation of laws and where possible we temper justice with mercy have therefore decided not to impose the supreme penalty The sentence in the case of all the accused will be life imprisonment All right get out kaffirs In a line All right Move move get

Can you imagine what the blacks would do to us if they got us in their power am black You are different That is why we are talking to you These are the same people that threw him in jail that persecuted his wife that murdered his friends and hes talking to them dont believe you dont want revenge You are right do So How can we ever allow you to have any real power Well admit want revenge but want something more than that and that is to live without fear and hatred Sweet dreams Mr Mandela have no choice have seen what fear has done to your people Youve always been afraid of us and it has made you an unjust and brutal people Now consider our position We know that one day we will be free and we will be the rulers of our country but do we want to live in the same hell as you do now That would be to lock ourselves back into prison and our children and generations after that Gentlemen look can tell you for nothing when we come to power there will be no revenge Its blacks that continue to be the victims of this unprecedented wave of unrest Nearly people have died since September Only one white has been killed Police stuck to their armored personnel carriers No rubber

her again until Is she still my wife ve seen you with her and the way you look at her photograph You love her This is very true my friend never stopped loving her But love her as she was The first step to regaining the confidence of the markets is your release and then of course the release of your colleagues Weve briefed the president Hes a pragmatist he heard us The government agrees to lift the ban on the and repeal the race laws You undertake to renounce violence No But you said said nothing listened But you will withdraw your demand for majority rule No Then what are you giving us in exchange for what we give you Nothing These meetings have been a complete waste of all our time Well wouldnt say that ve wasted my time The president has made up his mind It cant be stopped now The president is a member of the Gereformeerde Kerk very Calvinist He believes God calls him to do a special task in a special time After the inauguration service he wept and said that God was calling him to save the people of South Africa President de Klerk Its this way Hang on shoelace Thank you Yeah Well this is it Mr Mandela Mr President May congratulate you on your election Thank you You have been called to a very special task in a very special time So believe Just here Yeah Mr Mandela have taken the decision to release you Unconditionally car will be ready at tomorrow morning to take you to the airport plane will be waiting to fly you directly to Johannesburg where the official release ceremony will take place Mr De Klerk your people have taken away half of my life and returned me an old man to a home that has been long abandoned and a family that have grown up without me dont want you at my side at that moment dont want to be told that you have given me my freedom Just open the gate and let me go Any minute now Tata Hello hello How are you Auntie Yeah m good wouldnt do it without you You want me to hold your hand In case stumble Somebody want me Dont be fooled by all that cheering Madiba Theres anger out there know that Winnie Winnie Its just been so long Its better that way am so tired just want to sleep The government accepts that change must come but say to you again we must find a way to share power We must find a way to protect the rights of the minorities Suddenly the illusion of white power is beginning to crumble For the first time since apartheid began the government here is beginning to talk about the need for reform and among ordinary white people feelings now range from bewilderment to anger to fear De Klerk will not You know this That is not going to happen We are not sharing power with these whites As long as there are white people in South Africa that is not going to happen mean just how How do we accept power sharing with the whites What do we do Do we fight Do we start a war We have a war What you think this is not a war We have a war what we need now is victory Comrades our people can never accept sharing power with the whites People will not accept this What de Klerk wants is ministers in the new government Why should de Klerk get what he wants De Klerk is right We must let them share the power little power for a little while until the fear has passed Madiba dont think our people will accept that Then we must make them accept We are their leaders That is our job These old men just want to talk The days of talking are over Go and get her hear the voice of the people And that voice says We will fight Mama Madiba wants to see you inside All right What Are you ashamed to greet me in front of our people Winnie when you speak in public you must represent the policies of the And what does that mean We are negotiating We are not fighting a war But the people have chosen to fight Do you want me to betray our people Do betray our people You have been away a long time What does that mean ve been away Does that mean now you can terrorize people The burning the necklacing that has to stop Winnie You realize theres a war out there The people are angry We are all angry am angry You are angry but you must show loyalty Loyalty Winnie Mandela Loyalty have decided that it would be better if live in my own home Better for the party Better for us Better for the party You have your own home in Diepkloof You have your own company there Am to blame because dont want to be alone You know so much of my life have been alone We have both been alone too much Winnie Why Walter Tell me why hmm Why why do you show me this Do you think dont know This has gone too far If she was discrete about this have accepted the situation What business is it of anyone else She humiliates you in public Madiba And that hurts all of us Come now What they have done to my wife is their only victory over me In view of the tensions that have arisen between my wife and myself in the recent months we have mutually agreed that a separation would be best for each of us shall personally never regret the life that we tried to share together part from my wife with no recriminations embrace her with all the love and affection have nursed for her inside and outside of prison from the moment first met her Ladies and gentlemen hope that you can appreciate the pain that am going through Thank you Mr Mandela Police opened fire on guncarrying demonstrators Mr Mandela President de Klerk here The situation on the streets is out of control Is this the peaceful South Africa you say you want Blackonblack violence has reached proportions of near civil war They began fighting as the power struggle developed in South Africa to replace white rule with black Zulus rampaged through Boipatong cutting down anyone they saw Madiba do something Do something Do something do something President de Klerk blames the Boipatong massacre attacks by the Inkatha Freedom Party supporters on an rally near Johannesburg has left people dead It could set back the peace process in South Africa by months if not years violence has now put South Africas constitution de Klerk has attacked what he calls the ultimatum politics of the Increasing financial and diplomatic isolation Please sit down todays move on Capitol Hill the indications Mr Mandela youre going to be talking into that camera Yes this one little bit more light please Yeah lovely you see wondering whether it can survive the rage that divides that nation black and white but it does not derail talks toward ending white rule South African president de Klerk Panic chaos confusion white minoritys worst nightmare crisis for this country seconds Someone gave me this note when was leaving Boipatong and want to read it to you It says No peace Do not talk about peace We have had enough Please Mr Mandela no peace Give us weapons not peace Here is my answer There is only one way forward and that is peace know that is not what you want to hear but there is no other way am your leader and as long as am your leader m going to give you leadership As long as am your leader am going to tell you always when you are wrong and tell you now you are wrong have given my life to the struggle ve been willing to die have lost years of my life in prison but tell you now have forgiven them If can forgive them then you can forgive them We cannot win a war but we can win an election So my people stay home be peaceful and when election day comes vote Cut there Ja weve cut After so much suffering why would anyone believe that putting a mark on a piece of paper is going to change the world still dream the old dream back in the house in Orlando can hear all the ones that have loved most in the world want to reach them to touch them but they have gone Tata Madiba are you ready for this These are my jailers now This is a proud day Mr Mandela Feels good have walked a long walk to freedom It has been a lonely road and it is not over yet know that my country was not made to be a land of hatred No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin People
