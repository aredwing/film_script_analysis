But the strained relations Madame between my government and Spain They can never affect ours Monsieur Chanut Madame you are my despair Why Because you rebuff me always with such charm that at the end of all our interviews find myself always in a veritable glow of disappointment And of anticipation Your Majesty our university at Uppsala is the oldest in Sweden one of the oldest in Europe To admit professors from Spain and Italy might corrupt the purity of our teaching The danger is not so much of corruption as of staleness We need new wine in the old bottles Here is the new draft of the treaty

arts of living You find us uncouth Look at these people This is my lager ll say this for them they know how to enjoy themselves At home our people are less hearty but more graceful Its all a question of climate You cant serenade a woman in a snowstorm All the graces in the arts of love the elaborate approaches that would make the game of love amusing can only be practiced in those countries that quiver in the heat of the sun in the still languorous nights where every breeze caresses with amour Iove as we understand it is a technique that must be developed in hot countries Sounds glamorous and yet What Somewhat mechanical Evidently you Spaniards make too much fuss about a simple elemental thing like love We Swedes are more direct But thats civilization Disguise the elemental with the glamorous great love has to be nourished has to be Great love Dont you believe in its possibility In its possibility yes but not in its existence great love perfect love is an illusion It is the golden fable of which we all dream But in ordinary life it does not happen In ordinary life one must be content with less So young and yet so disillusioned Young man you are cynical Not at all Merely

collection of royal portraits My suitors usually come in oil And ve kept them because love a good painting Why did you go out of your way to make me ridiculous All that idiotic talk of love and beauty It made my heart beat It made me dream like a fool and talk like one thought youd understand when you saw me again what had happened That it had been so enchanting to be a woman Not a queen just a woman in a mans arms Yes if youd left my heart alone But fell in love with you love you Antonio Look the coin you gave me for helping you ve slept with it in my hand each night Forgive me for being a

service to Sweden tell you Sweden is facing the greatest danger in her history Greater than war And its a danger that hides in the highest councils of the nation in the palace itself In the very chamber of the Queen Nay do not charge the queen with disloyalty But she is under a spell The spell of Spanish witchcraft The Spaniard is here with a proposal from Philip of Spain Why doesnt she send him away Do you want a Spanish sovereign No Do you want to give up the palace and faith for which our fathers fought and died to go to Rome No Youre the most popular man in the kingdom Youve only to appear in public and the mob starts shouting Youre the only one who can demand of the Queen to send the Spaniard home Youre the only one who can save Sweden from this calamity The Council awaits Her Majesty Her Majesty drives abroad with the Spaniard The business of the state may wait Whatever the Queen does Sweden will not suffer Send that Spaniard back home Send him away Down with the Spaniard Evidently my people who are said to love me do not wish me to be happy Our Prince Charles who has fought for us is kept apart and scorned The Queen disports herself with a Spaniard ask you Swedes will you tolerate this infamy No Then do something about it The Queen See She rides openly with him Down with the Spaniard Come on And charge you Magnus with having deliberately aroused the masses against the Queen No the facts speak for themselves Chancellor The Church will never permit such a marriage The Queen does not contemplate such a marriage Then why doesnt she send the Spaniard home have been driving in the streets and have seen disgraceful things How is it that we are not better policed In insulting our guests they insult us Why is this not made clear to them The people resent this man Your Majesty Not in his own person but as interfering with our hopes of your marriage to Prince Charles You have fed them this hope when you have known all the time that have no wish to gratify it hold you responsible All of you Your Majesty is not considering to accept King Philips offer No In that case the presence here of the Spanish envoy is superfluous He could go home Why Do peer into the lives of my subjects and dictate to them whom they shall love Will serve them less if am happy What strangely foolish title is it that calls me ruler if in what concerns me most nearly m to have no voice It is intolerable There is a freedom which is mine and which the state cannot take away To the unreasonable tyranny of the mob and to the malicious tyranny of palace intrigue shall not submit Know this all of you General Your Majesty the crowd demands to see you They demand entrance to the palace Are you pleased Count Magnus Theres no cause for alarm m not alarmed General The guards are ready and waiting Their guns are primed Shall order them to fire No General Shall arrest the ringleaders No Then what shall do Your Majesty Let them in General Your Majesty you cannot do that But Your Majesty Let them in Let no one follow me Your Majesty you must not go alone am not afraid of my subjects Dismiss the guards Right face Forward march Open the doors Your Majesty Well my subjects is it

you a good blacksmith should be My father was a blacksmith before me and his father was before him What if came to your smithy and told you didnt like your blacksmithing Youd think it unreasonable and rightly so My business is governing And have the knack of it as you have yours for your trade by inheritance My father was a king and his father before him My father died for Sweden and live for her Now my good people go home to your work and leave me to mine My blessing on all of you Long live the Queen Too bad Count Magnus Here comes that Spaniard all alone Kill the Spaniard Fortunate coincidence Can be of help to Your Excellency You might call off your hirelings and let me proceed to the embassy dont understand Your Excellencys insinuations but can take no chances of complicating our splendid relations with Spain Therefore must insist on giving you my personal protection and escort horse The protection offered a prisoner Your Excellency For your own safety You go to the embassy Pedro You hate him You have incited this riot against him He is safe Your Majesty which but for my intervention he might not have been ask you to bring him here to me at once should do so gladly could assume the risk Feeling is running high in the city There is only one safe course for Seor Antonio that you sign the passport for his return You are a jealous upstart Magnus You cannot endure that love him If am an upstart Your Majesty glory in it for owe my rise to your favors And to be jealous of Antonio is a high form of patriotism This is dangerous for you Magnus Do you realize how dangerous Put me to death If die he dies My orders are in good hands It is inevitable Your Majesty He or Prepare the passport for the Spanish envoy My Lord Ambassador this passport will assure your safe journey to the border Count de la Gardie you are responsible for His Excellencys safety Permit me Your Excellency you will tell your master were deeply sensible of the honor he has done to me The ship Amaranta awaits you at the harbor of Helsingborg wish you a safe journey My Lord Can be of service to Your Excellency have no recourse against you here My Lord am an ambassador on foreign soil But if you could do me the courtesy to meet me on neutral ground That can be arranged Your Excellency shall provide convoy for you to the frontier Beyond the frontier shall be at your service to

symbol Chancellor long to be a human being This longing cannot suppress And yet you must You will His hand is upon you The Kings have always listened to you with awe Oxenstierna respect no one in the kingdom as much as you Yet something in me cries out that this cannot be true that one must live for oneself After all Chancellor ones own life is all one has Yes Your Majesty that is all one has
