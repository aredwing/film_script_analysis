daughter Raquel m Charles Dakin and this is my partner Mr Coons How do you do Pleased to meet you m a miner claimed the Durango You claimed the Durango Yes May ask what you expect to find in it Gold

Perhaps well be calling you Seor Dakin the Zinc King eh Vamonos Raquel Hasta la vista Seor Dakin Seorita Adios Seor Coons Yeah So long kid If you should happen to need any more equipment or any

stake in this business Relax Ernie m trying to Well youve come this far Maybe youd like to take a look at a million dollars just saw a million dollars Come on well take a look at the other one There it is Mr Dakin Every ounce of it Look at it Ernie What do you see Gold Mr Dakin No what else dont get you Do you know whats really in these sacks Ernie Paris Rio comfort good living And something else Like spending years in a rotten stinking little cell And waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat wondering whether or not d been babbling on about it Or whether its still safe or not Its always been safe Mr Dakin Oh know that Ernie Youre the one man trust The one man can depend on Its just that funny things happen in nightmares But the nightmares are over now Ernie were gonna live Weve paid years for this million bucks And nobodys gonna take it away from us But nobody d like to get some information about a friend of mine think he was in here yesterday on business His names Dakin Charlie Dakin Dakin Dakin dont think remember him Pardon me couldnt help overhearing think can take care of this Frank That name seems familiar Dakin did you say Yeah thats right Tall fellow dark about years old Yeah thats the one You the law Oh no were just pals of his In some trouble is he Maybe What do you mean maybe He stole something from us something big thought maybe that it was something like that You seem to know quite a lot about this fellow Dakin No noticed him because he seemed so nervous So upset Where is he That couldnt say Is Dakin really a miner Is that what he told you He asked me about mining operations in Mexico recall that because thought it was odd at the time He was on his way he said to Mexico City Are you sure thats what he said Oh yes recall that distinctly Thanks friend Dont mention it always like to do a stranger a favour Hes lyin Of course hes lyin What do we do now We wait till Charlie comes in or junior there goes out to find him Then we follow him We cant make it in this car So well trade it in for a car that make it Whats up Ernie Car comin Get in the house Hello Mr Dakin Hello Mr Higgins can see youve been working your hands are getting calloused Yeah worth of maintenance you know You might offer me a drink of water Yes sure By the way told them at the office where was going They know m up here Thanks Not at all suppose youre wondering why came up No ve been expecting you Expecting me Why Because youre the nosey type Mr Higgins You want to know claimed the Durango think know know that Charles Dakin was released from a California prison just a few days ago After serving a year term for manslaughter Go on also know that your hiding out from someone And that youre a thief Is that all Not quite know youve stolen and thats the most important thing of all Theres only one thing you couldve taken that would have brought you up here Mr Dakin One thing Gold An immense amount of stolen gold dont know how much you have But common sense tells me you have it Here At the Durango What else does your common sense tell you Mr Higgins For instance Of course you know well have to kill you Kill me You dont understand m here to help you You need me Listen Mr Dakin m not a fool know the problems youve faced What in the world could you do with the gold when theres a law against owning it You could claim a mine Get hold of a goldmine Take your own gold out of your own property and let the government pay you for it How do fit in to all this Mr Higgins But there are things you dont know about mining For instance Have you ever heard of a little thing called Form No Its an affidavit statement that every miner has to make before he can get one penny from the mint Here listen to this part The gold referred to herein was obtained by mining or panning and no part thereof has been held by this depositor in noncompliance of the Act of march No part of such gold has ever entered into monetary or industrial use Every single deposit of gross ounces or more has to be sworn to Mr Dakin And do you know who has to countersign it An examiner a notary public Me And they trust me Mr Dakin With checking your gold in youll be perfectly safe Think of it way One half of what you get For safety Safety Well ll be as interested in seeing you succeed in this thing as you are Then everythings settled Seems that way doesnt it Thanks Youre a very reasonable man But then one must be reasonable when theres so much involved You probably have at least Youre off Mr Higgins million Why the reward alone would probably set a man up for life Maybe at least didnt mean no wouldnt do a thing like that understand Mr Higgins picked up a little sample Thought it might come in handy for an assay report Or do we need that No definitely not The last thing in the world you want is for a professional assayer to go over this stuff Why its absolutely dynamite in this form Mr Dakin Any government expert could tell it didnt come from the Durango Thats why you have to mill it up here little at a time Run it over mercury and recover it in a retort That way it will be in amalgam form and hard to trace Probably be able to send the amalgam direst to the mint Therell be no need for it to go through anybody elses hands And no lumps pulverize this stuff before you salt it Incidentally d better hire a couple of men for you when go back ll take care of that myself Its entirely up to you of course But could save you a trip to town dont have to go to town Ever heard of a little place called San Gabriel up there in the hills San Gabriel Yes seems to me have few shepherds Mexicans live up there dont they Say do you mind me asking why you didnt change your name Mr Dakin Oh yes Youve paid your debt to society Suppose we leave it that way What society doesnt know wont hurt it ll be up again tomorrow Youll need a lot of mercury and a retort In the meantime rig up an amalgamating table About a mile above here d say Come on Arent we gonna ride up In this coffeegrinder Theyd hear us comin a mile away Carmencita its a long time since ve seen you Not since the broken arm eh What a gay bandage What a wound How did this dreadful injury occur Rafael Lpez bit me Rafael Lpez is a monster To go around biting the fingers of little girls And why did Rafael Lpez bite you Because hit him in the face with a tortilla think Nevertheless Rafael Lpez is a barbarian eh Alright Carmencita thats all Seorita will pay now Oh what a beautiful flower will give you a receipt Carmencita Mesales For services rendered one flower Gracias Seorita Chavez Ah Seor Dakin Come in Come in El chaqueta pap Oh Seor Dakin Hello thank you hope m not interrupting anything No come in my friend You are welcome Sintese seor Thank you very much Nothing wrong at the mine hope No no everythings fine m glad to hear that Stop it Wine Raquel Tell me have you started production yet As a matter of fact Doctor thats what came to see you about Were so far ahead in production that my partner and cant handle it We need some help Thats wonderful my friend You said the other day you might be able to get us a few men here in town Well of course only Only what Doctor There may be a problem Well m willing to pay anything you ask No its not that my friend m sure we can find the men for you But a few of them may not take your mine seriously mean know what you mean Mr Dakin you make me feel like The Devil trying to shake the faith of the saint have shamed myself Forgive me You ask for a few men alright you shall have them Now is there anything else can do for you Well well be doing our milling at the mine Well be needing an amalgamating table Amalgamating table Well dont know Ysidro lvarez Ysidro lvarez he would have one Only he might not even know where to find it wonderful man Seor Dakin Many years ago he was a miner himself If there is such a table anywhere in these mountains he will know of it My daughter is right seor Ysidro is your man believe me Where can find Seor Alvarez will take you Seor Dakin It is not far Oh fine thanks Unless you need me here Father No go on Thanks a lot Doctor Ysidro This is Mr Dakin Cmo lo haces He has claimed the Durango and wants an amalgamating table Ysidro Es muy grosero de que te ras Ysidro Seorita Slo de pensarlo me hace rer What did he say Excuse me seor But you are wanting an amalgamation table for the Durango To me it seems entirely reasonable Seorita know that mine And believe me in my own mouth there is more gold Well then take it you dont have the kind of table m looking for Do you know anybody the might have one Thanks a lot Listen you serious you need it Yeah Well have one Its not in very good shape Come just take a look Oh This an amalgamating table Of course no Thats an old Indian dish Now there is a table made it myself Still good like years ago Whatll you take for it Thats a good table one leg or two Perhaps dont know Whats the matter have a conscience But you said the table was still good It is Seorita it is But believe me seor would give you my table work in your mine for bread alone if that can help you but Look brought some ore from the Durango You want to assay it up here Nothing to it ll pan it How long will it take Maybe an hour Maybe less ll tell you what ll do ll leave it up here with you and you look it over If you dont find any gold in it ll take it like a man But if by some chance you find gold ll pick up the table How about it No sense seor Alright ll do it And look it over hard Ysidro will Seorita will m sorry Why Because everyone thinks so little of your mine Sometimes get a little discouraged but Dont be discouraged Seor Dakin Never be discouraged Well what shall we do for an hour Would you like to go back and talk with Father Or maybe you would rather see San Gabriel d rather look at the town Alright then San Gabriel it shall be Well had no idea there was a place like this up in these mountains Its like part of the Old World It part of the Old World The Jesuits built it in the th century Whats going on over there That is the agua de San Gabriel The only water we have You mean the only water for washing No seor The only water for anything Be sure you tell your mother to boil that water before any of you drink it My father and take our drinking water from the well at Durango Whats that communal sheepdip In spring all the men gather here to help each other with the dipping and shearing No wonder the water needs boiling We need a new well but the waters very deep in the ground here and the cost of drilling is beyond the means of San Gabriel Whats this building Thats the Mission One of the oldest in Arizona We use it as a schoolhouse now teach the children there And that is our church Our priest comes here only once a month now For baptising marriages So youre a schoolmaam eh Were you born here Yes But ve been away a lot at a convent in Tucson What are your plans My plans mean your ambition You know your dreams You do have dreams dont you Yes have dreams Come will show you This is my favorite dreaming spot From here can see the whole world Out there Mexico City Rio Buenos Aires And over there New York London Paris And over there San Francisco And there Canada And over there Hawaii Australia the Orient You got an for geography dream something of seeing them All of them But But what But will probably never leave San Gabriel Isnt that just as well You know there arent many such places left in the world Without struggle violence At least youve got contentment up here Contentment Theres no contentment in San Gabriel Theres only poverty Theres only dirt m sorry Why dont understand myself ve never said these thing to anyone before But somehow it seems different with you Somehow everything seems different with you Thank you Seor When a person becomes happy there seems to be a point for everything Isnt there Perhaps even in San Gabriel would not be surprised if The Blue Lady herself came to my father while we were gone and told him never to worry again Whos The Blue Lady Mexican legend Shes supposed to be the ghost of an extremely devout Spanish lady named Doa Maria Coronel She lived years ago Do you believe in ghosts up here The Seorita is a very much respected spirit in this part of Arizona Why people will tell you she has been known to appear in great gifts from Heaven to those who are worthy Apparently she hasnt been around lately None of us who are living have ever seen her am afraid we are unworthy Sort of leaves out too If anyone was worthy My father for example He would get a new clinic and all the vaccines in it and a fine hospital And what about What would she do for you mean The Blue Lady She would make it possible for me to fall in love And me suppose she came knocking at door Why thered be gold in your empty mine Of course Oh would like to see Ysidros face then So would It must be finished by now Come will take you back Hey Ysidro is my daughter still here Do you have the table Table Ysidro You look sick here let me see your tongue Doctor you know me for many years Do you think m honest Youve always been honest yes Mr Dakin was here With my daughter yes

dont know Doctor Last year last month yesterday the Durango was empty know that mine just like my own self Then he was right He was right and we were the fools He knew the gold was there m not a religious fellow but think saw a miracle Maybe you did Ysidro There are many kinds of miracles Maybe you seen one Father what has happened Is something wrong No theres nothing wrong Then what is it Excuse me Seor The table is yours In years mining never seen such gold do not pretend seor that knew you would find it But know how hard you must have worked and how much faith you must have had And believe me am as happy for the faith in yourself as for the success which it has brought you Well thank you Doctor Can do anything else for you Well we need a few men at the mine You think you can find some time to help out You mean you want me to help you If you want to Of course gracias muchos gracias Seor Dont worry Mr Dakin apart from him will have the workers for you by tomorrow Theres no

happened to follow him looking for you He headed up here as fast as he could We followed him Playing the bloodhound now Max Thanks Charlie thanks Now whats Higgins got on you Higgins can be a blessing or a curse Depending entirely on how you handle him If Seor Dakin tells you everything is going to be alright you must believe him Perhaps he does not know that hes in danger That other man is evil feel it So now you are Pepita the gypsy fortuneteller eh You just dont worry about him Leave his fate with The Blue Lady Now let me see if got it straight Higgins sells the gold to the mint and brings the money back up here to us eh Yeah we stay off being seen to collect under cover What a deal not a hitch Just another gold mine selling to the government But youre right about one thing Charlie Wed never get away with it without Higgins Whats his cut This will kill you Half Half Hey he can pick up grand just by turning us in Well guess ll have to go down and have a little talk with Mr Higgins Hes coming up here tomorrow Talkins safer up here in the mountains Max in case you got any homicidal ideas youd better take a look at how things stand First you can kill me and Ernie and take over the whole deal In that case my friends outside will either kill you or turn you over to the police Second can kill Call it selfdefence Have witnesses to prove that you threatened their miracleman But thats not so good Thatd bring the sheriff snooping around And third We can call it a truce And sit it out or until Mr Higgins sells all the gold to the government Well split it up in ways and live happily ever after Which will it be Max What do say Carl Its up to you Okay Charlie well sit it out Youd better watch where youre sitting Wait a minute told you a dozen times no lumps Just sand You want them to see that theres no gold in that rock Why dont you watch what youre doing Whats eating you Youre puttin in too much Theyll even think we struck the motherlode Come on well be here all night How are you doing Well see it The Blue Lady must have liked Mr Dakin more pounds of that beautiful gold You know thought was a miner and was a dumb or a wicked one Just say dumb Dumb thats pretty good for a weeks work Its gotta be better How about that Higgins We can start putting much more gold into this thing now ll tell them weve struck jewelry rock Jewelry rock Whats that Thats a miners term for very rich ore After a while those veins always pinch off Oursll pinch off after a million dollars How are we gonna keep other prospectors from stampedin up here when they find out about this jewelry rock do all my business over in Tucson If theres any stampeding itll be done in the mountains around there Youre a smart hombre Higgins get by Oh when brought that strongbox here meant it for portion dont get you Well mean to say naturally have my own bank in Tucson ll just take my share back with me Say you know Higgins almost nearly forgot about your share That was a fifth was it fifth Why no Mr Dakin said was to get a half Oh it must have been a slip of the tongue think he must have meant a fifth dont you That means for each one of guys Of course if theres only of us didnt mean Yes a fifthd be fine Well your fifth up to now is just So ll put it right in the box and we can watch it grow But d like Now listen Higgins We took a pretty big chance on you Of course its a little late for you to try to collect that reward because you got our powerofattorney and you cashed the first cheque that you got from the mint That makes you an accessory But if you leave your share right here Its a pretty good cinch youre gonna come back with the rest of the payments Alright Ernie ll take over you get some sleep Them lugs sitting over there lickin their chops and countin their money over and over Give me the word Mr Dakin ll set a charge of dynamite under that shack Well take our chances If only had a gun Give me a cigarette We made a deal Ernie remember Okay
