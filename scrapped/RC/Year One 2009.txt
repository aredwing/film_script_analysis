so young Yeah What are those doors there Behind these doors is the Holy of Holies earthly domain of the gods place so ineffably sacred so powerful that to enter is instant death Who cleans it Needs no cleaning Kind of makes you think about the people that built it Like did they die instantly or were they given a courtesy second to get out of there by the gods They were allowed to finish given four and a half seconds then the gods descended What if a bug goes in there Instant death for the bug Are there dead bugs all over Because nobody cleans it Theyre vaporized immediately by a holy beam of

moment And also if you could give me the power to see through womens clothing without them knowing that would be really great Hello Hasnt it occurred to you that it might be silent because God is not in here Look around Theres nothing in here That doesnt prove anything Maybe he stepped away For what God stuff If he needs something he can create it from nothing Whats the point of being God if you keep running for things Let me just put something out there Maybe God doesnt exist What So everything is just random Then nothing would mean anything What would be the point That is the point That theres no point Thats stupid Youre stupid No Theres something bigger than me Theres nothing bigger than you Dont touch my belly to make a point Fine Okay m sorry have a mans body m maturing at my own pace You are so jealous of me Jealous That youre a bullshit artist That every time you speak its bullshit coming out of your mouth You would believe in God if youve ever been with a woman m a virgin

friend And his young friend Dont kill either of them Everyone knows the chosen gets a plus one Is it possible Is he truly chosen Well of course its possible Highly doubtful Majesty with respect whether he is chosen or not is no longer the issue If you were to kill him now given the public mood it could inflame the situation so as to cause a radical regime change If you take my meaning Yes
