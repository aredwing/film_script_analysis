years and shes here with her dad to talk about it Tell us when did you realize that Tessa was first ill Four years ago She had well we thought it was the flu Tessas mum and l But the flu just wouldnt clear up The blood test confirmed our worst fears The doctors told us they couldnt hold out any hope for her survival which brought us to the point where Tessa felt like she had no choice but to end her chemotherapy entirely Tessa you chose to give up the treatment Thats a big decision for a yearold If may The more aggressive treatments they would have only slightly prolonged Tessas life There are other ways to maintain her health Dad For example studies have shown that good nutrition can rebalance a system entirely Thats why were here really to raise awareness and Dad What Hes gonna have to stop sometime Stop what Tessa He knows its gonna happen But he cant stop hoping that it wont Its true that if kept going with the chemo d probably live a bit longer But it made me feel so bad And there are things want to do before die Things Yeah ve got a list Oh Your dad didnt mention that Thats cause he doesnt know about it Most of whats on it is illegal m almost scared to ask Well nearly
