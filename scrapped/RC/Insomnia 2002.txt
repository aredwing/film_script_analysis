respect your profession write about it wanted to become a cop after school couldnt pass all the tests You shouldve tried Internal Affairs Theyd have taken you What do you want from me After Kay died knew everyone would think meant to do it So cleaned the body removed all evidence connecting it to me Except for your fucking novel You dont always see the wood for the trees You for one should have figured that out by now When heard they had brought somebody from panicked knew the locals would connect me to Kay eventually could handle them They never look in the eyes of a killer Killing changes you You know that Its not guilt never meant to do it Its like awareness Life is so important How could it be so fucking fragile Youd see it right away wouldnt you You trying to impress me Because you got the wrong guy Killing that girl made you feel special But youre not Youre the same pathetic freak ve been dealing with for years Know how many of you caught with your pants down never touched her like that You wanted to Now you wish you had Best you could do is clip her nails Now youre so different You dont get it do you Youre my job Youre what m paid to do Youre about as mysterious to me as a toilet is to a plumber Reasons for doing what you did Who gives a fuck Motivations are everything Will What did you see through the fog saw pretty clearly didnt saw you take aim Forget it shoot your partner in the chest heard him say Get away from me Why Anything to do with Internal Affairs investigation All that tension in your department You think m that easy m saying thats how it looks Maybe even how it feels How did it feel when you found out it was Hap Guilt Relief Suddenly youre free and clear Did you think about it before that moment What would it be like if he wasnt there anymore Doesnt mean you did it on purpose You figure if you got something on me then ll just roll over Protect my reputation No Protect your lifes work The scumbags you put away will be back on the street before you go on trial With Hap gone youre free and clear Why mess with that Kay Connell Remember her Its your choice Think of all the other Kay Connells Do the math Youre a pragmatist You have to be because of your job This isnt easy but want you to understand were in the same situation here You didnt mean to kill Hap any more than meant to kill Kay But thats hard for them to believe so thats why we need each other We gotta find a patsy for the Connell case and make it stick Then you go back to Los Angeles and can go back to living my life So what do you need from me What do they know about me They found a signed copy of one of your books at Kays house So youll be brought in for questioning At the station Thats what they usually do Brought in for questioning can write that easily Calm down Its no big thing Its preliminary inquiry so just tell the truth Tell them about Randy Why are you talking about Randy Talk about your relationship with Kay You cant hide it so just say it Randy is none of your business Its not your affair Shouldnt tell them she was unhappy Tell them she was unhappy but let them find Randy themselves That way theyll make it stick Understand We need a wild card wild card Yeah Something thats there Something we can use Its in every good detective novel You still have the No Really Thats a shame We could use that Thatd be very convincing for them This is my stop Dormer Wild card Night everyone Night Francis Working some overtime Nice Cracking some big cases Night Night guys This is always the worst time of night for me Too late for yesterday too early for tomorrow Sorry about the tape had to make sure youd follow through ll follow through ve been thinking it over should tell them about Randy think thats a bad idea But hes the patsy He deserves it You should have heard the shit Kay told me But these are cops Theyre not children You dont throw things like that in their lap ll push them toward Randy When the time is right We dont have the gun How will we convince them hes guilty Did you keep the dress The dress Kays dress nail clippings What did you do with those Thats great The dress We could use that Even better than the gun Where could he have taken her Whered you take her She died in the cabin right Yeah Whered you take her to clean her up Dont think about that This is tough enough for you It was an accident Yeah didnt mean to kill her you know know but what happened She called and said that she and Randy had had a fight She wanted to come over and talk and said Meet me at our place Thats the cabin at the beach She comes over Shes distraught and a little drunk She starts telling me about how Randy and Tanya were carrying on only wanted to comfort her Hold her kissed her and got a little excited and she started laughing at me She wouldn t stop laughing Ever had someone laugh at you when youre like that Vulnerable Laughing their ass off Someone you thought respected you You ever have that happen just wanted to stop her laughing And then you know hit her Couple of times to stop her Get a little respect Randy did it all the time She liked it when he did it She never blamed him Never wanted to leave him do it she starts screaming She wouldn t stop Shes screaming put my hand over her mouth Then m really scared m scared shitless More scared than ve ever been m more scared than her And then everything was clear There was no turning back And after that was calm Real calm You and share a secret We know how easy it is to kill somebody That ultimate taboo It doesnt exist outside our minds didn t murder her killed her but it just ended up that way So whered you take the body Thanks for listening to me Feels good to talk about that stuff ll be able to sleep now You wanna talk about Hap Morning Your phone isnt working turned it off needed to sleep Sorry Fred called that author He was happy to cooperate Hell be in first thing so we need to get to the office forgot to tell you they sell these in stores in Anchorage No way of finding out who bought it Okay Bet youre looking forward to getting back to Back to robbery homicide or maybe not What are you saying to me Ellie Nothing Are you doing okay You havent been sleeping much No havent No good cop cant sleep because a piece of the puzzles missing bad cop because his conscience wont let him You said that once did Sounds like something d say dont it ll see you back there In what regard were you and her familiar How did you know her She was an avid reader of my novels When did you meet her first year ago She came to a signing in Nightmute She hung around afterwards We chatted about my writing and how she wanted to write then she asked if she could visit me and talk about books things like that And she did Yeah we became very close She got comfortable enough to show me her writing What does she write Poetry actually Any good No not really You tell her that Why would Exactly what was the nature of your relationship to this girl Finch was someone she could talk to Someone outside of her everyday life Thats why she needed me and approached me Whyd she need you for that Well her boyfriend Randy Randy Stetz Abusive little prick He hit her We know all this already It was getting worse So lot worse Really Why all this eagerness to talk about Randy Youre right m sorry Thats probably all hearsay dont want anything say taken the wrong way Anything you say to us at this stage is in confidence Secondly were not a bunch of hotheads wholl draw crazy conclusions Okay Please continue One more thing Probably doesnt mean much but think Kay was scared have myself to blame for that Why is that Randy knew who was He knew that she had a friend someone she confided in It made him furious She wrote about being scared Her letters were getting desperate You still have these letters by any chance probably do Do you think it might help They might Okay Anything else The thing that worried her the most was the gun He had this old handgun He showed it to her dont know where he got it probably wasnt even his but he said hed use it if he found out who she was seeing He kept it hidden in a heating vent You know in the skirting boards It might be the Get me Judge Biggs What m getting a search warrant to Randys Get Judge Biggs on the phone should get over there No No Youre the guy hes talking to So were waiting for the warrant Okay Do you know when Randy showed her the gun February No probably January Why didnt you come forward when she died She didnt want anybody to know Even when she was dead Beaten to death Her body dumped on a

up with you Internal Affairs is coming down on our department Hap he was gonna cut a deal and bring me straight into it They wouldve reopened Dobbs case he wouldve walked Now that wont happen And dont
