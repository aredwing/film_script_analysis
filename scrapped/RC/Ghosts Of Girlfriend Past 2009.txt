to your mind Then just when she begins to think that youre another you know vanillanice guy that she can tool around with all night without getting naked you insult her Flip the power dynamic and you let her know youre here to play Well Jenny said she doesnt like games Forget about that broad thought all this was to get her back Thats why you gotta forget about her Its your feelings for her that are killing your game If theres one thing that you learn tonight its this The power of a relationship lies with whoever cares less Amen to that brother One day youre gonna wake up with some chick spooning you know thinking about love And at that moment you have gotta get up Do not walk dont get your shoes run the hell out of there Because maybe not the next day or the next week but sometime in
