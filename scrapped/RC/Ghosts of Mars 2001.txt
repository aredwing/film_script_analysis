can you get us in can try The plan was simple Sergeant Jericho the science officer and jumped off the train and headed towards the powerplant The others stayed aboard the train as it backed into the station The idea was they provide cover and distract the Martians as we set the charges in the plant And theyd swing back pick us up and wed all get as far away from Shining Canyon as we could before the place blew Like said it was a simple plan The only problem was it didnt work the way it was supposed to How are you doingJericho m working on it Hurry up Weve got to remove the waterjacket and
