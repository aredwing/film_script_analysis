southern Burma a small minority has been oppressed for years by military junta The Karen People Three years ago General Kyaw Min and his men destroyed the village of Kay Pu The villagers were massacred raped and deported Few lucky ones fled into the jungle The general led the operation personally The village was located on a nickel deposit which is why a multinational corporation pays millions of dollars to General Kyaw Min to clear the village of its inhabitants The money for this operation came from the Pandora account which suspect your father Nario Winch of owning My father was no saint but he wasnt a bastard You were in Burma How long did you spend there Five months Thats right You left three years ago right after the Kay Pu massacre suspect you of going there on your fathers order also suspect you of being an accomplice of this massacre The last contact had with my father was more than three years before he died Someone has informed you And your being there was a

Mr Largo Winch in complicity with crimes against humanity This latest turn of events comes on the back of rumors that the Winch Group will be bought out by magnate Virgil Nazatchov The highly controversial businessman seems to have found the funds necessary for the operation Youve never seen a kid Lets go want this son of the bitch ll find the tapes of the security cameras He came in with his bodyguards couldnt do anything What the hell are you doing here that Winchs decision to sell the group was made prior to his legal troubles Shares have fallen since the charge against Winch and

Think of what hed do with such power You have a responsibility He won Gauthier signed a sales agreement he paid Theres no turning back Do you know the legend of Pandora Zeus gave Epimetheus a gift Pandora the first woman on Earth She possessed a box which Zeus forbade her to open but one day her curiosity got the best of her And she opened the lid The evils of humanity escaped and flooded the Earth old age disease deceit and insanity Terrified Pandora quickly shut the box Fortunately for it was not entirely empty One precious little thing remained at the bottom of the box Hope And from that day onward though Man might be stricken by great misfortune deep inside there always remains a glimmer of hope You cannot lose hope sir Not as long as youre alive What is your password Pandora

have stock in the Winch Company Not yet But was planning on getting some not out of my price range We found the guy who received the Not my type Dragan Lazarevic former member of the Serb special forces during the Balkan war after the war went into private security quite successfully judging from his reputation Nice credentials wanna know everything hes done in the last month dont know about the last month but as we speak hes on his way to Geneva Hell be landing in one hour Yes Speaking Thank you The pilots were found in their hotel room Tied up Geneva tower Winch Air Quebec Zulu Radar guidance on Runway Were beginning our descent If you only knew how happy this makes me Nazatchov has transferred more than to Dragan Lazarevic over the past three months Looks like Lazarevic is working for Nazatchov But why did Winch send the guy dollars To get our attention ll kill you you sonofabitch Take over the plane Stop it They just made all men dead Not in the airplane Very dangerous Lets see Simon Hang on tight You alright No problem Where are you Yes of course ll send my driver Where exactly are you Hello Passports please You always travel armed like this Those are all his men alright But Dragan Lazarevic is not here ll accompany the police for questioning Keep me posted The nurse will be right down Alexandre Jung Welcome Simon Ovronnaz Mr Winch refused to come with us He wanted to see the prosecutor And you let him Thats insane You dont realize the woman is dangerous Hello You work at night Winch hope its all on my account know youre in Geneva My Lord The dollar bank transfer to Lazarevic is very clever Clever was expecting your attention for detail But m wrong In any case you are right about one thing You got a lot of enemies In our country there is a saying that goes man with no enemy is no man at all Hows that coffee have something important to ask you Will you see me Third floor Ring the bell Get in was worried No need ll explain everything to Francken Nazatchov is a fool How could he mastermind such a scheme Even fools have strokes of genius Perhaps But how did he know what happened in Burma three years ago He had an informer someone inside the group ll come with you Youre an angel My leg barely hurts anymore One last drop Thanks What if Nazatchov were simply the financier of the operation What if someone else were hiding behind him To dream up a plot like that you need motivation that goes beyond the lure of gain You need a raging desire to humiliate to utterly destroy and bring down a reputation a name an empire Money alone cannot be the driving force This was vengeance Hatred My son was a lobbyist for Nerio Thomas Thomas Jung He used my personal contacts to help the Group win new markets and concessions Nerio never balked at paying bribes Thats what Pandora was for Each time he won a contract Nerio paid my son Thomas a commission But all that money went to his head He wanted more and more When saw you for the first time so young so handsome and rich so completely alive was approaching death but you gave me a reason to live Vengeance Nazatchov is an idiot He merely obeys and pays Tonight you shall kill Prosecutor Francken The only person who can prove your innocence Give him another shot There are more vials in the car Do what tell you Sugar Here Call the police fast Alexandre Dont do it did the same begged Nerio to save my son All he had to do was pay swear to you Largo begged him on my knees My oldest friend My brother On my knees Stop Dont come any closer Your son had become a piece of shit and you know it He ordered the massacre in Burma He was my child Still have to arrest me d rather invite you for dinner My treat heard you have tapped out Maybe not Depend upon you In light of these circumstances there could be no doubt that Mr Largo Winch is innocent immediately withdraw all charges against him for complicity in crimes against humanity Within minutes the Group shares soared back up to their previous levels As a direct impact rumor has it that Virgil Nazatchov will no longer be able to buy out the Winch Group Today Nazatchov was a ruined man in addition no doubt proceedings will soon be brought against him Forgive me for shedding no tears But Mr Cochrane what would become of the billiondollar deposit that Nazatchov has paid Largo Winch has decided to turn this money over in full to his foundation That like is there any need to sell the group You have to ask Largo Winch Well do you know where Largo Winch is right now He is right where he is about to be trust him Are the chicks pretty in Hong Kong beg your pardon The girls Hong Kong Largo invited me to spend some time there Jesus Mary and Joseph Jesus Mary and Joseph Want some Phat Thai You and are gonna make a great team What do you say pal m not your pal You will be soon Ready to go No Well come back whenever you like live on a big boat you know No dont know Its surrounded by tall houses that touch the sky
