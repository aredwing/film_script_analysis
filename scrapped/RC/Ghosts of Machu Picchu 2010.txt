High in the Peruvian Andes theres an ancient city called Machu Picchu lt is a ruin that defies explanation Who were the mysterious people who built it and why did they build it here With no defensive wall it doesnt look like a fortress instead there are fountains and small pools temples and strange altars cut from granite but little else to explain how a people who didnt have iron tools or the wheel could have created such a masterpieceand why Now new research is solving these mysteries in the bodies and bones of the people who once lived here To me this is the type of injury more indicative of a weapon possibly of warfare There are clues far below the city and underneath it and in the stories of the mummies of kings Will all these revelations finally lay the ghosts of Machu Picchu to rest Perched at meters on a narrow ridge in the high Andes Machu Picchu is a remote and mysterious ancient wonder Spread across the top of this ridge are more than structures each built with exquisitely cut stone Some appear to be homesothers temples They surround a hectare green and all are fed by open waterways and fountains It is a lost city whose doorways and passages hint at the ghosts of its past place that is at once beautiful and baffling There are no written clues in the city no carvings to suggest a purpose At its highest point the mystery only deepens There a beautifully carved pillar stands a graceful riddle to cap the site From this lofty height the views leave one stunned but also curious How did the builders get all this stone up here and then cut it so finely that they didnt even need mortar to hold their walls in place Who built Machu Picchu And why did they build it in this impossible place Even more perplexing why did they abandon it Throughout the city stones seemed to be on the verge of being placed when work came to a stop Now as never before clues are emerging Some at the site itself in new excavations Others at the lower reaches of Machu Picchu as teams explore them for the very first time These mysteries have long obsessed Fernando Astete director of the Machu Picchu Archaeological Park There is such an important cultural legacy here not just for Peruvians but a legacy forthe entire world Making sense of that legacy is Astetes challengealong with getting to work He has one of the most precarious commutes of anyone on the planet His path was built by a people who were surefooted with little fear of heights the Inca They rose to power in the mids in part because they built such good roads Much of their kilometer network is still visible today They left other evidence that they were master engineers and builders Their terraces canals and stone cities rival those of ancient Rome But unlike the ancient Romans they did all of this without the wheel without iron and without a written language The Inca did have a calculating system using knotted strings called khipu but it left no record of their lives or their history So much of what we do know comes from the Spanish who conquered them in the s These accounts carry the bias of conquerors different view comes from an Inca artist named Guaman Poma Poma was born shortly after the Spanish arrived in Peru so he was an observer who bridged both worlds He produced hundreds of simple drawings about farming techniques royalty and the Inca history of conquest From both these sources we know the Inca were fierce warriors who subjugated dozens of different peoples forging them into one of the largest empires in the world stretching some kilometers They fed their people by transforming steep slopes into farmland with the rise and run of terracing Its believed that more land was under cultivation during Inca times than is today in modern Peru But the most surprising detail about the Inca is that they ruled for only years Then their empire was decimated first by disease then civil war finally the Spanish Conquistadors From the Spanish we know that the last Inca emperor retreated into the mountains to a city called Vilcabamba The Inca held out at Vilcabamba for years until finally in the Spanish destroyed the city Strangely they left no written record of where it was located and the legend of the lost city of Vilcabamba was born It was a mystery that had powerful allure Almost years later it pulled an American explorer named Hiram Bingham here on a quest to find it On the morning of July Bingham camera at the ready reached the top of a ridge and stepped into history lt fairly took my breath away he later wrote Binghams photos marked one of the first times that a moment of discovery had been captured on film Today those pictures are part of a rare volume explorers album detailing Binghams discovery But what exactly had he found He called it by its local name Machu Picchu but he thought it was the lost city of Vilcabamba year later when his team discovered over burials Bingham believed hed found the evidence to make his case After thorough examination Bingham and his bone expert Dr George Eaton reached an astonishing conclusion percent of the dead were women Eatons data gave a sex ratio of to times as many females as males Four to one really would be a tremendous bias and think thats what got Eaton excited He thought My God theyre almost all women What could explain a predominantly female cemetery Bingham thought hed found the remains Of the socalled Virgins of the Sun According to Spanish accounts the most beautiful girls in the empire were chosen for this sacred convent Selected around the age of eight these virgins served the Inca emperor for the rest of their lives Bingham guessed that when the last Inca king retreated into the mountains to escape the Spanish he took his sacred virgins with him So it all added up The skeletons of the virgins confirmed that this spectacular city in the sky had to be Vilcabamba Clearly for him it created a great magical romantic kind of picture that that made good book reading When published in the April issue of National Geographic the story was an overnight sensation Bingham became a star The only problem was that the theory was wrong Investigations of other Inca ruins revealed that the Spanish desecrated almost every Inca holy site they could find At Machu Picchu the entire city remained untouched But the most convincing evidence against Binghams theory was in the very bones he had found at the site When forensic anthropologist John Verano reexamined them he found that the sex of the skeletons was almost evenly split a far cry from Eatons to ratio To figure out the sex of a skeleton you have to compare it across many ethnic and racial groups Eatons references were limited to people of European or African descent People in the Andes are are relatively short delicately built And can only guess that what he was looking at was bone size and he said this looks like a small person therefore its female In Binghams collection Verano also found the bones of several children and children and virgins just didnt add up just cant find evidence to support that idea that these were virgins of the sun think that that can be pretty well ruled out Without the virgins or any sign of Spanish desecration there was no proof to support Binghams theory that this was Vilcabamba So what was it With so few written records archeologists like Fernando Astete must piece together clues about Machu Picchus history wherever they can find them And he thinks hes just found one in a nearby town called Patallacta Patallacta was important because it supplied the food for all the people living at Machu Picchu Patallacta is a few hours walk from Machu Picchu along the main Inca trail through the region lt is the closest place to Machu Picchu where largescale farming could have taken place The people who lived at Patallacta werent just farmers though they likely played many rolesthey could have been stoneworkers builders laborers Astetes best hope for understanding Machu Picchu is to learn about the people who lived here the possible builders of the city Above the old Inca town up a nearly vertical slope a local guide has found what looks like a burial niche Astete and fellow archaeologist Elva Torres believe it may be undisturbed a gravesite last touched years ago Hey whats up And the tomb Its sealed We need to open it Before the tomb can be opened Astetes Quechua guide makes an offering of coca leaves to the spirits that dwell here just as his Inca forbearers would have done Pass it to me pass it to me Be careful so the others dont fall Astete and Torres have investigated many other burials in the area Most are far more accessible This tombhas been constructed The other tombs dont use this style Theyre simply in caves in natural rock formations that are easy to get to Do you see anything No its very dark In the dim tomb light a human skull Yes see a skull So theres a skull and lots of bones Be careful dont step on anything As Torres enters the cramped tomb the find only gets more tantalizing It appears theres a couple of individuals But as she investigates she finds a lot more skeletonsnine in all And many show signs of injury Well this problem regarding fractures they could be from everyday activities They could have been from a fall something may have fallen on them or perhaps some other sort of activity In this case they may have been working in the quarries Could these be the skeletons Of the builders of Machu Picchu They cant be sure until they take a closer look in the lab There Torres is joined by bioarcheologist Valerie Andrushko Right away they find some surprises in the skulls from Patallacta Theyre full of holes Its the sign of a procedure called trepanation Trepanation is the partial removal of part ofthe skull that the Inca practiced with very high degrees of success Our understanding is that trepanation was often done in order to release intracranial pressure due to fractures Its skull surgery and healed wounds found throughout the empire show that the Inca were skilled at using it to treat head trauma When we see evidence for trauma the question is always is it related to accidents or is related to violence This individual right here this is a complete fracture of the frontal bone It has perforated all the way to the frontal sinus This type of injury is not the type of injury that one would get from an accidental fall To me this is the type of injury more indicative of a weapon type injury possibly indicative of warfare In fact several skulls from the tombs show signs of blunt force trauma the type of fracture youd get from a club So these werent builders they were likely warriors Possibly these individuals may have been engaged in defense of the sites around them possibly engaged in the defense of Machu Picchu This revelation stands in stark contrast to the appearance of Machu Picchu as a religious sanctuary This is a city dominated by sacred temples and shrines The Temple of the Three Windows The Temple of the Condor named for its carved floor and stone wings The elegantly curved Temple of the Sun built on a rock that is illuminated on the solstice And at the highest point in the city a stone pillar known as the Intihuatana The evidence seems to be in conflict was Machu Picchu a military fortress orwas it a religious center The answer can perhaps be found in the ancient capital of Cusco where the descendants of the Inca still live Every year during the Roman Catholic festival of Corpus Christi statues of the Virgin Mary along with other saints are removed from the cathedral and brought to the square These performers may be paying homage to Christian saints but the instruments they play and the steps they move to are actually Inca in origin Thats because this Corpus Christi procession is a Christian revision of an Inca ritual Five hundred years ago the Inca also processed through Cusco But they didnt carry statues of saints They carried the mummies of their kings whom they revered as gods It was likely one of these kings who built Machu Picchu The quality of the stonework alone suggests the city was royal Fernando Astete estimates that it would have taken at least years to complete Since the Inca Empire only lasted years focus has been on the earliest kings The accounts of a Spanish Jesuit named Bernabe Cobo point to a dynamic leader who founded the Inca Empire a king named Pachacuti But no one could ever prove that Pachacuti built Machu Picchu small clue was hidden in his name which means He who remakes the world Pachacuti was sort of the Alexander the Great of the Incas He was the one who started the expansion out of the Cusco region and the Inca Empire began to expand tremendously over areas that had never been conquered by the Incas before What we know of Pachacutis history is due in part to Father Cobo Cobo arrived in Peru after the conquest in the late s and wrote his account based on interviews with descendants of the Inca According to Father Cobo Pachacuti was renowned as a builder Having enlarged his empire with so many and such vast provinces during the remainder of his life this king devoted himself to building magnificent temples and palaces and strong castles The beautiful stonework at Machu Picchu so similar in style to Pachacutis temples in other Inca cities suggests that the same hand was behind the structures here But the most convincing evidence linking Pachacuti to Machu Picchu comes from a Spanish register held in the Colonial Archives in Cusco Dated it mentions the town of Picchu with a clear reference to its owner Inca Yupanqui also known as Pachacuti The evidence is convincing It is Pachacuti the first Inca emperor who ordered Machu Picchus construction and in a place that would give any engineer pause If was called in by Pachacuti and ordered to build Machu Picchu at that particular location wouldve gulped Engineering wise it would seem almost impossible to handle Fifteen years of study by hydrologist Ken Wright and a team of engineers is revealing how the Inca pulled this off because the steepness of the site isnt the only problem Machu Picchu also receives torrential rains each year triggering frequent landslides And the site is crossed by not one but two earthquake fault lines making it a terrible place on which to build a city of stone The location does have two virtues a nearby fresh water spring and a supply of granite theres a quarry right on the site When the Inca engineers turned to building their first step would have been to shore up the mountain They did it by constructing a remarkable bulwark of terraces As Astetes team rappels further down the cliff face they are discovering hundreds of new terraces hidden below Usually when people refer to Machu Picchu theyre only thinking about the Inca buildings on top of the ridge But construction has to begin at the bottom In other words you have to start with the terraces Terraces are fundamental to Machu Picchu While some terraces would have been used for smallscale farming their primary purpose was to hold the mountain in place while draining a huge volume of rainwater away That averages about inches per year and in terms of lets say Middle America thats a lot of water roughly two and halftimes as much as the city of Chicago would get Left unmanaged that rainwater would turn the hillsides to mud and Machu Picchu would slide away The Inca avoided that by creating a sophisticated drainage system Inside the terraces archaeologists found a layer of rich topsoil Under that a layer of sandy dirt and finally gravel and larger stones We could say that they are filtering galleries meaning even when you get a lot of rain the terraces never flood because the water is filtered through these progressive layers of material Instead of racing down the mountain the water slowly works its way into the ground so theres almost no erosion With this basic design in hand the Inca fixed the first terrace into the mountain then started on the next replicating their way to the top Once there Inca engineers had to reckon with an even bigger water problem This is a city paved with stone with few places for rainwater to go But the Inca had foreseen that problem and during construction carefully placed more than a hundred drains throughout the city Many of these drains delivered the runoff from the elevated parts of the city into the central plaza Further digging there revealed a remarkable innovation to handle all of that water Beneath the usual layers of topsoil and gravelly dirt Wrights team hit a thick layer of white granite chips the spoil from years of Inca stone cutting In effect what the Inca did was to build an underground drainage system a type of conduit to carry water safely away These were colossal earthworks extending nearly meters below the surface and encompassing several hectares They collected water and shunted it away from the city The Inca engineers spent about percent maybe percent over their overall effort underground doing foundations site preparation to make sure that Machu Picchu would last forever So as vast as the city appears theres percent more of it underground holding it all in place While the lnca went to great lengths to get rid of water they also built fountains which seem to celebrate it There are fountains in the city each beautifully designed and a practical source of drinking water The fountains are fed by a natural spring found nearby on the flanks of Machu Picchu Mountain From there the Inca engineered a canal whose percent grade was carefully crafted to deliver just the right amount of water to the fountains Wright calculated the flow to be between and liters per minute depending on the time of year enough to sustain a population of close to a thousand people It was remarkable it was something that created great respect by us for the Inca engineers all those years ago It is a respect also shared by Astetes team as they restore the Incas original stonework In spite of their lack of iron tools the Inca were somehow able to transform granite a notoriously hard stone Theres a clue to how they did this in Machu Picchus quarry We see here the basic method the Inca used to cut rocks The idea is to create a neck in the block and then cause it to fracture It was bonejarring work The technique the Inca used was direct hammering With the rough blocks theyd start with a large tool like this one As you can seeit sheers very easily Then theyd gradually use the smaller and harder tools to give it that strong smooth surface Once the cutters had roughed it out they put the stone on log rollers or mud and pulled it close to the construction site The final step was to move the stone into place and match it to its mate And here is the indentation they made which matches the edge of the rock below it Its held up by this wedge until they shape the two surfaces to match Then the wedge is removed and the two stones fit together perfectly Here you can seethe brace points they used to push the block up into place They put beams here to lift the rock up Once the rock was in place these points were beaten just as you see here and here in all these other rocks That means that the finishing work was done at the site We can see that this corner wasnt finished yet All this portion was yet to be cut off in order to finish the wall Driven by a royal mandate to build it here Machu Picchu is a tribute to Inca engineering and artistry Its hundreds of terraces buttress it from below The granite walls are still solid after years because of a remarkable drainage system And it is crowned by an ingenious lacework of fountains cascading from the mountain spring above But why go to all this effort Why did Pachacuti order Machu Picchu built in this forbidding place was it for religious reasons What we know of Inca religion comes again from the chronicles of Father Bernabe Cobo written after the Spanish Conquest They worship with equal reverence and with the same ceremonial services the sun water earth and many other things that they held to be divine The Inca believed that the sun and the mountains were deities that had to be appeased through ritual Cobo reported that one of these rituals was child sacrifice This claim was dramatically confirmed in by high altitude archaeologist Johan Reinhard Then Reinhard discovered three perfectly preserved child mummies on a high peak in Argentina in the southern part of the Inca Empire They had been sacrificed as an offering to the same mountain gods Cobo described Perhaps the mystery of Machu Picchus location can be explained by this reverence for the landscape We know that throughout the Andes that people believed that the natural environment has sacred aspects to it These landscape features at Machu Picchuhave helped explain what otherwise is a tremendous mystery This idea called the sacred landscape theory suggests that in addition to worshipping the sun rivers and mountains as gods the Inca derived power by being physically connected to them So is that why Machu Picchu was here Machu Picchu is an unusual place to build even for the Inca Their capital now modernday Cusco and other Inca towns like Pisac are in flatter more accessible terrain Its also remotea fiveday walk from the capital in Inca times and today it takes tourists four hours by train followed by a harrowing bus ride up to the ruins But throughout the site are hints why the Inca thought that this place was worth the trouble In certain places the Inca carved stones in the shape of sacred peaks surrounding the city then displayed them like massive holy icons Even Bingham was struck by stones like this onecalled the Sacred Rock that mirrors the outline of Mount Yanantin directly to the northeast In Inca times visitors would approach Machu Picchu from above where they could see the city is surrounded by the holy Urubamba River For an agricultural people there was nothing more important than water and here was a place firmly in the waters embrace There is one more piece of evidence connecting Machu Picchu to the sacred landscape At the top of a pyramid shaped peak within the complex is the sacred pillar known as the Intihuatana This sacred pillar is in alignment with four mountain gods of supreme importance to the Inca according to Johann Reinhard The Intihuatana is situated such that its at a high point in the center of the entire complex But at the same time its the center of this massive landscape because you have in the far distance these great snowcapped peaks The highest ones in the entire region They also happen to correspond to the cardinal directions Its views to sacred peaks proximity to the holy river and the alignment with four powerful mountain gods must have made this location irresistible to the Inca But how did the first Inca emperor Pachacuti actually use Machu Picchu Within the city there was a distinctive royal residence lt is located near the first fountain insuring that the king would have the purest water to drink Its also close to the holiest temples But whether the city was Pachacutis royal court a religious center or a military post remains a mystery reanalysis of the skeletons that Hiram Bingham found suggests a possible solution During Binghams excavation in his team mistakenly identified these skeletons as the virgins of the sun Recently theyve been reexamined If we could identify who these people were it might explain how Machu Picchu was used During his study anthropologist John Verano found no evidence of violent injury so these werent soldiers He also confirmed that their burials had been simple with no high value artifacts That meant they werent royalty In their bones Verano found hints that they werent common laborers either Instead they were from a class of people in between didnt see a lot of arthritis even in the older adults at Machu Picchu and that again made me think these are not people working really hard in the with say stone masonry or dragging rocks up the hills critical clue to their identity can be found in their dietthrough a technique called isotopic analysis ln this process scientists vaporize a small sample of bone They are looking for the chemical traces of the foods that have been absorbed into its structure Among the vaporized particles they found a high percentage of carbon isotopes which is the signature of corn Though its common in Peru today in Inca times corn was a royal food In fact pollen analysis of the soils from the hundreds of terraces here shows that the little food grown at the site was primarily corn And as John Verano found corn leaves another signature Corn is rich in carbohydrates Its not good for your teeth So they had a lot of cavities they had a lot of abscesses a lot of tooth loss So although they werent royals these people frequently helped themselves to the royal corn They also didnt do a lot of heavy labor So what were they doing here In some ways guess you could see it as a big hotel staff The caretakers and servants of the estate This was a large staffVerano ultimately identified the remains of individuals The evidence is strong that Machu Picchu was a royal estate for the emperor Pachacuti This would have been a peaceful retreat where he and his courtiers would have come to rest worship and enjoy themselves their needs tended to by welltrained royal servants And you can kind of imagine an entourage of the royalty coming from Cuzco along the road and everybody at Machu Picchu saying whoops Lets get it ready clean it up and get food and so on and welcome our guests But the new finds from the tombs at the nearby farming center of Patallacta dont seem to fit with this peaceful picture The severe injuries in those skeletons suggest that Machu Picchu may have been connected to warfare So how could Machu Picchu be a place of both war and peace According to Spanish accounts the Inca conquered this valley about a decade after Pachacuti came to power So perhaps he built it as a way to seal his conquest Incas were very skilled in psychological warfare and they decide to build this magnificent estate on the hilltop that everybody living up and down that valley is going to see from the first thing they walk outside their door to the last thing that they go to bed at night Thats a very powerful thing Its a message of conquest and of possession that they own that land and they control the people who live within it So Machu Picchu was a formidable symbol of Inca power a spectacular boast by Pachacuti not just of their engineering prowess but of their paramount link to the sacred mountains and rivers Still if this place played such a critical role in demonstrating the religious and military power of the Inca why didnt the Spanish deface it as they did to other sacred Inca sites And why isnt it ever described in any Spanish accounts Part of the answer lies in the Corpus Christi procession back in Cusco the annual festival that is a Christian revision of an Inca ritual In that ritual the Inca carried mummies instead of saints especially the mummies of their kings When Pachacuti died in he wasnt buried he was mummified The exact process is unknown One theory suggests his body would have been gradually freezedried left out in the searing sun by day and alternately frozen at night Through this repeated heating freezing and thawing the corpse would have become completely desiccated Curiously this is similar to how the local Quetchua people preserve llama meat The result is jerky which is one of the few Quetchua words used in English Once preserved Pachacuti would not have been entombed Instead he would have continued to play an active role in the politics and rituals of the Inca world Drawings made by the Incan artist Guaman Poma confirm the use of mummies in this way We dont actually have a mummy of an Inca emperor but we have descriptions of them and we know that they were taken out during major festivals and paraded We know that they had attendants who would shoo away the flies and give offerings every day food offerings and drink to the mummies In other words they were worshipped and believed to still play a role in the community Care and handling of the mummy would have fallen to a group of family members called the panaca who also took control of all the kings royal estates But over time even Pachacutis panaca could have run short of resources Work at Machu Picchu may have slowed then stopped altogether The descendants of Pachacuti had more pressing concerns Even before the Spanish Conquest small pox came It was followed by a bloody civil war that left the Inca Empire weakened and fragmented Barely years after Pachacuti died the Inca Empire finally collapsed under the Spanish invasion When the royal families were had lost their power they were disorganized There was civil war There was massive destruction of sites And the people at Machu Picchu probably at some point just said Well nobody is coming to visit and the site really had no reason to exist at that point By then it is likely that all but the loyal servants had forgotten Machu Picchu And after time even they probably just drifted away So the Spanish probably never heard about Machu Picchu and more importantly never found it It was for us the luckiest mistake It meant that Machu Picchu was left untouched one of the only major Inca sites to remain in tact While it still poses confounding mysteries it also holds great promise as new technologies and finds allow us to come to terms with the ghosts of Machu Picchu
