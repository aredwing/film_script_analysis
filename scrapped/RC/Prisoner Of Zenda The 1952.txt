Highness And now may offer you my congratulations shade premature but thank you Detchard Gentlemen its time for you to proceed to your posts The hour is almost upon us We go in the cause of our country and our future sovereign Our future sovereign Queen Flavia He looked at you when he said our future sovereign Have you been lying to me Michael Is it more than the regency you want No of course not As regent the sovereign power will be mine Thats all he meant Was it Is power all you want m afraid Michael For me or for yourself You promised to make me your wife want to be your wife want to love you and make you happy Once you are regent they would never let you marry me Michael take the happiness we can have together Leave the power to your brother No ve played second fiddle to that drunken sot for the last time His mother was a princess and mine was not so he lived in the royal palace he dined with kings Well today the feast is set for Rudolf But its Michael who will sit in his place Come in Count Rupert of Hentzau at your service Your Majesty m sorry to interrupt you Your Majesty Hentzau Your Highness Your wit is as inopportune as your appearance Why are you not at your post How can witness the coronation of a king who will be conspicuous by his absence Do we want to make it obvious we knew he would not be there Incidentally the burgomaster of Zenda is outside to pay his respects at the head of a delegation of loyal peasants told them you were probably too busy to see them as of course you are There may come a time Hentzau when your services will no longer excuse your impertinence called at your hotel again this morning and as usual they said you were out Curiously enough you were out for once m glad you stopped lying to me hate being lied to by women They never did before always lied to them You and will never have anything to lie to each other about Never Somebody once called fidelity the fading womans greatest weapon the charming womans greatest hypocrisy And youre very charming to anyone whose head is not bowed beneath a borrowed crown thought heard His Highness order you to your place at the cathedral So youre trying to put me in my place too love arrogance in a woman Its always so amusing to discover that their arrogance is only a defense But you need no defense against me You and are allies Michael is plotting to betray us both Poor Michael how he shortchanges himself deserting a warm exciting woman of the world for an insipid wax doll That was hardly up to your usual standard Count Rupert d heard you were much more subtle What makes you think Michael has any intention of marrying Princess Flavia How else can he get the crown He doesnt want the crown As those in his confidence know He wants only to be regent Hes made you think he only wants to be the man behind the throne No He wants to sit on it And sit on it he never can unless he sits beside the rightful queen And that queen is not you Even though youd make a perfect queen m glad you believe me at last told you we were allies can even help you to win him back m the only man who can because m the only man who isnt afraid of him All you have to do is to give him genuine cause to be jealous of me Would that be hard Rudolf with justice and mercy to deal sovereignty To guard with vigilance and honor the welfare of my peoples from all enemies No no Dont tell me From all enemies to defend them and from the throne of my ancestors to bear faithful rule all this do swear little swift but youll do Stop shaking lad Theyll mistake it for a royal hangover Now let me see Were all right till the cathedral The princess hasnt seen him for several years But Michael Yeah Well ve told you all can ll be at your side every minute Your capital Your Majesty God save the king God save the king God save them both Steady lad Its the day the hour almost the moment History is born out of a bottle of wine The king His Majesty has arrived Your Highness The king Hows it possible Ride back to Zenda at once Find out who betrayed us If only hed drunk what wanted to put in that bottle Look now upon our liege lord Rudolf undoubted king of this realm And if any man would deny our sovereign lords title to our lands and fealty let him speak now or be attainted traitor Receive the crown of the kingdom and understand what a glory of sanctity and honor and bravery it signifies God save the king God save the king God save the king God save the king God save the king Rudolf with justice and mercy to deal sovereignty to guard with vigilance and honor the welfare of my peoples from all enemies to defend them and from the throne of my ancestors to bear faithful rule all this do swear Flavia do become thy vassal swearing to serve thee in truth with life and limb until death findeth me so help me God Do kiss her Yes Well think everything went off very well dont you for a coronation mean that is not that a coronation shouldnt go well provided the king puts in an appearance suitably dressed and suitably rehearsed And suitably sober And suitably sober Yes was hoping youd notice that By the way among my other failings ve rather neglected you havent Two picture post cards in three years think To think all this time youve been changing into the loveliest princess in Europe No the loveliest girl in Europe Your new responsibilities do not compel you to shower me with compliments in private You call this private m glad you think ve changed since you last saw me Youre different too Well wouldnt anybody seem different with all this going on probably looked like a prize idiot and talked like one too Youre too modest You really looked and acted like a king today Oh thank you It was delightfully unexpected Arent you forgetting something What Thats better Wait ve got an idea Supposing you bow on my side of this goldfish bowl and ll salute on yours Like that There isnt that more cozy They seem to like that Bless them Theyre with you heart and soul Me It was you they were cheering felt like cheering you too when first saw you Everyones waiting Oh no please Dont go yet Its such a relief to have you to myself for a moment All day long ve been on parade Cheered at waved at stared at Not a moment to tell you Tell me what Its enough to turn any mans head a bit m crowned king meet the loveliest the most beautiful woman That isnt what you used to say You used to call me that clumsy little scarecrow did Yes shouldve been horsewhipped Those were my very words Once kicked you quite hard Good m sure deserved it But hope you never find it necessary to kick me again You know youve changed beyond all recognition Its almost impossible to believe that anybody could change so much And so quickly Well it must be that you bring out the best in people No Youve become an entirely different person Theyre waiting for us We really must go Must we Another thing always wanted to know is the world outside really as wicked and exciting as the novels make out What did you do on those long trips When you werent drinking mean Well when wasnt drinking used to go fishing Fishing You used to despise fishing Well did and didnt if you follow me Have you ever done any trout fishing No and you know why Oh do asked you to teach me You sent me home made too many mistakes and scared the fish But once you really hurt me Youve forgotten havent you wish you had too It was my th birthday party had my first formal dress thought was quite grown up You were to be the guest of honor wanted to show you that the ugly duckling had become a swan And what did do At the end when everyone had gone home and you still hadnt come hated you m beginning to hate myself Yes Well His Highness Prince Michael is waiting to pay his respects to you Your Majesty Well let him wait And furthermore Captain von Tarlenheim find your intrusion excessively irregular Rudolf its not wise to provoke Michael deliberately Oh why not Why be worried about him m not m worried about you Well thats a different matter altogether We cant allow that Will you excuse me My dear Michael had no idea youd been kept waiting Why was not informed of my brothers presence will not tolerate such inefficiency again gentlemen This is indeed a privilege worth being kept waiting for cousin Its most kind of you to say so cousin You know brother this was a day d really been dreading had a queer feeling that something might go wrong But with you in charge my fears were foolish werent they can hardly thank you enough for arranging my affairs Its gratifying to find Your Majesty in such excellent spirits after the strain of the day ve never felt so fit in my life It must be the excitement Its the first time ve ever been crowned you know Yeah thats rather funny Dont you think so brother Very funny indeed Yeah Theres another reason feel so well had an extraordinary native wine last night Soothed my nerves slept like a top This one comes from very near your castle You really ought to try it sometime if ever youre troubled with insomnia very seldom suffer with insomnia Indeed That shows what a very clear conscience you must have have have yet to have a dream that did not come true provided waited long enough Yes of course Everything comes to him who waits see bore Your Majesty With Your Majestys permission bid you good night Rudolf do be careful You know how bitterly he hates you Well now he knows how bitterly hate him You still cant afford to make an open enemy of him Hed stop at nothing even now to ruin you Oh youre overestimating him Or perhaps youre underestimating me Rudolf if you wont think of yourself think of me All my life ve known what my future had to be and was resigned to it But now Now dont have to tell you how different it is Flavia forgive me had no idea that you might That would l only want you to realize how much your life means to To your country To my country And to your friends My friends And to your cousin and most loving servant What else matters Good night Rudolf No dont go Not yet Stay a little longer But youll be seeing me every day from now on You may even get tired of me Good night No Goodbye Flavia What a day for you to remember ll never forget old Mueller at the cathedral He used to be the kings tutor He fixed his eye on you and he never took it off was certain the game was up until realized that eye was his glass one By the way Rassendyll what were you doing with the princess all that time Cant you even leave the king to do his own lovemaking Thats enough of that Are you ready to go Rassendyll We must leave at once if m to have His Majesty back here by daylight If anybody comes to see the king youre to say hes asleep Yes sir If its Michael and that doesnt stop him Thatd be awkward So awkward that if that doors forced youre not to be alive to tell about it Do you think would be sir Good lad Come on Rassendyll m not much good at speechmaking Well we dont need one do we Well you know what mean Yeah think do old man We have no time for sentiment In a few hours time ll be plain Rudolf Rassendyll again Youll be lucky if youre not the late Rudolf Rassendyll Happy thought feel my head wobbling every minute youre in the city In the old kings time we used this more often than any other door in the palace It saved many a royal head and many a royal reputation Yes come on No lights eh Thats odd Josef Josef Josef Thank you Locked Here take this The king Look Kidnapped Or murdered Michaels been in Strelsau all day Still is Yes but that young devil Hentzau isnt wondered why hadnt seen him all day That settles it Now they know everything Yes they know everything but they cant speak They cant denounce us without denouncing themselves Can they say That wasnt the king because we kidnapped the king and murdered his servant Can they say that No But that wont prevent them murdering the king With you in Strelsau they wont dare If they do theyre finished Can they kill him and leave you on the throne No youre asking too much No man could carry on this masquerade indefinitely ve done everything can to help but Yes suppose youre right Youve done everything that could be expected More than could be expected Its just that Rudolf is my king have a feeling about the crown suppose feel about it as another man might feel about the woman he loved He wouldnt like to leave her to her fate without even a fight What will happen to her now Princess Flavia Yes If the king has been murdered Michael as regent will proclaim her queen And then marry her Shed never submit to that Flavia is a princess of the royal house Shed have no choice She would expect none And will you stand by and let that happen to her Will you His Majesty the king Your Majesty Oh m delighted to see you Rudolf are you worried about something Worried With you in my arms was thinking therell never be another night like this or another waltz like this ll never forget tonight as long as live if thats what you mean Nor will Do you have to dance with anybody else tonight dance only as my king commands Well then your king commands that Why do they all stop You know the rule Because we do And you mean that if we start theyll go on Of course If we go out on the terrace will they come out too Of course not Well then Lets go out on the terrace Oh not now Later Later That is if we can slip away Oh no want that promise Come we must dance Not a step until get that promise promise The British ambassador newly appointed Do you know him Yes Let us trust in Providence Youll never get Providence interested in this enterprise Your Majesty Your Royal Highness His Excellency the British Ambassador and Lady Topham Your Excellencies Your Majesty Her Britannic Majesty the Queen Empress commands me to convey her felicitations upon your coronation Be pleased to convey our thanks to Her Majesty You may also add our felicitations upon her jubilee Your Majesty would it be premature to congratulate you upon Your Majestys approaching wedding Well yes it might be Rudolf we should pay our respects to His Eminence the Cardinal Amazing resemblance to the younger Rassendyll Not the slightest Your Eminence has greatly honored us tonight Your Majestys subjects already love their king think theyre impatient to love their queen as well m grateful for the interest of the people and of Your Eminence Graciously answered And now the preparations for the ceremony of necessity are going to be many and elaborate Would it please Your Majesty to name the date Now Tonight It was understood that the ceremony would shortly follow the coronation Well shall we say in six months time So long a postponement Your Eminence theres an old proverb which councils us against crossing bridges before we come to them If Your Majesty would examine that proverb think you would find it very difficult to cross a bridge at any other time Well m sure my cousin will understand Your cousin begs leave to bid Your Majesty and Your Eminence good night Good night my child If you will excuse us Your Eminence Flavia you promised to go out on the terrace with me Is that a command Your Majesty Thats a command but a very humble one Why did you ask me out here couldnt let you go home while you were still angry m sure you had excellent reasons for what you said Oh believe me have There are times when a man might find it impossible to do even what his heart prompts him to do But never could willingly do anything to hurt you How can believe you when dont even understand you Then will you believe this without understanding love you Oh is it true Or do you say that because you must love you more than truth or life or honor Tell me Rudolf why is it that love you now with all my heart when never even liked you before Never before It was at the coronation looked at you and And that was the first time you loved me You ask that as if youd be pleased to hear me say yes Would yes be true Yes You seem so different wanted you to be different from the Rudolf knew from the Rudolf didnt love And you are And you arent Flavia if were different if were not the king Why do you say that Could you still love me if were not the king In my heart there is no king no crown Only you Flavia am not Your Majesty thousand pardons Your Majesty His Eminence the Cardinal is waiting to take his leave We must not keep His Eminence waiting Is anything wrong Colonel Zapt Nothing Your Highness It is always my unpleasant task to be the reminder of duty Faithful Colonel Zapt God bless Your Royal Highness But above all God save the king God save the king The romance progressed very well tonight You struck a good blow for the king Whats to prevent me striking a blow for myself Dont take it so Youre bound in honor to play the king For honor Have you left me any honor Come come You forgot the human element didnt you m a man in love with a woman who loves me You saw tonight You heard did Then why should ever leave the throne Could you expose me If you did youd get Michael in my place could marry her and send the king and Michael lf you did that youd have to kill me What if did could raise all of Strelsau against you You could but you wouldnt Then find the king Find him Before its too late Odd a man not knowing his own brother But assure you theyre enough alike to be twins Youre trying to tell me the man saw crowned is an impostor Not your type of fiction see Too incredible But still these things do happen knew twin sisters once who But thats another story see Your Highness isnt interested Shall go to market elsewhere If what you say is true why hasnt the king been heard from Where is he Hes in a woodcutters cabin Oh by the way royal blood is not blue as most people think Its red know because had to spill a little Youve abducted him Its an old medieval custom abducting kings Only you could have carried out a coup like that What have you done with him Well theres one thing we havent discussed In fact its the same old topic In a cabin you say But where man Where Now why do people abduct kings For fun Your Highness Surely theres always the little matter of the kings ransom You can be the first man in the kingdom after the king How much down on account Ten thousand Thats a poor price for a king and a crown Twenty Well its too cheap But will admit hes a bit of a nuisance always whining about being chained up How badly did you wound him Not fatally m afraid But the cabin is very damp Your Highness He could easily develop pneumonia And let the Englishman reign for the rest of his life Could we ever expose him That hadnt occurred to me But if the Englishman died first and was buried in the cathedral as the king There are moments in your presence when feel myself an amateur This fraud is an insult to the whole country Your Highness shows me the path of duty It is the simple duty of a patriot to kill him like a dog There are times Rupert when we need the ladies Even in matters of state m about to ask a great service of you and Antoinette Rudolf Rassendyll It couldnt be a bill from my tailor suppose If Mr Rassendyll desires to know the whereabouts of the king let him come tonight at to the deserted summerhouse behind the wall on Boulevard Elphberg He must be alone If he neglects this invitation he may harm the Princess Flavia Oh obviously a trick of Michaels They must take you for a fool Wait a minute Theres a bit more If you hesitate consult Captain von Tarlenheim They must take me for an even bigger fool Ask him what woman would do most to prevent Michael from marrying the Princess Flavia and therefore most to prevent his becoming king And ask if her name begins with Antoinette de Mauban French woman madly in love with Michael Of course Shell lose him if Where is the Boulevard Elphberg Are you going am Not without me Good man But no Colonel Zapt Hed have different reasons why we shouldnt go all of them good ones Well if the colonel cant get news of the king well get it for him You know this is a trap dont you Three men are coming here to kill you Wheres the king Before tell you must have your word No harm to Michael Why do you betray him in one breath and plead for his life in the next Think what you like Think that just dont like murder Think that m just a jealous woman Have your word Yes As much as can give it if you tell the truth Theyre moving the king tonight from the forest to Michaels castle near Zenda Thats what wanted to know Wait If the castle is attacked the king will be killed No trace of his body will be found Charming character your friend Michael Do you want my help or dont you Yes How do we rescue the king Leave that to me You must have his friends at hand at his hunting lodge on some excuse boar hunting perhaps As soon as can arrange an escape ll get word to you How will know it isnt another trap of Michaels The man send you will have the mate to this Now go and go quickly And you If Michael finds out what ve done you and will not meet again Good luck in everything And to you with the princess Theyve come Theyre too soon Mr Rassendyll Mr Rassendyll forgive me if interrupt you at an inopportune moment but d like a friendly word with you m alone and unarmed Its Rupert of Hentzau Dont trust him We can talk with the door between us Count Hentzau Will you give me your word not to fire while we talk give you my word not to fire before you do Say what you have to say from where you are As you please truce while offer peace terms Fifty thousand pounds and safe conduct to the frontier Well that sounds fair enough Well do you accept Give me a moment to think it over Get out of the line of fire Yes Count Hentzau Your Majesty hold you to your word and accept your offer Congratulations The moneys in my pocket and theres a good horse waiting for you Come out d prefer you to come in Its less public Do you mind Not at all Careful hell shoot first What after hes given his word In England that simply isnt done Open it What when there are three against one All right ll open it myself Fritz regret that we have failed to keep Your Majesty sufficiently amused in Strelsau wouldve suggested a much more varied program than just riding with me only was foolish enough to believe that To believe what To believe you were serious when you told me you preferred my company to the courts should have known better But m sure after an exciting boar hunt you will be your old self again Are you angry with me Oh and what right have to be angry Last night you made me feel that every hour away from me was wasted But boar hunting thats quite a different matter Do you think want to go Of course you dont Your first duty is to the boars They would never forgive you if you didnt hunt them and kill them Perhaps the boars will hunt me They might even kill me Doesnt the thought of my danger touch you Or do you weep for my danger Oh this is like you used to be but not like the king ve come to love Oh my darling do you really think that would leave you to go hunting Then youre not going m not going hunting That is not just for boar Then what Rudolf its Michael Indirectly Oh darling you mustnt go My sweet Shall tell them cant go because we have an engagement to go riding wont let you go Send someone else What kind of a king would do that But dont understand why And cant tell you now But will tell you the moment can You believe that dont you Yes of course do Forgive me Rudolf ve behaved like a spoiled child You see ve never been in love before Oh my darling really must go Stay here Let me go alone No dont turn If see your eyes might forget to be a king Rudolf come back to me soon Shant a man come back to the loveliest woman in all the world thousand Michaels couldnt keep me from you But if shouldnt youd never forget me Never Youd be a brave queen and do your part Though my life be empty and my heart dead You would do your part Rudolf Put away those popguns and take me to the king The mans got courage you must grant him that ll grant him six feet of earth when the time comes No time like the present No Your Majesty Count Hentzau with a message from the Duke of Strelsau Tell him His Majesty is indisposed No wait a minute Lets hear what he has to say Send him in Disarm him first The playactor in person Hentzau Your Majesty bring you your brothers humble greetings and his hopes that you will enjoy the boar hunting here in Zenda And his respects of course to your two principal boars Well what price the crown today The last offer was pounds Do hear perhaps Youd hear a much better offer than that In private Before we go any further must tell you m prepared to give you a chance to escape your thoroughly welldeserved end on the condition that you yourself return the prisoner of Zenda to me alive Mr Rassendyll do you seriously expect me to believe that you of all people want the king back You insult my intelligence see Then youve come a very long way for nothing hope not for Michaels sake Oh youve brought another of his generous ultimatums have He doubles his offer hundred thousand pounds thought it would amuse you The fact is between ourselves Michael doesnt understand a gentleman You and we do dont we Rassendyll youre a man after my own heart You and are the only two people worth saving in this whole affair Arent we This is my plan for us Now listen Attack the castle boldly Let your friends ride at the head Theres bound to be a little rifle play Oh unavoidable Arrange the time with me have such confidence in you of course Michael will fall The king will already have moved on to a happier life in the next world And your friends if they fall too you and Rupert of Hentzau and king of the realm will be the only two left who know the truth Dont you think were being perhaps just a little drastic with Michael Perhaps a little But make it a point never to trust a jealous man dont you Michael jealous You know the lady think Oh in the summerhouse Yes But surely no woman in her right senses would prefer the duke to you Women are never in their right senses thank goodness So youre doing all this for love How romantic Well love and Your Majestys gratitude throughout your long and happy reign Then of course you might turn over to me Michaels castles and estates Oh yes of course we mustnt lose sight of those You never know whose hands they might fall into Look what offer you The throne and the princess You were planning on them anyway but this way its sure Shall we shake hands on it Hey Zapt Fritz listen to this Count Hentzau offers me the throne That is if you two dont mind being killed Their turn comes later playactor Yours comes now Guards stop that man Play the queen you blockhead Florence Nightingale Woman In our hours of ease Uncertain coy and hard to please When pain and anguish ring the brow ministering angel thou Could have some water Youll find plenty of water down here sire So even a king can be curious see Now Jacobs ladder went up into the sky didnt it Well this goes down into the moat but it serves the same purpose If this castle is attacked therere always two of us in the guardroom just up those steps ready to shove you down Jacobs ladder Properly weighted of course d like to be left alone if your orders permit The audience is ended Your Majesty Very well sire Try to get some sleep And may you dream of Jacobs ladder with paradise at the end of it Oh ve just done my best to make His Majesty more receptive All right Your Majesty What do you expect to gain by this except death Your admission that now your senses restored you have come to realize the people would never accept a king with your shall we say all too human failings Whats that Your abdication As soon as you have signed this a comfortable bed is yours and the best of care until youre strong enough to cross the frontier havent lived like a king But perhaps can die like one and not disgrace the crown never wore man here insists he has a personal message for His Majesty Says hes one of the dukes men Have you searched him Certainly sir Send him in If only this is from Quiet What is it you want have a message for am to tell you that a troop of the dukes hussars arrives tomorrow If there is to be a rescue it must be tonight You may count on me sir am to lower the drawbridge at two hours past midnight But the noise You say the king will be killed at the first alarm That is correct Madame says before the bridge can go down one of your men must swim the moat and climb to her room And then Alone one man might reach the dungeon That man alone must hold off the guards from murder until the others can cross the drawbridge and get below Always two guards on the prisoner you say Two by day and two by night sir Any other men who can fight Only His Highness and Count Rupert tonight Three against six Well tell madame that well be on the shore at waiting for her signal then will swim the moat The others will wait until you lower the bridge Good luck But why three against six Surely we can take our men We dont dare if the secrets to be kept No the odds are too great We must have help at hand if we need it Tell them to come Well think should be the one to swim that moat Right lad We cant afford to lose both our kings Youll lose one king tonight whatever takes place If anything should happen to him and not me your games up anyway ve been an impostor for your sake ll not be one for my own No Fritz swim that moat If we do lose you both whats to become of us who are left Theyll serve Queen Flavia would to God could be one of them Go now Give Mr Rassendyll time to hide in the passage Open the doors and let down the bridge hope can work the mechanism madame certainly hope you can The duke has retired for the night Hentzau is in charge of the guards was hoping d meet that fellow again The crash of the bridge will arouse the castle The guardsll follow the orders and kill the king before your men can get to
