Its his uncompromising standard He never meets his clients He doesnt speak with them or communicate directly Its his policy m his sole representative hes my only employer and have full authorization to speak on his behalf on all his business have with me a signed letter to that effect He doesnt negotiate his fee He works at a flat rate Under some unusual circumstances hell work pro bono Never in between suppose dont qualify for the latter category havent heard your proposal yet have a feeling that mine is not a charity case Most arent Mr Arlo you realize this is all very strange mean nobody in your field asks the kind of money your employer does and nobody communicates via a messenger Its all very unusual Let me tell you about the case of the man with the mismatched shoelaces Years ago when first came into his employ he was contracted to find a man cant give much detail but believe me if this man had not been located our countrys good diplomacy with a certain economic superpower might have a different face today Federal state local authorities all over the world searched for a face whose significance they couldnt fathom Hed vanished without a trace On the th morning a nonpolitical third party contacted me with an unrelated private agenda My employer had never heard of this missing man knew nothing about him After just one hour of desk work just an hour after accepting the case he picked up the telephone and placed a call Guess who answered the phone The missing man The man with the mismatched shoelaces Without ever leaving the house m telling you he never even leaves the house okay mean hes like some kind of recluse complete freak No social life In fact no social skills Fucking strange When he works the smoothest operator youve seen Brave slick cunning do anything Soon as he gets off work its all gone Afraid to go to the dry cleaners Literally Too uncomfortable in his own skin to go out and eat Tactless and inept Rude too Just an asshole You could meet him times and not realize its the same person He can tell you where you were born how old your mother was at the time and what you had for breakfast all within seconds of meeting you He can get a criminal to confess without his realizing hes being questioned How does he do it He has a deeply nuanced and functional understanding of human behavior to rival the great psychoanalytical minds of our time He understands the criminal mind as well as the innocent mind the stable mind as well as the psychotic sociopathic mind the male as well as the female dont think hes ever kissed a girl Hes thirtysomething years old What does he do when hes not working Does he just sit around the house When private investigation won its most worthy champion academia and the arts suffered a loss a great loss In addition to his many scholarly gifts hes a terrifically talented musician He writes songs Hes terrible His metaphors are thin his imagery is cliched and his thematic material is trite and heavyhanded Why do you do it left the firm didnt know what was going to do and get this message on my machine Hed watched me argue a case in court said was the only person for the job dont know The guys nuts okay Whats his name The mysterious and brilliant Daryl Zero Certainly does take himself seriously doesnt he All right Mr Arlo m sold What happens now You tell me how my employer can be of

makes the drop Hes done it times so far He gave me copies of the letters which are in a file that m putting in your briefcase with the case file Theres a drop tomorrow said he should plan to go through with it Good Theres a lackofinformation problem here and he wont say much Whats wrong with these people said not to lie Eventually you always figure it out It just slows things down You

You heard me Your problems with Jess arent my fault Could we please not talk about this now Youre not ready to get married and think you should look at that and Please m thinking maybe should get in touch with Hodgemeyer for this case Reservation for Hodgemeyer Mitchell Hodgemeyer This guy will be a pain in the ass Try to figure out which bank it is All right We got one shot to break through this Tomorrow afternoon Thats about the size of it Easy enough Its not without serious reservation that begin the seemingly impossible task of documenting my own methods It always seemed that someone else should do it Unfortunately my faithful legal representative has shown no interest whatsoever And so am forced to take on the task myself with no intention of glorifying or aggrandizing or immortalizing my own memory but rather in the hope that such a memoir might someday be useful to others begin my examination of the method always say my work relies fundamentally on two basic principles Objectivity and observation Or the Obs as call them My work relies on my ability to remain absolutely purely objective Detached have mastered the fine art of detachment And while it comes at some cost this supreme objectivity is what makes me dare say the greatest observer the world has ever known Observing a subject particularly a client in his or her own element is usually very telling Behavior is always more revealing than language if you know what to look for No rain Would you believe it What You talking to me said would you believe it finally stopped raining What are you doing over there if you dont mind my asking Level What Are you doing about an Seven Seven Thats funny Thats what m doing What Nothing didnt say anything Names Carmine Nick Carmine Greg Stark Real pleasure to make your acquaintance Stark Likewise Youre right but remember since Maxwells gone we dont have a fast break No teams gotten to the finals without a fast break The Celtics of the mids had no fast break Thats true They were a slow team One of the best shooting teams know went to school in Cambridge The Starks are a long dynasty of Celtic fans This is my good friend Gerald Auerbach Nick Carmine How was everything for you Mr Carmine Terrific Daisy could book a massage for tomorrow morning Sure no problem Betsy comes highly recommended Betsy is excellent How about Betsy has an

end really hope youre being followed You cant be too careful because we need to talk now First of all how was your trip Fine Good just left Stark at the gym Some major revelations Guys a mess Somebodys holding something serious over his head and dont think its about money He doesnt move like a whitecollar criminal When he walks his shoulders ride at ear level Also he cut himself shaving These are symptoms of a deeply ingrained paranoid fear Fear of being found out get on the treadmill next to his and get my machine going at his exact pace ask him what level hes running at guess He says level m running at the same speed he is Level Hed sooner lie to a complete stranger than to admit to being As soon as talk to him he runs the other way Its conditioning though reflex He obviously didnt think to connect me to the blackmail business at all If hed suspected me he would have remembered my name which he didnt Also like most lvy League graduates he drops his alma mater with almost no prompting whatsoever say Celtics he says Cambridge Oh yeah the gentleman prefers redheads He lusts after his redhaired masseuse You can tell by the way he takes his massage Its more than a little eroticized He does it every day at the same time with the same woman found an email message from Clearburg Kind of cryptic Note said Thorough check finds no boxer with the name Are obviously initials We have to figure out what they stand for Lets see what else Thats the important stuff Its Sergio Sergio Knight Right Whatever Can ask you a question Whats that Why are we talking on the phone told you We cant be too careful Two guys in an airport talking Its a little fishy Why are we even in an airport Why dont we just leave Okay see the confusion need more research need you to go back to And get in the computer Then break into Clearburgs computer and pull anything pertinent ve written elaborate directions Theyre in the phone book In front of you Turn to Rentals ll meet you at the motel tonight when you get back Instead of calling me you had me fly up here to tell me to go back to the computer and then fly back again tonight It wasnt an emergency There was no reason to risk the longdistance lines They listen you know Are you still there Here we go Transaction instructions for this Monday night cash transported in a discreet black leather bag that you shall provide for

building Please do not run Gloria Sullivan You Arlo That other guy left this for you That Olson He has a strange personality cant possibly overstate the importance of good research Everyone goes through life dropping crumbs Recognize the crumbs and you can trace a path from your death certificate to the dinner and movie that resulted in you in the first place But research is an art not a science Because anyone can find the crumbs the wheres whats and whos The art is in the whys the ability to read between the crumbs not to mix metaphors For every event there is a cause and effect For every crime a motive And for every motive a passion The art of research is the ability to look at the details and see the passion Excuse me Okay so you have to tell me now Yesterday how could you tell that was a paramedic You really want to know could smell it What do you mean could smell iodine Thats a very specific scent thats unique largely to ambulances and hospitals could see that your hair had been wet but dried naturally But smelled iodine so you hadnt gone home to bathe or scrub down since your last shift Then assumed you worked the night before when it rained Then figured paramedic not doctor or nurse Thats how just kind of guessed Youre right about each part Do you enjoy that work Sometimes Sometimes It can be a thrill You rush in the middle of something some chaotic mess and get involved intervene maybe help somebody maybe revive their body Some of its just boring though The hours are terrible m rambling now so Thats interesting to me What about you Do you live around here Do you live around here Stupid question What difference does that make No thats okay m only here for a couple of days on business So youre with that conference So youre an accountant Thats pretty exciting know dont know how you do that All the forms all the time The forms grow on you Where do you live Nick know Nick Carmine Daisy the front desk She told me What did tell you about these curtains And these over here Fucking whales Fuck the whales m a mess All that fucking exercise Maybe you should stop snorting that shit It keeps my teeth sharp went back to And got that stuff that you sent me to get but since you then went back to Yourself you probably dont need it anymore Did you see that poem that Stark wrote in college An Ode to Clarissa Worst ve read since the case of the shrinking gypsy strippers scribblings Tell me this How do you rhyme towards and birds Dropping falling diving towards Two lovers lost Plummeting birds They dont rhyme Maybe its not supposed to rhyme Also how do you write a poem about Clarissa and never have the name in the poem If ever a name deserved begged to be in a poem its Clarissa Anyway did that phone bookdatabase crossreference thing you asked for and there are men in Oregon with the initials And about a million in the United States that are listed How about you Have any luck on your end found the blackmailer You did Yeah Her name is Gloria Sullivan How do you know its her watched her walk into the bathroom and get the money have to admit was a bit surprised had a few guesses about suspects but d never mean just didnt even think twice about that girl So whats her deal Her deal Her deal is that there is absolutely nothing out of the ordinary about her Shes a model citizen college graduate good paramedic She volunteers at a hospital for the elderly She has no criminal record mean shes very eventempered Shes friendly eager to chat Theres no nervousness about her which is odd for a blackmailer Even at the pickup yesterday shes just Shes very cool Shes very cool But theres a definite intensity about her She looks you right in the eye Sort of a sensual quality Very personable nice sense of humor and actually very charming Charming Did you just say charming Keep looking for that safe deposit box and then get Stark out of the office Make plans for him to pay you at tonight Then maybe you could go home for a couple of nights Couple of nights Arent we done You found the blackmailer He only wanted a name Were not done yet First have to find out what her deal is Is this your kid Nope Just a rental You got the money Its in the trunk The first third You want a turn Does he know whos doing this to me Cant tell you anything yet Nothing Too soon Could interfere with the investigation Jesus Okay so heres how this is going to work You gave your car to the valet like asked Good Now when we get out of sight give me your valet ticket ll give you one Go back to the restaurant Order something had a late lunch m not hungry Then order something light like a salad When youre done give the valet your ticket Hell bring a car identical to yours Follow the map in the glove box Itll lead you back to your own car which ll have taken our money out of Keysll be in the visor Now is there anything you want to tell Mr Zero that might make his job easier What do you have in mind Like for example whats in the safe deposit box and where is it told you that is not pertinent to his task Now a few words on looking for things When you look for something specific your chances of finding it are very bad because of all things in the world you only want one of them When you look for anything at all your chances of finding it are very good because of all the things in the world youre sure to find some of them And the most important rule Often what youre looking for is right in front of your nose There he is told you about his thing for redheads right Guess what color hair his secretary has Red Men are so predictable So did you find anything useful Gold mine First of all got a full name on that boxer that Clearburg couldnt find Kragen Vincent It was on a letter from our blackmailer to our blackmailee warn you Stay away from Kragen Vincent He said he gave us all the letters He didnt give us that one Mr Stark apparently doesnt want me to know about Kragen Vincent So well have to figure out who he is and where did find one other thing of interest though Holy shit Those are the keys You found the gold Swiss Army knife know And the safe deposit box key Whered you find them In the sofa under the cushion What They were stuck in the couch in his office Was he hiding them Is that possible No Not possible Thats where they fell out of his pocket over a year ago What do you make of this think just as feared Ms Sullivan doesnt know a thing about these keys The keys are a coincidence Thats confusing Doesnt seem like a good thing Sure it is Its good because the man has been looking for his keys for a year and found them Now m going to go home So tell me you wont need me tomorrow because could check out this Kragen wont need you tomorrow m trusting you here Daryl Have a nice trip Its cold and dark in my heart Said its cold and dark in my heart Mama Look know this is totally inappropriate but Never mind What You know what m going to ask you Is there any way can get you to look over my tax returns You can speak languages and fly a jetliner but you dont know how to file a tax return Its never come up Does this have to happen right now No thats a was the Second World War Here it is My humble palace Its very nice How long have you been here Thats something Youre going to need a calculator That would be great Youre an accountant so you would know What is the Corrodium deduction The Corrodium deduction Thats a very good question because that in fact is probably the most widely misunderstood deduction in the book Really Indeed The Corrodium deduction is an incentive used by large manufacturers who are able to moderate their use of Class decay toxins such as Corrodium and Maalgorium Anything else All right Time to get dirty About how long is this going to take little while If you dont mind was going to take a nap Are you sure its okay ll just be here Just yell if you need anything else Hows it going over there Just another minute m rechecking my math You really ought to try to keep all your receipts for everything know never remember Just put them in an envelope Thats the thing to do try to keep all my receipts Its just a matter of habit now cant thank you enough You really helped me out there Thats really my pleasure Okay listen Let me make you dinner No you dont have to do that insist ll hop in the shower real quick then make us some food All right Retired Jesus Another letter word points Retire Retire Its not quite that simple Why is it not that simple Steve Whenever you say that it creeps me out told you its nothing weird mean okay yes Its a little weird But its nothing creepy exactly What do you get out of this What kind of a hold does this guy whoever he is have on you He needs me He needs you Who needs who need you Its time to get away from him Steve ll do it tomorrow when get there if you will marry me Marry me Absolutely vital The ability to blend in To very discreetly assimilate Its not usually very difficult All you have to do is look around see how all the ordinary people are behaving and try to behave like one of them You know when was in it seemed like such a lonely town Everybodys driving in their cars nobody talks to each other dont really know to tell you the truth about that So where are you from Originally Minnesota Minnesota ve never been there Do you go back there much You still have family there Were not really in touch So what are you doing in Oh was there twice Once when was little was there with my aunt and uncle was raised by my aunt and uncle They adopted me Then last year was there skydiving Skydiving Why do you do that Because love it Its the most amazing thing in the world Arent you afraid youll die or something know what you need Try again Take your time now Really set yourself Remember to bend your elbows a little little less Keep the right arm straight with the left elbow Check your aim again Then whenever youre ready You do this all the time Whenever can find it deeply satisfying Nice You try again Take your time Dont be afraid Its safe just as long as youre careful Its all about staying relaxed Sorry Its okay Just relax Bend this a little Keep this straight Hips back a little Lean into it Commit to it Check your aim again Relax and fire There you go Doesnt that feel good Want to try the shotgun Sure You want to stay at my place tonight mean you dont have to But the couch folds out just thought itd be silly to go to my place then youd have to drive across town to some crummy old motel Thatd be great Good ll even give you a receipt You can write it off You know my motto Always save the receipt You slept at her house She thought itd be easier than driving back to the motel cant believe you slept at her house cant believe with all that time with her couldnt tell more what was going on in her head couldnt tell what she was thinking Thats usually how it is in the beginning Maybe ll be able to see more tonight at dinner Youre taking her to dinner What was going to say no You got anymore on Kragen Vincent Theres one serving time at the State Penitentiary life sentence Prison records didnt say what for We better go find out Anything else What is it Nothing You the officer in charge of records m him Lieutenant Earl Hagans Steve Arlo Can come in What is this regarding work for a private The Department does not share records with except by court order assume that you do not have a court order work for a private detective named Daryl Zero Murder One in Single count And guess what the victims name is Let me guess dont mean really guess No way you could actually guess Clarissa Yeah Clarissa Devereau Of plummeting birds fame Seems likely doesnt it Very likely Two shots one to the head one to the torso execution style In her motel room Sounds professional Except he made a complete mess ton of evidence prints on everything got crime scene photos Remember the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes Its a lot like that They pick him up try him give him life no parole They think he works for someone but he wont talk even when they offer him a deal And Clarissa has quite an arrest record for a young girl Mostly political New York and Boston Disturbing the peace public indecency breaking and entering Regular firecracker Regular plummeting bird And Vincents still in jail No He was moved for medical reasons a couple years ago Kragen is her father She was raised by his sister because he was in prison She blames Stark for ruining her fathers life Stark hired Vincent to kill Clarissa for some reason Vincent got caught spent his life in prison Now hes dying this slow painful death Shes watched her fathers life drip away and shes getting even She has something some evidence or something that ties Stark to the murder got to figure out what it is and where shes keeping it Take me to the scene of the crime Its right up here Ready The bed we just moved is a fullsize bed In there was no size called full They had doubles and queens The full was invented to combine the width of a queen with the spaceefficient length of a double and eventually replaced the double in North America and Europe except for Quebec and Sweden The bed in the picture is not a double Its too long Its not a full It wasnt invented It is a queen Which means that that bed then was longer than this bed now So sometime in the last years somebody must have replaced the bed Hear that Secret room Its a pipe There once was a radiant water heater right there Kragen bursts into the room Her body was found face up She mustve been facing him probably standing close to where you are now Right away before she could scream shes down shes dead its over The only question is once she was dead why didnt he get out of there Instead he proceeds to touch the dresser the sink the doorknob and the nightstand What does the bed have to do with it In it was against code to have a hotel bed feet from a fish tank or a lava lamp or feet from a radiant heater Imagine if you will a bed longer than this one and a heater over here Wouldnt clear feet much less And no inspector would let that pass Which means Which means lKragen may have moved the bed see So youre proposing that he busts in the room sees her standing there shoots her twice moves the bed Something like that Why would anybody do that Hello dont know m trying to figure out some physical evidence that Kragen might have taken that he gave to his daughter so that she could blackmail Stark m trying to figure out what is absent Something happened in here Something involving his touching the dresser touching the sink touching the doorknob touching the nightstand and probably moving the bed Probably Somebody else could have moved it Come on There were only two of them Him and her Exactly You need to talk to Stark We got a few questions for him had a feeling you two would be a good match m good at reading people Thank you Do you want my opinion You should try to hold onto him How often do you meet a wealthy single architect from Los Angeles Daisy hes an accountant Are you sure Hes here for their convention Thats why asked him to do my taxes swear thought he said he was an architect Question Sorry to startle you Jesus How do you pronounce the word towards You nearly gave me a heart attack had to contact you right away What do you need must ask you some things Just drive Fasten your seat belt First of all how do you pronounce the word towards Towards And things that have wings and fly You mean birds Thats right They dont rhyme What Never mind The other thing was why did you kill Clarissa met her my sophomore year was and she was think From New York living in Cambridge met her at a demonstration have never seen anybody like her She let me walk her home and she kissed me for the first and only time You can skip right to the part where you decide to kill her Watch yourself Arlo Please describe the circumstances surrounding your contracting her murder After that first night was hooked was like an addict Finally she didnt want to see me anymore guess got a little obsessive My last year of graduate school met my wife And after graduated we moved back here we got married and went to work with my dad at the company And had all but forgotten about Clarissa Then in wed been back about a year got a letter from her She was here in Portland The letter was a threatening letter What was it dont think that makes a thread of difference What did the letter say She was accusing me of something Rape Did she want money No she wanted to ruin my life knew no juryd convict me was convinced of that But couldnt take this kind of publicity nor could my family saw my whole future flash before my eyes So you hired Kragen Vincent He said that for he could solve my problem And thats all know about the subject officer So whats in the safe deposit box tape tape he made of our meeting Audio tape My hiring him our names as clear as day Why didnt you just destroy it years ago Because dont know where it is Go on About a week after he gets caught a man comes to my house in the middle of the night and tells me that Kragen expects me to bankroll his defense though a middleman obviously And he also wanted money for his family Then he played me a copy of this tape and said if refused he would turn the tape over to the police He then gave me a key to a safe deposit box Said at the end of years when Kragen got out or if he should die would be given the location of the box In the meantime lm to hang onto this key with no lock and our friend would hang onto his lock with no key What would you do if someone was threatening you like that or blackmailing you like this What do you do dont know Its never come up Imagine it Imagine some opportunistic piece of birdshit has got a way to compromise you What do you do about it You cant buy silence You can only rent it If somebody has something on you theyll always have it So the cost has no ceiling and the fear has no end Thats why some knowledge some information is like a terminal disease Its contagious and its fatal Passion is the enemy of precision Forget the misnomer crime of passion All crime is passionate Its passion that moves the criminal to act that disrupts the static inertia of morality The clients passion for this dead woman had facilitated his downfall And the blackmailers passion would facilitate hers When you live with no passion other peoples passions come into glaring relief Bullshit bullshit bullshit Jesus Would you stop it Stop it Jesus Control yourself all right Control myself This is fucking bullshit Havent been good to you Havent been fucking incredibly mindblowingly fuckingly divinely generous as a fucking saint you ungrateful fuck Hey watch it all right Ungrateful fuck Shut up Why told you why cannot live like this anymore cant do it to Jess cant do it to myself and m sick and tired of working for the Starks of the world the lowest scum of the earth buying their way out of their own messes These people are victims of plots and they need our help This guy is a murdereratlarge who needs our help Their business equals their business Were not involved It has nothing to do with us Do you believe that Were the good guys What are you talking about There arent any good guys You realize that dont you You realize there arent evil guys and innocent guys Its just a bunch of guys What am supposed to do Just start taking meetings with people Just start talking with people Maybe Fuck that You know youll figure it out mean youre probably the best Excuse me Excuse me You are the best m telling you that after this case lm finished meant what am supposed to do without you You want my honest opinion You should take all this money that youve made and move to Europe Meet a girl See the world Really see the world Dont observe it See what its like What do you know m the greatest private investigator in the world ll go check for safe deposit boxes under the name Kragen Vincent dont know if thats necessary What Clearburg probably meant when he says theres no boxer with the name Kragen Vincent is that theres no boxes with the name Kragen Vincent think its a typo Right Right He probably used a different name Thats what think Well then lll go get a beer with my friend Bill said think But you should go and check just to make sure Fine But really hope that youve heard me Sorry to startle you What are you doing here followed you Back at my car this was on the windshield Another payment due tomorrow morning You sure you werent followed wasnt told you how to contact me You should not have come here Is he in there If walked in there now would Mr Zero be happy to meet me Go home Right now Make the payment tomorrow Were very very close m sick of cooperating It used to be or weeks Now its every two days Why so close together Maybe hes nervous Maybe he wants to kill me should carry a weapon No you shouldnt Look just dont panic all right How dedicated are you really Your timings impeccable How do you mean Never mind Maybe youve got some ambition of your own Maybe you want to have your own firm You got me pegged Thats all want is to someday be Daryl Zero ll give you million if you sell out your boss Just turn over your suspect Name and address million for a name and an address Cash We can go to the bank right now Youd give me million so you dont have to do this thing tomorrow m willing to give you million How much does he pay you million so you can kill someone right away instead of a day later For million you do it What if walked in right now Hes not in there What if want to find out myself What would happen ll shoot you Really will have a gun and everything Youre threatening me m threatening to kill you What Right before you jump off the plane you stand there with all the equipment on You know what to do you cant wait Is there a time when you think What if it doesnt open What if this is the last thing ever do Youre really stuck on the skydiving thing m stuck on what it is that makes you do very dangerous things Even dangerous things can be safe if youre careful Theres such a thing as knowing the odds Quitting while youre ahead Quitting before youre dead You know you me anyone could walk out here and get killed by some drunk in a pickup could slip in the shower and break my neck When your numbers up its up Theres no sense to it Theres no justice Innocent people suffer and murderers get away with it So when my numbers up whether m walking down the street or doing something else that will be that And until then m just going to do what need to do What is it you need to do need to try to feel right Can get you anything else No think thats it Do you need anything m okay ll take the check You got it Be right back When was a little girl used to hope that someday d grow up to look like that waitress My mother had hair like that My natural mother Really God forgot how that works Wait a minute Can a person be considered physical evidence Like in a rape case You mean if the guy doesnt know about the kid think so We think so Why You mean She is the evidence Shes not Kragens daughter Shes Starks daughter must admit like this place What You said that you dont speak to your family Why not realize m prying but what can say m prying want to know about you Just look me in the eyes and talk to me All right My father was an evil abusive man And he killed my mother when she was sleeping And then he slit his wrists when was dont talk about that much used to when it happened and then one day woke up and dont know Everything was different How about that What doesnt kill you defines you dont believe in an interventionist God But know darling that you do But if did would kneel down and ask Him Not to intervene when it came to you Or not to touch a hair in your head Leave you as you are If he felt he had to direct you Then direct you into my arms Sometimes what youre
