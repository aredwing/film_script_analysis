all over the world Is the Professor here am my fathers screen Once youve told me what this visit is all about he may choose to send you a cassette If he does which format would you like If he does its gonna make conversation a little difficult My father has not engaged in conversation for at least years The monologue is his preferred mode of discourse Format Videodrome Is that a Japanese configuration Youve never heard of it No Then there have been serious gaps in your education Videodrome Mention it to your father He may want to have a conversation love the view Torture murder mutilation Videodrome What you see on that show its for real m gonna audition was made for that show It has something that you dont have Max It has a philosophy and that is what makes it dangerous Hi

knocked and guess m still not out of it ll remember to set the timer Dont worry Youre sure Are you sure m sure Yeah Thanks Bridey Tomorrow Max that other cassette is from the office of Brian Blivion promised d handdeliver it directly to you Will you call me if you need me The battle for the mind of North America will be fought in the video arena The Videodrome The television screen is the retina of the minds eye Therefore the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain Therefore whatever appears on the television screen emerges as raw experience for those who watch it Therefore television is reality and reality is less than television Max m so glad you came to me ve been through it all myself you see Your reality is already half video hallucination If youre not careful it will become total hallucination Youll have to learn to live in a very strange new world had a brain tumor and had visions believed the visions caused the tumor and not the reverse could feel the visions coalesce and become flesh Uncontrollable flesh But when they removed the tumor it was called Videodrome was the was Videodromes first victim But whos behind it What do they want want you Max You Come to me Come to Nicki Come on Dont make me wait Please want you Max You Come on Come on Come to me now Come to Nicki Dont keep me waiting Please Please Today Lady Luck may smile on these four players and start them on the road to We have a new group of people coming in this afternoon so tell the staff about that All right Good Exciting Very lively Careful It bites You watched the cassette Yeah And It changed my life m not surprised Its dangerous you know Because your father admits hes somehow involved with Videodrome More than that It bites Isnt that what you said What kind of teeth do you think it has It triggered off a series of hallucinations woke up with a headache First time ever No lve been hallucinating for a while ever since What Since first saw Videodrome How did you come to be exposed to it Pirate satellite dish An accident made some tapes This is part of my own Videodrome collection But that tape is just your father sitting at his desk The tone of the hallucinations is determined by the tone of the tapes imagery But the Videodrome signal the one that does the damage it can be delivered under a test pattern anything Mmm Damage The signal induces a brain tumor in the viewer Its the tumor that creates the hallucinations You let me watch it expect them to come to me eventually to hurt me thought it might be you Now realize youre just another victim like Father was Where is your father think d better talk to him Hes in there m afraid hell disappoint you This is him This is all thats left What are you talking about Brian Blivion died quietly on an operating table months ago The brain problem The Videodrome problem You have it too But he was on that panel show with me On tape He made thousands of them Sometimes three or four a day keep him alive as best can He had so much to offer My father helped to create Videodrome He saw it as the next phase in the evolution of man as a technological animal When he realized what his partners were going to use it for he tried to take it away from them And they killed him Quietly At the end he was convinced that public life on television was more real than private life in the flesh He wasnt afraid to let his body die Tell me about my Videodrome problem My father knows much more about it than do Listen to him Wheres Harlan Hes not in the lab think hes up in Max Not now Harlan patrn Have you been hallucinating lately No Should be Yes You should be believe that the growth in my head this head this one right here think that it is not really a tumor not an uncontrolled undirected little bubbling pot offlesh but that it is in fact a new organ a new part of the brain think that massive doses of Videodrome signal will ultimately create a new outgrowth of the human brain which will produce and control hallucination to the point that it will change human reality After all there is nothing real outside our perception of reality is there You can see that cant you Max Renn Yes Who is this Barry Convex would like to talk to you about Videodrome ve got a car waiting downstairs for you sir Please direct your attention to the television set in front of you Mr Renn Mr Convex has recorded a little introduction for you Hi m Barry Convex Chief of Special Programs and d like to invite you into the world of Spectacular Optical an enthusiastic global corporate citizen We make inexpensive glasses for the Third World and missile guidance systems for We also make Videodrome Max and as m sure you know when its ready for the marketplace things will never be quite the same again It can be a giant hallucination machine and much much more But its not ready Those were test transmissions you picked up We thought nobody could tap into them Hes good that Harlan Good pirate Well now that you have think we oughta have a little talk dont you thought maybe my place hope you realize youre playing with dynamite Thats our spring line Top secret stuff brought it with me for a trade show here in town later this week Max Renn m Barry Convex think that machinery youre wearing is too much for the shape of your face Overwhelms you Try something more uh spidery more delicate Here she is This is our prototype This is the little number that started it all Max would like you to try this on for size would like to use this machine to record one of your hallucinations now Then would like to take that tape back with me to home base for analysis Do get to keep the copyright mean d hate to see it show up as a Movie of the Week and not get paid for it Max m trying to help you What makes you think need help Barry None of our test subjects has returned to normality Theyre all in need of intensive psychiatric care Now you seem to be functioning reasonably well so far d like to find out why and think an analysis of one of your hallucinations would be the right place to start Will it hurt It wont hurt you You might catch yourself sliding in and out of a hallucinatory state after this is all over If you do just relax and enjoy it Itll soon go away But for now think that youll find a little and will be necessary to trigger off a good healthy series of hallucinations Thats why our Videodrome show is so strange Something to do with the effects of exposure to violence on the nervous system It opens up receptors in the brain and the spine and that allows the Videodrome signal to sink in You mean m gonna have to hurt you Barry Fraid not You dont have to actually hurt anybody You just have to think about it Whaaa Thats too bright cant take it Yes forgot Sorry Hows that Shit Yeah Yeah Yeah thats fine Okay were rolling The taping mechanism is all selfcontained You dont have to do anything now but hallucinate Yeah Yeah Okay ll come back for you later Youll forgive me if dont stay around to watch just cant cope with the freaky stuff Nicki Nicki Well here we are at last right where we oughta be On Videodrome What are you waiting for lover Lets

interesting Dont let me interrupt think was saying something like What are you talking about was playing you tapes Max Prerecorded cassettes Videodrome has never been transmitted on an open broadcast circuit Not yet guess Barry sent you here what two years ago It has been two years hasnt it Harlan Two Two wonderful years Why To get you involved To expose you to the Videodrome signal It didnt affect you because you never watched it You knew what was there You didnt have to see it It really does work on just about anybody Anybody who watches it Max But why would anybody watch it Why would anybody watch a scum show like Videodrome Why did you watch it Max Business reasons Sure Sure What about the other reasons Why deny you get your kicks out of watching torture and murder You murdered Brian Blivion didnt you you freak Did you enjoy that North Americas getting soft patrn And the rest of the world is getting tough Very very tough Were entering savage new times and were going to have

of changing but thats only the beginning the beginning of the new flesh You have to go all the way now a total transformation Do you think youre ready guess am How do we do it To become the new flesh
