Hey Mr McAllister Not wasting any time are you Tracy You know what they say about the early bird Yeah do Good luck there Tracy Thanks Mr ll see you in class None of this wouldve happened if Mr McAllister hadnt meddled the way he did He shouldve just accepted things as they are instead of trying to interfere with destiny You see you cant interfere with destiny Thats why its destiny And if you try to interfere the same things just gonna happen anyway and youll just suffer Its hard to remember how the whole thing started the whole election mess What do remember is that loved my job was a teacher an educator and couldnt imagine doing anything else Mr McAllister Mr Quit day dreaming Get back to work The students knew it wasnt just a job for me got involved Put down the cards boys This game is over And cared Come on Wolverines Defense Lets go And think made a difference knew touched the students lives during their difficult young adult years And took that responsibility seriously In the years taught history civics and current events at Carver was voted Teacher of the Year times school record Teaching was all d ever wanted to do Standing in front of a roomful of young people trying to get them excited about the world trying to make them think preparing them for the tough moral and ethical decisions that theyd face as adults thats how wanted to spend my life So is this a moral situation or an ethical situation Whats the difference between morals and ethics anyway Anybody Derek Yeah Ethics is like when you do what society tells you is right to do And morals Yeah yeah youre on the right track Can anybody help him out Michelle Morals are like lessons You know like the moral of a story Its what you learn from a story or a fable Or a life experience Good And ethics Um ethics is how you use the morals that you learn from the story Yeah but think were missing something key here What are we missing Tracy Ethics are rules of conduct Tracy Flick Tracy Flick d seen a lot of ambitious students come and go over the years but Tracy Flick she was a special case Some people say m an overachiever but think theyre just jealous My mom always tells me m different You know special And if you look at all the things ve accomplished so far think youd have to agree Here am as Hodel in FiddlerOn The Roof Matchmaker matchmaker ll bring the veil You bring the groom And here am on our studentrun station The littering must stop Tracy Flick reporting But it was in the the Student Government Association where made my biggest mark never missed a single meeting And volunteered for every committee as long as could lead it agree with Ashley think we should rent the barrels ahead of time because what happened last time was a travesty It was ridiculous and think it really reflected poorly on all ofus Now Tracy Flick was poised to win the presidency ofthe student body And so far she was running unopposed Determined by a culture at a certain time in history Oh theres one more thing about Tracy think you should know Her pussy gets so wet you cant believe it Dont tell me that Dont tell me that dont want to know that few months before the election shed gotten herself in a little trouble with my best friend Dave Novotny Foxy Dave came to Carver the year after did and we hit it off right away Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place But basically he was a good guy Our wives became best friends too And when Dave and Lindas son Darryl was born they asked us to be his godparents You probably think the worst that Mr Novotny was taking horrible advantage of one of his students But it wasnt like that at all Our relationship was based on mutual respect and admiration mean during my sophomore year in geometry it was strictly professional between us mean nothing It wasnt until junior year when we worked together on the year book that things got kind of serious One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline Eventually Dave and were left alone and we got to talking Not like teacher and student but like adults You know Tracy notice that you dont seem to have any close friends at Carver You seem to be kind of a loner No m not m just real busy Oh no know know its not by choice just mean that that well being the kind of person you are it must be really difficult foryou to find somebody you could talk to What do you mean What kind of person am Tracy you know ve been watching you for going on and think you are one of the most talented hardworking sensitive attractive brilliant students No Human beings have ever met Thank you And know that sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness And that price is loneliness dont know maybe m wrong but it just seems to me like you might need a friend Since grew up without a dad you might assume psychologically was looking for a father figure But that had nothing to do with it at all It was just that Dave was so strong and he made me feel so safe and protected It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me the me that nobody else knows here Get down Get down Youre once Twice Three times a lady And love you Yes youre once Twice Three times a lady And love you love You When think back on my relationship with Mr Novotny what miss most is our talks You did it in your house In your own house know it seems crazy but Jim what m trying to tell you is that Tracy and are totally totally in love In love Yeah Its serious She inspires me in ways that Linda never has She even wants to read my novel But you havent written your novel Thats the whole point ve got the whole thing right here just need to get it out there And Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it Its beautiful Dave m just saying this as your friend What youre doing is really really wrong and youve gotta stop The line youve crossed is Its immoral and its illegal Jim come on dont need a lecture on ethics m not talking about ethics m talking about morals Whats the difference guess dont have to tell you how this all turned out Tracys mom she doesnt understand No d say she doesnt Fact is have never seen a mother so upset All right know what Tracy told her mother what her mother told me need to hear this from you because have a legal responsibility here Let me ask you this Did you cross the line with this girl di We Were in love Your novel Are you fucking kidding me Linda After Dave got fired Linda kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents Hes lucky hes not in jail Linda And ethics are the basis of Well pick up here next time Would it be possible for me to retake the test we took yesterday The test yesterday You wanna retake it Yeah had to work the night before and didnt have enough time to study Oh yeah Now that have more life experience feel sorry for Mr McAllister mean anyone whos stuck in the same little room wearing the same stupid clothes same exact same things year after year for his whole life while his students go on to good colleges and move to big cities and do great things and make loads of money hes gotta be at least a little jealous noticed it was a little low for you Its like my mom says The weak are always trying to sabotage the strong One thing thats important to know about me is that m an only child so my mom is really devoted to me And love her so much She wants me to do all the things that she wanted to do in life but couldnt Mom used to be a stewardess for Northwest and now she works as a paralegal She likes to write letters to successful women like Elizabeth Dole and Connie Chung and ask them how they got to be where they are and what advice do they have for me Tracy her daughter they say you have to hold onto your dreams no matter what The pressures women face mean you have to work twice as hard and you cant let anything or anyone stand in your way Hey Hey One per person Put those back Eat me But you know winning isnt everything Win or lose ethical conduct is the most important thing Just ask Mr McAllister Mr McAllister Mr McAllister wait up Mr McAllister dont go got all my signatures Theres way more than need Hey thats super Here they are Oh you can just put them in my box and ll take a look at them tomorrow Could you approve them now because d really like to kick off my campaign right away you know in the morning Right Yeah yeah Those look good to me Arent you supposed to keep them No Thats fiine thought you were supposed to keep them Yeah right fiine Thanks for everything You bet cant wait to start campaigning Whats that cant wait to start campaigning Oh Well it should be easy for you So far no competition Yeah but you know CocaColas by far the worlds number one soft drink and they spend more money than anybody on advertising guess thats how come they stay number one Yeah Well good luck there Tracy You know Mr when win the presidency that means you and are gonna be spending a lot of time together and for one would really like that time to be harmonious and productive Wouldnt you Sure Thats what thought was just checking Yeah Good luck there Tracy dont blame Tracy for what happened with Dave How could Dave was an adult more than twice her age Sure she got on my nerves once in a while but admired Tracy really did Thank God for Diane She was my best friend My source of love and strength Oh sure wed had our share of bumpy times but wed always seen them through After years of marriage we were closer than ever Anything wrong No No Just you know school When win the presidency were gonna be spending a lot of time together Lots and lots and lots oftime President and advisor Harmonious and productive Close and special You and Hey What are you doing here in the boys locker room ve come to see the star quarterback before the big game But what if Coach Henderson walks in Oh thats took care of him So uh what you reading m just reviewing my playbook have a playwe can practice You be quarterback ll be tight end You know CocaCola is by far the worlds number one soft drink Paul Aah Aah Aaahhh Aah was so mad at God when broke my leg at Shadow Ridge over Christmas break Why The doctors told me d have to quit sports for at least a couple ofyears if not forever which meant no firststring quarterback in the fall It was like the end of my life When got back to school everybody was so supportive and they all wanted to sign my cast and everything but still couldnt shake the feeling that now my life had no purpose What did God want from me Why did exist Sometimes you can search everywhere for answers Then one day destiny just walks up and taps you on the shoulder know because it happened to me Paul can speak to you for a minute Mr McAllister changed my life And no matter what they say he did or did not do believe he is a good man Paul know youve been pretty down since your accident Yeah wanted to play football again so bad could taste it and maybe go on to the playoffs and know understand disappointment really do Yeah Now personally think you have a very bright future ahead of you And m not talking about the fleeting glory of sports What do you mean Let me give you a clue Youre a naturalborn leader Youre one ofthe most popular students at Carver Youre honest youre straight forward and you dont crack under pressure as we all saw in an amazing fourth quarter against West side All the kids look up to you Now what does that spell Student council president Who me Oh no dont know anything about that stuff Mr mean besides thats Tracy Flicks thing Shes always working so hard Yeah Shes a real gogetter all right And shes super nice Yeah yeah but one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of democracy dont you think But Mr mean thatd be more like a dictatorship like we studied But Mr theres Paul whats your favorite fruit Pears Pears Good Lets say Oh no wait Apples Apples Fine Lets say all you ever knew were apples Apples apples more apples You might think apples were pretty good even if you got a rotten one once in a while But then one day theres an orange And now you can make a decision Do you want an apple or do you want an orange Thats democracy also like bananas Exactly Good So what do you say Maybe its time to give a little something back Hows that think thats No Just a little higher little higher Is this Eric you cant put tape on the outside of the poster It goes on the back ofthe poster You better just take the whole thing down and redo it Aaahaaaaaah Who put you up to this Oh hi Tracy Who put you up to this What do you mean You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president No Um no just thought that uh Thought what Well was talking to Mr McAllister about my leg and how still want to do something for the school and So Mr McAllister asked you to run Well um talked to him and everything but he just said that he thought it would be a good idea and how theres all different kinds of fruits and uh Its nothing against you Tracy mean youre the best Uh just thought uh Youre on Mr Popular You might think it upset me that Paul Metzler had decided to run against me but nothing could be further from the truth He was no competition for me It was like apples and oranges had to work a little harder thats all You see believe in the voters They understand that elections arent just popularity contests They know this country was built by people just like me who work very hard and dont have everything handed to them on a silver spoon Not like some rich kids who everybody likes because their fathers own Metzler Cement and give them trucks on their th birthday and throw them big parties all the time No They dont ever have to work for anything They think they can just all of a sudden one day out ofthe blue waltz right in with no qualifications whatsoever and try to take away what other people have worked for very very hard their entire lives No Didnt bother me at all Paul Paul power Paul Paul for president Paul for president Promise Progress Peanut Theres a place know Whereyou can look down The air makes you feel light The air makes you feel right What told you cant It just doesnt feel right anymore But love you said no Hey Tammy guess what happened today Dont you fucking knock Yeah Oh hi Lisa Get out Paul Listen So Mr McAllister he calls me in and he tells me gotta go You dumb shit Whatd do Its not like m a lesbian or anything m attracted to the person Its just that all the people ve ever been attracted to happen to be girls Lisa wait Stop What Where you going m not like you What do you mean m not a dyke And were not in love We were just experimenting How can something that seemed so true turn out to be such a lie Lisa and were destined to be together Of all the people in the planet who had ever lived somehow wed found each other It was like a miracle We had so much fun together like the time we ate a bunch of asparagus to see how long it takes before your pee smells funny It was very scientific For me it was minutes For her it was Every day found a new way to tell Lisa how much loved her If you died right now would throw myself under one of my dads cement trucks and get poured into your tomb But it just seemed like the closer we got the more she pulled away Are you crazy What These are private These are for us So But other people can see them too dont care Well do What did do to make her change Whats wrong with me Sometimes when m sad sit and watch the power station They say if you lie between your body just evaporates You become a gas wonder what that would feel like dont know why but Lisa decided she wanted to hurt me And she knew exactly what to do sure was surprised the day Lisa Flanagan asked me for a ride home and ended up blowing me ve wanted this for so long mean life is so weird First Lisa has a big fight with my sister and the next thing you know shes my girlfriend Since Lisa knew all about public relations and stuff she offered to help me with my campaign We made a great team It seemed so natural the two of us together It was like a miracle My leg wasnt bugging me too much and the weather was so nice And every day after school Lisa and would go to her house to fuck and have a hot tub If thats the way they wanted it then thats the way it was gonna be But wasnt going down without a fight Tammy Tammy what are you doing Youre the advisor You should stop her Shes not qualified Shes just a sophomore Did you know that Calm down Tracy Just calm down We cant both run can we mean were brother and sister Can we Its a conflict of interest and Paul was first Anybody who gets signatures in on time can run and she got in just under the wire These are a bunch of burnouts And whats this

unopposed for vice president So well move on now to the presidential race with candidates running The first in alphabetical order is Tracy Flick Tracy Poet Henry David Thoreau once wrote cannot make my days longer so strive to make them better With this election we here at Carver also have an opportunity to make our high school days better During this campaign ve spoken with many of you about your many concerns spoke with Eliza Ramirez a freshman who said she feels alienated from her own home room spoke with sophomore Reggie Banks who said his mother works in the cafeteria and cant afford to buy him enough spiral notebooks for his classes Eat me Eat me raw All right now Hey ifyou cant be adults and give these candidates the courtesy they deserve then you dont deserve to be called adults but children because thats what children are and youll be treated like children So lets all listen up huh care about Carver and care about each and every one of you And together we can all make a difference When you cast your vote for Tracy Flick next week you wont just be voting for me Youll be voting for yourself and for every other student here at Carver Our days might not be any longer but they can sure be better Thank you The The next candidate for student body president is Paul Metzler Paul Woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof Whoo Hey Paul Paul As many of you know broke my leg pretty bad this year and the experience has made me reevaluate what want to do with my life and that is help people When you think about it a school is more than a school Its our second home where we spend all our time and grow as individuals in the community But is our school everything it could be want our school to reach its true potential Thats why m running for president know what it is to fight hard and win like when we almost went to State last fall and threw the fourth quarter pass against Westside for the touchdown that won the game by points wont let you down like didnt then and promise we can all score a winning touchdown together Vote Paul Metzler for president Thank you Paul The final candidate for student council president is another one ofthe Metzler clan sophomore Tammy Metzler Tammy Ha ha ha ha People People Who cares about this stupid election We all know it doesnt matter who gets elected president of Carver Do you really think its gonna change anything around here make one single person smarter or happier or nicer The only person it does matter to is the one who gets elected The same pathetic charade happens every year and everyone makes the same pathetic promises just so they could put it on their transcripts to get into college So vote for me because dont even wanna go to college and dont care And as president wont do anything The only promise will make is that if elected will immediately dismantle the student government so that none of us will ever have to sit through one of these stupid assemblies again Whoo Yeah Tammy Tammy Tammy Tammy Tammy Tammy Tammy Tammy Tammy Tammy Or dont vote for me Who cares Dont vote at all Close the door tell you that little bitch made a fool out of us want her out of this election mean getting everybody all riled up like that She is washed up you understand me Shes finished Well we cant throw her out of the election just because we dont like her speech Thats not what student government is about Yeah yeah whatever Look all know is shes a troublemaker shes on my list All we need to do is send a message So maybe uh we should just suspend her Thats it days shes suspended for days Being suspended is like getting a paid vacation Why do they think its a punishment Its like your dog pees on the carpet and you give him a treat Then you get in trouble for skipping school Its so stupid Hendricks told me One more time and d be expelled Sounded good to me Oh hi Tammy What do you want Well went to all your teachers and got your assignments for you just thought you know last time you got suspended you fell so far behind and just didnt want to see that happen again Thanks Paul Thanks a lot Sure You bet Now could you leave me alone Oh yeah Um Tammy theres just one other thing You know all this election stuff cause everybodys saying its really weird that youre running against me and everything and it is kind of weird You havent really told me why youre doing it and you didnt tell me in advance but thats respect your privacy its just want you to know that no matter who wins you or me theres no hard feelings Were still brother and sister even though youre adopted cause hope you feel the same What happened at the speeches was an unconscionable travesty That little bitch Tammy Metzler wanted to make a fool out of me Well it wasnt gonna work Ifall those students who cheered for Tammy Metzler only knew how hard worked for Carver like all the late nights spend at the year book office just to give them their stinking memories One of my duties was to clean up the group photos It was a cinch with our new software People are so ungrateful Ahhaaaah aaahaaaaah Aaagh Aaagh Aaagh The day before the election was when things started to get really complicated Theres your culprit Linda had asked me to stop by on my way to school to help her out with a little plumbing problem Did you know Daves a bedwetter No No didnt know that All his life Hes tried everything Is that still running clear Yeah Better let it run for a while Oh wait Here This ones clean guess you better get to work huh Youre gonna be late Yeah Thank you Jim It was something that just happened Neither of us expected it Neither of us planned it But once we started we knew there was no turning back It was a miracle Oh Jim Hey take me to that motel like you wanted Now Um come by after school ll leave Darryl with a sitter Oh What had blossomed between Linda and me was too real too powerful to deny For the first time in years felt free and alive Hiya Jim Its not fair its just not fair just dont think somebody would do something like that on purpose It must be some sort of mistake like a maintenance thing Jim where the hell have you been Nowhere dont have any classes till second period Well tried you at home and weve got a situation here If Paul loses this election tomorrow there has to be another one with posters Somebody tore down their posters Those posters cost us a lot of money and theres no time to make any more All right well get to the bottom of it We still have some extra ones dont we Maybe we could just use those It was Tammy Thats who it was Oh no Hey like said she just wouldnt do something like that Well that speech that she gave you know it was pretty It was out there But well get to the bottom of it want you two to go back want you to focus on your studies Mr McAllister will handle the whole thing Right Jim Whats that Oh yeah Sure yeah you bet Tracy Tracy come on in Close the door behind you Have a seat guess you know why youre here If its about the posters think its awful think its a travesty Travesty huh Well thats interesting because think you did it What Are you accusing me Youre not serious Mr McAllister weve worked together on the for solid years Besides my own best banner was torn down Did do that too Were you or were you not working in the Looking Glass Office over the weekend was So Mr Paterno let me in As you know with my many responsibilities often have to come in on the weekend And have permission to do so But left very early around How do you know what time the posters were torn down dont just know that they were there when left m giving you helpful information thats all You know instead of wasting your time interrogating me we should be out there trying to figure out who did this Tracy Who do you think did it Whom should we interrogate Well dont know You know it could have been anybody Theres a lot of subversive elements here at Carver like Rick Thiessen or Kevin Speck and those burnouts Or what about Tammy Metzler mean her whole thing is being antithis and antithat Tracy youre a very intelligent girl You have a lot of admirable qualities But one day maybe youll learn that being smart and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead and yes stepping on other people to get there well theres a whole lot more to life than that And in the end youre only cheating yourself Why are you lecturing me This isnt the time or the place to get into it But there is for just one example a certain former colleague of mine who made a very big mistake a life mistake Now think the lesson here is that old or young we all make mistakes And we have to learn that our actions all of them can carry serious consequences Mmhmm dont know what youre referring to but maybe if certain older wiser people hadnt acted like such little babies and gotten so mushy then everything would be agree and also think that certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very very grateful the entire school didnt find out about certain indiscretions that couldve ruined their reputations and their chances to win certain elections And think certain older people like you and your colleague shouldnt be letching after their students especially when some of them cant even get their own wives pregnant and they certainly shouldnt be making slanderous accusations especially when certain young naive peoples mothers are paralegal secretaries at the citys biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits And if you want to keep questioning me like this wont continue without my attorney present You wanted to see me Mr McAllister Just wait outside Tammy but is this about the posters Possibly Please just wait outside because know who did it So ll just be outside Dont go anywhere Tracy Tammy come on in here This ought to be good So what do you have to tell me Tammy Well this is hard for me but think its important to be honest dont you Yeah What is it Tammy did it m the one who tore down Pauls posters did it When did you do it dont know Yesterday Sunday Howd you get into the school Door was open Which door dont know All know is did it Well dont believe you have proof Aaahaaaaah Aaahaaaaaah Aaahaaaaaaah Tracy Yes Looks like todays your lucky day Youre off the hook Tammy here has confessed told you told you Youre gonna pay for my poster easy now now quit while youre ahead will you Tracy Just run along Back to class The rest of the day was unbearable kept smelling Linda on my clothes and my fingers and just couldnt wait to get out of there wanted everything to be perfect that afternoon at the motel So decided to give myself a little time to prepare during eighth period Pop quiz everybody Put your stuff away Come on no whining If youve done your reading this should be an easy one d have exactly

Your divine hand that disqualifiied Tammy Metzler and now m asking that You go that one last mile and make sure to put me in offiice where belong so that may carry out Your will on Earth as it is in

Good girl Thats Thats it Thats it baby Thats it honey Maybe you needed more posters honey Or if youdjust taken my suggestions about your speech dont know Well fiigure it out Diane made a mistake and Did you want the same room Yeah Its a beautiful day The next day woke up resolved to get my life back on track The way saw it Dianes kicking me out of the house had been a good thing a wakeup call It wasnt a setback It was an opportunity fiigured we just needed a little time to work things out The election was behind me and the worst was over After all what harm had really been done Nobody was dead Jim Jim Yeah Walt wants to seeyou thanks You r rang Mr McAllister hope you can help us clear something up Yo Pierdo Tu Pierdes El ella usted Pierde Nosotros Pierdemos Gracias Seor Presidente Quieren verte enla ofiicina Huh Dr Hendricks Uh come on in son We have something hard we have to tell you Is it about Tammy Its about the election After Paul got the bad news Walt asked for a few minutes alone with me It was very simple really offered my resignation and he accepted Very quietly it was all over for Jim McAllister at Carver High Suddenly everyone knew who was that corrupt teacher who had tried to crush the dreams of an innocent girl Overnight all the good things had ever done in my life evaporated Soon the wire services picked up on the story It was the kind of absurd news item people mail each other or post on the bulletin board at work To top it all off Diane had started divorce proceedings She was completely unforgiving about the thing with Linda In the end she took almost everything including the house got the car Then one day realized it was time to get out of Omaha and move on Senior year was great Sure didnt get to play ball or be president but got elected homecoming king and prom king got into Nebraska like wanted and early rushed PhiDelts And at the end of the year me and my buddies threw a bitchin Mexican party down at the cement plant Shit that was a good party The only really bad thing about senior year was Lisa Right before Christmas she dumped me One minute shes totally in love with me and then boom she goes after my football buddy Randy Sometimes wonder what would have happened if had actually won the election Maybe my whole life would be different Like might never have gone to Yosemite with Greg and Travis Or maybe d be dead Alleluia Catholic school was great mean the teachers kind of sucked and they were supposedly way more strict But you could get away with murder The best thing about Immaculate Heart was meeting Jennifer JenniferJuniper Lives up on the hill JenniferJuniper Sitting very still Is she sleeping Jennifer and are soul mates and were never ever ever going to be apart JenniferJuniper Order Order Order Senior year was very productive for me Lets vote on this issue On top of a very successful student council year was in the top seventh percentile of my graduating class Opposed And got into Georgetown like wanted with scholarships Approved But sometimes got lonely and d think about Dave missed our talks Maybe it could have worked out between us dont know wonder what hes doing now Maybe he fiinally fiinished his novel But you know even with all my my riad accomplishments and bright future somehow just didnt feel the way youre supposed to feel Everybody else seemed so happy planning big parties and signing each others yearbooks Hardly anybody signed mine Youd think as student body president d be the one surrounded by friends But it wasnt like that at all Brittany Blake Fillmore As far as Mr McAllister was concerned you might be surprised but hardly thought about him at all anymore Besides nobody had heard from him in a long time It was almost like hed never existed in the fiirst place Tracy Enid Flick When got to Georgetown thought d fiinally be among people who were like me You know smarter more ambitious people was sure that fiinally d make some true friends Excuse me Would you please be quiet It wasnt like that at all lot of them were just spoiled little rich kids who didnt know how lucky they had it Thats ve come to accept that very few people are truly destined to be special and were solo fliers guess it really is like Dave said If youre gonna be great youve got to be lonely What happens to a man when he loses everything Everything hes worked for Everything he believes in Driven from his home cast out of society how can he survive Where can he go Right this way New York City For centuries people have come to New York seeking refuge from their troubled lives Now am one of them Besides d always dreamed of living in New York All that excitement and culture Living in the city brings surprises all the time Once in a while even bump into former students of mine from Carver Oh sure my apartments a little smaller than what was used to back in Omaha and the rents pretty darn steep but its got a lot of character And m cozy enough Besides its great not needing a car And get a lot of reading done on the subway Some days even walk to work The job market is pretty tight in New York but after hunting around for a while fiinally landed a position in the education department at the Museum of Natural History Thats right m teaching again When a school brings its students to the museum on a fiield trip theres a staffof both volunteer docents and trained educators like myself who pick up where the classwork leaves off And ve started seeing someone new Her name is Jillian She works at the museum too in Signs and Signage Shes really different from Diane and dont know ve never met anyone quite like her She just got out of a long relationship too so were trying to take it slow You might ask if ever saw Tracy Flick again Well did Just once was down in Washington for a museum educators conference and stayed an extra day to do some sightseeing After an inspiring morning on the Mall was on my way to the Holocaust Museum when ll never know ifshe saw me Probably not But in that moment all the bad memories all the things d ever wanted to say to her it all came flooding back My fiirst impulse was to run over there pound on her window and demand that she admit she tore down those posters and lied and cheated her way into winning that election But instead just stood there And suddenly realized wasnt angry at her anymore just felt sorry for her mean when think about my new life and all the exciting things m doing and then think about what her life must be like probably still getting up at in the morning to pursue her pathetic little dreams it just makes me sad mean where is she really trying to get to anyway What is she doing in that limo Who the fuck does she think she is Hey you Hey You asshole But thats all ancient history now ve got a whole new life mean thats whats great about America You can always start over So would that make this an igneous rock or a sedimentary rock Whats the difference between igneous and sedimentary anyway Anybody want to know how love began want to go to school again If youll be The teacher Long before the school bells chime ll be there ahead oftime Just to see my teacher Start right from the fiirst of it Dont miss a thing want to get All the facts then ll know what to do When we graduate ll hold you tight Then youll know you taught me right Teacher teacher m in love with you If youll be The teacher If youll be The teacher Start right from the first of it Dont miss a thing want to get All the facts then ll know what to do When we graduate ll hold you tight Then youll know you taught me right Teacher teacher m in love with you
