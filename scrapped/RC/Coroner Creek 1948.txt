We dont go in for backstabbing here Danning no matter whose This is a lawabiding community Yes and aim to keep it that way Youd better tell that to Miles not me Now look here Miles He already knows

put down that skillet Well its hot You going to be hot all over before finish with you What do you want with me little straight talk cant hold it any longer Keep them high Yordy heard you were out to get me Get you Whered you hear that Miles told the sheriff Miles Thats a lie figured it was thats why m here What was your deal with Miles Sheriff Hea thinks youre after me So if shot you could claim selfdefence never made no deal with Miles If shot you just right say under that left shoulder blade you know what would happen to you Yordy Youd fall face down on that nice hot stove Ever see a man with the skin burned all off his face Yordy Youve branded enough cattle you know what happens to hide when it meets hot iron You wouldnt get an idea my left hands slower than your right would you But if youd like to prove it Well Alright ll tell you everything What about a cup of that hot java Yeah sure Better have a cup yourself settle your nerves Now you ought to tell me a story Well you know that box canyon back of the shack here Yes Well we fenced it off all summer to save the feed And then about a week ago we turned all of Dellas herd into that canyon What about it told Miles that if the fence across the mouth of the canyon accidentally caught Accidentally caught fire the grass would go That grass would burn like pitch What an idea that was Yordy The cattle would move ahead of the fire right into that canyon You murderous snake What are you supposed to get out of it was to meet Miles at Folkensons and get half of it tonight and then after set the fire was to get the rest of it and head over the pass and get outta here You think Miles would let you live Hed kill you after you went back for the other half of the money and d be blamed for it Thats right Pack your stuff Youre getting out of here right now And if you ever head back to Coroner Creek ll be waiting for you Leach got a job for you Take blankets and ride up to Falls Canyon want you to camp there tonight right at the fence Dont make a fire and sleep light If anyone drifts up run him off This the first time ever heard the Rainbow outfit called cattle thieves if thats what you mean dont just do as say Della Hello Chris Wheres Andy Around some place just sent Leach up to the canyon to have a look at the cattle What for There might be a few strays Oh Arent you going to notice my new dress Already have Its the latest fashion Its pretty Della about the cattle up in the canyon lets ship them now take a profit while were sure Lets talk about the cattle another time Havent time m heading for Folkensons What you having Whisky Its kind of slow tonight eh Anybody else been here No nobody ever comes here dont know why you did The drinks are two bits keep your own count m going to bed If youre hiding from someone you better cover up that bandage Whatre you doing here followed you Go on back home Why You might not like what you see Who are you expecting Younger Miles hes coming here to meet Yordy But hes going to find me instead Get inside quick Yordy Yordy couldnt make it Whos that Danning Yordys run out on you see youre keeping your promise Yes a little every day Hey Do your shooting somewhere else m trying to get some sleep So instead of paying him to set the fire he would have killed him Chris why dont you let him go Let him go Yes you got rid of Yordy You ran out Tip Henry so Della can have back her open range You wrecked Miles scheme there You forced him to expose himself Isnt that enough Not for me Kate Chris theres something or someone bigger than all of us that takes care of our injuries and squares things for us ll do my own squaring Kate Vengeance is mine will repay Remember also remember an eye for an eye No Kate m not going to turn back now Miles must have done something pretty terrible to you And after you kill him whats ahead for you then hadnt thought that far You mean you hadnt cared to think beyond that point It doesnt matter what happens to me But you have to live with yourself Your hatred may destroy Miles but it can also destroy you Hate is something that can feed on itself for only so long Dont worry about me This fight with Miles is in the open now and its my fight alone If anybody gets hurt its going to be me and nobody else If you got hurt that might hurt someone else That cant help You can but you wont This thing that happened tonight dont want you to say one word about what happened to anyone not even your father hoped can change you see now cant nothing can Youre caught in a web of your own making and instead of trying to search for a way out of it youd rather strangle it Yordy Yordy warned you Abbie m in my own home Did that ever happen before Abbie When you were a little girl couldnt bring myself to lay a hand on you Even to spank you no matter how wild you got never thought d live to see the day my girl got slapped and did nothing about it lot of things are beginning to make sense to me now Youve only stayed here on account of me havent you Oh Dad You figured an old man was entitled to lie comfortably in the sun when he was through didnt you Well so did maybe Chris Chris Chris Chris Chris Whats troubling you Andy Get on your horse ll tell you on the way back got a funny feeling it aint good ll tell you on the way back cant understand why Chris didnt tell All he said to me was that Where were you Leach told you to watch the cattle in the canyon didnt figure on no fire knew Miles outfit wouldnt rustle our cattle so didnt see the sense in staying Nobody asked you to make sense of it Leach isnt to blame you didnt tell him it was fire you were afraid of You were afraid of fire werent you Maybe If you told me it was fire you were afraid of would have stayed When give an order dont want to to explain it you follow that order All that cattle lost maybe youll tell us who did it Might have been one of Miles men or even Miles himself cant prove anything unless Leach saw anything didnt see nothing You would have if youd stayed like Chris told you It wasnt Leachs fault It was too Miss Harms Sorry for your bargain Della All you brought us is trouble He brought you Feserley Canyon Tip Henry quit the country and lost the homestead and you got back your old range If remember rightly told you d go lightly Hey what are you all dressed up for m checking out too No youre staying Andy she needs you Not me and Leach both she dont You belong here youre as much a part of the Box as that post there Oh suppose so But m not letting you ride out of here alone Rode in alone Drifting Thats just about it Soon as ve

Take care of things Sure Chris Better get out of these town duds and into my working clothes Chris m sorry for what said a while ago was so upset Will you forgive me and stay on m not letting you down ll find the man that set that fire and youll be paid back for the cattle you lost Theres nothing more can do here Yes know You think more of your personal battle with Miles than you do with my loss dont you If you put it that way do But remember this youve got to face losing as well as winning and if you can do that youll be alright ll be alright know what it means to win know what it means to lose too Good luck Della Come in Thats alright Miss Harms shouldnt have let myself be caught midstream like this Andy have a job for you want you to go up and take over Tip Henrys shack and homestead Feserley Canyon for us Is that an order Miss Della Yes it is Oh Andy ll send Leach up later with provisions Yes maam Homestead Feserley Canyon Where are you going to a powwow Thatll learn you When youre told to sleep by the fence sleep by it reckon Hi Danning had an idea youd show up here Why Younger Miles rode into town was asking for you Thats why m waiting Well Just to warn you to keep awake and stay out of the open Is that one of Miles orders Wait a minute dont want your advice save it for your boss And if you see him before do you can say m looking for him Alright but Younger Miles aint in town on Sunday for no church going Theres something peaceful about a church bell isnt there Dad dont know Something ominous about the way it sounds today Theres an unhealthy air about the whole town Jack has Younger Miles been in here No aint seen him all morning Come on boys drinks are on the house How come Because Miles aint here Morning Chris Oh good morning Abbie this is Chris Danning How do you do ve been hoping would have a chance to talk to you If youll excuse me Certainly owe you an apology for a couple of raw remarks made accept your apology Although it was your right to say what you did dont think any man has that right Although at the time thought it would serve my purpose You know in a way m grateful to you Mr Danning Grateful how Miles is a cruel man but he always checked himself before he went too far It wasnt until you came to town that he began to lose control Well hope things will be better for you now They will be now that ve left him Kate ll meet you at the church m very pleased to have met you Mr Danning Thank you Kate d like to have my room back What happened at the Box quit the Box You quit But why Falls Canyon was fired last night and Dellas prime bunch of two year olds was wiped out How could you leave at such a time Well can help her more by finding the man that did it and making him pay Miles Thats why m in town Thats a job for the law isnt it The law In this town where the sheriffs working for Miles Not any more Heas against him and wants to fight him Why dont you join the sheriff and fight with him No Kate Im sticking to my own way Kate m sorry wish d known you before Why Because theres a better side to you Youre letting your hatred for one man destroy it You seem to know a lot about it know all need to know Except the beginning even know the ending There only be one ending But its beyond that thats troubling me the most not just the killing of Miles youre wondering whether it will bring you freedom and the peace of mind you always thought it would You dont think it would do you cant give an answer to that Youll have to get it over with and find out for yourself Who you got there Andy West hes been killed When did it happen How came up on him at Tip Henrys homestead he said he was planning to take over He pulled a gun on me it was me or him He got it Hes telling the truth saw it all Tell the sheriff what you told me Well Tell him saw him kill Andy Hes a liar Hea Shut up Now Leach just what did you see Well was riding up to Tip Henrys shack to take Andy some grub Just as was coming into the clearing

Chris m beginning to understand Then you see Kate why have to do it my way now Yes do Good luck Chris Well boys all can say is this has been the most exciting Sunday that ever happened at Coroner

to be sleeping in jail with my boys Howdy Howdy Looks like you been riding hard Danning Not hard enough Looking for Younger Miles Seen him No aint Alright Hea that was a pretty good show you put on
