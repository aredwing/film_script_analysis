In a filmmaking career that has spanned over years my next guest is the man responsible for such cinematic classics as the house of Usher wild angels the monster from the ocean floor the attack of the crab monsters Please welcome Roger corman Lowbudget movies in those days it wasnt like today Nobody was really trying to make them good There was the real emphasis on the price Roger corman has made more than motion pictures in his career most of them for extremely low budget Hes produced around films He made so many movies In he directed movies Most people dont get to do that He made movies and never lost a dime Okay this is not a million movie You know this is a science fiction movie We knew these were made fast and cheap and we also knew that taste was out of the question There was no need for taste The way Disney movies you know bring out the child in all of us you know so can exploitation Sometimes hell give the notes right on the script and you get little marginal references like breast nudity possible here Question mark The goal was Roger said every motorcycle that runs have it smash into something And then when it stops running blow it up Aah He said your job if the cops come is to pick up the camera and run said were in the middle of the desert What do you mean there is no water Its a Roger corman movie you know Theres no water You know they kind of went around the sound stage one take on everything Thats just the way he worked You know you didnt argue with him And we were delighted to be working It doesnt matter if people are happy It doesnt matter if you have a permit None of it matters You know the only thing that counts is what you get inside the frame Hes still around making pictures in his s and hes i just saw him the other day He hasnt changed at all Man One two three And action Man One two three m in the water with a giant creature on my arms pumping blood out chomping on a beautiful girl in a bikini mean its the essence of Roger corman cinema Roger corman We feel that the monster should kill somebody fairly early and then at regular intervals through the picture The first kill should be quite shocking The other kills can be a little bit less shocking as we build up And then of course the climax everything goes blood all over the screen Frances doel Roger had made two previous movies for the syfy channel that did very well for them And he said okay Frances its dinoshark you know what that is And of course say yes know what that is Its a giant shark Yes but not too much like jaws No of course not Woman Charlie take three Man Marker Julie corman Dinoshark is about a shark that is unloosed because of global warming from an avalanche north of Alaska Eric balfour Thats your killer It hasnt eaten in million years and its hungry Julie And somehow mysteriously makes its way south to puerto vallarta and pretty much terrorizes everybody and everything in sight David carradine You know that whole world is just so different from the entertainment weekly world or the academy award world The golden globes dont even hear about these things You know these pictures they just go someplace else And theres an incredible number of people that want to see a picture just like this Doel The paradise village location also had some accommodation for actors and crew and so on So thats always been one of those little tricks up Rogers sleeve how he can do what he does on a budget Roger always said you know you could make Lawrence of Arabia for a half a million dollars You just dont leave the tent Balfour If you could imagine knows Berry farm set on a beach but the only people in the park were senior citizens no rides but it had a themeparklike atmosphere that is what we have affectionately dubbed paradise prison Who is two minutes from being ready for what Balfour At first thought it was maybe some kind of electromagnetic field that doesnt allow the walkietalkie service Man need a radio that works But it turns out that we just bought you know childrens walkietalkies This is fullon guerillastyle filmmaking mean you know were sort of running and gunning and stealing locations and driving boats where they shouldnt be driven Man Go go go get out Oh my god At one point they wanted somebody to get in this water Man Action To get attacked by something Well it turns out there was actually things to get attacked by Not that this wasnt obvious There was a giant sign that said crocodiles Should she be there Well thats where she was in the wide shot The way this will be cut itll work Okay All right You wouldnt think of the movies if you met him that hed have done all these movies very polite very almost British He really came across felt as more like an English film professor you know expected him to be teaching at Oxford or Cambridge rather than kind of making all of these kind of violent exploitation movies that he had made thought hed be more like Lee j Cobb lets say or somebody a little where theyre smoking a cigar and pounding on the desk and you kids get in there and do that work and you know and actually hes very eloquent elegant and precise coolheaded from what saw and very very different from the type of person youd think would be behind these pictures like teenage cave man Corman The difference between the image you present to the world and what is going on inside in your unconscious mind is significant ve been told that my image is m just sort of an ordinary straight guy Clearly my unconscious mind is some sort of a boiling inferno there Like most kids i was interested in films essentially all my life graduated from Stanford university in California in engineering worked four days as an engineer and quit The only job could get in films was a messenger at th century fox And worked my way up from that to become a story analyst read scripts commented on them and handed in a synopsis of the script or the novel or whatever had been proposed with my opinion As the youngest reader i was given frankly the most hopeless scripts to cover And the story editor said Roger you have never recommended one script And said youve never given me a script thats worth recommending So they sent me a script which was the first thing d ever read at fox that thought was really any good at all And made a number of notes on it The picture became the gunfighter starring Gregory peck And the story editor got a bonus for my notes And got no recognition for the fact that a number of my ideas were used in the script This became a big hit for fox You would have thought he would have had some acknowledgement This caused him to leave fox and become what he is today After the gunfighter he corralled some money from our parents and some of his money and a few friends got an enormous number of deferments and made his first film monster from the ocean floor And that was basically the beginnings of Roger corman was the producer the assistant director and everything would drive the truck to the location and unload everything could by myself And would save about an hour on the crew salary every morning The second picture made was a picture called the fast and the furious It was about road racing and of course had very very little money Jonathan haze Roger went to some sports car dealerships and borrowed sports cars And we took the windshields off them and actually raced them And then wed clean them up and take them back Roger was just so inane at the time and was trying to do it himself and was starting to run out of money If you dont understand money in the movie business its like an artist who doesnt understand paint Roger told me well understand paint If got to thin her up with turpentine or theres no picture why she gets thinned up a little Thats all there is to it could see the problem for the independent You raised the money You made the picture And then you had to wait for the picture to earn its money back before you could make another picture But Sam arkoff and Jim Nicholson were starting a new company American international And they made me an offer for the fast and the furious to start their company with said i want a threepicture deal in which m guaranteed my money back As soon as finish one film go to the next one using the guarantee And that essentially started me on a regular basis of making films and started American international Dont call me squaw Youre a dirty apache squaw m gonna kill you Your people did that raiding thieving killing Haze was very famous for fighting with the girls This was apache woman Joan Taylor and did a knife fight in the street And this is dick Miller in the background where he belonged friend of mine Jonathan haze said well maybe ll introduce you to Roger corman and he can help you We went down there He said what do you do said m a writer He said we dont need any writers right now He says i need actors said m an actor He says you want to play an Indian for me At the end got killed Roger said how would you like to play a cowboy for me said oh are we going to another picture He says no no this picture said oh god Okay wound up killing myself in the last scene dont know what the budgets were but they were really low We shot them in seven days so that gives you an idea And thats everything including special effects or anything else you know Some werent all that great and Rogerd be the first guy to tell you that never had the opportunity to go to film school My student work was being shown on the screen And some of it wasnt quite as good as it might have been but was learning all the time Beat it said Youre on a battlefield know that better than you do sergeant How well are you doing Half my men are dead Nothing can stop that thing Call off your troops Scorsese Its as if these films were being made on your street corner in a way They werent encumbered by having to deal with art with a capital art They just werent mean theyre art in another way Corman learned fairly quickly how to handle the camera what to do with editing but didnt know enough about acting and felt should simply take a class And that was where met Jack Nicholson Nicholson He came into the class with that little smile and everybodys as serious as a heart attack you know He had when was first working for him he told me he had companies the contracts of which were all in his back pocket mean he was a oneman band Dont make me Dont be a fool kid You think would carry a real gun As a matter of fact the first picture Jack Nicholson starred in was for me a picture called the cry baby killer about a kid who takes a drivein hostage Its coming Cant you get him to be quiet until it comes Nicholson hadnt really worked at all before Then got a lead in the movie thought oh this is it m here m gonna be big you know Then didnt even get an interview for the next year Look Carole was a swell girl until Manny got his hands on her You mean till she wanted Mannys hands on her Listen Fred Cry baby killer was just humiliating but good for me Hey Rogers the only guy who hired me for about years Teenagers never had em when was a kid The word teenager didnt really exist until the s If you look at the s and s their idea of a teenage movie was Andy Hardy Hey Betsy Oh boy oh boy oh boy What do you thinks happened What do you thinks happened What Well tell me what Cynthia wont go to the dance and i dont know why and dont want to Times were changing Dave Okay Johnny Corman The major studios didnt really understand the audience was looking for a different type of film If we were going to make pictures about young people d have picked a young guy like Jack Nicholson But youre through breaking the law Sarge dont break the law make my own Roger really realized that young people at that time really liked movies where teenagers were in trouble with the authorities He had found an audience that you didnt have to go through the studio system to reach Not only was he a rebel from Hollywood in that he did it all himself and did it outside of the studio system but there was an edge of rebellion you know to the movies Dante You make it as disreputable as possible so that the parents wouldnt want them to see it and that they feel that when they go there theyre doing something transgressive and youve got an audience Youre making outlaw movies basically And Roger has always been an outlaw Let go of me you big ape Now beat it smart boy and dont come back or ll break your head Break whose head you phony frenchman You aint so tough Took this moosehead to throw me out Corman ve always been antiestablishment spent two years in the Navy Those were the worst two years of my life came very close to setting the record for the most demerits because felt if they set up a rule really must break that rule Ron Howard Roger understood the need for audiences to identify with rebellion Beating the system thats cathartic you know defining yourself on your own terms These things are elemental Theyre all what we go through during those rites of passage think that he understood that when he was dealing with those basic experiences and feelings that he was talking to a young audience We know he always had something up his sleeve He was more irreverent He was more hip very hip very cool bucket of blood is a really good example of parody of the hip scene the beat scene in la Walter youve done something to me something deep down inside of my prana have Oh Walter i want to be with you Youre creative Almost all of Rogers pictures has a little edge to them They were they just bordered on something sacrosanct that you shouldnt touch this and he did it anyway And thats usually what pulled the picture through Feed me m sorry pal m fresh out of blood Talk to somebody else m hungry dont care what you are Cant you see m knocked out just killed a man m a murderer He was always pushing Rogers idea at the time was to cut down the time of shooting So now his ambition was to make a film in two days Now no novocain It dulls the senses Haze It was work mean we would get there early in the morning and wed just start grinding out these scenes One day was half the movie Oh my god dont stop now Roger had borrowed all the dental equipment from his personal dentist and they hadnt bolted it down to the floor We banged into this big dental shit and it started to fall over And Roger cut the camera and ran out and saved the dental equipment To hell with the scene can truly say ve never enjoyed myself so much Nicholson d have terrible experiences going into the theater with movies that had made in that period with Roger cause you know they were kind of a lot of them were grim Bye Bye now By mistake he actually made a good picture every once in a while was never in it but that was as much my fault as the next guys Corman By the beginning of the s began to have confidence in my ability to master the craft At least she has found peace now Has she Jonathan demme Wed never miss a poe movie They were riveting and stylish and hip and funny And we couldnt wait for the next one And of course with Roger you didnt have to wait very long The next one was gonna come out like a month later Do you know where you are bartolome The pit and the pendulum Howard The poe movies were huge for me especially the pit and the pendulum They had this campaign where the blade was coming down you know and just kind of whew And oh my god it was and rushed In fact thats probably the first time that a campaign made me go to the movie They were so successful ended up making six Edgar Allan poe films Scorsese The artistry of the films really developed into the poe pictures The house of Usher the pit and the pendulum and the tomb of ligeia which is my favorite She desecrates the earth in which she lies nervous contraction nothing more Scorsese He was a name that wed go like must say like a Hitchcock film Wed go see a Roger corman Corman They wanted me to make more but by that time said enough m starting to repeat myself We played it for a little bit of humor in some of the later pictures particularly the raven Nicholson was doing the raven And he said Jack look these sets are gonna be up over the weekend so can use the same sets for free m gonna have somebody write something And he went and he got a guy who wrote pages of just dialogue To this day no one knows the plot of the terror It was very strange mean we played the weirdest characters played a guy that was an assistant to a witch In the beginning of the film m a deafmute And then halfway through the film they decided that they didnt have an ending for the film Theyd better make me talk can say no more There is great danger Find Eric Eric knows Haze Dick played a livery Butler with a New York accent Nicholson And youll see in the picture now god forbid dont want to encourage anyone to see it throw dick Miller up against this door Wheres the baron We must get to him Hes locked himself in the crypt And dick Miller now tries to explain the entire picture in one speech The baron did return that night to find Eric with the baroness and he did kill her But there was a struggle and in the fight it was not Eric who died but the baron killed the baron Its the only film that d defy anybody to cause there is theres no story actually arrived at Corman Various directors shot the film Francis coppola started and shot some sequences at big sur but then got an opportunity at a major studio So had monte hellman shoot for a while Monte then got another job and think ve forgotten all the directors There were four or five directors including finally Jack Nicholson shot some scenes himself And eventually i went in for an hour and shot the final tiein shots and finished the picture It is a somewhat confusing picture Oh man god Hopeless all of it think he wanted to be taken seriously as a filmmaker because up until then hed been making monster movies and SciFi movies Perhaps its not so much that he wanted critical acclaim but he wanted some depth some feeling some reason for making a movie wanted to do something a little bit different And d read the book the lntruder which was about the integration of the schools in the south And wanted to make that picture was very much in favor of integration showed the screenplay to American international and said this will be my next picture To my real surprise they said they didnt want to make it And theyd never said no took it to allied artists They said no Everybody said no so said all right ll make it myself So my brother and i produced it in the south He was a leader of men but he was evil He was a stranger but he brought lust and love rape and hate to this quiet Southern town He was the intruder This is not the reason we made this film It is the exact opposite of what we intended this film to be It was not and is not an exploitation film This picture was the first film that Roger could actually make a statement about his personal feelings as opposed to doing the poe films or the films that were just exploitation drivein films Corman Playing the lead was the new young actor making his first film bill shatner All knew was that it was a wonderful part and it was a wonderful opportunity for me at an early point in my career The character played was based on a real person He was a white supremacist from New York City and went down into the south to rabblerouse and tries to stop the integration of a school mean theyve got niggers enrolled already in the school And theyre starting Monday Yes know Do you think its right No sure dont Neither does nobody But its the law Whose law Shatner What is difficult for people to understand now separate but equal was the law of the land That meant water fountains that meant restaurants it meant schools that were totally segregated It was the height of the integration wars It became very apparent once we were down there that people held polar opposite views of what was right and what was wrong Man Take it easy nigger Youre not going anywhere Driver Whats the trouble Are you looking for trouble No sir Were on our way to the house Just on our way to the house didnt tell people what the subject matter is but the title lntruder you know And with the track record of Roger all the films mean they naturally thought it was a horror film or something in that genre It was only as everything started to unfold and they saw exactly what was happening mean people were driving us out of locations We had to change motels mean it got to be very heavy down there Hey are you really gonna make him go to the white school tomorrow Why m not making him go Am Joey No ma Well its too bad aint old enough wouldnt be scared thats all Whos scared We were having our lives threatened to make a film about integration Roger displayed such courage under fire And gene corman his brother such courage to make the film There was such animosity and the experience of hatred that think we realized we had a bigger problem think we were more naive than we should have been at that point in time You were alone with a white girl in the basement of the school but you didnt try to do anything Is that what you expect us to believe nigger Well speak up Gene We felt we should definitely expose our audience to this kind of material because this is what was going on in America and somebody had to say stop This is not the American way It was a lie everything everything said about Joey all of it You were gonna kill this boy You know it and know it Shatner Making films is a dedication You have to be possessed At some point there i realized that they had mortgaged their home for that film That perhaps was the most admirable thing of all because its one thing to be cavalier about spending money that isnt yours but to be so adamant as to put your house on the line thats thats extraordinary We arent gonna give up now not now No sir not ever Gene d set up the sneak preview with pacific theaters It was almost a riot in the theater People were screaming communist And one of the ushers or one of the people who worked at the theater came up to me pinned me against the wall said youre a communist You dont belong in this country The picture was a wonderful commercial failure started to say a wonderful critical success but got confused But ll leave the confusion there because its all wound up in my mind It sort of gets me in the stomach when talk about it Gene This is the only film that dont think we ever made money on And yet it was our best film We were ahead of the time It made me rethink my method of making pictures And felt the public really is the ultimate arbiter of your film If theres something you really want to do in Rogers case its making movies then you keep on doing it Every time you fail you just keep on Corman thought i should go back to a more commercial type of film was starting to learn method acting technique There was what was known as the text and the subtext The text is the written script what you were saying The subtext is what you mean what you really feel that causes you to say these words And felt should make my subject matter the text which will be a commercial text but my theme my message what is important to me should be the subtext so the audience will get what they paid their money to see think he consciously was looking to contemporary events news for inspiration for material to make a movie Corman Aip said all right what do you want to make said theres a phenomenon in the country right now the hells angels the outlaw motorcycle gangs want to make a picture about the hells angels And they agreed instantly Peter bogdanovich Roger offered me a week to work as his assistant on the picture And he said could take Polly with me His reputation was you know complicated because kept hearing that he was a millionaire And thought he was pretty eccentric you know cause he didnt live like a millionaire But had little interest in his movies to be honest because was a big snob and only liked Fritz lang and Howard hawks and John Ford The star of the picture was George chakiris whod won an Oscar for westside story The phone rang in my house here in Los Angeles in Beverly hills and it was Roger He said we have a problem said George cant ride He said how do you know said because know George He can dance but he cant ride You need a biker Do you ride said oh yeah Roger ride ll do it said whos gonna play my part He said Bruce dern said great know dernsy Bruce dern We just had like eight actors and the rest were all extras But the extras made the movie because they had the machines and they were what the movie was about And they were real hells angels guys They were terrible They were frightening Dern We all rode our bikes down the in the desert And he filmed it along the way But he didnt get a police escort or anything like that He got no permits We just did it It was the beginning of what you know now as real guerilla filmmaking You know Rogers a guy whos not gonna miss an opportunity to take advantage of every single thing he can shoot At one point there was supposed to be a kind of a fight between the hells angels and the townies We didnt have enough townies so Roger turns to me and he says you run in there be a townie So run in and within seconds the angels were beating the shit out of me All did was go right down to the ground and just prayed for cut Dem When work was over you never saw Roger He didnt go to dinner He didnt you didnt know what he did As close as we were to him on that picture and we were literally his only friends mean not that nobody liked him but he was just didnt reach out toward friendship And he remained mysterious But tell me just what is it that you want to do Well we want to be free We want to be free to do what we want to do We want to be free to ride We want to be free to ride our machines without being hassled by the man And we want to get loaded Crowd Yeah Man second the motion Dern remember asking him oh about the third or fourth day of the wild angels said how many of these things have you done He said this is my th This is years ago and this was his th movie he directed Oh my god The film was really an incredible success It was the biggestgrossing independent film ever made at that time Bogdanovich The wild angels was a tremendous success It was a huge hit It galvanized the whole underground culture Dern And that changed his persona and changed the perception of Peter Fonda thought this is wonderful This is saving me from becoming the next Dean Jones for Disney which is what my agents thought that should be that Roger felt that i had helped him and contributed something to it And he called me and he said would you like to direct your own picture And said yes He said all right We have a Russian science fiction picture And aip will buy it but they wont buy it unless put some women in it Theres no women in it Its all men walking around Venus But what am supposed to do Roger He said look at the picture and just decide where to put the women Okay sure Weve got mamie Van doren and shell be one of the women Get a couple of other women and just put them in the picture And no sound Dont write any dialogue dont want to pay for sound And had to explain to mamie that there would be no dialogue She said then what do we do said you look meaningfully at one of the other girls And then the other girl will immediately react So you look at her and the other girl goes And goes Telepathy mamie its telepathy We cut this thing together screened it for Jim Nicholson and he said what the fuck is this about What are they doing They keep looking and then the other lts telepathy Jim Lts bullshit He says i dont know what Roger says you have to put voices in Meriama wearie Bogdanovich Go get the shells Yes Ptera is a false god Roger is the kind of person who says do you know how to swim Noii and throws you in the water And if you learn to swim because you dont want to drown youre fine And if you drown thats the end of that Doel think he was alert that this was a time when things were beginning to change Certainly there werent movies being made reflecting the changes in the thinking of young people And think that Roger was alert to that What was going on really was revolutionary smoked pot at work Doel Sex drugs rock n roll It was blowing up Doel Vietnam Platt thought it was the end of America Dern looked at this guy in a cardigan sweater talking about mayhem in the streets was probably the straightest guy in a fairly wild movement Doel His political views were becoming increasingly left as he said at the time almost communist which always makes me laugh because of course i dont buy that for a minute but understand what he means For someone who seems so square on the outside he was actually a very interesting cool hip director may have felt at the beginning of the s that was an underdog but as we got into the s thought hey m with the new movement Nicholson By now Roger and are in sync Hey the mans supporting my whole life How could not be in sync with him He asked me to write the wild angels cause was writing by then said Roger you know were pals in this Cant you just pay me a little more than scale If hed just said all right scale plus would have relaxed No And didnt write it To write the trip though he finally said all right Cut Its good here How was it for second camera Man Fine here Okay print it Corman When decided to make the trip about felt as a director i cannot make a film about without trying Initially the idea was that would take notes on Rogers trip think he believed that he would be able to coherently dictate notes to me How high are you man Can you tell that Listen think m afraid Theres nothing to be afraid of man had had a wonderful trip a spectacular trip felt to be fair had to have some experiences of people whod had bad trips Luckily Jack Nicholson was a very good writer and he knew Cause was special talent Only he and had actually taken at the point never did it for fun too strong mean a lot of my friends did but baby mean what you want to confront the face of god literally for fun Come on m Peter Fonda Weve just finished making a movie dealing with the most talkedabout subject of the day honestly believe that it will be todays most talkedabout motion picture Nicholson Rogers a serious moviemaker He wanted to make a serious film about which had just changed the culture forever really Thats what the movie is about Scorsese The artistry of the films really developed By the time he did the trip he really had a sense of pushing the power of the image What he hit upon in that picture was interesting particularly if you see it in the full aspect ratio because it just cuts through time and space It becomes really a beautiful kind of cinematic montage and achieves a kind of poetry Aip were really concerned that this was a prodrug movie and they would lose money because of that Its easy now Wait till tomorrow Yeah well ll think about that tomorrow Arkoff and Nicholson changed the ending on the picture without telling Roger They froze frame and did an optical of broken glass on that What is power You understand He created these guys This set me up because in easy rider the first thing we do is we buy junk in Mexico smuggle it across the border get a lot of money put it in the tank off we go Corman Easy rider came out of my films the wild angels and the trip Peter Fonda starred in both pictures and Dennis hopper costarred in the trip That whole thing came from Roger to me take the establishment on And since they had never made a picture they wanted me to be the executive producer And said fine And took the idea to aip because the wild angels and the trip had been very successful And in one unfortunate meeting one of the executives at aip said to Dennis lf you fall more than one day behind schedule we want the right to replace you could see that Dennis and Peter were really mad Fonda And said i cant put that pressure on hoppy Thats not fair And Roger agreed Corman And said to this executive he worked perfectly with me on the trip and am positive he can do this And that was not a good thing to say number of things happened and the picture moved over to Columbia And aip and lost our percentage of the profits on one of the most successful independent pictures ever made Oh Oh what am gonna do now Nicholson When went to cannes with easy rider Oh my head my character came on the screen and the movie exploded in that audience It just went kapow like it does in rock n roll m the only person who ever in real life felt holy shit m a movie star do you know what mean And knew So thats what the change felt like experienced it right here Roger if you paid me over minimum you would have had easy rider Bogdanovich Easy rider was the beginning of the new Hollywood Its hard to imagine the new Hollywood without Roger corman So many people started with Roger Francis coppola and Bobby de niro and Jack Nicholson And the list goes on and on At the end of the s Hollywood was so desperate They didnt know what to do And the young Roger corman alumni were there to step into the breach Dern Jacks career took off And Peter and Dennis got deals at universal to make their movies Well those are all offshoots of the university of corman Roger was in a perfect position having discovered and cultivated Francis coppola bogdanovich so many other people like that always wondered why Roger couldnt take that next step with those guys You had to take that leap You had to go from high school to college or you had to go from college to grad school It was a jump that Roger never really took And thats the one place that Roger left out of his mix And thats why hes constantly being insulted by people calling him the king of the bs right Dante Roger was never taken seriously He was a schlockmeister and a guy who did drivein movies He never really got his due i dont think mean even the lntruder which is one of his best pictures it was a movie that was hardly ever seen anywhere when it came out Dern Every year at the academy awards they give out a lifetime achievement award How they can not have gotten to Roger corman by now is disgusting And dont know that they ever will because theyd say well what are the great movies he made guess this proves there are as many nuts in the academy as anywhere else Nicholson Ls Roger worried about being underappreciated If he is m going over there tomorrow night Shark Shark Help Cut cut cut Eli roth Roger corman isnt doing it for the awards The fans recognize him The filmmakers recognize him We know who he is and we appreciate him And dont think he needs some statue from some organization that never liked his movies in the first place to come out and say we love you Julie From my viewpoint everything is going extremely well Observing Roger however now as actorproducer Kevin youre aware theyre putting a mic on the girl whos not in the shot Maybe the kit should be just a couple of inches there so you dont step over it No wait until she comes here Stop Itll be after they say action Because the cameras on her and its going to come around and see Okay and were out of the shot He is always noticing what needs to be fixed what is the problem but thats the nature of producing Okay so m looking here And on action you say theres someone here to see you Man Rolling sound Paul w Anderson You would think that a man who makes so many films kind of doesnt really care about each individual film but think Roger for each of his movies theyre like his children you know And he loves every single one of them And hes so engaged in every single one of them And you know the last time i had lunch with him you know he had to hurry away cause he was going back to the cutting room of minotaur And its like you know Roger Theyre really its just way too much time spent on iva Theyre working on her makeup all the time Explain who she should put it on They cant do this stuff for every shot Mary woronov ll never forget Julie She was like amazing She was talking about redecorating her house And then she had a child in a crib She was raising children you know And here she was she was known to do movies even cheaper than Roger corman mean this woman was amazing The first film that produced i didnt think of it as producing didnt put a name to it just thought oh this needs to be organized Roger did sit with me for about minutes and go through whats needed the cast the crew and what the positions were and a way in which to Shepherd production through But then thought well hell be there every day and could no he wasnt really available And there was this sense had of he just thinks i can do this And then just did it But he will recognize in someone that he thinks they can do whatever it is And then he just walks away and they do it Corman first met Julie when she answered an ad for a job as my assistant offered her the job She turned down the job but she agreed to have dinner with me We began dating and we also began working together Roger had by then asked me to marry him and had said yes And then he went off to the Philippines and didnt hear from him for a week So was like i wonder what that means So called him and said are we still getting married He said oh yes Did you pick a date And said well was thinking of December or maybe later in the spring Oh definitely December Sooner better right said okay just wonder why you didnt call me Well he didnt call me because it was a longdistance call so it wouldnt have occurred to him But anyway you know getting to know each other All right now everybody reach for the nightgown of the lord Reach Anybody moves youre dead Julie Roger had done bloody mama with shelley winters and Bobby de niro And you know it was a great success for aip And aip wanted another woman gangster movie And so found this book It was the story of a woman whod been something of a tramp a hobo had ridden the boxcars of the railroads of the United States during the depression It was her story as a rebel as a prefeminist as it were and as an outlaw Boxcar Bertha the first picture that Julie worked on with me as coproducer It was also the first picture that Marty scorsese directed met him and he said look have a sequel to bloody mama its called boxcar Bertha Would you be interested in doing it said absolutely you know And bloody mama actually had de niro in it see By the time we got to Camden Arkansas Marty had sketched every shot of the picture which was all over the walls of his motel room took out all these drawings about And he looked at the first or or something And then he looked he said did you do this for the entire picture said yeah He said all right He put it away and he left Run Bertha God damn that bitch Carradine The thing that Roger hated was when Sam arkoff came in cause he needed Sam because the budget was too big for him And then Sam kind of took over and masterminded the release in a way that Roger didnt like And Roger said m never gonna do this again And thats when he formed new world and he went back to making movies and worked his way back up again just simply so that nobody could tell him you know how he should cut his movie or how he should release it Doel Roger somehow is fueled by outwitting would say even more than rebelling against authority He was that way with aip think actually it brings out his creativity and his drive It just seems to fire him up to just show them that he will do it himself He doesnt need them to tell him how to do it or what to do decided to start a small productiondistribution company a little bit the way aip had started in the late s Roger is a brilliant producer in terms of knowing what the market is anticipating the trends and then capitalizing on them He was a trendsetter for years mean he in the s he set every trend He has the idea the original idea for almost all the films that are produced by new world pictures He had a somewhat finite audience They werent expecting things to be held over You know things played for two weeks in the grindhouses and a couple weeks at the drivein and then a new thing came in But within that you were gonna have a very loyal audience of young people Announcer Hollywood boulevard the street where starlets are made On Monday candy came to Hollywood On Tuesday she lost her blouse On Thursday she massacred rebel soldiers On Friday she found out the bullets were real On Saturday she married Godzilla By Sunday she was a star Things happen fast on Hollywood boulevard Rated r Hello Hollywood The fact that the rating system came in was a tremendous change Now you were allowed to do things in movies that you hadnt been allowed to do before You were allowed to show things Announcer What they did to her in Jackson county was a crime Yvette mimieux Jackson county jail where the cops make their own laws and the only way out is murder Were cop killers There are s exploitation pictures that are really out there mean they have plot twists that are like whoa i didnt see that coming didnt think people did that in the movies Announcer Woman was made for man to hunt Dante Roger certainly took amazing advantage of that Announcer Hunters competing for the game Set your sights on the tastiest game from new world pictures Rogers operation is an exploitation operation on almost every level He exploits directors He exploits writers He exploits people in the crafts who are trying to get established But we are also exploiting Roger Julie think he had a lot of fun working with these young people And so it was often known as you know the corman school of filmmaking Demme The first time met Roger this crazy Roger Germany thing happened where he said okay you can write press releases Do you think you could write a screenplay And this had never really occurred to me but said yes And he said let me explain m starting a new company Its called new world pictures need a bunch of pictures to go into the works very soon He wanted a nurse movie but he also wanted to crossbreed it with a prison movie Announcer Four American nurses snatched from their work in a foreign hospital jumped in the jungle caught between a killcrazed revolutionary and a sexcrazed major Roger says exploitation pictures dont need plots But they need sensational things like girls shooting filipinos out of trees That works In new world they very often go back and add action to a picture Cause youll see how a rough cut plays and Roger almost always wants you to add another chase or at least another explosion Rock rock rock rock rock n roll high school rock rock rock rock rock n roll high school Announcer Rock n roll high school the school where the students rule Could your school be next We knew the genre notes that we had to hit And if we hit those notes what we put in between those notes was entirely up to us Grand Theft Auto is a love story with cars Also its a comedy with car crashes Announcer Grand Theft Auto directed by and starring Ron Howard Well hell We had a very limited number of extras that we were allowed to have at the big demolition derby climactic action scenes And called Roger asking for more extras to fill out the stands cause said this is supposed to be this huge event Theres a big riot at the end You know extras is gonna fill exactly you know of the stands Its gonna look cheesy And he said no And he could see was dejected And he smiled and he put his hand on my shoulder in a kind of fatherly way And he said Ron heres what you need to understand You do a good job for me on my terms on this movie and you never have to work for me again And well didnt certainly wish that Roger would move out of the formula film the exploitation film guess that he just feels that as long as hes investing his own money that he wants it to be surefire Carradine In death race at the very beginning behind us theres a city of the future And it is so obviously a painting Its almost a cartoon And said that to him and he said people come to my pictures looking for camp And m going to give it to them Lf he just violated this rule of his of never making a movie that cost more than million you know and make one for million or million said look all your pictures make money None of them go through the top And he said yeah thats true And then he went over and turned off the air conditioner Sometimes the movies were really dreadful and you had to just sort of camp them up and make fun of them Cover girl models And we did by the time we got to cover girl models we were doing outrageous ad lines you know they dont need clothes to strike a pose theyre always overexposed but theyre never underdeveloped to the point where the pictures looked like jokes They didnt look like they were real movies Theyre like movies in the front of tropic thunder They just didnt look real But the audiences never minded They were happy The limitations of a lowbudget film can work positively in terms of getting something spontaneous Theres no time for rehearsal Theres no time for extended discussions of motivation and character and so forth And indeed there arent many characters or motivations in any of the films Youll never be a star now you little cunt Dante The great thing about working for Roger was that every possible obstacle to making a movie was thrown in front of you Beverly hills police And if you could figure out a way to get around them you could make your movie At the end credits of Hollywood boulevard that background shot was shot while the camera crew was hiding in the bushes and was talking to the Beverly hills police and explaining that was just out here admiring the scenery And they said well get back in your car and drive down the hill Its not as bad as John Davis and having to spend the night in jail while making fly me though think when he called Roger and he said m in jail think Roger said well you know thats a good experience You should learn from this Blossom honey You philandering fornicating bastard you went off with that skinny honky for two days and gonna come back here and call me honey Now wait a minute blossom honey told you was gonna cut it off if you tried to pull that shit on me We called it make do You know whatever you can do to make do thats what we did And from it i lived through my stunts look back at it would do them again Yes but more padding on the head Not a lot of women wanted to do stunts All right everybody back em up Grier And they couldnt handle guns They were afraid of guns Sit down on the floor Where do you want to be buried nigger And its miss nigger to you Grier And there werent a lot of women who wanted to be tossed around the room or thrown over a cliff And he said lets keep her doing movies She loves to do crazy stuff Lets set her on fire You know how many cars can she crash today They loved that He could talk you into you know buying some sand in a desert Hey and itll taste good too m like excuse me did just buy this glass of sand from Roger Announcer The final comedown this years heaviest motion picture Baby m not bitter was bitter years ago m violent you hear me god damn it Violent Announcer Get hip to this years winner the fight youve been dying for Rated r its a mother Dig it did bring mean streets first to Roger And it was the beginning of the blaxploitation pictures And he said so the story is interesting and everything Its really interesting can give you a couple hundred thousand dollars to do it but if you could swing a little bit and make it black it might be we might have something here So thought about it said okay let me think about it wouldnt say no always say yes to these things And walked out and realized my heart sank because realized no theyre ItalianAmericans Thats the part of the cultural thing Its sicilians and neapolitans and ancient code that goes back to the medieval times Youre a fucking jerkoff And ll tell you something else Mikey fuck you right where you breathe cause dont give two shits about you or nobody else said thats totally not m not gonna be able to do it But because of boxcar Bertha and because of the group that worked on the film learned how to make the picture within a certain amount of time And we were able to take the same principles that we applied to boxcar Bertha and use them for mean streets We wound up shooting most of it in Los Angeles because we had that crew and the corman crew knew how to work Dante Rogers own personal taste in pictures is very different from the type of pictures that he makes And also his taste in directors tends towards antonioni and bergman Corman Most of our films are domestic However we do distribute a number of foreign films bergman fellini truffaut now kurosawa and a number of others Dante Roger had a lot of connections and he had his own distribution company And when the majors started to give up on foreign films Roger talked people like ingmar bergman and fellini into i can get your picture on screens that have never run a movie of yours because have a different audience and a different way of selling the movie And they all signed off on it Ingmar bergman was a seminal influence on Roger as a director Cries and whispers did extremely well and ingmar bergman was very pleased And then Roger being Roger he had the idea to distribute it in driveins And thats what he did No one else had ever been able to do that before and probably not since That was something new for Roger to have such prestige people associated with him And it just went from there Roger when he formed new world pictures was the first company that was completely bifurcated In other words in one direction they were doing exploitation films but in the other direction they were doing the best foreignlanguage films that were out there at that time Corman The money is secondary in that particular area Its because feel these films should get to a larger audience than they do Announcer The new fellini amarcord Corman The company is building very rapidly which takes a lot of time My wife and have had three children in three consecutive summers which takes a certain amount of time We would go home in the evening and talk about the problems of the day Then there got to be a time when we like just didnt talk about what had happened during the day But it got to be a little embarrassing because Roger didnt really know what all was doing and didnt really know what all he was doing And said look Roger its very embarrassing when people say what movies is Roger making and dont know You know it is our company but theres what youre making and what m making And so he said well ll tell you what m making He said m making films And he couldnt remember the last two So he said well whatever they are m gonna cancel them Reporter You had made a statement to the press that you were getting out of exploitation films and into higherbudget films What brought you back into it In my last years as a director was climbing out of the lowbudget field and was doing more expensive films but when started my own company which was financed essentially out of my own savings was forced back to lowbudget films because those were all could afford New world has had several profitable years and were now starting to make more expensive films and were climbing once more Rogers had such success with new world pictures in the past couple of years that now people are dying to invest in his movies And if a script is going around town which has his endorsement on it and a promise that he will distribute it youre in fabulous shape Theres an old story about the producer with a successful Broadway play And his friend comes to him and says heres the way we can fix the second act And the producer says never around with a winner Roger came bounding up the stairs And he said Ron youre here Have you heard the news said no Great news Grand Theft Auto which was a very successful movie for him Grand Theft Auto just sold to Its the first time weve ever sold a movie to the networks for million And said well thats great Roger He said lts fantastic That makes your look awfully good Cause had a little profit participation in Grand Theft Auto said yeah it does He said it makes my look goddamn wonderful Open up the sky open up the sky cause m coming up to you m coming up to you so send down your wings so send down your wings and let them bring me to you and bring me to you get on up big bird to my babys love get on up big bird to my babys love get on up big bird cause ve got to make it just get on up big bird cause ve got to make it get on up big bird get on up big bird get on up big bird get on up big bird get on up big bird just get on up big bird get on up big bird Announcer There is a creature alive today It lives to kill a mindless eating machine It is as if god created the devil and gave him jaws The blockbuster movie of the summer is jaws the tale of a murderous white shark The recordbreaking box office receipts created by jaws the movie jaws Some people who have seen it are now seeing phantom sharks every time Steven Spielberg Time magazine seldom When that movie was released Announcer See it before you go swimming When Steven Spielberg made jaws he took a very cormanesque idea you know the killer shark mean it doesnt get any more corman than that killer shark eating naked girls as they go skinnydipping Roth Once people got a taste of movies like jaws they really didnt want the drivein movies anymore They stopped going They wanted to go to the theaters and be part of some cultural phenomenon that everyone was talking about and everyone was going to see And it wasnt about taking your girl to the drivein And then everything kind of changed on the day star wars came out Yeah We went to an show right over at the Chinese and it was extraordinary When these lines appeared Yeah everybody was astounded mean they couldnt understand Jaws it was like okay its a bestseller and we sort of know thats gonna make a lot of money But star wars came from nowhere And all of a sudden this gigantic change happened It was just like the easy rider change It was like going to a revival meeting That first screening just was amazing Corman When saw star wars said this is a threat to me because it means that the major studios are beginning to understand what weve been doing for or so and theyre now doing it for multimillions of dollars And its going to be very difficult for us to compete Corman felt the major studios are hitting straight into what has been my bread and butter for years and also the staple of many of my compatriots McCarthy Jaws and then star wars set a whole new standard mean just the bar got set higher You couldnt really get away with doing cheap science fiction films anymore Nicholson hated star wars Lf star wars doesnt make a ton of cabbage you know wed still be having these weird green flashing lines going across the screen All these guys are coming from film school Were all coming from let us get a job He did it first with horror pictures with science fiction pictures which he did for no money and you know quickly and unpretentiously Thats who we are today And miss the Roger corman versions What we see now is the tent poles of the studios The summer and Christmas tent poles are very often films that could have been done by Roger corman at a much smaller budget But those are the films now that are attracting the top filmmakers and the biggest budgets And what has the wonderful revolution done for independence of filmmaking Well we make circuses a year and very few movies When you read that a picture cost million to make what do you think of that cost Actually think its wrong think the artist should be able to express himself for less money than that And the businessman should be able to invest his money better think from both an artistic and a commercial standpoint it is wrong to spend that much money And in addition think there are better things to do with the money in our society For example You could for million or million which is what some of these films are costing you could rebuild a portion of the slums of a city just as one example Mmhmm mmhmm So you think its obscene to spend that much money Yes would use that word Once the star wars juggernaut thing happened and the idea that everything had to be an event movie it just became difficult The business changed He ended up having to go direct to video with a lot of the stuff Theres just billion shelves with billion Ds and its very hard to stick out He switched over to making slasher movies And that was a very limited genre so it was harder to make something that was interesting in that genre met him at a dinner party in New York in the early s And said arent you gonna do any more Are you gonna direct a few more He said i dont think so The whole scene is changing screwdrivers going into peoples heads It just doesnt it doesnt i dont belong there anymore George hickenlooper think hes become more obscure And think thats too bad because think he really has a very important legacy in Hollywood When a lot of his stuff went straight to think he lost a little bit of his mystique and cachet Penelope spheeris If you walked up to any yearold film buff and asked if they knew who Roger was think unfortunately they probably dont Gosh mean how many other people have made movies you know If he hadnt done seven million other pictures hed have the same reputation as any of the other artistes Snyder Are the people with whom youve worked over the years still friendly with you Do they like you Do they call you on the phone now and again and say hi Roger How is it going think so still talk with them Careers move in different directions but most of them are still friends of mine They use words with you like forgive me the schlockmeister Does that bother you when they say those things Yes Does it Yeah it bothers me right It should Youre just trying Roth Roger corman made it okay for all of us to make exploitation movies He showed that you shouldnt be embarrassed Theres nothing wrong with you for loving a movie like piranha That it doesnt mean that youre stupid for loving a movie that seems like a stupid exploitation movie And that a lot of these films are very smart made with lots of intelligence and that its okay to have fun at the movies think its very important to let the generation of today know who he is We all we knew it almost years ago So its time to reintroduce him as a director but also what he represents of American entertainment He represents a side of Hollywood sort of unto his own you know You know there are a lot of Samuel goldwyns a lot of Irving thalbergs Theres really only one Roger corman That style of filmmaking that attitude that approach to filmmaking really is unparalleled You know know its right to have the tie handtied but frankly the pretied ties look better because theyre perfect guess the whole idea is if its slightly imperfect its considered to be handmade Julie Yes Theres delight in disorder Right Now There you go Okay Were gonna give the lifetime achievement award to Roger corman And theyve asked me to be part of it got to call him And said to him the board of governors of the motion picture academy has voted to give you an honorary Oscar for your life achievement And there was silence He wasnt he goes excuse me Thats unbelievable The funny part is of course that Roger is you know the ultimate fierce independent So told him yes said i know when you get up there youre really gonna stick it to the man Howard Roger if you could stand d like to offer you a toast For all your progressive influence in our medium and for our industry its our honor to salute you tonight Roger Hear hear Tarantino The academy thanks you Hollywood thanks you Independent filmmaking thanks you But most importantly for all the wild weird cool crazy moments youve put on the drivein screens the movie lovers of the planet earth thank you He is one of the finest personages in our field Roger please come up to accept your Oscar Needless to say m delighted to accept this Oscar personally but d also like to accept it on behalf of my wife Julie whos been my my producing partner for many years think that to succeed in this world you have to take chances believe the finest films being done today are done by the original innovative filmmakers who have the courage to take a chance and to gamble So say to you keep gambling Keep taking chances Thank you When think of sort of sublime moments in my professional life think of winning an academy award and right next to it is the wrap party for Grand Theft Auto Actually everybody grab for it Howard d always dreamed of making a movie and Roger let me make a movie And not only did make it loved it more than ever dreamed might Is this sort of like the way you get an honorary degree at Harvard Am an honorary member of the Roger corman school of filmmaking You know dont know m actually a little tonguetied when m with Roger just have you know were completely different kind of people And have such respect for him You know every once in a while Roger would come to my rescue pretty much you know when things were nothing was happening Polly platt My husband left me and the phone stopped ringing but the only person who called me was Roger And he said you can direct a picture any time you want ll produce it for you So hes the only person who called me Demme Well put them on our Facebook pages mean theres nobody in there that he didnt in the most important way support He was you know my main connec my lifeblood to whatever thought i was gonna be s a person And you know i hope he knows that this is not all hot air m gonna cry now Not just me whos very sentimental but these other people also love him ml corman Mike ivejust gotten off the phone with syfy Theyre very worried about the climax of the script They believe the Mayan dance sequence in the jungle is not big enough m going to make the stage bigger and bring in almost a Mayan village rather than a temple He wants to stay in the game To some extent he does see making movies as a game a game that you can win or lose And staying in means that youre winning Julie These are for splatter Oh for splatter okay Yes He really epitomized whats wonderful about the American dream that you can succeed no matter what Even if you fail you can reinvent yourself Anderson If you love it and youre allowed to keep working or you have the energy to keep working as Roger does there is no retirement age No one kind of gives you your gold watch and tells you to go home because your careers over Lets go back cut on the frame after she exits the shot barn Right there Theres an arab Maxim which is the dogs bark but the caravan moves on And this is Roger to me as the caravan you know Hes making the decision and moving forward And youre saying but wait a minute you havent thought about what the actors will think And what about if the truck isnt available Were gonna shoot this here now
