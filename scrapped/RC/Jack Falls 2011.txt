individual you are These are not the qualities we expect in a police officer You offered the facade that you were part of the thin blue line that divides decent society from lawless feckless and dangerous people As lawabiding citizens we have the right to expect the utmost professionalism honour and commitment to duty from those we assign to protect us Regarding the death of Mr Alan Carter it is apparent that you showed no mercy or remorse It is for that reason that must impose the maximum sentence available to me Society must be protected from individuals as dangerous as yourself sentence you to life imprisonment with a minimum term of years Take him down knew he couldnt resist seeing it all firsthand And that meant hed be in a particular place at a particulartime That was all needed Fuck Shit Boss Boss Fuck Get me an ambulance now Emergency assistance required at the courthouse need backup shots fired Its all yours just need a little bit for the life insurance Youre asking to
