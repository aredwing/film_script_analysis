Youre expecting Were expecting and you know you went off those meds Thats what happens Come on Theres nothing Come to bed You are not crazy Think of all the tweakers running around this area It just it felt so real You have to listen to your intuition And who knows Maybe it could be your mommy sense kicking in Oh mommy sense Is that like Spidey sense Kind of One time when was a baby my sister was giving me a bath and left me in there with the water running and my mom was downstairs running the vacuum obviously couldnt hear anything But she just got this feeling you know She ran upstairs and there was underwater drowning She just knew Mommy sense Yeah its mommy sense or its something more than that was in a car accident about a year ago They said it wasnt my fault but there was a mother and a baby in the other car and the baby didnt make it m so sorry Thats so awful Jesus Christ tried to reach out to the other family but they didnt take my calls and cant say blame them Anyway then David put me on an antidepressant because well felt like was losing my mind Obviously that stopped once found out was pregnant Yes Good m glad You shouldnt be putting those chemicals into your body anyway know You cant keep punishing yourself over something that is not your fault Thank you for being a friend How bout get you a chocolate mousse huh d have a cookie David Whos there Its me Who is

Yeah Leo runs a a artisanal olive oil business Right Yeah We were talking about it and just dont want any misunderstandings You guys should come by and check it out Okay Thanks for stopping by Appreciate it Yeah yeah See you guys around All right know what saw know This isnt just seeing things These are major hallucinations were talking about The hooded guy a gun This is what we discussed Eveleigh Your pregnant body is basically a cocktail of competing hormones m not taking any drugs But you were on medication for nearly half a year after the accident and it could help you deal with your symptoms And felt like a zombie and wasnt pregnant There are very few side effects with this You dont need to worry about that This is a very common antidepressant But m not depressed And we dont know for sure there are zero side effects Nobody knows Evey we cant live like this cant live like this want you to promise me that if you have one more hallucination you go back on your medication David we have to put the baby first now m gonna give this a minute to open up m not sure ever drank anything that needed to open up Drunk Whatever Were on more of a Two Buck Chuck budget ourselves Thats all right So when are you gonna get this winery up and running Were close The problem out here though is rain The vines really should have shoots by now but ve been bringing in two water trucks a week since we took over Water trucks that sucks Isnt this supposed to be like the worst drought in decades Okay maybe dont rub it in Ben Just sayin Its Okay What about you Eveleigh How do you like the place Evey Sorry what Shes been a little out of it recently so Well imagine how out of it ll be when m medicated David Sorry didnt mean to ruin the vibe But you cant take medication youre pregnant Thank you Ben why dont show you the winery think the ladies have had enough of us Yeah Yeah m sorry Dont wander off too far We dont want to send a search party for you Yes your majesty m sorry just did that No Ben seems sweet Yeah think hes a keeper Sorry dont mean to pry but what is this about putting you on medication Antidepressants No you cant let them do that to you Dr Mathison says its safe What do you think think there is something wrong here and dont think m imagining it Thats your mommy sense Right now your protective instincts theyre at an all time high so if something happened in this house youre way more receptive to it What do you mean mean think this house might be haunted Well m disappointed that the house isnt living up to your expectations Thats the understatement of the year m sorry Glenn just need to know everything there is to know about the vineyard Hmmm Yeah did every search could think of Police logs real estate disclosures and there is nothing No history of violence natural disasters agricultural accidents or any event that might be at the root of your paranormal activity m actually surprised to hear you complain because most people would love to be able to say that their house was haunted by the spirits of the old wine makersblah blah blah It adds to the romance What about the ruins behind the house It looked like there used to be a big old house there Going back years nothing that could see no Its been zoned for agriculture the entire time until the Porters got their building permit to convert the stable into a house Try looking them up That would be my recommendation Its been a pleasure ladies and you let me know if can do any more ghostbusting for you Hello Eveleigh So nice to finally meet you No Dont No No No Why are you here No Honestly Eileen wish youd been there It was terrifying Maybe it was a playing in a neighbors house Sometimes your eyes and ears can play tricks on you when youre alone for too long Look just think you have to consider the most reasonable explanations first Sweetheart Davids home ve gotta go Have a wonderful time in Paris All right m gonna miss you Take care and focus on your work ll see you in a few months Oh tell David what happened Yeah right All right fly safe Bye love Hey honey How was today replaced all the posts on the north slope had to chase off some more of those raccoons too Whatre you up to just spoke to Eileen and shes off to Paris Honey how much do you know about the Porters Not much guys in prison Why Dont you think its weird that we dont know anything about the people that lived in this house before us what might have happened here Not really Whats going on What if what m feeling is not and its not hormonal and its something else Like what Something supernatural dont know Sweetheart lets not even go there Thats the last thing you need right now David what if something terrible happened back in the days of the old house So like what its a ghost that only you can see Maybe because of my pregnancy Maybe m getting dont know a sixth sense Listen to me for a second You went through something really tragic last year and that would be traumatic for anyone sweetheart and you have nothing to feel guilty about Okay come here Come on Everythings gonna be okay All right You promise Yeah listen Soon as the baby gets here this is all gonna seem like a bad dream Okay No no What did you just do What Do what Do what God Evey This isnt right If cant make you see that then dont know what else to say Evey Evey Sweetheart Are you okay What happened No dont think theres

Ehmwell uhm My great grandfather built the place in Family lore has it that soon after they moved in they began experiencing these strange events these whistling sounds and pounding on doors Things they couldnt explain Did they ever find out why it was happening dont know You know all this was told to me when was a little boy by my grandmother In any case they eventually moved out and my greatgrandmother lit the place on fire If she couldnt live there she didnt want anybody else to live there either You know theres something that perhaps you would like to see Let me go and get that My great grandmother was a tough cookie and she wasnt gonna let go of the house easily so she hired a medium to cleanse the place Now the story goes is that the medium went into a trance to try to contact the spirits that were trapped in the house And these are some of the sketches she did David Thats David David its us medium saw us living in the house Whatre you talking about ve got the
