highly highly doubt That theyd deal with it by selling us synthetic blood It makes me so mad The way were forced to live mean this isnt their world its our world Theyre just passing through Its not our world We may never die but collectively Well were the ones forced to hide We are the monsters cant abide any more of this selfloathing We know what the situation is We discuss it all the time Were at the beginning of creating a civilization For ourselves Just like they did when they realized that Killing and raping on a regular basis was not a fulfilling Way to live dont want to hear the term monsters Were all monsters Potentially you know potentially not Yes but one has to ask oneself Does the existence of dr Jekyll make mr Hyde any less Of a monster think that the point we all have come to realize HansIs that what civilization is is a set of moral laws And if those laws are broken there will be punishment Humans still break them But for the most part These laws have forced them to value humanity To develop sensitivity Which is just as real in them as their baser impulses mean those laws Have freed them to experience their little lives The way we havent been able to dont like them dont find them touching the way you seem to dont find you touching They are the best audiences can tell you that Vampires are notorious for golf applause Xenia jesus The ultimate barometer for
