and are both very lucky with Women Shes wonderful But she We dont have to talk Lets find you something to read No its just between us Of course m worried about her think she has a little problem Oh

But she doesnt realize that She takes it personally And things You know it hurts her feelings dont know what to do about that Do you But its such a comfort sometimes just to have somebodys arms around you dont you think No mon it feels good It does not feel good It hurts Like a cut or a bruise Like a burn Like like when you go outside and your feet freeze and then you come back in and they thaw out Its like that Its almost exactly like that Same with everybody m not really with Bianca But everyone else So you dont let people touch you Lars isnt that hard to get away with m not really here
