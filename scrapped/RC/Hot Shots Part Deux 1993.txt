Good evening Americans were shocked today by the announcement of the failure of yet another mission to rescue our hostages from the Middle East Informed sources reveal that the rescue team itself has been captured and added to those already being held Preliminary reports also indicate that an attempt on the life of a terrorist dictator was thwarted at the same time With the presidential election just days away this could be a setback for the White House Presidential challenger Senator Gray Edwards campaigning in Chattanooga commented on the failed mission This is no time for partisan politics Bringing our people home should be the nations number one priority Despite this current crisis the president is putting on his best political face Continuing on his campaign schedule Bensons point lead in the polls months ago has plummeted since the hostage crisis began Victorias Secret catalog poll now has the president and Edwards running neck and neck This afternoon Benson made a brief stop in Fergus Falls Virginia for the groundbreaking of his presidential library The five living former chief executives Presidents Bush Reagan Carter Ford and Nixon were on hand for this groundbreaking ceremony White House correspondent Jeri Kelter reports on this historic moment The library is to be built adjacent to the Fergus Falls Civic Center President Benson made no statements as he went about his business Publicly it seemed as though he was unaware of the political blow he had been dealt Privately aides marveled at his spirit as he performed his usual morning routine by milking the White House goats and finishing a second helping of grapefruit and creamed corn Tonight the president and his top advisors will be burning the midnight oil Sabotage My God man what does it mean We have to tighten security sir find out whos behind it No no no The word sabotage whats it mean Someones trying to subvert our mission One of our own people could be working with the enemy Banging Pipe Come in
