Let me tell you something The has direct Communist ties Even great men can be corrupted cant they Communism is not a political party Lt is a disease Lt corrupts the soul turning even the gentlest of men into vicious evil tyrants What we are seeing is a pervasive contempt for law and order Crime rates are soaring Theres widespread open defiance of our authority and mark my words if this goes unchecked it will once again plunge our nation into the depths of anarchy Lt all starts out peacefully doesnt it Mr Irwin You have to live with the fact that you couldve helped prevent the bombings and the violence m more interested in what this says about your have worked too long and hard to just sit back and watch the bad guys capture the spotlight again havent The funny thing about notoriety especially the kind that needs adoration fame for fames sake if unchecked it inevitably leads to villainy suggest you look at what this squabble is really about before you destroy the reputation of the thing we both know you love most Sir the writers here from Crime Records the Department Set him up with a typewriter in my outer office Miss Gandy its time this generation learn my side of the story Right away Thank you In Agent Smith my first boss here at the Department of Justice was Attorney General Mitchell Palmer He was a Quaker He didnt believe in war but he understood the necessity of strength and resolve Believe what you will from historians most write from a present perspective forgetting context Mitchell Palmer was a hero Are you all right Unh Are you all right Yes think Yes Lts all right Come here lts all right its all right No its okay Are you okay lts okay Are you okay You see Palmer fought the radicals just as have And just as have he was targeted He wasnt alone Across the country that night eight bombs exploded all at pm Two United States senators four cabinet members a Supreme Court justice John Rockefeller Morgan all of them targeted by Bolshevik Communists Yeah it shook the whole thing It was clear to me the radicals bomb went off too soon leaving only his blood in the street But the inspectors used buckets to clean up the mess instead of collecting it They discarded his gun instead of preserving its prints But you see this wasnt clumsy police work In those times it was normal procedure This may be the end of days for this country Dwight lt was before anyone respected criminal science before federal powers before the It was that night my eyes were opened That very night Ls he a neighbor sir No He works in my office There will have to be murder We will kill because it is necessary We will destroy to rid the world of your tyrannical institutions You were at Attorney General Palmers home that night Well lets leave that to the readers imagination You see its important we give our protagonist a bit of mystery could allude to a young man who matches your description The best of both worlds Where did you get your law degree George Washington grew up here had a mom to take care of so stayed close received an English degree there also Then dont need to tell you that what determines a mans legacy is often what isnt seen Whats critical at this moment is that we reclarify the difference between villain and hero How do you think that compares with today m not sure sir d like to hear more could come back tomorrow Fine But the pages stay here Of course sir Agent Smith Thank you sir Never a good idea to talk too loud Good morning John Mr Palmer has asked that you attend the emergency meeting today Miss Gladwell

citizen in this country were uniquely identifiable by their own card and number say the pattern on their fingers Imagine how quickly we could find them if they committed a crime Lts all very impressive John Well would you like to stay here or would you like to go somewhere else Lts up to you Mr Hoover m not sure where you think this is headed Right of course Miss Gandy know weve only known each other a brief time but you would make the finest of companions Your strength your character your education Are you poking fun at me No No no no No no of course not Then please Mr Hoover stand up d appreciate it if you wouldnt share this with any of the other women in the typing pool No of course not All right May ask what What What particular flaw you seem to find in my character No

please call me Edgar Lts what my mother uses Edgar Yes Can you keep a secret Yes Of course You have my word m not interested in getting married My work comes first Hmm Then perhaps you would consider a position as my personal secretary Yes Shall we The book Right After you helped organize that library just as did this Bureau And many said we didnt need either You see innovators arent often celebrated Not at first Miss Gandy The nitwit Kennedy child rang his baby buzzer again Perhaps hed like a fresh diaper Should find out what the Attorney General needs No want the completed transcripts of the Los Angeles recordings When receive those then well answer his buzzer Very good Edgar Agent Smith is back He uh has some questions about the Palmer Raids Should tell him to go Helen do you like him dont have an opinion of him yet Hmm Well like him trust him ll set him up in your outer office No No no no Bring him a desk in here But in how could protect us from anyone Before moved to this office we were powerless We had few federal laws no right to carry firearms and Congress liked it that way Criminals ran free but there was no law against keeping track of them so made a decision on my own compiled note cards and over five thousand names and called the one department in Washington that still held a small piece of untested power Was that the Department of Labor The power to deport sir But only to deport those who checked two boxes They had to be foreign citizens and they had to be working to harm our country And they cooperated with you Of course not No one freely shares power in Washington Agent Smith There is no law under which you can issue a warrant for the arrest of an alien when have certified that he is subject to deportation Without any evidence Mr Attorney General no There exists a due process of law Due process of law What about the threat There might be a threat Might be Fine There is a threat to our country But with no proof of a crime theres no cause for deportation Well see about that Youll be hearing from me But one of their heads was a Mr Caminetti He was weary of our Justice Department but he hated one person even more am a revolutionist by nature and as such claim the right to rebel and resist invasion by all means force included Emma Goldman She was the hero of the radical movement If could hand Caminetti Emma Goldman he would deport her without a thought But she was a citizen Would you like to stop sir No know its hard for you to imagine today but there was a time when the average American feared for their safety and survival Agent Smith In Chicago a coal strike started by communist labor shut off all the power Riots followed And on Armistice Day in Centralia Washington veterans fresh back from the war were murdered by radicals The red revolution had arrived on our soil No no We cant take them down one by one Theyll go underground and well have a bomb inside every senators mailbox We need to have a simultaneous raid hitting all of them at once Who are they Youre here to find out Now listen want a card on every radical person in this country Against the wall gentlemen wanna know who where theyre from what group what they say Who have already committed crimes care more whether they intend to Against the wall gentlemen thank you How many are on our team Only you four for now ll have locks installed No Miss Gandy That would bring too much attention Nothing is to be alphabetically ordered want the cards to be broken down into subjects and categories Now this system should be easy enough if explained If not finding information should prove impossible And trust no one not even our fellow agents Half our colleagues are on both sides of the payroll But the crimes were investigating arent crimes theyre ideas Well if your idea Against the wall gentlemen Thank you If your idea is to come into our country and plot the overthrow of our government then yes indeed that is a crime Mrs Goldman married a citizen The man she married hasnt visited her once in prison yet this man the man shes lived with since her wedding he visits nightly What happens when we raid this list of yours and find nothing No guns no bombs just innocent people deported From every corner of this nation the American people have urged the Attorney General to do something about this and return the United States back to peace Now m happy to send your objections to Mr Palmer himself but in the meantime expose Miss Goldmans sham marriage and you will change that suit of yours Pardon me John Your suit sir your suit This isnt a saloon Have respect for yourself but more importantly have respect for this department Miss Gandy Miss Goldman are you an anarchist decline to answer Do you deny that you are an anarchist decline to answer Do you believe in the overthrow of the government of the United States refuse to answer Do you advocate the assassination of public officials refuse to answer This alien has refused to answer questions pertaining to the charges in the warrant notwithstanding the fact that every opportunity was afforded her recommend deportation And just like that we had our precedent Edgar should arrange our travel to Paterson on Valentines Day Yes of course Miss Gandy took the train to Paterson New Jersey on February th If could catch these radicals redhanded then the Labor Department would have to put them all on boats back home So agents of the Bureau alongside local police began raiding gathering places of known communist radicals all across this country These people are armed and violent Theyre prepared to kill to avoid capture Take one Go on Are we allowed to use these sir These are gifts There is no law that prevents us from using our own weapons Gentlemen grab your guns Gentlemen quickly Lets move Police This is a raid Hes going for the window stop him Thats enough The leaflets matched exactly Wed solved the bombings And in the end we arrested nearly and deported over of them Lt was accomplished against great odds and at great personal peril They found the counterfeiting press five pistols two automatics And in Trenton they found gunpowder copper brass wire and batteries bomb factory Yes One hundred and twenty arrests in Detroit But everyone in the Bureau involved lost their job correct Even Palmer himself Some did and theres the lesson You see the bombs stopped and peace came The American people had forgotten there ever was a threat So when political adversaries attacked Palmer for trying to protect this nation from communism our countrymen allowed it to happen Because like today theyve forgotten the bombs the blood the fear But why Palmer and not you if you orchestrated the raids was years old Agent Smith was just following orders understand sir And if we hadnt you may very well have been born into a communist state rather than the country you love today Am right Of course sir Hmm Edgar Ignore him Edgar am in a meeting Mr Tolson ll be out in a moment Dont forget about your appointment with the Attorney General Edgar Files are not yet completed Mr Tolson Please go away Thank you Thank you sir apologize ll finish this chapter tonight Very well Agent Smith In the Academy do they tell the story of how got here Yes sir Uh you were called into the new Attorney Generals office Harlan Fiske Stone Yes sir Attorney General Stone He called you into his office and told you to sit down sir Sir there are over a dozen vacancies in Chicago And with the robbery rates rising it would profit the Bureau to start filling vacancies and make recoveries have files on potential suspects and with a congressional hearing Lower the treble son You didnt call this meeting did Sit down Yes sir Everyone youve worked with here is gone And theres a reason for that This Bureau is of exceedingly bad odor Would you agree Yes sir And no offense you seem to have no social life No wife no girlfriend As far as can tell no pals at all That is accurate sir And youre shamelessly distracted by this hodgepodge fingerprinting affair Sir it wouldnt be hodgepodge if we could centralize the prints here assure you Lts a speculative science at best Yes sir And why do they call you Speed Who calls me that They all do behind your back evidently gained a reputation for delivering groceries when was years old was the fastest in the neighborhood Lt was just a nickname You sure its not for the way you talk Perhaps sir Young man want you to be acting director of the Bureau of Investigation will take the job Mr Stone but only on certain conditions What are they The Bureau must be divorced from politics and not be a catchall for political hacks Recruits must be collegeeducated Appointments must be based on merit Promotions will be made on proven ability And well the Bureau will be responsible only to you sir the Attorney General wouldnt give you the job under any other conditions Thats all Good day Well thank you sir am determined to summarily dismiss from this Bureau any employee whom find indulging in the use of intoxicants Lt is my belief that when a man becomes a part of this Bureau he must so conduct himself both officially and unofficially as to eliminate even the slightest possibility of criticism as to his conduct And what is your name sir Agent Williams sir Pleasure to meet you Agent Williams You too sir And your name Agent Caffrey sir Your assignment m headed to Kansas City to aid in the search for bank robber Frank Nash sir Mm that is dangerous work and when you return you will be rewarded for your service You still fancy facial hair Agent Stokes The ladies appreciate it Hmm And suppose the ladies opinions are more important than the Bureaus No Sir Perhaps you are better suited for the police force than the Bureau of Investigations ve been with the Department and the Bureau for seven years Almost as long as you No You were with the old Bureau seven years and that Bureau is now gone sir And so are you quickly dismissed all agents Education physical fitness but above all loyalty ve had two made Same cut different pattern And two suits for you Theyll be delivered on Friday Thank you Mother Lts platinum six diamonds and a star sapphire Heh Lts absolutely beautiful Mother Thank you ve told the whole neighborhood about you They all know No shouldnt ve been gaining weight Mother Lts solid weight Theres nothing wrong with solid weight on a man All right m so incredibly proud of you Edgar m starting an album for you m gonna put everything in it This is just the beginning Johnny Hoover appointed acting director of the Bureau of Investigations Can you read that You proud of your uncle Gentlemen want to introduce you Come with me Edgar good to see you Good to see you Lawrence d like to introduce you to Mr Clyde Tolson Graduated from George Washington University tonight with a law degree Hmm Congratulations Mr Tolson Thank you Mr Hoover believe you are one of our most distinguished alumni did yes uh do have a degree from the school yes was admiring your suit Mr Tolson You should take a lesson Lawrence Thank you sir lts a custom cut from Garfinkels department store Ah Do you have a card Mr Tolson do yes of course Here you go Good to see you Lawrence Thank you sir Welleducated highly recommended willing to guarantee five years service Has a family in New York and a new baby No interview The family in New York or the baby Miss Gandy five years is not enough We need men willing to dedicate their lives How many is that so far Thats denied and interviews Hmm Did we receive an application from a Mr Tolson Yes Yes his report states he has confidence poise his diction is excellent But although physically fitted for it might be displeased with rugged work His only interest is to gain experience that would benefit a private law practice And he has no interest in being here for any period of time which would render employment speculative Hmm He did receive a letter of recommendation from the executive assistant of the Secretary of War Thats fantastic Miss Gandy Yes lt mentions here that Mr Tolson showed no particular interest in women Then again some of our best agents excel because they have no family encumbrance Yes youre right Set up an interview You know what the problem is Miss Gandy These men they dont They dont look up to me Of course they do dont mean figuratively mean they dont look up to me Well if you could conduct the entire interview from behind your desk instead of walking about the office could correct that Indeed Miss Gandy suppose had information on someone in a position of power harmful information Lt goes against my nature to destroy such information but dont trust it in the general files either Could trust it with you If we were to create a confidential file Of course Edgar Thank you Miss Gandy Information is power Lt protected us from the communists in and since has been vigilantly collected organized and maintained by our Attorney General Kennedys Office Did you always have this fireplace or did you have it put in Lt was put in What were you doing with wiretaps in that house You asked that pursue this organized crime element Mr Kennedy and did so sir with diligence Do you use the fireplace Rarely Who else has heard the recording have filed the matter personal and confidential m the only person with access to it Mr Hoover asked you to pursue a real threat Instead youve publicly denied the existence of organized crime and now this gross display of intimidation Mr Attorney General was only following orders We bugged the basement of a home in Los Angeles that was a known gathering place for lawbreakers How was to know that an East German communist would be down there having sex with your brother the President of the United States Do not shoot the messenger sir am here to protect you both Remember that What do you want from me If this information were to go public it would create widespread distrust in your brothers leadership capabilities And above all else hold the wellbeing of our country paramount So how may help you Mr Hoover Well if am to pursue the elements that you consider a threat humbly request that you allow me the same power and access to follow the groups that see as an immediate threat Lts not anymore You know who Stanley Levinson is sir lawyer white communist lawyer organizing at the highest levels including the Now their group is growing They are entirely selfserving and their leadership is openly critical of this department here Did you read the memos that sent No no cant say that have Lt says right here Mr Kennedy They claim we are unable to get convictions in even the worst most heinous crimes and that we have faltered under the pressure complexities and responsibilities of our office in print Right here in The Washington Post You cant bear a little criticism Well it depends on what their aim is They are gaining considerable power Their priorities are singularly focused on their own issues They are trying to incite revolt Frankly they sound more critical of your office than mine Theres a new face to communism Edgar and this isnt it Communism is a foreign threat now not domestic Mr Kennedy before you were even born heard that very same argument from a Mr Mitchell Palmer Do you know what it took to change his mind bomb If he would have sat in his rocking chair five more minutes in wed have been lucky enough to find an intact index finger Now do not want that to happen to you or your brother sir Theres no reason we both cant get what we want We can wage a war on two fronts sir You understand You can go now Mr Hoover Yes sir Please leave the transcripts here with me Yes sir Oh and feel free and share them with your brother Oh and let him know that have a copy of my own in safekeeping Unh Your is here sir Thank you Miss Gandy Send him right in thank you Please have a seat Mr Tolson Mr Hoover thank you for this opportunity Yes Please Have a seat Thank you sir There were several problems with your application Mr Tolson not the least of which is the fact that you did not show the proper requirement to the Bureau nor the proper dedication to protecting the American people and the American way May remind you that this is not a platform to a fatter paycheck in private practice Mr Tolson Ls there something the matter Mr Tolson No sir Ls exercise a requirement for all agents sir Yes All our agents need to be in top physical condition We must outsmart and outmatch the public enemy at every turn Yes of course So uh what routine do you do sir Pushups situps and squatting see Would you like me to fix the curtain Or perhaps could open a window always prefer a little bit of air after exercise Dont you If it would please you And sir where may fall short in terms of resume apparently far exceed the rest in terms of honesty didnt lie to get this appointment sir Like the rest yes would like to start a practice but could be persuaded otherwise if the right opportunities were to arise Hmm Fair enough Mr Tolson Fair enough These sleeves seem to be the correct length found you two tie options This one is a bit more fashionforward but it would complement this suit and cut and fabric Lts too loud dont you think Too loud Okay which is why found this one the backup lts a bit more directorial a little bit more Lts a little bit more reserved agree Lets keep this as a second option please Thank you Clyde Are you Mr John Hoover am ls there a problem Lt seems theres a Mr John Hoover whose credit has gone bad with us That would appear to be you That is not me sir on my word My mother calls me Edgar my niece calls me and sign John not John Well sir if youre a friend of Mr Tolsons just choose one name and reapply All right Thank you very much Morning Miss Gandy What You dont like it Mr Hoover theres been a massacre in Kansas City One of our own Special Agent Caffrey Let him have it By the communist threat had been beaten back but the Depression had hit and there was a new threat The bank robber the car thief and the kidnapper But unfortunately as with communism America didnt react with scorn They gave the American gangster admiration And the defiance by desperate armed criminals of the forces of society and civilization can no longer be ignored Bugs Moran and Al Capone top the list of public enemies Look around you They could be anywhere May remind you that the Bureau of Investigation seeks to be your protector It belongs to you It is as close to you as your nearest telephone And with your help Warner Bros presents The Public Enemy James Cagney plays public enemy number one Why you Aah There you go with that wishing stuff again Maybe you found someone you like better Coming soon to your neighborhood theater Fantastic That summer a single crime opened the door to set things right Do you know what that was Mr Jones Sorry sir what was that Who is the most famous man of the th Century thus far Joe McCarthy sir Mr McCarthy was an opportunist not a patriot Mr Jones Who is the most famous man of the th Century thus far The most famous Ls that you sir Well suppose his notoriety depends on the field that he is in His field was in the clouds Well then Charles Lindbergh sir Yes Charles Lindberghs baby has been kidnapped from his home Send officers from Trenton ll be on the first train What is it Charles Lindbergh Lindberghs babys been kidnapped Youve got to find him He has to be brought home alive Yes Mother Yes Mother know When we arrived at Mr Lindberghs home that morning in we began an investigation that would forever change our Bureau This morning weve heard from the Pennsylvania Railroad Will Rogers President Hoover Governor Roosevelt Customs the Mail and the Boy Scouts All of you Get off of that dirt Youre trampling evidence Immediately Get off Theres nothing there We checked No defined footprints Lt appears he was wearing fabric on his shoes You dont think the size couldve held some value How did he get up there Are there marks on the window and wall as well ladder We found it yards away We moved it inside You moved it Yes for safekeeping Congratulations Mr Schwarzkopf You have contaminated the crime scene Now get your boots off this property And what right do you have to be here Mister uh Edgar Hoover director of the Bureau of Investigation Weve been sent by President Hoover to ensure the investigation The president has authorized access to all documents and evidence Mr Hoover youre free to observe but New Jerseys not the presidents domain And where is Mr Lindbergh d like to hear his opinion on the matter Mr Lindberghs around back After you sir Hes been up all night Mr Lindbergh himself came down to meet me He shook my hand and expressed his gratitude and faith in our young Bureau He fell five feet Who did The kidnapper with the child in his arms Thats speculation Mr Hoover Mr Lindbergh sir if the ladder had split while the person was on their way up it would have collapsed You see it was a miscalculation Lt was meant to bear the weight of a man but not the weight of a man and child We have other theories Wheres the ransom note Of course And you are touching that with your bare hands as well We checked There are none of those finger imprints that you fancy so valuable Please hand it over Mr Schwarzkopf Thats Colonel Schwarzkopf Have dollars ready spelled We will inform you where spelled to deliver the money spelled We warn you for making anything public or for notify the police Indication for all letters are signature singnature Three holes want this letter and the ladder No jurisdiction ve showed what you asked for lts time for you to go Mr Lindbergh please Mr Hoover thank you As you can see we have everything under control Thank you gentlemen Thank you for your time Mr Lindbergh Clyde Clyde m afraid for his boy He trusts the local police more than us He thinks were all fools Hell go around them too Hes going to bargain with the kidnappers President Hoover called me the morning the child was taken and asked me to do whatever was in my power to solve this crime But do you know what all the power of the Bureau means without federal laws without arms without the ability to make arrests Lt means nothing Mr Chairman urge passage of the Lindbergh Law making kidnapping a federal offense To immediately deliver all the fingerprints in this country to my office so that we may create a central file To help arm our agents so that they have a fighting chance against the submachine guns of some of the most dangerous characters in the history of American criminality And urge you to do this in the name of Little Lindy Because if he can be taken then what child is safe And if we cannot aid in his safe return then what use are we Every fingerprint from the local authorities across the country began flowing in Finally we had a centralized system What is it Edgar The last of the fingerprints came in from Chicago You know our new president has scheduled a meeting with me Miss Gandy Do you know that there are talks of reorganizing the Bureau Yes ve heard similar whispers Hmm Have you Miss Gandy do you remember that file we created on his wife Mrs Roosevelt Yes Will you make a copy for me please Yes of course Thank you Miss Gandy Lindbergh hired criminals to find his son Off the desk now Agent Garrison follow me Yes sir He even got an offer from Al Capone to help pay the ransom money but in the end he employed an eccentric by the name of John Condon who placed a newspaper ad to act as a gobetween with the kidnappers Now was Condon a criminal too He most certainly wasnt an agent of the law Mr Garrison Why are you doing this So a mother may have her baby again And you may know that the American people are grateful for the honor bestowed upon them by your pluck and daring And how do we know the kidnapper is the same that wrote the letters that you have The symbol uh matches the original letters symbol doesnt it What is it Mr Lindbergh In a moment of thoughtlessness showed the symbol to some other men and m not sure that they were trustworthy m not sure anyone is trustworthy will be having your letters analyzed to make sure that they are from the same author And while Mr Lindbergh placed his faith in hoodlums we began cultivating the one thing criminals couldnt fight with all the guns in the world Gentlemen please leave this room Clear all these tables Time to go now Where can we smoke sir Not my concern Out of my sight Mr Osborne tell us what you need Uh bright lights a microscope measuring instruments magnifying glasses uh projector You have the full resources of the Bureau Dont be shy Paper samples from every regional manufacturer Mr Osborne this is Mr Tolson Supply Mr Osborne whatever he needs to conclude without a doubt that these letters came from the same author Hmm Gentlemen please Thank you Should we tell the attorney general So he can say no a third time Just post a sign like this one What would you like it to say keep out The Bureau of Investigations Technical Laboratory Have it carved and nailed to the wall If he wants it gone hell have to tear it out Lts time we at least have one thing the bad guys dont Decorating skills Science Clyde Science Uh the ink is different but the handwriting is a match Whoever Mr Condon is corresponding with is the person who wrote the original note Or Condon wrote all the notes himself Lindbergh is planning on using Condon to deliver the ransom May have already happened Call the Internal Revenue Service Get them to Lindberghs home insist that all those bills be marked Yes sir Ls that all Mr Hoover have a pm class to teach No you dont Consider your pay doubled You work for your country now Mr Osborne Congratulations Doctor Have you gotted the money cant bring the money till see the baby promise you theres no police Lts too dangerous Stop Stop this now No ones gonna harm you If they catch me they will No they only want the child Theyll give me years if m caught They could burn me No No didnt do it m only the messenger Eh What if the baby is dead Would burn if the baby is dead Why would we be meeting if the baby was dead Place another ad in the paper when you have the money So if a ransom had to be paid we needed those bills traced We brought in the and for his own good we had to force his hand thought gold notes were going out of circulation Mr Irey Thats our hope Itll make these bills more identifiable have no need for the money just want my son This isnt just about your son Mr Lindbergh If these kidnappers go free then no child in this country will be safe Thats why ve assembled a man team headed by Special Agent Sisk here And if they find out youre involved may never see my son again Mr Lindbergh sir we will not pursue a single lead until your child is safe in his mothers arms You have my word sir The kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh Jr was a tragedy not only to Colonel and Mrs Lindbergh but to the nation His abduction from his Hopewell home was a challenge to America This ladder the only clue to the kidnapping was homemade Let the developments in the Lindbergh case start a new drive to wipe out the stain not only of that wanton kidnapping but of all kidnapping and crimes Hey doctor Give your word not to open for six hours Thank you talked him out of dollars d prefer him happy than save the money dont want to upset him Where is the baby promised not to open this for six hours You gave your word did not The boy is on boat Nelly Lt is a small boat feet long Two persons are on the boat They are innocent Youll find the boat between Horsenecks Beach and Gay Head near Elizabeth Island Thats Nantucket right What was in the boat There was no boat Lindbergh didnt trust us He wanted to do things his way And who can blame him No one respected us at that time Mr Hoover weve been calling Edgar Time to go Agent Garrison Right now The Attorney General has authorized your wiretaps Very good Miss Gandy Edgar are you sure about this Once you do this Edgar its done When prove myself correct we will have saved this country another revolution History will remember that Clyde But if you are wrong history will remember it as an illegal move over a petty grudge Do you consider our reputation petty Mr Tolson No Then order the wires Can we discuss this over dinner After youve ordered the wires Yes sir The directors on his way Ahem After you Wait please Harveys Restaurant sir No to the White House We were in the midst of a Great Depression and breaths away from historys worst war We needed more power to protect but as with every new president this Bureaus future and my very job was being drawn into question The president is ready to see you now Alrighty Come in Have a seat Mr Hoover Lts the same dance each time They make me wait They imagine m sweating that theyre gonna show me whos boss play along Thank you And then did you show him the transcript No He didnt want to read it That was unique He wanted me to tell him about it What how you came across it No explained to him up front we never expected to find Mrs Roosevelt in the bedroom of a known communist agitator much less having what sounded like an intimate moment That needed his advice on how to proceed wanted to let him know he had an ally Before he had a chance to ask you to resign Exactly When was finished he simply pushed the file aside as if he was unconcerned with it Clyde the President of the United States is afraid What hes afraid of you Of a potential invasion from abroad Well have two glasses of your finest champagne Of course Mr Hoover Ahem Youre drinking now Were celebrating Clyde were celebrating You know feel could trust you with anything right Well d like to think so The president signed a secret order granting me increased power of surveillance secret surveillance of communists and radicals without warrant Ls that legal Sometimes you need to bend the rules a little in order to keep your country safe right And to make sure hadnt heard it wrong clarified this with Secretary of State Hull And he said and quote You go ahead and investigate those cocksuckers Vulgar Hmm agreed Clyde ve been meaning to ask you something Feel free need someone who understands whats at stake here you understand Someone who can trust an associate director of the Bureau know youve only been in your current position for what months now Oh almost now sir Youre missing my point Clyde want you to be my numbertwo man m not much for the spotlight Edgar need you Clyde Do you understand need you On one condition Good day or bad whether we agree or disagree we never miss a lunch or a dinner together Well would have it no other way Hey pull over Only a half a mile to Mount Rose Cant wait Orville In the end the childs body was found just within sight of Mr Lindberghs home The body was blackened the left leg missing from the knee down There was a visible fracture on the skull Hed suffered a violent blow to the head told them months ago He mustve fallen on the way down with the baby in his arms We are the sinners Edgar We tolerated lawlessness in the land until it grew to diabolical proportions The babys blood is on all our hands Edgar On your hands Edgar Yes Mother Six weeks after the kidnapping Congress passed the Lindbergh Law making kidnapping a federal offense The right to make arrests followed and the right to bear arms So continued collecting the finest scientific minds in the country He claims to be the world expert on wood analysis Lts easy to be the expert if youre the only person in the world with any interest He does claim he can tell as much from a cut of wood as a doctor can from an autopsy Ah He has um social difficulties He is mentally ill isnt he Hes only as mad as you are Sir This was supposed to be temporary Mr Hoover If you want your Sherlock Holmes playing time Where do you suggest we go sir where suggest you take your case to Congress Fine sir Have it your way ll tell people we could not solve the case because we could not afford laboratories and the Attorney General wouldnt allow us to use his lounge Fine Now get your science fair project out of here Yes sir Right away sir Gentlemen keep working Mr Tolson lets get the president on the phone The depravations of vicious outlaws roving from state to state like packs of wolves amounts to an actual armed invasion of America We must outsmart and outwit the criminal foreign and domestic They have chemists building bombs We need chemists tracing their efforts We must have the most advanced force in the world if we are to have the safest nation on earth And please gentlemen let us not for a moment lose sight of our goals To protect the honest citizen to teach the criminal that regardless of his subterfuges his twisting his squirming and slimy wriggling he cannot escape the one inexorable rule of law enforcement that you cant get away with it Thank you Thank you Mr Hoover But your agency is already one of the most wellfunded in Washington is it not Yes that is true sir but our car and bank robbery recoveries totaled million last year and our budget is only well two million Unlike other departments in Washington we actually run a profit We cannot quantify the value of our successes with the hoodlums Pretty Boy Floyd Baby Face Nelson Machine Gun Kelly and other hoodlums of that nature Mr Hoover is it true that you spend the Bureaus money on advertising We are not permitted to engage in advertising of any kind sir No But you take part for instance in the making of radio shows and comic books ve listened to several of these Men programs Your picture seems to be shown in conjunction with them quite frequently We declined emphatically to lend any form of endorsement had nothing to do with their production furnished no advice technical or otherwise Well the very advertisement says that broadcasts were true reflections as contained in the official records based on actual cases from the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Saturday night at Mr Hoover what are your exact qualifications for your position of leadership in this Bureau My qualifications sir Nineteen years with the Department of Justice Nineteen Twelve as director In all that time you ever make an arrest yourself have made investigations administer several cases at once Well thats not what asked The comic books show you with a machine gun making arrests ls that just fiction am responsible for thousands of arrests sir So you admit it is pure fiction In fact it wasnt you who hunted down and captured John Dillinger at all Lt was Agent Purvis ls that correct was in charge of all of those investigations but no sir

much worse it couldve been Find Agent Purvis He is to be demoted immediately or better yet fired Firing the man who killed John Dillinger would be a disaster Then he is to spend the rest of his career

Mother let me take you to a doctor simple examination isnt unholy is it Mother Mother please Faith Edgar Faith Dont wilt like a little flower Be strong Yes Mother will If what Congress valued more

filthy abnormal fraudulent self is bared to this nation Did you get everything Edgar Type it up Type it up understand that you work for our department is that correct For two years now sir Then you

with Bruno Hauptmanns arrest Would you like to start there Yes yes think we shall Mr Hauptmann was brought to trial on January nd Mencken called this the biggest story since the resurrection From the looks of things this may be bigger Well you see no two saws make the same markings This saw from Bruno Hauptmanns tool chest makes markings identical to those found on the ladder used in the crime In the ransom note and Mr Hauptmanns writings he wrote the word anyding for anything uh gut for good boad for boat and notice the inverted capital s And the s that look like s Mr Lindbergh you said you heard a voice in the cemetery that night Yes very clearly voice to the best of my belief calling Dr Condon in a foreign accent Hey doctor Since that time have you heard the same voice Yes l have Whose voice was it that you heard in the cemetery that night saying Hey doctor That was Hauptmanns voice But did he act alone He never confessed but what sociopath ever does The evidence was clear He was indicted for murder in the first degree while perpetrating a burglary In New Jersey that is punishable by death Mr Hauptmann youve had an opportunity in this courtroom today to tell the whole truth Have you told the truth told the truth already And the statements to District Attorney Foley Did you tell him the truth To a certain extent To a certain extent you didnt tell him the truth ls that right This board that was found in your closet has these numbers written on it Lts a little blurred now isnt it Looks like it Between are some words Lt looks like Decatur and Sedgwick You see that You know what that means dont you That address on there Not exactly lt is the address and telephone number of Dr Condon the man who paid the ransom written in your writing found on a board in your closet Mr Hoover the doctors here to see you Following Dr Kings historic speech many said that day brought about a new awakening in the conscience of the nation Others called it a national disgrace In the long history of mans cruelty to man this was a day of hope have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creeds mans legacy is determined by where the story ends Agent Owens Lets think about that tonight and make a decision tomorrow Ls this about a mans legacy Or an institutions reputation The two are connected Agent Owens One invented the other and vice versa Good day to you Yes sir We the jury find the defendant Bruno Richard Hauptmann guilty of murder in the first degree Your Honor l ask for immediate sentencing According to the law of this state l rule that Mr Bruno Hauptmann suffer death at the time and place and in the manner provided by law lts death for Hauptmann The trial of the century the criminal shamed the cemented as the public hero Thats our thats our ending agent But did he do it alone Ls he the one who actually took the child How can you be sure Well the mountain of evidence we discovered uncovered confirmed and clarified you cannot dispute it Clarence Darrow did Of course Heh Of course Agent Owens Thats what he does Mrs Roosevelt issued a statement questioning his guilt Well she has enough to hide on her own when it comes to unAmerican activities Well if youre comfortable with it as an ending ll do my best with it Yes Yes l am Sir Watch this with me He received my letter and the audio tape last night President Johnson affixes his signature using more than pens One of the coveted souvenirs goes to the Nobel prizewinner Martin Luther King a dedicated leader Go on say it Clyde Lt just seems so risky Edgar over a couple negative articles Hes deliberately surrounded himself with communists and with the power hes gathering hes now our greatest domestic threat On behalf of the Nobel Committee we hand over to you the insignia Hes going to decline the award Clyde He knows what we have can ruin him Of the Nobel Peace Prize the diploma and the gold medal Theres no question about it Hes done accept the Nobel Prize for Peace at a moment when million Negroes of the United States are enga Sorry to interrupt sir Your next appointment is here The doctor first Miss Gandy Yes of course Send him in in a few minutes Thank you Stay strong Edgar You stay strong Edgar Stay strong Unh The parade as it makes its way to the Capitol Building for the inauguration You can see the Roosevelt High Marching Band leading the way The motorcade is making progress down Pennsylvania Avenue carrying our th president Richard Milhous Nixon waves to the crowd Yep theres the president and his wife Pat happily waving When morals decline and good men do nothing evil flourishes Every citizen has a duty to learn of this that threatens his home his children society uninterested and unwilling to learn from the past is doomed We must never forget our history We must never lower our guard Even today there are organizations that have America as their prime target They would destroy the safety and the happiness of every individual and thrust us into a condition of lawlessness immorality that passes the imagination The president will see you now Mr Hoover Alrighty Edgar come in Oh l am so sorry Mr Hoover You werent answering your telephone You had a photo session with a retiring agent Hes leaving now Wheres Clyde Lts a bad day for him sir Will you Will you schedule a dinner for us please in our old corner booth

ever find them Thank you Helen No matter what kind of pressure they put on No matter how much Yes Edgar No matter how much pressure promise you Thank you Helen Well did Nixon ask for your resignation No he wanted to know what we had in the files on him What did you say said What files sir But he knows He wants us to expand our wiretaps to include news reporters now Clyde We cant do that especially not now Thats the problem Clyde If l dont agree to do his black bag jobs hell create his own private force Oh thats illegal Yes well he didnt say it outright but l saw it in his eyes He wont be controlled Clyde Hes a menace wholl do anything to hold on to power Right l see Yes See l never played his game thats the problem And if to some what l did seemed like rulebending then perhaps they need to figure out what it is they did that made them feel blackmailed or intimidated wasnt thinking that Then what What were you thinking was thinking it might be time for us to retire Shut up Clyde You built a great thing Edgar And if you stop now youll be celebrated Thats what youve always wanted isnt it Our countrys lasting adoration Well theres a chance you could have it Yes Yes and why wouldnt l Hmm Why wouldnt l Clyde saved this country from a Bolshevik invasion rid this country of radicals captured Machine Gun Kelly killed Dillinger captured Karpis convicted Bruno Hauptmann And now with my last breath when l try to help save this country again m rewarded with a forced retirement will not go down and the fact that you suggest that makes me question your very loyalty My loyalty Edgar Yes your loyalty Clyde read your manuscript Edgar You didnt arrest Karpis And you know as well as l do there was no white horse in the street no gun in the back seat And you didnt kill Dillinger Agent Purvis did But you kept all the glory for yourself And Machine Gun Kelly never said Dont shoot Men You made that up to sell comic books Edgar And when we went to the scene of the greatest crime of the century Mr Lindbergh didnt come out and shake your hand and express his faith in the He called you a fussy little man and he refused to even meet you And you didnt arrest Hauptmann Agent Sisk did You werent even at the scene Edgar Only the photo op Edgar most of what you wrote is exaggeration some of it blatant lies and l dont even know if you realize it anymore Edgar

you Annie Bozo Bozo Boy come here The very essence of our democracy is rooted in a belief in the worth of the individual That life has meaning that transcends any manmade system that love is the greatest force on earth far more enduring than hatred or the unnatural divisions of mankind Yes This is Annie from Mr Hoovers residence Mr Hoover has passed Yeah Sir Jesus Christ That old cocksucker ll get a speech prepared We should go on television Not yet First seal off his office change his locks do whatever you have to do want those fucking files Yes sir Oh good Come in Hes upstairs Ladies and gentlemen it is with a profound sense of personal loss that l learned of the death of Edgar Hoover This truly remarkable man has served his country for years under eight presidents as director of the with unparalleled devotion and ability and dedication For years from the time l came to Washington as a freshman congressman he has been one of my closest personal friends and advisors And every American in my opinion owes Edgar Hoover a great debt for building the into the finest law enforcement organization in the entire world ve ordered that all the flags of the government buildings be flown at half mast but l will say that in doing so that Edgar Hoover because of his indomitable courage against sometimes very vicious attack has made certain that the flag of the will always fly high The is the eternal monument honoring this great American Funny how even the dearest face will fade away in time but most clearly l remember your eyes with a sort of teasing smile in them and the feeling of that soft spot just northeast of the corner of your mouth
