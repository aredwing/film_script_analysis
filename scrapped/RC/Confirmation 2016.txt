today announce my intention to nominate United States Court of Appeals Judge Robert Bork to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court The drumbeat continued today from both camps in the pitched battle over the Presidents nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court The lobbying is having an effect with the Senate mailroom reported days behind under a deluge of mail on Bork Mr President looks like the Bork nomination will fail in the Committee Over my dead body The yeas are The nays are The nomination is not confirmed If we intend to turn the United States Supreme Court into an election process lets change the Constitution and lets elect a Supreme Court judge of the United States George Herbert Walker Bush do solemnly swear that will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States Thurgood Marshall the Supreme Courts first and only black justice announced his retirement today In a letter to President Bush Marshall said The strenuous demands of court work appear at this time to be incompatible with my advancing age and medical condition President Bush said today his nomination to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall could come in a few days but should that person be black minority appointment could certainly neutralize a lot of potential opposition Marshall warned that the emphasis on race in choosing his successor might have negative results My dad told me way back that you cant use race For example theres no difference between a white snake and a black snake Theyll both bite This is a special report We are told the President is going to announce his nominee to the Supreme Court Well am very pleased to announce that will nominate Judge Clarence Thomas to serve as Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court Clarence Thomas fits my description of the best man at the right time President Bush has moved to cement the conservative majority on the United States Supreme Court by nominating federal judge Clarence Thomas to fill the seat left vacant by the retirement of Justice Thurgood Marshall As with Marshall Thomas is a black man a man born to poverty in a segregated South a man who benefited from the legal legacy of Justice Marshall The more that people see and hear of Clarence Thomas the more they will be persuaded that his brand of integrity and independence and common sense is exactly what we need in this time In New York City today several thousand demonstrators protested against the Supreme Court decision restricting abortion counseling and urged Congress to reject President Bushs nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court Clarence Thomas is an insult to the life and legacy of Thurgood Marshall and everything he stood and worked for At a national gathering of civil rights activists in Memphis black leaders are vocal in their reaction to the Supreme Court nominee Simply to appoint a black person doesnt make it right We have to Bork Thomas We dont wait for questions We simply immediately Bork him kill him politically and kill Bush in the meantime Ricki Seidman Hey Ricki its Nan at the Alliance For Justice You know that thing weve been hearing all summer about how Thomas treated women who worked for him Yeah finally found a name In a black woman wanted to study law here at the University of Oklahoma At the time it was illegal for blacks and whites to study together in this state so Miss Sipuel sued What are you gonna do Nothing You dont want to say anything This man could end up on the Supreme Court At the saw women have their lives ruined because they spoke out against a manager at a diner What do you think would happen to me Okay Lots of people will fight this nomination It doesnt have to be me Okay Clarence Thomas Yes There you go There he is There is the man of the hour None of this Now what did tell you What did tell you years ago You said Come work for me and ll only pay you a year What said was What said was you have a huge future ahead of you Judge Clarence Thomas appears headed for confirmation to the Supreme Court think hell be confirmed think he should be confirmed Well find it intellectually stimulating hearings but dont see many fireworks Clarence Ginni First day of the hearings How you feeling Good Glad to finally be here Good Good Now just remember some of these Democrats on the Committee are gonna be a hard sell Worst case scenario seven of them vote against you That still leaves seven voting for you And a tie takes you to the full Senate Were in great shape Even with the Democratic majority Ginni we only need votes At last count we had And as popular as the President is number could even go up higher so dont worry if you catch a little heat in these hearings Yeah good to know that Thank you Lets get in there Judge Senator Mrs Thomas Senator In a clearly symbolic gesture Strom Thurmond ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee and former segregationist is escorting Judge Thomas into the chamber Thank you Mr Chairman would like to first introduce you to my wife Virginia Welcome Mrs Thomas Its a pleasure to have you here And my son Jamal Welcome Jamal There are not enough words to express my deep gratitude and appreciation to Senator Danforth Hello May speak with Anita Hill This is Anita This is Ricki Seidman m an investigator in Senator Kennedys office m doing background checks on Clarence Thomas in reference to his nomination to the Supreme Court know you worked for Judge Thomas Can ask some questions about him Miss Seidman the hearings are starting Isnt it late to be doing background checks You worked for him twice right at Education and Thats right Good experiences was proud of things we accomplished at both offices Professor weve heard that Judge Thomas mistreated young women who worked for him at the Do you know anything about that Thats not something can talk about Why not ll put it this way If were advising someone who were a victim of his unwanted advances dont think would suggest that she come forward In my experience in a case like this when someone comes forward the victim tends to become the villain Professor in the next few decades the Supreme Court will be making crucial decisions that will have a real impact on the lives of American women If there were less at stake wouldnt ask Were you one of the victims of his advances What say is to the Senate Judiciary Committee only not for public consumption Agreed wouldnt want it to appear that had a political agenda ll make it clear came to you My earliest memories are those of Pin Point Georgia a life far removed in space and time from this room this day this moment It started at the Department of Education But have always carried in my heart the values of my youth The values of my grandparents and my neighbors The values of people who believe so very deeply in this country in spite of all of the contradictions It is my hope that when these hearings are complete that this Committee will conclude that am an honest decent fair person We begin tonights coverage with s Andrea Mitchell on Capitol Hill Clarence Thomas held the Judiciary Committee spellbound today as he talked about growing up in poverty and racism Why are you bringing this to me Youre an investigator Follow up Call her cant do that not from this office You know how Biden is about this type of thing Hed never Carolyn what shes alleging is sexual harassment Its against the law Okay so bring it to your own senator Have him deal with it Kennedy can lead the charge on a lot of issues Sexual impropriety isnt one of them We both know that Fine lets play this out Say do investigate and it pans out Then what Then the Committee calls Thomas on it And which senator is gonna take that on Not mine Certainly not yours dont know Leahy maybe Simon Okay but even if they were up for it what about the others mean Ricki half these guys have their own very shaky dynamics with women They are not gonna want this door to open Well they might not have a choice The people who gave me Anita Hills name expect us to investigate it If we dont theyll probably leak it So shes saying what That he touched her No she says it was verbal Any other women saying the same thing Not that we know of She does have a corroborating witness though friend she told at the time Somebody credible judge and Hill is a law professor so on paper at least yes When is she saying this happened Ten years ago Ten years ago Carolyn hes been approved for three federal jobs in that time know that Why didnt she bring it up before She didnt bring it up now okay We called her She didnt want to talk about it and she really does not want this getting out Yeah no kidding That makes two of us do not want to go after this guy on a sex charge Carolyn This is this is exactly the kind of thing hate Yeah understand And what if shes lying You understand that Then you got me bringing up a bunch of bogus dirt on a federal judges past and m the bad guy in all this She She didnt want to talk about it Not at first no Well hell mean dont want to force a reluctant woman to have to come in here and talk about all this stuff This is What if we just Can we just let it go Well uh Were not the the only people who know about this so Shit All right call the Have them look into the whole thing Theyre gonna run the whole gauntlet on this thing They got to go quick on that report Weve got to vote on this guy in a week You didnt need to do this you know We have agents coming to interview you Yes but since the reports to the White House thought it was important that say what have to say in my own words so theres no room for misunderstandings Judge Clarence Thomas Yes Anita Hill Yes Come in Clarence Whats wrong former employee someone hired mentored told the that was inappropriate with her that harassed her Sexually Is there any basis for it None She worked for me treated her the same way treat other people working for me Then why is she saying this dont know How can answer that Someone lies about me How am supposed to know why Dont yell m just asking m sorry m upset dont understand Maybe someone is putting her up to this There are a lot of groups out there that cant stand the thought of you on the Court They cant beat you honorably so they come after you like this with lies and slander But thank goodness the is on it They will see it for what it is right Its political nonsense Okay Thank you So the s looked into it The upshot is she says one thing he says another How thorough was the investigation Oh it wasnt exhaustive Christ they had two days to do it Its a serious charge that deserves serious attention We got a vote scheduled on this guy in two days To dig into all this were gonna have to postpone that and cant do that without an explanation Neither of them wants this thing public so unless somebody has a better plan were gonna vote on the nominee on Friday as scheduled Well send him on to the full Senate for their vote He showed the report to the whole Committee Yes but its fine Clarence these guys are senators They know a ploy when they see one And even if they wanted to make something of it which they dont who would dare mean DeConcini hes up to his neck in ethics charges And Kennedy after the summer hes had Youre saying shouldnt care that my name is gonna be linked to this garbage Youre saying that shouldnt care that when people think of me theyre gonna think of this m saying no one will think of this But cant not care m not Kennedy m a black man in America This is a very different thing for me Mr Thurmond Aye Mr Hatch Aye Mr Simpson Aye Mr Grassley Aye Mr Specter Aye Mr Brown Aye Mr Biden No The members of the Committee split right down the middle seven for and seven against his nomination The message Thomas is not a great candidate Still his nomination was sent to the full Senate where it is all but certain that he will be confirmed Hello Professor Hill this is Nina Totenberg from National Public Radio received a copy of the affidavit that you faxed the Judiciary Committee stating that Clarence Thomas sexually harassed you d like to ask you some questions Jesus God damn it Fuck Fuck is right have Nina Totenberg and Tim Phelps asking me about Clarence Thomas and sexual harassment God damn it Did they say who leaked it No of course not All right draw up a statement Say the charges have been investigated found to be baseless The President has total faith in his nominee Does the President know ll tell him Hello Hi m gonna be in the news tomorrow Um Some of the things theyll be reporting will be shocking to you m so sorry for that This is Weekend Edition m Liane Hansen woman who served as personal assistant to Clarence Thomas for over two years has accused him of sexually harassing her s Nina Totenberg reports Law professor Anita Hill said she had much in common with Clarence Thomas and that she initially believed that common background was one of the reasons he hired her as his personal assistant years ago According to Hills affidavit Thomas soon began asking her out socially and refused to accept her explanation that she did not think it appropriate to go out with her boss Thomas after a brief work discussion would quote turn conversation to discussions about his sexual interests He never touched her she acknowledged in an interview and he never directly threatened her job but she said she was and she began to worry that she would soon suffer professionally if she did not submit Several senators contacted by say they are troubled by the Hill allegations and the long delay in investigating them by Chairman Biden Carolyn all right look shes out there making it sound like we havent done a goddamn thing on this want a full chronology who called who and when all right m not gonna be the bad guy on this thing Tom need those phone logs What happened promised her this wouldnt get out gave my word That was pretty fucking stupid wasnt it Nothing like this stays secret in this town You should know that Trouble today for President Bushs already controversial Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas Leading Democrats label the charges quote very disturbing The senator says this is the kind of thing one expects in the last moments of a political campaign not a judicial confirmation The whole thing says Danforth has a very definite and strong aroma to it just spoke with Mrs Thomas Hes writing an affidavit He wants to release it to the press Hell no Get on that Everything goes through me Yeah Its basically the same as yours except instead of refuting her claims one by one like you did we thought it made more sense to offer a single categorical denial Why Its just us being extra careful in the off chance that at some point something was said by you Some offthecuff comment not inappropriate but which she took to be inappropriate You dont believe me No we do We do If something happened and you sign anything asserting that it didnt its a misstatement of sworn fact Its grounds for impeachment Forget the Supreme Court Clarence you could lose your current job know that Ken Shes here Professor Hill Anita did a political group put you up to this Do you have a personal vendetta against Judge Thomas The chronology of this woman and her participation Dozens of women in his office and only one person testifies to this years ago ve always had my concerns about Anita And wonder really if she knows what she did The allegations that are being made are just absolutely unfounded and absolutely not true am offended that there is a possibility that this opportunity may be snatched from him Excuse me Give us some room Okay You okay Okay Have you heard what people are saying about me Ignore it Is that what youd do if people were lying about you on national television Good morning m Dave Swank Dean of the College of Law Professor Hill a member of our faculty has asked an opportunity to hold a press conference this morning to respond to some of the information which has been on the television and in the newspapers So without any more Professor Hill So thats her huh This is good These girls always think itll help to talk to the press and every time they come off looking cheap Good morning have three points that really want to make clear here with you today and afterward will attempt to answer any question as fully and forthrightly as can The first point that want to address today is the idea that this is somehow part of a political ploy Nothing could be further from the truth This has taken a great toll on me personally and professionally and there is no way that would do something like that for political purposes Its helpful perhaps for you to understand how came to make this statement was approached by the Senate Judiciary Committee in early September They approached me as someone who had worked with Clarence Thomas They asked me questions about work that had done there and they asked specifically about sexual harassment Some people have said that have waited until the eleventh hour to bring this to the press never came to the press The press came to me Do you think that the attention that this is getting will affect the vote on Tuesday think you have to ask your senator dont know what effect it has or will have What does the final resolution mean for you What do you want If the senators fully consider this information and come to a conclusion will be satisfied That is what want For them to fully consider it and take this seriously She doesnt look cheap to me Based on your experience do you feel hes not qualified to be on the Supreme Court Youre asking me would vote for him to be on the Supreme Court Oh boy theres trouble In almost every Senate office in Washington the phones have been busy all week All right thanks a lot for calling Callers are angry about Clarence Thomas and allegations about sexual harassment Senate leaders say the Judiciary Committee already has investigated the allegation against Thomas and they do not intend to delay Tuesday evenings vote on his nomination Were here to see Senator Mitchell Pat this is a private Senate lunch Members of the House are Youre a public servant George You dont have a right to privacy right now You need to delay the Senate vote on Thomas and hold a full hearing on these charges Look m just as upset about this as you are No doubt that Hes not the emperor He cant stop or delay a vote on the Senate floor just because We know the damn rules Joe Well Pat then you know you need unanimous consent from the entire body If if you want to try to convince each and every one of these guys Help yourself be my guest yeah Fine So much power so little leadership You heard those phones ringing You know what that sound was Its the sound of of your constituents saying if you vote for Thomas without looking into this they will not forget it We are not postponing this vote Just hypothetically how long would the postponement have to be real investigation of these charges would take weeks You cant hijack the process like that not when this woman had months years to speak up If youre gonna allow her to have a platform for what shes saying youll be raising rumor to fact Who the hell dug her up anyway Weve lost too many Take the full Senate vote right now well come up short Somebody leaked it Yeah somebody on your Committee Jim got your message and want to say think you are making a mistake If a cheap move like this can derail anyones nomination then All right understand Jim and thank you for calling me We can take the vote today but youll lose Clarence its Jack Its not that they dont want to vote for you They just dont feel they can with all the heat theyre getting on this thing so we need to delay the Senate vote and hold a hearing Air all this out Get these votes back The only way the Senate will approve a delay is if you ask for it yourself Clarence what do you say need an answer here Clarence Tell me what we should do For love of Pete Give me the damn phone Alan Simpson here Judge How you doing cant take this Senator dont know why shes doing this to me Well buckle up your guts pal Theres no time for selfpity Somebody did this to me ll tell you what d do and if you cant do that will not vote for you You are going to get back on with Jack and tell him you will do whatever it takes to clear your name Clarence Tell me what you want to do The Senate has agreed to hold hearings on your claims Professor We need to have you testify In fact were gonna reconvene here on Friday Friday Senator thats in three days And m supposed to prepare and travel and Dont worry about any of that got a great young staff who are gonna help you out with everything Logistics and your witnesses How many will be allowed to testify on my behalf Well Anita Professor think Judge Thomas has got two colleagues that hell be calling on Hes already chosen his witnesses When did he hear about this Oh kiddo feel for you do Youre about to head into Pardon my French real shit show here ll tell you if wasnt chairing this thing d be your lawyer myself You You have secured legal counsel right When would have done that had no idea needed it Good evening we begin tonight with a tidal wave of doubt that swept through the Senate today Theres been no official announcement yet of a vote delay but thats only because theyre still trying to decide how long it ought to be how long it will be What do hear every time walk on the floor Hows the civil rights bill Jack What are you doing for us on your civil rights bill Until this mess is resolved to my satisfaction m not doing one damn thing Delay the vote a week Full Senate vote next Tuesday Thats not ideal What about this is This is only to examine the charges before the Senate vote We do not revisit the Committee vote That stands Of course Of course Nobody wants to go backwards on this thing Joe have known Clarence Thomas for years know him to be a man of integrity If he tells me this never happened it never happened Sounds to me like you got nothing to worry about then Jack This is Emma Coleman Jordan Georgetown Law Center Shes putting together a legal team Shes called harassment experts Supreme Court experts litigators Great also included my old roommate Sonia Jarvis Very smart What about Charles Ogle tree Hes an amazing litigator Emma tried him He cant do it Hes up for tenure at Harvard Controversy doesnt go over too well at Cambridge Mmmhmm Theres only two possible scenarios here One shes lying or two shes telling the truth in which case the Presidents an idiot and he nominated a pervert to the Supreme Court Obviously the second scenario is unacceptable We lost Judge Bork We need to use every resource at our disposal to prove the first Now Absolutely cannot lose Judge Thomas Were not losing anybody Senator Thurmond Polls are coming in people who support him versus her Okay so we have half a nation to convince ve been in touch with the networks Well be live as long as were in session and were bringing in a busload of supporters from

two years Two and a half Hmm And you were both single all that time Yes Well had a dating life as did he Hmm Excuse me You never dated each other No mean not even two colleagues at the end of the day Hey lets go catch a movie Why would do that couldnt stand to be around him Is that right Yes Hmm Starting when At Education or the suppose youre trying to find out why followed him Anita you did stay in touch with him By that if you mean that there was occasionally a reason for me to call him on professional matters then yes What about the office Christmas party What party Nat King Cole roasting chestnuts too much eggnog You get a little sloppy You wind up knocking boots with the boss No No Happens all the time Absolutely not Not to me No No Charles dont know what the hell goes on at Cambridge No judgment But do not get sloppy That is not who am And for you to imply that it might be means that you are grossly mistaken about me personally and more importantly tells me that you need to learn the damn truth about sexual harassment Hmm Okay Okay And tomorrow will be much worse Yeah There is in Washington almost a giddy sense of anticipation about the impending drama Its like the flash of lightning in the summer sky just before a big storm and all around town its all anyones talking about Oh yes its much more fun than talking about national health insurance Joe Joe you are not seriously having Anita Hill testify first are you Shes the one who made the claim Shes asked to go first so yes Shes already gone first Shes told her story to the media Her claims are out there and they are hanging over Clarences head That is exactly why in these proceedings Clarence deserves the right to speak first and clear his name So youre asking me to change the order Yes am The hearing is less than hours away Youre the chairman Joe You know whats right here So listen you go on and get some sleep ll meet you at the hotel in the morning Hang on Well ride over together Hang on guys Change of plans They switched the order Theyre gonna let Thomas testify first Danforth convinced Biden the order wasnt fair to Thomas But that doesnt make any sense The hearings are about my charges What is there to talk about until introduce them Its strategic You get out in front first you set the tone But he cant just make a big change like this hours before we start Hes the chairman He can do whatever he wants Judge Clarence Thomas is as surely the whole country knows now accused by Professor Anita Hill of sexually harassing her when he was the head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the government agency where one would file a complaint of sexual harassment if one felt they had been victimized by it The country has not heard from Judge Thomas in person all week though he did issue a statement denying all the charges against him Sometime after Judge Thomas testifies Professor Hill will be called The Judiciary Committee stands accused of not taking these charges seriously when they were made And this week at least virtually the entire Senate stands accused of being indifferent to womens rights The number six Oklahoma Sooner drive for perfection is over Their dream for an undefeated season saw its biggest test and challenge last week during the Red River shootout at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas Football It relaxes me swarming throughout the game Oklahoma could not get anything done offensively while being held to under yards passing AntiThomas protesters rallied this morning before what is expected to be a dramatic Senate hearing Supporters of Judge Thomas gathered to show solidarity for the nominee and despite this outstanding yard touchdown catch by running back Ted Long Quarterback Cale Gundy was under constant pressure That was a hell of a throw late fumble recovery for the winning touchdown late in the game Were wasting time m sorry for this setting Its the only quiet spot around here In Acts how do Paul and Silas prepare for trial They sing Wheres Clarence Theyre ready for him Judge do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God do Mr Chairman Senator Thurmond members of the Committee As excruciatingly difficult as the last two weeks have been welcome the opportunity to clear my name today The first learned of the allegations by Professor Anita Hill was on September th when the came to my home to investigate her allegations When informed by the agent of the nature of the allegations and the person making them was shocked surprised hurt and enormously saddened cannot imagine anything that said or did to Anita Hill that could have been mistaken for sexual harassment If there is anything that has been misconstrued by Anita Hill or anyone else then can say that am so very sorry and wish had known Thank you so much for calling Thats great Thank you Its very helpful Okay thanks Thats three more friends of Anitas in addition to the one we already knew about who remember her telling them at the time that Thomas was harassing her Go to the chairmans office Tell them we need to fly these people in They can all testify together Got it or this country can do to give me my good name back am not going to engage in discussions nor will submit to roving questions of what goes on in the most intimate parts of my private life or the sanctity of my bedroom These are the most intimate parts of my privacy And they will remain just that Private Thank you Judge You will not be asked to Um Whats he doing Realizing unless we can introduce Hills affidavit hes got nothing to ask Thomas about Before begin my questioning um Judge just want to point out to the Committee that we are somewhat limited to permissible questions at this stage Limited why understand as recently as late last night Professor Hill has asked us to maintain the confidentiality of her statement said no such thing know Hmm This is an open forum in the nomination process to allow her attorneys or her said d present my statement myself when testified Biden changed the rules He cant blame this on me m calling him Now that this mans reputation has been very badly hurt Senator would you please yield m not finished yet She wants to tell her own tale and maintain the confidentiality gather from Chairman Bidens description of this Biden just misrepresented my client as not being forthcoming If he had stuck with the plan for her to go first we would not be having this problem This is not her doing Well if Professor Hill would just allow for her affidavit to be released then theyd be able to question Judge Thomas No No That was never the plan The plan was for her to present her charges in person which she is fully prepared to do Okay well then guess we need her here at the Senate building now And you need to have Biden clarify this now Fine yes just get her over here Orrin Hatch of the Republican minority side of the Committee is for the moment taking charge of the Committee This is just an extraordinary development When you have a member of a Senate Committee saying If you dont allow a certain procedure to take place m gonna resign from the Committee and quit as Senator Hatch just did now that doesnt happen up here every day Hearing will come to order Committee has resolved the impasse the following way Professor Hill has indicated on the telephone that she is prepared to release her statement We will excuse temporarily Judge Thomas and we will call momentarily as a witness Anita Hill Professor Hill will be sworn and will make her own statement in her own words You did good Is there a room set aside for Professor Hill Not that know of sir Then find us one damn it Yes sir Thanks Not exactly concerned about my comfort are they Dont worry about that Youll be fine Why are you doing this ve got students more qualified than Thomas Plus believe you What about tenure Hell in hours ll be able to get any job want Fuck tenure Come in Professor theyre ready for you now Thank you Hearing will come to order Welcome Professor We thank you on behalf of the Committee for making time for this know it wasnt easy and we appreciate that Uh please stand to be sworn in Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God do Okay Go ahead then with your opening statement please Mr Chairman Excuse me Excuse me m going to instruct the officers to not let anybody in or out of those doors while Professor Hill is making this opening statement please Can we do that Mr Chairman Senator Thurmond members of the Committee My name is Anita Hill and am a professor of law at the University of Oklahoma was born on a farm in Okmulgee County Oklahoma in m the youngest of children During this period at the Department of Education Are you watching in there m not gonna watch at all But when they bring you back theyll assume that you saw it They can assume whatever they like ve heard enough of these lies After approximately three months of working there he asked me to go out socially with him What happened next and telling the world about it are two of the most difficult things Experiences of my life My working relationship became even more strained when Judge Thomas began to use work situations to discuss sex He spoke about acts that he had seen in pornographic films involving such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes He talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or large breasts involved in various sex acts On several occasions Thomas told me graphically of his own sexual prowess Because was extremely uncomfortable talking about sex with him at all and particularly in such a graphic way told him that did not want to talk about these subjects Somebody answer those would also try to change the subject to education matters or to nonsexual personal matters such as his background or his beliefs My efforts to change the subject were rarely successful During the latter part of my time at the Department of Education the social pressures and his offensive behavior ended began both to believe and hope that our working relationship could be a proper cordial and professional one When Judge Thomas was made chair of the needed to face the question of whether to go with him was asked to do so and did The work itself was interesting and at that time it appeared that the sexual overtures which had so troubled me had ended However during the fall and winter of these began again One of the oddest episodes remember was an occasion in which Thomas was drinking a Coke in his office He got up from the table at which we were working went over to his desk to get a Coke looked at the can and asked Who has put pubic hair on my Coke On other occasions he referred to the size of his own penis as being larger than normal and he also spoke of the pleasures he had given to women with oral sex Finally he made a comment that will vividly remember He said that if ever told anyone of his behavior that it would ruin his career have no personal vendetta against Clarence Thomas seek only to provide the Committee with information which it may regard as relevant It would have been more comfortable to remain silent took no initiative to inform anyone but when was asked by a representative of this Committee to report my experience felt that had to tell the truth could not keep silent Theres no way he survives this day Professor before begin my questioning notice that you have a number of people here Youve got friends or family joining you here today My family hasnt arrived They m sorry They are here but theyre in the hall We will make room for your family Its a very large family Senator Well lets Can we open those doors please get Professor Hills family in here If we can clear some of these chairs here If youre not essential maybe you can clear over here Love you baby Here you go Whats the backroom conversation at the White House m just speculating here Peter It isnt over and dont know but the sense that you get here although they wont say it publicly is that theyre pretty gloomy By all means lets get loving closeups of the saltoftheearth parents Thats not prejudicial Is the President watching Hes still behind the guy Okay yeah Just making sure All right had to ask must ask you Professor to explain again and more fully if you would the behavior that you have alleged that you say went beyond uh professional um business practices Did all that behavior take place at work Yes it did And just in your own words as best you can can you tell the Committee where each of these incidents that you mentioned in your opening statement took place specifically Well recall specifically that the incident about the Coke can occurred in his office at the What incident was that The incident with regard to the Coke can thats spelled out in my statement Okay one more time again for me please The uh incident involved him going to his desk Getting up from a work table going to his desk looking at a can and saying Who put pubic hair on my Coke And were there other incidents that took place at the office recall at least one instance in his office at the where he brought up the substance or the content of pornographic material And again for the record what was the content of What the hell is he doing Does he think people want to hear this trash again to an individual who had um a very large penis and used the name that he was referred to in the pornographic material Um Do you recall what that was do The name that was referred to was Long Dong Silver Jesus Christ Almighty Can you tell the Committee here what was the most embarrassing of all these alleged incidents think the one that was the most embarrassing was his descriptions of pornography involving women with large breasts engaged in a variety of sex with different people or animals That was the thing that embarrassed me the most and made me feel the most humiliated Professor m going to yield the floor now to my good friend from Pennsylvania Senator Specter Professor Hill you testified that you drew an inference that Judge Thomas might want you to look at pornographic films but you told the specifically that he never asked you to watch the films Is that correct He never said Lets go to my apartment and watch films He did say You ought to see this material But when you testified as wrote it down We ought to look at pornographic movies together that was an expression of what was in your mind That was the inference that drew yes What with his pressing me for social engagements yes But the fact is flatly he never asked you to look at pornographic movies with him With him No he did not No he did not Professor Hill you said you took it to mean that Judge Thomas wanted to have sex with you but in fact he never did ask you to have sex correct No he never asked me to have sex He did continually pressure me to go out with him He would not accept my explanation as being valid You think she should be more emotional If she were wed be saying she should be less emotional All right all three networks are going to stay live as long as were in session so if we can keep her talking for a few more hours Clarence will have prime time all to himself Call the Committee Let them know Professor Hill what went through your mind if anything on whether you ought to come forward at that stage If you had you would have stopped this man from being head of the What went through your mind How could you allow this sort of reprehensible conduct to go on right in the headquarters without doing something about it can only say that when made the decision to just withdraw from the situation and not press a claim against him may have shirked a duty a responsibility that had And to that extent confess that am very sorry that didnt do something or say something But at the time that was my best judgment It may have been a poor judgment but it was not dishonest It was not a completely unreasonable choice given the circumstances think it really does underscore the basic difference how men and women look at this issue ve had a number of occasions Did report them No And for the same reasons youve heard every other woman in this country state There has been disclosed in the public the records of certain telephone logs Youve been quoted in The Washington Post as saying Ms Hill called the telephone logs garbage Have you seen the records of the telephone logs Professor Hill Yes have Do you deny the accuracy of these telephone logs No do not Then you now concede that you had called Judge Thomas times do not deny the accuracy of these logs So theyre not garbage Senator what said was the issue is garbage Those telephone messages do not indicate that somehow was pursuing something more than a cordial relationship professional relationship Each one of those calls was made in a professional context Several of those calls involved one incident where was trying to act on behalf of another group So the issue that is being created with the telephone calls yes indeed is garbage If what you say this man said to you occurred why in Gods name when he left his position of power or status or authority over you Why in Gods name would you ever speak to a man like that the rest of your life Thats a very good question And am sure that cannot answer it to your satisfaction That is one of the things that have tried to do here today have suggested that was afraid of retaliation was afraid of damage to my professional life believed that You have to understand that this kind of response is not atypical and cant explain it It takes an expert in psychology to explain how that can happen But it can happen Cause it happened to me Well done But the fact of the matter is that Anita Hill was a very compelling witness who told in graphic detail how she was sexually harassed by Judge Thomas Theres a feeling here that that this witness has held up pretty well this afternoon and there has been a sense of apprehension about it Here she is Lets face it Clarence has his work cut out for him tonight No shit We got to do everything we can to back him up Everything Excuse me Excuse me Mr Duberstein was asked to tell you that Senator Biden decided to adjourn till tomorrow so theyre not gonna need Judge Thomas tonight What No fucking way Move You are not adjourning Ken everybody is completely exhausted We had an agreement Same news cycle Joe already got a tooth thats killing me This countrys gonna hear Clarence Thomas tonight Its either gonna be in there at the witness table or parked right outside this door explaining to a bank of television cameras why Joe Biden is denying him the right to defend himself Clarence The cars here Were going to be late Did you talk to Jamal Yes How is he Angry Hes confused What do say to him How can explain all of this stuff that they say about me Hmm Vile things no child should ever have to hear about their father And these men judging me half of them are under an ethics cloud at this very minute Money charges sex charges You dont see their lives going up in flames around them do you Do you No Theyre gonna be just fine Judge you may want Senator would like to start by saying unequivocally uncategorically That deny each and every single allegation against me today that suggested that in any way had conversations of a sexual nature or about pornographic material with Anita Hill that ever attempted to date her that ever had any personal sexual interest in her or that in any way ever harassed her Second And think its the more important point think that this today is a travesty think it is disgusting think this hearing should never occur in America How would any member on this Committee any person in this room any person in this country like sleaze said about him or her in this fashion or this dirt dredged up and these lies displayed in this manner This is a circus Its a national disgrace And from my standpoint as a black American as far as m concerned its a hitech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves do for themselves to have different ideas And it is a message that unless you kowtow to the old order This is what will happen to you You will be lynched destroyed caricatured By a Committee of the Senate rather than hung from a tree Judge tomorrow we will reconvene assume Judge Its your choice assume you wish to come back tomorrow The Committee is not demanding that you come back Would you like to come back tomorrow think so Senator d like to finish this Most most of the senators who were uh on the Committee tonight Uh think were stunned at the anger It is impossible to absolutely resolve these two stories Does he not have a point when he says the leakage of this stuff the dirty character of it amounts in part at least to an attempting lynching of Clarence Thomas This is about sexual harassment Agreed And about his fitness to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court None of what he said has any relevance But this is not a judicial proceeding This is political theater and Thomas just performed So he got you No m not saying anything he said was relevant Mmmhmm And hate that it was him of all people but he did tell a truth truth By saying that supporting me is synonymous with supporting lynching No no no m not trying to say that He is not the victim here m not trying to say that either Then what are you trying to say Charles Listen White folks are already talking this bullshit that this cant be about race cause youre both black right So what Thomas just did No listen to me Listen to me My grandfather fled Arkansas because he was threatened with lynching appreciate that real lynching Not this metaphoric kind that Thomas is talking about But he doesnt care about that He only acknowledged race because it was about him But thats not right m not saying it is right Its not the issue The issue is sexual harassment But it was effective Now you think any of those white boys on that Committee are prepared to challenge him now You know what really pisses me off Hes trying to dismiss you precisely because youre a black woman Hmm You and both know that this hearing and his nomination would be in a very different place if you looked like his wife Hmm Good youre still here Youre not gonna believe this Theres another woman Her name is Angela Wright She worked for Thomas after Anita Hill They never met never even heard of each other Shes a newspaper editor now but what she really wants to be is a columnist so to prove herself to her bosses she wrote a sample column know Thomas is capable of doing these things because he did them to me We need to depose her can tell you that during the course of the year that worked for Clarence Thomas there were several comments that he made And Clarence Thomas did consistently pressure me to date him Right and was there At one point Clarence Thomas made comments about my anatomy Can you He often said ve got some fine women on my staff remember him saying that one woman had a big ass Clarence Thomas commented on a dress that was wearing and asked what size my boobs were Clarence Thomas came by my house at night Miss Wright uninvited spoke in general terms but then tried to move the conversation over to the prospect of me dating him Is this on Were talking about a thing that you know She can hear pretty much pops out of Clarence Thomass mouth whenever the hell he feels like saying it Does the White House know about her We sent over a copy of her deposition Oh Theyre gonna love that arent they Yeah Okay triplecheck her credibility mean these situations pull all sorts of people out of the woodwork Attention seekers Yeah dont think thats the case here She didnt call us Someone else sent her column in And she has a corroborating witness It took some convincing to get her to talk but boy once she started loose cannon Possibly Plus he fired her Oh Exemployee disgruntled loose cannon Yeah Better yet All right bring her in She wont come Even though have got the guts of a bull dont necessarily relish the fallout from speaking up in this kind of situation Well m not gonna be the chairman who knew about a second accuser and didnt call her in Subpoena her if thats what it takes but get her down here however you have to Okay And somebody find me a goddamn dentist An eleventh hour surprise in the Clarence Thomas case According to the North Carolina newspaper The Charlotte Observer one of its own employees Angela Wright has some charges of her own to level New accusations are being leveled against the Supreme Court nominee This in addition to the allegation of sexual harassment made by law professor Anita Hill If thats the best witness they can dig up we bring her in Arlen has a field day disagree completely Any woman telling the same story whoever she is is bad for Clarence Sir Yes Jamie Bush the Presidents nephew called About what Dr Satinover Another psychiatrist in addition to the one were bringing in tomorrow Thank you Who told the lies Well two witnesses Judge Thomas and Anita Hill told precisely opposite stories under oath Which one lied word to boys and girls who may be in front of the television set at the moment We parents know this is usually your time of day If todays testimony is anything like yesterdays there may once again be extremely graphic testimony that you may not want your children to watch It was hot off the presses in San Francisco this morning The controversy with more questions than answers The windburned fisherman who believes the professor When a woman at her age gets down in front of the public and gives herself up like that that man is guilty as far as m concerned The sex harassment victim who trusts the judge Just didnt seem to me like she was telling the truth In Compton California at the nations only chapter to support Clarence Thomas people still cant believe a black woman is his accuser The ordeal continues on this Saturday morning and it can only be called that an ordeal for Clarence Thomas for Anita Hill for the Senate Judiciary Committee and for the nation as well This is round two of these renewed hearings of course on Anita Hills accusations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas Theyll be finished with Thomas by end of day Do we have all our folks lined up for tomorrow The four friends of Anita who remember her telling them about the harassment at the time Three lawyers one judge Make sure the Committee has their credentials We also sent them the names of the three psychologists who will say that Anitas behavior is consistent with victims of sexual harassment Get them the published research on that as well That other woman Angela Wright Shes gonna bring this thing home think the line is the absolute truth They are delighted with Thomass performance last night They felt that the whole dynamic of the hearing changed John did the White House have a piece of this strategy Were they in on the idea of invoking race They were in on the idea They knew exactly what Clarence Thomas was going to say In this country when it comes to sexual conduct we still have underlying racial attitudes about black men and their views on sex Once you pin that on me cant get it off Anita Hill said he discussed oral sex between men and women Yes m a client Can you tell him m here But nobody in the Senate bothered telling me where the hell m supposed to go Thomas liked to discuss specific sex acts and frequency of sex Now that last Frequency That could have to do with black men supposedly being very promiscuous or something like that So it could be partially stereotypical Yes Well m concerned Well was talking about these hearings with a friend of mine and when told him what thought as a mental health professional he said to me This is something the senators need to hear Doctor And at first was just flabbergasted but then halfway through her testimony it hit me Erotomania beg your pardon Its a psychiatric disorder The person suffering has delusions that another person usually of a higher status has a romantic interest in him or her Youre not kidding Now this exists Ever read this book No The Exorcist What the hell is he doing No Senator You said you never did say Who has put pubic hair on my Coke You never did talk about Long Dong Silver submit those things were found from page of this particular version of The Exorcist Dennings had remarked to him in passing said Sharon that there appeared to be quote an alien pubic hair floating around in my gin unquote This is ridiculous You think that was spoken by happenstance think it is very well that you were not here to hear the testimony of Miss Hill m Angela Wright m here to see my lawyer Gil Middlebrooks Okay Welcome to They havent called you in yet You can wait here till they do And here we are Youve been before us for days m waiting for days of surveillance of Miss Hill Then well see you know who ate the cabbage The fuck is he talking about as we say out in the Wild West And now Christs sake rein these guys in cant really am getting stuff over the transom about Professor Hill have got letters hanging out of my pockets have got faxes have got statements from her former law professors Statements from people that know her Statements from Tulsa Oklahoma saying watch out for this woman But nobody has the guts to say that because it gets all tangled up in this sexual harassment crap Have they scheduled Angela Wright Call you back Shes in the mix What does that mean Theres a schedule Shes either on it or shes not Carolyn theres a Washington Post reporter Hes found a video store owner who claims that Thomas is a longtime customer of his Rented lots of hardcore porn What What Should get his number so we can talk to him Or is that No Yes absolutely No Yes God there is a law against that We do not expose citizens private viewing records Carolyn Hart Wow Angela Wright Thats us we should go will soon be with us We think but now were told that Angela Wright has what we used to call in the legal trade cold feet Wait what Is Angela Wright backing out No went over the witness list with Bidens office Shes still on it So hes lying He knows shes a threat Hes discrediting her Exactly Did you fire her And if you did what for Um she referred to a male member of my staff as a faggot Thats a lie did no such thing That was enough for you That was more than enough That is kind of the way you are isnt it That is how am when it comes to that kind of conduct Shes a credible witness thatll testify Thomas harassed her too and theyre smearing her just like they smeared Anita This is completely unethical Exactly wont get into those old saws but will tell you that do love Shakespeare and Shakespeare would love this This is about love and hate and cheating and disgust and avarice All those things that make that remarkable bard read today Othello Read Othello and dont ever forget this line Good name in man and woman dear my Lord Christ You remember this scene Is the immediate jewel of our souls Good evening Clarence Thomas went on the attack today accusing his critics of using blatant racism Thank you to keep him off the Supreme Court But he said he had rather died They said theyll call you tomorrow The dramatic testimony came during a grueling Mmmhmm They apologize for any inconvenience Did they apologize for trashing my reputation Did they apologize for that Have a nice day sir Chief of Staff John Sununu telling Anita Hills credibility has been undermined and that calls to the White House are overwhelmingly in Thomass favor Even the people at the White House were stunned by what they consider the lackluster performance of the Democrats They couldnt understand why they were just sitting there and not challenging Thomas and being more assertive We need to be pushing harder to the press We need to push back Well they beat us to that Journalists calling to confirm Anitas lesbianism and to inquire about an official diagnosis of erotomania What is that Think it means what it says In a decision that apparently was personally approved by the President they decided to go after her and to float all sorts of stories about erotic fantasies and that she has psychological problems Today spectators will watch corroborating witnesses attempt to support both Judge Thomas and Professor Hill and continue to struggle with who is telling the truth Have you seen these Fifty percent of Americans believe him Twentyfive percent believe her Ricki Your boss is fucking this up It is not your place to tell the chairman of the Judiciary Committee how to do his job Last time checked you worked for a senator too and maybe you should bring it up with him Are you sure you want to do this Yes Because therell be no way to keep it quiet Checked on Anita Hills former students in Oklahoma And whatd you find They basically all said the same thing Shes tough but fair Senator Browns office did talk to some guys from Oral Roberts where she worked before Oklahoma and they did have a story but it seemed pretty Whatd they say Well they said that Anita Hill had put pubic hair between the pages of their term papers Anita Hill put pubic hairs in her students term papers No dont think so That is what they said but it was after the whole Coke can thing so We need affidavits from them We do Okay Um sorry it just seems so unlikely that Well we have no idea whats likely or unlikely from this woman Sorry sir Yes sir news poll conducted just yesterday shows most Americans believe that neither Thomas nor his accuser Anita Hill told the entire truth was hoping could have a quick word with you if its okay Sure Sit Okay so let me start by saying get why youve been quiet through all of this m sure a lot of people much smarter than me have told you thats the way to go And who knows Maybe theyre right but Shes all alone out there sir You ever taken a polygraph before Miss Hill No have not Okay She told me she was being subjected to sexual harassment from her boss That boss was Clarence Thomas She told me Clarence Thomas asked her out on dates and showed an unwanted sexual interest in her Is she in your estimation a woman who suffers from fantasies in any way or is she pretty levelheaded Shes one of the most levelheaded people know Thank you Judge Is your name Anita Hill Yes Various psychiatrists have come forward to state as a general principle not as a diagnosis of an individual but as a general principle that there is a specific disorder So here is this foul stack of stench justifiably offensive in any category and ask you why after she left his power or whatever it was that gave her fear or revulsion or repulsion Why did she twice after that visit personally with him in Tulsa Oklahoma get Christmas cards from people dont see from one end of the year to the other end and do not wish to also return their cards and will return their calls And these are people who have insulted me and done things which perhaps have been degrading at times But these are the things you have to put up with And being a black woman you have to put up with a lot So you grit your teeth and you do it Senator Kennedy Thank you Mr Chairman Some people just dont want to believe you You have to understand that they just dont want to believe you and they dont want to believe Professor Hill But hope Mr Chairman hope that were not going to hear a lot more comments unworthy unjustified comments about fantasy stories picked out of books and law cases after weve heard from this panel hope we can clear this room of the dirt and innuendo about overthetransom information hope were going to be sensitive to the attempts of character assassination on Professor Hill Theyre unworthy And quite frankly hope were not going to hear a lot more about racism as we consider this nominee Fact is that these points of sexual harassment are made by an AfroAmerican against an AfroAmerican The issue isnt discrimination and racism Its about sexual harassment And hope we can keep our eye on that particular issue Thank you Thank you Senator Kennedy Within the last few minutes we just found out that Professor Anita Hill has taken a polygraph test and according to the expert that administered it to her she passed it She offered to take a lie detector test Thats not the hallmark of someone whos lying At a golf outing President Bush said he saw no reason for either Hill or Judge Clarence Thomas to take such a test dont want to be in a position of advocating that every nominee takes a lie detector test And think its a stupid idea Of course shell pass a polygraph because the disorder makes her believe she is telling the truth Republicans complaining bitterly that as Orrin Hatch said you can find any polygraph tester to produce any results you want He called it the sleazy tactic of a twobit sleaze lawyer It seems to me that in the country for that great band in the middle somewhere that their judgment swings from session to session This afternoon Anita Hills friends and supporters made a very credible appearance Tonight his friends and supporters and coworkers are making credible performances Hes a man of high moral standing and tell you that its not possible that he could be linked with the kinds of things that have been alleged against him here have known Judge Clarence Thomas for more than years and find the allegations by Miss Hill not only ludicrous but totally inconsistent and in opposite to his principles and his personality She played the role of a meek innocent shy Baptist girl from the South who was a victim of this big bad man Chairman Thomas that have known for years is absolutely incapable of the abuses described by Professor Hill In my case she had fantasized about my being interested in her romantically Et tu Brutus You too Anita Extraordinary hearings on the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas continue and are expected to go on long into the night Tomorrow Professor Anita Hill and Judge Clarence Thomas have been invited back to wrap up their testimony Extraordinary is a word that may be not quite strong enough Carole This thing has ground on now for hours through the day and into the night Some Republican senators are still trying to prevent the Committee from hearing testimony from another witness whos come forward against Thomas At first we thought it was going to be a national encounter on sexual harassment And now it has turned ugly Its almost a murdersuicide pact between Democrats and Republicans Just no one wins talked to Joel Paul Hes been getting threatening phone calls and hes worried he wont get tenure Because he was a character witness for me Yes If we can get Thomass porn rental records say we get them Absolutely not no Joe this is a dirty fight Theres no second place If we dont win we lose At what cost Patrick m getting calls into my office Hundreds an hour American citizens saying whatever the hell you people are doing down there with the Coke cans and Long Dong Ding whatever the fuck it is stop it We have an obligation to make sure were putting the right person on the Supreme Court also have an obligation to uphold the dignity and the credibility of the United States Senate Yeah Hows that going If there is a consensus in this nation tonight it is that no one likes whats going on and there are no real winners We have gone from shock to discomfort now to a combination of anger depression and shame No you are not introducing that vile obvious bullshit Maybe its and maybe its not Joe You dont know Its just like this bogus movie rental stuff and this Angela Wright If you want to introduce questionable testimony on national television ve got a doozy right here You know weve got the votes back Joe We have a solid in the Senate Well probably pick up one or two more by Tuesday so we can keep talking dirty to the nation if you want but it wont change the outcome Jack is this who you want to be This is a freeforall Joe There are no rules Somebody who goes after a woman like this with no holds barred You know this is a street fight Joe And if a friend of mine is attacked in a street fight m gonna pick up a crowbar Hey take that shit with you So came all the way here for nothing The Committee appreciates your willingness to participate Willingness was subpoenaed While it is Chairman Bidens desire that you testify the time constraints we find ourselves under are making that impossible Time constraints ve been here a day and a half So the chairman would like to withdraw your subpoena He will enter your deposition into the written record unrebutted This agreement is by mutual consent He would like you to sign it What if dont Theyll fill the time with other witnesses so they really do run out of time Angela Wright is not going to testify What No By mutual agreement they say That is bullshit The deposition is going into the written record so the senators will know what she said If they read it which they wont Which they wont Correct This was a mistake This is why never came forward before What good have we done My friends jobs are being threatened My reputation is ruined For what You will testify tomorrow and set the record straight have said everything that came here to say but they dont want to hear it They dont care They only want to win Theres got to be something we can do There has to be something else that we can do We need to get the names You all have worked very hard And if m letting you down m sorry Call Judiciary Tell them m done want to go home Ladies thank you so much We certainly appreciate your testimony here today Obviously we didnt recognize or realize we were going to go quite as late as we did tonight Senator But thats Both Professor Hill and Judge Thomas have decided not to appear tomorrow Based on that this entire proceeding is ended Fiftytwo votes Fiftytwo votes Congratulations Thomass supporters claim that he has the votes to win the confirmation when the full Senate votes at pm on Tuesday But the situation is now so muddled and so confused after three days of lurid inconclusive testimony that nobodys sure of anything except that the whole process has been distasteful Hey Whod you believe him or her Her The chair will remind the galleries that expressions of approval or disapproval are prohibited The question is on the confirmation of the nomination of Clarence Thomas of Georgia to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court The clerk will call the roll Mr Adams No Mr Akaka No Mr Baucus No Mr Bentsen No Mr Biden No Mr Bingaman No Mr Bond Aye Hey Welcome home Thank you Is this all For you Yup All of it Whats it say Dear Professor Hill For years ve been a cashier All that time my boss has treated me like his personal

Wow Mr Wellstone No Mr Wirth No Mr Wofford No The yeas are and the nays are The nomination of Clarence Thomas of Georgia to be Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court is hereby confirmed Clarence Its good news It was not too long ago that a colleague of mine complimented me on my appearance and then said that he was going to chase me around the House floor The last time the federal government polled all its workers of the women reported they had been recently sexually harassed So Hal tell us what happens now Well what happens now is weve got a political issue for the campaign Two percent may be good for milk but it aint good for the United State Senate Whats different this year is the record number of women running and winning up and down the ticket One factor there and elsewhere is backlash over the Senates treatment of Anita Hill womans voice does not count in America today have not been sexually harassed but have been very obviously discriminated against Happened something like years ago But youre aware that women also Wait Wait Sam remember every word of it If we stay mad about Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill well never remember our lines Oh Please Sir would you please state your name Long Dong Silver The rules of the old boys club that prevailed in this hearing are simply not going to work anymore The Senate Judiciary Committee is getting diversity Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois and Californias Dianne Feinstein have been assigned to the panel Women for the first time in my lifetime have said we are players in this society and we intend to stay that way On Thursday President Bush signed a longawaited civil rights bill which will make it much easier for women and minorities to sue for discrimination and harassment on the job It does not have to be a physical touch or a specific threat Companies now produce videos explaining it can be any unwanted sexual advances bill to combat violence against women was introduced in the Senate You should have the civil rights protection as well as the criminal laws protection This has become a national teacher on the issue of sexual harassment just think that youre getting caught up in the politics of it when what youre forgetting is that theres a human being a woman involved Theres a man too Okay Thatd be Clarence Thomas His is the name thats been made mud of Theres clearly a brassknuckles totally unfair process of brutalizing Presidential appointees How much of an exploration of not only Supreme Court candidates but all candidates for public office do you want Do you have anything further to say about it Senator my reaction to this has been Over the last two weeks has been one of horror cant tell you what ve lived through think did the right thing think did what was proper and correct in this situation Rasputin Rasputin Rasputin
