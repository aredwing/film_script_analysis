merchants of Bexar And he didnt find any at Emils warehouse Its my opinion its all hidden in the basement of that church And Mr Crockett The defenders of Texas are going to need that powder against Santa Anna And youre against Santa Anna Bitterly Of course And this uh Emil Hes for him Yes he is Then how did he figure youd marry him Political arguments dont flavour folks supper Nevertheless am

shame kids have to grow up into people Its good were all here gentlemen cigar Please make yourselves comfortable have some news Fannin is doing well at Goliad He has mustered almost a thousand men and should be ready to move south by the first of the week thousand It dont seem possible It does sound too good to be true must confess But we can only admit our doubts to each other In the privacy of a room and not in front of the men As far as the volunteers are concerned were sure Fannin has a thousand men got a reputation for truth Travis aint Everybody says m a born liar But whether we talk out loud or quiet dont seem to me the point right now The point is how many men has Fannin and will he get here in time Whether he does or doesnt well be trapped here And for no reason We should burn all of Bexar including this mission And annoy Santa Anna while he sweeps north across the whole of Texas Thats Colonel Bowies theory We could hit and run Jump him at every creek crossing You seem to forget one thing Colonel That command And have already decided against your plan Now Let us attack a more important problem Colonel Crocketts Tennesseans Will they fight Colonel Last time saw em they hadnt shown any strong feelings against fighting Can you persuade them to come here can ask them And youre a very persuasive man according to your reputation Build up the story that Fannin has a thousand no two thousand men Play down the size of Santa Annas Weve been through this He wants me to lie to my men too Keep em here with lies Let the truth of Santa Annas strength be known and there wont be a dozen left You calling my boys cowards Let us dispense with the pyrotechnics Remember this My men are volunteers Theyre here because they wanna be But theres nothing to keep em from gettin outta here m aware that your men are militia And like all volunteers undisciplined Good day Colonel Bowie Last night gave you a pretty good idea of the discipline of my men Our position here is desperate And feel sure that where Crockett leads his men will follow Yeah Thats a responsibility thats been kinda worrying me Thank you gentlemen m gonna pass the word around What you Texans use for drinkin whiskey is drinkin whiskey And whats more important you got real good manners seein how you suffer the handicap of having never been in Tennessee Davy is it true that you fit a fourday fight with Mike Fink Why thats a blasted lie One of them stories loosemouthed people tell around Mike and me quit at sundown Wouldnt have been the fourth day until uh next morning See you men Let her rip Parson Seora Lpez Don Juan this is Mr Davy Crockett m honoured How do you do Seor Seguin is the alcalde mean the mayor of San Antonio de Bexar Hes got a pretty busy town People are running like sheep

fight for him Have some breakfast Breakfast Tortillas Tamale Never get burnt drinking this stuff Well only know part of Texas and none of these Texicans is related to me so why should fight for them Right Aint our ox thats gettin gored Talkin about whose ox gets gored figure this fella gets in the habit of goring oxes whets his appetite He may come up north next and gore yours Men were in a little fix sort of The hebull around here General Santa Anna Hes mad at us Yeah Hes wrote us a letter cant read it Its in Spanish But the young lady will It is addressed to Davy Crockett and the Tennesseans who accompany him Be it known You are interlopers in a country where you are neither wanted nor welcome This is the order you are given Depart with all haste and at once because it has come to our attention that you are possibly considering joining the rebels now skulking in the mission This is not your fight Depart Should you fail to abide by this order shall chastise you even unto death Signed Generalissimo Antonio Miguel de Santa Anna Huh Fella kinda fancies himself dont he Sure does have a bigsounding name Givin us orders Who do he think he am Andy by God Jackson Riles me when somebody tells me to go here or cant go there aint never been run out of no place Except the time my old paw kicked me over every acre of that halfsection back there in Ohio But was just a shirttail kid then My paw had big feet What do you say Davy Are we gonna let this man tell us what we can or cant do Davy maybe wed better saddle up and pay this fella a visit Do chastise mean what think it do It do Davy lets do saddle up and go learn that gentleman his manners We wont have to Hes wearin out horses comin toward us Well guess we cant stop him from coming But reckon we can arrange for him to limp going back was thinking these Texicans wasnt as neighbourly as they might be But here theyve gone and arranged a nice fight for us visitors One thing oughta tell you Santa Anna never wrote that letter did Or rather had this lady here write it was figuring how to tell you fellas about this Texican hoedown wondered what Santa Anna wouldve said to us if hed had a chance to say it Davy aint never said aint been whupped have But give every one of them fellas a chance to dig in and get the job done But aint never took nobodys word that they was gonna chas Chastise Chastise Much

Crockett has brains Kept it hidden a number of years You like my Tennesseans Flaca Oh yes Could strain and never come up with better Every one of those men has been at my elbow save the boy Smitty when some difficulty arose Some of them dont bathe as often as polite folks would think necessary But every one of them smells sweet to me And was the one that said this country was burntover sand Its green and growing Like those green pastures they talk about Lord above Thats one beautiful tree This tree mustve been growed before man put his first dirty footprints on this prairie Kind of a tree Adam and Eve must have met under You know something Flaca guess saw who knows how many trees before ever took a long thoughtful look at one Mostly looked at a tree to see was there a bear in it or an

talking about all people everywhere When came down here to Texas was looking for something didnt know what It seems like you added up my life and d spent it all either stomping other men or in some cases getting stomped Had me some money and had me some medals But none of it seemed a lifetime worth the pain of the mother that bore me Its like was empty Well m not empty any more Thats whats important To feel useful in this old world To hit a lick against whats wrong or to say a word for whats right even though you get walloped for sayin that word may sound like a Biblebeater yellin up a revival at a camp meeting but that dont change the truth none Theres right and theres wrong You gotta do one or the other You do the one and youre living You do the other and you may be walking around but youre dead as a beaver hat d hoped for a horse but theres nothing wrong with a good strong mule My things All my luggage is in the buggy Had my men take care of it Your geegaws may be roughpacked but theyre all there You are sending me away You You talked about the fight against evil but you You are sending me to safety Flaca you have an important name You know a million words and how they should be used m sending you to fight your war to talk up a howling mob ll stay here and hit a lick hope you can drive a mule His names Jess they told me He seems a good honest mule Maybe ll never see you again If thats whats written thats whats written When its time its time Talkin only makes it the harder Flaca So stir up that mule Davy You never pray do you Davy never found the time Sir

insubordination take my people out at daybreak Colonel Travis m an old man but youre wrong That Jethro Reminds me of a story Please Crockett No homespun wisdom No crackerbarrel philosophy None of the backwoods wit for which you are famous Good night Youd better slack off on me mister This code of honour business doesnt bother me a bit When theres trouble come from any direction as sudden and

Up here is the Sabine River Somewhere around here Sam Houston is trying to organise an army And right in between is the Alamo Santa Anna cant go around and leave a fort along his lines of communication He must reduce the Alamo by storm Every minute of time we buy for Sam Houston is another precious minute in the life of Texas And nobody is ever going to say that William Barrett Travis did not buy every minute possible Makes sense Why didnt you tell Bowie that commander does not have to explain his every decision You explained to me have great respect for you Crockett But have none
