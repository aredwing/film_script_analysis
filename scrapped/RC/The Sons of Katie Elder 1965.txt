l bet you ten bucks the steps of that train dont stop no more than one foot from that line Show a little respect Five bucks Cut it out Were here for a funeral Which way is town Just follow the road You cant miss it You you know him No but l know that type And l dont like it What do you suppose hes doing here Well find out soon enough Excuse me lsnt there anybody else getting off No sir l guess he aint coming May as well go on with the funeral Oh thats a good way of putting it You couldve won yourselves five bucks apiece Did anybody else get off that train besides yourself Nope You know a man name of John Elder l know of him Would you be afraid of him No But you must be Thats why people hire me Theyre worried about somebody or scared Dont go jumping to any conclusions l didnt know that John Elder was even in these parts He probably isnt Maybe all youll have to do to earn your money is hang around for a while and then go back on another train Look l dont care what l have to do as long as l get paid Youll get paid Stow your gear in the house What are you hiring a gunman for Pa Youre too young to remember John Elder Whatve the Elders got to do with us Not the Elders just John What does he have to do with us When he left here this ranch belonged to his family This is our land We own it dont we Of course it is son Sure it is lts just that he might want to figure it differently And we need this land Were gonna keep it Thats a peculiar way to dress for a funeral Could turn out more than a funeral l dont get your point as John Elder didnt get off the train That doesnt mean he wont show up Even so a man isnt likely to shoot up his own mothers funeral Not without good reason He might think hes got a good reason Besides theres that other one that got off the train Ben John Elder isnt wanted for anything around here Remember that Hes a gunfighter That puts him on one side and me on the other And it was you who told me that in the first place Almighty God we commend the soul of our dear and pretty sister departed Katie Elder into your care as we commit her body to the ground beside her loved husband Katie Elder a woman beloved of all hardworking honest woman She helped in your work Lord in a thousand ways She was a friend to all a comforter to the sick She has left this world a little better for having lived in it Those who knew her and loved her are better for having lived in the warmth of her understanding Katie Elder lived here in Clearwater for many years All of us gathered here today knew her well She raised four sons John Tom Matt and Bud the youngest She was a woman who wanted nothing for herself wanted only to give rather than to receive She devoted her life to helping her family her friends Earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust ln the sure and certain belief in resurrection unto the eternal life God whose mercies cannot be numbered answer our prayers on behalf of thy servants soul and grant her an entrance into the land of light and joy in the fellowship of thy saints Amen Amen You know she sold me a blind horse once woman doing that to me She really suckered me good This is Katie She was named after your mother Shes a handsome baby l just thought you would like to know it One of you missing aint there Yes sir John the oldest He moves around a lot lf theres anything l can do Thank you Parson you done plenty Done what Wrote a few letters No sir that was a real nice sermon you gave She belonged to have pretty words spoke over her and l didnt do it l thought you spoke good Parson real good Not good enough not for her l dont suppose youd know that Billy Hello John You ought to have better sense than that coming up behind a man Youre as fast as you used to be maybe faster Been getting lots of practice Still havent got a newspaper here No but we do have a gossip about every twenty feet Why did you come into town the back way John You figuring on trouble Theres always somebody looking for some Clearwaters no different But thats one thing l dont want Billy trouble How long you planning to stay l dont know l just got here People usually let you take your hat off fore they ask you to leave lm not asking you to leave lm just asking how long you figure to stay ls there any reason why l shouldnt stay Yes as a matter of fact theres a couple of reasons For one this aint your home any more You gave that up some years ago Go on And two another man came to town today l understand hes real good with a gun Who is he l dont know Hes a stranger But l understand he hires out And three lve got myself a young deputy whos real conscientious about his job Am l wanted for anything Billy No Then l got a good idea Yeah You send that young deputy over to run that other fellow out of town l guess thatd be one way of doing it The only thing is hes not wanted for anything either l come to town to see Ma buried and to maybe say hello to my brothers Any objections No Fine You want to see the boys go that way You wont have to go through town The ranch is over there Not any more Morgan Hastings owns it now Kate was living in the Lupin place when she died When did that happen Billy Your pa was killed six months ago Who did it l havent been able to find out John Dont do anything foolish Youve been trying hard not to tell me something What is it You know that man that didnt get off the train The one were not scared of What about him Hes back How do you know its him Big fellow about sixfour pounds toughlooking lf theres any trouble make it look like selfdefence Nobody told me about John Elder until l got here And l aint about to let him draw first You do nothing unless l tell you to All right you tell me But lll handle it my own way l knew it The Elders are going to be coming asking how we got the place You stick to your bookkeeping lll handle the Elders lts not going to be easy Nothing comes easy lf you want to own a town youve got to put out something l was so little when you and John left that ls he really as fast with a gun as everyone says When he was a kid he was the fastest l was afraid to be in the same room Let me point one thing out That work doesnt pay well l can recommend my

me to look in on you if you came to the funeral Thats mighty nice of you maam l wasnt doing it for you or any of you lm doing it because Katie asked me to She liked that rocker She seemed to have confided a great deal in you Miss Gordon lf shed had her sons around her she wouldnt have had to confide in strangers She told me what fine men you were never forgetting her sending her money helping her send Bud through school She was so proud Her tall sons for whom she kept making up lies so she could hide her shame Blamed Texas for taking her sons Texas is a woman she used to say a big wild beautiful woman You raise a kid to where hes got some size and theres Texas whispering in his ear and smiling saying Come and have some fun lts hard enough to raise children shed say But when youve got to fight Texas a mother hasnt a chance Thats why she pushed Bud She let Texas beat her with the rest of you She was going to see Bud through college or die Well she died Miss Gordon tell me why did she set so much store by this rocker Your pa gave it to her She wouldnt have swapped it for a diamond ring Thanks for being so nice to her Nice to her More like she was nice to me or anybody She
