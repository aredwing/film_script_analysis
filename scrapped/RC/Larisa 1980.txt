The film director Larissa Shepitko died at the th kilometer of the Leningradsky Highway in a car accident She died together with her colleagues the cinematographer Volodya Chukhnov the production designer Yura Fomenko and three more members of the filming crew They just began shooting a film based on Valentin Rasputins book Farewell to Matyora Larissa had been dreaming of this work as though preparing herself for it all her life And that film was going to become the climax of her creative career Larissa Yefimovna had chosen me to play the part of Darya in her last film Matyora To me meeting her was like a miracle And m certainly happy to have been so close to that miracle Camera Darya whats the matter What will happen to us What Where am going from you Why pity Yegor so much Rolling Panorama Stop Action Stop Guilt without guilt is guilt too Thats why its hard for me to speak about Larissa Work on my novella Farewell to Matyora proved as you know for Larissa and her friends to be their last work remember the first time Larissa called me during one of my visits to Moscow and tentatively told me that she would like to film Matyora went to meet her having two goals in mind First to have a look at the film director Larissa Shepitko who had just amazed me with her film Ascent And second to try not to give Matyora to be filmed wanted to keep my novella in its generic genre of prose But Larissa managed to convince me pretty soon She began telling me how she saw her future film She spoke so enthusiastically she seemed so interested that forgot about not wanting to give Matyora away It was her ardor enthusiasm and selflessness even at the starting stage of work on the film that amazed me then was persuaded by our spiritual affinity which had never doubted since was persuaded by her creative not formal artistic reading of the book Thats how we reached our agreement And then the work on the film began Thats how the spirit of the flooded Matyora had been raised if we use the language of mysticism the spirit of Matyora which not understanding why for what purpose it had been disturbed then took from us a too great and irreplaceable sacrifice Mitya are you all right Mitya Mitya Wings is a film about people scorched by the war about the nevertobehealed wounds of memory about the insufferableness of wingless existence want to make a declaration of love Love is the only thing that never dies As there is no death Perhaps for the first time in my life realized that that if a person is talented that person is immortal And to my last day ll be proud of the fact that acted in Larissa Shepitkos films Remember how it was in The Great Waltz m giving you my word that theres nothing theres no frame in my film not a single one that doesnt come from me as a woman ve never engaged in copycatting never tried to imitate men because know very well that all the efforts of my girlfriends both older and younger than me to imitate mens cinema were just nonsensical because all this is secondary But make a distinction between ladies and mens cinema Theres no womens and mens cinema Theres ladies cinema and theres mens cinema Men too can do perfectly well the ladies sentimental needlework But a woman as one half of the humankind origin can tell the world reveal to the world some amazing things No man can so intuitively discern some phenomena in human psyche in nature as a woman can After Wings Larissa made You and to a script by Gennady Shpalikov Katya In that film Larissa came close to the central theme of her creative work the theme of merciless judgment of yourself the high responsibility each of us has for everything weve done in life was when we held a family counsel was finishing school It turned out that Larissa could write a little compose poems draw and sing Could do a bit of everything And none of those abilities was so definite for me to have the nerve to apply to an art school or a literature institute And a friend of ours said that theres a profession in which all those little bits might be very useful Whats this profession Film directing was a typical embryo It seems that Dovzhenko our master decided to trace by me the evolution of mankind Unfortunately my universities under his guidance were very shortlived He died months later In his person we came across the greatest humanist guess such people lived in the age of Renaissance But most important he was an absolutely uncompromising person You know to have lived all his years in accord with his conscience not to waive in anything never to go against any of his moral postulates always to tell people the truth straight to the face it was extremely difficult It goes without saying that there was no place for any falsity compromise mercenariness or hackwork dont know how could look him in the eye now When myself became an independent person came to know how difficult it is to follow his behests in life To declare them is one thing But how can one live so each day Every day every second prompts us to a practical necessity to make a compromise to maneuver keep silent sometimes make a concession in the hope of making up for it later It seems to be whats called life flexibility It demands it forces us Its not only us who do it actually But it turns out that if we think we can be cunning just for seconds but make up for it later in art it brings punishment a most cruel and irreversible punishment You cant make a film today just for money Well ll make this passing movie ll give in here ll say what they want there ll try to please them here and avoid saying it there here ll tell only a halftruth there ll hush it up altogether but in my next film ll make up for it ll tell everything want in full measure as a creative person should as an artist as a citizen ll tell it all Its a lie Its impossible Its hopeless to deceive yourself by this illusion If you stumbled once youll never get back on the path of truth youll forget the way there You cant step twice into the same river Larissa was born just before the war and with her family had gone through all the hardships of the time air raids hunger work unfit for a child Those impressions can never be forgotten theyre burning you and remain with you forever think it was then that an invisible bud sprouted the bud of the future work that came many years later the ultimate achievement of the director Larissa Shepitko her film Ascent If your life had been enriched with care for another person then you have already justified your existence This is evidence of the spiritual life of a person These riches belong not to you personally but to the public if you live by the life of other people Therere things that are sacred to all of us Therere welldefined notions of good and evil of our morals Therere such everlasting qualities as love for your homeland What is this What are we born into this world for What will we contribute to this world How can we make life better In the final analysis my possibilities as a person Your possibilities Youre watching the very last shot made by Larissa An eternal tree the symbol of indestructibility and dignity the symbol of faith in the endless continuation of what we call life Working on the film Klimov Yu Skhirtladze Rodionov Petrov Schnittke Klass Vengerovsky et al Commenting on Larissa Shepitko
