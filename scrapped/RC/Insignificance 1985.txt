Yes Professor Yes yes Professor Yes Good evening Professor It sure is a dog of a night Sorry to bother you so late But uh thought that there was something that had to be said and its gotta be said before the morning Yep it sure is a dog of a night Tomorrows gonna be a dog of a day Hey Is this the stuff you hump around with you all the time Must be a few years work right there huh m not an

things Well dont know maam was told to take you straight to your des Well fuck them Destination Well was told no stopping Please Its important Just for me huh Okay For me Youre not on trial here You know that You know Youre not being accused of anything You know You are not the accused If you feel accused that makes me a very unhappy man Sit down Sit down will ya Now tell me Are you feeling accused feel persecuted Hmm Are you now Or have ever been Cheer up will you Professor Thats not an accusation Do you understand Its just an inquiry You want a drink But uh off the record would you tell me what What do you think your answer to a question like that would be mean it seems to me itd be simple as just a yes or a no But youd be surprised how many citizens find it hard to just even say those two words and theyve turned these hearings into one royal pain in the butt You know how many times one guy cited the Fifth Amendment Guess You never get it Seventynine times He got awfully tired Look all m asking you is for a simple answer to a simple question so that we can all get home for the long weekend Professor havent seen my sweet wife in over a month The last time bought tickets had to cancel We had two extra sessions to try that jumpedup nigger Robeson for contempt Ah And missed the damn plane Professor let me make this perfectly clear you know Now military men and politicians theyll wallow around in the mud and they come up smelling roses But not you Nah no Not you You Youre in a special category You know a different type You know what The movie star type The kind that mud sticks to You help us and ll help you come out nice and clean Uhhuh Nice and clean Nice and clean bet know what you want me to do to come out nice and clean You want me to answer yes Isnt that right Right Ah Mmm Yes Yes would be just fine by us Uhhuh And if you couple that with a denunciation of any Communist ideals you once held mean that would be a good plus as well Uh and you could mention a couple of names Mmhmm Is that all Well a formal condemnation of the Soviet arms initiative wouldnt do you any harm at all Huh In confidence between us Professor ll tell you something These hearings are not gonna go on much longer You could be our last great civilian fish And what a fish mean you know everything there is to know about everything the cosmos space pootons protons clutons mean everything The Jewish problem They call you the mommy and the daddy of the bomb true child of the universe Well have to tell you something about all this In my lifetime of experiences the Swiss authorities called me a German fascist disregarding that m Jewish But you delicately alluded to that a moment ago And in Germany by the German fascists because was Jewish was called a Zionist conspirator come to democratic America some smallminded people called me a German fascist and a Zionist conspirator And now presume that you are suggesting that m a Soviet Communist Well listen Two weeks ago two magazines at the same time variously called me a warmonger and a conscientious objector in the review of the same speech And you know what that speech was To the Mozart Appreciation Society of New England And its unbelievable ll tell you on or off the record You people like things on the record didnt choose America dont care Had but known it was escaping Dachau Funny how you talk to a good Jew nowadays that subject always comes up Dachau Thats the same threat to democracy were asking you to help us fight now World War had had very little to do with Communism Had very little to do Are you kidding The whole war was based on a Soviet plot Soviet plot Yes Fifteen million Russians dead a Soviet plot Theyre tricky Ask yourself this Professor What is left of Europe that is a threat to the Soviets Round one is theirs So what do you say say that you oughta go see a psychiatrist No no never mind that They havent learned how to treat that degree of lunacy yet What say is uh say good night say we should say good night now Oh It would be a shame really if all you stood for was to get muddied up over some haggling over constitutional legalities Dont make the mistake of treating this like some uh freshman debate on civil liberties Some guys have tried that One guy tried it He did great for that day In fact he got applauded by the fucking stenographer Well he aint earned jack shit since And neither has the stenographer Now how about a little cooperation here will explain it very clearly and simply will never ever under any condition testify You have been subpoenaed to testify We paid for your flight and the room Nonetheless tomorrow m going to speak to the conference for world peace Its true that your subpoena coincides with that date but it wont prevent me from speaking at the conference And Senator if had intended to go fishing tomorrow your subpoena wouldnt prevent me from catching fish or at least trying to catch fish Trying to catch fish Well you ignore a House subpoena my friend and uh thatll be about the last thing in the world you do And oh by the way yes from what understand youve refused to let anyone make copies of your work Now why is that mean you know if something were to happen God forbid that would all go astray Professor see you tomorrow morning bright and early m afraid youre gonna have to let the uh peace conference slug it out for themselves You know theres nothing to worry about anyway There aint anybody gonna go pressing any buttons Weve all got too much invested Just think of the real estate Good night Hey mister How much are your balloons Three for a buck lady Ooh ll take three Hey miss Yeah We got a special on the candy Its free to all the pretty girls today Oh wow Thanks Yeah Furillo National League batting champion comes through with another hit a single through the middle Campanella scores The ball is picked up by catcher Berra Meyers at third Hodges slides Hes called out Kress is through with a booming double with two men on May ask maam what sort of movie this is youre making Who Who is it youre playing maam play this girl Shes a what not a who Shes just a figment of this guys imagination He imagines me hanging around the place you know spend the entire movie in the kitchen or in the bathtub or having my skirt blown up around my fucking ears Hey sweetheart Get your ass over here ve been out there since before midnight Eighteen fast Hey look what shes got think its a watch Let me see it There hold it Hold her hand No got it Let me see Come on Youre a chicken Yeah Why dont you try coming up Yeah Yeah Na nana nana You cant get it Have you got a watch Yeah got a watch Its almost No Dont tell me the time dont wanna know Can just borrow it Please You can have it back tomorrow Thanks Hey Stop there Right over there Over there Who is it You wouldnt believe me Hi Hello Are you busy Its only m m probably being pursued This is an awful liberty know but m very honored to meet you Uh who is it thats pursuing you Just about everybody Hey thought youd be asleep Its almost Would you like me to go Uh no no Please please please just had to come meet you before you fly home or fly west And just havent had a moment ve been shooting all week My movie that is You dont recognize me Do you No Thats just wonderful interrupted your work No its just some calculations What are you trying to calculate Actually m attempting to unify the fields Will it take long Ah hope within another four years Oh Gee You are an actress Mmhmm Whats your name Oh Oh ve heard of her Is she good She tries hard Why is she here For a visit Why Youre famous So are you know We have an awful lot in common Hello What Who else No Who else How much All right Because of being famous everywhere go people fall all over themselves to be with me Like a troupe of clowns chasing an old automobile Ah Because of being famous many things do just turn into a ridiculous comedy Youre lucky Everything do develops into a nightmare People keep throwing themselves in front of me and just dont dare stop Have disturbed you No No Shall go No No Its late just spent the last four hours of my life having my skirt blown up around my ears They rigged up this fan beneath the grating out on rd Whoosh All night long Do you ever get the feeling it might be later than you think Anyway just knew my only chance to see you before you fly away or died of intimate exposure would be to wake you up in the middle of the night So said to myself Go ahead because if he doesnt understand how you have to wake people up in the middle of the night sometimes then nobody will So thought what the hell Have you ever noticed that what the hell is always the right decision to make What did you do tonight arrived and uh washed and uh got to work actually attempting to derive the tangential vector qualities of alpha squared but while was keeping at infinity You had a bad night too huh suppose so could have been watching a pretty girl having her skirt blown up above her ears Would you have watched Would you have liked me to Yes It would have embarrassed me The others they didnt embarrass me dont think a girl should go through something like that without feeling embarrassed Doesnt seem natural somehow Well just wonder why um would my watching have embarrassed you whereas the others didnt They just saw a star doing glamorous things right there on the block Youd have seen a girl showing her legs to a bunch of jerks Look Could explain something to you Um certainly What The theory of relativity All of it No Just the specific The general theory is a little bit too complicated to go into this late Dont you think Oh please ll never have another chance to prove it Uh But why do you have to prove it You know what you know You dont believe me If you say you understand relativity then believe you understand relativity Youre just saying that to to avoid seeing me embarrass myself No Certainly not You honestly believe understand relativity Yes Swear to God Um whose God Yours Um You better prove it With my God dont wanna take any chances No no no m not theoretic demonstrate Come on bought a few things You stand there for a second There Sit down Oh Here Wait Hmm Now there are two things you have to know The first thing is if drop a copy of The Brothers Karamazov in a moving train it doesnt fly backwards and flatten the conductor It just drops relative to the train So if anyone is conducting an experiment in a moving train or in the laboratories in Princeton the results will always be the same Because no matter where his springs and rulers and balls are hes there too Thats the first thing you have to know The second thing you have to know is that light absolutely always travels at the same speed in all directions at once It got faster We got more accurate Oh Dont confuse me Now then we have to imagine a man driving in a car at miles an hour and a hitchhiker standing by the road waiting for a lift Now the cars traveling at miles an hour And the man inside the car throws a stone at the hitchhiker at another miles an hour Now hes a league pitcher So the question is if the cars going miles an hour and the stone is going at another how many miles an hour is the stone going when it hits the hiker Answer Sixty miles an hour Right Mmm Pretty straightforward But now lets forget about the stone Instead well imagine the car is traveling at miles an hour and he Wait a minute We have to put the hitchhiker back All right Imagine The car is driving along and hes flashing his headlights at the hitchhiker telling him to get the hell out of the road Does the light travel at point The answer no Why Because the speed of light is always the same Right Did you ever prove that hypothesis Its never been disproved Lets hope it never is Mmhmm You ready Here we go We have to imagine two locomotives speeding past each other at a hell of a speed red one and a green one Now the driver of each train Youre the driver of the red train Turn it on when say go okay Has a flashlight which he turns on at the precise moment that they pass each other Now remember the light from the flashlight travels at the same speed regardless of the speed of the flashlights themselves So Each light Turn it on Okay Come on Okay Go Both lights expand together Turn it on In all directions just like a single sphere of light Not only that its time as well You got a watch Cause youre gonna need it Now we have to imagine this room is the entire universe And we begin together someplace in spacetime and we synchronize it What does your watch say travel away from you at a hell of a speed Say onefifth the speed of light And travel for five minutes and it gets me here Now look at my watch It says minutes past But its not very reliable so look across the universe to check with your watch And what does your watch say Twenty minutes past Not to me it doesnt It says minutes past because minutes past hasnt reached me yet It takes a minute for me to see your watch because it takes a minute for the light to reach me See So your watch is getting slower and slower And now comes the thousanddollar question Remember if you look at my watch its gonna take a minute for it to reach you too So now what do you say my watch says Nineteen minutes past Which means you say m going more slowly than you while say youre going more slowly than me Shes beautiful God Not bad God Shes beautiful Isnt it So So So So given a constant frame of reference within which to experiment according to Galileos original principles and accepting the hypothesis that light always travels at miles per second in all directions at once the main point ve demonstrated is that all measurements of time and space are necessarily made relative to a single observer and are not necessarily the same for two independent observers And that is the specific theory of relativity Isnt it Amazing but true Now then you have to show me your legs Ooh promise never to exhibit these in public so long as youll promise not to lecture on nuclear physics Are you kidding couldnt if wanted to Its one thing remembering it just wish understood it all You learned it without understanding Mmhmm Its Its like riding on the subway know here get on where get off While m traveling dont know where the hell am suppose you must but then you dug all the tunnels Still understand the results and the premise guess thats the main thing huh Thats nothing Sorry If were to tell you that the moon was made out of cheese would you believe that Of course not But now if tell you its made out of sand Maybe If tell you know for sure Then would believe you So you know that the moon is made out of sand Yes But it isnt only said knew because you said you knew lied Knowledge isnt truth Its just mindless agreement You agree with me agree with someone else We all have knowledge We havent come any closer to the truth of the moon You can never understand anything by agreeing by making definitions Only by turning over the possibilities Thats called thinking If say know stop thinking As long as keep thinking come to understand That way might approach some truth Thats the best conversation ever had Is it over think it had better be Huh Hey girlfriend and played this game a few years ago We each made a list of the men we thought itd be nice to sleep with You came in third on mine Third Then figured out how old you are And you struck me off No silly moved you to the top Thank you But no thank you But you cant just throw me out onto the streets at this hour suppose not Youre welcome to stay But shall sleep in the bathtub Dont be absurd Its a fine American tradition But you cant sleep in the bathtub Well Cary Grant did it in the only American movie that saw And if its good enough for him its good enough for me Look we dont have to make love Wouldnt it be nice just to share the bed Perhaps could give you my phone number and youd be welcome to visit me in my home But youd never find the time for me d just end up on firstname terms with your answering service dont have an answering service have a secretary whose first name is a mystery to me have a small house on a large river full of fish that cant catch And do have a great deal of time to offer there Oh m sorry have none to offer you beyond tonight just hoped we could come together somehow in the middle of all this For an hour or so Then dont go Mmm Yeah but still ve got to sleep in the bathtub Youre calculating the shape of space right Yes And when youve finished youll have expressed the precise nature of the physical universe So So So do it tomorrow Itll be here wont Love is full of memories And when its gone Well baby life goes on Come on baby Dont you want me tonight Huh Dont you need me Huh Oh wish theyd switch me off prefer to look up The stars The stars are so far away They make me feel small and lonely All who look up feel small and lonely like the rest Does that make you

Youre gonna start with the easy ones first huh Well suppose we could discuss something we all know about but that would limit us to the last nine World Series and the names of the Seven Dwarfs You

the man doesnt want to talk Now get off your butt and lets go What is the shape of the universe Its not important You have things to discuss Goddamn it You tell her the shape of the friggin universe wanna take her home Tell her Please Uh Tell her Well thethe shape of the universe is difficult to describe Um if were to explain it it would come out as abstract symbols but tell you how to imagine it Imagine a dot so small that it has zero dimensions You extend the dot into a onedimensional line You turn around the line and youve got a twodimensional circle You flip the circle and youve got a threedimensional sphere And youve got that sphere and you turn it into the fourth dimension and you got the shape of the uni You have the shape of the universe but know know how know now exactly how you can imagine it Take a completely solid object a completely solid object and twist it inside out indefinitely forever and thats the shape of the universe Wow Bullshit tell you what think it is think its round Like everything else in nature like flowers like the moon and the sun Its all based on a circle You know that Like the world dont know what you two geniuses think the shape of the world is but me and Columbus happen to think its round Its a damnlucky thing for the United States too Because if it wasnt for Columbus wed all be Indians What do you think about that Get your goddamn
