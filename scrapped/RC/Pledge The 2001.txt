look into the tactics of the Becker County Sheriffs office You okay Yes thank you Sheriffs investigators worked in concert with Reno homicide detectives for several hours piecing together the trail that led to the brisk apprehension of Wadenah Authorities here while understandably disturbed by the brief hostagetaking of one of their deputies are taking some comfort in the swift justice of this very dramatic evening Yet while an investigation is underway the consensus seems clear Wadenah confessed after being identified by the young snowmobiler His suicide brought a brutal end Final boarding call Northwest flight to Cabo San Lucas Customer Oliver Morning Morning Nice day today Can we help you with anything in particular Well actually there is m looking for a person Annalise or AnnaLisa Hansen Yes She would live above the electric store That would be a small unit Its two doors down to your left And if were you d go around the corner and take the stairs up You shouldnt have any trouble finding her If you dont come back Thank you appreciate it Youre welcome So what is it that you need to know Well m trying to fill in the gaps Fit all the pieces together Mrs Hansen If you could remember anything from when you were interviewed anything in particular that might It was Wednesday and she never came They said that she never got on the bus never even made it to the school assumed that shed gone home What was she like What were your Wednesdays with Ginny what were they like Oh she would come in with her little knapsack and plop it on the floor Give me a kiss on my cheek Big kiss always my left cheek And then it was time for work The moment she would sit at the piano we were all business And would give her her lesson just the same as all my other pupils And it was no Grandma this or Grandma that But the moment we were done she was my Ginny again How could God be so greedy Maam And after the lesson Cookies We would have cookies if d baked them Sometimes would send her down to the Land of Christmas the store downstairs for candy or ice cream She would eat her sweets and would read to her She loved Andersen Who Do you know what he wrote in his story The Angel No Here Whenever a good child dies an angel of God comes down from Heaven and takes the child in his arms And spreads out his great white wings And flies with her over all the places that she loved during her life And then the child carries a large handful of flowers up to God Beautiful Whats your name Becky Becky Fiske And you were Ginnys best friend We sat together She died Yeah know Her grandmother told me that Ginny liked to tell stories Sometimes What kind of stories Ginny knew a giant Giant Really He was as big as a mountain and gave her porcupines She called him The Wizard Ginny made a picture of him Ginny drew a picture of a giant Can see it Its on the wall in the hallway We put Ginnys picture gotta go Jean hold my calls You were supposed to be fishing in Mexico know Stan went to the airport heard the boarding announcement just didnt feel right Something went off need more time on this You want me to reopen a case because you got a hunch No offense but youre retired You dont work here anymore Okay know Stan know But could you run it through the system for me anyway You know just a standard query Similar crimes profile victims Could you Say for the last years Could you Stan Please This is eight years ago when this happened m on the job only six months when this very big deal goes down Talk about baptism by fire And to top off everything else it was in the summer season Politics of tourism and all that nonsense So we all feel the pressure to make the bogeyman of it all disappear The brass were pretty clear in the presumption that it was one of those festivalgoers which seemed like you know a pretty good bet And a good way to diffuse the kind of panic that you get when they feel that theres a bogeyman amongst them So we all figured and do feel accurately thats why we never did catch him The odds were on a perpetrator whod cleared the county before the body was ever found Yeah Look at the slit in that neck dont know but for me its like being in a movie This stuff just doesnt bother me like it does some people You Luanne Rotze little yearold girl Real little mean real small for her age You know what though As horrible as that kind of thing is got an adrenaline rush being part of it dont know if thats bad but hey dont hurt me Thats just the way it hit me Nothing like it ever happened before here By the way nothing like it ever happened since think that says a lot You mind if keep this one couldnt let you do that We always like to be of help but strictly technically the case is still open Well then how about the report ll make you a copy Hows that Sure would appreciate it But keep it between us m not sure what the policy is on this kind of thing Okay My lips are sealed Lucy young horse is like a woman Cant predict what theyll do

girl you know just had my little girl Where is my baby The break is Monash County Eight years ago we got a homicide Same Exact same victim profile description as the Ginny Larsen case interviewed a local officer for the particulars Little blonde girl years old sexual assault throat slit The photos show that she was wearing a red dress Detectives out at Morehead covered this case The case is still open At the time of the murders Toby Wadenah was in Stillwater Penitentiary doing time on his own rape conviction He couldnt have done it He shot himself What more You told him what he did Lets calm down see what Jerrys got You got something And theres more More Here See here This is the Larsen murder This is the Monash County girl And here Here you see this pattern Three years ago got a

victim profile that matches every other in the state give or take the red dress Why didnt you mention her blue eyes while youre at it Come on mean whatever made you think that the Larsen girl wasnt murdered by Wadenah This did This convinced me Ginnys drawing of the Porcupine Giant have reason to believe based on my conversations and interviews that Ginny Larsen made this drawing just days before she was murdered have reason to believe she met with this man seen here as a giant all dressed in black on a regular basis This is not an Indian This is not an Indian type And you see this car here This big black car This is not a truck This is not a maroon truck like Wadenah drove This is a big black station wagon And these right here according to an interview had with a girl named Beck Betsy Fiske these are porcupines Okay Whoa Hold it Porcupines and giants and You got to get ahold of yourself Jerry The case is closed made a promise made a promise to find Ginny Larsens murderer

spreads out his great white wings and flies with her over all the places that she loved in her life And what do you feel is represented here Well the porcupine giant Ginny told her friends that shed meet with a giant in the forest and that he gave her little porcupines What do you mean You see these What do you mean by porcupines dont know exactly those are the words of a yearold girl Ginnys friends Friend sorry And this is in the imagination of a You could be right But on the other hand the car is very well depicted and the giant is Giants are imaginary Yes tall heavyset man could appear to be a giant to a little girl And the Indian man was he a tall man Not a giant But tall yes Why did you bring this to me Mr Black Sorry Why did you bring this to me Mr Black need to know who m looking for m like a layman looking at an xray dont know how to read it need help interpreting it This drawing can tell you nothing about the murderer It only tells you about the child who drew it Without more information dont think can be of any value to you Humor me doc Consider this a working hypothesis and assume for the moment that this is a drawing of the murderer Well Your giant certainly looks tall massive very imposing If this depicts the relationship between the giant and the girl then these things you call porcupines appear to be gifts that shes accepting Thats implying a trust Was the girl in Monash killed the same way Exactly the same Do the victims resemble one another Yes a lot What were the time intervals between the murders The Monash County case was eight years ago The little girl missing three And Ginny was just Just last winter So the intervals are getting shorter If thats the case then yes you could Remember this is a hypothetical case But yes you could expect another incident within a matter of months Maybe a year if the opportunity arose But this could just be a product of a yearold childs imagination Right You came to me for help Yes Mind if ask
