to radar perfectly simple Yes know it looks complicated but the beauty is how little there is to it and how much power comes out of it Now theres a fan here in the front which draws in air The airs heated here with paraffin Paraffin Ordinary paraffin Hot air blows out here at the end It comes out at such terrific force that that alone drives the aircraft Who invented it One of your men No a chap

goodbye Sue Goodbye Father Write to me and let me know Would you like a drink darling No thank you Ridgefield Tower this is Glass Jar ve just crossed the coast at Seaford Head descending through cloud Approaching the airfield Roger Climbing through clouds full throttle Sl Will shes a beauty Roger m levelling out Autoobserver on m starting dive now If get any buffeting ll throttle back Here we go This is it Thirty thousand Twentynine Twentyeight Twentyseven Twentysix Twentyfive thousand Mach m getting buffeting now Air brakes open throttling back Coming down to land now Ridgefield Tower to Clear to join circuit and land Runway Call downwind Roger said use not the control tower Your message received and understood Hm Whatho Whatho How was the wonder kite What do you think Can take her out tomorrow No Windy Shes my baby ve nothing on Oh yes you have ve got a job for you promised to deliver a Vampire for De Havilland Where to Cairo Cai Cairo Ooh whizzo Er dont tell the wife Hello Hello darling Yes just a few minutes ago Hey whats for dinner No Piece of cake No really shant be long Goodbye Here Windy lets have that back Here say remembered theres a type know in Cairo and could do with a little sun But You have a nice quiet weekend at Shoreham Well how was it All right Did you take her flat out No nothing like Pity Why pity thought our intrepid air ace might be the first man through the sound barrier There aint no such thing You ought to check up on your supersonics not to mention the popular press Whats so ruddy peculiar about the speed of sound We all know exactly what it is dont we miles per hour at ground level If we go slower than that we can hear ourselves going and if we go faster we can hear ourselves coming Its a mere matter of acoustics Hello Miss Mitchell Good afternoon Mach Slight buffeting commencing on wings Buffeting increasing Mach Buffetings rather bad Shes shaking to pieces Shes disintegrating Dont do that Youll give me heart failure m throttling back and pulling out What an exquisite voice do have to be sure Coming for a drink No got too much work to do Hows the coming along want to find a name for her Something that would suggest the highest speed yet flown How about the line shoot There wont be any line shoot about her Shell do it all right Do what The speed of sound What would happen if you put the wings on back to front Oh go away Go away Well What Seriously Uhhuh Apart from the buffeting and heavy controls and general wanging about and other little things we know about what exactly does happen to an aeroplane at the speed of sound dont know And shall tell you something Tony What No one else in the world does either Darling Hoo How was it Piece of cake Its always a piece of cake Sherry little one What was your day like Pretty good Tony Uhhuh ve got the most wonderful news Have you Two bits of wonderful news in fact Only ones not quite so wonderful as the other so ll start with the less wonderful shall Uhhuh You know that little house at Andrews Corner Broom Cottage Mmhm think we can have it But that belongs to that fellow Franklin Mm but hes leaving Oh But this place isnt so bad is it No of course not But dont you see what a difference it would make if we had a place that belonged to us Oh see all that But the old man will hate us leaving him Hell hate you leaving him Hate you leaving him too Oh darling dont you yet know after two years what Father and really feel about each other Well know you dont exactly see eye to eye Eye to eye Hes always despised me for not being born a son Darling Its true Just as later he despised Chris for not turning out the sort of sort of son he wanted Well cant despise him in return because admire him admire him tremendously for what hes done As for what he is Well all can say its best should live out of his house What was the other wonderful piece of news Itll keep Dinner Were there any other symptoms besides this buffeting Well noticed that the controls got hard at Mach in rather a funny way What height was that Hm Theres no doubt about it were just on the fringe of the problem Father Mm What problem Supersonics The sound barrier Yes Thats a newspaper phrase And like most of them pretty misleading You mean there isnt a barrier Oh theres a barrier all right But its spread out on either side of the speed of sound from roughly between Mach Mark What mark You see its a way we have of measuring the speeds at which we fly We no longer fly at miles per hour we fly at Mach numbers Now Mach One is the speed of sound But why sound What makes a barrier Is it sound Its a combination Its air You see Sue theres a limit to the speed at which air itself can move Now this rules travelling at mile an hour lets say You can hear the air whistle as it moves out of its way But if it were travelling at mile an hour the speed of sound Mach One the air could no longer move out of its way because it just cant move that fast Itd pile up in front of the rule or the aircraft making if you like a barrier Now we dont exactly know what happens to an aircraft when it gets into these conditions Tony knows it buffets as he gets near to them Some say the craft would go right out of control others that itll break up altogether Now dont believe that Sue believe with the right aircraft and the right man we can force our way through this barrier and once through there is a world whole new world with speeds of to mile an hour within the grasp of man And Tony here may be the first man to see that new world Well lets go shall we Do you think the Americans will beat us to it They may but were two years ahead in jetengine development think its between ourselves Vickers and De Havillands at the moment Its a pity De Havillands will have their up before our Oh by the way Will wants a name for her Got any ideas Dad Yes Prometheus Prometheus Who was he He was a Greek god Who stole fire from heaven Oh yes remember Came to a sticky end didnt he He did But the world got fire How long before can have a crack at it Not long but youve got quite a bit of homework to do first Youd better get started right away theory of supersonic shockwaves shant understand a word of this Theres nothing to understand That fellow spends pages telling us he doesnt know a thing But youd better read it all the same shall need you to do some explaining You go up to the observatory ll be with you in a minute Hows the new telescope working Its good but it might be better think one day ll build myself a proper observatory out in the park Father answer me a question will you Yes Is the ability to travel at miles an hour going to be a blessing to the human race Well d say thats up to the human race Well as a member of it cant feel unduly optimistic In fact if thats all that lies beyond this barrier what purpose is there in risking lives to pierce it Well could talk about national security beating the potential enemy bomber flying to New York in two hours but thats not the real point The real point is its just got to be done What purpose did Scott have in going to the South Pole wish knew really wish knew Hm This coffees bitter Yes got it at Weymouths in the high street Franklin tells me youve been looking at his house Yes Father made him an offer That house is not suitable either for my daughter or my chief test pilot Franklin wont accept your offer How do you know For my dear Susan Mr Franklin likes his present job very much And have no doubt no doubt at all hell be anxious to keep it Good night darling Tony Mm Will you try not to use piece of cake talk for a moment ll try not to How dangerous is it going to be Well exploring the unknown must always be a little chancy Yes see Darling did go and see the doctor this morning When End of December Oh how clever of you Well save money on birthday presents Certainly not Even if arrives on Christmas Day he will still get two lots We might give him a false birthday in June Thats right darling Say him Say him whenever you think about it psychologist know says there is something in that Tony What Must it be you This sound barrier Must it be you Yes darling m afraid it must Couldnt someone else No Sue its my pigeon promised myself when you took this job that d never nag you about it Tony and really wouldnt have done if youd just gone on testing aeroplanes but find now m married not only to a test pilot but married to an explorer as well Its a bit unfair Tony really it is Darling hate it ll think about it darling promise you ll think most awfully hard about it Hey Do you remember Philip Peel Of course Like to fly with me tomorrow and have lunch with him Fly Hey will he be all right According to modern theory yes Hed like to very much Good Now its strictly unofficial

just that havent flown anything for months thats all If you want to fly youd better take that job at Ridgefields The offers still open d better go and check in at the flight office Look meet us over there by the Jeep will you What job at Ridgefields Philip Test pilot He mentioned it in his last letter but didnt take him seriously didnt think he was high enough to give out jobs He is you know Does he get on with the great man He calls him Dad Oh Whew its hot Oh Tony why did you bring that awful thing You know how hate it When got your wire thought you must be tight probably was say how are you going to get back Get back Oh hadnt thought of that Why dont you try going by sea Its a nice restful trip Only days Fifteen Tony do you mean to say Dont worry darling well think of something Why not ask Cunningham He tests the Comet between here and London most days No rival firm No well catch a lift somewhere Hey where are you taking us for lunch An openair place Jessies meeting us there Oh good Its the best food in Cairo Hooray To think you were in England only this morning It seems like a miracle cant quite believe it myself m so glad Jess to meet you at last can never realise you dont know

go back by boat shall be wearing these trousers for a fortnight How much would they pay you as a test pilot What Oh about a year less than m getting at the moment Oh well expect well manage somehow Theyre off Home In five hours Thanks John shes a nice steady old crate Who was it said Oh to be in England Browning But he wasnt Oh Tony it was a wonderful trip knew youd love it Love it shall treasure it all my life Every single moment Darling stop a minute will you Paper Thank you remember you telling me once that one of the reasons you love flying so much was that you found a sort of peace up there that you couldnt find anywhere on Earth When we seemed to be hanging up there between heaven and Earth found a strange secure sort of peace too Almost like the feeling one gets in one of those especially comfy dreams never thought it would be like that Darling will you stop at the office block want to see Dad about something Of course ve just spoken to them And do they know what happened No more than you read there And what speed The fastest yet achieved anywhere on Earth Disintegrated Wreckage lies scattered over a milewide area It looks as if it really had exploded in the air But they must know more than this They dont Theres nothing left to tell They may have hit something Aye he hit something all right He hit the speed of sound Well it looks as if might have been wrong after all Cos you cant get through this thing That was a great aircraft flown by a great pilot Yes know Well Do we go on Well thats for you to decide isnt it Yes suppose it is wanted to know how you feel about it Could we get a full report on all this and could look at it It might help us Oh and if youre sending a wire you might put my name on it too He was a good bloke old Geoffrey d better say it at once m going on with this soundbarrier business Why Tony Its difficult to explain just feel its got to be done thats all By you Yes by me Was he married Yes believe he was Is there anything can say that will stop you Tony No Sue Nothing Dont you see cant let the show down now Let the show down Is there no thought in your mind of letting me down or him Oh Sue If only could understand Tony But cant you see can only see a great wall in the sky strong enough to smash an aircraft to pieces And beyond it nothing Nothing at all m sorry Sue Darling promised to speak to Dad and ask him whether mightnt give up this job but after Well after this how could Dont you see what hed have felt about me if had ve heard those words before Tony Christopher said them to me the night before he was killed He was scared too Father might think he was a coward Oh it isnt that just dont want him to think m ratting on a job because someone else got killed doing it Where are you going cant face him tonight Oh darling Leave me alone Oh Sue is not feeling very well Shes not coming down Oh Sorry You know when first started flying some people religious people thought what we were doing was wrong They thought it was breaking a law of nature Sounds funny now of course but they used to say If God had meant us to fly hed have given us wings Now this sound barrier people might feel again that God had put it there for his own good purpose That it cant be broken That it would be wrong to try Now wouldnt blame anyone who believed that wouldnt blame them at all Do you believe that Tony No Dad If believe anything its the exact opposite Oh if only were years younger Well sorry about Sue Well get Factor to send her up a tray Lets go in shall we Mummy somebody at the door Yes dear know Oh Sally

does everyone m fond of have to be a test pilot Why cant they sit in offices like the rest of humanity The rest of humanity doesnt know what its missing When Tonys flying these days try to go to the cinema You cant hear the sound so clearly in there Philip How does Jess feel about all this Oh think she accepts it just as a job like any other wish were like Jess m not very brave m afraid Whens he testing the Prometheus at full speed dont know You do think But perhaps its best you shouldnt tell Whats he doing at this minute Hes up for half an hour on a routine test Will you stay for lunch Oh wont that be difficult for Jess Has she enough Shell manage somehow Susan you mustnt worry you know Theres no better pilot in this country Philip believe to have courage one must also have

see you looking better How was Bognor Oh very restful very quiet m glad youre back m not back Oh Well when youre at Bognor you might have a look at this d like your views Byfields work Yes Whats his idea in that To increase stability The way see it a good aircraft has Its got to have something sort of inevitable about it Now look This thing could be changed a hundred different ways For example Do you know what you are Youre a vile seducer Oh by the way hear youve made a new Prometheus Whats the idea Its too good an aircraft to lose Will Its the best that came out of England since the war No It failed It wasnt the aircraft that failed Will Now you come and see me on Monday Well this may not be the time to tell you but ve been watching your work very closely and now Makepeace is leaving us ve decided to promote you to chief test pilot Oh thank you Sir John In the firm m still known as Take up the new Prometheus tomorrow Yes Take her up every day for the next few weeks No specific tests just get used to her Right Goodbye and thank you charming party Oh and Peel Not above Mach until further orders Philip think so Hello darling Come on Up we get Has John been good Yes He doesnt seem to

both miss you terribly shall miss you Couldnt you find something a little nearer here dont want him to grow up in the shadow of his grandfather Come on darling Why not stick the nose on the tail ll stick your nose on your tail Will What Is it possible that at the speed of sound the controls are reversed At the speed of sound Philip anythings possible Why During the war once put a Spitfire into a flatout dive No particular reason just youthful high spirits think now that hit the sound barrier remember that the more pulled on the stick the harder the nose went down The same thing happened today Youre not meant to do a high Mach number know but did Both times felt that if d had the guts to put the stick forward instead of pulling it back could have pulled out without having to lose speed What do you think Theres nothing in the books to suggest for one second anything so Edgar Allan Poeish Rather depends on the books doesnt it Will There were books once that said the Earth was flat Yes Oh Hes here Its for you Hello Peel here Yes What now Well yes of course What have done He sounded grim as blazes Heres Daddy m sorry m late darling We had to start darling had to see the old man Youve got it then ve got what Well the rise of course Oh blast it forgot to ask him You forgot to ask him Yes m sorry darling Oh really What a husband All right Bobby go out and play on the lawn Thats it you come with me Nice flight dear Yes thanks Wonderful ve got something hot for you in the oven What does he want You wont tell Jess will you No To take the Prometheus up and reproduce the conditions under which Tony crashed Could have the bread please Thanks At the same speed Well faster if possible When shall take her up this afternoon for a high Mach number and if thats all right full crack tomorrow Are you going to do it Look dont have to you know This was merely a suggestion not an order Hm Thats the situation Sue dont have to but must Why must you Well Its a bit hard to explain only

on the sheet Theres one quite important detail that isnt At what Mach number is my machine to fly Mach One Wasnt Tony enough for you We learnt a lot from Tonys crash Just enough to know that to fly at the speed of sound is death Havent you had enough of that No Ever heard of pilotless aircraft This problem cant be solved with pilotless aircraft Not in years anyway Well what are a few years one way

let Philip go the way of Tony Well we dont know the way of Tony Thats Philips job tomorrow to find out how Tony was killed And Tony was finding out how Geoffrey de Havilland was killed and another pilot will find out how Philip was killed And each time well learn a bit more So that one day Ridgefields will build an airliner thatll go to New York in three hours Two So a few people who can afford it will spend an occasional weekend in New York and Ridgefields shares will go up and up My dear Susan what kind of man do you think am dont know really dont know What sort of a man with two deaths on his conscience could risk burdening it with a third man whose passionate worship is for a pile of bricks and mortar called Ridgefields My dear Susan if you were to tell me that only by giving up Ridgefields could find out what happens to an aircraft at the speed of sound d say All right Susan my girl its a deal dont believe that Thats because you cant understand it You make imaginary sacrifices for yourself but its other peoples lives you really sacrifice You think felt nothing at Tonys death What else can think when a few hours after his death find you listening to his voice Our ways are different in so many things expect our ways of grieving are different too Well dont suppose youve any more to say to me Yes have Father m taking John to live in London Oh Indeed You know why
