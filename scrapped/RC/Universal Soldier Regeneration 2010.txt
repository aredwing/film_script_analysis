Prime Minister Musayev if you dont recognize me look hard at my face and youll understand General Vasilly Topov was not only my father he was my comrade my leader in battle And now his fight for the liberation of Pasalan is my own His army is under my command and will stop at nothing to make his dreams become reality Prime Minister Musayev we have occupied the Chernobyl nuclear power plant The abandoned city surrounding the complex is under our control No longer can we be ignored Now we are the occupiers Any attempt to penetrate its borders will be met with fierce resistance The reactor has been rigged with explosives Detonators have been set to hours Should our demands go unanswered they will go off Such an explosion would produce a radiation cloud than the bombs dropped on Japan We call for the imminent release of all We call for the complete and total independence of Pasalan Nothing less will be deemed acceptable Prime Minister Musayev this fight is not only about country and politics it is about blood Mine and now yours We have your children Should you ignore my demands they will be the first to go urge you to act responsibly We ask only to be free as you would want your children to be free Come on come on come on Thats it Hey take it easy This way Okay come on come on Over there right over there All right now take it easy Take it easy Hey easy For Christs sake theres spare parts in there Morons Sit How do you feel feel good Any problems No Do you know where you are Yes Do you know why youre here Yes Is it necessary for you to question the things you dont know No Excuse me Doctor Thank you Okay can you please move your right fingers one by one beginning with the forefinger Limited range All right Okay Do you feel warm Yes m gonna cool you off Very good You were very good today So youve seen the security tape from the museum have You want to describe what you saw or shall saw an armed assailant take direct hits to vital areas and still manage to overpower a security detail This remind you of something White Tower was shut down over a year ago Maybe it was something else Maybe But we should still prepare for the worst however remote the possibility So if we assume the worst the problem becomes ours to share Hypothetically So then hypothetically what is our shared solution Lets load them up On April th Chernobyl Reactor Number exploded Worst nuclear power plant accident in history The ensuing fire released a plume of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere The city of Chernobyl was evacuated and has remained abandoned for over years We believe the rebels have set up their bunker in one of the buildings adjacent to the reactor complex about two miles due east from our current position in Chernobyl city While the site itself no longer has enough fuel to make a bomb it has times the radiation An explosion in Reactor Number would release that radiation And now for the bad news It appears the generals son has gotten his hands on some of our weaponry Here to explain Dr Richard Porter In the s with war in Asia looming the began research into Operation Black Tower what weve now come to call the Universal Soldier program highresponse selfsustaining quickhealing stronger faster soldier fueled by highconcentrate nutritional supplements soldier that operates without conscience or hesitation By freezing a human body with nitrogenbased gas repairing it and reheating it through thyroid and pituitary augmentation we were able to revive a recentlydeceased soldier and in the process improve them Programmable and erasable One that you can turn on and turn off Deceased as in dead Thats right Five years ago the program was suspended or rather replaced by a program known as White Tower Led by Dr Robert Colin under my supervision White Tower sought to improve and perfect what Black Tower had introduced Using gene therapy techniques developed during Dr Colins cloning research we were able to give our UniSols a tuneup from the inside out The new model was superior in every physical capacity a virtual killing machine The next generation UniSols or Us as we like to call them There was however an incident in a government building Twelve dead Nobody injured It was considered to be a malfunction though believe their temperature had not been properly moderated We were instructed to shut down all the existing Us which we did But there was a breakin Some things were taken including a Series model We have reason to believe it was my former colleague Dr Colin We suspect hes been continuing his studies Colins been operating out of Eastern Europe as a gunforhire Gentlemen well be fighting against the perfect soldier One who is impervious to injury and pain quicker than hell and with a nervous system unaffected by radiation We have four firstgeneration UniSols that are more than capable in this type of endgame Dismissed You say four Colonel Thats correct thought there was five There were Now theres four What happened to the fifth Hes the subject of a privatelyfunded program run by Dr Sandra Fleming Project Phoenix Doing what Behavioral modification therapy or psychological rehabilitation as Dr Fleming calls it Shes trying to reintroduce him into society He was one of the very first but by far the best of the group Dr Fleming has been conducting her research in Switzerland think of escape Peaceful feeling Shame Why do you say that dont know Yes you do Just say the first thing that comes into your mind dont remember Maybe for things have done What have you done Luc dont know think hes hungry Why dont you feed him How do you feel Helpless Maybe youre feeling the weight of responsibility Its what it feels like to grow older Luc Do you realize how

communication and transportation vehicles that you encounter and remember the objective If it comes down to eitheror we go big picture and we take the reactor Are there any questions What if we encounter the freak Avoidance if you can Keep it occupied Is that the best you can do Doctor Its probably programmed to defend the reactor site so itll stick close to it like a nest making it

Something you seem to know nothing about Fucking knock your teeth out Hey hey hey Get back What the hell was that This imprudent act of aggression has resulted in a swift response We have detonated one of the explosives around the reactor Consider it a warning shot The world doesnt appear to apply pressure to the Bosorow bullies Theyre allowing them to stall You are not doing anything Think about your children empathize with your father know how he feels You only hope for your family to be safe And when they are not you carry it with you like a cancer Unlike me he can change this would

guy in the background mean okay lets be honest with ourselves here You call that an army Come on its a bunch of peasants with slingshots But just one of my men just one Thats all it took Now want you

compound Copy that sir Thats the cooling tower If we can get in those pipes we can access the reactor there Its probably been capped off after the accident but it can be reopened sir Hes here Hello Luc expect youre feeling somewhat fatigued Thats normal The sedation should wear off soon enough Sandra Dr Fleming is here and has authorized this examination so there should be no cause for alarm Were your friends Youre home Luc have a few questions for you Please answer yes or no want to talk to Sandra Just answer the questions Do you see yourself as a person who is a reliable worker Yes Do

for that Methylphenidate and mentenolone Please listen to me His nervous system will break down You cant reverse years of hormonal therapy in a day Its like rehabilitating a fight dog then putting it back to fight This could backfire in a myriad of ways Rehabilitation was never part of his design And as you can see hes at odds with his nature He was created to serve a need and hes not doing that But now youre just compounding the situation Dr Fleming you have to ask yourself whether a dog once it has tasted blood can ever forget that taste There is substantial power inside of him that have spent two years regulating If you unleash it this quickly you may not be able to control it Just get him up to speed Doc You let me worry about controlling it Listen You said something about some

nation in crisis my decisions have been dictated by a single principle to serve the common good of the people no matter what might be sacrificed in the process While pride demands aggression be met with aggression humanity depends on diplomatic and peaceful conflict resolution It is therefore the responsibility of those in positions of power to question any hard line policy that threatens survival as we know it Therefore have authorized the release of prisoners in exchange for immediate deactivation of the detonator at Chernobyl reactor three Over the next hours all troops will stand down in ceasefire mode as the terms of exchange are implemented The remaining prisoners will then be released in exchange for the hostages Its over Luc We might have had our share of differences but it is the result that is important yes Yes For a world leader to give in to the demands of a small outfit such as our own one should savor the rarity of the experience The thing is to stop at this moment would be a shameful waste of both leverage and position Yeah youre young youll learn but now we have to move It is over and that is that Thats not really for you to say because there have been expenses Unanticipated expenses Its hard to budget these things in advance Now have an army to build And like you said moments like these dont often present themselves dont think youre hearing me You
