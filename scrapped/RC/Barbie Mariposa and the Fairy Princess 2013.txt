Once upon a time in the land of Flutterfield there lived a Butterfly Fairy named Mariposa She was the smartest fairy in the land She read every book she could find And the dashing Prince Carlos also shared her love of reading Then one day Mariposa discovered that the magical lights in Flutterfield were growing dimmer These lights protected Flutterfield from the Skeezites monsters who eat Butterfly Fairies The lights were going out because Henna an evil Butterfly Fairy had poisoned Queen Marabella and it was the Queens magic that made the lights shine So Mariposa and her friends flew to the Bewilderness on a quest for an antidote But along the way they faced peril and danger of all kinds When they finally arrived at the Cave of Reflections Mariposa proved her courage and earned the antidote When she did her wings grew larger and even more beautiful Mariposa and her friends returned to Flutterfield to discover the Skeezites attacking the Royal Palace Mariposa gave the antidote to the Queen who was instantly healed The magical lights returned forcing Henna and the Skeezites to flee Queen Marabella hailed Mariposa and her friends as heroes which they are to this day

Misinformation ve been around long enough to know who our enemies are Mariposa Crystal Fairies are scary and cruel Everyone knows that Only because thats what weve been led to believe Its whats in our fairy tales But the real history is different Look Centuries ago Butterfly and Crystal Fairies were allies Then the Crystal Fairy King accused the Butterfly Fairies of trying to steal their Crystallites The Butterfly Fairies denied it the Crystal Fairies didnt believe them and everyone got angrier and angrier until the two sides declared themselves eternal enemies and vowed never to have contact again Okay but what about the part where the Crystal Fairies grind the Butterfly Fairies wings to make their bread Wheres the picture of that You wont find it It never happened Preposterous
