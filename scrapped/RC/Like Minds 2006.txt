what is at stake here Dont lose sight of your obligations Alex Thatll be all said that will be all What happened Did you say anything Well Did you No Your father can be such an asshole sometimes Throughout history men have sacrificed themselves for their fundamental beliefs It may not be wise to pit the force of God against many human desires but Are you all right Mr Simms Um m fine sir just fell off my chair sir Well Be more careful next time Yes sir Some of you are working on Beckett Who can tell me about its subject Thomas of Beckett Yes Mr Weyland Thomas Beckett was the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury in the early th century sir In he was murdered in front of at the high altar at his cathedral Exactly He knew that the knights were coming to slay him but he chose to wait for them unto the sight of God His murder was a sacrilegious act of gross profanity However almost immediately after his death there were whispers of miracles being performed at his grave Believers from all over the country traveled day and night on foot in ord Yes Mr Forbes His murder was simply political Beckett got in the way so the Church had him put down Trust Mr Forbes to come up with such an interesting slant on history Well you cant change history Now if you look at it youll see its exactly like all the other atrocities committed against the people by the Church Oh and exactly what atrocities are you referring to The Cathars The Cathars They were a bunch of heathens who created their own rules to suit themselves The Church was simply trying to retain order in a very volatile land All right what about the Knight Templars then fail to see how this has got anything to do with what were talking about Werent they the knights that killed Thomas Beckett This is ludicrous Sir is it Sir werent the Templars known as the Knights of Christ Werent they the Churchs foot soldiers What So why kill the Archbishop At least they had the foresight to see the pointlessness of the Holy Crusades Now why dont you tell the class how the Knights of Christ turned their back on the Vatican and adopted the Cathars beliefs This better stop now Free from the Church the Templars took control They had more fingers in the pie than the Vatican which is a lot of fingers Sit down Isnt that why they were hunted down and burned at the stake They had betrayed their original cause And whose cause was that Get out of my class Go on Get out Frightful little man What are you trying to prove now hmm Trying to upset the Reverend Donaldson thought that might get you up here Alex hes a man of the cloth You must learn to show him some respect Dont walk away from me when m talking to you Good God Hes been busy And you make me share a room with him But he was dox at St Edwards Academy last year

highest academic records in the country Boys of Alexs ability need regimented discipline We dont allow any distraction which might lead these boys away from their true potential And look where he is

front of him Hasnt he been through enough am trying to help your son Dr Forbes love my son and m gonna make very sure that the humiliation you people have subjected him to is made public In almost

read the meaning of her movements in her frightened uplifted eyes It was too much for him We kept our distance Surrendering himself to her body But felt that my thoughts were no longer my own the dark pressure of her soft hot lips They pressed upon his The further sank the stronger he became It was like he had taken my soul started work on the set building for the school play That mostly kept my

implicated in the deaths of Josh Campbell Susan Mueller and Nigel Colbie have a job to do Your father would have expected you to help us My father would have expected me to uphold the law Dont presume to know me just because we belong to the same club Good night Dr Forbes The cars locked in the garage and weve searched the house Have they used their credit cards or bank accounts No sir All right Keep me informed Still no sign of Nigels parents huh Was Nigel Colbie a suspect in the Susan Mueller killing Were investigating the death of Nigel Colbie Dont you think its worth looking at in the the light of whats happening ve already been down that road No fingerprints No murder weapon No probable cause End of story Theres no proof of what youre telling me And the evidence indicates you shot the head off the boy youre incriminating so just what do you want anyone to believe That if it wasnt for me messing with Nigels head then both Susan and Josh would still be alive Dont think youll get some kind of redemption by taking the blame What makes you think want any kind of redemption told you didnt do it Alex want to believe you But come on look at the facts The facts want to help you But youve got to help me Give me something to go on Something concrete before its too fucking late Find Nigels red book The book Nigel gave you Yeah his Bible And what would expect to find in this Bible Most

embalmed Quite an elaborate job really Whoever did this went to a lot of trouble Blood drained all the main organs removed including the brain Like taxidermy Thats another way to look at it but guess its a similar procedure Well how did they die Both shotgun deaths Excuse me dont want you here You shouldve been looking Or didnt you want them found We were searching via normal channels Or should go around digging up vegetable patches every time someone goes missing Well that depends on the circumstances doesnt it And what the fuck were you doing down here Your dirty work Whats this What Its nothing Then suppose this is nothing as well Is there something you want to tell me Yes m a member My father was a member It was passed on to me Its a business network And the last thing they need is to be connected to something like this So youre saying they are connected Dont put fucking words in my mouth Theres no conspiracy here The order is about as insidious as the Lions Club Alex Forbes is fucking with your mind And youre letting him and youre the psychologist All right all right m sorry m just looking at all the angles Look Sal m running out of time here really need to know if the charges ve laid are gonna stick In your opinion did Alex Forbes murder Nigel Colbie So did you find the Bible You know who this is Hi m sorry Actually youve gotta go around to the front of the church

dedicate tonights performance to the memory of Susan Thank you So then our good Archbishop and they brought before the courts of the Church Stop it Nigel And the more read the deeper sank into the pages It was all there the slaughter of the Cathars the Templars assassination of Thomas Beckett and the Holy Inquisition resulting in the Templars excommunication as heretics It all made startling sense like d just seen the other side of Eschers staircase d woken up Nigel believed that he was a direct descendant from the Templar bloodline He was some fuckedup individual He thought that the medieval insignia of the brotherhood foretold the power that our union would bring the pike being the weapon harnessed by the interlinking loops The two of us When was a child my father used to stand me in front of that painting He told me stories of courage and bravery how my ancestors had fought to protect their free right It was only then that realized what Nigel believed was of the same Templar bloodline Alex want the truth Did you do this Is that what you want to hear Alex weve got people that can help you You must let them The only thing that you care about is the brotherhood isnt it Nigel said it and he was right Theres nothing more than puerile male bonding No your friends must be shitting themselves Now what are they gonna do about their golf club memberships Listen Listen

was the instrument of Nigels obsession Jack knew you couldnt resist a secret rendezvous What do you want This way Maraclea was the lost love of a thcentury Templar As the story goes Maraclea was betrothed to a Knight Templar but died before they could wed And the knight was so tormented by his loss that he opened her grave and made love to her body Come on Exactly nine months later he was summoned to her grave On opening her coffin he found that her remains had been moved Her head had been placed below her pelvis sitting on top of her thigh bones which had been crossed Where the hell are we voice told him to guard the skull as it would be the bringer of all power Oh Shes yours Jack She was lying there And he said since was her only love it was up to me to to do the deed And when refused he went on about letting down the bloodline and that with the skull we would be complete You didnt know Nigel You didnt know him Do you honestly think that you can help me Did you pull the trigger Now on Radio Six its time for the evening prayer with the right honorable you ask me Good evening An angel said unto Zechariah Your wife will bear you a son and you are to give him What is

has to offer Youre deluded Why Why am deluded This is our fate Now just shut the fuck up Pray for me What are you doing Pray for yourself Were one now Aah What follows through a system of either intimidation manipulation or coercion is the dominant individual begins to focus and influence the thoughts of the subordinate partner This process nurtures a subjective gestalt where similar thoughts fantasies and other interlocking elements conspire to form a greater and more volatile hold therefore a merging of like minds Thank you Hello The heads missing Nigel got what he wanted And what was that Eternity You dont get it do you You will You will The necessary means to an end Evil little fucker You like history
