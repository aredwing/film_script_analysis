leg some years ago lf l tell Dr Shinde everything he will instantly call home And tell mom everything And there will be a huge confusion Shiva Do you have normal clothes other than this uniform Dr Shinde Manohar Oome in How is Priya Shes absolutely fine And Shushma Mom is fine as well Are you feeling sick lts nothing like that l needed a small favour Thats why l troubled you Please come Oome Sorry l came without an appointment lts alright This is my friend Shiva Hello Doctor Hi Hes a writer And hes writing something about ghosts and paranormal activities He was stuck on something and l thought about you So what do you want to ask Actually Doctor when l was writing my story l read a story on the lnternet l am sorry What will you have Tea coffee Tea Tea will be fine Okay l get it now Theres a family in Delhi They watch a programme which is a replica of themselves l completely get it now Tell me one thing Shiva Do you believe in the paranormal l mean is there a possibility that lost souls ghosts could exist Well One cant clearly say that they dont exist But l personally dont Fair enough Tell me one thing which is the most complicated machine in the world There are so many of them Doctor The rocket the satellite the computer No its the human body Theres nothing more complicated than the human body And a doctor will know that the best l mean if we say that a lost soul has entered something complicated like the human body everyone will agree to it But it has entered a machine like the television No one is ready to believe that Forget that Let us try to find out why the souls would try to do that Shiva the lost souls need a medium to contact the real world The wandering souls need a medium to contact the real world So why not the television Get one thing straight Shiva Humans are not the only ones who change Souls do too Doctor let us assume that the ghosts and souls can contact us through television But the question is why are they trying to contact us They have a motive Theres a goal they want to achieve Something thats left unfinished And they want to return to this world to finish it lf anyone can achieve their goal their souls will find solace And the programme wont be telecast anymore You can say the house where its telecasted must be related to that place Shiva listen to me All the people l saw on that show are all dead Thats clear And like Dr Shinde is saying they want to say something through the show And maybe thats why we have found that album Shiva l feel theres something in the album that were missing We should check the album again Wheres the album ln the car Just a minute What Just a minute Turn it back What is it Hold on l think we missed a photograph Look Theres something below Just a minute Oarefully Shiva do you see this man What Until now l have seen everyone on the show ex cept for this one Mannu Yes The calendar in the photograph shows the year This means they were alive until June That means they must have died after that So we have to check the papers after that month Remember that Shiva Shiva Oheck this out The younger sister in the television show Yes She was a news reporter She and her eight family members were massacred with a hammer The children were not spared either And their address Ohabra Village Kailash Nagar Whats wrong Mannu Shiva What The address of their house and my address are the
