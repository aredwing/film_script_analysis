the most charming houses ve ever seen It has dignity Doesnt look as though it had been shut up at all does it No No it doesnt It looks well as though it were waiting for someone had a feeling coming in that time was standing still Yeah but time doesnt stand still anywhere does it Yes it does Havent you ever had a feeling of complete peace and contentment Thats what felt when came in here Theres nothing to fear think about This was well peaceful And time stood still You probably think thats foolish suppose it is dont think so agree with you about the house It is peaceful Its more Its a home Its someones home Was this his What kind of songs did he play Oh suppose he played almost anything That was silly of me What kind of songs do you play on a guitar Are we on a hill had the feeling driving out that was climbing for miles You came out of a valley This is a hill Thats the peak right there How could that be a peak Its flat Yes it is isnt it The view must be heavenly Thats where wouldve built my house Mike fixed himself a place there He called it his oakpaneled office Really d love to see it ll show you the way Youre very kind said came out here today because wanted a drive in the country Thats not strictly true What really wanna do is to try to find out more about Michael Garroway Everyone seems to be so vague about him except my husband of course But saw a look in a girls eye the other day when she was talking about him and an insane look of fear in the eyes of a horse he owned know the kind of music and poetry he liked Its curious wish you knew more about him d like to find out dont know why m bothering you with this think its very interesting Mrs Garroway Well here we are Golly Golly Its beautiful isnt it It really is an oakpaneled office Its amazing He had so much Why do people do the things they do to themselves Why doesnt someone step in and stop them help them Yes but what about those people who refuse to be helped Its useless to even try Oh no Its

read you poetry and told you whimsical stories about his neighbors And his guitar He played cowboy songs It made him popular and got him a lot of free help Knew other songs too Sentimental romantic ones Hed have been glad to play them for another mans girl m sorry know youre sorry That doesnt help Why couldnt you figure that d had enough and do as ask If theres anything else you wanna know ask me now Dont ask Warmsley or the natives or the bellboys ask me ll tell you anything if youll only stop was wrong to come here if you didnt want me to But for you to come and shout at me and treat me

day they were married Oh you know her Yes he had a huge party She couldnt have looked dowdier Of course the poor girl had on her Sunday best but really Hes very attractive Yes but he doesnt wear well Good evening Miss Wilcox Good evening Alfred Five please Well Ann Going to be thrown by a bunch of cheap gossip Alan m thrown by the truth Meaning what was rather dowdy that first night in Washington You expected me to be didnt you what Youre so very observing of womens clothes You knew wouldnt look smart Oh Ann You couldve waited to have me meet your friends until looked right thought you were trying to spare my feelings But the truth is if no one saw the before you wouldnt get the credit for the after would you Thats ridiculous Ann Why should do that So that you could exhibit me as your very own invention Like the Garroway Flight Control What do you mean by that You know Alan think have a glimmering now of why you married me wanna know what you meant about the flight control Nothing What the woman said All right what else do you think Why did marry you You wanted another girl but she fell in love with someone else happen to remind you of her Only was so terribly admiring of you You had the illusion of having her there yet Iooking at you as she never had And then you thought if you could make me outshine her Youre mad Ann Yes Alan think sometimes am feel as though were living in a dream haunted by your obsession your hatred for your brother all around all around us Ann things between us look pretty black right now Its hard to talk But wanna tell you that That love you The way acted tonight was unforgivable ll never speak that way to you again ll go on to Seattle alone and youll have a couple of days to think And when you do try to keep a little oldfashioned trust and blind faith in our marriage want our marriage too Ann Its very important to me Its going to last and grow Please try Ann Hello Miss Burton Come in Its awfully nice of you to be Lets save the formalities You wanted to ask me something All right dont want to ask you anything you dont want to answer Mrs Garroway If agreed to see you its because m curious about a few things myself m sorry It isnt easy bet Want a drink No thank you Youre a funny girl to be mixed up with Alan Garroway Really dont like him you know In fact despise him Does that answer one of your questions Not quite love him All right You love him What do you want me to tell you about him Its Michael that dont know anything about and for certain reasons think should can imagine All know is that he and Alan had a frightful fight He left Disappeared But its not easy to forget him In fact he seems to be coming up more and more in our lives wherever we go Whatever we do ve got to know more about him understand him My marriage my happiness my future seem to depend on it Thats about it That quarrel What was that about Money wasnt it believe it was Bunk Everyone who knew Mike knew that was bunk Mike never thought about money He never even cared about it thought hed really be happy if he retired to his ranch and grew tomatoes Have you ever seen it the ranch No have you Yes Then why did you ask dont know Wondering how close we were We werent tried but Mike wouldnt have it used to think that he had some sort of funny sense of loyalty because d met him through Alan He was that thing that you have to look for with a microscope gentleman Thats the man that your husband spread those lies about stealing money Miss Burton youll have to remember believe my husband You dont believe Alan or you wouldnt be here You wouldnt have called me You think hes lying and know he is Why Because went through this myself several years ago When Mike disappeared nearly went crazy trying to find what happened Did you find out Only that it was a complete mystery and only one man had the answer When tried to find Mike discovered hed gone to the ranch and stayed until he disappeared That was the last that anyone saw of him except your husband who was seen out there one night by a rancher Alan told me if that was the same night there was a party Party Mike never gave parties No they were alone just the two of them What do you mean Miss Burton discovered your husband was probably the last person who ever saw him alive Because think hes dead Knowing the man Mike was cant believe hed cut himself off from everyone and everything unless something happened You mean he was killed in the war No dont mean that he was killed in the war Before you went to war you went to camp didnt you Where was Mike all that time What kept him from writing Not to me couldnt expect that but his friends or his neighbors or a thousand people he knew in San Francisco Ask your husband will you Lots of us would like to know what happened at that meeting What kind of a fight was it And what happened to Mike Garroway How dare you speak to me this way Miss Burton Forgive me for coming here m sorry It isnt It isnt such a shocking idea when youve lived with it for a while Hello Ann Ann miss you darling miss you very much havent been able to think or concentrate on anything but you m so glad you said that Alan m m so confused m so Dont darling Dont No more of that ever have to leave for Baltimore in the morning can t very well get out of it All right Alan But think itll work out well for us if you like it You

are the keys to the suitcases George Yes maam Theres somebody down by the stables Who could it be Nobody Miss Garroway Bate was very excited Aint nobody there How do you know Maybe its old Ben Would Bate act as though hed gone crazy just for old Ben Oh let it pass Please Miss Garroway let it pass Where is he Bate Did you see him Did you see Michael Hes alive Hes alive isnt he Bate thought that Sylvia Burton was right that Alan had killed him But was wrong Michaels alive Hes here and everything that Alan said about him is true Hes here and hes hiding He doesnt dare show his face Oh Alan how could have thought Hello Alan Take it easy Al dont wanna see you any more than you wanna see me Why did you come back Wouldnt you rather know why went away Of course heard the reason you gave Alan That was a lie Youve been a long time denying it Be kind of tough to prove You had the books pretty well rigged But thats not what sent me away and kept me away It was Carl Steuer Alan Carl Steuer and what happened to him Steuers dead Thats right Dead and buried Hes almost forgotten now Not that anyone paid much attention to him He was just an old German refugee who worked for us Nice old guy Didnt hate anybody except the Nazis Lived for one thing To get back at them He was senile kept him on at the plant out of pity He wasnt senile The best engineer we had You remember that invention he was working on in the cellar of his house in San Francisco Never talked about it too much Just a little bit to me and a lot to you He liked you Al Every man at the plant was working on an invention of some kind or other Thats right But only Steuer died The coroner said it was an accident Fell down the cellar steps Whats that got to do with me Afraid its got a lot to do with you Steuer had a pet name for that invention of his His Fern he used to call it as though it were alive like a child or something My Fernll fix the Nazis hed say Your brother and me know Some day my Fernll pay them back Fern Fern Had me winging for a while And then it made sense Steuer was German Fern is a German word Means distant Fernsteuerung longdistance control Thats Fern Thats why Steuer died He was murdered by somebody who wanted those plans Somebody who got them because they were never found Then later the Garroway Distance Controller came out The Garroway Distance Controller was mine It was Carl Steuers But it made millions for you It gave you money power all the things that you thought would bury forever that feeling of insecurity thats driven you all your life Well has it released you Alan Has it made you what you wanna be Has it been worth killing for You cant prove any of this Maybe not in a court but thered be enough to ruin you Is Warmsley the only other one whos guessed Because youre paying him off arent you Al Anyhow when finally found out walked out of the whole mess Then the war came along You know spent most of my time in the Army hoping d get mine so d never have to face this moment But it seems it has to be faced after all You see Alan met your wife You met Ann At the ranch Sheer accident She didnt know who was She didnt guess didnt tell her Shes a fine person Alan Shes much too fine for what see ahead of her with you Does she know about it Al She doesnt does she m here to make sure that she finds out You think killed Steuer What makes you think wouldnt kill you
