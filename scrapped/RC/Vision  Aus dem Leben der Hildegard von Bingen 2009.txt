borrow some books for you You can choose Books on medicine precious stones or antique classics The Bishop treasures the Dioscorides and the Physiologus mixture of fables and observations in the realm of nature It originates from Alexandria second century It contains excerpts from the works of Aristotle Plutarch and Pliny Is that a unicorn Yes No hunter can kill it or catch it but it will jump into the lap of a virgin maid So it says You flagellated yourself wanted to suffer as he suffered for us He who kills the flesh kills the soul that inhabits it God wants you to give mercy not sacrifices Which herbs will help heal the wounds Mullein No its for coughs Tetterwort Tetterwort is for warts Horehound No its for diarrhea and snakebite Prayer and fasting alone will not cure our sick patients Yarrow If someone is wounded by beating first wash the wound with wine then lay a cloth on the wound and lay yarrow upon the cloth It must be boiled and then strained It draws out the pus from the wound Music can also heal your wounds and your soul Sister Sieglinde Man was created from earth and the earth will help you Repeat that times a day for days Let me go You are the devil Chrysoprase Hold it against your throat until it gets warm Afterwards youll feel no more fury want each of you to show me a herb you know Tetterwort And Its for treating warts Sister Berta Tansy For rheumatism and gout Wormseed To treat fleas Good The milk thistle Well Sister Clara Yarrow for healing wounds Good But plants and stones can only release their healing powers when man is at one with nature and with God First our souls must be healed And then the body can follow Hurry God to redeem me Lord please help me Brother Volmar asked you here because must make a confession ve not told another soul yet Since early childhood ve had visions When was just three years old saw such a great light that my soul trembled saw things that other people didnt see was different from the others And felt ashamed of that dont think thats a sin The sin committed is not that did something wrong but that refused to do something that was appointed to do few months ago there was a blazing light flashing with lightning coming down from the sky It flowed through my brain and my breast and my heart It was like a flame that didnt burn but warmed like the sun And heard a voice saying am the living light that illuminates all You mortal are appointed to reveal that which is hidden Write down what you hear and see You didnt hear the voice in a dream was fully conscious What were you afraid of for so long Of peoples skepticism Were you not more afraid that your visions werent sent by God but by the Devil Oh no In such a sublime light in such splendor only the Almighty can appear Did the voice explain to you what you saw am to warn mankind To help him find his way back to God Then you must heed the voice We have a seer among us seer who receives messages from God Who is it The magistra Yes Father request your permission to help her transcribe her visions And what if its the Devils work m sure its not May show you one of her visions She wrote it down without my consent encouraged her to do it You know that must be punished ll face it gladly Father Again heard the voice from Heaven It said to me God who called the universe into being created everything so that His name be recognized and worshipped Through His creation He does not only proclaim the visible and temporal but also that which is invisible and eternal It would certainly be an extraordinary occurrence if Hildegards visions proved to be sent by God m convinced it is so It would bring us great honor And our cloisters name would be spoken everywhere Pilgrims would travel here our nations powerful men too and our benefactors would give new gifts ll go to see Archbishop Heinrich and the Mainz chapter to inform them These gentlemen have traveled far to put you to the test want you to answer them just as you answered me Magistra Hildegard You claimed youve received messages from God am merely His servant The messages come from the living light What does the light look like It is a fire that shines brightly Eternal inextinguishable and full of life Are you dreaming or awake do not see the visions in a dreamlike state not in sleep not in madness not with the bodys eyes or the ears of the outer person and not in remote places but rather awake in a clear state of mind with the eyes and ears of the inner person Its hard for fleshcloaked people to understand how it happens Youre saying that you can understand but we cant Its hard for me to understand too That a weak woman should be chosen by God to proclaim His will What does God demand That say what see and hear After such wonderful words m sure you do not doubt my Magistras credibility Since the holy prophets no man or woman has made such claims To claim to hear secrets that the prophets were denied Outrageous Only the Holy Father can judge her case She will probably be expelled from the Church as a heretic So secretly left the cave d been hiding in and wanted to climb up to where my enemy couldnt find me But they placed such a stormy sea before me that could not cross it Then heard my mothers voice Hurry my daughter The Almighty has given you wings to fly Fly over every obstacle shall write to Bernard of Clairvaux He is the most powerful one of all maybe more so than the Holy Father If he condemns you you are lost He could destroy you as he destroyed our brother Abaelardus know But must risk it He has just made a call to arms for a new holy war Hell be far too busy to answer an unknown nun Have you lost your faith in me Hes known for not liking women But he loves the virgin Mary will approach him with the greatest humility Revered Father Bernard have been lain in your soul that you reveal to me with your word whether you want me to speak or to keep silent the things see and that am appointed to do implore you by Gods grace to give me solace then will have certitude In God anything is possible You have come to the attention of the Holy Father At the Trier Synod You knew it was being held Yes venerable Father So youll know that our churchs highest dignitaries were present among them the great Cistercian abbot Bernard of Clairvaux He presented your visions to the Holy Father and entreated him not to allow such a bright light to be smothered by silence In this correspondence to the blessed virgin he grants you in the name of Christ and Saint Peter permission to publish everything you have heard from the Holy Ghost Then see in the heights of the divine secrets two throngs of divine spirits that sparkle in many lights Those in the first vision are holding feathers on their chests and faces that seem to be like pure water Those in the second vision are also holding feathers and human faces in which the image of the son of man shines as if in a mirror Venerable Father Richardis Margravine of Stade a relative ofJutta von Sponheim and her daughter Richardis My daughter heard of your reputation which even surpasses that ofJutta von Sponheim Since then she gives me no peace She wants to join your hermitage and take instruction from you How old are you Youre very young You were younger when you joined It was not a free choice Jutta my aunt was my age when you came to her And you believe you can endure daily life in a cloister Yes Dont think it will be easy Not everyone can keep the silence and bear the quietude You need not worry want to subordinate myself to you Not to me my child you must subordinate yourself to God Richardis may be lively but she is obedient and well educated for her age My family ensured that she learned to read and write as a young child Will you read something for us You have a lovely voice Will you take me The Magistra would be pleased to accept you here Have you considered the decision to leave her here Yes she agrees didnt ask you Forgive me please am sure that you can teach Richardis humility She certainly will Lets discuss the enrollment rules Very well We shall give it a try called you here to discuss the rules of St Benedict know them by heart But you havent followed them They are guidelines not commandments Thus you believe you can act according to your will No will act as am expected to Richardis We live in a community here We eat together work together we pray and we are silent together We respect one another And we try to help one another d prefer to live with you alone only joined to be with you You are so good and so wise want to learn everything from you No one is forced to stay Anyone can leave at any time You too Richardis If your faith is not strong enough want to be close to you as long as you live Volmar let me introduce Richardis von Stade She is a very bright girl She can help us transcribe the texts Yes have nice handwriting Thats my mothers opinion Well have to help you take our rules seriously take them seriously The only thing ll find hard is the vow of silence have so many thoughts want to share with someone We all feel that way to begin with The sylphs sometimes come at night Try to drive them out with prayer ve tried You must have patience child Stay in the garden awhile Enjoy the quietude listen to the birds She can speak and write Latin We could use a little demon like her It says here Thus am the living spring because all that was created was like a shadow within Me But the venerable Mother wrote Verat umbra e Me fuerant It should be fuit Can correct it Yes ll suggest to the Magistra that you join us when we work Thank you In the presence of the brothers and sisters gathered here ask you Do you swear to remain loyal to this cloister and our community through good and bad swear it Do you swear under the guidance of the Gospels to seek God to strive for repentance and to lead your life according to St Benedicts rules Yes swear it Will you honorJesus above all else and swear obedience Yes swear it May God who began His good work in you complete it Amen Wear this veil as a sign that you no longer belong to yourself but to Christ With Him you are joined in God Amen God has called upon this sister of ours to follow Christ in the monastic life Let us ask the Almighty Father to shower His mercy upon her and to help her to realize the oath she took today Venerable Mother This is my brother Hartwig Thank you for having the patience for my little sister As a child she climbed trees instead of praying believe one can pray even up a tree Our saints managed it on columns Just as the earth lets grow things of use and of no use the feet of man carry them to deeds of use and of no use When man does good deeds the elements have their proper path But when he does bad deeds he turns the elements against himself in punishment Do you believe that the elements can turn against us to punish us Yes my child do That is why we must account for everything we do and chasten ourselves For without the elements man cannot live Sister Richardis Well continue tomorrow Sister Richardis Straight after prayers Please bring me some wormwood wine Stand up and look at me You have broken the vow of chastity When did your menstruation stop Any other woman could rejoice But you have broken our rules Perhaps theres a medicine could take Sister Clara will have to leave the cloister No Please dont send me away regret it so deeply Believe me my child it weighs on my heart as much as yours The only thing we can do for you is to let you leave voluntarily No Your sisters will not find out No Dont send me away And ask God for forgiveness Dont send me away Please no cant return to my family Well find a way We need a cloister of our own Your own cloister The hermitage is too small for us Who gave you this heretical idea The living light showed me where we shall build our new dwelling And where is it Where the Nahe meets the Rhine on Rupert Hill It belongs to Count von Hildesheim We will not appropriate any property So how will you acquire it Using the gifts from our families They gave the gifts to this cloister Yes but largely because Jutta the Holy was here Now it is me who is revered would never let you virgins go anywhere unprotected Our virgins are unprotected here What do you mean by that For the male spirit it is often harder than for us to resist the temptation of the flesh Curb your tongue Hildegard By our presence here we are unable to help our brothers in their zeal to conquer their flesh If anyone here cannot conquer their flesh it is your sisters They seduce my brothers And not the other way around The brother who seduced Clara lives and will not reveal himself But she paid with her life hope that God sent her to the darkest corner of Hell And what do you hope for your brother The kingdom of Heaven shall write to the Dom Chapter today and ask for your excommunication And shall return tomorrow We took a vow never to leave this place Not until we die And after that well be buried here in our graveyard know my plan is against our rules But m responsible for our wellbeing and for those wholl join us in future dont think our mother would have agreed And want to be buried beside her am your mother now We can ask for her help in our prayers but you and must act Are you willing to do it will not break my vow Its the first time you leave me alone Alone Ask your little Richardis shell follow you anywhere For the last time Youve taken the veil here and your sisters will be buried here will also contravene the Archbishops orders Even he serves a higher master and its from Him that take orders You You take orders from the Devil You believe youre chosen by God but youve been tricked by an illusion Did you speak with the Father Venerable Father The Magistra is very ill She can no longer talk She has talked too much already But it is not her Father Yes its the living light You no longer believe in her gift m not the only critic of her visions Many eminent clerics are convinced that they are fake But you have always supported her Shes long known how to trick me Venerable Father fear shell die If so then it is Gods will Let us pray God our Father we commend Sister Hildegard to You Her pilgrimage has reached an end Deliver her from all evil that she may return to eternal peace Welcome her to paradise where there is no grief no mourning and no pain but only peace and joy with Your son and the Holy Spirit for ever and ever amen Brood of vipers Archbishop Heinrich of Mainz permits you and your sisters to leave our cloister and to move to the place that appeared in your vision My mother helped arrange it Without Gods help it would not have succeeded want you to hear our confessions before we leave here We must be pure of heart when we leave this place How long will it take before we at least have a roof It depends on the weather Mother want running water in all the work rooms Thats rather unusual and not easy to accomplish Water cleans the soul as well as the body Even the Romans knew that Youll have to put more effort in It wouldve been easier had you moved to the other side of the Rhine Yes but Saint Rupert lived here And were less cut off than we were at Disibodenberg Bingen the Rhine the Nahe Travelers from all over the world will bring us their learning heard from Salerno that Arabic medicine is more advanced than ours But the Arabs are heathens Mother Yes but they know a bit about medicine We ask to be freed from this serfdom We wanted our own cloister we cant go back now You wanted your own cloister Because you quarreled with Father we had to leave a place of comfort My family didnt send me to you to ruin my hands Ora et labora You know the rule We dont want to sleep on straw beds The time will come when we can adorn ourselves warn you It will count against you in Heaven Some of you will get on the wrong track and die before time My parents think youve been seduced by sylphs And that you use your gifts for your own glory not for us Then saw in the true vision that was beset with gloom as Moses had been For as he led the sons of Israel out of Egypt and into the desert they complained at God and afflicted Moses Thus God has granted that too shall be afflicted My dearest daughter want to hear proposals on how to deal with sisters who want to leave because they do not like the hard work and believe they deserve better than to live in poverty SisterJutta They should be allowed to go Sister Berta Stubbornness leads to punishment unity wins the crown say punish them Sister Gerhild The fourth stage of humility is nun is first obedient in hard times Even when injustice occurs she does not complain but embraces patience She is steadfast without tiring or running away For the scripture says He who is steadfast till the end shall be saved think we should let them leave If not theyll just sow discord and well end up hating each other But those who endure will pull together and love will triumph over hardship Cloister Rupertsberg ve come to demand whats rightfully mine What could that be The lands that my sisters have brought into this cloister You mean the sisters who left you because they couldnt stand it You know which properties refer to m prepared to give you half But we need the other half to survive The same goes for us We need it to survive Its Gods will that we do not starve that we may serve Him Ask the Margravine of Stade who lobbied so hard for you Or your protector the Archbishop of Mainz They can still your hunger The Devil take you The Archbishop has allowed me to serve as your provost Oh dearest Volmar You come at the right moment need you more than ever Bishopric of Mainz The visionary Hildegard who shines with admirable virtue will receive from us a water mill at Bingen Gorge and the surrounding land Thus is the existence of your cloister secured hope youll again dedicate yourself to transcribing your visions Were keen to read them Man stands in the middle of the world for he is more mighty than the other creatures living here He is small in form but the strength of his soul makes him large He is master of the upper and lower elements You too are great through your souls strength Just as mans heart is concealed within the body so is his body surrounded by the souls powers May say something that may enrage you Could you really enrage me child love you so deeply m afraid you may die before me shall certainly die before you Its perfectly natural cant live without you said that to my mother Jutta when was your age And then she died and passed on what she taught me to you And you shall one day pass on what youve learned from me It is a musical play Well perform it in honor of our great guest Magistra Tengwich from Andernach Each of you will portray a virtue You Richardis will be the soul who is seduced by the Devil Who shall be the Devil Our priest Volmar Hes the only one who may not sing He wont like that Who knows perhaps hed like to be a devil You have embraced me But now you destroy me through your repentance But shall conquer you All your paths are evil have seen it Now fight against you Now come to my aid Queen Humility with your enlightening power Victory you have overcome the Devil hurry here with your warriors Bind him glorious powers our Queen we belong to you and we follow your every command You know the letter from Paul to Timothy in which he says Women should dress decently modestly and demurely Their adornment shall not be gold pearls or fine clothes but instead good deeds One does not exclude the other Our virgins wear their white robes as visible proof of their union with Christ Paul ordained that women should cover their hair Your virgins wear it down and visible to all His commandment is for married women As virgins we are as naive and untouched as in paradise God loves beauty In paradise there was no ugliness We live on earth And paradise

tomorrow we shall continue our work There are men who possess an extraordinary masculine potency The sexual wind that blows in the loins of these men is more fiery than windy He is possessed of two tentlike formations that surround the trunk of all masculine powers and reinforce it and make it erect Just as one builds a bulwark around a tower As soon as the mans seed falls on its place the female blood draws it in with all the longing of its love and sucks it in in the same way that one draws in a breath And in this way female blood and the male seed are mixed What will be the title of

return to your cloister Therefore request from both of you if you consider me worthy That you love her as much as she loved you And should you have missed her think on the tears she shed at having to leave your cloister Had death not prevented it she would have returned here The world loved her beauty and intelligence But God loved her even more God again afflicted me with illness and my body fought for breath so that my veins with my blood my flesh with my fluids and my marrow with my bones dried out as if my soul would flee Then saw a great host of angels from St Michaels host One of them called to me Ah eagle Why do you sleep in your wisdom Rise up for the sun has brought you forth Then the entire host cried with a mighty voice Your work is not yet complete Up upl Rise up and

illnesses And will go traveling to preach Traveling to preach Yes You know what that means do Its unheard of ll be the first woman And turn everyone against you again And ll read our clerics the
