think she likes me too love my life So many things fascinate me in my life One of those things are ghosts But the weird thing is dont believe in them But when youre a filmmaker and youre given an

Derisio wait am am a student of in the film department We dont have a film department m just a student And m with Angela Bill Just like Emilee and they have a super amazing life And theyre also a bit

documentary that we could dont have ghost experience my self believe in ghosts Gullifat believe in ghosts True believers absolutely do not believe in ghosts So heading into it we knew we had to do something different Which meant no fake footage Oh beautiful oh wait a minute go back and do it again wasnt recording We knew that we had to talk to as many professionals as possible would have to say we are not professionals dont think there are any professionals in the paranormal field We utilized the latest in ghost hunting technology We just had a ghost over here a second ago And hours and hours of the setting footage ll just play along ll just play along And ll just play along ll just play along And when all is said and done hopefully we all learn something Remember kids dont drink and ghost hunt Thats this whole lesson and thats end of the movie Thats the end of the movie We just got it theres our end Bill So now its time to load up the car hit the road and make our first attempt at finding a ghost Yeah yeah yeah yeah What are you guys doing today Oh nothing what are you doing Bill dont know want to go catch a ghost Yeah lets go catch a ghost pages flipping Bill Tell me about your super power again Um can find hair in food super fast and can pee at any moment at any time Sean Um Angela Hes dog man Sean m dog man can attract and love any dog and they will love me back Bill And you can lick yourself Sean And can lick myself She compacts easily can grow my hair really long thats my superpower Bill What did you get Chili mango ball sack Bill Yes laughing Thats it they

bar of cookie dough So theres that Bill Yeah And Will always love you Bill We are just a few miles away Angela On the same road Bill Were on the same road that one Zak Bagans has travelled twice that we know of Angela Its called murder avenue Bill Murder Angela Yeah didnt they get murdered Everyone in the town Bill Did the whole town get dont know Do you know more history about to his town than do Angela Nope just have a feeling group laughing Every single person Bill What if with showed up now and they were all dead Every shot like Jessica Lange and American Horror Story We got to Virginia City Number one the girls were hungry Is this scary Bill At least youre not eating any ball sack any more Not yet This is the funny video that gets made before you go into the haunted location where everybody gets murdered in their sleep Enjoy it Number two we had to meet Dawn My first impression of Dawn was that she was Not that close not that close Get the bleep off me Loud She definitely was a character But she was goofy and nice But knew it was going to be interesting We just wanted to show up in Virginia City and find the damn ghost as soon as we got there Bill and were out here looking at the brewery And the lights were on upstairs We were kind of looking at it as we turned to walk away that door right there just slammed closed Sean Oh the scary looking one Angela Yeah the scary looking one Just slammed closed So that was fun Angela and split up from the rest of the group and we went down to the world famous Washoe Club We were lucky enough to meet up with Tom and Debbie with Bats In The Belfry and they gave us a lot of information about the Union Brewery that we werent able to find anywhere else To my understanding its been a saloon or bar for a very very long time Yeah They danced in the downstairs area and the basement that was also another bar down there Thats where Tom saw a full body apparition saw the apparition peak from behind the wall Stick its head and upper body So we headed back to the union brewery Everybody else went down into the basement did not Sean dont like this Emilee Everything all right footsteps What you gonna do Sean swear to God somebodys standing in the stairway Bill Where Sean Behind me Bill Take a picture real quick Then we went to investigate the upstairs apartment Sean What do we have here Emilee Something really cute like this wall here Sean love the brick Anyway is this or is this a Emilee Its really cute Bill really love this wall over here ll take it Sean feel like the building is leaning to the side feel like m gonna fall over Bill Well its what yours old Sean Yeah Bill like that fan too And then we went to the main floor to play with the spirit box Dawn can hear you on that so know youre trying to come through Now we never really worked with a spirit box before Theres was a lot of interference with the light and where she would put the spirit box the noises that were coming out of it Can you put that back down a minute just so can look Put it back down for a minute so can look Bill Thats whats giving interference Dawn No please put it back down Bill See Dawn We just had voices Please put it back down Tom Honey you keep getting interference Please but it back down will say we were all very excited about this will also say we didnt know what the hell we were doing It was really interesting sat down next to her for a while Did you hear it heard it Dawn kept asking questions a lot of questions over and over again There were a couple of responses that we got Dawn How many more people spirit box crackling Weve already heard you three times What Angela Right right Did you say right The spirit box was really active thought the spirit box was interesting didnt know how it worked but we seemed to be getting responses out of it Dawn mumbling So listened and then realized that people are going to hear what they want to hear An example being right here Did he say kill you Angela No He said sure No heard kill you Emillee heard killer Angela heard sure Sorry can you say it again heard kill you Sean heard jeweler Angela They just said something Spirit Box Jeweler jeweler jeweler jeweler We were excited and we were engaged with it We were asking questions we were getting responses Dawn Are you annoyed with Nick Dawn whispering Angela Its just the music from the channels Dawn It said something There was a study recently that if you play either or statements from the ovilus or the spirit boxes to people randomly Just grab a bunch of people who dont know anything about this subject and ask them what it says theyll come up with different things And then if you tell them what it says they will all hear the same thing The moment you tell somebody what that pattern says if the pattern was not extremely clear to begin with they will hear something else They will hear what you tell them to So theres that issue as well All of those things are a problem with this Not to mention that you never know if these things are gimmicked in some way too So Bill and slept in the brewery Originally Sean was going to sleep in the brewery with Emilee and but somebody wimped out was not going to stay the night in the Union Brewery And was also not going to stay the night at the Silver Queen hotel by myself was told was staying in the hotel room with Angela Although we didnt hear anything as we were sleeping the digital recorders actually picked up some things that we actually couldnt explain If you actually listen closely enough youll hear are they still sleeping And another one that we like to refer to as bleep storm static crackling Because you can hear a piano thumps and drags didnt hear it until we heard it on the its an old building though it could have been anything so Slept through the night didnt hear anything except for that little clangy thing that was going And what did you hear wont film you cause you havent gotten ready yet had my earplugs in and it sounded like somebody was whispering in my ear without earplugs So ended up taking my ear plugs out so could actually hear things And so for the scariest thing that have witnessed all night long is the coffee place doesnt open until am After breakfast we took Bill and Emiliee up to show them our room they were going to be checking into the hotel that day as well And while we were doing that something pretty interesting happened stars creaking Brunette Lady m getting funny noises in here today Sean What is that sound up there like that womans cave thats making all that sound Brunette Lady Its the broke water main Thats why there was no water Brunette Lady Yes maam Angela That would be why the water main broke whirring noises Bill What Yeah look it laughing heartily Bill Thats awesome That is awesome Angela Since were here m gonna put better eyeliner on Bill All right So what happened Angela It locks automatically And when we went to go upstairs closed it tight and pushed and pulled and double checked cause m like m leaving the camera here blah blah blah the doors latched yep were good Angela you got the key she said yes Emilee Who closed the door Sean did Bill So what just happened So we left to go look at your room Bill just want to get your hair while youre doing this Made sure that we had the key Sean closed the door it locks automatically came back downstairs and our room was open Sean coughing Seah Ah sorry got a thing Emilee And then what happened last night So last night was standing right here doors locked it automatically locks You close it it locks on its own Standing here reading all of sudden the door just goes like that and probably went sat in that chair over there and cried Bill Thanks Ghostbama Bill So how easy is this not to close door slamming see this so this turns If it manages to stick and it doesnt Lets do lunch Emilee Youre in front of the camera Sean Oh Angela The size of our room and Emilee Oh yeah Angela Sorry Bill Am too fat to just wear this tshirt No Define fat We left one camera focused on the door of our room to see if we could capture anything and we headed back across the street to the Union Brewery to get our first interview with Nick the other owner of the brewery Bill My son Austins now here Say hi Austin Hows it going Bill Austins going to be joining the crew came in from college for the weekend to film didnt actually believe in ghosts before bought it was a nonbeliever We have a very unusual collection of stuff like balls of shadow men and noises voices etc It never felt like was alone got thrown down the stairs off my ladder was in the basement moving boxes down to the back room where the old brewery used to be saw a shadow We already had a psychic that said it was a woman living in the attic and three children that have the run of the building Bill Are you trying to get the ghosts to be more friendly with you now Yeah even bought them a bottle of bourbon with couple of glasses and they didnt drink it so had to couldnt waste it It still scares me to go down the basement And on that cue to the basement Okay were recording and heading down See if the night vision works Okay not very well cant see anything Angela Good Bill Yeah Oh the light vision wasnt on there we go Night visions on now Were in the basement Daytime session We just did a really quick Electronic voice phenomenon electronic voice phenomenon was first popularized during the spiritualist movement at the turn of the century when audio recording technology first appeared Ps are basically voices of the dead captured on tape According to some experts spirits use the energy of the recording device to communicate through white noise Ps are classified into three groups depending on their intensity Ps are not generally heard at the time of the recording but can be identified during playback Usually an is just one word or short sentences or phrase ad sometimes its just a groan grunt or growl There is not scientific evidence to prove an is actually a communication from the deceased We tried to do an session but this was about in the afternoon and Virginia City is a party town There was just no way that it wasnt going to be completely contaminated so we called that off Where do you think we should put these little stuffed animals Angela brought some target props for the little girl downstairs puffin and a teddy bear and we set those up in the stairs to see what would happen Dawn had mentioned to Lala a few times before our trip that there was a little girl that resides there little girl spirit she actually sent a picture of what to me does look like a little girl standing on the stairs that go down into the basement It does look like a little girl it looks like shes balding but it is a good picture Were placing the trigger objects weve got a puffin and a teddy bear If you move them then well know that youre here And as Bill was filming the trigger objects these tiny little white sparkles started to appear on the stairs around the stuffed animals He saw them first and then showed me on his camera And it was pretty amazing at first It seemed to be responding to Bill Bill Whos here can you tell me your name all see that Angela Yeah Bill Now something just keeps flying in front of it Did you see it whispering Awesome you see it Sean ve seen it once Bill See that sparkle that keeps happening Can you walk by or sit by or be by the animals again Angela Oh yeah Bill See it that The same spot every time Angela Thats cool Emilee Yeah Bill Right when ask you to do it After that we went upstairs and began immediately reviewing the footage Bill of course being the skeptic trying to debunk it Me of course being the true believer going but wait it answered your question it responded Bill Thats it does it right when say that feel like they would be moving slower than they would be moving if they were kicked up with wind It was happening when asked it to happen and there was that flash in that spot that glitter little sparkle but then again its a camera a digital camera But look the orbs moving The orbs was not a glitch Sean If its repeatable dust doesnt follow a track Again m not going to say its a ghost It could be dust we mentioned dust Sean It could be magical intelligence repeating dust It could be fairy dust and now were going to call this fairymentary so it will be interesting to do it again tonight Do you want to know the history of orbs They were bleep made for a very long time a big deal about his statements on news that ghosts were everywhere He was getting orbs in haunted places and his logic was ghosts are everywhere orbs are everywhere therefore orbs are spirits That is incredibly illogical because you know what chairs were there too so if theres a ghost in the house and theres a chair in the house then the chair must be the ghost All right so now during the s something else happened There was a shift toward digital photography and there was an increase in the power of flashes so reflective surfaces and when you have the short focal length were getting semi reflective surfaces would cause flashbacks So just because youre getting orbs doesnt mean youre getting ghosts You have to have some independent verification If thats the only thing youve got youve got nothing Earlier that day Lala Dawn Nick and took a little bus tour of Virginia City and one of the things that thought was really interesting was the cemetery Okay here we are at the cemetery Here we are at the cemetery she took the tour today The most famous prostitute she was murdered for her jewelry and furs and they buried her at the base of the mountain All the men wanted her buried in the cemetery with all of their families type of religion and all the women said no Doesnt it seem like the beginning of a horror movie like a new one now Hey guys lets go in the cemetery its gonna start getting dark So they said the prostitute had like a thousand people at her funeral because she was very much loved As we were walking in and she was telling us the story we heard nothing Not a sound coming from anywhere Our footage has the recording of what we can only describe as a cattle drive rocks crunching We knew that there was another group of people like three people quietly walking down the hill from us It was nothing but quiet It was beautiful we got amazing footage cellphone ringing Hold on Hey honey were shooting were up on top of the Boato parking garage This is why you turn your phone off when youre filming Yeah Bill If any of us would have heard that which appeared to be some sort of cattle drive going right by us we would have said to the camera hey theres a cattle drive going right by here You can actually here yee haw you hear horses running you hear men shouting garbled audio it could have been anything but the fact that the five of us did not hear it and how clear it was on the camera it seems a lot Is that the cult down there Its a house That was the what did they say that was That was the John Cooper milling camp It does sound like a cattle drive It also sounds like crows We were also in a giant valley that is full of people who might be hurting cattle We miss so much by not allowing the quiet and the stillness of the now to fully envelop us And by doing that you become this incredible listening device a device that can see and you can experience beyond anything that can describe All right so scanning on a different frequency here dont know if you know what that means but it might help us hear you better Can you say hello Okay well All right ghost were gonna go cause youre not here Whats over there So really wished you would have talked to us So we went back to the union brewery and wanted to play with the spirit box a little bit more So was just messing around with it asking questions seeing if could get any answers out of it research device Sean Do you want to go downstairs or do you want to try again later Is there anybody in here right now Please tell me yes on this spirit box static crackling theres a viking in here Is there anybody else here that wants to say hi Spirit Box Sounds like Sounds like what m just going station by station now static crackling garbled Talking Voiceover Nothing Voiceover How can you think about nothing Voiceover do it all the time Were haunted were haunted by a married couple that has a laugh track Voiceover Will you tell me the truth mean thats not the way that it is used People dont use it by going one station at a time mean thats not Do you see it mean have seen it used where there is no chance of a radio signal being picked up at all Okay ll admit could be wrong but dont believe the stuff that were hearing in here is a spirit think its a radio If you randomly get a saying certain words youre going to hear that or a commercial or whatever Youre gonna hear what you want to hear d have to say my least favorite unfortunately and its very popular out there is probably going to be the ghost boxes ve taught classes where ve actually recorded like a two hour cycle and presented it to my students and said were going to try this experiment and m gonna turn this ghost box on and want you guys to ask questions and see if you get any answers And sure enough with something that was prerecorded they didnt know that it was prerecorded they were still able to pull out answers out of questions that they were asking live at that moment Unfortunately in this field its so easy to point at shadows and flickers of lights and strange noises and say oh thats a ghost Spirit Box The spirit box captures spirit voices in real time Using a millisecond adjustable forward and reverse frequency sweep and using high frequency white noise the box scans and frequency ranges from mega hertz to mega hertz The first spirit box is said to date back to Thomas Edison who is rumored to have been working on a variation of the box wile inventing the phonograph Frank Sumption inventor of the modern day spirit box claims spirits helped him invent the device and white noise creates raw audio that spirits can use to communicate with the user The is a spinoff of Sumptions invention and was originally created to communicate with extra terrestrials There is no scientific proof that the spirit box does what its claimed When we were finished with that Angela and had the opportunity to go back to the Washoe and have a private tour of the second floor Here we are in the stairway heading upstairs of the world famous Washoe Club was scared but was excited was scared excited was excited scared didnt know what was Thomas was gracious enough to take us upstairs and as we moved through the location there was a physical change in our bodies You feel it up there you just feel it He took us through all the hotspots in the areas where things have been captured on film where things have been reported Thomas took us into a room that we stood at the entrance he says Go in that room Angela Okay No thanks When we got inside Thomas said tell me if theres an area in this room that feels different always leave it up to the individual walked up put my hand on the spot and said right here Thomas Yes youre exactly right He then told us the history of the room Thomas This spot there was a woman that was in this spot She was so terrified she was not killed but she was so terrified and it imprinted in that corner It wasnt until later reviewing the footage as m standing there with my hand on the wall we have the glowing white light anomaly come out of my hand and Float up my arm can explain the feeling and cant give you the feeling on film of what was happening in that room will say it was intense It was one of the most intense paranormal experiences ve ever had It was emotional and it was scary and it was exciting and it was draining Bill What you did however the guy had you do to go to that spot that actually going back to Gertrude Schmeidler she pioneered an experiment you can conduct in the field which is you take a bunch of people who dont know anything about the ghost story into a house give them a floor plan and say see if anything feels weird in this house And you do it in two houses one haunted and one not and see if they mark the spots that actually match what the witnesses say And you get these great responses that people always pick the stuff up so back to your question about how we prove it to a skeptic explain that Thomas Have you ever watched Ghost Adventures That floor of the Washoe Club was what really started it all for Ghost Adventures and every series every ghost television show has been there at one point or another so we felt incredibly lucky to be there Thomas Remember the first two or three seasons they showed a noose Sean Yeah Thomas There it is Sean What Thomas Yep Angela Thats the noose Thomas Yeah thats the noose Its old phone cord laughing dont know maybe Zak and them did it back in Sean Okay tell me whats going on right now Oh with went to the Washoe Club just got really really cold and my head just started killing me and m not a headache girl As a believer do think that spirits and entities can draw your energy out of your body dont know but do know is that when came back downstairs and asked the bartender for some aspirin two other people in the bar with her both all turned around and said That is not uncommon up there So dont know if theres asbestos or something that causes people to have headaches or if the ghosts are just grabbing the back of my neck really hard That could be it dont know Sean Or aliens It could be aliens thats a possibility While Sean and Angela were at the Washoe Club we stayed at the brewery to investigate the basement with a San Francisco based paranormal group We asked to just quietly come along and watch think would honestly say after this weekend you probably will be convinced Ill That was Dawn on the stairs tagged Blonde You saw something Dawn Dawn Yes blonde Lady What Dawn Sorry Blond Lady Are you by Dawn right now Dawn Cold chill right through my body Blonde Lady felt a little bit of that too So the ovilus starts spewing out random words Blond Lady Sultry are you a woman Dawn No its a man And apparently there was a ghost behind her Blonde Lady If you want to show us digging it said Dawn Its right behind us right behind me Blonde Lady Are you behind her Dawn m stuck here with you Blonde Lady It said cleansing Dawn dont want to cleanse dont want to cleanse you unless you want me to Hey Jim can you come and sit next to me right now Jim would you like to cuddle Dawn Dawn wouldnt mind a cuddle At least it didnt say youre horny Blonde Lady Jim Jim Its like the ghost is Steven Hawking Blonde Lady Were now in phonetic mode Dawn m not that unattractive Come sit with me Whos down here Bill are you down here Bill m down here Dawn Are you believing yet or not Bill All m doing is trying to capture everything can thats my best bet Dawn Thats a narrow yes Bill Thats a havent figured it out yet When you start hearing worlds like Brunette Man Were trying to contact we know you can use those Come over here dont mind all that screaming Dawn No okay so m here Brunette Man Automatic Well thats a very unusual name More talking fiddle Did you play the fiddle Dawn Are you a crazy fiddle player or part of a band and a banjo You realize this is about as random as its gonna get And we call it a night Ovilus voice box We may as well get this one as perfect as we can Ovilus vice box created by retired electronic engineer Bill Chappell The ovilus voice box convert environment readings electromagnetic frequencies temperatures etc to real words and phonetic responses The device contains a database of over stored sounds words and syllables Users combine environmental readings with the word database to receive audible responses which generally come one word at a time There is no scientific proof the validity of the the ovilus Dawn comes walking upstairs with her spirit box and starts screaming at it Do we have anybody here tonight static crackling cant hear Can you hear it Did that say ugly hope you didnt call me ugly its gonna piss me off Youre saying yes three times Bill Cant figure it out what is that You have to listen to it Thats what youre getting Thats not right no way no way Party is okay party is okay That was a male voice that just came through Look m old and tired and going to bed early so give me a name pacman music Sean If anybody else wants to tell a story they can crawl in bed Okay so we are not dont want you to smell my feet So the story goes like this We get settled in for our delicious pizza and Which was very delicious It was so good Sean It was good pizza was happy with it Dawn begins to yell First she asked so do you believe yet Do you need to go down to the basement by herself What was it An hour an a half Sean An hour an a half m not going going to smell your feet can smell them Oh youre a weenie youre scared to death no balls So the only reason was able to go is cause you actually stood up and started pointing at her and talking to her too And was like cuse me That was good You guys talk m gonna put socks on cause my feet smell Yes they do Our plan for the evening wish was going to be an extensive investigation of the brewery is now out the window but this does not discount this trip did have experiences at the Union Brewery in the basement and stinky with the donkey Back up the pack the Union Brewery is haunted had fat sticking out Bill you know what have to edit that out my fat stomach sticking out You know what you should do is you should go back to the brewery and spend a half and hour in the basement by yourself first of all Dawn would be there And would kill myself and then would haunt the place So its a winwin Weve got will you come back and say m Bill m a ghost Get on the speaker box and ll have a station thatll play all the top ghost hits Is this Lady Gaga heard your name said on here Actually want to get were going to do a quick shot of Austin sitting in the barber chair cause his chair his jacket matches Hell be camoed in to the chair Here we go Does it turn Okay thats it done After Virginia City realized that if you want to see a ghost youre gonna see a ghost couple of things happened to me personally in Virginia City that made me believe a little bit more But a lot of things also made me a little more skeptical than was going into this actually left Virginia City believing ghosts less than did before On leaving Virginia City we realized a few things First of all we realized we didnt really know what we were doing We were barely scratching the surface of what we wanted to do with this film But we were interested in learning more and figuring out how to do this the correct way We wanted more think we just needed more experience mean are we really investigating correctly We were sure we even knew what a ghost was Bill Okay whats a ghost ghost is a soul and your soul wants you die dont know what a ghost it Once youre dead you turn into someone else So assuming that you do believe in ghost Yeah What exactly is a ghost think a ghost is someone who doesnt realize theyre dead dont know its like someone else in the room but you can barely see it Probably a spirit that is stuck here after the persons body is dead Most of my knowledge comes from the cartoons like Scooby Doo You know thats always usually just a guy though in a mask Yep The whole time Unmasked Its like a really angry guy so If it wasnt for those kids we would have gotten away with it Well both stand close to him that way How many yeah it looks like Sean ate four cameras The word ghost is not actually what we typically use in parapsychology cause in many cultures it has different flavors different meanings But most people in the United States would take the word ghost to mean someone who has died or has come back or who stuck around after their death We would use the word apparition for that Its an older term but it actually is a little bit cleaner than ghost because it doesnt have the same cultural or crosscultural connotations to it The apparition or ghost in that case would be someones consciousness personality spirit mind soul whatever you want to call it that survives the death of the body and is still here Typically has not moved on to wherever it is they go but is still here and is capable of interaction Thats the interaction thats the most important piece for us because the other side of the coin is what people still use the word ghost for Which is some sort of repeating pattern what a lot of ghost hunters call residual energy or psychic imprint We like to call place memory its a haunting Places are haunted objects are haunted they seem to have memory of people and events that were kind of recorded by living people not by dead people that can be seen as ghosts It can be seen as holograms or however you want to see it And those are not interactive so on the one hand we have consciousness which is interactive after death and the other we have pictures imprints of us who are potentially still alive in fact So we did a online survey of the people said that they do believe in ghosts But only say theyve actually seen a ghost What makes you believe in ghosts although you have zero personal evidence Maybe people want to believe think they believe in them because theyve heard other peoples stories Part of me when somebody tells me a ghost story deep in my head m thinking all right okay you think you saw something but then dont think anybodys lying when they see it because reality is people love and respect have ghost stories Several us of had unexplained things happen to us And the one that can tell you about happened directly to me And have a ghost story to go with that story When was a teenager living with my parents So my ghost story takes us back to fifth grade was there with my then best friend We were staying alone in the house this is a big four story house that houses about guys We had this old piano in our basement And it had come across the United States on a covered wagon His parents were out for the evening so we grabbed his dads Ouija board So we were gonna go relieve ourselves in the sump pump And said as we were doing this wouldnt it be weird if the door shut and the lights turned off Black ivory keys mean it was really worn and old and would learn how to play piano on it Then the thing literally did start moving Right after said that and right after he said that the door slammed shut and the light blew out hear a woman singing thinking its my mom and just kind of snicker and laugh as m playing along and my mom and my sister look at each other and they said No we were not singing All the cabinet doors started just banging The window opened and shut So we ran out of the there like Shaggy and Scooby And thats when ran the rest of the way up the stairs and did not go into the basement for a good month We ran and hid in their parents other car until they got home Bill Ghosts Sean Ghosts Like what you will hear is an intro Where live what do do you need any of that stuff Bill would like your social security number and mothers maiden name Well thats a good reason let me check my bank card have it all written on the back Bill Give us some history It is super haunted Well actually do know bit of history What are you m not doing this m not going to chase you with that laughing So why are we here today Well cause you wanted me to tell you wanted people to tell ghost stories and have a ghost story about this building know a lot of people do but have one Bill So go hey come with me an then walk off camera What is this Cribs Yeah Come check it out walked off camera and then you followed me laughing loudly Does it work if you keep ll try it again okay Here we go here we go m not going to say ghost but ghosts right now Voiceover ll wait Bill Its not porn So got up to the top floor with my little heat bag thing with my pizza delivery and got out and came out here finished up with the delivery and got back in the elevator to go back down and pushed floor one and the elevator door closed The elevator starts to go down feel that little lurch in your stomach right and it goes floor bing five bing four bing three waiting to get off the elevator and the elevator doors open The elevator doors open and step out and m still on the sixth floor havent moved mean found the staircase and took the stairs down like five six at a time and got back to the pizza place and told my manager never again That was the scariest thing ve ever done m done thats it Bill Hence end your career delivering pizza It did also the place closed down cause it wasnt very good but mostly ghosts m sort of skeptic myself dont know necessarily that believe just know what happened and that certainly did happen Bill So around the sixth floor Yep top floor of the building that you can go to besides the roof Okay floor one and it just literally every single floor Bill Well apparently we skipped four We skipped four elevator beeping And number two elevator beeping okay felt it theres no Matt Theres no ghost hate even Bill If we woke up and if we see Brian Oh Congratulations Bill Are you real Is this the first floor m really glad were on the first floor right now Because literally if that happened again d probably have a panic attack just ran into Aaron from Ghost Adventures Hello Whats the scariest thing you ever encountered The scariest thing ever encountered would be my house tend to bring things home dont say stay there say if you wan to come home with me come home with me ve got part of a social experiment already So my house stuff bring home m talking spirits loud laughing drowning out Nicollete okay took my finger and scraped it across the grave of this witch in Jamaica and broke a piece of her grave and said since we did this youve got a piece of me ve got a piece of you and pretty much after that she followed me home and still live there laughing probably shouldnt have done that No dont think youre stuck with your body think thats the peak of your ego collapse where you have to leave your body behind Youve spent your entire life being attached to your body and when you die you have to give it up You died and somebody goes there was like a ghost travel agent and they said well take you anywhere you want to go and thats where youre gonna go and you can do anything forever what would you do d hump my wife for the rest of her life So hes gonna go before you guess so feel sorry for the next guy d go to Hawaii and hang out on the beach and eat a lot of donuts What are my powers Ghost powers standard ghost powers where would you go First d go to in and out and then get some fries Floating going scaring people Ghost are more of locked to where they died or they had unfinished business so that more like So itd be better to die at Disneyland Yeah yeah Than like an insurance seminar dont know d probably go haunt people on the bridge You know and just like theyre sitting on the bridge and just be like whoo and theyre like oh no did somebody push me That so funny thats not what they would be thinking Yeah Ah did somebody push me So youd murder people Theres a rare rare cases where you might find a ghost actually attached to a location They become so connected to that location for various reasons Often times it can be a location of tragedy for example Extreme violence took place in their transition when they died and often times they can be so connected to a location because of their addiction if can use that to their previous life video game music We went to the Cottonwood Cemetery which was started in so its in Fort Boise There have been reports of horse hooves and babies crying We brought our really good friend and film maker Ron Torres to come with us Ron will say that from a distance is a weird noise For no other reason than he had nothing better to do Okay this is session one Cottonwood Cemetery Friday night Did we lose Emilee actually do have a story When was guess or and was up there with a buddy of mine late at night just sitting on top of the picnic table cover and we heard to this day probably the scariest most blood curdling scream ve ever heard in my life It was to where we literally jumped to the ground ran to the car raced down the mountain went to the old down on the corner of Broadway and called the police Bill It wasnt would say m an in danger It wasnt like an m in danger scream it was more like drums drowning out Bill Yeah it was like ll swallow your soul ll swallow your soul Pretty much Bill Weve come out tonight to talk to you Let you know that were here Theres this little red light at the end of these if you come and talk into them well be able to hear you Sean keep hearing something Its that way and its not Bill and Emilee Angela and had heard a sound off in the distance and seen a light coming from the same area So we walked over to the corner of the cemetery closest to it to investigate see it right now Sean Yeah Again its not coming from the fence You see the fourth row of tombstones Emilee Hmmmm Sean Follow it down and just go up Bill If we find we go to do it here Theres a lot of wind and oh yards away flag flapping Oh theres a flag pole and you can hear the flag whipping in the wind and then the chain hitting the pole So its kind of understandable that somebody might think that they hear horses There not by chance ghosts This really kind of happened when we reviewed the footage we didnt get any thing but this looks great so we started thinking about other ghost shows And the thing that really bugged me is the presentation You know how easy is it with a little bit of music and night vision to kind of make this stuff up or make people more anxious scary music Did you see that Reality ghost shows are super cheesy and definitely scripted You know ve turned down shows myself because the producers directors they want me to look the other way if they decide to alter a story or alter the evidence And all of a sudden got pushed in the small of my back down and it was only three stairs On Ghost Adventurers they made it seem like fell all the way down One of my colleagues Barry Taft was asked originally he was approached for the show before Jason and Grant was and the producers Barry said the producers actually asked him how he felt how comfortable he feels about faking things Flat out Thats why he didnt do the show Bill just realized m Scooby Dooing this scenario Can you do an impression of a ghost Ah no think you can think youre hesitant Like ooh The answer m looking for is boo Boo And then maybe some arm failing like ah like that Maybe When a ghost has got the hand thing Do it make sounds dont think so Chains chains that was an acceptable answer if they had chains on Its like dangling stuff or moving dont know at all You dont want to the do an impression do you No dont An impression of a ghost Well usually theyre trapped in their daily activities lot of people dont understand what a ghost is or a lot of people dont believe in it And when they do experience it it freaks them out to the point where most people cant recover from it am a pultic master If could talk to somebody who was dead and needed to give them some information to help them exist better would tell them realize that you have no limitations on what is tangible What it is that they did in their regular life they usually still do it and you can penetrate thought you can penetrate mystery you can penetrate mass and energy you can penetrate time and location m not afraid to die m actually looking forward to it What would understand if someone was murdered theyre forced to relive that over and over again Even if you die in your sleep anytime your soul leaves your shell anytime the soul leaves its shell its always painful regular person who dies from regular old age or something just walking around their house they dont really realized whats going on They havent been told or they dont realize that theyre dead so they just go about their day lives and when they finally do realize that theyre dead they usually leave as soon as they realize it They go oh whats that light in the corner they been looking at his whole time and they been walking through From what understand its not really a light Its more like a tunnel Maybe we need to go where people have peacefully died in their sleep Growing up here we had heard stories for years about the old tuberculosis hospital over in Gooding Tuberculosis Sean Tuberculosis Tuberculosis They heard footsteps upstairs in the attic a little girl singing Some of the people there said theyve been able to look upstairs when theyre outside and see someone looking at them through the windows Tuberculosis say it one more time hold on Sean Tuber Tuber Seean Cu Cu Sean Losis Tuberculosis Sean Tuberculosis In the early s the tuberculosis bleep Okay we got it traffic flowing Angela The secret to ghost hunting is Mexican Candy Sean Oh

love ass Well once you start you cant stop Tricalcium phospate was added to make it free flowing Thats sad She just had a seizure It taste kind of like those essential oil bath salts that you put in your bath not the bath salts that make you eat peoples faces But dont think its that bad really It taste kind of like soap Sean Soap But kind of like it m still not sure why theres a peanut in that Austin LinkedIn dont want to eat it want to go scrub my tongue off loud footsteps Sean Okay were getting radio station nearby want to take the antenna off completely Sean It isnt screwed in That is an option Sean All right With can make a tiny unicorn horn for your cat already have an inflatable one static crackling garbled voices Bill All right should we just shut that off for now and then all right so much for the spirit box Okay were recording this is session one The attic of the University Inn Up here theres kids Is there anybody here with us tonight Can you give us a sign can you let us

Get it away ah get it away Sean Its Ghost Adventures Emilee What did it feel like a spider or like Bill You know what it felt like Like a piece of wood fell from something a little light fell and touched the top of my head Angela Why does it have to be a piece of wood maybe it was a ghost Bill Cause m a woodist a materialist m a racist towards other materials Okay see bleep ah Angela Youre the only one its talking to Check Bill for spiders Bill Check me for spiders Is there a spider on me Sean No theres no spider Bill Is there anything on me Sean This is the first place of everywhere weve been that feel m losing it and dont know if its because felt something tapping me Emilee Thatll do it When we first got up here didnt feel anything and now ve just got this like Angela did when we first came up here with the lady that owns the place felt like something was watching us from over here Sean Something just got me in the back of the head What did it feel like Sean It felt like somebody tickling me in the back of the head Enilee Are you playing with the boys Sean Do you want us to go or do you want us to stay croaking Sean Can you touch me almost pooped my pants right there chair falling over Angela What Sean Can you do that again Brushed chills over me and then something touched my shoulder Bill Umhmm thats exactly what happened to me Emilee Yeah we got chills too Sean Did anybody notice that it just got a little cooler in here It did over here Bill ve got a pretty steady state of chills going down me loud footsteps Somebody doesnt know how to spell redrum laughing Voiceover Quick you turn left This is the thats the original sinks feel like the is the question Bill We are in the basement in the nurses lounge Angela Thats my ankle popping It its not a demon coming from the depths of hell That is arthritis Bill Flash Emilee Lets take this ball upstairs when we go Sean All right go for it chips crunching You want some door dragging Yeah laughing loudly Bill Ghosts Put your hand why are you not even touching it am touching it but what do we ask dont know Okay so were going to ask a couple questions The first question being is there anybody with us right now loud footsteps Okay Its broken laughing loudly We met our friend David and he told us about a ghost tour in Pioneer Square Bill Hey everybody its our friend David Mead Hi David why are we here today Hi well a while back went on one of the tours here in Seattle Its a great tour showing all kinds of interesting places around Seattle that could or could not be haunted So actually went cause was asked out on a date and she brought me down here and as our date we went on Bill And how did the date end Spectacularly Where is she now dont know Bill So it went well All right lets go inside Well m Ross Ellison president and founder of Ghost which stands for the Advanced Ghost Hunters of Seattle Tacoma m also the owner of Spooked in Seattle ghost tours ve been in the field of paranormal research for over years started Spooked in Seattle ghost tours due to the fact that was doing ghost tours on all my trips and d find out that they made up a lot of stories and dramatized a lot of stories on these tours So when decided to do my ghost tours decided to get the stories real The first sound you hear is that of Ross the second is that of the entity And show evidence that we had actually collected on our own personal investigations That fan is too loud Bill Did you hear something over there And its become so popular that we were actually voted as one of the top four tours in Seattle Well when started my ghost hunting group back in we were one out of a hundred nationally And now due to the popularity of ghost hunting its easily that each state could have over a hundred groups or more But unfortunately the problem that we have today is theres a lot of what we call paradrama or a lot of these groups dont know what theyre doing Theyre territorial and they will do anything they can to get their minutes of fame Before got involved in ghost hunting there was a few names out there that of course followed You had you know Lorraine and Ed Warren Hans Holzer Loyd Auerbach those are the names that grew up reading their material and watching their career So for me ve always respected our roots where ghost hunting came from For me like where its going as to becoming more scientific more equipments coming out there But will never forget our roots and always have respect for those who have been doing this a lot longer than have So Ross brought up a name that we kept hearing and it was Professor Loyd Auerbach was lucky enough to be introduced to a man named Renny who actually had worked with this professor before So at that point we knew that if we were ever going to attain Jedi level we needed Yoda Super nervous so were calling Loyd Auerbach from the Rhine Institute the Winbridge Institute hes the director for the office of paranormal investigations Hes kind of a big deal What do go Professor Aeurbach Sean Youre basically talking to the Brett Favre of paranormal investigations know ugh phone ringing Voiceover Hi this is Loyd So yeah hes excited We are going to San Francisco to meet with his majesty the president of ghosts Thats what he is clapping had to stay in Boise while everyone else went to San Francisco because had to adult Be my girl cant you take things You love and leave the rest behind know you think youre car revving Weve decided to scrap Ghostementary and were going with the remake of Magnum Whats Magnum laughing Youre dead to us You are no superheros girl You are no superheros girl You are no superheros girl You are no superheros girl You are no you are no record scratching want to throw up Bill Why are you gonna throw up dont know it was probably those baby octupus octopi Bill Is it octopus octopussy Octopushwa speaking foreign language Fish speaking foreign language What We finally got to go and meet Professor Loyd Aeurbach We drove to Lafayette California and went to his office at the Institute where he was gracious enough to give us pretty much an entire afternoon of his expertise and brilliance Okay m Loyd Aeurbach m a professor at John Kennedy University Atlantic University and an instructor at Institute which is where we are right now m a parapsychologist have a masters degree in parapsychology going way way back and have been around the field for over years Actually a lot longer than that ve been an investigator mostly an educator but ve also been involved somewhat in research in a number of different places m on the board of director at the Rhine Research Center m president of the Forever Family Foundation m an advisor to the Windbridge Institute and the Forever Family Foundation and m also a professional magician and mentalist So ve got the other side of things covered as well Written a whole bunch of books what else would you like me to talk about Bill Thats it can keep going if you want No thats good He just told us the coolest stuff think what led me into parapsychology was mystery so d watch shows like the Twilight Zone and One Step Beyond and Topper which was probably hugely influential on me The fact is that neuroscience is going in one direction to understand consciousness other folks are going in a different direction in the sciences to understand consciousness physics goes in a different direction There is no agreed upon definition You cant rule it out until you rule out that consciousness has a presence outside the body You have those correlations you rarely ever get high magnetic field with ghosts around unless youre like getting the ghost to walk right in front of you And its the same with is the phrasing that comes through has to be very clear otherwise it really shouldnt count Sheepgoat effect is actually one of the most repeatable affects of parapsychology outside of experiences wouldnt watch a doityourself show and then go out and hang a shingle as a plumber because plumbers have to be licensed they go through journeyman training they do a lot of stuff and think that certain ghost hunters that used to be plumbers would be very upset if anybody did that He was amazing One of the locations that he brought up in the interview was the Moss Beach Distillery down along the coast have certainly favorite locations have two favorite locations One is the Moss Beach Distillery which is a restaurant ve been working with since One of the reasons its my favorite well the foods great the views great love going down there to the coast but more importantly ve had from the first time was there the ghost was cooperative Bill Angela where are we Angela We are at the Moss Beach Distillery Sean Youve got to talk to the camera Whered you go laughing Apparently its a pretty hot spot Sean Car Angela For ghosts Game off Sean Game on Thank you See my mustache No youre good They let us come in they let us film they let us do interviews They were wonderful At one point were were at dinner and my hand got so freezing cold now where m sitting to the table the Sun is jut glaring in on me and Sean couldnt feel it And then all of a sudden he did feel it and it moved around behind him to his back and had left me So we went downstairs and we were able to get an interview and film and we tried to do an session but its a restaurant obviously with music and things and that really wasnt going so well but we were able to talk to some people and get their experiences with the blue lady We were filming the hostess And she told stories of electrical happenings in that area and how things light up And both of the boys cameras just drained My battery and his battery was full when we got here barely been filming When we were setting up put a brand new full battery in and in the short time we were inside Completely drained batteries We go upstairs right by the entrance dead But also love the Hornet thats another the aircraft carrier do love going there as well because theres a lot of ghost there So now under the guidance of his majesty professor Loyd Aeurbach We learned some things We were going to use this newly received knowledge to go out and conduct a proper investigation We learned that the last thing we should be doing is investigating like every other ghost show on television scary music electric screaming The ghost shows from entertainment perspective if you like that if you find them entertaining thats what theyre supposed to be Theyre supposed to be entertaining If you find them entertaining great if you are watching them to learn your craft get a life Dont film with the lights off Because no one in science does an investigation in the dark That came straight out of that was because of Sony Nightshot cameras if it were not nightshot cameras ghost hunters would not be working in the dark guaranteed Its important to work with a psychic d work with a really good medium or psychic and have them have a direct conversation than maybe get out of five hours of audio two things that dont do anything for me With any type of paranormal investigation totally agree that you should have if not one psychic medium sensitive or clairvoyant you should have multiple Our current technology is not advanced to such a degree that we can pick up all of the different types of energies from these beings from these ghosts psychic is somebody who can be intuned question can hear can feel can sense they come from a sixth sense and often even as seventh sense Clairvoyants simply put is clear vision Clairvoyants have an ability to see internally within the minds eye the third eye its often called Sensitive can oh my they can sense the most subtle shifts and change in their bodies with their environments and when you have the interaction of spirits and ghosts around a sensitive it is amazing what they can experience But from my personal perspective believe almost every human is psychic or has a sixth sense And often we are blind to it Bill Angela whats today Its my birthday Sean And where are we We are in the tenderloin Sean Did you witness anything good last night was talking to a prostitute saw some drug deals go down a lady was removed from the building across the street by an ambulance She was in a wheelchair and she was wearing a wedding dress maids costume Then were going to go investigate the San Leandro train depot both Yay Sean And are we going to have a special guest with us today We are going to have a special guest his name is Karl Fisher My name is Karl Fisher work on the Hornet in Alameada California during paranormal tours Hes one of Loyd Aeurbacks students Hes a sensitive hes going to join us out there for his spidey sense Sean m so excited m excited too Sean And all of your birthday So we get to the train depot we get to look around and kind of scope things out ourselves before Karl shows up Karl gets there and we start asking him basically how he does what he does or the things that he feels and prepares for before going into an investigation definitely feel anxiety felt anxiety since left the house and then felt pretty good when was standing out front talking to you guys but as we talked about coming in and stuff definitely have the in my chest and thats a huge sign for me That particular depot in San Leandro California when you go into that area think first and foremost most people will be aware of the energy of the historical vibes that are coming from that location first and foremost There are also if you get quiet enough in that area you can hear people talking as if theyre still living in a different time and so it makes one wonder about certain theories of time continuing and that the early s is still existing at this very moment as we experience the year would feel that theres definitely a residual imprint here for sure So we grab our cameras and now that we are armed with our trusty sensitive bill Karl kind of walked around and showed us how things work What item will give him a feeling or something that somebody has worked off of personally handwritten note these are all things that give him feeling We head through the building go to the back and start doing some work The first thing that happened changed our minds to the point of changing our minds on a lot of things The footsteps Te footsteps Loud footsteps that everybody on the crew Angela Bill myself and Carl heard The camera was focused on Karl as he was talking Theyre feeding off of your energy As we were filming we heard somebody walking up High spontaneous peaks of energy thats like thats helping them combust and like be able to break through you know Bill Thats really interesting like that m the first one to react to the footsteps look down the hallway to see if anybodys coming ask if anyone hears that Then be able to break through be able to break through Bill Thats really interesting like that All what do you want us to do listen m super excited about this partially because weve never done this Angela We did whats that It was so distinct that actually stopped my camera and turned to look to see who was there And nobody ended up being in the hallway Sean just went up front you heard it heard footsteps too Sean heard footsteps right here in the hallway Yeah Sean Shes been sitting up in the front corner Did you hear footsteps Yeah did Sean They were right here thought she was right here Angela thought they were right here Are you serious Sean Yeah There was just somebody walking right there Sean And just got massive chills right there Well just got massive chills the thought of now have them Angela Because you heard it right heard somebody walking right there We went outside onto the boardwalk to try and recreate those footsteps Bill What are you going to do right now Okay well we all just heard footsteps clear as day walk right up to us to the point where Angela actually stopped and said was that Teresa went up front to see if that was Teresa Teresas still sitting in the front corner of the entrance room Now m going to do outside and walk the entire length of the patio and see if it sounds the same Bill All right so theres your problem This is exactly where we would have heard the footsteps and there is your motion sensor light So if there was somebody walking out here the light would have gone off dont know when we first got here didnt feel anything and now m just ooh Karl It definitely sounded more like distinct like that for sure heard it to thought somebody was right here Sean So did So what are you feeling right now You still feeling Do we talk about when heard you talk when you werent talking Sean Yeah it uh What What did you say didnt say anything Bill comes up behind me and swear to God on my childrens life hear him talk and say something behind me as if hes trying to whisper and get my attention What did you say didnt say a word You really did just hear something Yeah you just said something laughing are you serious Yeah Are you still recording this Joe m holding a recorder shes holding a recorder the camera obviously has a recorder Sean Yeah What did you say m standing here listening to you she just turned around to me and she goes what what did you say she swore just said something You did Of all three of those recording devices Bills was the only one that didnt catch the voice that heard It maybe that a couple of people starting seeing or having an experience in the house and the disbeliever will actually block their experience psychological When we talk about hallucinations we always think about seeing things that are not there Thats what people think about for hallucinations But the late Harry Blackstone Jr pointed out there a negative hallucination and that is not seeing things that are in fact there And he wasnt necessarily even talking about paranormal stuff You put something down on the table for a moment and its gone and your perception somebody else can see it but you cant we are not seeing with our eyes we are seeing with out brains Thats perception so just because your eyes sees it doesnt mean your brain is gonna see it And you can have the most powerful ghost in the universe appear in front of people even create an image thats reflecting light which is not whats happening theyre connecting mind to mind But even if they did that the disbeliever could block that image completely and not see it Because they dont want to believe its there So apparently something got you want to turn the camera towards Sean Angela Oh thats scary though Bill Sean what just happened Is there anything honey is there anything Karl He has some red marks on his neck Angela Well hes also injured Something just ticked my neck Uhuh you dont have anything dont know So if theres somebody here with us right now sense ve walked in this room feel a strong male presence and obviously he feels something too so if theres somebody here can you try and make yourself apparent to us You can light his meter up All you have to do is get near it Were not here trying to invade your space or bother you or anything like that We just want to talk to you and we want to know why youre here Do you feel any different right now Do you want to try going upstairs and see Sean Yeah we can go upstairs Karl Lets go up there So these people are here filming a documentary so if you have a story or any unfinished business nows your time to talk to us Angela Is that you that heard whisper thought it was Bill talking behind me while you whisper Yeah thank you So do you work here or did you work here so are you angry ve heard people say that theyve got Ps of swearing is that you cursing and swearing Bill If it wasnt you is there somebody else here thats swearing Was that a yes or a no Is there more than one person here with us right now Do you hear that knock too with that Bill Yeah just heard a loud breath Whoop Why are you doing there All right allow me to you want me to do this now Okay the mel meter is an intelligent microprocessor based instrument specifically designed for paranormal investigations It was built by paranormal investigators for paranormal investigators It has a built in radiating detector and a flash light basically its the iPhone of paranormal ghost hunting technologies Its designed for quick captures of key readings with the ability to quickly record and clearly display the correlation of and temperture change in the surrounding area Its the only device capable of doing this However there is no scientific evidence that the Mel Meter detects any paranormal activity Are we done now Karl You want to try talking with the flashlight We were getting numerous hits off the When we began the flashlight experiment that was one of the most interesting things that we saw People are really skeptical about this do this on the ship a lot it seems to be a very easy way of them being able to communicate As with everything its just nobody really knows whats going on It could be us making psychic impressions and willing things to happen So if youre here talking with us and youre the person making the light up can you try to turn that flashlight off If thats easier Okay Angela think that its really funny Hes like think hes really funny can you turn the flashlight off Yeah can turn the flashlight off very easily Thank you so much And this went on for five or ten minutes We asked a question a light will turn on We ask it to turn on or off it would turn off the would go it was actually pretty entertaining Angela Do you want to try and communicate to us and talk to us we cant hear you with our ears and still hear you possibly on these recorders when we listen to them later But then as we moved away from that and we started talking about other things the light still seemed to flash periodically and the kept going Karl Around and wanting willing these things to happen right now but random surges it doesnt seem like its consistent with a situation like this where were asking questions and were getting responses Sean If this place is important to you can you turn the flashlight back off Thank you Thats what m talking about If it was random like wouldnt it be happening while we just sat here having conversations too laughing told you think hes really funny Was it just by chance was it somebody still trying to get our attention But the number of times that it happened led me to believe that something was actually going on Moving right across down here as keep walking and hitting the stairway and came up m nothing just a big ball of light Flash or consistent dont get the impression of an angry person get the impression of an old working class male Sean Thats awesome You think hell come back sometime Yeah definitely think the more and more people dont get the impression that he doesnt want to communicate think that sometimes you go places and you can kind of tell that theyre angry and its annoying to them But the impression get off of that and the general feelings get is the guy seems like he would be a friendly individual and open to people people coming here and trying to communicate with him The one thing that made me believe that we were actually having a paranormal experience didnt happen until after the investigation Angela and realized we were so exhausted so extremely exhausted it was almost to the point of sickness Bill So anyway talk to me for a second That was crazy every bit of energy is drained out of my body feel like could fall down right now And cant even think right now am completely drained completely drained like a battery Can you unlock the car please so can Bill What do you think Yeah just feel super drained like just said Bill The lights the ghost just made the lights go on on the car behind you Oh think it was really interesting in the very beginning when we were asking if youre the one who made the footsteps turn the light on the light went on Are you the on who touched Sean light went on Are you the one who heard whisper behind me when thought it was Bill and was kind of going on with that question and it waited until was done with that question and then it turned on so that was pretty great was just getting really tingly and then just sucked the life out of me Bill still have a lot of energy Which led us to believe that Bill is in fact a ghost really do think the footprint thing the footstep thing is something The flashlight thing and the what was it called the meter Angela Yeah the mel meter Bill That thing was just going off to randomly go off So anyway it could have just been a ghost trying to talk to us did feel very staticky when ask to take me energy felt like not hair was actually raising but you know when you walk in a room and you feel just static felt that but the mind is a pretty powerful thing So anyway Angela This mic is making an amazing shadow on you right now It is where Thats it thats all have just not sure that we saw anything But it was really cool well anyway thats it happy music laughing loudly So its been a few months have been editing like a mofo trying to get this movie done reexamining footage seeing things that cant explain As youve probably all ready seen cause we put them in this movie That you know we got some interesting stuff At the beginning was nothing but excited and amped and hyped and thrilled to be a part of it That has not changed From when we started until now honestly do believe a little bit more in ghosts screaming think m more skeptical of evidence from ghost sightings from our investigations meowing But believe less in ghost hunting techniques and ghost hunting equipment that ve seen on ghost shows and ghost documentaries restaurant chatter Did we get a ghost dont know Sean Oh look its me eating again The best piece of advice can give to somebody going to hunt ghosts is just to follow your instincts because really thats the best thing we have believe in ghosts more since we started this project Which is almost impossible because the amount believed in ghost when we started this project was completely believed Now its not just a belief now know believe in ghost the same wouldnt say that believe in ghosts more and wouldnt say that believe in ghosts less The one thing do believe is peoples desire to see ghosts is more than thought And if you want to see a ghost youre going to see a ghost And if you want to have your explanation be paranormal then thats what its going to be also at the same time believe that if youre so closedminded as somebody like me you might miss that ghost which is right in front of your face Lets go really think that it comes down to trusting your senses and your own personal experiences over all the technology So a few places that would love to investigate Waverly Sanitarium its that scary d like to work our way across the country and end up on the east coast and culminate the holy grail of all haunted places Europe think out next film should be aliens Thats an easy one m coming after bigfoot You know dont think its the role of science in general to make people believe in anything for that matter It is the role of science to provide the evidence and let people decided for themselves to a point The idea is to come up with a preponderance of evidence to show that there really is an effect here and to try to find some explanation for it dont think that theres anything if a true skeptic a doubter not a disbeliever because a lot of people call themselves skeptics when in fact theyre total true disbelievers Were never going to convince the true disbeliever never The true disbelievers are only going to find out if theres life after death when they die Okay Now you see me Now you dont Now you se me now you dont And if you dont believe me Think m a ghost of your imagination Then keep hide and seeking And ll just stay along ll just play along m not only in my dreams But the way it seems thats the way it seems haunt you in your sleep So you can think youre crazy And seeing things And seeing things Now you see me Now you dont Now you see me Now you dont m not only in your dreams But thats the way it seems thats the way it seems haunt you in your sleep So you can think youre crazy And seeing things And seeing things And seeing things And seeing things And seeing things mess with your mind So you question what you find yeah If you dont believe me Think m a ghost of your imagination And keep hide and seeking And ll play along ll jut play along And ll just play along And ll just play along And ll just play along ll just play along And ll just play along ll just play along ll just play along And ll just play along
