m gonna end up regretting something when this is over no matter what do The only thing that bugs me more than when Beth shares secrets Is when Beth is right This is a decision have to come to myself cant just ride this out and accept the default answer Predictable doesnt always mean boring Lust doesnt always mean love Near doesnt always mean close New doesnt always mean exciting Different doesnt always mean better Far doesnt always mean distant Knowing everything doesnt make you wise Knowing the truth doesnt make you superior Knowing your problem doesnt solve It Sitting between your past and your future doesnt mean youre in the present What did you think Sucks Yeah m leaving Going home When Now What do you mean now Now like this minute cant be here Please dont go dont want you to Yeah

friends again not because we are but because we actually like each other There are even times when dont mind being able to see through all the bullshit mean what the hell am supposed to do you know It is what it is And there are a lot of liars out there Now m just starting to do something about It Same thing Whatever Those stupid words that Kevin said to me that night managed to drive a spear right through the middle of my entire world view What if theres no black and white in this world no good and no evil no right and no wrong What if there are no lies and no truth What may be a lie to one person may be completely true for another Beth tells me this is called relativism dont know Sounds like an word to me All know is my headaches gone my friends seem to like me again and well m happy
