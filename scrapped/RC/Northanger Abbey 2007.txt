Ibaptisethee Catherine in the name ofthe Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost Noone who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be a heroine Her situation in life the character of her father and mother and her own person and disposition were all equally against her family of ten children of course will always be called a fine family where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number But the Morlands were in general very plain and Catherine for many years of her lifeas plain as any Neither was it very wonderful that Catherine who had by nature nothing heroic about her should prefer cricket and baseball to dolls and books But by the age of appearances were mending Catherine Morland was in training for a heroine Yes Whoo Whoo You knowour Catherine has turned out rather well Come on Catherinelets carry on No later Later Shes quite a goodlooking girl Well she is almost pretty today And she has grown very fond of reading of late

with Udolpho ve just got to the black veil The black veil wont tell you whats behind it not for the world When you have finished it you will read The Monk my brothers favourite Oh yes he spoke of it Is it really very horrid It is the most horrid shocking thing in all the world Ambrosio the Monk begins very holy but is drawn into vice by Matilda She gives him a magic branch so he can pass through walls and into Antonias bed chamber But it is too shocking should blush to tell youYou must read it yourself The Friar pronounced the magic words and a thick smoke arose over the magic mirror At length he beheld Antonia s lovely form She was undressing to bathe herself and the amorous monk had full opportunity to observe the voluptuous contours and admirable symmetry of her person as she drew off her last garment At this moment a tame linnet flew towards her nestled its head between her breasts and nibbled them in wanton play Ambrosio could bear no more The blood boiled in his veins and a raging fire rushed through his limbs l must possess her he cried No no Ambrosio shall no longer be able to combat my passions am convinced with every moment that have but one alternative must enjoy you or die Der Holle Rache from The Magic Flute Damn finelooking woman But shes nothing to you you know Miss Morland Mrs Allen Mr Allen Mr Tilney you must have thought me so rudebut they told me you had gone out When saw you begged Mr Thorpe to stopbut he only went faster If only he had slowed down would have jumped out and run back to you Please believe me would ten thousand times rather have been with you Are you and Miss Tilney very angry with me must confess felt a little slighted But my sister was quite sure there was some misunderstanding Eleanor you were right as usual Miss Morland is not to blame She was abducted by force No not exactly but truly did try to make him stop Dont tease her You were cast down when you thought she preferred the company of others Perhaps she still does No indeed That is Then may renew our invitation Shall we say the day after tomorrow for our walk Yes Miss Catherine Morlanda very amiable girl and very richtoo Ward of a Mr Allen who made a fortune in trade And with noone to spend it on but her shell bring a deal of money to her marriage When the old man pops off shell be one of the richest women in the country Obliged to you sir Thorpe John Thorpe Delighted to have been Yes it was beautifully sung Mr Thorpe perhaps youd introduce me to the young lady Miss Morland this is General ilney Charming And did overhear a country walk proposed Yes sir the day after tomorrow Perhaps you would do us the honour of spending the rest of the day with us after your walk If Mr and Mrs Allen can be persuaded to spare you m sure theyd be happy to spare me sir and d have great pleasure in coming Excellent shall look forward to making your better acquaintance Miss Morland Ooh What do you think Catherine Its wonderful It reminds me of the South of France The Languedoc you know Yes Have you travelled much in France No Not at all ve never been there But ve seen pictures And its just as Mrs Radcliffe describes it in Udolpho Ah Mrs Radcliffe But suppose you dont read novels read Udolpho straight through in two days with my hair standing up on end the whole time often think theres more life and truth and feeling in a good novel than in a hundred dull sermons Do you really believe that Oh go on dont wait for me Why should you think dont believe it Because think you like to tease me And because the real world is different from the world in stories Is it Of course it is love to read Mrs Radcliffe but dont think the real worlds full of murders and abductions and ghosts with clanking chains and seductions and everything Well not in Fullerton anyway Perhaps not quite so many murders and abductions But broken hearts Betrayals Longheld grudges Schemes of revenge Fear And hatred And despair Are they not part of all of our lives Even in Fullerton dont know would like to think not Well then hope your experience of life is the exception that proves the rule Tilney Forgive me ilney for interrupting your walk ve no time to lose Of course You were expected Maam Come lets walk on a little That gentleman is a close acquaintance of ours a very good friend He is obliged to leave the country at short notice He was able to make his farewells to me last evening but was no doubt anxious to say goodbye to my sister too before he left see There is no reason why the matter should come up But my sister and would be very grateful if you did not mention to my father that we saw that gentleman here today No of course Thank you The Monk reeled from the unholy sight Receive this talisman she replied While you bear this every door will fly open and walls will melt away It will procure you access tomorrow night to Antonia s bed chamber Miss Morland Nothing to be ashamed of Its all Gods creation Come Catherine Catherine absolutely knew the second you came to the house could tell And the way you spoke to my mother could justIt was almost like fate Catherine No no sit down Can you guess Your brother has made me the happiest girl on Earth You mean you and James Are in love He confessed as much to me this afternoon And you know my nature could never trifle with a mans affections In short told him his love was returned Catherine Hes waiting downstairs know neednt ask whether you approve Catherine No indeed Though am surprised It has all happened so quickly Not so believe have been in love with your friend since the first time set eyes on her And l The very first day he came to us last Christmas the very first moment remember wore this yellow gown My hair was up in braids am come to say goodbye Catherine am going straight to Fullerton to seek our parents consent Ah Morland there you are Miss Morland too must take my leave for the present just for the present m going to accompany James to Fullerton and then onto town to help him choose a ring Perhaps might look for one for myself while m there Do you think should famous good thing this marrying scheme What do you think of it think its a very good thing too m so pleased to hear you say that Did you ever hear the old song going to one wedding brings on another Perhaps you and might try the truth of that shall think of you when m in town Come on James we must tear ourselves away Go Go perhaps forever Isabella Whatever do you mean Your mother and father what will they say m sure theyll be very happy for James But my fortune will be so small How could they consent to it Your brother who might marry anybody wouldnt think the difference in fortune would be anything to signify Oh My sweetest Catherine in your generous heart m sure it would not matter at all But mustnt expect everyone to think the same only wish our situations were reversed If had the command of millions if were mistress of the whole world your brother would still be my only choice Now Catherineyou know m only here for your sake You know my heart is miles away And as for dancing dont mention it beg you It is quite out of the question dare say Charles Hodge will plague me to death about it But shall cut him very short can tell you wonder where he is Its General Tilney do believe hes coming to talk to you Miss Morland Delightful You will excuse me now Excellent Miss Morland allow me to introduce my brother Captain ilney Charmed Dont let my brothers ill manners offend youThats how he is m afraid He was illmannered as a baby m surprised at you being so disrespectful to your older brother How could you know what he was like as a baby When he was a baby you were not yet born True enough My mother told me of it hope youre not already engaged for the next dance No indeed My rival having left Bath lndeed he is not You mustnt tease me So do you not know Mr Thorpe at all No not at all Thats strange He seems to know a great deal about your family And none of it to our credit Well have always found that ignorance and prejudice hold no bar to forming the strongest of opinions You think him ignorant and prejudiced know he doesnt always tell the truth but he has been very kind to me You think he isnt to be trusted Dear Miss Morland has it not occurred to you that might not be the best person to consult on the matter of Mr Thorpe My lords ladies and gentlemen the next dance will be On Summers Day Good God Henry Youre not going to stand up in that maul are you certainly am That being so do you think your friend might dance with me No am sorry know for certain that she has a very particular reason not to dance tonight Is that so Pity Music starts Why are you smiling Look there dont wonder at your surprise refused him for as long as possibly could but he would not take no for an answer Hes the eldest son you know the heir to Northanger Abbey Not that that weighs anything with me am in love with the best man in the whole world Did you think him handsome Who Captain Tilney silly Oh Yes very handsome But didnt your brother say he was very bad As bad as Lord Byron Oh John will say anything that comes into his head hardly ever take any notice of him But then how is one to know what to believe One thing you can be certain of my affection For you and your dear dear brother Catherine Catherine help me for Gods sake You have heard from James And my parents have consented Yes your father has been very good James is to have a living worth a year as soon as he is old enough to take it But that wont be for another two years so we must wait that long before we marry It seems it wasnt possible for your father to do anything for us immediately m sure Mr Morland has behaved vastly handsome If he finds he can do more by and by dare say he will And lsabellas wishes are so moderate For myself its nothing never think of myself But poor James a year is hardly enough for the common necessaries of life But suppose everybody has the right to do what they like with their own money am very sure that my father has promised as much as he can afford But Mr Allen was sure would do something for James Perhaps he does not approve of his choice of bride Why should Mr Allen do anything for James Or for any of us It was very kind of Mr and Mrs Allen to bring me to Bath but none of us has any expectations from Mr Allen My dear sweet Catherine you know care nothing for money If we could only be married tomorrow would be happy to live on a year But thats the sting Thats why you find me so cast down The two years we must wait before dear Morland can have the living Catherine How will endure it can well understand how she feels Two years is a long time But at least she can marry the man she loves Not everyone is so fortunate No suppose not How sad that is Yes it is But how many couples marry for love believe my mother and father love each other even more than they love us and they love us very much When was a little girl used to think it was like that for everyone It was only when started to read novels that realised it was not shouldnt have thought one would have to read novels to find that out think you have had quite a dangerous upbringing Dangerous How Well its as Henry says Youve been brought up to believe that everyone is as pure in heart as you dont think m very pure in heart Really Why have the most terrible dreams sometimes Whats the joke Nothing to concern you love our walks think should like to stay in Bath forever and go walking with you every day Unfortunately that wont be possible Oh Our father told us this morning hes determined on quitting Bath by the end of the week Oh Miss Morland Capital Excellent Can you Miss Morland be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige us with your company at Northanger Abbey Northanger Abbey Well Miss Morland what do you say am very honoured sir If Mr and Mrs Allen agree should be delighted to accept Northanger Abbey Arent you frightened to go there on your own confess am a little Well dare say it will be very thrilling for you But do hope you dont forget me Catherine Or our dearest John No indeed No need to be coy heard from him today that you and he are as good as engaged Indeed we are not Useless to dissemble my dear Your secrets out He says in his letter not half an hour before he left Bath you gave him positive encouragement He says he as good as made you an offer No No there must be some mistake Your brother must have misunderstood me and certainly had no idea he thought he was making me an offer Please undeceive him and beg his pardon Oh Well dare say we should all be allowed a little harmless flirtation But there was no flirtation not on my side And if noone were allowed to change their minds where would we all be Perhaps its for the best after all Isabella please understand me once and for all Sh Here he comes Who Tilney of course Oh wouldnt have this happen for the world Look away perhaps hes not seen us What always to be watched In person or by proxy Nonsense My spirit you know is pretty independent wish your heart were independent That would be enough for me My heart What can you have to do with hearts None of you men have hearts But we have eyes And they give us torment enough think Mrs Allen and your mother are expecting us Will you come lsabella You go And tell them ll follow And if shouldnt see you write and tell me all your news from Northanger Do take a care sir Whoa there Whoa Come along now Four minutes late already coming from Milsom Street m sure Miss Morland wont keep you waiting Father Oh Catherine my dear quickly they are here How grand chaise and four You never aspired to that Mr Allen No indeed Well Catherine we shall miss you Thank you for all your kindness It has been such a happy time There there my dear should be sharp about it These great folks dont like to be kept waiting Miss Morlanda thousand pardons for our late arrival My eldest son must bear the blame He stays on in Bath Now my dear Miss Morland have a proposal As it is a fine day how should you like to travel in the curricle with my sonHenry You will enjoy the air and be better able to see the country It is of course entirely up to you should like that very much Did your father say that Captain ilney stays on in Bath Yes Oh Youre disappointed You were hoping for my brothers company at Northanger perhaps No No not at all That is should have no objection to his company Then what is it Come am anxious about your brother and Miss Thorpe think he cannot know that she is engaged to my brother suppose he thinks he has a chance with her But doesnt he realise how wrong it is of him and what pain it must give to my brother dont think you should distress yourself too much Miss Morland Your brother shall be returning to Bath very soon And my brother should be leaving to rejoin his regiment And that will be the end of that Now look there Its exactly as imagined Itsjust like what one reads about Are you prepared to encounter all of its horrors Horrors Is Northanger haunted then Oh thats just the least of it Dungeons and sliding panels skeletons strange unearthly cries in the night that pierce your very soul And vampires Dont say vampires could bear anything but not vampires Miss Morland do believe youre teasing me now But if were to say there is a kind of vampirism No lets just say that all houses have their secrets and Northanger is no exception Let me help you down Thank you Miss Morland welcome to Northanger Abbey hope you will be comfortable Do please beg you make as little alteration to your dress as possible My father is most particular about meal times m sorry to have to ask you No No thats quite all right ll see you in a few minutes then If you please Miss ilney says do you need any help miss Oh no No thank you Are you ready So sorry Miss Morland Charming Dinner should be on the table directly hope you find our simple style of living to your taste Miss Morland No doubt you have been used to bettersized apartments at Mr Allens No indeed sir Mr Allens dining parlour is only half the size of this room Well now suppose care as little as any man for such things but a tolerablylarge eating room is one of the necessaries of life Hmm Tolerably large indeed sir But dont think ve ever been in so large a dining room as this one You have not Well no doubt the rooms in Mr Allens are exactly the true size for rational happiness Oh Oh why What Whatever are these old things No No leave them please Shirts stockings cravats Laundry lists This was my mothers favourite place used to walk so often here with her Though never loved it then as have loved it since Her death must have been a great affliction great and increasing one What was she like Did she look like you wish could show you her portrait It hangs in her private chamber suppose you were with her to the last No was away from home when she died Her illness was sudden and short and before arrived it was all over So you didnt see her body No wish could have done Perhaps it would help me to think of her at peace Yes should like to see her room if you are willing to show me We never go there It is my fathers wish But to see her picture Yes Why should you not see it What do you do there was going to show Miss Morland Mothers There is nothing to interest Miss Morland in this part of the house am surprised at you Eleanor My dearest lsabella long to hear your news hope everything is well with you and James and that your brother is not too much offended with me Northanger Abbey is all that expected it to beand Eleanor and her brother very kind Oh lsabella fear that this house holds a terrible secret relating to the death of Mrs Tilney Catherine Here am cannot write more now Send me your news your loving friend Catherine This is a sad day Miss Morland sad day for me that is have to go up to town for several days on business trust youll be able to entertain our guest properly while am gone Nothing would give me greater pleasure sir Come along What are you giggling about One for me Henry This is the last one Ooh Ah thought might show you Woodston tomorrow if youd like to Its nothing to Northanger of course just a country vicarage But m very fond of it d love to Look Is that your home Its lovely m very glad you think so fear we may be about to get a little damp Come on ll race you back Come on Come on Look at the state of the pair of you ll go and get Richards to draw your bathCatherine When we were coming to Northanger Abbey you said that the house held secrets Did l And have you discovered any dreadful revelations yet No but d like to know what you meant think that shall have to remain a secret secret once explained loses all of its charmsand all of its danger too Why dont you imagine the worst thing you can and write your own Gothic romance about it Northanger Abbey would make a very good title dont you think Now youre mocking me But cant help feeling that this house is not a happy one Not since our mother died And even before then envy you your happy childhood My brother Frederick is well enough thinksowing his wild oats but soon he shall have to make an advantageous match My sister is not happy Remember the man we met on our country walk He is a good friend of minebut he is a lot more than that to my sister But our father has refused to sanction the match Edward is only a second son And Eleanor must marry the heir to a rich estate And And you Well if m to retain my fathers favour must marry a fortunetoo And shall you always hoped d be lucky that the girl fell in love with would come with a fortune attached Andif she should not Then that would be a very stern test of my character Perhaps wed better head back want to set off for Woodston before nightfall See you tomorrow for dinner Oh Might ask how you come to be here all alone wanted to see your mothers room Eleanor was going to show me but your father prevented us And so you thought youd come and see it for yourself Yes suppose Eleanor has talked to you about our mother Yes But that is not very much What she did say was Her dying so suddenly and none of you being at home thought perhaps your father had not been very fond of her And from these circumstances you infer some negligence Or something even worse Then let me reassure youCatherine My mothers illness was sudden and Eleanor was from home but was here throughout And so was my brother Frederick Our mother received every possible attention Our physician was satisfied that nothing more could be done for her The matter was deeply distressing as you may imagine Yes of course But your father was he distressed For a time greatly so She had had to bear a great deal from him but when she was dead he felt her loss am very glad of it It would have been very shocking if he had if he had If he had what If understand you rightly you have been suspecting my father of a crime so dreadful You said yourself the house was full of secrets And so you decided that my father must be a murderer when to you at least he has shown nothing but kindness Catherine how could you What sort of a fevered imagination must you have Perhaps after allit is possible to read too many novels Look Catherine Oh whatever is the matter cant tell you Please dont make me have been so wickedly foolish and your brother knows of it And now he will hate me for it and so will you when he tells you Oh my dear Catherine m quite sure that nothing you could do could make me hate you or Henry either saw his face know He will never ever respect me again Come come Perhaps its not as bad as you think Look here is a letter for you It will be from lsabella Oh No it is my brothers handwriting Dear Catherine think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me No shall not enter into particulars They would only pain you more You will soon hear enough to know where the blame lies am ashamed to think how long bore it Dear Catherine hope your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes his engagement known Captain Tilney

Mother Catherines back Shes back These great men can be very strange and sudden in their behaviour Well we must live and learn And the next new friends you make hope will be better worth keeping than the ones you made at Bath No friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor And Mr Tilney is not to blame Such a pleasant agreeable young man thought him He found us a chairyou know And he understands muslin ever so well Thats greatly to his credit m sure But has he written Has he offered any kind of explanation No Well dare say theres no harm done in the end You did very well to manage that journey all on your own Catherine You always used to be such a scatterbrained little creature m quite proud of you Indeed am not proud of myself What was the Abbey like Was it very scary Were there ghosts It was very big and strange with lots of empty rooms and secret passages And did think there might be ghosts But there werent any ghosts really People who read too many stories imagine all sorts of horrid things about ghosts and murders It is very wrong of them to do so and it can get you into serious trouble So let me not hear of any of you being so silly Now what else would you like to hear about What games did you play Um We played Spy and charades We went horseriding and got ourselves very muddy indeed Was Mr Tilney very handsomeCathy Yes think so Very handsome and very kind and everything he should be Do you love Mr ilney Cathy No of course not Dont talk such nonsense Nowinto your beds all of you Thats it Nightnight Cathy Gl Night Cathy What did you do to make them send you home Cathy Did you do something very naughty Come on back into your bed Cathy What is it did love him do love him Now shall never see him again and it is all my own fault Ten men ran to the fen to get Ben Very good Cathy Cathy Cathy Its a man on a white horse Go and tell Mama that Mr Tilney is here Mr Tilney Now Go on boys In you go quickly Its Mr Tilney Hes here am so ashamed of what said what thought No it is who should apologise Theres nothing you have said that can justify the way you were treated But you were angry with me and rightly so was angry with you but that is long past Your imagination may be overactive But your instinct was true Our mother did suffer grievously and at the hands of our father Do you remember spoke to you of a kind of vampirism Yes Perhaps it was stupid to express it sobut we did watch him drain the life out of her with his coldness and his cruelty He married her for her money you see She thought it was for love It was a long time until she knew his heart was cold No vampires no blood The worst crimes are the crimes of the heart But it was stupid and wicked of me to think such things as did Cathy Mama says will you bring Mr Tilney to the drawing room Come on Mrs Morland after what has happened have little right to expect a welcome at Fullerton You had no part in what happened Mr Tilney And Catherine is as you see her no harm done Any friends of our children are welcome here Shall we agree to say no more about it You are very good Er Are Mr and Mrs Allen now at Fullerton They are sir should like to pay my respects Perhaps Miss Morland might show me the way But you can see their house from the window Hush Lucy m sure Catherine will be happy to show youMr Tilney He thought was rich It was Thorpe who misled him at first Thorpe who hoped to marry you himself He thought you were Mr Allens heiress and he exaggerated Mr Allens wealth to my father You were only guilty of not being as rich as you were supposed to be For that he turned you out of the house thought you were so angry with me you told him what you knew which would have justified any discourtesy No the discourtesy was all his have broken with my father Catherine may never speak to him again What did he say to you Let me instead tell you what said to him told him that felt myself bound to you by honour by affection and by a love so strong that nothing he could do could deter me from From what Before go on should say theres a pretty good chance hell disinherit me fear may never be a rich man Catherine Please go on with what you were going to say Will you marry me Catherine Yes Yes will Yes To begin perfect happiness at the respective ages of and is to do pretty well Catherine and Henry were married And in due course the joys of wedding gave way to the blessings of a christening The bells rang and everyone smiled Noone more so than Eleanor whose beloveds unexpected accession to title and fortune finally allowed them to marry leave it to be settled whether the tendency of this story be to recommend parental tyranny or reward filial disobedience
