Supreme Court Kazuya Soga get out here Griffin Unit ten minutes to airstrike Eagle clear Griffin Unit Fox negative ten minutes to airstrike Griffin Unit Griffin here Roger that ten minutes to airstrike Its clear Tossing hand grenade Wait Theyve got hostages Request support We hereby issue the final verdict on defendant Kazuya Soga It is evident that the defendant committed crimes against humanity during the fighting in Qhardistan Therefore this war crimes court hereby sentences Strange Why am awake when everyone else is sleeplearning Lend me that clever little brain of yours Who are you Who is that updating my synchronization You and me Huh Were doing this to clear our names and Colonel Sogas Get the module into the vehicle Its a secret Last night all of Public Securitys systems went down for just seconds Mistake Error Hacking Were investigating But theres a possibility that this one Logicoma synched with something Something want you to find out what and how its related to the system going down What freak would bother accessing an Al with an outdated neurochip not to mention a conveyer that can only walk and talk In any case were leaving the others off and isolating this one d like you to investigate it too In other words youre worried it was an inside job All right ll use a civilian facility would have liked to go to an independent squad with this Still looking for the perfect personnel It is my team intend to take care People can get addicted to the carefree consultant life Or are you waiting to form it until its a higher priority for the brass If you want the squad to last dont get overly ambitious Your parallel commands are randomized Is there a point to that Its best for our learning Its outside my system standards Can you explain the data you received verbally Um feel like it was something really important see it was completely integrated Whoever did this theyre good feel sort of fluttery Theres no record of the infiltrator Not only were you fully integrated you got yourself bitten by false memories too got bitten Precious experience points Bingo Wow that was inside me m amazing Yeah yeah They really are good m saying that for a soldier killing your own countrymen is as low as you can sink Whats this Were doing it to prove our innocence and the colonels Just get the module traffic control error What what what Logicoma Sheesh Why is everyone suddenly crazy Motoko Kusanagi Kusanagi The major with the Pretty sure shes independent now Call in all deployed personnel as reinforcements An assault Its raining militarygrade bullets They took advantage of a traffic control error Assuming you arent setting me up send backup The attackers are battle cyborgs One of them is Batou the sleepless eye What found a strange code in the data planted in the Logicomas So thats their objective Put the Logicoma in selfdefense mode ll have backup there in fifteen minutes Fifteen The traffic network is being taken over Report Domination expanding throughout the city Well hurry up and stop it We dont have enough processing speed Huh Penetration increasing Defensive advance ineffective Locking down the airport now We have a malfunction in the new control system cause unknown Divert all flights to surrounding airports Flight the airport is Send those with extra fuel furthest away Shut down due to a crash Tell Tokyo Control to return all landing planes to Both airtraffic control and the new street traffic system are affected of the street system has been taken over by an outside operator This is crazy what enormous system is our hacker using Major fifteen minutes will be a problem Youre joking This isnt an error Its a crime Largescale domination Who has a system like that Give me weapons Why are you empty was being inspected Guess ll set up an ambush You hear that Borma Get it done in ten minutes Dont let Public Security use the deparallelizing code Borma You bitch Whered they get that crap The range of domination is still expanding you know The only solution is to get the module Who are you Youve been spying on me since left Public Security To ask for your help want you to trust me and hand over the conveyer recognize your voice from yesterday Yes m the one who infiltrated him And Public Securitys system going down That wasnt me That was the first move of the group using a special military module to carry out a largescale cyber operation Operation Here go Logicoma The enemy stole the modules deparallelizing code from me All could do was replicate the code and copy it to an isolationcapable they couldnt interfere with You in other words knew it do carry an incredible secret Indeed Oh dean Logicoma full speed Get us to the exit Ave aye sir Face front Aaand stop Hey Huh Huh Huh Shield Huh m not broken Whered this military module come from Its a Mass FieldHacking Unit jointly developed with seven leading companies in the old Silicon Valley Military joint production Are you an American agent m Special Forces My code name is m supporting you in hope of your cooperation Great now weve got two enemies So that agent came to take back the module But dont let her throw you All we have to do is destroy the Public Security machine and its checkmate Hows the domination coming Were close to target values We wont let em get away with anything else Get me a line and connect to the colonel This war crimes court hereby sentences Colonel Soga how dare you Who the hell are you The Administrative ViceMinister of Defense want to talk to that man ViceMinister Kasuga m flattered by your concern But create my own circumstances Excuse me Those who obstruct my Net will disappear from this city only desire one thing To make our truths known Aramaki assume youve heard of Soga Kazuya Soga the war criminal in the Qhardistan massacre correct Hes the man behind this traffic chaos Hes still connected to the Net even after we tossed him in an isolation cell Cant the great Section stop him Hes on an independent line via military satellite Wed have to open a hole in our tactical defenses either kill the line with him or shoot down the satellite Out of the question Then our hands are tied for the moment Even with all Home Affairs and civilian Als working at full capacity we wouldnt have the processing power to break his command and take back the traffic control systems They made him a scapegoat when he refused to testify in court did what could to commute his sentence But never thought hed mobilize his unit His motive is clear anyway To an honest soldier a postwar military purge is a state betrayal Well have a seat Where did his unit get those weapons The lowerranking Os are on strike right now so it wouldnt surprise anyone if a whole arsenal disappeared One last thing then Whats he after Hes demanding access to a military database called Pandora State secrets Does he mean to bring the details of an Army operation before the war crimes court Thats not all He wants to air the Armys and Public Securitys dirty laundry to the world in exchange for this citys million cars and the people in them He wants Japan itself to be judged just like he was judged Other countries would use war crimes as a pretext for all sorts of demands We might as well be under occupation again As the wars greatest losers our country would be the worlds puppet state It doesnt even bear discussing Well never give in to that demand Are you speaking on behalf of Home Affairs No But Colonel Kazuya Soga He commanded an op in Qhardistan that won him high praise Then he was accused of conducting a massacre during the op and convicted as a war criminal Hes currently in custody hero during the war and a criminal afterward And Sogas sympathizers are using the module to seek his release Major Shes an informant brought her in on a provisional basis What exactly is this module It creates processing power on the level of a giant nationwide system They must have used it to parallelize something lowcapacity in huge quantities Your opinion agree with Major Kusanagi And is your objective to retrieve the module Or destroy it The most effective method is to use the code evacuated into your Al from somewhere free of enemy interference Why was it stolen in the first place The module was a model brought here for topsecret standards sharing with Japan take it your colleagues are making a topsecret investigation of the theft ll leave that to your imagination Along with how you pinpointed the enemys smuggling point Both issues are the purview of the Administrative ViceMinister of Defense but he didnt mention them when spoke to him just now Evidently somethings being hushed up Another reason want you to tel the Ministry of Home Affairs to give my squad top priority Since when do you have a squad m about to form one Based on skill with no ranks and given top priority Bad plan Special forces teams arent mercenaries If you take advantage of a disaster for your own gain the defense world will treat you like a vulture m not interested in teams out for money or ministry bigwigs gunning for postwar concessions Tel me this How are the Home Affairs higherups Having themselves an elite panic with the Ministry of Defense Theyre afraid the public will panic if word gets out so other than a few of my units they wont order anyone to act Were the only ones who can act right now team formed on a fixed standard that will be necessary everywhere in every age So its finally taking off Whoops survived again Playing Russian roulette in a virtual reality Do you reproduce the sensation of the bullet penetrating your cranium too Youve got a sickness Kusanagi from the When did you sneak in here m independent The op in Qhardistan the American Army module and Soga Tell me what you know or take a reallife bullet Your choice Hold on Why come to me You served under Soga in Qhardistan Theres a record of lshikawa calling you on your private line Hey turned down the job with the th The pay wasnt good enough The Marines ace sniper turned into a compulsive gambler after the war Is that why your units leavetime budgets been cooked to high hell How did you know If your postwar days are about turning your life into cash ll play your game Join my spec ops team in the next five seconds or the money you embezzled gets transferred to Maritime Command Bitch ll pay you a salary The radios still up right Divert everyone before we lose the whole system So youre the Whatd she threaten you with to bring you in Oh volunteered ve been waiting for the Major to start up her team Youre a messedup guy How can you control this with the domination going on This antique has some special specifications Its in a whole different class from your friends old clunker there Since we cant cut Sogas Net well have to physically seize the module This facility is the most likely candidate for our enemys base see youll only give us our targets location You dont want to get your own hands dirty m a neat freak An old communications equipment company eh Not much for a sniper to do if theyre holed up in a server room Dont worry ll smoke out plenty of targets for you Bingo Seriously Just one squad and they get their own ground support chopper Good grief Were going Logicoma Huh But m not done with the sensors What Really Safe Youre slow Paz status Not sure whether it went well or not but m in So are we Report if you find the module Lets do this barrier maze This processing speed You people cant stop my Net In about an hour Pandoras lid will open Its impossible to stop me before then You want revenge against the country that badly m uncovering the truth The op to move the refugees in Qhardistan was the th Composite Units final mission Which was an extermination op you led No This is They were unarmed refugees Afterward a conglomerate occupied their land Someone ordered their slaughter to benefit the national interest Give me water This is the first step ll put all the nations who led the world into war in that same position Soga Youve been inf Soga This is a gap in the maze maybe How did she leave the barrier maze No she didnt Soga cant see me did manage to land in a gap An accidentprevention Al Hes parallelized all the Als in Japans traffic network That was close My barrier wont last long Lets hurry Its been three minutes since we lost contact with Major Kusanagi Call from the Ministry of Defense Do attack on the Pandora barrier began four minutes ago We cant keep up with it Sounds like it was a mistake to give Public Security free rein You invited this by carelessly stirring Soga up Major Are you all right Whats the situation Soga took over the traffic control system through the module But the threat to kill if we didnt release Pandora was fake He intends to use the vast system power hes gained to break Pandora wide open see In that case there are steps we can take You keep working to recover the module Nice timing The deal with the government should be a bluff Colonel Soga went too far This started as a plan for the ViceMinister to sell Pandora We cant survive turning the whole world against us If youve got cold feet run Nobodyll stop you Negotiate a deal or whatever sure Will If youre in this for money run without a fight Hey Home Affairs just gave us money Give it to someone who cares Were withdrawing ll buy some time The colonel didnt even wait to clear the ths name Why do you figure that is Kasuga The colonel got scapegoated Lets go ll meet up with you once ve stalled them Do it fast Paz do you read me More or less Do you know an intelligence man named lshikawa Sure do If you find him use a cable to get him to the cyber lobby Roger m hanging up before they detect our line Shit The colonels got domination but theyre still roaming free Dont underestimate me can locate even a superwizardclass hacker if they make a call during domination The Majors got business with you Let me connect you and nobody gets hurt Try it kiddo ll play with you Be a good boy and you wont get hurt You mean you wont She was playing me with that call Damn gorilla woman Who are you calling a gorilla Major Kusanagi Planning to stick me with a virus The opposite think youre already infected What Its a makeshift vaccine so youll have to put up with any bugs ve lost contact with lshikawa ll go ll take the module and go on ahead We rendezvous at the trap Roger Drive Shit You Saito Were all pros here No holding a grudge If youre a pro join the side that pays best Home Affairs paid us ll give you a triple share Take it from my account For real Lshikawa mon lets get back to guarding the module Dont move Hey lshikawa Major They all left Only one car stayed behind It didnt work Damn they pulled out already Theyve got good judgment Paz you go in s car ll go with the Logicoma Saito You transferred them money Why would you swallow the enemys bluff so easily This is the result of our negotiation with Soga We planned to put the money toward the Economic Amnesty Act but it came from vet pensions that got slashed in the Army budget cuts Do you honestly think thats what theyre after Just whose cause are we supposed to be working for here The funds will be traced and the Department of Defense is taking responsibility Our people stay out of this got it Did you check up on the enemys parallel circuitry The on board Als of million vehicles in this city are in enemy control Including my car The system is so overpowered we can hardly manage to move one chopper But there is a way to turn the tables if only temporarily Tell me Charge Here already Logicoma the tires Cut between them You take right car How can they move during our domination Here we go Paz Hes taken over my car Special specifications my ass He quit everything to focus some crazy pressure on me Its too much Lshikawa Damn gorilla womans calling Lshikawa Shit Never figured the coloneld try to brainfry me cant believe it did he really Were about to find out what the truth is have control Lshikawas cooperating with em Saito Sorry lady but they sweetened the pot Good work Saito Were almost to the trap Once we get there We win You damn gamblingfreak mercenary Huh cant see them anymore This makes no sense Where are they Five minutes to infiltration of Pandora Theres no record that ve been hacked so why did they vanish They didnt overwrite your vision Can you move lost my right arm but dont worry were still in the game So what was their trick They used our own skills to fake us out Slick of them Its an old type of optical camouflage holograph d have missed it if we werent going so slowly ll send you the location Securing the module is top priority Were out of time They figured it out Theyre damn persistent Fire Aye We cant go fast so itll take us a bit No problem Logicoma you stay there Wait until we get to you Skilled as always But youre not the only one good at infiltrating vision Major No just Major now Paz get the module fast Ten seconds to infiltration of Pandora We set up roadblocks from Wards through Do we keep going Mobilize all forces and put up as many as you can Well tie up all vehicles on board computers with accidentavoidance processes The fate of our nation is at stake feel bad for the but m going to cause the worst gridlock in thirty years Aramaki from Public Security This is his doing Paz Youre too late Sogas opening up Pandora as we speak Nope His power is down Public Securitys stopped more than of the vehicles that were in motion Both you and Colonel Soga had been deliberately infected There is no truth about that refugee transport op You killed those people and ordered an airstrike You did it because all the refugees you were trying to safeguard were armed guerillas Its the s responsibility now Either do something about him or destroy Pandora right now Obviously out of the question Because you want me to open Pandora What Dont You bastard Wait Dont shoot It was the Administrative ViceMinister who gave me the module That agents objective is the same Make sure you dont use the deparallelizing code What cant stop the infiltration This is the only way Stop gave you a copy of the vaccine Its imperfect but youll be able to tell which memories are false Its unlikely well be able to eradicate them but ll give you a hand Not interested Its the only memory that lets me feel like m not just a dog trained to kill Youre just a whiny bitch then What happened Major Its over Send a rescue squad What do you mean over Pandoras been infiltrated The datas being leaked to a different Net than Sogas Step away from the module Dont resist feel an affinity with you You who havent had a fleshandblood body for as long as you can remember You bitch That attack barrier is meaningless My brain has to be synchronized like his neurochip Youre must find out where it came from this thing which infected me and gave me true selfawareness Even if have to access the whole worlds organizations and their secrets shall Youre an artificial intelligence pretending to be human What for just have to know My Ghost whi spered that to me Ghost Huh certain intelligence agency admitted that one of its Als was infected with an unknown virus on the Net and began acting outside of their control And it absconded with the module then manipulated the ViceMinister He made too many dangerous deals during the war He intended to sell the contents of Pandora and flee the country Thats why he manipulated Soga and sent in a team of his own pawns But Soga seized control of the situation so the Al planned a recovery strategy rogue Al did it all How very convenient Even if its half true m sure they let things lie to try to profit from her Though it seems theyre not the only ones to try to profit from this Youre the one who came to me With the result that you made your team a fait accompli with the highest possible priority Want to reregister as part of Section Theyll cancel this registration if you cant get enough people together No thanks appreciate your help with the paperwork though Itll close in five minutes Decide before then Sit there and get sentenced in one of the speedtrials the system loves or join my squad You say that to everyone youve been in shooting matches with can only get people infected with the memory virus released Though those three are the ones want anyway Theyll accept that after we just picked a fight with the government If Section and a certain countrys intelligence agency testify about the false memories Lshikawa and Borma agreed As for Saito when paid him a little visit before he could go to ground he begged me to let him join Youre some piece of work So youre telling me to be Public Securitys errand boy Its an independent offensive unit based on skill with no ranks and it has top priority ll give you memories of being more than a dog trained to kill These fake memories can you really erase em can try
