thieves chased them across rocky barren land These missionaries feet were cut open by sharp stones Their clothes were torn by brambles and finally they came upon a great fortress but the Bandit King was right behind them The doctor ran up to the front door of the fortress and tried to open it But it was locked If only someone would let them in No one was there And the doctor and his wife hid but the Bandit King saw them and drew his sword There appeared to be nothing that could save Gods good people The Bandit King was after me and so hid under some straw and a blue mouse came out and scared

seizurefree When shes awake she lives between convulsions Shes been on different medications over the years Sometimes theyre so strong she doesnt recognize me Shes beautiful One doctor called her a mentalityretarded epileptic Well m here to tell you that shes not Do you really think you can help can try The left side of Cynthias brain is like a troubled kid on a playground beating up on her own twin Now you control that kid and the playgrounds at peace How do we do that Theres an operation called a hemispherectomy It involves removing the seizureprone part of the brain What How will she be able to live or survive with half a brain Its not as bad as it sounds We dont know why but a childs brain has a remarkable ability to recover Its as if the brain cells havent decided what they want to be when they grow up They take on the functions of the diseased cells and then eventually restore the neurological function You think theres a chance this will work Yes do But it is a gamble Theres no way around that If Cynthia survives she could be paralyzed on her right side The left side of the brain controls the speech area She may lose her ability to speak Have you done one of these operations yourself No have not How you feeling Wishing it were months from now Why So we can get less sleep than we do now Good night Your mother called today She sad the movers are coming in a week Shes so
