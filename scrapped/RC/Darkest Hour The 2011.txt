figure out if theyre dicking around or if its something usefu You had some questions Yes How far north from ArmadiIo can we go before the Taliban get active About m north of Armadillo From up here we can draw a line almost up to the HeImand River This area here is basicaIy ours His objective is to move south and isolate us so we cant get out and to diminish our influence on the IocaIs Thats what he wants to do Our patroIing forces him to meet us here and fight in this narrow pass These people are former mujahedeen and used to fight the Russians in the exact same area so theyre used to fighting a superiorforce Theyre not afraid Ten men might attack forty Being outnumbered doesnt stop them Not at a Theyve got big baIs Thats for sure Did you treat the ones who were kiIed and wounded in December UnfortunateIy me and were the ones who found the dead on We were first on the spot grabbed a detector and started sweeping As we went around the vehicIe the fucking beam from my headIamp

something theyre printing and they forgot about the time difference Since we Ieft Denmark the enemys objective hasnt changed The TaIibans objective is to destabiIize security in HeImand and undermine the IocaIs trust in the l forces Its important to get into Haftaran and Athakhan to establish contact with the people When you eat yourfieId rations and theres something you dont Iike l suggest you save it and bring it on patro Give it to the chiIdren as a sign of goodwi RuIes of engagement Remember that self defense can appIy prior to being fired upon Such as by confirmed weapons or peopIe

pIatoon Today was a cIose shave Anything else Have a nice day War booty Loots of war Lets start the debriefing want to get through it quickIy and get to the point Today we can estabIish that we didnt fire at each other There were many instances where we were in doubt and mistakes have happened had my doubts that the enemy was onIy m away l hear you hoIering that hes cIose by and say No In the end l was so irritated that l emptied a magazine down the stream thought that wouId be enough but you said no and thats when we threw a grenade Afterwards Signaler and l found four men groaning heaviIy in the ditch feeIing rather bad We Iiquidated them in the most humane way possibIe under a littIe bridge and we cIeaned the area and found the shooter lan mentioned He was hit and moaning He was trying to craw We shot him times We finished them off Thanks That was it lt was fucking awesome Not whiIe it was happening but when we got back Now weve been at war Now weve tried it l neverfelt that way on patrol before NormaIy its just boring But this time l thought there was a rea risk of being boxed in neverthought that before We outnumber them and have coo weapons so they cant touch us But here they couId But d still Iike to try it again One more time wouldnt Think about it When yourtour is over you feel so much better about it Yes lts true Making a difference is a coo feeling Having been up shit

dig it out Coo totally forgot about the pain because the chopperfIew Iike this dont know if you heard but Iby got four with a grenade They were moaning l dont know how many it kiIed But three of them were Iying in a pile You couId only see an ear and the left side of the head of one of them The rest was hanging off him Two of them were underneath him thought What the fuck They were on top of each other Another was under a Iog and another was farther away He was crawIing on the ground No he wasnt So we hit the jackpot in that ditch Okay guys Bye ve got two things for you You definiteIy get the Horse Thanks a lot You deserve it You fought with us and with Specia Forces Super Damn fine job Listen up was questioned by the Ps this evening ApparentIy someone called home and told their parents that we Iiquidated wounded peopIe and piIed up the dead to take pictures of ourseIves as heroes And that personaIy returned and killed some wounded Talibans People have also said that we laughed about this during our debriefing The parents or this mother has contacted Operationa Command and asked if that is how we dea with things here What bothers me the most right now is the question of IoyaIty have to know if anyone here beIieves that this is what happened Does anyone honestly believe that Yes If l had Iistened to our debriefing and the sequence of events l would have thought it was extremely deIicate couId understand if outsiders who werent there got that impression We were sti on a high afterwards You have to take that into consideration It was an extreme experience so we used extreme words If the press makes a case of this and peopIe think were psychos well let them think so They werent there they didnt see it They werent there but we know what happened Let them taIk They werent there If they make a case out of this we be suspended and then we be blowing bubbIes and thats it unti we go home And we go down in miIitary history apart from those who knew us as the guys who fucked up Anyone whos named in this case including myself Danie and Signaler can Iook forward to a Iong session with the whoIe miIitary circus l cant say You werent there man to that beIieve that Signaler and Daniel had the balls to do the right thing at the right time To proceed the way they did with two wounded one near miss and three men with hoIes in their uniform and so on To waIk up and shoot Had l seen movement wouId have fired too And it onIy took Daniel or SignaIer to point under the Iog and say One here one there That was enough for me to fIip to automatic and shoot didnt fee like sticking my head down to someone with a gun And yes it was touch and go But in my worId you do what you do If you have the strength not to shoot because you reaIise that the movement is not that of a weapon but a surrender or whatever lf you have the strength to realise this you dont shoot of course but had been there l would aIso have fired and did fire because wasnt sure That was enough for me think its hard for peopIe at home to understand how How the decision is made How you can just take a Iife You have to be here to understand it This place is whacked after a Its a fuckedup country No doubt about it People who understand the war itseIf and how you and l and others fee about being here and making a difference those people wi understand us Outsiders might sneer and say that were insane or that we did something terribIe know l did the right thing know we a did the right thing In case you dont know was questioned by Ps this morning regarding our case with the snitch So far its a matter of rumor which they try to quash at battalion Ievel So if you hear anything then dismiss it as a rumor because thats what it is So its just a lot of hot air It may come back to haunt us but it is a Iot of hot air without any truth in it Iright Thats it Good day have a few things to say today First of a ld Iike to award SiIver and GoId Horses for our recent engagement The first two are Joe and Iby Joe and Iby did something that others might fee differently about These guys did it Five TaIiban were firing at the platoon Our guys stormed them with a hand grenade and neutraIized them This takes courage and m proud of you m awarding you the GoId Horse and you both deserve it We see if it leads to more Damn fine job CongratuIations We deserved And one for you Joe CongratuIations You deserve it Give them a hand What does it say Smith is a parttime transvestite and a futime idiot Deep thoughts Not a Iot of deep stuff here The deepest was painted over The guys were a bit pissed about that Of course there was a lot of shit but theres also stuff which Which was quite coo to read And it wouId be cool to see your own stuff if you came back In the North know the fairest Iand My peopIe my home my native Iand Denmark That was quite poetic Thanks for your efforts SubtitIes Wiin HiIton Dansk Video Tekst
