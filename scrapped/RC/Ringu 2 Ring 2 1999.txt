Asakawa was after these four week after this date all of them died at the same time Hard to believe isnt it This girl Tomoko she was Ms Asakawas niece girl was with her when she died Kurahashi Masami Kurahashi What happened to her Shes in the hospital She cant speak The hospital belongs to your university The doctor cant tell you anything about patients privacy The questions should be on the area of his research Fine This way please Ms Kurahashi How are you feeling Would you like to come out to the balcony for a change Doctor wants you to get some fresh air Are you still afraid of Its fine ll bring a screen so that you wont see it Doctor theyre here Hello m Kawajiri Please Our medical files are different from others because we attach photos Do you know why In case they run away Thats right Illness can change the patient even their family cant recognise them So we always take photos when they arrive But when we took photos of this patient with our usual camera here a strange image came up Its called spirit photography Something in a persons mind affects the light and exposure There were similar cases in the past You mean this photo was We also tried just having her hold a film This shows a character clearly You may think m a strange doctor All of my colleagues do Do you know Ryuji Takayama Thats odd Hes the only one who listened to me He was once in medical school before he went in for maths You know he died What a shame You didnt even come to his funeral This way you dont have to see it No need to rush Nice and slow Take your time Whats wrong Are you feeling bad Ms Kurahashi Take her to the treatment room Tomoko Tomoko Help Help me Help her to get up Are you Help me They said it was the first time shes spoken Are you going to continue Ms Asakawas report Yes Youd better stop Why Just stop it Did the patient tell you something Wait Excuse me Youd better not tell anybody about it Such power youve got its no use to anyone Yoichi Are you Yoichi Where do you live You cant talk Go in there Its bare isnt it Please So you need to talk Do you remember a girl called Masami She was with Tomoko when she died Yes When she went near the in the hospital a strange image came on What was it well Only for an instant though Was that all Yes Youve seen it havent you Its fine if thats all youve watched But dont watch it again Masami She couldnt speak either What are you trying to say If Yoichi goes on like this What can we do then Lock him up in the hospital Its none of your business m sorry Please go Can come back again sometime to see Yoichi they cant remember recording Among those tapes they find a strange one How would you know Oh hi This Oh So you got it watched it last night What Mr Okazaki youll watch it wont you Of course will Theres no point if dont Will you

anyone Wl Al Dinners ready Go and wash your hands thought he wont speak because hes blaming me Deep down in his mind Thats not true When we came back from my dads the switched on automatically as Yoichi went near Could you talk to Dr Kawajiri about it If Yoichi is really Youve met Reiko Asakawa didnt call him Okazaki the assistant director told me about the patient He should be here any minute So Were going to try an experiment It may help the boy as well Come in This way What are you trying to do Its normal tap water The paper absorbs well about that much Do the same as before Concentrate on the water Thats enough The waters changed Some kind of energy was transferred from her to the water It also explains the film exposure Its all about energy transfer Eventually all the energy should be transferred from her The experiment is to prove it Please Are you trying to video it Yes Youve seen it right Dont do that That image of a well well Everyone who sees it dies But you look perfectly fine Get ready Oh Okazaki This is a brand new tape Could you set it up for me Masami this experiment is dangerous If people see it Theres something in my head Set the tape quick Even if there is such a video videos dont kill people Fear kills If can prove this we can eliminate the energy of fear Free the fear Go out if you dont want to watch No Lets start Do the same as with the photo film Relax and look at the camera Whats that noise That woman Doctor Ms Furuhashi Ms Furuhashi What are you doing There were a lot of calls Its a week today or something That girl with the video isnt it ll call her Goodnight See you Hello this is Kawaguchi Hello Kanae Yes Its Okazaki watched the video Oh m relieved ve been worrying You dont trust me Because its almost the time Listen you know that strange woman You mean the one in the mirror Hello Um Yes that one Didnt it look like it changed to a child for a second And the well at the end Wheres the video now threw it away Because its really No one should watch it anymore But you cant stop it Youll show it to someone wont you Mr Okazaki you have to show it dont want you to die Mr Okazaki know See you then Yeah The woman in the mirror Dl WlSl Hl Its the public demonstration by Dr Heihachiro lkuma He was fired because of the demonstration Rl Hl Rl l Shizuko Can you just will someone dead Dr lkuma talked about intention as a living thing The energy of thought itself can become substantial For example to be on the video The concentrated thoughts of years Her fury Weve all seen it Did they die just by watching the video Takayama the father of Asakawa Why she involved her father The kid must have seen it Asakawas kid Hes probably in the same condition as my patient In that case we cant leave him Where is Asakawa Tell me Hello Sanae Sanae Come with me Please This is just a routine interview so please relax Oh wait a moment Dont come Dont come Run away Cant you hear me Go run away What is it Mum Yoichi monster monster monster Murderer Monster Yoichi Yoichi Yoichi Dad Dad Didnt we save Yoichi The boy youre holding is not Yoichi anymore Yoichi Yoichi No Stop it Dont Why cant erase it Where did that story come from When people worry rumours start flying In other words people hope things will turn out like that Sir Whats the matter Lets go Do you see any resemblance to her It looks like her Just as eerie Well take some photos Thats enough Sadako Why do you keep me alive made you and your mother into a freak show It was me Do you want me to return you to the sea Is that what you want Do you know the Yamamura house There are a lot of Yamamuras The one where a woman named Shizuko used to live Oh that one l Hello This way please Sorry Did wake you No Well Can you promise me something What No matter who comes to you dont do such a thing again Thats terrible Are you on my side Yes am Of course If youre looking for Sadako ve put her in the sea That was all could do for her Come to think of it Shizuko used to say the same thing She went off to give birth to Sadako all on her own She came back after the birth saying shed put the baby away in the sea But the next day she had a baby in her arms That noise Thats where Sadako was born This is called the Childrens Limbo When the water is high it washes away all the unwanted Was Sadakos father Hello Yes Is Mai Takano staying here No At least you have a room right Wait Sadako You are already dead You are already dead Oh m so relieved Do you remember your dream last night In that case think about your mother Thats good Can have a word He is controlled by anger His anger summons Sadako He cant control it My equipment should arrive today ll try to eliminate Sadakos energy Theres no such thing as ghosts or the other world Takayama always criticised me But Yoichi isnt strong enough to What choice have we What happens if the police come He channels the energy perfect medium ll do it Do you have the same power as Takayama Yes It doesnt mean youll do better as a medium than the boy What if watch the video Then all we need is water Water Sea water doesnt permeate as well We need a lot of fresh water to absorb Sadakos fury With this system you conduct the energy he generates into water where it dissolves Then Sadako will disappear Are we ready Yes Take your place Come Remember m on your side Lets start Close your eyes Remember what you saw What did you see Yes Both your father and mother died You are all on your own What did you see Shall tell you Your mother died because of her She betrayed her Yes it was my fault It looks good Keep it up Dr Kawajiri this is it is connected to the other world Sadako Sadako Take me and kill me Take me and put an end to all this Are you Dont let go Let me fall and youll be safe Frolic in brine goblins be thine Hold on to the wall cant support you by myself Hold on to the wall Mai Its enough its over Yoichi Yoichi Yoichi Take him Sir Yoichi Give your fear to me Give it to me Give it to me Get away Take
