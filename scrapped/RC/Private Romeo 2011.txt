What ladybird What Juliette And we mean well in going to this mask But tis no wit to go Why may one ask dreamd dreamd a dream tonight And so did Well what was yours That dreamers often lie In bed asleep while they do dream things true then see Queen Mab hath been with you She is the fairies midwife and she comes In shape no bigger than an agatestone On the forefinger of an alderman Drawn with a team of little atomies Athwart mens noses as they lie asleep Her chariot is an empty hazelnut Her wagonspokes made of long spiders legs The cover of the wings of grasshoppers The traces of the smallest spiders web Her whip of crickets bone the lash of film Her driver a small greycoated gnat Not so big as a round little worm Prickd from the lazy finger of a maid And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers brains and then they dream of love er ladies lips who straight on kisses dream Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are Sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats Of breaches ambuscadoes Spanish blades Of healths fivefathom deep and then anon Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again Peace peace Thou talkst of nothing talk of dreams Which are the children of an idle brain Begot of nothing but vain fantasy Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves Come Knock and enter Supper is done and we shall come too late Welcome gentlemen Ladies that have their toes Unplagued with corns will have about with you hall a hall give room and foot it girls She that makes dainty She ll swear hath corns Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance Not believe me you have dancing shoes With nimble soles have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground cannot move You are a lover borrow Cupids wings And soar with them above a common bound am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar Under loves heavy burden do sink And to sink in it should you burden love Too great oppression for a tender thing Is love a tender thing It is too rough Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn If love be rough with you be rough with love Prick love for pricking and you beat love down What lady is that which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight know not she doth teach the torches to burn bright It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night as a rich jewel in an Ethiopes ear Beauty too rich for use for earth too dear So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows As yonder lady oer her fellows shows The measure done ll watch her place of stand And touching hers make blessed my rude hand Did my heart love till now For swear it sight For neer saw true beauty till this night What What dares the slave Come hither coverd with an antic face to fleer and scorn at our solemnity Why how now Wherefore storm you so This is our foe that villain Romeo Ttake no note of him Show a fair presence and put off these frowns And illbeseeming semblance for a feast ll not endure him He shall be endured Am the master here or you Go to Go to Why tis a shame Be quiet or for shame ll make you quiet Sure like your kicks in it nice Thanks Is it like a Thats the loose string Its cool like it And what is Oh If profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine the gentle thin is this My lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss Good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much Which mannerly devotion shows in this For saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch And palm to palm is holy palmers kiss Have not saints lips and holy palmers too Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer then dear saint let lips do what hands do They pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair Saints do not move though grant for prayers sake Then move not while my prayers effect take will withdraw but this intrusion shall now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall Thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged Then have my lips the sin that they have took Sin from thy lips trespass sweetly urged Give me my sin again It makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting Madam your mother craves a word with you Come Lets away Romeo Away begone the sport is at the best Ay so fear the more is my unrest Romeo My cousin Romeo He is wise Benvolio And on my life hath stoln him home to bed He ran this way Call good Mercutio Nay ll conjure too Romeo Humours Madman Lover Passion Romeo Romeo Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh Speak but one rhyme and am satisfied And if he hear thee thou wilt anger him This cannot anger him my invocation Is fair and honest Come He hath hid himself among these trees To be consorted with the humorous night Blind is his love and best befits the dark If love be blind it cannot hit the mark Romeo Good night ll to my bed This fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep Go then For tis in vain to seek him here that means not to be found He jests at scars that never felt a wound But soft What light through yonder window breaks It is the east and Juliet is the sun Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo Deny thy father and refuse thy name Whats in a name That which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet So Romeo would were he not Romeo calld retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title Romeo doff thy name and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself take thee at thy word call me but love and ll be new baptized Henceforth never will be Romeo What man art thou that thus bescreend in night so stumblest on my counsel By a name know not how to tell thee who am My name dear saint is hateful to myself because it is an enemy to thee My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words of that tongues utterance yet know the sound Art thou not Romeo and a Montague Neither if either thee dislike How camest thou hither tell me and wherefore The orchard walls are high and hard to climb And the place death considering who thou art if any of my kinsmen find thee here With loves light wings did oerperch these walls For stony limits cannot hold love out And what love can do that dares love attempt Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me If they do see thee they will murder thee Alack there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords Look thou but sweet And am proof against their enmity Thou knowst the mask of night is on my face Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight gentle Romeo If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully Or if thou thinkst am too quickly won ll frown and be perverse an say thee nay So thou wilt woo If my hearts dear love Well do not swear Although joy in thee have no joy of this contract tonight It is too rash too unadvised too sudden wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied What satisfaction canst thou have tonight The exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine gave thee mine before thou didst request it And yet would it were to give again Wouldst thou withdraw it For what purpose love But to be frank and give it thee again And yet wish but for the thing have My bounty is as boundless as the sea my love as deep The more
