his broken legs are mended He fell from a cushion while being questioned Next case Great Wazir we have apprehended a thief with a hundred pieces of gold taken from the house of Achmed Let him appear Oh At last good fortune returns to me Good fortune The noble Wazir himself sitting in judgment Who could ask for a more righteous a fairer a finer judge loathe fawning criminals He doesnt talk like a thief Oh Let your loveliness be the loot princess and every man is a thief Silence Oh let him chatter a bit The evidence against this criminal is as fo need no evidence Under the laws of Baghdad order that the right hand of this liar rogue and thief be cut off Have you aught to say before sentence is executed Well that am a liar am not a big enough liar to deny That am a rogue can be verified by anyone who knows me And that am a thief is as true as if it were written in the Koran But in this particular case say for the first time in my life am innocent dislike being mocked in public Add lashes to my sentence Are you done with your protest It is rather expensive but should like to continue can understand your indifference that am innocent dispenser of justice the pick purse the

his tongue that should be cut off But let the sentence stand Right hand off Oh noble Wazir assure you that despise innocence as much as you It is at best a temporary state What are you bothering me

spoutless whale Like an elephant sunk If you cut off his trunk Hold d like to hear a little more When you tell a story Amorous or gory You can tell it best If you gesticulate Suppose the mighty Sinbad Meets a jinn whos been bad They will guess the rest If you gesticulate tongue is a tongue lung is a lung And a tale you can shout or sing Without the gesture nothing Nothing Should Scheherazade Undulate her body That can be expressed if you ges Can be assessed if you ges Shell be undressed If you gesticulate If tell you was walking by the sea And found a genie in a bottle Thats trite Quite For practically everyone has seen a genie Someone had to throttle In a bottle Right but if say the bottle Was so teeny So teeny And so was the genie So was the genie Until with trembling hand pulled the cork And threw the jug And covered up my eyes And the smoke began to curl And the smoke began to swirl And it swirled and it curled And it curled and it swirled As higher it did rise Till it was so high So high And so was the genie So was the genie Then two great arms reached down Two great arms And lifted me up Up Up up Up up Into the sky So high so high And we did fly And he did fly The genie and How he did fly We did sail Did sail Did sail Did sail Is this a tale This is a tale Are you convinced We are convinced You see You see For the facile finger Listeners will linger They will

Beggar Magician Restore all his gold to him Yes Great Wazir Hehheh Now lets come to terms quickly How much to lift that curse of yours Forgive me but can do no more today Consider what ve already done Suppose we should raise you to the rank of emir Emir Me An emir Lalume an emir is second only to me Dont haggle with the wizard He may take offense and turn you into something worse than you are My daughter and members of the nobility But only if you undo the harm youve caused and prevent the Caliphs marriage Prevent the Caliphs marriage Ohhoho but you are too kind It is overwhelming What a day

Still it does function Weve seen it Yes Yes it does doesnt it Noble Wazir accept your offer Done Great Wazir Yes Shall we dismiss the court No feel good ll sentence the rest of the criminals before my nap Come here You know when really angered at someone my husband usually drops him alive from a high battlement onto a long hook Thus will you be impaled when he discovers youre a fraud Then may make a suggestion Lets not tell him He doesnt need to be told Hell know the moment the Caliph marries That is why hesitated before accepting his offer But well love is an uncertain business And if lovers quarrel as young lovers often do then m an emir If not well that is kismet Youd gamble your life on such a slim chance Princess have risked floggings for a handful of dates envy you Every moment an adventure life totally without monotony Yes That you can say for it Since my socalled marriage to the Wazir have waked each morning with the chart of my day staring down at me from the ceiling The
