you seen these Oh good your crumpets told the stagehands to get them for you Well they didnt had to ask them had to talk to a stagehand And look they put on too much butter Its pooling pooling Catherine Thats why its your job to be there with my crumpets so they get just enough butter and Excuse me My job is Gads Hill Theater costume designer not crumpet butteriser do that for you because youre my friend But still have a look at them theyre pooling Eden know you feel better when m there to watch you perform but couldnt tonight Dont worry know you were brilliant as always dont need you to tell me was brilliant know was brilliant But as a costume designer thought you might want to do your job and see the dress you made onstage understand So what was so important that you couldnt come upstairs Look around you Eden Look at the tree its Christmas Eve We wanted to celebrate a little before we all go off on holiday Holiday Who said anything about a holiday Excuse me What No holiday No No holiday But its Christmas m aware its Christmas which means theres only two weeks before you will get the privilege of being in Eden Starlings new show You should be begging to rehearse No no no no This is an outrage Eden we cant work on Christmas We have people coming over Theres a turkey to stuff And pies to bake Oh we cant be here Eden please reconsider beg of you You dont want to work on Christmas Youre not dedicated enough to this theatre Fine stay home But if you do dont bother coming back ever What You need to talk to Eden Please youve known her forever She listens to you Eden doesnt make a move without talking to you Youre the only one who can change her mind without getting us all fired right Right Keep your Christmas plans Okay seriously Eden you cant Eden doesnt make a move without talking to you Eden What they all think m wrapped around your little finger m the star Youre asking them to give up Christmas They have plans have plans Bigger plans than my next show Yes m leaving town tomorrow and going home My whole family will be there for Christmas dinner this year That hasnt happened since we were kids You of all people should know how important that is to me You know what should be important to you Me When was discovered could have had any costume designer in London for my company but insisted on you my oldest friend did that know you did and And you dont care But expect that when push comes to shove know only one person whos truly there for me me Its like Aunt Marie always said In a selfish world the selfish succeed Its not a selfish world And do you really want to listen to what Aunt Marie said My Aunt Marie was brilliant If it werent for her wouldnt be here right now and neither would you But if you cant appreciate that maybe you shouldnt work here any more Tell me youre not threatening to fire me ve seen you backstage sewing things that arent for the show guess working at the top theatre in London isnt enough for you You had to pick up something on the side What No thats not what you think Prove it and show some dedication Take down the trees stop the carols and get ready to work tonight tomorrow and all through the week Anyone complains anyone goes home anyone breathes one word about Christmas theyre out including you Does everyone understand Yes We Understand Oui oui What You have no idea how sad it makes me to see you like this Merry Christmas Eden said not to mention that word That is the last time want to hear it Christmas Bah humbug Edens mean Oh you think so guess she can come off as kind of mean but No she is mean Okay if thats how you see it So that night Wait Its just you usually tell me stories about nice girls girls who are good to everyone Well thats true Edens someone whos making a lot of mistakes But sometimes we can learn from people who make mistakes dont you think Like when you left your shoes out in the kitchen and tripped over them learned not to do that Exactly And you were carrying spaghetti and it went everywhere All over the floor and on the walls Uhhuh remember And in your hair And remember one piece hung right down in your face And when you breathed in it almost went up your nose and Okay remember Can we get back to the story now dont know Maybe m not all done learning yet Kelly Okay we can get back to the story Thank you So they rehearsed all that evening And that night while Eden was asleep Oh Whos there Eden Aunt Marie Yes my darling It is Whoa Dont just sit there gaping child Didnt raise you with any manners When your aunts ghost comes to visit and gets tripped up in her chains you help her Of course mustve forgotten Much better Now child walk with me Mmm Free up time Better stay standing think youd have an easier time if you took off some of your jewellery No Eden these chains dont ever come off Theyre the chains formed in life Chains of selfishness But you always said selfishness is good In a selfish world the selfish succeed You still say that after all these years suppose should be flattered You really did care for me Well of course Aunt Marie You raised me Like a true daughter And youve become everything dreamed Oh thank you Which is terrible So tonight want you to change You want me to what Change child change And not just your nightgown though with the money you make you really could do so much better want you to change your life Eden Forget everything told you It is not a selfish world That was my excuse for not having the talent to become a star myself But when see what it did to you when see how wrong was Youre not my Aunt Marie Youre not even a ghost at all Not a ghost am floating two feet off the ground How much ghostlier do you want me to be Stop that What are you doing So whats holding you up hmm Wires Whatever it is its a good trick This is the last time visit you from beyond can promise you that The real Aunt Marie would never say she was wrong She raised me perfectly to be a star raised you to be a perfectly selfish ninny But now have the chance to make it right m sending you three spirits tonight Listen to them Eden If youre lucky theyll help you change your life before you end up like me Now And you can tell everyone at the Gads Hill who sent you here that theyre all fired Chuzzlewit But what happened to Strange Chuzzlewit Chuzzlewit its not morning Oh stop it Chuzzlewit youre going outside Oh had
