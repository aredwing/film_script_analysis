In the spring of a young graduate film student from set forth to make a documentary reflecting an element of contemporary music culture that had yet to be fully examined The notion was to capture something raw and original something unpretentious and genuine He yearned to make a film that would stand out from other rock n roll documentaries and potentially redefine the genre Who he found was Electric Apricot What he achieved was Enlightenment Well ve been doing yoga all day but do that every day so guess thats not special but yes ve prepared a couple pieces and also wrapped a couple things of sage that grew in my garden some pineapple sage some lavender sage together think are going to really help cleanse the room before we start Its got a peazio pickup in here Peazio dont know what that means but it sounds cool huh Yeah man Whose car did you borrow Thats my sisters To fully understand the band we must first examine the music scene that spawned this colorful group of troubadours we call Electric Apricot Known as Jam Band music this scene has been expanding and evolving rapidly over the past several years think the jam scene is really um freeloving with a bit of like assshaking and like kind of just you know crazy like wow Its about dancing its about shaking loose your normal everyday stresses and getting into a fun space The band plays a twominute song goes into ten minutes of silliness and creates new music thats never been played before Ultimately jamming is all about language Its all about language Wittgenstein says is that language all philosophy is meaningless because language is meaningless Its great to see new blood in the improvisational rock n roll music scene get a little squirmy when people try and categorize us one way or another you know We could be We could be like a Jam Band thing one minute and then we can get into some funkiness For somebody to go out there with a bunch of sequencers and put on a show thats pretty much notefornote every time flies in the face of what American musical culture is about in my opinion Playing music you should just fucking jam it You should jam it and jam it hard jam it true People can see they can interact with me can interact with them can give them some of my looks Jimmy air freshener man You see that Its always gonna smell like Jimmy Jimmy When m playing and m doing one of my fills try and make eye contact with somebody just to kind of give them a little something to take home with them Theres a place wondrous place place out on the playa where likeminded individuals can get together and share ideas Its a place that knows no boundaries except for those that are set by your own mind Creativity blooms That place is a place called Burning Man Burning Man Burning Man Burning Man Hey are you going to Burning Man To bury your toes in the desert sand Aint no man born to tell you how to be ll take you to Burning Man ve got a recipe for cosmic flan Strip off your clothes and set your aura free Theres a place ve been called Black Rock City Where were taught to get down Onto Juilliard at evening Waltz in with my saxophone Searching for answers and feasting on the world Ah first saw them on Earth day in Modesto Killer show And then saw them at the Santa Rosa Agricultural Festival at Windsor Waterworks which was it totally went off and was in the front and m doing the cube You know its this dance made up What do is make a cube with my hands Um just kinda started going like that and just sort of made a square shape more like a threedimensional square tightknit group of individuals the Jam scene flourishes through communal interaction be it via the internet tapetrading or multigenred festivals one of the premier events being the Northwests own musical extravaganza Festeroo Festeroo Festeroo Festeroo Festeroo man Do know about Festeroo With its treelined rural setting just northwest of Portland Oregon Festeroo has been host to some of the topnamed acts in the Jam scene since autumn of The Jam festivals are basically mudfests like any festivals Festeroo theres fire theres circus theres Jam theres beat People walking around with no tops on thats awesome Bathing in the river thats awesome Yeah it was the greatest thing l pinnacle experience l l shat myself It was awesome Dude total meltdown dont know what happened just lost my keys right before the gig We got all this important stuff in there gotta get this stuff out No keys But who knows Weak Super weak The light on my laminate saved me usually because got a light on my key Uhoh My goal as manager is to continually try to raise the profile of this band Weve got some upcoming local gigs which is great Then next week we go into the studio to record the bands first album on my friends record label The real deal is ve been working some angles to try to get the band into Festeroo Have you done Ford Windstars before Oh man we played so many We played like we played basically coffeehouses You know we play all kinds of different coffeehouses around town mean basically wed set up in front of the coffeehouse but wed just put our hats down And think it was Don Don Kleinfeld our manager who first introduced us me and Steve to Lapdog He was like Hey man why dont you guys get some percussion know this guy Lapdog You know had been in this band Illucifer which was the illusive Lucifer which was this metal band And then got into the funky stuff So was kind of trying to combine the two things so it was kind of like this double bass metal funky stuff you know think he had some funk band Funky White Monkey or something like that In doing the Funky White Monkey thing learned that there was more to music with the whole soulful groove element So we started playing live we started doing our usual circuit of the coffeehouses And then this guy shows up with this big doublekit dont know Tama Superstar Kit cymbals everywhere and he sets up in front of Petes Coffee mean could see their point mean we did block entirely block the sidewalk Just playing on the sidewalk its just not that conducive to what do You couldnt really hear us sing or play because he would Lap would just he would just solo most of the time Just take five deep breaths and open up that third eye And ll tell you my brother were going to go on a magic carpet ride Because if you never take the chance to look then youll never know Well go walkin through the backroads Of my mind Rolling down that kaleidoscope Of inner space and time yeah Walkin down the backroads of my mind Take it away Gordo couldnt dance because it was so intense And go in there and people are like Dude what are you doing m like Dude what are you talking about ve been to every show and come here to dance just want to feel the music always have two headbands One to get my sh because like the shape that it makes my hair and one to cover my watch because when m in the Apricot zone m living in a world without time Yeah were going to be were going to be at the Sweetwater show you know mean whew what can you say about Mill Valley man that hasnt been said already mean its where mountainbiking started its where cappuccino started The Sweetwaters been here for something years now and it gets good people through there all the time Its sweet to be at the Sweetwater indeed but unfortunately m a little bit off center right now just because well my cell phone got turned off today Hey whats up My name is Jonah and m a taper Hi m Tom Lystrus and m a taper think it should be a good a good crowd tonight You might want to set that a bit higher My favorite thing about Electric Apricot clearly is just the support of the community mean we come to tape the shows they give us plenty of time to set up ahead of time Weve been here like since Were done were ready were set you know Were ready to Were ready to capture the magic really Now weve just got five hours to finetune it before they get here Gordo he really wanted to go go in a more electric He wanted to go Hes a big Jerry fan you know Jerry Garcia Which is completely opposite of what wanted to do because wanted to go into more of a British Morrissey trip And if a tenton truck kills the both of us All of a sudden Steve Trouzdale as we once knew him he sees this Phish show You have to ask him because its a classic story So we went to the casinos and we were partying hard and we hooked up with these two girls who turned out to be guys It was just you know It was in One of them dosed me Dosed him with some or something and he ends up at this Phish show and he just becomes mesmerized with the bass player Mike Gordon And all of a sudden theres this eruption of color And found out what it was Because at first thought it was like you know whats going on here Is this some alien battle or something They have like glowstick wars where people are throwing all these glowsticks back and forth And then one just tags me in the side of the head and instantly thought of Aiwass which Aiwass is the entity is the spirit that channeled the right of Thelema to Aleister Crowley The next day at rehearsal said to the guys you know m Aiwass Call me Aiwass am a bass player was like man thats a gift from heaven Here we are he wants to play bass now so now weve got a bass and this big drum set and then m going to plug this thing in and there we go trio Jimmy Hendrix land They tried to give us a little grief because its a because of the lightning bolt but its actually an point lightning bolt and its a little narrower and its at a different angle and the Grateful Dead has a point lightning bolt Ours is quite a bit different but This is This is the premier mic right now for this kind of taping Its the most expansive dynamic range Very fancy It expanded on what the was the Schoeps which is Its what use What Jonah has This is really what were doing now This is the new technology You get more of a lateral sound with that Its got a projection the intake is not as pinpoint directional but what find is this mic yields an ambient sound which captures all the things that like and find most important about it You know its the younger kids theyre really its exciting watching you grow But this mic is better Its better Do you like milk chocolate or do you like dark chocolate You like chocolate you understand what m saying So its the type of sound that it yields Its great Its great having friends Yeah Well its the All right now Ready Damn Oh wait One two three four five six was getting my groove on One two three four five six Five six One two three four five six Hang on Wait Are you m trying to get my groove on Shh shh On the corner Miles Davis You know dont really speak literally because if you speak in a literal way its like next thing you know everyone understands you and thats just like who wants that man Its like a fucking church the fucking church the fucking steeple and theres the people Thats Apricot dont know about the steeple thing Thats the first ve heard of this steeple thing She train blues Jerry Garcia The man the myth the legend Well wanted to make a guitar that looks a lot like Jerrys because hes my favorite What we got here is this guitar is a total Jerry the recipe is Jerry and stuff like that with just a pinch of Warren Haynes Big jumbo frets We were in Berkeley and we went to one of them Greek Theatre shows and then in the morning was still kinda coming down we went to Smokey Joes Caf and was getting the Holy Moley Frijole breakfast was digging into my beans and digging into my eggs so went to go grab a tortilla Ah ah ah Okay be careful And then there it was dude Look at that Can you see it Hold on check it out See Can you see it Its like a sign the most prized possession How How does he know it wasnt Jesus Jesus shows up on a tortilla its on eBay for several thousand dollars Unfortunately it wasnt Jesus because we couldve Jesus we could have used the money for that one Garcia Tortilla Yeah at this point they started kicking around some ideas for band names Gordo wanted to call it Electric Mountain You know my idea was Vaseline Groove wanted Knectar with a a silent like the Phish thing with the with it He wanted to name the band Knectar with a silent like knight like Knights of the Roundtable Its clever you know Hes an intellectual guy and he can come up with stuff like that If you think about it for a second Vaseline Groove Its like Pearl Jam Well what is Pearl Jam Pearl Jam thats semen right Pearl like pearlescent jam Its semen Well Vaseline Groove think about it Its like Its like a lubricated vagina You got the Electric from Electric Mountain nectar and then rine from the Vaseline pssh We said lets just combine them all so it was Electric Knectarine with a silent Unfortunately people started pronouncing the band name Electric Connectarine You know they obviously didnt get it like the Connectarine And so that was tripping us out So then Gordo one day hes looking at our logo and hes like hes like Well thats not a nectarine anyway My uncle grew up around a fruit stand That looks like an apricot to me Yeah Electric Apricot Electric Apricot Electric Apricot So there it was Electric Apricot Queen has insects for eyes She lives In a kingdom of lies She shouts Your sorrows arise And laughs At the hideous cries The queen has been eaten alive Where did you go Where did you go Whered you go Rainbro Where did you go Oh Rainbro where did you go Sailing across the skies with your mystic disguise Oh Rainbro live in this tree for full time This really is what consider my home Yeah the tree fort is in my parents backyard technically mean my Technically Where you going Rainbro Everybody wants to know Did you catch some cosmic wind Ridin high Hi High High Wait wait My gardener Don Carlos made this for me Something he crafted from the wood from his country think its Venezuela Uh might be France Its just nature out here you know How many other people can say oh woke up this morning and saw a raccoon mating That doesnt happen very often Well this is the what call the excrameditation chamber or you know my bathroom Maybe its a little primitive for some peoples standards but its got everything need Its got running water and its got a toilet Well its got a bucket and a place for toilet paper And got art This is like like Cars should be political think you have an opportunity of saying political things and so more than voting more than doing anything if you really want to stick it to your government more than anything anything you dont even have to vote Just put on a few bumper stickers man Just put on a few bumper stickers man Shall we go to Petes party Millies Hacky Sacking with Cousin Arty Annies got a henna tattoo Grandads blowing on a didgeridoo Blowing glass everybody has their thing friend of mines dad he really wanted an elaborate set of cocktail swizzlers so what m doing And usually people like that they have some good money they want quality quality merchandise And realize this looks easy this looks like something that anybody can do but its really not was working on a bowl one time and had this big gob going and was leaning forward and the whole thing just fell off and landed right in my lap burned my scrotum and it was fairly severe You know a fiery hot ball of molten glass on the scrotum is not good The unfortunate thing is got a lot of my friends come around here And blow stuff and want to sell them but usually these guys come along and they smoke out of everything leave laying around so you cant sell something to a store that somebodys been smoking out of But this ones real nice probably could have gotten some good money for this one Look at the detail here ve blown a couple of dildos because youre always looking for other markets for things like the swizzle sticks think thats going to be great that could be a big marketable item because everybody makes pipes This ones actually modeled after a friend of mines penis He took a picture of it and sent it to me because didnt really want him to be in here with an erection m pretty comfortable with my sexuality and whatnot but when youre in a hot room and fires blowing and this guys got an erection in front of you its just not thats just not my game This ones a little smaller This would be more for like sort of the rear entry or at least you know sort of a uh you know something to to um you know dont know We probably shouldnt go there too far Well the first person met in the band was Lapdog and we met at an AfroCuban drumming class and You want to talk about polyrhythmic Herschel used to play in this cover band this Huey Lewis cover band called New Drug They would play and they had the skinny ties and the whole vibe Herschel would be all Hip to be square Hed be doing that whole thing You know like Huey Lewis remember His band was New Drug want a new drug One that dont make me sick One that makes me crash my car Just like its a brick or something like that For us it was the ultimate tribute to one of our influences Huey Lewis It had that beat that Om bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum liked it you know It kind of reminded me of that Ghostbusters song Next thing we knew Herschel was playing keyboards with us Multiinstrumentalist amazing player and he hasnt requested we do any Huey Lewis It opened up to a whole nother dimension Like we went from into My father was a missionary and he was a traveling missionary He was actually an Iraqi American Indian Hawaiian Jew Nam Myoho Renge Kyo basically work here four days a week make a little extra money on the side so can pursue what really love to do which is play music obviously with Electric Apricot Nam Myoho Renge Kyo its a mantra a Tibetan mantra And what like to do is that every beverage that make like to recite this mantra ten times over the beverage before serve it Do you want a hot chocolate as well Two hot chocolates Something for you maam

cause discomfort were here to bring happiness to people Thank you Okay Thank you very much You have a good day made those extra special for you guys with lots of love Did you feel it It was kinda trippy because right around then Aiwass was going off on this whole Phish thing and wanting to get into more intricate arrangements took it upon myself to be that guy in the band who would make us progress and push us forward in our musicianship We would rehearse and then it was like Okay And wed go in and out of these time changes and then hed turn off all the lights and we would go through all of this stuff Okay Everyone would be jamming and they wouldnt know but d be like d still kinda be jamming but d have my flashlight and d spot it on the guys face One of those big mag lights like the cops use Bam right in your face stop the song and say Okay Stop And d say Okay sing sing the parts that everyone else was just playing Dush Okay Sing what the next guy was doing over there just randomly And you had to go Bada doo da doo doo da or whatever the keyboards were doing or somebody had to do my drum parts My drum parts are very intricate theyre very difficult To have a bright light flashed in your face in the middle of a dark room while you are meditating on our mistress music is a scary and psychologically scarring experience just started wearing sunglasses in rehearsal and it didnt make it as bad but there you go Seriously dont understand why anybody would come see that piece of shit band mean respect music love music actually like to get down but dude that shit doesnt make any sense to me just dont bleep get it Probably one of the worst bands ve ever seen ve seen them come ve seen them go and honestly they take the cake Theyre seriously so bleep bad got pissed off cant handle bad music Its like you guys should change the name of your band to Day Job hate the Grateful Dead bleep hate that band Honestly my parents listen to that bleep music over and over and over again and my mom did that dance thing where they do the dance At about age eight started realizing that that guy Jerry Garcia bleep sucks dude And my parents are bleep stoned Jerry Garcia is a bleep plague dude All those bleep burritomaking hipturning hippies that listen to him and bleep tool around and dont get jobs and dont do anything they can bleep go to hell The band bleep sucks and they died when he died and m glad its over dude m glad its bleep over You know that bartender downstairs Yeah didnt like his vibe Dude that guy was talking hella shit about us Started talking about us then he started talking about um Jerry and hs like m glad that guy died What was like What Hes all m glad he died Fuck him m like Whoa Hold on He said m glad that guy died He said m glad Jerry died All right m gonna beat him What the fuck dude Yeah this is a good thing man Don brought this cat around Drew Shackleford Who am Whos Drew Shackelford lover of beauty a singer of songs Thats what m about m about spreading love you know ve got it ve got the knowledge m like a Renaissance Man He loves the band hes into it Hes got a big fat pad up in the up in the hills and uh So far he seems like a really cool guy you know Hes got some money dont know where he gets his money m not asking any questions Hes kinda going to finance our record Were going to do a record going to put out this record m stoked man Hes like our Owsley you know was just there to say you know what brothers Youre going down the right road you know Let me help you Youve got the wheel youre driving the vehicle just let me be the gas want to help you succeed want to give back because see you in me and you see me in you Hes not a stuckup guy you know He doesnt hang out in the Polo Lounge or drink cocktails with umbrellas sticking out of them or any of that stuff The kind of stuff that do think really connects with people Its the simple stuff but man the vibe that people get off it is pretty heavy Thats what people have told me anyway m confident that we are going to bring a beautiful child into the world this new album When undertaking a recording in a professional environment a good deal of skillful and tenacious preparation is involved The key to it all People are always trying to get really good snare sounds and think the most important element to me is the kick drum The kick drum its really the meat think the snare is more the potatoes You got your meat and your potatoes with your snare And maybe the high hat is more like the asparagus Today expect its going to take a little bit longer because really want to get it right because you only make your first record once you know what m saying You only make your first record once Let me know if that bubble goes too far out to the left there Its usually worth waiting for ve never had anyones set take this long to set up mean he only has four drums As far as studio stuff m probably quite a bit more experienced than the other guys You know the Geinserle Diamonds dont know if you remember that jingle They called me in and played on that played It was like a glockenspiel but it wasnt really a glockenspiel but it was this little bell tree thing and played on that Howre we doing Uh Lapdogs still setting up Hes still setting up huh view golf as a spiritual journey and am a warrior armed with a weapon This club and these shoes were given to me by the High Priest of the Borborandon temple on the Maldive Islands envision that all the evil and all the suffering in the world is encapsulated in that ball and it is my responsibility as a spiritual warrior to drive it as far away from this planet as possible Dammit That was wet Ploink feel all sorts of anger bubbling up inside of me but m not going to let it out here Thats not bad Look at that hoo hoo Look at that m on the dance floor Noonan Noonan Thats from like that movie Whoa Look at that need to burn some sage out here Maybe should go back to our car and get some Yeah dont know about that Heh hah hah know that Lapdog had a good day out there and m genuinely happy for him m happy he had a good time And deep down somewhere had a good time too l know got a bit upset Well yeah Lapdog talking a lot while was putting and saying things in the middle of my backswing that didnt help Noonan Noonan Noonan Ah Ugh Sorry Thats from that Caddyshack movie again Once this record goes platinum or gold or whatever its going to do then might just redevelop my whole set because m sure therell be some drum companies that will want to give me some equipment Then can just do what want and l believe me have some ideas The reason use pictures is that theres been studies that have shown that what you see affects how you hear This picture here is a picture of a classic Jungian archetype An archetype is a particular pattern of energy that you find throughout the cosmos This character here is a shamanic character named Mescalito and what it symbolizes is him reaching out into the unknown and grabbing some fruit fruit of knowledge say to nourish his lady love who is the archetype called the Great Mother Lapdogs just setting up Yeah You guys remember Mei Pang Mei Pang whats happening Cool Hes setting up huh Yep Yep Good thing brought a book Today very important m going to probably have to do this seven or eight times before we even start tracking Because you know you only make your first album once You know She represents all women or the nurturing aspect of creation and so he is going out and foraging for fruit to feed creation basically and thats what musicians are doing Theyre sort of taking their craft their instrument and trying to go out into the visionary space and bring back something nourishing to feed their audience Where are we at Whats going on Lapdog is still setting up the drums Still All right Wheres the beer They have this really good stuff right here Uh huh But if your cuttings are a couple of weeks old this is what you should use Thats really going to give them powerful plants Oh yeah thats what need Yeah we make a few ducats in the band and all but sometimes its hard to make ends meet Been working with these hydroponics for some time now and got myself a sweet cash crop in here going to help me pay these bills All right well here we are Weve got some nice Roma tomatoes here Dont know if you can see them or not but these are really good for sauce Ah some nice sweet basil Thats going to be good in your pesto grow hydroponic herbs and vegetables for highend restaurants like Chez Panisse Dankos and Boulevard and all that stuff What we got here is the Peruvian purple pepper See that thing Comes from Peru dont Bolivia Peruv it Hey Skip can you set that mic on the second rack for me please Well basically my job is to work with Oz whos like a master Now the bass drum mic is a little bit far away This down here can be right up against the head Do you even think you want to use a Because wouldnt use a What would you suggest Something bigger Lets just try it And if it doesnt work well change it m Second Engineer and fresh out of music school This is just a cool experience for me mean know all my stuff ve taken good notes in class got like like a average and stuff am not going to mess with your good thing man so you just tell me what to do and ll do it Okay that goes on the hihat Thats the hihat right over there Yeah know what the hihat is man Lets go with the snare please Though often a repetitive process recording requires a Zenlike focus and open state of being where ideas and inspiration can flow unimpeded raising the art to a higher level of musical transcendence Yeah Oz yeah m not really getting that in the cans Hello Hey How you doin man Good to see you Oz hey Oh hey Hows it going Its good Good You guys stoked to be here Oh its incredible Oh yeah Its incredible Were stoked to have you Theres a vibe that want to send out and wanted to bring people in Like this is a beehive and were

Shes a photographer just want you guys to know am just going to be a fly on the wall here dont want you to think that m not going to get in your way Hey Oz what have we got m just finishing with the floor toms sound now and then ll check the cymbals So we basically just have some tones on the bass drum Is this on the track the recorded track No we havent actually recorded anything yet Drew Weve just been working on sounds Just drum sounds Just drum sounds yeah So So here it is guys the first note of the first song of the first Electric Apricot record What do you think about that All right Cut Sorry sorry sorry sorry Sorry l hit the wrong tom All right ready Are we rolling Okay here we go Share fishin Sorry sorry sorry Share what meant to say vision and said fishin Is everything cool Yeah m good man Were just All right It just seemed like we got off on a rough rough rocky start there Hey Oz what number is the bass in Your amp is just incredibly loud Its killing me You guys okay We need to turn the bass amp down a bit Down Its probably bleeding through all the drums right Oz Pardon me Its probably bleeding through all the drums right mean it just seems really loud Yeah My favorite book store Copperfields lot of people dont know about poetry is the thing about poetry that is so beautiful is really not the words on the page but its how you read it Its how You You use your poetry voice But through presumption even the pleasure pleased Unworthy disliking here and there Liking by the rules of mimic are transformed You know thats the poetry voice and it takes you to the poetry space Everything is poetry Vegetarian Suppers Take any part of any book We like pancakes not only for breakfast but for supper to occasion Pillowy and light these golden cakes are delicious With dabs of sour cream and a favorite of our cuisine Day three in the studio We have yet to actually record an actual track But came back in here today burned some sage do want to try and move my setup so that feel more in tune with the band want to rotate this just a little bit clockwise okay Just this way Yeah just a little bit Okay on the count of three You got a good Yeah can you get a hand Yeah got it One two three Oh Ow Jesus Christ Oh oh Oh my God Holy shit dude Oh Dude Hershel he cut his hand on a loose screw on his organ Just a freak accident But uh the good news is he got his tetanus shot and hes in good spirits again And uh onward and upward It hurts It definitely hurts Hey m goin to Burning Man Hey m goin to Burning Man Hey are you goin to Burning Man Well we made it

are you goin to Hey are you goin to Burning Man Hey are you goin Yeah Well we made it Did you Did you see what mean by like the bass was like a little bit behind the drums Did you see Did you notice that think theres some problems with the drums to be honest The bass was a little behind it It seems like the drums were dropping a little bit you know Some parts of those fills kinda sounded like you fell down the stairs a little bit Well that was sort of you know syncopation You ever hear of syncopation Right right You know the main thing tell me if m wrong Oz but as long as the drums are correct this is a good take You dont think that you guys could just dub your parts over the top dont think its us guys This is our first record This is the first song on the first record We gotta make a statement You know what Gordo We open up that door we gotta make that statement You know what You only make your first record once Yeah Are you goin to Burning man You guys ready for playback Hey are you goin to Burning man Its like a salad man If we have all the pieces of the salad and they go together and it gives you one flavor Yeah If you take like If you take a cucumber out and just eat it alone it doesnt taste like a salad So when were not playing together and its all perfect together then you know But the drums are like the lettuce of the salad Yeah was the lettuce good And if the lettuce isnt good No Hey its uh day four And weve been recording Burning Man for about three days now which know that seems like a long time but if you think about it the actual event Burning Man its its a week Its seven days So from that perspective we are actually ahead of the game It feels good Hey are you goin to Burning man That was rad think we got it What was that Did you hear that No What was that That What What that Hey are you goin to Burning man What the hells that What the hells all that shit Are you goin to Burning Man Aw that was the take Dude that was the fucking Jam dude And

sounded m outta here m taking a break Yeah take a break Fuck When you look at the math here its four days and we still havent completed one track its four days and we still havent completed one track You gotta go and talk to your guys and my deal is tomorrow we dont work Its over Day off Day off We stop collect it get it together No more bullshit And come day after tomorrow m going to bring in a guy and these guys are going to talk to this man What do you mean therapist Youre going to bring in a therapist Yeah guy who will let these guys learn how to communicate Its been suggested a time or two that we bring in a therapist to or a mediator to various groups that was working with to see if they can straighten out some of the horse shit do a lot of group therapy ve work with many different groups on social harmonology which is my field of expertise Great art comes about because of tension mean you look at bands like The Police those guys were from what hear those guys were fighting all the time and they made great music The Everly Brothers heard they didnt even hardly talk to each other and you know couldnt name any of their songs but that was great stuff Thats the difference they fought each other but they didnt attack each other And have there been some attacks going on here Well yeah mean yeah there has been Mei yesterday was absolutely felt like Hitler at Waterloo yesterday Wow was was It was actually the day before yesterday d love to just go on that journey with them from where they are right now out here to the studio right up to who knows where The Grammys or the Music Awards or whatever the kids are uh you know want to make a record You want to use my pad here We agree on that Yes want to make a record All right think thats a big breakthrough right there Dont you think No If had a girlfriend wouldnt be bringing her in you know You dont see me bringing in people You dont see me bringing in my bitches What do you mean bitches Well whatever m just telling you Mei is not a girlfriend dude Well l Mei is like youre saying to me hey you shouldnt bring your spleen into the recording studio thats what your saying to me Oh leave your lower intestine at home you dont need it Thats what youre saying to me think we are saying that You guys are just talking silly stuff m a tolerant man but ve had enough of this Well well take a You know what maybe um Because m really m sitting here m ready to talk He bent it Okay Steven Were here to talk This is going to sound crazy but ve always wanted blonde hair Why dont we take a few minutes break actually think that would be best Okay think it has some good longterm potential for me and for my practice Well ve been looking at a boat to buy a boat m not saying this is going to give me the Its a goodlooking boat Its a house boat but its dont want to go into detail just think this is going to really help the room Its going to help clear the space for us to express ourselves to open up with each other Herschel
