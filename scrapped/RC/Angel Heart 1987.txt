crowd did it for my daughter Some sort of hocuspocus she and Johnny were fooling with She was obsessed know found a mummified hand in her room The hand of glory Its supposed to open any lock It was the right hand of a murderer cut off while his neck was in the noose Thats what Margaret believed Black magic Black white whats the difference Margaret was always Evil Evil as a dunghill Everyone

execution introduced Johnny Favorite to my daughter watched him conjure up Lucifer in my home He was deeper in it than me He made a pact with Satan He sold his soul You expect me to swallow that dont give a damn Thats a crock of shit you lying toad He sold his soul for stardom For stardom Satan rose from the depths But he tried to outwit the Prince of Darkness When he made it big he tried to duck out of it Thats a crock of shit Johnny found an obscure rite in an ancient manuscript He needed a victim Someone his own age Why To steal their soul Toots and Johnny picked up a young soldier Who Just a soldier celebrating New Years Eve in New York They took him back to Johnnys hotel where they had the ceremony What ceremony The boy was bound naked on a rubber mat there were complicated incantations pentacle was branded on his chest Margaret gave Johnny a virgin dagger He sliced the boy clean open and ate his heart It was still beating when he wolfed it down Johnny wanted to become that soldier Before he had worked it out he was drafted injured and sent home without even knowing who he was Who was the boy Only Johnny knew He put the dog tags in a vase and gave it to Margaret It was Margarets plan to drop him off in Times Square The last place he remembered before it happened He needed a victim Someone his own age To steal their soul He sliced the boy clean open and he ate his heart Who was the boy Johnny wanted to be the soldier Maybe he gained the guys soul but he still looked like Johnny to me know who am Alas How terrible is wisdom if it brings no profit to the wise Johnny Louis Cyphre Lucifer Even your name is a dime store joke Mephistopheles is such a mouthful in Manhattan Johnny Do you think posing as the devil just because it scared a superstitious old guitar player and that witch and that nutty old man do you think its going to scare me It aint because know who am You killed them and youre trying to pin it on me know who am If had cloven hooves and a tail
