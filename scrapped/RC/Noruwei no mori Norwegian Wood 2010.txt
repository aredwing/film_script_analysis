Hey give it Naoko and Kizuki had been close almost from birth Because Kizuki was my best friend the three of us did things together lost ll pay for the game After Kizuki died there was a vague knot of air inside me wanted to get away from this town wanted to begin a new life where didnt know a soul and forget everything The chain reaction of unrequited love and its tragic consequences is the core of the story of Andromache We want permission to use the remaining time to debate this The world is drowning in problems more profound than Greek tragedy cant imagine anything is more profound than Greek tragedy but suit yourselves For a while after moved to Tokyo reading was all that mattered to me My life felt like it was on hold as empty as the margins of the books read so avidly Thats Yen Watanabe its already am Instead of staying up all night reading why dont you go to bed early and just get up and exercise with me Nagasawa Is it true youve slept with a hundred girls Dont exaggerate More like at the most ve only slept with one Come with me next time Dont worry its easy had a definite interest in the strange complex aspects of Nagasawas nature along with his sophistication Excuse me Life is too short Dont waste valuable time reading any book that has not had the baptism of time Shall we make a toast He was both a spirit of amazing nobility and an irredeemably materialistic man was sitting over there What are you doing in Tokyo What am doing Lets walk a little Have you been well You dont talk much cant say what want to say well Sorry Dont worry dont talk much either Where are we Komagome We made this big circle Youre really tough Surprised Yeah Can call you This Saturday Of course Every Sunday we met and walked walking with no destination in mind As if walking were a religious ritual to heal our wounded spirits We continued to avoid any mention of the past Certainly Kizukis name never came up in our conversations Can look You can look Its cute Ready Oh sorry Wait just a minute Go ahead For you For me Right Thank you Youre welcome Can open it Of course dont know Its stupid being m just not ready It feels weird Like somebodys pushing me from behind ve got seven months to get ready ll take my time Youre so lucky still being think that people should just go back and forth between and Go to when is over and back to when is over That way things would be easier Is this your first time You didnt sleep with Kizuki Why m sorry shouldnt have asked m sorry have to go Will you call me again When her apartment manager told me Naoko had moved was stunned wrote her a long letter and sent it to her home in Kobe Wherever she was was certain they would forward it to her On your birthday probably should not have done what did What felt for you was something never experienced before need you to answer me At least let me know whether ve hurt you or not Watanabe Trim your nose hair Its really dirty You know were late know So what Hurry up Youre such trouble

how to relate to other people didnt even know what it means to love someone Naoko Time to confess What were you two doing Going out at that hour coming back nearly naked cant tell you We did it But it didnt work What do you mean Watanabe was too big for me He didnt fit inside me Its been seven years since the last time so was all stuffed up That was the dream Reiko had the night before you came You

someone else cant do this Please stop But you dont stop Then you show it to me Your thing sticking way up Thats what you want to do now Thats right Do all the guys in here masturbate Probably Can you

you again Sure What happened to your hand just got hurt at work see passed The Foreign Ministry exam Congratulations Youre going abroad right The first year is training here Then ll be abroad for a while What are your plans for Hatsumi Youll be abroad for years What will happen to her Thats her business not mine What do you mean Look m not planning to marry anyone and made that perfectly clear to Hatsumi So If Hatsumi wants to marry somebody she should go ahead If she wants to wait for me she can Thats what mean You think m a shit dont you Yes ll bring her along next time Talk to her m sure youll like her Its a waste of time m too poor to go out with girls from your school Dont be silly Shes a nice natural girl My school cafeteria has three lunches and lunch is Yen is Yen is Yen When eat the lunch everybody gives me dirty looks You still think can talk to her Just meet her You dont have to screw her should say not You cant do that shes still a virgin Watanabes in love with a girl But he wont say a word about her Really But m not hiding anything Its just that the situation is complicated and hard to talk about What a shame we could have gone on double dates We could have got drunk and swapped Dont be awful Nothings awful Right We swapped girls once Watanabe Did you Go ahead tell her d like to hear that story It sounds very interesting We were drunk Thats all right m not blaming you just want you to tell me the story The two of us were drinking in a bar and got friendly with this pair of girls They went to a junior college They were pretty plastered too So anyway we went to a hotel and slept with them Nagasawas room was right next door to mine Nagasawa knocked on my door in the middle of the night and said we should exchange girls so went to his room and he went to mine Was it fun Not especially So why did you do that suggested it m asking Watanabe Why did you do that Sometimes really want to sleep with a girl You know Watanabe dont know how complicated it is but that kind of behaviour isnt of your style It isnt right for you What do you think feel that way too sometimes So why dont you stop Let me summarise Watanabes got this girl he likes but cant get any because of complications So he tells himself sex is sex and satisfies his needs elsewhere But if you really love her shouldnt you be able to control yourself Maybe so Its just a game Doesnt even count as cheating Nobody gets hurt get hurt Why am not enough for you Its not that youre not enough for me Hey What do you think about Nagasawa and me It doesnt matter what think Its all right Tell me exactly what you think If were you d leave him The way he lives it never crosses his mind to make himself happy or to make others happy You seem like you could be happy with just about anyone How did you end up with Nagasawa of all people Things like that just happen Theres not much you can do about it You love him that much do It must be wonderful to be so sure you love someone After Nagasawa was posted to Germany Hatsumi married some man Then two years later she slit her wrists with a razor and died Sorry about the other night Never mind made up with Hatsumi m not surprised She told me you told her to leave me Isnt that what you wanted me to tell her Phone for you Watanabe Excuse me Sorry m late What are you drinking Tom Collins whiskey and soda What happened hurt myself at work Where were you Nara and Aomori Had a hard time with the funeral No were used to them My sister and have worked so hard we decided to do whatever we wanted decided d take my boyfriend to Nara and screw like crazy So did you screw like crazy No not even once My period started the minute we got to our hotel room Its not funny was a whole week early It was pathetic Both he and had been about to explode So we had a big fight and havent seen him since came back to Tokyo and then went to Aomori Have you ever been Never And you know while was travelling by myself kept thinking about you wishing that you were beside me How come What do you mean how come How come you were thinking about me Because like you Why else What other reason is there But youve got a boyfriend You dont have to think about me Dont be so mean Watanabe do you know what want to do now Come on Remember where we are never dreamed youd answer me like that Midori answer the phone Its fine Are you seeing someone in Tokyo No If you do please tell me Of course Oh look But Reiko still doesnt eat much just smokes one cigarette after another There isnt much gardening to do at this time of year The birds and rabbits are doing fine We hunt for mushrooms and pick chestnuts to eat Every day its rice with chestnuts or mushrooms but its so delicious never tire of it get confused by most things that come from the outside But your descriptions of the world around you give me wonderful relief Its so strange wonder why Midori sounds like an interesting person Reading your letter got the feeling she might be in love with you Happy birthday hope you have a happy year being years old My own year of being will probably end miserably hope you can be happy enough for me too Reiko and knitted this scarf together The good half is Reikos the bad half is mine Will you come and see me when it starts to snow No cant Please stop Please Why do you care for me You shouldnt be involved with me you should live your own life But youre Youre wrong Thats not what think Dont you think youre lying to yourself Leave me alone Its what you should have done on my birthday Dont touch me You are crazy Dont touch me Calm down Go away Dont touch me Calm down Your presence is painful Why dont you understand Naoko calm down m thinking of leaving the dorm and finding an apartment If get more parttime work can cover my expenses How would you like to live with me Thank you It makes me so happy that you asked me that This isnt somewhere you should stay too long Think it over m moving as soon as possible anyway Any time you want to join me you can Why cant get wet It only happened that once Why cant Its only psychological Give it time Dont worry about it What if never get wet again and cant ever have sex Would you still be able to love me At heart m an optimistic person ll come back to see you after ve moved Think it over See you thought d get out of here before you Mind if give you a piece of advice Sure Dont feel sorry for yourself Only degenerates feel sorry for themselves ll keep it in mind It must have been difficult for you too waiting for her letter But this month has been just as difficult for Naoko She has slowly started hearing voices again She has trouble just having ordinary conversations now She doesnt want to see you in her current state Hey want to talk to you have plans It wont take long Just five minutes dont want to talk to you sorry To tell you the truth its getting increasingly difficult to control Naoko have to watch her constantly The voices shes hearing are getting worse Shes shutting out the whole world going deep inside herself Kizuki Naoko Hey Kizuki Unlike you ve chosen to live And to live the best way can m sure it was hard for you But its hard for me too Because you killed yourself leaving Naoko behind But will never abandon her The reason is love her m going to grow stronger m going to grow up Lets go talked with him after saw you at the bar that night and broke up with him like you From the bottom of my heart But theres nothing can do right now Because of her Yes Tell me Have you slept with her Just once last year Havent you seen her since saw her twice But we didnt do anything Why not Isnt she in love with you Thats hard to say Its really complicated What do know is have a certain responsibility which cant just abandon Even if she isnt in love with me Even if she isnt in love with you need time am sorry but thats all can say now All right ll wait Because trust you But when you take me take only me When you hold me think only about me Do you understand me Very well And you can do whatever you want to me but dont hurt me ve already been hurt enough in my life dont want to be hurt any more want to be happy Hold me Naoko died Nothing can heal the loss of a beloved No truth no sincerity no strength no kindness can heal that sorrow All we can do is live through the sorrow and learn something from it But whatever we learn will be of no help in facing the next sorrow to come along You were planning to live with Naoko here need to wash up Please remember me forever Please always remember that existed and was here by your side Will you promise promise ll always remember What are your plans m going to Asahikawa friend from college runs a music school there Arent you going to see your husband and daughter Hey Watanabe Do people fall in love
