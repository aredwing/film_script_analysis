Long ago and far away in a village high on a mountaintop something amazing was occurring At the very same moment two identical baby girls were born One a baby Princess The King and Queen were overjoyed Princess Anneliese would have only the finest The second baby girl was named Erika Her parents loved her every bit as much as the King and Queen loved the Princess But they worried They were so poor How would they be able to care for their little daughter Many years passed The Princess learned her royal duties while Erika worked long and hard as a seamstress for the spiteful Madame Carp With lives so different it wasnt surprising that the Princess and the Pauper never met But fate decreed they would It all started at the Royal Mine When the miners informed the Queen the gold had run out The widowed Queen was shocked The Kingdom was no bankrupt How was she going to take care of her people If only she could call on her trusted advisor Preminger But he was away on a long journey She needed to do something quickly to save the Kingdom But what And then it struck her Nearby lived a rich young King who was seeking a wife Oh Were late late late We have maximum minutes for your royal fitting Then its move move move Your speech at the Historical Society After that we have the rush And mean rush to the Horicortural Society Tea And then theres your math lessons your geography lessons
