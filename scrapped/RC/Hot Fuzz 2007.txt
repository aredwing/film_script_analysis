Officer Yes you were Mr Blower Well now you see we are staging a homage to William Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet and m a little late for the dress rehearsal m playing the eponymous hero you see Romeo

explain why might have exceeded the speed limit Youre playing the male lead in a homage to William Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet and youre late for the dress rehearsal You think this is sufficient reason to travel at in a zone Well To flout speed limits specifically put in place to save lives Just look this is preposterous Preposterous Look just stop writing Stop writing Look youre right apologize See what did there You hypnotized him No used this This is the most important piece of equipment you will ever own This notebook has saved my skin more times than care to mention You should

portrayed a cadaver in Prime Suspect Sergeant Angel you came So thrilled you accepted my invitation Well our Inspector requested we attend So Yeah we cant accept gifts from someone weve officially rebuked so Jog on Congratulations to you and to Mrs Blower Oh this is not my wife This is Miss Draper My leading lady Eve works in the local council Sergeant Quite the lady in the know am not Nonsense m sure if we bashed your head in all sorts of secrets would come tumbling out Romeo Romeo a pint of bitter for Romeo Thank you very much for coming George Excuse us pleasure my liege Eves nice aint she She certainly has a distinctive laugh She was in my year at school Always had a thing for her She clearly has a thing for older men What with Martin Blower No way We just sat through three hours of socalled acting Constable their kiss was the only convincing moment in it Hey now you come to mention it too have reason to believe she favors the older gent Really How so Marcus Carters big brother said hed fingered her up the duck pond Oh Officers Again let me extend my sincere apologies for earlier Thats quite all right Mr Blower Drive safe Drive safe Oh my God You know thats the bloke we done for speeding earlier Yeah Hopefully thats the last well see of him Who is it We havent got long To us Who is it Yeah decaffeinated Decaffeinated Little Brian Libby found them out on his paper round Oh hell be having nightmares for a while Must have hit the sign at some speed Took the whole top off ve had my top off in this layby Tits Most likely lost control left the road there and then ended up here So what do we reckon Sergeant Angel Well we should get a proper cordon off screen the remains from public view Close down the road until the ambulance crew arrives whereupon we should open a single lane of traffic and ease congestion Very good What he said What happened Danny Car accident Nasty way to go Constable official vocab guidelines state we no longer refer to these incidents as accidents theyre now collisions Right For never was there a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo Excuse me Martin and Eve Such a tragedy Mr Skinner do you mind telling me how you know the identity of the persons involved You know how it is News travels fast love struck Romeo sings a streetsus serenade What happened Danny Traffic collision Hey why cant we say accident again Because accident implies theres nobody to blame Put a sock in it town mouse Yeah you wanna be a big cop in a small town fuck off up the model village m just saying things arent always as simple as they look Most times they are Lets just wait till Doctor Hatcher comes back with something before you go jumping the Kalashnikov All right in the meantime why dont you check out a few of Martin Blowers clients Martin Blower represents damn near most of the village Did you want us to go through the whole phone book Yeah or put a call into Aaron Aaronson shall we Please dont be childish At least consider interviewing the widow Martin Blower was clearly having an affair with Eve Draper Oh and how did you establish that Cause we sat through three hours of socalled acting last night and the kiss was the only convincing moment in it All right pipe down big one Here what else you got Crockett and Tubby Skid marks Now whos being childish There were no skid marks at the scene Doesnt it seem a little strange that Martin Blower would lose control of his car and not think to apply the brakes If there were no skid marks it follows that for yards both driver and passenger did nothing to prevent their fate You dont have to be a detective to work that out Yeah Are you causing trouble Yes they are Well a spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm Old Arthur Webleys been clipping hedgerows that dont belong to him Yes sir Thats it Yes sir Why do we need the dog Its not the dog we need Right What did he say What did he say He said An edge is an edge He only chopped it down cause it spoilt his

What made you wanna be a policemanofficer dont remember a time when didnt wanna be a police officer Apart from the summer of when wanted to be Kermit the Frog It all started with my Uncle Derek He was a Sergeant in the Met He bought me a police pedal car when was five rode round in it every second was awake Arresting kids twice my size for littering and spitting got beaten up a lot when was young but it didnt stop me wanted to be like Uncle Derek He sounds like a good bloke Actually he was arrested for selling drugs to students What a cunt Probably bought the pedal car with the proceeds Needless to say never went near it again just let it rust But never forgot the clear sense of right and wrong that felt at the wheel of that pedal car had to prove to myself that the law could be proper and righteous and for the good of humankind It was from that moment was destined to be a police officer Shame How so think you wouldve made a great muppet What about you What made you wanna become a police officer dont know Dad does it think after my mum died its what he wanted you know keep me close by Do you mind if ask how she died Traffic collision m sorry Never mind Hey watch this

and mayhem and not incur a considerable amount of paperwork That is nothing man This is about to go off This shit just got real Nasty way to go think our Mr Merchant tried to have a little fry up and left the gas on Spends his whole life devoted to the refrigerator then gets killed by an oven told him several times you shouldnt eat late at night Oh dont know quite like a little midnight gobble

see the manager please Mr Skinner to the Managers office Managers office Mr Skinner Sergeant Angel And to what do owe this pleasure Simon Skinner m arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Leslie Tiller Leslie Tillers dead How She tripped and fell on her own shears m also arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Tim Messenger on May st of George Merchant on April th and of Eve Draper and Martin Blower on April th Why on earth would do that Sergeant m glad you asked My suspicions were first aroused when you appeared at the scene of the BlowerDraper death on the outskirts of Sandford despite the fact you live and work in the center of the village couldnt help but recall your comments at the theater on the previous evening When you not only indicated an awareness of the couples affair but also inferred that Eves connections at the council might make her privy to important information You even spoke of bashing her head in Perhaps hoping you might discover the route of the proposed Sandford Bypass You were already suspicious that George Merchant was buying up a large area of land on the outskirts of Sandford after an article Tim Messenger wrote in the Sandford Citizen You see the land Merchant was buying had little value in of itself but if it became accessible by road it would be a prime location for say a retail park Consumed with concern for your business and potential disloyalty from fickle customers you yourself expressed a wish to behead You killed the competition in cold blood Staging the murders as accidents You used a vehicle removal truck to stage the BlowerDraper death and incinerated an old man in his own house Covering your tracks with the judicial application of bacon and beans However there was a loose end Tim Messenger Splattered before he could share with me what he told Leslie Tiller that very afternoon The true value of her land Upon discovering she was about to sell up to the developers you brutally murdered her with her own shears And made good your escape utilizing your impressive skills as a fun runner Very entertaining But rather think youve been watching too many films He hasnt Why would kill Leslie You clearly arent aware that were related Oh but am Cousin Sissy m afraid my nickname of Sissy is only a revelation to yourself My teenage years studying ballet are well known Yeah Sissy Skinner What a Gaylord Thank you Andrews Now despite my comments about beheading customers personally relish the competition of another store Anything to energize my workforce And anyway what makes you think could dislodge part of the church roof Or for that matter stage a car crash Its a well known fact that the church roof is in dire need of repair And isnt it true that two of your own employees operate the vehicle removal service for the council Sergeant this is the st Century Many people hold down several jobs myself host a life drawing class at the Village Hall Tina here is a table dancer at Flappers Nevertheless you could have utilized the vehicle removal truck for your own ends These accusations are quite meaningless Sergeant unless you can back them up with hard evidence Well youve got me there d need something conclusive Something that placed you at the scene of the crime Perhaps a wound you sustained on a piece of broken glass this very evening This very evening Sergeant this is beginning to get embarrassing How could possibly be in several places at once m sure the stores security footage will absolve me Do feel free to spool through can handle this Danny You might as well go back and just enjoy the rest of your birthday Did you really get me that plant Yes did But its been impounded as evidence Well mean maybe Dad will still let me water it eh Yeah Sergeant wanted you to know that if do indeed now own the land belonging to belonging to Leslie that intend to turn it into a memorial garden in her honor Mr Skinner what you do with your land is of no concern of mine so jog on Michael will you escort the Sergeant off the premises when hes quite finished Yarp just cant believe Leslies dead How did it happen She tripped and fell on her own shears Hey that werent me Hey look Look Mr Treachers got his big coat on again You want anything from the shop Cornetto No luck catching them killers then Its just the one killer actually No luck catching them killers then Its just the one

Maybe there are others Nicholas youre an exceptional officer But ve seen this before Sir Sergeant Popwell It was exactly the same thing Youve come from a city where theres danger round every corner and its driven you round the bend Yes sir Do yourself a favor Sleep on it And if you still feel the same in the morning give you my word ll get right on to it Hey Hey whats happening Whats going on Nothing nothing m just gonna go back to the hotel mean do you want a lift No no could do with a walk Hey big one playtimes over Michael Michael Are you there Michael Is everything okay Yarp Sergeant

places at once How could possibly be in several places at once just cant believe Leslies dead How did it happen Youll find that we run a very tight ship here Who could do something like this Seems like Mr Merchant tried to have a little fry up and left the gas on Nasty way to go What happened Danny No luck catching them killers then No luck catching them killers then No luck catching them Now quick announcement before we begin Janet Barker has decided to call her boys Roger and Martin And the christening will be a week on Saturday and were all invited Tom Thanks Joyce Now youll all be delighted to hear that the tenacious Sergeant Angel has been taken care of Joyce will discover the Sergeant lying on the wet floor of his bathroom having slipped and tragically broken his neck So with the dispatch of the Sergeant we will now be able to concentrate on the eradication of our hoodie infestation Quite right After which nothing will stand in our way Oh beg to differ Mr Weaver Well well well see we have visitors Sergeant Nicholas Angel Sandford Police Service My he is tenacious isnt he m arresting you under suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder Oh come come Sergeant You should be ashamed Calling yourself a community that cares Oh but we do care Nicholas Its all about the greater good The greater good How can this be for the greater good The greater good You see as much as enjoyed your wild theories Sergeant the truth is far less complex Blowers fate was simply the result of his being an appalling actor Quite appalling You murdered him for that Well he murdered Bill Shakespeare What The Dramatic Society is an important feather in our cap Couldnt let Blower jeopardize that Not when we had two semiprofessionals waiting in the wings Lets not forget that Greg was an extra in Straw Dogs And Sheree played a cadaver in Prime Suspect Yes know Martin was less concerned with the reputation of the village than he was with his sordid affair with Eve Draper And so Eve deserved to die too Well she did have a very annoying laugh Annoying And and George Merchant He had an awful house Awful We begged him in vain to make his residence more in keeping with the villages rustic esthetic And what about Tim Messenger What was his crime Tim Messengers tenure as editor of the Sandford Citizen has been unbearable Our once great paper had become riddled with tabloid journalism Not to mention persistent errors He listed her age as When actually m Fiftythree What what about Leslie Tiller One of your own Her horticultural expertise helped put Sandford on the map Oh she was ever so good Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame But it seemed she was set on moving away We couldnt have her sharing her green fingers with anybody else Not least those heathens at Buford Abbey If we cant have her no one can How can this be for the greater good The greater good Shut it These people died for no reason No reason whatsoever Oh wouldnt say that Hello Nicholas was like you once believed in the immutable word of the law That is until the night Mrs Butterman was taken from me You see no one loved Sandford more than her She was head of the Womens Institute chair of the floral committee When they started the Village of the Year contest she worked round the clock ve never seen such dedication On the eve of the adjudicators arrival some travelers moved into Callahan Park Before you could say Gypsy scum we were kneedeep in dog muck thieving kids and crusty jugglers Crusty jugglers We lost the title and Irene lost her mind She drove her Datsun Cherry into Sandford Gorge From that moment on swore that would do her proud And whatever the cost we would make Sandford great again Sir this doesnt make any sense The adjudicators arrive tomorrow We had to get everything ready Are you saying this is all about winning the Best Village Award This is the best village Nicholas Youve seen the people Theyre happy contented Theyre living in a dream world Sergeant Popwell thought much the same as you m disappointed you cant see the bigger picture Well m happy to disappoint you sir And m afraid youre gonna have to come with me You are all gonna have to come with me No Nicholas m afraid it is you who is going to have to come with us Danny no Back off Back off Or swear to God youll be explaining how Danny tripped over and accidentally cut off his own head Come on Nicholas You havent got it in you mean it Shit Gypsy scum Travelers Thieving kids Dog muck Crusty jugglers Crusty jugglers Crusty jugglers Crusty jugglers There hasnt been a recorded murder in
