On April th units of the nd Squadron of the Royal Air Force crossed the boundary of Germany under the command of Canadian squadron leader Ted Stryker Their mission Penetrate enemy fighter cover and hold the formation intact for a vital incendiary raid on the German supply depots of Wiesbaden At miles from the target enemy fighters were sighted directly ahead Stryker led his planes to meet them Using the thick fog banks below as a cover the Spitfires eluded the remaining German fighters and reformed for the initial run on the target Although Strykers weather reports had indicated Wiesbaden would be clear the fog had closed in over the entire area There were two possible decisions Pass up the vital target for less important alternate to the south or maintain the descent relying on instruments and a possible break in the fog near the ground level Stryker went for the vital target Too late he realized his mistake Blinded by the fog six of Strykers men crashed into the German countryside Five weeks later the war in Europe was over But for squadron leader Stryker seriously wounded in the course of the raid a new kind of war just beginning Its closed in Ted What about the alternate target Cant see anything Think were off course Were on course Were too low Ted Were too low It seems to be heaIing very niceIy everything considered Pressure on the optic nerve is aImost
