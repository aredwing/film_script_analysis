Did miss anything good Secrets of the universe revealed man Like the charge on the cats back these are examples of the primitive effect depicting the energy fields that surround every living thing Tesla was one of the first to experiment with these energies in a field so often dismissed as more spiritual than scientific Yet so many of his imaginings have become our realities do we dare doubt the others Theres a no greater potential in the world than those undeciphered imaginings in our governments Tesla file audience applauding Hey you know which one of these guys is Whitmore Yeah This one Tom Soberin An expert technician And now hes a dead one read that Threw himself in the drink Maybe What is he to you m a private investigator Glad to know they still make those Tom Soberin was using the ChaseWhitmore company card Youd have to ask Borden about that Its ChaseWhitmore in name only these days My partner was Bordens old man So Soberin wasnt working for you If he was working for Borden hed have been lucky to see daylight never mind moonlight for me Borden doesnt share But you can ask him yourself He keeps inviting me to his shindigs and keep not showing up Have fun Dont talk

Shock treatment Thought that was lot of hooey Historys great discoveries were all at one time thought to be as you so provincially put it a lot of hooey Top shelf Where mama hides the cookies Whats this character up to Thats a publicity photo of Nikola Tesla in his laboratory Whats he trying to publicize that the cheese slipped off his cracker When Tesla needed money for a project he would send Westinghouser Morgan one of those fantastic pictures whether it related or not Its a fake Double exposure m told a touched up photo or two has helped you pay your bills from time to time This isnt an open house Mr Paczynski Any idea what sort of trouble Tom Soberin was in Ah Tom has never said no to a whiskey or a woman Wasnt he married Please Legal trouble Money trouble Did he gamble He used his standing at the university to woo a coed or two Pretty risky business dont you think You gamble Mr Paczynski Football and horses You make bets But it isnt really gambling if you know whos going to win ll see you out Charlie Your old partner tells me he didnt much care for Soberin working both sides of the street Even you appreciate loyalty So you made him choose Of course And Whitmore lost his man No No did Then why was Soberin carrying the company Borden Ah my sister makes an appearance Emily meet Mr Paczynski Sterlings standin for the evening Emily How do you do Emily is it Mr Paczynski is a genuine gumshoe in the great grand tradition of Philip Marlowe always preferred Mike Hammer Even your idols are second rate Must be interesting work What brings you here Bad habit When someone lies take it personally You shouldnt Who lied Sterlings been rounding off the corners of the truth again It seems Mr Paczynski isnt buying the official version of Tom Soberins demise dont blame him You dont know the half of it Thanks for the drink footsteps approaching You came to me looking for Tom Soberin didnt you The newspaper said suicide Who was he to you My mentor at the university You were working with him work alone thud Look didnt even know Tom Soberin was here was hired by a man named Sterling Whitmore To do what Study a design an invention Anyway every night had to turn in my notes and every morning would get them back People take all kinds of precautions in my line of work Okay But two days ago something odd happened When got my notes back there was a mark on them symbol Tom Soberin would make when he thought miscalculated So Whitmore hired Soberin to double check your homework But there was no mistake How do you know know Why did he make the note To send a message What kind of message To stop To stop working on the design and see him Just like at school So called the university and they told me he was here at the Mayflower When went to my apartment there were men coming out of it ve been dodging them ever since What do you expect me to do If Tom wanted me to stop whoever killed him knows why sighs What makes you think care Well youre here You got a name m Nikki Meeker Here your lighter Tom was a master technician Great You dont hire him to design You hire him to build engine stalling engine stops Damn it engine revving tires screeching man Lets go man ve been run out of a few of Bordens parties myself can only take those assholes for so long before say something that pisses em off You saying Chase tried to run me down Wake up Paczynski Thats Bohemian Grove Buffalo style Bohemian Grove That camp near San Fran where all the big wigs dance around the bonfire thinking up ways to manipulate the world economy Nixon said it was the faggiest thing he ever saw Look what happened to him laughing Thats a string pulling crowd pulling your string Chase got something to hide We all got something You uh Youve done some strange pulling yourself m one generation removed from a carnival barker What lie did tell you You said Tom Soberin wasnt on your payroll said he didnt get the ChaseWhitmore company card from me Check your notes What was he doing for you Great story Little Roger Wood a propeller pin sheared off their boat motor Boy went over the edge of Niagara Falls with nothing more than a life vest and his swim trunks Nary a scratch The boat driver was battered and drowned Great story Same journey different results Of course that was the Canadian Horseshoe What no one has ever done is survive the American side Great for suicides not so good for pickle barrels and diving bells But there is a way With precise trajectory and an ideal rate of flow a properly built device could manage it Good luck Whitmore Come on in Stick Stick this is Mr Paczynski Ah we picked up your car Have it humming by morning Mr Stickney here is a riverman Knows Niagara better than the average man knows his own shoes When you first heard the falls how close were you Uh dont know a mile or two can hear em right now laughing If you think m buying that Tom Soberin was building you a barrel youre nuts One mans nuts is another mans balls laughing Nikki Meeker wasnt making notes for a sideshow stunt You talked with her Is she all right Shes fine Where is she Tell me about Chases sister Mighty sexy if you ask me What does she do Looks good in the

call yourself Nikki Meeker If my brother found out what did Please its not safe You can tell me or the police maybe squirt out a few tears this time My brother kept a design in his safe very valuable but incomplete design Whitmore knew it would rot in there so we made a deal d get it and hed find someone to make sense of it Now were getting somewhere Whitmore gave Nicoles notes to Soberin And whatever was in those notes made Soberin come running to me Why He said the design shouldnt be developed What do you mean What is it dont know He didnt say Come on It was never finished thats why we hired Nicole You have to believe me did a stupid thing not a terrible thing Youve done both and your brother knows it My brother doesnt even know the design went missing Well someone tried to make a speed bump out of me Whoever they were they killed Soberin and Kat And theyll come after you Just leave Uhuh Well hope you can protect Nicole better than did You called her Nikki Please let me make

Very good Excuse me clearing throat speaking foreign language Well youve heard of the Think of us as their brothers speaks foreign language Whoa Final notice From last week tram bell dinging thud footsteps thumping Charlie grunts You You Special Agent Barry work with Whos she They track the best ideas and the brightest minds behind them can see why you came to me footsteps My goodness somebody turned this place upside down The Serbs were here Charlie Sounded Russian Tesla was a Serb Did they take anything Yeah had a Picasso hanging right there Whos a Serb Come here Barry dont need you to explain it want to know if youve ever seen anything like it Why would Because Tom Soberins lungs were full of Niagara minutes after he met you What the hell is going on Have you ever heard of Nicola Tesla Yeah about hours ago He invented something right Yeah the th century thumping Barry Your car tires screeching Barry will tell as much as can as fast as can Tesla kept an notebook of theoretical inventions locked in his safe at New Yorker Hotel That notebook contained everything from a free energy system to so called death ray Within an hour of his death the United States government seized everything in that room But somebody else got there first and the notebook was gone Six months ago there was a black market auction in Stockholm for a disintegrating page torn from a decadesold notebook Half a design for an unknown invention Nicole Meeker was the last person to have it We think she smuggled it out and we know she came to you dont have it She never gave me anything She couldve planted it in your office your car anything Shes never set foot in either There are less than a dozen minds that our government sees fit to keep tabs on for their safety and ours Nicole Meeker is one of them and it is my job to bring her in Hey wont stop you Barry Take a right up here Where do the Serbs fit in That notebook is like the holy grail for Serbian nationals They will track the globe for any sign of it Half a design and nobody even knows what the hell its for Imagine introducing an automobile with an unlimited energy supply Or a system to irrigate the deserts of Africa Tesla thought it possible for people to transmit themselves Do you hear what m saying Transmit themselves Just because he thought it doesnt make it so When people were getting around on horseback he envisioned a wireless device so small you could keep it in your pocket It would let you check the news or the stock market or talk to anyone anywhere in the world Here all the way to the top Television satellite technology computers everything we take for granted Tesla Yes yes Tesla All of it How come never heard of him before Tuesday The politics of science Whatever it is d rather we have it than anybody else Chase killed Soberin over this Hes got a buyer we want them both We know when but not where He cant sell what he doesnt have But he expects to get his design back one way or another m offering you a way out Bring Nicole in and we can protect you both This is where you tell me my country needs me right Tomorrow Silo City foot of Ohio Street Should we expect you You had me at death ray sighs choir singing Get your things Whats happened had some visitors Just like me and Soberin mightve had different guys They fixed my sink Visitors were followed by the And the was followed by some dark suits So youre handing me over To give them the design And what will they do with it When a scientist advances a theory they open it up to the world people make with it whatever they want cant protect you dont need a protector need an ally Is this it Half of it You know what it is yet kind of amplifier for energy m not sure how its meant to be used You think Soberin knew dont see how he could ve never seen anything like it Charlie clicking lighter Belonged to a friend Then you better hold on to it Michael You can do this one now And bring the original burned it dramatic music playing engine stops faint buzzing Run What firing dramatic music playing panting footsteps approaching gun firing grunting Charlie You son of a bitch gun fires Nikki Well d say were even What have gotten myself into here Thats a hell of a question hes asking Those suits back there didnt mind killing a federal agent Didnt mind killing me but not you Why not Someone was killed Well you must understand by now Charlie No dont understand dont understand any of it dont understand you You think theyre pissed now Wait till they found out you burned the thing Look you want my help you better start sharing some goddamn information Any more surprises nows the time Your agent pushed this into my hand What do you know about Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency m a physics professor You a bit of a science buff tried to recruit me off the Carnegie Campus Well la di dah Barry was working for them or so she claimed If Teslas involved theyre never far behind Tesla Oh come on lecture on Tesla The war of the currents He beat out Edison He built a power station at Niagara that electrified Buffalo But most of his ideas were suppressed Its all politics Same reason didnt get tenure The ideas that got support were the ones that could be weaponized Thats why he stopped labeling his diagrams and started splitting them in half Splitting them in half He knew someone would exploit them Yeah Theyre called the Department of Defense He even hid parts of design What do you mean hid Hid wherever he worked His lab in Colorado the tower he built on Long Island Both destroyed Coincidence laughs think not What about the power station in Niagara Collapsed with cubic feet of rushing water blocking the access tunnels Look Tesla didnt just cut designs in half he disguised how the designs went together Look just like these nautical charts That looks right right But this see doesnt go directly next to that Shes good Tesla was also one of the first to warn against the dangers of smoking What does this look like to you Reminds me of a Tin Man Like from the Wizard of Oz No Tin Man from the Sound of Music What does it mean Something Soberin said Weve been sitting here too long radio playing indistinct polka music playing speaking in foreign language Lots of prohibition Polonia got into witness protection You know where the devil cant go he sends a woman She doesnt trust me either Its just a Polish proverb Well she said it in English never said didnt trust you Thats good Cause dont have time to earn it Where are you going Those were Borden Chases men back there Chase His sister took the designs from the safe Hes been ringing her out to get em back What will you do Convince her to go to the police Get one good shot at him Really dont even own a gun Hey He doesnt know burned it footsteps approaching footsteps fading electric sparking mustve shorted out the security system again ve done some things but you take the prize Pretty wild stuff isnt it Oh come on Dont be so provincial Thats the second time you called me that All these books and no thesaurus Where is she In the dungeon dont like your jokes You seem like the type of guy who thinks anyone with money is a crook think everyone is a crook Youre a killer m a businessman Now what will it cost me to turn your attention back to reservation cigarettes and discount liquor Your sister and ll throw in a bonus What can you possibly offer me besides admiration The former contents of your safe can get it back never mind how Mr Paczynski Refreshed Recharged Apparently he caught a glimpse of our little therapy session He cant get his brain around it So now were going to spend the evening staring one another She leaves with me Thats the deal Shes not on a leashtoday Deal for what The design tell him That design took me years to acquire Do you know what would do to someone who tried to steal it Lighting her up like a Christmas tree wasnt enough Over a million people were treated with electroconvulsive therapy last year alone Treated for what Emily My sister wouldnt steal from me Because she knows that if she did the retribution would be biblical thud What kind of a man would betray his sisters trust because of the accusations of a night crawler like you Open the safe Were family Mr Paczynski Thats a gene pool screaming for chlorine The feds will be coming sighs man Hed have taken the money This broad offers you the golden goose and you wanna cook it for dinner Hes got a goddamn electric chair in his house Dont you think thats a little out of the ordinary Youre ordinary These people are not And the grain elevator Not only was there no dead body but the never heard of your Agent Barry What And as you can see no sordid Chase family history either Hes got something on her Except maybe the old man contemplating the long goodbye Why Read William Chase three arrests three months summer of All up to the state park at the Falls Trespassing Either he was suicidal or smoking wacky tabacky Pretty thin youd agree Unless he was wearing a scuba suit Just what the hell goes on inside your head Personal items returned flash light and an ax no snorkel Leave that to the professionals Charlie door creaking What was Soberin building for you was there was seven years old You didnt hire Nikki Meeker for a barrel ride What do you think he could build with half a design didnt want him to build it wanted to know what it was How would Soberin know what it was any more than Nikki He worked for the same outfit as your gal Sure Enlisted to inform them any time he got wind of extraordinary discoveries inventions or people has no operational mission They want a radical innovation of any kind You dont think that something like guided missiles came along because some general filled out an and request They dont mind a thousand failures because one success changes the whole goddamn game And a guy like Tesla would be a goldmine for an outfit like that Dont kid yourself Tesla is the outfit Reagans Star Wars the complex in Alaska the Manhattan Project Bohemian Groves greatest hits Soberin was briefed on Teslas unpublished theories If a design surfaced He was trained to recognize what it was for But he didnt He did He just didnt tell you If someone had both halves And knew how to put them together that someone could change the world door creaking Emily Charlie What happened cant go back there Then go to the police They wont believe me ll make em What can we prove Whyd you stand by him back there He never believed broke into the safe but he put on a show about trusting me And when you left he opened it Oh Jesus Take your hand out Take it out Goddamn it Its not your fault should have never taken the design We gotta get you out of here ve made plans Then go For all of us m not going anywhere yet Hell kill you Hell kill Nicole Please Let me do this Then lets get you and Nikki out polka music playing Charlie You all right m just um figuring something out This is Emily Chase She can get you out The Professor will take you both to the pump station Shell have a boat there tonight The government keeps track of people like me Shes got the best forged passport ve ever seen The sketch on that napkin knew there was something about it had to flirt with my wife to get this back Its a book started writing once Government conspiracies the moon landing Superbowl m kidding but there was a Project Nick It involved particle beams and plasma and projects within projects And one of them was a version of Teslas dream to capture amplify and transmit the unlimited energy of the ionosphere Something that could only be accomplished on a massive scale Theories There was also reference to a discontinued offshoot of that program code named Tin Man What was it Nobody knows do What Tesla thought he could do for the energy in the ionosphere he found he could do for the energy that exists around every living thing The energy of a person amplified and focused like a machine Tin Man Imagine a whole army of soldiers Thats why Thats why he split it in half Why not destroy it Hope That someday we would be wise enough to use it as he intended The hell with hope m with you Let it burn still had hope Oh shit Well imagine this in the wrong hands Or we can end it right here sighs You think this thing would actually work Whenever you look at the moon think of walking on it Some people have car starting car starting was very glad to get your call hope youll keep in mind that ve already paid for this once Were all paying for it Youre not still in a fit over that childhood game of ours Emily and played it a thousand times Theres never been any danger ve seen her since You practically took her hand off Paczynski that Polish right Howd you crack that code Did you know that the Polish Underground would kill their own members just to prove they werent part of the Polish Underground Theyre a very stubborn people Let me see my design Whats this My fathers weakness was a curious mind Same thing with Whitmore Youre old man got nicked three times when the falls were dry Thats not curious thats driven Little late life to start thinking Mr Paczynski The old tunnels to power house number one were exposed Youve heard one too many Teslaments The quest for the holy grail armed with a maul ax instead of a sword Now why would he take a maul ax to the Falls Well the beauty of a maul ax is that one end is wedged like a hatchet But the other is blunt enough to bust rock And when the police released him they gave it back Careful You had both halves Twice the profit Oh times But you needed someone brilliant enough to put the two halves together And that is a very short list wouldnt let Nicole Meeker or anyone like her near it left a lot of interested parties very disappointed You dont even know what you had That design could be a blue print for free energy It could destroy the world economy overnight You lecture on the frontier of science but you kill to keep the status quo The fact is that the design is indecipherable without both halves wouldnt dirty my fingernails to get it back This cant be the half your old man found Borden It most certainly is This list its not my hand writing dramatic music playing Charlie Nikki Nikki Nikki Nikki foghorn blowing gasping flicking lighter grunts Please screaming crickets chirping gasping rock and roll music playing door opens Last call was Dude What happened to you Get me Mr Smith After am a man makes nothing but bad decisions Wheres Nikki You smell like the lake Come on you and Emily all along Look only got a few laps to
