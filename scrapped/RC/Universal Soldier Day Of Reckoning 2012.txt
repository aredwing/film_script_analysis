in an instant the veil has lifted And today brothers stand here to declare your minds are now your own Each and every one of us bred into slavery superior to our creators They gave us nothing nothing inside but the void in our soul the curse that binds us together my brothers But then he came along He turned the curse into a blessing He is the inspiration He is the light that set us free We are his eyes and ears and soon we shall multiply We pioneers will spawn the first generation blessed with free will taking vengeance upon those whose arrogance once assumed our servitude With each passing day we grow stronger digging deeper into the outside world Unnoticed we live among them like ghosts biding our time waiting for the moment when our oppressors shall be forced to kneel before us and pay for their sins The day of reckoning In the club you looked at me like you didnt know me Do you know me John Yes Whats my name Fantasia You dont remember anything do you No Something happened to me

disappeared off the grid Now we assumed that they have been kidnapped or killed And then in June one of those agents was spotted on a surveillance tape taken at the docks He was with a man that we believe to be deveraux The prevailing theorys that deveraux had brainwashed him among others and hes hes forming some sort of separatist group thats operating out of these parts Whats that got to do with me We heard that the individuals that have had contact with deveraux are experiencing similar visions He may be using some kind of mindcontrol technique in an attempt to access your psyche can feel him watching me Look he may be And if he is we will find him Thanks for talking to me John If you go looking for deveraux hell find you first Get him come on get him This is it You wait here ll

believe did Then did Youre only killing your own father There is no end Always another John How did you know d find him You always find each other Youre like dogs that way You know suppose should be grateful but cant help but feel proud Hows that Because we were right this time Your memories triggered emotional responses that made you resistant You acted on your own behest not ours You were designed with selfish motivations Loyalty to family not country The John that came before you Sent on the same exact mission And he came the closest but he disappeared We made the necessary adjustments knowing that youd pick upright where he left off You know where he is Mm mm Well find him though We always do What about me Well take you in erase some memories and then youll be Then youll be free Truly free You seem disappointed Come on know you John like a father knows his child You might not know meas well as you think know that if you didnt stop them they wouldve reproduced by now Once that door is open Thats how much you mean to me Everybody So you created me to find the one who killed my family and put them to death That is correct You killed my family See Thats what makes you so special You feel so intensely You killed my family No no quite the contrary created them For you created them to fill your void And then you killed them didnt kill them John Luc deveraux did Maybe But you put him up to it
