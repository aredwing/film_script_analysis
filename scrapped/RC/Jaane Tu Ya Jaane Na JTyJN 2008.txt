You and have a bond from yore That i Why you make my heart Soar Know it or not Admit it or not Its our groups special song Really Is that why youve been croaking from Cuffe Parade What lies We started at Churchgate Thats where bums like you all sing Know it or not Jiggy my piggy Yes Shaleen mydarleen Whens your flight taking off Meaning When are you telling Mala What Come to me am your love She

airconditioned Entry is forbidden Forbidden Why bomb threat think So we have to roast here Come along Mala Were a really fun group Itll be so much fun Tell me Jiggy why am at the airport on my day off Our special friends are coming So bring them flowers Sweets We did Why bring me dont even know them and m here receiving them like an idiot When people meet after ages every meeting has a story knowstories hate stories Especially ones which end at airports Why Its so easy Sneaking in and stopping a plane Try it Youll be gunned down like a terrorist Not very romantic are you Miserable couples everywhere Before marriage fights and suspicion And after marriage Were bored Nope Not when you find the right person Ah Madeforeachother crap Happens in Mills and Boons not in real life It happens Really Oh Please tell me m dying to know Pretty please For that youll have to hear a story and you dont like stories What kind love story With a hero heroine villains Villainsnot too many But there are fights songs misunderstandings Oh full on And a climax at the airport Give it a go The flights delayed anyway better not get bored Shoot So Mala theres a boy and a girl This story begins with a dream man brandishing a sword like in a costume drama and riding a horse Is this your dream No Then how do you know it Jai often has such dreams And Jai is The guy whos dreaming Now listen ll be right there But your exams Its Aditi She needs me m sorry We tried our best But we couldnt save her d like to say a few words Radha is no longer with us still remember the first time we met her Shining black eyes such an innocent face on such a prankster She was with us a while She touched our lives Aditiwell never forget Radha Come Lets pray that Radha finds happiness wherever she goes That she remembers us and learns to catch mice Radha was a cat memorial service for a cat Oh she had the last rites too Are you all nuts Not us Aditi She found Radha in college and loved her like her own daughter Everything was extreme for Aditi Love hatred attachment Nothing was measured But how could you take this seriously Actually we found it silly too But not Jai All Jai cared about was Aditis grief He just wanted to make her smile Sometimes Aditi you meet someone along the way And it breaks your heart when they go away Eyes demand tears its hard to disobey And believe everythings gonna be Sometimes you feel so down and blue Every day is like a bitter brew Its hard to smile feel happy or gay And believe everythings gonna be Think of how much we love you When you cry we cry with you Cant hold a note but sing for you Aditi sometimes the world is a dark place But the blackest night cracks with the dawns rays Sometimes you find a friend along the way Feels unreal like a dream when they go away Go on Aditi laugh a bit Just a bit How about a smile Go on give us a little smile Your happiness spreads joy all around The sun emerges and warms the ground Can you hear what the wind has to say Aditi friends though parted meet again Know it or not flowers blossom again Sometimes Aditi you meet someone along the way And it breaks your heart when they go away Go on Aditi laugh a bit Just a bit How about a smile Go on Go on Aditi laugh a bit Just a bit How about a smile Go on You had a crush on Aditi Smitten And Bombs had a thing for Jai But Jai and Aditi were just in their own world You say the glass is half empty say its half full say its a lot You say its a little bit If say its day You say it isnt night Arent they the same Just said differently But at the end of the day Its only you who understands me Whether you know it or not Whether you show it or not m here Its Aunty Pammi Yes Pammi Again No Thats useless Enough police complaints Write to the Commissioner if you wish m going to the newspapers Hes not going to change until hes suspended Your old friend Inspector Waghmare Who else Brutally thrashed a teenager in lockup mean that man His own baton should be Breath control Inhale deeply exhale slowly You want breakfast Your turn Yours But m in the mood had that dream again What dream The same one Some guy with a sword riding a horse You forgot the pepper ve felt this before think its dad Your dad My husband Riding a horse With a sword How could you even think this just You know how much he hated violence Forget fighting he couldnt bear to see anyone else fight And so he died He went to stop a quarrel and and never returned Its just a dream cant do much about that The tragedy Jai is that you can even dream it And so Jai Singh Rathore aka Rats was the most nonviolent person in the world Gandhiji would weep with joy if he knew Jai And get spasms of acidity if he knew Aditi Youre a coward Your mom Your dad Your whole family are cowards craphead Jai move ll fix him ll show you whos the coward you dog Vivek are you mad calling her a coward Not her shithead You Me Then whats the problem Meow Vivek carry on Better bell your cat or youll find her

hand to anyone So you can call me coward chicken whatever it makes no difference If someone is rude to me it makes no difference to you If someone raises a hand to me it still makes no difference You wont get into a scrap Right He was just following his dads Dreams principles Actually his mother had modified the truth a bit She had portrayed Jais dad as a GandhiBuddha combo In reality Amar Singh Rathore was slightly different Amar m warning you for the last time Get out of Jais dreams Then stop turning him into a coward feel ashamed of him Hes a Rathore Rathore from Ranjhore If wanted a Rathore from Ranjhore would have stayed in Ranjhore You your family You are all insane Insane psychotic violent men Jais a simple boy who doesnt raise his hand unnecessarily When will you cut that umbilical cord woman My dear Savitri Just because hes been cut off from his tradition will he not try to be true towards his tradition Mark my words Savitri One day he will make all of Ranjhore all the Rathores all Rajasthan proud And you shall behold him in silence The Rathores from Ranjhore took their machismo pretty seriously And so after Amar Singhs death Savitri ran away Jai was justfive years old then In Ranjhore a boy has to complete three rites of passage to become a man What Not now Jiggy But she has to know the three conditions to get the story You dont know how to tell a story Right thing at the right time Right time being the end of the story What happened then We jump to our graduation day farewell party at Aditis house Where Aditis dad gave Jai a cheque for a million

die hard And desire has no cure Troubles me all day Keeps me up at night Troubles me all day Keeps me up at night wish knew my heart The secret look The stolen gaze Finds its mark And yet it strays The eyes are filled with love But the heart feels incomplete And keeps walking this one way street The lips speak all but the heart keeps it a secret Holding your beloved near Who do you seek here
