am Folsom Prison At one time they called me Bloody Folsom And earned the name ve been standing here in California since My own prisoners built me shutting themselves off from the free world Every block of my granite is cemented by their tears their pain and the blood of many men This is a story from my rough tough past It happened not long after the turn of the century At the time tell about had within my walls dangerous men that other prisons couldnt hold but held them If couldnt break a mans spirit broke his bones kept many of them in a cell house that wasnt fit for animals let alone men Its cells were more like tombs And the doors were made of solid iron secured by bars that only dynamite could budge Two men and often more were crowded into those airless crypts They slept when they could sleep on mattresses alive with vermin They froze on winter nights and their bodies were drained of sweat in the breathless heat of summer Every morning whilst it was still dark my guards made the rounds turning out the inmate kitchen workers so they could cook the slop that was fed my prisoners under the name of breakfast Is it any wonder that after a sleepless night a man sometimes went berserk and fought the hated walls that shut him in Knock it off you and let a guy get some sleep Pipe down you wingding This was a common thing in those old days had so little work for them to do Idleness and brutal restraint is a combination that rots a mans mind Every Sunday morning a long line of prisoners waited before the gate which led to the office of the Captain of the Guard These men had dared to break my rules Rules no man could keep under such conditions And they were there to be sentenced to punishment First in line was the man whose mind had cracked under the awful strain His feet were touching the Dead Line and every prisoner knew that it meant just that That the convict who stepped across that line without being ordered to do so invited hot lead from the rifles of the guards from the towers Trigger happy morons who needed no second invitation In every prison population there is always a leader and Chuck Daniels serving a life term was just that My warden of that time was of the old school In the language of the prison world a con hater To him convicts were brutes And brute force was the only thing that would keep them in line Pete Donovan Close the gate Well Pete you had a little trouble this morning What have you got to say for yourself Nothing Destroying prison property is a serious offence Havent you got any explanation to offer You try sleeping in one of them sweat boxes According to regulations should put you in solitary Go ahead Drop days on me a concrete bedll be better than that stinking mattress ve been sleeping on days solitary Wait a

for their own appearance From now on the officers of the guard line will report for duty in uniforms that are at least clean And will conduct themselves like officers Not like thugs Yes Sir Stewart If a pure food inspector was shown through the prison canning plant hed have apoplexy The place reeks of filth As for discipline the workers are either bullied by the guards or left to do as they please The same thing applies to all the shops Clean em up Yes Sir Also want that Silence sign taken out of the mess hall Let the men talk whilst they eat And as off today were taking beans off the prison menu How can you run a prison without beans Beans are a good wholesome food They might be if they werent spoiled According to the record barrels of rejected food mostly beans were thrown to the ranch hogs last week Is that right Stewart Yes Sir But what am going to feed em if cant feed em beans Feed em the ranch hogs Then theyll get the beans in a more palatable form Dont you ever feed meat to the

modern new buildings to house my growing population But what is more important they gave me a change of heart Administrators who were merciful as well as just Today under the direction of an enlightened penologist my guards are chosen by competitive examination and without political interference My walls are still impregnable but the prisoners inside them are treated as individuals For what they are and for what ails them am still overcrowded There is still the evil of two men in a cell In my prison hospital you will find every modern appliance Every expert medical care To correct a mans thinking you must keep his body fit And by the same token you must occupy his mind Here where million license plates were turned out this year inmates are paid a nominal wage and are given a chance to regain their self respect cant keep all the men you send to me The great majority will one day be sent out on parole Their care their rehabilitation is your problem as well as mine You cant lock them up and forget them Sooner or later one of them may be your nextdoor neighbour If they send you to me now ll be just ll be humane But dont get me wrong m no pushover You will still find that there is no substitute for freedom
