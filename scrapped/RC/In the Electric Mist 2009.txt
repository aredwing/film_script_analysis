burdened greatly by the deaths of those around me Lieutenant But incorporating their suffering into our own lives does not change the way of the world An act of kindness one as simple as giving a girl my raincoat had resulted in her death The shooter had left nothing behind no ejected brass no recoverable prints We had no suspects But one heartsinking and unalterable conclusion remained Kelly Drummond was dead And she was dead because she had been mistaken for me The tragic death of Kelly Drummond the longtime companion of Elrod Sykes and star of the popular television series River Valley now appears certain to have been a case of mistaken identity Sources within the sheriffs department conflrmed that they now belleve the fatal shot may have been intended for someone else m going to miss her Dave You want him to stay here Guys in bad shape This is our home Mr Sykes just did the rainbow yawn again Go to bed The guy needs an friend or hes not going to make it So what dont care Tell

not come in late Okay but only for a few days Do you like being a movie star Its just a job honey Really Yeah Its like Dave You think he enjoys enforcing the law catching the bad guys making the good people feel better Yeah Yeah well like my job m sorry about Kelly Me too honey ve got movie posters here from Tears and Diamonds hate that picture Well movie posters signed by Elrod Sykes will fetch

call for him Theres a half empty bottle of Bourbon here on the dresser spilled bottle of Diazepam here on the coffee table all writing that off as a suicide Well thats the way it looks to me He was in bad shape Mattress is covered in piss stains The sink is full of raw garbage Wheres the gun at By the bedside If Lou Girard wanted to kill his self how come he didnt use that Cause he was drunk on his ass Not an unusual condition for him He was helping me on a case Doobie And Maybe he found out something somebody did not want him to know He was trembling eating pills every morning in front of everybody Theres no big mystery to what happened here tonight He was a good cop He was a sorryass drunk Now if you want to look at anything else hurry up m going to seal the place appreciate you
