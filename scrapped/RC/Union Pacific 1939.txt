Frankly Mr Ames the only vision can see is a lot of loose dollars rolling away over those prairies Good day gentlemen Ames But theres more than profit in the lap of this undertaking This railroad is the future of the United States Along its rails new cities will rise Is there not some danger that the Central Pacific which is building east across California may reach Ogden first and keep you out of the Salt Lake Valley President Lincoln wisely arranged that the Central Pacific will build only to the California state line Here where our tracks will join with theirs General Dodge uh as Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific are you quite sure that a railroad more than miles long can actually be built through such a wilderness Yes Yes My brother Oliver and are staking our fortune on General

dead and there are those in Washington who do not wish the Union Pacific well Cant both lines have terminals in Ogden No Whipple You miss the point The Union Pacific has authority to build only to where it meets the Central Well And if the Central should pass through Ogden first and meet the Union in the wilds of the Wasatch Mountains Yes Exactly The Union would have miles of track and a gopher hole for its Western terminal Splendid Well sell Union stock short and buy Central Well make millions Mr Barrows golden opportunity Pure gold Oh yes Yes indeed But suppose the Union Pacific gets to
