enough money for one film We just dont have enough for all twelve Well you know what you do You produce a film in a commerciallyproven genre and then after its a hit you take the profits from that and you make the apostles movie Would that work Absolutely Let me show you something You see this script Grave Robbers from Outer Space Money in the bank Grave robbers from what From outer space Its science fiction Very big with the kids If you make this picture youll have enough money to finance a hundred religious films and pay my back rent with the profits dont know This is um all a lot to

Ah gee never noticed that Put a wig on him Before we start shooting Mr Wood uh we have a few questions Yes The script contains numerous references to grave robbing Now we find the concept of digging up consecrated ground to be highly offensive It is blasphemy What are you talking about Its the premise of the movie Its the title of the movie for Christs sakes Mr Wood Yes About that title It strikes us as very inflammatory Eh why dont we change it to Plan From Outer Space Huh Thats ridiculous All right And action Medical examiner been around yet Just left Uh the morgue wagon oughta be along most any time You get their statement Yeah but theyre pretty scared Fine mess like this will frighten anyone You have one of the boys uh take the guy and the girl back to town You take charge

disbelief Reverend m here Ohh Who is he This is our choir director Hes going to play the young hero Are you people insane m the director make the casting decisions around here Well thought this was a

happens And theyre always trying to cast their buddies It doesnt even matter if theyre right for the part Tell me about it m supposed to do a thriller at Universal but they want Charlton Heston to play a Mexican Ah Mr Welles is it all worth it It is when it works You know the one film of mine where had total control Kane The studio hated it but they didnt get to touch a frame Ed Yes Visions are worth fighting for Why spend your life making someone elses dreams Thank you Orson Mr Reynolds Yes We are gonna finish this picture just the way want it because you cannot compromise an artists vision

youre about to see an extraordinary motion picture But before it begins think we should all give a hand to the man without whom we wouldnt be here tonight Eddie take a bow Thanks a million just want to say that this film is for Bela The grief ofhis wifes death became greater and greater agony The home they had so long shared together became a tomb a sweet memory ofherjoyous living The sky to which he had once looked was now only a covering for her dead body The everbeautiful flowers she had planted with her own hands became nothing more than the lost roses ofher cheeks Confused by his great loss the old man left that home never to return again This is the one This is the one ll be remembered for Ah gee honey m so happy for ya say lets get married Huh Right now Lets go to Vegas But Eddie its pouring and the car top is stuck Phooey Its only a fivehour drive and itll probably stop by the time we get to the desert Heck itll probably stop by the time we get around the corner Lets go Ohh
