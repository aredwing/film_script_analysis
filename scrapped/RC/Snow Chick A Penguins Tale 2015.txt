Midwinter in Antarctica and one of natures most extraordinary stories is about to begin Through two months of biting winds blizzards and unimaginable cold these male emperor penguins have each nurtured a single precious egg One by one they welcome their tiny chicks into the world But not all eggs will hatch and one father is still waiting neighbour shows off his own new youngster His calls will encourage the chick to emerge Finally the youngest member of the colony is born But growing up in the worlds most extreme nursery will be a huge challenge for in just months he must have learnt enough to fend for himself in the great Antarctic Ocean This is the dramatised story of one extraordinary little bird Far from their chicks the mothers have spent the last two months catching fish and fattening up while the fathers were left alone to hatch their eggs Now the race is on to get back and feed their young Among the excited crowd is Snow Chicks mother Shes got a belly full of fish for her newborn but between them is a gruelling km trek across the frozen sea Waddling at less than km an hour it will take many days to get home Instinct drives them on their babies lives depend on them arriving in time Back at the colony the father is getting to know his chick He gives him some highcalorie baby milk produced from a gland in his throat But these supplies will only last a few days Its just as well his mother is on her way Following her maternal instinct she and all the other females are making steady progress on their journey home But in places the ice is wafer thin Below a predator tracks their every move leopard seal the penguins greatest enemy The chicks mother senses danger She was right to be cautious Broken ice is a death trap For the rest their chick is their only concern But the seal needs just one victim near miss and she still has treacherous kilometres ahead of her While the chick waits for her return outside temperatures are at minus But the pouch covers him like a tea cosy and keeps him at a comfy plus degrees For a new father walking with a chick on your feet is a tricky balancing act Hell get the hang of it soon The mothers are also struggling with the icy conditions and they are crossing some of the toughest terrain on earth Their sharp claws grip the ice while scales on their feet act like treads But where the snow melts and rethaws it creates slippery conditions that even a penguin finds challenging Back at the colony its been a week since the chick was born At these temperatures survival depends on getting enough to eat His father tries but theres nothing left to give The mothers battle on Sadly some years they simply dont make it in time The chick is getting weaker by the hour Then at last some weary figures appear Utterly exhausted by the walk the mother still has one final challenge before she can meet her chick Finding him There are over three thousand fathers with chicks here and even to penguins they all look the same For the chick time is running out But the penguins have a solution The fathers get in line and dad and his chick join them They form an identity parade All she has to do is simply work her way along the line Sounds simple enough but among all the penguin lookalikes her partner is still tricky to recognise So every so often she stops and calls Her cry is unique and the father responds with a call of his own Its what she was hoping to hear After months at sea and a km trek across the ice shes made it back in the nick of time In a miracle of natural timing he gets a morsel that will save his life Its now his mothers turn to take over the childcare But they must be careful a few seconds too long on the ice and their chick will die Finally they unite as a family The bond they share is one of the most remarkable in nature For over the next months theyll take it in turns to trek to the sea to bring back food for their evergrowing baby His father endured so much to get the tiny chick this far saying goodbye is hard This time theres no looking back In weeks he will return with fresh supplies But first theres the little matter of a km round trip to the sea Now its mums turn to feed him a natural preservative has kept the fish as fresh as the day it was caught The chick may be satisfied but his father hasnt eaten for months He and the rest of the hungry fathers are now two days into their long walk to the sea But sometimes the ice offers a shortcut An ice hole a portal to the sea which could cut their journey by days And when youre famished its got to be worth investigating But such holes dont appear by themselves There had to be a catch They can either stay and hope the leopard seal goes away or continue their long risky trek to the sea Time to regroup This must be a joint decision Emperors rely on each other for their very survival so learning social skills starts early Penguins are naturally argumentative so his first lesson is sticking up for himself His mother only intervenes when things go too far But no kid likes being told off At the ice hole the standoff continues No one is keen to be first But they egg each other on as penguins like to do The coast is clear Their gamble paid off At the colony two weeks have passed The chicks are testing their independence and spending time away from their mothers All that is except one As the last to hatch hes way behind in development While the older chicks are boisterous and confident he still feels most comfortable in his mothers pouch But penguins are sociable birds and to survive he must learn to play his part in the colony Its a daunting prospect but the little chick finds some courage Its a shaky start but he mustnt lose his nerve Time for a bit of tough love With every step he gains more confidence Its just as well he has so many friends to make But when youre the smallest its tough to join the gang For now theres always mum Out in the open ocean the fathers are revelling in being back in the water They havent eaten for four whole months and have lost half their body weight To stock up on fish and squid they hold their breath for up to minutes and dive to nearly metres deeper than any other bird At the colony three weeks have passed and the chick is confidently following his mother wherever she goes Hes still learning how things should be done And how they shouldnt He soon thinks theres nothing left to learn so nervous toddler turns cocky explorer But at this age she mustnt let him out of her sight Shes lost him and heads off in the wrong direction Confused he does the only sensible thing and heads towards the colony He feels safer now his mother must be here somewhere And then security at last But hes got it wrong its not his mother This must be her surely Wrong again He tests each penguin in turn but nobody wants him In a colony this size he may never find his mother again These are desperate times In this frozen world lost chicks dont survive for long His father is among the many rushing back with fresh supplies But he must be careful pod of killer whales are on their tail They look for any penguin that makes a mistake Just a tiny error but now hes in deep trouble He torpedoes to safety But killer whales are intelligent and persistent predators and the spring melt has turned the iceedge into a maze of gullies and openings Perfect for a surprise attack He must find a safe passage out by staying on solid ice To keep him in their sights they spyhop He sees a route and heads for safety reprieve of sorts But the other fathers left without him And with a storm brewing hes totally exposed Already the blizzard has reached the colony The chicks only protection is his overcoat of down and at minus its simply not enough And unfortunately the other mothers care only for their own The chicks mother calls one last time but her cries are lost on the wind At last hes found And not a moment too soon Within a few hours the full force of the storm engulfs the colony The chick may be safe but as temperatures drop to minus his mothers warmth is not enough To protect him she needs to find refuge in the shared warmth of the other penguins As km an hour winds lash the colony the penguins huddle together Sheltered from the storm theyre snug at last But out on the ice the lone father is still paying the price for his mistake His only hope is to reach the safety of the colony in time In the comfort of the huddle the penguins have all the shelter they need In the centre temperatures can even reach a toasty degrees To cool down they shuffle to the outside letting others take their place By sharing body heat they weather any storm Desperate for the warmth of the family the lone father struggles on For the sake of his chick he simply has to make it back Then through the blizzard salvation Against the odds hes made it home few weeks pass and the days are lengthening Dad is on parenting duties while mum takes the fishing shift But even in the safety of the colony there are unexpected dangers Penguins who have failed to breed practice childrearing skills on chunks of ice But their mothering instinct is so overwhelming what they really want is a baby of their own And who better than the smallest most adorable chick in the colony Dad has his work cut out keeping these kidsnatchers at bay And they arent the only broody penguins Soon there are so many babysnatchers they block the fathers path at every turn As his chick gets smothered by admirers theres nothing he can do For these lone females the urge to nurture a chick of their own is overwhelming In the frenzy they are in danger of loving him to death When dad can finally reach him his little chick is in real peril Then a lucky break He gets his battered baby back Nothing is more important than the safety of your young As the weeks go by spring turns to summer The sea ice melts and the ocean gets closer It means feeding the chicks is easy so they are growing up fast They hang out together in small comforting huddles But Snow Chick isnt ready to cut the ties despite being too big for his fathers pouch Its starting to get embarrassing Its long overdue but his father finally persuades him to find his place in the gang But theres an art to joining a huddle and he hasnt mastered it But practice makes perfect and the first thing to work out is which way to face You know youve got it right when someone snuggles in behind you Accepted at last This is a huge milestone in his development It means that for the first time both parents can go fishing The chick is not so sure hes ready to be left on his own But the colony has invisible walls and he instinctively knows they mustnt be crossed The adults left behind dont have the caring ways of his parents Until they return he must find one of the colonys childminders penguin who hasnt bred takes on the role as practice for the future Shell take him under her wing but only if he does as hes told Shes a firm believer in discipline With so many chicks in her care stragglers wont be tolerated He will just have to toughen up But theres a reason for the new strict regime With the warmer days the open sea is closer now and new and unwelcome visitors can reach the colony easily giant petrel They always pick on the smallest Hes caught But just by his baby fluff The childminder is welcome now Its now a deadly game of hide and seek Luckily the petrel spots an easier meal of scraps And the chick has learnt a valuable lesson As spring continues the melting ice brings another new arrival The Adlie penguin cocky character very different to the laidback emperor Adlies breed in the Antarctic summer Hes the first to arrive and hes heading straight for his breeding grounds Exactly where the emperors are living When the Adlie reaches the colony hes on a mission Hes setting up home for the summer and he expects to have the place to himself Adlies are only half a metre tall but theyre the most pugnacious of all penguins He thinks nothing of taking on the whole colony Chicks that dont give way soon get the message Hell be a thorn in their side until hes seen the back of them In the meantime he makes himself at home As the melt brings the sea ever closer the parents visit their chicks more frequently The littlest still has some catching up to do but with this continuous relay of food everyone is bulking up When the chick isnt eating he spends his time hungrily waiting for his next meal When his mother does arrive shes plagued by greedy chicks all trying to blag a free lunch But if she feeds any of these imposters her chick will go hungry Hes hidden somewhere in the huddle To find him she must use her unique and comforting call The chicks are so tightly packed he can only reach her by crowdsurfing Even now he must undergo an identity check before he gets a meal Fortunately he passes the test At the iceedge a new invasion More Adlies Hundreds of them Theyre ready to breed and nothing will stand in their way They timeshare these breeding grounds with the emperors and the summer season is their turn If youre small its best to keep a low profile and hope theyll pick on someone their own size While the bigger chicks are squaring up he makes his exit When the new neighbours arent picking fights with the chicks they argue amongst themselves The Adlie invasion is also a sign of a bigger and more profound change After five months of nurturing the adults are preparing to leave their chicks for good conveyer belt of food is now arriving around the clock building them up until they can fend for themselves Many adults are leaving the colony for the last time And the smallest chick here still has some feeding up to do and his parents are nowhere to be seen Then two familiar figures Its double helpings this time Hell need the extra nourishment he doesnt know it yet but this is the last meal hell ever get from them Without so much as a backward glance mum and dad head back to sea Their work is done The chick they spent months rearing must now stand on his own two feet week goes by and the weather deteriorates All that time the chicks have been waiting but their parents never returned Even the Adlie seems confused Eventually driven by hunger and instinct their only choice is to cross the colonys invisible boundary and begin the most important journey of their lives The Adlie couldnt be happier to see them go He escorts them off the premises As winds reach km per hour the smallest struggles to keep up But hell only survive if he stays with the group and its so easy to lose them in a blizzard In temperatures of minus they battle on driven by a need to reach the sea After several hours the struggling chick is losing energy Then even the other chicks can travel no more Completely exhausted the chick must make one final effort Together the plucky little gang wait for the storm to pass few days later the weather has changed and so have the chicks As they prepare for a life in the ocean they preen away their baby fluff to reveal their adult plumage underneath As ever one chick has some catching up to do The Adlie wants them on their way Urged on by their escort the ragtag army reach their destination This is their first sight of the sea The great Antarctic Ocean Theyre facing the greatest challenge of their young lives and theyll only go when all are ready But their ice world is disappearing fast He hesitates Somethings wrong The ice gives way Hes tossed into the sea He cant go it alone he must rejoin the others Then he starts to settle It feels strangely natural But as the rest show no sign of joining him his only choice is to clamber back out Its far more difficult than getting in And it seems hes not alone in the water The chicks head for a safer spot But despite the danger the ocean is beckoning and the excitement is contagious An old foe is here to see them off The chick may still be the smallest but he seems more confident now He may be facing the great unknown but hes already had a taste of the sea He pushes his way to the front After all he has learnt this is his moment He takes a leap of faith and this time there is no turning back The rest follow his cue He might have been the smallest but he was strong enough to survive against the odds And now he leads the penguin gang into the vast Antarctic Ocean This will be their home for the next four years Then driven by the same feelings that drove his parents Snow Chick will return here to find a partner of his own And the whole incredible story will begin all over again
