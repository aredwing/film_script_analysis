when was little Jack We leave tonight Youre going with him Congratulations didnt recognize him at first but think always knew Funny Running into my childhood enemy again Here His heartbeats haunted my nights since school cant stand hearing a clock now It drives me mad Right m ready At the time little Jack with his air of a sad bird never realized how dangerous he was Dangerous Youve noticed he doesnt have a normal heart ve noticed That thing of his shaped like a clock Its not a heart its a grenade a timebomb should know paid to find out Thats impossible Jack wouldnt hurt a fly Except when he loses control of his heart and fails to abide by the rules What rules Firstly never touch The hands of your heart Rule number two Keep your temper under control Last but not least The most important rule Whatever else you do Never fall in love You want to make me a murderess What do you mean Joe told me it all The rules his eye everything Joe You cant lie your way out of it Joes here How could you hide that from me Who are you Who am Who was falling for could kill you dont want to love you refuse to be your murderess Thats not love Youre selfish Youve got it wrong You didnt gouge his eye It was an accident d rather it never came to that but he forgot to mention all he did to me He deserved to lose an eye for it Of course not But whyd he come here to tell you all this To steal you from me To protect me from you He never protected anyone He terrorized everybody Look at what hes doing to us now Great Lose your temper too Listen Dont touch me Ah Ah Stop that You scare me m sorry Its raining Leave me alone My love for you is offbeat because of my makeshift heart but its true love Madeleine forbade me to fall in love yet put my life in your hands Since saw you sing and we bumped into each other all wanted was to find you can face anything for you can do anything for you Apparently What youre doing now is just crazy know and its driving me nuts d prefer you to be nuts than dead Now go Go away please Years and years spent reflecting and ruminating Unable to accept my adventure had been terminated Miss Acacia haunts my mind however hard try set out to find her and the man who poked out my eye Thats right m back m here to take action wont stay in Edinburgh floundering in woe and dejection In my dreams my love for her is undying Now its time to win her back or ll die trying couldnt wait to see again my worst enemy little Jack And hearing that cursed clock immediately took me back When caught a glimpse of him felt the pressure rise We needed to have a talk but saw hatred in his eyes explained that losing one of mine changed me forever d suffered for being different and revenge was not my agenda Bullying him in the past cost me an eye and now were quits The only battle want with Jack is one of wits understand he hates me for all the torment he sustained humiliated and persecuted him caused him every type of pain But asking about Miss Acacia from day one was pretty dense With just that single phrase he signed his death sentence What we have in common is that wed do anything for her And older and wiser we can forget the scraps and slurs ll take Miss Acacia home to Edinburgh to begin again But first offer Jack a duel and may the best man win You have only yourself to blame You made it too easy for me was looking forward to a tougher opponent You dont deserve her Earlier in her dressing room she threw herself into my arms hate you No Jack No Stop that Come away Hes out of control Hes broken want to change heart Transplant me m sick of it breaking down Madeleine was right With some camera parts could try to repair you but No more repairs want something solid and new think your problem lies deeper than your clock Give me a new heart and rewind everything never want to fall in love again understand my friend You need time Nothing but time m out of time gave my key to Miss Acacia You gave the key of your heart to a spark Where is she now She left with Joe But that key is your life You were aware of the risk know Hurry back to Madeleine Shes your only hope When did you last wind yourself up dont remember Quickly No its better if you stay here knew the risks as you said must face the consequences Anyway youre making your voyage to the moon The twoinone formula suits you perfectly Take courage mon ami Courage isnt what m lacking You think Jack will be okay Do you think hell go back to Edinburgh He has his family there dont know but if he does decide to go home hes in for a nasty surprise Why Just after Jack left Madeleine the sorceress was sent to prison She wasnt very Sorry my left front wheel has shattered Wasnt very what Happy to be in a cell She didnt stay long She died a few days later They say she died of grief over Jack Over Jack leaving you mean If you like He brings bad luck wherever he goes Whats wrong Jack gave me his key before we left Wait have to go back Excuse me do you know where Jack is Hes left for Edinburgh Just as feared have his key Dont worry Dr Madeleine who saved him as a baby will find a way to piece his heart together Shes dead What Go after him Save him Thats all he asks Hes headed to Valencia You can catch him before the train leaves Hold on wait a second Heres the journal ve kept since met Jack something to read on the long journey ahead Thank you At his age besides rowing and magic tricks my life was empty But Jack His dreams were incarcerated in the wooden cage of his heart Little Miss Acacia had opened the floodgates ve never seen one person dream of another with such intensity It wasnt a cuckooclock but an electric volcano grafted onto him He could have shrunk after so long spent in the rain on our journey real Don Quixote When he tilts at his dream hes intractable Unstoppable ll die alone but dont know where ll die alone but dont know where Oh Oh Get some Oh Get some Oh Get some Jack My poor boy Thanks You still look like a shrimp with muscles think Jack has gone and caught a head cold Gently does it Hello Arthur Rust has invaded his spine When he moves it grates Hes become scared of the cold and rain since Wheres Madeleine Jack listen to me must say words that weigh so heavy that worry they might stay stuck in my throat The day you left We saw you onto the train Then Anna and climbed the hill The front door was wide open Nobody was home The workshop looked like a hurricane had hit it Madeleines remedies were scattered Even the cat was gone With Arthur we went looking for her In the end we found her in St Calford Prison In prison Yes The police arrested her after we left It wasnt the first time theyd jailed her We werent really worried want to see her d like to tell you she is free now Cooking with one hand Fixing someone with the other And that despite missing you badly shes fine But Madeleine has gone She left her body in prison Sadness will overwhelm you but remember you brought her the joy of being a mother It was the dream of a lifetime for her She saw you as a fragile little thing to be protected at all cost joined to her by that cord in the form of a clock She dreaded the day when youd become an adult m stopping here and d advise you to do the same miss Its haunted up there Jack Its me Jack Its not too late can still save you You just have No let me turn the key in your heart You came back here for me You couldnt do anything more extraordinary for my heart Thank you No Now whatever happens to me the responsibility is all mine You can kiss me now What about the weather ve got you What about the weather ve got you Under my skin What about the weather ve got you What about the weather ve got you Under my skin What about the weather ve got you Under my skin Oh my baby my little one How romantic it could be To

so hard As did on that cavalry charge dont bother with watches or charts keep time with my cuckoo clock heart Knock me down with a feather of fluff But d shoulder the earth soon enough To find you again In sharp stiletto heels you can tell how she feels From the spines of her cactus heart Love for her was the spring that sprung in his clockwork heart Fell apart In sharp stiletto heels you can tell how she feels From the spines of her cactus heart Love for her was the spring that sprung from his clockwork heart Fell apart Chasing dreams all the lonely nights Gold and silver sparkles so bright Even buried under the sea Her precious lie would still reach me Treasure hunting for so long dont know if shell ever belong to me Miss Acacia In sharp stiletto heels you can tell how she feels From the spines of her cactus heart Love for her was the spring that sprung in his clockwork heart Fell apart In sharp stiletto heels you can tell how she feels From the spines of her cactus heart Love for her was the spring that sprung from his clockwork heart Fell apart Oh theres nothing quite so amusing as recklessness When youre and gallivanting all across Europe on the trail of a girl d say that your reckless gene must be highly developed nest pas Can his ticker take it How much joy would break it Can his ticker take it Loving you could break it all Miss Acacia Sharp stiletto heels She had a cactus heart Sharp stiletto heels She had a cactus heart Sharp stiletto heels She had a cactus heart Sharp stiletto heels She had a cactus heart
