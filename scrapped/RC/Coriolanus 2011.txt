Aye if you come not in the blood of others but mantled in your own Let me hold you in arms as sound as when wooed in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done There is the man of my souls hate Aufidius piercing our Romans Worthy sir thou bleeds Thy exercise has been too violent for a second course of fight Sir praise me not My work hath not yet warmed me The blood drop is more medicinal than dangerous to me To Aufidius thus will appear and fight If any such be here as it were sin to doubt that love this painting wherein you see me smeared if any fear lesser his person than an ill report if any think brave death outweighs bad life and that his country is dearer than himself let him alone or so many so minded wave thus to express his disposition and follow Martius me alone Make you a sword of me Oi Advance brave Titus Away Come Come ll fight with none but thee for do hate thee We hate alike Five times Martius have fought with thee So often has thou beat me and would do so fear should we encounter as often as we eat For where thought to crush him in an equal force true sword to sword ll potch at him some way Or wrath or craft may get him Hes the devil Bolder though not so subtle Nor sleep nor sanctuary being naked sick the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom against my hate to Martius Where find him were it at home upon my brothers guard even there will wash my fierce hand in his heart Honorable Menenius My boy Martius approaches For the love of Juno lets go Is he not wounded He was wont to come home wounded yes he is wounded thank the gods for it so do too if it be not too much Brings a victory in his pocket the wounds become him Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly Titus Lartius said they fought together but Aufidius got off In truth theres wondrous things spoke of him Gods grant them true True ll be sworn theyre true Where is he wounded In the shoulder and in the left arm There will be large scars to show the people when he shall stand for his place He had before this last expedition wounds upon him Now its Every gash was an enemys grave Before him he carries noise and behind him he leaves tears Death that dark spirit in his nervy arm doth lie Which being advanced declines and then men die Be it known as to us to all the world that Caius Martius wears this wars garland And from this time for what he did before Corioles call him with all the applause and clamor of the host Caius Martius Coriolanus Bear the addition nobly ever Caius Martius Coriolanus No more of this It does offend my heart Pray now no more Look sir your mother you have know petitioned all the gods for my prosperity Nay my good soldier up Ah my gentle Martius worthy Caius and by deedachieving honor newly named What is it Coriolanus must call thee But thy wife My gracious silence hail Wouldst thou have laughed had come coffined home that weeps to see me triumph Aye my dear such eyes the widows in Corioles wear and mothers that lack sons Now the gods crown thee And live you yet could weep and could laugh m light and heavy know not where to turn you are welcome home You are welcome all hundred thousand welcomes Welcome all Welcome Coriolanus Welcome Tis thought that Martius shall be consul have seen the dumb men throng to see him and the blind to hear him speak Matrons flung gloves ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs upon him as he passed The nobles bended as to Joves statue And the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts never saw the like Was ever a man so proud as is this Martius He has no equal When we were chosen tribunes for the people Marked you his lip and eyes Nay but his taunts The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight Good or bad Not according to the prayer of the people for they love not Martius Nature teaches beasts to know their friends You blame Martius for being proud We do it not alone sir know you can do very little alone You talk of pride that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves that you could What then sir Why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy politicians alias fools as any in Rome Menenius you are known well enough too am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it One that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning What think utter and spend my malice in my breath Come sir come we know you well enough You know neither me yourselves nor anything Youre ambitious Good een to your worships More of your conversation would infect my brain How many stand for the consulship Three they say but tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it Thats a brave fellow but he is vengeance proud and loves not the common people There have been many great men that have flattered the people who never loved them Therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition And out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see it But he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render at him Now to seem to desire the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love Consider you what services he has done for his country Very well And would be content to give him good report for it but that he pays himself with being proud Nay but speak not maliciously He hath deserve worthily of his country The good senators must be visited from whom have received not only greetings but with them change of honors have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy Only theres one thing wanting which doubt not but our Rome will cast upon thee Good mother d rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs Coriolanus will carry it Hes a worthy man He will carry it All tongues speak of him On the sudden warrant him consul Then our office may during his power go asleep He cannot temperately transport his honors from where he should begin and end but will lose those he hath won heard him swear were he to stand for consul never would he appear in the marketplace nor showing as the manner is his wounds to the people beg their stinking breaths It was his word It shall be to him then a sure destruction So it must fall out to him or our authorities for an end We must suggest to the people in what hatred he still hath held them Kindle their dry stubble and their blaze shall darken him forever It remains as the main point of this our aftermeeting to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country Therefore please you most grave and reverend elders to desire the present consul and last general in our wellfound successes to report a little of that worthy work performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus Speak good Cominius Aye Nay keep your place Sit Coriolanus Never shame to hear what you have nobly done Your honors pardon d rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how got them Pray you sit down d rather have one scratch my head in the sun when the alarm were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered Speak good Cominius Aye proceed The deeds of Coriolanus should not be uttered feebly It is held that valor is the chiefest virtue and most dignifies the haver If it be the man speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised At years he fought beyond the mark of others When he might act the woman in the scene he proved best man in the field And in the brunt of battles since he lurched all swords of the garland For this last before and in Corioles let me say cannot speak him home He stopped the fliers and by his rare example made coward turn terror into sport from face to foot He was a thing of blood whose every motion was timed with dying cries Alone he entered the mortal gate of the city which he painted with shunless destiny Aidless came off and with a sudden reenforcement struck Corioles like a planet Until we called both field and city ours he never stood to ease his breast with panting Our spoils he kicked at and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world He covets less than misery itself would give rewards his deeds with doing them and is content to spend the time to end it The senate Coriolanus are well pleased to make thee consul Aye do owe them still my life and services It then remains that you do speak to the people do beseech you let me overleap that custom for cannot entreat them for my wounds sake to give their suffrage Please you that may pass this doing Sir The people must have their voices Pray you go fit you to the custom It is a part that shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people Mark you that To brag unto them Thus did and thus Show them the unaching scars which should hide as if had received them for the hire of their breath only To our noble consul wish we all joy and honor The senate Coriolanus are well pleased to make thee consul do owe them still my life and services It then remains that you do speak to the people Let me overleap that custom The people must have their voices Have you not known the worthiest men have done it Custom calls me to it What custom wills in all things should we do it What must say Look sir my wounds got them in my countrys service me the gods You must not speak like that You must desire them to think upon you Think upon me Hang em would they would forget me Pray you speak to them pray you in wholesome manner Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean You know the cause sir of my standing here We do sir Tell us what hath brought you to it Mine own desert Your own desert Aye but not mine own desire How not your own desire No it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging You must think if we give you anything we hope to gain by you Well then pray your price of the consulship The price is to ask it kindly Kindly sir pray let me have it have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private Your good voice sir What say you You shall have it worthy sir match sir Theres in all two worthy voices begged Adieu But this is something odd Pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voice that may be consul Youve deserved nobly of your country and youve not deserved nobly Your enigma Youve been a scourge to her enemies youve been a rod to her friends Youve not indeed loved the common people You should account me the more virtuous that have not been common in my love We hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily ll make much of your voices and so trouble you no further Gods give you joy sir heartily Your voices For your voices have fought Watched for your voices For your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd Battles thrice six have seen and heard of For your voices have done many things some less some more Your voices Indeed would be consul He has done nobly and cannot go without any honest mans voice Aye Aye Therefore let him be consul Amen Amen Amen Amen Amen Worthy voices Worthy voices worthy voices You have stood your limitation And the tribunes now endow you with the peoples voice Is this done The custom of request you have discharged The people do admit you and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation Where At the senate There Coriolanus May change these garments You may sir ll keep you company Will you along We stay here for the people God save thee noble consul Consul Consul Consul Consul Consul Consul How now my masters Whoa whoa whoa whoa hey whoa whoa whoa Whoa my masters My masters My masters how now Have you chose this man Aye He has our voices sir We pray the gods he may deserve your loves Amen sir To my poor unworthy notice he mocked us when he begged our voices He mocked us Flouted us downright no no no it is his kind of speech Aye He did not mock us He should have showed us his marks of merit wounds received for his country Yes Why m sure so he did No he didnt No no no No No No one saw them Was this mockery Yes When he had no power but was a petty servant to the state he was your enemy Ever spake against your liberties Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush Aye It is not confirmed It is not confirmed We may deny him yet And will deny him ll have voices of that sound Yes twice and their friends Yes Get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties Let them assemble and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election Enforce his pride and his old hate unto you And presently when you have drawn the number repair to the senate Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army He has my lord Saw you Aufidius Hes retired to Antium Spoke he of me He did my lord How What How often he had met you sword to sword That of all things upon the earth he hated your person most At Antium lives he At Antium wish had a cause to seek him there to oppose his hatred fully Come Rome must know the value of her own Behold these are the tribunes of the people the tongues of the common mouth Pass no further Ah What is that It will be dangerous to go on No further What makes this change The matter Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons Cominius no Have had childrens voices Tribunes give away The people are incensed against him Are these your herd Be calm be calm The people cry you mocked them and of late called them timepleasers flatterers foes to nobleness Why this was known before You show too much of that for which the people stir If you will pass to where you are bound you must inquire your way with a gentler spirit Lets be calm The people are abused set on This was my speech and ll speak it again Not now not now Not in this heat sir My nobler friends crave their pardons For the mutable rankscented many let them regard me as do not flatter and therein behold themselves say again in soothing them we nourish against our senate the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have ploughed for sowed and scattered by mingling them with us the honored number who lack not virtue no nor power but that which we have given to beggars Well no more No more words we beseech you You speak of the people as if you were a god to punish not a man of their infirmity It were well we let the people know it Were as patient as the midnight sleep by Jove it would be my mind It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is not poison any further Shall remain Hear you this Triton of the minnows Mark you his absolute shall Why should the people give one that speaks thus their voice ll give my reasons more worthier than their voices By Jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break open the locks of the senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles Come enough Enough with overmeasure He has spoken like a traitor and shall answer as traitors do Thou wretch despite overwhelm thee Manifest treason This is a consul No Seize him Hence old goat On both sides more respect Shh Shh Heres he that would take from you all your power You are at point to lose your liberties Martius would have all from you Martius whom late you have named for consul What is the city but the people True The

All will be naught else Come sir along with us As do know the consuls worthiness so can name his faults Consul What consul The Consul Coriolanus He consul It is decreed he dies tonight Hes a disease that must be cut away hes a limb that hath but a disease Mortal to cut it off to cure it easy What has he done to Rome thats worth his death eh Killing our enemies The blood he hath lost he dropped it for his country This is clean kam Well hear no more Consider this Hes been bred in the wars since he could draw a sword and is illschooled in graceful language Give me leave ll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form in peace to his utmost peril Noble tribunes it is the humane way Menenius Be you then as the peoples officer In you bring not Martius well proceed in our first way ll bring him to you Let them pull all about mine ears present me death on the wheel or at wild horses heels yet will still be thus to them Martius muse my mother does not approve me further talk of you Why would you wish me milder Would you have me false to my nature Rather say play the man am Sir sir would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out Let go You might have been enough the man you are with striving less to be so Let them hang Aye and burn too Come come youve been too rough something too rough You must return and mend it Theres no remedy unless by not so doing our good city cleave in the midst and perish Pray be counseled have a heart as little apt as yours but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage Well said noble woman And what must do Return to the tribunes What then What then Repent what you have spoke For them cannot do it to the gods Must then do it to them You are too absolute ve heard you say that honor and policy like unsevered friends in war do grow together Why force you this Because that now it lies you on to speak to the people not by your own instruction nor by the matter your heart prompts you but with such words that are but roted in your tongue though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosoms truth would dissemble with my nature where my fortune and my friends at stake required should do so in honor am in this your wife your son the senators nobles and you prithee now my son go to them be with them say to them thou art their soldier And being bred in broils has not the soft way in asking their good loves But thou wilt frame thyself forsooth hereafter theirs This but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours prithee go and be ruled Sir it is fit you make strong party or defend yourself by calmness or by absence Alls in anger Only fair speech think it will serve if he can thereto frame his spirit He must He will Prithee now say you will and go about it Must with base tongue give my noble heart a lie that it must bear Well ll do it Away my disposition and possess me some harlots spirit beggars tongue make motion through my lips will not do it Lest cease to honor mine own truth and by my bodys action teach my mind a most inherent baseness At thy choice then To beg of thee is more my dishonor than thou of them Come all to ruin Let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness for mock at death with as big heart as thou Do as you like Thy valiantness was mine thou suckst it from me but owe thy pride thyself Pray be content Mother m going Chide me no more Look am going ll return consul or never trust to what my tongue can do in the way of flattery further Do your will In this point charge him home that he affects tyrannical power If he evade us there enforce him with his hatred to the people Have you a catalog of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll have Its ready When the people hear me say It shall be so in the right and strength of the commons be it either for death for fine or banishment then let them if they hear me say Fine cry Fine If Death cry Death We shall inform them God preserve thee The people are the city Put not your worthy rage into your tongue Calmly beseech you The honored gods The honored gods keep Rome in safety and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men plant love among us throng our large temples with the shows of peace and not our streets with war Amen amen noble wish Shall be charged no further than this present Must all determine here do demand if you submit you to the peoples voices Aye am content Lo citizens he says he is content The warlike service he has done consider Think upon the wounds his body bears which show like graves in the holy churchyard Scratches with briers scars to move laughter only Consider further that when he speaks not like a citizen you find him like a soldier Do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds but as say such as become a soldier What is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again We charge you that you have contrived to take from Rome all seasoned office and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical for which you are a traitor to the people How traitor Traitor Nay temperately Your promise The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people Call me their traitor thou injurious tribune Mark you this people Yes Traitor But since he hath served well for Rome What do you prate of service talk of that that know it You Is this the promise you made your mother ll know no further Let them pronounce death exile flaying would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word In the name of the people and in the power of us the tribunes we even from this instant banish him our city In the peoples name say it shall be so It shall be so Hes banished It shall be so It shall be so It shall be so Hear me my masters and my common friends Hes sentenced No more hearing Let me speak It shall be so have been consul and can show for Rome her enemies marks upon me There is no more to be said but he is

shall be so It shall be so It shall be so It shall be so It shall be so You common cry of curs Whose breath hate as reeks of the rotten fens whose loves prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air banish you And there remain with your uncertainty Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts Your enemies with nodding of their caps fan you into despair Have the power still to banish your defenders till at length your ignorance which finds not till it feels making but reservation of yourselves still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows Despising for you the city thus turn my back There is a world elsewhere The peoples enemy is gone Whoo Nay Mother where is your ancient courage You are too absolute Nay Mother shall be loved when am lacked go alone like to a lonely dragon The gods preserve you both Good day to you all The gods keep you This is a happier and more comely time Yeah Good day Good day here comes his mother Lets not meet her They say shes mad youre well met The hoarded plague of the gods requite thy love Will you be gone You shall stay too would had the power to say so to my husband Are you mad Aye fool is that a shame tell thee what fool hadst thou craft to banish him that struck more blows for Rome than thou hast spoken words Blessed heavens More noble blows than ever thou wise words and for Romes good Yet go Nay thou shalt stay too tell thee what would my son were in Arabia and thy tribe before him his good sword in his hand What then What then Hed make an end of thy posterity Bastards and all Come Come peace Well well well leave you Why stay we to be baited by one who wants her wits would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses Could meet them but once a day it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it You have told them home And by my troth you have cause Youll sup with me Angers my meat sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding Come Come madam Hey Aufidius Ah general Yes Well well Hey hey Whence comes thou Thy name Speak man Whats thy name name unmusical to the Volscians ears and harsh in sound to thine Say whats thy name Thou has a grim appearance Whats thy name Knowst thou me yet know thee not Thy name My name is Caius Martius who hath done to thee particularly and to all the Volsces great hurt and mischief Thereto witness may my surname Coriolanus Only that name remains The cruelty and envy of the people who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest and suffered me by the voice of slaves to be whooped out of Rome Now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope mistake me not to save my life for if had feared death of all men in the world would have avoided thee But in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand before thee here will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends But if thou dares not this then present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice which not to cut would show thee but a fool since have ever followed thee with hate and cannot live but to thy shame unless it be to do thee service Martius Martius Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy Let me twine mine arms about that body Know thou loved the maid married never man sighed truer breath But that see thee here thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold Why thou Mars tell thee thou hast beat me out several times and have nightly since dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me Worthy Martius had we no quarrel else to Rome but that thou art thence banished we would muster all from to and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful Rome like a bold flood overbear it Come go in and take our friendly senators by the hands You bless me gods Therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges take the one half of my commission And set down as best thou art experienced since thou knows thy countrys strength and weakness thine own ways whether to knock against the gates of Rome or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them ere destroy Is this Menenius tis he tis he hes grown most kind of late Hail sir Hail to you both Your Coriolanus is not much missed but with his friends Alls well and might have been much better if he could have temporized Where is he hear you hear nothing His mother and his wife hear nothing from him Caius Martius was a worthy officer in the war but insolent overcome with pride ambitious past all thinking selfloving think not so And Rome sits safe and still without him Shh Shh There are reports the Volsces with two several powers are entered in the Roman territories and with the deepest malice of the war destroy what lies before them Shh Tis Aufidius who hearing of our Martius banishment thrusts forth his horns into the world again Come what talk you of Martius It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us Cannot be We have record that it can The nobles in great earnestness are going all to the Senate House Some news is coming that turns their countenances Yes the first report is seconded and more more fearful is delivered Martius has joined with Aufidius He leads a power against Rome and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngest and oldest thing fearful army led by Caius Martius associated with Aufidius rages upon our territories and have already overborne their way consumed with fire and took what lay before them Martius has joined with the Volscians He is their god He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies Do they still fly to the Roman do not know what witchcrafts in him but your soldiers use him as the grace before meat their talk at table and their thanks at end And you are darkened in this action sir He bears himself more proud even to my person than thought he would when first did embrace him Sir beseech you think you hell carry Rome think hell be to Rome as is the osprey to the fish who takes it by sovereignty of nature Whether it was pride whether defect of judgment or whether nature not to be other than one thing made him feared so hated and so banished so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time One fire drives out one fire one nail one nail Rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail When Caius Rome is thine thou art poorest of all then shortly art thou mine No ll not go Good Menenius Go you that banished him mile before his tent fall down and kneel the way into his mercy He would not seem to know me urged our old acquaintance and the drops that we have bled together Coriolanus he would not answer to forbad all names He was a kind of nothing Titleless Till he had forged himself a name in the fire of burning Rome If you refuse your aid in this If you would be your countrys pleader your good tongue more than the instant army we can make might stop our countryman No ll not meddle Pray you go to him What should do Only make trial what your love can do for Rome towards Martius Well and say Martius return me as Titus is returned unhurt What then Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome You know the very road into his kindness and cannot lose your way ll undertake it think hell hear me Hell never hear him No tell you he does sit in gold his eye red as it would burn Rome The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does Martius Martius Thou art preparing fire for us Look thee theres water to quench it was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome Away How Away Wife mother child know not My affairs are servanted to others Sir Therefore be gone Another word Menenius will not hear thee speak This Martius is grown from man to dragon He has wings Hes more than a creeping thing There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger My lord and husband These eyes are not the same wore in Rome The sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so Best of my flesh forgive my tyranny but do not say for that Forgive our Romans a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge Ye gods prate and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted Sink my knee in the earth Stand up blest Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint kneel before thee Whats this Your knees to me To your corrected son Thou art my warrior helped to frame thee This is a poor epitome of yours which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself The god of soldiers inform thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove to shame invulnerable Your knee sir Even he your wife this lady and myself are suitors to you beseech you peace Or if youd ask remember this Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers or capitulate again with Romes mechanics Tell me not wherein seem unnatural Desire not to allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons No more no more You have said you will not grant us anything for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already Yet we will ask that if you fail in our request the blame may hang upon your hardness Therefore hear us Aufidius and you Volsces mark For well hear naught from Rome in private Your request Should we be silent and not speak our raiment and state of bodies would betray what life we have led since thy exile Think with thyself How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither since that thy sight which should make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother wife and child to see the son the husband and the father tearing his countrys bowels out And we must find an evident calamity though we had our wish which side should win For either thou must as a foreign recreant be led with manacles through our streets or else triumphantly tread on thy countrys ruin and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and childrens blood For myself son purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine If cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end to one thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread on thy mothers womb that brought thee to this world Aye and mine that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time You shall not tread on me ll run away till m bigger but then ll fight have sat too long Nay go not from us thus If it were so that our request did tend to save the Romans thereby to destroy the Volsces whom you serve thou mightst condemn us as poisonous of your honor No Our suit is that you reconcile them So that the Voices may say This mercy we have showed the Romans This weve received and each on either side give the allhail to thee and cry Be blest for making up this peace Speak to me son Why dost not speak Speak you daughter He cares not for your weeping Speak thou boy Perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons Theres no man in the world more bound to his mother yet here he lets me prate like one in the stocks Thou hast never in thy life shown thy dear mother any courtesy when she poor hen has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaded with honor Say my requests unjust and spurn me back but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee that thou restrains from me the duty which to a mothers part belongs Down ladies Let us shame him with our knees Down This is the last An end So we will home to Rome and die among our neighbors Nay Beholdst this boy that cannot tell what he would have yet kneels and holds up hands for fellowship Does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny it Come let us go This fellow had a Volscian to his mother His wife is in Corioles and his child like him by chance Yet give us our dispatch am hushed until our city be afire and then ll speak a little Mother Mother What have you done Behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at my mother Mother You have won a happy victory to Rome But for your son believe it believe it Most dangerously you have prevailed with him If not most mortal to him But let it come Aufidius though cannot make true wars ll frame convenient peace Now good Aufidius were you in my stead would you have heard a mother less Or granted less Aufidius was moved withal dare be sworn you were And sir it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion But good sir what peace youll make advise me merrier day did never yet greet Rome No not the expulsion of the Tarquins We have all great cause to give great thanks Behold our patroness the life of Rome How is it with our general As with a man by his own charity slain Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst twixt you theres difference but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all know it And my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction raised him and pawned mine honor for his truth who being so heightened he watered his new plants with dews of flattery seducing so my friends At the last seemed his follower not partner and he waged me with his countenance as if had been mercenary So he did my lord The army marveled at it And in the last when he had carried Rome and that we looked for no less spoil than glory There was it For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him At a few drops of womens rheum which are as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labor of our great action Therefore shall he die and ll renew me in his fall Say no more am returned your soldier no more infected with my countrys love than when parted hence but still subsisting under your great command We have made peace with no less honor to the Volscians than shame to the Romans Tell the traitor in the highest degree he hath abused your powers Traitor How now Aye traitor Martius Martius Aye Martius Caius Martius Dost thou think ll grace thee with that robbery thy stolen name Coriolanus Perfidiously he hath betrayed your business and given up for certain drops of salt your city Rome say your city for his wife and mother Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk Never admitting counsel of the war but at his nurses tears he whined and roared away your victory Hearst thou Mars Name not the god thou boy of tears Measureless liar thou has made my heart too great for what contains it Boy slave Cut me to pieces Volsces Men and lads stain all your edges on me Boy If you have writ your annals true tis there that like an eagle in a dovecote fluttered your Volscians in Corioles Alone did it Boy Let him die for it
