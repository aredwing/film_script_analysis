accident that would allow a stranger to seamlessly take your place These people may be good but they are not God little confirmation would be nice Somewhere theres proof They cant have thought of everything The question is why would they want to take your place What could they gain from being you What does your wife gain by denying you exist Do you believe me In the Stasi we had a basic principle Ask enough questions and a man who is lying will eventually change his story but a man who tells the truth cannot change his however unlikely his story sounds Do you believe me believe you are telling the truth Dr Harris ll start by calling your colleague at Langemore As you say its Thanksgiving and theres the time difference so it may take time to make contact Then there is the

both progressives Bressler wants to end world hunger Hes researching new forms of crop cultivation offering open access to his data The prince funds his work He knows the world will need food long after his oil resources are depleted Those agricultural patents will be worth a fortune But the princes progressiveness has cost him Extremists in his own country hate him and yet he perseveres his course despite multiple attempts on his life Theres a cocktail party before Bresslers speech tonight is that correct Yes For some that might be a very good reason to want to be you Martin Harris with
