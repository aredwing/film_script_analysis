Wilson Mrs Wilson Mrs Wilson your husband Ben Wilson Senior was one of the men killed last year in the explosion out at the Reinhold Cable Plant Yes thats right And you were left with three small children to raise on your own Yes sir How do you provide for you and your sons get a little bit of money from Social Security as a result of my husbands death And also give readings Psychic readings Yes sir What does being psychic enable you to do see things and you know sense things that well they hadnt happened yet or they were happening someplace else My granny told me that had a gift that runs in my family And she told me that shouldnt be afraid of it should just always use my instinct and d d be all right So youre swearing before this court that you didnt get your information about this tragedy from any other means than your special ability Your gift Yes sir m swearing that Yes Thank you Mrs Wilson Yes sir have no further questions Mr Weems Mrs Wilson How many fingers am holding up behind my back Objection Your Honor Your Honor my client is sitting in this courtroom on trial for his life partly because of powers that this woman claims to have Now in all fairness believe should be given the opportunity to test the alleged powers instead of having to stand here and take her word for it You have a good point Objection overruled Can everyone in the jury box see how many fingers m showing How many fingers Mrs Wilson dont know You dont know Seven Seven fingers That That doesnt prove anything Your Honor cant do this you know at the drop of a hat Well then maam how about doing it at the drop of a dollar bill What are you trying to say m trying to say maybe this special gift of yours doesnt work unless youre being paid for it Like they say in the army No money no honey No thats not true Are you aware that in Hatcher County its against the law for a psychic to set up shop and charge people money Well dont charge money You just testified that you do charge money No accept donations People give me gifts Oh distinction worthy of a lawyer Mrs Wilson you a rich woman No Why not If had psychic powers and could read the future d be filthy rich d be playing the Stock Market d be over in Mobile betting on the dogs d certainly warn my husband not to go to work on the day know the Reinhold Plants gonna blow up leaving three little ol children to be raised in a carnival sideshow Well it doesnt work that way sir cant use my gift for personal gain Except for those what you call em donations Youve had some personal trouble with Donnie Barksdale havent you Yes have Just a few weeks ago you told him believe the exact words was you was gonna have his ass thrown in jail But he was threatening my kids Aint it also true that a few weeks ago in one of those famous readings of yours when you were doing your socalled you told Valerie Barksdale Donnies wife that Donnie was just an insecure redneck and that he wasnt really crazy enough to kill anybody Yes did say that Then why today are you saying he did kill somebody Wait a second ve never said that You might as well have maam You wanted his ass in jail Hes on trial for his life just told the sheriff what saw And how could any of us ever forget that Jessica King just floatin up in that tree naked with a chain wrapped around her It must be so much fun for you You must be having the time of your life entertaining yourself with your dreams and your visions You think its fun seeing decomposed bodies in my tree do you sir You think thats fun Do you think its fun have people trying to strangle me in my sleep Now m sitting here and m blaming myself cause some poor crazy man tried to burn his daddy half to death And you think m sitting here having fun m sorry sir Youre crazy if you think that No more questions Your Honor Youre dismissed Like they say in Hollywood lets just cut to the chase Did you or did you not kill Jessica King did not Did you or did you not see Jessica King on the night she was killed Yeah seen her Would you describe the circumstances please Well d been seeing her for quite a while Would you clarify what you mean by seeing mean her and me had been having sex Okay go ahead Well she called me about So told her d meet her out at Ay Jays And told my wife was going out for a beer What happened after that Well we got in an argument She told me she didnt want to see me no more Did she tell you why She said she was getting married in a couple of months and she wanted to stop playing around At least till after the wedding And during the course of this argument with Miss King did you at any moment strike her Yes sir What happened after you struck her Well she banged her head pretty hard when she went down so decided to take her to the hospital Did you reach the hospital No sir Are you feeling okay m fine wanna go back dont wanna go to the hospital Someone Someone might see me She said she was feeling better so took her back to Ay Jays dropped her off then went on back home And that was the very last time that you saw Jessica King alive Yes sir The very last Donnie are you guilty of the charge against you m guilty of cheating on my wife of being a bad husband a bad Christian But aint guilty of killing Jesse swear to God No more questions Your Honor Mr Duncan Mr Barksdale youre a wifebeater arent you ve swore to tell the truth here today Yeah ve hit Valerie before guess it aint no secret So you admit to having a history of violence against women You also admit to having beaten up the victim on the night that she was murdered wouldnt exactly say that beat her up Youre the expert You tell me Just how badly do you have to beat a woman before it fits your definition of beating up Now your story is that youve been having an affair with the victim But tell us why a beautiful young woman like Jessica King from one of the finest families in Brixton just about to be married to a good decent professional man and with a bright shining future in front of her Why would a woman like that get involved with something like you asked her that myself one time She said was the only man in town who knew how to fuck Youre really disgusting You know that Objection Your Honor Objection sustained Mr Duncan you will refrain from making those personal comments apologize Your Honor It wont happen again So lets get this straight Lets clarify this Youre saying it was just a coincidence that on the very same night that you physically assaulted Jessica King someone else put her body in your pond m not saying it was a coincidence What are you saying m saying got framed Oh well what an original defense Did you think of Jessica King as a stray cat No Did you tell Sheriff Johnson that a stray cat had clawed your arm Yeah Didnt you just tell the court Jessica had scratched your arm Yeah but Didnt you tell Sheriff Johnson you got scratched by the stray cat because she didnt like it when you killed her Yeah but was lying My wife was standing right there How do know youre not lying now Because m not goddamn it Its her goddamn it Be seated Mr Barksdale Shes the reason m up here Shes a goddamn witch Shes putting spells on everygoddamnbody in town Witch Witch Yeah you run ll have order in the courtroom In Brixton today a sensational murder trial was concluded Donald Barksdale was found guilty in the sex and strangulation killing of Jessica King daughter of the prominent Brixton businessman Kenneth King Is everything gonna be all right now Mama Yeah hon We can get on with our lives now guess m the last person you wanna see How you been Terrible Annie if you tell me to get going will wouldnt blame you But need you to read for me Give me a hand feel like cant hold on any longer know Donnies mean and everything but feel real lost without him You know aint never been on my own before And m scared Annie You dont need to be scared hon Youll be fine You see that in the cards Right through here But can you see what what m thinking

hes guilty No Wayne see it see he didnt do it Do you see who did m trying but dont know yet What are we gonna do Well if had a piece of clothing or maybe could go out to the pond or see if Its not over Jesus Come on in Well what brings you out here Well ll just come straight out and say it dont think Donnie Barksdale killed Jessica King Well sure he did It was an openandshut case m telling you he didnt The person that killed Jessica is still out there someplace Whats the deal The Barksdales been threatening you No ll talk to Pearl Johnson This has nothing to do with the Barksdales Listen know that Donnie didnt kill Jessica the same way that knew that her body was in his pond And do you know who did kill her No So what do you care The son of a bitch is in jail got a warning today think somebody is gonna try and kill me What do you want me to do Reopen the case and find out who really did it cant Hes been convicted Well you can talk to somebody ve got no basis to open this case d look like a fool dont give a damn how you look Now you listen to me know you had an affair with Jessica So how do you think youre gonna look if people find out you had sex with the victim the night before she was killed Do you want money No want you to reopen the case Theres a saying about letting sleeping dogs lie You think youre in danger now Look at it logically The real danger begins if this case gets reopened and someone starts worrying that youre gonna have another one of your damn dreams All know is the wrong mans in jail dont care how awful he is And helped put him there cant live with something like that So you find a way to reopen this case sir Or will Buddy Buddy m here if you Hello Hi Miss Francis m back Good How are the boys Theyre fine They went to sleep You want me to
