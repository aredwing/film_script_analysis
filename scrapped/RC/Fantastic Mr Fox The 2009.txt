total per diem Nate Bunce is a duck and goose farmer Hes approximately the size of a potbellied dwarf and his chin would be under water in the shallow end of any swimming pool on the planet His food is homemade doughnuts with smashedup goose livers injected into them Frank Bean is a turkey and apple farmer He invented his own species of each He lives on a liquid diet of strong alcoholic cider which he makes from his apples Hes as skinny as a pencil as smart as a whip and possibly the scariest man currently living The local human children sing a kind of eerie little rhyme about him Here

very long time ago May have a word with you privately Well were in a hole Just on the other side of this mineral deposit Follow me m gonna lose my temper now When Right now Well when Oh my God Twelve foxyears ago you made a promise to me while we were caged inside that foxtrap that if we survived you would never steal another chicken goose turkey duck or squab whatever they are And believed you Why Why did you lie to me Because m a wild animal Youre also a husband and a father m trying to tell you the truth about myself dont care about the truth about yourself This story is too predictable Predictable Really What happens in the end In the end we all die unless you change Petey listen Run down to the rentals department over at Malloy Consolidated and place an order for shall we say one Mighty Max one Junior Spitfire and a longrange Tornado Turbo For immediate delivery Ash are you mad at me understand if you are and m sorry wouldnt have ever involved your cousin if realized you would

care Well then whyre you deadset on Can ask you a question You may Whats the point of sitting on the floor with your legs twisted into a pretzel talking to yourself for an hour and fortyfive minutes Its weird My father and first started practicing meditation together when was Yeah Well thats great But d worry more about what that does for your reputation than whether or not you have beagle ticks or not dont Nor pelt lice One of those slovenly farmers is probably wearing my tail as a necktie by now Youre paranoid Foxy Farmer thank you Correct me if am misreading the data youve successfully destroyed the scenery but the alleged fox Look at Dads tie What will you three prominent farmers do now Well Dan can tell you what were not going to do Were not gonna let him go Stand clear please Stand clear everyone Contact Boggis how many men did you got working on your farm Thirty five Bunce Thirty six And ve got thirtyseven Thats d say a hundred and eight altogether Petey Drop everything and assemble all hundred and eight members of our entire three combined workforces Were gonna starve them out and then kill them Starting in shall we say fifteen minutes An estimated a hundred and eight snipers are currently in position surrounding the demolished fox residence Many local animals whod appear to be trapped underground without provisions of any kind at this point If had a crystal ball d predict a fairly grisly outcome to the situation But we stand on the scene watching closely as events continue to unfold This is gonna be a total cluster cuss for everybody How long can a fox go without food or water Well can only answer as an opossum but dont think can last more than another couple of hours before get completely dehydrated and starve to death Whats that Dad Not a sound You scared the cuss out of us lot of good animals are probably gonna die because of you Weve been digging in circles for three days Half the woods have been obliterated Nobody can get out Right now my wifes huddled at the bottom of the flintmine with no food no water and twenty seven starving animal brats just want to see a little sunshine But youre nocturnal Phil Your eyes barely even open on a good day m sick of your doubletalk We have rights We dont like you and we hate your dad Now grab some of that mud chew it in your mouth and swallow it m not gonna eat mud Cuss yeah you are Dont do that Whyd you take your shoes off So dont break your nose when kick it can fight my own fights No you cant Those farmers arent gonna quit until theyve got you and every member of your family nailed upsidedown to a bloody stick with your eyes gorged out This is getting a little too personal Give me a minute ve got an idea What is it It could be a good one Lay it on us It might save our lives Say the idea Alright Lets try it Go to the flintmine Tell Mrs Badger et al that help is on the way Is help on the way sure as cuss hope so Ash know what its like to feel different m not different am We all are Him especially But theres something kind of fantastic about that isnt there Not to me d prefer to be an athlete Gentlemen this time we must dig in a very special direction got to kind of feel out the vibe Begin Come on hit it slap in the middle Do you get how incredible this is About a handsome little fox Let me sing you folks a yarn Hey diddledee doddledo doodledum It was a splendid little feller Full of wit n grace n charm Say zippyzee yappyyo googlegum Well like any little critter needing Vittels for his littluns Well he stole and he cheated And he lied to survive Doodledum diddledie doddlediddledoodledee Zippyzo zippyzay zippyzappyzoopyzee Doodledum Doodledum Let me take a little tick now To color in the scene Across the valley lived three yokels Name of Boggis Bunce and Bean Now these three crazy jackies had our hero on the run Shot the tail off the cuss With a foxshooting gun But that stylish little fox Was as clever as a whip Dug as quick as a gopher Who was a hyperackative Now those three farmers sit It where theres a hole it was once a hill Singing diddledee doddledo doodledum And as far as can reckon Theyre asetting up there still Singing zippyzee yappyyo What are you singing Petey Just just making up one as went along really Thats just weak songwriting You wrote a bad song Petey We took everything They took everything Let me call you back Petey Well theyd be anywhere by now Theyre digging right under our feet Well in a sense weve only made matters worse We should have stayed out of it ve got an idea m still not getting a signal Is anyboby getting any reception dont have any signal but ve got a problem Crisp up those ducks Aye drag those chickens Slow them down just a little bit were a little ahead Where are the apples Stiil out You still have them raw Well slice them up Lets get them in the pantry can imagine how painful even just emotionally that must be for you Well you know its not the end of the world Oh but Foxy how humiliating Having your whole tail blown clean off Can we drop it Yeah its really good Sweet and nice Hey they say youre a natural True or false just Answer the question True guess Correct Get out of here Agnes need to have a private word with Kristofferson Just a minute She doesnt dont mind m gonna go talk to them Listen to me just had a brainstorm for something fantastic ve got to do But cant do it alone m not interested Hear me out No thanks think foxes from your side of the family take unnecessary risks Only because they got the guts in their blood and so do we Was a bit rude to Agnes Yeah d probably say something shoudnt ll say something to her in a minute Whats the brainstorm In a nutshell Were gonna steal back my dads tail Okay chief Here we go Well it took a near catastrophe for all of you to finally take me up on my offer to have you over to the flintmine for dinner but guess we have m sorry Maybe my invitation got lost in the mail Does anybody know what this badgers talking about Hey hold on But Clives right In all seriousness Excuse me guess we do have these three ugly farmers to thank for one thing reminding us to be thankful and aware of each other m gonna say it again Aware dont feel safe Thats because were not You should probably put on your bandit hat now Personally dont have one but modified this tube sock We look good Yeah we do Now where would you keep a prized tail if you collected them if that was your hobby d probably hang it over the mantelpiece Right Good In fact whats that smell Ever tasted one of Mrs Beans famous nutmeggingerapplesnaps Well didnt do They are still warm We got it wrong What Its not over the mantelpiece The necktie Lets go What Hang on wanna do more Shes there She cant see Look at each other Here we are Wow Now ve already had too much to drink and m feeling sentimental but m gonna say something anyway which nobody wants to admit but think is probably true We beat them We beat those farmers and now were triumphantly eating their roasted chicken their sizzling duck their succulent turkey their foie gras de Where did the boys go What Where Ash Kristofferson Boys Oh my God That was crazy cant believe what just happened in there Come on lets go out of here Lets go Where are we Where are we Where are we What Kristofferson What am hearing again baby Whats happening Am still paranoid Cider What just happened

Kristofferson Wrap this wet little mutt in a newspaper and put him in a box with some holes punched in the top Theres only one way out of this sewer but the manhole covers closed and theres a station wagon parked on it Which means were permanently stuck down here You still think we beat them Foxy Badgers right These farmers arent gonna quit until they catch me shouldnt have lied to your face shouldnt have fallen off the wagon and started secretly stealing chickens on the sly shouldnt have pushed these farmers so far and tried to embarrass them and cuss with their heads enjoyed it but shouldnt have done it And now theres only one way out Maybe if hand myself over and let them kill me stuff me and hang me over their mantelpiece Youll do no such thing Darling maybe theyll let everyone else live Oh why did you have to get us into this Foxy dont know but have a possible theory think have this thing where need everybody to think m the greatest the quoteunquote fantastic Mr Fox And if they arent completely knockedout and dazzled and kind of intimidated by me then dont feel good about myself Foxes traditionally like to court danger hunt prey and outsmart predators And thats what m actually good at think at the end of the day m just know Were wild animals guess we always were promise you if had all this to do over again d have never let you down It was always more fun when we did it together anyway love you Felicity love you too But shouldnt have married you Did ever tell you about the time learned we were gonna have a cub In the foxtrap Right We were at gunpoint and your mother said shes pregnant Let me tell it okay had no idea how we were gonna get out of this jam and then it hit me what do foxes do better than any other animal Dig Youre stepping on my lines Right keep telling it So we dug And the whole time put paw over paw scooping dirt and pebbles with your mother digging like crazy beside me kept wondering who is this little boy gonna be Or girl Or girl right Because at that point we didnt know Ash m so glad he was you Its not your fault its mine Goodbye Well guess we should uh probably split into a certain number of groups and start doing something right Can have a glass of water Excuse me Excuse me Kristofferson Hello Can you hear us Kristofferson They got the boy They want to trade the son for his poppa Whyd they write this in letters cut out of magazines To protect their identities Oh right but then why did they sign their names Plus we already knew who they were because theyre trying to kill us Mr Fox we have your son If
