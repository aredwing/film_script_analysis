Your pupil is on Dad Really Did he contact you We had tea and he walked me home Ip Man was my Dad Judging from his scholarly appearance Few could tell that hes a martial arts expert and Master to a world renowned action star My parents both hailed from wealthy Foshan families Nothing was lacking in our family until the Japanese came and seized everything we had My two young sisters were starved to death Dad believed a man should see the world and hes a manofhisownword Despite his chronic stomach illness he came alone to Hong Kong in Where is this place Over there Thank you Youre welcome Coming Who is it m looking for Lee Man my name is lp Master lp Lees out but he told me to expect you Come in My name is Leung Sheung They say youre famous in Foshan Perhaps can see for myself You will

Try our local specialty mealonaplate Indeed allinone Fewer dishes to wash too No more fourcourse meals these days That was a lifetime ago for me The recent influx of immigrants made it hard to make a living You wont get a job without a sponsor But you must have good connections so that shouldnt be a problem You dont really need a job just open a martial arts school Not unless its absolutely necessary Dont you want to teach Yes but dont want to run a school Come this way This is Master lp Hello Master lp Master lp is from Foshan His Wing Chun is awesome Hell give lessons on our rooftop from now on Please help tidy up the place and make room King Sei Mui Give us a hand This way Master With capability comes strong personalities making it hard to find a sponsor and hence a job But such is fate If Master had a cushy desk job he may not have become the Grandmaster that he is If wasnt heading the Restaurant Workers Union and had a say in most things he may never have taught on our rooftop and couldnt have introduced Wing Chun to others Barbecued pork buns Chan Sei Mui is a dim sum girl Shes a huge fan of martial arts novels dreams of upholding justice like her fictional heroines Tang Sing is a cop who doesnt say much to anyone but Master and keeps everything to himself Lee King is the darling of her factory Shes tough with a strong sense of justice often speaking out for fellow workers You should make hay instead Wong Tung is a prison warden whos a quick learner Master says he has a temper like a bull Ng Chan is a tram driver and Wong Tungs best friend People come from all walks of life Yet Master has three unteachables Halfwits wise guys and those who cant make ends meet have no business learning kungfu think what made him the Grandmaster was his nononsense teaching approach Hes flexible and never rigid so all pupils can learn quickly Some are always itching to pick a fight That move doesnt count What are you doing Hey Enough bullshit What do you want Bullshit What about you Youre a lousy player spare me the crap dare you to repeat that With pleasure This is chess and youre shit Youre asking for a beating You dont scare me They seem to know kungfu

behind bars and watch over them So whos more important You of course But you trashed someones shop He called us and the case is booked Tell me what to do Figure it out Youre the cop taught you for a year and you go around picking fights If teach you for another year either you will kill someone or someone will kill you Kungfu is pointless if you cant use it It is not about picking fights Kungfu is about developing your physical well being There are other ways to achieve that Jogging skipping rope football swimming Then why dont you jog Stop the backchat If teach you how to swim you can swim far or save a life But never push others into the sea Kungfu is not about picking fights Only brutes use force wise men use virtue When practicing kungfu integrity is vital Heres your punishment

Master Coming Theres my wife Wong Tung and Sei Mui got married in One more Wong Tung quit his job after he got married dont know why Then he decided to teach kungfu for a living He asked Master for a signboard and he inscribed one for him Authentic Wing Chun Some thought Master was partial to Wong Tung In fact he was the only one who dared to ask If the others had asked he would have done the same for them Now that you put up a signboard if you wish to turn someone away you must have a good excuse No wonder he refused to have a sign for his own school Its not in his character to find excuses

City Chan won five bouts in a row and made a ton of money Sing Hi Sis Were not interested Very well m off Think it over Very well Bravo Wong Tung won bouts in a row m very happy with the pool ll keep
