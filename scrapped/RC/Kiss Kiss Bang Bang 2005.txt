guy The ringer was a girl named Mia Frye When she wasnt impersonating Veronica Dexter she wore a pink wig But my sister sent you up to Big Bear Lake to his cabin Your sister was convinced that Dexter was her natural father so she started following him hanging around Do you see where m going with this One day your sister came calling and she saw Dexter in bed with the pinkhaired girl What she thought was father and daughter Remember thats how it would appear It was too much for her First the old father now the shiny new one She couldnt handle it and she took her own life What she hired me to film wasnt murder but incest m sorry So much for unreality said goodbye watched Johnnys world go back on the fiction shelf But while it lasted brother it was one for the books You shouldve told me
