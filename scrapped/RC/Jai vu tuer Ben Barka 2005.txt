countries film with archive footage and interviews documentary Yes a documentary On decolonization Decolonization crucial subject Very topical News programmes are a big hit on These new countries interest people But as for the financing We provide the financing Lets move on to the practical details then One of our compatriots will be your historical adviser Moroccan adviser Why not if he knows the subject m a professional see Efficiency matters He knows the subject colonialism imperialism capitalism Its his stock in trade His name is Mehdi Ben Barka Bernier has known him for years And know Bernier Always working always broke Easy to hire Ben Barka works internationally One day in Peking then Moscow then Havana Hes like an eel always on the move So you want to keep him in one place Hell

reasonable hope you have many enemies its a pleasure dealing with you See you Mr Figon Youre leaving already ll be in touch ll never be far away ll follow you at a distance Discreetly My lucky day Really In the month prior to the meeting hundreds of students and children who demonstrated in Casablanca were shot down by General Oufkirs police We now know that the King sent Ben Barka a message asking him to return to Morocco in a position of responsibility At the same time the secret services were making a film on decolonisation with Ben Barka as its historical adviser kept this for some reason They make good souvenirs tend to keep all my articles too Its a sort of kaleidoscope of my life But this is much more coherent the mirror of a lifes work He watches you He keeps an eye on me Did you see it recently My cellmate would whistle it every night It stopped him having nightmares Its the music from Mr Franjus Eyes Without Face very complex film to make Because of the star No the subject fantasy film with a scientist as the main character Science takes realism to its very extreme You cant cheat with a scientist Even to scare people Marguerite mentioned a screenplay The blackmail story have better now Thats why ve brought Bernier m warning you m not right for all subjects m sick of fake cop stories Theyre rubbish right Lads who never close doors after them That really gets my back up hood is cautious by nature No one takes him unawares The film intend to offer you is nothing like those films Its a film on politics political film ve never made one hate

You see what mean Algeria Vietnam Black Africa South America too You want me to make a film on colonization Better on decolonisation Think of the energy of millions of rebels after the war in the colonies Truly fantastic images men ready to die to change the rules See it is a film for you Can this kind of film interest people Backers mean It interests the whole world So it will interest backers have some serious contacts Especially with With Ben Barka as historical adviser Ben Barka The Moroccan opponent The Third Worlds leader The only one to bring together dissenting forces around the world He knows that The conference is set for January in Cuba with the film to inaugurate it In January Its already August We dont have a minute to lose Georges Thats not much time knew Ben Barka in when was with Radio Morocco The French had just deported Mohammed to Madagascar The French were arresting killing and torturing all the time Mauriac ended up founding an intellectuals committee in Paris Mauriac That reeks of holy water He wasnt alone There were leftwingers anarchists Gurin prefer that cant abide nuns its physical The prisons are full of them trying to make you feel remorse As if the Christians hadnt invented remorse was stupid enough to say that one evening on Mauriac wrote to Le Figaro to say that a man who said that had to be a true Christian the guys incorrigible Believe me Mohammed recovered his throne in thanks to men like Ben Barka and his incredible energy He got his nickname Dynamo at that time He cant be ignored They want him dead Ben Barka gave a progressive impulse to North African independence Progressive Yes against colonialism and those who try to define the anticolonial struggle as a war of religion against Christianity Here are your tickets Flight to Cairo You board in minutes Your bags are registered Tell me Mr Lopez that ruddy fellow Is he a cop indeed he is With the Drugs Squad sniff them out cant help it We often cooperate to

be a major first conference launched by a film Highly unusual The film will also be a first the first major overview of decolonisation With interviews with Third World leaders and unseen footage on decolonisation and the anticolonial struggle Can you help us get it Some of it is virtually newsreel stock Cameramen managed to film the massacres in Casablanca You see former Moroccan officers in the French army hard at work Is it true that Oufkir himself fired on the crowd from a helicopter Hot isnt it Paris is chillier My jaw brings back memories in this heat took a German bullet as Paris was

just need Ben Barka to sign have to make a quick call What is Phantoms hooded face fine But the most frightening thing is Phantoms without his mask when he walks in the crowd with nothing to set him apart Hell be here soon He knows the place He chose to meet here Ben Barka will receive two per cent of the films gross wound on the left parietal lobe that is the source of two heavy flows of blood The anterior thorax and the abdomen are against the floor The lower members are bent slightly with the two feet turning to the right of the supine body and the right arm under the abdomen Hard to explain how ended up like chis after shooting myself in the back of my head was good at gymnastics but this is absurd Your Honour Your Honour Pierre Auric in person the prosecutor at my trial in years

Boucheseiche You know some odd people What The had to be stopped Thanks to former Gestapo agents People can change You realise who Ben Barka was read the papers too He looks like a decent man m sad for him Looks can be deceiving mean look like a provincial solicitor Hes not the kind we come across Hes an idealist You can tell Sure An idealist in politics Exactly Hes popular in Morocco and not

French police ll never forget his look when they arrested him His look You were upstairs at Lipp Ben Barka couldnt see you knew those eyes well They dimmed when he was arrested Rubbish Georges Youre

Resistance hes a German spy Or the opposite Well see Its the perfect part for you Youre my favourite actress ll start work on it tomorrow Its true this time called his mother the day after he died She didnt believe it was suicide dont either Figon Ben Barka Ben Barka the militant Figon the rogue Two lives brought into contact by trivial circumstances The production of a political film for one an iniquitous way of getting rich for the other They shared nothing except their death Both died victims of the same secret networks If you please Your Honour Yes knew Georges Figon saw his gun He showed me before coming here Georges Figon committed suicide He preferred death to jail Whether it was the gun you saw or another doesnt matter It certainly does matter He loved to cause trouble for the law and society You knew him The gun he showed you was his final contribution to that cause Forget Figon mademoiselle like the rest of us will Forget him doubt it doubt youll be able to forget Georges Figon You cant hide anything anymore He gave it all away All the details and names Youre trapped And the truth will come to light in spite of you all the truth will come to light Good girl What happened on the French side What happened here had nothing coarse or base about it It was an operation that consisted in taking Ben Barka to meet Oufkir and his assistants in a place suited to settling matters between them But nothing absolutely nothing indicates that counterintelligence and the police in any capacity whatsoever were involved in the operation or condoned it On the contrary Too many newspapers have soiled the honour of the ship the ship was sinking as the captain covered his men An allout stampede In heavens name no one wanted that But who gave the order to eliminate this poor man Who were our employers and why did they hate him understand Yes No but But Listen need more time yes See you soon Chtouki called him an eel the hell he was this Ben Barka was a huge catch His reputation and antiAmerican stance were a source of concern for the agents of the the that trained Moroccan intelligence thus getting a hold on Africa What was in that case at his feet What future secrets did it contain Plans and operations around the world names of leaders places where guns could be found should have seen who the man d met was But was too excited about how d blow the money with AnneMarie Boucheseiche and his lads Chtouki had been dreaming too He thought he could bump the man o Ff when we met He had had to face it In Cairo Ben Barka was too well protected What happened The operation was impossible His bodyguards and Egyptian agents were protecting him How could you expect the Egyptians to scale down surveillance at a time when Castros men are in Cairo to meet Ben Barka Dont say you didnt know told your superiors myself Its true sir You did warn us But thats not the main problem The main problem Do need to remind you whats happening in Cuba in January We dont have much time the next attempt would work Chtouki realised it that night and his friends worries would soon be over For the first time he has taken our bait Dont you understand This film idea is going to work May heaven hear you Youre heaven sir Look These cloudless heavens around the world thats you Abdelkader its me Mehdi Yes m in Paris at Jos Who Joseph Ohana from Meknes Youre in Paris

Rabat you did algebra problems faster than anyone So Youve heard the rumour They say youre going back To school in Rabat To Rabat but in the government Thats true Were discussing it ve had offers Systematic opposition is absurd in politics There are some obstacles in the way and Oufkir is still there but m hopeful m awaiting a sign Saint Germain des Prs please Shall we go Youre coming too Yes My appointment is later There he is in the grey coat Could see your papers sir inspector Louis Souchon Mr Ben Barka What is the reason for your visit to Paris m here to meet a film producer Theres a

wasnt planned Theres land next door Wheres Lopez Whats he talking about Its wild up there An hour already God knows what theyre yelling about Oufkir General Where is he Upstairs It was a mistake to let the young man go know but dont expect miracles with French cops In any case weve done what we were hired to do We feel that weve earned our pay Dont worry General well do the usual thing You were wrong to leave Azzemouri free It would be even worse if you didnt keep quiet Any mistake of that kind would be fatal Wow a real killer Youre crazy talking to him like that What up sis Toothache ll smash your teeth jerk Want to show me how Cut it out Take him away Hes going to faint Whats up Jojo m That Ben Barkas a tough one You wouldnt think so Hes not easy to get under control Good job have my right hook Are they slaughtering him What are they after He had a head like a pumpkin real massacre Maybe ll go up to Paris with Georges Bring back some plonk Whats up Arent you coming want to puke Not in the car please Drive The fresh air will help The backward leaning that looks like a capital shows incredible aggression The crossbar of the floats above the letter without touching it This person displays a lot of selfdelusion The signature is out of all proportion and shows a certain aptitude for falsehood the law Dogsbodies in court while the guilty roam free the authorities couldnt hush it up so they staged it with the necessary solemnity And the necessary caution An Interior Ministry envoy was there to step in if need be This isnt the one Its not the gun he showed me He was murdered He was murdered Guard take the witness out He was murdered Georges Figon was murdered Georges Figon was murdered the red robes the eloquent gestures the raised voices Marguerite glowering at the judges Did Figon have a job that you knew of Did he work Its hard for an exconvict to find work Your Honour Madame will you please just answer the question He worked yes lot This proves it Didnt you suspect that Figon would turn to crime again one day d never say such a thing And Franju got yelled at for not listening This court has no time for generalities Return to your seat please Oufkir trained by French officers cannot see France and Morocco as two separate countries You referred to Lumumba but Lyautey inspires me Former Algerian lawyers up against the defence The same debate the same men Its another stage in decolonisation Figon was right when he said that his film had a future His shadow fell over the court earlier And the judges were scared the Affair was hushed up the illusions of the s faded the man whom many thought would change the rules was eliminated the trial has been held but the case isnt closed It has become a mystery one of those tales told to good people to scare them But mysteries get revenge Its in their nature to keep resurfacing rhami Azzemouri the student who was with Ben Barka a lecturer at Vincennes University was found hanging from a cycle chain in his Latin Quarter room in General Mohammed Oufkir still a minister for King Hassan was shot after trying to assassinate the monarch in the regular guys were on borrowed time Imprisoned after Oufkirs death they didnt last long without him Dlimi didnt make old bones either He was found in the early s blown to bits when his car exploded near Marrakesh Ben Barkas body has never been found this crime without a corpse this huge lie that took part in is the worlds bestkept state secret the French government took nearly years to declassify the case When the files were opened all they held was dust This film tells a true story of reallife characters The story was built up from the records of the trials press articles and reports and accounts of witnesses to Ben Barkas kidnapping in Paris on October
