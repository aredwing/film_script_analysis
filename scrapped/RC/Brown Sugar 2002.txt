Afrika Islam show It was just like our way of expression Hiphop spoke directly to me because you know it was speaking from the language that the people was dealing with was speaking and loved it as soon as As soon as got introduced to it was gonna be dealing with hiphop whether wanted to or not Like a forced marriage it was predetermined And heard Eric Is President and then that kind of changed

What What are you talkin about Guess what demo heard for our unsigned underground review today Are you serious Dre dont act like you didnt plan this You know the editor does the unsigned reviews Why would need to plan could have just given it to you at any time was hoping it got the cause the shits tight not cause know you Well m not doing the review gave it to Gabe Whyd you give it to Gabe gave you money to help start the label Doesnt the conflict of interest seem obvious All right Well what did Gabe say It wasnt a bad review He dissed us He didnt diss it He just wasnt feelin it Sid you gotta step in You gotta do your thing Youre editor mean you heard the cant do that Dre cant step on his review Youre the main person thats talkin about hiphop losin its way how we gotta get back to its roots Whats wrong with getting in touch with why we both fell in love with hiphop in the first place Cause its about forward movement Innovate and move on One minute you talkin about you want things to change and the next minute you talking about you want things to stay the same do want things to change just dont like how things have changed And And didnt know this is how it would turn out And thats why we need to look back ok Cause if we look back it will make us see things The mistakes weve made things that we never knew were there before And if we just can stop then maybe we can find that thing that we both know is missing and build on that Are we are we still talking about hiphop Thats all weve ever talked about Its all weve ever known from when we were Sid just do me a favor Before you do something you might regret just just listen again Just listen again And just follow your heart And whatever you decide whatever you decide is cool Whatever you decide is cool Dre Dre ve

on know that you and Sidney have something very special that you share also know theres a reason you made me your wife And and m hoping that whatever that reason is its enough to make you want to keep me as your wife Oh Reesey do love you But think we both know that this cant work dont know if we have enough of what it takes to to make this last dont know if we ever had enough We cant stay married Another round Damn Well at least stay a while and have a few drinks and have a few laughs hope you realize this means that have to take half of everything you have Let me make it easy on you Heres my
