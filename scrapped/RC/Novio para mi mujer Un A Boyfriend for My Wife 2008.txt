Cuervo Flores Youre seeing him and l asked him to do something What did you ask him Things were not going well l thought by going to him it would help things between us What for What did you ask him l couldnt it was impossible for me to talk to you l l didnt knowwhere to start l was What did you ask him Tell me Things were bad between us and we needed a change didnt we Well yes l guess so Yes We needed a change So l made a big mistake and asked him to take you out a couple of times so l could make a decision l hadnt been able to and which You asked Cuervo Flores to seduce me ls that it No ls that what you did Answer me because if you did youre a fucking bastard l didnt Youre lying No lm not lying l Did you yes or no No You bastard No no You fucking bastard You asked him to No no The only thing l asked him Youre a bastard and a wanker No l couldnt decide what to do and l thought that if he took you out a fewtimes it would make you reflect and together wed be able to sort things out between us Thats it You bloody idiot And actually l didnt do too badly You didnt do too badly Just think you were moping round here hours a day You bloody idiot cursing me all day long from the time you got up till you went to bed And thanks to me you actually started to work yes or no You bloody idiot Yes or no No no no Thanks to the fact that l began to enjoy working at the radio a guy whos always chatting me up a guy whos always chatting me up but whenever he wants to kiss me l turn away because like an idiot l think l could end up hurting you What guy Damian does it matter Here take this lts worked out really well Youre on your own Weve just split Damian Enjoy it Tana Tana come back Tana tell me about it Tana Morning Tana How are you To tell you the truth l feel pretty shitty with a strong urge to kill someone Who would you like to kill today All the cowards or chickenshits who have no character and who basically behave like bastards So ld like to dedicate todays column to all those people who are able to spend years living with someone they dont love but dont have the courage to admit it Those who cant be sincere with another person to all those people who can cook up pathetic childish plans So if that description fits you please keep away from Tana Ferro l met a guy who was so uptight and such a wanker listen to what he did its unbelievable but its a true story He hired a guy to seduce his wife and get her to leave him to avoid acting like a man lts amazing but men like that exist Well thats all for today So there we had Tana Ferro and her special Mornings are not for me Thanks Tana And thanks to the hotel Tentaciones a hotel where couples can really get to know each other Well be back Tana So you were already separated No Yes And youre with lm not with anybody lm alone Thats all in the past No it isnt And since were both here we should both tell the truth Right Of course We should be frank right Of course So l need you to tell me if you slept with that guy Kepelsky or not Yes l slept with him Tell the truth l slept with him lt was after we split of course Tell the truth no tell the truth Hes like this all the time lf we go on like this Hes like this all the time lf we go on like this lm not going to talk anymore lf you refuse to tell the truth it makes things very hard This is a joke Blanca Well of course its a joke What l will say and thats why l came is that in the last years lve felt very lonely lm not talking about a day a week or a month but years Because when the person you choose to spend your life with to have a family with to keep you company starts making things difficult its not very pleasant for anyone at least not for me And when l tried to change things l fantasised about us becoming parents l wouldve like to hear that but you never said it Did l never tell you You never said so No just a moment Thats not true no No just a moment Thats not true no Tell the truth Dont lie Whats the doctor going to say So we never spoke Never Fine Even so you had no right to give up and spend all day indoors Tana lt was too much wasnt it Alright l acted badly but what l did turned out pretty well for you but what l did turned out pretty well for you You got going again You see Blanca Well look at her Look at yourself Youre more beautiful you feel better So what l did to a certain extent didnt go too badly You never knew the talent you had to do things And when you began to change l fell in love with you all over again l began to feel what l had felt at the very beginning when we started going out together and l wanted to stop everything Tana but couldnt lt could happen to anyone Thats why l say lf you still love me lm here l want you to come backto me l want you at my side again How does that sound to you Tana l dont know The thing is that l dont know l had no problem with him honestly l mean l was in a bad way obviously And l just dont know l still loved you but other things that dont include you have happened to me l always thought that at l would be settled professionally at ease with myself but perhaps its onlyjust happening lm sorry l know you wouldve liked it to happen earlier Well its late l dont know But lm not that old something But maybe its only now l can start thinking or could have started thinking about having kids although l havent the slightest idea about how to work a microwave let alone look after a kid but l couldve started thinking Uh perhaps l see things differently to him l dont think people can be happy all the time least of all couples But its not very brave to run off after the first little crisis What l liked about being married to you is that l thought l was the one in everything even with my screwed up personality with the swearing the cellulitis with all that is bad in me Or l thought you did Or l thought you did But well l was wrong And now you talk about sex ld never thought that it was that important lts only now l see how important it is Love for me was being able to l feel ashamed to say this but sitting on the sofa reading the Sunday paper l thought that was part of being in love Or taking you a tea when you were ill in bed Me too l imagine you must have formed some ideas about yourself too right Your fears l dont know Why the surprise What fears Why that shocked expression l dont get it lm not shocked But l never ever criticised you Fear of everything of losing your business of your dad of me because you did all this for a reason Fear of fear because youre a coward Fear paralyses you and makes you do those dumb things you do l dont know if you sawwhat he does with his tongue Blanca that drives me crazy l cant say any more because lm very angry lt helps me to speak to understand what our problems are lt helps me to speak to understand what our problems are or were although we cant do anything about it now lt helps me Well ln that case youll have to try to retain the good times you did have that you surely did have and separate on the best terms Excuse me Yes l ltd be important for me to have another session what do you say Why not take a few days to think it over before you ring me No l dont know How much do l owe you How much How much Have you got Yes l do wait Have you got anything What dont you have it Yes but l dont know if its enough How much have you got lve got here lve got Let me have that Hey hang on Tenso Hello Hello What do you want l wanted to know how you were l received the summons You knew it was coming Yes l knew l thought you were going to warn me Yes l warned you l imagined you were going
