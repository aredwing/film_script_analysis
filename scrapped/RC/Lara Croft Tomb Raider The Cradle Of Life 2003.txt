trade is already here And you make us wait But you know cant resist to be defied Lara tell us whats all this fuss about it What does everyone think is down there dont know what everybody thinks is down there but think its the Luna Temp The Luna Temp My sons if it is not on television forget it Its a temple built by Alexander the Great who was Greek in case you dont know Yeah yeah Alexander collected treasures from all over the world He stored them in two places The majority went to his library in Egypt But his most priced possessions went here the Luna Temple By law no one was allowed to record its location And in it was swallowed by the sea destroyed during a volcanic eruption lost forever until yesterday Even half the temple is intact it would still be the greatest find since the pyramids The others heading to this area here along the shore Thats based on the currents Yes Oh This is it goes its why was late Oh Its geological Take him two hours after the quake The epic enter was here five miles northeast of us But look at the current along the shore now Wait theyve shifted So while theyre all diving there the wind will actually be Here Lets go Something wrong First Alexander doesnt report the temples location Then God washed it from the earth with a volcano Now even the currents changed Lara maybe this temple is not meant to be found Everything lost is meant to be found Dont worry Incredible Its unbelievable God Its huge Wonderful Jimmy this is wonderful Do you see what see Oh my god Oh my god Its incredible Nicky look at these Were going to be rich Hey Lara

Were going to go were going to go now Come on Theyre coming up Lara Lara its us Hillary and Bryce Shes disorientated thats normal after three days Nice day for a dip Gentlemen there is an expression Its not nice to fool Mother Nature Yet that is precisely what ve been doing for some time now Whether it will be sorren gas for Mr Zap improved typhoid for Mr Croft to use in the Balkans enhanced cholera for Mr Devalia But while these weapons served their purpose there have always been limitations Stable diseases arent lethal deadly ones burn out too quickly Mother Nature can only be fooled so much Deploy my weapon and your enemies however great will collapse rather Mr Monza is collapsing right now What the hell is going on Monza told about this meeting Thats why the change of location He was going to turn me over to them and then seek asylum in the West smart man would have known was onto him would never have got on the plane but knew you would Mr Monze because you actually thought you could fool me That gentlemen is the sound of a traitor dying That was an accelerated form of Ebola the deadliest disease known to man highly contagious However as with all known diseases there exist stockpiles of anti serums in the West There is no antiserum for what m offering you no treatment no vaccine no cure The modern world has never seen anything like what ve uncovered Uncovered Yes branched that Archaeology landesbank in Bern million dollars each if you please Hong Kong Chai Wan Private Airport Wheres Chen Lo Hes got the orb but is onto him How He doesnt he know but rather than risk bringing it to you hes waiting have just told a cabin full of men about Pandora the clock cannot be reset Tell Chen Lo to bring the orb to me at once Find the killers dont take it on to me Bryce what have we got havent even finished loading the images from your camera yet Weve got references to an orb took the liberty of checking Historic inventories of the Luna Temple do not list any orb want you both to list every orb ever mentioned in Greek history Ah Thats liableto be thousands Then well read thousands Start with that one Perhaps you gentlemen would like some tea while youre waiting No they wouldnt Tea is for guests The door is for intruders Lara these men are from Yes can tell from their soft hands and pressed suits that these are the men who made decisions and leave the dirty work for others have no interest in His name is Chen Lo along with his brother Xien he runs a gang of Chinese bandits known as Shay Ling They deal in gun diamonds and antiquities anything that Chen Lo can sell them in the black market Theyve followed you the moment you arrived at Santralina where they killed your friend Gus and sank his boat Why For this After you were picked up in sea our listening post in Mota intercepted that fax it was sent from Chen Lo to a man named Jonathan Reiss What a scientist won a Nobel Prize He is now the foremost designer of biological weapons in the world His creation has been in the heart of every active bioterror in the past years Reisss disdain for life is legendary He has no political agenda He doesnt care who his weapons kill or why modernday Dr Mengelen We know Chen Lo followed you in order to obtain the orb we also know hell deliver it to Reiss What we dont know is why Candidly that terrifies us Pandoras box Reiss is going to use the orb to find Pandoras Box Do you mean the Greek myth Pandora was given a box by God told not to open it she does and unleashes pain into the world Thats the Sunday school version yes How do you think life began Shooting stars primordial ooze In an Egyptian Pharaoh found a place he named the Cradle of Life where we life began and there he found a box the box which brought life to earth The Pharaoh opened the box but all that was left inside was Ramante or empty life the plague which came as the companion to life Companion Nature is about balance All the world comes and passes yin and yang right and wrong men and women whats a pleasure with pain What did this plague do It leveled the Pharaohs army The Pharaohss son dispatched the finest soldiers to take the box and transport it to the end of the world the Great reached India where his army was ravaged by a plague After one of his men found a box among some of the men India thats what the Pharaohs men wrote it Alexander felt that the box was too powerful to be trusted to any man so he returned it to its home the Cradle of Life And it has not been seen since And this Cradle of Life is where No one knows Alexander found it using a map that was with the box a map he then hid from the world But the name he gave this map was Mati and the literal translation for the word Mati is eye it orbits the map hidden in the Luna Temple by Alexander And Reiss will use it to find Pandoras Box And when he does he opens it The markings definitely form a pattern but even if figure out what they represent we still cant read the whole map because were going to get past the view of these see We have to figure out how to read it Right thank you On behalf of her Majesty we firmly request that you find and recover this box before Dr Reiss Oh Now that have her Majestys permission Tell me where to find the orb The last we heard it was somewhere in China with Chen Lo and Sha Ling finding them would be next to impossible well assign two of our best agents to help dont want them With due respect your expertise is archaeology doesnt didnt say that dont need help But your agents would never get me to Chen Lo in time need an insider someone who knows the Shei Ling their methods their hideouts need Terry Sheridan Not in a million year not if youre the last man on earth Terry Sheridan former commander of the Royal Marine turned a mercenary and a traitor You dont honestly expect me to put that man on a trail to hold weapons you can turn around and sell to the highest bidder Kazahkstan Barla Kala Prison Open m your host Armika Welcome to Fantasy Island Croft Hello Terry So what do you think of my new place Not quite Croft manner What a key to your heart To a flat in Zurich You can pick another city if you want Your record will be

doesnt count So what do have to do You need to take me to the Shay Ling She who Theres a man named Chen Lo who took something from me and want it back Yeah Is that you or Also ve arranged the government to wire you million in sterling when we succeed you can call it second chance man All right then insurance for you dont need any You and working alone And its easier to see through you that

spies all over China We have to get into country undetected so well slip into Beijing and we go by truck Truck wasnt thinking about something a little faster little faster Well this is a little faster

mysterious ailment ravages their bodies You kill them and ll give your orb to Lady Croft My men tell me shes a few miles away from here as we speak wonder how much she would pay ll pay you an additional million dollars It will be yours once youve delivered the orb along with Lady Crofts body dont think you know where they are Youre impossible you know that think you pretended to know so

that before Were you really going to kill me Oh bet she would have ve seen her in action Didnt Terry tell you The last time any of us saw him he was riding away with a truck full of my Ming vases and sitting next to him was his sister Oh how is she You shouldnt come here They got me out of prison Besides the lady has a good offer better than Reiss Really Should take it Take it Or better yet you

worth a lot Well then if you know that youll know Reiss will also kill you the moment you give it to him And your government would guarantee my safety No But will That must hurt saying that to me Take
