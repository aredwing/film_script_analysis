each other No Hes the one who gave me my start m grateful to him for that Thanks to that ve appeared in some quality productions Yeah was shooting my second film when he called me And he said had made a lot of money That had succeeded thanks to him He was asking me for money Its tough being an actress He was preying on your pity How much did he want He talked about a loan but wanted me to give it to him Thats what he wanted hesitated for a few days He called me back we saw each other He apologized in tears He was really crying He said he had been drinking All the same never felt like seeing him again see have to tell you That film tells my story had told it to him as a secret cant forgive him for having made it public was shocked it was your story What part All of it All of it Going to a hotel to die Sharing out the pills one by one told him everything Even the snow before the suicide the Marlboro reds that couldnt find All that like the bit with the Marlboros You told him all that Not exactly but back then he saw me smoking them all the time Really When youre part of a filmmakers entourage you tend to think like that As soon as you spot a coincidence you think Its because of you We all think the world revolves around us But does all that really matter now Does it matter Tongsu was just telling you all that What are we going to do Weve had too much to drink Do you really bear a grudge against Yi He was a big influence on me He did everything d have liked to do was jealous He was excessively proud although he had no reason to be m as good as him He acted like my mentor and wanted me to recognize him as such No way didnt like that Dont get angry Dont hate him Hes dying So are we Youre exaggerating dont like that All right m too fond of drinking Life Is too tough Its too Sorry love you Do you mean it Youre talking rubbish Youre forgetting your change Yes Goodbye Thank you That was delicious Thank you Youre welcome Wrap up warmly m drunk Be careful Are you okay
