great chasm on the way that swallows the unwary If that doesnt get you he says the towering crags will And in the Borgo pass the light suddenly divides and the land begins to rise towards the heavens and then it drops No one has ever returned from that place The gypsies say that no such castle exists there except maybe in the imagination of man There used to be a castle there But now it is a ghost castle Its only a ruin And whoever enters into that land of phantoms is lost and never returns Of vampires and bloodsuckers Of corpses which devour their own flesh Of incubuses and succubuses Of the living dead who follow strangers in the night and attack them Hmm Transylvania Nosferatu beyond death a curse that will last till the end of time The curse of Nosferatu Coachman could you take me to

from here but shall write a diary preserving all my thoughts and feelings for you Last night after a tiresome journey finally reached my destination the castle of Count Dracula had a bad dream but hope it will pass This castle is so strange At times wonder if it isnt part of that dream Everything about it looks so unreal dont attach importance to the sunshine anymore or to glittering fountains which youth is so fond of love the darkness and the shadows Where can be alone with my thoughts am the descendent of an old family Time is an abyss profound as a thousand nights Centuries come and go to be unable to grow old is terrible That is not the worst There are things more horrible than that Can you imagine enduring centuries experiencing the same futility each day m glad you found such a large old house for me Very near your lodging understand Yes its just around the corner Ah may have a look at the contract What What a lovely throat Its my wife Lucy Your hand Your hand is so cold The document the contract for the house must sign it immediately Yes but we havent settled on a price It doesnt matter between gentlemen accept whatever you find just How long did it take you to get here

morning well all wake up and find ourselves in straightjackets Excuse me for not knocking am Count Dracula know who you are read Jonathans diary He wrote everything that went on in your castle while he was there Dont worry he wont die Yes he will Death surrounds us Were all at his will The rivers continue to flow without us Time flies by Even the stars they wander towards us in a very strange way Only death is certain Only death is cruel Death is cruelty against the unsuspecting But thats not what perceive as cruel Cruel is when you cant die even if you want to Give me some of your love which you give Jonathan never will wont even give that love to God If Jonathan cant have my love then no one else will If wish hell recognize you again But first come and give me your love Only then will give you your husband back And as for me the absence of love is the most abject pain The power of my love will bring him back to me And you may be assured even the unthinkable will not deter me that you want to lay for me Good night Stop Help Help Nosferatu the undead He drinks the blood of his victims and turns them into phantoms of the night Like a shadow he has no reflection He goes through walls and closed doors as if they never existed Like a bat he wafts into dark bedrooms Masquerading as a black wolf he hunts his fleeing victims Abandon all hope you who cross his path Yet even vampires who are considered unnatural creatures are subject to some laws of nature The sight of the cross bans him The consecrated host can bar his retreat And if a pure hearted woman diverts his attention from the cry of the cock the first light of day will obliterate him What is your wish Master Go north to Riga The army of rats and the Black Death will follow you Oh Thy will be done Amen Amen The plague The plague What are you doing here must talk to the town council Its been dissolved It doesnt exist anymore Then must see the mayor Hes dead Go back home as fast as you can know why

seen what has happened to him Its getting worse here every day The plague The rats And this book about the vampires This book explains it This is an enlightened century Science has refuted the superstitions youre talking about know it exists believe what see with my own eyes Faith Faith Yes faith Yes faith Dr Van Helsing Faith Faith is the faculty in men which enables us to believe things we know to be untrue You must come and help me destroy this monster We must look for him Coffins have come by boat from the Black Sea We can search for them tonight and destroy them My child you need some rest Your husbands condition has worn you out No Dr Van Helsing Tonight need to study this matter scientifically No Tonight Theres no time to lose Even a farmer knows that theres a time to plant
