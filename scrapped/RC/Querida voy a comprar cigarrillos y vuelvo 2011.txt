Morocco Mogador Hundreds of years ago Look at the goats who have climbed on the trees The Director went mad and got them up there with a winch No This is for real in Morocco these animals climb on trees to eat fruits There reality and fantasy arent separated Anything impossible might happen in Morocco Also in Buenos Aires Take a look at that guy over there in the red djeilaba Anybody travels from Morocco to Spain and from Spain to Morocco buying and selling Do you like bread Soon youll eat something tastier and juicer As a cannibal from New Guinea might say You dont know anything when it comes to the best meat To eat a simple crude cow one might just become a vegetarian Our guy leaves the village ignorant to the fact that something is about to yank him from his daily routine forever Honestly hell still follow routines but in a very different way Sailors call it the dead calm They get nervous when the sea is too quiet Honestly one should seek refuge in a basement wait till it passes Just in case The chances to get struck by lightning are oneinamillion Unfortunately lightnings dont know crap about statistics According to Gauss who was a wise man lightning never strikes the same place twice But as previously hinted destiny doesnt care about Gauss and his certainties The first lightning killed him thats right But surprise The second lightning revived him Naturally after a miracle of this magnitude you dont remain the same person The man knows that hes different now and as time passes he confirms that He doesnt grow old and he has powers worthy of a small god or if you prefer worthy of a small demon The fact is that our guy is now immortal He can travel through time and make a lot of small miracles which dont add a single thing to the universe Nothing good at least immortality makes him oblivious to transcendent matters With his powers he could have been a king or an emperor Yet hell prefer to stay anonymous This way he can move freely and do anything he wants To have fun m Alberto Laiseca This movie is based on a story wrote Darling m going out for cigarettes and ll be right back The story which well show is supposed to be a work of fiction But it isnt

better as if you were a golden chicken ready to be served ve never been young except now and m almost Its very common in our eclipse times for youngsters to be very old Because its the death of imagination The idea of going to the big city to triumph and fuck Isnt that bad when you think of it Of course you can also fuck in your town ve done it Of course you need an ontological point of view for that You need a reason to live What Ernestito never understood is that a city is big only if one is big And a city is full of shit if one is made of shit Ernesto fine lad that he is with the intentions of fucking And also advance thanks to certain girls who at the moment werent known Even they didnt know their destiny Pata Villanueva Cristina Fernndez Yes the president Valeria Lynch Naturally no one cared about him First and fore most because girls arent stupid Thats the first thing But besides that because Ernestito Is simply just Ernestito If he learnt something its that money

ahead If mumble a song can you write its notes Its not that hard ll mumble it And you write it down the musical notes Like a good dull person Ernesto looks for an assistant who is times more stupid than he is This way he wont get over shadowed would have preferred for the hippie character to be handicap to be on a wheel chair Wouldnt it have been better Right since m nobody Bah The next day he went with the hippie to a cheap recording studio From there to the record company with the tape under his arm Did you write it yourself ve got it registered Here are the papers See for yourself world with no religion One of those things that come out Not sure from where but it did Actually m a catholic was baptized But the song talks about a world with no heaven or hell m a catholic but not a practicing one How did you name the song Imagine Imagina in Spanish Youve hit the bullseye Lennon must have woken up with a backache that day Did you write the music yourself Because some guy in Argentina the worlds ass Yes stole his song one year before hed have written it Ok Lad Youve got a producer Imagine Ernesto had some gigs and as incredible as it may seem things go pretty well for him The song is so good that tresists even Ernestito Ernesto The girls are here Youre Ernesto Zambrana no cant understand how no one invented a telephone with no cables yet Imagine that itll be the size

Like in the movie Alien Youre fucked up old men Ernesto Instead of having fun with the girl you got married Ernesto plagiarized Imagine from what little he could remember and understand because he never liked The Beatles He always hated them He wrote a piece of crap that went like this Imagine a world where everyone has love house money and cars with no drugs or religion Imagine all people living in peace They say m crazy but m telling the truth hope that youll join us to make an ideal world Disgusting man We just heard Imagine performed by its author Ernesto Zambrana who is still here with us Ernesto understand that next weekend youll perform in Asuncion in Paraguay Yes The single came out in Chile and Paraguay In some other countries as well Mexico Jim Morrison Eric Clapton Frank Zappa Bob Dylan Zambrana The vanity of plagiarism knows no limits Carla from Palermo says just heard the song on the radio and it really got me excited It made me think how absurd war is It has a beautiful message ll buy the single today Thank you Carla Anibal from Villa Urquiza saw Zambrano in a bar last week singing Imagine The song is good but the other three songs he performed were horrible Besides the guy has no swing and he has a salami head Lets see Some people are so prejudiced no Yes Why must artists be like stereotypes Isnt that too authoritarian Why someone with talent who writes a beautiful song such as Imagine cant be ugly fat with no swing or without charisma ll leave you with that thought so you can think about it Bye well talk tomorrow Thank you Ernesto ve got a woman on the line Norma from Olavarra she claims shes your mother Do you want to talk to her No No shes a crazy fan who is stalking me Paulita What Are you with me only because m famous or are you

you plagiarized him because of its style its subject the harmony Bla bla bla bla They say that they dont know how but clearly youve stolen information from him But registered it he didnt know Still youll need to prove in court that youre capable of writing such a song And the law firm that represents Lennon here is tough Thats grave huge problem So what do we do now Thats your business baby m abandoning ship m suffering the punishment that this fucked up society forces on people like us who have no talent Leave us alone you sons of bitches Lennon himself had said it The dream is over What can say The dream is over what can say Who is it Mail correspondence from the courthouse Having analyzed the lawsuit as well as the defense allegations this court of law finds Ernesto Zambrana guilty of committing plagiarism of Sr John Winston Lennon and condemns him to pay a compensation fee of Justice Justice They are convicting an innocent man You Corrupt judges This is the part where Ernesto

eternity of pain No one can imagine that But why me Why not Come on Drink a little mate What are you stirring it for dumbass How many people were saved thanks to mate More than one man didnt kill

cigarettes and ll be right back is in fact thats the same old story but told in a different way He also never came back Its like a dead pig walking all rotten Ernestito could say Even my mediocrity was robbed from me dont even care about money anymore As time passes m more and more convinced that having a birthday is a sure sign that a person is a villain d referto a mans different ages as concentration camps Every year that passes is one additional layer of electrified barbedwire Thirty is Auschwitz mean it Turn right in meters Turn right in meters Park on the right lane Tomorrow at oclock couldnt understand a thing of what he said salad an apple and nothing else which means reaching the ontological meaning of the object Using criticism to discover the limits of metaphysics Are you still with me No youre not ll explain it to you as if you were in the kindergarten maybe that way youll get it Take anything from a slice of pizza to a poodle But dont look at it as a pet or as food Instead look at it as something that simply is Its essence its transcendent properties This microphone do we have to say that its a microphone Wouldnt it be more correct to say that strictly speaking what we have here is a lot of molecules Excuse me may love this one Crude and cultured Extra crude Problems ll take the opportunity to dedicate my story to my everlasting heroes James Dean Elvis Presley Jim Morrison who like a lot and Barbara Feldon the from Get Smart
