are you saying Thats what the spooks call it You kill someone you make an act of contrition In this case that would be your buddy Pavel Penance and it doesnt matter whether he lives or dies The debts paid and everybody walks away with a clean conscience Thats bullshit Bullshit Thats the nature of political killing Why do you think they picked us Some kid on death row a beatup fourfingered sniper whose eyes are going and it doesnt matter if Pavel makes it or we die trying because its a great story for and theyll play it over and over hours a day In the end theyll forgive and forget there was some bad fucker named Valstoria that took a bullet in the chest in the name of freedom Hey m not pissed off at you son m mad at myself should have seen this coming guess its age Well how about that
