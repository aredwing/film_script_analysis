But its like ve heard this story somewhere What You didnt know It really happened Some lunatic university professor killed his family in a hotel then killed a bunch of staff and other guests and then finally himself was a kid when it happened It was the year of the Osaka Expo Year of the Showa Era Wait Before you were born Yes Memory Night Thanks a lot Good night m home Tada Who is it Good morning Some of you have probably realized this film is based on a true story of murders in a certain hotel For the details please read the material were posting over there Now well hear from the director m Matsumura the director Hello In this incident at the hands of just one man The script is based upon this incident but in the film he will never appear The murderer will simply be someone in the dark This is to say the focus will be on the victims not the murderer This should be an ensemble performance of these actual people Portraying their attachment to life and fear of dying in the face of sudden and bitter death would like to lay their vengeful souls to rest Thats all from me Now well announce the casting of these people Step forward when your name is called Naomi Nakata Yes d like you to play one of the victims the hotel maid Yes Tetta Shinohara Yes Youll be the hotels frontdesk clerk Yes Yukihiko Yamaguchi Yes You play the husband from a couple who happened to be staying there ll do my best Yoko Shinjo The role of the wife from the couple please Nagisa Sugiura Ms Sugiura Uh yes d like you to play the role that corresponds to this girl The girl only six at the time fled with her yearold brother around the hotel then died at her own fathers hands ve changed her age for the film but this is a vital role as she was the last one to die All right Sugiura Yes Next Junko Suzuki Eleven Die In Hotel Murder Eleven People Dead And Cold Miyata Is this here Yes Look at this Now this is a model of the set that will be built here in the studio Its based on photographs of the hotel and other materials we have This is the outside and this is the inside Take a good look Wow With this set we intend to recreate the hotel as it really was But Mr Matsumura understand you want it real but we can only research so far Wake up This course was your idea And so these memories are often things youve been told or that youve read in a book somewhere They vanish into your consciousness and reappear in different form This is what usually happens in what is called the cryptomnesia phenomenon When we place these concepts under such headings as past lives or reincarnation they become very convenient for religious thinkers and moralists But you know keep having this same dream That happens This is different Dreams about me You wish In this dream always see the same hotel but ve never been there Werent you listening to the lecture Thats that crypto something Crypto No listen That red triangular roof the walls the corridors its all so real You were probably there when you were a kid and forgot No Theres no place like that in any of our old photos and my parents have no memory of it Oh come on And my mother was really surprised when told her about it She asked if still had that
