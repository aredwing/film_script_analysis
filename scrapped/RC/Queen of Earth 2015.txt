Please dont talk to me like that Like what Like youre superior to me or to any of us Why not Um because its dull And its uninteresting Well we all cant live in a magical fantasy land Uh think if you

that can really answer that Youre always very sweet to me Well you ask so little of me Uh Sure you dont want to come in should get back All right well doors always open Just leave them dont wanna leave them Why Because no one else is gonna clean this up but me Will you leave me alone It was autumn October and we would just take long walks and get takeout and watch videos at my apartment had that basement apartment at the time so once you were inside no light could get in So you could just never even see when the sun came up loved that apartment But then after a few six weeks him and his girlfriend started to get back together and he just shut me out We had class together so we were polite but you know it was really shitty It really broke my heart cause it felt like he didnt choose me you know Um so then a couple years go by maybe longer maybe it was more like two and a half and All of a sudden out of the blue get this letter Like an actual letter written on paper With a pen and it was so sweet and It was sort of apologetic but not overtly or in an annoying way Anyways agreed to meet him after work Late one night It was December It was like degrees out and was standing outside had that white knit cap on that used to wear all the time And he came out and he just looked exactly the same and He said that looked the same too but that cant be true because had really short blond hair at the time And um We went to a bar and we had a few drinks and he told me about how Of course his relationship inevitably ended as it was meant to and And he just couldnt stop thinking about me and Before even knew it was forgiving him For two years of resentment For not choosing me was forgiving him And his apartment was nearby so we were walking there and asked if could use the bathroom which know sounds like a really cheap move but really did have to go and really did think was just gonna go in there and then leave and But then it was really warm inside and so cold outside and so we just like ended up talking and and then kissing and you know We just fell asleep for a while and So we were together then through the holidays and he came to my house and met his parents and it was going really well and It just felt like we were finally getting what we didnt get in the first place You know And Something that was so real and It felt so important Then a few more months passed and Um he started to get distant again and was planning weekend trips and introducing him to my friends and just trying to really integrate him into my life Then realised you know two or three days were passing where wasnt hearing from him And it hit me that he was doing it again He was just He was doing the exact same thing that he did before and And was too stupid to realise it before it was too late And knew that my problem this problem that have this issue that just keeps landing me in the same place Almost three years later here was in the exact same place Was because was more impressed with this note with this handwritten note than was with his supposed changes in personality You know saw this this effort this This textile representation of his feelings and thought it was something real when it wasnt It was just trite and clichd and fatuous But mean it was real It was this real piece of paper which m ashamed to admit carried around like three apartments after that But it wasnt real it it just was something that was completely empty And hollow And it just made me realise that m just in this selfperpetuating cycle of defeat where cant get out of it because cant get out of it because cant get out of it need some time Its one of the worst tendencies of human nature to assume the best of others You remember Chad So we were friends right Mm Whatever that means in middle school and He was my first kiss Over the years we were in the same friend group and dont think he ever knew he was my first kiss anyway We never talked about it But d say throughout high school graduation college he was like top alltime good friends And then after college for whatever reason we started seeing a lot of one another And wed hang out like a couple times a week Go to concerts have dinner And then we were just suddenly together hooking up and spending the night at his place and mine you know And it was summer It was great It was absolutely one of those summer things where All my memories of that time are intricately connected to him But he was going to grad school or law school or something So around July start telling him you know this is going where its going Its not going to grad school with him and He says he gets it but then things start to get more serious and it becomes clear to me that he hasnt been in a serious relationship in a long time So keep reminding him that were headed for a dead end and he says Yeah get it Its fine get it And believe him And then suddenly its August and before hes even gone hes already talking about me coming to visit him and a trip he has planned to come back and in October So say no Thats not gonna happen None of that is real And he thinks m joking He basically ignores it all So then hes gone and within a week or two m seeing somebody else and hes still calling all the time and one night some Saturday night m out in a bar and he calls and hes giving me the business about being out at two or three in the morning and just snapped and was screaming at him Telling him he was a delusional bastard and cant believe what m hearing and want to have nothing to do with him So thats that Its September now and dont hear from him or anything until Christmas when hes back around obviously And so were all at a bar dont know where you were during all of this Maybe you were away that year for whatever reason Anyway we see each other and Its as if nothing has ever happened Hes civil but can tell hes seething and just seeing him pisses me off so much because can see now what he is Just this delusional desperate man and goddamn that is so unattractive So my point is You can get out someone elses cycle but you cant get out of your own You were victimised by his handwritten note and was victimised by his inability to face reality And yet here we both are Where the fuck are they Who the hell are you Me Rich From last year Sorry m not good with faces or names So you mean like people Yeah them too Heard about your dad m really sorry Dont be You didnt know him Still Why are you here Well had to say hey to my girls m sure you cant be referring to me when you say that Just wanted to see what was up saw Ginnys car outside Dont call her Ginny What was that didnt hear anything Why is that guy here Who Rich Yeah Rich He likes to hang out sometimes dont know Who cares What are you up to next week havent a clue That must be nice What To choose to just hang out and do nothing didnt choose to be here Nobody would choose to be in this situation was thrust into this situation against my will Yeah know how that feels Because it cant possibly be that complicated Just tell him everything is fine left everything in order Yes told him it would be there by the end of the month just told him that there were extraordinary circumstances didnt feel the need to explain it Its a family matter Its absolutely none of their business Tell them what it is Its nobodys business Well youre gonna have to say it in the way that m saying it You have to speak to him in a certain way with a certain tone Otherwise he wont listen then the newcomer whos all freaked out she has to cut the baby out of me And then my water broke It was um You know had to see it before felt it because couldnt feel between my legs But the water was ice cold so you know sort of tried not to jolt and then it would come out and then turned to her and was like They babys coming You have to cut it out of me And had rottedout teeth Really It was real winner just wanted to finally purge all of that from my life d already cut out so many worthless and negative people who brought me nothing but annoyance or distraction so figured why should she be any different Because family is different No they arent Nobody gets a free pass Thats a horrible thing to say Its horrible to feel wish didnt feel it wish could have relationships with some people cant But once they become just cyphers or you know energy drains or or they become Someone who distracts or depresses me have to have nothing to do with them cant help it You can help it No cant ve tried just hate them and hate being around them And hate talking to them and love eliminating those enemies from every aspect of my life dont think ve ever heard an adult use the word enemy Oh dont be naive Its the only word dont know think m taking the high road do Thats just not very adult Well you made the cut love you Lets celebrate that Lucky me Yeah watch your step dont want to be an enemy made a salad for you Its good You should eat it Thank you Sorry kind of uh spread out It was our only collaboration We wanted to do something together It was a beautiful portrait It just turned into something else completely Yeah It became the image of his death So didnt want anything to do with it anymore It was a morbid image We thought it was really funny Did you like working with him Yeah he was a genius Is that a yes Well he taught me everything And know that everyone said that everything got was from nepotism but didnt really care dont care just thought he was not only my father but admired him for being a great artist Clichd tortured suicidal think Rich is coming by later
