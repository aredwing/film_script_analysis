where did you get this money An advance have a job m going to be a showgirl in the Follies The Follies showgirl It is a little silly You just put on some beads or something and walk up and down Like

little man The one saw didnt look so funny or so little Oh not that one There were two They were both funny but the funniest one pushed me through a door and there was in a room filled with flowers

myself My wife has a job Franz youre ridiculous All failures are ridiculous But darling youre not a failure No Well what is it you want me to do give up the job know its a rather foolish way to earn
