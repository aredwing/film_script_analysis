imprisoned neath the covered wooden shaft Folds the rope into its bag Blows his pipe of smoulders Blankets smoke into the room And the day will end for some As the night begins for one Staring through the message in his eyes Lies the solitary son From the mountain called Freecloud Where the eagle dare not fly And the patience in his sigh Gives no indication For the townsmen to decide So the village dreadful yawns Pronouncing gross diversion As the label for the dog Oh Its the madness in his eyes As he breaks the night to cry Its really me Really you and really me Its so hard for us to really be

death waits like a Bible truth At the funeral of my youth We ploughed for that and the passing time My death waits like a witch at night As surely as our love is right Lets not think about the passing time But whatever lies behind the door There is nothing much to do Angel or devil dont care For in front of that door There is you My death waits like a beggar blind Who sees the world through an unlit mind Throw him a dime for the passing time My death waits there between your thighs Your cool fingers will close my eyes Lets think of that and the passing time My death waits to allow my friends few good times before it ends So lets drink to that and the passing time But whatever lies behind the door There is nothing much to do Angel or devil dont care For in front of that door There is you My death waits there among the leaves In magicians mysterious sleeves Rabbits and dogs and the passing time My death waits there among the flowers Where the blackest shadow blackest shadow cowers Lets pick lilacs for the passing time My death waits there in a double bed Sails of oblivion at my head So pull up the sheets against the passing time But whatever lies behind the door There is nothing much to do Angel or devil dont care For in front of that door There is Me Me David me Thank you How long have we got Anyone in the stalls has got no chance Eh Anyone sitting in the stalls has
