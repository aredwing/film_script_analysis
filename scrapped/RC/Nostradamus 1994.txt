under enormous pressure That is what she died of But it would have been to save her had only been bled in time Excuse me Question We find the poison in which organ Monsieur de Nostredame Please enlighten your fellow students The answer you want to hear is in the kidneys Right l detect a rather displeasing undertone in your answer The most recent examinations by Dr Rabelais in Paris revealed that high concentrations of the poison were also to be found in the liver Paris Where is the poison here Do you see any poison Anyone see any poison There is no poison here Do you see any l dont see any poison You can find it in the heart as well Rubbish The medical school at the university of Montpellier is the best is because only we get cadavers we can dissect So perhaps you can tell me why Monsieur Professor you are content with knowledge contained in the old books Are you trying to tell me what l should be doing Then you agree with my diagnosis Thank you l am flattered The blood did indeed heat up as a result of the poisoning The body was trying to help itself The hot blood was supposed to fight the poison Bearing that in mind it would have been the wrong treatment to give the woman ltd merely interfere with the bodys own healing process Monsieur de Nostredame before we confer a Degree of Doctor of Medicine on you you are going to have to learn what we teach you Nothing other than bleeding would have help this woman Helped her to die faster yes Monsieur de Nostradame its up to you You may leave this class at any time But please dont come back Dont ever come back here
