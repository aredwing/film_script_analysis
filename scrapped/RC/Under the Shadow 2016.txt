Admit what What youve done Well dont know the details of my case but guess the reason cant return is because was politically active But sir everyone was politically active during the revolution was young Naive mean didnt even understand the difference between left and right was just passionate like everyone else that age was concerned about the country wanted change m sure you understand If ended up in one of those radical left groups It was only because didnt know any better Every mistake has consequences let you in so you could hear this directly from my lips and stop wasting your time by coming here every day Let me tell you this frankly You cannot continue your studies Based on your history there is not even the slightest possibility that you can ever return to the university

You were crying Pargol Go inside Dorsa is a child She imagines things when shes scared You probably think m going crazy But my father was fine yesterday after the missile hit He was talking to me swear left the room to get him a glass of water and then heard him scream ran back and saw He looked so terrified His eyes were fixed on something behind me couldnt see Something terrifying Like understand how hard it is to deal with the death of someone so close You know lost my mother six months ago But it was the shock of the missile that gave your father a heart attack Is she still the same Yeah The fever still wont break Maybe you should take her to a doctor mean like a pediatrician cant stand any more of this ebrahimi You have to close up shop and take us out of town If our tenants would only pay what they owe then could close up shop Mrs ebrahimi is right ve told fakur that we have to leave everything and go to our sons in Paris We just renewed our visas so see no

bit restless because of her fever Mehdi has been very restless too but he doesnt seem to be ill knew hed bring trouble with him Please dont say such things Mrs ebrahimi dont think you get it That thing didnt crash here by accident think it brought something with it Like what Djinn Djinn belong to fairy tales This is not a thousand and one nights Youre wrong They travel on the wind from place to place until they find someone to possess Why are you telling me this Why was dorsa outside bijaris apartment banging on the door told you shes delirious because of her high fever She was looking for someone Her favorite doll is missing She thinks it has somehow gone to the fourth floor think should go now You know if they take a personal belonging Something that you treasure Then theres no escape from them Youll be marked and theyll always know how to find you Sorry m late Mrs ebrahimi accosted me What time is your flight Early morning You must be excited to see your son The missile attacks have actually been a good excuse He has missed us lots too Even wanted to come back had to remind him that theyd have him conscripted and sent conscripted the front line as soon as he landed What are you looking for remember you had this book the people of the air by saedi Yes we have Second shelf The contemporaries Do you know what its about Djinn Its about superstitious belief in djinn down south And how they travel on the wind Its an anthropological book not a book to find answers in What answers m just saying people can convince themselves anythings real if they want to The winds refer to mysterious ethereal and magical forces which can be anywhere Where there is fear and anxiety the winds blow m glad got hold of you thought youd have left the city like everyone else sent the family away ll join them during the weekend Have you heard from anyone recently Not really ve been to the university a few times and seen a few old faces Can you believe there are still people from
