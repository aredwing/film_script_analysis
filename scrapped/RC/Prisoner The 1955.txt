your mind we want For the first time since ve come into your prison lm afraid We cant talk here You didnt answer my letter Its hopeless We cant go on seeing each other like that love you but you cant do this to a man Why do we always quarrel Yes he got results in the past but his methods take too much time Yes and the people are getting restless Churches are full again Theyre falling back on their old ideas outside the regime Hes got to be discredited and soon We shall be late for the meeting warned the Ministry of Justice God they know hes not guilty of anything Well you know he isnt Well thats not for me to say My husband was right Theres no freedom here even to think So he got out and you heard the last of him You love me or you wouldnt have come here shouldnt have come tried not to

use from these recordings Just a word here and there at the moment sir Confession the truth Well that wont take us very far The general is asking for results Its bound to be a slow process sir Hes looking for a weak spot in his defences Hell find it If the church isnt deliberately obstructing the state are you prepared to say it supports it It renders to the state the things that are the states and to God the things that are Gods You know youll tire yourself out with this eternal being on your guard On my guard Stop thinking of me as the inquisitor How do you wish me to think of you As your doctor To me youre on a couch in my consulting room Youre an enemy of society like the schizophrenic or the paranoiac Youre dangerous because you mislead the poor the uneducated and the silly But only because youre wrongheaded In time well get to the root of the trouble and you can be cured You believe it Yes do believe it God give me cunning against your skill God keep my watch Medical examination Good morning And no talking to the doctor The pulse fairly regular little flutter theres nothing to be alarmed about Its caused by the natural human impulse of fear You often find it among cases under threat of torture physical or mental and of course death Lungs quite all right Nothing to worry about there Continuous confinement is not usually recommended of course The hearts very sound Yes very sound indeed hope Youre not supposed to talk to the doctor But know him He used to work in the free orthopaedic clinic You were doing fine work there doctor know Things happen to us Doctor Tell me have you examined the interrogator Because if m in for a long session so is he Come in Good morning general Good morning Well Well was in an interrogation when you sent for me At in the morning It started at am Resistance is at its lowest about that time Resistance would appear to be still pretty high Youve had him for nearly three months without any result m not criticizing your methods Theyve been successful in the past But must know how long theyre going to take But ve told you general its impossible to say In this case were dealing with a particularly brilliant and subtle mind His spirit was proved indestructible by the Gestapo in the war Your progress reports tell me nothing m prepared to report that am wasting hours days weeks finding out what we cant use against him But m probing his mind for the one weakness that we can use To find that out ve got to become his doctor his confessor ve had to get to know him better than know myself One casual phrase one tiny slip may give us a clue Very well But remember this We took a very grave risk in arresting him Theres unrest throughout the country over it The press keeps asking why theres no trial We cannot afford to fail with the cardinal shant fail general Youve had a hard life hard life the aristocrat to the priest Before dawn in the fish market at the age of But warm in school by with the fat fruits of my scholarship Did your clothes smell of fish Heavens that it should rile me still Cod guts and mackerel blood look There are squashed fish eyes sticking to his boots Dear little boys used to go to the fish market with just my overalls on over my skin Even when the snow was up to our ankles And bought every brand of soap saw advertised took the skin off my hands with disinfectant And then Sir must sit next to him He stinks of fish Happy school days Blast you you flaming little pest General School days after weeks wasted Youve no fixed date for the trial This is a difficult case can see that The time has come for other methods General thats the stuff that martyrs are made of The only chink well find in that armour is in the mind shant give you much longer to try Supposing you could break him would a confession from a broken body do you much good in an open court Weve got to have a confession if it has to be from a corpse What is the policy of the Vatican towards our government Thank you Very refreshing What were we talking about Oh yes meant to ask you see here that you never took up a scholarship you won to the university at a fantastically early age Why was that had a vocation to the priesthood And you found that out suddenly between sitting for the scholarship and winning it No had always known it had tried to evade it Why Thats an odd question for a layman surely didnt think was worthy So you won the scholarship and then suddenly overnight found you were worthy of the priesthood after all No found that for me had to be a priest That and the next step and the next All my life shirk nothing duck nothing overcome everything You sound tired and afraid of yourself not of us Why Why Please m asking for the last time No Your husband got out of the country with no permit he cant come back You know that you cant get out of here know cant But that doesnt mean have to be unfaithful to him Youve not even heard from him That doesnt mean he hasnt written Why do you see me at all Its always no in the end Because m an ordinary human being Look cant you understand like to go out sometimes and talk and dance Please weve always been friends Youve got lots of girlfriends No wait m sorry said that Shut up in that infernal prison all day watching what goes on youll get so that you say things Come on Lets dance Lets enjoy ourselves please Youre making progress you know m sorry you should think so No its just that were getting to know one another better Tell me about your first curacy St Nicholas wasnt it That was a workingclass district used to know well Rowdy political parties when was a student Very progressive and matey we felt But could never get the ring of conviction in my voice on those platforms Nor in that pulpit Ashamed of preaching to the hungry Thou shalt not steal But well presumably that was a text that you practiced yourself Why do you say that What makes you say that Well does it matter No When did you steal Before became a priest but not long before was very young in that pulpit What did you steal soap Books Books for those scholarship exams Books and paper and pencils used to look down into those faces below the pulpit women mostly Women who werent stealing the things their men and their children needed Yes but you needed the books Ambition Not need Besides Besides always took the best The thick shiny paper and the pencils out of the sixpenny tray But surely you confessed all that off your conscience before you became a priest Oh yes Besides found there was no need to look into their faces You could look between Do you never look into their eyes Now Always One must learn to do these things The mall past the capitol Secret meetings slogans Propaganda being distributed This unrestful development rising Send out a general call to all district headquarters in central command to alert troops to reinforce the patrol duties Orders to fire over their heads Orders to disperse them Full discretion You shouldnt be seen reading that Banned this morning Oh there you are was afraid you werent coming after all Were all on extra duties Theres some trouble boiling up They brought in more guards Well Well hate your being in the prison service Makes it seem worse somehow Not just unfaithful but were the enemy Thats treachery cant get out ve tried You dont do things yourself do you Things are done Like forcing the cardinal to confess to treason so that they can have a trial dont know how can love you being even near such work He could be right You want to believe he stands for things that are fine That you can trust him But what can people like you and me really know do know that hes not a man you can force to anything If they get him to confess you can believe its true But you cant want it to be true If youre in the prison service youd rather think the police were right than that the prisoners were Youre saying that to justify yourself working for them Well it wont justify you to me He is innocent It will only prove this isnt a country anyone can live in If they can twist a man that far and he confesses then d have to join my husband Please Dont talk about it Weve got us to talk about The journalist on the paper banned this morning General this is lunacy Youll admit now that theres a certain urgency The prisoner is not ready Itll destroy weeks of work have my orders have faith in them Youre a brilliant man but conceited Conceit is dangerous Conceit So is sentiment Hes here sir It has been decided to confront you with some evidence of your guilt before you are brought to trial so that you may see that the only course is to appeal to the mercy of the government by pleading guilty street map of the centre of the capital circles secret arsenals crosses on strong points such as the church of St Nicholas there dominating the central railway viaduct Surely a good revolutionary would blow up a viaduct not build a strong point to dominate it must have lost my touch since worked for the Resistance This is your handwriting isnt it It does look like it But this word appears to be spelled in the Italian way Possibly from a letter of mine to the Vatican and thick nibs thin nibs Almost as if someone had cut odd words out of old papers of mine and stuck them on the margin of the map and photographed it photograph of the cathedral crypt Marked on the map is an arsenal if you remember and dated in the corner The place was searched and photographed the day you were arrested The day was arrested The feast of St Fontanelle the one day in the year when the crypt is open to the public Next Steven please What did you steal Money given for the church to start sabotage and fomenting unrest against the government Do you not at least admit that the whole weight of your authority must logically be directed against the government Of course You must admit that a gramophone record cannot be tampered with imagine not You simply edit the tape recording dont you And then rerecord on disk Sound levels werent too good though were they ve never seen a general four ministers and a judge look silly at the same time Is that for the record No How odd it is Theyre just shadows Youre real Youre beginning to feel that dont know m tired Oh God How could forget Go on forgetting my friend This must end in tragedy They lack the leadership that we had in the Resistance Your world now is here Sir the generals on the telephone Oh what now This is the final idiocy ll stop this Oh the fools Eminence Look If thou Lord shall be extreme to remark what is done amiss never learned to pray for her Shouldnt you bless her Bless Shes still quite warm You had her killed You were the doctor to whom my body was so sacred Pride Well My body and hers are one am admitting it to you here Look how kiss

touch with his frame of mind suppose the solitary confinement can go on as long as we like now that the trouble outsides calmed down It can go on until he wants to talk Were up against a good man Hes got to show us where his weakness lies before we can use it to destroy him Meanwhile we must wait Shall take over from him for a bit sir Not on your life Hell lose in the end ve doctored those recordings within an inch of their lives sir We shant need them Every living soul in that sleeping city down there could be broken if they had to be The subtler the mind the more sensitive the conscience the more surely they must be broken Thats the fascination and the pity of it Three sevens are four sevens are five sevens are six sevens are seven sevens are nine Sevens Six sevens are

the word Its a pity its a sport that has to be played with living men What are you fighting Why do you hate yourself know you dont hate you You must m supposed to but cant You dont love your fellow men do you No Is that it or is it something deeper Youve no delight in your God have you nor never had No Is that why you hate yourself Your heroism in the Resistance was that just to convince yourself to prove yourself to yourself Why should you do that What must you keep proving The flesh not weak What are you ashamed of Women priest Even so Thank God no Not in the corners of your mind Not alive pulsing in the dark Not veiled buried drowned waiting No You think all your life was a faade What are you hiding Why are you ashamed Unclean flesh Yes yes My body of her flesh and blood Your mother Behind the fish market Oh she was married was legitimate But knew how it had always been Everyone knew In my little room at night listening to the new feet blundering up the stairs The whispering and the smothered laughter behind the stupid flowered paper on the wall My body of her flesh Oh put a scholars gown on it wrapped it in a cassock tried to cover it And then success To justify the pride something always to prove what wasnt there Not there No heart Theres no love in some of us Dont you think d have found it if there were Your mothers sin your shame for her and for yourself Is that all Only the start Why did become a priest You think the decision was easy Look the day heard d won the university scholarship and had to choose between that and the priesthood tried to kill myself Why Why Because knew the university was secondbest wanted to serve no less than God They should have let me die became a priest because wanted to start again wanted to feel free wanted to feel clean So that was it wanted to justify myself to myself To me not to God And then succeeded can serve men or God or my country but cant care You fake The hero of the Resistance who outwitted the Gestapo for his own vanity The martyr for the church whose only resistance is for his own pride His Eminence the cardinal who could steal the estimation of the world to justify a miserable little tyke of a backstreet drab who smelled of fish Forgiveness Did you preach forgiveness up in your pulpit Forgiveness for those who stole Of course Didnt they have to give back what theyd stolen How can you give back honour Deface the national monument Tell them tell the world as youve told me that your whole life was a fake But you couldnt do that Thered be nothing left Nothing Tell them you betrayed them in the war that they could understand It isnt true Does it matter Madness Its a mad world If you really want to start again as low as the gutter you came from why not tell them that in the war you betrayed them betrayed them Oh God Would you have the courage to say it in open court dont know It couldnt be done Dont mock me Of course if you threw in enough politics to leaven the loaf theyd eat it mustnt confess You mustnt confess You mustnt weaken you so certain of yourself when you came here with your wit and your sacred hands and your insufferable conceit Thats it isnt it Let them see me in the weakness of the flesh and the meanness of the spirit That would be degradation That would be shame enough to burn the past and come through the fire free Thats hysteria No No God Forgive me a moment cant hypnotize you into saying anything you think is wrong Remember that Do you believe that this is what you must do Only this way Not drugged nor hypnotized nor hysterical Sane and whole And with the courage with the grace of God To make restitution in my own way cant believe hell confess to anything He wont you wait He would never have staged a trial if he wasnt ready to confess knew him in the war He may have let them think theyve got him but they will find he can put this bullring to his own use Its better than the pulpit you wait Has the prisoner read the charges against him Yes have heard the charges and confess Well He hasnt yet said what hes confessing to First we will take your personal life as a priest You became a priest did you not for your own glory Yes And all your service to the church was to your own ambition Yes my ambition How can you make people understand that As a priest did you misuse money given to the church Yes confess to that The secrets of the confessional did you use those to extort blackmail Yes And did you sell such information to the police Yes So all your life as a priest was a fake Yes Now to make us understand that tell us about your public life Tell us about your war record worked for the Resistance Oh yes you worked for the Resistance And in the end you betrayed us Tell the court Your Eminence did you betray the Resistance to the Gestapo The links with the Allies the chain that led out of the country In the end betrayed them all No one knew what kind of a man you were did they No one knew that you were reporting to the Gestapo did they You were still able to go on keeping in touch with the Allies werent you Yes Do you deny that since the war you have still kept secretly in touch with foreign governments No Have you received money from them to foment sabotage and unrest Have you Yes Look at the people Your own people Before during and since the war have you deserved their faith Have you betrayed them have betrayed them It isnt true It isnt true Madness Do you want to start again as low as the gutter you came from Throw in enough politics theyll eat it So you have confessed to every charge of personal corruption and public treason brought against you have confessed enough And that you aimed to set up a government with yourself at its head The worst you can find to say Is it not enough Counsel for the defence After such a confession the prisoner can only throw himself on the mercy of the court Not on the mercy of this court Upon the mercy of God Oh God let me go mad Let me go mad How does he seem Interesting He was broken by a halftruth a distorted truth He was too humble He believed it when told him his whole world was built on pride proud man would have been more sceptical Have you seen the press sir Congratulations Yes lve trained you well suppose in time you will come to drive a brilliant mind to pray for madness It had to be done sir Oh yes it had to be done Youre just feeling the reaction after the trial Mustnt let a little squeamishness spoil your triumph Been good as gold these last few days Hey you get back to your murderer in number eight leave

sides of the same man talking to each other But to let sympathy for the side that was you take over even for a moment from sheer sentiment To risk losing everything d worked for and achieved It means youve defeated me Youre no convert For you your cause will always be right And what use to my cause is a man who is too fastidious to trust No shant wait to let them find that out Your certificate of physical and mental health An appropriate use for my last official signature It doesnt make sense You pulled it off youll get recognition Thank you but still want to resign Why All right dont choose
