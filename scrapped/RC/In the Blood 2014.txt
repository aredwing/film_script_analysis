were not getting all the information that we need What does that mean Was anyone drinking You know there wasnt any drinking have a right to ask You already know the answer to that Well there are many ambulance companies on this island Theyre unregulated so its highly competitive First one on the scene gets paid Its a wonderful island but with opportunistic and dubious parties everybodys trying to
