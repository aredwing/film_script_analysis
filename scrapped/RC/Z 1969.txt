One can prevent mildew by spraying with copper sulfate There are classic solutions used one from Bordeaux the other from Burgundy Burgundy being a region in France which is reputed for its wine Three sprayings a year are required The first when the shoots reach two or three centimetres long the second just before or after the flowering and the third a month later The treatment is preventative and must not be neglected Gentlemen ll finish my speech on mildew prevention remind you that as in previous years airplanes and flyers will be placed at your disposal to remind the farmers that mildew a disease that destroys vines appeared simultaneously with that other ideological disease which has devastated men But the Chief of Police will develop this point Any similarity to actual persons or events is deliberate As the Undersecretary of Agriculture said An ideological illness is like mildew and requires preventive measures Like mildew it is due to septic germs and various parasitic agents So the treatment of men with appropriate solutions is indispensable The st stage occurs in the schools where if youll pardon the metaphor the sprouts are still very young The nd treatment occurs when they begin to bloom as college students or young workers The draft is the best time to spray and save the sacred tree of national liberty from the disease of ideological mildew Airdropped leaflets are telling our peasants of a new kind of ideological mildew beginning to ravage our land This new variety is spreading insidiously Its a sly enemy pushing us away from God and the Crown Its against this enemy that our action is aimed Dont take notes Its all in our pamphlet With the outbreak of isms like socialism anarchism imperialism or communism sunspots start to multiply on the face of the golden orb God refuses to enlighten the Reds Scientists forecast an increase in sunspots due to the arrival of the beatniks and pacifists from certain countries such as ltaly France and Scandinavia As head

up the town Why hold them back wonder if weve any will to fight He had Thats why they killed him Not us Come on Its all could find The papers The cops put the blame on us Coffee The broadcasting of the speech was a provocation The antinational tone of the attack on foreign policy aroused the crowd at once Hence the violence The police handled the situation efficiently yet policemen were injured in the course of duty So said the Gen to the Press We must answer that Yes and stress the pacifist nature of our rally We had permission So the cops could do a better job on us But we have no proof Nothing valid We can only deplore the polices passiveness Later well underline all the contradictions Why not call the Red Cross or the Rights of Man Commission Youre making a crybaby defense We must attack and expose those responsible Take up arms in the streets Why not Anything goes We can consider Nothing at all It must be legal Weve been legal for years This is no time to change Its our only way Or the affair could backfire Arent you ashamed Hes dying in there Weve no case against them And the threats on his life He too ignored them But that was yesterday Will your guy talk now Statement to the Press doubt it He was scared then of reprisals And now even more so Try Can you find him Not before noon Well have to be careful Were being watched Its them But theyre protecting us Were as safe as the doctor What was your reaction to the news The President sent you a telegram Saying what Happily wed Was he threatened Youll let the Reds exploit this Was it an attempted assassination Whyd you send for a British surgeon Did you want a divorce Was it an accident Theyre operating for the rd time Heres the hospital director Your husbands had an accident knew your husband We were at school together wanted to go to his peace marathon but it was forbidden Its serious but hell make it Prof Dodd from London is here Hes one of Englands best surgeons Want to tell them the truth Theyll live the truth later The fall broke the dome of the skull and no doubt the brain has been affected The shock was very violent causing an explosion inside the skull like an earthquake cant evaluate the aftereffects of the concussion even if the operation succeeds The rd operation has just begun His heart is the only positive factor Weve massaged and used adrenaline and its resistance is amazing Its beating regularly Come in Gen Missou stupid accident m deeply sorry Head of the Police We have the culprit AttorneyGen My sympathies The inquest judge Well certain areas of the brain have been affected but the lesions cant be defined But the surgeons are optimistic We must await the end of the rd operation Your husbands heart is exceptional If it holds hell live We have every hope The capital is on the phone The Ministry Theyll try to use his wife Theyll use peoples emotions The files Their committee secretary want rsums on each Details of their private lives and jobs too For this evening The injured senator The other lawyer And his Have it It just came Any love affairs dont know but there must be Break his halo Does he get along with his wife Watching her Like the others General of our men dont want to know that They met this morning picked up his wife then separated Some took his wife to the clinic As for this one He took a statement to the Press You have a copy Then he saw some university students Students Call our students That ones a mad dog He wants to make the most of it Jew Only half They think theyre superior even to other Jews The AttGen Good Stay on him night and day We were expecting you The nd culprit We have him He turned himself in Come into my office Please sit down Hes boss now officially So youre to give him your initial findings and then follow his instructions My deputyll keep me posted The Cols men have checked Can see the nd culprit Whenever you want to It seems he was asleep on the truck dead drunk So hes innocent if it all checks out Their whereabouts earlier The drivers statement and photo Theyd been drinking at the Chinamans bar We have Chinese tradesmen in town The owner was in the Korean War and now hes called the Chinaman He backs them up ll read his statement l Bertrand alias the Chinaman etc bar owner etc do state that on May of this year Yago and Vago came into my bar at pm and stayed until pm They were drinking Pernod Its not allowed Madam l saw Yago and Vago drinking Pernod all evening They left at pm drunk The Chinaman said Not in the Kamikaze Kamikaze The pickup truck Its Japanese made Youd think were in the Far East think its clear Though we lack some details on the culprits its obviously an accident agree Besides the Minister phoned and wants this settled very quickly to cut short political speculation abroad think the prosecutor must make a statement about the accident today and say the culprits are caught and accused of drunken driving and assault and battery And wilful flight Naturally And the man who took him to the clinic Its for you He just died That doesnt change the statement Instead of assault and battery say manslaughter Go away Shoula ll wait for you Who are you An admirer of your husband reporter No photos Only a few questions The public has a right to know Was it an accident Or not at all Yesterday his life was threatened Did you know You expected it You said So they finally did it What did say To the hospital director you said So they finally did it Whore they Go away The culprits have been arrested You thought of them Go away They know already Yes and its only beginning Unmask the killers The police is an accomplice Wait dont understand The fall didnt kill him Not at all The skull fracture was due to a blow struck on the head Thats our conclusion The fall caused minor bruises Youre sure blow You mean by the truck The truck hit his body It wasnt serious The death blow hit his skull and was made by an instrument such as a club an iron bar or a gun butt But no ones mentioned a weapon Continue Doctor The skull fracture can only be due to a weapon that struck from above Thats the sole condition that causes symmetrical lesions on the brain touching the subjacent area and the area opposite the wound An autopsy showed the lesions the right cerebral hemorrhage and the fracture of the left temple In the case of a shock due to a fall on a hard surface like the street such lesions couldnt exist Why didnt you tell us sooner Yesterday Mr Deputy he was still alive We needed an autopsy Time for other tests wouldve shown the same facts Another hypothesis is if the truck dragged him his skull couldve hit the curb Its a fact that he was hit in the middle of the street Then a fall couldnt cause such lesions phone Next door Yago was driving The nd man was drunk and couldnt have been so precise demonstrator Their storys odd Know them well Very well Political Maybe Communists Not if they work here The opposition One never knows The General please wanted to see you to clarify a few points It all seems clear enough to me new fact has come up Its stuffy in here You saw the accident How did it happen In what respect When the truck arrived what happened The Col and were there when he walked out waving to the crowd They didnt applaud him either He didnt see the truck zigzagging toward him and he was hit The Cols men ran after the truck but due to the crowd they didnt fire The truck zigzagged and finally got away The police cleared the square and helped put the victim into a to go to the hospital No trace of the driver Not yet but he must be a friend of theirs He helped them at once When the victim was run over could his head have hit the curb No it occurred in the square Youre sure Positive But whats this new fact The autopsy says he was killed by a club club Why did the doctors do an autopsy Its the legal procedure Yesterday it was all settled Now youll foul us up new witness He claims he has proof the senator was assassinated Hell be here today at pm There you are An assassination Soon theyll say it was a plot saw him Hes drunk He nearly fell in front of the truck What happened You saw it Yes he slipped and fell Anybody here Anybody here m the Chief of Police was on my way to testify and as walked along You fell and hit your head You suffer from epilepsy Someone hit me was on my way to testify the senator was assassinated It was no accident Yago told me so himself was gonna testify But someone hit me on the head from a truck with a club to keep me quiet They tried to kill me dont know who told

no time Tomorrow youll have then Theyll say Yago did this or that anything Vague worthless statements thatll create unrest They sent him and beat him up to turn a witness into a martyr They left him hospitalised yet able to talk You admit was beaten and didnt fall You realise what perjury means Its not perjury wanted to help but if d known Told ya so Whyd ya get involved Werent ya alright at home

the hospital Where were you that night At the Chinamans with Yago till You see Yago often Were friends and cousins Was he drunk Yago drinks a lot The Chinaman told him not to take the Kamikaze got in

off In the street He leaped like tiger Before that Lithe and fierce Yago used the same words Yet he didnt see him simple coincidence They havent met since the accident The police can swear to it Continue was in the street and almost got run over Then went home Next day when read the papers went to the cops who put me in hospital There he got lost in the halls and met that reporter by accident That agrees with the other testimony Yet one phrase makes me wonder It could change my investigation Youre a Red You and Yago too Something you said makes me think so The rich get a cold week in bed

birds said Colonel ll do my best The police colonel Yes Lets start at the beginning Can you come in Deputy Prolonging the inquest gives the opposition fuel for subversive action Youve sided with them Its not a prolongation Its a totally new case Some points are awkward but the case is clear On the contrary We began with an accident and drunks Some ice dear Their testimony coincides in detail Confirmed by the Chinaman Next day the autopsy says death was due to a blow by a club nd autopsy will say no and a confirmationll disprove the initial autopsy d had no time to examine this new theory when a witness says it was an assassination Based on a vague discussion On his way to see me the witness is clubbed and is still in the hospital What do you mean m only stating facts Then comes the reporter Hes not a militant and thats important learn Yago and Vago belong to the Christian Royalist know know along with the assailant of the nd senator and most of those at the demonstration It seems the police know and use them as auxiliaries to maintain order for state visits Thats yet to be proven like the fact that the Police Col drove this man to the demonstration Really He wouldnt be involved with such a person Not openly No onell believe it My conclusion is this As a case of drunken driving its simple but impossible If we accept the premeditated act of a group aided or simply abetted by the police it all becomes clear and fits together This is serious must phone the Minister favor the accident theory Premeditated if you wish by drunken fanatics Yes you dont smoke You must settle this quickly The country even the whole world is watching and waiting Our countrys honor is at stake Dont bother with these fools Your future lies before you This case can either make or break your career Trust in my experience My group is authorised by the State We are honest citizens healthy elements of Society antibodies in the fight against infection We want to protect Western Christian civilisation But it is a moral struggle No members of my group were at the demonstration Where were you that night was at the Dockers Union Alibi confirmed was playing cards with my dentist Confirmed m a baker slept till midnight at my shop Alibi confirmed was at the Chinamans Confirmed At the Chinamans Confirmed played cards with my dentist Confirmed Thats not you at the demonstration It does look like me Indicted for perjury along with those who confirmed his alibi Plus obstructing justice Take him away Witness has died of a heart attack He owned the meeting hall Earlier you stated Yago hit you with a club like a police billyclub Do you maintain that Yes Judge The AttGen says he phoned you that the senators life had been threatened Your superiors never got his message Yes forgot to

deported to the islands His testimony is suspect of course wouldnt use it Never mind They want to eliminate all troublesome witnesses They just tried to get me What Attempted murder Just now The plot continues And will continue dont need your advice This involves the top brass The polices their toy And cops havent the possibility to commit such a murder without being protected The guilty ones are in the government or at the palace where the General is head of the guards And the palace takes orders from abroad One more word and ll charge you with defamation of the State This isnt a rally What
