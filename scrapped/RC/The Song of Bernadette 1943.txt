Massabielle again unless you yourself give me permission And that can promise you youll never get m gonna send you to your Aunt Bernardes where youll forget this foolishness Home with you And you too Thank you for your kindness Madame Nicolau And thank you too monsieur What do you think of it all Maman Things like that bode no good As long as live ll never see anything more beautiful than the face of that girl as she lay there at Massabielle One ought not even touch a being like that Maman Maman Huh What is it Bernadettes crying Whats the matter my lamb Come to Mother Well sit by the fire Oh Maman The lady was so beautiful Just to think of her makes me feel There there there Girls of your age often see things that dont exist But it passes You must just put it out of your mind Youre a big girl now Soon youll be a woman Youll marry a man and youll have children just as did Life goes fast my child Its hard to believe how fast If she stays here fear for her health She speaks to no one She doesnt sleep She doesnt eat enough to keep a bird alive Bernarde could she live with you You dont know what it is to have everybody point you out as the father of that idiot You are also the girls father And you seem to overlook the fact that you are her mother Two people in the world who should be understanding You want to ship her off like a sack of flour m thinking only of Only of yourself Bernadette is a simple honest child She hasnt the cunning to invent anything like this She sees this lady Nobody else does Who are you to say that she is wrong and you are right This lady may well be a heavenly creature Heavenly creatures dont appear in a filthy place like a city dump Christ was born in a stable This is a wild story Bernadette tells But since the lady has asked her to go to the grotto for days she must go Oh wont allow her to go again You will go with her You cant hide your head in the sand as if she were up to some harmless mischief that doesnt concern you This is no joke Consider what this means to Bernadette But whatll people say Nothing if you take your place by her side All the women of the family must stand by her ll come And when walk with her let anyone dare to laugh The matter has been put before the council and approved Therefore fully convinced that your request is justified am forwarding your plan as well as my recommendation Commissioner To the minister of the interior Signed Baron Massey prefect So you see gentlemen the ceaseless protestations of your mayor have borne fruit The highest authorities are contemplating bringing the railroad to Lourdes Splendid Magnificent Commissioner What That Soubirous girl She just went to Massabielle again What should do thought her mother forbade it But today her mother went with her To think that such a thing could happen in the middle of the th century Why the girls insane Or suffering from hallucinations Your Honor may suggest you act without delay But monsieur for the mayor even to acknowledge the existence of such a situation would only give it importance an importance which the newspapers would not ignore Its a matter for the imperial prosecutor No Unfortunately the state has no charges to prefer Its up to the police commissioner But no one has broken any law Its the duty of the district officer Massabielles in your district isnt it Yes Then take care of it Hi ran ahead to tell you m not alone today hope you wont mind Maman Aunt Bernarde and my sister are with me and some other people followed us m sorry but Maman wouldnt let me come by myself desire that people should come here Where is she Is she here Oh yes Shes standing there in the niche Shes greeting you now See Clear out down there all of you Return to your homes immediately Did you hear me said clear out This is hopeless Its more than one policeman can handle Its a scandal It cries to heaven Imagine these pennyaliners having the audacity to print such a thing All France will be laughing at us and Lourdes was going to have a railroad connection d even gone so far as to have the plans drawn up for the depot Do you think theyll be granted to us now Never Whos going to run a railroad into a hole where spooks perform their medieval antics in dirty caverns Were dealing with a whole lot more than the mere babbling of a little swindler or an imbecile The entire future of this town is at stake Something must be done to stop this nonsense immediately How How Thats up to you and the prosecutor As much as d like to put an end to this stupidity m helpless She goes peacefully to the outskirts of the city There she kneels says her rosary and goes home again Is there anything unlawful in that Yes on the ground that its insulting to religious sensibilities Really You can hardly call seeing the Blessed Virgin in a veritable cesspool complimentary to the Holy Family She hasnt claimed to see the Blessed Virgin The crowd claims that She says she sees a beautiful lady and the visioning of a beautiful lady can hardly be construed as a criminal violation It better not be or else the entire male population would be spending time behind bars This is hardly the moment for levity Yes what is it Pardon me sir but Dr Dozous is here to see you Ask the doctor to wait Just a moment Dr Dozous might be very helpful to us Lets not overlook the vast possibilities offered by a diagnosis of insanity Yes Ask the doctor to come in Yes sir Will you please come in doctor Thank you Doctor Bonjour Messieurs bonjour Hello doctor m sorry to interrupt gentlemen but ve made several visits to Massabielle for the purpose of observation Today examined the girl You might be interested in my report Yes of course Wont you sit down Splendid What did you find Well arrived at the grotto simultaneously with the crowd Immediately the Soubirous girl knelt before a niche in the cliff and made a series of courteous graceful reverential gestures Did you see anything in this niche No Did anybody else No Well then didnt the crowd laugh at her No There was something about her that precluded laughter Her exaltation was so genuine that the observer almost had the impression that he saw what the child saw Then as we continued to gaze at her her face turned as pale as marble and her skin grew so taut that the structure of the skull appeared clearly marked at the temples Considering the possibility that this was due to cerebral anemia took her pulse It was practically average Also there was no affection of the nervous system as in catalepsy or hysteria Even her eye reflexes were normal Did she speak to this thing in the niche Standing close beside her heard twice in succession a long drawnout Yes Yes Wrung from her very depths Evidently shed been asked to convey a message because shortly after she turned to the crowd and said Pray for all sinners Anyone who talks to something that isnt there is feebleminded Another medical possibility which took into consideration Wanting to test her mental abilities put this question to her Do you know what a sinner is Without hesitation she answered Certainly monsieur sinner is one who loves evil Thats quite a good answer What pleased me was that she said loves and not does Well after this any diagnosis of feeblemindedness was out of the question Then shes a swindler Theres no justification for such an assumption must presume that you have joined the ranks of the believers in this vision am a doctor contribute to the Medical Courier m a member of several scientific societies trust that is answer enough If have correctly understood your report doctor it is this Science excludes fraud It excludes mental disease and a miraculous occurrence venture then to ask science what is left Yes what is left If the Church stops it the people cannot blame us Precisely We can sit back and sympathize with both sides very wise attitude for any government Is the dean at home Yes Come in Good morning gentlemen Good morning Father Come in Take off your coats presume the Soubirous girl is what brings you here Yes The Church attributes no religious significance whatsoever to the socalled visions of Massabielle Sit down m very glad to hear that Father Then you will talk with this girl and No it does not concern me That is a matter for you city officials We had hoped you would cooperate with us That am doing Sit down have instructed the cantonal clergy not to set foot in the grotto and to ignore the whole matter But Your Reverence has enormous power over the people here It would be appropriate to raise your voice have no intention of adding further importance to this turmoil Then you force the state to invoke the law which prohibits the Church from opening any new place of worship without the consent of the minister of worship The Church has not opened any new place of worship The Church neither sponsors nor recognizes these heathen gymnastics taking place at Massabielle Then how can you stand by and see your parishioners carry on these pagan ceremonies understand that they use a kitchen table as an altar and there they pray Yes on a spot littered with filth they pray to God Prayer gentlemen is good no matter where it is offered Yes yes Well shall we be going Thank you Father wish you a pleasant good morning Good morning Father Good morning Father That sly old fox By agreeing with us hes dumped the problem right back in our laps Unfortunately the followers of the girl are citizens of this community and the thought of offending them is not pleasant with the election coming Then why offend them Why not refer the matter to higher authorities very good suggestion monsieur ll write to the prefect immediately consider it purely a local problem to be solved by local authorities and do not wish to be involved in any way whatsoever Settle it without delay The method leave entirely in the capable hands of you and your associates Signed Baron Massey prefect There he sits like a general safely out of the range of fire and orders a handful of men without any weapons to wipe out an impregnable fortress Our capable hands Theyre only capable when theres a ticklish job to be done To think that one stupid girl could cause all this trouble Only because there are millions of others just as stupid as she is What can you expect from a peasantry fed on religious dogmas and nurtured on superstitious nonsense firmly believe that this girl and what she stands for is a menace to civilization She is dangerous admit but Shes a religious fanatic and every time religious fanaticism steps forward man moves backward and that is why will fight this vigorously and ll resort to any measures to defeat it dont know much about higher politics but do know a lot about burglars and thieves and scamps of all kinds know how to scare them and apply pressure promise you that if you give me five minutes with this girl shell never go near the grotto again Try it by all means Try anything was thinking of somewhat the same procedure however not quite so crude Theres something about the title imperial prosecutor that makes people quake Without raising my voice m confident You cant handle people like this with silk gloves and fancy words We shall see Send for two of your policemen Just the one Bernadette You stay here and wait for Maman Dont worry her Tell her ve gone to the city hall with these gentlemen What are you arresting her for Dont interfere with the law The law Death for the law Death for you too Madame Davan Madame Davan Theyre arresting Bernadette Madame Probert Madame Probert Look what those pigs are doing Do you know who am Oh yes monsieur You are the imperial prosecutor And that title means that have been appointed by His Majesty the emperor He has vested in me the power to punish anyone who perpetrates a fraud against this community Now do you understand my position Oh yes youre much the same as Monsieur Jacomet good deal more am his superior officer He hunts down the criminals and swindlers send them to prison Oh Now bearing in mind my title and realizing the extent of my authority ask you never again to go to Massabielle Oh but must monsieur The lady has asked me Now there you go again with this lady Bernadette youll admit you are very ignorant the worst pupil in the school That is true monsieur am very stupid Then take heed when intelligent people assure you that this lady is only a childish bit of imagination an absurd dream The first time saw the lady thought it was a dream too There now Now that wasnt so stupid Once you can mistake a dream for something real but not six times Isnt it strange that until your first visit to Massabielle your family was destitute Now your mother is employed by a wealthy family and your father has a steady job and your followers have showered your household with clothing and foodstuffs Now if the court were to decide that your lady represents a profitable business scheme it would go very hard with you have not accepted one thing monsieur because knew the lady would not like it Look my child am trying to help you Hes using the wrong technique Hell get nowhere am not asking you to retract anything merely want you to promise me that you will accept my counsel If can monsieur will Good Now put your hand in mine and promise me that you will not go to the grotto again That cannot promise monsieur Let me remind you that am the imperial prosecutor know monsieur You told me that before Now listen carefully Bernadette In the next room is Jacomet He is cruel and mean Furthermore he believes that everyone should be treated like a criminal If you refuse me will be forced to turn you over to him can promise you it will be horrible He will have you cringing and crying in no time but can spare you all this if you will only be reasonable Well what is your answer It is the same monsieur must keep my promise to the lady Very well am finished with you If youre intent upon your own destruction go Yes monsieur Whats your name But you know my name monsieur Whats your name Soubirous Bernadette Before go further want you to know will write down everything you say Such a paper is known as a deposition to be sent to the imperial prefect at Tarbes Besides we also have Monsieur Estrade for a witness Be very careful what you say Now about this lady you claim to see Do you know who she is No monsieur dont What does she wear white veil with a blue girdle and theres a rose on each foot She stands quite still like a statue in church No shes ever so natural She moves about and talks to me She greets the people and even laughs Hmm Do your parents believe this story of yours No monsieur dont think they do And yet you expect me to believe when your own parents dont If your lady were real wouldnt other people see her too dont see why they cant Shes there Now pay attention m going to read your answers back to you so you can confirm their correctness Bernadette Soubirous declares the lady wears a blue veil and white girdle No a white veil and a blue girdle Youre contradicting yourself you said a white girdle You must have made a mistake in writing it down Bernadette Soubirous declares the lady resembles the statue of the Blessed Virgin in the parish church No thats not true The lady has nothing to do with the Blessed Virgin in the church Thats enough Nothing but a complete confession could save you now Tell me the names of those in league with you and dont lie because know every one of them dont understand what youre saying monsieur Well ll tell you Certain persons have put you up to circulating this disgusting story Theyve trained you stupid as you are to reel off by rote exactly what they taught you Now tell me Who are these people But you said a moment ago monsieur you knew them The police are outside awaiting my orders to take you to jail But if you promise before this witness never to go to Massabielle again No must keep my promise to the lady You want me to call the police If the police take me cant help it And thats not all ll have your parents thrown into jail too The rest of your family will starve Come in What the devil do you want My child thats all want My child Listen Soubirous this business at the grotto has got to stop wont stand it any longer So help me God thats all want too Its destroying my family The girls a minor Youre responsible for her Forbid her to go out except to school Lock her up at home because if you dont ll lock up the whole bunch of you Now get out God help you if have to summon you again Well monsieur what do you think of it think you were extremely fortunate in having the father break in just when he did The authorities preventing her going to Massabielle has made her seem more important to her schoolmates That is most unfortunate The children whisper about nothing else d hoped with your permission to talk to them No The bishop of Tarbes has forbidden us to recognize the situation and hes right in doing so Do you remember that girl in Avignon Rose Tamisier She claimed to have seen the Most Blessed Virgin also The vicar general of that diocese was patient and understanding Consequently the people mistook his attitude for approbation Then later when the child was exposed as a fraud the Church was looked upon as her partner in crime Immediately atheism flared up and the anticlerical forces triumphed That is not going to happen here What had in mind Father could hardly be construed as approbation plan to make an example of her in front of the class Ridicule Yes Father You have my permission to try it Good day Sister Good day Father Thank you She cant go on like this Night after night My poor little one what have they done to you Speak to me If cant go and see her anymore shall die You shall see her dont care what Sister Vauzous says You will go again to Massabielle and no one will prevent you and if they lock me up well let them But you shall see her hope Baron Massey subscribes to this paper Sounds a little different from the last editorial doesnt it Listen to this The officials at Lourdes are to be highly commended for stamping out these disgusting spectacles But have a feeling they will return to criticism again tomorrow What makes you think that Because am a man of greater vision than you monsieur Especially when sit in this particular chair told them if they did this again d put all of them in jail Careful commissioner If you do that ll have to release them in minutes and then we would look foolish There must be some law to stop them Commissioner know theyre going to Massabielle You dont have to tell me ve got eyes Theyre not going to Massabielle No Theyve already been They were there at this morning Theyre on their way to the dean The dean Yes The girl said the lady gave her a message for him Well it seems the gods have finally sided with us Gentlemen maybe now the Church will be forced to take a stand whether it wants to or not Excuse me Your Reverence What do you want Who are you Bernadette Soubirous Oh So youre the urchin every idiot in France is talking about Do your courtiers and servants always follow you If any of that crowd dare to enter my garden ll have them arrested Well speak What do you want of me The lady told me What lady The lady in Massabielle Dont know her Shes a beautiful lady who comes to me Is she from Lourdes No Have you asked her name Yes but she gives no answer Perhaps she is deaf and dumb Oh no she speaks to me What does she say Just now the lady said Please go to the priests and tell them a chapel is to be built here Priests What does that mean It appears your lady is a confirmed heathen The very cannibals have priests We Catholics have religious each with a specific title But the lady did say priests Well youve come to the wrong place anyhow Have you any money to build a chapel No have no money at all Then you go tell your lady if she wants a chapel shell need money Yes Ill And you can also tell her the dean of Lourdes considers it unfitting for a lady to climb barefoot on rocks and to send gibbering adolescents with messages And whats more once and for all he demands she leave him in peace Do you understand Yes Your Reverence ll tell her everything Just one moment Do you see this broom Yes Your Reverence Then listen carefully If you dare to annoy me ever again ll take this broom and with my own hands ll Come in forgot something Your Reverence The lady also said Let processions come hither Processions eh And do you think tomorrow would be soon enough for your lady Yes m sure she would be delighted Now that ve given you the messages One moment ll decide when youre to go Close the door want you to convey a message to your lady for me You find her quite extraordinary dont you Oh yes Your Reverence Good We shall find how extraordinary she is have heard that theres a wild rosebush growing in the grotto Is that true Oh yes Right under the niche where the lady always stands Splendid want you to tell the lady this The dean of Lourdes would like her to perform a little miracle He would like her to make the wild rosebush bloom now this last week in February Do you understand Yes Your Reverence Then repeat what said The dean of Lourdes would like the lady to perform a little miracle to make the wild rosebush bloom now this last week in February Is that correct Yes ll tell the lady Good day Your Reverence Squad halt Well gentlemen m off to see the miracle Bring me back a dozen roses will you please rather think ll bring you back a hundred dozen disillusioned people The dean set no definite time Why do you assume that todays the day We dont Her followers did that It shall be on Thursday they said Why Thursday Because someone figured out that she first saw the lady on a Thursday the lady returned to her on a Thursday so naturally the buds shall burst on a Thursday Buds or no buds youll never destroy that girls faith Can you say the same of the crowd Wouldnt we be surprised if the bush did bloom today Dont underestimate the dean of Lourdes Who is the best authority on roses in this district Peyramale The weather too for that matter You mean you think the dean merely think it is singularly strange that Peyramale of all people picks a rosebush of all things to demonstrate a miracle Why didnt he ask the lady to make the rock into a white horse or change the river water into wine Anything yet No Then nothing will happen Shh Quiet Keep still Its no use tell you The bush will not bloom Shh Will you keep quiet All right but you will see Life is not like that dont see something Do you Go to the spring Drink of the water and wash there No not the river Not the river The spring yonder Eat of the plants Eat of the plants Whats she doing now Shh Drink of the spring and wash there To the spring Drink of the water and wash myself What is she looking for She uses her nose like a pig Yes and she roots up the ground Come darling No no must wash myself in the spring Theres no spring here Bernadette There is There is The lady said so Come Citizens Shh At last youve seen with your own eyes what we officials have known all along that this story of the Blessed Virgin was born in a sick and warped mind Youve been duped by an idiot beg of you go back to your homes and never return here again Fall in Dont be sad Antoine told you not to hope too much knew it would not bloom You must learn to expect nothing from God and when you get nothing you wont be disappointed Keep still Go away and let me alone From the time we are kneehigh they tell us the Blessed Virgin is loving and good Was she good to that girl just now Was she good to me Me Bouriette the finest stonecarver in Lourdes ll never forget that day was carving a statue for the church chip of marble flew off my chisel and hit me in the eye and as quick as that was no longer a stonecutter and thats how the Blessed Virgin repaid me by throwing a stone in my eye Ever since its been like looking through a

violent convulsions complete paralysis of the legs Couldnt we assume a mere atrophy due to rickets couldnt Then the water at Massabielle must contain an unknown and powerful therapeutic substance At any rate must report on this case to the medical journals Mmm d hesitate to do that It might make you an object of ridicule It wont be an easy thing to write m not accustomed to believing things cant see What about you Father Youve been very silent What do you make of all this Well unlike a doctor a religious must believe a great many things he cannot see Sometimes confess its extremely difficult Last night when came here it was very dark Its much lighter now Good morning gentlemen And no longer are his legs like dishrags Now theyre firm and strong And without Bernadette it couldnt have been Let me say a prayer by her bedside Heavenly Father no Save your prayers for Mass Go home to your wife Charles Tonight you will all have dinner with us We will have an omelet feet wide Good morning Maman Good morning Papa Good morning Bernadette Good morning Bernadette And then she held him in that icecold water and all of a sudden the baby began to cry Not a weak sickly cry but a healthy one And both doctors agree a great change took place They confess they cant understand it Its left them wondering What do you think of it Father too am wondering And you know the baby was never strong enough to cry before Then on the way home the child slept in his mothers arms When he woke up he was smiling and hungry The baby began to stir He was moving his legs Since he was born his legs were as if they had no muscles The doctors couldnt do anything This is awful Yes commissioner By sunrise that whole hillside will look like a sugar loaf crawling with ants It wont be so bad after tomorrow Why She said the lady only asked her to come for times Tomorrow makes This is no longer a curiosity Its a disease The crowd will come if shes here or not Where are you going No place monsieur Whats in that basket Commissioner my wife is very sick Is your wife in the basket No monsieur Lets see Monsieur thought could sell some hot chestnuts and wine There we are Now its started Pretty soon theyll be selling sausages You want sausage ve got sausage too Go on Move Well who is this lady She must have a name Didnt you ask her her name ve told you to time and time again Now its too late did ask her today Well What she said didnt understand Well speak What was it You havent forgotten No repeated it many times so wouldnt forget She said am the Immaculate Conception Immaculate Conception Immaculate Conception Immaculate Conception Do you know what it means am the Immaculate Conception Dont be afraid my child sent for you to help you not to scold you Well No Your Reverence do not know what it means Do you know the meaning of the word immaculate Yes know that An immaculate thing is clean Good and conception Well well leave that for the moment Do you know what we mean when we speak of the original sin Yes The original sin was committed by Adam and Eve when they did not remain faithful to God but broke his command Father Pomian taught you that didnt he Now think hard Didnt he also speak of the Immaculate Conception No Father never mentioned that dogma It doesnt belong to the pedagogic material of the elementary class Perhaps Sister Vauzous discussed it m sure she didnt Well you must have heard the expression somewhere Now try to remember Maybe ve heard about it but dont remember Very well ll try to explain it The Most Blessed Virgin Mary was preserved free from all stain of original sin even from the first instant of her presence in her mothers womb God did this for her because she was to be the mother of Jesus Christ a most singular privilege of grace Do you understand that Bernadette No Your Reverence Why should you Great scholars have racked their brains about it for centuries But perhaps you can grasp this one thing If the Most Blessed Virgin were to speak she could not say of herself am the Immaculate Conception All she could say would be am the fruit of the Immaculate Conception Birth and conception are events but a person is not an event You cant say am conception am birth Consequently your lady is guilty of an inexcusable blunder You must admit that The next time see her will tell her Your Reverence Excuse me Father promised to look in on Madame Cenac Certainly Goodbye Bernadette Goodbye Father Pomian What am to do with you Bernadette Your eyes seem honest your words sincere yet cannot believe you Today less than ever As your confessor beseech you renounce this falsehood confess that your mother or your father or your aunt or someone suggested that phrase that you might become important in mens eyes But cant confess that It isnt true No one suggested anything to me Have you ever thought about your life what your future would be like Like the future of all the girls hereabout After First Communion girls may indulge in proper pleasures They go to dances at the festivals meet young men and after a time please God they marry and have children Wouldnt you like to be such a girl Oh yes d like to go to dances have a husband someday Then wake up Now Otherwise life is at an end for you You are playing with fire Bernadette Commissioner Yes That spring at the grotto the people are drinking quite a bit of that water arent they By the bucketful What they dont drink they carry away in pots and pans and bottles Thats good Well theyre still at it You thought it was bad before you ought to take a look at it now The sick lame canes crutches some of them even look like lepers Listen to this commissioner December All waters contained in springs wells streams rivers or any other source whatsoever shall not be consumed by anyone whosoever until the aforementioned waters have been thoroughly analyzed by a registered chemist Thats perfect You know had a feeling that somewhere in all these books d find one old law thatd suit our purpose Now shall send my men out to close the grotto now Not so fast First well take this to the mayor And he will issue a proclamation Come in Come in gentlemen Thank you have good news monsieur The holocaust will spread no more have a way to stop it Our troubles are over And ironically enough its the waters of Massabielle that will quench this fire Its an old law Look there Read it In the interest of public health Of course with such an important analysis well need the opinions of many chemists and that might take months and months and months wonder wonder if were not being a little too hasty in this Perhaps we are shortsighted in dismissing the possibility of divine power in regard to Massabielle For after all m sure that you gentlemen as well as do not want to oppose the will of God Your sudden religious fervor is most touching Your Honor Could it be prompted by the fact that the devout masses have brought with them a wave of prosperity to Lourdes Monsieur But now that you mention it we shouldnt overlook that either Our hotels are filled our cafs are crowded Our shopkeepers have never known such business The railroad will surely take advantage of this influx of visitors and extend its line here Yes yes and in that case we shall need more hotels But aside from all that m thinking mainly of the thousands of pilgrims who come here daily with hope in their hearts If they derive any benefit from the water at Massabielle who are we to deprive them of it Then too think of the vast number who cannot come to Lourdes For them we could bottle the miraculous water and it could be sold at a nominal fee all over the world Your Honor will you dictate the proclamation to close the grotto or would you rather that contact Baron Massey and ask for permission to do it myself Very well ll do it But think you gentlemen are making a big mistake Now why not think it over for a time Courreges take a proclamation Come in commissioner Any trouble Oh no We finally wiped out this epidemic No To wipe out an epidemic you must eliminate the cause ll have the grotto patrolled night and day Nothing can happen now Perhaps nothing can happen at the grotto Since the lady is a figment of Bernadettes imagination she can see her anyplace Beside the river in the hovel where she lives or if she wishes on the very steps of the city hall The next fence we build must be around her imagination Have you ever heard of Dr Deboe Yes ve just written him asking him to come to Lourdes for a few days Just a moment Come along The imperial prosecutor wants to see you You cant take her Shes done nothing Come on ll go Maman Dont worry It wont be long Why must you keep plaguing her Shes tired and ill Leave her alone Please never felt that Dr Dozous examination of the girl was extensive enough Well after all Dr Dozous is a general practitioner Advances in psychiatry have been so rapid that only a specialist could hope to keep up with them Do you think the girl is insane monsieur My dear doctor am a great respecter of medical science therefore think that as a layman am not qualified to have an opinion However do think that the bare facts should be permitted to speak for themselves Day after day she stood before a hole in a rock and conversed with the Blessed Virgin Such delusions are a usual symptom of paranoia have many paranoiacs in my clinic who claim visions oftentimes followed by a tendency towards violence Has she been allowed to come and go as she pleases had planned to put her under restraint but Dr Dozous favorable diagnosis made that impossible trust that your examination doctor will not be a cursory one can assure you it will be most extensive It may be necessary to place the child in an institution under observation Unfortunately with paranoiacs observation sometimes takes a long time After all a psychiatrist is not an orthopedic surgeon who can set a broken bone on the spot Yes Yes understand Come in Eyes closed Now the other foot Why are you so unsteady Because am very tired monsieur All right you may sit down now How many hours in the day Twentyfour How many days in the week Seven How much is seven times five Thirtyfive How much is times do not know monsieur Well Would you know the answer monsieur if you hadnt figured it out before Hmm Not so fast young lady Dont bother Shell go directly home We can take her from there Here we are doctor Father Peyramale Have the honor of addressing the dean of Lourdes You have that honor How can serve you Hadnt we better go elsewhere and discuss this matter It is you gentlemen who have chosen this place of action not What do you want m from the medical department of the provincial administration There are evidences of definite anomalies in this girl Bernadette wish to place her under observation am a professor of psychiatry and neurology at the clinic of Tarbes If she does not willingly submit to this examination we will be placed in the unfortunate position of being forced to invoke the law of This is the most shameless piece of hypocrisy have ever encountered warn you shall expose this hypocrisy And shall raise such a voice throughout all France the reverberations will send petty politicians toppling from their seats Come here Bernadette know this child So does the imperial prosecutor She is neither a maniac nor a menace to her fellow men If you still intend to take her gentlemen well and good But rest assured shall not stir from this girls side Now call the police And when the police do come what then When they come shall say to them load well your guns for your path lies over my dead body Well m sorry Come Bernadette Mother Superior has asked me to watch over you m sorry to have caused you this trouble welcome the opportunity of talking to you before leave Lourdes Youre leaving Tomorrow ve been recalled to the motherhouse of our order at Nevers The dean of Lourdes is on his way to speak to the bishop of Tarbes in your behalf want you to know that although youve used your wiles successfully on a great many people there is one person remains who does not believe you That person is myself ve never wanted you to believe me Sister If thats one of those disarming answers of yours that is supposed to strike one silent you need not waste it on me You should be thankful Bernadette you did not live in former times Creatures who boasted of equivocal visions and produce springs as if by magic were burned at the stake have prayed for you night after night and shall continue so that your soul may not be destroyed by the frightful danger to which you are exposing it And now good night Bernadette Good night Sister However above all that come in the cause of justice The authorities are scheming and plotting this girls destruction It is not the practice of the Church to interfere with the authorities and particularly in the case of Bernadette Soubirous we will rigidly adhere to our policy of remaining aloof In my opinion a change in our policy is now necessary That opinion is not shared by an amazing number of equally worthy ecclesiastics realize that also realize that none but myself has talked to this child ve begun to wonder if she isnt a true vessel of grace and a worker of miracles No stop My dear dean only the Congregation of Rites can determine if a given phenomenon is a genuine miracle or a deception True Thats all ask that an Episcopal Commission be set up to investigate Two or three questionable cures are not sufficient to cause an investigation One questionable cure was sufficient to cause a multitude to travel hundreds of miles Very well will convoke such a commission Thank you Providing certain obstacles can be surmounted You fully realize of course just what this will mean The commission can render only one of three decisions First Youre an imposter little Soubirous Hence away with you to a prison for juvenile delinquents Second Youre a madwoman little Soubirous Away with you to an asylum Third You are the rarest of mortal beings little Soubirous Just when do you think the commission will begin its work The scientists the chemists the geologists cant conduct research with the grotto boarded up letter will force them to open it No The emperor must command that the grotto be opened Then the commission may assemble Not the other way around When will you ask the emperor Never ve not the slightest intention of mentioning it He will not know that even contemplate convoking a commission My attitude puzzles you doesnt it Frankly yes am giving your lady a chance to prove herself to me If she is the Blessed Virgin then nothing is impossible for her and she will overcome the emperor However if she is overcome then shes a fraud The grotto will remain boarded up And she and any thought of the commission will vanish into thin air wonder my dear dean who will win The emperor or the lady Stay where you are Youre under arrest Okay go down ll watch them from here Name age occupation Jacques Gozos carpenter Charge Stealing water from Massabielle One franc and costs But havent got it monsieur Two days in jail then Take him away Next case Bruat woman Bruat woman Name age and occupation Bruat Leontine governess Commissioner Bruat Madame are you by any chance related to Admiral Bruat He is my husband am Vital Dutour imperial prosecutor How do you do Wont you come into my office and sit down please was arrested and led through the streets like the rest do not wish to be treated differently now that am here Madame this is most distressing You are the bearer of a great name When ladies of your station exhibit their contempt for the law by breaking it what is the poor civil servant to do Punish them as you would the others Very well require you to pay a fine of one franc and costs Delighted monsieur And here are a hundred more for my fellow criminals who are without funds And now please may have the bottle The bottle is confiscated But dont believe it will remain so monsieur for filled it at the desire of very high personage May ask who this personage is madame Her Majesty the Empress Eugnie have the honor to be the governess of His Highness the prince imperial Take it madame begin to see the folly of being the only one to do ones duty in a feebleminded world His temperature is quite normal now Thank God was right The water is miraculous m sure it is madame Loulou my darling youll be well now my sweet Louis Loulou is better The water from Lourdes made him well Let us say sire the waters did the prince no harm He had only a slight cold His forehead was on fire with fever Never more than two degrees It was diphtheria or scarlet fever know it feel it Please my dearest dont excite yourself Come and sit down Loulou has had a number of attacks like this and hes always gotten well tell you Louis it was the water that saved him Thats a very frivolous observation You do an injustice to the doctors prescriptions Youre an atheist Louis Thats the most stupid thing a sovereign could be Youre worse than an atheist You havent the humility to thank God for the grace hes accorded us By order of His Majesty the emperor the ordinance of May th is hereby revoked and nullified As of this date the grotto shall be opened Signed Louis Napoleon must say my dear dean your lady wastes no time in accepting a challenge The lady has had sweet revenge m being transferred to Alais Perhaps should say demoted to Alais Yes rather expected you would be too received a letter this morning Yeah What hole are you headed for In my case the lady wanted even sweeter revenge am to stay here for a while at least and watch the thing fought against blossom like a fruit tree Its the influenza again can feel it Evidently the lady intends to leave me exactly as she found me Some hot wine Duran Oui monsieur And then ran to the other side and ate of the grass and the herbs as the lady had asked me to cant understand the lady demanding anything so repulsive of you It doesnt fit into the description that you gave of her that she bade you act like an animal Do you act like an animal when you eat salad Go on Then looked for the spring Since couldnt see it supposed the lady meant that it was below the ground So began to scratch and dig with my fingers To be considered a miracle the healing must be as sudden as a bolt of lightning It must be from one moment to the next Further proof is necessary to look for the spring Since could not see it supposed the lady meant that it was below the ground So began to scratch and dig look for the spring Since could not see it supposed the lady meant that it was below the ground There is still the possibility of deception Further proof is necessary The evidence is insufficient Come in Bernadette m sorry to be late but my brother had a frostbitten nose Come by the fire had to rub snow on it March is coming in like a lion isnt it Sit down Bernadette Thank you Father Sorry was unable to attend your sisters wedding Thursday Father Pomian tells me it was lovely Yes we had lots of cakes one with figures on it It was ever so nice suppose shell give up her position with Madame Millet Yes theyre going to live on a farm but Madame Millets going to take me as housemaid So heard today Thats why wanted to talk to you Oh its not hard work and the pay is good You know its strange Your Reverence The lady once told me could never be happy in this world but am Happier than ve ever been ve got a position and And Monsieur Antoine is a splendid young man Bernadette have you any idea of what the bishops commission has been doing The gentlemen have examined and tested all the people who have been cured Thats true What of yourself Dont you think that you and your case are part of their task also ve answered all the gentlemens questions hope they wont ask me anymore The commission is now engaged in writing a very important report about you It admits the possibility that you were chosen by the powers above and that your hand alone brought forth the spring responsible for miraculous cures Dont you understand what that means No It means that the greatest and the wisest men in the Church will be watching you for decades and then perhaps long after the rest of us are dead and thought of no more you will But thats dreadful dont want it It cant be Its no small matter No no No Tell me arent the Sisters in the hospital and in the school good and kind Yes Yes they are Theyre very sweet Could you imagine yourself as one of them someday Dear God no Thats far above me just want to go and work for Madame Millet as housemaid Please My dear child To you the Most Blessed Virgin condescended This places a responsibility on you You cant suddenly play truant run away from your destiny as though it were school and become an old widows servant long time ago told you you were playing with fire Bernadette Your lady was heavenly fire Heaven chose you and now theres nothing left for you but to choose heaven Isnt that true Yes Youll like the life with the Sisters at Nevers Their order is beautiful and lofty and very much involved in practical life Everything you have said is true Your Reverence and will do exactly as you say But Youre worried about your family You neednt You may stay with them until summer Itll take that long before the report is fully complete and ve arranged for your father to be established in the mill There he can practice the trade for which he was meant and your family can live without fear of poverty No no no no Bernadette Just one moment ve something more to say Although as a member of the commission shouldnt say it Now mind you have full faith in you but theres always been one detail which never could help but doubt Its the words Immaculate Conception If you could ever admit that this phrase was not spoken by the lady things might be very different If you could retract this single incident then there might be somewhere in this world a little corner where you could hide and lead a normal life Would you like a little time to think it over dont need time Your Reverence because have never lied to you Did speak of lying And dont want a little corner to hide in Good day Your Reverence Bernadette May the patron saint of travelers watch over you Thank you Thats what we gave her Two will make my journey doubly safe Go along Junior Go along Go on Junior dont

ever you should need me just send me this shall understand and come immediately Your Reverence if only you knew how much this means to me Goodbye Goodbye Bernadette and God bless you For you mademoiselle Monsieur they are so beautiful didnt come to say goodbye with the others because there was something wanted to tell you What was it Monsieur Antoine Well wanted to say Well my mother is

unmarried too Well thats what wanted to say to you And now wish you luck on your journey Bernadette Goodbye Antoine You are the postulant from Lourdes Yes Mother Superior What is your name Soubirous Bernadette Soubirous How old are you Just past What can you do Oh Nothing that amounts to much In the world what would you like to have been always thought could have been a good servant girl Is that you Sister Marie Therese Yes Mother Superior This is the mistress of the novices Look to her for guidance This is Bernadette Soubirous a new postulant We know each other The postulant will start in the kitchen tomorrow You will be asked to wash dishes scrub floors sweep corridors In brief do all the lowly tasks that need to be done But please observe do not command you am merely proposing this If you do not feel equal to it or if it is repellent to you physically or spiritually wish you would say so now Oh no Mother Superior m very happy to work in the kitchen Good Sister Marie Therese will show you to your cell With your permission there is one other matter to be considered The postulant bears a name which has made a great noise in the world But among us great names have no meaning although they may have been acquired through far greater effort We disassociate ourselves from all we have meant to the world and all it has meant to us Moreover the name Bernadette is a childish and trivial diminutive Quite right Before actually entering upon your novitiate you will want to choose another name Under the circumstances it would be best to do so now Have you given the matter any thought No havent What was your godmothers name Bernarde Then surely youll be happy to bear the name of Marie Bernarde my child This way Marie Bernarde This cell is not to your liking Marie Bernarde Yes Sister it is quite to my liking You will learn to be comfortable in it convent is no prison No force is exercised here If you do not feel capable of our obedience you will find the door is always open Good night Marie Bernarde Good night Sister Marie Bernarde Yes Sister What are you thinking about About my family Worldly remembrances have no place in this house Were here for the purpose of concentration Not for reverie and woolgathering Yes Sister You find this work repellent Oh no Sister Then lets show our willingness to serve God and not hesitate in our tasks Yes Sister Sister Marie Bernarde is limping Yes ve noticed it m afraid it is a worldly desire to become the center of attention shall speak to her Sister Marie Bernarde Come here please Yes Sister wish to speak with you Certainly Sister Would you have me finish prayers first What have to say is just as important for your soul We will speak in your cell Yes Sister Excuse me Mother Superior Sit down Marie Bernarde ve been wanting to talk to you for a long time Why do you limp Oh its nothing Sister Limping gains sympathy from the other Sisters Is that it But never You forget ve known you for many years In the outside world you were celebrated From all over France people came just to gaze upon you Here you are a nonentity You find that difficult dont you Oh no The temptation to cling to your eminence is undoubtedly too strong for you Truly Sister never have said or done anything to attract attention wish only to be one of the Sisters here nothing more Ten years ago was forced to doubt you have not changed have never told you an untruth have tried to believe you Only God knows how hard ve tried but cannot What is it you dont believe What everyone else is willing to believe The lady did see her did Many agree with you even the Holy Father in Rome but do not cannot What do you know of suffering Nothing In all our sacred history the chosen ones have always been those who have suffered Why then should God choose you Why not me cannot answer that know what it is to suffer Look at my eyes They burn like the very fires of hell Why Because they need sleep They need rest which will not give them My throat is parched from constant prayer My hands are gnarled from serving God in humiliation My body is painracked from stone floors Yes have suffered because know it is the only true road to heaven And if who have tortured myself cannot glimpse the Blessed Virgin how can you who have never felt pain dare to say youve seen her dont know why was chosen You are a hundred times more worthy If only could find evidence If only you could give me some proof maybe then could believe Maybe then these monsters of doubt and hate would stop consuming my very soul For the love of God Sister give me some proof wish could help you But have never suffered ve never Perhaps can help you It may be there is proof for you Well doctor Well in addition to the large tumor on the knee she has tuberculosis of the bone She has never complained of pain No Has she She never mentioned it cant understand it Shes had this affliction for a long time The constant pain and suffering which is so characteristic of this disease is too horrible to describe Oh God have tried to storm the gates of heaven by sacrificing myself know now that we must be chosen that we must be graced as you have graced this child God forgive me ve persecuted her and did not believe her because was filled with hate and envy God help me to serve this chosen soul for the rest of my days God help me God help me You seem a trifle stronger today Sister Yes thank you Mother Superior am Sister Marie Therese and have been discussing the possibility of your taking a trip Trip We could make the journey to our convent at Lourdes in easy stages Lourdes Should not you of all people take advantage of the benefit thats come to the whole world through you That cannot be done And why not The spring is not for me Why should not the spring work in your case of all cases Sister The spring is not for me Did the lady tell you that my child She said cannot promise you happiness in this world Only in the next The spring is not for me Thank you doctor In that case Father we must notify the bishop immediately He wants to hear from Marie Bernardes lips a final confirmation Sister Marie Bernarde we shall read to you the final protocol of the Commission of Investigation assembled in It contains a record of all the testimony which you offered at the time We ask nothing of you except that you confirm that testimony Do you feel equal to that Yes On February th in the year of our Lord Bernadette Soubirous was sent in the company of my sister Marie and my friend Jeanne Abadie to fetch firewood in the forest Do you confirm this did see her At a location known as Massabielle rested while my sister and friend crossed the River Gave Do you confirm this did see her For a time nothing happened and then suddenly noticed did see her the grotto was shaking thought this strange did see her did see her did see her Youre not sorry you came back to visit us No For five years ve been stationed in Languedoc a stinking hole if ever there was one Now that see this realize what a paradise ve been living in You see my friend how deeply hell reaches into human life Poor ignorant sheep Why do they come Because they have faith Because theyre desperate Because occasionally someone is cured And because some hypochondriac due to emotional excitement forgets a malady that never existed Oh yes we have hundreds of those But we have many many other cases that arent so easy to explain Yesterday there was a woman with lupus tuberculosis of the face Suddenly she discovered a nose and a mouth where only minutes before there was nothing but one large decaying cavity Please doctor m not a gullible sheepherder from the Pyrenees We have pictures in the office Would you care to see Gentlemen whats the use This same argument has been going on for a great many years and m afraid will go on for a great many more To those who believe in God no explanation is necessary To those who do not no explanation will suffice Your Reverence Adolar message Your housekeeper thought it was important and asked me to bring it Thank you This is the first You remember him the Bouhouhorts child Is that all Your Reverence Yes thank you Adolar Have the doctor give you something for that cold No Its just a little laryngitis picked up from the drafty train last night It will be gone by tomorrow Excuse me gentlemen Good day Good day dean And give you full permission dear doctor to write down in your big book that my amazing recovery was due solely to the Lady of Lourdes If kept such a book would write you down merely as a skeptic who promise will leave Lourdes at least wondering Not doctor Not This place only succeeds in revolting me Once it was a dull but pleasing little village Now look at it tremendous sponge sopping up the infection of the world Good morning Monsieur Jones Morning Dr Dozous Gentlemen Good day monsieur You look better today Yes doctor think feel much better today thank you Monsieur Jones voice has a lot in common with Monsieur Dutours Dont you think Yes now that you mention it Monsieur Jones has cancer of the larynx Holy Mary Pray for us Mother of God Pray for us Holy Virgin of virgins Pray for us Mother of Christ Pray for us Mother of divine grace Pray for us Mother most pure am a stranger here am not like these thousands of souls flickering brightly and hopefully in the darkness My pride has always stood between them and me The pride of being a superior human being But now know that we are all a wretched animal species distinguished from the insects only by nerve centers and false reasoning hungry cancer is feeding at my throat Tomorrow ll crawl back to Languedoc hide in some hole of death and be heard of no more ll be alone alone and desolate And why not Its logical ll be alone because have loved no one no one and nothing not even myself Nothing Nothing Queen of Apostles Pray for us Queen of Martyrs Pray for us Queen of All Saints Pray for me Bernadette Your Reverence
