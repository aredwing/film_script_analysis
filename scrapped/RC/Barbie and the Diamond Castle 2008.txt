song is sung anywhere in the world a diamond appears on the walls lived there with Dori Phaedra and Lydia The three Muses of music They took care of the Diamond Castle and studied as their apprentice They were all friends playing different kinds of music but Lydia wanted to be the one and only Muse What happened Dori and Phaedra believed music was for everyone Lydia was furious and vowed to get the Diamond Castle for herself She found an ancient cave filled with magic and transformed her flute into an instrument of dark magic With her new powers she came back for the Diamond Castle to spread her darkness everywhere The Muses hid their musical instruments along with the castle and gave me the key in case anything should happen to them The Muses tried to reason with Lydia but she just turned on them ran and ran but Slyder was chasing me And then saw my only chance hid But dropped my whistle and Slyder broke it trapping me in the mirror was so afraid never said a word until met you two And now look ve ruined everything But if you have the key Do you know where the Diamond Castles hidden Yes near the Seven Stones far to the west Can Lydia be stopped hope so think if play the Muses instruments can break her spells No No Liana weve never been farther away than the village Melody what happens if Lydia destroys the Muses instruments She wins She has it all Our world will be
