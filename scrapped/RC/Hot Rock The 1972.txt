your old pal Kelp Ah So how was it this time Not bad learned plumbing Man of your talents cant be a plumber You dont have to worry yourself about my talents m not doin any more jobs with you Who mentioned a job You mean you dont think its possible came out of friendship Look happen to be married to your sister and we both happen to care for you And if you think thats easy youre wrong because youre a very abrasive fellow Most people cant stand you Am right Youre still as fascinating as ever took a hell of a risk stealing this car so youd have a little comfort to ease you back into society Why does that entitle me to abuse Its terrific m sorry Dont apologize unless you mean it mean it Really Really Okay good believe you So now let me tell you a few things about the job Well dont think so know you When you say no you mean yes Say youll at least meet the doctor okay Hes the moneyman m not being pushy but wheres the harm seeing if you like each other Youre not being pushy m just edging you towards making a decision Theres a difference Theres a difference Theres six ways of lookin at this You could look at this in different ways m just sayin lets take two ways to look at it that way Now listen didnt tell the doctor about you being in prison figure why undermine his confidence He wants the best for his money Not that youre not the best But a layman might wonder why youre all the time in jail Someday the schoolbooks of my country will sing your praises dont think we want this nosed around do we Doctor was taking poetic license Our literacy rate in Central Vatawi is percent The point is my entire country will be in your debt for returning the Sahara Stone to its rightful people This is him am the permanent representative of Central Vatawi at the United Nations Some job of explaining you did You may call me Doctor Amusa Mr Dortmunder You see the countries of Central and Outer Vatawi have been stealing the Sahara Stone from one another for generations We like to think it was originally ours The whole matter at present is being studied by the United Nations Being a member of that body of course have complete faith in the wisdom of their eventual decision But as you Americans might say in case they blow it d feel more secure with the jewel in my possession which is why naturally enough we are here Mr Dortmunder is not entirely committed yet Doctor wont pay a penny more than a man didnt ask for any more It comes to a total of exactly Four men If you need five youll each take less What if we can do it with three That will still be wouldnt want to encourage greed Theres no greed around here Doctor Were all men of goodwill If werent a man of goodwill might think that some of us lied about the prison records of others of us As it is know it was only an oversight The doctor is uh a most understanding employer How much help are you good for What kind of help Vehicles weapons whatevers needed Oh matriel of course And expenses Expenses Come on little birdies and get your supper What Come on Come on dears and get your supper Come on Near the bench Here You come on Get it Come and get it dearies Come and get it He means expenses to live on Doctor Planning something like this could take weeks Oh the sweet little Oh you mean an advance on your No thats not what mean m sure something can be arranged What mean is expenses in addition to the mean per diem mean whatever is needed in order m sorry ItsIts not possible Goodbye Doctor the man is fresh out of prison Hows he supposed to eat Hows he supposed to keep body and soul together Doctor All right All right Eat your supper tell ya ll let you have a week Seventyfive Seventyfive Do you realize what the cost of living is in this town Cheap couldnt work for it How can you insult the man with an offer like that Offer him can make him take Yes Right am You want the stone youll say You say it for me ll tell you something you are the poorest birds ve ever seen Hey Hey Amusa thinks youre a fabulous guy Hes apologetic as hell Hes happy to go The reason he said was because he got confused He started thinking in Africa money You hear Hell go Thats a good deal It is Its good and its bad Theres a guaranteed return and thats good But the guarantor is Amusa and Amusas a rookie and thats bad But its an easily transportable object and thats good Only its in a rotten position in the museum and thats bad And the glass over the stone thats bad too because thats glass with metal mixed in it Bullet proof Shatter proof But the locks dont look impossible three maybe five tumblers But theres no alarm system and thats the worst because that means no ones going to get lazy watching knowing the alarm will pick up their mistakes which means the whole thing has got to be a diversion job And thats good and thats bad because if the diversions too big itll draw pedestrians And if the diversions not big enough it wont draw that watchman Dortmunder dont know where the hell you are or what the hell youre sayin Just tell me will you plan the job Its what do Well my God youve expanded Cant beat the panic business in this town Every time the Daily News has a scare headline people go bananas Hi

positive Shall we get right down to cases gentlemen m sure you have more important things to do know have Youre Greenbergs lawyer My card My client is innocent No court could convince me otherwise Unfortunately the fact that my client was captured the night of the robbery traipsing around a museum in a guards uniform might seem to an uninformed juror slightly more than circumstantial evidence Therefore am following my clients instructions and m doing what has to be done to expedite his release from prison What about the stone My client informs me that he got away with it And if you spring him he will turn it over to you with gratitude and appreciation If you wont he will hand it over to the authorities in exchange for lightening his sentence If seem less than enchanted with all of you
