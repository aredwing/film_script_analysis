floor Why so it is was certain sir d placed it on the shelf This excitement tonight you understand Yes understand perfectly Good night Roberts Good night Dr Clitterhouse These anterior and posterior views of the laminae are not quite satisfactory You agree on the necessity of an operation tonight doctor Possibly Suppose we hurry through a stereo Miss Donner You stop taking pictures and begin straightening me out Relax counselor Nothing to be jittery about ve had over a hundred clients face the electric chair ve never been jittery But your clients were What are you up to now anyway

with an elliptical incision here Oh Clitterhouse do you have to cut that much ll have these developed in minutes Miss Randolph Are you or are you not going to operate on me Seems to me the vertebrae are at a much greater depth than one would expect The reason prefer an elliptical incision To delay surgery may result in permanent paralysis Oh Miss Randolph What are you doing Arent you getting my glasses Yes indeed have them right here m sorry if you had any difficulty finding them Not at all doctor Only your bag was unusually full Could interrupt that big medical conference to ask for a cigarette Yes by all means Miss Randolph youll find some in my coat Now flat on your tummy counselor There Here are the stereo views Dr Clitterhouse Theyre very clear Thanks Ah heres what we need Dr Ames Mr Grant wont you please lie down and relax Relax In the midst of this threering circus Miss Randolph Yes doctor Give him a spinal anesthetic all the trimmings ll be ready for him in the operating room in minutes Oh nurse Yes doctor You wont forget to keep an eye on my bag Its impertinent of me but shouldnt these jewels be kept in a secure place They were in a secure place until took them out That seems to be a fairly accurate account The jewels were insured for over a hundred thousand dollars Quite a haul Yes indeed quite a haul One diamond platinum necklace one diamond and sapphire brooch one set of pearl earrings two diamond rings dont remember two diamond rings Doctor these jewels arent the same as this list Would you mind reading that while make an inventory You cant mean you actually stole these jewels They are the proceeds of Let me see Richardson Sutherland Challing Updyke My fourth burglary You a burglar Well not professionally And never from any of my own patients That would be taking an unsporting advantage But theyll put you in prison for years Oh that reminds me Edward drive by Inspector Lanes office Inspector Lane Police headquarters But why On the theory that the best defense is a bold attack Would you mind reading that list please m not interested in longwinded explanations Give me some action want results Youll have them Inspector you said that when Challings place was robbed Challing is a prominent man He wasnt insured and hes raising the roof Its lucky the Updykes stuff was insured Never mind that want this solved Cant depend upon anyone around here was just looking for you You were looking for me Stop it and get busy on the Updyke job cant depend on a soul around here only wanted to explain m not interested in explanations Give me some results Make some arrests want action Hi captain Hey whatre you doing here Why arent you working on that Updyke suspect Cant depend on anybody Give me some action lieutenant Why doctor Miss Randolph What are you doing here was worried about you How are you feeling couldnt feel worse How is Grant got him straightened out now You know envy Grant resting there in that nice peaceful hospital No commissioners tearing their hair No unsolved crimes No crooks lying to you or laughing at you But ll be there soon doc unless m in a padded cell first had an idea d find you a bundle of nerves Thats why came by It wouldnt be so bad if could get a decent nights rest Well well take a look at you Oh Miss Randolph Yes doctor Tell me how did things turn out at the Updykes Anything new No dont believe that monkey ever had the jewels Really Either he had a partner who got away or this story about somebody else getting there first is true An early bird who caught his worm Right And that same bird is probably responsible for this entire series of burglaries And how many were there inspector Four last month and all the same style Oh you recognize the style Oh certainly Thats easy This crook does his job at certain intervals Hell do another in a few days Look here had him down for tonight and he came through Well thats very interesting You knew when Oh surely But you didnt know where No Thats right He sounds rather clever Clever Hes a rank amateur Amateur Why certainly On this Challing job he climbed ladders went over roofs picked a lock But the library window the room he wanted to get into was wide open Well nevertheless this uh rank amateur has kept you crime experts guessing for over a month should think that the terms amateur and crime expert might very well be reversed Now doc youre gonna start that scientific approach again No m afraid its uh too late But someday hope to be able to convince you with evidence And has this burglar taken very much inspector Quite a bit and hes holding onto it plenty tight Well how can you know that Weve checked the fences He hasnt tried to sell yet Fence Oh do you mean receiver Fence receiver stop its all the same racket Somebody who buys hot stuff Weve got them all covered Sooner or later this amateur is gonna peddle his stuff And well drop on him like a load of bricks The crook would be doublecrossed by the fence Sure fence wouldnt take a chance on a crook he doesnt know Might figure him to be a stool pigeon Perhaps there are fences he could trust No know them all From Benny the Gouge to Jo Keller the biggest of them all Jo Keller Thats very interesting Oh tell me inspector how does a criminal get in touch with a fence Through other criminals Supposing he doesnt know any mean this is just as a matter of curiosity but where do fences hang out Everywhere Jewelry shops drugstores nightclubs Now this Jo Keller owns a hotel Excuse me Hello Inspector Yes Sergeant Davis reporting Yeah That guy down at the hospital is ready to talk now Says he can identify the fellow who was at the safe when he climbed in the window Thats fine ll be right down sergeant Looks as though were getting somewhere Have you finished with me doctor Why yes yes inspector Heres a prescription for sleeping tablets Thank you If we can get our hand on those jewels wont need any tablets Do you mind Why certainly Show Dr Clitterhouse to his car Yes sir Oh doctor Yes You forgot your bag didnt you Oh yes left it on the table ll get it Yes sir If we could only get our hands on those jewels Mustnt forget your bag of tricks doc Quite right No tricks no doctor Thats right Thanks for dropping in Youre welcome inspector Good night Good night By the way would you mind letting me know whom your prisoner identifies Not at all But why No reason except scientific curiosity All right ll phone you This way please Thank you The next time were escorted by an officer well probably both be wearing handcuffs blood pressure on yourself Yes Unfortunate that interruption in Mrs Updykes boudoir would have been a perfect moment for a blood pressure during the robbery cant get over it You deliberately committing a robbery Four Four perfect crimes in four weeks And the inspector calls me an amateur What can you possibly want that jewelry for dont want it Frankly its a nuisance But for some time now ve been profoundly interested in crime and criminals The jewelry is sort of a byproduct Then youre experimenting with criminals doctor m being one Inspector Lane believes the only way to prevent crime is to catch the crook and put him away behind bars My theory is you must start long before that Start psychologically No Now listen carefully Miss Randolph Has it occurred to you why criminal activity should change a mans entire personality m afraid ve never thought about anything like that ve been thinking about it for a long time now m planning a book on the medical aspects of crime Showing how the criminals life produces such extreme nervous tension that it changes his entire mental and physical makeup m convinced that there are medical reasons for these changes Changes which manifest themselves in the blood pressure in the ratio of the blood corpuscles in the heightened activity of the nerves and the glands Do you understand want to analyze scientifically the precise nature of these changes But can do it only by studying criminals while theyre at work not after theyve been put away behind bars Proper subjects for such research are naturally difficult to find So of necessity began these experiments on myself planned a series of burglaries and went through with them As accurately as could observed my own reactions pulse respiration blood pressure Well precisely as m doing now Oh and incidentally nurse find it very fascinating But doctor have you considered the horrible risk youre running If my book can help criminologists deal intelligently with the problem of crime in this country isnt it worth some risk If accomplish my purpose believe ll be making a contribution to society worth whatever personal risk it may entail Do you understand nurse Yes doctor Oh just a moment Miss Randolph Weve been associated for almost five years now Yes doctor Youve been an invaluable assistant However if you feel you cannot continue under the circumstances that youd much rather leave me Dr Clitterhouse wouldnt think of leaving you no matter what you d mean under any circumstances Very well then Good night nurse Good night Doctor tell me Have you been thinking about this very long For quite some time now Isnt it possible you have it in the wrong perspective Are you hinting that have some slight uh mental aberration You have been overworking know precisely what m doing Valuable research work in a rather unusual form Crime and Research Not a bad title for my book when its done Good night doctor Oh Miss Randolph Yes Were you thinking of telephoning Professor Ludwig in the morning telephone the professor What makes you think that Well we called him in when old Mr Carlyle began to behave peculiarly Didnt we Dont do it This is a professional matter And a very confidential one Naturally you can depend on me Hello Oh yes inspector You got your prisoner to talk Who He identified me Oh hes quite certain that it was my voice he heard Well perhaps it was inspector Whats that No dont think two tablets will hurt you Youll sleep like an innocent lamb Good night inspector What are you doing m looking for a sleeping tablet For me No For myself Nobody knows m telling you no ones registered by that name But Mr Keller owns this hotel Mister someone gave you a wrong steer Hey you Wanna see somebody Mr Keller Mr Keller huh And whats your business Well m not at liberty to divulge This gent wants to see Mr Keller Whats the gents name He didnt say Well Mr Keller dont live here anymore see But he must have left quite suddenly Yeah and so will you Say Milton didnt send you

that our work tonight will be extremely dangerous But can be accomplished successfully by perfect timing selfcontrol and following the schedule to the letter Above all never permit yourselves to yield

Only might point out old man that youve fallen somewhat in my esteem Oh yeah Yes gave you credit for being much more talented than you evidently are Really that attempt of yours to kill me by

asleep m not in any particular hurry m not either Professor listen You once told me that sometimes people know things about each other without really finding out the facts What do you know That mean something to you You mean a great deal to me In fact Yes Well thats one of my reasons for leaving The danger of losing my objectivity But there are other reasons too You wont understand fully but tonight during the entire robbery felt myself beginning to enjoy crime For its own sake You know it was something like the effects of champagne high heady reaction a strange exhilaration And cant risk subjecting myself to too much champagne Its way over my head Will you Will hear from you soon at the hotel Its very doubtful Well goodbye professor Goodbye What are you doing Rocks Some of that research of my own Maybe dont know nothing about blood tests but any guy smart enough to open a combo safe by touch can figure out a gadget to catch a phone number See fitted this little piece of pencil lead under the dial and when your professor spun it it went around with the dial and made a mark each time used this little jigger to click it over a notch with every turn And it worked Now got seven marks side by side All gotta do is sort of translate them Pretty nice of your professor to scratch his own number for me He expected more of me huh Hes gonna get it Dont start nothing you cant

Them blood tests believe told you Crime and research Come on down to Earth Talk English Those are my medical notes Get away from them Medical notes What for For an exhaustive scientific work on criminology All about them jobs we pulled Yes Theyre covered extensively Suppose the cops get hold of this book Its very unlikely They will when you finish it When its printed Some of the more intelligent police will trust Its my hope they will be grateful to me Yeah for giving them the lowdown on us You got enough stuff in here to hang us Look at this Blood analysis of Tug during perfume robbery showed activity of adrenal glands to a surprising degree Any dick can figure out what that means You got enough stuff in here to send us up for life Pupils of Rocks eyes exhibited slow

doc Yes because find that have some more research to do ve just realized that my book would hardly have been complete Although ve secured data on various types of criminal activity ve overlooked a major interest The reactions associated with the greatest crime of all The greatest crime of all Whats that Why homicide naturally Hey thats bad business doc You cant get away with it not murder medical man has knowledge and opportunity denied to most people Not at all difficult Ah forget about it doc We dont have to give nobody the works We got a m getting sleepy ve been up now most of two nights running ve thought it all out First render the victim unconscious but dont altogether end his existence until youre quite ready to dispose of the body Why Why not Too dangerous Not at all clever Whereas if keep him alive Just knocked out huh Exactly And then dispose of him in some body of water any river thats convenient Then the coroners verdict would be simply death by drowning Boy

weeks ago He stayed at your hotel You dont saw him in the lobby a couple of times dont know Not to speak to Who had it in for Rocks The police Well guess the department wont miss him much But weve got to follow up all clues Are there any One or two This number for instance We found it in the vest pocket Who would Rocks be calling on the PlazaFour exchange How should know didnt think you would but thought d inquire before proceeding It mightnt have any connection with the crime Probably not and then again it might Yes inspector Get me PlazaFour six No use calling that number inspector No use How do you know Because know who killed Rocks Hold it Well now were getting some place Well did it You did it What about Butch Is he in on it Not Butch or anybody all by myself without any help You

Take it easy Oh Inspector Lane Hello Miss Randolph How are you Is the doctor in Yes he is ll tell him youre here Dr Clitterhouse Inspector Lane to see you Ask him in please Come right in inspector Thank you Is everything under control Yes Thats good Oh inspector delighted to see you m glad to see you ve got a headache How long have you had it Since this morning gangster murder case gave it to me Murder case Any clues Plenty We found the telephone number of a very distinguished gentleman on the gangsters body Seems rather incredible doesnt it Yes hope were wrong Yes Well in any event can give you something for your headache Fine Whats good for it It all depends what kind of headache it is the cause Hows paradol Paradol chloride isnt effective for headaches if thats what you mean Whats it used for Well chiefly insomnia in minute doses Its a sedative And a poison Got any Why certainly Every doctor has May see it Its practically odorless and tasteless Yet an overdose causes death Yes suppose it does Excuse me Police headquarters is on the wire for you Inspector Lane Thank you Might use the telephone Yes Thank you doctor Yes Yes Well all you can do is keep working on Butch Telephone me here when he spills if he spills and think he will No let her alone You cant do anything with her Telephone me here ll be waiting Now doctor to get back to this case All we lack is the motive and well have that as soon as this fellow spills So theres a woman in the case too eh And a third party think its only a matter of a few minutes before we arrest him see Yes Mr Grant is here Grant Just a moment ll wait for my call outside But your headache Well strangely enough thats almost gone ll tell Grant to come in Shall Please Thank you Hope m not disturbing you Clitterhouse Oh no Not at all Grant To the contrary you dont know how happy am to see you How are you feeling Great But this is only a social call dropped in to ask if youd like to have dinner this evening m afraid this evening seems doubtful Oh sorry Soon then hope so Oh by the way want your opinion on a matter Oh very well friend of mine a very close friend of mine has gotten himself into a jab You understand this is confidential You kept in touch with Dr Clitterhouse the whole time he was in Europe Yes inspector Where did you cable him Well dont recall the addresses but well all over Europe Did you keep the cables No destroyed them Why do you ask inspector Only a matter of curiosity was wondering how a doctor kept in touch with his cases while he was away Hello Its for you inspector Oh thank you Yeah Yeah Thats what couldnt figure out and hope Butch would tell us the connection What didnt wanna make the arrest without that He hung around with Rocks mob for some time Can you imagine that Put it on the teletype and pick up every member of the gang What happened to the proceeds of these robberies The crooks had their share My friend gave all of his away to charity anonymously His object was research you see No dont know that do see quite suppose this has got rather beyond him is that it Yes He kept his identity secret Then one of the crooks discovered it and tried to blackmail him That was inevitable My friends notes were practically complete He didnt want to go on Only this man tried to force him to continue And did he But he suddenly realized that he lacked the chapter on the ultimate crime Not murder Yes And he has In fact he was obliged to You mean he removed the blackmailer Yes Yes he would of course Why do you say that Never mind Go on Well thats all Except that hes afraid the police will be after him Yes Grant They will you know Why do you say that Because that kind of man would make mistakes fatal errors Hed miss things How can you be so sure of that His every thought and action would be focused on the end and not on the means to it No He would be intent solely upon his idea So obsessed that he could commit murder Yes but his hand was forced Clitterhouse are you stating a hypothetical case or has all this actually happened Assume that it has happened Well If it were discovered what would his chances for acquittal be It isnt a matter of chances at all Isnt it With the plan of defense d use hed get off inevitably What Why Because the fellows as mad as a hatter Mad Its obvious You could get him off Youre certain As am of my own name d stake my professional reputation on it Yes but hes not mad Grant He may not go around with straws in his hair but he isnt sane Therefore not legally responsible What about his book Would that be considered Your friends book might be quite coherent and perfectly sensible He probably writes talks looks and acts like anybody else Just like you and me Yes In the course of your medical experience youve probably run across such persons perfectly sane except on the subject of their monomania And a monomaniac is legally insane Well this one is if the facts youve given me are correct dont want to suggest any breach of confidence but does it happen to be anyone know Yes you do know him Indeed Who Me Inspector Lane would like to come in Dr Clitterhouse m awfully sorry doctor You neednt be old man Theres nothing to be upset about Everythings quite all right Isnt it Grant Of course wouldnt say very much if were you Would you mind taking care of this What is it All my research notes Miss Randolph Yes doctor You dont really think that m uh You know do you Of course not doctor Be honest now Youve been overworking thats all Youll be all right in a little while Oh Grant may retain you to represent me Why naturally And youll insist that m not quite You may be sure ll insist on whatever may be best under the circumstances Splendid Very well inspector at your service Oh Grant you wont forget that your professional reputation is at stake shall be very upset if you lose it But of course we are not dealing with relatively simple psychiatric pathology such as uh manicdepressive psychosis involution melancholia or any other elementary psychosis Exactly what are we dealing with Professor Ludwig Thats what should like to determine So should sir Which is my reason for explaining so carefully WundtFarbhalfs theory of the symptoms of hyperamnesia and the hypnagogic state Well do such hypnagogic states have any bearing on this case Perhaps but perhaps not We must realize that psychiatry is still far from an exact science In fact such solid authorities as Gerhardie Pendugast and Picard have characterized the entire WundtFarbhalf theory as sheer nonsense Professor Ludwig m sorry to confess that dont know what youre talking about and havent known for the past hour Naturally dont believe there are more than six men in the world capable of understanding the WundtFarbhalf theories Are you telling us that the prisoner was or was not insane at the time of committing the crime Your Honor m telling you as clearly as possible that sufficient glandular and nervous imbalance may have occurred to justify an hypothesis of pseudoschizophrenic tendencies And then again it may not have Thank you Thank you so much Professor Ludwig Not at all Your Honor All right All right Quiet Quiet all this babble This has been going on for hours and cant stand much more Now was he or wasnt he How many of you still think he was insane do One two three four five six All right all those counted come over at this side of the table The rest of you still think he was sane Yes Hes sane All right You five come over at this side of the table Thats it Fine Now now think were getting some place vote that he was He uh Oh dont know Didnt tell you The man is sane Wouldnt it be a good idea if we recall the prisoner and asked him a few questions dont care what you do This is driving me crazy Thats a good idea Question number three Were you or were you not in full realization of the consequences of your actions object to the defendant answering He is prejudiced in his own behalf Objection overruled The defendant will please answer Certainly was aware of the consequences of my actions but not of the extent and the farreaching possibility of those consequences Your Honor may clarify this entire problem Yes Mr Grant Dr Clitterhouse as regards Rocks Valentine do you remember distinctly the processes of thought which made you determine to do away with him But certainly and granting my premise would say that my logic was perfect Yeah but Dr Clitterhouse you heard Miss Kellers testimony to the contrary Yes and m sincerely grateful to her for testifying on my behalf In fact her unfailing kindness and concern for me have put me eternally in her debt Nevertheless must repeat that my logic was perfect Your Honor could we have a short recess m sorry but thats impossible But Your Honor That will be all Mr Grant Question number four Dr Clitterhouse as a competent medical authority do you believe it possible for an insane man to write a sane book Emphatically not Then you admit that your book is irrational and of no scientific value admit nothing of the sort My book is completely rational and of definite scientific value Youre positive about that Of course am Say what you please about me Do anything to me the law allows But you cannot you must not question the sanity of my book Thank you Dr Clitterhouse And so Dr Clitterhouse assuming that it is impossible for an insane man to write a sane book in your own opinion you are perfectly sane Yes Your Honor Perfectly object object Your Honor Both to the question and the answer Order Order Order Order Order Order Order Order Your Honor Order Your Honor Your Honor Order Weve reached a verdict What is the verdict Not guilty on ground of insanity How on Earth did you ever reach such a verdict Well Your Honor the prisoners only hope lies in proving himself insane when he committed the crime In fact his life depends on it But there he sits doing his best to prove himself sane then and now Only an insane man would do that so he must have been and still is sane mean uh insane Unsa Well he is Its easy The court orders the defendant remanded for examination by the State Lunacy Commission Clear this court Clear this court Clear this court He fainted doctor doctor doctor doctor Clear this court Is there a doctor in the courtroom Is there a doctor in the courtroom Amazing Clear this court Really amazing Clear this court Clear the court
