Lincoln well hang em Lets get em now Burn the traitors Burn em Go Grab em Gentlemen Mr Erickson the assistant secretary of war Good morning gentlemen suppose you all realize that as members of the courtmartial for the trial of the conspirators in the assassination of our beloved president you have on your souls a grave responsibility We realize it very deeply Mr Secretary The object of this trial is not to determine the guilt or innocence of a handful of rebels but to save this country from further bloodshed The solemn truth gentlemen is that the federal union is on the verge of hysteria That is why the trial of these conspirators has been placed in your hands rather than in a civil court because men of the sword can be hard and hardness is all that can save this country from riots mob rule even a resumption of the war itself Have you any suggestions sir Two to help you to be hard First you must not allow your judgment and decision in this case to be troubled by any trifling technicalities of the law or any pedantic regard for the customary rules of evidence Second and most important you must not allow yourself to be influenced by that obnoxious creation of legal nonsense reasonable doubt Is that clear Yes its clear Briefly the voice of this court has got to be the voice of the people Before you start want you to hear that voice Listen to it Bring the prisoners Prisoners to the bar This court is now in session Mr President The Judge Advocate General The death of John Wilkes Booth who was shot down while resisting arrest in Virginia has left us eight members of his criminal band So in the name of the government of the United States the crime of assassination and conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln thenpresident of the United States is charged against the following David Herold Lewis Payne George Atzerodt Michael Laughlin Edward Spangler Samuel Arnold Mrs Mary Surratt And Dr Samuel Mudd Dr Mudd m General Ewing With your permission should like to act as your counsel Thank you General Thank you Well fight together now as we once fought each other With the permission of the court we will begin the cases in order We will start with the charge against George Atzerodt Uh But isnt there any kind of news you can give us about about Dr Mudd Thats all theyre gonna tell lady just what you see on the board Thats War Departments orders War Departments orders Ha Didnt know they had one Shh Well the dadblamed Good night Sam darling The government will now present its case against Dr Samuel Mudd Tell them ve got to speak ve gotta defend myself cant let them treat me the way theyve treated all these others General Ewing You will instruct the defendant to remain silent and respect this court m confident Mr Erickson that after observing the conduct of these trials Dr Mudds respect for this court is every whit as great as my own Frank Thomas will take the stand Tell the court what you know of Dr Mudds loyalty to the federal union Dr Mudd was a dyedinthewool slaver Yes sir Slaver Dr Mudds name was on the prescription which filled Dr Mudd served in the Confederate Army Dr Mudd denied that hed ever seen Booth Dr Mudd denied everything until showed him Booths own boot right in his own home Dr Mudd when examined him in prison confessed to me that he set Booths broken leg and then aided him with directions how to reach the Potomac and Virginia The case is ended No No The case is not ended Heres one defense youre gonna hear whether you want it or not The prisoner will observe order Why Why What more could you do to me What threat have you got left You can hang me You can hang us all the innocent as well as the guilty Because youyou nine gallant officers and gentlemen have stripped yourselves of your pride and your honor But ll not go without a fight ll not go without trying to blacken your memories with the insane injustice youll carry on your souls till the day you die And till the day you die youll ask yourselves in your heart three questions Does an assassin confide his plans to anyone Was a physician in the plot because it was part of John Wilkes Booths plan to break his leg and to need me Does a man whose first devotion is no longer to a lost cause or to any flag that flies but to his wife and his child risk any act that could only cause misery and heartbreak on their innocent lives In the sight of the holy God worship m innocent The court will ignore the remarks of the prisoner Sergeant And And you still cant tell me what theyve decided Lady must have told you that dont know any more

Those are mosquito larvae See there But not very interesting to anyone but a medico m afraid Well m also a physician sir No Now am pleased Thats Dr Mudd Oh Well l thought that thought that that as another physician you would understand the circumstances the obligation of a doctor to to give aid to anyone whoever he might be Mr Mudd if you assumed you might find sympathy here get rid of the idea The profession you have dishonored is ashamed of you ashamed of your membership in it As a doctor may tell you that despise you even beyond the rest of the world It would be of no use for me to swear to you on the on the honor of the profession we both respect that had nothing whatsoever to do with with the death of Mr Lincoln It would be of no use whatever m sorry sir Marse Sam Marse Sam Oh Buck Marse Sam s sorry sir but was too scared this afternoon couldnt say nothin to you then Oh knew knew that Tell me what are you doing down here Oh ve been here a month waiting for you sir You have Yes

for minutes You have some sort of plan Judge The plan is uh Mrs Mudds No judged dare devise anything quite so uh extreme explained to Judge Maiben what happened to the writ of habeas corpus you obtained for Sam The government simply laughed at it But if a writ was served on him in say Key West a civil municipality it would be honored wouldnt it Of course But Dr Mudds not in Key West know he isnt yet What did tell you But great Scott Mrs Mudd you surely wouldnt dare General Ewing d dare anything for my husband And it isnt only freedom want for him Its exoneration too Hes innocent and want them to say so to the whole world But if we wait Wait Wait for what For the government to kill my husband Thats all weve done is wait and trust and have faith Oh m so sick of waiting ve found a way to get Sam out Just a moment Mrs Mudd Now all have to say is this If Dr Mudd should be able to deliver himself to the civil authorities in Key West could have a writ of habeas corpus there to be served on him Now under its protection he could be brought back here d reopen the case and feel sure give him a far different trial than the one he had at the courtmartial But as to how Dr Mudd is going to be able to get to Key West well think d rather not hear Good luck my dear and remember wont be the only Yankee wholl be praying with you And dont let anything disturb you wont Good day gentlemen Good
