Now the beta synchrotron sends the electrons through this magnet which bends the force of them down to the reaction vessel Stay away from that elbow joint All right Bran you want to get that Now this is a tunable excimer laser Its tuned to the exact resonance of the plutonium thats in the reaction vessel down at that end Now think were all set Hit it Now watch your eyes Roper This is where the electrons bombard the stuff lasers ionize it and send it off to the condenser Now its a conductive element Down to the condenser This is where it gets converted into its liquid metallic state Would you repeat that please This is where its converted into its liquid metallic state This all happened about fifty seconds ago Its the purest plutonium in the universe Pretty isnt it Ninetynine percent No Have some of that French bubbly All right You popped it Here we go Bob what do you think weapon this big with twenty times the punch of anything anybodys got Is he kidding No He did it all right

plutonium and here we have two very interesting inventions based on this Now can anyone tell us the principle behind the implosion device Paul could you enlighten us Yes Your implosion design simply uses a chemical highexplosive to squeeze a subcritical piece of weaponsgrade plutonium until its supercritical thereby producing an atomic explosion Thank you Roland Thank you Mr Wilkie He did it Him Paul Stephens Hes sick Hiya Jen Hi Paul Did you lose something Its so dumb locked my car keys in the glove compartment because always lose them So now ve lost the keys to the glove compartment Dumb

of life and death Yeah sure Whose Everybodys First call my parents and then call two people dont care who And have them call two people And call the newspaper and the station Are you listening Yeah Go ahead theres a place called Medatomics Company on Route This is position two Theyre coming through approaching the detector position two we copy Hes got it all right Theres the core explosive package electronics tamper batteries Nice design actually Is it armed Nope You certain Mmhmm Its all in sections We know its not armed Paul so want you to just put it down and walk away Walk away Thats right m gonna count to three Hey let me talk to him Doctor stay out of this Let me talk to Conroy on that thing One two This wasnt part of the deal Dont hit the box Jesus Hes got plutonium in that Oh shit

cutting it kind of close isnt it And what is that car key And the reflector Salad bowls Why not What did you use for the firing circuits Photo strobes Well thats thats very pretty Thanks Now what do you say we take it all apart before everybody goes crazy No m sorry cant do that right now This isnt accomplishing anything Sure it is What Deterrence Deterrence Yeah you know Like when each side thinks that the other guy is going to blow everybody up Its called mutually assured destruction Yeah know what its called Well its working isnt it How do you mean m still alive arent Dont talk like that The thing is ve been thinking about it and m not sure that m crazy enough to actually turn the key That is the problem with deterrence isnt it So guess blew it What do you mean m not getting out

bullet and weve got a containment breach All right All right listen Yeah copy command No problem Give me a clear shot behind the ear and ll turn him off like a switch Well at least now can publish What do you mean mean think just blew my security clearance m sorry Its no problem Time for a change of vocations anyway There must be a place in the private sector for an unemployed nuclear weapons designer dont you think What What You turned it No no it happened by itself spontaneously Jesus Damn things counting down Its gonna blow Probably neutron flux Radiation from the core can screw up this kind of solidstate timing circuit never heard of that Yeah well live and learn Gentlemen we got a little wrinkle here Listen carefully and do exactly as say Come on Terry move it Move it Go Go for it Well at least we have dont think so Timebased circuits tend to deteriorate exponentially faster and faster You see Jesus Whyd we bring it back here then Why not Where do you want to take it How about Truman Quarry What Sure Its a couple of square miles at least No one around Its perfect couple of square miles Paul if this thing goes youre gonna get a really good view of a fifty to seventy kiloton explosion What You dont know what you took Paul This is special stuff Its very nasty Its so hot we dont even know how to test it Its a miracle you didnt kill yourself just carrying it home So uh if unscrew this can get the core out right you got a screwdriver No no a bigger one What Its jammed Let me try Its funny the same thing happened at the trinity test forty years ago Oh really The core got stuck halfway in while they were trying to insert it wouldnt bump it around like that if were you It might decide to fire just for spite So what do we do We could drill it No no We might get a static charge Disconnect the batteries What if we get sparks Cut the main lead Yeah Yeah thats worth a try ll need to remove the middle plate Well do it do it Anybody have a phillipshead screwdriver How much time do we have dont know Its in exponential decay Cant you just answer the goddamned question never was any good at math All right as approaches infinity to the to the Nth Right Youre a bright kid You ought to do something with it make it just about three minutes to zero Oh boy Excuse me sir What about evacuation Evacuation of who The people Oh you mean New York Pennsylvania Vermont Canada Those people m at the main connector Go ahead Wire clippers Yeah Right here What the hells that Firing circuit programmed the photo strobes to charge automatically ninety seconds from detonation The timer must be all messed up Maybe should have made it ten seconds Anyhow look it doesnt matter All have to do is cut the power Its this wire right over here All right here go Ready One two No no no Dont cut it Dont do anything Dont do anything What are you nuts Regular photographic strobe units Thats what you used Exactly All right heres the problem Once those things are charged even if you turn them off they can discharge while youre unplugging it This thing could detonate just from our trying to disconnect it Just wait ll wait It wont wait either that thing is gonna work or its not If its not gonna work we can all just stand here until it reaches zero at which point nothing will happen However think its gonna work which means we have to disarm it How Cut the leads between the photo strobes and the high explosives How many leads are there Six along this strip here All right six leads six wires Now the trick is we have to cut them at exactly the same time And mean exactly Or what Oh shit Really Come on Lets just do it Colonel youll count for us Give him the cutters Youre number one two three four five You over here This ones yours Right there Sorry about before kid Just doing the job Nothing personal Three hundred everybody ready Wait dont have a cutter Get us another cutter Over there Come on come on come on dont believe this Are you telling me m going to die cause some asshole didnt bring a pair of pliers got it got it Is that going to work hope so Two ten m going to count backward from five Everybody ready Wait wait Do we cut on one or on zero One eighty On zero like this three two This is just a rehearsal Nobody do anything Three two one cut Everybody understand One ten Anybody want to make a bet No Here we go For real this time Five four three two one That was interesting What do you think youre doing Letting a little fresh air in Get away from that door Give it up colonel We blew it What are you going to do Make us all disappear Me and him And all of them Too many secrets Dr Mathewson remember Jenny Good to see you Paul Mom Its did something What happened Everything Tell you about it later Lets get out of here
