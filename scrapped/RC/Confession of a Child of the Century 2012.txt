It was in circumstances such as these that was stricken by the disease of the century The man had caught in my mistress arms was one of my closest friends It was the first time had seen a monster Back to back moment of distraction was never his swear made a mistake not committed a crime If you leave me it will kill me Cock your pistols Walk Aim Fire Its the arm hes alright What was going to do with myself had no situation no occupation had studied a little law a little medicine but had given up was writing a little Are you sure you wont come would rather stay here You dont go out anymore You dont see anyone m trying to think You think too much Hmm You think too much gave up long ago Thinking is out of fashion These days one has to mock Ask me the question What do you believe in What do you believe in In nothing Forget that woman If shes such a great loss mean take the first woman that comes along What are you talking about You may show me trees houses birds blue sky Men who talk and drink women who dance Horses that gallop Thats not life Its not life Its its the sound of life Go go now Let me rest Then rest in peace my friend Your life is a funeral Well Well know what happened Octave Elise told me everything m her closest friend and yet Tell her Madame Tell her that m sad So this whole business is beyond repair There really is no solution Nothing is beyond repair except for the pain that is killing me every day My story is quite simple to tell can neither love her nor love another nor go on without love have been in love too He left me too Excuse me Madame ll get out here Madame feel dizzy But its about to rain The great reason that was preventing me from recovering was my youth thought only of women Possessing a woman meant loving and no longer believed in the possibility of loving You should kill me have lied to you am loathsome and pitiful But love you cant live without you Is that you Frederic Were going to be late had lived only through that woman To doubt her was to doubt all To curse her to renounce all To lose her to destroy all belong to a generation of youth born in war for war Sons of the Empire grandsons of the Revolution We left our schools and no longer seeing sabres nor cuirasses asked where our fathers were We were told that the war was over An anxious youth then sat on this world in ruins Thats a true story think she said theres a relation Thats Anna Morel actually Then we cant Two sides had lined up On the one hand exalted minds lowered their heads and wept On the other the men of flesh remained standing amid the rebels And their sole concern was to count the money they had Lets drink to the idiocy of this government which gives us such power over idiots Liberty has given birth to anarchy and anarchy leads to tyranny and tyranny restores liberty But think of all the millions of men who have died trying to make one of these systems triumph And theyve all failed Our century is laughing amid ruins And the moral world goes round this vicious circle Men try and make things better theyre just moving things around Ah politic bores me From now on the world belongs to the bankers Let us drink to the power of gold The rich man is in power hes the king he can do anything Hes above everything He doesnt obey the laws the law will obey him There is no guillotine no executioner for millionnaires Oh shut up you sceptic You have ridiculed every power there is It is as vulgar as to deny God Hope for heaven There is a commercial idea Deus Ignotus To gods unknown feeling of inexpressible discomfort began to ferment in all young hearts Sentenced to rest by the world sovereign Sentenced to idleness and boredom the anxiety of death wormed its way into their soul If it was tantamount to a negation of all things then one can call it disenchantment or desperation if one prefers The disease of the century Take me now stay together am the cat am the cat tell you am the cat am the cat Come here am the cat am the cat The discovery of debauchery is like dizzyness At first we feel a sort of terror mingled with voluptuousness The first movement is surprise The second horror And the third pity From that day on changed my life completely One may hesitate for twenty years before taking this step but cannot back away once one has taken it It was not long before the whole of Paris had declared that was the greatest libertine Desgenais was delighted with me But while my vanity occupied itself in this manner my heart was suffering Virtually all the time there was within me one man who was laughing and another who was crying Once however was on the verge of falling in love Hello Old boy How are you Have you been loved Do you want to be loved Are you a queen Are you good or evil What are you doing there Will you come Yes Of course Youre so beautiful Will you come Yes m m coming Just coming Take along with you the first man and say to him these are people who spend their lives wallowing in all forms of pleasure Women as many as they want They are rich every day is a holiday for them What do you think Unless hes sternly and deeply religious he would reply that he could not conceive of greater happiness Now say to the same man Look this is your life You are the happiest of men All your desires are realities Only be careful you dont read too much or find your body no longer able to enjoy pleasure Thatd be a great misfortune Beware of disgust Its an enduring disease dead man is better than a living one who is disgusted of life Do you have a heart Beware of life Whats worse than the disease of debauchery is ridicule Do you have a conscience Beware sleep Do you have a body Beware suffering Do you have a soul Beware despair Each woman that you kiss takes a spark of your happiness without ever giving you one of hers You keep exhausting yourself with ghosts You must die Youre the enemy of everything that loves But do not wait for old age Do not leave a child on the earth do not fertilise a corrupt blood Erase yourself Like smoke This is what you taught me Youve come too late m afraid Your father would have liked to have seen you one last time Farewell my son love you am done Whatever suffering passion may cause one must not compare lifes sorrows with those of death Every day visited his tomb the rest of the time lived alone lived the life my father had left and for the first time in my life was happy Grief was teaching me virtue was beginning to understand the age we live in Behind us the past destroyed for good still caught up in its ruins Ahead of us the first glow of the future And between these two worlds the present century where one doesnt know with each step taken whether one is walking on the sea to a rubble knew your father a little He was a good man Yes he was My aunt used to play cards with him in the afternoon You should come and visit her That would make her happy Wait have to stop feel tired What are you thinking was wondering why God created you mean was telling myself it was to heal all those who are suffering My my such words Coming from you one one can only take them as a compliment Why Because you seem very young to me Well at times one can be older than ones face One can also be younger than ones words Dont you believe in experience Ah know thats the name most men give to their their extravagances and sorrows What could someone your age know of that Madame a man of my age can live more fully than a woman of thirty The freedom that men enjoy it leads them more quickly to the depth of all things You see was tired earlier but m not any more Treat your experience the way treat my tiredness Weve had quite a race and we shall dine with all the more appetite for it The very next day was at her house She was a widow

there are two such different men within you can you forget the good one when the bad one rises Do you like opera remember one evening at supper a singer friend of Desgenais she was singing her voice was magnificent and for the first time saw my friend moved It was a beautiful sight After that in shame no doubt he was overcome by a fit of madness he smashed everything around him Chairs tables the lot The woman had been able to bring him out of himself It left him beside himself Amusing to see isnt it Youre too devout You dont know what its like Theres nothing quite like people who live without a care or who make love without believing it Well then teach me teach me to please you always m happy to learn Pretend you dont love me Just let me love you and not say a word about it What do have to do for you to believe it Am to your liking Which one of your mistresses do resemble Am beautiful enough Am beautiful enough For you to forget that one can still believe in love Stop it Stop it Now

Blessed is he who escapes his times
