Dont do this Oh okay Now if can have your attention please What youre looking at is sand presumably from the Gansu Desert in China Or perhaps even from the Sahara Youre disqualified Were not entirely sure where its from Mr Richards youre disqualified Wait what This is a science fair not a magic competition dont see any real science here And youre paying for the backboard Did you put it on or Everything was the same know but youre smashing the buttons Its delicate You cant smash it Hey kid m really sorry about your plane Youre a dick You cranked it up too high didnt crank it up too high It was on the same setting as last time know but its very precise Excuse me guys Just pack it up Yeah Did you really build this in your garage Mmmhmm Now this is elegant What are these Uh Sonic projectors using cymatics to modulate the field Thats why we cant bring the matter back from the other dimension Uh What Weve gone so far as to send matter to another dimension but we havent been able to maintain a field long enough to bring that matter back You just did Oh youre serious think youve cracked interdimensional travel mean were not sending anything to another dimension We sent something we think to another part of the planet but dont know about another dimension We found the same thing you did Weve had it analyzed repeatedly but no ones ever seen anything like it Oh wow m sorry Were from the Baxter Foundation This is my daughter Sue Hi Hi Wed like to give you a full scholarship Uh where did you say you were from again Hey You could fit the whole neighborhood in there Whats your name Uh Reed Richards Yes of course Weve been expecting you They actually wear lab coats here This is you sir Here What What is this Its a goingaway present m not going away m like a minute train ride from Oyster Bay Reed look at this place You belong here ve been here two minutes and already know that m just going to school here Its where m gonna be working It looks like youre home buddy Hey This place is pretty incredible They have molecular chem books from the s Oh hey Sorry did you say something Yeah was just asking what are you listening to Portishead Never heard of him Them ll have to check them out love this book Its about this guy Captain Nemo He invents a submarine that goes deeper than anything in history Yeah know ve read it So you like music Is that kind of like your thing Pattern recognition Pattern recognition Music is just a series of altered patterns The musician creates the pattern and makes us anticipate a resolution then holds back Makes you wait for it Theres patterns in everything and everyone Hmm Whats mine You wanna be famous Your parents teachers all told you one thing one way to be and you ignored them And now m here So you are Am that predictable Everybody is Well youre wrong dont wanna be famous just want my work to make a difference Well here you are Captain Nemo Go for it Bye Let me guess Some kid from the Internet Science fair Franklin this board has invested a great deal in your little orphanage We need real world applications This has real world applications truly believe that there is an entire An entirely new universe just beyond our ability to see Yes ve read your paper Once we get there If we get there well be able to discover new resources Energy sources which will revitalize our own This is our chance to learn more about our planet and maybe even save it And m sure you all would agree that even if Wait What is this Victor Von Doom is on here He started this project and devoted a decade of his life to it He deserves to be in jail He deserves another chance He set fire to your data servers before he left m going to personally supervise him need his talent believe he and Reed can finally get us there We want to support you Franklin but you put a lot of faith in these kids put all my faith in them So someone stole my design No one stole anything Victor Someone else figured out your idea and made it work Thats what happens when you drop out of the world Other people finish what you started Well if you came to ask for help be better you didnt insult both of us and turn back around Dont you wanna even look at the designs told you m done working for you and your employers Theyre not my employers You cant do a thing without their permission yes Wake up Youre an employee Theyll stay out of my way this time Trust me Its not you dont trust Yeah Well hate to interfere with all of your important work Guess well just have to make history without you Is Sue gonna be there trust her Yes Victor shell be there Clean yourself up son Holy shit Amazing Oh thanks Amazing you didnt black out the entire Western Hemisphere Hmm You basically ripped a hole in the fabric of spacetime with unspecd components and no supervision Yeah that was uh an accident And if by accident you upped the power you would have created a runaway reaction that opened a black hole and swallowed the entire planet Well m glad that didnt happen Are you helping on this m making the environment suits Based on the soil samples from our experiments anyone who goes to the other dimension is gonna need to be protected Whos that Victor Whos Victor He started this whole project Oh Does he go here too Its complicated Rudimentary Elementary This is basically a childs drawing You know what Albert Einstein said If you cant explain it simply you dont understand it well enough Ten years searching for something that is basically runnerup for a baking soda volcano We were actually disqualified The potato clock got second Reed Richards Victor Von Doom Victor started the Quantum Gate project when he was younger than you Wow Its great to meet you Hi Susan Hey Victor Do you prefer Susan No Its been a while Didnt expect to see you back here Yeah well couldnt resist When heard about the design needed to see it with my own eyes gotta say its pretty impressive Thank you that you nearly destroyed our entire planet with speaker cable and aluminum foil Yeah that was an accident He did get it to work What is this This is where your little uh accident leads to We put a camera on a drone we sent over there The drone didnt come back but those images did Wow Its beautiful Yes it is New energy resources Its a whole new world Which can help save this one Not that it deserves to be saved mean think about it The people running the Earth are the same ones running it into the ground So maybe it deserves what its got coming to it Dr Doom over here The failures of my generation are the opportunities for yours There are no greater minds than the ones in this room Is he gonna give a speech Hes gonna give a speech But youre gonna have to all come together Each of you working together with a level of commitment and collaboration putting aside petty squabbles if you want to fix what my generation broke If you can do that work together then you can change the course of history Thats a pretty good speech m in Me too m here right First design We figure out what went wrong and correct it Then we build then we send organic matter over there But more importantly we bring it back And then most importantly they send us Us Us us Were going over there Not unless you get to work So get to work Johnny Storm So thats the piece of shit Toyota you been talking about Why yes it is Now you promise me well still be

start thinking about sending men Yeah Us Look wont deny that what youve created here is incredible But this isnt the school science fair anymore We have to bring in help now Why just Why not the Army or the We could send our political prisoners there Waterboarding in the fourth dimension could prove very effective Why dont we discuss the details of this someplace else In the meantime we appreciate your service Oh Hey thank you wont let this go promise you Just give him a second to figure this out Look dont know about you guys but could use some Want a drink Ethanol kills brain cells You are a

In terms of potential you already know what hes accomplished in the field Hes been active in covert operations with a success rate Protecting our men and women in battle and saving countless lives Ladies and gentlemen this is only the beginning The other survivors of the Baxter Incident all exhibited unique physical conditions We developed suits which allow them to contain and control these conditions This subjects suit controls her spectral flares and refractive visibility With intense concentration she has also developed the ability to render other objects invisible And to neuropathically produce force fields All these abilities come from one place Another dimension that our scientists have taken to calling Planet Zero planet infused with the same energy that transformed these survivors and potentially could transform our military capabilities We have the direct link With your continued support once the Quantum Gate project is finished well have control over more than that world Well have control over ours Everyone have a look What the hell is that Subject Number Two meters in six seconds New record Just need to work on my takeoff can make it in five All target drones neutralized Keep holding your breath Susan As long as you can Directional stability is over Rise is steady Pitch is eight degrees Your balance is getting better Hey Theyre gonna send me on a project Like Ben We should use these powers to do something Theyre not powers Theyre aggressively abnormal physical conditions that were gonna fix Can you turn that off And what if they cant

Washington visiting Got a second to say hello Its an honor to meet you Mr Grimm We appreciate all youre doing for us That was the deal Right And there she is the Quantum Gate herself The uh star of the show Franklin d like for you all to meet Franklin Storm who is our supervisor here on the floor How do you do sir Good morning Good morning How long until its ready Well weve had a few issues but were getting closer Closer every day All right Dr Allen Well give you what you need In the meantime wed like to put more of your subjects in the field Subject Two is ready to go Get him ready for combat Susan Can have a word with you Theyre sending Johnny into the field You mean hes sending himself into the field The only way to stop him is to cure him And that means finishing the Gate cant finish it without Reed Reeds not coming back He abandoned us left us here He was afraid He didnt know what this place was cant believe youre still defending him Help me track him down Suzu Hell listen to you Well reopen the Gate find a cure end this Johnnys your brother Its never been as easy for him as it has for you But like it or not hes family And family means we take care of each other What

accounts Bouncing off satellites Hes keeping himself pretty well hidden For a short while we were able to ping him here and there Caught him on a few sites He was looking for scrap metal buying parts Never stayed online that long Was he looking for anything else He was searching for him m gonna need some music Excuse me need music It helps me think The valve is worn its not worth twenty ll give

know how theyve used Ben Yeah do And theyre gonna do the same thing to Johnny if we dont stop them The only shot weve got is on the other side of that Gate Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadnt come to the science fair that day We cant change the past But we can change the future You said you wanted your work to make a difference This is it This is your chance Are you ready You made it ugly Its good to see you again son m gonna need ten minutes To do what need to make a couple adjustments to the source code You have a few steps that are out of order It cant be that simple It might not be ten minutes It could be a little less Come on Lets go got a good feeling Stan m gonna crack five seconds Hey could take a couple of minutes with my son Sure no problem Guys can you give us five minutes Whats going on Reed is back Were closer than weve ever been before Closer to what Our old lives Oh you mean your life No son You always said had the potential to do something

you man Good to see you too Sonic projectors engaged Goggles up Initiate launch Systems check complete We have a visual Roger that Control Are you receiving atmospheric data Copy that Checking configuration Data transmission looks good The landscapes changed How dont know its just different Commencing element and geological test series Copy Hey Control m picking up a heat signature about yards away Now what could that be Hard to make out The signal keeps fluctuating Its moving Heading towards us Copy that Proceed with caution Do you have a visual It appears to be a human form with some sort of foreign element around it knew youd come back Victor Not possible Subject appears injured Get the med kit Lets get him to the shuttle Grab him Come on Easy guys Abort Bring him back Aborting mission Stabilize the subject and prepare for transport Oh shit Preparing for launch Transfer the subject to Containment Room One Copy that His thermal signature is barely registering His biochemistry is off the charts want to talk to him Nobody talks to him until do Confine the others to their quarters Victor We dont know how you survived over there but were still analyzing the data It appears that your environment suit fused with your body but were working on that Were going to help you Victor Were working with the government now Were going to send more expeditions to the other side but first you need to tell us everything you know about that place You want to know how survived That place kept me alive Gave me strength Power What kind of power The kind men like you must never possess You couldnt resist coming back Its not enough to ruin your world Now you want to ruin mine Victor If this world must die so that mine may live so be it Code Red Code Red There is an emergency in this building Follow standard emergency protocols Proceed to the nearest exit and leave the building immediately Code Red Code Red There is an emergency in this building Follow standard emergency protocols Code Red Code Red There is an emergency in this building Follow standard emergency protocols Proceed to the nearest exit and leave the building immediately Running away again No Sue My bad Are you okay Yeah m all right Wheres Dad Victor no Just stop Out of my way Franklin m going home This is your home son Not anymore There is nothing for you over there Only the power to

future for us Susan Help me Reed Ben Goodbye Susan Ah Reed Is he dead If that things still active so is he We cant beat him Hes stronger than any of us Yeah he is But hes not stronger than all of us Look this place gave him his powers but it gave us all of ours too Its who we are now Maybe its who were meant to be We opened this door were gonna close it So whats the plan Enough When your world is destroyed and m all thats left then it will be enough Always so smug thinking you were smarter than me am smarter than you Now Hey Its clobbering time This better work No Lets get the hell out of here While the world may not know what you did to save it The men and the women in this room do And so does the President That said wed like to continue our existing relationship So if were all in agreement Were not Excuse me Were not remotely all in agreement We dont need you or anybody else to keep an eye on us We just want a place where we can work And whatever we come up with belongs to us And what if we say no Say yes How much space are we talking about lot Whoa Hey So uh thought there were gonna be four of you Oh there is Labs are upstairs Engineerings on the south side and Assemblys

call it whatever you want We work for you now Oh wow Now thats what m talking about Thats pretty nice m taking that area over there could get used to this got it The Franklin Storm Research Center Dad was kind of allergic to his name in big letters Which reminds me think that the four of us should have a name Why would we need a name Because were a team now and theres four of us so we should come up with a name for it Like The Human Torch and the Torchettes Ugh No Are you kidding me How about The Big Brain and His Neurons How about The Big Brain and Her Neurons How about Two Guys a Girl and the Thing that Nobody Wanted Hey we both know that you could take him Hey Hey What Weve come a long way since the garage Gotta say its fantastic Say that again Its fantastic Yes it is Guys got it
