woman Publications like Rolling Stone and Spare Rib were created to feed the need for alternative narratives from the established newspapers of the day In much the same way the Pauper Press of the s in England was developed out of a need for mass representation for the popular classes Those magazines and fanzines of the s and s also provided a means of reaching beyond the official and thus ultimately beyond the ruling classes The Internet in contrast no longer requires there to be any notion of the group Its concern is wholly with the individual It is with lucrative serendipity or perhaps just good branding that Myspace is so called The juxtaposition suggests that the act of the individual in defining their cyberspace borders is more important than what it is filled with It is simply your space For the end of monetized mass communication is the end of the press baron champagne baths man Thank you Anna Very provocative Well done Does anyone else have a presentation to make
