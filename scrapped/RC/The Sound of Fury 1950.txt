woman and you can find a decent life am sorry let you down Go back home and forget me Howard Thats why begged you this morning not to treat this tragic crime with thoughtless emotionalism But Tyler is guilty Yes Tyler is guilty But hatred is not the answer It is wrong to treat Tyler and his accomplice as if they werent members of the human race Men do not live in a vacuum They live with one another And if a man becomes a criminal sometimes his environment is defective We should be able to start with the child That is why decided to make my lecture tour In my own small way ve tried to point out that violence is a disease caused by moral and social breakdown This is the real problem between nations as well as people It must be solved by reason not by emotion With understanding not hate Only thus can we regain the moral center of our universe Do you not remember how often we discussed these things in the old days Of course remember Vito Of course youre right used words as criminally as they used that rock It is easy to forget our humanity Hal please Hal please dont start this run Give me minutes to write another story What are you talking about This is the biggest story to ever hit
