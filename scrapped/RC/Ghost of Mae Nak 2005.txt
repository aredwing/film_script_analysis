Ghost What do you mean a Ghost What am going to tell youis the story of Mae Nak Over a hundred years agothere was a young woman called Nak Nak married a young man named Mak They were very much in love And their marriagewas a true commitment They were inseparable Because theyloved each other very much And they were blessed withconception of a child But then the dream was brokenher Mak had to go to war Mak was seriously injured The monks helped him recover Soon Mak was ready to returnto his true love his Nak They were together again as a family But then Mak noticed thatthings had changed Neighbours they knew so well had goneReople would not stop at their house Mak then went home to tell Nak The villagers told him she died inchildbirth and she was now a ghost That night the had her revenge on the village The dead were the people thattried to take Mak away from Nak She would not let themShe cursed them and stopped them The villagers awake Mak to facethe truth about his young wife That she is dead and he has been livingwith a ghost who has struck revenge On those who tried tocome between her and Mak There in the grave was thedecaying body of the young Mae Nak Maks wife and true love and next to her their dead child The Higher Dignitary performedan exorcism on Nak and her child They were made to rest in peace Mae Nak no longer sought revenge on those who tried to stopher love between her and her Mak Grandma why didMae Nak want revenge She wanted to keep the true love she hadHer love for her Mak was so overwhelming It became her obsessionturned to anger and finally revenge

It was there in the small print that he could increase the priceof the house after one week and that it was legal to do so Actually his intentionwas never to sell it Rrakanong House was the property Mr Angel had He used it for hisreal estate company registration And he used it to exploit moneyfrom young newly married couples Couples like you and Mak Why would Mr Angel do that Greed What other reasons are there Maybe he went too farfor this time You are very lucky Nak You and Mak owna very special property If you look at the map That is Bangkok today This map shows the same areabut over
