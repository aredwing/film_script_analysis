some interesting things to share with you about Ms Fannie Okay m ready Yes Her vomiting and lack of appetite is resulting from a problem in her small intestine She has swallowed a foreign object She has an obstruction that is not allowing the normal peristalsis of the smooth muscle to continue What could that object be Well thats a good question And m sure youll be able to recognize it quite easily How she swallowed that dont know but there it is And so what were gonna need to do is a laparotomy Its in a actually a very good position It passed through her stomach through her pylorus and its in the upper part of what we call the duodenum of the small intestine This is a another chart showing in this instance a foreign object which is a ball thats in this animals intestine Even in a sterile surgical setting theres bacteria at work in the tract so were gonna need to compensate for that Well flush her abdomen Yeah Her blood work looks really great Shes gonna be a good anesthetic risk Were catching this early Youre gonna get right through this Very very good chance that shell shell do super fine ll be able to just make a small Could you give me the percentage of chance Were gonna make a small incision would say Excellent chance of full recovery Thats all want Okay Mornin Mr Manglehorn You doin alright today Another day another sausage You got that right Little ol sausage

Very pink and pretty with all the mesenteric vessels in good shape And there we go That doesnt belong there It appears with our little animal friends that theyre a lot tougher than us humans lot of
