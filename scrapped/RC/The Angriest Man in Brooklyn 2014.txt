with grief over her own cat Harold Three days ago Harold had jumped out the window Afterward she learned that this was not uncommon with cats The fact that Harold landed on his feet floors below was of little consolation Oh Sharon understood that Harold was a trigger That she was emotionally exhausted Ohh Still caring more for a dead cat than her sick patients was clearly a case of clinical depersonalization Open Wider Excuse me No one had ever mentioned this reality when she was a bright shiny medical student Uh Doctor When she believed she was going to save the world one patient at a time Doctor No one told her that care does not equal need Care being finite need being endless Doctor Move man Move What care equals is minutes per patient Doctor Mrs Fine is in Who Mrs Fine Shes one of Dr Fieldings patients who youre covering remember And we got Wong in and Peterson in Okay all right Listen just need a minute But shes been in there over an hour Uhhuh Sharon wondered not for the

a ballooningout of an artery wall in the brain And when it pops That would be a hemorrhagic stroke And m dead The seriousness depends on the size and location of the aneurysm How big is it m an internist Its best if you speak to a specialist You have the scan right there How big understand But theres a specialist a neurologist at Brooklyn You know right Dr Bernstein already called made

you Henry was fully committed to make tender love to his wife one last time But there were concerns For one he couldnt remember the last time theyd done it year ago Maybe more Henry also wondered what was the appropriate position for a last shtup He assumed spooning must be involved Then again he had read that condemned prisoners often asked for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as their last meal Certainly the missionary position was the of sex And of course there was Henrys biggest concern Would he be able to raise the flag at all As Henry ran he prayed not for a medical miracle but for the simple ability to get it up know shouldnt be telling you this and its going against every protocol but um your brother was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and is refusing treatment Oh God Well uh are you his doctor Yes Well no mean m filling in for his doctor Dr Fielding And this diagnosis is definite m afraid so He He was just here and was awful You didnt know knew something was strange But with Henry theres always something sort of strange He had a son Peter Great kid Died two years ago in a hunting accident of all things Henrys never been the same since We used to have lunch together every day He would bring a brown paper bag in and we Two sandwiches One for him one for me We talked about everything And now we dont talk about anything anymore Wait Ninety minutes How can you be sure its only minutes Thats a misunderstanding How do you misunderstand that The important thing is we find your brother and get him admitted to a hospital immediately He went home Bette its Aaron m on my way to your apartment Call me back on my cell Its an emergency Any instructions Oh um Make sure that he remains calm Nothing that raises his blood pressure Like Anger And youve met my brother Henry thought you were working late Frank hi Get out Whats going on He needs to leave Hes our neighbor No no need you alone Why Because we have to have sex immediately and then cuddle What are you nuts No no just wanna have a moment a husband and wife moment Itll be a good thing a family thing dont have a lot of time really think should go You stay Go Youre staying Stop that dont care how crazy you are we are not having sex Oh but Bette listen know the last two years have been tough and didnt deal well with you know and ve been erratic and often pissed off at things You think But it doesnt mean ve

do it in the kitchen if you like What the hell is the matter with you Cant make love to my wife No Why the hell not Because sex isnt some magic switch you pull just because youre feeling a momentary twinge of guilt Guilt What guilt About being horrible Who said was horrible Oh thought that part was obvious Whats he still doing here really You know what Stay You always were a little bit of a jerk but you were an amusing jerk But since Peter youre just a jerk lost a son for Christs sake And didnt You just cant honor the son we lost and you drove away the one we do still have Tommy doesnt
