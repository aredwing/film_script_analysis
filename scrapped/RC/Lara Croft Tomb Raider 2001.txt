Stop Bugger Not live rounds Lara Hes in a real pain right now This is a major remodel you know This is a disaster Was it programmed to stop before it took my head off Ah well that would be a no But you said Make it more challenging Hence the live fire Live rounds again Poor Simon What has she done to you Very funny m trying to turn you into a lady And a lady should be modest Yes lady should be modest Brothers and sisters today is the th of May The first day of the planetary alignment and we are still no nearer to discovering the location of the key It seems we are running out of time This is not acceptable Mr Powell your explanation for this please have no explanation Certainly no excuses Except to respectfully remind the council that we are working from clues based on ancient cosmological models predating Aristotle But m happy to announce that were almost ready And am supremely confident that we will have our answer in time for the relevant planetary alignment So we will have possession of the key in one week Yes indeed One week This is good news Mr Powell But remember we have only a single opportunity to retrieve the two halves of the triangle And if we fail we must wait another years Well thats more time than m prepared to commit to this enterprise We shall be ready Trust me Were not ready are we No Good morning Lara And what a beautiful morning it is Back to work m afraid Its adventure time Egypt again Its nothing but pyramids and sand know Gets everywhere in the cracks Spanish galleon Do you know what day it is Hillary Yes of course The th And that is never a good day miss you Daddy wish we could get back the time that was stolen from us My father would love to have seen this Tonight Pluto and Neptune align with Uranus Its the first stage of the alignment of all nine planets culminating in a full solar eclipse It only happens once every years When is the eclipse In one week from today But there is plenty to look out for until then Incredible wish you could remember her She loved you so much Mummy wish could remember her too still have you Daddy Yes you do The exact alignment of the planets necessary to activate the triangle only occurs

of sand And a heaven in a wild flower Hold infinity in the palm of your hand And eternity in an hour William Blake The AllSeeing Eye My darling daughter knew you would figure this out If youre reading this letter m no longer with you and miss you and love you always and forever It also means have failed and must place an awful burden on your shoulders Lara by now m sure you will have discovered the clock concealed The clock is the key Lara It will unlock the hiding place of two pieces of a sacred icon This is the magical triangle told you about when you were little The Triangle Of Light But it is no bedtime story It was forged from metal found in the crater of a meteor that had fallen to earth at the exact moment of the previous alignment of the nine planets The People of the Light built a great city in this crater where they worshiped the triangle for its ability to control time It gave its possessor a power that could be used for good or great evil Their abuse of this power led to the destruction of the city To be sure no man would ever again wield this power the triangle was split into two pieces and hid at opposite ends of the earth Lara do you remember the jasmine that only grows in one temple on the ancient Khmer trail in Cambodia That is the entrance to the Tomb Of The Dancing Light where the first half of the triangle is hidden You must be there at the exact moment of the second phase of the planetary alignment You must hurry you have very little time As the planets move into alignment the world will be in great danger from the secret society known as the Illuminati devious dangerous men who seek to fulfil an ancient prophecy by reuniting the two halves and attaining the triangles awesome and terrible powers This you must prevent at all costs So Lara am asking you to complete my work To find and destroy both halves of the triangle How are you gonna get to Cambodia and get the clock back in hours ll be calling in a favour What kind of favour Well that is a secret If told you d have to kill you Lady Croft are you on target Over Right on target Thank you boys Over and out Ah Mr Powell How predictable Alex West What are you doing here We have minutes to the next alignment We have to work faster Come on guys Come on guys Come on pull Pull its coming Good So any sign of Lady Croft Not yet Lara is overrated She is good dont get me wrong but shes in it for the glory Whereas m in it for the money Fortunately Into the belly of the beast And out of the demons ass Jasmine Remember what were looking for is hidden not only in space but also in time The clock is the key My God Return the eye into the stones embrace the wheel of heaven will turn Exhume the light from its watery grave to receive the gift of heaven as you are condemned to the depths of hell So touch anything and you get your head chopped off We have two minutes Mr West Youre the tomb raider figure it out Mr West tempus fugit Yes time flies Its the swords Come on guys get

making a big mistake Tourist visa No m working Is there a good reason why just kept you alive Yes Thats not the true eye This is the true eye Its not actually Its a mirror image Youre trying to cheat me out of my little ray of sunshine Why would cheat you need you to get it so can steal it from you later Youre bluffing Julius make a mental note Kill Miss Croft if she attempts any such thing Yes sir We can do it my way or come back for the next alignment Youre welcome to try and kill me then In say another years Zero guess she was right The log must pierce the urn Come on Its slowing down Its

you Superlative Of course digress You have my half of the triangle And you have my fathers clock Listen my dear without each other we are quite useless at this point We should reevaluate our positions You and are in business together We should have a business meeting You mean you love to have another opportunity to try and kill me Oh thats harsh But perhaps Wait and see Come to Venice Via Dolorosa Wonderful Bye then Harder Here it comes Hide everybody Look out Its some sort of machine Hello Bryce its me Hello Bryce its Lara found the temple Ran into Mr Powell Did you get the clock No but got the first piece Oh beautiful smashing Seems m level begging with Mr Powell Wont he want to kill you now No silly His problem is that he needs the piece that have Until then m his new best friend What about the other half The final alignment is in hours and minutes Weve still got no idea where the second piece is hidden Hes going to tell me where it is He will Trust me Pack for Venice Pack for where Hello Lara Bye then Drink Rest There is no rest for the wicked You got what you came for did yes Too bad Bad for the world The world is safe now little bit safer perhaps Because you will go on Your father said you will never give up My father You knew my father Now drink Finish your tea It tastes quite bad but its good for you See Good evening Youre with the Illuminati beg your pardon Theres no such thing Its just a bedtime story Illuminati The People of the Light Have you brought my triangle No Of course you havent Youve hidden it somewhere Well you can keep the triangle you have and will keep your fathers clock and we can be partners Who sits here We can be partners and go for the big prize The Triangle of Light Yes but who sits here Its an incredible dream An awesome power It could set right so many wrongs dont think you sit here do you sit here on Gods right hand as it were In fact now sit exactly where your father sat Youre lying No he mentored me in the order It was truly an honour dont believe you My father was not with the Illuminati He would have told me He had a great many secrets Not from me Especially from you know what you want Lara Oh doubt it Another life with your father second chance It will be within my power to give The triangle gives its possessor the power of God to move back and forth through time undo the past Help me and you will get what know you want To have your father returned to you How do know that once gave you that piece that you wouldnt try to kill me Would it make it easier for you On more familiar ground if killed you now Will you reconsider Hello Alex You think m a greedy unscrupulous sellout whod do anything for money Yes thats right Well the money bits true guess Is it Alex If you cross me we may not be able to remain friends Always a pleasure Now for a cold shower Were in big trouble Hold this will you They already think that we have Lady Crofts piece of the triangle Yes they think its in that box youre carrying right now Is it Why dont you worry about something else Of course its not dont understand What chance of success do we have without the piece Zero Dont dwell on it But What a nice surprise Thank you Now time to save the universe again then is it Absolutely Are we sure she is really necessary One tomb raider is good two better My bum has gone asleep again all down the left cheek Really Thats fascinating How much longer few hours We have to take the last hour overland Helicopters wont fly near the ruined city Its a dead zone We take all doggies da Mucho greenback da All doggies Welcome to the dead zone Its not a country its an ice cube Come on Right Lets go Go on get it Holy shit Its a time storm Time is broken here We must find the Eye All of you Hurry We are running out of time Hurry Its begun is inside the sun For Gods sake hurry The eclipse will be over in a few minutes Alex give me the clock know what to do Has she got the piece We will now unite these two parts The past and the present At last we of the Illuminati will control time and fulfil the sacred promise to our ancestors Soon the entire world Enough of this twaddle Come on Not quite what you hoped for Mr Powell Oh Lara have a gut instinct about this After all you are the daughter of a genius Let me test my theory You had to let him go No more bubbles You show me how to complete the triangle and we can change his fate If you deliver me the power of God will spare him Its only a little trip back in time But m pretty sure youve figured out the answer to the problem And then of course theres the loss of your father can change that Youd better be ready for this Unhook your laser sight Do it To see a world in a grain of sand Oh God Daddy Is this real It is a crossing of my past and your present Why did you not tell me about the Illuminati You were only a child You could have written it in your journals You never mentioned it Not once burst to tell you everything but in the fierceness of my own battles told you only that which would inspire you and keep you safe love you so much have missed you And have missed you know why you came here why you took the power of the light But this must not happen Why Why cant we use the power just this once Why cant you stay We cant change time But time was stolen from us and its not fair No its not fair But you have stolen time itself and you must give it back You must destroy the triangle Suddenly feel so alone You are never alone am with you always just as ve always been Move out Wait Your father begged for his life when we caught him betraying us He pleaded like a baby Surrender Never He seemed particularly concerned that should not take this Lara no The place is coming down This is insane Get them out of here You just hurry There you go Safe and sound No guns Oh my God Quiet What
