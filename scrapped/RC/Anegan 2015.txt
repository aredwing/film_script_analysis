You seem close this instance But when come near you vanish into thin air Steady heart set on fire Dreams seared on a pyre Before you melt my life dear will see you wonder Like dew drops on leaves tender here and there we meander When the wind blows we scatter Honey with golden honey flavor Most painful distress is loves suffering Even more heartless than lifes offering Away from you in darkness melt into blankness bury myself into the endless sky so blue Hearts core torched Dreams to cinders scorched Before you melt into oblivion love will meet you again Like dew drops on leaves tender here and there we meander When the wind blows we scatter Honey with golden honey flavor Love wrings throttling me Tears as rivulets run untiringly To remember is a pain forget is in vain Life is an elongated emotional strain Like a raindrop lost in a dense forest why have you also gone my dearest Like the root gravitates to water Girl Ill reach you wherever When eyes close tight see a hundred hues bright Again when eyes open wide world becomes zero outside Though away for a little while you lamented big time volatile For many births do you know how a girls heart echoes in sorrow Im sure they are Kirans me Madam come out My leg is stuck inside Look there Ashwin Welcome back to reality Just you relaxrelax You are heavily sedated You arent fully conscious as yet You are a killer
