has uploaded the information on the Omaha facility Are we set up Yes Were coordinating with local Good The facility is a converted hangar bought by a startup planning to lease bandwidth That ring a bell remember it was a strange building to house servers in Yeah apparently so did the potential clients The company was sold at auction before they even opened The place hasnt been entered since time of sale Were still trying to locate the current owner Whatd you do there Same thing always do Installed level failsafe circuitry what Password protection m impressed always thought you were a little

its own What the hell are you looking at All right so thats why it picked you It wanted to move and you were the only one with the key Yeah but to get out past the firewalls it wouldve needed Someone at the Pentagon Right Okay Why does it even need to leave at all What could it possibly do here that it couldnt do there Well theres your answer What is it Sir come take a look at this Now what Its upgrading itself The upgrade Congress wouldnt allow it so its giving it to itself And it couldnt do that at could it No This is a temporary house Long enough to take residence in every computer on the net mean itll be unstoppable Shut it down Dont try it Whats that It looks like financial records Oh my God Its taken the entire countrys money hostage Of course The fourth recipient worked at Axiprus They have the largest credit data storage facility in the country Makes sense So if we turn it off or blow this place well lose everything No hold on If can get around our security failsafes somehow

shut it down Sir if we do this we wont have security It will Look d be lying if said thought this was how it was gonna go down but the bottom line is the President wants this want this and the country will be saferwith this So end of story Let me try talking to him Burke this is Reed Reed m sorry you got caught in the crossfire on this one Yeah m sure you are Have you thought of the consequences This thing has killed four people already Which was unfortunate But Spencer assures me its malfunctioning because it hasnt been permitted to follow its original programming Giving it the upgrade will cure that Once its installed youll have no control over it Were at war Reed If the computer acts unilaterally on occasion thats a small price to pay Anyway we programmed it Its on our side No dont bet on that Damn it Peterson thinks he can shut it down without losing any of the money and m gonna let him Youre forgetting yourself mister You do not have the authority But do m sorry sir have to go against you on this Say that again Grant And this time choose yourwords very carefully Yes sir m authorizing Peterson to shut it down If you so much as touch one key on that computer so help me God ll
