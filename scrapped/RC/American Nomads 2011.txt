This film contains some strong language Wanderlust Restlessness The urge to get out on the road and ride off into the sunset Its something deep and elemental in the American spirit Someone once asked Gertrude Stein to define America in a sentence And er conceive a space filled with moving Thats very much how think of America today This is a journey in search of American nomads People who live a life of constant travel Who are they and why do they choose to live this way Why are there so many of them especially in the American West first got to know them as a fellow traveller lived on the road for years and wrote a book about the nomadic tribes and cultures met along the way Now have a rented house in Tucson Arizona but cant seem to spend more than three weeks there or anywhere else without wanting leave Every time come home to you know the electricity bill and the gas bill and the internet bill and the phone bill and the cellphone bill and the water bill and the sewage bill and the credit card bill and the truck payment and the truck insurance and the renters insurance kind of remember about er all those years spent without an address Without any bills without any financial obligations um living in my truck um staying with friends spending a lot of time just sleeping on the ground That was my big ambition when was a young man to spend as many nights as possible sleeping in the dirt So lets get back out there These southwestern states are the best place to find nomads during the winter months but there are no guarantees You cant plan a journey like this Were looking for nomads and by definition theyre all on the move So were going to drift around on the highways and hope to cross paths with them have faith in the serendipity of the road but bad things can definitely happen Some of these nomads live outside the law Some of them will be armed some of them will be crazy Some of them hope will be sweet lovely and inspiring But its not an easy life out there You have a lot of freedom on the road but theres a much higher level of danger and hardship You get a little snapshot of roadside America here Truck Stop And um a good place to find hitchhikers You get motorhomes stopping through here Truckers stop to take a shower Take a rest And when the weathers a bit warmer you find well girls working these trucks um selling blowjobs and what have you ve spent a lot of time in truck stops like this And most of the time its perfectly calm and safe But things can happen so suddenly and unexpectedly Moments ago this hitchhiker just had a brush with death Give me a minute All right First he pulled out a knife started hitting me with it when it was collapsed Then he pulled out a gun At one point m screaming Help Help out the window thought was going to be dead ll never make the same mistake You carry a gun when you travel What sort of gun would be ideal big one big gun big one so nobody fucks with you You dont have to hit nothing with it Just start running Or pull out a bazooka dont m a Buddhist ve taken a vow of nonviolence And the guy was scary m bigger than him Why was he scary Agitation you know m going to find my dad tell him love him Tell him m stupid Go to church m going to go to church First time in years probably have to thank God m alive So he was hitchhiking and he got picked up by a crackhead woman and her jealous crackhead boyfriend Out came the knife and the gun And our Buddhist friend is lucky to be alive Not really the American road at its best but certainly a raw slice of it Man oh man even the Buddhists want guns out here They want bazookas Do or dont Is he armed and dangerous He looks old and tired so probably not His name is Shelton Parker and he apologises for the way he smells Hes years old gentleman of the road with some missing fingers and some skeletons in his closet dont put out my thumb just walk Sometimes somebody will pull up and ll say No m just walking thanks dont need a ride It depends what they look like get stopped by police officers all the time to check to make sure m not wanted nowhere ve been married five times and got two daughters and wasnt a good husband and a worse father so Tell me why you travel Um m just looking for a place want to stay And er havent found it yet guess m coming of age to where should should really start looking for something where m permanent but Yeah So did your travelling have anything to do with your five marriages not working Oh m sure of that What did your wives think of it Well all but one of them asked me to get married Four out of the five told every one of them said If you like me now youll like me later But if you dont like me now youre not going to like me later Cos m not changing m just the way am couple of years down the line Oh no you cant do that said Whoawhoa Lets go back to day one guess stubbornness probably has a lot to do with it do a lot of travelling ve been all over the United States Over the years you know In between marriages And er if cant have a good day and havent had a bad day out here on the road No matter whether its raining on me m soaking wet or freezing or hot and sweating ve never had a bad day out on the road rode with Shelton for miles He took a nap in the back and woke up when we arrived in El Paso Texas Go down See them towers Is that church steeples on the left over there No No No Yeah That way we wont be in front Come on out Hes here to collect a government cheque and then hes going miles across Texas because there might be temporary work there Hes a drifter essentially loner with chronic wanderlust ll give you my definition of a nomad which stole from a French philosopher nomad is someone who doesnt feel stable when stationary nomad feels stable when experiencing velocity Some of them go alone like Shelton others move around in tribes And the biggest tribe of nomads in America today perhaps unexpectedly are elderly and affluent They travel around in huge motorhomes also known as recreational vehicles or Vs Every winter tens of thousands of ers converge on the small town of Quartzsite Arizona There are parks in town with plugin electricity water and cable television and a huge expanse of surrounding desert where the more intrepid can camp for free were looking for the desert encampment of clubs They tend to all camp together and live quite a regimented life while theyre out here in the desert In particular were looking for those club members that do this fulltime People whove sold their houses said goodbye to their children and grandchildren and are now living this nomadic retirement It is an odd thing if you think about it m getting a bit of a glint on the roofs here think they should be down here to the left somewhere Theres a lot of desert here and they spread themselves far and wide Scapees Club Boondockers That sounds like a good place to start Boondocking is the ing term for camping without being hooked up to electricity water and sewage lines The guys who are fulltimers tend to do more boondocking than the parttimers Hi there Hi Are you all the boondockers Are you the boondockers Yeah this is the fire circle Were just over here visiting for the night this is their fire circle Yeah Its cocktail hour and it has the feel of a suburban garden party transplanted into the desert These people come squarely out of the mainstream of American society They worked hard paid their taxes and raised their families Then they reached retirement and they did something radical and unprecedented they sold their houses sunk the money into the most luxurious Vs they could afford said goodbye to their families and hit the road Doug and Sharon Henry are intending to spend everything they have on a wonderful freewheeling retirement and they joke about leaving zero to their children Their cost a quarter of a million dollars Wow Recessed lighting What is this Thats like a granite countertop Its a fauxgranite countertop And it extends out so you can seat four people Got your comfortable chairs Very comfortable This makes into a bed Four slides two in the front and two in the bedroom It slides out into about square feet in here Youve got the refrigerator with the freezer below with icemaker Oh wow All runs off of battery if you want it to Got an generator in it to keep the batteries up so its just like home It certainly is Very nice Four televisions in it three inside and one outside Got a nice queensized bed and have an option for a king if you want to Big wardrobe closet washerdryer Wow Closets The bed lifts up For storage a huge storage area down here That was to be the wine cellar at the moment but Got central air conditioning two zones one for the bedroom one for the living area Its got hydronic heating so its continuous hot water Its roughing it Roughing it out here in the desert Quartzsite style Nomads are always hard to count but the best estimate is that million Americans are now roaming around permanently in Vs and that of them are over the age of These Vs are parked in a big circle around the campfire in the same way that the pioneers crossing the plains would circle their wagons at night We just wanted to go adventuring We cant explain it What happened to the house you lived in We sold it We wanted to start ing and we kept our house for about a year and a half just to make sure we liked the lifestyle After about a year and a half we decided we would like to continue doing this It was convenient to sell the house at that time So that freed us of that connection Its been really good for us Its made us a lot closer We spend hours a day together and we still like each other The ers are also known as snowbirds Theyre whitehaired and they migrate south in winter to these warm dry deserts and they make their way slowly north again when the deserts get too hot They drop in on their grandchildren once or twice a year Theyve really untethered themselves from family responsibility any obligations at all feel a bit envious of these snowbirds It seems so damn pleasant sitting on your lawn chair In that winter sun nothing much to do all day See your friends look forward to cocktail hour They seem extraordinarily content ve heard that a travelling preacher has just arrived ve never met one before but ve read about them in novels and history books and they always sounded like strange and intriguing characters Hes pitched his tent on the edge of town and agreed to meet me in his motorhome His name is Joe Ferguson Hello inside Come in All right Come right on in All right m years old got saved at God taught me for eight years before done anything Praise the Lord And at years old started in the tent ministry Praise the Lord My wife went home to be with the Lord in January of The th of January So ve been alone just over a year but ve never backed off just keep on trucking This right here is a mansion compared to what we started out in When my wife and went on the road we had a foot trailer We lived in that trailer with a wife and a young boy homeschooling him and we lived in that for seven and a half years What you see is what am The most gorgeous white and purple tent and its beautiful its gorgeous But everything you see has been given to us Its by the hand of God We do probably meetings a year for the past years and am still as on fire even maybe more so than was in the beginning Because the Lord said the latter house will be greater than the former You know whats good For brethren to dwell together And am so glad that the Lord drew you here tonight Reach over and tell somebody youre not here by chance Youre here by opportunity Praise the Lord Glory be to Him The travelling tent ministry is an American institution that arose in the th century in response to a transient population on the frontiers It made no sense for a preacher to build himself a church when the souls he wanted to save were on the move When the next boomtown might spring up anywhere and go bust just as quickly So preachers started travelling with tents Some of them were hucksters dispensing snake oils and using shills in the audience to demonstrate their miraculous healing powers Others were staunchly devout men of God like Joe Ferguson here always say it like this If you dont have Jesus in your life try Him Were going to open up You come up here and line up across here Those of you that have a need Those of you that need healing restoration If you need a jumpstart in your life come up Come up and receive prayer Youll be amazed at the change that the layingon of hands will do in your life Thank you Jesus Take a deep breath Jesus thank you Glory be to God Say me too look at Preacher Joe and see some sort of deep American wellspring Hes part ScotchIrish and part Osage Indian throwback to those frontier preachers but in a motorhome rather than a covered wagon Hell be here for a few weeks and then hell pack up the tent and move on He goes to Indian reservations to preach to the alcoholics He used to be a bad alcoholic himself He was an underground hard rock miner a boozer and a brawler and you can see that same tough belligerent quality about him now He stands there in his snakeskin boots as if daring Satan to try him Say yes Lord have come to receive In the name of Jesus Take a deep breath Later that night an caught fire dont know how it started a mixture of cruel fate and complicated electrical systems Noone was hurt or killed but it was the end of the road for this snowbird And here is the charred remains of a book about the joys of ing Its about grilling up Grilling up a meal outside your in Alaska Your propane heat your microwave oven your refrigeratorfreezer Very sad Its funny what the fire has spared Everything is almost unrecognisable but its spared this story about living a free and easy carefree life in this book Desert nomads used to keep moving to find water and grazing Now people wander these deserts to find happiness or escape or to look for themselves And for the sheer pleasure of moving through these landscapes Theres another big tribe in America that travels basically as an act of rebellion Halfpunk halftramp they call themselves travelling kids Others call them gutter punks or oogles and an oogles dog is called a doogle Meet Elizabeth Kevin and Bill emerging from the shade of a railroad bridge in Arizona Its late morning and theyre already well into their stash of beer and vodka The dogs name is Dude Sure why not Two in the back one in the passenger seat This could be interesting They want a ride to Yuma Arizona down on the Mexican border where they intend to hop a freight train going east Why east No particular reason The destination doesnt matter The important thing is to keep moving away from responsibilities lowwage jobs and family life so bad in the case of Bill and Elizabeth that the whole idea of home is a sick joke to them How was it you started travelling in the first place When was young m going to say it because thats really what happened My molested me when was a kid So pretty much grew up and was like woah thats wrong This shouldnt be happening Then told my mom and my mom told my dad and my dad kicked my out And so for some reason my dad always holds a grudge over him kicking out but its not my fault My dads weird so he thinks it is my fault left when was and the first thing got on was a freight train Anybody for coffee Anybody for beer Beer Cerveza All right Bill is a selfharmer and a runaway and his mother he says tried to get him locked up in a mental institution Elizabeth and Kevin are a couple ve been on the road for two and a half years shes been on the road for five Five years m m old m only When was the last time you saw your mom Last year Last year My dads really against my lifestyle but my mom shes used to it already Like every time see her tell her about my travels and stuff My mom is a fat piece of shit hate her Actually really do She sucks Like her house its just garbage everywhere It goes up the walls Its so horrible ll go there and ll be like woah Mom What the hell Its horrible You get grossed out by the hygiene that your mom displays Yes Shes disgusting would run away when was and take off and they would come get me in Kentucky and shit and bring me back And then would run away again theyd come get me ran away a bunch My parents hate my parents They screwed me over man like my life more now Like these people are my family meet these people on the road m like theyre my family You hate your life so you go places Yeah Does it work It does They sleep rough and scrounge for their food in dumpsters They work odd jobs and beg for money and spend most of it on alcohol tobacco and dog food You can see similar types in any city in Britain The big difference here is that theyre fully nomadic They travel hundreds of miles a week by hitchhiking and illegally hopping the freight trains Its not a life that most of us would envy or recommend but its one theyve chosen kind of reckless debauched adventure leading who knows where Come here Bill Come here Bill Get over here buddy Billy Come on come on dropped them off by the train tracks in Yuma Arizona wished them well and they told me about a big gathering of travelling anarchists hippies and misfits a few hours away in the California desert Its some kind of abandoned Marine base they said and its name is Slab City This is the Mojave desert one of the hottest and driest in the world Hell on Earth in summer but pleasant and warm now in winter When this was a Marine base there were buildings here Now the buildings have been torn down but the concrete slabs remain Hence Slab City Its pretty ratty and squalid straggle of trailers and caravans and Vs Looks like some encampment on an alien crash site If it was in a city it would be a block of squats but instead its sprawled out over the desert in trailers And wrecked school buses The two great advantages of this place are that its free to live here and its virtually lawless There are plenty of guns and drugs around But the police stay away most of the time and the ownership of this ground is tied up in some seemingly endless legal dispute In the meantime what you have here is a a Temporary Autonomous Zone that exists outside the rules of society and the law Its right next to a military gunnery range a patch of ground that noone else wants Its lit up by tracer fire and missiles at night and subject to regular explosions during the day Hi there m just looking for a place to camp Any rules here Well no huh Just dont aggravate your neighbours raise hell after nine or ten oclock at night we cant encourage that Theres not really any rules as such If a place is occupied dont try to push em out You might get hurt Yeah yeah How you doing Hi there Just thought d bring you up some flyers from our talent show here Talent show Saturday night Slab City Yeah we got the talent show there All right Thats freakin chillin man Sweet Slab city is a mishmash a messy experiment in American anarchy that forms every winter and dissolves every summer when this desert turns into a furnace and everyone heads north Its not a place want to spend the winter but find it strangely reassuring that such a place is able to exist Suns rising came to me and said head off You dont want a bunch of dead people following you around You see m gone Cool that means theyre not in my head After six hours at the talent show head back to my campsite and fall into a conversation with the guy camped next to me His name is Ted Koons He is a fulltime nomad who dropped out of the mainstream and now roams America and Latin America in his jeep Like me it was mainly curiosity that brought him to Slab City Well like a lot of American kids when was in my late teens and early s had a lot of ambition disease So went to work in that corporate game and went to New York City and went to work on Wall Street The truth is dont tell people Wall Street any more use the term institutional finance Because that doesnt sound nearly as disgusting as Wall Street Aint that true So kind of hide behind that but spent about years in that business And like many of my colleagues knew the end would come someday so was banking away the cash like a caveman hiding as much meat as possible before the winter sets in knew the winter would set in sooner or later so when my friends were buying Porsches was taking the subway And managed to save up enough money to buy nice things and be free and not be depending on anyone or anything So from Wall Street to the slabs The slabs Yeah thats quite a path Rather zigzaggy You know you leave Wall Street and its kind of like leaving a beautiful woman You kind of think youd like to get back into that if you can because thats some pretty good stuff right But the fact is never belonged there in the first place and was always a pretender Secretly m an Idaho redneck But actually got through that game and since then the last three years ve wandered around havent spent much time anywhere ve done all kinds of silly jobs purely for fun mostly The income is nice not to spend the money saved But during that time ve lived in five or six states and visited or countries So you just rolled into Slab City today First impressions m impressed lot of guys living in trailers its kind of a weird idea and theres certainly a lot of ugly people Wild thing You make my heart sing When you see these people living in dilapidated trailers some people might see that as a sign of some sort of sad experience but see it as a sign of an open expression of freedom When you live in a trailer youre not paying property taxes and you can move on any time you want That is the idea of freedom that so many people dont truly grasp Its this freedom of the Wild West The freedom of the Wild West All those nomadic horsemen used to roam around here Cowboys and Indians Furtrappers and frontiersmen Those pioneering families who kept packing up everything into a wagon and moving on It wasnt that long ago and it left behind a powerful legacy You dont meet many families out on the road but ran into this couple Derek and Amy Theyre out on the road with their kids living in a school bus m eager to hear what its like So this is your home on wheels Our home on wheels Its a decommissioned school bus And how long have you had it Weve only had it for four months now We had a motorhome before Were in the middle of converting This is a work in progress Yes Very much a work in progress We basically got a motorhome instead of having a big wedding So But yeah we just travelled for a long time he was young enough where he didnt have to start school for a few years and just recently traded in for the bus And how will the education work Hes getting so much of an education being out here and hes learning the basics so far Learning so much about the outside and outdoors and plants and animals the same kind of stuff you would be doing reading a book except its first hand Do you find that a lot of people have wrong ideas and misconceptions about being a family on the road Yes definitely Depending on where you go they vary from good ones where people are Wow thats awesome were so intrigued that you guys are doing this its such an inspiring thing And then you go other places and people are more closedminded and they think its weird that there is no way to give a child a wellbalanced education when youre doing this Theres no way And not even just that but how could you do it How could you possibly be happy Living on a bus Thats the main one usually Wondering you know thinking hes missing out because he doesnt get movies and doing all the stuff that we did when we were living in a house Do you ever think back to covered wagons and Yes The whole drive out here it just seems so Whoever told you that you had to stay in the same place your whole life Why were we taught since we were young that we go to school we settle down we get a job we have a family and we stay put What might you want to do when you grow up want to Be a truck driver Want to be a policeman Derek and Amy seem so happy and fulfilled as a family on the road You dont see that much remember a truck driver who drove around with his wife and kid in a truck He wasnt a dropout or a dream chaser He had to keep moving to make a living Thats a whole other category of nomads The working nomads Fruit pickers and itinerant carpenters Circus and fairground people The ones know best are rodeo cowboys and they travel harder than anybody Rodeo is a kind of travelling carnival And right now theyre setting up an event in the small gambling town of Laughlin Nevada a days drive north of Slab City The cowboys are in a tent behind the arena Theyre taping themselves up so their arm muscles dont get ripped in two when they ride Its a life of constant travel and serious amounts of physical pain Getting on the back of an angry horse or an enraged bull is a terrible thing to do to your body Serious injuries are commonplace and cowboys do get killed occasionally right there in the arena like gladiators Tommy McFarlane rides the bucking broncos Hes one of the toughest and one of the best He drove miles straight through to get here and he doesnt consider this hard driving When did you get into here About half an hour ago minutes ago Thats about what hours on the road to get here We didnt drive very fast About hours guess How did you get into rodeo Is it a ranch family Yeah was just raised on a ranch guess mean that dont necessarily make a rodeo guy but was raised on a ranch so was always riding horses and cowboying and stuff so when we got a little older we started junior rodeo Mom and Dad took us to junior rodeo and we just kind of got into it that way Its a fun way to live What are some of the injuries youve had Shit See dislocated my elbow right out the back of my arm at Calgary come back from that rode for another while went to Pecos was getting ready and the horse flipped over on me That raised two bones up into my hand and then they went back down Long story short flipped over again this guy came up sitting on his butt and just went on it and broke it in places They fixed that all that up that was quite a while before was able to come back come back from that went to Houston broke my finger and all my bones across my foot And come back from that things were going pretty good and tore my bicep off my arm and rolled it up They sewed that back down and ve been rodeoing ever since Its all in the game Thats two wild cowboys there Theyre coming in from other rodeos in Texas and Oklahoma and Atlantic City New Jersey Tobaccochewing Wade Sundell is a young harddrinking upandcoming star in the small closed world of saddle bronc riding So how did it go in Atlantic City case of beer and six bottles of wine feel good today though Now ve taken the day off You had a day off drinkin drank wine freakin kicked me in the butt now Theres a definite tribal identity to these cowboys Look at their body language the way they talk and greet each other They travel all the time but they never leave the world of rodeo and cattle ranching Everyone in this world wears the same uniform and the media cant get into a rodeo without putting on cowboy hats and boots Rodeo is a multimillion dollar televised sport in America now rising in popularity and the television rights are strictly controlled For this event they keep our cameras behind the scenes but well catch Tommy and Wade in action at the next rodeo down the road in Logandale Nevada once spent six weeks driving around America with three rodeo cowboys They were young and wild drinking like crazy taking a lot of drugs hardly ever sleeping It nearly killed me and wasnt riding bulls or bucking horses One of those cowboys is dead now He got gored in the chest by a bull in the arena Another one is in prison for assault Noone seems to know what happened to the third guy but seriously doubt there was a happy ending All right action time This is the Clark County Summer Fair and Rodeo in Logandale Nevada Theres winedrinkin Wade Sundell with a feather in his hat And theres Tommy McFarlane Theyve all just arrived half an hour before their events start Does that banner yet wave er the land of the free And the home of the brave All right Put your hands on the beat come on put your hands up These are unbroken horses bred to buck Riding them is a kind of dance that gets scored out of The horse gets marked out of for the way it bucks Its supposed to try everything it knows to get that cowboy off its back The cowboy tries to stay on the horse for eight seconds while spurring it and holding one arm aloft Toms got no saddle or stirrups just a handle tied onto the horses back with a strap Lets hear it for Wade great guy great football player Right now we got Tommy MacFarlane Hes goin hell for leather Gee Never had a spread so buckin enormous What an amazing cowboy After breaking his arm in places he put out his knee in Houston a year ago but when that guy stays healthy hes well for riding a buckin horse Riding a very high Puttin in a score of points good ride from Tommy points might win him some money Next up is Will Lowe Tommys travelling partner and a threetime world champion Horse is called Ladies Man They travel around in a white Chevy van with two other cowboys and they call themselves The Wolf Pack Get your hands going to the beat of the music Go on Willy Folks there he is Threetime world champion threetime Calgary champ Its Americas original extreme sport invented by working cowboys in the s to make a contest out of their skill at breaking wild horses His name is Will Lowe How many days a year are you on the road Over It varies there was a couple years where was hurt and stuff for a couple months so quite a few less rodeos but would say on average probably to days a year My office is where make it What did you think would happen to you if you tried to work a to type job wouldnt enjoy it very much could do it but wouldnt like it But you wouldnt blow a gasket No wouldnt blow a gasket But wouldnt enjoy it very much Itd actually be work This is fun Check out the horse How many of yall like that bucking horse This guy won the World Championship Next out of the bucking shoots comes winedrinking Wade Wade Sundell That guy can play into the back of the saddle Come on everybody Wade Sundell Second in the national finals second twice in Houston tell you you can bet on this kid Score comes up out of for Wade Sundell points Everybody told me that horse is a pretty nice horse and everything But she was strong and just kept on gassing on trying to get to the front and hopefully it all worked out probably did How many points What sort of money are you looking at Well shoot dont know suppose if win it this rodeod pay about or so And then m winning Pocatello and theyll probably pay that too Youre on a streak had a good weekend Hopefully theyll both hold out for me Then m just going to drink beer in Arizona and chase wild cows For a week If can afford the cash m ready to do so Where yall from England Thats just like America but different aint it Exactly Theyre having a ball years old riding from rodeo to rodeo Drive for nine hours at mph buck for eight seconds at a million mph win some money get on down the road Theyre just loving it They love the life its written all over their faces isnt it The first Europeans in the American West were the Spanish conquistadors and settlers They came up from Mexico on horses and these were the first horses that American Indians had ever seen In time horses got away from the Spaniards and established wild herds In the early s Indians learned to catch horses and ride them And a golden age of nomadism began Here in Nevada there are still herds of wild horses Their ancestors got away from Indian tribes cowboys cattle ranches and the Cavalry Theyre a living symbol of the Wild West and some of them are directly descended from the horses that the Spanish brought Normally you see wild horses at a distance if at all But here in the Joshua Tree Forest outside Cold Creek Nevada get lucky Horses revolutionised life for the Indian tribes in the West changing their whole conception of speed and distance Lacking a word for these new animals the Sioux called them holy dogs Mounted on horseback they could travel miles per day and gallop alongside a running buffalo instead of watching it recede into the distance Before the horse arrived most of the Western tribes had practised farming and lived in huts Now they began a nomadic life on horseback following the buffalo herds around and living in tepees For bringing us the horse said John Fire Lame Deer of the Sioux tribe we could almost forgive the white man for bringing us whisky Its going to be cold tonight It looks like Afghanistan or Theres more mountains in Nevada than any other state More wild horses and my contention is more lunatics as well but were well away from them we keep them down in Vegas The rest of Nevada is just a big wild wideopen place This elevation can hit or degrees during the day and then at night itll get below freezing When first came to the American West saw this beautiful thing outside my car window called it scenery and sometimes stopped to take a photograph of it Then started walking out into it scared at first to be in such a big wild place Thats good enough Slowly became more comfortable and started going out there for days and sometimes weeks at a time slept under the stars and bathed in the rivers and paid very close attention to the animals and birds and plants This wasnt scenery anymore but a living breathing place full of mystery and wonder still cant get it out of my system So was having a quiet moment savouring a beer at sunset in that perfect silence you sometimes get in the desert Then heard an engine coming towards me across country It was a guy on some kind of dirt bike a moment of totally random American weirdness He said his name was Ray and he told a long garbled story It seems his family are polygamist Mormons from Mexico and they dumped him out here in the desert So how long have you been here Here Yeah Two days No three days My dad came from the He went down there on a search for the religion to find God He did that for a while and he moved around the United States and preached about the downfall of the United States for a long time He seems lonely confused jumpy And his stories get more and more agitated and incomprehensible Thats what figured until somebody walked up a little while ago wondering where the fuck his bike was with a big metal pipe on him Wheres my bike Dude have no fucking idea helped the fucking guy out At a gas station helped him pick up his bike and put it on his truck and have no idea He got off the truck with a big old pipe like that Wheres my bike dont know might have to get violent with you didnt tell him nothing But he looked at me guess youre not the person guess theres trouble everywhere So feel really bad for Ray last night was kind of trying to get away from him because he was crazy And didnt know whether he was going to flip over into violence He seemed poised on the edge there But the poor guy just doesnt stand a chance Hes crazy hes lonely He doesnt have any money just feel really bad for him He doesnt have anything Didnt look like hes eaten much Thats just about as hard as it gets Someone asked Johnny Depp to sum up America He said All appetite no taste Las Vegas is only miles away from the wild horses And a more extreme contrast is hard to imagine The first casinos were built here by a gangster with big dreams in the s And he borrowed so much money to build them that the Mob put a bullet in his eye The mafia ran Vegas for decades but now its all corporate Two million people live here permanently and this city in the desert is expected to run out of water in less than years For me Las Vegas is a place to get through m heading east into the highlands of Utah up above the snow line hoping to find some buffalo Oh Almost hit a golden eagle Just literally flew inches over the windshield m extremely glad did not hit that golden eagle Somewhere up this road theres supposed to be a herd of buffalo The American buffalo also known as the American bison is the largest mammal on this continent Its a symbol of the American West and of American roaming The herds were always moving migrating with the seasons and this why the tribes that hunted them became nomadic Bison are now restricted to a few national parks and a growing number of private ranches like this one million is the accepted number for how many bison used to roam the West And they were wiped out in less than years by hide hunters thereby depriving the Plains Indians of their livelihood And then those million bison which were reduced to think less than animals were replaced by million cattle And some people in the West now think that the whole thing was basically a mistake that cattle are not nearly as well suited to this environment as the bison These guys can give birth without the assistance of vets they have good immunity to the various diseases that are endemic here they can make it through the winter without supplemental feed they can survive the below storms You see they have these big head and shoulders and when the blizzards come they face them straight on like this whereas cows kind of turn tail and it gets too cold the cattle die They are perfectly adapted to this environment Theyve evolved out here Now were starting to see them come back mainly because the meat is so good Its lowfat high protein tasty red meat In the three weeks since last saw him Ted the Wall Street refugee has driven down to Mexico and back Hes been to New York and all over Idaho Wyoming and Utah Hes had transitory relationships with a number of different women Now hes come to meet me at a remote campground in the high desert of Western Colorado and hes brought some buffalo steaks Oh man This is good living huh Oh man These are really good What do your family think of your wandering ways your appearance and what have you Have you got brothers and sisters dont had a brother but he died about years ago and my parents that onus falls on me you know the legacy the next generation And if had one wish wish could make my parents happy you know the only thing know how to tell them is m pretty happy and thats the only answer at the end of the day But if could flip a switch and somehow have the life have now and the picket fence and the children raising up the next generation would do it really would Just only for my parents for their You being happy is not going to cut it compared to grandkids For my mother just havent delivered m telling her its not her fault She did a great job She did a great job How old are you m m just turned a couple of months ago Plenty of time really got it figured got years at my pace That could still happen But yeah as a nomad if had one wish wish could make my parents as pleased as they deserve to be Man weve got weather coming in Woah When the wind blows the desert just stands up on its hind legs Goddamn Goddamn So Ted came over a bit maudlin in his cups last night know how he feels but pull yourself together man This wandering life is supposed to be the pursuit of happiness not a lifelong commitment to the road When you meet the right woman and want to settle down and start cranking out kids just buck up and do it Thats my plan anyway All in good time You dont always have to be that John Wayne figure riding away from the picket fence into the sunset People have the idea that the West was won by heroic cowboys and that kind of thing They get this idea from movies and mythology but the key factor in the taming of the West were number one disease Microbes smallpox thats what really wiped out the nomadic tribes on the plains was these diseases they had no resistance to And another really important factor was the invention of barbed wire fences Fences restricted the free movement of animals and people and enforced the new idea of private property The nomadic Indian tribes hated fences So did the nomadic trail cowboys who had grazed their herds up and down the plains Now the damn things are everywhere Dont get me started on Goddamn fences This whole country has been divided up its had its spirit torn up brutalised by fences Youve got your fivestrand barbed wire fence sevenstrand barbed wire fence you got your round topped fences picket fences Goddamn round top split rail fences m talking about galvanised tube or steel fences Dont get me started on the fence So the era of horseback nomads came to an end The tribes were corralled on reservations railroads came bringing the iron horse and in time the railroads produced a new and distinct American form of nomadism Transient labourers started riding the freight trains as a way to get from one harvest to the next They were called hobos and their hungry heyday was the Great Depression of the s After the Great Depression America forgot about the hobos and tramps on its freight trains but they never went away At best guess people are still riding around on Americas freight trains used to do it myself Most train hoppers today are under the age of ve found one hitchhiking by the side of the road in Western Colorado a young kid out on his own Well howdy there m Comfrey Comfrey ve never met a Comfrey before Yeah neither have Its a bit of a unique name m glad to call it my birth name So how come youre out on the road travel off and on For years ve been doing travelling off and on Really hard the last three years but before that ve been homeless off and on since was about m currently now But just like dont know its absolute freedom in a lot of ways Within limitations of the law The only problems ever have is someone trying to take my stuff or take advantage of me or the cops harassing me Other than that its complete freedom Freedom from what Um life in a box Life in a box Sitting in an office to in front of a computer letting my brain rot and listening to the humming Zzzzzzzzz In some ways m addicted to travelling and being on the road m always looking for that next great adventure to replace that last one that just passed by At the next lake youre going to want to take a right Do you feel connected to any kind of historical tradition of transient America mean a little bit due to the current days and ages of where we are We are in the second Great Depression that this countrys faced and in the first Great Depression that was the golden era of hobos guess youd call it This is a squat that people actually use They cut a hole in the fence and they go way back there in that patio area for the train to go west So they sit out here and just wait for it kind of hiding in the back just wait for a train We are in the gritty Western town of Grand Junction Colorado right by the side of the train tracks So usually if people are going to be hopping this area theyll be coming in late after dark probably coming to spend a couple hours just sitting and waiting Theres still actually some hopper tags up here Lets have a look Good old Luc Puc Whats going on with this tag This is some travelling kids tag Youve got your train tracks and then you have some kind of severed leg Hopefully they didnt lose their leg getting on How do you stop your leg getting severed like that The trick use getting on a train count the lug nuts on the wheel If can count every nut and actually see every nut on the train then personally feel its not moving that fast its moving at a speed that feel comfortable getting on at Anything after that is where youre going to lose a leg or an arm And how is it that it happens exactly the severing You get caught under the wheels man Youre trying to hop up climb up or whatever you just kind of get sucked in because of this momentum and the wind builds down and out so youre getting pulled down and under so you get sucked in And theyll just cut it off and cauterise it right there grinding metal on metal That trick with the lug nuts is a hobo trick that was passed on to me by oral tradition when first started riding Any other tips for riding the trains Keep a knife and something blunt mean the knifes more an intimidation thing If start to get a sketchy vibe from somebody if m hitchhiking or something ll just start cleaning my fingernails and so forth Smileys an improvised weapon thats blunt and kinda scary But you have a full wrap on it dont know its definitely kept me out of some situations d rather scare somebody than hurt them more than anything If can scare someone out of a sketchy situation then thats better than actually having to come to blows You dont rape you dont steal otherwise you will end up floating down the river or duct taped to a train Youre not welcome in this if you break these small ethic Its morals mean thats all travelling rules are is a best set of morals mean we all have them Yeah Itll be a sad day when you dont see anyone trying to make it from place to place with their thumb or hopping a train That was something remember as a kid just sitting by the riverbank and watching the train roll by and seeing a couple of kids or old guys just sitting on the back of the train or in a boxcar or whatever and just wave on Thatll be a sad day when m if make it through my tramping days and dont see that any more rode freight trains because wanted to see what it was like wanted to enter that other world It really is a tough way to travel nearly froze to death in Montana in a boxcar once was riding with a bunch of Vietnam vet hobos and they all had dogs stuffed down in their sleeping bags to keep them warm didnt That was the last time got on a freight train and cant say that miss it Lets order some breakfast m hungry d like two eggs over easy with hash browns uh toast and a side of green chilli How would you like your eggs Over easy And ll have the sausage please So your dad abandoned you at a greyhound when you were Whats the deal with your dad dont know too busy getting high Hes an old hippie stoner whos been dealing drugs as long as can remember Its kind of why my mom left him Hes an old travelling deadhead guess its kind of in my genetics like my mom was an old punk rocker that ran away from home when she was about mean shes always been there but working hours a week trying to support me so it was always really difficult So you were left alone a lot Yeah pretty much between the age of seven and five had to learn how to take care of myself learn to start cooking wake up every morning go to school come home theres nobody home make myself dinner do my homework go to bed till got kicked out Right that should feed you up you been getting square meals Cans of ravioli apple sauce whatever can dumpster Whatever soup kitchen feeds up for the day You could stand to put on a little weight there Yeah m definitely nothing but skin and bones Thats why have to wear suspenders and a belt Skinny white boy disease Thank you You seem pretty tough emotionally Is that a facade Or is that real little bit of both Um d like to think have a very strong personality in a lot of ways ve seen people break at a lot of less stress but a lot of times just got to keep going until can lay down and sleep and then might cry myself to sleep or whatever else happens but mean my dreams get crushed on a regular basis month or two ago thought was moving to Durango to go live with my girlfriend and about two weeks ago found out this isnt going to happen so that was my plan for the last six months eventually was to go So now Were you in love with her d like to think so but m dont know what love is This is the first time ve felt this way about anyone so d like to think its love mean The train leaves out of here every night theres at least one train At this point it doesnt matter where go East or West Once again my lifes completely open to me just met Comfrey the day before yesterday but find myself worrying about him in kind of a fatherly way know what its like out on the rails its dangerous and illegal and rough as hell There are knife fights different gangs of tramps and hobos who fight each other People get thrown off moving trains people get ducttaped to moving trains so the tape gradually works loose as the train picks up speed told Comfrey to be careful and he said Yeah right tried to give him money and he said No thanks He went east went west to the Sierra Nevada mountains in California They go miles north to south and theyre about miles wide Theyve got glaciers and bears and the peaks are well above metres love mountains but always feel slightly uneasy here mainly because have a fear of heights m here to meet a legend Richard Bear nicknamed Yogi has been wandering these mountains for years Hes climbed nearly all the peaks He lives by himself in a tent and he never camps in the same place for long To get a message to Yogi someone had go miles up into the mountains on snowshoes and then come miles back down with the answer The answer was yes Yogi has agreed to meet me was expecting some kind of shaggy grizzly wild man but Yogi is smooth clean polished Clearly no stranger to shampoo razors or toothpaste All the climbers and park rangers who spend time in these mountains have stories about him Hes the king of the backcountry a true modernday mountain man and the first thing he says is Lets go Follow me The story goes that he first came here to commit suicide He spent the night intending to jump off a milehigh cliff in the morning but woke up awestruck by the beauty and grandeur of the mountains You were seriously thinking about walking off a cliff Ah well Yeah that was in my head Thats for sure can eliminate my in debt And my lack of being married and having all those kids by just stepping off El Capitan you know got dropped off here The car drove away had something like in my wallet and my tent and in about half a days time hadnt felt so content in years maybe ever in my adult life at that point just loved it Hes never looked back Hes lived out of a backpack ever since What does he do for money He works seasonal jobs in and around the mountains But a job is something to quit in order to Yeah its an end to a means for sure It makes me enough money so can take off for a few months But have never had any monetary goals dont want to save enough money to buy a brandnew car that kind of thing As soon as ve got dont have to work for three months What does he do for love He has shortterm relationships with the young women who come here to work in the summers These seasonal relationships There have been quite a few There have been some wouldve loved to have continued for ever but m not willing to give this up and move to Yeah At least in my life it turns out that love doesnt conquer all not even close But these relationships start really quickly because you dont have much time All those feelings all the stuff it happens fast and then its gone And then comes heartbreak maybe You must have had a few of them Quite a few of them So how do you deal with heartbreak guess just kind of embrace it know when get into something like that its going to be gone soon and that helps a lot too And anyone that may be with is fully aware that m going to be here in my tent regardless of what may develop If they wanted to stay thatd be just fine sometimes Other times m glad the three months is over to be honest with you Yogi wants to take me through this forest of giant Sequoia trees and up to the nearest peak So youve got lost up here before Um like to say that m not lost just dont always know where the trail is know which canyon m in and it does get tricky sometimes Out of nowhere a heavy mist comes in If was on my own d be turning around now going back down towards safety but Yogi seems completely unconcerned Then the mist clears as suddenly as it came in and were standing on a very high exposed fin of rock looking down at the clouds and the valley floor a vertical mile beneath us If fall off here Yogi tells me it will take a full minute to reach the ground This is the very last thing want to hear cant make it get vertigo in places like this This is as far as m going to start to wobble and kind of clench up So this is as far as m going to go This is still the front country for me Kind of the front yard m heading out to the back yard out that way would love to join you just dont have it in me Thats home for me actually count on most people feeling the same way you do Keeps it good for me Keep the riffraff out wouldnt call it riffraff but Thats where m going How long would you go up there for How long are you going up there for Two weeks usually First day is here third day go over the great Western divide that wall out there then the bigger peaks are out beyond that So thats kind of your front entrance Mmhm ve climbed all the higher of the named peaks in this Great Western Divide up north a long way and ve been working my way out toward the far eastern side of the park So ve got about five days out five days back and two days to bag a peak or two out there along the way Well wish you a fine adventure but youre on your own partner count on that count on that Thank you Richard All right Adios Bye And hes gone Back into the frozen wilderness and absolutely delighted about it Hes passionately in love with these mountains man at peace with himself a happy nomad And thats all folks Weve rambled around the American Southwest for miles and if you trace the journey on a map it looks like a daddy longlegs smashed up against a wall Conclusions Dont jump to one People with bad upbringings sometimes become wanderers and so do people from good upbringings Loners wander and so do couples Weak people take to the road and so do the strong People wander to find beauty or because God told them to travel with a tent or because tomorrows rodeo is in a different town But ultimately people wander in America because they can The space and possibility exists That nice young couple Derek and Amy split up soon after we left them He went to Tennessee She kept the child the dog and the school bus and found herself a new boyfriend at the slabs Preacher Joe went on from Quartzsite Arizona to Lake Isabella California where he caught himself a pound trout Right there Thats a number one bait Praise the Lord Now hes moving north into Canada a fisher of men and a fisher of fish Hi Baby Hello Oh hey whats going on Will and Tom the rodeo cowboys are still driving miles a week in Wills van So far this year theyve won between them Hey darlin Oh were pulling into a gas station Ted is travelling harder than ever The longest road in North America is the one to Panama and hes given himself two months to drive down there and back Yogi is back up in the high Sierras communing with the wilderness reading a book about Siberian tigers and listening to baseball every night on a pocket radio Last heard from Comfrey he was out on the rails check his Facebook page from time to time and its been more than a month since he updated it And me Hi this is Richard m not around right now Leave a message and ll get back to you when can mail subtitlingbbc co uk
