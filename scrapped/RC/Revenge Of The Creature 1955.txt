Steam Whistle Obi we anchor here We stay here tonight Nardo We go to the Black Lagoon in the morning fix you some supper now What are we having tonight Oh big surprise What we didnt finish last night What d give for a tall cold beer Or a short warm blonde The Gill Man prehistoric monster Maybe theres no such thing You find him mister ll catch him It doesnt look good for a conservative institution like Ocean Harbor to circus a yarn and then not to deliver If youre smart you wont worry about it If there is a Gill Man well catch him If its a phony well the boss is out his dough George Growling Hey Lucas Yes Mr Johnson Joe Ah its a crocodile Huh you think maybe that is it Oh no the thing you are looking for can break that in two You know sometimes think all North Americanos are crazy If he is dead you waste your money If hes alive maybe you be sorry you find him Yeah There isnt a fish alive cant handle Who says hes a fish What a character This sweatbox Doesnt it ever cool off here Never You want to go back At your service Not till we get the the whatever it is Then well go back He wont rest easy till hes got it in the tank back at Ocean Harbor What for do you want to do this So people can come and stare at the manfish To please some crazy scientists For this youre going to risk your lives Who said anything about risking lives Its a job technical job Oh Maybe then you got a book that going to tell you how to do this thing Now look were not paying you to make jokes No joke Tomorrow we gonna be in the lagoon You will go down in the water Then is no longer time for talking so maybe is better we talk now huh Okay go ahead Last year came to this place with a party of scientists Also brave and highly technical people In the end five persons were dead The Gill Man still there Were they equipped for the capture No Well we are So like to ask you something m not very educated person This Gill Man this thing have seen with my eyes it it doesnt belong in our world It shouldve died out long before man was born Still it exists Why Well ll try to explain it to you Sometimes a species gets isolated in time If the conditions are right it reproduces itself without change skipping a chapter of evolution Way back there must have been some major link between marine and terrestrial life Its just possible that this is it Well thats all there is to it Uhhuh Now tell you what believe This beast exists because it is stronger than than the thing that you call evolution In it is some force of life demon driving it through millions of centuries It does not surrender so easily to weaklings like you and me This is the thing that you hunt for Think on it Good night gentlemen Well And that kiddies is our fairy story for tonight Joe maybe hes right Back in Florida You dont suppose that they expect us to lose our lives over this thing Maybe we got no business to be here at all Want to play some cards No No think ll try to get some sleep You better do the same Oh ll

goes nothin Well no sign of him Maybe this time we are lucky and he is dead huh There he is Whats this Where George By golly youre right There he is Come on Lucas lets go get him Always have the bad luck Be sure you tie him up good This is the first telephoto of the fantastic find received from Rio deJaneiro The creature is in a coma Has been ever since its capture in an isolated Amazon lagoon Right now its being flown to Floridas famed Ocean Harbor Oceanarium where the experts hope to restore it to consciousness Movement of the creature has required some splitsecond timing It can exist out of water for only a few minutes at a stretch The capture of the Gill Man has created the greatest scientific stir since the explosion of the atomic bomb Further information is anxiously awaited in colleges and universities throughout the world Why Neal thats wonderful You have such a vibrant color sense for a fouryearold You know think this one is even good enough to show to your friends All right lessons over Now turn around Neal Turn around Turn around Sit down All right now Open your mouth Oh thats a boy All right now Cover your eyes Cover your eyes Thats a good boy Now stand up Stand up Now put your arms over your head and stretch Oh what a good boy Good morning Miss Abbott Good morning Dr Ferguson Good morning Neal Come over here and see me Hows he doing Just fine Neal what do you think of your work Flattery will get you nowhere Its just amazing Hes really as bright as a child Well as bright as a two or threeyearold anyway Well thats fine but remember were supposed to find out what the difference is between the intelligence of an ape and a human being And at the rate hes going sometimes wonder if there is any difference Doc would you come here a minute Sure ll take you now my boy Doc didnt you say that among the lower animals there were no natural enemies as long as theyre well fed Yeah something like that Well maybe so Doc but there were four rats in there when changed my lights Now theres only three Its my considered opinion that rat number four is sitting inside that cat Are you sure you fed them all this morning Sure always feed them Howd he get in here Clete Clete heres the most important news that The greatest scientific find since the Peking man What you got Mac someone unearth a natural blonde Theyve captured that Devonian relic Dr Reed reported last year Youre kidding Know what think think you should be thinking about going down to Ocean Harbor You wouldnt have any trouble They know your work down there Clete Clete you can be the first man to scientifically study a creature that by all the laws of nature shouldve died a quarter of a million years ago Where are you going To ask the dean for a leave of absence What else Joe Johnson How are you Lou Mr Foster Never better Joe The whole country is talking about that catch of yours That right Well it oughta be worth a raise then It is Whats this hear about you gettin mauled Ah just a few scratches Hey well bring him right up Well lets go down there boys Now keep him straight Guide him in there easily Watch his head that it doesnt hit on that bulkhead All right Move him through

Keep it comin Raise it up a little Up a little higher All right hold it Now down All right hold it Hold it Thats good Afraid ve got some bad news for you Mr Foster The Gill Man Yeah Been in a coma ever since we captured him But hes still alive Yeah just about Look Joe you cant do this to me ve got every man woman and child in the civilized world waiting to meet the Gill Man The hotels are booked for miles around here ve got the radio the Louie speeches arent gonna do any good now Well put him in the receiving tank and well see what happens Come on lets get rolling Mac Okay Joe Joe Hold him level now System suppose we might describe this ladies and gentlemen as the creatures official entry into the th century Here at Ocean Harbor it will live if it lives at all and become the object of scientific study The question now is whether Joe Hayes the man who captured the creature will be able to bring it out of its comatose condition Hes waiting for it now Alone in the tank Apparently showing no sign of fear as his arms reach out Easy now Let it down easy ve got it All right down just a little All right hold it George Can you get him out Joe Yeah can make it Okay take it away George Take up the rig Photographer Hey boys look up here Man look at that thing Will he come out of it George Too early to tell Pardon me sir Miss Dobson may have a word with you Ladies and gentlemen have here Miss Helen Dobson One of the prettiest young ladies its ever been my pleasure to interview Miss Dobson was a science major at Belmont University in Texas and now Well perhaps d better get her to explain it to you What brings you to the oceanarium Miss Dobson m here to gather material for my masters thesis m studying ichthyology Ichthyology Thats a tendollar word How about explaining it to us Well ichthyology is the study of fish see noticed that Joe Hayes out here has the Gill Man down in the water and hes walking him around That seems to be a strange thing to do Is there any particular reason for it Helen Well thats the way they revive sharks and other large fish And since this creature has gills theyre using the same method You see walking forces water into the mouth from which it flows over the gills Uh as the water traverses past the gills fine blood vessels on the surface of the gills release the carbon dioxide and pick up a dissolved oxygen from the water which exits from the fish through the gillslit see Well do you think it will work in this particular case Well m no prophet Well thank you very much for talking to us Miss Dobson How does it look Joe Cant tell yet Lou How long has he been walkin this thing About two hours What a way to make a living His arm saw it It did move Watch it up there Hes starting to move Why doesnt he get out Get those ropes ready want to get out of here as soon as get a line on him Were ready Joe Get that camera here quick Hell get out of the tank Keep that net handy may need it Well have it when you do All right stand by with those boathooks boys That thing will kill somebody Look out Joe look hes climbing out Look out Joe Give me that Be careful Joe Get him out of there Get the net ready Throw the net Throw the net George Bring him over here Joe Okay ve got his wrist Get those cuts fixed up right away All right all right Lets get out ofhere before that thing breaks loose again System Ladies and gentlemen our Ocean Harbor technicians are about to move the Gill Man from the receiving tank into the larger permanent tank Mr Joe Hayes is in charge of the operation Open up the gate Everything all right Wait till theyre all out of the tank m not taking any chances Okay hope that chain holds Dont worry about that chain System Welcome ladies and gentlemen to Ocean Harbor on this the first day of public exhibit of the worldfamous Gill Man We suggest that you enjoy all of the sights the oceanarium has to offer Once youve seen the Gill Man please move on Give the other folks a chance Our attendants will be pleased to answer your questions as you tour the wonders of the deep Very shortly now the Gill Man will be fed Scientists are still investigating his diet They found the creature reluctant to eat these fish that are swimming about him in the tank It was a real break finding you here Look m not one of those specialists who fails to appreciate the other fellas field Although personally think

just not smart enough to understand him Hi Hi Think Chris is smarter than Flippy Professor doubt it The porpoise has a very large and welldeveloped brain In fact his intelligence lies somewhere between a chimpanzee and a dog How smart is the Gill Man Well thats what m here to find out What his reflexes are like His behavior patterns His capacity to learn His response to stimuli Oh it sounds exciting hope ll be able to help Thanks m sure you will System Here we go Okay once more Back again All right Flippy you may now return to your private quarters and thank you Testing One two three four Helens Voice Testing One two three four Cletes Voice Testing One two three four Helens Voice Testing One two three four Helens Voice Testing One two three four Cletes Voice The speaker must be

Mickey Finn Professor Good Takes about five minutes for this stuff to work Then hell be gentle as a baby suppose Fine scientist you are getting squeamish about doping a fish Hes got it Lets go Right Hey what goes on here Oh well every second millions of electric impulses leap from one cell of the brain to another making our minds and moods what they are You see those wires on the Gill Man pick up these impulses and register them here on the chart Yeah Naturally wed learn a lot more about the creature if we could test him while he was awake Well my dear girl everybody knows that when youre asleep the brain stops working No more so than the heart does The brain waves become irregular like those of the insane You mean m crazy when m asleep No more so than when youre awake Red corpuscle content only percent less than human blood Unnucleated structure No correlation with the fish sample Its amazing Every test every reaction just misses being human Back again boy Say youre like a proverbial kid brother trying to mooch a nickel There Whimpering Well whats the matter boy you worn out Wouldnt you be by now Here boy Fetch Fetch it boy Fetch it Barking Hes a character Its nice to get away lie in the sun be like other people Strange talk coming from a dedicated scientist Have you forgotten your mission in life ll be leaving soon m gonna miss you You know sometimes wonder how ever got started in all this Science fish ichthyology Where will it all lead me as a person mean Most of the kids went to undergraduate school with are already married and have children Is that what you want dont know just dont know But surely But what do you want Well its different with me m a man dont have to make a choice But do Its tough on you gals m not saying its right or wrong Just a fact It doesnt seem right But you havent told me what you want What you want most mean d like to know before leave Youve become important to me Very Uhhuh Oh dog youre a pointkiller Oh Hey take it easy You startled me m sorry You know pity him sometimes Hes so alone The only one of his kind in the world Well hes like an orphan of time Yeah ve been thinking about it Your going into the tank its risky too risky d sleep better if youd leave him toJoe and me Well havent been a help Thats not what m talking about Its Well its just that hes so unpredictable If anything were to happen Nothings going to happen Dont you think youre making a lot out of nothing Hes chained and you have the bullprod Will you listen Youre only going to be here a short time and using Joe might hold you up Move the ball

out ofhis tank Clear the area Mommy Return to your cars Dont approach the beach side of the ocean Hell probably be heading toward the water It is four days since the Gill Man escaped Conflicting reports place the fearsome creature as far north as Norfolk Virginia and as far south as Panama But most experts believe the monster is either dead or on its way back to the Amazon Come on kids Break it up We werent doing anything Well thats good Its time to go home Come on beat it Okay Officer Okay Anything you say Whimpering Dog Yelps Helen Are you all right Helen Chris Helen you all right

Lets enjoy the trip Ballroom Music Sure theres nothing can do to help Everything checks but nothing works Well yell if you need me Okay Ready Sure Lets go Hey cut it out So you want to play huh That does it Try to pull my leg will you Huh For a professor you certainly have the manners of a freshman Hey Professor come on back Its all fixed Funs over Did you have fun Oh yes it was wonderful We better get going Okay Whew its hot Lets go outside All right Well Prince Charming vanishes at midnight and wont see him for three long months Maybe can stretch a weekend Might as well be broke its the way am You know scientists are funny We probe and measure and dissect Invent lights without heat weigh a caterpillars eyebrow But when it comes to really important things were as stupid as the caveman Important Mmhmm Like love Makes the world go round but what do we know about it Is it a fact Is it chemistry electricity Once when had a crush on the captain of the high school football team looked it up in the dictionary And love according to Mr Webster is a feeling of strong personal attachment induced by sympathetic understanding Have you ever heard such nonsense dont know Some things should remain unknown think a poet once said But love is such a mystery cannot find it out For when think m best resolved then am most in doubt Screaming Helen Screaming Helen Help Helen Screaming What was that dont know Aaah Helen Helen Screaming Radio The Gill Man has kidnapped a woman from the Lobster House at the foot of Pier Nine Pier Nine Units one seven alerted to Pier Nine Thats us Helen Man in the water by the buoy Over here Here Clear the streets of traffic Order citizens indoors Police cars on detail nineone will report to waterfront Sirens The Gill Man is loose in Jacksonville after kidnapping Miss Helen Dobson a science student It is believed the monster may be on the prowl ready to attack others The police have requested us to advise all citizens to remain indoors until further notice It is suggested that you keep all lights on as the creature seems not to be able to stand bright light So say to the old man Why should stay in school You never finished and youre doing okay You cant get a job without a college degree Its like my pop says it college degree is like a high school diploma used to be He says Hey Whats that Looks like a bodys been washed ashore Think wed better Yeah Is she all right Shes alive Gill Man Roars Aaah No No Man On Radio Car twofour the report from area is incorrect Got it It is incorrect The Gill Man has not been sighted in that area He could be headed for Brazil by now Yeah The bodies of two men have been found on the banks of the SaintJohns River Car onenine investigate bodies found near car below Point Diego Could be him Lets go Sirens Get a load of that Theres another one over there Look All emergency equipment is being mobilized at Point Diego where the bodies of two students victims of the Gill Man were found So far there has been no trace of Miss Helen Dobson the pretty young scientist kidnapped by the monster Her fiance Professor Clete Ferguson is aiding in the search The police department asked me to repeat this message Civil defense trucks and floodlight equipment will report to Point Diego Police Captain All right men settle down and give me your attention want you to comb this beach and surrounding area carefully but under no circumstances are any of you to investigate shrubbery hulks or other possible places of concealment unless you are accompanied by an armed guard Now the trucks will disperse in both directions and unload about a thousand yards apart Now you men all have flashlights want you to check them right now to see whether theyre in order or not All right come on Turn em on Good Now if any of you spot the Gill Man report to your group leader Hell fire his Very pistol and the professor and will get there as soon as possible May say something to the men Captain Professor Ferguson would like to say something to you want to impress upon you once again something the captain said before Dont take any chances This is a thinking creature were hunting Wily cruel dangerous As strong as any ten of you Two men have already lost their lives tonight girl is missing want to find that girl alive more than anything else in the world but dont want a single one of you men to risk your life needlessly Remember that this creature cant stay out of the water for more than a few minutes That limits our search to a narrow strip along the river So please obey the captains instructions to the letter The moment you spot the Gill Man report it to your group leader and hell fire his Very pistol Thats it men Get at it Hold it Joe turn that light back think saw something Anything to make
