and overseas Family friends colleagues and strangers gathered to farewell Sergeant Gary Silk It was a heartbreaking return to the academy from which he graduated years ago Outside Thousands heard Ian Silk tell of his brothers dedication to the force Finally the utimate honour shouder to shouder for more than a kilometre Hundreds of officers reflected on the utimate sacrifice theyre all at risk of being asked to pay He will my shield And portion be Premier Jeff Kennett had for the killers this message Just be assured that all the resources of the state will be brought to bear to find you out and to bring you to trial Endures cant promise an arrest But what can offer is a guarantee that we will never stop trying to find them We cant ask for more than that Gary wouldnt expect more than that No nor would Rod He understood how difficult investigations can be Au You know the score If we dont identify the offenders within hours it could take years need a team that can run all day people who never get tired of chasing the ball is that you Yes Uh Dean Thomas everyone Remember you are working for your mates not just Gary Silk and Rod Miller You are working for every serving officer in Victoria Youre also working for Constable Damian Eyre and Constable Steve Tynan You know their names years ago they were murdered in cold blood in Walsh Street South Yarra And we never locked anyone up for that one This time we will ve asked these gentlemen to help us Introduce yourselves please Were from Armed Robbers Mark Butterworth Steve Beanland Joe Alo Hamada was our op and before anybody says were responsible we already know that No matter how hard you blokes work to solve this thing well work harder thats a promise Graeme the first rule of Taskforce Lorimer is do not assume anything You check everything You check everything twice At this moment weve got twin lines of inquiry First of all weve identified the killers car as being a dark Hyundai hatchback But whats the first rule of Lorimer Do not assume anything Right The second one is why these gentlemen are here Catch the restaurant bandits we catch our killers Your time starts now m a snake charmer Baby Tin whistle in my hand Police Dont move Get down on the ground now Said m a snake charmer Darling Tin whistle in my hand Dickheads Dont move Down on the floor Oh you didnt do it huh Hey What did you do ll tell you what you can fucking do Two fucking mates went out there and theyre fucking dead Yeah So nobody knows who these pricks are Someone does Wife girlfriend fence Weve shut down every crook in Melbourne Well all theyve gotta do is give us a name and well back off And how can they give them up if they dont know who the hell they are Huh m taking you back to the night of Saturday the th So youre parked outside Hardware and youre watching the restaurant across the road Can you see its name The Silky Emperor Can you remember the cars numberplate Frank At first we thought it was the same Honda back again But it was a different car How tall would you say he was About centimetres Shoulderlength dark hair Theres stubbly growth Six foot Check shirt Yeah Hmm Now Gary was shot three times First shot to the chest Second shot to the pelvis smashing a vertebrae Third shot to the skull was fatal The second and third round was from a different gun Two shooters Or one man with two guns Rod was shot once The bullet entered his body under his left armpit and exited at his right hip Explain the trajectory Well the theory is Rod was at the back of the Hyundai He had the gunman inside the car shooting over the top of the front seat through the rear window First shot smashes the glass Rod ducks down Second shot hits him Anything helpful with the bullets No Theyre twisted out of shape from impacting on bone Theyre useless However Rod did return four shots but weve only recovered three so figure the final round mightve lodged in the Hyundais bodywork Too much to hope it lodged in someones skull Its definitely Korean manufacture The Japs use a thicker glass and generally tint it So its probably a Hyundai Excel either or door Thats great work Mick Thanks And how many out there About registered in Australia Wouldnt you be wise to add more experience to the team Its all about fresh thinking Yeah well some of them look like schoolkids Paul Its like a football team Older players dont always work as hard for the kicks as the young guns ve told them theyre getting their weekends off and to take leave when its due So youre worried about burnout Well you can only run on adrenaline for so long And passions running pretty high at the moment ve sent a team to South Korea to research Hyundais Whats that gonna cost Fine Its fine Whatever you need Just get me a result Paul went out on a limb for you July was the Green Papaya and August the Silky Emperor Now the Green Papaya was the Lucifer crack yes Yeah When the cops turn up tell them Lucifer was here In July he throws down a challenge to us In August he works up to murder Does our Lucifer have a grudge against police Lets look at everybody whos lodged a complaint with Ethical Standards the ombudsman that sort of thing Yeah What if these

Suddenly spot this Commodore with two blokes in it Cops So got out of there pretty quick Commodore stuck with me for a bit and then lost him on Warrigal Road Did you happen to come back an hour later then for another look No was at home shitting myself Plus heard all that shots fired stuff on the scanner Yeah well this is the time to come clean mate Dont plead not guilty and then have us prove youre lying cause judges they hate that shit m not lyin Did you shoot Gary Silk and Rod Miller No Its not in my nature Oh Blood will flow Shooting cops sounds exactly your speed Oh thats bullshit m a thief man Pssh Well need blood and hair for testing Oh and your earwax Earwax Mmm Why Well your filthy ear preserves gunshot residue for months This is gonna cost million by the time were done Do you reckon wed go to the same amount of trouble if they werent cops Were protecting the uniform the thin blue line between order and chaos Update on our Nazi car thief He was home in bed when the shots were fired Hes got a neighbour with insomnia and a telescope Havent you people got homes to go to Wanna hear something weird Nicole Debs just bought another rear window for her car Another one What

long as it takes Inspector Paul John Silvester from the Age Do you think your taskforce is gonna be better resourced and better supported than Walsh Street was m not here to discuss Walsh Street Well is that a yes or a no We have everything we need Thank you Is that all we get When have something to say ll say it Inspector Inspector Were reporting here live from the steps at police headquarters That was Paul Sheridan Paul Not only do we have to do this one better than Walsh Street we have to be seen to do it better Walsh Street was a mess because there was no clear chain of authority Too many chiefs too many conflicting opinions Thats why wanted you and you alone talking to the media regularly Even if ve got nothing to say Paul two coppers are dead The public wants to know what were gonna do about it so does the Chief so does the Minister so does the Premier Now would it kill you to release the occasional harmless snippet of information Graeme if you want a campaign m not the man Put the Bandali Debs case to me Alright Debs has a proven record of dishonesty point to his conviction for handling Further to that three years ago he pleaded guilty to stealing that spare wheel from the car yard at Ferntree Gully He received a bond and no conviction was recorded but its worth noting that he led the police on a chase through three suburbs before he was caught Now his daughter Nicole owns a dark blue Hyundai Excel which is an exact match for our missing vehicle Coincidence Whos to say that he isnt our bloke Against Skip Ben Debs is a tradesman who works for a living Hes got a wife hes got five kids and a mortgage and a dog named Pebbles Is that the profile of a cop killer He he pays his taxes he pays his bills He bought the Hyundai quite legitimately for his daughter Nicoles th birthday Is that the profile of a guy that coldbloodedly murders two cops just to avoid being questioned for minor robbery matters mean surely if he was our guy the first thing hed do is dispose of the car right No match Lets find out whos right Put the dogs on him Up there Cazaly In there and fight Fly like an angel Youre Fuckin Christ What happened Mate Oh God Oh Your thumb Oh Lets have a look Oh fuck Oh its alright Ahh Good ony a Darl Heres your See y a petty thief maybe but public enemy number one Nah still wanna see the car Youd better not put one fuckin scratch on it mate Ll For the fuckin umpteenth time parked the car pulled out a bucket of blacklabel glue and some other stuff from the back Did you hear what said Not one scratch tools and shit And was in a hurry remember and slammed the hatch bang There was fucking glass everywhere Where exactly In the back It all just went fuckin fuckin crashed down in the back You know bloody mess And then drove home and then gave Nicole the money to buy a new one Yeah he did Which you fitted Yeah which blew out a few days later Oh and remember something else know where those cops got shot What do you mean You know that Chink restaurant The um ththe Silky uh thingummyjig The Silky Emperor Yeah did a job there a few years back tiled their bloody kitchen The rear windscreen fragments from Nicole Debss Excel dont match the

Gary down They drove into the car park of the Silky Emperor just to lure them out Why kill two police just because they interrupt a drug deal Well maybe there was more to it Well did Gary ever bust him m not sure Two weeks later there was an aggravated burg on a house in Northcote Do you remember it Three offenders in balaclavas It was a shakedown One of them shoved a gun in a fiveyearolds mouth Thats right Special Response are looking at Radev So the reckless act of a man whos already killed two cops His weapon of choice Bulldog the right calibre so car pulls up here under this broken streetlight deliberately The driver waits in the vehicle till the cop car pulls up behind them and Gary and Rod get out Rod stays at the back of the car Gary comes to the front to speak with the driver Gary then crosses to the front of the car Passenger steps out Rod pulls out his firearm takes shots at the passenger fleeing Driver then jumps into the car grabs his pistol Why Well maybe Gary didnt realise what hed stumbled across And maybe Radev assumed that he did So we bring them in Apply the blowtorch to their hairy bellies Just Radev Divide and conquer Police Dont move Police Freeze Get down Get down Get down Dont move Get down Piss off day mate told you lost my gun After you killed two police officers What for kill policemen for You tell us Radev tell you go have good fuck with

Greaseball What Come on fuck You know this fat fuck Greaseball Fat fuck Leave me alone What do you want You have the wrong man tell you you have the wrong man You dont want to talk to us Mr Greaseball

and d just finished my shift Um Who does she belong to Radev Regular customer Says that she saw him at that night to buy some pills personal use only Where Service station in Warrigal Road Says that she had to go the long way around cause there were too many cops in the area So immediately after committing a double murder police swarming all around the place he takes time out to do a hundreddollar drug deal And yeah Out you go mate Imagine this Imagine a plank of wood this wide lying on the ground What if asked you to walk the length of it without stepping off or touching the ground Could you do it Course you can Every single time But what happens if we suspend that plank of wood a hundred feet in the air and we ask you to do it again You cant do it can you You cant do it

Yeah so what are we gonna do Drag every last bastard out again and look at all the witness statements Therell be millions You remember that one where that bloke chucked a tinnie at that robbers car Arsehole Palm Beach restaurant Patterson Lakes October something The famous Mark Butterworth photographic memory Waste of a perfectly good tinnie Arsehole Get back here Backs onto And ended up on the Page We end up there What are we There was something funny about that getaway car Remember Mark Yeah it belonged to a gorilla gorilla Mmm Jason Manuel Ghiller years old tyre fitter Saturday October Mmhm Jason Manuel Ghiller drives his fourdoor Laser to the Nu Hotel in Dandenong for a few drinks and bumps into an old mate An hour later he offers the mate and his girlfriend a lift home goes outside cars gone Stolen he claims to police later Yep Definitely suss That sounds to me But youre young and trusting and naive And youre wearing your fuckin Homicide tie Youre an Armed Robber son You dont wear poofy Homicide ties when he was interviewed the general impression was that Ghiller the gorilla only pretended to be shocked when told the car was used in a robbery he bought another car almost immediately with cash Doesnt even bother to wait and see if the old ones recovered he matches the description of the second Palm Beach robber And thats when the first series of robberies stopped Yep for whatever reason How old was he mean maybe he just got shit scared and bailed out From the mouths of babes Didnt know you boys could read Hey that top number recognise it Whose is it Dunno That kid Ghillers most frequently dialled We think Debs and Ghiller were the original robbers Then Ghiller got a scare lost his nerve And last year found himself a new partner Debs is Lucifer Why doesnt his car match the glass on Cochranes Road Is it possible you made a mistake These are highly sophisticated scientific instruments It is not guesswork How many pieces of glass did you recover from the Debs Hyundai was on leave How many did we actually test Theoretically its only necessary to test a few How many Three How about we go back and retest all Edward second round of window tests indicate that the Debs Hyundai cannot be ruled out after all According to the refractive index half the fragments are consistent with gunshot damage which puts Bandali Debs back into the frame And for that we can thank the Armed Robbers Thanks boys Hey bags m there for the arrest said we cant exclude Debs We are light years away from arresting him Our task now is to prove whether or not he is our Lucifer Graeme m gonna ask you to swear an oath of silence Noones to know that were looking for Debs mean noone Once the warrants are through were gonna off his phone and install Ds in his
