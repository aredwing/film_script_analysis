Iceland is a stable democracy with a high standard of living and until recently extremely low unemployment and government debt We had the complete infrastructure of a modern society clean energy food production fisheries with a quota system to manage them Good healthcare and good education clean air not much crime Its good place for families to life We had almost end of history status But in Iceland government began a broad policy of deregulation that would have disastrous consequences first for the environment and then for the economy They started by allowing multinational corporations like Alcova to build giant aluminum smelting plants and exploit Iceland s natural geothermal and hydroelectric energy sources Many of the most beautiful areas in the highlands with the most spectacular colors are geothermal So nothing comes without consequences At the same time the government privatized Iceland s three largest banks The result was one of the purest experiments in financial deregulation ever conducted Finance took over and uh more or less wrecked the place In a year period these three tiny banks which had never operated outside of Iceland borrowed billion ten times the size of Iceland s economy The bankers showered money on themselves each other and their friends There was a massive bubble Stock prices went up by a factor of nine house prices more than doubled Iceland bubble gave rise to people like Jon Asgeir Johannesson He borrowed billions from the banks to buy up highend retail businesses in London He also bought a pinstriped private jet a million yacht and a Manhattan penthouse Newspapers always had headlines this millionaire bought this company in the or in Finland or in France or wherever Instead of saying this millionaire took a billion dollar loan to buy this company and he took it from your local bank The banks set up money market funds and the banks advised depositholders to withdraw money and put them in a money market funds The Ponzi scheme needed everything it could huh American accounting firms like audited the Iceland s banks and investment firms and found nothing wrong And American credit rating agencies said Iceland was wonderful In February the rating agencies decided to upgrade the banks to a highest possible rate It went so far as the government here traveling with the bankers as a show When Iceland s banks collapsed at the end of unemployment tripled in months There is nobody unaffected in Iceland So a lot of people here lost their savings Yes that s the case The government regulators who should ve been protecting the citizens of Iceland had done nothing You have two lawyers from the regulator company whore coming to a bank to talk about some issues When they approach the bank they would see nineteen Vs outside the bank so you enter the bank and you have nineteen lawyers sitting in front of you that very well prepared ready to kill any argument you make and then if you do very well they offer you job One third of Iceland s financial regulators went to work for the banks But this is a universal problem in New York you have the same problem right What do you think of Wall Street incomes these days Excessive ve been told that its extremely difficult for the to criticize United States wouldnt say that We deeply regret our breaches of law They re amazed at how much cocaine these Wall Streeters can use and get up and go to work the next day didnt know what credit default swaps are m little bit old fashioned Has Larry Summers ever expressed remorse dont hear confessions The government just writing checks thats plan thats plan and thats plan Would you support legal controls on executive pay would not Are you comfortable with level of compensation in financial service industry If they ve earned it then yes am Do you think they ve earned it think they ve earned it And so you help these people blow the world up You could say that They were having massive private gains at public loss When you start thinking you can create something out of nothing its very difficult to resist m concerned that a lot of people want go back to the old way the way they were operating prior to the crisis was getting a lot of anonymous emails from bankers saying You cant quote me but m really concerned Why do you think there isnt a more systematic investigation being undertaken Because then you will find the culprits Do you think that Columbia Business School has any significant conflict of interest problem Dont see that we do The regulators didnt do their job they had the power to do every case that made when was state attorney general they just didnt want it Over the weekend Lehman Brothers one of the most venerable and biggest investment banks was forced to declare itself bankrupt another Merrill Lynch was forced to sell itself today Crisis talks are underway World financial markets are way down today dramatic developments for two Wall Street giants In September the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers and the collapse of the worlds largest insurance company triggered a global financial crisis fears gripped markets overnight with Asian stocks slammed by Stocks fell off a cliff the largest single point drop in history Share prices continued to tumble in the aftermath of the Lehman collapse The result was a global recession which costs the world tens of trillions of dollars rendered million people unemployed and doubled the national debt of the If you looked at the costs of it Destruction of equity wealth of housing wealth Destruction of income of jobs million people globally could end up below the poverty line again This is just a hugely hugely expensive crisis This crisis was not an accident It was caused by an out of control industry Since the s the rise of financial sector has led to a series of increasingly severe financial crisis Each crisis has caused more damage while the industry has made more and more money After the Great Depression the United States have years of economic growth without a single financial crisis the financial industry was tightly regulated most regular banks were local businesses and they were prohibited from speculating with depositors savings Investment banks which handle stock and bond trading were small private partnerships In the traditional investment banking partnership model the partners put the money up and obviously the partners watch that money very carefully They wanted to live well but they didnt want to bet the ranch on anything Paul Volcker served on the treasury department and was chairman of the Federal Reserve from Before going into government he was a financial economist at Chase Manhattan Bank When left Chase to go in Treasury in think my income was in the neighbourhood of per year Morgan Stanley in had approximately total personnel One office and capital of Now Morgan Stanley has workers and has capital of several billion and has offices all over the world In the s the financial industry exploded The investment banks went public giving them huge amount of stock holding money People on Wall Street started getting rich had a friend who was a bond trader at Merill Lynch in s He had a job as a train conductor at night Because he had kids and couldnt support them on what a bond trader made By he was making millions of dollars and thought it was because he was smart The highest order of business before the nation is to restore our economic prosperity In president Ronald Reagan choose as his Treasury Secretary the of investment bank Merrill Lynch Donald Regan Wall Street and the President do see eye to eye ve talked to many leaders of Wall Street they all say well be behind the President on The Reagan administration supported by economists and financial lobbyist started a year period of financial deregulations In the Reagan administration deregulated savings and loan companies allowing them to make risky investments with their depositors money By the end of the decade hundreds of saving and loan companies had failed This crises cost tax payers billion and cost many people their life savings It may be the biggest bank heist in our history Thousands of saving and loan executives went to jail for looting their companies One of the most extreme cases was Charles Keating In when federal regulators began investigating him Keating haired an economist named Alan Greenspan In this letter to regulators Greenspan praised Keatings sound business plan and expertise and said he saw no risk in allowing Keating to invest his customers money Keating reportedly paid Greenspan Charles Keating went to prison shortly afterwards As for Alan Greenspan President Reagan appointed him chairman of Americas central bank The Federal Reserve Greenspan was reappointed by presidents Clinton and George Bush During the Clinton administration deregulation continued under Greenspan And Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin the former of the investment bank Goldman Sachs and Larry Summers a Harvard economics professor The financial sector of Wall Street being powerful having lobbyists having lots of money step by step captured the political system both on the Democratic and the Republican side By the late s the financial sector had consolidated into few gigantic firms Each of them so large that their failure can threaten the whole system And the Clinton administration helped them grow even larger In Citicorp and Travelers merged to form Citigroup the largest financial services company in the world The merger violated the GlassSteagal act a law passed after the Great Depression which prevented banks with consumer deposits from engaging in risky investment banking activities It was illegal to acquire Travelers Greenspan said nothing The Federal Reserve gave him an exemption for a year and then they got the law passed In at the urging of Summers and Rubin Congress passed the GrammLeachBliley Act Known to some as the Citigroup Relief Act It overturned GlassSteagal and cleared the way for future mergers Why do you have big banks because banks like monopoly power because banks like lobbying power because banks know that when theyre too big they will be bailed Markets are inherently unstable or at least potentially unstable and appropriate metaphor is the oil tankers theyre very big and therefore you have to put in compartments to prevent the sloshing around of oil from capsizing the boat the design of the boat has to take that into account and after the Depression the regulation actually introduced these very watertight compartments and deregulation has led to the end of compartmentalization The next crisis came at the end of the s The investment banks fuel the massive bubble in internet stocks Which was followed by a crash in that caused trillion dollars in investment losses The Securities and Exchange Commission the federal agency which had been created during the depression to regulate investment banking had done nothing In the absence of meaningful federal action and there has been none and given the clear failure of self regulation It is become necessary for others to step in and adopt the protections needed Eliot Spitzers investigations revealed that the investments banks had promoted internet companies they knew would fail Stock analysts were being paid based on how much business they brought in and what they sad publicly was quite different from what they sad privately Infospace given the highest possible rating dismissed by the analysts as the piece of junk Excite also highly rated called such a piece of crap The defense that was proffered by many of the investment banks was not youre wrong it was Everybody s doing it and everybody s know its going on and therefore nobody should rely on these analysts anyway In December ten investment banks settle the case for a total of billion and promised to change their ways Scott Talbott is the chief lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable one of the most powerful groups in Washington which represents nearly all of the world largest financial companies Are you comfortable with the fact that several of your member companies have engaged in large scale criminal activity Youll have to be specific Ok And first of all criminal activity shouldnt be accepted period Since deregulation began the worlds biggest financial firms have been caught laundering money defrauding customers and cooking their books again and again and again Credit Suisse helped funnel money for Irans nuclear program and for the Aerospace Industries Organization of Iran which built ballistic missiles Any information that would identify it as Iranian would be removed The bank was fined million Citi bank helped funnel million of drug money out of Mexico Did you comment that she should loose any documents connected with the account said that in a kidding manner it was at the early stages of this did not mean it seriously Between and Fannie Mae overstated its earnings by more than billion These accounting standards are highly complex And require determinations over which experts often disagree Franklin Raines who used to be President Clintons budget director received over million in bonuses When was caught helping wealthy Americans evade taxes they refused to cooperate with government Would you be willing to supply the names If there is a treaty framework No treaty framework youve agreed you participated in a fraud hm But while the company is faced unprecedented fines the investment firms do not have to admit any wrong doing When you this large and you are dealing with this many products and this many customers mistakes happen The financial services industry seems to have level of criminality that is you know somewhat distinctive When were the last time when or Intel or Google or Apple or you know totally agree with you about hightech versus financial services but hightech is fundamentally creative business where the value generation and the income derives from actually create something new and different Beginning at s deregulations and advances in technology led to an explosion of complex financial products called derivatives Economists and bankers claimed they made market safer But instead they made them unstable Since the end of Cold War a lot of former physicist and mathematicians decided to apply their skills not on Cold War technology but on financial markets And together with investment bankers and hedge funds Creating different weapons Absolutely As Warren Buffett said Weapons of mass destruction Regulators politicians and business people did not take seriously the threat of financial innovation on the stability of the financial system Using derivatives bankers could gamble on virtually anything They could bet on rise or fall of oil prices the bankruptcy of a company even the whether By the late s derivatives were a trillion unregulated market In someone tried to regulate them Brooksley Born graduated first in her class at Stanford Law School and was the first woman to edit a major law review After running derivatives practice at Arnold Porter Born was appointed by president Clinton to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission which oversaw the derivatives market Brooksley Born ask me if would come work with her We decided that this was a serious potentially destabilizing market In May of the issued a proposal to regulate derivatives Clintons Treasury department had an immediate response happened to go into Brooksleys office and she was just putting down the receiver of her telephone And the blood had drained from her face And she looked at me and said That was Larry Summers He had bankers in his office He conveyed it in a very bullying fashion Sort of directing her to stop The banks were now heavily reliant for earnings on these types of activities and that led to a titanic battle to prevent these sets of instruments from being regulated Shortly after the phone call from Summers Greenspan Rubin and chairman Arthur Levitt issued a joint statement condemning Born and recommended legislation to keep derivatives unregulated Regulations of derivatives transactions that are privately negotiated by professionals is unnecessary She was overruled unfortunately first by the Clinton administration and then by the Congress in Senator Phil Gramm took a major role in getting a bill passed that pretty much exempted derivatives from regulation They are unifying markets they are reducing regulatory burden believe that we need to do it After leaving the Senate Phil Gramm became ViceChairman of Since his wife Wendy had served on the board of Enron But it s our very great hope that it would be possible to move this year on legislation in a suitable way goes to create legal certainty for derivatives Larry Summers later made million as a consultant to a hedge fund that relied heavily on derivatives wished to associate myself with all of the remarks of secretary Summers In December Congress passed The Commodity Futures Modernization Act Written with a help of financial industry lobbyists it banned the regulation of derivatives Once thats was done it was off to the races And use of derivatives and financial innovation exploded dramatically after So help me God So help me God By the time Bush took office in The financial sector was vastly more profitable concentrated and powerful than ever before Dominating this industry were investment banks Two financial conglomerates Three securities insurance companies and three rating agencies And linking them all together was a securitization food chain a new system which connected trillions of dollars mortgages and other loans with investors all over the world years ago if you wanted get a loan for a home the person lending you money expecting you to pay him or her back you got a loan from a lender who wanted you to pay him back weve since developed securitization whereby people who made the loan are no longer at risk if theres a failure to repay In the old system when a home owner paid their mortgage every months the money went to their local lender And since mortgages took decades to repay lenders were careful In the new system lenders sold the mortgages to investment banks The investment banks combined thousands of mortgages and other loans including car loans student loans and credit card debt to create complex derivatives called collateralized debt obligation or the investment banks then sold the Os to investors Now when home owners paid their mortgages the money went to investors all over the world The investment banks paid rating agencies to evaluate the Os and many of them were given an rating which is highest possible investment grade This made Os popular with retirement funds which can only purchase highly rated securities This system was a ticking time bomb Lenders didnt care anymore about whether a borrower could repay So they started making riskier loans The investment banks didnt care either The more Os they sold the higher their profits and the rating agencies which were paid by the investment banks had no liability if their ratings of Os proved wrong You werent going to be on the hook and there werent regulatory constraints so it was a green light to just pump out more and more loans Between and the number of mortgage loans made each year nearly quadrupled Everybody in this securitization food chain from the very beginning until the end didnt care about the quality of the mortgage they cared about maximizing their volume and getting a fee out of it In the early s there was a huge increase in the riskiest loans called subprime but when thousands of subprime loans were combined to create Os Many of them still received ratings Now it wouldnt have been possible to create derivative products that dont have these risks that carry the equivalent of deductibles where there are limits on risks that can be taken on and so forth they didnt do that did they They didnt do that and in retrospect they should have done So did these guys knew they were doing something dangerous think they did All the incentives that the financial institutions offered to the mortgage brokers were based on selling the most profitable products which were predatory loans The bankers make more money if they put you on subprime loan Thats where they are going to put you Suddenly hundreds of billions of dollars a year were flowing through the securitization chain Since anyone could get a mortgage home purchases and housing prices skyrocketed The result was the biggest financial bubble in history Real estate is real they can see their asset they can live in their asset they can rent out their asset You had huge boom in housing that made no sense at all financing appetites of the financial sector drove what everybody else did Last time we had a housing bubble was in the late s In that case the increasing home prices were relatively minor That housing bubble led to relatively severe recession From until real home prices effectively doubled At a ticket they come to hear how buy their very own piece of American dream Goldman Sachs Bear Stearns Lehman Brothers Merrill Lynch were all in on this subprime lending alone increase from billion a year in funding to over six hundred billion a year in ten years they knew what was happening Countrywide Financial the largest subprime lender issued billion worth of loans It made over billion dollars in profits as a result On Wall Street annual cash bonuses spiked traders and Os became enormously wealthy during the bubble Lehman Brothers was the top underwriter of subprime lending And their Richard Fuld took home million On Wall Street this housing and credit bubble was leading to hundreds of billions of dollars of profits By about of all profits of firms was coming from financial institutions It wasnt real profits it wasnt real income It was just money that was being created by the system and booked as income Two three years down the road theres a default its all wiped out think it was in fact in retrospect a great big national and not just national global Ponzi scheme Through the home ownership and equality protection act the Federal Reserve Board had broad authority to regulate the mortgage industry but Federal Chairman Alan Greenspan refused to use it Alan Greenspan said no that regulation dont even believe in it For years Robert Gnaizda was the head of Greenlining a powerful consumer advocacy group He met with Greenspan on a regular basis We gave him an example of Countrywide different complex adjustable rate mortgages He said if youd had a doctorate in math you wouldnt be able to understand them enough to know which was good for you and which wasnt So we thought he was going to take action but as the conversation continues it was clear he was stuck with his ideology We met again with Greenspan at often we met with him twice a year never less than once a year and he wouldnt change his mind Alan Greenspan declined to be interviewed for this film In this amazing world of instant global communications The free and efficient movement of capital is helping to create the greatest prosperity in human history people were cut from the enforcement division of is that what you also testified to Yeah think there has been a a systematic gutting or whatever you want to call it of the agency and its capability through cutting back of staff The office of risk management was reduced to a staff did you say of one Yeah when that gentleman would go home at night he could turn the lights out During the bubble the investment banks were borrowing heavily to buy more loans and create more Os The ratio between borrowed money and banks own money was called leverage The more banks borrowed the higher their leverage In Henry Paulson the of Goldman Sachs helped lobby the Securities and Exchange Commission to relax limits on leverage allowing the banks to sharply increase their borrowing The somehow decided to let investment banks gamble a lot more That was nuts dont know why they did that but they did that Weve said these are the big guys and clearly thats true But that means if anything goes wrong its going to be an awfully big mess At these levels youre obviously dealing with the most highly sophisticated financial institutions These are the firms that do most of the derivative activity in the United States We talked to some of them as to what their comfort level was The firms actually thought that the number was appropriate Do the commissioners vote to adopt the rule amendments and new rules as recommended by the staff We do indeed Unanimous And we are adjourned The degree of leverage in financial system became absolutely frightening investment banks leveraging up to the level to which means that tiny percent decrease in a value of asset base would leave them insolvent There was another ticking time bomb in the financial system the world s largest insurance company was selling huge quantities of derivatives called credit default swaps For investors who owned Os credit default swaps worked like an insurance policy An investor who purchase credit default swap paid a quarterly premium If went bad promised to pay the investor for their losses But unlike regularly insurance speculators could also buy credit default swaps from in order to bet against Os they didnt own In insurance you could only insure something you own Lets say you and own property and own a house can only insure that house once the derivatives universe essentially enables anybody to actually insure that house So you could insure that somebody else could do that So people could insure my house So what happens is if my house burns down the number of losses in the system becomes proportionally large Since credit default swaps were unregulated didnt have put aside any money to cover potential losses Instead paid its employees huge cash bonuses as soon as contracts were signed but if the Os later went bad would be on the hook People were essentially been rewarded for taking massive risks In good times they generate shortterm revenues and profits and therefore bonuses but thats going to lead to the firm to be bankrupt over time thats totally distorted system of compensation Financial Products division in London issued billion worth of credit default swaps during the bubble Many of them for Os backed by subprime mortgages The made million between and Joseph Cassano the head of personally made million Its hard for us without being flippant to even to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing in any of those transactions In auditors raised warnings One of them Joseph St Denis resigned in protest After Cassano repeatedly blocked him from investigating s accounting Let me tell you one person who didnt get a bonus when everybody else was getting bonuses That was St Denis Mr St Denis who tried to alert two of you to the fact that you are running into big problems he quit in frustration and he didnt get a bonus In Raghuram Rajan then the Chief economist of the International Monetary Fund delivered a paper at the Annual Jackson Hole symposium the most elite banking conference in the world Who was in the audience It was guess the central bankers of the world ranging from Mr Greenspan himself Ben Bernanke Larry Summers was there Tim Geithner was there The title of the paper was essentially Is Financial Development Making the World Riskier and the conclusion was it is Rajans paper focused on incentives structures that generated huge cash bonuses based on shortterm profits but which imposed no penalties for later losses Rajan argued that these incentives encouraged bankers to take risks that might eventually destroy their own firms or even the entire financial system Its very easy to generate performance by taking on more risk And so what you need to do is compensate for riskadjusted performance and thats where all the bodies are buried Rajan hit the nail on the head What he particularly said was You guys have claimed you found a way to make more profit with less risk say you found a way to make a more profit with more risk And thats a big difference Summers was vocal He basically thought that was criticizing the change in the financial world And was worried about regulation which reverse this whole change So essentially he accused me of being a Luddite He wanted to make sure that we didnt bring a whole new set of regulations to constrain the financial sector at that point Larry Summers declined to be interviewed for this film You going to make an extra million dollars a year or million dollars a year For putting you financial institution at risk Someone else pays the bill you dont pay the bill Would you make that bet Most people who worked on Wall Street said Sure make that bet The Hamptons hours from New York City There never was enough They dont want to own one home They want to own five homes and they want to have an expensive Penthouse on Park Avenue And they want have they own private jet You think this is an industry were high very high compensation levels are justified think would take caution take heed or take exception at your word very high mean its all relative You have a million oceanfront home in Florida you have a summer vacation home in Sun Valley Idaho you and your wife have art collection filled with million dollar paintings Richard Fuld never appeared on the trading floor There were art advisors up there all the time You know he had his own private elevator he were out of his way to be disconnected mean his elevator the higher technicians to program it you know so that his driver would call in the morning and a security guard would hold it and there s only like or seconds window when he actually he has to see people and he hops in the elevator and he goes straight to Lehman owned a bunch of corporate jets do you know about this Yes How many were there Well there were including s They also had a helicopter see Isnt that kind a lot of planes to have We deal with type personalities and type personalities know everything in the world Banking became a pissing contest you know mine is bigger than yours thats kind of stuff It was all men that ran it incidentally billions deals werent large enough so we do billion deals These people are risktakers theyre impulsive Jonathan Alpert is a therapist whose clients include highlevel Wall Street executive Thats part of their behavior part of their personality and that manifests outside of work as well Its quite typical for the guys to go out to go strip bars to use drugs see a lot of cocaine use a lot of use of prostitution Recently neuroscientists have done experiments where theyve taken individuals put them into machine and and they have them play game where the prize is money And they notice that when the subjects earn money the part of the brain that get stimulated is the same part that cocaine stimulates lot of people feel they need to really participate in that behavior to make it to get promoted to get recognized According to a Bloomberg article business entertainment represents of revenue for New York derivatives brokers and often includes strip clubs prostitution and drugs New York broker filed a lawsuit in against his firm alleging he was required to retain prostitutes to entertain traders Theres just a blatant disregard for the impact that their actions might have on on society on family They have no problem using a prostitute uh and going home to their wife Kristin Davis ran an elite prostitution ring from her highrise apartment It was located a few blocks from the New York stock exchange How many customers About at that point in time What fraction were from Wall Street Of the higherend clients probably to percent And were all the major Wall Street firms represented Goldman Sachs Lehman Brothers yeah they re all in there Morgan Stanley was a little less of that Uh think Goldman was was pretty pretty big with that lot of clients would call me and say can you get me a Lamborghini for the night for the girl These guys were spending corporate money had many black cards from you know the various financial firms Whats happening is services are being charged to computer repair Trading research you know consulting for market compliance just usually gave them a piece of letterhead and said make your own invoice So this pattern of behavior you think extends to the senior management of the firm Absolutely does yeah know for a fact that it does It extends to the very top friend of mine who whos involved in a company that has a big financial presence said Well its about time you learned about subprime mortgages So he set up a session with his trading desk and me and and a techie who who did all this gets very excited runs to his computer pulls up in about three seconds this Goldman Sachs issue of securities It was a complete disaster Borrowers had borrowed on average percent of the price of the house Which means they have no money in the house If anything goes wrong theyre going to walk away from the mortgage This is not a loan youd really make right Youve got to be crazy But somehow you took of these loans and by the time the guys were done at Goldman Sachs and the rating agencies twothirds of the loans were rated which meant they were rated as safe as government securities Its its utterly mad Goldman Sachs sold at least billion dollars worth of these toxic Os in the first half of The of Goldman Sachs at this time was Henry Paulson the highestpaid on Wall Street Good morning welcome to the White House am pleased to announce that will nominate Henry Paulson to be the secretary of the Treasury He has a lifetime of business experience he has an intimate knowledge of financial markets he has earned a reputation for candor and integrity You might think it would be hard for Paulson to adjust to a meager government salary But taking the job as Treasury secretary was the best financial decision of his life Paulson had to sell his million dollars of Goldman stock when he went to work for the government But because of a law passed by the first President Bush he didnt have to pay any taxes on it It saved him million dollars The article came out in October of Already a third of the mortgages defaulted Now uh most of them are going One group that had purchased these nowworthless securities was the Public Employees Retirement System of Mississippi which provides monthly benefits to over retirees They lost millions of dollars and are now suing Goldman Sachs By late Goldman had taken things a step further It didnt just sell toxic Os it started actively betting against them at the same time it was telling customers that they were highquality investments By purchasing credit default swaps from Goldman could bet against Os it didnt own and get paid when the Os failed asked them if anybody called the customers and said you know we dont really like this kind of mortgage anymore and we thought you ought to know you know They they didnt really say anything but you know you could just feel the laughter coming over the phone Goldman Sachs bought at least billion dollars of credit default swaps from It was so much that Goldman realized that itself might go bankrupt so they spent million dollars insuring themselves against s potential collapse Then in Goldman went even further They started selling Os specifically designed so that the more money their customers lost the more money Goldman Sachs made Six hundred million dollars Timberwolf Securities is what you sold Before you sold them this is what your sales team were telling to each other Boy that Timberwolf was one shitty deal This was an email to me in late June Right And youre calling Timberwolf After the transaction No no you sold Timberwolf after as well we did trades after that Yeah okay The next email take a look July tells the sales force the top priority is Timberwolf Your top priority to sell is that shitty deal if you have an adverse interest to your client do you have the duty to disclose that to your client to tell that client of your adverse interest Thats my question Mr Chairman just trying to understand No think you understand it dont think you want to answer it Do you believe that you have a duty to act in the best interests of your clients Again uh uh Senator will repeat you know we have a a duty to to serve our clients by showing prices on transaction where they ask us to show prices for What do you think about selling securities which your own people think are crap Does that bother you think they would again as a hypothetical No This is real Well then dont We heard it today Well We heard it today this is a shitty deal this is crap heard nothing today that makes me think anything um went wrong Is there not a conflict when you sell something to somebody and then are determined to bet against that same security and you dont disclose that to the person youre selling it In the Do you see a problem In the context of marketmaking that is not a conflict When you heard that your employees in these emails said god what a shitty deal god what a piece of crap do you feel anything f think thats very unfortunate to have on email Are you b And and and very unfortunate dont dont On email How about feeling that way think its very unfortunate for anyone to have said that in any form Is it your understanding that your competitors were engaged in similar activities Uh yes And and to a greater extent than us in most cases Hedge fund manager John Paulson made billion dollars betting against the mortgage market When John Paulson ran out of mortgage securities to bet against he worked with Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank to create more of them Morgan Stanley was also selling mortgage securities that it was betting against and its now being sued by the government employees retirement fund of the Virgin Islands for fraud The lawsuit alleges that Morgan Stanley knew that the Os were junk Although they were rated Morgan Stanley was betting they would fail year later Morgan Stanley had made hundreds of millions of dollars while the investors had lost almost all of their money You would have thought that pension funds would have said those are subprime why am buying them And they had these guys at Moodys and Standard and Poors who said thats an None of these securities got issued without the imprimatur you know the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval of the rating agencies The three rating agencies Moodys and Fitch made billions of dollars giving high ratings to risky securities Moodys the largest rating agency quadrupled its profits between and Moodys and get compensated based on putting out ratings reports And the more structured securities they gave an rating to the higher their earnings were going to be for the quarter Imagine if you went to the New York Times and you said look if you write a positive story ll pay you dollars But if you dont ll give you nothing The rating agencies could have stopped the party and said Were sorry you know were going to tighten our standards This is a and and immediately cut off a lot of the flow of funding to risky borrowers rated instruments mushroomed from just a handful to thousands and thousands Hundreds of billions of dollars uh were being rated You know and Per year Per year oh yeah ve now testified before both houses of Congress on the credit rating agency issue And both times they trot out very prominent First Amendment lawyers and argue that when we say something is rated that is merely our opinion you shouldnt rely on it s ratings express our opinion Our ratings are uh are our opinions But theyre opinions Opinions and those are they are just opinions think we are emphasizing the fact that our ratings are uh uh are opinions They do not speak to the market value of a security the volatility of its price or its suitability as an investment We have so many economists coming on our air and saying oh this is a bubble and its going to burst and this is going to be a real issue for the economy Some say it could even cause a recession at some point What is the worstcase scenario if in fact we were to see prices come down substantially across the country Well guess dont buy your premise Its a pretty unlikely possibility Weve never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis Ben Bernanke became chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in February the top year for subprime lending But despite numerous warnings Bernanke and the Federal Reserve Board did nothing Robert Gnaizda met with Ben Bernanke and the Federal Reserve Board three times after Bernanke became chairman Only at the last meeting did he suggest that there was a problem and that the government ought to look into it When When was that What year Its March th in This year This year we met yes And so for the two previous years you met him even in Yes One of the six Federal Reserve Board governors serving under Bernanke was Frederic Mishkin who was appointed by President Bush in Did you participate in the semiannual meetings that uh Robert Gnaizda and and uh Greenlining had with the Federal Reserve Board Yes did was actually on the committee that uh that was involved involved with that the Consumer Community Affairs Committee He warned in an extremely explicit manner about what was going on and he came to the Federal Reserve Board with loan documentation of the kind of loans that were frequently being made And he was listened to politely and nothing was done Yeah So uh again dont know the details in terms of of uh of um uh in fact just dont eh eh whatever information he provide m not sure exactly eh uh its its actually to be honest with you cant remember the the this kind of discussion But certainly uh there there were issues that were uh uh coming up But then the question is how pervasive are they Why didnt you try looking think that people did We had people looking at a whole group of people looking at this for whatever reason Excuse me you cant be serious If you would have looked you would have found things Uh you know thats very very easy to always say that you can always find it As early as the was already warning about an epidemic of mortgage fraud They reported inflated appraisals doctored loan documentation and other fraudulent activity In the s chief economist Raghuram Rajan warned that dangerous incentives could lead to a crisis Then came Nouriel Roubinis warnings in Allan Sloans articles in Fortune magazine and the Washington Post in and repeated warnings from the said it and on behalf of the institution ah the crisis which is in front of us is a huge crisis Who did you talk to The government Treasury s Fed everybody In May of hedge fund manager Bill Ackman circulated a presentation called Whos Holding the Bag which described how the bubble would unravel And in early Charles Morris published his book about the impending crisis Easy Money High Rollers and the Great Credit Crash Youre just not sure what do you do And you you might have some suspicions that underwriting standards are being weakened but then the question is should you do anything about it By home foreclosures were skyrocketing and the securitization food chain imploded Lenders could no longer sell their loans to the investment banks and as the loans went bad dozens of lenders failed Chuck Prince of Citibank famously said that uh uh we have to dance until the music stops Actually the music had stopped already when he said that The market for Os collapsed leaving the investment banks holding hundreds of billions of dollars in loans Os and real estate they couldnt sell When the crisis started both the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve were totally behind the curve They did not understand the extent of it At what point do you remember thinking for the first time this is dangerous this is bad remember very well uh one think it was a meeting of February And remember discussing the issue with with Hank Paulson And clearly remember telling Hank we are watching this tsunami coming And you just proposing that we ask which swimming costume we are going to put on What was his response what was his feeling Things are pretty much under control Yes we are looking at this situation carefully and uh yeah its under control Were going to keep growing okay And obviously ll say it if youre growing youre not in recession right mean we all know that In March of the investment bank Bear Stearns ran out of cash and was acquired for two dollars a share by Morgan Chase The deal was backed by billion dollars in emergency guarantees from the Federal Reserve That was the time when the administration could have come in and put in place various kinds of measures that would have reduced system risk The information that m receiving from some entities is the end is not here that there are other shoes to fall ve seen those investment banks working with the Fed and the to strengthen their liquidity to strengthen their capital positions get reports all the time Our regulators are are very vigilant On September th Henry Paulson announced the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac two giant mortgage lenders on the brink of collapse Nothing about our actions today in any way reflects a changed view of the housing correction or the strength of other financial institutions Two days later Lehman Brothers announced record losses of billion dollars and its stock collapsed The effects of Lehman and in September still came as a surprise mean this is even after July and Fannie and Freddie So clearly there was stuff that as of September major stuff that nobody knew about think thats think thats fair Bear Stearns was rated like a month before it went bankrupt Uh more likely Yeah Okay is still not bankrupt No no no No Thats thats a high investment grade solid investmentgrade rating Lehman Brothers within days of failing Um within days of being bailed out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were when they were rescued Um Citigroup Merrill all all of them had investmentgrade ratings How can that be Well thats a good question Thats a great question At no point did the administration ever go to all the major institutions and say you know this is serious tell us what your positions are you know uh no bullshit where are you Well first thats what the regulators thats their job right Their job is to understand the exposure across these different institutions and they have a very refined uh understanding that think became more refined as the crisis um proceeded So Forgive me but thats clearly not true m What do you mean its not true In August of were you aware of the the credit ratings held then by Lehman Brothers Merrill Lynch and did you think that they were accurate Well uh e uh certainly by that time it was clear that that earlier credit ratings were inaccurate because they had been downgraded substantially No they hadnt Uh theres still there was still some downgrading in terms of the the industry concerns of the ind certainly the stock prices Not some all those firms were rated at least until a couple of days before they uh were rescued Well then you know then the answer is just dont dont know enough to really answer your question on this particular issue Governor Fred Mishkin is resigning effective August He says he plans to return to his teaching post at Columbias Graduate School of Business Why did you leave the Federal Reserve in August of mean in in the middle of the worst financial crisis So so uh that uh had to to revise a textbook His departure leaves the Fed board with three of its seven seats vacant just when the economy needs it most Well m sure your textbook is important and widely read But in August of you know some somewhat more important things were going on in the world dont you think By Friday September th Lehman Brothers had run out of cash and the entire investment banking industry was sinking fast The stability of the global financial system was in jeopardy That weekend Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner president of the New York Federal Reserve called an emergency meeting with the Os of the major banks in an effort to rescue Lehman But Lehman wasnt alone Merrill Lynch another major investment bank was also on the brink of failure And that Sunday it was acquired by Bank of America The only bank interested in buying Lehman was the British firm Barclays But British regulators demanded a financial guarantee from the government Paulson refused We all jumped into a yellow cab and went down to the Federal Reserve Bank They wanted the bankruptcy case commenced before midnight of September We kept pressing that this would be a uh terrible event And at some point used the word Armageddon Had they fully considered the consequences of what they were proposing The effect on the market would be extraordinary You said this Yes They just said they had considered all of the comments that we had made and they were still of the belief that in order to calm the markets and move forward it was necessary for Lehman to go into bankruptcy Calm the markets Yes When were you first told that Lehman in fact was going to go bankrupt Ah after the fact After the fact Wow Okay and what was your reaction when you learned of it Holy cow Paulson and Bernanke had not consulted with other governments and didnt understand the consequences of foreign bankruptcy laws Under British law Lehmans London office had to be closed immediately All transactions came to a halt And there are thousands and thousands and thousands of transactions The hedge funds that had had assets with Lehman in London discovered overnight to their complete horror that they couldnt get those assets back One of the points of the hub failed And that had huge knockon effects around the system The oldest money market fund in the nation wrote off roughly three quarters of a billion dollars in bad debt issued by the nowbankrupt Lehman Brothers Lehmans failure also caused a collapse in the commercial paper market which many companies depend on to pay for operating expenses such as payroll That means maybe they have to lay off employees they cant buy parts It stops business in its tracks Suddenly people stood and said Listen what can we believe in Theres nothing we can trust anymore That same week owed billion dollars to holders of credit default swaps and it didnt have the money was another hub If had stopped you know all planes may have to be you know stop flying On September th is taken over by the government And one day later Paulson and Bernanke ask Congress for billion dollars to bail out the banks They warn that the alternative would be a catastrophic financial collapse It was scary You know the entire system froze up every part of the financial system every part of the credit system Nobody could borrow money It was like a cardiac arrest of the global financial system am playing the hand that was dealt me a lot of what am dealing with you know m dealing with the consequences of things that were done often many years ago Secretary Paulson spoke throughout the fall And all the potential root causes of this and there are plenty he called em so m not sure Youre not being serious about that are you am being serious What what would you have expected m what are what were you looking for that you didnt see He was the senior advocate for prohibiting the regulation of credit default swaps and also lifting the leverage limits on the investment banks So a again what He mentioned those things never heard him mention those things can we turn this off for a second When was bailed out the owners of its credit default swaps the most prominent of which was Goldman Sachs were paid billion dollars the next day Paulson Bernanke and Tim Geithner forced to pay cents on the dollar rather than negotiate lower prices Eventually the bailout cost taxpayers over billion dollars hundred and sixty billion dollars went through billion went to Goldman Sachs At the same time Paulson and Geithner forced to surrender its right to sue Goldman and the other banks for fraud Isnt there a problem when the person in charge of dealing with this crisis is the former of Goldman Sachs someone who had a major role in causing it Well think its fair to say that the financial markets today are incredibly complicated supply urgently needed money On October th President Bush signs a billiondollar bailout bill But world stock markets continue to fall amid fears that a global recession is now underway The bailout legislation does nothing to stem the tide of layoffs and foreclosures Unemployment in the United States and Europe quickly rises to percent The recession accelerates and spreads globally began to get really scared cause hadnt foreseen the whole world going down at the same rate at the same time December of General Motors and Chrysler are facing bankruptcy And as consumers cut back on spending Chinese manufacturers see sales plummet Over million migrant workers in China lose their jobs the end of the day the poorest as always pay the most Here you can earn a lot of money like uh uh dollars per month As a farmer in the countryside you cannot earn as much money The workers just wire their salaries to their hometown To give to their families The crisis started in America We all know it will be coming to China Some of the factories try to cut off some workers Some people will get poor because they ll lose their jobs Life gets harder We were growing at about percent It was a super year And then we suddenly went to minus nine this quarter Exports collapsed And were talking like percent So we just took a hit you know fell off a cliff boom Even as the crisis unfolded we didnt know how wide it was going to spread or how severe it was going to be And we were still hoping that there would be some way for us to have a shelter and be uh less battered by the storm But it is not possible Its a very globalized world the economies are all linked together Every time a home goes into foreclosure it affects everyone who lives around that house Cause when that property goes on the market its going to be sold at a lower price maybe before it goes on the market it wont be well maintained We estimate another million homeowners will lose their homes We went out on a weekend to see what houses were for sale We saw one we liked The payment was going to be Everything was beautiful the house was very pretty The payment low Everything was We won the lottery But the reality was when the first payment arrived felt very bad for my husband because he works too much And we have three children The vast majority ve seen lately unfortunately are people who have just been hurt by the economy They were living you know day to day paycheck to paycheck and unfortunately that ran out And unemployment isnt going to pay a house mortgage its not going to pay a car bill was a logtruck driver And they shut down they shut down all the logging systems up there shut down the sawmills and everything So moved down here had a construction job And the construction jobs got shut down too so things are so tough theres a lot o people out there and pretty soon youre going to be seeing more camps like this around because theres just no jobs right now When the company did well we did well when the company did not do well sir we did not do well The men who destroyed their own companies and plunged the world into crisis walked away from the wreckage with their fortunes intact The top five executives at Lehman Brothers made over a billion dollars between and and when the firm went bankrupt they got to keep all the money The system worked It doesnt make any sense for us to make a loan thats going to fail cause we lose They lose the borrower loses the community loses and we lose Countrywides Angelo Mozilo made million dollars between and One hundred forty million came from dumping his Countrywide stock in the months before the company collapsed Ultimately hold the board accountable when a business fails Cause the board is responsible for hiring and firing the and overseeing big strategic decisions The problem with board composition in America is the way boards are elected The boards are pretty much in many cases picked by the The board of directors and the compensation committees are the two bodies best situated to determine the pay packages uh for executives How do you think they ve done over the past years Well think that if you look at those uh in would give about a Because Yes Not an Not an not an Stan Neal the of Merrill Lynch received million dollars in and alone After driving his firm into the ground Merrill Lynchs board of directors allowed him to resign and he collected million dollars in severance Instead of being fired Stan Neal is allowed to resign and takes away million dollars Thats a decision that that board of directors made at that point And what grade do you give that decision Uh thats a tougher one dont know if would give that one a as well Neals successor John Thain was paid million dollars in and in December of two months after Merrill was bailed out by taxpayers Thain and Merrills board handed out billions in bonuses In March of s Financial Products Division lost billion dollars Instead of being fired Joseph Cassano the head of was kept on as a consultant for a million dollars a month And you want to make sure that the key players and the key key employees uh within yeah we retain that intellectual knowledge attended a very interesting uh dinner organized by Hank Paulson a little more than one year ago with some officials and a couple of uh Os from the biggest uh banks in the And uh surprisingly enough all these gentlemen were arguing we were too greedy so we have part responsibility Fine And then they were turning to the treasurer to the secretary of the Treasury and say you should regulate more because we are too greedy we cant avoid it The only way to avoid this is to have more regulation have spoken to many bankers about this question including very senior ones And this is the first time that ve ever heard anybody say that they actually wanted their compensation to be regulated Yeah because it was at the moment where they were afraid And after when solution to the crisis began to appear then probably they they changed their mind In the the banks are now bigger more powerful and more concentrated than ever before There are fewer competitors and a lot of smaller banks have been taken over by big ones Morgan today is even bigger than it was before Morgan took over first Bear Stearns and then Bank of America took over Countrywide and Merrill Lynch Wells Fargo took over Wachovia After the crisis the financial industry including the Financial Services Roundtable worked harder than ever to fight reform he financial sector employs lobbyists more than five for each member of Congress Do you think the financial services industry has excessive political influence in the United States No think that every person in in the w in the country is represented here in Washington And you think that all segments of American society have equal and fair access to the system The you can walk into any hearing room uh that you would like Yes do Um one could walk into any hearing room one can not necessarily write the kind of lobbying checks that your industry writes or engage in the level of political contributions that your industry engages in Between and the financial industry spent over billion dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions And since the crisis theyre spending even more money The financial industry also exerts its influence in a more subtle way one that most Americans dont know about It has corrupted the study of economics itself Deregulation had tremendous financial and intellectual support Because uh uh people argued it for their own benefit economics profession was the main source of that illusion Since the s academic economists have been major advocates of deregulation and played powerful roles in shaping government policy Very few of these economic experts warned about the crisis And even after the crisis many of them opposed reform The guys who taught these things tended to get paid a lot of money being consultants Business school professors dont live on a faculty salary They do very very well Over the last decade the financial services industry has made about billion dollars worth of political contributions in the United States thats kind of a lot of money That doesnt bother you No Martin Feldstein is a professor at Harvard and one of the worlds most prominent economists s President Reagans chief economic advisor he was a major architect of deregulation And from until he was on the board of directors of both and Financial Products which paid him millions of dollars You have any regrets about having been on s board have no comments No have no regrets about being on s board None That can s absolutely none Absolutely none Okay Um You have any regrets about uh s decisions cannot say anything more about ve taught at Northwestern and Chicago Harvard and Columbia Glenn Hubbard is the dean of Columbia Business School and was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under George Bush Do you think the financial services industry has too much uh political power in the United States dont think so no You certainly you certainly wouldnt get that impression by the drubbing that they regularly get uh in Washington Many prominent academics quietly make fortunes while helping the financial industry shape public debate and government policy The Analysis Group Charles River Associates Compass Lexecon and the Law and Economics Consulting Group manage a multibilliondollar industry that provides academic experts for hire Two bankers who used these services were Ralph Ciofi and Matthew Tannin Bear Stearns hedge fund managers prosecuted for securities fraud After hiring The Analysis Group both were acquitted Glenn Hubbard was paid dollars to testify in their defense Do you think that the economics discipline has uh a conflict of interest problem m not sure know what you mean Do you think that a significant fraction of the economics discipline a number of economists have financial conflicts of interests that in some way might call into question or color Oh see what youre saying doubt it You know most academic economists uh you know arent wealthy business people Hubbard makes dollars a year as a board member of Met Life and was formerly on the board of Capmark a major commercial mortgage lender during the bubble which went bankrupt in He has also advised Nomura Securities Financial Corporation and many other financial firms Laura Tyson who declined to be interviewed for this film is a professor at the University of California Berkeley She was the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and then director of the National Economic Council in the Clinton administration Shortly after leaving government she joined the board of Morgan Stanley which pays her dollars a year Ruth Simmons the president of Brown University makes over dollars a year on the board of Goldman Sachs Larry Summers who as Treasury secretary played a critical role in the deregulation of derivatives became president of Harvard in While at Harvard he made millions consulting to hedge funds and millions more in speaking fees much of it from investment banks According to his federal disclosure report Summerss net worth is between million and million dollars Frederic Mishkin who returned to Columbia Business School after leaving the Federal Reserve reported on his federal disclosure report that his net worth was between million and million dollars In you coauthored a study of Icelands financial system Right right Iceland is also an advanced country with excellent institutions low corruption rule of law The economy has already adjusted to financial liberalization while prudential regulation and supervision is generally quite strong Yeah And that was the mistake That it turns out that uh that the prudential regulation and supervision was not strong in Iceland And particularly during this period So what led you to think that it was think that uh youre going with the information you have at and generally uh the view was that that uh hat Iceland had very good institutions It was a very advanced country Who told you that Who did what kind of research did you do you you talk to people you have faith in in uh the Central Bank which actually did fall down on the job Uh that uh clearly it this uh Why do you have faith in a central bank Well that faith you ya d because you ha go with the information you have Um how much were you paid to write it was paid uh think the number was uh its public information Uh on your the title of this report has been changed from Financial Stability in Iceland to Financial Instability in Iceland Oh Well dont know if itch whatever it is is the uh thing if its a typo theres a typo think what should be publicly available is whenever anybody does research on a topic they disclose if they have any financial conflict with that research But if recall there is no policy to that effect cant imagine anybody not doing that in terms of putting it in a paper You would there would be significant professional sanction for failure to do that didnt see any place in the study where you indicated that you had been paid uh by the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce to produce it No Okay Richard Portes the most famous economist in Britain and a professor at London Business School was also commissioned by the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce in to write a report which praised the Icelandic financial sector The banks themselves are highly liquid Theyve actually made money on the fall of the Icelandic krona These are strong banks their funding their market funding is assured for the coming year These are wellrun banks Richard thank you so much Like Mishkin Portess report didnt disclose his payment from the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce Does Harvard require disclosures of financial conflict of interest in publications Um not to my knowledge Do you require people to report the compensation they ve received from outside activities No Dont you think thats a problem dont see why Martin Feldstein being on the board of Laura Tyson going on the board of Morgan Stanley Larry Summers making million dollars a year consulting to financial services firms irrelevant well yeah basically irrelevant Youve written a very large number of articles about a very wide array of subjects You never saw fit to investigate the risks of unregulated credit default swaps never did Same question with regard to executive compensation the regulation of corporate governance the effect of political contributions What uh what uh w dont know that would have anything to add to those discussions m looking at your resume now It looks to me as if the majority of your outside activities are uh consulting and directorship arrangements with the financial services industry Is that would you not agree with that characterization No to my knowledge dont think my consulting clients are even on my so Uh who are your consulting clients dont believe have to discuss that with you Okay Look you have a few more minutes and the interview is over Do you consult for any financial services firms Uh the answer is do And And but d do not want to go into details about that Do they include other financial services firms Possibly You dont remember This isnt a deposition sir was polite enough to give you time foolishly now see But you have three more minutes Give it your best shot In at the height of the bubble Glenn Hubbard coauthored a widely read paper with William Dudley the chief economist of Goldman Sachs In the paper Hubbard praised credit derivatives and the securitization chain stating that they had improved allocation of capital and were enhancing financial stability He cited reduced volatility in the economy and stated that recessions had become less frequent and milder Credit derivatives were protecting banks against losses and helping to distribute risk medical researcher writes an article saying to treat this disease you should prescribe this drug It turns out Doctor makes percent of personal income from manufacturer of this drug Does not bother you think uh its certainly important to disclose the um the um Well think thats also a little different from cases that we are talking about here Because um um So uh what do you think this says about the economics discipline Well heh heh it has no relevance to anything really And indeed think um its a part of the its a important part of the problem The rising power of the financial sector was part of a wider change in America Since the s the United States has become a more unequal society and its economic dominance has declined Companies like General Motors Chrysler and Steel formerly the core of the economy were poorly managed and falling behind their foreign competitors And as countries like China opened their economies American companies sent jobs overseas to save money For many many years the million people in the developed world were effectively sheltered from all of this additional labor that existed on the planet Suddenly the Bamboo Curtain and the Iron Curtain are lifted and you have billion additional people American factory workers were laid off by the tens of thousands Our manufacturing base was destroyed literally over the course of a few years As manufacturing declined other industries rose The United States leads the world in information technology where highpaying jobs are easy to find But those jobs require an education And for average Americans college is increasingly out of reach While top private universities like Harvard have billions of dollars in their endowments funding for public universities is shrinking and tuition is rising Tuition for Californias public universities rose from dollars in the s to over dollars in Increasingly the most important determinant of whether Americans go to college is whether they can find the money to pay for it Meanwhile American tax policy shifted to favor the wealthy When first came to office thought taxes were too high and they were The most dramatic change was a series of tax cuts designed by Glenn Hubbard who at the time was serving as President Bushs chief economic advisor The Bush administration sharply reduced taxes on investment gains stock dividends and eliminated the estate tax We had a comprehensive plan that when acted has left nearly trillion in the hands of American workers families investors and small business owners Most of the benefits of these tax cuts went to the wealthiest percent of Americans And by the way it was really the cornerstone in many ways of our economic recovery policy Inequality of wealth in the United States is now higher than in any other developed country American families responded to these changes in two ways by working longer hours and by going into debt As the middle class falls further and further behind there is a political urge to respond by making it easier to get credit You dont have to have a lousy home The lowincome home buyer can have just as nice a house as anybody else American families borrowed to finance their homes their cars their healthcare and their childrens educations People in the bottom percent lost ground between and It all went to the top percent For the first time in history average Americans have less education and are less prosperous than their parents The era of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street and in Washington has led us to a financial crisis as serious as any that we have faced since the Great Depression When the financial crisis struck just before the election Barack Obama pointed to Wall Street greed and regulatory failures as examples of the need for change in America lack of oversight in Washington and on Wall Street is exactly what got us into this mess After taking office President Obama spoke of the need to reform the financial industry We want a systemicrisk regulator increased capital requirements We need a consumer financial protection agency we need to change Wall Streets culture But when finally enacted in mid the administrations financial reforms were weak and in some critical areas including the rating agencies lobbying and compensation nothing significant was even proposed Addressing Obama and quote regulatory reform my response if it was one word would be Ha There s very little reform How come Its a Wall Street government Obama chose Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary Geithner was the president of the New York Federal Reserve during the crisis and one of the key players in the decision to pay Goldman Sachs cents on the dollar for its bets against mortgages When Tim Geithner was testifying to be confirmed as Treasury secretary he said have never been a regulator Now that said to me he did not understand his job as president of the New York Fed The new president of the New York Fed is William Dudley the former chief economist of Goldman Sachs whose paper with Glenn Hubbard praised derivatives Geithners chief of staff is Mark Paterson a former lobbyist for Goldman and one of the senior advisors is Lewis Sachs who oversaw Tricadia a company heavily involved in betting against the mortgage securities it was selling To head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Obama picked Gary Gensler a former Goldman Sachs executive who had helped ban the regulation of derivatives To run the Securities and Exchange Commission Obama picked Mary Shapiro the former of the investmentbanking industrys selfregulation body Obamas chief of staff Rahm Emanuel made dollars serving on the board of Freddie Mac Both Martin Feldstein and Laura Tyson are members of Obamas Economic Recovery Advisory Board And Obamas chief economic advisor is Larry Summers The most senior economic advisors are the very people who were there who built the structure When it was clear that Summers and Geithner were going to play major roles as advisors knew this was going to be status quo The Obama administration resisted regulation of bank compensation even as foreign leaders took action think the financial industry is a service industry it should serve others before it serves itself In September of Christine Lagarde and the finance ministers of Sweden the Netherlands Luxembourg Italy Spain and Germany called for the nations including the United States to impose strict regulations on bank compensation And in July of the European Parliament enacted those very regulations The Obama administration had no response Their view is this is a temporary blip and things will go back to normal And that is why am reappointing him to another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Thank you so much Ben In Barack Obama reappointed Ben Bernanke Thank you Mr President As of mid not a single senior financial executive had been criminally prosecuted or even arrested no special prosecutor had been appointed not a single financial firm had been prosecuted criminally for securities fraud or accounting fraud The Obama administration has made no attempt to recover any of the compensation given to financial executives during the bubble certainly would think of criminal action against some of Countrywides top leaders like Mozilo d certainly look at Bear Stearns Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch For criminal prosecutions Yes Yes Theyd be very hard to to win But think they could do it if they got enough underlings to tell the truth In an industry in which drug use prostitution and fraudulent billing of prostitutes as a business expense occur on an industrial scale it wouldnt be hard to make people talk if you really wanted to They gave me a plea bargain and took it Um they were not interested in any of my records they werent interested in anything They were not interested in your records Thats correct Thats correct There is a sensibility that you dont use peoples personal vices in the context of Wall Street cases necessarily to get them to flip think maybe its after the cataclysms that weve been through maybe people will reevaluate that m not the one to pass judgment on that right now You come to us today telling us were sorry we didnt mean it we wont do it again trust us Well have some people in my constituency that actually robbed some of your banks And they say the same thing Theyre sorry they didnt mean it they wont do it again In as unemployment hit its highest level in years Morgan Stanley paid its employees over billion dollars and Goldman Sachs paid out over billion In bonuses were even higher Why should a financial engineer be paid four four times to a hundred times more than the a real engineer real engineer build bridges a financial engineer build build dreams And when those dream turn out to be nightmares other people pay for it For decades the American financial system was stable and safe But then something changed The financial industry turned its back on society corrupted our political system and plunged the world economy into crisis At enormous cost we ve avoided disaster and are recovering But the men and institutions that caused the crisis are still in power and that needs to change They will tell us that we need them and that what they do is too complicated for us to understand They will tell us it wont happen again They will spend billions fighting reform It wont be easy But some things are worth fighting for
