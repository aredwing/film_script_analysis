the Army invented a nonexistent position for Papershredding sergeant because she doesnt know how to type or transfer a phone call That you want to transfer to the City because the desert dries out

Livanat Fuck Shit Yes m coming We dont have to wait for the investigation to know this was a disaster Its not enough that a soldier in our unit committed suicide She wasnt even a soldier She was an impostor Five Sergeants sitting in one office and no one even thought about it She didnt have a military card no dog tag She did have them Rama heard she stole a drill instructors backpack in a bathroom in Beer Sheeva But if a soldier is coming and no one reported him and hes not on any lists You need to report to me immediately You said you didnt have time for it Come again Thats what you told Dafi That you didnt have time for this nonsense You have a bad attitude you know that Yeah youve told me like times m not supposed to individually take care of every soldier that arrives on this base You know why Because its not my job m supposed to oversee your job not do it myself If one of you would have bothered to call and find out or told me there was a problem You could have saved her life And your ass My ass Yeah Whats the deal with blaming us Youre the officer here Be accountable for this will be accountable for this For the fact that my soldiers have the worst attitudes will be held accountable for that swear Zohar will make a person out of you You wont go on vacation on my shift Youre denied of vacation You already did that So another one Would you like another Its already three How about learning to count Youre right m wrong Make it four vacations Shall continue Rama Lets go over the details again She arrived with Dafi yesterday morning at Lets continue this

find some time to do your job We thought we didnt recycle anymore so we threw everything together Can you shred this too please Sincerely Dafta Tsafrir Chief of General Staff Subject Personal request for transfer Whats this You never sent my letters Dafi cant believe youve been lying to me all this time wasnt lying Yes you were and you pretended to help me Hey worked really hard on these letters and you never sent them You didnt send them saved you from the humiliation They would probably end up in the trash or or even worse on some wall as a joke You think my biggest dream is a joke Your biggest dream is a little lame dont you think mean making coffee in the City instead of here At least here you have me Do you think you can find a best friend like me just anywhere hope never find a friend like you again Yeah have no idea where you can find someone that will wait an hour and a half for you in Beer Sheeva so you dont have to walk in to the base alone So youre doing me a favor Okay m sorry was pissed off at the Army for no reason Youre the one that doesnt give a damn about me and youre the reason m still here You know what Go ahead and send your whiny letters you naive baby Lets see who will actually care Maybe the Chief of Staff Explain to me whats so appealing about the City for you At the end of boot camp they let me choose three bases so wrote Town City Town understand that but why Usually someone who wants to serve in the City wants to be closer to home but youre from Haifa But ll live in Tel Aviv and have a real life You know that Kiryat is a commuter base For a soldier that doesnt live in Central Israel the has to organize them a place to live and pay for a portion of the rent Its not that simple But cant stay here any longer Anati Anat Fill out the reasons for the transfer request and put it in my mailbox ll try to forward the request but itll take some time hated my old base too but didnt act like it was such a tragedy So how did you leave went in for Officer Training Thanks Is everything alright remember her You start with this line and then step into me remember it remember it from the store remember it remember she bought some semolina ve remembered it a long time since the third grade Personnel Department Yes Hi can please get a transfer form Hi What transfer form This is the personnel department isnt it What are you leaving Can you give this to Dafi forgot to give it back to her So do you have one What transfer form Yeah She Has it Okay thanks m not kidding Rama Can you repeat that said want Louder To think bigger to think about what can give and not about what can take d like to be an officer like Rama m honored to have such a role model Very impressive And its important for me to say that Rama isnt to blame for the incident It was us the receptionists that made the mistake Myself It seems like there are plenty of mistakes here The guilty person was the front gate guard who allowed a civilian in with a fake military card Okay Anyway it wasnt Rama Boaz are you with me m still on the line Anything else Yes Shakedi m here Are you sitting down m about to tell you something insane Listen Wow Dafi you really put it together Whos next Liati right Gd forbid We didnt say that Rama You also want to go to officer training Ok is everyone here am very proud of our Dafi Who came here six months ago Seven and a half months ago She had a lot of difficulties as we all know but shes decided to become a solider with high motivation and get rid of bad influences And now shes going to become an officer to the glory of Israel Cheers Hold on m not done yet ask that we not only consider it a personal case for Dafi but proof that each of us has a point from which everything starts and from which the sky is the limit Cheers would also like to say thanks to Rama who gave me a chance and wrote me a great recommendation Cheers Yeah cheers Just dont get drunk Yeah you can totally get drunk off of grape juice ll be in my room Her dream about being a receptionist in the city Its going to come true ll be an officer in the City How do you know where youll be placed You know Guy Shefi the officer So he is transferring there and hes going to place me in his department Hey dont you think its hilarious that the most spoiled soldier that has to take a nap that wont touch anything that showers in her bathing suit that has as many allergies and medical excuses as grains of sand in this desert is going to be an officer in the So what are you going to be ll be the head officer in a Lt Colonels office Wow Thats good Zohar did

It only takes one mistake in order to fail And the inspection is random Random is incidental Do you understand what that means What does it mean That we could use a little luck That we need to go through every binder every page check and update because those who count on luck Zohar weve seen what happens to them Rama well never be able to update everything here Do you realize the mess in this

Youre no longer possessed Thats what happened Rama listen Tehilas ghost possessed Irena while she was sleeping in her bed And then she sent Irena to avenge all the assholes that hurt her and And now Tehilas ghost left Irenas body And thats the reason Irena doesnt recall any of it called the infirmary and asked if you were there Guess what Right we werent in the infirmary but that has nothing to do with it What would you do if you were me What m asking you What would you do In regards to what In regards to you What would you do if you were me cant imagine a situation like that Go to the

Look we dont have the quota to promote you What but why isnt there a quota There was only one quota for noncombatants and the Education Office got it Rama Its ok Youre getting discharged Is it because m a woman The education officer is a woman Yeah Rama youve been outstanding and no one can take that away from you Dont think overlooked the fact that youre talented and dedicated But looking at other aspects personal communication and the ability to command efficiently are also very important for a military career To Rama and Liat Good luck in your future endeavors Thank you Boaz Damn Shira left
