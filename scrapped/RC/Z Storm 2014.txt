Law Tak Wings personal and company accounts He did not withdraw large sums of money in the last few months What about offshore accounts All accounts are clean If Law Tak Wing bought off Wong Man Bin he would have destroyed the evidence ahead of time When Wong Man Bin showed up in his office he wouldnt have that kind of reaction If it wasnt Law Tak Wing who paid off Wong Man Bin case within a case Siu Leung Pa Joe On Tat follow Law Tak Wing round the clock want to know the people he contacts Tammy Tammy Hey Luk Sir look at this searched Law Tak Wing this is the breaking news from minutes ago
