morning Have you heard about this heir business Dont pay too much attention to these rumours Rebecca But hes here Hes with the board now As executor can tell you that Mr Winchs desire was always very clear The one and only heir to his fortune has to be his adopted son But theres no rhyme or reason to it mean heres a boy from Lord knows where and who claims to be the heir of the worlds fifth largest fortune Its outrageous Mr Wallenberg have you previously met or even glimpsed this young man Nerios always liked to keep his secrets secret Have you yes or no met this man before today No So in short nobody knows you Where is the proof You must think were stupid young man You dont know whom youre dealing with here With good lawyers we could drag this out for years And that is exactly what were going to do Mister Kwan is that right Thats right yes William Kwan Nerio admired your university career Princeton Harvard Your mother must be very proud of you after raising you on her own Do you still check the knot of your tie everytime you feel awkward Nerio told me about you Nerio told me about everyone of you So believe me know exactly whom m dealing with Nerio anticipated your reactions Shortly after was adopted he transferred all his majority holdings to the Anstalt based in Liechtenstein Now Mr Wallenberg could you explain to our friends here the specific workings of that company The shares are bearer shares In other words the person who physically has those shares is the owner of the company In this way the company can be passed on without paying any inheritance tax and to become the new owner the heir has only to recover the shares Ten shares to be precise Ten shares hidden in a location that am the only one to know about And thats all the proof that need Now of course if you still feel like contacting your lawyers please go ahead just spoke to Miss Pennywinkle There is no way youll be able to have an appointment with the heir before next week Next week Surely you dont intend to run the Group have only one attention Find out who killed Nerio Winch Until someone proves otherwise his death was accidental You believe so believe someone has decided to take over the

Icham Let him go Forgive him Icham always likes to do his job properly Such a rare quality these days Thats right m going down to the spa Naomi divine isnt she Surprising m going to buy out the Group You think so Does that sound familiar ve heard of it Of course youve heard of it Its an investment fund that as we speak owns Six percent of the Group And do you know who this fund belongs to To you For the last few weeks ve been buying out all the available shares of the Group And know exactly who to buy them from Thanks to a certain Meyer m the storys bad guy Youre perfect Nerios death has upset the market So today m shifting into higher gear In exactly twenty minutes ll be announcing my takeover bid preferred to tell you in person find it more more elegant didnt know gun running brought in so much They They always say the first billion is suspect Two weeks from now ll be at the head of the Group and believe me everyone will forget the errors of my youth If its respectability youre after there are more effective ways Give your billion to And believe me Everyone will forget the errors of your youth as you say With a little bit of luck you might even receive the Nobel Peace Prize Why not But everything in its time First m going to buy you out You know youre wasting your time The groups capital is blocked hold a majority share From what hear that has yet to be proved You dont have to worry about that Come in Be gentle please Very good madam That was a quick lunch Ever since was in jail ve lost my appetite You were in jail very pretty girl put me there She vanished after a very pleasant night But left a souvenir in my pocket What do you know about her Nothing Well remember one particular thing beauty mark on her buttock the left one think Or the right m not sure ll get another masseur Take your clothes off Lie down ll be back in two minutes Your car is ready Find out all you can about her Freddy After she got me arrested this girl told a friend where to find me Perhaps she fell madly in love with you Or letting your friend know was part of the trap What trap Youll find out sooner or later Republic of Croatia years earlier See they havent changed a thing Not defending yourself soldier When do you finish In six months But ll sign on for longer That was my last year here And the photos at Vlatkos party In the green album think ll get it He wont say where he adopted me Was this the place have the right to know Hannah m categorical Adopted children have no legal access to their files Listen ve come a long way Do me a favour let me take a look Its important for me The law is the law didnt make it Hands up bastard What are you doing here hesitated about posting bail for you think pitied you Thanks for everything Well have good news and bad news The bad The good first spent the night there and got into the archives looked everywhere searched the whole place But your file wasnt there It must be someplace else asked All the files are there m sorry Largo Mister Korsky what are your comments today on the Winch Corporation takeover had a great admiration for Nerio Winch But today think my takeover bid is the best possible thing that could happen to the group which bears his name And what is your next move m going to buy some sweets Thank you Korskys takeover bid is warmly welcomed on the markets This smells bad Very bad With the blocking minorities called into play Korsky is going to be like poison Lets work out an agreement Its the most sensible thing to do No What do you suggest counter takeover bid on Korsky You dont do things by halves Nerio knew that Korsky was plotting something We had a defence plan Just in case And as you all know Nerios best defence was attack Except that youre going to be attacking a ghost company The Korsk shareholder base is spread out over a host of companies based in various tax heavens Korsky probably bought out Meyer but ve got one better ve got someone in his personnal entourage Whos your spy That doesnt matter Only the result matters Take a look Korskys best kept secret You see my dear Mister Kwan the Korsks shareholder base isnt so mysterious We have options on of the shares Our takeover bid will be a complete surprise And a crushing victory Lets not get ahead of ourselves The law obliges us to inform the other company that it is the object of a takeover bid Korsky will have time to find a riposte If a takeover bid is made by a private individual acting in his own name there is no need to announce it They wont see it coming My rough guess is that such an operation could cost three billion Do you have that much in your account No dont Well dont have it on me And thats what bankers are for Largo William you have to lend him the money You cant be serious You want Korsky to eat us alive Youre asking me to lend three billion to some kid from God knows where You must be dreaming At least wait until Mondays general meeting No we dont have the time refuse to take that risk without any guarantees What if give you t he shares in the Anstalt as a guarantee Ms Kwan Would that suit you ll be back with the shares in hours Youll appreciate the irony of this Largo The impostor is suddenly our saviour little too simple Show me the telephone Miss Pennywinckle gave you will be enough to track you Alright You wont say where youre going You like secrets Like your father spent years at his side without even suspecting your existence years earlier For how long Two years minimum Renewable Let me through Excuse me a second Carry on m listening My orphanage file want it dont know what you mean went there went to the orphanage Who told you Forget that went there My files the only one missing You should have told me You dont go behind my back You never

history So youll give it back to me Who do you think you are want my file dont have it Liar Dont insult your father Youre not my father Thats not for you to decide Give me that file back burned it Find yourself another heir Republic of Croatia Josip would never let you listen to that You got my message How long can you stay Thats Freddy He called minutes ago Freddy have stuff on Naomi Korskys girl Shes a sort of escort girl often involved in shady business deals Who does she work for Money And for Korsky Shes been with him a month But she vanished this morning Korskys going frantic How do

Who are you working for For you Mister Winch Drop the knife asked you a question And gave you an order suppose these people work for me too Model employees can see that hope you get a risk bonus Dont shoot Dont shoot him Now we can shoot him You should have heeded your instinct You knew someone was pulling the strings Someone who wanted you to fetch the shares since you alone knew where they were hidden And now What do you plan to do Largo Hannah Hannah Hannah Hannah What do you mean vanished He was supposed to be here last night cant reach him No one knows where he is Is this some kind of a joke knew it We have to cancel the general meeting Well prepare a press release We have to find an excuse To panic the shareholders And pave the way for Korsky certainly not Youre out of your depth wont let you lead this group to its ruin am acting in the sole interest of the group Unlike you for have no personal ambition You dont have the stature for it And youre losing your cool Largo Winch is our only chance of survival The general meeting is maintained And youll better not stop praying that Nerios heir appears dont think thats the best thing that could happen to us Your Largo Winczlav escaped from a prison in South America where he was being held for drug trafficking An international warrant for his arrest was issued out this morning Good news Well end up finding him now You still think that this heir is the best way to save the Group The general meeting will go ahead as planned tomorrow We have hours to come up with a solution Hi Largo Dont worry didnt recognize you either You

orphanage file Largos relationship with his adopted father had become strained in recent years You know Largo is wanted for drug trafficking Yes was informed of that When he heard that Largo was on drugs and dealing Mr Winch decided to change his heir And he gave him these The shares in the Zunkunft Anstalt Sadness yes But also joy The joy of continuing his work of respecting his memory Today friends partners rivals we should take a moment to remember his life It all started on the th of august in a little village in BosniaHerzegovnia Born into a modest family Nerio Winchs childhood was in his own words difficult Are you crazy want all the gates closed Yes sir All the gates are closed sir Nerio Winch was one of those men who were born to change the world they live in And a bottle of wine dont know The best Too late Largo No not yet Look at yourself And look at me Whos going to want you as the heir Who This group this money theyre mine As much as yours Deep down you started it all You shouldnt have asked me to go with you that night looked for your file for hours knew it mattered to you didnt find it But came across something much more interesting for me When he first went there Nerio Winczlav left with two children Me And you Largo He knew hed come back for you one day so he took two children Hannah and Josip couldnt have kids He gave them the gift of a child Me And to you he gave a destiny dont believe in luck dont believe in coincidence believe that each man holds his destiny in his hands He would have told me He always wanted to make all the decisions Your life Mine Hannahs should never have found out But unfortunately did wanted Nerio to know he didnt control everything went to see him threatened to go public with it And he gave you money But he made a mistake He told Ferguson everything Ferguson found me and she offered me much much more money than he did On one condition That head the group and be content with the dividends Put it inside You can understand why accepted Did you accept Hannahs death too What are you talking about Shed dead Goran They killed her Listen ll grab his gun while you smash his head in What You heard me right Do it Your father struggled too Its nothing Everythings fine Just fine Today we are at a turning point in our history Our founder has passed away group with an appalling reputation has made a hostile takeover bid against us But we must stick together to fight it What do you want Leaving a surprise in store for us which will ensure the continued success of our group My dear friends twentyseven

When Nerio told me he had cancer he also told me about his heir asked about him d never leave the group in the hands of some wild adventurer like Largo It was madness on Nerios part whim In months
