dogs Well one night old Van Dorn wants to join the hunt He wants to bag himself a bird and he does Its big its beautiful colors like a rainbow That bird goes down over the horizon Them dogs take off Thing is they dont come back So we go charging after em and we find them and theyre tearing that bird to pieces Limb from limb eating pieces whole blood on their snouts and its in their teeth and Van Dorn tells me to put them dogs down Once they got the taste for it they cant be trusted Didnt feel right but it was an order He told me to do it and so shot them dogs in the head right then and there
