the Amish to fight Yes maam Then why would you few years ago an Englisher cornered me He said that we Amish turn our noses up at the sacrifices of others and that we were weak because we dont believe in picking up the sword He said he had a son who died in the war so that we Amish could have our freedom Bay it takes just as much courage to turn the other cheek to an enemy as it does going into war know that But also know that had a calling to serve my county The county that we call our home too And after two tours of duty reckoned d done my part So youre coming home to repent of your ways No maam Why do you come to us With your permission to see Katie After disappearing on her to know my actions must have her something awful She pined for years She was so beside herself with grief she ran

sure and for certain Deer Mom and Dad write with the news that Laura Mayfield is very much alive But something strange is happening There is an imposter here posing as me as Katie Lapp She dresses in Amish clothing speaks with our accent but can tell she is pretending Everyone believes she is me especially Laura But Laura is so fragile and sick If were to come forward with the truth m certain it would cause her much distress just dont know what to do Its a beautiful day isnt it Yes maam Hm dont think weve properly met Katherine right Are you enjoying working here being part of our little family Very much Huh Katherine is the name gave to Katie when she was born You know theres a whole secret language of flowers In the Victorian times people coded messages in owers and oral arrangements expressing their feelings for each other feelings that otherwise had to remain silent Like blue violets meant faithfulness Almond owers hope Red roses always mean love didnt know that Be like a ower Katherine Ahh Be beautiful rain or shine Mama Mama There you are ve been looking everywhere for you Do you like it here Yeah Very much Because m with you Oh Its a lot to take in isnt it

suppose am Mama do you know about Rumspringa We call that our running around years Its for young people to see the English world and help them decide if they If they want to commit a lifetime to the

while was there What about you Katie Lapp Your parents told me that youre baptized so are you going to return to the community Shes going to slay here Become heir to my estate Ah Thats wonderful gut news But its important for me to explain it to my folks you understand dont want them to worry For sure and for certain suppose its best considering your shunning and all Shunning Katie you didnt tell me that Well dont really Yeah What did you say apologized for bringing up such a painful topic Well have an idea you get reacquainted with a walk in the garden Oh thats very kind of you maam actually have to be on my way just wanted to shop by for a quick hello Well m so grateful you did cousin Let me walk you out Goodbye Bye By the way Jacob how did you find me Your mom told me that you were

the world d want to make sure she was okay Yeah okay Goodbye Katherine tell me about yourself Well love to play my guitar and sing songs that worship God Hm That must sound oldfashioned to a man like you Heh Its very oldfashioned But thats what like about you Katherine Youre not like the girls normally meet Mr Wirth Justin Remember Sorry Justin have something need to tell you Something very important Okay ve discovered something Mmhm That needs bringing forward m sorry Hold that thought Mr Yates Right now You sure it cant wait All right Hold on Katherine m really sorry need to take this call Foundation matter ll make it quick okay Yeah Mr Bennett thought we needed to talk privately Katherine Or is it Katie Lapp Why dont we just stop pretending thought recognized your voice the other day And then last night when you rushed to Lauras side it became clear m not the only one whos been pretending am Whos been lying Who told me Mrs Bennett had died never said she died said it was too late and that remains true That makes no sense When Laura came back from Pennsylvania never having once seen you because your parents just wouldnt allow it her cancer came back And had a decision to make Never in my wildest imagination did actually believe there was a chance of you actually turning up here So hired someone to be Katie just wanted Lauras final days on this earth to be happy Joyful m sorry how this turned out but thats why tried to discourage you from coming when you called that day Thats not the only reason Just because m Amish doesnt mean dont know what an heir is There is nothing untoward about this Its a mere formality Laura is handing everything off to her foundation Having Alyson here Thats her name Alyson Makes the legal process simpler It goes from Laura to the foundation with a simple signature That is all it is Katie hope you understand how devastating this little mixup will be if it ever comes out Laura means the world to me and can see you care about her too do Well Laura loves that girl She believes shes her daughter And that belief is more important than turning this whole thing upside down Wouldnt you agree m sorry for coming here ll pack my things and leave first thing in the morning Thank you Katie Thank you Mr Bennett Oh uh Justin Hello popped in for a coffee saw our favorite new employee sitting here and thought d say hello Thanks for keeping my seat warm Oh yes of course And you two have a fabulous brunch We will And thank you for the good conversation Katherine Huh Where were we You had something you wanted to tell me Oh m very sorry m not feeling very well Would you mind terribly taking me back to the estate Yeah sure Sure What are you doing We had a guest today a distant cousin of Katie Lapps From Hickory Hollow Fulton told me on my way through the door So you can understand why m pretty freaked out Was a distant cousin Did he recognize youre not her dont know dont think so Then were probably all right All we have to do is remain calm and try and make it through the signing m not betting on probably cant believe said yes to this job in the first place You said yes to this job because youre making more money on this gig than you do as an actor No no no Let me pass Please cant do it anymore gotta get out of here feel like cant breathe dont care about the money care about the money anymore Whether these little bears are real or whether theyre an actors trick dont care What you have to understand is is that we are committing a felony here And the only way out of it is through it Fine Fine ll be back for the signing Mrs Bennett Katherine m sorry maam didnt mean to disturb you knocked but Its all right Are you okay Mrs Bennett Its been a tough hours Katie left to see her parents She needed to tell them

Yates will be escorting her back to Manhattan which by the way will be his last official duty for my law firm Your very generous rife will not be prosecuting either of you But just so were clear
