found mummified At the crime scene a card was left The devil was depicted on it This makes number eight All victims were ambassadors of the great countries This case has become the major topic all over the world Some media are debating whether it is the curse of the devil For that reason the great figures of the East and West have gathered and have decided to hold a large scale exorcism ceremony Bunch of fools Either way because the ambassador of our country has fallen victim as well we can no longer ignore the matter The Queen demands you to close this case soon Tell her Majesty that will not fail her This all started with the finding of the first mummy three weeks ago Thereafter more people were reported to be found turning into mummies alive in succession This case is

bound and foot here by the Devils Curse case Witnesses testified to having seen a man clad in a black swallowtail killing twelve men on his own On his own This was found at the scene Please have a look at these files Impossible It belongs to the Watchdog serving the Queen of the West Its the evil nobleman who kills and spies by order of the Queen In this country too there are informants who will take any crude measure never mind involving innocent citizens But those are just rumors right If the Queens Watchdog truly exists it will pose a great danger to our nation We should eradicate him You cannot get permission with speculations only Well then please pretend you heard nothing Please excuse me have indeed heard nothing However Mr Tokizawa If youre going to eradicate the Watchdog Make sure the pet owner will not find out Thank you very much Well then meeting adjourned Is work like playing house to you Forgive me Have you found out anything If theres anything can do for you dont hesitate to ask Kiyoharu Thank you very much aunt Long time ago Earl of the West Ernest Phantomhive moved to our nation and has gone by the name Genpou The Genpou family has achieved great wealth through the production and sales of toys through the generations Their business was still expanding but one day the third Generation Earl Arihito Genpou and his wife Erika were assaulted and assassinated Assassinated Yes Ever since their only daughter Shiori has been missing However half a month after the incident Arihitos bastard son a child named Kiyoharu appeared along with him a man clad in black Presently that Kiyoharu is running the family To think hed be able to succeed with that background It has been the rule that only men can succeed the Genpou family business At that time there had been many suspicions towards Kiyoharu but profiling has proved his identity Erikas sister Hanae Wakatsuki his only relative supports Kiyoharu as his guardian Under the cooperation of Kiyoharu and Hanae the Genpou family business has grown even more While there had been many against it Kiyoharu succeeded the Earldom The Evil Nobleman Have lost again Anthony died in the back alley of the ghettos According to witness testimony he turned into a mummy in an instant As to where he had been and what he did there is still unclear This is what the police forces investigation has yielded so far How do you always obtain this kind of information The Queens Watchdog keeps a dog at his beck and call as well By all means please continue your investigation on Anthony Campelles death have great expectations of you fourth generation Earl Why do you like cats so much They are my only true companions Were leaving What car would you prefer today Small one Anthonys body will be

Earl have awaited you arrival But do you know why have brought this body here do not just know altered the orderdata Now am the one who instructed you to bring his body If you keep silent all theres left is your payment Out of my way Very well five minutes Its the wrapper of a cigar From Cuba it seems Very rare these days This is all theres to be found it seems Its time Young master you have forgotten this How did you know that there is a wine spot hidden in the handkerchief There was a piece of wrapper between the corpses teeth From that reasoned that the victim did not use a cigarcutter but his teeth But judging from his polished shoes and fine suit that person must have been a refined gentleman For him to do something like this it is conceivable that he had been quite drunk Therefore reasoned that he must have used the handkerchief to wipe off the wine from his lips at least once or twice For a demon you sure are passionate about playing detective As the Genpou family butler what would do if could not accomplish something of this level Of course you too must have noticed Rotten butler that you are Then you know the brand of the wine too Chteau Bonheur of year Find the distribution route of the cigar and wine Theyre both famous brands As you command High class club While it looks like a common club house from the outside there is an underground venue available to selected members only It looked like secret events were being held there have investigated all distribution routes Only that one place has both the cigar and wine available Then before Anthony turned into a mummy he must have been there Most probably see Whats in the envelope must have been the invitation to the party Get me the list of attendees Here it is In order to attend you will need to be introduced by someone Between these people there must be someone aunt knows She must be able to provide me with something if ask her ll speak her about it tomorrow Well then will contact Lady

product they all rushed here with apparent glee Well then let them serve as our test subjects It is time ladies and gentlemen We will now present you the new drug you all have longed for This is the drug finally perfected after long years of research Its name Necrosis Please do not be hasty Necrosis is enjoyed like this The liquid from the capsule will evaporate and the substance of the drug will be released into the air Once you breathe it in you will be able to enter heaven Are you all enjoying the sensation of climbing the staircase to heaven Isnt it far more thrilling than any other drug Thats right Just like you suspect That drug is indeed the secret behind the Devils Curse First you nose will bleed Next from your ears and lastly your eyes Your heart will race to its limit and your body will dry up instantly From the evaporation of the drug of the capsule to the loss of effect takes approximately fifteen minutes But there is one way to save your lives This is the antidote to Necrosis However taking one will definitely save you from death but the chances of brain damage are extremely high In order to return to your former health you will have to take at least two Ah Once

Please look This is our world in miniature We have obtained wonderful test experiences indeed As long as we have the Necrosis and its antidote we can control the world with fear This is the formula to success What joke is this Young master Young master Are you alright young master Young master Young master Young master Rin stay calm You alright Were all damned if the glass breaks Hold your breath Hurry That Bastard Stop fooling around were going back Call Mr Satou As you command The true identity of the Devils Curse is a drug called Necrosis drug When the victim walked out of the shop Kujo probably handed him the cigar containing Necrosis and slipped the Devils card into his pocket The victim inhaled the Necrosis wrapped in the cigar No No and died while under despair Using the Devils card to complete the crime scene it also indicated the completion of the mummy So the mastermind is Kujo No he has already been murdered He was used by that weapon dealer Theres no doubt that the one who ordered Necrosis and killed Kujo was Shinozaki If the weapon dealer was behind this Even though he has technique and money in abundance his awareness of danger is in contrast lacking This country has been exploited But dont worry ll go to Shinozaki presently Make the preparations Understood Young master What is it The police wish to speak you and Mr Sebastian Today is the day all important figures will gather for the mass exorcism ceremony Please refrain from causing any trouble Cant be helped Go Act befittingly you hear me As you command There are exceptions to all matters This place too is acknowledged as an exception within the police force Thats strange theres no one to be seen ll leave for a bit Meanwhile these three will take care of you Do as you please Please take your time You can relax but thats only for now Very soon youll miss me to death But m afraid wont come back for you then Be prepared Well then Shall we start the interrogation Interrogation Ah am very sorry fear do not have sufficient time on my hands for keeping you company Going through the trouble to kill them on the sheet Do they plan to erase them without leaving any sign of murder have acted befittingly my Lord Young master Rin What are you doing here was instructed not to leave the young master behind Again You Rin The moment tread on the sheet ll be killed Young master Shinozaki But why Wasnt he behind all this see now It had been my question from the start For the culprit to go out of their way to leave the Devils card behind making the case stand out If the development of the drug was their only goal there would have been no need for this It was to gain attention from the world That time the reason was not killed was because as the Watchdog they needed me to report Shinozaki to be the culprit to the Queen Therefore they let me live Then the culprit is likely to use Necrosis to create greatscale terrorism His goal a place to gain worldwide attention Today is the day all important figures will gather for the mass exorcism ceremony With this timing there should be no better occasion than using the exorcism ceremony to propagate the Necrosis thread to the world If all people have disappeared from this building and they can make it look like they have fled anyone would suspect Shinozaki and his men All the more because his company is rumored to have made deals with terrorist syndicates People will think that Necrosis has fallen into the hands of terrorist and the world will be subjected to a state of fear They sure make wonderful scapegoats Young master Dont This way please Here with that gun Rin will distract them please run have been told since was a child that should protect the Genpou family with my life My family has lived for that purpose alone for generations Therefore please run my Lady Shiori Rin You That day failed to protect my Lord and Lady Even you were taken away had thought about ending my life But you returned In order to assume the position as Watchdog you even disguised yourself as a boy My Lady no matter how useless have proved to be at cooking or cleaning you still kindly kept me by your side At last am able to show you my gratitude Rin Thank you for everything Please hurry have long ago prepared myself for the consequences of serving the evil noblemen Mr Sebastian Why are you here Young master Aunt Kiyoharu Please bring me to the exorcism ceremony Exorcism ceremony Rescue our precious servant without fail When youre done head to the ceremony immediately Act befittingly you hear me have been instructed to rescue our precious servant without fail Those words are wasted on me Well then are you prepared for the consequences This is not the way No this is the correct way detonator Have you ever seen it up close before This is Indeed Necrosis Because you were muffled up last time you couldnt see it well right What are you doing In just minutes all within the radius of one kilometer will turn into mummies Surely this will become the terrorist attack that will shake the entire world That is when will publish this photo Because you made a mess of the scene the plan to frame Shinozaki and his men failed So now have no choice but to push the blame on the Queen How dare you Which reminds me that eye of yours At this moment in accordance with your order Sebastian is now rescuing Rin and headed for the exorcism ceremony Without your order he will not move is what you said right Your demon that is knew You gave in to the curse passed down the Genpou family and sold your soul to the devil However once ve killed you therell be nothing left to fear That day father and mother were murdered Everything was taken away from me That is why sold my soul to the devil to take revenge will not die Youre pathetic in the face of defeat expected nothing more from someone whod sell their soul to the devil However things cannot always go your way Is this what you are looking for will return this to you Sebastian Why are you here Rescue our precious servant without fail When youre done head to the ceremony immediately Act befittingly you hear me The real meaning behind befittingly is If it is to protect my master can act freely Which is why did not go to the ceremony instead used personal contacts for access to information regarding to this place Just like thought found you extremely suspicious When saw the documents in the laboratory of Epsilon Pharmaceuticals Elixirs of the West The Amrita of India and the legend of Xu Fu searching for the elixir of life by command of the Qin Emperor Myths of obtaining immortality by consuming flesh of mermaids They are all related to perpetual youth and longevity In short Kujo had been researching life prolongation The white pill took in the laboratory and the ones you take are the exact same thing Sorry It is no life elixir but it can help preserve youth and beauty meaning it also has effect on life prolongation Then what about the Necrosis It must be the byproduct of this drug Initially Kujo was commissioned by Ms Hanae and began his research on life prolongation This was long before the young masters parents were assassinated After thorough research the key ingredient to the drug appeared to be enzymes and hormones only extractable from living young women While searching for the best compound a way of enforcing rapid cell regeneration was discovered That is the truth behind the Devils Curse Then those girls in the store house were they all ingredients for the drug Its the fault of this cursed familys tradition used to be your fathers wife Did you know The head of the Genpou family who assumed the office of Watchdog was instructed to choose between my sister and me to become his wife The one he chose was me was very flattered But they turned out to be a family dyed red by blood One day the Genpou estate was attacked Not only did become victim but also my child inside me And would never again be able to have children Not being able to bear children was disposed of like trash Instead your mother became his wife Youre lying Who would have thought that hed choose tradition over me a person For that same tradition you even went out of your way to take up the guise as man Father would never do that Every time think about my sister feel like could explode That is why thought even if cannot bear children its fine as long as can attain immortality And once that tradition addict is gone will make everything mine Now you know at last that everyone is a liar My goal is eternal life Whats most interesting is that this medicine also controls my seizures Ironic dont you think Some trash like you should never have been born in the first place Humans have truly never ceased to entertain me Were you the one who killed my parents Yes because they were in my way Kill her As you command Sebastian His physical potential has been maximized through drugs a true work of art Can a demon match up against a miracle created by the hand of god ve heard that silver bolts work a miracle against Dracula Well how do you like a sword made of silver Please do not lump me in with those graceless creatures Are you sure If shes killed you wont be able to get her soul right wonder if demons can die Foolish the antidote is right What Impossible will return this to you Now the table is turned Akashi Is this what you are looking for Just like my master light fingered No If you want to defeat me now is most opportune Please Theres antidote in my safe obtained these in the pharmaceutical laboratory dont need them In the end youll devour my soul anyway Save me didnt kill your family With this gun you killed my father and mother ve seen it all with my own eyes was just taking orders Your father was the Watchdog You think could do all that on my own This is Lady Hanae Wakatsuki In process of the Necrosis plan was made to cooperate in assassinating the Watchdog They were the large syndicate controlling everything behind the scenes in the East The leader of the syndicate is the one responsible There was nothing could do If did not obey d Tell me whos the leader really dont know know of absolutely nothing What will you do In case theres a chance that my goal cannot be fulfilled ll let this woman live There are but two serves of antidote know but theres no other way Take it Thank you ll live ll live You really are an idiot Everything you said was that all a lie What just said was no lie d like to tell you whos behind your parents murder but really dont know am so sorry You what did you do just performed a small experiment Experiment In case there are but two capsules what would humans greedy as they are do However am afraid they did not contain the antidote but necrosis dyed red with my blood If you had taken only one the symptoms would not have appeared so soon after all have acted befittingly my Lord Let us not dwell any longer and be headed to Lady Hanaes manor What are you doing Your goal has yet to be fulfilled know You could not possibly plan to save everyone in your current state The security code that butler inserted Could it be Hanaes birthday Perhaps fathers birthday You will not be able to take you revenge like this Are you really fine with that Father mother m sorry Sebastian It seems like ve ended up serving a most boring master Seeing as you have chosen death yourself am under no obligation to protect you Fathers death anniversary thats the day everything started Its game over For you to choose death for someone elses sake However it sure saved me some hassle Now am able to take your soul Cant be helped This is the path chose Lying to yourself and acting tough now Dying without having fulfilled your goal what a pathetic master you are You too are lying to yourself right You actually wanted to see for yourself no what a human looks like trying to save someone by throwing away their own life Still having expectations of the human nature that is why you stayed in this world No Driven my personal greed if it be for money or life even murder would not be too far gone That is the human nature know have heard that once demons used to be angels Because they bore unrealistically high expectations they were casted into hell and became demons Ah whatever What did you gave you the antidote Why You were under no obligation to save me Even if took your soul now it would not be interesting If immerse your soul in darkness for a while longer might be able to enjoy a soul darker than black Danger This drug is the Devils Curses true identity The Guard dog of the Queen is alive and well Sincerely yours Nekoma Young master can ask you something What is it That time if had not let you take the antidote what would you have done Somehow had the feeling that even if had only muttered something like aah you would come for me Compared to humans demons are many times more straightforward Underhanded cruel and unseemly We are way more devilish than you demons am no different am rotten to the core This is the human race am human Sebastian That is why order you Only you Only you should never betray me Never As you command Sebastian Stay here Until fall asleep Without fail will stay by your side Until the day your life ends
