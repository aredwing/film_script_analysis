good idea to pay attention to what m saying and to this diagram on the board We discussed the Trinitarian aspect of it When we read in the works of Edwards particularly we saw a painful thing We saw a man trying to reconcile predestination with free will and not succeeding of course We discussed Puritanism you may remember Remember that with its concept of predestination you have what is essentially a pessimistic philosophy It might in fact even be called theological determinism And then later we came to what like to call rationalism Its variously called other things The age itself is

who the man was No But you realize hes not legally responsible for your daughters death Not legally We can do some checking if you like If you think it would accomplish anything Mr Kingship Except to

If theres anything that can do to be of assistance in any official way call on me My names Gordon Grant Youve already been helpful Theres just no explaining why these things have to happen m very

All right then Dinner out if youre so proud Seven oclock ll be ready Goodbye Dear Ellen this is the belt of the suit Dorothy wore last We were sorority sisters On her last day before she went out she borrowed one of my belts It was a cheap belt and we both knew it didnt go with her suit at all Still she wanted it and left this one in its place hope was right in waiting these many months before sending it Sincerely Annabelle Koch What is that Dorothys belt girl from her sorority sent it Very thoughtful of her Or thoughtless However you feel about those things d have put it away and not mentioned it know What was accomplished by it What has to be accomplished by it Some people do things out of sentiment Softness youd probably call it As opposed to my callousness My hardness think Ellen you mistake parading an emotion for feeling one dont think ve paraded mine any more than youve felt yours If youve had one moment of remorse one second when you wondered if you were responsible you concealed it well You have my deepest admiration if not sympathy Thats true havent dwelt on the matter to the point of distorting the facts havent distorted them Not in my own mind at least said once long ago couldnt believe she killed herself havent changed a bit Ellen Yes Dad thought tonight it might do us both good to Well Vincent said something about the ballet m going with Bud Hes picking me up at seven When does he study You might have asked the same thing of me As a matter of fact hes a very good student And like him very much Thats fine Ellen m glad Kingship residence Your Lupton call Your call to Lupton Miss Ellen Thank you Mary Hello Miss Kingship Nice to hear you again You once offered a helping hand Mr Grant m taking you at your word You name it and ll try and do it

please Then remembered something that happened two days before she died mailed her gloves to her Shed had them a long time and was fond of them But the gloves she wore when she died They were ruined They were brandnew Dont you even begin to see guess well just have to face it Youre talking to a pretty stupid man Brandnew gloves borrowed belt blue handkerchief An old blouse Something old something new something borrowed something blue Wheres the marriage license bureau In the municipal building think Dorothy went there to get married and not to kill herself To go a step further Mr Grant dont think she did kill herself And the suicide note Where did it say suicide hope you will forgive me for the unhappiness will cause There is nothing else can do Her marriage would have made my father unhappy But as we know now what else could she do If we can identify her boyfriend think youll find m right ve done some thinking about him too Dorothy wrote me when the semester began said she met someone in English literature believe who was the real thing She didnt mention his name but Ellen Youve really been thinking about this havent you mean youve done a lot of thinking Brooding my father calls it You can call it that too m not sensitive know that when tragedy hits hits hard that the mind is apt to come up with a lot of farfetched ideas Like this In other words you dont believe me Well didnt say that What about your uncle Would he If you think lack imagination you should see him Thanks very much anyway Mr Grant Gordon Hey look Let me tell you a little more about my uncle If your sister was murdered he wants to know about it as much as you do And so do ll admit there wasnt much of an investigation but frankly at that time there wasnt a need for one And all right lets say there is now Lets say we at least check into it Then you will help You got yourself a date for the day after tomorrow morning Thats when ll be back And this student lent my sister a fairly large sum of money The trouble is we cant find any record that she ever repaid him And hes evidently felt awkward about reclaiming it understand What makes us feel awkward we dont know who he is Just that hes tall and slender and was in her English class thought if youd let me look at the records Yes but that was two semesters ago He may not even be here now If can name him can find him ll have you talk with our registrar Harvey Levich fivethree Roy Dublin fiveeight Mr Dublin wears glasses bohemian type Sloppy clothes and such Dwight Powell sixone Very goodlooking darkhaired polished speech major Speech Dorothy said he had a tape recorder They were going to send me a birthday message and never got to it Do you have an address This one is scratched out He must have moved Yes Watkins dorm He moved in

all Our relationship is a simple matter of chemistry Like attracts like Happens with minerals happens with people Basic formula People who like the same things like each other was saying that to somebody just the other day It really is uncanny Same taste in books in music And jokes Dont forget jokes No good if you dont laugh at the same things No good if you dont know what the others thinking thought the chemistry took care of that What m thinking about goes back before that Something about me you dont know dark past How exciting Oh it is m a man with a shameful sinister secret You know what it is ve never really been in love before Bud If this is going to embarrass you or upset you It doesnt If it does we can pick a new formula just want to tell you that Cant you wait m sorry Because can wait think thats what really wanted to tell you ll wait ll wait until you fall in love with me ll even wait until you tell me to stop waiting that its useless that it hasnt any point can tell you that now Bud There isnt any point in either of us waiting any longer dont want to The formulas still working you know m in love too for the very first time in my life With you Oh You think Hell get it Wait till you see the pool Where youll announce the engagement Not in the pool but around it probably Bud Mother dont worry Theyll love you Mother What is it That that blouse Why did you

concerns your sisters friend the late disc jockey Dwight Powell Seems that he was quite a tennis player too helped my uncle wrap up that case made the usual enquiries to fill out the record Theres one interesting fact that just came straggling in It seems that on the day your sister died Dwight Powell was playing tennis in a tournament in Mexico City Hed been there almost a week dont believe it Well youll have to His teammates dug up a news picture There he was and there was the date If he wasnt in Lupton he couldnt have killed her If he didnt kill her why kill himself Thats it So instead of murder and a suicide we have something else Two murders Do you want to go a step further The man who killed Dorothy is still free Thats right Well guess the next time say d better go youd better let me Actually gambled thought saw enough happiness there to override most anything Anyway as far as m concerned the case is just starting ll keep you posted Gordon youre not leaving have to think my minutes just about up Bud want you to meet somebody Miss Ellen hate to bother you Later Bill This is the one Bud Corliss Gordon Grant How do you do How are you Bud Congratulations ve heard about you

office called Your fathers on his way Thank heaven Gives me a chance to get ready Ellen Hes a nice fella Have you known him long met him because of Dorothy He knew her at the university Oh Well that

your time Better yet shall tell them about you Bud that isnt fair Mother eloped No waiting at all Did he tell you he went to the state university Thats a simple question Preposterous Your implication He didnt tell you Why should he fella engaged to one of your daughters not mentioning that he knew the other Knew her Your uncle discovered that No that part came from me But hes checking on it right now You had the gall to come here now on an occasion like this with no proof at all Why To find out whether you knew that Bud knew Dorothy He didnt How do you know Because he would have said so Thank you sir Thats all wanted to hear you say If he did know her and didnt mention it he must have had a reason Unless he told Ellen and just happened to bypass you We can check on that What do you mean Ask her No Why not Its unthinkable the whole thing know that boy For how long Its degrading to ask her such a thing The police dont see it that way m not the police m her father For that very reason please give it more serious consideration Mr Grant up until recently Ellen and have Well shes under the impression that m trying to run her life cant do it wont do it Well if you wont then ll have to do it for you Gordon You didnt have to get back after all m so glad came looking for Dad to tell him everyone was leaving see Youve told him about Powell You should have let me do that Ellen did you know that Bud knew Dorothy Why are you asking me that Did you Did Bud ever tell you Why are you asking started it recognized Bud when you introduced us You could have reminded us we went to the same university You didnt because you didnt know didnt because it wasnt so No Because he didnt tell you If he started this how eager you must have been to join him How you must have searched for just such a lie You ruined Dorothys life and my mothers and now you want to do the same for me Well it wont work Dont ever mention this to me again Not any part of it Not ever m sorry Mr Kingship But ll see you again sir Either to apologize humbly for being wrong or else to prove that was right Goodbye Goodbye and thanks again Its been a pleasure meeting you Thank you Well that was the last It was a wonderful party Ellen real ball The things people do when they see happiness Did you notice that too They left glowing like Christmas trees Will your father glow when he gets the bill Think were worth it thousand times over Hey Hey m gonna have to give you some lessons on economy You want to go to dinner Dont even mention it How about a show m absolutely exhausted all at once If you want an early start to the smelter tomorrow cancel me out early All right off to bed with you then And pleasant dreams Good night darling The Kingship mines Larger you thought or smaller No complaints This is your call sir Its from the restaurant d like you to take it If you dont mind Kingship speaking This is the confirmation on it Corliss was Dorothys boyfriend all right The waitress says they came here often before she died see ll call the Payson police right away Yes Thank you Chief Tell Miss Ellen want to see her at once She and Mr Corliss drove to the smelter Thank you Yes sir Theres no danger of anything happening to her up there Why he doesnt even know we suspect him Ellen does ll have the car brought around ll tell the police where were going Two million dollars on wheels Its hard to believe isnt it for a truck Of course we get a slight discount buying them by the gross Looks like the center of creation Theyll be in China for Easter Sunday Theyve worked this pit for eight years Seven Darling You sound like you knew the Kingship mine before the Kingship girl No its not that Its just that mining has always interested me Ever since can remember Like you said two of a kind Copper music You should have heard Dorothy on the subject of Debussy and me used to drag that girl to every concert try to see most of them too Shall we go up How were the concerts in Lupton Not bad for a town that That was some time ago Theyre probably even better today Look at that ve seen it think we better be getting back now But cant go on like this ve got to know You mean about Lupton Yes Did go to the university Did know your sister Yes did Ellen even had a few dates with her Bud why didnt you tell me All right will When transferred up here and happened to meet you saw right away what you were going through My telling you would that have helped you forget But later Later Later we fell in love and knew mustnt tell you d be chaining you to a reminder of grief every time you looked at me d be putting a curse on both of us suppose still dont understand If it was only innocent you What did you say If it was innocent If it was didnt mean that Is that what your love is like Is that a sample of your faith in me Your trust Oh Bud Who put you up to this Grant He probably saw me with her once What an operator He drives all the way up here to tell you that It was to tell me about Powell The fella who killed your sister Except that he didnt He didnt kill himself He was killed by the same man who killed Dorothy How do they know Theyre bluffing He left a note It said it all there They didnt find anybody How do they even know your sister was killed Theyre guessing Ellen Powell was about to give me the murderers address The murderer knew that He overheard us He just happened to be there He didnt just happen to be there Bud Hed followed me He followed every move made Ellen thats even crazier How could he Known was in Lupton sent him a message telling him so Remember You think you know m telling you youre wrong All these things are coincidence Me knowing her the university So did a hundred other guys You are tall and slender That was in her letter What letter You were right beside me all along It means nothing Dory knew it doesnt Dory There werent a dozen called her Dory There was only one Why did you have to do this Ellen To me To yourself Most of these things youve
