effective had been the longestablished espionage machines of Germany and Japan from the White House came orders that the United States too must have eyes and ears within enemy countries Immediately the nation commenced for the first time in its history to recruit a Secret Intelligence Corps As the man best capable of organizing the secret activities of the new United States Intelligence Corps

escaped with a brilliant record of achievement behind enemy lines To Washington in the weeks and months that followed Pearl Harbor had come carefully selected groups of candidates for training and assignment to secret operations overseas At the Union Station one morning in among thejostling thousands came the th group of candidates each unknown to the other The Washington headquarters of Secret Intelligence was under tight security its address and telephone unlisted in any governmental directory Few even knew of its existence The story of Operation is typical of the activities of any of the groups which preceded it Each candidates qualifications and background had been checked and rechecked before he was called to Washington Every member of had volunteered without reservation for hazardous duty behind enemy lines Among those assigned to were men like Pappy Simpson a British intelligence officer in the First World War and until early a professor of English literature at

zeroed in to one specific target Simpson London No not yet Southampton The enemy knows theres going to be an invasion He doesnt know where or when He does know that the invasion base is in Southampton and hes building up a tremendous supply of these rockets When he launches his attack its going to be a sustained barrage on this area When do you think itll start When Eisenhower makes his move The
