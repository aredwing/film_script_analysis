voices and saw some natives making a fire on the beach Shes already half cooked by the sun so it wont take long one of them said And then the Chiefs son who was handsome said She is beautiful d rather not eat her And then another said We have to kill her She will feed us for a week Then Takuna said to her My tribe is hungry Help us and will spare you Then she reached into her pocket and pulled out

an iceberg and got stuck So they got out to push it And all the other kids jumped back on the boat But a little boy was standing on the iceberg and it was floating away from the boat And then he couldnt even see the boat anymore because there was a blizzard and giant snowmen all around him at him with white eyes Shit Goddamn it Mom Whats wrong m sick Youre sick to your stomach m just sick

Because said so Bossy brought Ted cant sleep Me neither Me neither guess no one can sleep tonight Tell us a story You tell me a story You start Once upon a time in a country far away there were four children who ran away from home Without their parents They didnt have any parents They sailed far out to sea past the last known country into uncharted waters where no adult had ever been Until they reached their destination Child Land This would make a good novel One d like to read Everywhere there were pizza shops and bakeries and bowling alleys and swimming pools You seem to be enjoying yourself Whats wrong with that Then she started noticing there were lots of year olds but no year olds Finally a kid told her They get too old for Child Land so we put them to sleep Otherwise they would become grown ups and take over the country You cannot just do whatever you please Watch me Well guess were in this together arent we So she went underground and joined the resistance movement that was trying to save the lives of teenagers in captivity But the other kids wanted to find her She sent them a message in code Every number stood for a different letter The message said Maggie want you to come downstairs ll be back soon Go to sleep Maggie Dont do this Maggie your mother is trying to destroy this family Please Martin Leave her out of it want her to see how much shes hurting you You want to be a family dont you You want a mother Martin its too late for all of this Its not too late We are still a family Tell her Maggie Tell her Tell him You tell him Its your baby m gonna be father Dad No You son of a bitch Please stop Stop it We have to finish the story They had to escape all of them And get to the boat She sent them a message in code The message said she would come and visit them in the middle of the night But she couldnt stay But as she slipped off into the night she dropped scraps of cloth Bits and pieces she tore from her clothes and left a trail for the kids to follow It led them to the edge of a deep hole so deep they couldnt see the bottom They fell and fell and just when they thought they would never stop falling they landed at the entrance to a secret tunnel And they could hear the sound of the ocean So they ran though the tunnel and got to the boat and pushed off from the dock And sailed away And they lived happily ever after When this old world starts getting me down And people are just too much For me to face climb way up to the top of the stairs And all my cares just drift Right into space On the roof its peaceful as can be And there the world below Cant bother me When come home feeling tired and beat go up where the air Is fresh and sweet get away from the hustling crowd And all that ratrace noise Down in the street On the roof the only place know Where you just have to wish To make it so At night the stars put on a show for free And darlin you can share it All with me Right smack dab in the middle of town found a paradise Thats trouble proof And if this world starts getting you down Theres room enough for two Up on the roof Up on the roof Everything is all right Up on the roof Everything is all right
