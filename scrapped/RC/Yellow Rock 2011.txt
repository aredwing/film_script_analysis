Since the time of my elders when the white man first came upon us we have struggled to survive and live our peaceful ways But their shadow cast its curse upon our people and darkened all our days They took our small ones and sold them as slaves They took our scalps and sold them for profit Our heads were severed for more Our hearts were full of sorrow We prayed to the Great Spirit in the sky Do not abandon us Our only reply the sound thundering hooves upon the chest of our Mother Earth The sound that was once the Great Buffalo is now of only those who come to take our lands Welcome to Yellow Rock Gentlemen Whisky for all of us Leave the bottle Thank you sir You remember me Yeah remember you m looking for Tom Hanner You know where he is Hes probably drunk somewhere He dont come around here
