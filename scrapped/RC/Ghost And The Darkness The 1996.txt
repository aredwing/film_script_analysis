Welcome to Africa sir Angus Starling m to assist you at Tsavo Beaumont will have told you that No actually But he did give me his monster speech Robert seems dreadfu but once you truly get to know him hes much worse And m one of his defenders Forget him for now Follow me sir Your first trip to Africa Good because ve reserved the best seats on the train Theyre amazing arent they The most amazing thing about them They sleep only five minutes a day Dont like them much Their females are bigger They have to be or they wouldnt survive The males eat the young Anything specia about them They fart through their mouths bet they dont kiss very much ve lived in Africa for a year and dont know what you know How long have you been here Just about hours But ve been longing for this all my life Welcome to Tsavo Samue Samue is camp liason Absolutely indispensable Hes the only one everyone trusts Does he speak English And very poor French Samue Colone John Patterson The bridge builder Weve been getting ready for you Good d like to see the site ve got some medica supplies to deliver Come to the hospita afterwards ll bring him Where are you from Samue That way beyond those mountains m from over there Everything seems to be under contro Thank you If it is its a miracle Why is that The workers dont like each other The Africans hate the Indians But the Indians also hate other Indians The Hindus believe cows are sacred while the Muslims eat the cows Do you eat a cow Of course ve worked with both Hindu and Muslim Perhaps can help You can try It wont work Nothing works here Tsavo is the worst place in the world Advance camp is across there How many workers Your bridge is not yet built each day they move two miles further away Did it look like this in your mind No This is more difficult It should be difficult What betterjob in all the world than to build a bridge To bring land over water To bring worlds together Finish your tour Is this mostly malaria Yes but their suffering is only transitory once they accept God into their hearts Thats just vomitus talk Mr Starling Poor bastards will get even sicker if you dont shut up David Hawthorn m This is my hospita And my advice to you is dont get sick That was meant to be charming Seemed to have lost the knack You never had it Angus and dont like each other m also liason between these two You dont share Beaumonts vision This is a sham Who needs it Its ridiculous Its only being built to protect the ivory trade Make rich men richer Then why stay doctor Who else would hire me Beat you to it didnt Dr Hawthorne Oh yes almost forgot You may have brought bad luck with you This is Karim one of my orderlies He was attacked by a maneater earlier today Youre such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it His injuries are only slight He was riding his donkey nearby when suddenly a lion sprung on them Donkey took the brunt of it Then the lion ran off Thank you Karim know this is your first day and you must be tired But what are you gonna do about it With any luck ll sort it out this evening Could come and watch Have you ever hunted Well not exactly ve never been very adventurous Can you keep quiet hate to be a bother John Shh The cramp is getting worse The pain is actually quite unbearable now You just have to cope with it Angus That is precisely my plan But back at my tent Youll be dead before you ever get to your tent The lion will eat you know Is this the best way to hunt a lion dont know ve never even seen one One shot One shot Patterson has made the night safe again My God you sorted it out Theres nothing like the fear a maneater brings They own the night and kill so quickly It was clear to the men that Patterson was willing to take risks for them That one shot had taken their fears away Angus ve decided to have you and Mahina oversee the foundation piers Of course the hardest part about building a bridge is the foundation piers For that task m giving you four thrilling weeks Arent we full of ourselves today think its because of the lion Ah John You know also have killed a lion How many shots did you need used my hands Four weeks is just not enough time You just have to use your hands Come in One shot The claws of the lion you killed Thank you It will remind me of Africa It is meant to remind you of courage It will also protect you Wear it You know how God invented liquor so the Irish wouldnt rule the world He invented being bullheaded so we could be the best at something For when this bridge is finished itll have nothing to do with my skills and all to do with my stubbornness Africa changes everything plan Yet we are somehow ahead of schedule Mahina my foreman deserves so much credit The man is a marvel Another marvel Starling has actually convinced some natives to convert cannot wait to show this beautiful country to you Love John What the lion must have done was lick his skin off so he could drink his blood Then he feasted on him starting with his feet Lions dont eat this way Are you sure this was a lion We followed his tracks What sort of lion could carry off someone Mahinas size Terror had now built a hole inside us and would not leave Because if Mahina who was so powerful could not save himself what could the rest of us do They will go when tell them Sitting accomplishes nothing You want us to work even if we have to die to do it Why is there no work being done Malaria epidemic Very sudden There is no reason for fear On that choose to remain dubious Two are dead now in two nights The second Far end of the camp man wandering alone at night Theres even less of him than there was of Mahina Its too soon for a lion to kill from hunger In our village we construct thorn bush fences around where we live Big burning fires at night That keeps the lion away Good Get started And a strict curfew No one is allowed out of their tent at night Abdullah send half your men with Samue to build these fences Take the other half to the bridge ll sort this out will kill the lion and build the bridge Of course you will Youre white You can do anything It would be a mistake not to work together on this thing Abdullah Go back to work No Its got to be tighter See This has got to be a wall What a good week You mean nobody died We all worked together Worthy deeds were accomplished like the labour My mother insisted on piano lessons Broke the dear womans heart when it turned out was tone deaf She was always on at me to be carefu with my hands like the blood Is that so strange No Oh yes think so Here it comes Samue Even you two must admit its glorious what man can accomplish With one common splendid goa there are no limits Think what will be done when we all have Gods warmth in our hearts am immune to your disdain When came had one small goa to convert the entire continent of Africa Now ve decided to move on to something really difficult will not rest unti both of you are safely in the fold m beyond conversion My mothers a Roman Catholic and my fathers a Protestant have four wives Good luck The struggle is the glory For you Thank you Samue Good news expect so Its from my wife You like her Very much dont like any of mine Hassan Darling The big excitement yesterday was when some school children spotted a whale They saw me An attempt at humour but dont feel funny these days Anyway after our son youll note still have total confidence After hes born travel might be the order of the day As he kicks me at night m quite sure hes telling me He definitely wants to come to Africa Thought you might need reminding Move yourselves Angus Stay here Jesus Theres two of them told you to be careful And the king said to Danie Danie servant of the living God is thy God whom thou servest able to deliver thee from the lions And Danie said unto the king Oh King live forever My God hath sent his ange and hath shut the lions mouths that they have not hurt me forasmuch innocence was found in me and as before thee oh King have done no hurt Have done no hurt The men called them the Ghost and the Darkness There were two of them and that had never happened before because maneaters are always alone They owned the night but they also attacked in daylight Alone or together Without fear or reason Some thought they were not lions at all but the spirits of dead medicine men come back to spread madness Or they were the devil sent to stop the white man from owning the world believed this that they were evil What better ground for evil to walk than Tsavo Because this is what the word Tsavo means a place of slaughter You didnt say help is on the way Its too late now They will listen to you Make them stay They are afraid They want to go home Be content that have decided to stay Beaumont is on that train If he sees this you lose yourjob So will you sir Thats all you really care about Oh Christ Then you go too You lack the courage to lead Go tell all your men to go But will kill the lions and will build the bridge And you you must go home and tell the wives of the men who died working here that you fled with the others because you couldnt master your fear Welcome to Tsavo Pleasant journey How could it be hate Africa Lovely sound They seem happy Dont they though So works going well What of the soldiers Youre on your own No soldiers here promised my men protection Wheres Starling He ordered some Bibles Is he here Where is he Wheres Starling Here he comes What happened ll show you Nothing wrong with these people Theyre afraid What the hell is going on The Ghost and the Darkness came In English Its what the natives are calling the lions Theres a legend here Two maneaters are making all the trouble thought you were a hunter Its not that simple These lions are not like lions How many have they killed About should think Christ Youve been here three months and already youre behind schedule Dont you know the French and the Germans are right behind you And dont care about you and dont care about the dead care about my knighthood As to your request for troops Do we wish the world to think that the builders of the British Empire are afraid to do theirjob because of minor difficulties with the loca wildIife dont think so So what are you planning to do m calling it my contraption placed it here because this is the area where the lions have attacked the most m surrounding it with a boma fence Except for this small area here opposite this door Just what kind of lunacy are we dealing with here On the other side of these bars will be bait Human bait About here will be a trip wire to this sliding door Genius The beast will enter tripping the wire the door will slide down behind him trapping him You meanwhile safe behind your bars will have the beast at your mercy and will shoot him at your leisure Are you running a high fever man How could you conceive of something so idiotic didnt conceive it for the lions It was for a tiger in India And did it work In point of fact it didnt But m convinced the theory is sound made a mistake hiring you need initiative not contraptions need a professiona hunter assume youve heard of Remington Every hunter has heard of him wish he were here right now By the time you find him the lions will be dead and ll be back on schedule The jobs still yours but only because itd take too long to find a replacement If have to return you are finished will then do everything within my power to destroy your reputation Fair enough told you youd hate me Helena Everythings collapsing on me Every morning the ground is soaked with blood The workers feel brought this terror since it didnt begin until my arrival Whatever try they seem to know All the deaths are on me Very impressive Weve been hunting since childhood Youre murderers Criminals Thats good Youll spend your nights in there And you have nothing to fear That is correct Nothing Of course he kept moving Did you want him to sit down and pose This worked He came in and hit the wire He was about feet away from the three of you You couldnt even wound it shouldve given you rocks Not a trace of blood anywhere This is insane We came close many times There must be blood Next time well be better The devi has come to Tsavo Ridiculous talk You dont really believe it Youre telling me my beliefs wasnt and you know it Dont force it We do have a problem in Tsavo Yes Finally we agree Youre right We do We do You are the problem in Tsavo Hes the problem in Tsavo Be carefu You dont tell me carefu You dont tell me anything We are sick and tired of your lies You listen while talk Change in plans Get them back Get them all back Get them back Go back Quickly go back Go back Go back Go back You listen while talk because you got a question that needs answering Will pull this trigger You dont know what has happened He will pull the trigger The devi has come to Tsavo Youre right The devi has come to Tsavo Look at me am the devi m a man of peace You are a man who wants to live Most certainly Absolutely Yes Thats an excellent decision Your name is Abdullah Yes m sure were gonna meet again think its been a pleasure You have returned My friend How have you been am well Warriors will need ten cows John Patterson Aye Remington uses the Masai to hunt lions Itll cost you ten head of cattle He takes some getting used to Why didnt you tell me you knew him You did not ask

Theres something you should know Let me save you some time Youre in charge of building the bridge Am right so far Thats right dont want to be in charge of it Thats fine m sure you hate Tsavo like do

here makes for an inviting target could tell you just saw fresh paw prints out there which makes me think theyre already thinking about feasting in here But dont wanna answer you When you question me youre saying that dont know what m doing Anybody here think m a foo then please speak up right now Colone Patterson Well then guess we all agree ll need you with me tomorrow Whatever you wish Samue says you killed a lion Probably just luck Nobody kills a lion with one shot by luck You might be usefu tomorrow Even if youre not understand that this may take me days to sort out You have to build that bridge so the men cant lose their respect for you Thats very considerate of you m a very considerate man My mother taught me that What are you laughing about You dont agree dont believe you had a mother Now were ready You really believe you can make something happen But youre not excited You dont enjoy killing do you Then why do it Because ve got a gift m gonna join them now Were gonna try and convince each other that were still brave wouldnt have thought bravery would be a problem for you You hope each time it wont be But you never really know Strange man Two great tribes of his country fought a terrible civi war for many years And his side lost Everything Land and family The very young ones and the very old ones lost He buried his family and left his country forever Now he hunts all over the world but he always returns here He says Africa is the last good place John Will you exchange weapons with me Mines much more powerfu wont be with you tomorrow ll be finishing the new hospita Thank you Why does he need you with him He doesnt Weve hunted many times He knows m afraid of lions ve spotted one of them in the thicket Samue come with me Chances are m gonna kill that lion in the thicket Colone take the higher position there Youll have a clear shot at him Shoot him Shoot him Shoot him Goddamnit Shoot him Shoot him What happened dont know What do you mean you dont know It misfired For the first time The gun belongs to Dr Hawthorne You exchanged weapons You went into battle with an unproven rifle Theyve got an expression in prize fighting Everybodys got a plan unti theyve been hit Well my friend Youve just been hit The getting up Thats up to you They say theyre leaving now because it does no good to be here They are not lions They are the Ghost and the Darkness The Masai did not see a lion They saw the devil They knew there was not enough blood in all the world to make these demons stop drinking Remington laughed at us He said that they were only lions Gentlemen there is no smell of sickness and very little blood We have removed all the lions temptations When we leave this evening lock this gate securely unti the morning Keep those fires burning high Are there any questions Arent there any questions You two sleep beautifully in your tent and stay there And where will you two sleep beautifully We will spend the night waiting in the old hospita Wont we Colone And can assure you with the fresh scent of blood those lions are gonna find it irresistible Just think about something else Have you ever failed Only in life meant to ask you that trap you set in the boxcar Was that your idea Aye Excellent notion used the same device myself once But of course yours worked No in point of fact it didnt But it was still a good idea Johnny Get the lock We must not leave Thats my hospita for Gods sake We must not leave Let me go Samue Hurry up One of us needs to be brave It wouldve been a beautifu bridge Its funny how didnt notice it before guess had
