Commission Bribes to call a spade a spade Does that shock you No guessed as much You werent supposed to know about it That file was not supposed to circulate However am asking you to understand Take a look at that model Julie Thats the dream acres of riverfront reclaimed from decay thousands of jobs created building block a very large building block laid for the future Not such a bad dream as dreams go And if the price of realizing that dream is the occasional distasteful chore well dont run away say so be it So want to book me The fact remains that m in possession of evidence of the commission of a crime Let me suggest this you excuse yourself for few minutes go to the ladies room leaving your briefcase here What happens to that memorandum while its in my custody is my responsibility wish it were that simple but dont have the memo with me m trying to protect you Does the name Robert Durant mean anything to you Drugs racketeering and real estate Robert Durant is a

medical history He was found on the riverbank just south of the city There are homeless and indigents there We get three nonames every week Nobody does anything until they become train wrecks like Mr John Doe here Hes got burns covering of his body The hands and face are the most severe Ten years ago pain from the burns would have been intolerable He would have spent his life screaming Now we use the Rangeveritz Technique Quite simply we sever the nerves within the spinothalamic tract there which as you know transmits neural impulses of pain and vibratory sense to the brain No longer receiving impulses of pain you stick him with a pin Ouch And he cant even feel it As in many radical procedures there are serious side effects to this operation When the body ceases to feel when so much sensory input is lost the mind grows hungry Starved of its regular diet of input it takes the only remaining stimulation it has the emotions and amplifies them giving rise to alienation and loneliness Uncontrolled rage is not uncommon Now surges of adrenaline flow unchecked through the body and brain giving him augmented strength Hence the restraints Naturally we give them every chance of recovery Remain optimistic inspire confidence talk to him about rehabilitation potential Personally give him a on the buzzard scale Code blue burn unit Doctor m in charge here Damn it let me through Ju lie
