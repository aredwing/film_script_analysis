radiation through every astronomical database Altair Rigel Vega Hes been to all these planets And now theyre lifeless Barren Some even shattered Everywhere the Surfer goes eight days later the planet dies How are we gonna stop him We dont even know where he is What about the craters They appear in a numerical sequence The last crater was formed in Greenland so the next in the sequence should be latitude degrees Iongitude zero degrees seven minutes west When he surfaces move the fight away from the crowd Hes too fast to contain When see silver m hitting him You cant do that We stick to the plan and work as a team Oh were a team now News to me What are you talking about You know what We were gonna tell you When When you moved our stuff out Johnny this isnt a good time Kids got a point

All of you But the worlds at stake and we need to work together to survive General we know firsthand you trust Victor and youre gonna regret it So far the only one ve regretted trusting here is you Richards Reed dont agree to this Lets see what hes got made a detailed recording of our little encounter All that you know is at an end Well like the part where he knocks you on your ass Look at where the energy levels surge when he attacks me There See what happened The energy was channeled through him but it originated from his board If we can separate him from the board we can cut off his power completely Thats what we have to do How If knew that wouldnt need you people would l You two should get started right away m glad we have the opportunity to collaborate again ll try to talk slowly so you can keep up How can we be working on the same side as Victor You got me Things were simpler when could just whale on the guy Whats he doing fire Look at that ll pay for that ll tell you Ben m starting to feel like a complete screwup Hey hey youre not a complete screwup Thank you Look kid its out of our hands Its up to the eggheads now You think Reeds right about the whole endoftheworld thing Hes never been wrong about this kind of thing before You know m not exactly a deep kind of guy Really But if Reeds right and this is it how do you want to spend your last few minutes Part of me would like to go out fighting But the truth is d like to spend my last couple of minutes holding Alicia That sounds pretty good mean not the holding Alicia thing Shes your girlfriend not mine Want nothing to do with her Not to say shes not attractive Shes very attractive Shes so attractive Even with the cant think of a guy that wouldnt want to What meant was that its nice to have somebody Well

operational Three hours Three hours can only go so fast since m working by myself What do you need to make this happen There are a couple of things Do your field engineers have a beryllium casing What are you doing Dont you knock Youre supposed to be helping Reed Tell him not to worry ll be there to hold his hand and finish his little project for him Anything else Howd you do it How did you come back It scares you doesnt it The things can do Did you know could create a force field inside someones body and expand it until they explode Give it your best shot Just get back to the lab Mr Storm Were heading to intercept the Surfer in minutes with or without you Were you waiting outside the bathroom to try and catch me in a towel That was a joke was joking Why are you so down on me You dont
