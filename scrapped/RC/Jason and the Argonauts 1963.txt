Well Zeus king of the gods of the Greeks write in the ashes so that may read the future see a great tree at the end of the world And in its branches there hang the skull and the skin of a ram They gleam and shine for it is a prize of the gods a Golden Fleece Weve no time for riddles and mysteries Tell me of tonight Pelias you will conquer tonight You will overthrow the kingdom of Thessaly You will kill the king Aristo and wear his crown You will do all these things without fear or wound because Zeus commands it If m protected by Zeus will have no need of this will lay it on the fire as a thank offering to the gods Pelias it is also foretold that although you will win the throne of Aristo you will when Zeus ordains lose it to one of Aristos children Then Aristo will have no children He has three Pelias Two daughters Philomela and Briseis and a son Jason Then two daughters and a son will die with their father tonight Hera queen of gods protect this child my sister Philomela And if Briseis am worthy take me into your protection Are you Briseis the daughter of Aristo Be silent She is praying For her sister and for her murdered father Aristo Are you a priestess serve the gods Then tell me has Briseis called upon the goddess Hera She has And has the goddess heard her prayer Yes Then pray for me It is the will of Zeus It is not the will of Zeus It is your will Zeus has given you a kingdom The rest will be your own doing The gods abandon you Pelias onesandaled man shall come and no god shall protect you from him onesandaled man The child who has escaped you Jason Then why was not told the whole prophecy Why did Zeus drive me to kill this girl when the only one needed to kill was Jason Zeus cannot drive men to do what you have done Men drive themselves to do such things that the gods may know them and that men may understand themselves The killing of Jason would do you no good Kill Jason and you kill yourself Zeus my godly husband did you for some reason order the profanation of my temple in Thessaly That was entirely the thought of Pelias Not content with winning the throne of Thessaly as wished he tried to avoid losing it as have commanded know that youve been insulted my dear But be content The boy Jason has escaped He will avenge you How You must know by now never arrange exact and precise details And because you are neither exact nor precise a young girl was killed and my temple was profaned want to help Jason No You may help the infant Philomela if you wish Shes a girl The rest is mans work No want to help Jason As you wish How many times did Aristos daughter Briseis call upon you By name Five Well then you can help her brother five times Five times only you can help him to overthrow Pelias And that is my final word It will be years before Jason becomes a man Oh an instant of time here on Mount Olympus but a long years for King Pelias He cautiously travels the roads of Thessaly Yes Pelias you have had years of watching and waiting for the man who must come to kill you The man with one sandal owe you my life That was as good a way to ford a river as any But seem to have lost a sandal in doing it Where are you traveling To the palace of the king Pelias Pelias of Thessaly Then can put you on your way But first you must accept the hospitality of my camp Come Be seated You have not yet told me your name am Jason the lawful king of Thessaly One of my fathers soldiers rescued me and brought me up in exile Now ve returned to claim my kingdom have waited for you for years And in that years Pelias has turned my kingdom from the pride of Greece to a savage evil land shall need your help When your father defended his throne no man fought harder than This time it will not be enough to fight could fight could find Pelias and kill him But the people need more than a leader They must believe the gods have not deserted them They need a miracle And where will you find this miracle have heard there is a tree at the end of the world with a fleece of gold hanging in its branches have heard this too So have many men They say it is a gift of the gods It has the power to heal bring peace and rid the land of plague and famine If could find this prize and bring it home to Thessaly then it would inspire the people wipe out the years of misrule They would know the gods have not abandoned them My land would be rich and strong again as it was before this tyrant Pelias murdered my father Jason be advised by me First search for this Golden Fleece Do not reveal yourself to Pelias but build a ship and find a crew and when you have this prize then and only then return and kill Pelias And now rest yourself My companions are yours to command Father why do you let him live If destroy him Acastus destroy myself While he is searching for the Golden Fleece he is at the ends of the earth and am safe And if he finds it You will be there Have you come to pray to the gods Jason If had wouldnt have chosen a fallen one Only a statue Sometimes the gods argue amongst themselves Then great winds blow and temples fall Hermes Yes No said the statue was the god Hermes Hermes Yes bringer of dreams and a prowler of the night Jason No man can tell you how to find the fleece Is it not time you asked the gods They will not answer those who believe in them Why should they answer one who doesnt Come with me Why So that you will believe and be answered You win my lord That is the battle not the war Oh those waters are far too shallow for galleys Hera my dear you really must learn to win without cheating Or at least to lose gracefully Greetings Hermes Greetings my lord Zeus There seems to be a piece missing Perhaps can help Welcome to Olympus Jason Jason come to Mount Olympus at last No man calls upon the gods unless he wants something We arranged for you to be brought here by Hermes wouldnt have believed a mortal could ask the help of the gods much less visit them Well at least youre honest Which is more than can say for most other mortals What is it you want ship crew No Those can find myself And what are you going to use in place of gold The hearts of men am Hera queen of the gods and your protector on this voyage But my lord Zeus has decreed a limit to the number of times may help you when you call upon me Do not speak now know what you must ask of me Does the Golden Fleece exist And if so where is it Thats two questions And shall help him with only one answer Search in the land of Colchis Then it does exist But Colchis Thats the end of the world No Greek has ever sailed there Now that youve heard that are you so sure that you will not need my help Think carefully offered him a ship ship and a crew And he refused me Refused the help of the gods What ship is strong enough to reach to the edge of the world What crew brave enough to sail in her shall tell the shipbuilders of Greece that the richest cargo in the world waits in Colchis The Golden Fleece is worth a kingdom shall say that only the strongest ship ever built will survive the voyage The athletes of Greece are proud ll tell them only the best can expect a place in the most perilous voyage in history shall announce a games invite the strongest and bravest of the Greeks No greater games shall ever be held unless the gods decree otherwise did well to choose you Jason The gods are best served by those who want their help least Welcome Polydeuces Castor of Sparta Acastus of Thessaly Well done Acastus Phalerus of Athens champion archer of Greece Euphemus of Taenarum Spyros of Syracuse Hercules Hes here mean to sail with you Jason Tell me which champion you want me to beat No one know you can beat us all Your place is reserved Hercules Yes Hercules Yes My name is Hylas Like you came too late to compete in the games But it occurs to me that if can beat you at something Jason couldnt refuse me a place on the ship either After all he might need brains as well as brawn Shall we compete Discus Come on See that rock Yes No thrower has ever reached it And is the contest to hit it or pass it Youll be lucky if you get halfway Now go on No after you Hercules ve never thrown a discus before d like to see how its done Let Hylas have his moment of triumph while he may You shall have your place Hylas Hail Hylas have found the finest crew in all Greece Now for a ship that is worthy of them Argos Argos Hello Is that you Argos Whos there Its Jason Come aboard So youve come back again Shes a fine ship Yes She is a fine ship Shes ready to sail Weve yet to give her a name ll call her the Argo after her builder The Argo Well youd better have a look at the figurehead It might make you change your mind No this way Is it forward No its astern Well have to move it Its supposed to watch over the water ahead of the vessel cant help that Something made me put it here Hera queen of the gods What Nothing You dont object to it here No Nor do It makes me feel someone friendly is watching over us When do we sail Tomorrow Dont waste it There isnt enough left to make any difference Jason Oh let him rest But the sooner we find some island with water the better We cant row much longer on three sips a day Take my advice Put back to Icos But wed lose five days sailing We havent water enough for tomorrow let alone the time it would take to reach Icos Dont worry Hylas dont expect him to take my advice But wish hed listen to someone Still grumbling Sailors always grumble These sailors have something to grumble about Hardly any water Blistered hands They should use brine Brine It toughens the skin Well go down and treat them ll steer Hera You said you could help me a certain number of times So far youve told me of Colchis And threw Pelias from his horse and dragged him beneath the water Pelias So that was King Pelias know your need Set sail and steer north You will reach land at noon Where The Isle of Bronze ve never heard of it No mortal has It was the foundry of the gods Hephaestus labored there making armor and weapons for Zeus Oh do not fear Hephaestus himself has long departed will see that you reach the Isle of Bronze But listen to me Jason Listen very carefully Take the helm Yes sir Set sail We reach land at noon Then you can fill your bellies until they grumble as much as your tongues Now mark this It will be safe to take food and water But nothing else Absolutely nothing else That doesnt include women If there are any on the island yes it does If meet a girl with a firm leg a full bosom and a warm heart let no man try and stop me Talos will Whos Talos You do mean theres a man there who wants a fight spoke of no man Food and water Hercules Thats all Jason who told you of this island The goddess Hera Port helm Steady as you go Furl the sail Ashore for food and water Are goats good sailors Goats What are you talking about What do you want with goats onboard ship Well some of us might be hungry or thirsty Come on Heres one for the pot Hercules Isnt he one of the Titans He might be Hes big enough Didnt Jason say something about Talos This must be where Hephaestus molded the statues of the gods Yes And set them up for all the world to see Hercules Its a treasure chamber The treasure chamber of the gods Look at this And this pearl Its a javelin Dont be silly In a jewel box Its a brooch pin Well whatever it is itll make a useful weapon Lets get back to the ship Hercules Well what is it Youd better put it back Why Remember what Jason said It wont be missed Anyway if the gods leave all this lying about unguarded they obviously dont want it Come on It must have been the wind And you saw nothing of them after that Perhaps Hercules found a woman after all Talos Back water Back Back water Back warned you Jason This is Hercules doing Talos will try to kill all of you How can fight him Think before you waste the gift of the gods Against a man of bronze our weapons are useless repeat that question Then must answer it Fight Talos with your wits rather than your courage And look to his ankles His ankles There is nothing else can tell you Jason You disobeyed my order Lure him to these rocks but stay out of reach And what will you do shall hide here Acastus shall do my very best to send him to you Jason My very best Mind his foot Quick get back to the rocks Hylas Hercules youve left your Well We searched Argos And will search again Hylas was with us We saw him running But then he disappeared He couldve been hurt not able to get back to the ship Like Palinuros We had to carry him aboard Hercules Hylas is dead The gods decided it Why kill a boy for my grave fault But should have stayed with him Search until nightfall We wont sail till then Sail when you please Jason cannot leave this island till ve found Hylas Jason Will you abandon Hercules the best man among us for one wont sail without him Nor shall Nor Come with me Hylas Is there any man here who does not obey the gods We will do as the goddess Hera commands if she will speak to us This is your last chance Jason The last time that can help you understand Then know this Argonauts Hylas is dead Hylas is dead As for Hercules he is not fated to go further with the Argo Zeus has other tasks for him And for us Hera Sail to Phrygia Seek out Phineas the blinded man Only he can guide you now We set sail Come on back to your places Back to your places Get forward there Go away Devils Demons Lord Zeus was a sinner ve never tried to deny it But didnt sin every day Why then do you punish me every day What in the name of the gods are they Jason Are you Phineas Yes Take my arm cant see yours Dont flinch Zeus gave me the gift of prophecy but misused it so was blinded Zeus ordered the Harpies to torment me You Jason now listen to me The gods have ordered me to tell you whatever you want to know But the gods have gone too far with me They can punish a man so much and then one day he abandons them He says All right Zeus Throw a thunderbolt Let the earth swallow me defy you You growl away all you like Zeus mean what say Jason ll tell you what you want to know only if youll meet my price What is your price then Free me from these tormenting Harpies If Zeus sent those creatures to plague him wed be unwise to interfere Thats my price Then well meet it Phineas Well make you the master of the Harpies Get to the ropes Now Castor Phalerus Find some wood to build a cage Here you are you hungry fellow big fish for you and some more wine Well Phineas weve completed our part of the bargain What is it you want to know The way to Colchis The way to Colchis is through the Clashing Rocks Steer northwest and youll reach them in five days Northwest eh After the Clashing Rocks you turn northeast Before long youll sight the shores of Colchis But tell me what gods protect you None now Then you wont pass the Clashing Rocks What are the Clashing Rocks They speak for themselves dont they All can offer you is this Its not much reward for what youve done but its all have If thats all you can tell us then goodbye The gods be merciful to you Phineas from now on theyll witness a banquet every night and eat the scraps you leave Good appetite Theres not much water here Steady as you go Row easy Easy all Easy all Its a narrow channel but cant see what made Phineas so frightened It looks calm enough Too calm Acastus know the sea gods moods But most of them are dangerous Acastus take a sounding The rest of you be prepared to row when give the word But an easy stroke Save your strength They may need it later Ship ahoy There she is She doesnt seem to be in any great difficulty whole ships crew And Lynceus from the masthead There was no hope of saving him not in that sea Are we going through Yes But its All right were going through Back to your places Theres no turning back now No Acastus Theres no turning back on this voyage Drummer beat out the stroke but keep it easy The gods want their entertainment Jason goes too far Because he speaks the truth when the gods themselves go too far Turn back Jason Were trapped Trapped Hera It seems so Youve left me only one move Pray to the gods Jason The gods of Greece are cruel In time all men shall learn to do without them Pull Pull Get back to your place Pull Pull till your hides crack and your backs break Pull Keep the stroke going Jason dared to speak of the end of the gods and yet you let him live If were to punish every blasphemy d soon lose all loyalty and respect You are the god of many men Yet when those men no longer believe in you then youll return to nothing You understand that and yet you remain with me You think it weak of me my lord Not weak Almost human Whichever god or goddess helped us is to be thanked Those others werent so fortunate Whats that Who are you Your ship was lost We found only two other survivors Theyre being looked after Here Drink this When did you sail from Colchis Dawn this morning Dawn Then our journey is nearly over Where have you come from Thessaly But thats the other side of the world You dont look like a merchant Your vessels a fighting ship Wed be foolish to sail unarmed By all accounts your king Aeetes fears the gods and we were sent by the gods But m gonna talk to him alone peacefully Now you answer a question What was your ship doing in such dangerous waters We came to sacrifice to the gods of the rocks to throw flowers onto the sea to make it safe for our ships m afraid our gods were angry not so powerful as yours Are you a priestess serve in the temple of Hecate dancer Is Hecate the god of the Colchians The goddess But d heard they worship some strange idol the skull and skin of a ram No ordinary ram Its fleece is of gold gift of the gods themselves and its brought our city great peace and prosperity Well put you ashore at dawn tomorrow Perhaps you will show me the way to the city Now tell me your name Medea And you can answer my first question Who are you My name is Jason Within a few hours we shall sight Colchis m coming in quietly by night Now the voyage is over dont want the trouble to begin Wont be any trouble Jason Just tell us where the city is and when we attack We dont attack But thats foolish You have the finest fighting men in the world Forty fighting men against a nation Better than one Jason Were not pirates Phalerus Whats that girl done to you We thought you were a fighting man m going up alone in the morning to see what the situation is Oh you mean spy out the land Well why alone Why not take a few of us scouting The fewer who go the less can get caught Whats the fewest you can think of One of course Right accept your advice But dont Having sailed this far together were free to speak our minds And whats on yours Acastus We nose our way upstream rush the guards and seize the fleece Wed be out into the open sea while Aeetes is still asleep night attack Yes And in the dark during the attack a man will die That man will be me javelin in my back Greek javelin Acastus Maybe your javelin Youll die for that Jason Keep back Euphemus Its Euphemus Hes dead Look at this Slashed and bloody Acastus must be at the bottom of the sea wonder Make sail And Euphemus The sea was his kingdom while he was alive Let it take his body now hes dead Make sail Make sail Youre wounded We have a flower in Colchis which heals and soothes Tomorrow ll show you What do you call the flower It has no name It grows on a double stalk They say it sprang from the blood of Prometheus And it has been used over the years for its soothing and curing powers The suns getting higher We must be on our way Follow the road to the east Youre not coming further go another way The goddess Hecate has spoken There will be one among us today from the ends of the world His name is Jason Any man of whom he asks his way shall say this Aeetes king of Colchis awaits him in the temple of Hecate And that is all any man shall say to him Come forward Jason You have done all of us a great service Tonight we shall feast you We know of your great heroism and it deserves celebration Return then to your companions and bring them to my palace thank you my lord but do not understand Medea Welcome to Colchis give you Jason and the Argonauts Jason and the Argonauts Tell me Jason why did you come to Colchis In peace said why not how Altogether how many men have you Enough And you say you do not threaten us Envoys who come to me in deceit remain in death know youve come for the fleece know too that if you cannot win it by bargaining you plan to steal it But well never part with it Jason It is a gift of the gods It has brought wealth and peace to Colchis Should we ever let it go it would mean plague and famine and the destruction of our country We can no longer welcome or entertain you but treat you as you deserve As thieves as pirates as murderers We give our thanks to one person The person who exposed a criminal attempt on our kingdom The son of King Pelias of Thessaly Acastus Hail Hecate queen of darkness youve always helped me Tell me now what must do You who gave me the gift of foresight why didnt you reveal to me Acastus treachery He who sits drinking with Aeetes while Jason imprisoned condemned to death If help him now in the quest for the fleece shall be a traitor to my country and to you Hecate And if not to myself Help me Hecate Medea Why did you come here Was it Aeetes who sent you came to ask you to give up your quest and sail away with the Argonauts in peace Never return Never to think of the Golden Fleece Never to think of the fleece Then it was Aeetes You tell him will fulfill the task the gods have sent me and never betray the Argonauts whatever he offers me Even if its Medea high priestess of Hecate Please forget the Golden Fleece fear for your safety If youre set on carrying it away must come with you ll go alone No have to go with you have no country now And love you Castor Phalerus Dmitrius get to the door The rest of you back to your places The priestess Argos listen to Medea When youre clear of the palace go to the ship and row downstream Theres a break in the cliff and a path through the woods Anchor there Well join you Well what is it Jason has escaped And his men They were all gone was making my rounds found the guards drugged Drugged Then theres an accomplice Wheres Acastus Hes not in his quarters Acastus help Jason But theres no reason to it Unless it was Medea who mixed the drug The high priestess of Hecate saw how Medea looked at Jason If Medeas helping them then shes guiding them to the Golden Fleece and the Argonauts will take ship The landward way is shorter Muster your men captain Listen Soldiers Phalerus Castor you come with me No not you Polydeuces But Argos You stay aboard with the rest of the men and guard the ship Jason Aeetes and the Colchians We heard them from the ship They must be somewhere near Get the fleece Guards follow them up there and that way Wait Hecate queen of darkness revenge yourself against the Thessalians Deliver to me the children of the Hydras teeth the children of the night The teeth Fetch me the Hydras teeth quickly Against the children of the Hydras teeth there is no protection The fleece Give me the fleece It has the power to heal Its true It does have the power to heal Jason Hold the guards back captain or they may die killed with Jason and his pirates Rise up you dead slain of the Hydra Rise from your graves and avenge us Those who steal the Golden Fleece must die Argos get down to the ship Take Medea Come with me There And there And still another Wait And more Destroy them Kill Kill kill kill them all Get back think that proves at last that m a worthy opponent my lord Where are you going To clear the board The game is over It certainly is not For the moment let them enjoy a calm sea a fresh breeze and each other The girl is pretty and was always sentimental But for Jason there are other adventures have not yet finished with Jason Let us continue the game another day
