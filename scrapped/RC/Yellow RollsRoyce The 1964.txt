it is Is that meant to frighten me Oh no Mrs Millett think that would be impossible am sorry but the Yugoslav frontier is quite near and your dogs yapping can be heard clearly by certain gentlemen who if they recognize me will probably shoot me What are you doing now This is the only way can cross the frontier into my country by traveling in the trunk of your car Why Are you a criminal No merely a prescribed person What are you prescri Duchess shut up ll be happy to tell you after weve crossed the frontier How can stop them from searching the trunk By using all the magic of your charm Flattery will get you nowhere Not even past the Yugoslav frontier Certainly not The likeliest outcome is that well both go to jail The fabulous Mrs Millett in a Yugoslav jail America will probably declare war

Roosevelt Young man do you realize just what youre asking Regretfully its a matter of life and death Halt Passport Passport There Walkies walkies Oh what a charming view Passport madam Pass Michele

attack my country Thats why had to come back to fight for her dont believe a word of it But its true happen to love my country Yes perhaps that is the description of me that would give you the most
