twist The guy moves in and brings his etchings with him Whats his connection with boats He designs them or at least he did before the war Now hes working as a compass adjuster what Well its just a temporary job until we can save enough money to buy a car and a shack on the cape We expect to live up there most of the year can get my magazine assignments here and do my work up there After a few

deserve it Goodbye Daisy Bye Dont you want the cab Mr Mara If you hadnt planned to keep it hadnt although its definitely going to rain Your father designed the Sartatia understand Yes There was something was never able to figure about the Sartatia Oh used to sail her years ago And what amazed me was that she didnt roll to swells like other roundbottom boats Didnt do what She didnt roll even in light airs Thats the bluenose in her The old Gloucester hull Ever see her out of the water No All her sections carry displacement high This would be half a cross section here with the waterline like that Giving her a slick underbody with maximum stability What dont understand is who figured out that a few planks in the hull of a ship twisted a certain way would make her behave in a planned way Hundreds of years of observing seamen logic Its things like this that make people like me mad Why Anything logical makes me want to fight for some reason ve always distrusted logic Luckily never ran against it in law courts very often or anywhere else Thats what makes life unexpectedly pleasant the illogical Like this moment for instance Good luck Mr Lapham wont send the cab back this time

question is what kind The best that money can buy guess Lucilles quite bitter at the moment Perhaps you can understand that She wants to divorce you in New York and name Mrs Lapham And what do you think might be able to persuade her to do it the easier way if youd cooperate about the children And what is her idea of cooperation about the children Sole and absolute custody Of course eventually youd be able to see them when theyre a little more grownup But Lucille thinks there should be a clean break now till theyre adjusted to it Perhaps you can understand that Till shes sold them on the idea that ve run out on them Well come now Papa Lets talk sense Lucille knows d never go for anything like that Then we file the suit Theres no other choice Dan You can think about it for a couple of days and let me know Well thanks ll phone you Oh ll be in the office But wont m pulling out of the firm sugarplum Perhaps you can understand that But Dan theres no reason why a purely personal conflict Sure there is Your sensitive nature Youd wear a smile know but deep down youd be wincing every time we met Your humors in rather bad taste Besides it would give you something to occupy your time Without me around youll have to work for your income This Mr Maras office Yes Youre Mr Lapham Yes Hes expecting you Go right in please Hello Welcome to chaos Mr Lapham Throw me my hat sweetheart

people believe we are Dont you know it have a hunch that when people keep on talking about how grownup they are it only means theyre not very sure of it Mr Mara Well if youll let me talk maybe you wont worry so much about that Lets simplify one thing at least Hes called Peter and youre Dan It all started on Wednesday d had a bad day lost a case that Well theres no point in going into that But went over to th Street and behaved like a heel Your wife resisted ll be frank to say if she hadnt resisted we wouldnt all be sitting here now Any questions about that No nothing important Why isnt it important Because it doesnt matter what happened Youre not getting hostile are you That wasnt on the agenda Honeybunch m not hostile Honest Go on want another martini You havent touched the first one yet Well thats that If it were something that only concerned the three of us we wouldnt need to say another word about it But m asking your permission to let me turn our private affairs into newspaper copy Lucille is suing me for divorce She wants to do it in New York naming Daisy as corespondent They figure in order to keep Daisys name out of the newspaper ll sign away the right to see my children Oh no Dan You mustnt It would be terrible for them Marie especially m putting it up to you Its not a thing to be decided without realizing what it involves This is exactly the kind of copy Sunday supplement editors are looking for Well if they want a fight well give it to them We have Mary as a witness m sure we can lick it ll clear you baby May speak now Mr Chairman suppose so said it doesnt bother me uh whats happened recently between you and Daisy and it doesnt matter whether you clear Daisy or dont clear her That nice point which is going to make so much difference to the reading public wont mean a thing to me m not being hostile You see walked into this marriage with my eyes open knew what was up against It was a long shot but thought it was worth the chance Well wasnt it cant complain pushed my way into your life Daisy because needed you Well m fine now Better than either of you Thats all there is to it That isnt all there is to it The only reason was able to break in was that he didnt love you enough then If had met you now for the first time would be able to break in ll do my own thinking thank you and my own existing m all for that Thats why m leaving it up to you So that you can work this thing out for yourself without being bothered by the technical drawback of a husband Thats a formality we can dispose of any time you give the signal dont want a wife on formalities Peter how can you say a thing didnt plan this baby You ought to know that m almost glad it happened Theres nothing like a crisis to show whats really inside people You dont mean that Dont you tell me what mean Lets go dont like it here It was close to wasnt it When you returned to the apartment and discovered Mr Mara there Yes And you had been gone since a little after Yes but its hardly important since his plane didnt get in till You testified on direct examination that you were surprised to see Mr Mara did you not You heard me So did But found your surprise shall say surprising You were certainly aware that the ties between Mrs Lapham and Mr Mara were more than those of a casual acquaintanceship Objection Your Honor Question is ambiguous and calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness Objection sustained Let me put it this way You had seen Mr Mara in Mrs Laphams apartment on several previous occasions had you not Before she was married Oh yes that was before she was married Then your surprise came from your assumption that her marriage had ended their previous relationship knew it had stand corrected But since we must deal here with evidence rather than opinions could you tell exactly what concrete facts made you so positive of the change Well just knew it Thats all Thank you Miss Angelus You are a devoted friend Are you through with the witness Yes Your Honor Uh no further questions Your Honor Then well recess till Hold it please Miss Kenyon Rosamund Dont blame me Dan Its Marie Whats the matter with your ear Honey whats the matter with your ear Its the cold The minute we walked out of the house it started bleeding If youre not home in half an hour therell be no fur jacket for Christmas And have Dr Riemer look at that ear had him look at it this morning He says its nothing Did she have a blow of some kind No Its purely a nervous thing Nothing to worry about All right Lucille Thanks Will you see that they get home or shall think thats up to me dont you Come on girls The lunchroom is a flight down Shall we walk You know youre right That lawyers building a case for the papers and nothing else Why Dan Mara m sorry know You like to build not destroy things just remembered something about that ear When Lucille first heard about you she took it out on the child She always has ever since suppose she didnt mean to hit her so hard Oh Daisy forgive me for this Sure baby forgive you You know its a common psychological phenomenon in all the northern countries that the first snow of the year causes acute depressions That must be it Yes that must be it Do you deny that before your marriage to Mr Lapham you were in constant communication with Mr Mara No And the testimony of the real estate broker that Mr Mara rented an apartment in the east s If he did never lived in it The place lived in was my own had a good job still have it Do you want me to prove that too That wont be necessary But tell me this Mrs Lapham In the period of your uh constant communication with Mr Mara you can tell the court how often you had engagements with other men Your Honor must point out again that my direct examination of Mrs Lapham was concerned solely with the events of the evening of last September It is my purpose to prove that the events of the past form a very substantial background for what happened that evening Be that as it may you are not entitled to establish it in this crossexamination You testified earlier that your marriage was a happy one Was that true on September Yes And on September did not see my husband on September Isnt it true that you and your husband have not lived together since the night of Mr Maras return from California Objection submit this whole line of questioning is irrelevant May add something to that Your Honor dont know if you have the legal right to ask such questions But whether you have or not protest them protest you as a human being That will do Mrs Lapham The objection is overruled Thank you Your Honor would like to ask the witness to tell us in her own words just what is the present status of her marriage and what brought it about Well itit is true that my husband and are not living together at the present time But it wasnt caused by what happened that night At least he said it wasnt Peter did my husband He said it wasnt important Your Honor may say a word If it is agreeable with plaintiffs counsel This is his crossexamination Certainly Your Honor request a recess in this trial for the purpose of a private conference with the plaintiff The state is always willing to grant such a request in a divorce case My chambers are at your disposal Thank you Your Honor Why did you do that couldve gone on Maybe you could but couldnt Theres no need for you to wait around here Go home ll come by later But why did you throw in the sponge learned what really matters to me while you were up there What really matters ll give you a hint It has to do with how much love you Jack have Marsha find Peter Lapham wherever he is Trace him down from the cape but find him trust we all realize theres no sense in carrying on with that sideshow out there Dan Please Lucille Before theres any talk of a reconciliation d like Skip it Papa Theres not going to be any reconciliation Then well proceed For what You havent got a prayer on that kind of evidence think Lets not waste time with what you think Ask someone who understands a little law You can go on raising the roof ll admit that But whats the point ll agree to your original terms in exchange for a quiet divorce in Nevada Youll have the girls all to yourself Lucy Give em a break They dont want me They will if you work at it ll be ready to take em if the job gets too much for you Oh Dan its no good Its no good without the two of us Neither of us alone is enough for them Oh Dan ve hurt you ve hurt the girls and Daisy but but nobody as much as myself m sorry honey This didnt start out as my idea You carry on with the details will you Quinn Hello Mr Lapham Mr Lapham Is the boss back from court yet Yes he got back half hour ago m so glad we found you so quickly Hes waiting for you Yes Mr Lapham is here Show him in Well hello Peter m glad found you in town How long have you been here Some time m working on plans for a diesel fishing fleet called you to see if you still meant something you said at our last meeting Oh sit down wont you Have a cigar or anything No thanks No cigar No anything What did say That you would be willing to bow out of your marriage anytime Daisy gave the signal Yes think thats a pretty accurate quote Am being signaled want to marry her ve taken the liberty of drawing up the necessary papers Naturally Daisy doesnt want anything from you and assume you dont want anything from her Where do sign You know m completely baffled by you Well dont pretend to be able to explain myself in detail but what is it that bothers you was pretty sure at one time that you were in love with Daisy Who said wasnt Well here you are giving her up without a murmur The least you could do is punch me in the nose d be happy to if thought it would accomplish anything Suppose you give me all the arguments in favor of it then Forget it might be too convincing Right here Three copies Did she prefer that sign first Who Daisy Well no Not exactly m afraid didnt make myself quite clear The fact is havent asked her yet Oh Well dont you think that we ought to go through all the formalities in their proper order Sure if you think so Why dont we call Daisy and go see her Fine Why dont we Trying to sneak out before pay the rent ve got to get out of here That phones been ringing ever since came in ve got to get back to work Thats all that matters now cant figure you Youve been in love with Dan for so long and now that hes stopped the trial to save cant figure myself Thats why m going away dont know what want Its about time found out once and for all Yes Yes Dan Peters with you Oh no No m not up to that kind of civilized nonsense Please Dan dont bring him here and dont come yourself ve just got to be alone for a few days My works piled up on Want to tell me where youre going so ll have something to lie about To the cape Hello Oh ll see if shes here Its Lucille Mara sounding times worse than you Hang up on her or shell be calling you all night Sure baby ll help you with that Thank you Thank you Can help you with the bags maam No thank you Nothing else can do No No thank you Hello Baby were here at Mills Landing Were on our way to face this thing out Its no use running away Dont you ever believe what say ve got to be alone Hello pet Where have you been Its not very smart driving around these roads on a night like this m not very smart Call it off Better though would have blitzed you didnt hear the car come in had kind of a crackup What happened baby You hurt No m all right Carll have to be towed in though Its about two miles down the road We can worry about that later Is there a doctor anywhere near Please believe me m all right Matter of fact feel a lot better than have in weeks Maybe thats a good way to get clear on things Shock treatment Well if youre sure youre all right lets elect a chairman and get on with the meeting The cab is due any minute to take one of us back to the station Seems to me youve made a lot of plans all on your own you two Well there isnt going to be any meeting know what want Youre both going back to New York And leave you here alone with nothing settled Baby youve got to stop running away have stopped running away Well who has the floor Who do you think Not necessarily honeybunch In fact yield Well it doesnt make very much difference who says it Dans asked me to give you a divorce didnt tell him to do that No its his own idea But he apparently had reason to believe youd go for it Then why did you come here Peter To have you ask me for it yourself see Thats our cab ll be outside Daisy we need a fresh start Lets go to Nassau Lets go someplace where we can relax Weve been through a lot baby but weve never given ourselves a fair chance It took me a long time to realize it but know now what want d give up everything for you baby As a matter of fact practically have The girls It was the only way to end the thing You shouldnt have could have gone on told you Yes but couldnt stand watching what they were doing to you Nothing was so important that could let them tear you to pieces like that And in the end it was worth it to find out what really wanted Lucille would have called off the whole business and gone back to where you were But it was too late Can it ever be too late for Rosamund and Marie Dont you understand Its all over that marriage It cant be over as long as the children are a part of it Marriage doesnt break up that easily Its too late Its even later for us Dan You said it took you a long time to realize where you stood Me too But out there just now when the car went off the road things somehow got much clearer Its a funny thing about being in love Sometimes its easier to tell when you are than when you arent stopped being in love with you a long time ago Dan but the well the memory kind of lingered on and kept me mixed up Well whatever you call it love or anything else it wont be over till were dead Weve got to kill it for good m sorry if let the memory mix me up It mixed me up too guess was pretty sure The things you put up with for my sake It never would have worked Really darling Because what you called wanting me wasnt anything more than wanting to run away from responsibility the way youre doing now Goodbye Dan Goodbye Daisy Go ahead Hey what are you doing Same as you honeybunch Going home That is my house in there you know And my wife Peter Yeah that Mara put up a great fight What do you know about fighting When it comes to modern combat tactics youre both babies compared to me
