The Ancient Ones said that Jauja was a mythological land of abundance and happiness Many expeditions tried to find the place to verify this With time the legend grew disproportionately People were undoubtedly exaggerating as they usually do The only thing that is known for certain is that all who tried to find this earthly paradise got lost on the way Father why cant have a dog of my own You will Inge But not until we return home What kind of dog would you like One that follows me everywhere see One like that That certainly wont be easy m sure well find a way My sweet girl Would you like a drink Aquavit When are we leaving for the desert fort In two weeks Its high time we left Yes ll be in charge of the convoy There are several wagons ll prepare a special carriage for Ingeborg So she can travel comfortably Or are you leaving her here No shell come with me Is it true everything theyre saying about Zuluaga Hes an extremely competent officer And brave But isnt he a bit crazy People around here talk too much Do you know him Have you spoken to him Many times Weve covered many miles together and fought side by side Hes very brave and levelheaded Hes dependable and lawabiding And now were going to his fort right Is he there now heard news that he was in the big fort nearby But as soon as the invasion took place he rushed to be with his men He must be there by now Hes a very experienced soldier In the desert he can make himself invisible and travel at the speed of sound And hes a very disciplined military man You will like him Does he live alone Alone Does he have a wife Children Or is he like you On the desert frontier one is alone Relationships and comforts are debilitating As you well know its a strange way of life to build up a place a country a family But one must embrace an idea and push ahead with it Thats what sets us apart from the coconutheads They wander from place to place stealing and killing like complete animals Why do you call them coconutheads Thats not a tribe a coconut We consider all of them coconutheads But its not a proper name The name doesnt matter But if we dont know their name how can we understand them We dont need to understand them we have to exterminate them We have to kill them all see Lieutenant Pittaluga have a little problem between my men and your soldiers Theres a lot of hostility Could you talk to my surveyors tomorrow Of course Thank you Of course You remember tomorrow theres the ball being given by the Minister of War It is quite an event Yeah d like to invite your daughter My daughter Birrita could come along as chaperone No but she Shes not a Shes my daughter Captain Dinesen It would be an honour for me to give you a horse as a gift for your daughter In these parts the man who rides is king could teach her to ride No she already knows how to ride All the better d like to invite you to the ranch where breed them Thank you have some gorgeous horses ll give it some thought have a chestnut horse real beauty Thank you But first we have work to do right Ingeborg Inge You know Lieutenant Pittaluga dont you You know who mean Yes the man with the short assistant Exactly Wherever he goes his assistant follows Or else the assistant leads the way And he follows Yes that sounds right In any case The other day just as was returning to the house with Dora the little man was at the fort waiting for us What did you say And the Lieutenant was sitting inside He said he was waiting for you Really Is that what he said He was in full dress uniform No ll be damned It wasnt me he was waiting for It was you he came to He came to see you Now you listen to me He is much too fond of young girls Hes a filthy pig wont have you anywhere near him Is that clear Why would go near him Well Yes of course youre right Why would you Forgive me But Oh my poor girl We dont belong here at all Well go home to Denmark soon love the desert like how it fills me beg your pardon Captain Your horse is ready Captain Yes yes Just a moment Ingeborg Wait a moment Damn it Birrita Corto come here Take your boots off Miss Ingeborg please return to the camp This shall keep Good day How are you ngel Thank you Corto Would you like some cold mate We drink cold mate here Father Not now Ingeborg Look what found Yes thats fine But now you can go go back to the tent Go on Move along Tell us what you told the administrator want to hear it from you Speak up Youve much to tell us About the colonel Exactly Zuluaga is leading a band of thieves The strange thing is hes dressed like a woman already told this to the other officer Did you see him No heard it from some locals who were with the coconutheads Listen to me Corto Colonel Zuluaga disappeared in the desert while trying to reach his fort to help his soldiers He was later seen in two relay stations where he changed horses and had a meal He was in perfect shape That is all we know No news since then He never arrived and no one saw him again Nor has a body been found We infiltrated the coconutheads but we learned nothing from them right Either theyve hidden him or Zuluaga just vanished into thin air The second search party returned yesterday all experienced men emptyhanded One of Zuluagas horses was spotted up near the forest The horse was in good condition grazing calmly with saddle intact carrying the colonels saddlebags as if its master were nearby But they never found him find it strange that such an experienced man could get lost in the desert Perhaps we overestimated him The desert devours everything Thats when people began spreading rumours Youre telling us that they told you they saw him leading a band of men dressed like a woman And whats even stranger the dog his dog Jersey His dog Jersey disappeared from his pen the same day as his master And therefore m now asking you why would Zuluaga desert Why would he dress up like a woman What kind of shitforbrains are you people Search for him Go into the desert and bring back something from Zuluaga Something tangible something material Use your contacts Something material Yes Something material Do you understand Material Something like Something like the dress hes wearing Birrita Any news on the supplies Yes theyre on their way Pittaluga Its always the same story Were constantly asked to do the impossible dont understand a word youre saying Theyve been on their way for six months Dont be vulgar Come now gentlemen Well that was fun Are we going to eat now bit later It seems that youve heard the rumours too The rumours yes But they are only rumours Rumours spread quickly in the desert dont they ve heard a lot of farfetched things about Zuluaga since got here Do you know what think He was an unpredictable officer Dont you agree No Come on Lieutenant Calm

Blonde Very young She was She is No years old No What did my mother look like Your mother mean what did the girls mother look like Why ve always wanted to know She was quite tall And beautiful Unbearably beautiful Rather highly strung She was like a carnivorous plant that grows at night focusing all of its energy on the insect it wants to devour Perhaps shes happy She left us just after you were born Its rather unusual for a mother to abandon her child And now the girl is gone Yes shes gone now too So it seems Where did she run away from From nowhere You see she doesnt have a home Neither do We travel from place to place Doesnt she have any family she could go to No am her only family All families disappear eventually even if it takes a long time Theyre wiped off the face of the earth The desert swallows them up think its for the best m looking for my daughter If youd like to come back sometime for a longer visit ll always be here One man is not all men now remember a boy saw one evening after sunset It was an ordinary day like all other ordinary dull days The dog was leading him Because dogs like to make friends The little girl in me dreams of dogs and wild animals and wild men She dreams of blood running over the cliffs into the sea But the little girl became a woman and lives in the desert And she doesnt put up with any nonsense What is it that makes a life function and move forward dont know What is it that makes a life function and move forward Good morning dear Wilbjrk Have you seen Henrik No havent He said he was going to the hockey game The dog is doing a lot better now put ointment on him and gave him some antibiotics So thats a good thing Its the first time hes had something like that d heard about this but none of my dogs had ever had it Its a hot spot hot spot Its a nervous reaction in the animal Like smoking When he doesnt understand something he scratches himself furiously It irritates him and he can injure himself What is it he doesnt understand He doesnt understand why you go away for so long m here now though m home again These creatures know a lot more than people realise They make plans m going for a walk
