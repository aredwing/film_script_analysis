of days Dr Karras has been keeping an eye on you Youre his latest project Do you wanna watch some Anything in particular No Oh dude you lucked out This is my favourite movie of all time We belong dead Hello Abe m Dr Karras m just gonna have a little look Are you ve been better Remember why youre here You were legally dead but lucky for you modern medicine knows no limits died Technically speaking You had an dont know what that is Neardeath experience Its my field of expertise fought to make sure you were my patient Let me guess You saw a white light that engulfed you almost seemed to beckon you to stay Yeah thats exact How did you know that As many as eight out of ten people whove had an report seeing a white light Freaky huh What about the light m seeing now Its probably an aura a type of residue So its normal d say were well beyond the bounds of normal here but yes Youll see em less frequently as time passes and eventually theyll disappear Shes with us Shes with us Shes with us So everything looks fine No masses no deviations in your intracranial space But ve seen it three times in the past few days Seen what The white light And theres something else Youre gonna think m crazy but um m seeing and hearing all kinds of electrical stuff stands for electronic voice phenomena Precognition the light youre seeing all that is part of supernatural white noise ve got a grant to study these things So what exactly is it Its the recording of the deceased using a detuned apparatus like a or radio Some people believe that is the afterlife manifest all around us Others think its a charge or electromagnetic fields still others that its a means through which the dead can communicate with us Frankly who knows As long as were not exactly sure what it is theyll keep funding my grant What are you doing down here This is my room These have been detuned and record em to see if ve captured any transmissions suppose thats an important part of your work then That Oh No didnt want to detune that one Thats Change of Habit m recording it for research purposes thought might learn something from Dr Presley Youre not a fan of this one No its just just saw one of those things on the screen Transmissions are only visible after theyve been recorded On the last closeup of Elvis saw a blast of static with what looked like an unformed person So what are you doing now ve rewound the feed ll detune it Lets see if you really saw something There There thats it Thats it That was it Thats what saw ll be damned So what does that mean Maybe when you had your you yourself became a detuned receiver You see whitenoise transmissions communications with the dead all that without any of this Youre in uncharted territory Theres a very good chance youre going to be seeing some wacky stuff ve got to go ve got a doctors appointment Sure Take all the time you need Hey m still saving all the clippings and articles about the shooting and stuff dont want to hear about the day my wife and son were brutally murdered just cant handle that right now refuse Hi Dr Karras asked Whats wrong Dr Karras is dead What He had a heart attack early this morning m sorry so this It draws your attention to the white light When you see the light you think it means What do you think it means That somebodys gonna die Like with Dr Karras it could be a couple of days With the woman it could be hours just depending on how strong the light is dont know but m seeing it more and its driving me nuts Its like being God m worried about you Abe Well how would you explain it then How about l dont
