make deadly weapon Why dont you get your butt off the couch and go fix something The water and the power are broke all over town And fixed the car It broke again while was fixing it We need a new one No what we need is someone to fix the car who knows what theyre doing Thats a direct insult to my masculinity know how to fix stuff just learned how to make a deadly weapon out of a stick If that idiot already has a inch bowie knife why does he need a pointy stick Okay fire You were too low You didnt allow for droppage Droppage Droppage Gravity whatever Yeah think gravitys the one that caught on Anyway shouldnt we be out on patrol Nope Fitzy says were using too much fuel think its to save the ozone Or is it polar bears He guys Fitzy how can we do our job if we cant patrol the town Watch

is retiring Whos retiring Yeah When you signed your last contract you ticked the box for a year term with the town having the option to renew it at the time Which is now Which is no So youre gonna just kick him to the curb after like a zillion years of hard work Not a zillion And dont want to retire d love to keep you on but times are really tough Anyways ve got to be somewhere Man cannot wait for this thing to be over Not me love town meetings Full of opportunities People debate Decisions get made New rules get made sharp guy can see the angles and make a few bucks Yeah sharp guy Why dont you pay your tab Okay Lets just all pipe down all right Dont draw attention No questions no comments Everybody just zip up and lay low so this thing can wrap up What are you from the s My formative years yes Is it hot in here m always too hot Except when m too cold Sometimes m both Plus pukey Must be tough on your husband Window open window closed Pukey not pukey Hes stationed on the coast of the Mediterranean m pregnant in Dog River so its tough on one of us My seventh grandchild Good for you Isnt he adorable They grow up so fast Some more than others Dont worry Youll be a grandparent one

Fitzy didnt call the meeting did You did Oh Well good Its about time somebody called one of these things called this meeting today because think speak for everyone when say there are some major concerns with how this town is just falling apart Thats for sure Absolutely The power the water Garbage is just piling up You know and Dog River could be really quaint mean maybe even one of the quaintest towns in Canada if we really pulled it together What do you think Oh Anyway have this idea Laceys right Wheres Fitzy Yeah Wheres Fitzy There he is Hey Fitzy Let me get this straight You invested the towns money in real estate in Detroit It was really cheap didnt think it could get any cheaper It can by the way How much did we lose Somewhere in the neighborhood of all of it What Everything That explains the water and the power then ve been using the contingency fund to keep the power on But thats all gone And the water pump is on its last legs So how much debt are we talking about Ballpark hell of a lot It shouldnt be that much for a stupid ballpark Oh sit down and play with your stick This is insane We didnt even have the money to begin with Whoa whoa Wait wait Whoa whoa whoa So what happens now Well we really only have two choices here One we unincorporate the town and Dog River basically disappears Or three dusty boots in a row and were back in business got a couple of dusty boots for ya Aah And you wonder why dont like town meetings This isnt good Thats what you get for ordering clam chowder in the prairies Not the soup The situation If we have to leave itll be far away from our only son and his future wife and our beautiful grandchildren What grandchildren Were not going anywhere Were staying here and living off the land like our ancestors Your grandfather died in a gokart accident Oh Brent talk some sense into your father dont think theres enough words We might have to move and sell the house while theres still value in it He wants to stay do nothing Not do nothing Fish with a spear Well for what its worth Aargh Whats the matter Its just a shock to the system whenever agree with Dad Okay listen everyone just got off the phone with Brian Rainville Hes a plumber in the city He gave me a quote to fix the water pump Now it isnt cheap but if we all pitched in then few hundred dollars each to have clean running water is too much to ask Listen people this town is gonna be nonexistent if we dont do something No think well probably be okay The key is not to panic and overreact Ah screw hiring someone We have to learn to fend for ourselves m pretty handy with a wrench Unless he tries to use it as a wrench Are you questioning my abilities No Dad when it comes to your abilities none of us has any question Sure laugh it up You wont be so smart when the Four Norsemen of the Apocalypse come riding down Main Street Oh come on We all have to pull together people Anybody like to volunteer to mow public spaces Unbelievable these people Davis dont know if anyone explained to you what retired means but you get to not be here anymore just came by to pick up a few of my things Besides m not really retired with no pension Now ve got to find another job Like what dont know thought maybe we could uh put our feet up and kick back and you can help me think this through Sorry ve got a family to support now If Dog River shuts down m gonna have to get a cop job somewhere else And no one is gonna hire me if my ticket quotas are so low So no more games naps or matinee movie days There it is But brought ice cream cant stand around here eating ice cream Ugh What are they feeding you Man people are losing their marbles after that town meeting Well people fear what they dont understand You must be perpetually terrified We entrepreneurs always say that When a door opens its time to close a window of opportunity got a ton of ideas on how to capitalize on this and with my brains and your money we cant miss Yeah but you dont have my money Or much of the other stuff Wheels are turning Like we could set up a pipeline you know like for oil but for water from a place with water and so then we would have the water and wed be the ones charging for that water And thats just one idea Thats not an idea Thats just you saying the word water times Now got to pee So youre telling me youre not gonna invest in my ideas You come up with an actual idea m all over it Hey heres an idea Why dont you fix the leak in your truck Then you wont have to keep buying this oil Oh uh ll get you Hey hope you dont mind me taking these boxes m taking them anyways Just

hotel bar has been part of Dog River since long before was born Doesnt seem right to just let it die now so bought it But you usually usually sit these things out know Mainly because ve spent my entire life watching you people turn molehills into mountains and was hoping that this was just another one of those things But its not And sometimes in this life you have to pull yourself up off your can and do what needs to be done Especially once you realize whats really important Well Brent think were all deeply touched by how important booze is to you No The The bar is a metaphor Youre missing the Look bought the bar because love this stupid town And love the life we have here and for one think its worth fighting for Attaboy Brent Yeah Yeah And thats why also entered us into the Quaintest
