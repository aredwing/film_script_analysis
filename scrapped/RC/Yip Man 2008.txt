So ll give you one chance to be loyal to the Japanese Emperor Teach our army Chinese kungfu That way we might still spare your life He wanted you to teach the Japanese kungfu wont teach the Japanese You wanna see me fight ll fight with you He said he would think about it He wants to have a duel with General Miura Take him away Take him away Quan take my wife and kid away from Fo Shan Master Ip General you really wanna fight with Ip Of course Hes an expert But he doesnt look like he wants to teach the Imperial Army He must have other motives trying to fight with you General dont fight with him Let me simply shoot him dead He challenges me to a fight because he thinks hes better than me If refuse to accept the challenge but shoot him instead isnt that the same as admitting defeat Fighting with a Chinese is not just a matter of personal honor for you It has to do with the national honor of our Empire Are you saying will lose only fear for the worst will win for sure ll let the whole China know ve won Yes understand want you to teach us instead of killing you because appreciate your talent But dont think Chinese kungfu is better than Japanese We will fight in front of everybody Thats why we need a fain tournament You invaded our country and killed our people Stop being hypocritical Excuse me Let go of me Let me go back Let go of my mom promised Ip nothing would happen to you Its too dangerous to go back heard the Japanese are fighting the Chinese Whos fighting Ip Man Look the whole place is sealed up now In the past wished he could be with me every day So always complained about his practice Every time he had a duel with someone would throw a tantrum never truly supported him doing what he liked Now This could be his last duel fear there wont be another chance Why dont you give me this chance Why General Miura says For the sake of SinoJapanese cultural exchange he is having a fain tournament with Master Ip today to share their knowledge in a friendly manner and to bring true peace between the two countries Fain tournament Is it possible That traitor will surely be killed by the Japanese Thats right Shut up Here comes Master Ip General Miura talked about a tournament But dont give a damn Listen up If you win will kill you Remember this Yes You better let Miura win later Or he wont let you live Its more important to stay alive Although martial arts involves armed forces Chinese martial arts is Confucian in spirit The virtue of martial arts is benevolence You Japanese will never understand the principle of treating other people as you would yourselves Because you abuse military power You turned it into violence to oppress others You dont deserve to learn Chinese martial arts Ip Man Ip Man Ip Man refused to be subjugated by the Japanese army and used his fists to call forth the unity of the Chinese people Assisted by his good friend Zhou Qingquan the wounded Ip Man successfully fled Fo Shan with his wife and son On August Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced that Japan would surrender unconditionally The Chinese finally won and ended a war that lasted eight long years In the Grandmaster Ip Man settled in Hong Kong He started his first Wing Chun class at Kowloon Hotels Staff Association Headquarters turning a new leaf in his life In Grandmaster Ip Man started the Wing Chun Athletic Association to foster the spirit of Wing Chun with a group of likeminded enthusiasts fulfilling the most cherished dream of his later years Until now Wing Chun has become a world renowned branch of Chinese martial arts The lineage of Grandmaster Ip Mans disciples has exceeded million people There are lots of talented people among his disciples including the most illustrious action star of all Bruce Lee
