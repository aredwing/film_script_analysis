morning Where can we get some oysters At the Frstenmhle Then were going to the Frstenmhle They have nice rooms there too Excuse me Hello Hello l need someone to accompany me to a meeting Someone who knows about balance sheets They have new injection pumps Tested them in the lab Almost sure to get the patent and now they want to go into production Their deal with a French motor manufacturer isnt solid yet They need to go into production now for that they need money How much do they need And how much do you want interest Equity l want to set the rules for the negotiation You can look in three directions First at the opposing party and not at the lawyer but at Dr Fritz the business manager The guy is an engineer a developer He hates three things money negotiations chatter When he sits back gaze at him calmly When he looks back hold your gaze for two or three seconds Then look again at your screen The second direction is your screen Why On the screen are the balance sheets and they show why he cant get a normal loan anymore d like to remind him of that now and then And the third direction Do you know broker posing Like young lawyers in lousy Grisham films l dont like to sit this way at negotiations but it has an effect lf l do the broker pose then lean over and whisper something to me What Doesnt matter anything Like those court scenes when someone slips the lawyer a note and right away he whispers to someone Everyone wants to know what was on the note They lose their concentration Put these on please No they wont do at all in July well mount them on Formula One cars Sorry How many Three to start Peter its important that it wont be a bulky lab model but a device that is a real product Pierre Sombart agreed to fit three cars with components for the first race Then to push to install them in the series in September The volume of the new series will be units it was Pierres idea to refit the older models That would make units lf it works its important for me that you say l believe in this plan We arent just talking about numbers You should reach your goal with utmost skill and principle l have a suggestion Lets do the maths what volume must be reached to breakeven Lets fix that number Ms Fichte One moment Mr Prietzel These assets you just mentioned set at one million what are they based on its in the documents before you Assets based on real estate network software inventory etcetera For your network and software you calculated Euros it isnt even a year old yes But you wouldnt get more than its worth at least l noticed Dr Fritz the that the network supposedly cost doesnt appear in your deduction report What deduction report Your tax report With all due respect this isnt the tax office here l was wondering why this investment doesnt appear as costs in the report The only reason l can see is that it wasnt an investment at all l cant follow you anybody else l believe that the hardware and software for the network was acquired from the bankruptcy of another company How much did you pay for it The Dissolve Group received Euros in August Another Euros was paid to a software firm to configure a network The Dissolve Group specialises in sales of insolvent companies is that where you got your network Possibly Excuse me but what does this have to do with our negotiations here Perhaps this insolvent company did pay Euros for the network But resale netted them only it turns up here worth again How much would you get for it What Ms Fichte is trying to say its not about security We arent at the tax office but neither are we at the local bank its not about security and loans its about perspectives l think thats what we should work on Did you see Prietzels face l have to apologise to you What for l underestimated you You really know balance sheets You thought l slept with SchmittOtt to get that job That doesnt matter to me Thats not an answer Youre right Really good job Thanks m the one whos grateful l have lots to do Good night Ben Ben Ben Lets get out of here No Your door was open Are you packing You know those cartoons about stupid questions guy takes out the rubbish and an idiotic neighbour at the fence says Are you

course Klaus That was our employer You were listening You acted like you were reading something on your screen but your eyes werent moving is that why l should wear glasses l thought we agreed on percent See you were listening Something funny How about a short break Ms Fichte Theyll come back and ask for an adjournment l think so too That was nice the way you laughed He strikes a pose and we just laugh at him You like the work right Thats clear Dr Friedrich would like to adjourn for now Until Wednesday Same time same place Wednesday isnt possible Friday Friday Theres in this envelope Here are deposit slips for the cash l already filled them out Could you deposit this for me You split the sum up Yes otherwise they must declare it ll wait for you in the caf over there Excuse me theres

and how you see the situation But you know we arent here to audit your assets nor look at your warehouse we arent taking inventory lf we were our offer would be quite different How so Your warehouse
