It is said that over years ago in the town of Darkness Falls Matilda Dickson was adored by all the children Whenever one of them lost a tooth they would bring it to her in exchange for a gold coin earning her the name The Tooth Fairy But fate was not kind to Matilda one night fire tore through her home on Lighthouse Point Ieaving her face horribly scarred Matildas burned flesh was so sensitive to light she could only go out at night always wearing a porcelain mask so no one could ever look upon her face one day two children didnt come home The townspeople blamed Matilda They hanged her tearing off her mask exposing her hideous face to the light And with her dying breath Matilda laid a curse upon Darkness Falls The next morning the two children were found safe and sound The town buried their secret along with Matildas body Since then there are some who believe that Matilda visits the children of Darkness Falls on the night they lose their last tooth seeking her vengeance on any who lay their eyes upon her face fulfilling her curse What l took before in kindness l will take forever in revenge Youre going to ask Caitlin to the dance tomorrow right Youll do great love you

Shit this one l cant even pronounce Doc says half of these are antipsychotics Now l dont know much about medicine but it occurs to me that if a man is taking antipsychotics he might have a tendency to become well psychotic Rays dead Hes dead think you had something to do with it didnt kill him didnt do this No it must have been dont know He hasnt been the same since his moms murder Hes not a killer How do you know You havent seen him in years Because l know Hes a good man Hes been a ward of the state But he came to help Michael He was in a mental hospital for nine years Caitlin hes a dangerous guy had a file sent over from State Hospital about you Ten feet long You spent a lot of time there MaJor disassociative syndrome night terrors sociopathic tendencies three suicide attempts didnt do

security Michael Can you hear me Its okay Shes gonna get me Its okay Your brother is suffering from a form of Pavor Nocturnus or night terrors Because of his lack of sleep hes suffered a psychotic break Once that occurs the subJect cant discern what is real and what is not They begin to manifest a response How do you mean patient may hurt themselves because they believe what they dream is real Michael feels that something is after him wanting to kill him And his selfinflicted wounds are consistent with this fantasy The good news is that there is a procedure we can perform right here which has had an overwhelming success rate Is it surgical No not at all Michael is placed in a sensory deprivation chamber He faces his fears and realizes theres nothing to fear Tests Michael hates the dark Yeah Thats the point Is there any other alternative Aggressive medication coupled with counseling There are no guarantees Meanwhile Michael might hurt himself again Ray and l were Just sitting there having drinks and Walsh starts fighting with Ray Where are my flashlights Labs not done with them Thats all you remember The words youre looking for are thank you Hey Kyle Kyle wait up m having a bad
