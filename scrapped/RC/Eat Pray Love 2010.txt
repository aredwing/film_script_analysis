give you what you want and what you deserve lm not her Well you obviously know nothing about what l want My client would like to submit a song he wrote that he believes is relevant to these proceedings Goes something like this Are you kidding Quitter quitter quitter How about l take the blame am the one who couldnt deal with another weekend roaming some boxshaped superstore buying appliances on credit and pretending to be a couple that neither one of us ever knew how to be You wanted that toaster You like faking it fine Youre stellar m the failure l suck at faking it lt was not

His heart is broken think he hates you m never letting you out of the basement Why dont we talk next week and well see where things stand Okay These things have a way of working themselves out So whyd

joking Not funny Well he had five Heinekens He was bombed Well not funny We dont look like the same dog If anything youre a collie and lm a Tibetan mastiff Dont you wanna give me a chance to miss you It begins when the object of your affection bestows upon you a heady hallucinogenic dose of something youve never even dared to admit you wanted an emotional speedball of thunderous love and excitement Soon you start craving that attention with the hungry obsession of any junkie When its withheld you turn sick crazy not to mention resentful of the dealer who encouraged this addiction in the first place but now refuses to pony up the good stuff Just frustrated lm concerned dont understand What dont you get Whats going on You dont look me in the eye You dont finish your Nobodys asking you to make the bed You dont have sex with me Sometimes m not in the mood Goddamn him and he used to give it to you for free Next stage finds you skinny shaking in a corner certain only that youd sell your soul just to have that one thing one more time Well then why dont we discuss it Why dont we sort it Why dont we act like adults Okay Can have a little space How about that Meanwhile the object of your adoration is now repulsed by you You dont always make me miserable Theres a comfort just Sometimes l need to come home and have a little David time He looks at you like someone hes never met before ls that okay Yeah No its fine And not have to like you know justify it The irony is you can hardly blame him mean check yourself out Youre a mess Unrecognizable even to your own eyes You asked me to come here Here l am And it turned into something else Didnt it You are such a child Right cant take this anymore Great Perfect Thats a great response to a conversation Goddamn it You have now reached infatuations final destination The complete and merciless devaluation of self You wanna go away for a year Do you know what felt when l woke up Delia Nothing No passion no spark no faith no heat Absolutely nothing ve gotten past the point where can be calling this a bad moment And it just terrifies me Jesus this is like worse than death to me the idea that this is the person m gonna be from now on This happens to people They fall in love in their s get married do the granite countertop whitepicket fence in their s and somewhere they realize This is not for me So they fail and they

anyway We accept that we fight a lot and we hardly have sex anymore but that we dont wanna live without each other And that way we can spend our lives together miserable but happy not to be apart Dear David We havent had any communication in a while and its given me time needed to think Remember when you said we should live with each other and be unhappy so we could be happy Consider it a testimony to how much love you that spent so long pouring myself into that offer trying to make it work But a friend took me to the most amazing place the other day Its called the Augusteum Octavian Augustus built it to house his remains When the barbarians came they trashed it along with everything else The great Augustus Romes first true great emperor how could he have imagined that Rome the whole world as far as he was concerned would be in ruins During the Dark Ages someone came in here and stole the emperors ashes In the th century it became a fortress then a bullring They stored fireworks in here after that Nowadays its a bathroom for the homeless so you better watch your step going down Its one of the quietest and loneliest places in Rome The city has grown up around it over centuries It feels like a precious wound like a heartbreak you wont let go of because it hurts too good like it messy We all want things to stay the same David guess the guy before me mustve been some angel huh Settle for living in misery because were afraid of change of things crumbling to ruins Then looked around in this place at the chaos its endured the way its been adapted burned pillaged then found a way to build itself back up again and was reassured Maybe my life hasnt been so chaotic Its just the world that is and the only real trap is getting attached to any of it Ruin is a gift Ruin is the road to transformation Hey You ready Yeah Even in this eternal city the Augusteum showed me that we must always be prepared for endless waves of transformation Both of us deserve better than staying together because were afraid well be destroyed if we dont My mothers stuffing Stale bread walnuts got those Will you get me some more potatoes Oh lm always getting you more potatoes Its my dream a real American Thanksgiving The perfect way to say goodbye to our Liz So you leave this week huh Yes And where are you going lran India Liz is making us an American meal tonight You are not married yeah No Whats wrong with your friend is she a lesbian No Mama shes not a lesbian And she understands ltalian Hows she going to find another husband and start a family when shes on the other side of the world If a man said lm going to travel for a year and meet wonderful people But shes not a man Its more difficult for a woman to feel that she has the right to make choices lt takes a lot of courage Exactly You call it courage call it stupidity Mama enough know a number of people who would agree with you Luca What time will the turkey be ready The turkey havent defrosted it yet Oh shit You only had one thing to do and you screwed it up was distracted It can happen Too much good food Too many women And l forgot Now before we eat everyone it is Thanksgiving so let us give thanks Yeah Come on join hands Okay So we just say what we What we thank God for tonight Sofi why dont you start am grateful for you Liz for helping me appreciate life with all that comes with it muffin tops and bad times And for Giovanni for making me feel loved and secure And Giulio Me lm grateful for my beautiful family My two little daughters and my wife thank God and the Holy Virgin for this very very special day And for this beautiful family that today is so much bigger Very much bigger thank you all for this new custom of celebration And Lizs stuffing and God for my sexiness And you Ruffina thank God for my sexiness Go ahead Giovanni thank God for fear because for the first time lm afraid the person next to me will be the one who wants to leave Liz Well this all makes me so grateful Seeing all

children to bed just feel happy to see it and to be part of it m the luckiest girl in the world Its a good breakfast huh will take this to your room It has already started l fell asleep Yeah Pity Probably the only person in the world who ever fell asleep during meditation This leads to the meditation garden ls the guru here Shes always here l know but is she here here Shes at her ashram in New

What is it you have trouble with Everything Its long its tedious cant keep up and l get these insane anxieties about everything in my life and lve lost my place Sounds like it has a positive effect if

happiness too much pleasure until make yourself sick Even to Wayan this happen at beginning of my love affair lose myself Liz Dear friends and loved ones My birthdays coming up soon If were home ld be planning a stupid expensive birthday party and youd all be buying me gifts and bottles of wine cheaper more lovely way to celebrate would be to make a donation to help a healer named Wayan Nuriyasih buy a house in Indonesia Shes a single mother ln Bali after a divorce a woman gets nothing not even her children To gain custody of her daughter Tutti Wayan had to sell everything even her bath mat to pay for a lawyer For years theyve moved from place to place Each time Wayan loses clientele and Tutti has to change schools This little group of people in Bali have become my family And we must take care of our families wherever we find them Today l saw Tutti playing with a blue tile shed found in the road near a hotel construction site She told me Maybe if we have a house someday it can have a pretty blue floor like this When was in Italy learned a word Its tutti with double which in ltalian means everybody So thats the lesson isnt it When you set out in the world to help yourself sometimes you end up helping Tutti Tell me again Eighteen thousand American dollars brought you the emails to look at Oh my God We get a house It can be the house for everybody can have a pharmacy can have a library All right Oh God Close them again Close your eyes Careful You dont wanna break a tooth or anything Dont worry but close your eyes Where are you taking me You will see You helped Wayan to get a house l know and were going to celebrate Here here here All right Turn turn turn l know were at the beach Here you go Were going to take a little boat trip Where Where To a little island nearby Its my favorite place in the world ve packed for two We can stay there until next Tuesday And l have the perfect camping spot Just you and l and parrots Do you like it was going to save it for tonight but think this is the right moment have to be in Bali because my business is here and you have to be in New York because thats where your life is right What if we tried to create a life that is divided between the two places Why would you wanna do that Because m in love with you Lets go Lets go Oh no What l cant lm sorry l just You cant lm sorry cant Cant what cant go on a trip right now okay havent been home in five days havent seen Ketut in weeks lts just too much lts not much To go by ourselves apart from everything else for a couple of days is that much for you Liz no entendo Whats the problem Liz mean l have the same fears have the same scars that you have and l show them to you But l guess the only difference between you and l is that you are afraid to love again My darling this is it You have to look me in the eye and let me know the truth Please Do you love me or do you love me not Look me in the eyes and tell me do you love me or dont you love me not lts very easy know you feel the same way Why cant you say it back dont know why Why cant l Because youre terrified my love But listen its fine Me too But l still want to get into that boat with you No Okay look Look What dont know why you cant understand this found something and l cant give it up And trust me if did you wouldnt be so all in love with me Okay the balance thing You traveled around the world to find your balance And the balance that you think youve found is what Meditating for minutes and going to see an old medicine man Listen balance my darling balance is not letting anybody love you less than you love yourself You know what You know what Do not tell me what lessons l have and havent learned in the last year and dont tell me how balanced and wise you are and how cant express myself And do not say darling to me again because l am just gonna lose it Listen to me l do not need to love you to prove that l love myself Run away from me You are running away from all the great possibilities of your own life m getting into that boat For you goodbye gift Ketut Liss you healed me You healed me too Ketut If it wasnt for you wouldnt have come back to Bali and l wouldnt have come back to myself You want coffee Roast pig Coffee get you coffee You fly back to America soon In two hours Have you ever been on an airplane Ketut Ketut cannot fly on aeroplane Ketut have no teeths You are good friend to me You are like daughter When die you will come back to Bali Come to my cremation Balinese cremation ceremony is very fun You will like it Okay You still smile with your liver like l tell you Yes You still meditate like your guru in India teach you Yes You happy now with God Yes You love your new boyfriend ended it Dont understand Why you do that couldnt keep my balance Liss listen to Ketut Sometimes to lose balance for love is part of living balanced life In the end ve come to believe in something call The Physics of the Quest force in nature governed by laws as real as the laws of gravity The rule of Quest Physics goes something like this If youre brave enough to leave behind everything familiar and comforting which can be anything from your house to bitter old resentments and set out on a truthseeking journey either externally or internally and if you are truly willing to regard everything that happens to you on that journey as a clue and if you accept everyone you meet along the way as a teacher and if you are prepared most of all to face and forgive some very difficult realities about yourself then the truth will not be withheld from you Felipe cant help but believe it given my experience decided on my word It means Lets cross over
