good idea of what we do here Yeah he said you guys get paid pretty well for just taking a few pictures and uh Every now and then things get a little physical but Its not like you guys are running around in the middle of a gun fight or something right Right Is that what he said well yeah Is that dont worry about that Listen sometimes things get a little physical but m assuming since Nick sent

there drop off the pictures thats it Yeah then we start looking for the action stars Theyre in there Youll see dont recognize this guy at all Tomas de la Cruz is actually a popular action star from a small town in Peru He made some cheesy action films and now hes got himself a little cult following What do you mean cheesy action films Cut What the hell Whats wrong Somebody got the boom in the shot Somebody got in my shot Who Jesus Christ Well m not doing all that again so you guys better just cut that up and take it from uh this guys fall Uh hes uh not conscious What This is not the fake piece of wood Why would there be any real pieces of wood anywhere near me during this part of the fight And what is the purpose if may ask of all this powder told you theres too much powder Told me Yeah Yeah you Why is that my responsibility Have him do it Hey hold up Hold up What could do it Wow All right you know what He can do it okay m gonna go take a break You guys figure it out Let me know when you need me And get this guy some medical attention or something Jesus Tomas Manny just tell Carl that m getting paid enough for this masterpiece m working on now Yeah okay Whos this What Thats just Thats just his fan that came up to me and wanted an autograph Yeah Yeah sure he is Come on You know m here to bring back something of value All right got some cash in the car all right Just hang on Yeah let me come with you Make sure your fans dont get too hostile Tomass Beatdown put Carls righthandman in the hospital Damn Carls not a guy you want to be making bets with mean hes closer to a mob boss than he is to a bookie So why is Tomas up here if hes an action star down in Peru He thought he could break into the industry up here Since he couldnt catch a good break he started betting on a few things to make some money back but the losses started racking up pretty quickly So what we we find him tell Carl where he is Thats usually how its supposed to go but if it was that easy wouldnt need a partner to back me up People dont like being followed around you know Yeah well Maybe they can choose their friends a little better then you know All right who is this and where is he allowed to be in action movies man Sameer Yousef Another popular action star from Sahab Wheres that small city in Jordan Doesnt matter Sameers actually been following in Tomass footsteps for years He claims he taught him everything he knows So Sameer owes Carl money too dont know But Sameers been seen with Tomas Hes the only connection we have right now So far we dont know if Tomas has any other friends up here and we still dont even know where the guy lives So then how are we even supposed to find these guys Well Tomas is gonna be tough but Sameer is actually a lead in an indie action film that is now on hold cause he walked off So were just gonna have to keep an eye out for that production to get up and running again Okay cut Did he just say cut m feeling a little hungry so why dont you go ahead and bring my stunt double for now while take a rest Okay Yeah right Okay Uh well all right Lets get the stunt double out Okay this guys terrible man What do you say we shoot the last few moves with the stunt double Sure Its good to make sure Yeah Okay yeah Yeah were gonna take it back a few shots all right guys Hey You know could do these moves but wouldnt want to stop the pace right now Yeah okay All right Hey do your thing man Do they look alike He came highly recommended Yeah thats fine But we still have to shoot the shot Now how do we do that when they dont look alike If you shoot it at the right angle Guys sorry about the confusion on that last take Lets just work on the set of moves that we did earlier and you guys will be great All right guys Lets lock it down Give me a slate Scene take Roll camera And action Wow Cut Wow That was incredible man Huh Man if this guy lost pounds you could have him as the lead Uh all right guys Thats dinner Foods out in the truck Lets go

make me look bad m just trying to do my job If you have a problem talk to the director Whoa whoa whoa whoa studied styles of martial arts and never needed this spinning kicking stuff just the element of surprise Hey whats that That was pretty good m glad you passed my test only surround myself with the best talent there is And you my friend are good enough to be my stunt double Find someone else asshole Okay Okay thats fine But just to let you know that you wont be nothing in this industry Nothing Hey whats going on man Why am seeing Dave walk off like that If you cant hire a professional
