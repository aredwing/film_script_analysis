blows loud note All right Mrs Limestone being a big softie you know loves walks in the park bedtime stories big romantic Loves Chet cant play Chet but ll see what can do Watch the oscilloscope all right Here we go playing offkey clears throat Dr Joshua Keyes Maybe Yes or no sir The first one Please come with us sir stammers Guys whats going on We dont know sir What do you mean you dont know Your security clearance is higher than ours have security clearance Were just here to bring you to yourjet have a jet man speaking French Hey Serge Serge Serge Damn Its about time Youre always late Lets keep moving gentlemen What am doing here They wouldnt brief me until you got here You know there are biochemists everywhere military hate them When are you going to meet a nice girl and bring her for dinner m married to my work So am Which makes my wife my mistress Thats why m still in love with her You were always a romantic love my wife Yeah know love your wife too know But dont love your wife You know what mean You dont love her the same way you know Its the French think its the cheese Ah the cheese both laugh Youre youre teasing me right Oh my Whoa Wait these are bodies think were in the wrong place here Yeah were in the wrong place man No If you were in the wrong place you wouldve already been shot Thats a hell of a greeting Serge Serge Serge Yes Always a pleasure Same here Thomas Dr Keyes know Tom Purcell Gentlemen you do realise that everything here is totally classified At am local time all within a tenblock radius died They didnt get sick first They simply hit the ground dead Nerve agent Tom Our first guess No They all died at the same time Tom As far as we can tell to the second This hits in one hour need a reason Serge ls there a variation in sex age body type They all had pacemakers Under a minute Your reputation is welldeserved Hey hey hey Tom How did you guess without any clues from the victims No thats Serge and are the clues mean he specialises in high energy weapons do geomagnetics So calling us means you suspect an electromagnetic pulse weapon If these are the only fatalities they must be people susceptible to electronic interference pacemakers Youre spooky sometimes Tom Now need to know did some sort of weapon kill these people The power that you would need to create an pulse strong enough mean thats thats not a weapon that ve ever heard of No were done Were not done sir Theres nothing on the other side of the equal sign agree with Joshua Thank you Our greatest concern was this may have been an act of war but since its not think we can all breathe a little easier cant we door opens cooing Look at my hat child squeals What is it sweetheart pained cooing Its son These things happen all the time birds squawking Lets go lets go Come on screams thudding people shouting squawking continues people screaming Jusfin You bloody idiot boy Hurry Run screaming continues grunts tyres screech both grunt child shouts squawking continues all screaming Child Daddy sobs man on The skies are empty over Nelsons Column now but a few hours ago it was a different story Eyewitnesses claimed that the frenzied swarms of birds were not in fact attacking people deliberately And its not just this time Nononononono The Fortean Times reported violent bird swarms twice last month in Australia and Japan this bizarre and terrifying incident in Londons historic Trafalgar Square Weird Mmhm Quite strange also Mm Strange indeed How do birds navigate woman By sight No no no the long range stuff woman Magnetic fields Little ions in their brains align with the magnetic field of the Earth Yeah what she said Right Acker Hit the Net do a search for oh two years ought to do it Any and all like weird news you know bizarre animal migrations specifically birds Whale and dolphin beachings Uh unusual atmospheric phenomenon unexplained plane crashes you know just use your imagination That is a huge search You can use our line to look up Sailor Moon crap Youre up to this Danni Danni get me the brightest kids from the Field Theory class and design a computer model of an electromagnetic field What are we doing need a computer model of the Earth to lay the field over Whoa the planet Earth Yeah the planet Earth You know the pretty blue one Map out the anomalies that Acker finds and grunt out the equations And grab those smelly kids from the NonLinear Diff class too Listen Josh do we even have time for this Do this and ll sign your doctorates blindfolded Danni Blindfolded Blindfolded Do not pass Go Go directly to Ph Be wrong Be wrong typing on keyboard Tim m coming in a little hot Give me some drag will you Roger that clears throat We are in attitude and ready for entry interface Nice work Major have the controls now for l could take us in You could but you wont m ready for this Bob Oh no youre not Beck Youre trained and youre certified Doesnt make you the commander And the commander lands the bird You got to be the youngest person ever in space You should say thank you be happy Now man Endeavour Houston at this time we show you go for reentry Beck Houston Endeavour descending through feet coming upon entry interface Endeavour this is Flight Werent able to annoy the commander into letting you bring her in this time Thats a negative Stick ll have to be more annoying next time Is that even possible laughs man Endeavour we see you in good entry config Beck Roger Houston Tim Advise Bob m seeing those plasma trails now Tim All right mark and a Bob So a minute to air Beck dont believe in bets Just get me through the Earths atmosphere in this spaceship beeping Com dropout Tim Start the Com Bob Lets wait till the uh Com restored alarm beeping chattering Quiet We are out of position here Guidance shows us on energy and on course Well ve made this approach Were not where we should be Where the hell are we Stick Endeavour guidance is bad You are now niner miles off course Roger Houston We sort of noticed Is that Los Angeles That is confirmed We are thousand feet We got maybe two minutes of glide time left Doesnt make sense The guidance the beacons are all wrong Were heading straight for downtown Were not gonna crash into Los Angeles Theyre going to hit downtown at knots Bob you know Because have an idea Houston those buildings are getting mighty big Can you clear a freeway thank you Come on Come on Its rush hour Commander and its bumpertobumper Sir have an alternate If you turn to heading Its Houstons call Houston Computers are still plotting Come on rumbling crowd murmuring Houston we are running out of time here Sir have an alternate All right Beck what do you got Houston have coordinates for an alternate landing site Can you confirm Endeavour give them to me show possible touchdown at north west Stick Bill Its theoretically possible Endeavour that is confirmed Turn right heading Expect visual contact with Los Angeles River in five seconds No that will not work Houston We got bridges every few hundred yards Our wingspan alone is going to fold us up ve figured the over max We can make it if you can bring us straight in Were coming in high and hot Twoninety feet Twoseventy Arm the gear Tim Gear on Gear down Now Tim Gear in transition Twoforty feet Bob Hang on This isnt going to be subtle Twoten feet Get out of the way Move Derotate Bob Inward Speed brakes One hundred per cent Bob Were way too fast Deploy the chute No Wed snag the bridge Well tear the tail off Banking right Beck Commander that next bridge Watch it Were way too high for that one Suck up the gear Not yet Well lose all steering We hit its over And gear up now Lock your harnesses Its out of my hands all shouting Lets get out of here Run Lets get out grinder buzzing grinder off gasps Endeavour powering down exhales breathing deeply sirens approaching man Dr Zimsky Will you make sure my assistant has your number darling Sure Dr Zimsky Hello No its all right Hello Thank you sir Dr Zimsky Yes Whats your name Josh Keyes Josh No sir dont need you to sign it need you to read that laughs m sorry dont have time m late for the White House please Sir need you to confirm my results sir Young man do you have any idea who am Yes do sir Please read this camera clicking Whats it about Its the end of the world papers rustling sighs No this is impossible m sorry aughs cant have missed this You You have to be wrong mean look m sure with careful comparison to my own work well find that you are mistaken No of fence but Well mean well know soon enough The bigger effects will start up any day now beeping Rebecca Only you and Dad ever call me that Right Beck So what brings you to sunny The Board of Review is next week Just trying to get a sense of the mood upstairs How bad is it Your crew crashed the space shuttle Now how good do you think it could be Sir this is my life Well was studying for the academy when was It still is and has always been my life Its over Its over Rebecca m sorry elevator dings chattering man Really Its like the th of July What the hells the hurry here cell phone rings Rebecca would you excuse me please Excuse me Purcell Thomas um look it seems that destiny may have caught up with us Did Zimsky really try to give you his autograph Ah Monsieur Zimsky Conrad Zimsky Herr Zimsky Superstar Ahh exhales think skipped drunk Went right to hangover lowtempo music plays spoke with the kids They dont sleep at night They look at the sky and and they think its pretty Is there any chance youre wrong No The sky man The sky mean thats just the beginning Thats highaltitude static discharge know man Dr Keyes your presence is required at the Pentagon Ahh Its my best buddies Hey Why dont you join us for a drink Wed be grateful if you could join us for a ride sir And if were to say no Just asking Yeah Well we have no sense of humour Thats true Oh And were armed Thank you Tom Dr Keyes welcome Thank you Dr Zimsky informs us that you made a useful contribution to his investigations so he wanted you to assist him with the briefing Thats very generous of you Dr Zimsky Science is a selfless business dear boy Now why dont you begin and ll fill in all the difficult bits clears throat All right ll put this as simply as can sighs Everybody on Earth is dead in a year And let me explain why Wrapped around the Earth is an invisible field of energy Its made up of electricity and magnetism so its called creatively enough the electromagnetic field Its where we get our magnetic North Pole and South Pole and it protects us from cosmic radiation So this field is our friend But now But now that field is falling apart Why scoffs Why This here Does somebody have a can of air freshener Uh Quick and dirty The thin skin thats the Earths crust Thats what we live on Its miles thick The meat here call it the mantle And forgetting all the funky transitions its miles thick The core the peach pit in the centre thats a tricky one Theres two parts the inner core and the outer core Are you following me The inner core is Well its a big solid chunk of iron we think And thats surrounded by the outer core and that is liquid Yes but most importantly this liquid is constantly spinning in one direction So a trillion trillion tons of hot metal spinning at a thousand miles an hour so Right so Physics Hot metal moving fast makes an electromagnetic field This spinning liquid outer core is the engine that drives the Field And thats where we have our problem This engine has stalled The core of the Earth has stopped spinning How could this have happened people murmuring We dont know Whats the timeline here As the Field becomes more and more unstable well start seeing isolated incidents One plane will fall from the sky and then two and then in a few months anything everything electronic will be fried Static discharges in the atmosphere will create superstorms with hundreds of lightning strikes per square mile After that it gets bad The Earths Field shields us from the solar winds which are a lethal blend of radioactive particles and microwaves When that shield collapses microwave radiation will literally cook our planet Dr Zimsky clears throat This is the sun This is the Earth without the Field Would you Mmhm Three months gentlemen and were back in the Stone Age full year the field collapses and that May Feel free to throw up know did So how do we fix it We cant Not in my vocabulary Then you might want to get one of those wordaday calendars General because its impossible The core is the size of Mars Youre talking aboutjumpstarting a planet This is a superheated hyperfluid of molten iron and nickel at degrees Fahrenheit And the deepest weve ever been is seven miles with a twoinch drill bit If we can go into space we certainly Well space is easy Its empty Were talking about millions of pounds of pressure per square inch Even if we somehow came up with a brilliant plan to fix the core we just cant get there Zimsky Yes but what if we could Hello Braz Why the hell arent you dead yet this way Oh That went better than expected Dr Brazzelton see you know Dr Zimsky Yeah Twenty years ago he stole my research laughs After that we kind of lost touch Research that was equally mine Thats funny dont remember a cheque from any of the patents sighing All right Braz makes you a prophet and a martyr Look were here about your legendary ship m combining highfrequency pulse lasers with resonance tube ultrasonics If youve ever seen ultrasonic waves break up a kidney stone on the Discovery Channel its the same deal here Uh you can put your helmets on now motor starting Firing powering up shouting shouting engine powering down Braz Yeah Oh coughing Spits m officially impressed Zimsky Well all right So youve made some progress with the engine will grant you Uh have you begun to think about a shell this is Alex Alex Good here we have a concrete block and in back of that we have a twoinch steel plate engine powering up Were ready And we are firing engine powering down Voil Thats Thats impossible Braz combined the crystals in a tungstentitanium matrix at supercool temperatures and thats what did the trick The applications for this are just What do you call this material Well its real name has syllables call it Unobtanium Unobtanium Mmhm The Unobtanium will take the heat and the pressure and transform it to energy which in turn reinforces the shell of the ship you see So the hotter and the deeper she gets the stronger she gets theoretically Zimsky Theoretically Theoretically yes This is Johnson dont mind him This is the prototype for the cockpit here Excuse me Dr Brazzelton when do you think the ship will be operational When get my fabrication methods perfected Twelve ten years ten years What would it take to get it done in three months laughing Fifteen billion dollars Will you take a cheque Why dont you use a credit card You get miles Mm pounding man Shit man Mr Finch this is the We have a warrant pounding continues Finch Purge Computers beeping Come on purge Freeze dings clattering know these look like computers Totally not Theodore Donald Finch Carnegie Mellon University Worked at Sun Lucent Corp My handles Rat Call me Rat Sixtythree computer fraud indictments Sixtyfou r Two convictions This is strike three Mr Finch Wait a second You guys arent here to whack me are you Because was really really hoping to have sex before that happened Yeah ve been told by the whose database you crippled last year that you are the best in the business So youre about to be given a choice What if say no Excuse me but is this really the best we could do mean How many languages do you speak Five actually Well speak one One zero one zero zero With that could steal your money your secrets your sexual fantasies your whole life any country any place anytime want We multitask like you breathe couldnt think as slow as you if tried Do you have any idea hey Hey Lets just lets give the kid a break its a phone Its just a phone Rat we got a big problem lot of people are going to die We need your help What kind of help blows on wrapper Information control We need you to control the flow of information on the Internet Youre dreaming Nobody controls the Net Could you with unlimited resources You want me to hack the planet chuckles dialling phone He wants me to hack the planet blowing sounds phone dialling Youve got free long distance on that phone forever If decide to do this m going to need an unlimited supply of Xena tapes and Hot Pockets Hot Pockets They help me concentrate Sounds fair shoes squeaking door opens man Major Childs theyre ready for you swallows Major Childs a clarification You and you alone were responsible for proposing the descent vectors for the shuttle correct Yes General General We have determined that the Class landing mishap experienced by the Shuttle Endeavour was caused by biased navigational data from the ground due to a brief geomagnetic disturbance Major Childs the resourcefulness you showed in determining the descent vectors proved that you have exceptional navigational skills Youve brought much credit upon yourself the space programme and the United States Air Force Congratulations Major You are reassigned with Commander lverson and Flight Director Stickley to a new mission effective immediately Transportation is waiting outside Good luck and Godspeed Major chattering Serge Are you sure you want to wear this tie Josh Why Serge dont know mean you look so nervous about it You look so So how are you holding up Oh hi m good m good m about to tell a couple hundred people the world is going to end Well ve had better days You look good Well no you dont look good Why did he touch his tie like that Thomas let me speak with you for a moment Listen wouldnt you rather did this mean given my reputation think that No No Keyes is in the lead here Zimsky Yes Thomas this is the most important scientific operation in history And given my status feel that its my job to present Project Destiny was your job Zimsky And you went way beyond authorised limits And let me tell let me tell you still want to know if Destiny caused this problem Its highly unlikely but it may be the solution Now have not finished checking Excuse me Rebecca m so glad was wrong Right over left No the other left the other left Gentlemen And then you Gentlemen Commander lverson Major Childs this is your crew Dr Brazzelton knows the ship Hello Tom Dr Zimsky knows the planet Doctor Dr Leveque knows the weapons system Excuse me ladies first Hi Tom And Dr Keyes clears throat Dr Keyes built the navigation system So Hi Rebecca Childs Bob lverson These are your fellow fellow what Terranauts Stick Hello All this brain power over here is starting to smell like burning batteries all better come and join in Yeah Its the simplest things that are the hardest huh Yeah Its official m the leastqualified person on this base Dr Keyes m sure the people in charge have every confidence in you Well the problem is that m in charge chuckles Yeah know Can help you Yes please clears throat Youre an astronaut and you can tie a Windsor Mmhm Is there anything you cant do Not that m aware of find that incredibly intimidating Yep Most people do Here Thank you Youre welcome Tom Let me introduce our project leader Dr Joshua Keyes Josh Thank you thank you Good evening Good evening Wow This looks like a meeting for Nobel Prize Winners Anonymous know you are all the finest in your fields and have come a long way to be here So ll outline our programme over the next three months Dr Brazzeton will supervise the building of a ship which is capable of reaching the centre of our planet Once there it will deliver an explosive charge large enough to restart its core Dr Zimsky will calculate the scale of the explosion needed Zimsky This is a program designed to simulate the effect of nuclear detonations on the core If my calculations are correct a tiny nudge in any direction will force the core back into its normal flow Whats a tiny nudge in planetary terms thousand megatons give or take Zimsky Tops Because any more than that would create a core instability Serge We made a few monster warheads in the megaton range Braz do you think the ship can handle five of these babies Yeah can enlarge the ejection pod Bob Forgive me but you know know m not the expert here but what if the core is thicker or thinner mean what if its not what you think it is Isnt that going to affect the way the explosions are Yes yes yes yes And what if the core is made of cheese This is all best guess Commander Thats all science is is best guess So my best guess is you dont know Josh With luck irony will break for the good guys for once and the worlds biggest weapons of mass destruction will help save the world The ship will be powered by a small experimental nuclear reactor It will be divided into six compartments like cars on a train the locomotive unit navigation compartment living quarters engineering bomb compartment and finally the weaponscontrol module Up to a degree angle every compartment will be held level by these gyro control gimbals But if we do breach a section bulkhead doors engage automatically seal off the section in red and eject Is ejection really the best option Only option Each damaged compartment degrades the entire hull Josh The objective is simple The obstacles are gigantic Were going to need all the help in the world but if we are to avoid panic and chaos the world at large can never know whats happening here Which is where our friend Mr Rat comes in Rat Its called Virusbot Its a computer virus that will seek out files anywhere on the Web that contain keywords that we designate and wipes them out This is my kung fu and it is strong Josh Meanwhile there are a million puzzles ahead of us and we have three months to solve them We have a committed and ingenious team We have every resource available to us and we have the best of the worlds scientific and technical talents on our side With your help we can we must succeed indistinct conversations Feedback in the resonance tube Talk to me gentlemen Serge We are losing structural integrity No its not feedback Its an impeller malfunction believe No its not no If it were an impeller malfunction For Gods sakes Braz make the call No ll make the call should make the call Beck Sixtyfive knots Depth thousand feet okguys Its a disaster laughing alarm blaring What part of talk to me dont you guys understand For the nd time in a row everyone on Earth is dead Lets take a little quiet time and you all are going to try this again Hey Hi What is this Uh well its invented it Its how youre going to going to steer underground Its not very good reception Josh Well uh youre looking through three feet of lead at yards away so it aint bad Its like a scan at a hospital but its uh its soupedup invented it for deep earth surveying And then the government came in bought my research paid off my student loan guys and made me a consultant m sorry this is really delicate And have it just the way want it So excuse me Uh Yeah Then they brought me in when the pacemakers quit and boom you know m Apocalypse Boy Apocalypse Boy Yeah m having shirts made up Well hats sell better You know its funny because that is right where it should be Well m sorry m a little ragged around the edges m just trying to get this thing to focus correctly This is cool but can just Well Mmhm Its better Its better Ah electrical zapping God hate this sky crashing sounds alarm blaring sighs Bob Crashing one ship isnt enough for you Hey Practice makes perfect You can practise all you like It doesnt mean youre ready to sit on that seat So you keep reminding me sir You know doubt youre even going to listen to this but m going to give it a shot Being a leader isnt about ability Its about responsibility Got it sir No you dont Beck mean youre not just responsible for making good decisions You have to be responsible for the bad ones You got to be ready to make the shitty call What makes you think m not Because youre so good You havent hit anything you couldnt beat mean hell you were the one who figured out how to save the shuttle You made me you made the rest of just look like an ass Its just that youre used to winning and youre not really a leader until youve lost Braz billion has been spent developing this system Josh Oh come on guys the chefs at wouldnt call them chefs all arguing want wine need wine Its about nutrition In five days think Whoa Zapping Thats highlevel static discharge think we should check this out This doesnt look so good rapid chattering Josh Its a lightning superstorm Popping up all over the world Got em Tracking Uhoh Rome does not look good electrical zapping crowd murmuring patrons chattering man speaks foreign language on hissing all shouting howls all screaming screaming continues Sirens woman speaking foreign language on This planet is decaying faster than we thought Its just the start Soon theyll be spikes and microwaves will break through the weak spots and All right Get this ship in the ground Now Fihunde sneezes groans Summer in the Pacific Yeah the world is inside out Serge was saving this for later but this is the time for laughs Josh do you mind No not at all Yeah We should have a name for this baby Oh shes called Virgil actually Virgil the poet that led our man into the depths of hell Thats it Thats appropriate guess Well heres to Virgil To the planet all To Virgil No flashbulbs no press nobody cheering Its weird Lets go Fihunde chattering Bob Cabin pressure Beck Check Bob cabin repress open And repress closed Check Fluid dump valve We are about to begin ourjourney

At rpm we will countdown to launch On your mark Pad leader stand by for launch All right Virgil Mark Gantry count Ten nine eight seven six five four three two one launch Five hundred feet Levelling out guys lets swing forward Eight hundred feet Light em up Beck beeping Gyro levelling operational Hull integrity holding m going to keep her nose down about degrees and whale sounds Oh my goodness Theyre singing to us Virgils resonance tubes are powered up so theyre vibrating subsonically Actually were singing to them hull creaking Whats our depth Sixteen hundred feet plenty of room on both sides Hull integrity is good You sure Lets increase impeller speed think well be needing additional control beeping Stick m getting a seismic reading Whats happening phase Underwater earthquake rumbling Still think the waterlaunch was a good idea Yes yes chose this location because the crust is thin here The downside is theres lots of seismic activity Four thousand feet You see that rock That is not good Were losing steering here Theres some kind of crosscurrent Fourteen thousand feet guys fasten your seat belts Were turning into the skid Eighteen thousand Eighteenfive Theyre going way too fast alarm blaring Twentyone thousand feet We hit the wall were rabbits on the highway Braz Pressure pressure pressure pressure What do you mean pressure thought you said this thing was indestructible said the pressure makes us stronger We just dont have enough of it yet Were at feet Pull out sir Cant What Were locked in Go to full throttle Standby to engage front and lateral lasers please But what if we hit bottom in ten seconds here Just give it a couple of more seconds The lasers will fire No theres not enough time for powerup Twentyseven thousand feet Braz The lasers will deploy Twentynine thousand feet Do it And Do it Now monitor beeps beeping And weve got a signal man All right all applaud All right clears throat Switching on electron spin burst transmitters Ah plotting through lowest density material reconfiguring every five minutes exhales Hull integrity per cent Reactor power per cent All green on the bomb compartment Speed is knots laughs Hot damn All right well be through the crust in minutes and into the mantle Twentyfour hours to the core and then assuming we survive Assuming Yes assuming Another hours to the inner coreouter core border beeping Theyre doing well The crust is just rock Now it gets interesting Virgil can we get a status check Were about to make the transition into the mantle rumbling Come on come on exhales Well exterior pressure is pounds per square inch And hull integrity is per cent Its as if we were diving through the memories of the planet But we are about to pass from memory into madness Are you going to be doing that Carl Sagan narration all the way to the core beg your pardon said stammers have an obligation to my students An obligation to make a book deal perhaps Zimsky Two book deals if youd like to know the truth read that last book It wasnt very good Zimsky Oh really Really When did you learn how to read Braz You amaze me Bob People Drs Zimsky and Keyes You guys are our resident geophysicists What do you make of this The mantle is a chemical hodgepodge of a variety of elements Say it with me dont know Well Commander wise men say When in doubt you should go around No Its too big We turn too slow Anything that we cant go through displays as black So whats whats static Its nothing What do you mean Its nothing Its empty space never taught the computer how to read empty space And never taught Virgil how to fly Oh God all grunting Oh no man Bob Oh dear God grunts shouts groaning Ah screams all grunting panting Serge you all right Yeah Anybody hurt No You Yeah craft hissing Whats that What is that From the cooling system Shut that down Shut it down told you to go around her Nobody listens to me Where in Gods name are we Whatever has us jammed up is inside our lasers Shut em down Were not going anywhere Powering down ship powers down Josh is there any other image you can pull up Nope Whatever it is its also inside our cameras We have to go outside Serge What Believe me hate to admit it but think hes right m coming want to collect samples Bob Wait hang on hang on The first problem is the only way out of the ship is the way we came in which is through the impeller outlet Which is still at degrees Exactly mean ll just flush it with liquid nitrogen from the cooling system Wait The cooling system thats keeping us from roasting to death in this ship Well just a small part of it Alternatives Anybody heavy breathing Bob Whoa whoa thats it Josh Its like a giant giant crystal Zimsky Where the hell are we Bob Well the good news is it looks like the suits can take the pressure Its completelyjammed the laser assembly We just we got to hope if we can cut it loose theyre still functional Careful Got it Beck try the lights will you Lighting up Oh its magnificent Zimsky Oh my God Braz Aladdins cave Zimsky Its like a crystal Grand Canyon think its a geode But dont understand how it could have survived down here Cobalt shell maybe Zimsky Well mean in a magma environment of degrees Something would have to protect it Unbelievable Zimsky Yeah Were inside a giant gem bubble wrapped in a cobalt cocoon of the Earth Hell of a day Zimsky laughing Yes it is Braz ll start cutting Bob Braz m going to check the hull Call me if you need me tool powering up Zapping hissing Oh no Zimsky Yeah Zimsky Look Its an amethyst Zimsky Oh God weve breached the shell shouts gasps all shouting Guys you dont have to be here want you back inside Well think that means me Orders are orders VaJosh The problem is m losing oxygen Braz what can do Check the feeds for me Check the feeds for me Josh Quick m coming m coming as fast as can Hey guys at this rate we have three minutes before the lava gets to us Come on guys Come on beeps Braz Its not going to work without oxygen Were losing oxygen air hissing fixed it Now cut Braz Thats good Its working now Its working well now Thats good Josh Joshs vital signs are dropping What exhales Serge Braz Youre almost there Youre almost there Josh grunts Josh grunting grunts Joshua guys connect the oxygen Bob Braz you got that Braz Yes Connected Bob Good got to check these lasers Beck turn em over Prelasers only if you dont mind Initiating This better work The tides really coming in Yes We got lucky think were going to swim right out of this one Bob gasps long beep Bob Bob Braz come on its over Beck Beck Were coming in panting Initiate start sequence Beck Beck do you hear me Serge Careful Start the impellers The door open the door Activate bulkhead doors Now Beck gasps You Youre going to be weak Youre Good job good job Good man Well done well done Josh m fine Thank you So we have some good news and and we have some bad news Good news ll take good news All right Well were alive and were moving Thats g thats good news Oh it is hot in here Yeah that nitro we flushed out of the cooling system its causing things just to heat up a little m going to go back and make some adjustments ll lend you a hand m fine Beck m going to check your heartbeat Thanks Braz Appreciate it So thats the bad news Thats not too bad No Commander lverson died But were living and he would want to Hed want us to complete our mission so think that its important that we all Its all right Thank you m sorry Lets give him a second He deserves that Oh God this all just seems too big doesnt it think you were attempting the impossible You were trying to save the world and its overwhelming came here to save my wife and my two children and six billion lives its too much just hope m smart enough and brave enough to save three You did a nice job Joshua Very nice Great Youd have done the same thing Well maybe maybe Hey whos steering the ship Video screen autopilot hope he knows the way You and me both So youre really a college professor Youre not from the or the or any of those threeletter places No am a boring college professor Wrong place wrong place That was the bravest thing ve ever seen Well just just Listen the lack of oxygen kept me from weeping like a little girl as is my custom in dangerous situations Beck Hey guys were close to the mantle core interface Where are you Serge Keys in Dr Brazzelton Ready Josh We are in the luxurious beautiful Serge the code weapons control checking the controls on the nukes Serge This is the birthday of my daughter Braz Ready Three two and one Yeah Thank you Green All green Great So we have to synchronise the babies now Just a second There Mmhm All right now lets put them to bed Zimsky could you please come up here for a second Yes Were not supposed to go through anything black Yes so please dont What is this Zimsky Theyre scattered everywhere Oh my God Theyre diamonds Beck Great You might want to sit down and buckle up Were on a collision course here Alrighty Careful Guys were dodging diamonds the size of Cape Cod so bear with me Not exactly nimble here Diamonds want some Can help Oh thudding Its Beck it looks like were in the clear scraping alarm beeping Breach Guys Weapons control get out Get out now Josh Serge Serge What the hell are you doing Come on rge My notebook Serge Take the time reg Joshua Come on Serge Come on My notes Youll need them No God no Serge Its Serge come on No Serge We need the box Braz shouting We can get him We can get him Hold on Serge Beck Beck Override the ejection system Beck no One damaged compartment threatens the whole ship Beck Beck Override the ejection system Serge were right here Were not going to forget about you man Josh can you hear me Serge Serge Hey buddy look in your monitor right now Serge look in your monitor m right here Serge Josh cant see you Braz is going to override the doors manually Were working on it right now Braz how long Going as fast as can fast as can m scared Were going right now Shouldnt be two seconds all right Josh Beck override the ejection systems Damn it dont think Beck can hear me Serge look at me now Serge Serge were right here Were not going to forget about you man m going to get you out of here Were working on it all right Stay with me here sobs dont know what to do You can hear me now All right here am m not going to let you go man m not going to let you go all right Stay with me here m going to come to Paris and well go out all right After this After this is all said and done all right Josh Serge Serge Serge Serge Serge screaming Serge sighs inhales sharply kicking console Did you reset the overrides never pushed them You let him die Actually you really want to know killed him twice First when hit the diamond and then when didnt hit the override Do you want me to feel any worse about that than already do Its not possible Why are you being so smug about that Could you have made the decision Josh Yes Could you Yes couldve If you wouldve hit that switch couldve got him outta there was yelling for you Take it and look at it was two inches from him was two inches and told you to put the door up and you didnt was screaming for you Why didnt you do it Because had to make that decision Fate or God No Damn it You leave God out of this Serge died so that we could complete ourjob Oh thats right the job of saving the world Not the whole world Josh Just three of them monitor beeping quiet chattering Virgil you are approaching core interface Are you good to go Braz Josh Josh can you hear me Josh can you hear me Ready as well ever be Stick Dr Keyes Right here Deep Earth we are green and good to go We just got a huge speed jump Were at knots Our speeds jumped because the density of the core is different than our estimates Its lighter than we thought So much for best guesses Beck m fine with this At this rate well what hit the inner core in a little over five hours think we finally bought some luck Braz Yeah Would you please punch the new core density into the equations for the nuclear detonation Please tell me this is enough Failure Beck Youre telling me the megatons of nuclear warheads we hauled down here isnt going to cut it No This core material is too thin What Zimsky The energy waves from the explosion wont spread far enough Theyll just bleed away into nothing exhales stammers Thats it We go home We go home Josh Home Our commander is dead Our weapons specialist is dead Our weapons control systems are gone We dont know whether we can arm the nuclear devices and our plan to fix the core no longer works So we have failed We have not failed We have failed and we go home and we go to the alternative What alternative What are you talking about General this is Dr Conrad Zimsky Destiny is a go Repeat Destiny is a go sighs Damn need to know everything to do my job You dont have to know this General it is my job to ensure the safety of this mission Anything that affects it is my business Now what the hell is Destiny Its a device Deep Earth Seismic Trigger Initiative Destiny We had reason to believe that our enemies were building a weapon that could generate targeted seismic events They would be able to create massive earthquakes under our territory No way of telling who did it So So we built one too Mutually Assured Destruction perfect acronym if ever there was one Beautiful They built it first built it better beamed highpowered electromagnetic energy waves down Deep Earth fault lines and you know Zimsky what makes you think that Destiny would touch the core Josh Cause it already did This isnt a fluke We killed the planet Beck You keep saying that the core is too big to be affected by anything short of nukes So The core is an engine Throw a small wrench into a big engine you can still stall it Deep Earth this is Virgil We require clarification on the status of Project Destiny Why werent we notified of this sir Because you didnt need to know Now you may not like this may not like it either But its my job and do it for my country and if we dont develop these devices someone worse will and they will use them against us But you have my word No one in this administration no one had any idea that this could happen So the device that killed the planet is your backup plan An electric shock can stop a heart It can certainly restart one Destiny will work It has to No it wont work If you fire that thing again with the core already stalled itll terminally destabilise it Yes granted there is a marginal risk involved but given the circumstances hardly see that as an alternative No Zimsky listen to me Every volcano on the planet will blow Therell be earthquakes big enough to rip us to pieces Tom Dr Keyes What m afraid its all weve got Now have orders from the president Come home Virgil We go to plan Well what about plan What What Well plan We continue on We restart the core somehow We dont do it you fire Destiny cant wait for you to get out of there Then dont We fail fire Destiny Oh come on Thats ridiculous What choice do we have Zimsky Are you kidding me If they set that thing off the shock waves will wipe us out Well be lucky to get back if we turn back right now Virgil m telling you right now we will fire Destiny and we need to do so as quickly as possible and if youre still there you will be destroyed Rebecca Please dont make me have to do this Plan Its your call Commander Majority decision Were going in m sorry sir Oh come on youre a bunch of suicidal morons What are you crazy Plan Restart the core somehow Oh thats a great idea Thats a brilliant idea cant believe m stuck in this floating septic tank with you lunatics You may have nothing to lose You may have nothing to lose You may have nothing to lose but have my life to lose thank you very much while youre up Now turn it around He told us to go back and were going back Why You want to be a hero You want to be a martyr What do you want to be Youre out of your mind Thank you Turn it around No Zimsky m not gonna die like this dont wanna die Zimsky its not about you If you wanna die like this three people Shut up panting Its not a stupid ship had to It had to happen sometime Yeah computer beeping Um Status What is that Rat Its the monitoring station Its the one that tracks pulses God no sighs Just talk Mr Rat Rat No Thats a good boy Um Remember those invisible microwaves that Josh was talking about Well they just found a hole water boiling No its a parking lot out here sizzling sound screams sizzling sounds continue Oh my God rumbling sizzling sounds continue gasps screams people screaming woman on And now with this horrific breaking news we go live to San Francisco where Leo Jacks has the story Leo Yes Claire its hard to believe that half of San Francisco is in ruins today following the most devastating and the most baffling event in our nations history Uh its a horrific situation here Thousands are dead Many are missing Its hotels hospitals Bring up the power grid typing computer beeping The whole West Coast is out That means were going to have to suck up just about every drop of juice east of the Rockies to fire Destiny Another spike were not going to have enough power General you have got to give them more time Tom There is no more time Colonel call Destiny am launching a formal complaint against you with the Department of Defense Rat to Josh Go Rat Hey heres the field data that youre primed for Digging that Rat Primed for Primed for Prime numbers One two three five seven typing typing Here we go electrical zapping telephone ringing man James exhales Yes sir Yes sir Here we go folks Josh this time its going to work Here you go beautiful Yeah Mmhm Come on baby Come on Daddy wants to see the sky again Lets try again Your torque is cross No your is too small Josh Right Wait hold on Zimsky laughing What are you laughing at No mean it took me and of the worlds smartest people to come up with the first plan You want to help No want to turn around and go home Its not going to happen Well then were going to die True All right look lets start from square one Lets start from square one The bulk modules depends on density Your torque is cross but you have to integrate volume But here here just consider this Now we got this now cross were putting put in pi Whats Oh for Gods sake All right m hitting him again No no no Braz no look have a theory Are you interested Yes Were interested Then let me smoke a cigarette and ll tell you Oh thank God Braz whistles Hm All right fine look Look we have to use wave interference Because one explosion wont do it Think about stones in a pond You drop a large stone into a pond you get a big splash and then thats it its over But drop a smaller stone wait until the ripples weaken and drop another and another and another and fluid dynamics The ripples reinforce each other in geometric progression Braz The whole bigger than the sum of the parts Then well have five Instead of one big bang Josh So we hotwire the nukes Yes As one does We seed them through the core at locations that have to be accurate to the inch We detonate them in a sequence that has to be accurate to the millisecond then we outrun the biggest nuclear shock wave in history Right Yeah mean that should be fairly simple alarm blaring man should now be diverting to the central man Final calibration on both transmission systems indistinct chatter computer beeps Cut the cut the rouge The red wire above the circuit No no wait hold it m sorry cut it below computer beeps dont know what that means man Extensions man Here we go man check Increase power to reactors ten through Were almost there folks typing computer beeping typing beeping continues Beck guys were closing on the inner core The nukes are ready Timers are on Great Lets start dropping them No The bombs are not built for these pressures Thats why they were in that pod If you send them out now out of that casing theyll be crushed instantly m assuming we have a Plan Plan is Virgils compartments We put a nuke in each section of Virgil and then eject the individual sections one at a time They should stay intact long enough for the nuke to go off groans What Virgils not designed to eject undamaged compartments these are the ejection mechanisms holding each compartment in place um Theyre all connected by one master hydraulic gear um kind of like keys on a key ring What we have to do we have to unlock the piston That will release the compartments so the bombs can be jettisoned Wheres the master gear In the crawl space we used to get out earlier Well what the hell is it doing there built the ship in three damn months didnt think d be intentionally sabotaging it m sorry So one of us has to go in there Correct Into the crawl space that has core fluid at degrees Braz Yes Can you flush it with liquid nitrogen Braz We dont have enough at this point And our suits are built to withstand Half that probably Right Half that So what youre saying is whoever goes into that crawl space is not coming back Together Yes thank you Wait On three One two three Huh Well better go on get myself ready No Braz wait No Braz Excuse me Just a moment may see that No May May Yes Thank you Magic mean Braz three straws of equal length mean this is childish Lets do it again No we will not do it again laughs thought youd be happy No Not at the expense of you making us look like fools Hes right Why do you get dibs on being the hero Because its my damn ship Oh that makes perfect sense Look for years ve done nothing but Virgil years Virgil belongs to me and will not let her fail will not Now if you want to know whats worth dying for this ship Building it instead of imagining it If Virgil needs more blood it will be my blood Now am going to go and get ready Good to go BeckJosh Its a hell of a boat you built Braz am really proud to have known you guys Josh Thank you Braz Edward Yes Conrad Youre right It is your ship But wish to God it had been ours whooshing beeping The chambers sealed Beck Ready Open the hatch grunts Braz grunting screams sizzling Hang on Braz Come on hang on glass shattering computer beeping Manual override is complete Braz we can still get you out of there No Start start the impeller No panting We got a job to do Lets do it Lets go man Magnetic shielding systems are up Power levels per cent computers beeping Increase power to Reactor ten All personnel should be clear typing computer beeps Zimsky Josh shouting Zimsky Oh God Oh m sorry both grunting shes down Beck Approaching the first dropoff point We got to be accurate to the second here boys And drop in threefive seconds And timer on Pull it timer beeping Clear and ejecting telephone ringing All right Initiate firing sequence Sir Its our last shot Stick Damn you Damn me Too late man Ten nine eight Rat Whats that Gotcha man four three two Whoa whoa whoa Someones diverted our energy Where the hells it gone It looks like Coney Island Your kung fu is not strong Well how long will it take to get it back online Well then get to it Oh hey General ls there something can do for you Mm computer game beeping Timer on timer beeping Clear ejecting Ejecting Pull it All right Lets go throw our last little always wanted to make a splash in nuclear physics You know that energy propagation stuff you were talking about Oh that was high school physics Yeah its not exactly just took the wavelengths from the core fluid off the readings Yeah and multiplied by Six hundred Surely you compensated for the bias We got to reset the timers Zimsky Its not the timers No It just wont work Its not the timers This is not enough Whats not enough The last bomb is not enough To complete the wave form Yeah No The last bomb has to be per cent larger Thats six or seven pounds of plutonium Where are we going to get six or seven pounds of plutonium Ahh Guys we got hit by an energy flare cant keep us on course Ejecting compartment in seconds No Beck No wait No Push it You push it Come on guys cant hear you Its got my shoulder Ahh Push Guys Clear Clear the compartment What are you doing think the flare has knocked the come out cant get it Josh cant get it Go cant m sorry m sorry Can you hear me m correcting course Now shouts grunts ZimSky No groaning Push it both grunting Ejecting compartment in ten seconds Can you hear me Josh go Go Go Get out Get out Now Get out Now Go panting Josh For the last bomb to make it larger use the fuel rods from the react Ejecting groans got to get got to Beck Beck can you hear me Beck if you have any better ideas you tell me now Weve only have three minutes to eject this one Beck Come on guys cant hear you Beck beeping alarm blares sizzling grunts straining groaning sizzling cries out Oh beeps beeping Josh come on Are you panting Are you Will you take my gloves off Oh my God Please both wincing had to build the blast m sorry Hold on let me get No Stay here for one second was trying to call you know the come were down Right know what you did We dont have enough energy know to get back You did good wouldve done the same thing Wheres Zimsky Come here You did good You did good exhales One minute to the first detonation And until the blast hits us was hoping wed suffocate to death first beeping Beck Beck Beck What could you do if got you enough power to fire the impeller Maybe not the laser but the impeller What From where The heat of the core Its degrees Unobtanium converts heat to energy So this whole damn ship is like a big old solar panel Come on need your help Number twos going Come on come on For here in the great infinite unknowable man can come to know the most important thing of all Himself He can understand What the fuck am doing chuckles man Weve got full rotation man Its turning cheering All right cheering continues Josh Come on Beck where is it Come on Come on hurry up Is that the last one Yeah Give it a couple seconds zap beeping It worked Get ready to pull a few s Four hundred twenty knots Now this is more like it Fourforty Mr Rat whats the centre of this quake Its everywhere Its one giant shock wave The planets healing itself At this speed were going to be home in a third of the time As long as we can surf these magma flows well be Lets just pray we dont run into any dead ends or were going to miss those lasers navigator which way Weve got greater flow density on the left Go with the flow beeping Bill where are they headed Looks like she found a space between some tectonic plates somewhere near Hawaii Josh Yeah Theyre closing in on us too fast dont know if can Beck you got it beeping Um stammers We lost them Stick and Beck Whered our power go Josh We were powered by the heat Its stone cold down here Well Look on the bright side At least were not going to boil to death You always look on the bright side Always lets assess Weve got no communications were probably feet down but we might as well be miles Were in an Unobtanium cigar tube with the sonar signature of a rock Weve got just enough power to make the ultrasonics burp but no ones listening on those frequencies anyway and nobody even knows were alive Give me a minute on this one This is hopeless Come on General weve got to be getting close We cant Mr Rat even if they were still alive theres no way they could contact us telephone rings Bdge Skipper Combat relays that our sub has something on the sonar Where do they think Bill put it up on the hydrophone whale sounds Whales sir Theyre a long way off their usual path but thats not uncommon since that What are they calling it Orbital wobble Yeah thats what they call it Well thank you very much Captain but think were done here General this is the captain Stand down from Operations Its whales Its whales Hey General Stick Its whales The ultrasonics Theyre singing to them You gotta find the whales man Alpha Ray this is November Echo six one zero m changing Hold on m seeing those whales now Whoa balls in the water This is neat Those whales are circling something Hold on hold on We have a strong echo here Depth feet Theres something down there Theres definitely something down there told you pulsing the ultrasonics would work Do you ever get tired of being right Yes So whats next for you shower laughs Then back to guess You Deepdish pepperoni pizza green peppers onions extra mushrooms then a shower Mmm and then back to the classroom could use a few good men you know Yeah Unfortunately so could my freshmen geophysics students You know what makes me really really angry Bob Serge Braz Zimsky No ones going to ever know what they did or why they died Unless it all got out somehow Thats unthinkable Yeah chattering cracks knuckles here we go beeping all computers beeping people murmuring Sweet woman It is now emerging that the world owes its survival to the heroism of six remarkable individuals Shuttle Commander Robert Iverson man This extraordinary craft woman French Scientist Dr Serge man was captained by astronaut Dr Bob Iverson man
