thinking maybe baby Sophia didnt die in that crash Maybe she was found and left on someones doorstep No Yes look at the portrait You look exactly like Queen Isabella You could be baby Sophia If its

time Weve gotta go This is serious you know The whole fate of Gardania is at stake Come on you guys Its crazy Whoa Whoa Excuse me My daughter has a declaration about how shell handle things when shes crowned princess in two days Delancy Huh um Uh My brilliant daughter noticed that Gardanias poorer sections are a blight to the otherwise beautiful community Hey To remedy this she will take over

My neighborhood is there It is Delancy is aware of that Those people will move elsewhere How Theyre like me They dont have money They cant just pick up and move If were you d leave this school
