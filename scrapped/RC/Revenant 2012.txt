tenant of the house just made some tea would you like some Yeah that would be great So did you have any strange experiences in the house If youre referring to the house being haunted yes did Did it uh start as soon as you moved in No At first it was great loved the house And my sons school was right down the street was the president of the My husbands work was close by and the yard was great for my son to play in He loved that yard He would spend hours just running around he never got tired So when did things change About two weeks in Drawers and cabinets opened voices At first thought it was neat ve always been fascinated with the idea of ghosts even bought one of those tape recorders was starting to try to communicate with it Did you get anything Not really Some strange sounds and things but no voices or names or anything Thank you But then it got stronger Things started happening more often What kind of things Doors would open and shut on their own Shadows and those sheets People under sheets Youve seen them too Did they ever interact with you in any way got pushed Pushed How was going down toward the bedroom and got pushed from behind Was it Like alike a shove or just a soft push Hard enough to knock me down told my husband about it he didnt believe me was worried about my son didnt want anything to happen to him What did you do told him wanted to move And he just kept saying that was making excuses trying to get him to move back to Colorado But those things that were happening were real know believe you It had this way of alienating me from my husband and son It tormented me but it never showed itself to them So your husband and your son never had any experiences No Well my son had an imaginary friend Hes so creative Your sons imaginary friend Did it have a name Yes it did what was it It was um it was Tom Um so what what happened in the house after you got pushed My husband and started fighting about it all the time That house killed my marriage He even took me in for a psych evaluation psych evaluation So itit never did show itself to your husband No think it purposefully did that to separate us think it liked torturing me think it wanted to kill me Did it do anything that would give you the idea that it wanted to kill you Yes The day of the psych evaluation My husband came home and told me he had enrolled our son in day care because he didnt trust me with him We had a huge fight about it And then he took off And started screaming at the house It was ruining my marriage And then everything got still And the doors slammed shut felt a hand on the back of my head and my face slammed into the floor What happened What did you do dont remember anything else woke up in the hospital to a restraining order My husband thought slammed my head into the floor because of our fight What He got full custody of my son ended up back on the psych ward for three months That house It took my life from me All the more reason for your story to be told think you should leave now Hey Sue m really sorry for everything that you went through You have to get out of there now Dont you understand Its trying to kill you Youre hurting my arm Itll alienate you from everyone and then itll come after you If its showing itself to you its only gonna get stronger You have to get out of there Its going to kill you Hail Mary full of grace The Lord is with thee
