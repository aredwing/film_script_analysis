of another Theres a few debts have to clear up here in Havana My proposition was Mr Colby And mines And in seconds its going to be Very well Another See you onboard ship How about that evening we were discussing That was not part of the bargain Mr Colby m sorry m sorry too The next morning traded the for some travelers checks paid my bills and found out that Berrien was almost what he said he was packed my suitcase and figured that the best way to carry the package was to fasten it to my ribs with some adhesive tape After that boarded the freighter which was to take me to Mexico as planned was still short of breath when she limped out of Havana at a fast eight knots Anna Luz if that was her name and my fat friend in the wheelchair were aboard But nobody seemed especially interested in me except for the silken invitation to trouble who seemed to circle the deck in search of shipboard trophies Raul Thank you You wouldnt like it Spoiled girl too much dough Julie Barnes by name Pittsburgh Steel third generation That gent with her is Raul Cornejo On his way home from law school in the States He stopped by Havana to do a little rumba research with Miss Barnes You specialize in these thumbnail biographies had a drink with the purser this morning What do you have on me Al Colby San Francisco period m Jefferson an independent coffee broker among other things What do you say to a drink Yeah Why not Turns out to be a small world eh Thomas Much too small Would you like me to jump over the side amigo Thats too much to expect Take me to my cabin Who was your friend The name is Berrien He seemed kind of surprised to see you He should be It gave me a jolt to learn that Berrien and this character Jefferson knew each other and apparently hated each others insides But that afternoon had another surprise coming Anna Luz with Jefferson What was her game like the English even better For my heart thy breast is enough For thy liberty my wings are enough Go on Who is that Colby Let him in Shut the door It was very unwise of you to come here Mr Colby do a lot of unwise things You havent lost the package No Youre sure m sure Good but you must be very careful There is a man onboard who would do anything to get it Jefferson How did you know Your face when you saw him m afraid of him Why He is a crook Oh really Do you know something Down in the bar he said the same thing about you How much does she know about this No more than you Then what was she doing talking to him all afternoon Didnt you know He asked me to have a drink and refused How come you took minutes to turn him down That will do Mr Colby Anna Luz is answerable only to me Look this whole thing started out to be a very simple proposition didnt it Like me going down and putting a letter in the corner postoffice box But now it appears somebody else is interested in this thing and you dont bother to tell me about it thought it better She spends all afternoon with this guy you dont bother to tell me about that either What else are you holding out on me Nothing Mr Colby Come to my cabin m gonna turn that package back to you But your Keep it dont care if its times worth My necks worth a lot more to me than that You and your pennyante games Mr Colby you cant do this to me Even if should succeed in evading Jefferson could never get the package through the customs You must help me beg you How hard can you beg What are your terms Half of what the package brings But its sheer robbery You cant be serious Arent No wait Twentyfive percent Fifty percent and ll give you the usual seconds to make up your mind Well its blackmail but have no choice absolutely no choice We are partners in whatever the package brings Share and share alike Put it in writing Bring some paper Anna Luz Al What are you doing out here Waiting for someone Want a taste No thanks Dont be stuffy Its wonderful It makes you feel so dontcareish like wellbuilt men saw you sunbathing this afternoon Even with that bandage You hurt me Raul Help For a while that night watched the ship tunnel a hole in the ocean It had been a good day d made three maybe four bosom enemies rejected a pass from a pretty blond and latched onto a halfinterest in a package that might contain for all know some pages of an old Sears Roebuck catalog had a feeling in the pit of my stomach that there was trouble ahead went to my cabin found that was right found something on the deck a black hairpin decided to parley a hairpin and a hunch into a little action What do you want You have no business here Maybe not What do you got on under that robe said what do you got on under that robe Nothing Lets find out Are you crazy This might be very embarrassing for both of us if m wrong Dont you touch me figured you were dressed Youve just been down searching my cabin Why would go to your cabin You wanted the package If d wanted the package would have taken it a long time ago Maybe you didnt know what it was a long time ago Maybe you just found out about it tonight knew about it days ago All right lets ask Berrien Hes asleep Well well wake him Berrien Turn on the lights Hes dead Go call the Captain was afraid the body would spell trouble when we reached port but the authorities knew about Berriens badheart past They asked Anna Luz a couple of perfunctory questions and let us go on into Oaxaca Berrien had told me to go to the Hotel San Felipe and thats where went found a reservation had been made for me My immediate concern was to investigate the package thoroughly wondered if it could be a diamond eye of an ancient idol or maybe a Spanish treasure map There was one way of finding out But after did didnt know any more than when started Three pieces of parchment with some strange symbols and a disk of carved jade Hello Who All right ll come over Mr Colby How about a drink amigo No thanks Well at least let me introduce a friend He may prove useful to you Captain Bergman Mr Colby Delighted m sure Captain can get you anything you want in town at a price You need something Not now Seor Colby Yes He says that the lady is waiting for you amigo know You want anything to drink No Any food No thanks Maybe later on Thank you very much Is the package safe thought wed agreed not to discuss the package ve come to pay you for it with the you were promised Why should give it to you Because am Mr Berriens daughter Can you prove it cannot prove it Why not Because Because m illegitimate Whats in the package manuscript How many pages was asking you how many pages are in the manuscript Twelve Anything else No nothing Now please accept your money and give it to me No dont think should Because there werent pages and there was something else It was a piece of carved jade And because youre a liar must have it Please ll give you Its all have Still you wont tell me what it is ve told you cannot Well m sorry The answer is still No Can you tell me where it was found No my friend didnt say but this was with it You see Even more remarkable Also of the same era This writing is Zapotec Or rather a mixture of Zapotec and Spanish Dating would say without reservation from the time of the Spanish conquest Can you tell me what it says The Spanish perhaps But it would certainly take an expert or a specialist to decipher the other Well do you know an expert or a specialist You have more of these No this is the only one right here If you would be willing to leave it here No m sorry You see this only partially belongs to me There is a man who should be in Oaxaca today Thomas Berrien Is he the only one There is of course Ulbaldo Navarro He has the largest private collection in Mexico at the moment And where can find him If he is not at his house you will probably find him working at the ruins of Monte Alban or Mitla Mitla whats that see youre not an authority on our ancient civilizations We in Mexico are very proud of them But if youre interested advise to purchase a copy of Old Civilizations of Mexico by the American archeologist Marco Roberts You took your time in getting here Did Where have you been ve been out buying a book Here it is Old Civilizations of Mexico Good idea because youre going to have plenty of leisure time for reading from now on How did you get in here Thats a trade secret Where is the package Package What package Come on now pal Dont stall me Youve got it know because it wasnt in Berriens cabin Did you kill Berrien Now thats a stupid question But it so happens that he was dead when found him Either that or he passed out when you pointed that thing at him If you want to believe that thats perfectly all right by me Come on unload her And be careful with your hands Thanks Did you make anything of it No figured d be able to find somebody who could You did You know should bounce you around a little bit just in case youve got any ideas of trying to take it back But m a softhearted lug Softhearted that is till somebody tries to cross me Adis amigo still didnt know what d inherited from Berrien but it had all the earmarks of something stamped Dynamite Handle with care had to hang on to it long enough to find out what it said and yet if hung too long somebody Anna Luz or Jefferson or maybe the government was bound to snatch it away And the only solution seemed to be a roll of infrared film and a couple of positive copies Bit of sightseeing Mr Colby You seem to be doing some yourself Well did happen to notice you in Valentinos shop and it occurred to me we might be of assistance to one another How am to be frank a bit hardpressed at the moment Certain payments failed to arrive No not a loan my friend havent come to that not yet An exchange Money for services rendered now or later dont need any services rendered now or later Come now no man is sufficient unto himself Says that in the Bible somewhere suppose you are bound for the ruins Now how would you suppose that Every visitor here goes to the ruins And to see them properly youll need a guide ve got one If youre interested in feminine companionship Then ll dig up my own No offense Mr Colby Just a thought But should you need a trustworthy friend in any line of endeavor Captain Bergman at your service Vamonos Pedro went first to the ancient city of Monte Alban climbed the steps of the pyramids walked through the courtyards and the temples marveled at the fact that a cultured people had lived here years before the Christian era looked into doorways where ancient kings and priests had trod could feel the cold wind slide over my back thousand unseen hostile eyes watching me felt like getting rid of the manuscript and running Maybe should while there was still time Thats how those old temples hit me the first time saw them These were literally doorways into the past On my way to my room ran into a couple of other items from the past wondered what they were doing sitting there so close to my door was tempted to question them but didnt had work to do It wasnt the brightest scheme in the world but it was the best thing could think of at the moment Two hundred and seventeen words in the manuscript carved off each symbol with a razor blade and listed them in their correct position in what called a master list Then put a fake number beside the real ones so that only d be able to tell where they really belonged Maybe somebody could put them in their right order again but without the master list it would take a genius with a lot of time on his hands One set put in my shoe for safekeeping and the other in an envelope stuck the master list in with some writing paper in the desk drawer acting on the old Edgar Allan Poe theory that the safest hiding place was the most obvious Are you the seor that sent a message to Seor Navarro Yeah thats right Well his boy says he wont come home until night Okay thank you very much Youre welcome Are you going to stay in your room all day didnt know you cared decided to forgive and forget didnt know it was that dull around here You dont know What about your boyfriend Didnt you hear me said What about your boyfriend Well thats a long story Whatve you got there Its pictures of pretty girls in bathing suits You can do better than that Let me see Thats the second time youve hurt me Thats right ll bet you beat your women When they need it Where are you going Going down to the hotel office to put this in a safe place Then might take a look at the ruins Let me go with you Please All right Yeah they sure like to have the dredging concession around here Why Heres one of their sacrificial wells So See that platform up there For about years the priests used to throw maidens right off the top and theyd drop them in here wouldnt like that Well dont think youd have been in any danger What would you do with a dredgedup maiden Probably strip all the jewelry off her They used to load them down with gold and jade before they gave them the deep six That place is probably loaded with treasure How do you know all this used to watch them jump This is where they played a game sort of like basketball See up along the sides there thats were the people sat Are you really interested in all this Why do you think came here think youre up to something Theyd have two teams and a rubber ball and instead of a basket they used a ring right in the center there saw you go into the nurses cabin just before the old man died That makes it twice you saw me If one of the players scored the others had to give him their clothes bet youd like to know who saw her with today Who thought that would interest you Who was she with At last ve got something you want mystery man Which means youre going to be very nice to me Colby Colby Whats that Colby What do you want d like to talk to you What about Tell that female to beat

warriors used to rip out their victims hearts You seem to know an awful lot about this was a sort of an archeologist once but got disbarred You know theres a man in Oaxaca who can decipher the writings they used to use around here Not Navarro Youre not going to Navarro are you Why not Hes a worse crook than Berrien ever was He would tell you its a recipe for apple strudel or the laundry list of the high priest and you would never even know the difference Yes will the way m going to give it to him How are you going to give it to him Well thats a trade secret like opening hotel doors Hell piece it together no matter what you do Look why dont you sell it to me huh Or come in with me and ll give you half Two days alone with that manuscript and could lead you to To what Why should tell you might cut you in on it Half First d want to know what half is Well back in the Spaniards put a torch to every native manuscript they could lay their hands on that is except four codices Now these are writings in which Spanish letters are used to express native symbols Now three of them have been found Heres more tourists Come on ll take you over to Mitla This is the burying place of the Zapotecan kings and priests It was a city in itself and inhabited right up to the time of the conquistadores And heres the church the Spaniards built when they arrived Right on the ruins of a Zapotecan temple What happened to the Zapotecs Nobody knows But because of these previous wars they had built long tunnels underground Then when they were defeated this last time they took to these tunnels sealing themselves up in a mass sacrifice leaving everything behind them their lives their temples their gods their treasures Now this fourth codice is the Book of the Tiger Priests dozen pages listing the hiding places of the treasure the Spaniards never found How many pages Twelve You ought to know For years nobody ever heard of them until some fool in Cuba wrote the museum in Oaxaca saying that hed come across a strange parchment and a piece of carved jade which might interest them While the museum was fooling around trying to make up its mind Berrien got wind of it and so did but too late The Cuban was sorry but hed already sold it for Well that cinched it for me because knew right then that there was only one manuscript that Berrien would give that much money for So took out after him followed him aboard the Cinco de Mayo and the rest you know Yeah the rest know So you killed him You asked me that question yesterday You still havent told me what its worth More that you and could count in years million million nobody knows how much Gold and silver and jade Make a deal with me Colby Half and m your man can translate that manuscript and can get the stuff out of the country How about it ll think it over carefully The thing didnt really hit me until got back to the hotel The Book of the Tiger Priests Twelve pages of parchment suddenly bobbing up after years Theyd

like to have translated would be glad to look at it Now theres only one thing ll have to tell you You wont know what it says What do you mean dont have the original manuscript just have the photographs of the words out of order Impossible Without knowing the sentence structure nobody could make a translation You could tell me what each word meant without seeing the whole sentence couldnt

you one for a few pesos Yes know but d still like to have this one translated Now how long would it take you to do it By tomorrow evening And how much would you charge Puzzles are another of my interests But perhaps you could do one thing need some dollars to cover the cost of something m buying in the States It would save me a trip to the capital if you could sell me some How many would you need The bill will be close to dont carry that many American dollars with me No travelers checks Yes do have those bring you the pesos All right hope you know what youre doing with Navarro Hes nobodys

jail you And finally you have forced your way into this house like a common felon could shoot you now See how foolish you are seor ll tell you how foolish am dont think for a minute that youd turn me or the manuscript over to the government cause you want it for yourselves ll tell you something else You cant afford to have a dead stranger lying around this place somebody whose travelers checks have already been recorded as being sold to you And as for that gun you say youre carrying dont believe you Seor Colby think youd better leave now Well seem to be slightly outnumbered at the moment

watch dogs And look at this Worth in any museum Come on lets get it out of here Tacho Well guess this just about finishes it Youre so right smart guy It does Adis amigo At first there was blackness blackness of a grave with the weight of the entire earth on my chest And then came light gray foglike streamers of light that gave me glimpses of a world without sense without time Berrien was there laughing that fat laugh of his and Julie laughing and Anna Luz Was she trying to doublecross me Navarro what was his game And Bergman always repulsive And Jefferson who had finally put it over on smart me And the mask what did the mask have to do with it all You are all right You are in Seor Navarros house He asked you to stay here until you recovered Your wound is not bad but you bled a lot and you had several transfusions That mask you were carrying deflected two of the bullets Wheres Jefferson We do not know All we know is that he went back to Tachos house and could not start the car After that he disappeared You must have made plans to take the treasure out of the country The only plans had were to turn the treasure over to the museum for the reward Seor if you can help us in any way to recover the treasure can assure you Mexico will be grateful Now go back to sleep will stay with you What are you doing here ve been helping know what you think of me but that doesnt matter now After that awful afternoon wanted to get even with you But didnt want you to get shot Whats that gave a blood transfusion Lf you need anything just ring that bell Come back here Sit down Julie know

him to marry Anna Luz But she doesnt want to marry him and he doesnt want to marry her And do want to marry him And he wants to marry me think But down here they have to do what his father says and its all so mixed up and hopeless Maybe it isnt so hopeless ll see about your lunch We are quite sure hes still around here He must know the police are watching all the roads Who notified the police My father did would have done anything it is true to have made the discovery And now Seor Navarro would give anything to have the treasure where it really belongs In the National Museum Well m glad to hear that cause youre going to have to give quite a lot What Two things The discovery reward and Anna Luzs freedom The reward is paid by the government and do not know what you mean by her freedom She knows that you want her to marry your son and shell do it because she feels that she owes it to you Anna Luz is my home and my son so hateful to you No not hateful at all But its true that do not want
