SpankingFrankly was spanking And it was a fuckingtraumatizing event because havent been able to use a publicrestroom since that day Me neither swear to God Gordos got some issuesHes got some issues And lets not forget the great thing that did come from that daywas we said Enough Thats the day we started ourown business and said goodbye to shithead bosses So Hear hear really admire you guystaking a chance like that Leon here works at a bankWhat bank did you say it was Price Trust No shit really Talk about shithead bossesNow thats gotta be a trip Whats he like to work for Oh you know Hes okay Really Oh come on Well hes a hes just a fucking shitheadWhat can tell you So what do you doover there at Price m the in chargeof corporate loans Wow We havent met anyoneof your level before Wait so that meansits you and then the Give that man a Nobel PrizeWell done Genius Yes thats right Heres where a littleresearch comes in handy Corporate banks give out titles like calendars Its a small lie but nowwere sure hes playing Then maybe you can helpexplain to us whats so difficult about getting a corporate loan Well normally nothing But a tech firm right now People are really scared People are scaredbecause they lack vision Present companyexcluded of course bank does need to knowwhere its moneys gonna come from That is true We know wherewere getting our money back from But therein lies our Catch dont follow Well Jake come on No its all right Leon here is oneof the good guys Right Now what m gonna tell you is incomplete confidence It does not leavethis fucking table Sure Fine You know how the dot commersdid what they did right In what way How they made their money Essentially they startwith an idea shop it around townraise a little capital and then sold itto a bigger company like a Microsoft or an Oracle oran Intel You know whatever Thats half right there The beauty of it was they sold it before thething was even real So youve got the bigger company alreadyset up to buy the thing They just want tosee that it works So these guys go out get some startupcapital make it work and then sell for five orsix times the initial loan Theyre delicious But you need a letter of intent Exactly And thats our Catch We cant really go outand talk about it because if its publicpotentially we start a bidding war and thats considered a breach ofetiquette Kills the deal However we wait too long and were notconsidered hot anymore And you have this letter of intent Yes we do Were applying the dot com modelto a different product Yeah But the dot coms failed Yeah but thats only No with all due respect It Thats going to bea really tough sell mean you guys havea real battle on your hands Thats bullshit Lupus Look sorry Mr Ashby didnt mean anythingBut just dont think you can argue with thesuccess of the business model It was really anoverextension of the model to what turned out to bea limited consumer demand that caused thedot com collapse Now applied to a proper productwith a solid consumer base the model still holds up He may be right Let me be straightwith you all right Were this close to cutting somebody in onthe action if theyd be willing to help We just need to findsomebody with some balls Shall we order another round Yeah Lupus nice save in therem very impressed Poor bastard neverknew what hit him Jesus Christ almostfelt sorry for the guy gotta go work
