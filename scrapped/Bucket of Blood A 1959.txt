 

                        I WILL TALK TO YOU OF ART, [ Saxophone ] FOR THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT, FOR THERE IS NOTHING ELSE. LIFE IS AN OBSCURE HOBO, BUMMING A RIDE ON THE OMNIBUS OF ART. BURN GAS BUGGIES... AND WHIP YOUR SOUR CREAM OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND HOPE, AND GO AHEAD AND SLEEP YOUR BLOODY HEADS OFF. CREATION IS. ALL ELSE IS NOT. WHAT IS NOT CREATION IS GRAHAM CRACKERS. LET IT ALL CRUMBLE TO FEED THE CREATOR. THE ARTIST IS. ALL OTHERS ARE NOT. A CANVAS IS A CANVAS OR A PAINTING. A ROCK IS A ROCK OR A STATUE. A SOUND IS A SOUND OR IS MUSIC. [ Saxophone ] A CREATURE IS A CREATURE OR AN ARTIST. [ Jazz ] WHERE ARE JOHN, JOE, JAKE, JIM, JERK ? DEAD. DEAD. DEAD. THEY WERE NOT BORN. BEFORE THEY WERE BORN, THEY WERE NOT BORN. WHERE ARE LEONARDO, REMBRANDT, LUDWIG ? ALIVE. ALIVE. ALIVE. THEY WERE BORN. BRING ON THE MULTITUDE WITH A MULTITUDE OF FISHES. FEED THEM TO THE FISHES FOR LIVER OIL... TO NOURISH THE ARTIST. STRETCH THEIR SKINS UPON AN EASEL... TO GIVE HIM CANVAS. CRUSH THEIR BONES INTO A PASTE... THAT HE MIGHT MOLD THEM. LET THEM DIE. AND BY THEIR MISERABLE DEATHS... BECOME THE CLAY WITHIN HIS HANDS... THAT HE MIGHT FORM AN ASHTRAY OR AN ARK. FOR ALL THAT IS COMES THROUGH THE EYE OF THE ARTIST. THE REST ARE BLIND FISH SWIMMING IN THE CAVE OF ALONENESS. SWIM ON, YOU MAUDLIN, MUDDLING, MADDENED FOOLS. AND DREAM THAT ONE BRIGHT AND SUNNY NIGHT, SOME ARTIST WILL BAIT A HOOK AND LET YOU BITE UPON IT. BITE HARD AND DIE. IN HIS STOMACH, YOU ARE VERY CLOSE TO IMMORTALITY. WALTER ? WALTER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ? I WAS LOOKING AT CARLA'S PICTURE. DO I PAY YOU TO LOOK AT PICTURES ? NOW GET TO WORK. I WAS JUST LOOKIN'. THERE ARE EMPTY CUPS ALL OVER THE PLACE. CLEAR THEM OUT. YOU SHOULDN'T BE SO ROUGH ON HIM, LEONARD. WHAT DO YOU SAY, WALTER ? HI. [ Jazz ] I THINK I'LL CUT. THERE'S THE MAN. HOW YOU MAKIN' IT ? FINE, MAN. HOW ABOUT YOU ? GOOD ENOUGH. [ Phone Dings ] [ Phone Rings ] VALDEZ. VICE. LACROIX CHECKIN' IN. LOU TOOK OVER A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO. ANYTHING NEW AT THE DOOR ? NOTHING YOU CAN POUND NAILS IN. A COUPLE OF HUSTLERS. ONE OF THEM IS SHORT, FAT, BRUNETTE. NAME'S SKINNY. THE OTHER ONE WAS SHORT ALSO. SHE WAS BLEACHED AND SKINNY. NAME OF FAT. PROBABLY. I DIDN'T GET IT. THEY DIDN'T GIVE ANY PITCHES, THOUGH. GUESS YOU CAN KEEP AN EYE ON 'EM. OKAY. ANY HEADS ? WELL, JERRY SACHS LOOKED LIKE HE WAS STRAIGHT. I'M SURE HE'S ON IT, ANYWAY. I DIDN'T SEE ANY PUSHERS AROUND THE PLACE. LOU SAID HE'D CHECK OUT JERRY AND SOUND HIM OUT IF HE GETS ANY HIGHER. I GUESS THAT'S ABOUT IT. OKAY, ART. GO ON HOME AND GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP, YOU FINK. OKAY. SO LONG, PAUL. EVERYONE LISTENED TO MY NEW POEM, BUT DO YOU THINK THEY REALLY HEARD IT ? I HEARD IT, MR. BROCK. THANK YOU, WALTER. I'M SURE YOU DID. "BRING ON THE MULTITUDE WITH A MULTITUDE OF FISHES. FEED THEM TO THE FISHES FOR LIVER OIL TO NOURISH THE ARTIST." THAT WAS WORD FOR WORD. IS IT ? I'D FORGOTTEN. YOU DON'T REMEMBER YOUR OWN POEM ? I REFUSE TO SAY ANYTHING TWICE. REPETITION IS DEATH. I DON'T GET IT. WHEN YOU REPEAT SOMETHING, YOU ARE RELIVING A MOMENT, WASTING IT, SEVERING IT FROM THE OTHER END OF YOUR LIFE. I BELIEVE ONLY IN NEW IMPRESSIONS, NEW STIMULI, NEW LIFE. I THOUGHT YOU BELIEVED THAT LIFE IS AN OBSCURE HOBO, BUMMING A RIDE ON THE-- I DO BELIEVE THAT, WALTER, BUT I ALSO BELIEVE CREATIVE LIVING. TO BE UNCREATIVE, YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE IN YOUR GRAVE, OR IN THE ARMY. THEY TRIED TO DRAFT ME ONCE. I COULDN'T PASS THE TEST. [ Coughs ] WALTER, LEONARD'S LOOKING AT YOU. HE'S JUST ABOUT GONE. WALTER HAS A CLEAR MIND. ONE DAY, SOMETHING WILL ENTER IT, FEEL LONELY AND LEAVE AGAIN. TOO MUCH. YES, CATS, YES. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW BEATNIKS LIVE, WILLIAM AND ME WILL SHOW YOU. WE'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO SOME WILD ONES. YOU MAY EVEN DISCOVER AN ARTIST OF YOUR OWN. AND HOW MUCH IS THA GOING TO COST US ? WHAT COST ? A COUPLE OF BUCKS. YOU WANNA MEET SOME BEATNIKS, DON'T YOU ? I'M JUST CRAZY ABOUT THE ARTISTS. ALL THAT IS COMES THROUGH THE EYE OF THE ARTIST. THE REST ARE JUST BLIND FISH SWIMMING IN THE CAVE OF ALONENESS. OH, YOU MUST BE AN ARTIST. AND WORKING AS A BUSBOY TOO. FEED HIM THAT HE WILL BE SATISFIED. THE ARTIST IS. ALL OTHERS ARE NOT. THAT'S MOST INTRIGUING. ARE YOU A PAINTER ? WELL, NO. I WORK-- I'M WORKING ON SOMETHING. IT'S NOT READY YET. WHAT IS IT, MAN ? FINGER PAINTING ? DRAW ME A PICTURE OF A HOUSE, WALTER. MAKE SOME SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE CHIMNEY. I AM WORKING ON SOMETHING. I'LL SHOW YOU SOON. WALTER.

DID YOU SEE FRANKIE TONIGHT WHEN YOU WENT OUT ? I DIDN'T SEE HIM AT ALL. IF YOU DO, TELL HIM I'VE GOT A NICE PIECE OF HALIBUT FOR HIM. TELL HIM THAT ? I MEAN, DO YOU THINK HE'LL UNDERSTAND ? HE'S ONLY A CAT. GOOD NIGHT, WALTER. [ Cat Meowing ] [ Cat Meowing ] FRANKIE ? A CANVAS IS A CANVAS OR A PAINTING. A ROCK IS A ROCK OR A STATUE. A SOUND IS A SOUND, OR IT'S MUSIC. COME ON. BE A NOSE. BE A NOSE. [ Cat Meowing ] [ Cat Meowing ] [ Cat Meowing ] FRANKIE, SHUT UP ! [ Cat Meows ] OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER, FRANKIE ? HOW'D YOU GET YOURSELF STUCK IN A WALL ? [ Cat Meows ] WAIT A MINUTE. I'LL GET YOU OUT. [ Meow ] [ Cat Squeals ] FRANKIE ? FRANKIE ? YOU ALL RIGHT, FRANKIE ? OH, FRANKIE. OH, FRANKIE. OH, FRANKIE. I'M SORRY. POOR MRS. SWICKARD. SHE HAD A NICE FRESH PIECE OF HALIBUT FOR YOU. I'LL GIVE YOU TO HER IN THE MORNING. REPETITION IS DEATH, FRANKIE. [ Sobbing ] [ Maxwell's Voice ] LET THEM DIE. AND BY THEIR MISERABLE DEATHS... BECOME THE CLAY WITHIN HIS HANDS... THAT HE MIGHT FORM AN ASHTRAY OR AN ARK. PRAY THAT YOU MIGHT BE HIS DIADEM, GOLD, GLORY, PAINT, CLAY, THAT HE MIGHT TAKE YOU IN HIS MAGIC HANDS... AND WRING FROM YOUR MARROW WONDERS. WHERE ARE JOHN, JOE, JIM, JERK ? DEAD. DEAD. DEAD. HI, CARLA. WELL, WALTER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE SO EARLY ? I'VE BROUGHT SOMETHING. I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT. TAKE THAT STUFF TO THE LAUNDROMAT, WALTER. HUH ? DON'T MIND HIM. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT ? IT'S A THING I MADE. WALTER. YOU LIKE IT ? WHAT'S HE GOT ? COME LOOK AT THIS, LEONARD.

I'LL PUT IT IN THE CORNER OF THE ALCOVE. IF IT SELLS, WE'LL SPLIT 50-50, OKAY ? SURE. DOES THIS MEAN I'M AN ARTIST ? MAYBE SO, IF YOU CAN DO OTHER THINGS AS WELL. ALL THAT IS COMES THROUGH THE EYE OF THE ARTIST. YEAH, YOU'RE A REAL ARTIST NOW. NOW GO IN BACK AND SCRUB DOWN THOSE GARBAGE CANS. MARCH NOW. YOU REALLY LIKE IT ? WE LIKE IT. NOW GO ON. [ Saxophone ] DID YOU SEE MY CAT ? WHAT'S THE MATTER, YOU LOSE HIM ? HOW DO YOU LIKE MY CAT ? YOU MADE THIS THING, MAN ? UH-HUH. IT'S CRAZY. CRAZY. YOU WANNA BUY IT ? WHO ME, MAN ? I'M TAPPED. HE LIKES MY CAT. GET TO WORK. HEY, HEY, WALTER. COME HERE A MINUTE. HEY, CONGRATULATIONS, MAN. WALTER, YOU'RE FAMOUS. I SAW YOUR CAT. DID YOU LIKE IT, MR. BROCK ? YOU MAY CALL ME MAXWELL. HOW'D YOU DO IT, WALTER ? OH, I JUST TOOK SOME CLAY AND FIXED IT UP. [ Laughs ] ATTENTION. ATTENTION, EVERYONE. AS YOU PASSED THROUGH THESE YELLOW PORTALS, I'M SURE YOU NOTICED ON YOUR RIGHT A SMALL CLAY FIGURE... AND ASSUMED THIS TRANSFIXED EFFIGY... TO BE THE WORK OF A MASTER SCULPTOR. AND INDEED, SO IT IS. THAT MASTER SCULPTOR IS IN OUR MIDST. HE IS NONE OTHER THAN WALTER PAISLEY, OUR VERY OWN BUSBOY, WHOSE HANDS OF GENIUS HAVE BEEN CARRYING AWAY... THE EMPTY CUPS OF YOUR FRUSTRATIONS. MARK WELL THIS LAD. HIS IS THE SILENT VOICE OF CREATION. WITHIN THE DARK, RICH SOIL OF HUMILITY, HE BLOSSOMS AS THE HOPE OF OUR NEARLY STERILE CENTURY. BEAUTIFUL, MAXWELL. BRING ME AN ESPRESSO, WALTER. MAXWELL, REALLY BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. MAN, YOU ARE IN. OH, WALTER, YOU'RE WONDERFUL. WONDERFUL ! [ All Talking At Once ] LISTEN, MAN. YOU GOT A PEN ?

I WAS JUST TELLING WALTER THE TRUTH. A MAN WANTED TO PAY ME ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE CAT. IN FACT, HE'S TAKING IT HOME TO SHOW TO HIS WIFE. PROVES THAT I UNDERESTIMATED WALTER'S ABILITY. HIS WORK HAS ENORMOUS REALISM. YOU CAN HARDLY TELL IT FROM THE REAL THING. BOY, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A REAL PUT-DOWN. GET OFF WALTER'S BACK, LEONARD. AM I ON HIS BACK ? YOU'RE NOT VERY FUNNY.

IT'S HIDEOUS, AND IT'S ELOQUENT. IT EXPRESSES MODERN MAN IN ALL HIS SELF-PITY. HOW DID YOU EVER FIND THAT IN YOURSELF, WALTER ? WELL, IT WASN'T EASY. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU ? NOTHING. NOTHING AT ALL. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE SO SQUEAMISH. WHAT'S YOUR OPINION, LEONARD ? DON'T ASK ME. OH, COME ON. EVEN YOU MUST SEE ITS VALUE.

WHY NOT ? I'LL TELL YOU, BUT YOU COVER IT UP AGAIN, PLEASE, HUH ? PLEASE ! THANK YOU. WHAT IS ALL THIS NONSENSE ? WHY DO YOU WANT TO HIDE IT ? WELL, I'VE BEEN THINKING. I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH TALENT WALTER ACTUALLY HAD. IT WOULD BE WRONG TO SHOW HIS PIECES ONE AT A TIME. DEAD WRONG. YOU'RE RIGHT. HE SHOULD BUILD A COLLECTION FIRST. YES. THAT'S THE IDEA. MAYBE WHEN IT'S BIG ENOUGH, WE CAN HAVE A SHOW. A SHOW ? JUST FOR ME ? NO ! NOT EXACTLY. I MEAN, IT WOULD TAKE YEARS AND YEARS-- IT'S GETTING HOT AGAIN. IT WOULD TAKE YOU YEARS TO MAKE THAT MANY STATUES, BUT YOUR WORK WOULD BE FEATURED. IT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA, WALTER. IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GAIN RECOGNITION. THE BIG ART CRITICS AND DEALERS WILL BE THERE. IT'LL BE AN EVENT. YES, THEN WE COULD UNLOAD AND SELL THIS STUFF FOR A LOT MORE. BUT THE SHOW, HOW SOON COULD WE GO ? DON'T RUSH THINGS. IT TAKES TIME.

I DON'T WANT YOU TO MAKE ANY MORE STATUES. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ? NO MORE STATUES. WELL, WHY NOT ? I GOTTA MAKE STATUES, LEONARD. YOU HEARD BROCK. THEY WANT ME TO MAKE THEM. IF I STOP MAKIN' THEM, I'LL JUST BE A BUSBOY AGAIN. BROCK. HE'S BEHIND ALL OF THIS WITH HIS STUPID, BITTER POETRY. LISTEN. YOU'VE GOT TO STOP AND RIGHT AWAY. I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL RESPONSIBLE. WHY ? WHAT DID YOU DO ? NEVER MIND. WALTER, I'VE DECIDED TO HAVE THAT SHOW FOR YOU RIGHT AWAY. YES. WHEN CARLA COMES, WE'LL HAVE HER WORK UP SOME NICE INVITATIONS. WE'LL HAVE THEM PRINTED UP. WE'LL INVITE THE CRITICS AND THE ART COLLECTORS. WE'LL TELL THEM. WELL, I DON'T SEE WHY WE CAN'T GO. MR. LEONARD De SANTIS IS AFRAID TO HAVE YOU COME. YOU, WHO BUY HIS COFFEE AND LURE HIS TOURISTS. YOU, WHO ARE THE HEART AND SOUL AND MEAT OF THE YELLOW DOOR. HE'S SLIGHTED YOU. DID YOU GET AN INVITATION ? I DID NOT. BUT I'M GOING ANYWAY. NOT TO DRINK HIS CHAMPAGNE, BUT TO SEE WALTER'S TRIUMPH. AFTER THAT, WE GO NO MORE. HI, MAXWELL. I WON'T SAY, "GOOD LUCK," WALTER. WHY NOT ? IT WOULD IMPLY THAT YOU COULD NOT SUCCEED ON YOUR ABILITY ALONE. YOU LOOK SO HANDSOME. I DO ? SO DO YOU. I MEAN, YOU LOOK SO PRETTY. THANK YOU. ARE YOU READY ? WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME. I KNOW, BUT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU. OKAY. WE CAN GO NOW IF YOU LIKE. BYE. LATER, MAN, LATER. SWING. MAN, WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE WALTER WANTS TO GET HER ALONE ? DO YOU SUPPOSE HE COULD BE PHYSICALLY ATTRACTED TO HER ? NO, MAN. HE AIN'T THE TYPE. HE DON'T GET ENOUGH VITAMIN "E." MAXWELL GAVE HIM A BOTTLE OF WHEAT GERM OIL ONCE. MAYBE HE JUST STARTED TAKING IT. WHAT DID YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT, WALTER ? WELL, WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE DO YOU LIKE, CARLA ? OH, THINKING PEOPLE. ARTISTIC PEOPLE, I GUESS. YOU THINK I'M ARTISTIC ? OF COURSE I DO. THAT MEANS YOU LIKE ME. I LIKE YOU VERY MUCH, WALTER. I THOUGHT YOU DID, ON ACCOUNT HOW YOU KISSED ME THE OTHER NIGHT. OH, THAT WAS FOR YOUR SCULPTURE OF THE GIRL. YOUR "NUDE IN THE CHAIR." CARLA, I'VE BEEN ALONE FOR A LONG TIME, AND I KNOW YOU BEEN ALONE 'CAUSE YOU NEVER SEEM TO GO OUT WITH ANYBODY, EVEN THOUGH LEONARD'S ALWAYS ASKING YOU TO GO OUT WITH HIM. AND I JUST-- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY ? CARLA, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE STATUES ANYMORE. I WANNA GET MARRIED... TO YOU. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS, WALTER ? OH, FOR-- FOR A LONG TIME. EVER SINCE YOU FIRST CAME TO WORK AT THE CLUB. YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS EVER NICE TO ME. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU LOVED ME UNTIL YOU KISSED ME. WALTER, I DO LIKE YOU, AND I DID KISS YOU, BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE OF YOUR WORK. THERE'S MORE TO BEING IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE THAN JUST THAT. YOU MEAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME ? I'M AFRAID THAT'S WHAT I MEAN. BUT-- BUT YOU GOTTA LOVE ME. WHY DO YOU THINK I MADE THAT STATUE OF ALICE ? WALTER, I'M SORRY, BUT-- YOU JUST CAN'T BE SORRY. I WANNA MARRY YOU. NOW, CALM DOWN, WALTER, AND LET'S GO IN THERE, AND THEN MAYBE WHEN THE SHOW'S OVER, WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT SOME MORE. WELL, I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT. I GET IT. I SEE THE WHOLE THING NOW. NOBODY KNOWS THAT WALTER PAISLEY IS BORN. CARLA, WILL YOU DO ONE FAVOR FOR ME ? JUST ABOUT ANYTHING, WALTER. WOULD YOU LET ME MAKE A STATUE OF YOU ? WOULD YOU REALLY LIKE TO ? THAT WOULD MAKE ME VERY HAPPY. OKAY. TONIGHT. I'LL MAKE A STATUE OF YOU TONIGHT, OKAY ? COME ON. WALTER ? NO, THANKS. THIS COULD BRING ABOUT A RETURN TO REALISM. YES, A ONE-MAN RETURN. WE HAVE MANY ARTISTS ABOUT BUT NO CRAFTSMEN. THIS MAN KNOWS HIS ANATOMY. I'D GIVE 1,500 FOR THIS. AFTER YOU READ MY REVIEW, IT'LL PROBABLY COST YOU FIVE THOUSAND. SO, WHAT'S THE TROUBLE ? WHY SHOULD YOU BE SO DEPRESSED ? HAVE YOU HEARD THE THINGS THEY'RE SAYING ? YOU CAN MAKE 25,000 ON THESE PIECES ALONE. I THOUGHT YOU PUT MONEY DOWN. I DO, BUT 25 THOU ? LEAVE ME ALONE. OUT ! MAN, WE HAVE COME TO MAKE THE SCENE. HOW ABOUT SOME CAPPUCCINO, MAN ? WE GOT THE BREAD. WE'RE NOT OPEN FOR BUSINESS. THIS IS AN ART EXHIBIT. NO BUMS. GET OUT ! THAT ART IS A BUM, MAN. YEAH, AND HE'S SOBER. THAT'S HIS PROBLEM. ALL RIGHT, MAN. WE'LL WAIT OUTSIDE. YEAH, YOU WAIT OUTSIDE. WHERE YOU GOIN', CARLA ? WHAT'S THE MATTER ? WALTER, THERE'S A BODY INSIDE THAT STATUE. OH. OH, THAT'S ALICE. IT'S ALL RIGHT, CARLA. MAXWELL SAYS IT'S ALL RIGHT. "LET THEM BECOME CLAY IN HIS HANDS THAT HE MIGHT MOLD THEM." WALTER, YOU STAY AWAY FROM ME. DON'T YOU SEE, CARLA ? I MADE THEM IMMORTAL. DON'T YOU SEE ? I CAN DO THE SAME FOR YOU. [ Screams ] CALL VALDEZ. HAVE HIM SEND ME SOME CARS. I'M GOING AFTER PAISLEY. I'M GOING WITH YOU. HEY, MAN, WHAT IS THE SCORE ? WALTER PAISLEY'S A MURDERER. MAN, I SAW HIM CHASING CARLA DOWN THE STREET. [ Lou's Voice ] WALTER. WHAT WAS THAT ? NOBODY KNOWS I'M HERE. WALTER. NO. HE COULDN'T KNOW. THEY'RE DEAD. HOW COULD THEY KNOW ? DID YOU SEE HIM ? [ Alice's Voice ] HE'S HIDING AROUND HERE SOMEPLACE. [ Lou's Voice ] HE CAN'T HIDE JUST BECAUSE WE'RE IN CLAY AND HE ISN'T. [ Alice's Voice ] WALTER, GO HOME. [ Lou's Voice ] HE WON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO. [ Alice's Voice ] WALTER, GO HOME. WHERE IS HE ? [ Cat Screeches ] WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU ? [ Lou's Voice ] WALTER. WALTER. WE'LL FIND HIM. [ Alice's Voice ] WE'LL HAVE HIM SOON, LOU. [ Lou's Voice ] WE'LL TEACH HIM HE CAN'T MURDER US... AND GET AWAY WITH IT, WON'T WE ? [ Lou's Voice ] WALTER. [ Lou's Voice ] WALTER. WHAT YOU GONNA DO NOW, WALTER ? I'LL HIDE WHERE THEY'LL NEVER FIND ME. THERE'S HIS ROOM. HE'S GONE CRAZY. PAISLEY ! PAISLEY, OPEN UP ! PAISLEY ! [ Matthew ] I SUPPOSE HE WOULD HAVE CALLED IT "HANGING MAN." HIS GREATEST WORK.
