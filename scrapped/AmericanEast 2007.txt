 

                        I know what I have to do today, Maryam. Homeland Security officials say the current high alert is directly related to the discovery last night of homemade explosives at a warehouse in Los Angeles owned by a Muslim male The location of the warehouse and the identity of the owner have not yet been disclosed by the Department, but unnamed sources in Homeland Security - Why am I a Muslim? - What? Why did you have to name me Mohammed? I named you after our own prophet. And you're Muslim because I am Muslim. Everyone at schooI is Jewish or Christian. All the same. All believe in one God. What if I wasn't born Muslim? It is your journey, habibi You have a great heart, just like your mother. Bless her souI in heaven. Can we get a Christmas tree? Mohammed, we have to get there. Walk fast. Sabir. There. Mohammed, Sabir's here. Mohammed? Mohammed. Mohammed. Mohammed. Hammo. Mohammed. Mohammed! I have a possible 10-107 in progress. Mohammed! Mohammed. - Sorry, ma'am. I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'm really sorry. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. Halt. FederaI agents. - I'm looking for my son. - Stay calm. All right, get him up. Get him up. - Sir, I'm looking for my son. - Come on. Come with us. Come on, let's go. I was looking for my son. I didn't do anything. Where are you taking me, sir? Mr. Marzoke, I'm Agent Stevens, FBI. FBI? Where is my son? Look, your son is safe in the other room. Why were you running around the airport yelling, sir? I was looking for my son. Do you read the papers, sir? You realize we're on high alert? I thought I lost him. What is your business at the airport today? I'm picking up my cousin. - And what's his business in the US? - No business, just personaI. We did a search of your vehicle, Mr. Marzoke. We found all of these items. Could you identify them, please? Well, I listen and I read the Quran. Is that a crime now? The Quran. These receipts... What are these? Money transfer. Donations. Donations. I see. Donations to the Sharia Foundation in Egypt. Why do you make donations to the Sharia Foundation? Sir, I'm a Muslim. One of the five pillars of Islam is to give zakat I don't know if you know about zakat It's an Islamic law. When was the last time you were at the Muhammad Ali Mosque? - Muhammad Ali? - Yes. BeautifuI place. Alabaster, the tall minarets, the view from the top, the pyramids. - You've been there? - Last month. You have a very rich culture, Mr. Marzoke. Now imagine if some fundamentalist Christian nut jobs from the US flew a jet passenger plane into the Muhammad Ali Mosque or another one of your renowned monuments, killing thousands of innocent Egyptians. I'm sure that you'd be busting every infideI stupid enough to go around screaming English in the Cairo airport, wouldn't you? Let me give you a word of advice. You be very mindfuI of how you act and speak in public. When we're under high alert, people get trigger-happy. You got it? It's okay, Mohammed. - Are you all right? - Yeah, it was just a big mistake. A big mistake. - You hungry, Sabir? - Later, later. I want you to trace these transfers. Where he sent them from, who he sent them to. Get me bank statements, e- mails, library accounts, subscriptions, postaI records. The whole nine yards. Piece of shit. God, I hate this dump. Can I help you, sir? I told this asshole 100 times, no sauce on my falafeI. I'm supposed to ask you to not use words like that in here, sir. This is stupid. Abdulla, please make the gentleman another falafeI. No sauce this time. Are you serious? - Leila. - What's up, Fikry? It's hot, man. Air conditioner working? Yeah, sure. It just makes that noise to mess with you. Smartass. - Fikry. - Mustafa. Next time, Pops, if you're gonna punch in late, just give me a call, okay? It's been a rough day. Don't start with me, okay, please? - Where are you going? - I have a life, too, remember? - Okay, don't forget to be home early... - I know. It's a speciaI night. I know. Be home early for dinner. Hey, what's up? Let's get out of here. - Mustafa. - Fikry. What's wrong? I get this feeling sometimes like I'm going to explode. Don't do that. We've had enough explosions. Abdulla, Sam is coming by later. Have his coffee and baklava ready for him. - Again? For free? - Just have it ready. You know, that guy never pays for anything, never! He thinks I work for him. Oh! It is hotter than hell. What's up, Fiky Frik, Big M? Abdulla in the house. Turn on the TV. You seen this? I want to show what these bastards are doing now. Despite repeated requests, American authorities have not made available any evidence of explosives or weapons See, that's what I'm talking about. You see that? You know, they cook all this stuff up. All this heightened-state-of-alert bullshit. It's all bullshit, red, green, fuchsia. I mean, they just want people scared shitless of people like us. Murad, you see a conspiracy in everything, man. Mustafa, you tell him. I've tried. Actually, I got arrested today at the airport. - What? - What happened? Nothing. A mistake. I'll tell you later. A mistake? That's some serious shit, M. I mean, they can make your life hell in this country if they get you on one of their lists. They will lock your ass up in one of those ships off the coast in internationaI waters and they will torture your ass untiI you sign a confession. Murad, I got bigger problems than torture ships, Murad. Keeping this place afloat, that's my torture. Maybe this place float if you don't give away so much free food, huh? Thank you, Abdulla. He's right. I need to make money, reaI money. Why you need money so badly all of a sudden? Because I would love to open a new restaurant, a reaI restaurant, with reaI Mideastern food, like back home. There is a place on Washington I like. That's gonna cost some serious G, M. So? Why not? Maybe I'll get a partner. This is America. Maybe I'll partner with someone like Sam. - Sam the Jew? - So? So? Sam the Sephardic fucking Jew. Murad, business is business. Fikry here is Christian. You're doing business with him. - He's not a land grabber. - What's left for an Iraqi Christian to grab? Murad, Sam is Jewish, but that doesn't make him a Zionist. I trust him and he's a good businessman. That's what I need. - You asked him already? - Yeah, he's researching the numbers. Sure, sure, he's researching the numbers. Of course he is. He's gonna research those numbers, he's gonna go behind your back, he's gonna buy that building, he's gonna jack your idea. I'm telling you, he will not partner with a Muslim. You feeling me? You're gonna end up being his employee bitch. If you don't mind, guys, I've had enough of "It's hard being a Muslim" for one day. I need to change, and there is an important visitor coming by later. So be nice to him. More important than us? Easy on the sauce, okay? Everybody complains. Just easy on the sauce. The ongoing investigation into what is now being referred to as a terrorist arms depot in Los Angeles has netted severaI suspects and authorities say arrests are imminent Some of the explosive materials have now been identified as being both Iraqi and US military in origin Taxi! - Hi. - Yeah, okay. Get in, lady. - Hello. - Hello. - To what do I owe this surprise? - I'm free untiI evening rehearsaI. Thought I'd give you a lift to your appointment. Oh, well, I guess it pays to sleep with a cab driver after all, especially one with a seven-episode deaI on a new series. Yeah, which is why I thought I could finally... Afford this. Omar. You're doing this because you want to, right? - Not because... - Kate, I want to. - Good night. - Salwah? Yes. I haven't seen you in forever. Oh, well, I've been here. Hey, um... - Yes. - Do you want to someday, if you're free... Do you want to have dinner with me? Do you like Japanese? I'm a hell of a sushi chef, if I do say so myself. Oh. No, I... I have to tell you I'm going to get... I'm... I'm... I'm going to be late. I'm going to be late. Our movie star! What's with the air conditioner? It's boiling in here. What, you expected it to work? I like it. When I'm here I can relate to my people in Iraq. Kate, Salwah called. She's late. I can run some errands. Just tell her to call me, okay? I want to tell Salwah myself, okay? What's up, my homie-omie? - How did we do? - $900, more or less. That's it? Your other business... Are you busy? We have first run-through tonight, camera rehearsaI. Pick good roles. Be smart. Think about the future. It's funny you say that. I just proposed to Kate. What, are you getting married? Fantastic, Omar! Omar is getting married. Huh? Fresh baklava and tea on me. I make it myself. Come here. Come here, come here. Congratulations. So, yo, big shot, you making enough money to support a wifey now? I landed a good role finally, and on a good show, American Safety Don't tell me, they're gonna have you play a terrorist again. No, not this time. A doctor. Hey, that's a good part for you. Yeah, no more Arab bad guys, inshallah Yeah, inshallah, but don't get your hopes up too high, homie, because as long as the Jews controI Hollywood... That's a myth. - Talent wins in this town, that's all. - For reaI? So then how come there ain't no successfuI Arab actors? - There are. - Who? - Omar Sharif. - He's a Jew. He's not a Jew. He was Christian and became a Muslim. - He's a Jew. - He's not a Jew. He's a Jew. They're all Jews. Name a known actor who's not a Jew. - Antonio Banderas. - Big Sephardic Jew. He's not a Jew. Anyway, you'll see. I'm going to be the Antonio Banderas of the Arabs one day. Yeah, one day the GirI Scouts are gonna sell cookies for the Muslim brotherhood, too, you know. Murad, you watch too much Al Jazeera. It feeds your constant fear of the West. Yeah, and Zionist American propaganda feeds your constant fear of your own Middle Eastern people. - Check that shit on Fox. - Fox. Murad, enough already. Read the sign. "No politics or religious discussion allowed in this establishment. "The management. " That's me. That is, but that sign does not say "discussion," M. Whoever made that sign left that shit out. Ya Ya make it. His English like mine, not that good. - But he's cheap. - What do you mean, "his English"? He's illiterate in Arabic also, man. Oh. You know the way. You know the way. You were saying, M, about religion? I have to get the light on for them. I'll get you the light. I'm sorry. Salwah, Kate was here. Give her a call. I need to set up. Sam is coming any minute. You hungry? I lose, and now I got this. Hey, Sam. Look at this guy. - Sam, how are you? - Mustafa. Have a seat. Salwah's setting up. - How's it going, Fikry? - Good, Sam. - Omar. - Hey, Sam. Abdulla, coffee and baklava for Sam. So, Mustafa, you try those dates we brought in last week? - The best, right? - Sold in two days. Funny, we were just talking about those beautifuI dates that they used to grow in Iraq before the US government decided that oiI was sweeter. You're feeling me. I know you are, Fikry. It's all about the oiI. It's not about this democracy shit they keep feeding us. It's about the oiI. And IsraeI. Sam, I'm ready for you. Excuse me, gentlemen. Sabir, you made it! Sabir, my cousin, came from Egypt. Hey, Sabir. - You rested? - Later, later. Salwah's here. Let's go in. Salwah, Sabir is here. Ow! Ow! Salwah. Sorry, Sam. Sabir came all the way from Egypt to see Salwah. - Remember him now? - Yes. - Hi, Sabir. - Hello. Nice to meet you, Sabir. What brings you to LA? Mustafa and I have business. Okay, you guys finish. Let's go. Let's go. What was that about? He's my future husband, supposedly. I didn't know you were engaged. Hmm. I didn't either. I don't get you. Our family always talked about me marrying my first cousin. It's a tradition. I'm sorry. Ow. Mustafa's not like that. He doesn't hold onto old tribaI notions like that. Mustafa thinks it's his duty. You're joking. They arrest Muslims and jaiI them all the time. You know what I'm saying? No charges, no evidence. They just, poof, disappear. Yeah, we hear how badly Arabs are treated in this country. What happened today was very, very frightening. You know, Sabir, We and everybody else will pay the price. Yo, M, who "Everybody else"? It's the Arabs that are paying the price, brother. Murad, you act as if we're the only ones, man. It's part of a hazing process, you know? It happened to the Irish, the Japanese before us. We're the newcomers now, that's all. Yeah, but it happened here in this country. See, the fucking problem is the people in the Middle East are paying the price so that Americans can live their American dream. SUVs, subsidized gas, fucking fast food. I don't understand why you want to live here at all. When you get married and settle, you will see. This is a good country. And a good people, too. Thank you, Salwah. This is for you. Thank you. Mustafa, do you have a minute to talk about business? Yes, Sam. Come in the back. I'll tell you what the problem is. It's the fucking land grabbers. Here I thought it was the fucking Islamic terrorists. Murad. Sabir, go to Salwah. Have a seat. So, you like doing this? Sabir, I'm sorry. This is... This is very strange for me. I... I need to get to know you. I... I need to take some time, but right now I have another client coming in. Sam, this place... Every time I fix something, something else breaks. Yeah, I know, I know. Okay, listen, Mustafa, I had an inspector check out that building and my accountant ran the numbers. - Yeah? - And it looks pretty good. That's great, Sam. I promise you, we'll have the best Egyptian food in town. - We're gonna make a difference. - I agree. I agree. I brought you cookies from Egypt. I'm sure they're delicious. Try one. You'll love it. I can't. I watch my diet. But I'm sure the family will love them. - Atmosphere is important, right? - Sure, sure. We can't have certain elements around. I understand. Not in the new place if we want it to work, because it's not a sociaI club. - I mean, you understand. - I understand. Sure, Sam, sure. - No elements, no problem. - Good, good. The Mohammeds. All these guys named Mohammed. They need room to pray. - You know what your problem is, Fikry? - No, what is my problem? Tell me. You're what we call a self-hating Arab. That's ridiculous. You say that because I'm a Christian, like I'm not even Arab. I didn't say you're not an Arab, Fikry. Let me tell you, when I walk down the street the rednecks yell "towelhead" at me also. Yes, yes, yes, I'll tell you what my problem is. My problem is that my country has been invaded by people of my own religion. And now the Jews and the Muslims have stolen even my victimhood from me. That's my problem. - Hi, Sam. - Hi, Kate. So my cousin's, like, in the Marines in Afghanistan, okay? And he brought back this hash. I mean, this shit's cold-blooded. Been meaning to ask you something. How come every time I turn on the news there's some Muslim dude who's pissed off and killing everybody? Why do you hate America so much? Maybe if you'd educate yourself, you would know the whole story. So tell me the whole story. It's long. I don't remember it all. It's, like, 1,400 years old. So tell me what you know. I want to hear it. All right. Pass the rocket. Once upon a time before the oiI, the sheiks and all of the Saddams and Osamas, in the middle of the Arabian Desert was this cooI dude named Mohammed His homies called him "the honest " He used to kick back and meditate And one day an angeI appeared to him with a new revelation called Islam It means "Submission to God " The God of Abraham, Moses and Jesus Back then, the locaI yokels believed in a bunch of different gods But when the angeI gave Mohammed the message that there's only one God, they dumped the whole idoI-worship thing See, according to Mohammed's prophecy, God would free everybody from slavery Dudes, babes, rich, poor, black, white, whatever Everybody was equaI They were all over that in a heartbeat So freedom and Islam began to spread throughout Arabia And it kept on spreading to India and all the way to China, then across North Africa to Spain This was the start of Islamic civilization Back then Muslims were, like, top dog when it came to art, science, literature and poetry So pretty soon the buzz hit the West, only back then Europe was, like, a bunch of barbarians busy barbecuing plague victims But you know what? They didn't dig these dark dudes with sand all over their feet And that's, like, where I think the word "sand nigger" comes from So they said no way to Islam This brought on the period known as the Crusades, which was, like, a downer for everybody, especially Muslims living in Jerusalem who got royally reamed out by Christian armies fighting to take back the Holy Land for the Pope But finally, this other reaI cooI Kurdish Muslim dude named Saladin shows up and unites the Arabs to fight the Europeans and take Jerusalem back See, difference is, under Saladin there's, like, this time of peace with Jews, Christians and Muslims all kicking it together, which is dope, because Jerusalem's, like, a holy place for all three religions But guess what? That didn't last The Europeans came back even stronger with, like, a divide-and-conquer thing They gave the land the Palestinians were living on to the Jews, and that became the new IsraeI And once the Euro-honkies split, there was, like, constant fighting between the Israelis and Arabs over Jerusalem 'Cause both the Israeli and Arab radicals wanted to have it all If they'd just chill, they'd see Jerusalem is a spirituaI place, the land of milk and honey But, no, because now some Americans come in to check out what all the fuss is about, and they discover oiI And to keep the pumps happening, they prop up these greedy dictators who sell only to them, and they don't help the Arabs, only IsraeI, which pisses the Arabs off So then you get the Israelis and Palestinians fighting over Jerusalem and blowing each other up, while the world just watches and plays it all like some kind of game And that's why the Middle East is a fricking mess 'Cause there ain't no more cooI dudes. Whoa. - Omar, how's it going? - Great. Looking forward to this. - Good. - You wanted to see me? Yeah, there's some script changes I wanted to talk to you about. Look, I'm sorry to say this, but the doctor role has been cut. - Cut? - Yeah. Let's talk over here. Um... Okay, look, they rewrote the entire episode last night. It's practically a new show. - I don't believe it. - Omar, I love your work. I want you to stay, but I'd have to ask you to change roles at the last minute. I'll do it. Really? You're the best. All right, well, here are the new pages. And take a look at the role of Ali. - Ali? - Yeah, we'll run through it shortly, okay? Can you get Omar someone to help him suit up? Hold the noise, please, people. Action, Omar! Everyone on your knees. You're being taken hostage. Um. Okay, cut, let's cut. Can we cut? Cut! You okay? What's up? I don't understand. Why would a terrorist take over a hospitaI? Terrorists want to strike fear in the heart of America. That's what the episode's about. So they're at a hospitaI. There's a lot of people, very little security, okay? But you know this hospitaI is in a quiet little community. It's a show, Omar. We give our heroes of American Safety heroic things every week, all right? So, just give me more accent, and, you know, scary, all right? Okay, everybody. Back to one. We're back to one. Everyone on your knees! You're being taken hostage! We are the soldiers of Allah! Great. Cut! All right. Meet your second cousin. This is Sabir. What's up? Everybody. Let's eat. Yeah, come, let's eat. So your friend Murad... He tells me you're thinking of opening a new place. Maybe with this man Sam. - I think he's a... - A Jewish man. I just see him as a good businessman. It's true. They're good with money. But he can use this against you. Just turn on the TV, see what they're doing. Sabir, not too long ago in Egypt, Jews and Muslims had business together. But how much interest did they charge us? Mohammed, put that away, please. It's broken anyway. You broke it? Do you know how much this cost? So, Sabir, you own your pharmacy in Egypt. Salwah here is a nurse. A nurse? So why do you do this salon work? It's extra money. Um, I'd like to ask, how do you feeI about women working? After marriage, I mean. To be honest, it's better for women to stay at home. So you believe that women are born to raise children and to be wives, but not to find their own work? Salwah, what Sabir tried to say here, to have a strong family is very important for a mother... Okay, okay, let me ask Sabir directly, if I may. If we were to be married, would you expect me to give up my salon and quit nursing? I don't think it will be an issue. I'd prefer to stay in Egypt. I don't think America is a good place to raise a family. Excuse me, please. Salwah, it is always hard at first. You guys just met. Oh. So I should wait and move back to Egypt when it's less hard. He will change his mind when he gets to know you. I don't know how to say this, but you're almost 30. That's nice. That's very nice. Just let me finish. You are a Muslim woman living in America. So I don't have a lot of options, you mean? Because I am a Muslim, I have to marry a Muslim? That's not for you to decide. I want you to have your own kids, your own home. - I want you to be happy. - You want me to be happy or this will make you happy? This is what our father always wanted. Listen, get to know him. Just give him a chance. You heard how he referred to me at the cafe today? "I have business with Mustafa. " That's how he thinks of me, business. In Los Angeles, Homeland Security officials have made severaI arrests in connection with the recent terror threat that has raised the alert leveI to code red No names have been released, but one officiaI said that more arrests were forthcoming and that, quote, "A far larger Islamist network has been uncovered than originally suspected " I can't believe this shit, M. What's wrong with you, Murad? Palestinian this, Palestinian that. Fuck them! I'm tired of their bullshit. They are ruining our lives, those bastards. And now, Arab dictators are controlling us in the name of the Palestinian cause. Why don't we just hand the land over to those motherfuckers, because they're just going to take it. Come on, man, you can't say that about the Palestinians. - Why not? - 'Cause it's unfair. And it's politically stupid, especially now. They've been kicked out of Lebanon, they've been kicked out of Jordan. If they lost their land, where would they go? I'll tell you where. Florida. Take all the Jews, because there's a lot of them in Florida, move them to IsraeI, and take the Palestinians and let them live in Florida, or maybe Cuba. No, I tell you what, I have the perfect solution to the problem in the Middle East. All the Palestinians should convert to Judaism and become Israeli. He's melting. You've gone out of your goddamn mind. No, all the Arabs should become Jewish, man. That'll solve the problem once and for all. Why would anyone want to be Arab these days? But to be Jewish, that's cooI, man. You get the support of everyone. You guys still going on about that? Oppression's still going on, Sephardic Sam. Why shouldn't we be going on? Murad, the truth is, the fact is, you Jordanians kill more Palestinians than anybody else. Bullshit. Bullshit. You know what? You bageI munchers, you steaI their land, you destroy their homes, you shoot missiles from the sky into streets full of innocent people... You prefer to blow up buses and airplanes full of innocent people. - Jesus, enough. - Murad, calm down. - Look at him. - Sit down. I'm sorry. I just came by to apologize for walking out yesterday. - Mustafa. - Just sit down. - Not now, Abdulla. - Mustafa. But it's this... This inflammatory shit, which I guess you watch 24 hours a day. You're goddamn right I do. I watch it 24 hours a day because I like to stay informed, accurately informed. Misinformed. American propaganda! - No more TV. That's it. - That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying. No more TV. - Does Al Jazeera have parentaI controls? - What? I try what you say, but they pray inside, the Mohammed. He's a Mohammed, I told you, don't disturb them. You want peace, but the ignorant are brainwashed by the crap. There's no peace 'cause there's no fucking justice. Occupation and oppression is why there's no peace! What kind of peace do you get from the great Arab tradition of sending suicide bombers into hoteI lobbies and coffee shops full of innocent children? You're killing the innocent children! Enough! Enough! You guys want to fight? Outside! Don't touch him. Outside! Mustafa. Go around them. They don't let me in. I told you, don't bother them. I tried. I tried two times. This is Habibi Cafe, man, not Hebrew Cafe. Mohammed, what are you doing here? It's Friday. I thought we were meeting at the mosque. I don't want to go to the mosque anymore. Mustafa. What? Mustafa, Mohammeds won't let me in. They pray inside and I can't get in. Okay, have a seat. Have a seat. Come. Give it to me. I have to do everything by myself. - I tried three times. You try now. - Okay. Listen to this. Listen to this. "Buy a Christmas tree from IsraeI, where Christ was born. "We ship to your door. " They're selling Palestine off piece by piece, these motherfuckers. - Dad, are you okay? - Yes, Mohammed. Yes, I'm okay. What's the story about you not going to the mosque? I told you, I don't want to be a Muslim anymore. Why, Mohammed? And Murad said we can get a Christmas tree by maiI. Mohammed, for God's sake! You are Muslim. We are Muslim. We don't celebrate Christmas. We celebrate our own holiday. - We celebrate Ramadan. - But Ramadan doesn't have a tree. And Murad said we can get one from those motherfuckers in IsraeI. You tell me what's happening. Murad, what did you say in front of my son? Yo, chill, M. What? I'll show you. Read for yourself, a baby Christmas tree. Only the Jews can make money off the Christians by stealing from the Arabs. Stop with the Jew thing. I'm sick of it! Mohammed, when Christmas comes around, I'll buy you a tree. Fikry, nobody's buying a tree for Mohammed. Yeah, buy it from Jerusalem for $29.99, get it blessed by a fucking rabbi. That's it. Murad, outside. Oh! Fikry, Fikry, stay away. I'm talking to you as a friend, Murad. You have to stop spreading all this hatred. And no more swearing, especially in front of Mohammed. I didn't swear. You swear all the time! You don't hear yourself? You're too angry. Nobody listens to you when you're angry. You're goddamn right I'm angry. I am swole up. Aren't you? Look at what's happening to our people. That's it. I'm warning you, if you don't stop, I don't want to see you here. What? You're on their side now? Fine. But I'm gonna tell you something, Mustafa, you are too accommodating. You forget who you are. You want to fit in maybe. You, the Jew. The Jew, you. You can't have it both ways. Come on, come on. So you wear this when you get married? It's supposed to make you exotic for your husband. Omar told me, Salwah, about your marriage. You know, I don't even know the guy. I haven't seen him since I was 12. I hardly remember that. How can Mustafa expect you to marry a man you don't even know? It's tradition, you know. The family arranges it to protect the woman. Listen, it's none of my business, Salwah, but you need to marry a man that you love, a man you want to... I mean, isn't there somebody that you'd like to, you know... Shh! - Kate. - No one? I really don't believe it. Let's face it, Salwah, you're not the Virgin Mary. Okay, okay, okay. All right, there is this doctor at the hospitaI. He's very nice. He's very cute. And he kind of asked me out for Japanese food at his house. Okay, well, there you go. I think you should do it with him. Kate, stop it. I'm not gonna just do it with him. Well, do you like him? So go out with him. Why not? Because you're Muslim? Look, even Omar struggles with the differences between us, but it doesn't matter. What do you mean? He never told his parents we were living together, but all that tradition stuff, that just goes out the window when there's love. Mohammed, what is it? You don't want to pray with us? You want to talk about it? Did Muslims really kill all those people in the twin towers? Listen to me, habibi There are good Muslims and bad Muslims, like all other religions. And the ones who flew those planes were bad and ignorant of Islam. Who's a good Muslim? Muhammad Ali is a good Muslim. He's a black guy, not an Egyptian. Your dad is a Muslim and Egyptian. Don't you count me? Closed? Where is Leila? - Mr. Marzoke. - What's going on? We'd like to bring you in for further questioning, if you don't mind. - What for? - We'll get into that. No, go into it now. Mr. Marzoke, I could arrest you, if that's what you want, or you can come with us voluntarily and show your willingness to cooperate. No, go ahead, arrest me. I want a record of this. I'm not gonna disappear into one of your cells and nobody knows where I am. I don't know where you get your ideas of how we operate, sir, but it's not like that. I'm back, Leila. Who's that? Do you work here, sir? Do you speak English? Do you have residency papers, sir? Sir, what are you doing here? - You! - You have to come with us. Leave him alone! He didn't do anything! - Take the kids away. - Back off. - He's not resisting. Please, please don't. - I have to take you in. if the infidels attacks our God, it is our responsibility to defend Him Are you ready? Ready! That is tight. That is hot. They're running this on prime time, dude. You are gonna blow the fuck up. Give me. Now remind me, who got you on this MOW? - You did, Dez. - Give me some more. Give me some more. Thank you. Thank you, but I'm saying it's another bad-guy Arab. You know, this thing that happened with American Safety Dude, I got clients who'd gun down their granny for one episode of this hot-shit series, American Safety And how many did you book? Seven? Who is your fucking manager? Dez, I'm gratefuI for the work, for the MOW, too, really. All right. I don't know, this kind of image they want me to play, it's demeaning. Worse, it's like, I don't know, crushing my souI. Omar, you'd better not even be thinking about bailing out on me on this. Okay, they changed the role on you, but you did the right thing. You rolled with it. You turn around and back out now, I'll never be able to book you again. I fucking mean it. We square? Good. Terry, get me Saperstein. - Sorry, it's my fiance. - No, it's cooI. Kate, I'm leaving. I'll call you. What? Mustafa? - All right, tell Salwah I'll be right there. - You are bad, dude. You are bad. Oh, yeah, I'm an accessory. But it'll happen again. That's right. That's right. I hear you. I hear you. Dez... Uh... Hang on for one second. Yeah? I mean it. After this, no more. It's killing me. Omar. Okay. All right. No more terrorists. I'll see what I can do. Okay? Go. Go, go, eat your falafeI, shish kebab, whatever you want to call them. And have some espresso, too. Get a life. Shit. Terry, I lost him. Yeah, get me Sap on the phone. Sap? Sorry about that. Yeah. Yeah. Salwah. What is it? Come in. Come in, please. Salwah, are you okay? Okay, Mr. Marzoke. Come with me, please. Sorry for all the noise, Mr. Marzoke. Where am I? We maintain a presence in a number of locations. So, Mr. Marzoke, you don't appear to have much of a financiaI acumen for someone who runs his own shop and owns a car service. As a matter of fact, you're in the red. You're very near foreclosure. - I'm struggling. Is that a crime? - No, no. But since you are struggling, as you say, we were wondering how you could afford to make such sizable monthly wire transfers to a terrorist organization. I don't send the money to terrorists. Well, "terrorist" has a broad definition. The Saudis don't consider HAMAS to be a terrorist organization, for example, but the US government does. I'm not a Saudi. You send money to an entity called the Sharia Foundation. Now, there is a charitable organization called the Sharia Islamic Foundation. And they've been known to finance jihad studies in madrasas worldwide. I told you before, I just make zakat No, these are not zakat The Sharia Foundation is not a foundation. It's a storefront operation. Ostensibly it exports Egyptian music, movies, the Quran on tape, things of that type, but unofficially it's a cash delivery service. It's not illegaI. I don't use banks because banks charge so much money and it takes weeks before the money clears. I know the man who owns the business. I trust him more than banks. - Where does the cash go? - I know the man. This man brings the money door-to-door. - Where does it go? - And in 24 hours the money is there. - Answer me! - A bank cannot do that. Where does the cash go? The government takes money from you, taxes you... - Answer my question. Where does it go? - To my cousin, sir. Why? Because my father sold our land for me so I can own my business here. He sold it to his brother, like a loan, with the promise that we'll buy it back. Buying it back was my responsibility, to make a life here, to bring my sister over. My father didn't live to see the land come back. Because all these years I've been trying to buy the land back. And every night when I go to sleep I can hear my own father's voice saying, "Mustafa, "what happened to your promise? What happened to your land?" So you sent your money through a hawala service to buy your land back. Why didn't you say that before? Why did you tell me it was a charitable donation? Even my sister and my kids don't know about this, sir. Where I come from, it is a shame for a man to lose his land. Dad's here. Dad! Leila, Hammo. Everything is okay. It's okay. Daddy, what are we gonna do? We're gonna live our lives. You hear me? I still believe in this country. It will get better, okay? - Thanks for seeing us, Sam. - It's okay. It's important. - Ben coming? - No, he wanted us to talk to you first. Look, as far as I'm concerned, nothing's changed. We ran the numbers. We projected that the place would be into profits in two years. This is not about profits, Sam. Okay, you sold merchandise to this guy for a couple of years. So what? You don't know him. He's an Arab. So it's not impossible he's sending money to terrorists who want to destroy IsraeI, is it? You watch too much TV, David. Okay, okay, let's not call it terrorism then. Let's say he supports the liberation of Palestine, okay? It's not so far-fetched. I mean, most of them do. Sam, we haven't made a commitment yet. I shook his hand. I told him that we could make this work. Besides, it's good business. We all agreed. So it's good business. Why do we need him? We have the capitaI. - Well, first off, he brought it to me. - So offer him something. Let him be the manager and the chef, but don't cut him in as a partner. He'll be gratefuI for anything you give him, you'll see. Okay, I've listened to what you had to say, but Ben has the last word. Why is there anything to discuss with Ben? I mean, who, who anywhere in the entire world would want to have their money tied up with some Muslim guy who's under investigation by the FBI, for Christ's sakes? I mean, just answer me that. What did you tell Sam? I didn't tell him anything. He didn't ask. He volunteered his lawyer, Mustafa. Salwah, I can't afford a lawyer. I can't even pay Sam back for the baiI. You need a lawyer. They're still investigating you. They've frozen all of your accounts. Do you think that your problems are none of my business? I thought I could work it out. By marrying me off to Sabir. Shh! You thought that if I marry him you'll get the land back. It's not just the land, Salwah. No, it kills the two birds with one stone. The land and your duty to see that I'm married. This is your land now. And you can choose to live with one foot over here and one foot over there if you want to, but not me. Come, Sabir, come. I think maybe this deaI our fathers made, maybe it's a kind of curse for all of us. - No, Sabir. - Wait. Let him finish. All my life I hear how you are here in America, a big success. So I come here with a little bit of resentment, Mustafa. - Why? - No, it's true. I come here resenting what you have. Resenting America even. But I look around and I see maybe a family that's not so happy. I see your troubles. And I think maybe what they say about Muslims who come to live here is true. They must give something up to live here. But is it worth it? I... I got this fixed for Mohammed. Good night. - Thank you, Sabir. - Good night. Are you ready? Ready? Authorities have identified and released photographs of suspects in the ongoing terrorist investigation in Los Angeles that has resulted in the nationaI alert leveI being raised to code red The four Middle Eastern Omar, it stresses you out. Okay. Everyone at the bank saw your TV ad. Great. Omar the jihadi. Come on, they were impressed. Everyone says you're gonna be famous. It's not so bad, you know. You have a great role on American Safety We should be celebrating. You know, this American Safety job... - I wanted to tell you... - What? You're starting your first episode today. - Aren't you excited? I am. - Yeah. You're right, it should be celebrated. We'll have another reason to celebrate soon. Omar, you're all right with this, right? You're not gonna judge me differently later? No, I just want our child to live in a place where nobody will think twice about his name, where "Nasser" is just as American as "Giuliani" or "Lieberman. " It's gonna happen, Omar. It is, okay? - Dez. - Omar, are you listening carefully? I just got back from a little breakfast meeting. This is hot shit, homeboy. This is big This is awesome I'm talking major studio, leading role. Are you ready? You got an audition in two hours. - I got the script for you right here - Dez, thank you. Thank you. This is the kind of thing I wanted. - You're gonna naiI it - Yeah, I will. - You're gonna naiI it - I'll naiI it, I promise. I'll naiI it. All right then Son of a bitch. Hey, Murad. Come in. Yo, M, you all right? I heard. Yeah, Sam called his lawyer for me. - The Jew did that? - Yeah, the Jew did this for me, Murad. You know, about yesterday, I just wanted to say that... Murad, forget it. We're friends for a long time. Okay? - I just want respect. - You should have respect. But we should respect other people or we're never going to pull ourselves up. You hear me? - I do. - Good. Listen, I need to fix this place up and sell it. I need to put my life together. Go have some coffee or tea. Fikry here has started. - Thank you. - Murad. Fikry, how are you, habibi? What are you doing here? - What are you doing here always? - I was waiting for you. - Can you fix it? - I fix. Not like you fixed the sign. - What's wrong with the sign? - Well, you missed one word. I give a good price! What, you want one-word refund? Thank you, Mrs Jensen Tell Sam I appreciate it Look, it shows that we sold the land with the option that we can buy it back. That's why I've been sending money to Egypt. So it's a deed. Okay, we need to get it translated. But how long will it take? I need to sell this place. I need the money so I can buy the new place with Sam. I don't think you understand, Mr. Marzoke. They have frozen all your assets untiI the investigation is over. I advise you not to even try to liquidate any property right now. But this is my money. You give me a few days. - Hi. Can I help you? - Hi. - One coffee, please. - No problem. Hey, check this guy. I saw him before, man, like on the news or something, but with the whole raghead business. - You mean like the terror alert thing? - I don't know, man, but... He just left his backpack right behind you. Hey, man. - Is that your bag over there? - Yeah. Maybe you shouldn't be leaving it Iying around. What? You think I'm a suicide bomber? Look, I've seen you before, man. Yeah? Where, on TV, beheading an innocent reporter maybe? Well, you've got me pegged, man. I am a terrorist. And if you don't get out of my face, my fucking face, I'm gonna blow this place up! But first, I'm gonna have my coffee. All right? Okay? Thanks. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen This is TVLA 4 breaking news Authorities have identified these men as part of an ongoing terrorist operation in Los Angeles All are believed to be at large in the US or trying to enter What's really going on? I mean, what is really going on? Do they cast actors for this crap? Pretty soon everybody's gonna be scared shitless of anyone with a suntan. It's a good time for Americans to stay alert Murad, we already talked about this. No more news. Watch a movie. I want people to walk here and look, nice atmosphere. No bad elements. Okay? You! Place your hands behind the back of your head, interlace your fingers and stand up. Put your hands behind your head. All right, Mr. Nasser, you can go. But I want to say this, under the circumstances, we take what you said very seriously. Doesn't matter what the situation was or how angry the other guy made you. Do something like this again and they're not gonna be so forgiving next time. - Got it? - Yeah, sure. Hey, wait. I'm sorry I'm late. I apologize. Omar, there's nothing I can do. They're gone. It's over. - Can't we reschedule? - They cast the role. They shoot next week. Look, I'm sorry. They really wanted to see you, but it's a done deaI. I'm here. Leila, where is Mohammed? I thought he was with you. No, you were supposed to bring him here. - What about Sabir? - They were both gone when I got up. Phone home, see if they're back and try Salwah. Okay. You have to replace all these pipes. They are no good. Come on, Ya Ya. Yo, Omar. We were just talking about you. Just saw your TV ad for your show. I thought no more terrorists, man. Hey, don't listen to him. You're doing great. You're gonna be a big star. I have to run. We're shooting. - How did we do? - $750. Omar, I know you're busy with acting. That's great, but I need a full-time driver, man. I need the money. You don't want me to drive for you now? You focus on acting. Let me take the cab off your hand. I need... I need it, man. Look, it's really a bad time for me. Can we talk? Listen, I've got some problem here. Ya Ya's here fixing the thing. I need to fix all this situation. - Mustafa, you're okay. - Hey, Sam, how you doing? Have a seat. We'll get you a shisha. All right. Won't say no to a shisha. Look, Mustafa, it's very important, something I didn't tell anybody. Listen, thank you for what you did yesterday. Taking Salwah to Sam, it made all the difference. Leila, shisha for Sam. Listen, listen. Come back, we'll talk, okay? Ya Ya, talk to me! Oh, whoa, Sam. Don't suck so hard. You need to treat it like a nipple. A nipple. Sorry. You see that? Gentle. You like? I knew that you would like that. Me, too. Yes, you like big fat juicy nipples, just like me. That's why I like Jewish women. That's funny. I got the idea that you didn't like Jewish people at all. No, man. What... You're not feeling me, Sam. I love Jewish women. The best sex that I ever had was with a Muslim woman and a Jewish woman at the same time. You know how Muslims and Jews fight over Jerusalem? That's how they fought over my dick. And I ain't bullshitting you. You need to hit that shit, Sammy. Well, somehow I think it would be hard for me to get a Muslim woman into bed. No. No. Just convince them that you're doing it for peace. That's how you get them. Peace, my friend. Everybody fucks everybody else for peace. I guess you got a point there. - You okay, Sam? - Yeah. Yeah, Murad was just giving me some new insights into smoking a shisha. Thank you, my friend, for yesterday. Oh, no. I'm sorry it happened. You okay? You seem... I guess Angela told you they froze my money. Yeah, yeah. Mustafa, listen. Maybe the timing isn't right. - Yeah? - Sam, you put the deposit on the building, I pay you my share when I work my situation out. - We'll have it in writing. - No, yeah, yeah... Look, there are some complications that we have to address. Your circumstances have changed, right? - This is only a cash flow problem. - No. No. No. Okay, look, this is hard for me. You know I'm in business with my family, right? And my family is run like a corporation, believe me. So untiI your legaI situation is cleared up they want to offer you a different deaI. They put up the totaI investment, you run the place. You want me to run the place for you? Like a manager? - No. No. - Sam, we are partners, you and me. Mustafa, don't take this the wrong way. I have to tell you what they're saying. You want me to work for your family. It's not what I want. I'm getting outvoted here. Do you understand? What about our chance? Let's just see what happens, okay? Let's just see how it goes. Okay? Omar, you're late. We've been trying to reach you. - Yeah, look, I had a problem. - What do you mean? Omar, what's up? We're waiting. Those lines, I can't say them. You did them in rehearsaI and you were cooI with it. - No, I'm not cooI with it. - Okay, but we're shooting, okay? The show airs in a week. They will seriously have your head if you just walk out in the middle of this. The scene has no sense. The lines are stupid. Character isn't reaI. I don't understand what he's trying to do. Okay, he's a terrorist. He's full of hate. That's all you have to play. No. That's what I'm saying. That's exactly wrong. Wait, what's happening? Omar has problems with how his character's being portrayed in the script. It's a bit late for that, isn't it, Omar? - Let's get on with it, bud. - Don't call me bud. - Read the lines and see how they sound. - I have read the lines. And since I'm producing this show, you're either gonna do the lines as they're written or I'll replace you. I don't care how late in the day it is. Are you stupid or don't care if it's propaganda or not? All right. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. No, you leave. I'm talking to her. - Get security. - Hey, over here. - Believe this? - I can't... I mean, he's... I don't know what to do. What's up? Now, I'd advise you to go on your own and not make them force you, okay? All right, everybody, back to work. This is over. - No, no, it's not over. It's not over. - Hey, hey. Get this maniac off of me. - Listen to me. Wait a minute. - Get off of me. - Wait, wait, wait. I want to... - Get off of me. - Listen. - Wait! Freeze! Get out! Johnny, get out of here. Down! Down! Omar, chill out, man. I was surprised when you said you wanted to do this Last time I saw you, you practically sprinted away from me I don't know what to say Tell me about you. I mean, you're a mystery to me. - You're Egyptian, right? - Yes. Uh... I was born there. That's all. Okay, well, I came here when I was 12. And I went to schooI and to college here. So, really, you know, this is like my home. Yeah, but still, it must have been hard for you, the transition from Egypt to America. Uh... No, not really, you know. I wanted to fit in, so... Well, you know, Egypt's right at the top of my list. You okay? I love Egyptian history. I love Middle Eastern music, Middle Eastern food. Every time I'm on the Westside, I go to that... What's the name of it? It's an Egyptian place. - Habibi's? - Habibi's, yeah. It's a great place. - That's my brother's place. - Come on. - Really? That's amazing. - Yes. What does it mean, "habibi"? "My love. " Do you want to eat? No. We're at Coyote Film Studios in East Los Angeles, where a gunman has seized a number of hostages Eyewitnesses say that the man, an actor, Omar JamaI AbduI Nasser, attacked members of a film crew and is holding the director, the producer and others against their will A security guard has been reported to be shot - Is this guy flying solo? - He's a disgruntled employee. He got picked up earlier for a similar thing. I got a man trying to penetrate from the roof up there and another seeking a vantage point from over here. Why didn't you just listen? Omar, please. It's just a TV show, okay? It doesn't mean anything. It means everything. We're live at the studios where the new TVseries American Safety is filmed An Egyptian-born Muslim actor and part-time cab driver Omar Nasser - is still holding - I don't understand. the film crew hostage at gunpoint - How can this be? - He didn't do it. Change the channeI. Put it on an Arab station. - Hey, hey, hey! - Leave it, Murad. I just asked him to give up driving my cab. That can't be it, Mustafa. There has to be a problem, man. The problem is this young generation. They listen to their heart and forget about their brain. You just wait. If there is another 9/11 it will be safer for all of us to go back to Iraq with Fikry. officers inspecting the roof of the studio where Mr Nasser is holding the hostages We don't know if police are preparing any kind of assault on the studio, but I've been assured by the office authority Anybody working here? Leila, see what he wants. No, no, no. - No, no, no. I'm sorry. - What's wrong? Wait. I won't hurt you. No, stop. Stop, please. I'm sorry, I... - What did I do wrong? - I thought... I thought I could do this, but I can't. It's... It's not you. It's me. You wouldn't understand. I can't even believe it. I don't believe what I'm seeing. You liked it with a lot of sauce, right? You know what? I come in here and spend good money for service, not to take a load of crap off you. Sir, you're talking to my daughter. I come in here all the time. Your daughter is rude to me. I don't have to put up with this shit. Sir, I'm asking you not to speak like that here. Or you'll what? Come on. Look at you people. You're fucking pathetic. - Who are you calling pathetic, bitch? - You, and all of you, sitting around bitching and moaning all day about how Arabs are treated, fighting amongst yourselves. If that's the best you can do, you deserve to have your asses kicked. You've got to let it go. You can't win like this. You'll just end up getting hurt. I'm already hurt. Hanging in there? Good. You want some water? Keep the pressure on your leg and keep still. - Kate? - Omar, what are you doing? His name is still being withheld - What did the doctor say? - He said... - Put down the gun, Omar! - No! Put it down, Omar. You're going to get hurt. - Omar? - The SWAT guys are on their way. They will not hesitate to kill you. You have my word on that. I was gonna let them go. It's an accident. I believe you. I believe you. I'm gonna put down my gun. Now... You step away from them. You put your gun down now. You can't arrest me. I was gonna let them go. Nobody's gonna do anything. We're just gonna talk. I'll listen. Omar? My fiance, she's... I've just heard a single shot that sounded like a discharge from a high-powered rifle, possibly one of the sniper rifles You deserve to have your asses kicked. I'll kick your ass, you sand nigger. Me, sand nigger? trying to look like a black man. You think people in this country think you're cooI? Damn right they think I'm cooI. You understand? They don't think you're cooI, asshole. Sir, I told you, watch your language! Excuse me, I'm looking for Mustafa Marzoke. I am Mustafa Marzoke. What is your reaction to your employee, Omar Nasser, being killed by police tonight? What? EMS are coming out with someone on a stretcher Yes, we're getting reports that the gunman, Omar Nasser, has been shot and killed by police, and that all the hostages are alive In fact, I am seeing the hostages now No, no, no! - They fucking murdered him! - Stay. Get the fuck out of my face! Get the fuck out. You people, you fucking murder us. You fucking film our suffering for your entertainment! Fuck you! Murad, Murad, Omar is dead. He's dead. What murder? He takes people hostage with a gun. - What do you expect to happen? - Fuck you! - And fuck your American media! - No, fuck the Arab media! Tell me about your employee, Mr. Marzoke. Did he have extremist politicaI or religious views? What? No. Do you know if he has any connection to any of the other Middle Eastern men being arrested tonight by police? He was our friend. Go away, please. - Fucking cameI cocksucker. - Go away! Go away! - Out! We're closed! - Okay. Okay. All right. Please. We're closed! Out! It's all right. It's okay. Mustafa, I heard about Omar... Oh, my God. Oh, my... Who did this? I did it. I did it all. What? Mustafa... You don't need to worry about me or the land. Do you understand? You're released from all of that. You've done your duty. You've done more than enough. You've made a new life for all of us. Sam, I've always respected your decisions and let you run the family business, but this time, the family thinks you're mistaken. So I hear. Then you're prepared to get us out of this arrangement? Ben. I've always believed in our purpose. I've always tried to keep that foremost in my mind, but if anyone asked me to apply that belief, or even money for that matter, to the destruction of other people's lives, I would draw the line. Well, I know Mustafa. And I know that he is the same kind of man. We are tied together by the same forefather. More importantly, I believe we are tied together now, here. We're Americans. We can make a difference. We can change things, maybe show that catastrophe isn't a foregone conclusion. The everyday act of breaking bread together is more powerfuI than all the hate. Let's do it! What's this? Wait. It's supposed to say, "American Middle East. " Ya Ya, what happened? I write the way you tell me on the phone. - What? - I write the way you tell me on the phone. I don't know what he said or what you wrote, but it's "American Middle East. " What's the difference? He gave us a great price. I can't argue with that. Our investors. Here come Fikry and Murad and the four Mohammeds. What are they doing here? Murad, I thought no SUV. - It's a hybrid, bitch. - Mother bitch. - Mustafa, look, we talked about this. - You know, good luck for us. No, no, no, no, no, no, we talked about this, right? This place is gonna be different. It's a business, not a sociaI club. - Sure, Sam. Sure. - Let's just get them in. - Whoa, we were here first. - No, we come before you. - No, you didn't. - David, David, it's okay. No, it's not okay. Mr. Bloom is an investor. He was here first. Yo, March of the Penguins, step off, boy, all right? - Murad... - Just because you spend... Hello, young man. Who are you? I'm Mustafa's son and my name is Mohammed. Good. Let's go inside, shall we? - Are you hungry? - Yeah, looks good. Don't pay attention to them. They don't know what they're doing.
