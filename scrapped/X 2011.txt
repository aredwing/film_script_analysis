Can you lend me a dollar? I'll pay you back. I can get a smoke for a dollar. You're a real friend. Don't keep your cash in your pocket either. Happy birthday, Holly. Come here. Ever felt like running away? Ever felt like changing your life? What's your dream, Holly? If you could do anything, go anywhere, what would it be? Before my mum died, she took me to Paris. That's what I remember about her. She was happy. I've always wanted to go back. Let's do it. Let's go to Paris. I'm getting out. I'm gonna disappear, and I want you to come with me. Money won't be a problem. What about your family? I don't love them. Open it. Put it on. You have to. It's bad luck otherwise. What? Let's go. Sorry. It's all right. Look me in the eyes and say that.

When I fuck you, when I make you come, I know it's all an act, an illusion. It doesn't matter. I want the illusion. That's what I'm paying for. Just for an hour, I've got the biggest dick... The magic touch. I can make you come in under a minute. Prove it. Oh, yeah. Mm. Yeah? No, no. You're early. No problem. Come up. Fuck! I got business. Get in the bathroom and shut up. Take your clothes. Come on, move! Move! Hello, Willie. Lovely night for it. Yes, top night, Mr. Bennett. Things went great, I'm happy to say. Fine. Well, come on. Make me happy. They loved the gear. You too? Did you love it too? Yeah. I had a taste, Mr. Bennett. I'm not gonna deny it. Of course you did, Willie. Yeah. A good salesman's got to know his product. Here. You better count that. Do you like bowling, Willie? Dunno. Why? Because now you're a bowling ball. Drive! You've rung Holly. I'm tied up right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll call you back to arrange an appointment. Gotcha. Fuck. Fuck. Calm down. - He's dead, isn't he? - Shh. - He shot him in the head! - Shut up! I saw it! I saw it! Just calm down, all right? All right? Oh, shit. What the fuck are you looking at? Where to? Just drive. He knew we were there. He didn't see us. How do you know? You're safe. Oh, fuck. Stop. Stop! You don't know me. I don't know you. Hey. Wait! Where to? Where can I take you? Look, give me a destination or get out. You all right? Everyone's crazy tonight. What's that? Don't worry. Shh. Can't leave him at home. He's part of my act. Look, can I take you somewhere? I'm hungry. How about your favorite restaurant? Vegas is the place for any serious magician. My old man used to say that if you conquer Vegas, the world will follow. If you could work at any casino, which one would it be? Caesar's. How come? It's the coolest. And he played there once on the same bill as Tom Jones. Who? Tom Jones? The singer. Forget it. Your Dad sounds cool. Yeah, he was. I used to watch his shows over and over. My dad was magic too. He disappeared when I was born. What, you never saw him? I got a stepdad. Aren't you cold? I left my coat at the hotel. Here. So what did you want to be when you grew up? I never had a dream or anything. Not like you. Maybe I could be your... Your lovely assistant. Hello, Holly. I'm Willie's friend. You going somewhere? Where's your friend? Willie was a greedy turd. He always got a double act. I don't know what you're talking about. That was foreplay. Do you want to fuck with me? Your friend with the pink lipstick. She was from the street. I don't know her name. Wrong answer. Look into my eyes and listen to the sound of my voice. There is nothing but the sound of my voice and my eyes. I will count backwards from five. When I reach one, you will be under my spell. Five. I want you to completely free your mind. Four. All tension flows from your body. Three. You feel totally relaxed. Two. You're light as a feather. One. A deep sleep envelopes you. Can you hear me? Yeah. Tell me your name. Shay Maree Ryan. How old are you, Shay? Tell me something about yourself. I never forget a face. Where are you from? Up north. Why are you here? Mum died, so I ran away. Sorry. Do you have a boyfriend? No. Look at me. You're beautiful. Don't. Can I see you again? Do you want to see me or see me? I want to see you. "Harry the Impossible." Will you call? I don't just hypnotize anyone, you know. It wouldn't work out. How do you know if you don't take a chance? What's in the bag, bitch? Hand it over, and you won't get hurt. You're the one'll get hurt. Aww teach her some manners, Rock. I'll teach her some fuckin' manners, all right. Oh, fuck! My fuckin' eyes! My fucking head! You bitch! I fuckin' hate you people. Open your mouth! Open your mouth! I want a room. $25 the half, $30 the hour. Five bucks for the towel. No, for the... for the night. Room three, first floor, end of the corridor. Thanks. Whoo, oh, my God! Hey. Hey. Hey, Mum. Don't you ever be afraid to take a chance, Shay, you know? We're looking for your friend. I don't know her. Yeah, but you know what she looks like, though, don't you? Huh? Don't ya? No. Ah! Don't you? Stop, stop. All right. All right! She didn't see you. She can't hurt you. You can't trust women. Shit just fuckin' flies out of their mouth without them even thinking. It's biological. It's because they got a cunt hidden away. It's natural they're gonna be hiding something. With a bloke, it's all just there, isn't it? What you see is what you get. But women are fuckin' liars. I fuckin' hate women. Start looking. Where's Rose? Don't know. Who are you? I heard you from next door. Have you got anything? No. Got a smoke? Sorry. Fuck. What time is it? It's late. Where the fuck is she? I'll get you some water. Okay? Sweet. Here I am, baby. Who the fuck are you? She's the girl from next door. Well, she can fuck off, because we're fuckin' busy. I was just seeing if your friend was all right. He's not my friend. Hurry. Come on. Hurry up. Come on. Come on. Come on! Half. Half. Half! Fuck. Fuck, fuck. The back of your hand. Shut up, bitch! Shut up. Fuck! Ooh. You got any money? No. Bullshit. Cutie like you. Come on. Give us some money. I don't have any. Fuck you. Hey, open the fucking door. Come on, sweetheart. Open the fucking door. The welcome wagon. Cunts. That's the way it is. They fucked me. Now it's your turn. I could tell 'em you're here. They'd pay me for it. Thanks. Get fucked. Hey. Pink lipstick. Run! Gotcha. Get in! Are you all right? What did he do to you? Police radio. What? He's a cop. Fuck. You should go home. I can't. Somewhere else, then. There's nowhere else. I could stay with you. I'm going to the airport to get on a plane out of here. That guy'll come after me. I offered you a job. No one forced you. You don't give a shit. I just saved you. I don't owe you anything. You can have the car. I can't drive. Get out. Get out! Get out! Hey. Fuck off! It's Shay. Fully didn't recognize you. Where you going? Nowhere. Can I come? I saw a guy get killed. You okay? I think someone's after me. Who's lookin' out for you? Rocky will help. He looks after me. He'll love you. Yeah. I'll go get him. Lend me some ciggie money? I'll pay you back. You're a real friend. Don't move. Get in. I'm waiting for someone. Shay, get in. I met my first trick on this street. I was so scared. This big old man. I thought he was gonna have a heart attack on me. I promised myself, before I turned 30, I'd quit, move to Paris, reinvent myself. It's my birthday today. I've been fucking for money since I was 15. I want a new life. There's this guy. He doesn't know that I'm leaving, and I don't want him to. He can help us. Who is he? He's a cop. Don't worry, ladies. Safe as houses here. Take a load off. This is Bob's place. No secrets between him and me. Except where the bodies are buried. Good one. - Who's this? - Shay. We were on the job together. You see what happened? - He shot him in the head. - Who shot him? A cop named Bennett. He tried to kill us. He's after us, Michael. Where'd you park his car darlin'? We didn't say anything about a car. Gotcha. Mate, you got more bruises than a Queensland banana. I reckon your nose looks better on this side. Fonzie got busted! Laugh now, you fuckin' dog! Where's my car, cunt? Settle down. Get out of my way. You made enough mistakes tonight. Fuckin' settle down. Look at my suit. That bitch broke my fuckin' nose. - You can have the girl. - What do you care? Holly's mine. Oh, mate. She's a fuckin' whore. She's pissing off. Her place was empty. She's coming with me. No, no, look at her bag. I saw the ticket. Whores only love money. Everything else is an act. Back to the car. He was lying, Michael. I remember the first time I saw you. I arrested you just so I could hear your voice. I'm gonna believe you, Holly. We're rich enough to disappear. What about Shay? It's just you and me now. She's my friend. It's just you and me now. Look in my eyes and say yes. No. I can't. Tell me it wasn't all an act. Police! Police! Get in the car. Get in the car! Move! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the fucking gun! Drive, or I'll fucking kill you! Come on! Step on the fucking peddle. Come on! Faster! Come on! Come on! Come on! Faster! Holly. Okay. Holly. The case. It's just a scratch. You're still beautiful. What time's your flight? I'll never make it now. You've got to try. I'll call Harry. Who? The taxi driver. He's also an escape artist. It's ringing. Oh my God. Holly? Holly, lie down. Lie down. Just lie down. Tenir moi. Holly? Holly? Somebody help me! Help me! Somebody help me! Help me! I usually pull him out of a hat. You like me, don't you? Yeah. I want you to make me disappear.
