It is a beautiful summer day, and i don't know about you, But it looks like football's right around the corner. # Was a friday night football game # # Down at the high school stadium # # She was a cheerleader with her quarterback # # Sneaking out behind the bleachers to play # # 'Cause they don't care what people say # # In this town # Nothing ever changes in this town # # And the story's always the same one in this town # # And i thank you, lord, for keepin' us safe # # And i thank you, mother, for making us pray # Down in division iv, the big news is that Saint thomas aquinas welcomes its new head coach. Vince deantonio had a promising coaching career As offensive coordinator in the college ranks Until he abruptly resigned five years ago. # In this town Now, it'll be interesting to see what he can do With the knights, who haven't had a winning season Since 2004. Now, senior quarterback bobby burkett Has shown flashes of potential, But that team never has clicked. # And nothing ever changes in this town # # Oh the story's always the same one in this town # # And i thank you, lord, for keeping us safe # # And i thank you, mother, for making us pray # # There's an old man on a front porch swing # # And he's always talkin' to nobody # # But if you ever stop to listen # # You might learn a thing or two # # Yeah, i'm talking to you # You see, he once was a young man # # And he was holding a young girl's hand # # And they were walkin' down by the lake # # And about 1948 # And they had their first kiss # # Ooh, with the moon shining down # # And they knew true love # Oh, it really could be found in this town # # Oh, oh, in this town # Yeah, in this town Set. Hut! Come on, know your assignment! Hey, bobby. Yeah? What's the new coach doing way up there? I don't know, looking for a win? I know, man. Somebody needs a friend. All right! Let's go, guys, bring it in. Take a knee. Take a knee. Kroger, rooker, far goal post and back. Loser gets to go again and a hundred pushUps. Oh, man. Move it! Taylor, davis, currie, Burkett That's right. I've watched tape of every play you made Or didn't make in your miserable careers here at aquinas. Your nine losses last year. You seniors, fourYear starters, You lost 25 games here. How's it feel? Rucker! You quit on the way back. You're done for the day. Next time, you're done for the year. Your record says you stink, But i don't think it's true. I think your habits stink. And that's what i'm here to fix. We'll start with your conditioning. Kroger, give me the goal post rooker owes me. But i won, coach. And you won one lousy game last year. Don't start bragging about a wind sprint. We're gonna rebuild this program. It's not gonna be easy or fun. Guess be ready to go monday at 4:00. Start from scratch. Everybody has to earn their job. No incumbents. What about qb. Everybody. Bobby burkett's got a heck of an arm, coach. Nobody's job is locked. Copy that. On defense, we use our speed. We're gonna go to a 353. We don't have the size for anything else. We can do that, but i hope you have a plan To light up the scoreboard. We're gonna open up the playbook. Even if burkett delivers, we're a oneOption team. Napier's great... But i need another deep threat. We're gonna need to spread it out And throw downfield to beat these bigger teams. Well, that's all we have to work with, coach. Then i'm gonna have to find us some more horses. Holy cow, bill, it's like a sauna in here. Stop pointing that thing at me. It is august, you know. Will your heater be joining us for dinner again? I II know it's august... But by my calculations, It would have saved us $400 last winter. You don't say. I stand corrected. It feels like the garden of eden in here. That's good. I like that. I can be your bargaining director When you sell it to mr. Handon. The problem is i can't present something From my workshop, no matter how good it is. And a real prototype costs about $30,000. Mmm, mom's famous fried chicken. Could smell it from the drive. Hey. Hey, dad. Mm! Not till you clean up. What? Look, i'm starving. Coach deantonio kept us for an extra 45 minutes, you know? I don't know what his problem is. Why is it so hot in here? Well, give him a chance. He'll give up on the knights soon enough. Yeah, hardyHarHar, dad. Hello? Oh, hi, mr. Handon. Yes. Just a minute, please. You tell him we're about ready to have dinner. hello, mr. Handon. Bowling alley... again. No, that'sI can No, that won't Yeah I'llAll right, we'll just see you. GoodBye. Really? You don't have to drop everything Whenever that man calls. He is my boss. And maybe he will remember The favors when the time comes. Hello, sir. How you doing? Hi, how are you? II didn't know you were having guests. The damn pin setter is broken again, burkett. john was showing off With this girl that he fancies. Yeah, he takes after the old man. How's aquinas looking this year, bobby? I don't really follow d V. Well, actually, we're division iv, sir. Right. You know the way. I have to get ready for my guests. i know what you're thinking. Just save it. Vikings! Dad, what if i What if i told you Something that might, like, disappoint you? You can't, but go ahead. Well, i'm not so sure if i want to play football this year. That's a relief. I was afraid you might be pregnant. Hand me a 3/4. Yeah. Why don't you want to play? I don't know. I mean... There just doesn't seem to be a good enough reason. And the new coach... team still stinks. I'm just sick of losing. I'm proud of you for admitting it, Especially in this town. Yeah. But... If you're just discouraged, Why don't you just sleep on it? See how you feel after. Can you put these things in the... thing? Or is it too technical? Yeah. No, it's not too technical, dad. It's just you stutter every two seconds. Easy there. I'll get the bag. You go wash up. Are you sure you got it? Yeah. I don't usually like a rhubarb pie. You know, to me it's like a funky celery, you know? I mean, what is that? I don't even know what it is. I've neverYou ever seen a rhubarb plant? But this is really, Really quite good. Thank you. You know what? Hoover's a great school. They'd be lucky to have you.

Backer! Backer! Set, hut! Justin! Are you trying to break my quarterback? Sorry, coach. Sorry? What, are you gonna write that On his cast? Your job is to protect the quarterback, period. Got it? Got it. Coach, i want my quarterbacks practicing In red jerseys. Water break. Two minutes. So you can't catch, Too small to tackle anybody, And you're not very fast. Kinda limits what we can do with you. I mean, what position do you want to play, jamal? Maybe i could sling it? Be the backup qb, chillin' with the cheerleaders. Okay. Now, back here on earth, I mean, we've got to find a place for you. Coach wants us to find something for you to do. II don't know. Well... I, uh, i got an idea. Hut! Sorry, sorry.

Go long. Boom! Handon, get your car out of my spot. My bad, coach. Attention. Bill burkett please report To the conference room. Bill burkett to the conference room, please. Come on in, bill. Burkett. Steven tells me you have something for us. Uh, i've been working on a product An electric heater. It's not just an electric heater. It's the next generation. You did all this on your own? I have to admit, burkett, i am impressed. Tell me more. Sell me. Um, instead of the usual electric coils, It uses infrared bulbs to heat up copper elements. Uh, the number one selling point Is that it's not dry heat. There's nothing like it on the market. It feels like a heater. My wife says it's the best thing We've ever used on the farm. Your tester was your wife? I've run technical studies as well. Infrared uses about 30% less electricity. Let me show you. As you can see, the heat doesn't Just rise to the ceiling. It's evenly distributed. There's also safety. You know, conventional space heaters are the The number one cause of fires in the home, And infrared is significantly safer. How much would we have to sell this for? The initial price point would be about $500. $500 for a space heater? Really? We sell one that costs $60. All due respect, sir, that's like comparing a... Rolls royce to a golf cart. I've heard enough, burkett. I think you know my answer. That'll be all, bill. You need to get back to work. Bill... What are you doing? He said no, didn't he? Bill? He... dismissed it. Like it... was a joke. We're in this together. Don't you ever, ever forget that. Besides, there are other manufacturers in ohio, Aren't there? Here we go, knights, here we go. Whoo, let's go, knights! Yeah! Come on, boys. Let's go. Set! Gold 78. Hut! Damn it, damien. Ugh. Field goal unit. Tie this baby up. Let's go. Let's go! Set, hut! Oh I knew this was gonna happen. All right, fellas, pick your heads up. Played a football game tonight. Some good things out there. You guys were physical, and you worked hard. We just didn't execute in the key moments. So we run. Ryan, seriously? Running, after a game. A little hard work never hurt anybody. It's gonna be a long season. So little johnny handon, huh? Not bad. Oh, don't give me "little johnny handon. " He had wilson in the end zone twice and missed him. We could have had six touchdowns. He can still throw a long pass, brother. Yeah, but it's not gonna do any good Unless the line holds out. I mean, this isn't gonna work At the state championship. Cranberry soda, huh? Yup. Refreshing. Cool and delicious. How 'bout davis? Davis is good. Who are those guys? The hoover faithful. High school football fanatics. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Well, who they gonna put in the middle, jackson? Oh... Jackson has done a good job. Jackson wears a skirt. Jackson has done a good job.

I'm just... yo, check it out. Johnny "mr. Perfect" handon wasn't so perfect, was he? We finally made the paper. Yeah, baby, about time. Hey. Check it out. Local inventor bill burkett. It's your dad, bobby. Yeah. Sci manufacturing announced That they will initially be hiring 500 workers in the next quarter for the manufacture Of a revolutionary space heater. With the addition of these 500 new jobs, Sci is poised to surpass the handon corporation As the largest manufacturer in stark county. Bill, can i speak to you for a minute? I didn't think you'd be back to work With a big contract and all. They don't pay me till they start the manufacture. I know renee has become friendly with your son, so... Makes this even more difficult. What are you trying to say? In these economic times We're faced with difficult decisions every day. It's with great reluctance that we are forced to determine That your position's no longer needed. Cut the crap. We both know what this is really about. Mayor, it's my understanding that sci is continuing With their plan for the factory expansion. All i know is that they've promised A minimum of 500 new jobs. You and i are friends, aren't we, mayor? You like playing golf at my club. You like my fundraisers, don't you? I want you to delay their permits. That's That's not feasible. I believe my generous donations to the community And your campaign prove that i am a good citizen. And as a good citizen, all i'm asking for Is some help from my elected official. Mr. Bill burkett? Sharon, they're suing me. They fired me, and now... Handon is claiming... Intellectual ownership. They want to take the heater by court order. What can we do to fight it? Unfortunately... There's no way we can get involved Until the rights are free and clear. You should talk to an attorney friend of mine. She can help you. Can i get an advance? I'm sorry, bill. Okay. Bobby, renee's here. Hi, mrs. B. Hi. Don't worry, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. It's all gonna work out. Yeah, everything's gonna be fine. Have fun. Hi. Hey. You look nice. Yeah? Are you ready? I think the movie starts at 7:10. Yeah... You know, iI don't I don't I don't feel like going to the movies. Is that cool? Yeah, that's fine. Want to go for a walk? Come on, mr. Grumpy pants, we're going for a walk. It's so peaceful out here. Why do you hang out with all those jerks? 'Scuse me? Golden boy handon and those dumbass cheerleaders. Let's just forget about them. Your season started to turn around, You've been playing great. Do you have any idea how many kids Would kill to be in your shoes right now? You know... My father worked as hard as anyone ever could. And right when he was on the verge of success, Some lawyer shows up and crushes his dreams. Just like that, that's all it took. Just one piece of paper, and crushed everything. So what's it worth? I mean, all of our dreams Are just going to come crashing down. Did you know that i volunteer down at the y on saturdays For this special needs cheer squad? Those kids are amazing. They're never gonna be doctors Or lawyers. That doesn't stop them from doing what they love. They always remind me That everyone has their special talent. It's the lucky ones that know what it is already. The rest of us, we have to find it, we have to discover it. You have a godGiven gift, bobby. Just... Enjoy this moment. No matter where it's taking you. Come on. Come on. Come on. You're so grumpy. You're back with sam bourquin here on 1480 whbc, Live and local, the sports powerhouse in canton, ohio. What a beautiful day. Temperatures in the 60s. And i don't know about you, But i'm ready for a little football. And you know, we've been watching The st. Thomas aquinas football team Become the little team that could. In his first season, new head coach vince deantonio Seems to have really gotten to these kids And lit a fire under that team. # White picket fence but things are looking up # # Happiness is a good league hence # # But things are looking up # The sting reminded me at least it seems to be # # That i am fiery and must be burning burning # # Upon the wind you take your medicine # # Whether i lose or win This bobby burkett to damien taylor connection Has finally started to click. Along with ben napier, Aquinas has become a highOctane offense Firing on all cylinders. # But things are looking up # # A hard old rain is falling down # # But things are looking up # # I'm in a pile of leaves and i got no rake # # But things are looking up # # Reminding me at least it seems to be # # That i am fiery and must be burning burning # And after a 1 and 9 season a year ago, They are rocketing up the standings. What's even more amazing Is the last time st. Thomas aquinas made the playoffs, Most of you weren't even born yet. It's been almost 20 years. # Never promised we'd play fair # Bam. This injunction hearing is before just a judge, There's no jury. But we have to win, Because once the judge makes his ruling It's very unlikely he'll change it during a trial. You're gonna be great, bill. All rise. This court is now in session. The honorable edward j. Elum presiding. Thank you. Good morning. You may be seated, please. The matter before the court is plaintiff's motion For injunctive relief. Mr. Jannings, representing the plaintiff, will go first, And then mr. Burkett will have his say. And most importantly, it is clearly spelled out In the employee's contract, As you can see in paragraph 27. This is our intellectual property clause. It covers any inventions or ideas developed While under the employment of the handon corporation. Can you please tell the judge How you came up with the idea for the edenpure heater? Well, my wife nancy Always gets cold feet in winter. Wears socks to bed. I was fixing plumbing in our house, And had left a stack of copper piping Near the heater in the workshop. The next day i realized they were radiating heat, And i knew that copper would be a key component. For a heat source i used farlnfrared. It has a wavelength of longer than 15 microns. So i built a crude prototype, And it worked Better than i expected. The entire room was heated From ceiling to floor. We used this heater all winter, And it was great. Most importantly, My wife's feet weren't cold anymore. That was a charming story, mr. Burkett, But i need evidence. Judge, i don't think Mr. Burkett, you can step down. Now that i've heard all the testimony, You will receive my formalized opinion by the end of the month. This court is adjourned. Want to see me, coach? Mr. Burkett. Sit down. So what, am i in trouble? You know, i never had any doubt about your ability. I was worried about your motor. Whether you had what it takes to be a leader. But you surprised me. So i sent a tape of you over to coach bowden at akron u. That'sThat's probably a waste of time. You really think that? Well, i don't know. They got a pretty good program. Well, i think you're more than good enough to play there. Wait, are you Are you kidding me? I don't kid. Get outta here. Is that bobby again? Don't worry, i'll tell him. Look, i know i'm asking a lot here. But there's this lawsuit, and it's complicated. Now it's just for a time. I mean, you have to try to understand that I'm never gonna understand, dad. You've always told me to follow my heart, But i guess you just forgot the "it's complicated" part, right? # You can put a stick in my spokes # # I can be the butt of your jokes # # I can be the laughin' stock # # I can be the hoax # But i ain't gonna lose you # # No i ain't You shouldn't be here. Renee... Bobby, just go home, okay? You're gonna get me in trouble. Look, i just want to hear it from you, okay? You don't understand, This just isn't a good time for me right now. You're right. I don't understand. Because last i checked, you told me to enjoy the moment And how am i supposed to do that without you? You're gonna wake my dad. I don't care. Wake your old man up. # Gonna lose you I'm sorry. # No i ain't # Gonna lose you Now, you tell me to walk away, and i'll walk away. # I can't stand # The thought of another man # I just need to hear it from you. Tell me what you want, renee. Bobby... I'm sorry, i have to go. Set, hut! Yeah! Whoo! The big football news was bobby burkett, Quarterback of st. Thomas aquinas Going for five touchdowns.

It was in a dusty book. a very dusty book. You did a good job. No matter what happens, you You brought pride back to this community. All credit to these kids, father. Mm. WhatWhat do you think of this whole talk About a game of champions? It's just a bunch of media hype. What's in the box? I've gotten more calls about us playing hoover Than i did when the pope came to detroit in '87. I think there's more to it than just hype. You're enjoying this, aren't you? Really. David and goliath. Hello. Well, i'm sorry i missed the game, sport. I had to take care of a little problem with the new factory. I heard you were terrific, though. I'm not surprised. You're a handon, johnny. And handons don't lose. All right. I'll be home soon. Mr. Handon? Mitch doran, from the repository. Of course. How you doing, mitch? Good. Thank you. Kind of late for an interview. Well, actually, I wanted to ask you a question about your trip to mexico. According to your flight plan, This was your sixth flight to juarez in the past three months. Are the rumors true that you're Planning on moving your manufacturing to mexico? This is gonna have a major impact on the local economy. Mitch, where in the world Did you hear that scurrilous nonsense? It's just ridiculous. I wouldn't print that if i were you. You're on the record, mr. Handon. What do you want to say about this accusation? Good to see you, mitch. Shut the damn door. Mm. Delicious. donde esta renee? I don't know. No. En espanol, hijo, por favor. No se donde renee esta. Bueno. She better not be with bobby burkett. I'll kill him. Can we please just have one meal Where we don't talk about a burkett? Both of you? Do you hear they're saying he's as good as me? Can you believe it? I mean, the whole town's talking about us Playing each other if we both win our divisions, In some, uh, game of champions. I'd give anything to bury that punk. So let me get this straight. You're saying you would be in favor Of a game of champions, mr. Handon? Well, sam, I know it's highly irregular To propose a game of this magnitude. But i also know That in these hard economic times, Every school, every art department, Every athletic program is struggling just to get by. What i propose is a postSeason charity event Which will help us to raise muchNeeded funds For our children and their futures. And my company is willing to make a donation Of $100,000 to the school that wins this charity game. Yes! What a remarkable ride it has been for st. Thomas aquinas. Bobby burkett has been tearing up the playoffs, And the knights are one win away... From both the division iv state title and the game of champions. All they have to do is beat the falcons. But not to be outdone, john handon has led the vikings Into the division i finals For the third time in the last four years. This better be important. I'm in the middle of my game. Have you seen the newspaper? Let me guess. "Handon corp. Pulling out all stops for game of champions. " I paid our pr agency for frontPage placement. It is the front page, only it's you. The factory move to mexico. What do you want to do about this? We need to stay on message with this. I got a big, shiny game of champions to sell. Whoo! You okay? You don't look so hot. Must've been something i ate. I'll be ready, coach. Welcome. Welcome. Tomorrow is a big day for aquinas. And i hear there's a football game. We're here to give praise and to ask for his blessings. We all know struggle. And some of us have struggled more than others. I'd like to read a passage that i've been saving For a special occasion like this. Taken from st. Paul's first letter to the corinthians. Be on your guard. Stand firm in the faith. Be courageous. Be strong. And... Beat the pants off the falcons. I gotta say, coach, I never thought i'd see the day That we were in the state finals. Yeah, i knew it the whole time. Think fast. This is vince. Mr. Napier, is he any better? Thanks for letting me know. That was ben's dad. Fever's up to 102. No go. Well, i hope it's not all through the locker room. Hello? Coach wilfork. Hello? Stomach flu? Oh, no. 10! 10, 22, blue, 11! Blue, 11! Hut! Go! Time out, time out! Time out! This is our last shot. It's just they're tired out, coach, you gotta put me in. Justin, look at yourself. You shouldn't even be here. Get outta here.

All right. All right, good fight. Good game. Good work. I didn't do it. You left it on the field. Good work. God, i wish we could've played hoover. Yeah, man. Me too. Now, despite half of their team being out with the flu, The knights almost pulled out that state championship game. Now, in the later game yesterday, The vikings rolled to a 3110 victory. Hold on, we have a caller on the hotline. It's coach vince deantonio of st. Thomas aquinas. Coach, sorry about your loss. How you doing? Well, that was a tough one. I'm not gonna make any excuses. But we still want hoover. Well, it was supposed to be A game of champions. And we didn't take care of business against alliance park, I'll give you that. But if hoover wants a real football game, They know where to find it. Well, between the rumors of a factory move And the handon corp. Lawsuit, This is one town that is ready for a showdown. This is a lovely place you have here, bill. Just lovely. Would be a real shame to lose it. Look, bill, we both know how this is gonna Play out in court. But it's not too late. We can still put this behind us. All right, listen, i'll tell you what. You can have your old job back, And i'll even give you a piece of the heater sales. No hard feelings. All you have to do is just sign our contract. Mr. Ha Handon. I think you You know my answer. Well, you can't say i didn't try. I'll see you in court. Good morning. I have reviewed the evidence, Including your ironclad employment agreement. That alone seems to make my decision clearCut. The defendant, mr. Burkett, Has presented no evidence to prove otherwise. However, upon closer inspection, I looked at one indisputable fact. Bill burkett offered his heater to the handon corporation first, And you turned him down. The court denies the plaintiff's motion for an injunction. Your honor, you can't And the court rules in favor of the defendant. Your honor, there's You are no longer entitled to take advantage of your employees Or this community. This matter is concluded. All rise. You won. This court is now adjourned. bill...

My name is sam bourquin, and i'm alongside My colleague tonight, former stark county Junior college placeKicker mike "the motor mouth" mayhew. Well, it's a perfect night for football, sam. I mean, the stadium is packed, i'm smelling popcorn, Hot dogs, testosterone. While hoover has always had a lot of community support, There sure seems to be a lot of black and gold in the stands. Tonight's game is being sponsored by A generous contribution from the handon corporation, And tonight's winning team gets a $100,000 donation. i cannot wait to crush aquinas And put an end to this foolishness once and for all. Well, for me, sam, they might as well Just make that check out to hoover right now. I mean, this is kind of like me against my exWife In divorce court, and i'm aquinas. All right, fellas, real quick, listen up. You guys have all heard the radio chatter, You've read the papers. Except you, kroger. I don't think you can read yet, can you? Now, the experts say we don't have a chance. Right? Only one way to shut everybody up... win. That was your best speech ever, coach. Well, i got a friend here who wants to say hello to you. He knows a little bit about beating the odds. Joe. No way. Who's that dude? That's broadway joe. Joe namath. All right, fellas, i've been hearing A lot about you guys. Saint thomas aquinas, underdogs, right? Well, i tell you what. I know a thing or two about being an underdog. In the biggest game in the world for us, We were 18Point underdogs. 18Point underdogs. But looky here. I tell you what, fellas. If there's one thing i ever learned from football, It's that you never, ever give up. No matter what happens out there tonight, You don't give up. Look at me, man. I came from a small town, Just like you guys are coming from. We won the world championship The super bowl Because we believed in ourselves. Don't give up. Believe in yourselves, And you can do it! Yeah! Yeah! All right. All right, guys, let's bow our heads. Father? Heavenly father, watch over us, Protect us from injury, And give us strength. Give me some points on special teams. Amen. amen. Coach deantonio did a fantastic job this season, But hoover's coach morlow has six first team AllConference players, Including his stellar quarterback, john handon iii. Aquinas is really gonna need a gut check Just to prove that they even belong On the same field with these vikings, sam. Well, we're about to find out Just moments away from kickoff As the teams take the field for tonight's coin toss. Little bobby burkett. You're dead. You just don't know it yet. We'll see. Don't even look at her, farm boy. You know, you already lost her. You just don't know it. Heads. Defer. Hoover wins the toss, And they have elected to kick. Well, the winning has already begun. All right, this is what we worked for. yeah! This is what we want. yeah! So let's get it done, huh! And the ball is in the air, and we are underway. Finley fields the ball at the 4, Looks for a lane, makes a cut, And is brought down at the 18 yard line. That lane turned into a wall awfully fast, sam. Number 12, bobby burkett, leads his offense onto the field For their first possession. Number 84, star receiver ben napier, Lines up wide to the left. I think burkett's gonna have to Toss that potato tonight, sam, Or he's gonna get mashed by this hoover defense. Red 18. Napier goes into motion. Red 18. Hut! And it's a pitchOut. Napier blasted by a hoover defender. The ball is loose, and hoover recovers at the 9 yard line. I'm gonna tell you, napier looks nervous. I mean, that linebacker was in the backfield Like someone waiting at a baggage claim. Break. Handon brings his team To the line of scrimmage Behind his massive offensive line. I don't think one of these offensive road graders Is under 260 pounds. Single back! Single back! This is gonna be a whole lot easier Than i thought. Set. Hut! Hut, hut, hut! Handon takes the snap. He drops back And hits his tight end for about five yards Right over the middle. That's his cousin, bart handon. And you know, these two have hooked up For 14 touchdowns this season. Green opposite. Green opposite. Set. Hut. Handon fakes a handOff, rolls out the the left, And walks into the end zone untouched. Yes! Are you kidding me? I can't believe that. They need bobby burkett to play both sides of the field here. Oh, is that it? Yeah. Last week you were antiBurkett. He's the best player out there. I wish he would marry my daughter. Oh, if he married your dau Please. Guys. Make room for michelle. Play smart. Play tough. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing? Good. How are they doing? Not so good right now. After a short pass to napier, Aquinas is looking at third and 7. Number 24, damien taylor, is lined up to the left. Hut! Burkett takes the snap. Taylor runs a downAndln. Burkett throws it. Incomplete. would have been a first down. Well, it hit him in a bad spotRight in the hands. Damien taylor, a transfer this year To saint thomas aquinas, should have really made that catch. Well, you know, he's shown flashes Of bigPlay potential all season, But it's drops like this that have been an issue. break. If aquinas doesn't figure something out, This could get very ugly very fast. Hut! Yes! Hoover's defense has been suffocating. Come on, ref! Reggie streeter has been All over the field. I mean, he's going through 'em Like they're particle board. That's why they call him "buzzsaw. " Handon is feeling it now. He hits his tight end For their third touchdown of the game. This is where you're seeing the difference In size and speed Between division i and division iv teams. I mean, i'm happy for this game, But this is a complete mismatch. Ooh, another dropped pass by damien taylor. Burkett's gotta figure something out. BenBen, come on, man, you gotta get open. I know, man, i'm trying. I got no room. Look, i know they're doubleTeaming you out there. Just find a spot, okay? Just throw it long. I'll be there, all right? Aquinas is looking at a second and 3, And down 210. Set. Yellow 89. Set, hut! Burkett takes the snap... Looks to his left at napier, who makes a great cut, And hits him on the slant. Napier takes it in for a touchdown. Yeah! All right, saint thomas is lining up for the extra point. The ball is snapped... and hoover blocks the kick. And it is halftime here at the game of champions. I'm pleased to welcome hallOfFamer joe namath Into the broadcast booth. Joe, thanks so much for coming in today. How you doing? Oh, man, I'm happy to be here, sam. I understand that you and coach deantonio, You guys go back quite a ways, don't you? Well, i've known vince since he was a pipsqueak. And i'll tell you what, when he called, man, There was no way i was gonna miss this. You think they're gonna be able to get back Into this thing at all? You know, i was a quarterback for a while, And i know part of the job is Instilling confidence in your team. I can tell you, i got through to these guys. I looked 'em in the eyes and, uh I know they believe in themselves. Well, it may take a little bit more than that. Yeah, well, never underestimate the heart. This team's not gonna go away. The knights are gonna be in this game Till the last whistle. All right, there you have it. Legendary quarterback joe namath He believes saint thomas can get back into this thing In the second half. They're playing dirty out there. And the refs ain't calling nothin'. I don't want to hear that. Nobody cares who cheats you. Whoever makes the most plays wins. Defense, 11 men tackle the ball. Ends and backs, i need you to fight your routes hard, Even when i don't call your number. You're gonna be telling this story 20 years from now to your kids. How do you want it to end? Bring it in. Pack your guards. Control the line now. Come on. Bring it in. Bring it in. You guys gotta savor this. One, two, three. knights! If you're just tuning in, the knights are down 216, Despite a great talk by legendary quarterback Joe namath. Well, you know, joe namath Could be on that field tonight Playing for the knights. It would still be 216. Hoover is that good. 340... It's third and short As handon lines up under center. defense, defense... Defense. Hut! He hands off to bower, Who's met at the line of scrimmage By jordan kroger. Aquinas is finally getting some pressure on handon. Let's go, hoover! They are three divisions lower than us. You are the champions. Let's prove it! Yeah! Bring it in! Yeah! We gotta take out big mack So we can get to burkett once and for all. What do you want me to do about it? Fat boy's got a temper. Light the fuse. Red 22. Red 22. Hut! Burkett takes the snap, drops back And fires to napier. Incomplete. That should have been a late hit. I don't see a flag. You better stay down, If you know what's good for you. oh, big man. Is that all you got, boy? Come on, Show me what you got. Hey, justin, keep your head. Come on. Come on. Huh? Huh? Huh? What are you looking at, ref? Let's go. Oh, big boy, fat man, come and get it. Aah! Don't touch my cousin! Get this little psycho off me! Stay down, bully! That can't be legal. Got your back, cuz. Now, this is a first. A holder had been ejected from a game for fighting. All 140 pounds of him. Let's show these guys what we're made of. Yeah! Well, the knights are definitely playing Like a different team this half. You know, they really are, sam. I'm glad to see them playing With some heart, finally. Hut! Bobby burkett hits napier on a screen and... Justin mack just knocked buzzsaw... And napier takes it in for the touchdown. Wow. Set... Handon takes the snap, And kroger gets into the backfield To bat the ball away. Damn it! Hoover is lining up for a 41Yard field goal. The kick is up and good, Giving the vikings an 11Point lead With 4:34 left in the third quarter. Streeter has it... At the 16 yard line. Hey, man, you hit like a 10YearOld girl. Set. Hut! Well, the knights have narrowed the score to four now. It's 2420. And you know what? Neither team has a time out left, So buckle your seat belts, folks. We maybe actually having a game of champions after all. I right, 23 iso. I right, 23 iso. One on one. Ready... break. Well, with 1:36 left in the game, And the clock is running, hoover has a second down and six, Still up by four points. 320, hut!

It's third and 4, with another shot At a first down. Handon is in no hurry As the clock continues to wind down. You know, if the hoover vikings get this first down, The hot dog is out of the bun. Red 80. Red 80. Hut, hut. Handon fakes a handOff. He rolls right. The defenders converge, and handon slides. Wait a minute, he's short! Well, it looks like hoover is going to have to Punt the football away. In the first half, Handon would have run right through those guys. My, my, my, how things have changed. Well, there's no way to stop the clock, And the knights have a long field to go. The ball was snapped and the punt is away. Finley calls for the fair catch. He steps away as the ball lands Inside the 5 No, that's a touchback! Wow, hoover almost pinned the knights inside the 1. Then the cheese would have been off the pizza.

No, no, to the 40 now, across midfield. Out of bounds at the hoover 43. That's a very gutsy call by deantonio. I'm actually starting to love this guy. Aquinas, to me. Quick, quick, let's go. All right, everybody in the stadium knows We're going to napier. They've been doubling him, Tripling him all night, all right? So we're gonna use you as a decoy. We run a backside fly to damien, Who is going to make a play. O line, expect all kinds of pressure. Get it to me, man. I'll get loose, coach, i swear. He's our guy, coach. He's good. He can do it.
