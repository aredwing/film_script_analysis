Late again, huh? Idiot. Do you have memories of when you were three? If it were of something extraordinary? Such as... Such as huge frozen waterfalls? No. No, neither do I... The Note Does it bother you when the other kids call you that? Maybe you'd like to answer back, but you can't. You think they're making fun of you. Doctor, did you choose those pictures? Yes, my friend Ellie took them. Do you like them? Thank you, Don Jose. Thank you. What an appetite, Alicia! None for you, Lupita, You're on a diet. Always the gentleman, Augusto. Alone on your birthday. So, there is justice in this world. - Estela, I... - No, forget it. I only came to give you this. She lives in Aguascalientes. Aguascalientes? I always imagined she was in Canada. You imagined a lot of things, Augusto. I don't know if she'll speak to you. I told her things. We really hurt each other, Augusto. Now we're old. I don't want that on my conscience. Yes? Esme. I'm glad you came. Look what I got. It's for your box! You've reached 2920941. We're not home right now. Please, leave a message. Ines, it's me, your father, Augusto. Well, it's been a while since... we last spoke... I mean... Years... Remember when we went to Niagara Falls and they were frozen? You were so worried about the fish and you told me... The Popocatepetl volcano is in phase two: Yellow. Do you have memories of when you were three? If it were of something extraordinary? Such as... huge frozen waterfalls? No, neither do I. Sorry... Pardon me, Ivan, I didn't see you. Don't worry, I've got other things on my mind, too. Say hello to Ellie for me. Yes, certainly. Esmeralda! Esmeralda! There she is... Here comes... Ra xi ja. Oh, Nana don't talk nonsense. It'll make it worse. Just try to rest. Good morning, ladies. It's an old black wallet. I haven't seen it. And the girl who works here? Maybe she's seen it. Esmeralda? No, I doubt she can help. Thank you. Why are we going to the diner? I'm working this afternoon and Mrs. Gonzalez is sick. - Can I have chop suey...? - Esmeralda, Remember me? The waterfalls. Yes, the waterfalls. Is this your little sister? Are these magic beanstalks? - Let's go, Lina. - Esmeralda, the other day, when I left the diner I think I forgot my wallet. It's black. - I haven't seen it. - I need to find it, urgently... It's very important. If you see it, please... Yes. The name is Ines Gabrieli. In Aguascalientes. No? How about Ines del Real? Thank you. Hello? It's Ines you called. Yes, your mother gave me this number. I thought you didn't see each other anymore... We don't. What, the great reconciliation? No, she just gave me your number. Why did you call? Because... I'm your father. - A man answered the first time... - Pablo, my boyfriend. I have a daughter. Her name's Mariana, she's fifteen. They say she looks like me. Who knows. Sometimes I think she's the only thing worthwhile thing that's happened. Ines... - I... - You know what? The truth is I don't even know why I called. I have to go. Don't call me again. Pick me up at six? You're a doctor, right? Yes. Is it true migraines go away with the snow? Where did you ever hear that? No, it's not true. Cordoba Diner? Yes. Yes, ginger noodles. C block, apartment 222. Okay, we'll send it right over. Bye. The Seahorse - Don't you want to? - No, not now. Nice? Where are you going? I forgot to feed the horses. If I'd known they'd get you out of bed at this hour, I wouldn't have given them to you. Sure you would. Shit. Gross!! Ivan. Ivan. We have mice. Ivan, are you listening? What should we do? - Get a cat. - No fucking way. Ivan. - Ivan! - Fumigate. We already tried that. The sons of bitches came back. What a mouth on you, Ellie. What will our children think? We're not going to have children. Not at this rate... Oh come on, I'm only teasing. Look, when our kids are like two, I'll speak like a proper lady. You'll see. Come on. - You're crazy. - Come on, let's go. What's that? - I don't know. - What do you want it to be? An airplane. You want an airplane? What? As crazy as ever. Fine. Rotten. Because they're all idiots, including the teacher. It's easy to give advice all the way from Canada, isn't it Juventino? What idea? Why can't you tell me now? Yeah, I'll pick it up tomorrow. I said yes, how else would I pay the rent? Ok, bye. Now the tail, and voila! An airplane for Ellie. There it goes. Lina. Lina. I told you not to stick these on the wall. The princess... Nana, stop talking nonsense. - But, she looks so pretty. - There's nothing there! Almost done. Does it hurt? Yeah? Well, we're almost done. Press here. Good. That's it. Good job, you're a brave little cowboy. This flu worries me, he's had it too long. Okay, CowboY now, get dressed. You can't just disappear for three months without telling me. Tomas had business. I wasn't about to call you every day from Boston. This is about Diego's health. You have to be more responsible. Oh, Like you? What do you mean? You never told me anything. How was I supposed to know? You could have asked. It's probably nothing, but... I'll have the results... Why don't you take me out to dinner instead? This is an anti-histamine. - Give him 2.5 mg every 12 hours... - Ivan. No Paola, no. It's over and that's it. I've been thinking. I think it's better if we don't see each other. I'll make arrangements to see Diego. We'll see. - Just like that? - Yes. It's for the best. For him, for you and for me. Don't speak for me. Don't you dare speak for me. Look Ivan, I know my left and right. Let's see. Great job, Cowboy. Now we just need to tie them. I'm going to tie all four ends together. - No, no! - Give me a kiss. Look what I've got for you. Close your eyes. Keep them closed, don't peak. One, two and... three. Yeah. Let's go. From the ocean. Now, Diego. Next. Next. Can you give me the money from my brother? His name is Juventino Morales. He sent it from Canada. Idiot. You should've heard me, I screamed like a lunatic. This is serious, Ivan, they're even in my darkroom. Fabiana offered us a cat, but I hate cats. Maybe I should buy some traps. Yeah. What do you mean "yeah"? What do you want me to say? I want you to listen to me. Ivan, what's the matter? Look, I'm working. I have to go. Good-bye, Ellie. - Sorry. - Pardon me, Ivan. I didn't see you. Don't worry. I've got other things on my mind, too. Say hello to Ellie for me. Yes, certainly. You know, it's pretty common. It's all over the tabloids: Four out of ten men are in the same boat. It's not that he can't get it up. He's lost all interest. - Zero sex drive. - Just like that. Zero. So, you're always the horny one? Shit, I'm losing interest myself. No way, Ellie just because Ivan's screwed up you can't lose interest. Just get on with your life. That's easy to say. But, it's pretty fucked up when your boyfriend won't even look at you when you walk naked in front of him. I can imagine. You should sit him down and make him face the issue. You have to talk with him. Yeah. What? - Is he kicking? - Yes. Hello, Teresa. Good afternoon. Is Paola home? Yes, she's out back with her plants. - And... - She's alone. Cowboy's home too. - Should I call her? - No, that's alright, thanks. Hi, Cowboy. Hello, Ivan. - What are you doing? - Drawing. Looks nice. It's a face. Yes. I have to go talk with your mom. Will you show me your drawings later? - Okay. - Give me a kiss. Paola. Paola. And to what do I owe this surprise? Why are you crying, Mommy? No, I'm not crying. I'm laughing, it's just... Ivan was telling me the funniest joke. Stay there. Let's play airplane. Oh, Zacarias. Xi'nu... xi'nu... The princess... No! Don't close them! What princess? You won't even see the volcano with all that smog. Dear Esmeralda, how are you, sis? I'm writing to tell you that Zacarias and I have a plan. Don Fer is looking for help in his shop. And we think it would be a good job for you. With all three of us here, we could save up for the house. Lina could stay with her cousins in Mexico State. We'll send for her and Nana later. I don't want to go alone. - What, Lina? - People get robbed in Mexico State. I saw it on TV. Don't be silly. You're more likely to get robbed here. I want to be with you. Well, I don't. I can't take care of you all the time. It's not just the past two weeks, I'm talking about A year. A whole-fucking-year! You avoid our problems, hoping they'll just go away. Well, they won't. They're still here. Like the fucking rats. Mice. Mice. Have you ever asked yourself why you can't get it up with me? Stop it, Ellie. It's worth asking, don't you think? - I'm not overreacting. - Stop it! I'm sure it doesn't happen to you with other women. How long do you think I can take this? How do you know I'm not off fucking the first guy...? Stop it! And the most ironic part is it's not even about the sex. I think it would be better for both of us to separate. Don't speak for me. You're right. I won't speak for you. I'll speak for myself. I want you to go. Nana, I'm leaving. I'm going with Juventino and Zacarias. I'll make lots of money, aren't you glad? Nana? Look, I'll send you cash through Mrs. Gonzalez each month. You'll be fine. Besides, you like Mrs. Gonzalez, don't you? Why are you ignoring me? Well, I don't care. I don't want to stay! Fani says the snow will get rid of the pain. Then we're screwed, because there's no snow here. Who'll take care of you there? Who? - Congratulations. - Thank you. Not bad at all, huh? Ellie, congratulations. It's amazing. Thanks, Mariana. See you later. What's wrong? - You look... - Like shit? He's not here, is he? You didn't invite him. Of course not. - Obviously. - Thanks. - You're acting like my mom. - Mom schmom. Here come's your other casanova. You two look lovely. Thank you. - Hi. - Hello. I'll call you. - You're a doctor, right? - Yes. Is it true migraineS go away with the snow? Who ever told you that? No, it's not true. Cordoba Diner. Yes. Ginger noodles. C Block, apartment 222. The Arrow Your mom should call the doctor about that cough. What are you doing? It's your mom! Doctor, did you chose those pictures? Yes, my friend Ellie took them. Do you like them? They lie. Lies aren't always bad, Clara. Sebastian, what are you doing here? I told you not to bother me when I'm with somebody. No, no kisses! What will Clara think? Don't worry, he won't bite. He likes children. Look. He's been in the water. His ears are wet. Calm down. Yes, this is Clara. You hadn't met her, had you? She likes wearing bandanas, just like you. Calm down, Sebastian. Clara and you will be great friends. Right, Clara? Cowboy, you know your mom doesn't want you touching that. Hello? Yes, sir. I'll let her know. Goodbye. Excuse me your husband called. He won't be home for dinner. Thank you, Tere. You're such a child, Paola. It's pathetic. Maybe, but not as pathetic as you and your little girlfriends. You're not denying it? No, I'm not. Great. Then we're even. I've got someone who really loves me. This isn't a soap opera, Paola. You don't have the slightest idea what "love" means. And you do? I loved you. - Hello, Teresa. - Good afternoon. Is Paola home? Yes, she's out back with her plants. - And... - She's alone. Cowboy's home too. - Should I call her? - No, that's alright, thanks. I got the test results yesterday. I consulted with a specialist. It's leukemia. It's still in the early stages. Paoline. Don't call me Paoline. I'll be with him, with you, through it all. We don't need your help. Thank you. Paola. Calm down. There's a doctor, my neighbor. His office is in Felix Cuevas. He's a psychologist. Augusto Gabrieli. He might be able to help you. He'll pull through, we have to have believe that. Why are you crying, Mommy? No, I'm not crying. I'm laughing, it's just... Ivan was telling me the funniest joke. Weren't you? Stay there, let's play airplane. Let's fly, in the sky... I can't talk now. I'll call you later. Why don't you go in with him? He says he'd rather go in alone. He's in short-term chemo, isn't he? Don't worry, it barely even hurts. I was a little scared too, at first. Do you like it? It's for you. - Clara Castellanos! - That's me! Home delivery. For a Mister... Gabrieli. Can you go? No way. I'll pay you. Come in. Here you go. Keep the change. - Are those the waterfalls? - What? The ones that froze. Do you like them? Here I don't need it anymore. You busted my wheel. It's not my fault, a woman in front cut me off. I didn't see her. - It wasn't my fault. - You think you own the street. Please go away. No. Look, let me tell you something. Every day at two o'clock the city is paralyzed by mommies who won't let their kids walk a measly two blocks. Look, you little fucking brat, get out of my fucking way or go to hell, hear me? God damn fucking traffic. You're not supposed to say fuck. For Christ's sake Diego, shut up. I'm sorry, honey. I don't know what came over me. Look... Look what I have. Do you want it? I'll leave it here for you. They really did a job with this, but we'll fix it good as new. You'll see. And, to top it off, just because I like you. You see? Here, I found it. I didn't steal it. Thank you. Aren't you going to count your money? I'm no crook. No, you're not a crook. I thought you said it was important? Not anymore. Why did you return it? I don't know. Well, I'm going to Canada with my brothers. Canada? Your sister will like it there. I'm going alone. I'll send for her later. You don't look too happy. Neither do you. No. Neither do I. But, I'm old. It'll be fine, Lina. You've got money just in case. Uncle Rafa will pick you up in Toluca. His address is in the notebook. I'll buy you some cool Sneakers when I get paid. I don't want sneakers. Lina. Here. So you'll remember me. Doctor Gabrieli? I don't have an appointment, but I was told you... I don't know who gave you my name but I'm no longer seeing patients. Please. It's very important. I don't think I can help your son. It's not for my son. It's for me. Even less. I don't know if you can help. But I do know I'll never ask for help again. He's five years old and, in five years, I haven't learned to be a mother. Madam, trust me, if I could, I would help you. But right now, I'm... the least helpful person you'll find. Your son is very young. Young enough to forgive you. The Box Esmeralda, is that you? What's wrong? Have you got a migraine? I know how you feel. I used to get them, too. My Nana said snow would make it go away. But she's crazy. Sometimes, crazy people make sense. That's what Lina says, she said, in Fani's world, there's nothing but snow, and we have to take her there because here her bones hurt and there they don't. Your little sister is very wise. I have something of yours. It's a note with a number on it. Why would you want that? Anyway, you've probably had more use for it than I have. Who's Ines? She's my daughter. I haven't seen her in twenty years. She was your age when she left, I never heard from her again. She's got her own life and doesn't need me anymore. Are you riding all the way to Canada on bicycle? Maybe later. First, I have something important to do. You're wrong, you know you have more use for it than I do. Esmeralda, What do I want this box for? Eruptions from the Popocatepetl volcano throughout the night have covered Mexico City in a dense layer of ashes. It looks pretty. Almost like snow. You've seen snow, haven't you Mom? I bet it looks just like that. Lina! Esme! Ines? Ines, it's your father. Please, don't hang up. Even if we never speak again. I needed to see you. I have a son. A son? Yes. How old is this son of yours? Five. It happened while you were in Tijuana for the border exhibit. And you've kept this from me for five fucking years? I only found out a year ago. I had no idea. She showed up suddenly and threw this at me. I couldn't. I just... I just did nothing. I didn't tell you. We haven't told him... Now he's very sick. And I feel completely useless. And this secret... I couldn't touch you, Ellie. Every time I reached for you, I felt my world come crashing down. I had to tell you, Ellie. You son of a bitch. Your son better not like cats. - Should I cut it all off? - Yeah! - All of it? - Yeah! How do I look? You look pretty. Do you like it? There's the princess, the warrior is next to her. I don't see anything. Look closely Nana. They're right there. Yes, there they are. They're dressed in white. He's wearing a cape over his shoulders, and the princess is covered in a blanket to keep warm. The blanket turns pink at sunset and the sun makes it shimmer
