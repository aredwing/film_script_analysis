Story by Liu Heng Starring: Gong Li, Li Baotian, Li Wei Directors: Zhang Yimou, Yang Fengliang. The Yang Family's Dye Mill Uncle! You took long enough! There were bandits... How come they didn't kill you? How much money is there? Count it yourself. Hey, boy! Tianqing, you're back! Don't bother to come back tomorrow. With only that boy for help, I turned down many orders. The horse looks much thinner. Go, now. We start work early in the morning. What took you so long? I was doing all your work. I did my best, but those bandits... Look at my hands... They're as black as coal. For all that work your uncle paid me only two dollars. The miser! Your uncle bought himself another wife. Did you see her? I just saw the wedding decorations. Her name is Ju Dou. A good-looker...and expensive. Your uncle is cheap. Did you know he tortured your first two aunts to death? They didn't give him any children. It served him right. Listen how your new aunt... screams at night. I'll kill you! Let me rest a while. Let you rest? You'll never make an heir for the Yang family! You're not good for nothing! Go, call your aunt. Aunt... My uncle wants you to come downstairs. You realize what time it is, dear lady? You're very late. I didn't buy a freeloader! Hey...Master Yang! Master Yang! Master Liu wants these in a hurry. He wants two in bright red, and... ...five in golden yellow. Sure. 26 pounds, 7 ounces. Master Yang... ...with so much work... ...why not hire someone? That would add to my expenses. Tianqing is enough. Tianqing is in his forties. He ought to get married. That would be one more mouth to feed. It might help you. We'll wait and see. She wouldn't cost much. Tianqing is almost like a son. A son? Bullshit! He doesn't have my blood. That orphan wouldn't have survived if I hadn't adopted him... ...after his parents died. My son wouldn't be as dumb as he is. Careful, huh! If you ruin that, you'd better watch out! Tianqing... Don't waste any pigment while you measure it. I bought you, now obey me. When I buy an animal, I treat it as I wish. And you're no better than an animal. You love that, eh? Obey me. Give me a son, and I'll be your slave. Otherwise, watch out! Tianqing! What are you doing? Hurry up! I'm coming. It's already very late. I'm coming! Hurry! All you're learned is how to be lazy. You could at least answer. These are delicate dye jobs. Ask for higher prices. Learn how to bargain. Don't sell at a loss. Choose inexpensive inns. Don't spend more than you earn. I'll go to the stable. Jinshan, you bought lanterns? Go, make children... It brings good luck. You've come back? Aunt... what happened to your face? I was careless and fell down. Your uncle is killing the pig. It's an offering for the Moon Festival. Aunt... You've hurt your arm? Yes, when I fell down. I'm so clumsy. Let's go home. You're so skinny. Tonight we'll eat pork. Listen to the pig screaming for its life! Are you satisfied? I can't stand it any more! Who's there? Who? It's me. It's you, Tianqing? Yes. Did you feed the horse? Yes. Is my aunt sick? It's nothing. It's a little indigestion... something she ate. Is it serious? I'll go get Li, the healer. It's not necessary. She's already feeling better. I'll go to bed. What was that noise? It scared me. It was too dark. Who knows? Aunt... What's wrong? Tianqing, I want to tell you... Your uncle will kill me sooner or later. I can't go on. Let him kill me. Don't stop him. I don't want to live any more. He does have a bad temper. He's not human. He's not a man. Tianqing, I'll tell you the truth. The old man's sick. He can't do it! All he does is torture me. I really can't go on. I can't take it any more. Did you feed him during the trip? Three times a day, and once at night. He may have colic. Zhang wants his light blue... ...and Tsui wants his pink. Here's the cloth. Don't waste any fuel. I know. Go back. Rest easy, Tianqing. His horse is sick. That old jerk won't be back tonight. Aunt... Wake me up tomorrow. I'll start working early. I sleep like a log. Really? Since when? He's not here. What are you afraid of? You're really a log! Tianqing... are you afraid? Me? Afraid? Then why did you latch your door? You're a grown man... Am I a wolf? You think I'll eat you? My uncle... He can go to hell! If someone comes by... That didn't stop you from looking through the hole... Why didn't you plug it up? Tianqing... ...I've kept my body for you. My prescription worked well. She's pregnant. Really? Is it a boy or a girl? With some luck, a boy. Ancestors... ...grant me a son! Let the Yang family line continue forever, Ancestors. I'll be forever grateful to you. I'll shower you with gifts if it's a boy. Ju Dou. Tianqing! Are you pregnant? Yes. And that old bastard thinks it's his. Tianqing, I counted the days: the child is yours. Ju Dou... Eat well, sleep well, and make us a fat boy! I'll leave now. The old man mustn't see me. Jinshan! Jinshan!! It's a really fat baby with a watering spout between his legs. Ju Dou really did well for you. My son! For his generation... ...there are very few good first names left. Just make one up. Idiot! The ancestors knew best. You can outwit them! He is the only Yang heir. One bad first name could mean the end... ...of the family line. Yang Tianbai... Yang Tianqing... Qing and Bai! That means purity! Those are the two best names beginning with Tian. Nice toy. Soon Tianbai will play with it. Hang the cloths quietly. Your aunt and Tianbai are asleep. You're all mine! I thought I was dying and I'd never see you again. Be quiet... be quiet! Doesn't he look like you? Like me? Look at him. He's your son. My breasts are swollen. Too much milk? Yes. You're getting silly. You want some? Does it hurt? Suck it. Now, go. The old man might come back... No, he won't come back now. Aren't you afraid he'll kill you with an axe? It's hard to say who will kill whom. You talk big behind his back, you big devil! One day he'll find out the truth. It won't be easy to kill us all. Uncle! Uncle!... Uncle! What happened to you? Uncle! Uncle! He is paralyzed. He's not going to die. But he can no longer function... ...from the waist down. Slut! I'll kill you, bitch! Filthy beast! You still want to hurt me? What's inside your pants? Nothing but shit! What's done is done. I want you to know... You can do nothing about it. God gave me Tianqing. Now, listen! Tianqing is Tianbai's father. It serves you right! Tianqing, why doesn't Tianbai ever laugh? Don't worry, he'll soon laugh. "Hear the bell, ding dong." "Here we are..." "...at Village Wang." "So many dogs..." "...here they come." "They attack us but we can't run!" "We can't run, so we go home." "Play the horn just for fun." Kill him! Kill that old bastard! What are you waiting for? Kill him! You touch my son again and see what happens! Ju Dou, sleep with our son without worry. If you want to die, say so. I'll help you. You wanted to burn up my family? You old bastard! You won't succeed. It isn't that easy! We'll keep you alive a long time. Keep on breathing, you devil! Tianqing and I will take good care of you... ...so you can watch us as we live happily. You understand? Where are you going? It's a beautiful day. Jinshan... ...you're so lucky. Tianqing takes care of you like a son would. Ancestors... ...look... ...open your eyes wide... Look at those two filthy beasts! Oh, my poor ancestors! I'm worried. Tianqing is big, but he still doesn't talk. Is he mute? That's nonsense. He's slow to talk, but he'll talk sooner or later. Tianbai! Tianbai, call me daddy. If he does, would you dare reply? Anyway, he is your son. We'll tell him when he's older. Let's go. Wait, Tianbai is here. It's been a long time... I'd like to.. What are you afraid of? He's our son. Let's go! Tianqing, my period is late. If I'm pregnant, it would be a big problem. Tianbai! Daddy! Daddy!! You can say, "Daddy"? Who's your daddy? Daddy!... Daddy! Daddy!... Daddy! Tianbai!... My son! Of course, I'm your father! My son! I'm your father! I'm your father! Tianbai! Call me! Louder. Daddy! Again! Tianbai, that's your Mama. Mama... That's your brother. Brother... And I'm your father. Daddy... My son, you're a good boy. Remember to call us that way. Don't take it so hard. He's too young to understand. When he's older we'll tell him everything. I don't know why my period was so late... I was scared. We'll have to do something. Take this. Apply it beforehand. You'll be safe. Does it work? The old nun said it'll work after I use it 10 times. Ju Dou! Wash yourself. It's time to extend good wishes. Today Tianbai is three years old. I wish him great happiness. I only have one thing to say: Live a long life... ...and continue the Yang family line. Let's have a toast! Jinshan... ...has a good son. Tianqing has a good brother. Good luck! Let's drink a toast! It's Tianqing's turn to extend his wishes to Tianbai. Aunt, pour your nephew a drink! Your aunt's wine is good! Drink up, Tianqing! Offer some wishes to your brother. Tianbai... ...my... ...my good brother... Tianqing is drunk! Tianqing would like a son of his own. Be patient... your uncle will spend some money... ...and buy you an even prettier wife. Would you like that? It's chili powder! Use vinegar. Vinegar? Does that work? Yes, it works. Old people use vinegar as a cure. I can't take any more! I really can't take any more. Let's find a way. Let's take Tianbai and leave. Or let's live together and never mind what people might say. What they'd say doesn't worry me. If they knew, they'd kill us! You worry and worry... Just find us a solution! What's that? Arsenic. From where? What for? Stop and think, will you? I have! Give it to me. Listen to me: It's either him or me! Him? Who? Don't you know? How dare you? After all, he is my uncle. He's your uncle... And I, what am I? What am I to you? Answer me, go on, say it! "Hear the bell, ding, dong!" "Here we are at Village Wang!" "So many dogs... here they come!" "They bite us all... but we can't run!" "We can't run so we go home!" "Play the horn just for fun!" What's wrong? Your aunt's lower parts are in bad shape. Is your paralyzed uncle strong enough to have done that? Give her this medicine. But, frankly speaking... ...she can never... ...become pregnant again. At least it's one less thing to worry about. You go first. I'll come home after dark. Ju Dou, don't do anything silly. Tianbai, my son... ...do you want to dye the straw? I'll help you. We'll dye it bright red. You did it? Did what? You know very well! Stop talking nonsense! When I came home, he was already floating. Don't lie to me! You should have let me do it. Killing one's husband cries out for punishment. You're accusing me wrongly! I'm lost in any case. Where is the little bottle? You threw it out? Where? Where?? Here. You still have it? Keep it. I'm involved, too. What are you trying to prove? Look at yourself! Is that a son's loyalty? Didn't he deserve to die? Are you sorry he's dead? You'd rather keep on being Tianbai's brother! What a good, respectful nephew! Tianqing! You, too, are beating me? Sure, continue doing it! Revive the old man, and you can both beat me! I don't want to live any more. According to tradition... ...Tianbai is the only Yang heir in the Tian generation. Tianqing isn't really part of the family. According to ancient custom... ...the funeral will take place tomorrow. Out of loyalty, Ju Dou and Tianqing will block the coffin's path. There is gossip about them in the village. Tomorrow the entire Yang family will see with its own eyes... ...whether they are truly loyal. According to ancestral tradition... ...Ju Dou will not remarry. The widow will remain faithful. After the ceremony... ...Tianqing will move out of the dye mill. He will sleep at Wang's house. A man living in a house with a widow, even though she's his aunt... ...would cause gossip about the Yang family... ...whose reputation is unblemished. Are they blocking the path? They're waiting up ahead. According to custom, they must block the path 49 times. There must be no mistake. Block the path! Uncle, don't leave! Don't leave! That's once! That's twice! Tianbai! Aunt! What is it? I bought this at the market a few days ago. That's for Tianbai. Give it to him. No, you do it. He won't talk to me. Look. Isn't it too bright? No. You're still very beautiful. Your brother bought this for you. Aunt... ...I'm leaving now. Lock the door. Tianbai, I'm going to Shi village. Your sixth uncle asked for me. Let's stop coming here. Someone might see us. It will be getting cold. Where could we go? You should get home. People gossip about widows. Since the old man's death, we live in fear of gossip. You moved away seven or eight years ago. We're always hiding. Let's take Tianbai and leave this place. Don't say that. The worst part is behind us. Later on Tianbai will take over the dye mill. Then I'll tell him the whole truth. You're crazy! You'll tell him?! Do you want to lose him? If we don't tell him he'll keep on hating us... ...and acting as if he wanted us dead. It looked like two deer or two foxes. Then I saw it was two people. I couldn't see who was underneath... ...but on top was... Who? Tianbai's mother. She was on top? She was moving like when they scrub laundry. Where was that? It was... Murderer!... Murderer! What's wrong? Let's see your hand. You're bleeding! Let me suck out the wound. Let me... You evil brat! Tianbai, now listen carefully! You have hit your father! I'm telling you this today: You are the son of Yang Tianqing. He is your father! Aunt! Here's your lunch. Go on, eat. Where's Tianbai? He went out. Life will be even harder for us. I'm getting older... but... ...I'd like to sleep with you. If you wish... let's find a place. It's stifling, isn't it? I'm out of breath. There's not much air in this cave. There's no air at all. If we stay here, we'll suffocate. Should we leave? Let's stay this way. Let's keep lying here... ...for the rest of our lives. We're old. Do you remember how it all began for us? Yes. Tell me, go on. Tell me. No, you tell me. It makes me blush. Remember, I watched you through a hole in the wall. Yes. I remember. And now we've gone into this large hole.
