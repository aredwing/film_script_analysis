 

                        'I know this land. 'It's rich land. 'Plenty of good water and fields knee-deep in grass. 'A place where a steer can get its belly full 'and a man doesn't have to worry about tomorrow. 'I'm coming home. 'Another 35 miles, 40 maybe, 'I'll see the town of Shelby, blistering out there in the hot sun. 'Just the way it was when I had to leave it two years ago. 'Just two years. 'It feels like 20. 'I remember what I had to leave behind 'and sometimes it feels like 100 'and I remember the men I've had to kill.' Hold it, bud. You know there ain't nothing better than a dead gunslinger. - Cagle? You hear that, Donovan? Clint knows who it is without even looking. You come and stand guard this way, old Spangler must be somewhere around. Big as life. What's he doing in Montana? Now, it could be he'd like to ask you that question. Hey! Hey, Spang. Well, by gravy, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. If it ain't the devil himself. Clint Cooper. Ha-ha-ha. Hiya, Clint boy. Good to see you, Spang. I caught him coming up on the high trail, so I thought I'd better bring him in. You thought right, Cagle. You wouldn't want an old friend to go riding by without giving him an invite, would you? Come on, boy. Yes, say talk of the devil. I was saying to the boys just yesterday, I bet you my old friend Clint Cooper would give plenty to be with us right now. Coffee, boy. You're a long way from Missouri, aren't you? Longer than a horse's tail, that's for sure. Here, have some meat. No, thanks. You still wearing them tied down. Sit. They make me a living. A living? Oh, boy, don't you never learn? I'm alive, I eat. One of these days, that gun of yours will be so fast that you'll lose your appetite real sudden. We used to be a good team, Spang. Yeah, best hired guns in the business. Ha-ha. Ah, but a fella's got to look to the future. Now you take me, I've got 15 men working for me. Any time we need money, vittles, liquor, women, we just go get them. And a there ain't a sheriff west of Mississippi can stop us. Ha-ha-ha. How about it, boy? You want to join up with your old friend? Something important get you to Montana? Maybe something important brought us both to Montana. My reason's personal. Dang, if you ain't the closest mouth I ever chinned with. Just how personal do you think a bank full of gold and greenbacks is? It must be busting at the seams to bring you all this way. Juicy as a fat cat. Them cattle bars come in and just loaded her with cash from buying herds after the cattle drive. Ha. And if you hadn't heard that money was here ready to be took, you wouldn't be here, would you, Clint? I told you, I have other reasons. Sure, you told me, boy. Only I wouldn't want the two of us trying for that same bank. You could guarantee it by riding with me. What I have to do, I can't use any help. Even if the money's in Shelby? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. And it ain't only the money, we're taking the whole town, all of it. There ain't enough men in Shelby to stop us. Just think of it, boy, we could burn that place to the ground if we wanted to. You'd ought to like that, considering how you and that town feel about each other. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Make 'em sorry they ever heard of Clint Cooper, eh, boy? When I go to Shelby, I'm going alone. You think you're going to get that money without me, well, you're wrong, boy. I don't like to kill friends, Clint, but... Makes us even, Spang. I'm kind of against dying. No, that's much more reasonable. Never heard a man not to change his mind. Nope. Never. Ah! SPANGLER SPLUTTERS I'll catch up with you, boy. You'll have to stay alive to do it, so tell 'em that. Let him get to his horse, boys. SPANGLER COUGHS Hey. HE SPLUTTERS Grab hold of this rope, Spang. Now walk me to the door. Thanks, Spang. Get that double-crossing gunner. Get him before he gets to Shelby. Ya! Ya! GUNSHO GUNSHO 'There it is, the town I was born in. 'And I'm going to find out if it still wishes I'd never been born.' See you on Sunday, Mrs McCredie. Rick, what's that murderer doing back here? He won't be here long. Scotty. You'd better get out there. Clint Cooper's back. And Rick Morrison saw him. Scotty. Clint. Let's have it. Can't argue with the law. GENERAL CHATTER Inside. If you wanted to commit suicide, you could've found a lot easier way. You're one of the few people around who ever cared whether I did or not. Clint, there hasn't been a shooting in Shelby since you left. Who gets the medal? You or the town? All right, I know how you feel. But when you rode out of here two years ago, they thought your guns were gone for good. When I rode back here today, I could've used that on Rick Morrison, but I didn't. Now that should tell you where I stand. I'm not the one you have to convince. Do you think for one minute that Tom Morrison's forgotten that you killed his two sons? It was them or me, you know it and this town knows it. And they know this. Your guns got too fast and too sudden. And from what I hear about your reputation, they've got a lot faster and a lot suddener in the last two years. Scotty, sounds to me like you're letting some of this town's hate rub off on you. I've got a job to do. Friendship or not, I can't let a gunslinger stay here. You might just have to put up with it. My father's dead now, Scotty. I aim to claim the ranch. And start another battle with the Morrisons? No deal, Clint. Now water your horse and get out. I don't want any trouble here. You're going to get it, whether you want it or not. Jud Spangler will be raiding Shelby before the day's over. Spangler? He knows most of the men are away on a cattle drive and the bank's full of cattle buying money. You seem to have an awful lot of information. He wanted me with him. Soon as he finds the two dead men I left at Big Rock Canyon, he'll be coming. Big Rock. If they ride their horses into the ground, they could be here by sundown. Most likely night, depends on how long it takes them to find the two deadmans. There's something I don't understand. Knowing how you feel about this town, you still came here to warn us. Finding out how the town still feels about me, I should've saved myself the ride. BELL RINGS School's letting out. I have those kids to worry about. I could use every gun hand I could get. You asking me to stay, now, Scotty? I didn't hear you making any offer. That's right, I didn't. If I do say, it'll be for my own reasons. You mean Helen? She's over at the schoolhouse. Thanks. Clint, don't mention Spangler. I, er, I don't want a panic in this town. EXCITED CHATTER CHATTER STOPS You took a long time, Sheriff. When are you getting Cooper out of here? When I have to answer to you, I'll turn in my badge. Sheriff, we'd like to know. You'll know when I'm ready, this doesn't concern any of you. Now go on about your business. Keely. As soon as I get the other council men, we're going to have a meeting. About what? Be here. You've been a very naughty girl. I'm sorry. Nonetheless, I'm going to have to punish you. I want you to take this home and write it 50 times. 50 times! 50 times. And bring it back to me in the morning. Yes, Miss Reed. Very well. Clint! You look fine, Helen. Nobody ever thought we'd ever see you again. L- l-It's like seeing a ghost. Came close to being one several times. Come on, don't you want to be the first one to say you're glad I'm back? I AM glad, Clint. It makes it worth some of the thinking I've been doing about you, the past two years. Yeah. What did you think, Clint? That I might change my mind about us? Kind of a hope I had with me. What kind of a hope could I have? You're still wearing that gun, you haven't stopped killing. I've had time to think about that, too. I think I could leave the law in Scotty's hands now. Helen, the past can be forgotten. There's still a lot of future for us, if we want it. You have no right to expect anything of me, Clint. What did you think? That this schoolhouse could be my whole life? When you left, you left me nothing to love. I needed something. Now it's too late. No, it isn't too late. Now, you listen to me. My father's ranch sits on good land, we can turn that into one of the best cow outfits in this country. Something we'd be proud of, something we'd be proud to hand on to our children. Why didn't you think of that two years ago? Now, listen to me and let this end it. One week from Sunday, Scotty and I are being married. It's kind of funny. I always kind of thought the difference between Scotty's job and mine was a badge. I guess I was wrong. If it had to happen... ...I'm glad it's Scotty. He deserves someone like you. Bang, bang, bang, bang. BOYS LAUGH Are you trying to ride the flesh off that horse, or did you forget he belongs to me? If I ever forgot, you'd remind me. That's right. I'll also remind you that you're only living by the grace of God and Tom Morrison. Anything to say to that? Yes, I'm glad I'm only your nephew, and not one of your sons. You talk about my boys like that again and I'll run you right off this ranch. You'll get nothing from me, do you hear? Nothing. You've been taking out on me since Clint Cooper left. You can stop now he's back. Where? In town, just rode in. Get our guns. You going for him now, in broad daylight? Two years I've waited, two years. Get our guns. I promise you, there will be a grave for Clint Cooper, too. There's two of us. You make him draw first, do you understand that? I want him dead, legal. Like an execution. Mrs Swanson. Been a long time, Mike. Clint, please, I got to ask you to leave. It wouldn't be good business for me. Whisky. Leave it. Welcome back, Cooper. Mr Morrison, please. You think your gun's fast enough for the two of us? I have had to answer that question many times. This will be the last time. Is that what you thought when you sent your sons gunning for me? You stood in my way. You tried to steal our land, Morrison. Why are we talking so much? You gonna draw, Cooper? Awfully anxious to have me draw first. That's so Mike can tell the sheriff we killed you legal. Are you ready to take your chances? I didn't come looking for you. Now leave me alone. Cooper, you're yellow. Now draw. Sorry. Can't oblige you. Not today, anyway. Are you weaselling out of it, Cooper? That's the only kind of trouble I can afford, Morrison. That's enough! If you started this... No, no, Scotty, I've got to be honest. The kid was just having a peaceful drink when they started all this. And I'm not finished. Damn fool. We got other trouble. That's your trouble. Cooper's mine. Keely and Mitch are over at my office right now for a meeting I called. Are you going to be there or not? I'm going to that meeting right now, Am I gonna tell that council you're staying on and helping us, or not? You think of any reason why I should? No, I can't. Then that's what you tell them. All right, good luck. Get started without me. You're a mess, Clint. I got to admit the Morrisons didn't look much better. I was going to drop by to see you, Dan, but... ...I guess I just needed a drink first. I know, Clint. Scotty told me that you saw Helen. I got some cold water and liniment at the hotel, or don't you even want to stay long enough to make repairs? Take a look. He's dead. Rock-headed idiot got himself killed. That looks like Dex. Well? It looks like they both was in no condition to come back and warn us. That gun-slinging snake. Spang, he's got a big headstart on that money. That he has. That he has. Now, in that case, we're just going to have to figure if the law don't catch him, we will. Come on around here. I reckon this liniment won't do much good for the kind of hurt you think you have. There's nothing holding me here. When you left Shelby, you spit on the town. All of us didn't spit back. In my business you can't have any friends, I found that out today. So you'd rather just ride out of here and keep on using those guns for something that can't ever matter? I didn't want it that way, Dan. See you. Clint. Is that what you'll be saying tomorrow when you're wondering what Spangler did to this town? Spangler will want more than money, I can tell you that. I'm sure you all remember what he did to Big Ben, Iron Bill and Frank. When he wanted women, he took them. After his men got liquored up they burned the towns to the ground. And that is what he has in mind for Shelby. What can we do? We'll never be able to get our ranch hands back from the drive. They're too far away. Why are we taking Cooper's word for it? He and Spangler rode together, this could be a trick. Are you out of your head? Am I? You got some kind of guarantee Cooper won't be a paid killer behind our backs, while Spangler hits us from the front? I said I'd stay here and help fight Spangler. If I wanted to kill you, Morrison, you'd be dead already. Back off, Morrison. We're wasting a lot of time we haven't got. Spangler might be 20 miles from this town right now. How do we vote? Mitchell? Well, Scotty, you're the law. If you think we should stay, it's your decision. We need help, that's all I know. You know how I vote. There's four against you, Morrison. You know Spangler best, you got any ideas? The town is fairly well protected from both sides by the hills. Why don't we build a barricade on each end of the street. Keely, you spread the word without getting the women hysterical. Mitchell, tell the Reverend to put the women and children up in the church. Make sure there's water, food and plenty of blankets. Morrison, you got extra guns at your place, bring them in. All right, Sheriff, it's your party. But I'm going to tell you something. I'll remember not to turn my back on Cooper. What do I do? Get all the extra men and drag out everything you can use for the barricades. Scotty, what about the money? Are you going to leave it in the bank? Why? Seems to me that would be the first place Spangler would look. You are right, I'll see that it is moved. Good, if he breaks through, it might give us the extra time we need. 'The town knows what it has to face now. 'And it's doing its job. 'The men are tensing up. 'I can see how scared the women are. 'I wish I could tell them we're a lot smarter than Spangler, but I can't. 'In the end, that's going to make the big difference.' Get those bales off that wagon. Food and water's in the church, Helen's getting the blankets now. May as well will bring out that kerosene. Setting fire to a barricade like that is liable to blow up the whole town. If we don't, Spangler will. Go inside and take a seat. Everybody stay calm. Reverend, how come we're having church on a Thursday? If it was up to me, young fellow, we'd have it every day. Reverend, if my husband and the other men knew what was happening here, I'm sure they could get back in time. The sheriff is the best judge of how much time we have. I bet there is going to be a lot of shooting around here, huh, Reverend? Get moving, the Reverend is busy. There's more blankets if you need them. May as well go ahead and douse it. Clint, I don't know who else has thanked you for helping, but I'd like to. As long as I was coming back anyway... Sorry I couldn't have brought better news. Right there. There you are, Helen. Are we going to sleep on those? I don't see why not. During the Sunday sermons, Pa sleeps without a bed. You go back and stay with your mother. Where can I set all this up? Well, let's see. I guess maybe this would be the safest place. Mitchell? Yes, Scotty. Help me put this table up here, will you? Some other things I want to bring in. Is everything getting organised? Best we can. Helen, there's something I think you ought to know. This note was left on my desk. Clint left it there. Clint? It says that if we get out of this mess, that he wants us to take his ranch as a wedding present. Oh, Scotty, no. How do you refuse a fellow that gives you the only thing he owns? Then he's planning to leave Shelby? You don't want him to, do you? Do you? Scotty, I said I would marry you. That hasn't changed. Hasn't it? Sooner or later, I guess we had to find out. You loved him before, you still love him. Nobody's to blame for that. This stuff go to the sheriff's office? Yeah, guns for a bunch of old men - farmers, storekeepers - and they won't even know what to do with them. You think we haven't got a chance against Spangler? It'd be a miracle. Cooper's guns could make a difference. And if that happens, the town will change its thinking about Cooper. He'll get to be a big man. If you'd been smart enough to make him draw in the first place, everything would be settled by now. He won't be so big, he'll be cut down to size before this night's over. Load up. How is it going? I got the women and children in the church. I found that note you left. Why didn't you tell me about you and Helen before I went to see her? You know how many times I asked her before she agreed to marry me? She was always hoping you'd come back. You've been drinking. She wants no part of me. I just left her. Helen and I won't be getting married. Does that answer your question? Did you get that money moved out of the bank? There's a trapdoor in the jail. That ought to keep Spangler guessing for a little while. Diego, since you and Donovan are the only two around with honest faces... seems like you should be the ones to ride into Shelby and find out if the law's caught up with our old friend Clint Cooper. And what if we find Clint just kind of hanging around on a tree? HE LAUGHS Well, now, that would be a good way of knowing for sure he ain't got to the bank ahead of us. The main thing for you to find out - is the money still there? We'll be over in them rocks until you get back. Been a long week. Seems to me he should have been here by now. Can't depend on Spangler doing what you expect him to. I'll go down and see how Dan's making out. Make sure there's enough kerosene on that barricade. Keep walking, Cooper. No noise. You picked a hell of a time to start something, Morrison. I waited too long to let Spangler have the pleasure of killing you. One shot would bring everybody running. You ain't worth going to jail for, Cooper. Besides, a gun makes it too fast. Get the rope. You really work hard at hating, don't you, Morrison? Did you ever see a man dancing at the end of a rope with his feet just barely off the ground? He dies slow, Cooper... so slow. It would make my waiting worth these last two years. You take away a man's sons, you take away everything he's got to live for. Too bad your father can't be here to see his son die! GRUNTING Wait! No guns. He wants it that way, let him have it that way. Circle him, I'll get him from this side. All right, Cooper, you want to hate me for killing you? That's the way it's gonna be. Get those women back in the church! Get back to your posts! What the hell...? I didn't get any choice, Scotty. Tom's dead. What are you men doing here? Are you trying to make it easy for Spangler? Get back to your posts. Reverend, you get back to the church. Cooper's going to hang for this. He's a killer, just like we all said. I never thought Cooper would gun 'em down at a time like this. I told you, get back to your posts. I mean it! You can't believe I went gunning for the Morrisons! They wanted to string me up! Well, I don't believe it, Clint. Helen, you stay out of this. Give me the gun, Clint. You're not going to arrest him? What do you want me to do? I don't make the laws. The man has to stand trial whether I want him to not. Let's go. Dan, you've got no business here. I had to see if you'd really do it, you're locking Clint up? You think I've got a choice? Don't you think I want him out there on the barricade with us? His gun gave us a chance. And you're letting a lot of backbiting idiots talk you out of it. Sheriff... something... something up the road! Scotty... ...good luck. Thanks. I'll need it. I'll see you later, boy. The Lord willing. There's only two of them. Hold it right there. Howdy, Sheriff. Looks like you fellas are getting ready for some kind of a turkey shoot. You might even say that a turkey wouldn't be safe here tonight. You folks expecting some kind of trouble? Nothing we can't handle. Where you boys from? Mountain country. Up around Butte. We holed up last night at Goose Egg. Joe Wylie's trading post? That's right. We figured we'd head out to the summer grass country. Better you keep heading. We were figuring on leaving some of our money over to the saloon. There's a creek back about five miles. Best you stick to water. Well, that's mighty inhospitable, Sheriff. We just don't want any strangers staying in our town and getting shot at by Spangler and his mob. Spangler? Name's enough to give you the creeps. With that critter coming, I should think you'd want us to stay around and give you some help. You just move back there slow and easy back down the road. I wouldn't want any of my men to mistake you for a turkey. Now, now, Sheriff, we ain't ready to be stuck yet, so thank you very much for the warning. We could have used them. Why did you say we had plenty of men? Think we should have told Spangler we don't? Spangler? They just came in to look the situation over, tell Spangler which way to move. You're just guessing. They were two more guns we could've used. They didn't come from Goose Egg. Joe Wylie hasn't had that trading post for six months. Then why didn't you jail them? I thought they might serve us better if they went back and told Spangler we were ready for them. You think that'll stop him from coming? With those two showing up, the gang must be close by. We'll take them on, get back to Spangler and give him the news. But that's all the time we've got to find out whether he's coming or not. You'd better get back to the other barricade. That sheriff was bluffing. They give you a big song and dance about having a lot of men. I guess your faces ain't as honest as I thought they was. They had you figured. He sure wasn't bluffing about them barricades. But them gun hands he's got behind him... Gun hands? There ain't ten men and the whole town know which end of the gun they shooting. Yeah? Well, I sure ain't finding out by having them practising on me. Listen to me! I'll tell you just when you get shot and when not, do you understand that? Don't forget it. He's been around too long. Now he's figuring he'll die of old age! So... you don't like them barricades? They've got to be took, Spang, and it ain't going to be easy. You think my brains are drying up or something? See anything of Clint Cooper? No, not a sign. Dirty yellow-livered rat! Give him a warning. All right... Mount up, we're moving in! 'All my life, I've had to fight for something or against it. 'Now, I can't do either. All I can do is wait. 'Wait and try not to think about what Spangler's going to do to this town.' We didn't bluff him. God have mercy on us. All right, boys, this is where we split up. Lacey, you take your men and circle the town. You know when to come in on the other side. Just keep them pinned down at that barricade. Remember, we'll take care of the rest. OK, let's go! He'll be here any minute now. Reverend, I'm relying on you to keep things as calm as possible here. All this killing... Men with families. Peace... The word of God... How does a man bring them to this country? You brought them, Reverend. I can't tell you why there are men like Spangler. Scotty, is it so impossible to reason with Spangler? Reason? Anything is worth trying. If it would save one life here... Do you really believe that I can get Spangler to understand that? I don't know, Scotty. Sometimes, even an animal can be made to understand. All right, Reverend. Take care of things here. Helen... you help him. I'm going out to have a look around. Out there? You men hold your positions. Don't fire unless you have to. I won't have to tell you when. Scotty! Scotty, come back! Scotty! Oh, Scotty, come back! Oh, Scotty, come back! Oh, he's going out there alone. Cos he thinks he must. Perhaps he saw me lose faith with my job. He's keeping faith with his. Spangler. I'm Sheriff Wade. Sheriff! Well, by gravy, if this ain't the night of nights. The sheriff himself coming out all alone to extend the hand of welcome. You might say that. Only I don't think it's the kind of welcome you'll want. And you didn't want to see old Spang get plugged, so you come all the way out here to warn him, huh? Something like that. I don't want to see you get shot and I don't want to see my town get shot up. Well now, that's mighty good arguing. Exceptin', I ain't got nothing you want. You've got something I want. Tell you what, Sheriff, make a deal with you. You let us get that money peaceable-like, and you can guarantee your ladies that we will spend it all on them! LAUGHING That's what I came here to tell you. We knew you were coming, so we had plenty of time to get the money out of town. I know how much time you had, it weren't enough. I'm telling you it isn't here. And you don't have enough men to find out whether it is or not. Sheriff, you're either the biggest liar I've ever seen or the bravest man. If you think I'm lying, why don't you try and take that barricade? That was just what I was fixing to do. Only... you're standing in the way. The hour's great trial is upon us. Let us pray. Father in heaven, spare us from these men of great evil, who live by terror and bloodshed, and whose only law is the law of the gun. All right, get them out. Rest of you men, get back there, cover us. They're charging, they're charging! Keep firing! All right, let's go. Hah! Now! Dynamite! EXPLOSION HE SHOUTS THEY WHOOP What happened, Dan? Spangler's got the town. From what I can tell, we're the only two men left. WOMAN SCREAMS Spangler's gunning for you. The money's gone. That fool sheriff weren't lying. I'll be hog-tied, this is the first time I ever killed a man who told the truth. That money's got to be someplace. It's gotta be here in town. We're going to find out where. You four men keep your eyes open, Cagle and Donovan, come with me. They're heading for the church. WOMEN SCREAM My church is always open, you didn't have to do that. Well now, Reverend, old Spang is too ornery for converting, and too suspicious to just walk in with his hat in his hand. Then what do you want? Well now, I wouldn't mind to get an invite to your church social here. But, like I always say, business before pleasure. The sheriff kept telling me that the money weren't in the bank. Right up to the time we killed him. You filthy murderer! Get out! Isn't it enough that you killed a lot of innocent men here today? What do you want now, the blood of women and children?! I don't like no babbling women! I never seen a woman yet that wouldn't run off at the mouth. You know all I have to do is have to squeeze a little, I could mess up that pretty face of yours. In heaven's name, let her be! All right, Reverend, since you're so polite. Now maybe you'll be polite enough to tell me where the money is. We don't know anything about the money. Is that so? Well... Then maybe we'll just take this little lady as a hostage till somebody around here remembers. She doesn't know, none of us do. You've got 15 minutes to remember. And this lady'll entertain us until you do. So the longer it takes you to remember, the longer she'll entertain us. Oh, no! Oh! We'll be in the saloon. Ladies. Jake, get them horses in the church. HORSES' GALLOPING HOOVES How do we do it, Clint? There are six of them and only two of us. Wait a minute. You'll know what's happening. Reverend, what about Helen? I'm glad you let Clint out, Ben. It's what I came over to do. I don't believe what happened with the Morrisons tonight was your fault. Thank you, Reverend, but what about Helen? Spangler made it more than clear what will happen to her unless we told him where the money is. He gave us 15 minutes. Clint, there's no law in this town now. If you'd consent to wearing this deputy's badge. You can't take Spangler alone. Clint, it doesn't make sense! I need some help, Dan. You don't need much help being a fool. Maybe I'm a bigger one. What do you want me to do? I want you to open up your hotel. I'm going to bring you some guests so get ready. Go out the back way, don't let them see you. BOTTLE SMASHES Come on, princess, take a swig. Nothing like it to make a lady forget she's a lady. What do you want me to do, drink to the men you killed here? Ahhh... That's a good idea. Hey, Cagle, you expect the princess to drink out of a bottle? Bring her a glass. HE CHUCKLES SPANGLER LAUGHS NASTILY Come on, princess, drink up. Enough of this stuff and you and me can get real friendly in 15 minutes. You pig! You dirty rotten pig! GANG LAUGH SPANGLERJOINS IN THE LAUGHTER How do you like that, boys? The only one in the whole town that ain't afraid of old Spang and it turns out to be a woman! Oh, a real fighting woman! Aargh! Ow! Take that! Ha-ha-ha! Yes, give me one like that every time! Full of gumption. BOTTLE SMASHES Hey, Spang... We got company. The Reverend? Coming to tell us about the money? An old friend of yours. Clint Cooper. Clint coming here alone to get hisself killed? Well now, boys, you just get ready to accommodate him. Donovan, Cagle. Jake. Well, Spang, never thought I'd see you twice in the same day. I don't figure it'll ever happen again, seeing as you ain't got long to live. If you want to kill me you have to take the leavings. If the town gets through hanging me. I figured they'd at least elect you mayor since you were the one that warned them I was coming. Heh. They been over to help fight you. They threw me in jail. Sit down. Have a drink. On the house. Jail, huh? How come you could get loose? A good friend of mine let me out. Figured you'd be gunning for me. He wasn't far wrong, you cost me a lot of men. You can always get men but you can't always get $100, 000. 100, 000? You know something I don't? It could be. Like where that money's hid? Come on, boy, don't keep old Spang hung up by his hair, where's she at? I could lead you to it. Hear that, boys?! Old Clint's gonna save us a mess of looking. Now if that ain't... Wait a minute. If you know where the money's hid, how come you didn't grab it and light out of here? You didn't have to come to me. Spang, you used to be a pretty good horse trader. HE CHUCKLES Ain't nobody never sold Spang a horse with buck teeth yet. Then you ought to recognise a good deal when you see one. You take the money. I'll take the girl. Her?! Why not, she's got all of her teeth. I'll say she has, and she bites hard with all of 'em. You mean to say you got a yen for this filly worth $100, 000 in cold cash? I told you I had a personal reason for coming back here. Well, by gravy. What about it? Deal? No offence, princess, but the way I look at it is women gets old and fat but money always stays the same. You got a deal. Now, let's go dig up them ring backs. We'll do it my way. The girl goes with me. You can send two men, two. I don't aim to get ganged up on. Oh, now, Clint you ought to trust me better than that. I trust you, Spang, you trust me, but we just can't trust each other. HE LAUGHS Clint, you old rock, you can horse trade for me any time! Cagle, Donovan, give old Clint here helping hand. SPANGLER LAUGHS Wait! Something for you to remember, princess. In case anyone starts dealing from the bottom of the deck. My men here ain't got no religion about killing a woman. I come into this town for money and women. You know, danged if I can think of one reason Clint gave me for changing my mind. Go watch where they're going. A hotel? Where you got that money hidden, in a mattress? Not exactly. Get that junk out of there, there's a trapdoor underneath. Go on, do as he says. There's no trapdoor in here. What are you trying to pull? Stand still or you'll never find out. You think Spangler's going to let you get away with your skin? Back up and shut up. Get the rope, Dan. Well? They're still in there. This cuts the odds by two, what about the others? They'll be along. Helen, you'd better go upstairs. Hurry. BOTTLE CLATTERS That does it. Too bad Clint ain't married to the princess. She'd make a fine-looking widow. You sure called a turn on Spangler coming after us. All you have to do is think like a corkscrew. Get ready. Clint, Spangler's gonna be coming for you. That's the whole idea. Clint, I want you to live. If I do, it'll be because of this. Take a look through the window. You see anything? Nothing. Get around the side, try to move in. Cagle! Is Cooper still around? You in there? You move your heads again, they'll come off. What's the matter, have you got your ears plugged up, too?! Get in there and untie them. I'll cover you. Get in there! Hold it! That's far enough. Drop it. Well, what are you waiting for? Untie him! They can't, Spang. You have to come in and untie them yourself. You conniving snake of a... I thought I better double-cross you before you double-crossed me. All right, unbuckle it. The other hand. Drop it! GUNSHO SHOTS SHOTS Are you still there, Spang? Yeah, Cooper, I'm here and I'll still be here for your funeral! You'd better go into another business. After today, you couldn't raise enough men to raid an old folks home. We'll see about that. Any time you want to come out, I'll be waiting. You wait here. SHOTS SHOTS GUNSHOTS OUTSIDE GUNSHOT OUTSIDE Helen! Clint said to stay put. There's only two of us left, Spang. We can settle it quick. All right, Clint. You call the play. Just like old times, Spang. I won't draw till you go for your gun. Fair enough. I'm coming out. Guess we're gonna have to forget about old times, Clint. Cagle is fixing to shoot you in the back. That's older than old, Spang. You don't expect me to swallow that. Have it your way, Clint. But Cagle ain't sentimental like us. Any particular place you want to get it, Clint? Any last words? Yeah. Draw! Oh, Clint. Now don't go blaming yourself. You did what you had to do. I know. It takes all kinds of tools to clear the land. I don't think we'll be needing this one any more. Come on.
