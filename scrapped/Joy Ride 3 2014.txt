 

                        1 Ah... Fuck me. - Lay down. Lay down. Lay down. - Okay. Yes! Yes! Harder. Fuck, yeah. Touch me. Please touch me. Stop. Stop. Stop! Just fucking stop for a second! - I need a... I just need to... - Okay. - Come on. - Give me another bump. - What? - Just give me another bump! Are you fucking serious? Yeah, I'm fucking serious. Give me another bump! - Now, go get it. Go. - Okay. Go, go, go. Please. Please! Come on. Come on. Come on. - I'm out. I'm out. - Fuck. I need some. I need some! I don't know what to tell you, okay? Because I'm out. So, go and get some more! Fuck! What do you want me to do? Make it out of thin air? I can't fucking do that, Candy! I'm tapped out! Do you speak fucking English? Do you understand me? Tapped out! Fuck you! You... Jesus Christ! Okay, okay! Fuck! Hey! Calm down, okay? We're cool. For Christ's sake, just calm the fuck down. Okay, I got it. Yeah, I know how to get some more. How? We order in. Yeah, okay. So you're gonna get on this radio. You're going to get some hyped-up, strung-out, horny trucker to come pay us a visit. He's going to come to the door. I'm going to knock him in the fucking head. And, bam. We're in business. Okay? Here. Here. You know how the button works? Okay, just press that button. Hi, there. This is Candy and I'm looking for some company. Any lonely truckers out there? Right. That's good. This is Rusty Nail. I knew a Candy Cane once. Where you at, baby? Come on. Tell him. Tell him. Candy Cane. That's real cute, Rusty. You got any party favors on you? I don't party, little girl. Fuck. Fuck! You know what? It's okay. Just get him to come meet us. And we'll roll him for his cash. - Okay? - Okay. Come on, do it! He's going to... That's okay, big guy, we can have fun other ways. Hey, get his phone number. What's your number, baby? 555-0159. All right, now, just like strike a pose. Like, smile. Look sexy. Okay. Yeah. That's nice. I sent you a text, sweetie. Mmm... Now that's real pretty. Meet me at the Blue Jay Motel off Route 17 for an afternoon delight. Hurry, I can't wait to see you. Hey, tell him room 21. Tell him room 21. Room 21, baby. I'll be there. Okay. I fucking love you, baby. I love you. Fucking love you! So, he comes to the door. I hit him, and we get his wallet and we just get out of here. Okay. Hey, we gotta get dressed. We gotta get dressed. But I don't want to leave. We already paid for the room. Candy, what the fuck do you think is gonna happen if we hang around here after we rob him? We're gonna go to fucking jail, that's what's gonna happen. Okay? - Get dressed! - Okay. Fucking flake out on me, Candy. Fine. I won't. Okay, just stay there. Stay there. I'm gonna fucking smash him. How strange. You do not look anything like your picture. Hey, mister. Hey, please. Please. We're sorry. Okay. Just let us go. We won't tell anyone. I swear. I swear to you. Maybe. But then again, you two haven't exactly shown me a track record of honesty, now have you? No! No! - Shut up. Please? - Please. Please. Baby, are you okay? You have a choice to make. You got into this together. You can get yourselves out of this together. These chains wrapped around your wrists go under the truck, straight to the U-joint on my axle. All you gotta do is hang on for 1 mile and not fall off. I'll set you free. But if one of you slips, the chain will tighten. It'll wrap around the spinning axle and pull you both under the truck. So you're gonna let us go after 1 mile? I'm a man of m word. Here's a little reward. I'll let you keep this bag of crystal I've got. Boy, there's enough there to get you high for a good long time. But don't touch it until I stop. You gotta wait till I give it to you. If you just take it, well, that'd be rude. Okay? Time to go. Climb on up. That's an order! I said, move! Okay. Okay. - Move! Come on! Let's go. - Okay. There you go. Have a nice ride. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Candy. Candy! Candy. Candy! Candy, look at me. Look at me, right in my fucking eyes. Don't stop looking in my eyes, okay? We can do this. We can fucking do this. But you gotta help me. You gotta hold my hand this whole time. All we gotta do is hang on for 1 mile. Okay? Just hang on. Hang on. It's gonna be fine. Okay, just like before. Okay? Hold my hand. Hold my hand. No! Grab my hand! Grab my hand! Hey, hey! Grab my hand! Grab my fucking hand now! Okay, are you okay? I got you. I got you. Are you okay? I got you. I'm just gonna hold your hand. Hey, hey, that's gotta be a mile, man! Come on, that's a fucking mile! That's gotta be a mile! Stop the fucking truck! Good job. You made it. We made it. No. No, no. Keep looking at me. Keep looking at me. No, no, no! No, no. Candy! We'll get that later, baby, just wait till it stops. No! Candy! No! Well I pulled out of Pittsburgh rolling down the eastern seaboard I've got my diesel wound up and she's running like a never before There's a speed zone ahead all right But I don't see a cop in sight Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight I got ten forward gears and a Georgia overdrive I'm taking little white pills and my eyes are open wide I just passed a Jimmy and a White I've been passing everything in sight Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight Well it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye I could have a lot of women but I'm not like some of the guys I could find one to hold me tight But I could never believe it's right Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight Well the ICC is checking on down the line I'm a little overweight and my log book's way behind But nothing bothers me tonight I can dodge all the scales all right Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight My rig's a little old but that don't mean she's slow There's a flame from her stack and the smoke's blowing black as coal My home town's coming in sight If you think I'm happy you're right Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight What's the range on these things? About 5 miles in flat terrain. Yeah? You think that's enough? It should serve the purpose for the race. Those handhelds, we can relay the info to the crew at the pit stops. Testing. One Racer. Come in. Over. Works perfect. Let's get this garbage out of here. So? Think she's ready? I'm telling you, I've gone over every inch of this baby. This car is tight. It's gonna blow the doors off everybody. Yeah. You used to say that in high school shop class. Yeah. I had to carry your ass back there. Otherwise, you would have flunked out. And I'm still doing it today. I seem to remember it differently. - Oh, yeah? - Uh-huh. Yeah, you tried to tank me with Amy Crawford. You remember that? I don't recall. - Oh, you don't recall? - No. - Amy Crawford, high school prom queen. - Hmm. - You recall. Yeah. - Mmm-hmm. I was a junior taking her to prom. And you hated the fact that I was her date. I did? And here I thought you were my wingman. I am your wing man. But when it comes to women, wingman or not, it's every man for himself. Yeah, fair enough. Hey. Did you guys get everything? Yeah. Where are the girls? Shouldn't they be the ones doing the shopping? Oh, Jewel shops. Trust me. But she's also a damn fine driver. Yeah. The last time I checked, she's not driving. So what good are they? Oh, they are good to look at. Watch your mouth, Junior. Thanks. Run through the whole cycle? Yeah, it passed with flying colors. She's ready to roar. Great. The girls said they had some sort of surprise for us. - Hey, baby. - Hey. Could you guys get dressed into your uniforms? I want to take a group photo for the website. No. There's plenty of pictures on there already. Ugh! Come on, Austin. Don't be such a pain in the ass. Just do it. For me. Oh! And, hon, could you set up the camera at the end of the car? Alisa and I will be right back. Yeah. Bobby. No, let's get back to the... - Yeah, it's fine. - Yeah, okay. Oh! Unbelievable. Now that is unbelievably hot. - Like our new uniforms? - I love them, baby. This is ridiculous. We're supposed to be running a racing team, not selling tuner girl calendars. You know you're an ass, right? Okay, let's just line up in front of the car, take a picture. The fans are gonna want to see us before we leave for the race. Come on! Okay! Here's to the Road Rally 1000! Here's to the 100 grand purse! Hey, you the new guy? Yeah. Afternoon. You ever seen anything like this before? - Third body in the last two months. - Jesus Christ! Really? Highway 17. They don't call it Slaughter Alley for nothing. I don't follow. What do we got? A long haul trucker called it in. Body parts. Two victims. White male, female. No identification. We're still looking for most of them. Hey! What caused this? It's hard to say, really. Well, it could have been a murder. We'll know more once we get all the body parts. And I'll let you know when the medical examiner has done his preliminary examination. Any hunches to what might have ripped them up like this? Could have been coyotes. Could have been wolves. I mean, they could have spread the body parts all around. Okay. Keep me informed. Yeah. Will do. Sir. What do you want me to write it up as? Write it up as a possible animal attack. It did look like they got dragged. There's a lot of road rash on those bodies. Do you think it's maybe a good idea if I check around, see if anybody heard anything? Check around as much as you like. Just don't start scaring people. We've got enough trouble with this Slaughter Alley bullshit. I get it. I'll keep it low key. Okay, radio me when you're all cleaned up here. Will do. And? Slightly better than the last run, a 3% increase. Damn it. I was kind of hoping for more. Yeah. Well, all this testing doesn't mean much. We need a real world dry run. Yeah, I know. We just don't have the time. Well, we need to make the time. It's just stupid not working out the engine. You calling me stupid? Yeah, I am. Yeah, you would. Besides, you know, you should really let me drive. I should let you drive, shouldn't I? Okay. You know what? I'll tell you what, big guy. You can drive right now. - There you go. You wanna drive? - No, thanks. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. You wanna get back in here? All right, sit down back there. You're making Bobby nervous. Whoo! What's that? - Relax, Mick. - All right, who's hungry? Oh, yeah. Good. There's a truck stop two miles up with a caf. American fine dining at its best. We're pulling over for lunch. Is that a serious question? Of course I do. Morning. Excuse me, I don't drink coffee. I'll be back for your order. Uh... - Colorful. - Wow. Oh, my God. She's the spitting image of Large Marge! Who? Really? Anyone? Large Marge? Pee-wee's Big Adventure? What are you talking about, Bobby? You know, the youth today, they've got no sense of history, no sense of culture. It's just devastating. Sorry. Move over. What are we talking about? Nothing. Trust me. All right, did you see this route on your GPS? No, maybe it's an old route they shut down. Okay, well, if it's open, it'll be a more direct route. We could shave a day off our time. But if it's not on the GPS, then it might not even exist anymore. You're right. So, what'll it be? - Burgers? - Burgers. - Yeah. - Yeah, burgers. Yeah, please. All around. Everything on 'em. And we'll have them to go, please. We're in a bit of a rush. Of course you are. Thanks, Marge. So, what do you guys want to do? I mean, I would love an extra day on the course. Get the lay of the land. You're sitting in a truck stop. Go and ask a trucker, they'll know. Yeah, that's a good idea. Come on. Which one? Excuse me, sir. Hi. - Could we have a moment of your time? - What do you want? Directions, actually. Can I show you this map? Suit yourself. You recognize this highway? Route 17. Does it still exist? 'Cause we can't find it on our GPS. It exists, but you don't want to take it. Why not? We're heading up to Canada, and we figured that route would cut at least a day off our trip. Trust me, you don't want to take it. Why not, exactly? Is it a rough road? Is it under repair? What? You know what they call that stretch of highway? - No. - Slaughter Alley. You know why? Obviously not. Because more people die or disappear on that road than any other road in the United States. Really? Some say it's the road itself that's dangerous. Well, I'm a pretty good driver. I mean, I'm not going to crash, if that's what you mean. Well, you might just disappear. They say a trucker patrols that highway looking for people to kill. You do know that most serial killers are truck drivers, right? No, that's not true. Ask him. Barry here trying to scare you off Highway 17? Yeah. There's nothing wrong with that highway. Barry, here, has a flair for the dramatic. Pay no attention to him. Then why don't you tell them what you were doing up there this morning, Chris? There was a fatality. An accident. We are investigating. It looked like a murder to me, some kind of satanic sacrifice. Jesus, Barry! You need to get back on your meds. Just stay below the speed limit. You'll be fine. That is until your car shuts off by itself. What do you mean by that? It's some sort of electronic dead zone out there. Sometimes everything just shuts off. Your phones. Your CBs. Your engines. Your lights. Some say it's aliens. I say it's the government, the damn NSA. They've got some sort of top secret giant listening post out there in the wasteland. They don't want us to find out about it. Okay. Thank you very much for sharing with us your conspiracies of government and aliens and... We'll let you get back to your meal. Thank you. Yeah. - The map. - Oh, yeah. Of course it's the drug runners you really have to worry about. Now them boys, they are ruthless. Slaughter Alley's just a straight shot from them socialistic industrial pot farms they got up in Canada. It's not very well patrolled. So, you don't wanna run into one of them. Y'all have a nice day now. - See you later. - You, too. Okay. That's amazing. - So? - Intense. Intense. - Let's take a ride on Slaughter Alley. - Let's do it. What about the drug thing? That was kind of legitimate. Yeah, and he also talked about aliens and secret government militaries. Come on, that guy said that nobody patrols over there. We could take the car. Test it out. Really open her up. Well, we'd have a story to tell. I don't know. - Let's do it. - Yeah? Yeah! - I get to drive, though. - No, no. Why do you always get to drive? - You got this? - Yeah. Marge. Bobby, what the hell? Oh, my God! Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Whoo! All right, Mick. I'm gonna back-track 20 miles. Warm it up. - We'll catch up. - Copy that. Give me updates through hand-held, all right? Will do. All right, we better turn around and catch up to the others. Okay. You're red-lining. I'm shifting. I'm just saying, don't blow the engine before we get there. That's all. I know the limits of this car. I know exactly how much it'll take, and I'm not timid about pushing her. You think Jordan's timid? Jordan's smart. He actually crosses the finish line. He doesn't crash and burn like some douchebag I know. Hey, that wasn't my fault. The head gasket blew. And then you ran the fucking car into the wall, you spastic shithead. Whoa, baby. Thanks. I can take care of myself. Maybe I should drive. - You might want to slow it down a bit. - What for? You don't need to scare the poor guy. Fuck him. Watch this. Dude! That's a really shitty thing to do, man. I'm just waking him up. You just can't help yourself, can you? What? Screwing with people for the hell of it. It's a gift. Just pull over, all right. I got it. I thought I was driving. Look, I said just pull over. Okay, thank you. Stop it, man. I will kill you. Hey! What took you so long? Austin was busy making friends with the local truckers. - What? - Never mind. - How'd she run? - Smooth. Did a ton and a half. Didn't even break a sweat. Nice. Diagnostics working okay? All green. You know what, if the car is running so smooth, maybe you should consider giving your mechanic a little raise. What the hell? What is that? Jesus, what is that guy's problem? It's that guy Austin pissed off. Did I mention that was an asshole move, by the way? What the hell is this guy doing? He's going to try and pass us. That's fine. I'm just going to be cool and let him pass. What an asshole. - That guy nearly hit you. - I know. I know. Now he's slowing down. Let's blow by this jerk and leave him in our dust. Yeah, let's teach this guy a lesson. This guy's a bigger prick than me. This guy's totally fucking with us. - I'll go left. You go right. - Got it. I can't get around him. Can you see anything over there? No, no. You've got nothing here. - This guy's good. - No! He's fucking nuts! I'll play possum on the right. - It'll give you a window. - Yeah, I got it. Yeah, that's right, bitch! My turn. Let's see how this guy likes his blind spot. - Go! Go! - Yeah, this guy likes his blind spot. Run up! Whoo! We got him. - He's coming back. - What's with this guy? - Holy shit! - I got it. I got it. Hold on! Jesus! Son of a bitch! You guys okay? He just tried to run us off the road. Fuck! You all right? He's coming for you now. Yeah. Move, Jordon. Move! Relax. He couldn't touch me if he tried. Shit! - Did he hit them? - No. They're fine. - We should stop. - Trucker's fine. - We should call the cops! - Look, they're fine. We're fine. Okay, if we get the cops involved, that could cost us a day. Jordon! Look, it's not like we're completely innocent here, babe. All right? If I get a driving mark on my record, it could cost us the race. Jordan's right. We've got a race to run. Maybe we should just tell them that he ran us off the road. We could call it in anonymously. It's the right thing to do. Listen, guys, if someone got hurt, I would have stopped. But nobody did, okay. We're all fine. Trucks jackknife all the time. Okay, just trust me on this. I know what I'm doing. One Racer. Come back, One Racer. Are you out there? Who is it? I don't know. - Who is this? - Is this One Racer and the fancy racecar? Yes, it is. Well, this is Rusty Nail. Who are you? I'm the trucker you just ran off the road... Jordon. - And how do you know my name? - I know your name, Jordon. I know your whole team. Yeah, what do you want? You're gonna have to pay for what you did. You will. And FYI, you're not gonna make it to that race. Just shut it off! Don't talk to him anymore. Well, what are we gonna do? I don't know. We just keep going. Drive hard for the border. Hopefully we don't run into him again. He sounded pissed. Yeah, well, good thing he's in a big rig 50 miles behind us. We'll open that gap up. - Yeah. - What have we gotten into? Look, just stick on our tail, okay? We're gonna head for the border. Stay together. What if he calls the cops? Just drive. This place is a beauty, huh? Here. Pay with cash. Leave no paper trail. We'll try to hurry up. All right, babe? He rammed me and just knocked the trailer right off the back. I didn't see anything. What's wrong? Why are you so mad? Because he should have stopped and called the cops. Now we can all get in trouble. - Can we really? - Yeah. It was a dumb thing to do. I always thought he would do the right thing, but I guess I was wrong. - Hello? - What if he reported us, Jordon? Well, if he saw our license plate, there could be a BOLO out for us. We have two cars. We filled them up. Ah! You should have let me fill you up. We got it. - What about your change? - Keep it. I can't get in any trouble. You? You're not the one with a criminal record, dipshit. Which is why we gotta get to the border. To avoid the police. You know what? You're making the wrong decision. You're being a fucking idiot. You can't make that decision for the rest of us. I know what I'm doing, Jewel. Yeah, you keep saying that. But the truth is, you don't know what you're doing. And you're not going to be doing it anymore. Austin, you started this shit. We're gonna take the support truck to the next town, and we're going to the police. That is that. Come on. Yeah, and what about the race? You know what, Jordon? Go to the race. Do what you want. I don't care. I'm doing this. Well, doesn't sound like the police are looking for us. For now. No, no, no. They repeat BOLOs all the time. There's been nothing but the usual chatter for the last hour or so. Still doesn't mean anything. Jesus! You're changing the tire. Gee, thanks. Ah. That's weird. My GPS cut out and it's on satellite. I'll check the GPS app on my phone. No bars. Well, I guess we keep driving till we hit a cell tower. Make yourself useful and put this away. What are you doing? Driving. How far ahead do you think Jordon and the others are? We broke down for what, 30 minutes? Yeah, about that. They could be as far as 45 miles ahead. Still no cell service. Try the cs? Testing. Hello, is anybody out there? Testing. Hey! It's working. Shit! What the fuck is that? Shit. Okay, just speed up! - This guy's a fucking psycho. - Why is he doing this? I don't know! Just keep going. Austin, do something! Oh, God. Call for help! Jordon! Jordon! It's Austin. Come in! Jordon, come in! It's Austin. Got any signal yet? No. There's nothing. He's coming along side of us. - He's going to pass us. - Oh, my God. What do I do? What do I do? There. I got it. - Really? Call them up. - Yeah. Austin, Jewel, come in. Austin, Jewel, come in. Over. Austin! Come in, buddy. It's Mickey. I've got a signal! I'll try giving Jewel a call. Austin. Come on, buddy. We really need to hear from you. Hi, it's Jewel. You know what to do. Voicemail. Well, they're probably just going through the same stretch of road we just went through. Yeah. Please. Why are you doing this? Just leave us alone. Please. Listen to me. Look, I didn't mean it, man. We were just kidding around. Please! Where are you taking me, man? No, please! - Keep walking. - Please. Here we go. No, no, no! Are you a religious man, Austin? No! I mean, yes. I mean, I can be. I will be from now on. No, no. Please! Please! I'll do anything. - No! - What is it they say? Idle hands are the devil's workshop. No! No, no, no! No, no, no! I think I prefer the one that says, "If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off." No, no, no! Or maybe I'll just go for the one that says, "An eye for an eye." I'm getting worried. - I know. - I think we should turn around. Yeah. She's right, Jordon. We need to see if they're okay. They could be broken down. Or in jail. Look, we've got cell phone and CB reception for now. So if we don't hear from them in 15 minutes, we turn around. - Fine. - Okay. Fair enough. You've got 15 minutes starting now. It's time we had a little chat. One Racer. One Racer. Come in, Jordon. It's your pal, Rusty Nail. Yeah, what do you want? It's not what I want. It's what I have that you want. Yeah? What's that? Your pretty little girlfriend and your cocky co-driver. Yeah, how do I know you have them? Jordon, please. Come get me! Please! Fuck! Believe me now? Look, just please don't hurt them, okay? Please. It was an accident. No, no, no. Sorry, no deal. You're going to have to pay. Yeah, how much? I'll pay whatever you want. I don't think pocket change is going to cover it, Jordon. But there is a way you could make me whole. How? That fancy racecar of yours. I'll trade you Austin and Jewel for the car. - You gotta do it. - That should make us even. Fuck it. Yeah, deal. Done. Just don't hurt them, okay? Please. There's an old warehouse off Highway 17. On Four Points Road. One hour. Or you will never see your friends again. - How far? - No, there's no way. - It's almost 100 miles. - What do you mean? - There's no way we're going to make it. - Seriously? Look, we need more time. Look, can you hear me? We need more time to get there. Come on. - We gotta go! - Are you there? We gotta go! Let's go! Say cheese. Just one for the record. This is Williams. I've got a crashed truck on Route 17. I need an ambulance and a wrecker. Over. Roger that. Jenkins. You there? Yeah. What's the situation? You got to get out here and see this. Wake up. Wake up, Sleeping Beauty. That was a nasty wreck. And that is a nasty gash. Why don't you tell Jordon where you need to go? - Tell Jordon! - I need to go to a hospital. - Louder! - Take me to the hospital! And what does Jordon have to do so you can go to the hospital? Give you the car! - Give me what? - Give you the car. - Very good. - Please don't do this. Untie me. I don't want to do this. No! We've got to have a plan. We give him the car. We get Austin and Jewel, and we call the cops. And we tell them he kidnapped our friends and stole our car. What if he double-crosses us? We can't take a chance with their lives. Look, she's right. We can't. I'm not saying we take a chance with their lives. All I'm saying is that I don't trust this fucker. Yeah? What'd you have in mind? Jordon! All right. I'm going to walk in from here. You two go down the sides. Okay? Stay within eye contact. Stay hidden. He can't see you. Only me. All right. Good luck. Hey. Give me a second to get in position, all right? - Hey, I'm coming with you. - No. What? No, you're staying here. It's too dangerous. Besides, someone's gotta stay with the car in case something happens. - I'm not staying here. - Yes, you are. You stay in the car, and you keep the doors locked. Let me handle this, okay? I'll come back for you. Okay. These are the keys. - This will all be over in a few minutes. - All right. This is Jordon. I'm here. I have the car and I want my friends back. Five minutes to spare. I'm ready for the exchange. I have the keys. The car's at the entrance. Just come on in. I'll tell you when to stop. Look, I want to talk to my friends to know that they're all right. You're in no position to be making demands. I want to talk to them! Fine. Check your phone. ...so you can go to the hospital? Give you the car! You fucker. Give you the car. You better not hurt her! You come in now or this is off. Look, I'm here. I've got the keys. Now bring me my friends. I'm standing in front of your truck. Okay, I held up my part of the deal. Now you hold up yours. Hey! I know you can hear me! Come out and talk to me. Bobby? Hey! Alisa! Hey! Let's go! Let's go! Bobby, hurry! Hurry! - Where's Bobby? - I don't know. - I haven't seen him. - We've gotta go. We can't wait for him. We gotta move! Step out of the truck slowly. Get out of the goddamn vehicle now! Slowly! Slowly! Hands where I can see them. Hands up over your head! Higher! On your knees. Hands behind your head. Lock your goddamn fingers, now! Don't you fucking move. - Left or right? - Fuck it. I don't know. Go right! - Call the police. - It's about time you came to your senses. - I'll call. - What's in the truck? What's that up ahead? - Hey. - What? - Highway Patrol car. - Yes! Hey! Hey! Hey! - Officer, hey! - Put your hands above your heads. Put your hands above your heads right now! We've got an emergency, okay? You need to listen to us. - Our friends have been kidnapped. - You have to help us. - Are you the kids from the diner? - Yeah, that's us. Fresh meat? Look, a trucker kidnapped our friend. Okay? - Can I show you something? - Don't fucking move! Whoa! It's a cell phone, dude. Slowly. Okay. I just want to show you something, okay? It's a picture. All right? It's just a picture. It's my girlfriend. He took her. Okay, you can put your hands down now. Okay, tell me what happened. This trucker, he took two of our friends. Okay, we were gonna do this exchange at a warehouse. We met him. We were gonna give him the car for our friends. He tried to hit me with his big rig. Okay, but we don't know where the hell he went. Did you see a truck go this way at all? Yeah. About 15 minutes ago. - A black Peterbilt? - Yeah, it was. - That's him! - Okay. You kids get back in the car. You follow me. We'll catch him. I was deadheading back from Fargo. I get a call from dispatch. They've got a rush load. The refrigeration unit is out. So I was trying to haul ass to the processing plant before the whole damn load rotted. Jesus Christ! What the fuck did you do? Get down on the ground! Get down on your knees right fucking now! - Whoa, whoa! - What did you do? I swear to God I had nothing to do with this. - On the fucking ground! - I had nothing to do with this. I just picked up a rogue load. Some guy on the CB called, said his truck broke. Face down on the fucking ground. On the fucking ground now! What is that? Oh, Shit! - Go follow him! - Okay. Yeah, yeah! Jenkins, this is Williams. I got him. I got our killer. Over. I swear to God, I had nothing to fucking do with this. Jenkins, this is Williams. I've got our suspect in custody. I repeat, I've got our suspect in custody. Over. One Racer, come back, One Racer. Yeah, this is One Racer. You broke the rules, Jordon. You killed a police officer. Yes, I did. Now one of you is going to have to pay with a lot more than just a fucking car. I want you to listen to what you've wrought. Dispatch, this is Williams. Have you heard from Jenkins? Not a peep, Charlie. What's going on out there? Damn it. I got a murder suspect. I'm bringing him in for questioning. Find Jenkins, now. Help! Somebody please! Help! Please, somebody! No! No! Oh, God, no! Oh, God, no! Oh, no! Oh, God! Oh, God, no! One Racer. Come back, One Racer. - Yeah, this is Jordon. - Hello, Jordon. I want you to listen and learn. This is what happens when you break the rules. Say hello, Bobby. Jordon! Please help me! Fuck! Don't you hurt him, okay? - Way too late for that, my friend. - No. No. Fuck! Help me! Fucking help me! Jewel! Jewel! How does that feel in there, Bobby? Make him stop. Getting a little snug up there. No! Oh, my God. Please let him go! Please! Fuck! Turn this thing off! What the fuck was that? You caused this, Jordon. You made the choice, and now your friend is dead. Can you live with that? Can you wake up every morning and face what you've done? No, you fucking did this, you son of a bitch! You killed him! - Hello? Hello? - 911, what's your emergency? I need help! Okay, there's this guy. He's trying to kill our friends! - Please hold. - He's fucking killing my friends! I've got another choice for you to make, Jordon. This is gonna be a tough one. But I'm gonna give you one last chance to set things right. I want you, Jordon. You have to pay for what you did. And I will give you the opportunity. There's an old junkyard off 17 at Canyon Junction. Meet me there. Turn yourself over to me, and I'll set your girlfriend and Austin free. - Please, Jordon! Please help me, please! - Fuck, come on. Well, the choice is yours, Jordon. Don't make me wait. - Hello? - I get impatient when I wait. I don't know where we are! Come on! You've got to help us. He's got them. You've got to help us! Sir, I can't help you if you don't tell me where you are. I don't know where we are! - We're, like, by some junkyard... - Give me the phone! Shit! - Stop the car. - No. - I said, stop the car. - And I said, no. We can't just leave Jewel and Austin to die. You're fucking crazy! - Come on, let's go. - Mickey, don't! - You're coming with me. - No! Look, if we go back there, we're all gonna die. Do you understand? We can't leave them! Be smart, all right? Come with me. We'll go get help. We'll let the police handle this. It'll be too late. Look, you heard what he did to Bobby, all right. Look, this has gotten out of control. What makes you think he won't do the same to you and Jordon? - I know. - Then why are you doing this? - I just... - You just what? Why? I can't! I can't just leave them! Sounds like she made her decision. Please don't go. This is your decision. You want to go with him, go with him. If anything happens to her, I'll kill you myself. So how are we going to get them back? It didn't work last time. And now you only have me. I'm gonna do what he says. Give yourself up? Yes. That's crazy. He'll kill you. Yeah, maybe. Maybe not. Look, if it'll save Jewel's life, then it's worth it. Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh, God, no! Jesus Christ! Dispatch, this is Williams. Officer down! I repeat, officer down! All units respond to Highway 17. Mile marker... Mile marker 61. No! God, no! Someone help me! No! God, please, no! Listen! I'm sorry, sir. So sorry! Please! You shouldn't have jacked me up with the cops, Mickey. You got ahead of yourself. That makes me mad. Powell just reported he found another body. - What? - Well, half a body. Female found on the side of the road near the bridge. All right. All right. Everyone. Over here, now! All right, listen up. Another body has been found. I want roadblocks on 17 and on every turnoff to an access road for the next 100 miles. Nobody gets through. Every vehicle gets stopped and inspected. Look for damage. Somebody had to have hit Jenkins. There's a killer on the road. And I want him. Okay, you take the car. You find a house. You find a gas station. Whatever it takes. And you go to the police for help. No, I can't leave you here. There's nothing you can do to help me here. He's gonna kill you. Yeah. Yeah. He's probably going to damn well try, okay. But hopefully Mickey's got the police on the way by now. Do you think Mickey's okay? Yeah, Mickey's a tough nut. He's fine. But if he doesn't have the police on the way here, then you're our only chance for survival right now, okay? You. You see this place? It's huge. Okay, I'm gonna go in there. I'm gonna get Austin. I'm gonna get Jewel. We're gonna hide. And we're gonna hold up until either you or Mickey come back. All right. Okay. All right. Rusty, I'm here. Hey, Rusty. I'm here. Rusty, I'm here. Rusty! I said I'm here! Hey, Rusty! Come out and get me! No, please! No, please! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Please! No! You know, I really like your girlfriend. You set Jewel and Austin free. Then I'll surrender to you. Oh, I don't think so. We've grown so close in the last few hours. - We had a deal. - So close. I think I've got a crush on her. Oh, my God! - Jewel! Jewel, I'm right here, baby. - Oh, my God. No! You let her go, you son of a bitch! Maybe. What the fuck do you mean, maybe? I'm talking to you! Or maybe not. Come and get her, boy. Learned that from a hockey ninja. Let me go! - No, please! Oh, God, no! - Is that the best you've got, kid? You're gonna have to do better than that. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. No! Now don't you go running off. Oh, my God! She's in the crusher! Shut it off! - How? - Turn the switch! Push it! Shut it off! Come on! Help me up! - Give me that. - Please, no! - Jewel! - Please, no! Jewel! I'm coming, baby! Oh, God, no! Please, no! Please, no! Jewel! Jewel! What the... What the hell? Oh, shit. Holy shit. Shit. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No! No, no! No! Please! No! Please! No! Oh, God! No! Please! No, please stop! No! Oh, God, no! No! No, please! No! No! Please! Oh, my God, no! Oh, my God! Help me, God! No, please! No, no! No! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, my God! No! No! No, no, no! No! No! No, please! No! No, no, no! No! Well, you're halfway to the hospital now, Jewel. I'm gonna fucking kill him. I'm gonna fucking kill him! Give me this. - Where is he? - He's gone! His truck's gone. Come on! We've gotta find him! My leg! Come on! We got to get out of here! We got to get out. We got to get out. Oh, my God. I'm stuck! - What? - I can't! My leg is stuck! What do you mean? Oh, no! Come on! Come on! Yes! Yes! All right. Yes! Come on. Come on. Here we go. Damn it. No, no, no! Come on. Back, back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes! You like that, Rusty? Huh? Here we go. You like that? How about you go to the crusher? Yeah! Come on! Yeah! Boom! Alisa! Alisa, are you all right? Come on. I've got you. He's dead. Let's get out of here. Yeah. He said his name was Rusty Nail. A CB handle? Yeah, something like that. Any idea why he'd want to hurt you and your friends? Because he was a psychopath. Yeah, okay. The ME is ready for them now. Detective Assael is going to take the two of you down to the coroner's office. We need you to identify a body. Who is it? Well, we can't say for sure, but we believe it's a Mr. Cole. Mickey. I'm sorry. They're ready to go. Nobody could survive this. Open her up. I want to see the body. Okay, coming up. Back off! Okay. Away. He's still out there. Hey, thanks for stopping. - You want a lift, buddy? - Yes, sir. Climb on in. What's your name? Rusty. Rusty Nail.
