Please take a few moments now to locate your nearest exit... Okay, I love you but I gotta go. The jacket may also be manually inflated by pulling the air tubes at shoulder level In the event of a change in cabin air pressure, an oxygen masks will automatically drop from a compartment above your seat. - To start the flow of oxygen... - What do you mean the hair is not good? And did I not tell you I want blue eyes? Gouge the eyeballs out! Just tear them out. Okay, I gotta go. Okay, we're taking off. We wish you all an enjoyable flight. Excuse me, sir. You need to put that in the overhead compartment. Here, I'll get it. No, just... I'll do it. Okay. It's okay. It will be safe up there. So I'm backpacking through Asia. It's going to be awesome. I'm going to catch some waves in Bali... - Excuse me. All electronic devices must be... - No problem. - Off. - Flight attendant, prepare for takeoff. Total urban myth by the way. I guarantee if I leave this thing on, this plane is not going to crash. So why did they say it then? That's the man trying to keep us down, controlling our thoughts. Duh. Duh. Yes, ma'am. Vista Pacific 7500. You are clear for take off on runway 2-8-1. Engage thrust mode. 8 nauts. She's a beautiful little girl. She had blond hair and blue eyes. - She lived in a castle, see? - Mmm-hmm. The captain has turned off the seat belt sign. So feel free to move about the cabin. However we do recommend when seated to keep your seat belt securely fastened in case of any unexpected turbulence. See? Urban myth. What if you killed us all? But I didn't. What's with the phone stash? I can score a hundred bucks each for one of these, you need one? Oh no, I don't need a stolen cellphone, thank you. Hey. Times are tough, sister. Look around! There's a global financial crisis. Boomers screwed the pooch, man. They ain't helping out Gen Y. Gotta make a living somehow. Surfing ain't free. Who say it isn't, it's water. En cast, girlfriend, en cast. So this is my dress. I actually designed it myself. Oh honey, there's your dad. Rick's dad, well, he's great. When he gets drunk, he gets a little touchy feely, doesn't he? You know, nobody tells you about all the questions, like should you put your hair up, should you put your hair down. Oh, I didn't realize, you're also married. Look at our rings, did I show you my... well, mine is a little bigger, but they're both so pretty. Have you seen 16-I? Oh, yeah, he's eating his way through our pretzels supply. Hey Jackie, can I have those two bottles of champagne? Well, What about row 11, miserable married couple. They haven't said a word the entire flight. They hate each other's gut. Do you think she married for passion or do you think he was her safe choice? Uh...he greased my ass twice already, - so, I think wrong choice. - Eww... And then we have "bridezilla" in 16-F. She won't quit with the wedding photos. But she didn't take 18 months to nail on a date. It's hard planning a wedding when you're flying around the world. Exactly! 30,000 feet above reality. - You and me both. - I thought you love this job. I do love this job but... life is messy when you grow up. Yeah. So what's the deal? Do you think he's really going to leave his wife? Three days alone in Tokyo. It's gonna work out. You'll see. I think we have chicken or fish, and you know, should we have a live band or... Oh! Can you...? Oh. - She must've needed the restroom. - Yeah. She's lovely. I'm gonna show the girl next to us...yeah, sure. Okay. Excuse me. Would you like to see our wedding photos? You know, it's such an amazing day. What? I, uh...sorry, I can't hear you. - Okay. - Excuse me, would you like something to drink? Do great with milk, please. Imotional issues very close up.

Squeeze my hand for "Yes". Okay? Do you have chest pain? Are you epileptic? - Diabetic? Asthma? - No... - Pulse is 90. - Take a breath. Deep breath. Okay. Everything's fine. Please... I don't wanna die on a plane, please, please, please... Breathe! Breathe in! Breathe in! - Oh, no! - Look! Grab him! Grab his leg! Sir. - He's not breathing. - What do we do? Take him to the galley.

There's not a chance of resuscitation Where it's deemed landing as unnecessary and dangerous. Roger that, Vista Pacific 7500. What are your intentions? Continue the flight plan as filed. Roger that, Vista Pacific 7500 Heavy. We'll have a medical team waiting for you at Haneda. Understand. How many passengers saw what happened? Umm, 11 through 18 in Economy, I don't know about the rest, the curtains were closed. Okay. That's good. So if anyone asked, just say a passenger is ill. Radio lights to be out throughout the night till Tokyo. Wouldn't want to cause a panic. What do we do with the body? We can relocate everyone comfortably downstairs in Economy and still provide you with upper class services and amenities. And as compensation, each passenger will receive two vouchers for upper pass round trip travel everywhere in the world. - What happened? - I don't know. The guy just flatlined. Yes, I under... I understand, um... I'm afraid there's no choice. In events like this the pilot in command has... the legal authority to enforce these decisions. No need no worry, okay? - Uh-huh. - Get your bag. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Can I help you? - Can I help you? - That's okay. Screen display: 35,536 ft / 10,831m Ground speed: 898 km/h In-Flight time: 2 hr 28 minutes Time to Destination: 8 hr 20 minutes So let me get this straight. We're going on our honeymoon and you just gave CPR to a man with blood all over his mouth. He was dying! Well, whatever he's dying from is now all over your lips. Herpes, party for one, your table's ready. Hey, Liz. Now it's a party for two. Hey, I saw him moved, seriously. Down there, check it out. How long before his body starts decomposing? I have no idea. I can smell him already. We're trapped with a dead body for the next 6 hours? Okay. Okay. - I'm sorry about that. - Yeah. Don't you act like you're not all freaked out there, creepy scorpion girl! Death is a part of life. A part of your life, maybe, but not a part of mine. There will be one day. I knew it. Already cooled! Back it up a little. There you go. Almost there. Okay. Good. Uh... Where? How about right here, guys. Got it? Yes. - Thank you. - All right. - Thanks, guys. - Great. Suzy, we gotta buckle him in. Where's this stupid seat belt! Okay. Lets go. Lets get out of here. Hey. You were helping the dead guy, right? - What happened to him? - I don't know. Was it contagious? It might be. Hey. You know, um, about what you were saying before? You know, "death is a part of life." I agree with you. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the guy who died, probably thought he had all the time in the world. He sat on the plane, had no idea it was all going to end today. And maybe he wanted to write a book. Maybe he wanted to have kids. Sorry, too late. But if you remember that one day, you and I, all of us, we'll all be dead. You won't want to waste one second of whatever time you have left. Yeah. I wish I could live like that. Why can't you? People get all tied up in what they think they should do. When you die, you die. No one's gonna give you gold stars in heaven for going to business school or marrying a hot wife. How did you know I went to business school? Didn't? Wrong guess. - It's obvious, isn't it? - Yeah. Excuse me! Hey, hon', I was just, uh, showing her our wedding photos and thinkin' of figuring how we could organize them by doing... Yeah, forget the photos. Okay. People are going to start dropping in the aisles with blood pouring out their anuses. This is my honeymoon. "Pregnancy test" Hi, can I get you some coffee? - Coffee? - Please. Sure. Here you go. Please don't smile. Please don't smile. Everybody, put your seatbelts on! Suzy, go! - Oh God! - No! Oh, No! Cabin Pressure Oxygen Deployed Tom, put your mask on! Come on! Come on! Come on, Tom, breathe! Tom, put it on! Brad! It's not working! Take mine! No! No! Put it on! All right. Hang on. Pia. Pia. "Emergency Oxygen" Pia. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe! I'm removing my mask. - You okay? - Yeah. This is the Captain speaking. We've just experienced a cabin de-pressure... our on board computer indicates... that a seal was damaged from previous turbulence. We isolated the issue and we're flying at a lower altitude. Cabin pressure has been restored to normal. You may remove your oxygen masks and breathe freely. Any passengers in distress, please notify Flightcom. Everyone stays in your seats, with seatbelts fastened. Sorry, Are you okay? Is everyone okay? Oh, my God. Come on. Come on. Come on. Just breathe. Just breathe. Breathe, please breathe. Come on. Please, breathe. Please.... That's it, that's it. Slow down. Slow down. It's okay. It's okay. It's Okay. You okay? You're okay. You're okay. You're safe. - How are you doing, you okay? - Um, yeah. I told you we shouldn't have come on this trip. I thought we were going down. Yeah. You know, I should have known 'cause my fingernails were blue. It's oxygen deprivation. Can you clean that up? - Hey, Suzy. We should do a sweep. - Okay. Okay. - Any trash? - Thank you. We could've tried again. I couldn't, not a third time. What if it happens again? When I was younger, all I wanted to do is be a mom. I never talked about a job and career. 'Cause you wanted to be happy while your friends think you're cool and ambitious. But... in my heart, my real dream, I just wanted a home with you and our children running around. Yeah, so did I. I was just... helpless... for the first time. Do you want a blanket? - I'm just going to stretch my legs. - Yeah. Honey, look... What? You okay? That dead guy is freaking me out. Molly! Oh, no. All right. Thanks for the watch. So. Here I am... with my brand new Rolex. It's a little present from my new friend...over here. He got some hygeine issues and uh... he doesn't talk very much either. Really, I'm just dying for you to meet him... So, here... is.... Aah! Tokyo Radio. This is Vista Pacific Flight 7500 Heavy, do you copy? Tokyo Radio. This is Vista Pacific Flight 7500 Heavy, do you copy? Death is a part of life. - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fine. Ever had anyone died on a flight before? No, first time. - It's so sad. - Yeah, it's crazy. Hey you know that guy in row 13, the one that's always playing video games? Yeah. 13F. He hasn't been in his seat in a while. What? Um.... - 13 F? - Yeah. Excuse me. Do you know where the passenger who's sitting there is? Did he move seat? Um, yeah. He went upstairs. Upstairs? Come on. Hello? Sir, you need to go back to your seat. The body's gone. We have to go. Remember that trip we took to Cabo? When we, uh, had a huge fight in the hotel room and didn't speak for what? Four days? - Mm-hm. - Yeah, I remember. Why are you bringing up the worst time we ever had? Because I keep thinking about how much time we wasted. The weather was great, the hotel was beautiful. I just... we were the disaster. Yeah. I don't want to waste anymore time. What do you mean "the body is gone"? I think this kid moved it as a prank. Oh, better find it or else we all will be grounded. Look, it gotta be on board. Just do a sweep row by row. We're gonna do a sweep, row by row, okay? - Okay, Yeah. - Hey, Pete, um, Can I ask you something? Did you happen to see a...a jet flying near us? a, an F-16? An F-16? No. I'll investigate and report back. Thank you, Captain. It'll be fine, gonna be fine... Please. Please. Please. Thank God. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah...! Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Just one second. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Excuse me. - Sure, I uh... Alright. There you go. Hey, I just overheard the flight attendant... the dead body is missing. - What? - How could it be missing? I don't know. The passenger's missing too. I saw him go upstairs, never came back, and... Okay. this is going to sound weird, but I saw something on my monitor. - It kinda look like that dead guy. - Come on! Holy scrap! I saw him too. Why won't you tell me that? This is not the time for us to talk about our communication issue. - There's a dead body missing, focus! - Yeah, I know. Hey, guys. We need to find out who the hell that dead guy is. 'Cause whatever's going on, it's because of him. Yeah. Hey, check his carry-on. I don't understand. He's gone. You know what I always wonder? What do people think about just before they die? You know who I'd be thinking about? My first boyfriend, Sean Osborne. He kissed me and my knees would literally go weak. I had to... hold on him just so I wouldn't fall. Always hoped I'd find that with Nick. and I never quite got there. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. Yeah. So... - any luck with the body? - No. Peter. I know you're not gonna leave your wife. - What? - It...it's okay, you know. You have kids together. Yeah, I wish it was different. It's all timing. Laptop. An ID. Here we go. Dead guy's name, Lance Morrell from Corona, California. This is hair? Has names on it, Tracy, Anne, Katy. - Oh my God. They're his victims. - We don't know that. This product is known in the State of California to cause cancer. - This is what he's using to kill them. - With cancer? Really? Worked like a weapon? My mom always said that my dad gave her cancer. - Laptop's locked. - Uh... Will you try his birthday? 4 15 72. No? I don't know. You're stealing that dead guy's stuff? Have fun! Try to keep them together. Works like a purse, you know? What's this? What are you doing? It's not what you think. This is, uh, Lance Morrell's stuff. The passenger who died. You've no right to be going through someone else's property. Yeah? Well something happening on this plane and it all started when he died. Look, we know the body is missing, and the passenger. - And you saw something, too? - I didn't see anything. Through the window, I heard you. We need to get into his checked luggage. His checked luggage in the cargo hold? Yeah, there might be something in there that will tell us what's going on. - You can get in there. - Enough! Now go back to your seats. - Yes, ma'am. - Okay. Do you want me to come with you? Nope, I want you at the hatch. What is that? - It says it's a shinigami. - It's a death doll. Looks like Lance was delivering to a client in Tokyo. Cool. In Japanese mythology, shinigami is a death spirit. When you're ripped from your life too quickly, you have to let go of whatever is holding you here, so you can move on. Once you've done that, the real shinigami will take your soul to the afterlife. Why would someone bring that on a plane? I don't know but I can tell you one thing. This Lance guy's holding on, he's not letting go. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! I'm sorry, Meg. Radio Tokyo. Come in. This is Vista Pacific Flight 7500 Heavy. No! No! Did you guys hear that? I don't want that on the plane. How should we do that? Open up a window? Hey, you okay? Aah! What the fuck was that? Alright, alright, stay calm, stay calm. We're going to be okay. Come with us. Liz. Death is a part of life. No idea it was all gonna end today. You don't want to waste one second of whatever time you've left, if you remember... that one day, you and I, all of us... we'll all be dead. Not here! God! Oh God! I don't understand. What? What? Hey, hey. Come on. Come on. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. What was back there? What was back there? When you're ripped from your life too quickly, You have to let go ofwhatever is keeping you here. before you can move on. This evening the Pacific Flight 7500 from Los Angeles to Tokyo alerted traffic controllers. They were encountering rough turbulence unexpectedly And soon after that, all communication with the plane ceased. We alluded to the turbulence must have loosened a critical seal and that seal gave way short time later creating a rapid decompression of air the plane. At this point in time, we believe the oxygen masks malfunctioned and in a de-pressurized environment, the lack of oxygen would be fatal. Gosh! Breathe, come on, breathe. All communication attempts from that point on have not been successful. Did you happen to see a jet, an F-16? The F-16 decided to take a closer look at the plane but no sign of life could be seen. Excuse me, excuse me, sir. Is there any chance of survival for those on board? At this point in time, we believe the chances of survival are slim. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those on board. The plane has been flying on autopilot for the last 5 hours. It's expected to run out of fuel and crash into the Pacific. We'll continue to give information as it's made available to us. Don't let me go. I won't.
