 

                        Cassie? What did I say about needing more alone time? You need it right now? Please don't argue. Well, you could give me some notice. Where's Cassie? She's upstairs. Is she coming down? Not tonight. No. Cheers. What? You know that girl? I don't think so. The Massachusetts state driver's manual? I have my road test next week. And it's making you cry? No. Sweetie, you're really freaking me out lately. I know. I'm sorry that I'm so... I'm sorry. I'm gonna take out the trash, okay? -Can I help you? -Hi. Hi. Do you know... You know who I am? No. No idea at all? Should I? Sorry. It's kinda weird. I-I'm not a crazy person. I'm... Okay. Who are you? -Can I have a hug first? -What? I'm sorry. I'm really exhausted and nervous, and I... I really... I need a hug. Thank you. Thank you. So? You're Davis Green. And I'm Alexis Green. And we're cousins. No, you have the wrong person. No. No, your dad is Ronald Green. He's a developmental psychologist. -Yeah? -Yeah. And he doesn't have any siblings. No, no. No, he does. He has an older brother, my dad. And they just never, like... You forgot the trash. Cassie, thi... Okay. I'm not who you're looking for. My dad doesn't have any siblings, and I don't have any cousins, and we have the last name, but it's pretty common, so... No, no. Please... Please leave. It was really nice to meet you, Davis. Fuck! I have to tell you something. THE AUTOMATIC HATE Thank you, thank you. Thank you. You're very kind. I'm glad the applause sign is still working. This is HD 115. Human Development. If you're looking for "Heavy Drinking 115," it's across the quad, down the block to Mulligan's. Human development. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a baby. One of the great mysteries of life. Who is she? What will she become? Will you be a painter? A head of state? A murderer? By the way you're looking at me right now, I'm guessing the last. Thank you. And is it inevitable... What she will become? Is it predetermined? Or is someone, something out there going to be transformative? Nature, nurture? That is the question. This class will bring us to a closer understanding... that the question is bullshit. The answer is far more complex, subtle... than any black or white conclusion. It is much more... gray. I want to thank Jane, my PhD student... Thank you... who gave birth specifically for the purpose of this class. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a spy among us. Sitting in the back, that bearded gentleman, is my son, Davis. What has he become? You're still dating the, ballerina? Cassie, yes. For almost two years now. It's been that long? Well, that doesn't mean that you still can't take out... one of my beautiful, brilliant PhD students... on an innocent little museum date, does it? That's exactly what it means, Dad. Cassie moved in. Right, right. See, I always thought she was one of those fun things, you know, like a placeholder. Why'd you think that? Well, she's a little bit impulsive. Emotional, out of control. Yeah. So? Your mom will be ecstatic to see you. Hi. Hi, Mom. ...that he is good at creating jobs... This can't be right. Four-letter word for a World War II city. Rouen. It's St. Lo. You have to abbreviate it. S-T-L-O. I hate when they don't tell you that they are abbreviating. You just opened up that whole corner though. And the riddle. I was thinking about cooking for all of us. Anything you want? You're gonna do your cooking thing? Okay. I ate already. But yeah, you should... go do that. Hi. How's he doing today? He's fine. Lots of napping. Could you give us a second? Yeah. Thank you. I'm sorry, Davis. Can I talk to you about something? Y... You know, your mother painted this, Ronnie. You mean Grandma painted it. Right, Grandpa? I'm not Ronnie. I'm Davis. Yeah. Is that my dad? Yep. And who's that? That's Joshua. What? Why, that's Joshua. Who's Joshua? We do not talk about Joshua. Why not? Who is he? No, no, no, no. Easy. Okay. -Okay, okay. -Ronnie! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Grandpa. Ronnie. Ronnie! -Okay, easy. It's okay. -Ronnie! No, no, no, no. -Ronnie! -Excuse me! -Can we get some help here, please? -No, no, no, no, no! Everything's gonna be okay. I want you to look at me. Right here. ...a fixed term next year. Interest groups spent more than nine million dollars... to influence the outcome of this year's statewide ballot questions, and the heavy offenders... Who is he? According to a new report from the state office... of campaign and political finances. WDUR's Shannon Mullen reports. The report shows the biggest spending... Davis, Davis, Davis, Davis! Where are you going? -To check on Grandpa. -Why? What's wrong? Is there another relative you're afraid he'll tell me about? Davis, wait a second. What did you say to him? All I did was ask him to explain the painting. Do you want to? You have a brother? No, I don't. Not anymore. What happened? I can't even begin to explain it, nor is it any of your goddamn business. There's a reason this has been kept from you. Leave it alone! You don't know what you're about to do. Trust me. Hey. You know what time they open? In about an hour. You work here? Nah, man. Just waiting for my refill. You too? Yeah. Wait, what? Check it out. What? I thought this was a thrift shop. It is, man, but they've got a dispensary inside. You know, they grow it and sell it on their farm. If you don't tell them where you got the address, I'll give it to you. I'll take that address. Hi. This is Cassie. Leave a message. Hey, Cass, it's me. I have almost no service here, so I hope you get this. I'm in a tiny town called Dustin, New York, driving to my uncle's farm. That girl who came to visit me, Alexis... She wasn't lying. She's my fucking cousin. My dad has a brother who I guess... Fuck! Today I caught a girl shoplifting. Okay. And did you call the cops? No, I let her keep it. It was so cute on her. What? You can't just give our clothes away. It was like... It would've been two dollars, She couldn't afford it. You know we're open, right? You can come in. Yeah. I'm just... I'm just lookin'. Thank you. Who was that? He was just looking at dresses. Hey, guys! Hello. Hey, Alexis. Yeah? It's Davis. Hi. What do you want? Can you talk? Sure. Hey! Hey. Why... Why did we have to meet all the way out here? 'Cause it's fun. And my parents are home. I wanted to make sure they didn't see me leave. Come on. I've got a surprise for you. -You sure my car's okay back there? -Yeah. You wanna tell me where we're goin'? Nope. A hint maybe? There's some people you need to meet. Ladies, come on out. Davis Green, this is Amanda Green and this is Annie Green. He looks a little like Dad. No, he doesn't. Not now. When he was younger. Maybe in his hairline. Getting in? What? Are you mad I didn't tell you about them before? No. This is fuckin' awesome. You like it? So, you have any brothers or sisters? That's too bad. Beer. So, do you guys have any idea what happened? You mean with our dads? Yeah. Alexis tried to bring it up once, but... -Yeah, that didn't go too well. -We got threatened. So we dropped it. Dad said that if we tried to make contact with you or your dad, then... -Then what? -Bad things. Wait. You were at the store today, weren't you? -Yeah. -Were you spying on us? No! No. Not... Not really. Alexis stalked me all over Boston. Unemployed students have time to do stuff like that. Fuck off, Amanda. So, do you have a girlfriend? Any of you have boyfriends? So, what's she do? She's a dancer at the Charles Ballet of Boston. She seems really nice. She's pretty. Wait, you met her? Kinda. So, how did you find me? Well, I... I saw your dad in one of my psych textbooks, and then, I googled him, and I saw that you went to Yale, and then I... Well, I found your restaurant online, and so... She's a stalker. Look at that. So you went to Yale? Yeah, for psychology. So what do you do now? I'm a chef. So mostly, I just disappoint my parents. Yeah, they're not too happy about that decision. Are you a sous chef? I'm a head chef. That must be a powerful position. In the kitchen. Not in life, really. God, Alexis, we're in public. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's just that I find it... It's really sad, you know? What is? That we didn't grow up together. Alexis, you haven't had that much to drink... -Yes, she has. -Maybe she should stop. I'm not drunk, okay? We apologize. She is drunk. It's okay. Shit. My gosh. Look who it is. -Who's he? -Annie used to fuck him. You used to fuck that guy? Off and on. I thought we were dating, but then... On the Fourth of July, I accidentally went down on him. Accidentally? How do you accidentally... No. Never mind. That's happened to me too. I am still pissed at you, Alexis. I really liked him. I didn't even know you guys were... And-And you are way better off anyway. It is a small town, which increases the odds of something like that occurring. -What? -What? I fucked him too. Just once, okay? You knew about this? That's a lot of coincidences. I... No, Amanda, give me your purse. -Why? -Just give her your purse. I'm gonna fix this. I'm really sorry. I'm gonna make it up to you. I love you. Where the fuck are you going? She has a knife. Come on. -Hey, Teddy. -Hey. How are you? What do you want, Alexis? You're looking so good. Fuck off. Honey, you got something... What the... -What the fuck! -Easy. Fucking whore! My... Go, go, go, fast! Go fast! Come here! What the hell was that? That was amazing is what it was! -Have you ever punched anyone before? -No! Why, did it look like I had? No! This is for you. Let's get the fuck out of here! Now, be super fucking quiet because Mom sleeps light. Wait, where are they? Don't worry. This is our space. They never come down here. Do you not wanna stay? I just don't wanna meet them yet. Well, you know, we could set you an alarm and get you out of here early. Yeah. -Good night. -Yeah. Good night. -Good night. -Good night. You can take my bed. -I'll just... -That's where you sleep? Yeah.! Where will you go? On the floor. No. No, I'll stay on... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. As you can see, it's kinda hard to bring guys back here. Because of your parents? No, they don't care. It's just a small space for three girls. Why not move out? Don't let the farm fool you. We're pretty broke. So you date a lot? No. I mean, I try. I just... I have shitty luck. I pick all the wrong ones. Like that guy in the bar? That's not shitty luck. That's shitty taste. Yeah, well, there aren't many options up here. Well, from now on, every guy you date has to be approved by me. That's sweet. Hey, Davis? I decided I like you now. I like you too. That can't be comfortable. It's not really. Mom. Th... This is... John. Well, breakfast will be ready shortly, John. Thank you, but I... We have only one rule here. If you can't bring a guy to the table, you probably shouldn't be sleeping with him. That's not a rule. Well, it should be. And we're not... Right. I'll see you upstairs. So much for your sisters waking us up early. Yeah, I bet they overslept too. How are we gonna do this? Well, my mom didn't recognize you. What about your dad? Let's just say you're my boyfriend. Dad, this is Jonathan. We're dating. Hi, Jonathan. What happened to the last guy? Dad shot him. You're not a vegetarian, are you? -No. -Good. Keep cutting. So, Jonathan, how did you two meet? He was my TA. Yeah? For what class? Developmental Psych. You want some eggs? Sure. I'm sorry. We're out of bacon. Amanda, go kill another pig after breakfast. -I can't do it today. Make Alexis do it. -Gross. I have to work two jobs and now this? Yeah, that's fair. I'm not doing it. Annie, you do it. -I have to open the store. -Fine. Jonathan and I will do it. I'm sorry? I'm stuck out here in the woods with four women. First time a guy's been around in a while. I don't know how much help I would be. Well, you're fucking my daughter. The least you can do is keep me some company while I kill a pig. Joshua. Dad! Are the pigs back there? No. Pigs stink like shit. We don't keep them near the house. Get in. Just so you know, sir, I would never even think about sleeping with your daughter. Now, that sounds like an insult. No. I mean, I would. I'm just not. What does that do? Kills the pig on contact. This way you don't have to bleed it. Very little suffering. Very humane. What now? We just go in there and zap one? I'll tell you what now. Stop fucking with me! Yes, sir. He send you here to spy on me? Who? Don't insult my intelligence, man. I know you're my brother's son. Actually, your daughters said I look a bit like you... when you were younger. I don't see it. So did you go to college? Yeah. Why do you ask? Just curious... if maybe you'd also studied psychology. I studied philosophy. Did you go to Yale too? No way. Fuck that place. I went to Harvard. Sorry I didn't get to see you grow up. It's all right. So, what now? Nothing. Have a good life. That's it? You don't want to see him? Nope. -Why not? -Plenty of reasons. Give me one. Because he doesn't want to see me. You guys are brothers. What could have possibly happened? Why the fuck do you think I'd tell you that? What we have between us, it's unresolvable. If I knew what happened, would I hate you? It was nice to meet you, Davis. Wh... Where are you going? I need you to drive me back to my car. Why? He knew who I was, Alexis, as soon as he saw me. Okay. So here's what we'll do. We'II... No, I need you to drive me back to my car. No. Then I'll walk. You're just... What? Davis. Davis. Davis, wait, please. Your dad asked me to leave. So what? I have to do this all by myself? Do what? Find a way to get our families back together. That's what you want to do? Unless I'm imagining things, it seems like you were enjoying your break up here. Wait. What? From your girlfriend. Break? I... I-I didn't mean it like that. I just mean you were having a good time, and I picked up on a vibe that you guys are having problems. Sorry to pry. She had an abortion, Alexis. My gosh. Yeah, so that brought up a lot of shit between us. Davis, I'm so sorry. Yeah, thanks. So, what if I stayed? What's your plan? I don't know, but if you do, I know that we'll figure something out. And now we've stirred it all up, it's dumb to just drop it. I can't believe I'm just meeting you now. I'll come back to visit. Okay? I promise. Promise me something else. What? That if you do leave now, it's not because you're afraid of what's going on. I'm not afraid of what's going on. Not with our dads. With us. No? Okay. Come on. I'll take you to your car. Alexis? I do know what's going on, but I promise that's not why I'm leaving. No? -What the fuck are you doing? -I need to show you something before you leave. How long is this gonna take? Just a few minutes. What is this place? Well, when we were little, my parents got in a fight and I followed my dad here. He doesn't know I know about it. There's so much stuff. I know. Here. Look at this. What's up here? I have no idea. What? Come up here. It's plugged in. Should we? Jesus. What? I think that's my dad. The one on the right. He's handsome. -Is the other one your dad? -Yeah. They look so happy. Is that your mom, maybe? No. Yours? No. She's so pretty. No, wait. There's more. Could this all be over a girl? Maybe. You coming down? Yeah, one second. Look what I found! Look, it's the one the girl was wearing in the film. Put it back. Carefully. Let's just leave everything exactly as it was. Your dad seemed really into that girl. Yeah, they both did. She was pretty. Thank you for bringing me here. We should go. Holy shit. What? Stop the car. Stop the car! What the fuck? What are you doing here? Davis. Thank God. I came to look for you. Hi. I don't know what happened. I just can't get the car to start. I tried calling AAA, but I can't get anybody on the phone. There's no reception or something. -What? -Is that her? Davis, a tow's gonna take forever. We've got jumper cables at the house. Hi... again. Maybe I left the lights on overnight. You know, it's Kristin's car and I don't know what all the buttons do. Well, we could jump it. You think she can help? Yep. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. You sure? Yeah. So, how did you find me? I drove into the main part of town. I just asked around. So, Cassie, what brings you all the way up here? I'm here to talk to Davis about something. You mind giving us just a second? I called a lot. You not picking up? Yeah. I've got bad, cell service. Davis. Your parents actually asked me to find you. But you didn't tell them I was here, did you? Yeah, I did. -Cassie! -I'm sorry. It was important to them. Sweetie, I wanted to wait until we were alone... Babe, your grandfather passed away. I'm so sorry. The last time I saw him... I asked about your dad, and he... freaked out... and had, like, a panic attack or something. This is my fault. No. No, no, no, sweetie. Sweetie, he was old. What was he like? He was charming. Smart. But he was stubborn, like my dad. Like your dad... I guess. Davis, I need to talk to you outside. You didn't even know him. I know. That's what makes this so fucking sad. I know you have to go now, but please promise me this isn't the last time I see you. Of course. Now, maybe this could... This could work. We're going to the funeral. No. Absolutely not. What? If they wanted me there, I'd have gotten a call. Yeah, but he's your dad too. I am not going to his house. You wouldn't have to go to Ronald's, if that makes a difference. They're burying him at the family cabin in the mountains tonight. Just a quiet little thing with Ronald and Marsha. You owe us this because you never let us meet our grandfather. I mean, the least you can do is let us say good-bye. She's right. They're running late. The body won't be here until the morning. It's a good thing he's dead. It'd kill him to know he was late to something. There's a motel at the base of the mountain... by the gas station. I think we'll stay the night here, if that's okay with you. Plenty of room, right? Good. So we'll stay. And I'll help with the body in the morning. Suit yourself. You can stay in the basement. Yeah, I'm hungry too. Why don't you get those little crackers from the car? Dad! He's making everyone dinner. Well, if it's good, maybe it's worth waiting for, come join us. We're drinking your wine, so... Can you cut those up smaller? Yeah, sure. Quickly, sweetie. Fine. I'm not as good at this as you are. Fine. I'll do it. I can do it. Hey, are you doin' okay? I'm sorry for how I behaved last week. But I think that these last few days... have been really good for me. How about you? Hey, anyone want some wine? Maybe after I'm done. It'll make it all go smoother. And I'll come back and help you cut stuff as well. Thanks. Can I have some too? Yeah, sure. This is a cool house. I'm glad you like it. Dinner's almost ready. Good. Want to sit down? If not, we can make you a to-go plate. Ronnie, I'm kidding, please. We should be able to handle this. Do you want some wine? Don't bother. He doesn't like wine. I'll get him his drink. Do you need help with something? Just some Red Label. -He's down there? -Yeah. How'd you pull that off? It's easy to despise someone from a distance. Put them across a table, though, most men won't pursue a conflict if they can help it. Your dad's a great example. Of what? A coward. That's your drink, right? Good memory. So, who's gonna lose it tonight? You are. No, not me. What are you guys talking about? May I? Ronnie and I spent every summer here growing up. One summer, we were alone, so every weekend was 48 hours straight of drinking. Every few weekends we'd wake up to see... that someone had vomited somewhere. I'd accuse Ronnie of not being able to hold his liquor. He'd accuse me. But neither of us could remember. Ronnie, being the prankster he was, suggested an experiment. We ate pasta for dinner. I had marinara, he had Alfredo. Josh, if you're gonna tell it, tell it right. I had marinara and you had Alfredo. We threw the biggest party of the summer. And we probably drank a little bit more than we should've. So in the morning, the vomit... was either red or white. And then we'd know whose it was. So... what color was it? It was pink. What's so funny? Why did you tell that story? I still think it was you. Did I hear them laughing down there? Yeah, look what we've done. Well, it's still early. So, we should get them all drunk. How much have you had? Just a little bit. Babe, the table is set. Family meeting. Do not disturb. What? Sorry. What I meant to say is,... Go away. Alexis, you may never speak like that... to my girlfriend. -What did I... -Do you understand? Why are you being so mean? Because you're acting like a little fucking girl. You treat me so differently around her. Look, I know that what happened... was really, really fucked up, okay? No, it wasn't. Yes! Yes, it was. And we'll deal with it, okay? I promise. We will, later. But the way that you're acting now, you're making me regret all this. Coming here and meeting you... everything. Look... Jesus fucking Christ, Alexis! What are you gonna do? Tell on me? It's all so fun because they're right there. We're done, you understand me? You'll never see me again after tomorrow. Let's eat. It's good. Alexis, where did you get that? You know where I got it. May I see that, please? Sweetie, take that off and hand it to me now. Now! What else have ya got, Josh? I didn't think you'd want any of her stuff. At the end, you wanted nothing to do with Rebecca. Don't you dare mention her name. And you shouldn't assume anything. Let's see if I'm in the will, then maybe we can negotiate. That's the reason why you're here. Well, what if it is? What are you gonna do, disown me again? -I know it's your hobby. -Give that to me. -Give it to me! -Ronnie, no. -Alexis, come over here. -Give it to me. -Give that to me! -Alexis, give it to me. Let's bring it upstairs, then we can all figure out what we want to do with it. -Please... -Shut up, Cassie! This is not your family. You need to fucking leave! Why? So you can have your cousin all to yourself? What was that? I saw you two upstairs. There's obviously something going on. What? Th-That's not true! Cassie, that's not true. What is going on here, Josh? I don't know. Don't look at me. All of you. You, you! Stay away from my son! There's something wrong with you, Josh. You're sick. And you passed it along to your kids. Don't you dare! You fucking pervert! You took advantage of her, Josh. You took advantage of her. You killed Rebecca and you know goddamn well that you did! Stop it! No! Stop! Stop it! Get off, get off him! Davis! Davis! Davis! Davis! Stop it! Mind your business, you jealous cunt! Why the fuck should I be jealous of you? Because Davis hasn't been able to keep his eyes off me since he got here. And I think he's happy you had that abortion... so that he doesn't have to be stuck with you. And in case you haven't realized, your boyfriend and I... Alexis. You know, my dad hired people who are coming to take care of that. Couldn't sleep. Thought I'd help us get out of here faster. You seen Cassie? She took off, man. Real early. I asked if she'd be back. She said "no." How's your face? We should see your dad before we declare a winner. So are you a murderer, Josh? If I am, then your dad is too. What did you do? I need some help. Come here. You know, you and I are more alike than you might think. How's that? Well, your dad's a man of careful words and thoughts. But when I saw you punch Alexis, it clicked. I don't follow. If you'd thought about it, you would've never done it. But you did. There are lots of things that are out of our control, Davis. Almost everything is, actually. So you stole his girl? This... Rebecca. And he never forgave you. Rebecca was our sister. Your dad found out about us and he told the entire family. They shunned us and it ruined her life. He shamed her into killing herself. Come on, Davis. From what we heard last night, are you in any place to judge? I know how you feel about her. Your dad will never forgive you for it. But I will. Davis, I was thinking. Maybe I could take your car back and you could ride with... We don't have to ever talk about this again. We can talk about it. That girl, your cousin, she's just like my brother. How's that? Dangerous. Your behavior, your feelings for her, it's curiosity, it's... it's... From not having known her. It's not... Dad... You know. Please. I'm sorry. For what? For everything. I guess I thought that... getting our families together would've been a good thing. And what do you think now? I think they're assholes. -Hi, this is Cassie. -Leave a message. Hey, Cass, it's me. I'm back in town, staying at Todd's, so you know where to find me whenever you want to talk. Okay. Bye. Hey, chef, there's a girl out back who's here to see you. What? I don't know. She says it's important. She needs to talk to you. Hi. I-I drove past your apartment a few times. I saw you weren't there. I'm not living there at the moment. Did you guys break up? Do you wanna take a walk? Can you say something, please? You're making me really self-conscious. Come on. Let's get you home. Come on. Can I come visit you sometime? You just did. Davis, I could tell her what happened between us. What we did. I love you. More than just family. I... I love you. What do we do about this? Nothing. Are you sure you want me to do this? And if I do, that's it? Game on? You promise? Even if you don't like some of what you hear? I told you... It's not about whether I like the answers. It's that I get to know them. I get to know everything... from now on. Are you pussying out? No. Okay. We'll start easy. Are you sexually attracted to her? One lie, this game is done. Are you sexually attracted to your cousin? Yes. Have you thought about what it would be like... to sleep with her? A lot? Okay. That one stung a bit. Is it more than physical attraction? Maybe? I guess so, yeah. Do you think you'd make a good couple? No. Given the chance, if there were no consequences, would you do anything with her? At one point... I guess so, yeah. But now, no. No way. -Are you sure you want to be with me? -Yes. -You have no doubts? -No. Okay. Last question. Did you actually... do anything at all with her? No. No. Nothing. Okay. Unpack your shit.
