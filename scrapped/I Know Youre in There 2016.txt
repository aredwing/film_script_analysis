 

                        1 - What are you doing? Come on, I'm not even dressed yet. - I know, that's the best part. - Stop it. I'm serious. - Hey, you're the one who bought it for me. Just trying to put it to good use. - I bought you the camera so that you could make your film, not so you could creep on me. - Oh, baby, but you look so good on camera. - Stop fooling around. I gotta get ready for work. - What? I'm not doing anything. - Tom, stop. - Hey, I got an idea. How 'bout you call in sick today? - Nope. - Why? Why don't you hop back in bed, I'll rent us a movie. We can cuddle, maybe fool around a little bit. Then I'll take you out to lunch. What's the name of that place you like with mimosas? - Tom you promised. - Not for me, I'll drink iced tea. Just because I'm not drinking doesn't mean you can't right? - One of us needs to go to work today. I need to get the phone. - Yeah, she's got a point there. - What'd you say? - Nothing, just talking to the camera. - Hello? Sure, may I ask who's calling? Okay. It's for you. Here, let me take this. - Hello. Yeah this is tom Redding. Mmm hmm. What? Hang on a second. Okay go ahead. Mmm hmm. Okay, I understand. Yes that's fine, thank you. - What was that about? - My mother killed herself. - You're a hard person to get in touch with tom. Oh please have a seat. I'm Dr. Jorgensen. - Well nice to meet ya, thanks for tracking me down. - How was the drive? - It's fine, thank you. - I'm sorry about your mother. This must be hard for you. - Not really. I don't even remember her. She left whenever I was little. But you could have told me that over the phone, is that it? - No. - What are those? - The keys to your mother's house. She left it to you. - Just like that huh? - Just like that. But there is something else. - Okay, what is it? - You have a sister tom. Her name is Chloe. She should have been institutionalized years ago but your mother wouldn't allow it. - So she's crazy? - We don't say crazy. The technical diagnosis is catatonic schizophrenia. Chloe doesn't speak, move, or respond to any external stimuli. - Why? - No one knows for sure. Mental illness is often hereditary. It usually manifests itself later in life after physical or mental trauma. But Chloe's case is completely unique. Would you like to see her now? Hello Chloe, how are you today? I have a surprise for you. This is your brother tom. You can talk to her. It's okay to feel uncomfortable. Chloe's used to that, aren't you Chloe? You can see why I tried to convince your mother to admit her. - Mmm hmm. Well... It's nice to meet you. What if I wanted to spend some time with her? - You're more than welcome to visit whenever you like. - No, I'm not just talking about a couple of hours here. I want to get to know her. - This is all there is tom. - I don't know, I've got a house now right? Maybe I could take her there for a little while. - You're not qualified. - Qualified? She doesn't move, how hard can it be? - I don't think you understand the toll it could take on you. To care for someone in Chloe's condition. Someone that isn't trained for it? Trying to do it all himself? Well, it could be maddening. Your mother tried to do it and... - doc I'm not my mother. And... Not to be disrespectful but I don't think she belongs in a place like this. Now, my mom did it for years right? I'm sure I could handle a couple of months. - I really don't think it's a good idea... - Dr. Jorgensen I'm asking you, please. She's all the family I got. - On one condition. - Anything, what? - If there are any issues, if you see any changes, you've gotta call me right away. - Doc, I'll probably call you twice a day. - And you got the sound gear all ready right? - Yeah. There ya go. You sure you don't mind me taking your car? - Of course not. I don't want you breaking down when you have a crazy in the car. - She's not crazy. - I was just kidding. I just meant... - yeah. - Are you sure about this? - It's perfect. - It's perfect? - Hey. How long have I been stuck trying to figure out an idea for my thesis huh? Could you possibly think of anything better than this? - I guess not. - You'll be up with me in a couple of weeks anyway. Besides, you'll be glad to have me out of your hair while you're grading term papers. - She's a little creepy though right? - Yeah, I guess a little. - Call me when you get up there? - Uh huh. Okay. All right, cut it out. Okay, so this is day one of my trip with Chloe. The sister that I never knew I had. Say hi Chloe. And day one of this documentary shoot. It feels weird to be a character in my own film, but since Chloe doesn't talk, it seems pretty important that I am. Excited to get to the house. I wanna know what happened there. Why my mother did what she did. Just can't imagine wanting to kill yourself in such a beautiful place. Now if you look ahead, you can see mount Shasta. Apparently, some local Indians believed the mount was inhabited by gods and demons. And when the mountain shadow descends upon the valley below, the gods sleep while the demons fasten to this dimension. From the spiritual to the physical. And walk freely in the darkness among men. Woo! Pretty spooky, what do you think Chloe? I'll take that as a yes. I don't know why I'm recording this. Well, this is the last town on the map before I get to my mother's house. Which is another hour over the mountain still. And population zero. There's literally no one here, nothing. Got abandoned railroad cars. Houses over there that look like they haven't been lived in for years. Let's go take a look. Oh wow. One, two, and three. There we go. Okay. Guess you and mom liked the quiet. Oh my god it's perfect! It's a mess but it's perfect. Fireplace, that's good. It's getting cold already. Where's your room Chloe? What's this thing here for? Creepy. So this is your room huh? Not bad. Well, guess it's almost time for bed. - Is this the house phone? - Mmm hmm, I got it working. Cell service is shit so if you need anything just call me here. How's Chloe doing? - She's good. Just put her to bed. I'm gonna hit the hay soon too. I miss you babe, I'll talk to you soon. - Okay love you. - You too. - Bye. - Smile for the camera. - So, I'm unpacked and I'm all settled in the house. And I'm already encountering some things that I don't understand. I found a heavy duty lock and a chain on the outside of Chloe's bedroom door. I think my mother put it there which is disturbing. There's also all this religious charms and crystals like this guy. All over the house, I don't know. Did you see that? I looked over some of the footage from the drive over here and it was glitchy too just like that, I don't know. Maybe it's a software thing? I'll figure it out. As you can see, I made a little confessional room. I'm gonna come in here and just record my thoughts while I'm on the trip. I'll check in every once in a while, but that's all for now. You really eat this stuff huh? Wouldn't you rather have some bacon and eggs or something? French toast? You like French toast? Hmm? Okay. Dammit! Let's figure this out. Feeding. Feeding, feeding, feeding. Head back. Medium bite. Okay. There we go. Huh. One down, 29 to go. So, my sister has a very extensive physical therapy regimen outlined here. Part of the day. Gotta be a lot more careful from now on with Chloe, I promise. Right now, I gotta go out and clear my head and go get some roll of the rock or some sunset shots. I'll be back in time to make dinner okay? You'll be all right. Hello mom. Wow, you must have really lost it to jump from up there. No, no, no, none of this was here before. Hello. Hello! Shit. I think it's this way. I think it's this way. There is no one like. God dammit! Chloe! Chloe! Oh thank god. I'm sorry, I got lost. You okay? That's great. That's just great. I was not expecting to be so bored all the time. And turns out, Chloe's not much for conversation. At least I've got you, right? Just wish we could go out for a drink or something. Sounds good. Wait a second. What's this? Almost forgot that I packed this. It's not a single malt, but I think it's gonna get the job done. Down the hatch. Ahh, it's good stuff. The air is dry up here. And, now my nose is bleeding. That's fantastic. Did you just say something? Right. Goodnight sis. Sorry if I'm not very good at this yet. - Hi tom, this is Dr. Jorgensen. I'm just calling to check in with you. Please call me back when you get a chance. - My sister is in this all fucking day. I don't know what there is to complain about, seems pretty fun to me. Woo! Been too long old friend. I'm Chloe, I need a wheelchair. Woo! It's so quiet here. Day 10, morning feeding. Almost forgot your meds. What are you trying to do? Did you move that? Day 10 morning feeding. I almost forgot your meds. Chloe how'd you do that? Can you hear me? Chloe can you hear me? Okay fine. You don't wanna talk? I can wait. Stop playing games with me! You understand?! Are you hungry? You wanna eat?! Yeah? Well pick up the spoon. Pick up the fucking spoon! Sorry. Let me just delete that footage. I'm trying here Chloe. And I hope you understand that. This is a little harder than I thought it was gonna be. I don't know, maybe I made a mistake. Maybe I should call Dr. Jorgensen. What do you think? I'll make you some more porridge. Okay? Garbage. That's garbage. What a fucking hack. What is that? Did you hear that? There's something out there. Hello. Is somebody out there? Who's there? I can hear you! Jesus. What is that? What the hell is this? Who's there? Chloe. Chloe. Chloe! - No! Something happened last night. Something, I don't know. As you can see I've hit my head. But I also found this. I haven't had a chance to go through it yet but it's a diary. It's my mother's diary. Chloe. Do you know anything about this? I know you do. I know you're in there. Let's see what's in it. December 14th. Something's happening with Chloe. She's different. I tried to tell Dr. Jorgensen. She asked me if I'd been taking my medication. She thinks I'm going crazy again but I'm not. I leave her alone for a moment when I... When I come back things are different, out of place. You're faking this aren't you? December 24th, Christmas Eve. Chloe pushed me. I can't prove it, but she pushed me down the stairs. I came back upstairs and she was sitting in her wheelchair like nothing happened but I know she pushed me. Does that sound familiar? Hmm? Did you push me? I know you can hear me, talk. Answer me god dammit! You see that? That's a camera. You're gonna screw up one of these days and I'm gonna catch everything on tape! - Hey babe. I tried to call last night but you didn't answer. I just wanted to let you know that I'm all packed up and I'll see you tomorrow. - You better not pull any shit when Jamie's here. - This place is amazing! - It's great isn't it? - Yeah. Did you hurt yourself? - I fell down the stairs. Come on, I'll show you the house. Hey. - What was that for? - Just glad to see ya. I know it's a little cold. It'll be better once I get the fire going. - It's definitely a fixer upper. - It's perfect. - I was worried when I didn't hear from you. What have you been doing? - Do you want a drink? I think we should celebrate. Let's have a drink. - Okay. - I'm pretty sure I saw a bottle of Merlot around here somewhere. - Yeah, I guess. One glass won't hurt anybody. Hey Chloe. - Ah, here it is. Jamie. - Are you sure she's okay in there? - Chloe? Yeah she's fine. - So tell me what's been going on. - Not a lot to tell. - Have you at least been getting some good footage? - Mmm hmm. Need a refill? - No I'm good. - Suit yourself. What? You hungry? - I guess. - Good. To us. - I mean, you should see some of the crap that I have to read. It's like... I'm just tired of doing the bitch work. I can't wait until I have my own ta. - Soon enough. Or you could just quit. - Yeah right. And do what? - Move out here. - So, this is the master bedroom. - No, it's downstairs. But it's the only one down there so... - so Chloe gets it? - Uh huh. - I guess I'll just have to make this work. I missed you. - How did you get up here? I'm not playing games with you. Why would you do that to me? Hmm? I have enough stress right now. And your bullshit. - Tom. Tom? Tom, where are you? - Hey. - What are you doing? - I was just checking on Chloe. I know it sounds weird but, I worry about her sometimes. - Well now I get it. Come back to bed though okay? - Jamie is driving me nuts. It was so much better when it was just me and Chloe. I thought it would be nice to have someone else to talk to, but she doesn't understand. She doesn't understand what's going on here. She doesn't understand what's happening with Chloe. She doesn't understand what I'm trying to do. I don't know what to do about her. - Tom? - Why you doing that? - I figured I'd feed Chloe this morning since you couldn't seem to get out of bed. - Oh, well filming's really been stressing me out lately. - Filming. What exactly have you been filming? I mean really. - Did you put her medicine in there? - No. I don't see anything about medicine. - It's printed right there. If you don't mix it in with her food she's gonna reject it. - Sorry. I'll put the medicine in. Where is it? - It's a separate routine for a reason you know? - Are you serious right now? - Just forget about it, you already fed her too much. - Clearly I've done something wrong here. I'm gonna go for a run. Unless you need my help filming. - I don't need anyone's help. - This is Dr. Jorgensen again. Tom, I really need you to let me know how things are going. I'd appreciate if you'd call me back right away. Thanks. - Hello. Hello, Dr. Jorgensen? Tom! Tom that was Dr. Jorgensen. Do you want me to call her back? Tom? What is going on here? Let's get some light in here huh? You really are very pretty Chloe. Wait here. That's pretty. You have really pretty eyes Chloe. I'm worried about tom. He's not usually like this. I know he's stressed with the filming and everything but, I don't know. You scared the shit out of me. - Take that stuff off of her face. - We're just having a little fun. - Does it look like she's having fun to you? What? - Your nose. - It's the altitude, don't worry about it. - Here. - No, I've got it. - Do not use your shirt. - Take that shit off of her face. She looks like a fucking clown. - What the fuck are you looking at? Did you just say something? Chloe. Are you trying to talk? Are you serious?! - Hello. - Hey, Dr. Jorgensen. - Speaking. - This is Jamie, tom Redding's girlfriend. - I'm so glad you called. Are you with tom? - No, he can't come to the phone right now. - Is everything okay? - Tom's acting strange. - Tell me what's happening. - He's been aggressive. He's not his usual self. - How's Chloe? - I don't know. Is it possible she might be faking it? - No, that's highly improbable. - I know, it's just. Something's wrong. Something is really wrong. - You need to get him to bring Chloe back here. - Okay, I'll try to talk to him. - Yes, do that. - Thank you, bye. Tom. Tom, come inside. We need to talk. I guess this is the only way I can talk to you now. I'm leaving tom. I love you, I really do. I hope you find whatever it is you're looking for. Whatever you're doing up here. But I just can't. Where are my car keys? - Hmm? - Give me my car keys. - The mountain pass might be snowed over. It's too dangerous. - I don't care. Give me my keys. - No. - Fine, I'll take your car. Come on. Give me my car keys! Tom, this isn't funny I need to go! I just wanna go home! - Stay, you're not supposed to leave yet. - Give them to me! I'm calling Dr. Jorgensen. You're not fit to be taking care of Chloe. - No! You don't understand. I'm making really good progress with her. - You're fucking insane! - Jamie! Come on! Hang up the phone. - No. - Hello. - Hi, can I please speak to Dr. Jorgensen? No, don't! - I asked you nicely. Didn't I? Where you going? Jamie! Jamie. Jamie. Open the door. Open the god damn door! Day 20. I don't know. What day is it Chloe? I don't understand. I know you're in there. Please talk to me. She thinks I'm crazy. Am I crazy Chloe? I'm done. I'm fucking done with this. If you wanna pretend nothing's going on here that's fine, I'll take you back to that home. I'll let you rot there. - Don't leave me. - What did you just say? - You wouldn't take me back there would you? - No, no I won't take you back there. - Promise? - Yeah I promise. I knew you were in there. - I've always been here. - I know. I love you sis. - What about her? - Who? - The other girl. - What about her? - She doesn't love me. - What are you trying to say? - She doesn't love me! Get rid of her. - No. No I can't do that. - Then I will. - Wake up. Please wake up tom. Oh thank god. Are you all right? - I think so. - What happened? - I don't know, I must have passed out, hit my head or something. - But you think you're okay? - Yeah I'm fine I think. - Let's just get out of here. This place is evil. - No. - Tom, something is... - get away! - You're out of your fucking mind! - You have to leave now, Chloe doesn't want you here. - Chloe doesn't want me here?! You need help tom. - It's not funny. - I was just playing a game. - Well you win, she's leaving. - You can't let her leave. She's gonna tell on us. - I don't care. You're not gonna touch her. - You can't stop me. - Yeah. Stop! Stop it! Don't move. You're staying in here tonight. - I hate you! - Sorry about everything. Maybe when I get back home we can work things out. - Mmm hmm. - I just need to finish my work. Come on! Please, please. Please. - Thank you. - Where you taking that? - You're taking it. - Where? - Up there. Grab a lot. - Chloe. - Hurry up! - Hello. - Hi Jamie, this is Dr. Jorgensen. Did you speak with tom? - It doesn't matter, listen. I'm out in the middle of nowhere. I crashed my car and I haven't been able to get a signal. And it's too cold for me to stay out here so I'm running back to the house. - Hello, Jamie? - Hello Dr. Jorgensen can you hear me? - I can barely hear you. - Okay listen, I'm headed back to the house. I need you to call someone so... Please, come on. Don't, no. - There's something wrong with Chloe. I can't take it anymore. I don't know what to do. She was going to abandon me. Just like she did to you. Just like that other girl too. Throw it in the fire Tommy. Burn it. - I don't understand. I know you're in there. She thinks I'm crazy. Am I? Chloe am I crazy? I'm done. I am fucking done with this. If you wanna pretend like nothing's going on here that's fine I'll take you back to that home and you can rot there. - Don't leave me. - What did you say? - You wouldn't take me back there would you? - No I won't take you back there. - Promise? - Yeah I promise. Promise, I knew you were in there. - I've always been here. - I know. I know, I love you sis. - What about her? - Who? - The other girl. - What about her? - She doesn't love me. - What do you mean? - She doesn't love me. - What do ya think? - Get rid of her. - You stay away from me. - No I can't do that. It's just a little rough footage but, I think it's gonna cut together really nicely. - Stay back. - Then I will. - Let me show you some more. Where ya going? - Leave me alone! Stay away. Stay away from me! - What are you gonna do with that? Huh? Don't you get it? It's just a movie. - I don't wanna use this but I will if I have to. - No I don't think so. - You're crazy. - All the great ones are. - No, get back in the car. - What? - Start the engine. - Let me help you. - No, you don't understand he's crazy. - Who's crazy? - Tom. - Well hello doc. You've walked in on a little misunderstanding. - Go and wait in the car. - No, you don't understand... - Jamie, I can take care of it. - Glad you came doc. Chloe and I have so much to tell you. - Where is Chloe? - Oh, she's around here somewhere. - Would you mind turning off the flashlight? - Not at all. - No, stay back! No. No, no. - Jamie. Jamie come back. You don't need to hide. Tell you what. I'm gonna count to three. If you don't come out, I'm gonna cut your fucking head off. One, two... Where the fuck are you!? Where the fuck are you?! I hear you! Jamie. I just wanna finish my movie. I think I finally figured out the ending. - Tom. Tom, stop get off! Stop! Oh my god! - Come on baby. Come on, give it to me. You stupid bitch hit me. - I will. - Hit me! - I will! I think that's recording. Where do I start? It's been three months since tom. What I'm trying to do here... I thought it might help me move on if I finished tom's documentary. I know it sounds a little crazy but, I feel like I owe it to him. I don't expect anyone else to understand, but, I'm just gonna be piecing it together to try to make some sense out of what happened. But first things first. Chloe lives with me now. I applied to be her temporary guardian. Chloe and I are going to be teaching each other a thing or two. Isn't that right Chloe? That's really all I have at the moment, but I just wanted to get started so, bye for now. Maybe I'll just leave it going for a little while.
