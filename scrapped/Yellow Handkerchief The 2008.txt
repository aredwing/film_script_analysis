 

                        Hey, Brett. All right. Close seven. Take it easy out there, Brett. Bye, Brett. Be true to yourself. Brett, you take care, man. You take care, Brett. Take it easy, bro. Do what I told you. Don't you come back now. I don't want to see you back here again. - Bye, Brett. - Bye, Brett. - Oh! - Hey! You waiting in line? Yeah. What kind of feather is that? In your ear. - It's a feather. - It's a cockatoo feather. I'm Native American lndian, so-- Oh. Can I get you something? Yeah. Beer, please. Coors? Heineken? Anything. Um... Light. Will do. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. Where would that bus take me? It just goes the next few stops before it turns around at Hamilton. - That's south? - Uh-huh. You gotta get across the river if you want to get much further south. You could take local buses all the way down if you got the time. - Thanks. - Sure. You always this talkative? Do you have any of these throwaway cameras, but with expired film in them? You know, maybe in the back or something? I don't give anything away. No, I want them that way. I prefer them that way. This what you're talking about? - Can I have some fries? Sure. Fries! Do you know where I go to get the ferry? The river, I guess. You never taken it? I never tried. Oh, so you never wanted to get to the other side. I'm sorry, I thought it was funny, but I guess it's because I'm Native American, so I like to see everything I can, you know, of the land. - Do I know you? - No. What? I can't talk to anyone around here? I'm not going to hurt you or anything. Sure, that's what ax murderers say. Thanks for the directions. No problem, baby. You have a safe trip. I made a mistake last night, with you. I was drunk. - Okay? - So we're not going tonight? Well, hey. Hey, you want to go with me? - All right. - Come on. I could wait and take you back. Oh, no, no. No, no, this was very helpful. Thank you. Cool. Look at it this way, it can always get worse. Yeah, well, I really don't think so. Give it time. You'll be all right. Good luck. What are you doing? Well, I'm just messing with the camera. It could be really cool, you never know. Hey, do something. - Something? - Anything. Just... Now that's great. Wait. Will you do something else freaky, or... - Would you come here? Just help me? When I get my balance, you can step out of the picture. Okay. You're--You're a circus animal. Well, here, get this one. Are you going across? Yeah. Well, you could ride with us. I mean, it's cheaper in one car. If you take me right back. We have ourselves a dreamer, ladies and gentlemen. I want to go. I just don't want to go with him, alone. That's gonna hit us. No, It's cool, man. It's frickin' Tom Sawyer. Whoa. Pull it down. I'm Brett, by the way. Oh, I'm Gordon. Everybody calls me Gordy. Uh, Martine. You from here, Gordy? No, I'm from out west. Are you from here? Just passing through. I'm from boring ol' here my whole life. Well, I'm following the river. I thought it'd be cool, you know, down to New Orleans. Yeah, but these levee things, they get in the way, though. She's there though, believe you me. I was expecting to see more damage. That was more down New Orleans way. I'll collect from you on the way out. We won't be coming back today. - This is fixing to hurt. - All right. Get off of me! Gordy, in the trunk, do you have anything--cover of any kind? I have a tent. It's a plastic one-man thing. Can I borrow that? All right. Thanks. - What's he doing? - He's claustrophobic. Well, doesn't he even think about ruining my tent? Isn't that what it's for? I've never seen rain like this. Whoa! Oh, my God! Pull into the motel. One room left only. One bed. Fifty dollars in advance, cash. No credit card. I got it. I should get rid of some of this cash anyway. Shouldn't be carrying so much around. So how much? Fifty? Fifty. - You have twenty... - There's fifty. Okay. Room 5. And where is that? You can go this way. Is there a mailbox near here, ma'am? Now, that's the sort of thing an ax murderer does. He mails a ransom note in the pouring rain. I like him. So why are we seeing tornados? Well-- If you two don't mind, when you're through in the bathroom, I'd like to sleep in there. You're gonna sleep? I was thinking about it, yeah. Well, I'm done in there. I couldn't smell sweeter if I tried. Here at my crib. Tony Freckles. Come check it out. - Look at my chandelier. - How pathetic is he? "Look at my chandelier. Look at my Jacuzzi." Right? Well, don't drown in it, Mr. Brain Damage. Mr. Missing Chromosome. Have you watched this show? I like it. No, you don't. You don't. You think you do, but you do not like this show. In charge of managing the cocoa butter. Come on. You see this thing? This is Jazz, my nutritionist-slash-stylist. Hi, Dad. Nothing much. Just staying out of the storm. No, with friends. You don't know them. There's an adult with us. Everything's fine. Yeah, that was exactly what I was going to do today, Dad. I was gonna try and waste as much time as I can. Why do you have to make a run to Denver? Fine. Yeah. Yeah, okay, fine. I'll see you Thursday. Dad? That is an excellent idea. You see where I live? You see what I drive? Now you're about to see me in a shiny purple bathing suit. Cuckoo! You all right? Yeah. Well, if that's it, I'm gonna say good night. If anybody needs to get in here, just knock. He's weird. I think if it gets any better in the next couple hours, we should just leave. I mean, even if it's in the middle of the night. A few fixes, it'll be good to go, maybe worth a couple grand. Look at this. You go out in this? That one needs some work for sure. There's a good one down here. It's freezing cold down there. Night. You know, it's hard sleeping in the same room with you. Huh? Well, you're so pretty when you do certain stuff. Kinda makes me horny. I'm getting obsessed. I think it would go--it would go away if you just kissed me once, you know, because it wouldn't be like this obsession thing. What do you say? So it's like an obsession thing? You touch me and it goes away? Kind of, yeah. Why is that? The mystery's gone, and... - Get off! - Okay, I'm sorry! - Get off me! - Shh! I'm sorry! I'm not gonna shut up, okay! What is going on in here? All right, you, in there. No. No. I'm not gonna be ordered around by some old guy I don't even-- Now. She was crying about nothing. How would you know? Oh. Easy. You can do this! All right. Come on. Okay, okay. - Okay. - Do it tight there now. Hey. Hi. I just--I wanted to... I wanted to say that I'm sorry at what-- It's okay? Okay, come, come now. Oh, my God! - Come. Come. - Step back there. Gordy, thanks for getting me this far, but I think I'm gonna take my time and then get on a bus. Oh, me, too. I should, too. Thanks a lot for the ride. I don't think I have enough to get me home. I can cover you, if they're running at all this morning. Might take them a while. - Thank you. - Yeah. Where do you work? I used to work on the oil rigs, in the ocean down south. You want a cookie? Like down south, like, near New Orleans? Couple hours from there. I've always wanted to go to New Orleans. You been married? Have you been? Are you interviewing for the job? 'Cause you're a little young. - You wanna walk? - Yeah. - So where is she? - Who? Your wife. Why do you think someone would want to be married to me? Well, I can see that, easy. Well, you can't always trust what you see. Was that your dad you were talking to last night? Yeah. I think he has a girlfriend now. He didn't even tell me. Mmm. I bet he's picking her up to do the runs with him. Mm-hmm. I used to go with him sometimes. Oh, yeah? We stayed in that motel once. No. How weird is that? Yeah. We should go. No messages. Not one message. I left for a day. He probably tried you at home. You heard me crying? Last night? I wonder how many times a day I cry. I should count one day. I bet I'd be amazed. Do you cry? No. I don't anymore. You can cry around me. If you want to. Well. Well! Well, if it isn't the general hisself. Guess what? I heard on the radio they've suspended all public transportation, so I'm your only way out of here. Well, that was kind of you to come back for us, Gordon. No problem. You sure do need saving a lot, don't you? Where did you get the coat? Oh. It's kind of different, huh? I wondered when you'd notice. We noticed right away. We just didn't know what to say. Well, I got it because it's hard for me to find a coat that really fits, 'cause I have really wide shoulders. I don't know if you've noticed, but I have unusually wide shoulders and a small tapering waist. I guess it's a little weird for me to buy, you know, since they killed my people and all. You know. It's a problem to find a coat that fits though. See? Wide, small. Oh, I have the pics. Yeah, I got them done. That one-hour was the first place open. There were all these news stations there. They wanted anybody's pictures of the storm. Oh, my God! They're awesome. Look at that. You didn't think I knew what I was talking about, did you? Why are you on the road, chief? Me? Yeah, you. Oh, I just go to see something new. I can get a job anywhere. I have money to last me. I'll probably see my dad in New Orleans, if he didn't get washed away by the storm. You know, I haven't heard from him in a while, so... What do you do? I fix computers that can't be fixed. How about you? Why are you on the road? Everybody's gotta go somewhere, right? Excuse me, I have to use the bathroom. You know, when you think about it... he's a--he's a stranger. We just picked him up. We don't really know him. Maybe we should-- Maybe we should just leave him. I know him better than I know you. We can't just leave him here. We gotta take him somewhere he can get a ride. Excuse me, do you know anyone who does handy work, boat work for a little money? No. Thanks. I'll do it. - What? - Stuff I know how to do. For the Whaler. The Boston Whaler. Little speedboat. The dirty one up front. Oh. So l--I don't know if you want to let it go. Nope. Well, thanks anyway. Hey! Whenever you think the trade is even, you can stop. I like being here down by the water. Well, I don't really like owing anybody anything. You can stop me anytime. I'm going back out to the oil rig for a month to make some dough, so I'll be gone for a while. Well, then the boat's yours. Not yet. You should probably know that. Yeah, I probably should, but I don't. I know. It's worth more than most here. You want to go out and test the boats before you leave? Yeah, sure. # Do, Lord, do, Lord # # Do, Lord, do, Lord # # Oh, do, Lord, remember me # # When I'm on my knees # Don't you know that when you read a map, you keep it pointed in the direction you're going? You turn it when we turn and you read it from the top to the bottom. Just read it from the top to the bottom. I have totally been reading it that way. You don't have to yell at me like that. I don't know how we could've gotten so lost when we had the river to the left at all times. Well, you know, you read the map then! I'm not your maid. Is there a bathroom?! Please, is there a bathroom, please?! Hello?! Please, is there a bathroom?! Anyone?! Oh. God, he's such a loser. We're gonna need some help. Maybe he ate some bad crawfish. Anybody here? No, no one. We got a problem. Oil leak. - There's a leak? - Pretty serious. No--I can take care of that. I pretty much built this car. You always this talkative? Nope. How long do you go out on the rig for? Oh, month, usually. Why did you come here to this part of the world? A mistake. You think? Yeah. Then again, I never thought through a major decision in my life, so... So that's it then. Yep. So? Not much to say after that one, huh? Nope. I think I can go one better. What? I don't think I've ever made a major decision in my life. Geez, I wish I had a cig. Don't look. All right. No. Come on, guess. You know what it is if you think about it. What do you like? It's a plant. No. But it comes from a plant. You're hot. Very hot. Well, thank you. Oh, please. What did you want? Oh! Well. Oh, well. Mmm. I like your face. Hey! Hey! Stop! Shit! Who are you with? I'll fix it when you're gone tomorrow. Could you leave, please? Please. I checked my messages at home. Nothing. I'm glad everybody's so worried about me. We could just keep going. I could live with you. You could take care of me. Do a staring contest with me. What is he doing? He's not so bad. I think you should cut him some slack. Me? I mean, he's the one who tried to rape me. Oh, get off it. I guess he's just--he is pathetic. I wouldn't use that word. I'd say young... for his age. I don't think he could quite handle your... My what? My battery's dead in my phone. I can't believe neither of you have a cell phone. Horror of all horrors. Two human beings out of touch with the rest of the universe. I don't know how you can even hang out with us. That must be hard for you. This is why they're useful. Hey, pal. Hey. You're embarrassing yourself. I think you like her, so it's a shame. Yeah, right. She's a stuck-up bitch that thinks she can do better than me. Maybe she just wants to get to know someone. Why would you think that? They're not afraid to see us as we really are. When they love, it's personal. Well, I'm finding something to help soak up some of that oil. You better be able to get me home. I'm gonna start walking soon. Fine. Walk. That would never happen again. You're right. I wish you didn't know where I live. I've been through you. Now I'm clear of you. I want that. Stay away! May! May! May! So it's fixed? Hey, can we drive now? No, I gotta take a nap. And the sun's gonna come up soon. Where's Brett? I don't know. How's it goin', chief? Oh, I feel much better. We should take off. - Hi. - Hi. If you wouldn't mind dropping me off at the next town. All right. Why? I wanna see what's goin' on around here work wise. What the hell? You dented it. He hit the car. He did what now? You woke her up. Hit the--Where you going? I'm not going anywhere. Gosh dang it. Come here. Put her back in the van. Come here. Come here, brother, look at that. Friggin' dent in the side. - What's the deal, man? - It's a ding, man. What the heck did you say? We're selling it. We're gonna have to replace the door. - Come on. Yeah, right. - It's a ding. What did you say, bitch? - Come on, man. - You going somewhere? You like that, boy? Come on, it's a friggin' ding, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey. That is unnecessary. Why don't you stay the hell out of it, old man. How do you know what is necessary for us to get through this day? We live in this car! We live here! Piece of shit. Don't you frickin' judge us. That is not what I'm doing. Hit the piece of shit, moron. You got it, baby. - Oh, my God! - I'm sorry, man! - Let him up. - It's a ding! I'm sorry! Get off me! Get off! Get in the car, Gordy. Get in the car, Gordy! Here, this is for the door. You fricking crazy-ass killer! You frickin' killer! That was intense. Did you used to fight or something? I should call my dad. He could be worried. Well, nobody will be checking up on me. They gave me a frickin' parade when I left. There were, like, people lining up. Dogs lining up. See ya! Hope we don't! No, they probably--You know, they probably sent him, that guy back there. They probably sent him to come and get me. Well, why'd you have to leave? What did you do? I never did anything to anybody. I... I made people uncomfortable, but that's all. Why do you think you made them uncomfortable? I don't know! Once I was drunk and, well, people thought I tried to kill myself, but I was drunk and I fell off a roof, and... and I just I decided to let people think it. Why would you do that? I don't know! I don't--I was really, really, really bored. Hey, cops. Sir, please pull over to your right. Please pull over. Turn off your vehicle and step out of the car. Keep your hands where I can see them. Slowly. Come on. Right back here. Hands on the car, sir. And I need to see your license please, sir. Sir, I need to see your license, please. I don't have one. So you've been driving without a license, sir? - No. - Could you speak up, please, sir? My license is expired. Well, then you've been driving without a license, haven't you? - No, sir, this, this is my-- - Be quiet. Why is that, sir? Tell me your name please, sir. Sir, could you please tell me your name? I don't have a license because I've been in prison the last six years. The kids don't know anything about this. I hitched a ride with them, and I took the wheel when I hit-- They don't know anything about it. All right, sir, slowly put your left hand behind your back. Now your other hand. If this is your car, where's your driver's license? You don't want an attorney present? No. The detective section ordered this? What you got there, sugar? Fried liver with garlic. Farnsie! - Sergeant Farnsworth! - Yeah? - Food's here. - Put it over on that, uh... Thank you. Brett Hansen? Is that Brett? It is you. Well, you look great, just great. - When did you get out? - Two days ago. Let's see, that means, what, it's been six years? Can that be? - Six, yeah. - Well, congratulations. Good for you. So, what are you doing here? Picked him up for speeding. He matched the description of the fella involved in that altercation with the couple living in the van down there. That poor child. And? Well, he admitted to being involved in the altercation, and we're investigating the situation. When I was stationed down south where Brett's from, I knew him. I knew him well. So we spent almost two whole days with an ex-convict. It's kind of cool, huh? I know you want to laugh. Go on, laugh. Maybe he is an ax murderer. That's not funny. Thank you. I appreciate it. Take care. Thanks for waiting. Everything's all right. Safe trip. Go ask him. Hey. Wait. Do you want a ride? I worry about you. You got no judgment. We should fill it up and get away from here. Away from the Robocops, whatever. Why were you in jail? I was in for manslaughter. You still want to give me a ride? I want to know why. I've been in trouble most of my life, Martine. I guess I'd have to tell you the all of it just to get to the why. Look, I can get out. You don't need to-- Was that your first time in jail? Third, if you count Juvenile Hall. So you were in juvie for what? Why? I was fourteen. Me and my buddies broke a horse out of her stall. Turned out to be some $1 0-million racehorse. Started out as a prank, but became this big deal. Took them all night to find her. I became important to the tough guys in town. They were the first people ever told me I was a winner, said I was one of them, and it went from there. So when I got out the second time-- What were you in for? Drugs. Something inside me kept saying, "You keep on like this, you're gonna ruin your whole life." I thought, Wherever it leads you, move on from where you've been, from what you've been. Cut off from everything you know. I'd never been all the way down south, so I went on as far as I could go. I went offshore. I didn't bother to turn my clock around for the two weeks on shore between gigs. I started to feel like I was already dead, but didn't know it. I would have given up within a year if it hadn't been for May. Brought your boat. Thanks, but I don't want the boat. Uh... I'd like you to have it. I don't want to have it. I don't want anything between us. So we're not friends, either? How do we do that? You just do it. I don't think I could. Why not? Because I don't trust myself. I forgive too easily, always have. Hasn't been good for me or other people, for that matter. Goodbye. I was gonna ask you to marry me. What? You don't know a thing about me. You just told me who you are. But I already knew. Your whole life is in your face. And I love that face. - But you were wrong about one thing. - What? - Those people you think are bad for you, they're probably not just bad for you. They're probably just bad. I'm going back out to the rig this afternoon. Sell it. Okay, look, if it's here when I get back, I'll keep it. I don't want to marry anyone, ever. That's okay. But I'm grateful you asked. Didn't wanna be away from her. Couldn't be away from her. She wasn't afraid... of me... maybe anything. Shit, everybody's afraid of me. I never hurt a flea. I'm not afraid of you. I get annoyed. I don't want you to keep being the way that you are. Well, no problem. I'll just--I'll change into someone else then. Okay. Hey. Why do you always do that? I don't know. Always open the cap like that and everything goes all over the place? - You got a headache? - No, tooth. - You need to go to the dentist? - Yeah. - You want me to call him? - Yeah, okay. It comes and goes, but... You like me doing all this shit for you, don't you? Yeah, I do. Been doing everything for myself most of my life. You want me to quit my shore job, go back out on the rigs and get out of your hair? I just don't understand why you started to change, become dependent. Because you're gonna make one phone call and cook every third day? Geez, I wouldn't want to make you unhappy. You still wanna get married? To who? What? What's wrong? Come on. Why's something gotta be wrong? I'm pregnant. What? It's what the blue means. I'm pregnant. Maybe. Really? But we didn't-- We never talked about it. I know. It's not for sure. I should go to a doctor. Okay. But, God, if it is, wouldn't that be...? Just never occurred to me. When will you know by? I was going to go to Dr. Leonard. - Just call me on your break. - Oh, man. - I will run up here. - Why? Oh, I just don't want anybody around. Gonna take you too long to get back here. You want to take the bike? You know, we're still working on the bridges. I can see your yard from up there. Yeah. Why don't you hoist that dirty little sail on that crummy old sailboat... if the doc confirms it. You're kidding me. No. - Okay. - Okay. I'm the guy. Yeah, you're the guy. Look out! Could you help me move him? Here. I can't drive. Down there, that might be a house. Hello! Anybody here? What were you doing with the deer? I told you, I grew up Native. I was just kind of apologizing. I was sort of saying that your life's equal to mine. I can't explain it. We're gonna need your camping things if we're gonna spend the night here. So what happened then? You were just getting to the good part, right? It happened to people around me all the time. Families. But when it happened to me, I finally felt like I was part of something. We had been given that chance late in life, and that's amazing. And then? Mr. Hansen? Your wife wants to see you. You can try again in a couple of months. And next time, with your history, you should probably come in every week, get help from us. I had an abortion before. That's what he meant by "my history". He didn't hear. I want to talk about this. Can we please talk about this? What are you doing? What are you doing? Huh? What is this? Do you still want this marriage? You said you never expected it to happen in the first place, and now you're acting like I've taken it from you! This happened to me, too! I know. And it's like you told me before, you never thought through a major decision in your life. And now I know what you meant. Ain't nothin' to talk about. Can I have a shot of Wild Turkey, please? Drink up, my friend! Drink up! Idiot me! I thought you wanted to give me a clean slate. I thought you could see my whole life in my face and you loved that face, if we're gonna hold ourselves to the things that were said. You freakin' hypocrite! You freakin' liar, "You could see it in my face."' What was that, huh? You don't know a freakin' thing about me and my life, and you wanted what? Someone who'd never been through anything, and now you're gonna treat me like shit? You are all bullshit! You are bullshit! I thought you were different. Changed. Now the first tough thing that happens, and you're out the freakin' door! The first time I really need you! Do you hear me? Do you love? Do you love? Tell me! Get off of me! Get-- Get off of me! Stop! Get off of me! What the hell you doing? Get off of her! Brett, stop it! Stop! Oh, my God. Is he dead? He died instantly. That poor man had children. Little ones, and they don't have a father now. That was an accident. - It was an accident. - No accidents. What did May do after that? Mmm...May. I only saw May one time after that. One time? Why? I would have waited. If somebody loved me like that, I would have waited and waited. You say that, but you don't know. You had a fight. It was an accident. I would have waited for years and years. She's... cold. Cold? I was the one that did this to us, not her. How would you know? How would you know? You're 15 years old. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I didn't think. Shit, I don't know what you'd do. Why not? I was the one who left her, Martine. It was me. I was the one that left. How are you? I'm all right. How are you? Not good. My husband put himself in prison for something that was an accident. That man is dead. You want this, and I can't figure out why, other than the obvious. How are the boats selling? The same. Listen, I didn't come here to talk about nothing, okay? All right. What's this? It's papers. Divorce papers. Yeah. Did you know this from the beginning? That you would fail in the marriage also? Did you have it all set in your head, and now you're happy, because it turned out the way you thought and you get to punish yourself Iike you wanted to do all along? Do you realize that you punish those who love you more? Do you understand that? Did you know that you made me love you? Did you even realize that? Why don't you give it a chance? This is your chance. Her skin, I'm not over. Her skin. What are you gonna do now? I'm gonna sleep. I'm gonna sleep under the stars. See you two in the morning. Why aren't you saying anything? What are you thinking about? Hey, give me an answer. What's wrong? Come on, tell me. I want to know. Why'd you trust him from the beginning? I think because I trust sad people. I'm sad. I didn't know that. Do you think I should not trust him? No, I think you should love him. I mean, he's as good as anyone else. and he's fucked everything up. I never felt part of anything, either. I feel apart from everything. Why'd you really get in the car? To try and make someone care about me. Well, you got that. - Who's that? - That's me. And the guy next to you? That's my dad. I can hardly remember him, though, because he left me with his girlfriend who brought me up on the reservation. That's who I know as my mom. That's why I say I'm Native. Great, so you're not. I mean, you're adopted. No, no. No, I'm Native. I mean, that's-- that's all I've known. You should start at the beginning. So, what kind of project is this? Well, it's a science project. I had this idea it might be of use to someone, you know, in science. I got a list of some universities in the back I'm gonna turn it in to when I've... You know, when I've collected enough data. Thought somebody might be interested in, you know, studying abnormality firsthand. That's brilliant... I think. Yeah, maybe it can help somebody. Or me. Maybe it could help me. No. No, no, no, no. No, I take the photos! Well, anyway, you're-- You're way more fascinating than me. I reckon that you could probably, like, help whole races of people. Think planets. I wouldn't limit the scope of your abnormality to humans only. Hungry? Yeah. Coffee, please. Coffee, and OJ. That postcard, the other day? That was to May. That was to her? I sent that off into space. Where we used to live. I don't know... if she still lives there. I don't know if she lives with somebody. What'd you say? I said if she wanted to see me, she should put up the yellow sail on the sailboat. And, um, I said l'd, uh... I'd stop by... and check and see if it was there. And if it wasn't there, I'd go away. I'll walk away and won't bother her anymore. Excuse me? When the food comes out, can we get it boxed up? We're going. I think it's better if I let her alone. All right, well... All right, well, I'll drop you off at the bus stop, because we're gonna go find her. No, you wrote that letter, and now you're trying to get out of it. Well, how's that gonna help anything? No, this is your fate. And you gotta play this out to the end, or you're gonna walk around a ghost the rest of your life. You can't go see her looking like that. Can we pull over? Why? It was selfish what I did, writing her. I should just let her be. I know that. What a waste of gas. Do you think she knows? Knows what? That she's the one thing in your whole life you've ever loved? Yeah, she does. She's smart. Well, then you probably don't have to go. It's just, it's weak. What you're doing is weak, it's not selfish. We'll be there with you when you have to face it. So where is it? Which side of the bridge? It's to the left of the red lighthouse. Is that--ls that it? No, they're tugboats. That's not the houseboat? No, there's nothing there. A lot can happen in six years. Just have to accept it, Martine. Have to accept it. Maybe we can go by your old house? It's only a couple blocks away, right? It doesn't hurt, right? We're here? It does hurt. It's the blue house on the right. It's not her. It's over. It's all right. Thank you for bringing me to the end. Please, let's find a place to say goodbye. Stop, stop! Go back. What? It's May. Okay.
