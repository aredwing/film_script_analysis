 

                        1 What's your first memory? Here's mine, ready? All my life, I knew I was destined for one thing. To be a great artist. From the very beginning, I knew exactly what my medium would be and I knew, with every fiber of my being that... that my creations were going to be tremendous works of art. They'd touch people in the deepest of ways, make them see things differently, see themselves differently. Make them say to each other, "this here, this is truly great." But somehow, something, somewhere along the way went, I don't know,...Wrong. Herman! It's 3:00 in the morning, what are you doing? Mom, I'm working! Lady, I would just prefer to show my work to Ms. Klein herself. Look, if you want Ms. Klein to see it, it has to go through me first. That's just how it works. Fine, okay. It's a commentary on how our country's eco-imperialist policies directly correlate to the rise of carbon monoxide in the earth's atmosphere. It's a mobile. I'm making your favorite. I think you spend too much time down there. You need to get out more. I need to work. What work? You don't work. If I had a job, then when would I have time for my art, mom? Besides, making mobiles is the only thing that I'm good at. Maybe it's time you found something else. What do you want me to do, huh? You want me to quit? Oh, Hermann. Bring me the skins, will you, dear? What about your uncle? He can give you some good advice. Why don't you call him? Uncle Felix? Crazy uncle Felix, who makes jewelry out of shells? What? Come on. What "come on"? He make beautiful earrings, see? He doesn't even make those himself. He exploits these poor villagers to do it. He exploits them, he pays them pennies, and then he turns around and he sells his art for hundreds. He's a total hack. You show respect. Ever since your father died he sent a check every Christmas. He's a good man. He's a hack. Helps with the bills more than you do. I'm not calling him, okay? I'm just saying for your own good, Hermann! You know, you're not getting any younger. Can you crank, dear? Hermann. Joel, where's your piece? - Not finished yet. - Pfft. I know what you're thinking. You see, it's all part of my new technique. I call it "instantaneous art." The whole notion of the tortured artist investing months in one piece. It just seems so... Historic. You don't have a piece, do you? You ever been struck by lightning? Great art is like lightning. It's effortless, only takes an instant to create. And when it hits you, wham! Know what I mean? Pretty pictures! Pretty pictures! Hiya, chief. I didn't know you had a showroom in this neighborhood. I branched out. Want me to try selling some of your work? You get a fair cut. Yeah, I make real art, not, uh, whatever this is. Oh, I see, you make real art. I ever tell you about my friend Marlon? Have a seat, chief. Marlon was a painter, poor son of a bitch. He was convinced he was the next Kandinsky. Only it turns out, he couldn't paint worth half a damn. I mean, it's plain to everybody he stinks. Only no one has the guts to tell him, you know? Sure. So the guy struggles his whole life. Only it's not working, he can't sell a thing. Ate his insides out. One day, he comes by talking about some lizard he found. He got obsessed with the way they can break off their tails, you know, to escape from danger. Survival mechanism. Anyway, it must have got to where he couldn't take it anymore. So one day, he just snapped. Took out a pair of garden shears and cut his fingers clean off, all of them. I guess he just needed to stop the pain. Anyway, he's a lot happier now. His brother takes care of him. He gets monthly checks from the government, no biggie. I could never sell his stuff anyway. Mom? Oh, hey, you must be Hermann. Did not wake you, did I? There's a man in my bathroom. Oh, that's Mr. Shariff. He says he always tests a shower before renting a place. You're renting out my room? Hermann, we need the money. But where will I sleep? With me, we'll be like roomies. I love it, Zig, I'll take it. Who is this? Hey, uncle Felix, it's Hermann. Hermann who? I don't know any... oh, of course, Jackie's kid. Well, ain't that a kick in the pants. How the hell are ya? How's your mom? Fine, uh, listen, uncle Felix, I was... hey, bun-bun, rum gimlet! I, um, I was hoping I could ask you for some advice. Um, you know, on account of you being a successful artist. Um, oh, yeah, I get by. Yeah, it's just I'm an artist too. And it's just not working out. Hm, oh yeah? Yeah, and I have the chops. I mean, that's... that's not it. It's just that something's wrong, you know? Like something's missing. Stop right there. I had the same problem when I was starting out. - You did? - Absolutely! Let me guess, you feel like something's just not right. Like there's this nebulous dark cloud surrounding you. Am I right, or am I right? Yeah, yeah. Are you all wound up tight? Feelings of apathy, depression, trouble sleeping? Yeah. Yup, I went through the same thing. I know exactly what you need. You do? What? Take down this address, my old studio apartment. Uh, okay, you want me to go there? Dammit, I want you to live there. What you need is your own space to work, uninhibited. And this place is perfect. It's where I was holed up at the precise moment that success struck me like a bolt from the blue. Pow! Changed everything. Yeah, I mean, that's exactly what I need. Aw, dammit, I said "gimlet." Ice, rum, lime juice. I tell ya, down here, these are a beautiful people. Yeah, um, thank you so much for letting me stay there. When can I move in? Right away, 800 a month. Oh, uh, I... I uh... What, what's the matter? I just... I can't afford that. Come on, I'm renting you well-being, freedom, and at a very good rate for a studio in that location. You know what I think? You can't afford to pass it up is what I think. I... I just... I don't have that kind of money. Hermann, what can I tell ya? Success doesn't come cheap. You sleep on it. Who knows, maybe you can sell some blood? I'm going to need a lot of blood. Artist Joel Windle has found a new take on collaborative art. He allows his buyers to sign the artwork and they even receive a portion of the profits when the next buyer signs. I'm letting them take part in the art. I just made $20. I just made two grand. Okay, how is that not a Ponzi scheme? It's a small price for them to pay to become an artist. It's cheaper than art school, anyway. Devora. - May I? - Of course. Ladies and gentlemen of the art world, I have a little announcement. I am very excited to announce that Joel Windle has just signed on as the Devora Klein gallery's newest artist. Our group show is in a month. He'll be my crowning Jewel. Devora? Ms. Klein? Look, I am so sorry about what happened back there. That... that shouldn't have happened, okay? That wasn't part of the art piece. I, uh, I brought you some water. Look, I... that isn't 1/10th of what I can do. If you just give me a chance... haven't you done enough already? You have to put me in your next show. - Please! - Are we done here? - A little more. - I'll do anything, okay? Just give me a chance, just one chance. I'll... I'll lock myself up for two weeks. And... and... and if I don't produce something startlingly, truly amazing, then... then I'll... Quit forever? Yeah, yeah, I'll quit forever. Fine, you do that. Thank you so much, Ms. Klein. I... I won't let you down, okay? Hey, uncle Felix, hey, it's Hermann. Could you rent me the place for two weeks? It's all I've got. H... hi, I'm... I'm here about the apartment. You must be Hermann. I'm Layla, the manager. Your uncle's told me all about you. You're the artist. Yeah. So... I'll show you the apartment. Uh... You know, since I've been manager here, I don't think anybody's ever lived in this unit. Well, my... my uncle lived in it, I guess, until he bought the apartment. Well, here, it's around the corner and on the left. Okay. And garbage pickup's Fridays. - Thanks. - M-hm. Hi, Hermann, how's your art coming? Fine. Aren't you going to invite me in? I'd love to see your work. I don't like to show works in progress. Of course, I understand completely. Anyway, I was just baking, and I accidentally made an extra pie and I thought you might be hungry. You made a pie? Peach. You do like peach pie, don't you? Yeah, uh... Thanks. Hermann, I just wanted to tell you if you ever need any help, not to presume that I know anything about art but if you ever need any, I don't know, moral support or something, or anything, just let me know. I should get back. Don't worry, I'll be back later for the plate. Oh, okay, come on. Ow. I'm going insane. Yes? Hey, Devora, it's, uh, it's me, Hermann Haig. Um, two weeks ago, I... I said that I would have something amazing for you. And, well, it's... it's been two weeks. Right. The one with the... with the blood. Yeah, yeah, right. You know, this really isn't the best time. Thanks. Uh... Hello? Hey, it's me. Just if... if you'd let me show you, I think you're really going to love it. I mean, really, it's like... It's like nothing you've ever seen before. I'm not taking on any new artists right now. Thanks. What? Um, I don't understand. Two weeks ago, you said, "come back in two weeks." Why would you... why would you say that if... if like, uh... when what, when I didn't mean it? Because I wanted you to get out of my face, and that's what I'm asking you to do right now. Walk away, do not come back. Your art is terrible; Please don't buzz me again. Uh, I see, thanks. Ladies and gentlemen, Hermann Haig. Here, maybe you can sell it. Sure, chief. Stupid, stupid, stupid Herman. Yeah, two weeks, come on by. What is it? 128, 129.50, 135, 2, 275, 280, 280. 300? This is a one-of-a-kind work of art. - 400. - - 2,000. 2,000. 2,000, going once, going... - sold. Aw, man. It's really quite exquisite. Back there, I owe you an apology. I'm sorry. You know, it'd be a shame if the art world lost a voice like yours. Whoo! Yeah! Yes! Whoo! Well, how did it go? You're not dreaming. I'm still here. It was incredible. You won't believe what happened. Not only did the piece sell, but guess who wants to sign me as her newest artist? Did you get bigger? Who wants to sign you? Devora Klein. Devora Klein! That's great, I knew you could do it. It wasn't me, it was what you gave me. Thank you. God, I still can't believe it. I have more, you know. You do? Because, well, de... de... Devora wants to put me in a show. And, well, if she does that, then, uh, I'm going to need a lot more mobiles. I have many, many more. I get lonely here all by myself. How about I help you make mobiles, and in return, all you have to do is spend time with me? That's it? That's it. Partners? Uh, yeah, yeah, partners. If you had a hand, I'd shake it. Why don't we seal it with a kiss? Think of all the incredible art we could make together. How was that? Perfect. All right, well tell me some of the bigger names. Pollock, Warhol, Nagel. Wait, you helped Nagel too? Yeah, what can I say? The Duran Duran guy? Yes. Who else? It's not important. Oh, hi. I just came back for my pie plate. Oh, right, one sec, okay? Here you go. It was delicious. - I'm so glad you liked it. - - Yeah. I'll make you another. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, that's okay. It's no problem. Hermann, I don't mean to pry, but is there someone else staying here with you? Hm? Well, it's just that I could have sworn I distinctly heard a female voice. Uh, I'm the only one here. It's just me. Good. That is a lovely dress. Wow. - You're back. - Hi, uh... I've been thinking about our next piece all day. Shall we get started? Uh, yeah, um, I thought I told you. I'm going to Devora's tonight. Yeah, she's got these fancy new art collectors in town, and, well, she said it'd be a good idea if I met them, so. I see. You should be happy. She's showing our piece. It's a good thing. I hope they like it. We can work when you get back. Yeah, um, I don't know when I'm going to be back, so you probably shouldn't wait up, uh... See ya. Bye. Bye. - Hermann. - - Hi. - Come on. - Oh, okay. Hermann, nice to meet you. Hermann? I have a present for you. I guess I'll just leave it outside. Hermann? I'm going to bring it inside so... so nothing happens to it. Okay, I'm coming in now. Coming in... A movie, right. Will you excuse me? Back off, Percy, this one's mine. You're excited? I invited some of my biggest collectors to see your piece tonight. Yeah, so don't blow it. I just came by to pick up my stuff. I didn't know you were having a party. Your attention please? Thanks. This is a very important moment for me because the work you're about to see is from a man who is proving to be one of the most gifted artists I've ever discovered. It gives me great pleasure to present to you... Hermann Haig's "permission." Hermann, I've never seen anything like it. They really like your piece. What do you think of it? What do I think? I think I just sold it for 50,000. To who? Them. You know, when I made it, I was thinking of you. Well, whatever you're doing, keep it up. With something like this, you've got to strike while the iron's hot. Well, you'll have to do a one-man show. - Really, me? - Yeah. How soon can you make four more? - Uh, four? - A month? Uh... I already sent out the press releases. Uh, yeah, I mean, I think... I think I can. Yeah? Because, you know, you and I, we could have a really great future together. They'll be ready in a month. Good, we're going to make a great team, you and I. Tell me, Hermann, 'cause I wanna know, how does a guy like you get to be so talented all of a sudden? Aren't you going to ask me how it went? How did it go? It was unreal. All these fancy people there, just... just to see my artwork. And the way they reacted, uh, you'll never guess. Orgy? How'd you know? And she sold it. Oh, god, she is so amazing. She wants me to have my own show. Me! Can you believe it? Are you crying? I was afraid. I started thinking you'd leave me, never come back. You're not serious? You don't know what it's like. Before you, I was all alone, withering away. It was unbearable. I won't go back to that, not ever. Look, I... I'm not leaving you. Okay? I... I could... I could never leave you, okay? Just a little more. I'm trying. Well, push harder. I'm sorry. What's wrong? I don't know, I just can't do this today. But our deadline, we're already behind. I'm sorry, Hermann. Sometimes I just get blocked up when I'm feeling lonely. Even I need inspiration once in a while. But we're so close. What if... is there anything I can do? Well, there is, actually. At least, it would put me more at ease. What? Tell me. I can't, not out loud. You're joking, right? No, that is... that is way too... What? I just... I just think that we should keep things between us professional, all right? Well then, I guess that's that. So tell me, what's Devora going to say when you go to her empty handed? Who am I kidding? I'm just the artist, right? No, not like that. Your shirt, take it off. Now, kiss me. Slow. Touch me, slow. Here you go. How are the new pieces coming? Fine. "Art news nation" called. They want to do an interview. Okay. Devora, have you ever gotten involved with someone where you're just a little bit unsure that it's the right thing? What do you mean? Like you... you get mixed up in a relationship, right? And at first, it seems so perfect. But then... Percy's been talking to you again, hasn't he? - No, no, no, no. - Trying to steal you from me? That's not it, it's, uh... You want more money, is that it? I mean, I can write you another check. No, no, it... it's fine, okay? Just... Just forget it. Hermann, we've come so far together. You're a great artist, and I sell great art. Is that all we have? I want to show you something. What do you think? What do I think? Uh, well, I think a three-year-old painted these. I mean, they're not even horrendous in an interesting way. They're... They're horrendous-bad. I mean, why would you keep these? Who's the artist? Me. Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry, I didn't know, I... no, you're right, they're awful. I know. You don't know what it's like. But when it comes to selling other people's art, I'm the best there is. You have real talent. I'd kill for that. But all the talent in the world won't get your artwork seen. That's something I do. Understand? You and I... We're meant for each other. Good morning, Hermann. I wanted to surprise you, but I guess you found me. Relax, it's still me. It's you, you know. Your love is making me grow. How wonderful. Uh, uh, we should get started. Are you sure you wouldn't rather sleep in? You got home pretty late last night. No, no, I'm... I'm fine. Great. I'll just get... I'll just get changed. Don't I get a kiss good morning? Well? So, tell me, is she better than me? Is who? You know who. What are you talking about, Devora? Uh, well, you know, we had some... some things to go over, some details about the show. I'll bet. What does that mean? Where is this coming from? Do I need to draw you a map? You know, I think I'm just going to get some air. Wait, don't go. I'm sorry. She doesn't care about you, you know, not really. I see what you're doing, and it won't work. She and I, we have something, okay? We have something special. Hermann, what about us? What about us, huh? What about us? What kind of relationship could we possibly have? You're not even fucking human. I'm sorry. I... I gotta go. Hi, Herm. This isn't Hermann. Who is this? His partner. We need to talk. Hello? Come in. The power's out. Where are you? Over here. Sit. So, you're Devora. Where are you exactly? Behind the wall. You'll have to forgive me, I'm shy. Who are you? I'm the source of Hermann's inspiration. You've seen his work before he met me. You must have noticed the dramatic improvement. Actually, I did wonder about that. I'll cut to the chase. You make a killing selling Hermann's art. But if it weren't for me, there'd be no art. I have a proposition for you. I'll make sure you get one masterpiece after another. All you have to do is stay away from him. Well, I'd love to, but Hermann needs me. But in a way, I'm his muse. Sorry, no deal. You live here too? Yes. Ever think about moving? No. Apparently, neither do the rats. Feeling all right? Devora? Devora! Come on, Devora! Oh, hi. Ow, uh, I must have dozed off. Is your little girlfriend gone? Girlfriend? Hiding behind the wall. I don't have a girlfriend. Whoa. I'm all right, really. So that girl, she doesn't make the art? Never lays a finger on it. Good. - Hermann. - Hey. There's something you need to know about me. That woman in my apartment? - She is your girlfriend. - No, no. Uh, she's not even a woman. Look, I... I can't explain it, okay? She... it... it was something I found, okay? In the apartment, in the wall. I know... I know it's hard to believe. But... but when you want something so bad your whole life and then... and then suddenly it just gets handed to you, you don't ask questions, okay? You... you... you just take it! Look, I don't make the art, okay? I don't. She does. She does. You think I'm crazy? Actually, I believe you. You do? I didn't want you to find out that I... that I don't have any really talent, you know? That... that I'm just some... failed artist? Yeah, yeah, but don't you see? You and I, we belong together. I mean, that is, if you still want me. Yes, yes, yes, of course I want you. There's something I gotta do, okay, right now. Come on, come on! Joel? Don't even think about it. It's got to be done, Joel, okay? You have no idea what you're getting involved in. You had your chance. Turn around and walk away. No, stop, don't hurt him! You should be thanking me! God. Hermann, wait. Hermann, what are you doing? He was hurting you, I had to. No, don't! Can't you see she just wants you for your art? Can't you see that, what she really is? Bitch! Monster! Don't be such a fool, Hermann. She's using you.. We're in love. Don't do this, I'm begging you. Wait, remember when we first met? All you wanted was to be an artist. Remember, that was your dream. What are you doing? Transplanting her. I already have the perfect spot picked out in my gallery. From now on, I'm making my own art. No! Stop it! Hermann. I'm here. It's bad, real bad. No, it... it's fine. It'll be fine. I'll patch you up, you'll get better. Forget the mobiles. It's not about that. You mean so much more to me than that. I don't know why I never said it before. I need you to know that, okay? I need you to know that.
