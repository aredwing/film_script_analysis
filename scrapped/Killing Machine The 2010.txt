Start off your rise And keep complaining you're not justified You're intuition leav esme Nothing left here to disguise This problem is your own I'd rather be left alone Your bat tles cars to fall Find another place to crawl You can place Theblame But no one' slistening I don't want you Here with me 'Cause all your pressure Fall son me So take your smoking gun From me Am I your only Tragedy Oh, it's good being here with you. I came back as soon as I could. You know, I was thinking. - You were thinking? - Mm-hmm. That I'd like to get a new car. What's wrong with your old one? It's so last year. - Look. - Just a couple hundred bucks more. Please? Then I can get myself a new car. Okay, I'll see what I can do. - You won't regret it. - lgnore it. - I gotta make sure there's no problem. There won't be a problem. - I gotta take this. - Don't. It's her. I thought you said your marriage was over. Yeah, well, I've still got a daughter with her. - Hi. Are you back? Yeah, late flight. You kind of forgot to call. Did l? - Yeah, you said you would. I'm sorry. It's been one of those days. You're with her, aren't you? No. I understand. It's okay. I mean, I'm the one who said you should move on so... Look, I didn't mean to interrupt. Taylor's school play is tomorrow. I just wanted to remind you, okay? I shouldn't have called. It's too awkward. What did I expect, right? I'll see you tomorrow. Have a good night. Yeah, you too. - Yeah. - lcarus, it's Serge. - Yeah? There's a property in Hong Kong, needs a - an appraisal. - Can it wait? - No. - Blueprints? - At the office. -Right. - Oh, and, lcarus. -Yeah? - It's a foreclosure. Yeah. A foreclosure. The KGB will call it a blyadstvo. Areal bad situation. Limited details, limited specs, short window. A rush job, a suicide gig. No one cares if I walk out, so long as the mark doesn't. But I always walk out. Whoever you are You're everywhere Whoever you are You're everywhere... - Don't do it. The problem with you Russians is that you think you're immune. Fuck you! Tell me who you're looking for. Who are you? Your executioner. What's your name? Oleg. Then I guess today's your lucky day. - Nice car. - Good trip? - Not bad. - Was it boring? - It had its moments. Miss me? Always. - What? - Shit! You're back. Got anything for me? Look, before you say anything Where is he? Serge isn't here. That's not the way the deal goes. That is between you and him. You leave me out of this. How do you get in contact with him? I don't. He gets in contact with me and you know that. Don't fuck me, Kim. Why would I do that? Look, I haven't heard from him since you saw him. Honestly. I have as much to do with him as I do with you. He comes in here unannounced and then he leaves - vanishes. I don't even know his If you see Serge, you tell him I'm not happy. Believe me, I will. Icarus! In the KGB, not getting paid your dues meant something. It was a message. Good morning, Edward. Welcome back. Jeff wants to see you when you finish your first meeting. What meeting, Janet? He's already in your office. - A... Mr. Graham. Hi, Mr. Graham. Hello, Edward. I'm sorry. My secretary didn't tell me. We must have had our wires crossed. How do you do? I'm good. Actually, I wanted to talk with you. Oh. Can I get you anything? No, I'm fine. If I have more than two coffees in one day, I'm buzzing all morning. You must feel as if you're on top of the world up here. Yeah, when it's not raining. Are you from Vancouver? No. I'm really not from anywhere anymore. You must feel the same thing, the way you travel for work. I travel a little, yes. The nomadic life of the salesman. - "Which time zone am I in today?" So I'm trying to remember where we met. It was at the conference last year in New York. You and Jeff were pushing some West African properties. At the time, I was uninterested, but now I think my company and l could do something, if that's still the case. I'm sorry. We sold those properties six months ago. - Six months? - Yeah. Well, that is my bad luck. I can offer you some other investment opportunities in China or Australia, - get your portfolio - Do you have anything in Hong Kong? No. Mainland China. Well, that's not going to work for my business model, but thank you. Do you have a card, Mr. Graham? Of course. A pleasure to meet you. But we did meet before? Yes, we did. I told him you weren't happy. I don't like to be fucked around. Before you say anything else, I understand. Wire transfer delay. My mistake. Hey, look, you want to count it? That's not good business. Believe me, I know. I work for the man, just like you. You think in 10 years, you've got to give the system a little leeway. One delay. I didn't hear from my people, hence you didn't hear from me. Easy math. Cigarette? You know I quit. No one ever really quits, my friend. So did you have any problems in Hong Kong? No. Hmm? Nothing out of the ordinary? You gave me a target. I took the target. Job completed. End of story. And you took care of everyone? When do I not? Hey, I don't mean to insult you, okay? Come on... Look, hey, I have another assignment for you. You leave tonight. - What's the matter? - I just got back. Then don't unpack your bags. What if I say no this time? What are you fucking telling me? I'm not telling you anything. Payment won't be delayed. I promise you that. You promised me I'd always be paid on time. Look... I don't know what crazy fucking ass ideas are going through your head, but we both know if you walk, it won't be good... -...for either of us. Thinking for yourself gets you in trouble. Hey, it's a red-eye flight. Have you back in time for Sunday dinner. Does that give you enough time to settle things on your end? Do you have anything in Hong Kong? And you took care of everyone? Who are you? Delayed payments. Questions. Something's wrong. It's time for me to start getting some answers. What time are we supposed to be finished at the north end? Do you know? Serge is a nobody. He follows orders just like me. I need a source, someone I can trust. Quite an empire you're creating here, Kerr. A bit of this, a bit of that makes me look legit. - You never look legit. I fool some people. Come here. So what do you need? - Someone in Miami. - Done. - Gear? - Dragunov. What about an M170? Too much recoil. .50 cal. Go through a brick wall. - My target isn't a brick wall. A man who knows what he wants. I need it for pickup in Miami tomorrow morning. No problem. Here, call this number, ask for Constantine. He'll set you up. One more thing can you run a check on this guy? He said his name was Mr. Graham. I think he's full of shit. Everyone in investments is full of shit. They're fucking up the world. He was asking too many questions. I didn't like what he was implying. Which was what? That he knew who I was. Yeah, I'll run it by some old friends at the agency. I'll see what I can do. Now I don't understand why you don't just quit your day job and face the facts. You are what you are. There's no escaping it. One day. Hmm. Dream a little dream, huh? Don't stand too close, Mr. Family Man. Remember what the myth says about lcarus. Hi, honey. Hi, Taylor. How about a hug? I love you, Mommy. - Go on in. -Taylor. Hey. What did I do now? You missed her school play. Well, I've been traveling a lot lately, you know. Yeah, that was the problem all the excuses. So, um... ...is she staying? She's supposed to. This was my weekend to go away. Or did you forget that, too? No no, l I didn't forget. Golfing, right? - With that new guy? - Yeah, that weekend. - So is he in the car? - No. Does he know about me? Of course he does. So... do you like him? Do you like April? She's okay. I gotta go. This is the place where we're staying. The number for the nanny is on the bottom in case you run into any problems. I'll call and check in later, okay? Don't worry. We'll have a good time. And don't spoil her with treats. Make sure she eats lots of vegetables. Hey. You're looking good, Joey. You look tired. April's gonna make you pancakes for breakfast and I'll be home for dinner. I know you're mad at me. I'm mad at myself. I shouldn't have missed your school play. I'm sorry. Mom said you were real good. I bet you were the best tree on stage. I was the only tree. You wanna show me what you did? I don't like it here. I want to go back to your house. I'm sorry. It's only for one night. You've gotta be nice to April while I'm gone. She'll never replace Mom, but you gotta do what she says. I don't want you to go. I've gotta work. I'll come back real soon. Mommy says you work too much and that's why we don't live with you. Well, she's probably right. Are you ever gonna stop working and come home, Daddy? - It's not up to me. Eddie. Okay. Okay, good night. Okay. In the last two weeks, I've seen you twice. Now I'm stuck looking after some kid that's not mine while you get to jet off to Miami. It's not fair. I'll make it up to you. That's all I ever hear from you. - I will. I'm sorry. Hold on. Taylor made you this. Have a good trip, Eddie. You can only tell the same lie so many times before it gets stale. April sensed it was false. Women have a sixth sense about the truth. I was just in another relationship that was drying up. History has a way of repeating itself, no matter how many times I try to prevent it. Hi, it's me. Hey, how was your trip? Fine. Is Taylor okay? Yeah, she's great. She just went to bed. Did she act funny? She was difficult at dinner, wasn't she? Well, maybe a little. You have to spend more time with her, okay? - I know. Where are you? I'm just - just getting some stuff for breakfast. Where's Taylor? She's with April. Oh. I gotta go, so I just wanted to make sure that Taylor was okay. Bye. Bye. Who sent you? Tell me! Hello. - Get out of the apartment. - What are you talking about? - Open the door! Police! -You have to listen to me. - What's going on? - Why are the police here? - Listen, grab Taylor - and get out of the apartment. - Why? No! No! No! No! Manuela, Manuela! - Mr. Genn. - Where is she? - Oh, sleeping. - All right. April said that you wanted me to take care of her. I love you, Daddy. I love you, too. Gonna go on a big adventure, okay? - What happened to your face? - I fell down. Get your coat and shoes. Right now. Go. - Come on. Wait here. - Come on, quickly. - Let's go. - Okay. Daddy! Come on. - Daddy! - Let's go. Where are we going? - Are you okay, Taylor? - Yeah, but I'm scared. - Manuela. - What's happening, Mr. Genn? - No, I can't, Mr. Genn. - We don't have time. Let's go. - Maybe - maybe - maybe I hide. Daddy! - Get inside. - Dad, what are you doing? Dad, what are you doing? - I forgot my keys. - But this isn't our car. I just bought it. Put your seat belt on. One bad decision, one bad choice. That's all it takes to go from being the hit man... to being the hit. Excuse us. Jesus, Eddie, what happened? I need to go underground. Someone has a contract out on me. They tried to kill my family. - Where's Joey? - Out of town. Taylor's outside with me. Your girlfriend? Oh fuck. This could affect both of us. My cover is blown. I need your help. Yeah. I'll get Taylor to the farm, try and work some business from my end. - Lou. - I need transport and a phone. Done, okay. Daddy! Look, I'm going to get Mommy, okay, sweetie? This nice lady's gonna take you to her farm. - I don't wanna go. - I know, honey. I'm sorry. I'll be there with Mommy soon. Daddy, please don't let me go. I never will. You gotta do me a favor, okay? You go with Manuela. I'll go get Mom. We can all be together, okay? Yeah, I promise you're gonna like it. Miss Kerr, she's got a big farm with a barn and lots of animals. I'm going to get Mommy and bring her to you, right? But you gotta be a good girl and do what Manuela says. Can you do that? Yeah, hmm? - Yeah. - Okay, Manuela. You sit tight, and I'll be there very soon. - My friend will take care of you. - Si, Seor Genn. - Okay? - Don't worry, Taylor. - I'll take care of you. - I love you very much, okay? - Yeah? - I love you, Daddy. Be extra nice to her. She'll be safe. She'd better. - There you go. - How about you guys? Two more? - Yeah yeah. - Fuck! -The bar's closed. He's right. Bar's closed. Get out. Out out out! Get out! You heard her. Who set me up? I don't know what you're talking about. I swear. Hey, what's all this about setting - The job was bogus. - Nyet. Nyet. That's impossible! It came through the proper channels. I did nothing wrong. Who issued the order? Give me a name and a number. - Who issued the order? - You know I can't give you that. His name is Turk. Turk! His name and number are in my jacket. You didn't get it from me, okay? You two only meet when there's a job. How come you're here? - I got the call. - What, you didn't ask for me? - Joey, I gotta talk to you. - Get up! - That sounds like your ex-husband. Eddie? Oh my God. What happened? - Where's Taylor? - You're bleeding - Don't worry about it. What happened? Where's Taylor? You have a gun. You know what? I'm just gonna - I'm gonna call - Don't. - Whoa. - Put that down. - All right, all right. - Where's Taylor? What happened? - I've gotta get you two out of here. I'm not going anywhere with you until you tell me where Taylor is. - She's safe. - "Safe"? - What happened? - I can't talk about it. I'm not going with you until you tell me where she is. Well, like I said, she's safe. I'm gonna make sure you're safe, too. Look, man, if you're in trouble, I'm a lawyer. I know people. - You know nothing. Get back there. - Okay, all right. Eddie, what have you done? I'll tell you later. I'll explain later. Come on. - You too. Go. Go. Come on. - That's not answer! - I think we can deal with this. Shh shh. You can't just do things like this, Eddie. Get down. It's the police. - Help! - Joey! My ex-husband's gone crazy. He tried to attack Put your hands in the air. - Where is he? - Upstairs. Hey, guys, just leave her alone, all right? We don't want any trouble. Where is Edward? I don't know what you're talking about. Look, I'm her ex-husband, okay? - She's talking about me. - What are you doing? I hate liars. No! Now are you going to tell us where your husband is? It's okay. Come on. Come on, let's go. I can't. Eddie? Just keep going. Are you okay? Eddie? Go. Eddie, can you hear me? Just drive. Where's Taylor? Are you doing something illegal? Where are we? Some motel in the middle of nowhere. Answerme Eddie! Dave is dead, and you almost got me killed. I need to know everything. It's it's just I'll fix it. Fuck you, Eddie. Come on. This is all you know, isn't it? Put the gun down, Joey. Who are you? Who are you really? - Look, you have to trust me. - I have trusted you and now you're endangering our lives! You can't just pass me off with some bullshit answer! I need to know that our daughter is safe. I need to know that this is going to be okay. - Joey, just lower the gun. - Don't tell me what to do. - Joey! Joey! - I'll shoot. Fuck you! What the fuck is going on?! I could have driven to the nearest police station and I didn't! I drove here instead! You owe me the truth. I Just wanna know the truth. - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, baby. - What is the truth? - It's okay. It's okay. Where is she? I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything. It's okay. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. My real name is Evgeny. You have a real name? Yeah. Evgeny what? Chirilenko. Why did you change your name? I used to work for the KGB. When the Soviet Union fell... we all became wrapped up in the mess afterwards. I quit. I came here. Do you work for the Russian mob? Yeah. What did you do for them? Anything they wanted. Did you kill people? Did you kill people? I had no choice. They found me. They made it clear that they could do anything they wanted to me and my family. That's why I left you. You endangered our daughter. I know. I'm sorry. Is Taylor a hostage? She's safe. She's with a friend. Hey, Kerr, it's me. Yeah, put Taylor on the line. Taylor. Hi, honey. Are you okay? Yeah. I love you, too. I'm done lying. From here on out, I'll tell her everything. Now we're in this together. Are you sure you wanna do this? I'm not losing you again. - The safety off. - Okay. - Ready to fire. So what do you do when you find him? Finish things. What if he's waiting? He won't know what hit him. lnformation the most dangerous thing to ask for. The most dangerous thing to give up. Someone wanted it from Turk. They pulled his spleen out to get it. Someone's squeezing the middle, cleaning house. This is gonna get worse before it gets better. Daddy! Oh! - Mommy! - Honey. - Hey. - Hi, Daddy. You okay? Everything will be fine. Don't worry. - I'm gonna speak to Kerr. We live in a universe of shit, my friend. - You hungry, Mr. Genn? Coffee? - No, thanks. Yeah, please. The man who hired me is dead. The man who hired him is dead. His name was Turk. You know him? No. You find out anything about this Graham guy, Iike who he works for? I wish I knew. He doesn't exist. Your daughter's a good kid. I just want this to be over with. So do l. You know this is bigger than the both of us, right? How many guys you got? Enough. Yeah. I'm listening. Excuse me. I need a number. Mr. Genn! No! No! Daddy, Mommy! Stay there. Stay there! No! Get back inside! Come here. - Come on. Come on, let's go. Help! - Take her. - Taylor! It's okay. It's okay. To the back. There's a way out. -Taylor! - Daddy! -Taylor! Taylor! - Daddy! - Put her down. Daddy! - Don't move, Joey. Tough break for you. You sold me out. I thought we were more than that. Well, friendships only last as long as you need. You and I are just cogs, Eddie. We have no choice. They want the lot of you gone. I'm not gonna question them. - Who's they? - Since when do we get the details? Just the orders. Okay. Okay. You let her go... and I'll complete the transaction. - No! - Freeze! On the ground! - Run, Taylor! - Run, Eddie! Go go go go go! Now! -Hurry up! - Mommy! - Taylor! Bravo! Mr. Graham. I was wondering when I would see you again. Life has a way of running in circles. Where's my wife and daughter? For the moment, safe. This file is all about a KGB agent who became an assassin for the Russian mob. Icarus. Are you guys ClA? How long have you been onto me? Not long enough, Eddie. Or should I call you lcarus? Or do you prefer Evgeny? - I'm Eddie now. - Of course you are. Well, Eddie. Do you know this man? I'm sure you recognize your old comrade, the one who brought you into the mob. lcarus! The choice is kill my friend or... I haven't seen him in years. Well, that's no surprise. Most people never get to see Vadim Varselov. When you came to America, you both went your separate ways. Vadim worked his way up the Russian crime syndicate and you ended up working for the competition. But Vadim wanted the Hong Kong business. Soon that started a war. Now you're the only one left. You can't keep me here. Actually, we can do whatever we want. You see, you don't exist, so what government is going to complain? What about my family? They have a chance. You don't. How? Vadim is a nasty piece of business. I'm not gonna do your dirty work. Well, then I can erase you and your family right here. The end of your file will simply state that you never made it off the farm. Joey. Daddy! -Whoa! How have they treated you? Okay, I guess. I mean, I didn't know what to expect. Are you hurt? No. So what's going to happen? Who are they? There's one last thing I have to do before we're safe. What did they say? They'll help us if I do something for them. No, they're lying. Don't go! I have to. They're using you. Even if I don't come back, they'll take care of the two of you. You'd better come back. It's time. Let's go. Daddy! Of course they're using me. No different than the mob... Here you go. Thanks. ...and KGB before them. Anewcontract's beentaken out and this time it's an old friend. I made a choice. Vadim escaped his fate and I sealed mine. That's the funny thing about fate. If you don't follow, it will drag you where it wants to go. A foreclosure. A blyadstvo. Areal bad situation. Asuicidegig. No one cares if I walk out, so long as the mark doesn't. Tell Vadim Icarus is back. Icarus! My God! - lcarus! Oh, so long. Come. Please. Best champagne. Only 40 bottles in the world. I have 20. Life is interesting, don't you think? Cigar? I quit. Ah.Oh. It's good to see you. Bring back memories. I agree. You look good. You look... strong. What kind of work have you been doing? Surviving. Mmm. Survival. Hmm. Yes. You married? - Was. - Was. Hmm. So... how many children do you have? I want to guess. You have one children, yes? Yeah. Maybe you have... girl. Abeautiful girl. You name her Taylor. You can't fly that close to the sun and not have your wings melt, Icarus. I saved your life. Yes, and I will take yours. It wasn't my intention to cross you. But you did! You should have stayed with me when I bring you to America! Take him away. Icarus. So where are you gonna kill me? - The desert's a good place. You can kill a lot of men in the desert. Can you get a message to Vadim? What is it? Sir, lcarus. Find out what's going on. Go! Go! Go go go go. Hold it. Go. Look around you. You can't win. You drop your gun. Drop your gun! I'll take that cigar now... if you don't mind. Here. I saved your life. - lcarus! Is he dead? Then this is your lucky day. Mr. Graham sends his regards. What does this say? Hey, who's this guy? Taylor, go to your room. Do I have to? Not again. Not this time. Go pack a bag.
