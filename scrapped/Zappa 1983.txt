 

                        So long, Bjrn. Is that you? What time is it? Now, don't you wake him up. Where've you been? At the youth center. I was playing bumper pool with Mulle. Did you remember to lock the door? Small hops in place. Jump, jump, jump. Watch the beat over there. Okay, clap your hands above your head. Beat, beat, beat. Time to clean up! Line up, quickly. That's right. That's like it. Svend Erik and Johnny, roll up the mat. Brian, collect the stools. Mulle, the springboard. Bjrn and Sten, you take the buck. Everyone else, run in place. Okay, hit the showers. Make it snappy. Make way. Let Mulle show you how it's done. Let me have it.... Turn off the water. Who swiped my underwear? Move. You're sitting on them. Guess who's getting new shoes today! Just watch the dames line up! Okay, come on. Last one out mops the floor. But I can't! I gotta buy new shoes with my mom and dad. Relax, Mulle. I'll mop for you. Nice going, pal. See you. This means two doughnuts and a Danish for Mulle! Sten, couldn't Mulle be in our gang? I mean, we can't accept just anybody. But you know how strong he is. Yeah, but still. On the other hand, somebody has to do the dirty work. An Indian? Imagine Mulle as an Indian! Sten here. You wanna talk to her? It's dad. Dad wants to talk to you. Sten, you know Mom doesn't want to be disturbed while doing her exercises. Could you call... Mulle isn't such a bad idea. Just gotta find him the right job. By the way, can I borrow your homework if you've done it? What's that? Just a little martini,but you don't get any ice. How about the homework? Here, you lazy bastard. Cheers, Bjrn. You could tell Mulle tonight. Ask him to come to the hideout. Sten... Hello, Bjrn. I'm off, Sten. There's food in the fridge. You oughta smile more often, Bjrn Your eyes look so droopy when you're serious. I gotta go.The taxi's here. See you. So...tell Mulle... At seven sharp. Gogge, here! Gogge! - So how do you like 'em? - Like what? The shoes, man! They were damned expensive. Mulle, I talked to... - We're gonna eat in half an hour. - Okay. How about coming in, Bjrn? I wanna show you something. Guess whose birthday it is! -Don't forget your homework. Gogge's two years old. Remember to set the table afterwards. Congratulations, Gogge. Look what I've got for you. You wouldn't think he's two years old, would you? They don't get so old. In a way, he's 50. Here, Gogge my friend. - Mulle, couldn't you... - Now take a look at this. These are the world's biggest boobs. They hang the ladies up in a harness so their boobs stand right out in the air. And then they just turn the picture around. - I'm not interested in that magazine. - Look, here's one who got it shaved. What do you say? I just spoke to Sten... Put that screw magazine away! This is important. Screw? Did you say screw magazine? - Mulle, for Christ's sake! - No, Bjrnie boy! - It's about the gang! - The gang? Shit, it's really hot in here. - Your gang? - Who else's? Couldn't we open a window? You might possibly be able to join. Did Sten say that? Yeah, Sten and I talked about it. You can eat with us. Seven at the hideout. Not five past or five to. At seven, Mulle. Sharp. Okay. - Sometimes Mulle's mom is plastered. - Henning! - No, she isn't. - Yes, she is. - She's just dizzy. - She's dead drunk. Henning, we're eating! She isn't drunk at all, so shut up. Henning is right, you know. But it's not nice to talk about it. They still don't have any rugs over there? Over where? Mulle's place. I don't know. Bella 9528. - Bjrn, it's Sten. - Sten? Who else would call you? Thanks for dinner. Hi. Yes. I talked to him. Of course. Okay. See you. I saw Sten's mom yesterday. How come she's always so tanned? She probably uses a sunlamp. She always greets me so nicely. - Did you see the suit she was wearing? - Who? - I'm leaving. - Sten's mother. Mrs. Bentzon. I gotta go. What time is it? A quarter past seven. It seemed like he got the message. I'm gonna be a cowboy when I grow up. What are you gonna be? - I'm gonna be a zookeeper. - Zookeeper? Bjrn! Bjrn! From now on, you come on time. Got it, Mulle? And don't come screaming like a moron. And don't bring along any pint-sized brats. Think you can remember all that? -Yes. We've got plans for this gang. You understand, Mulle? - My mother knows a lady... - So does my mother. She lives alonein a big house by the marsh. She's going on vacation soon. Probably staying with her sister out in the boonies for a while. The house is real easy to get into. Where is she going? Forget about where she's going! Don't you understand anything? Sure I do. We need a lookout in front of the house. I thought that might be a job for you, Mulle. Don't you think Mulle would make a good lookout, Bjrn? Sure, why not? And the genitals are the organs which, in humans, provide for reproduction through formation and fusion of male and female sex cells. Mulle, how about showing a little maturity? For this to happen, the male must have an erection, which means that blood flows to what are called expansion cells, which make the penis stand up... - And leave! Mulle, I don't want to have to say this again. If you can't handle sex education, you should leave. Besides, it can't be all that interesting or funny to hear about penises and erections. Even the teacher has had an erection. Right, Mr. Christensen? Who's in charge of cleaning up? - Mulle and me. - Okay. You two clean and lock up. Bjrn! You ought to choose your friends with greater care. Honestly, he's not a friend for you, if you want the truth. Think it over, Bjrn. You wanna see my new radio? You got a new one? Spoiled kid. We can play as loud as we want. Nobody's home. Nobody? Uh, I've got... a game at the soccer club. When did you start playing there? A long time ago. We're playing against B93. This afternoon? - Gee, I'd like to see that. - Afraid that's not possible. We're playing away. I don't know where. Somewhere way out in the boonies. I didn't know there were games in the afternoon. No, there usually aren't. They're normally at night. Something to do with one of the linesmen. Okay... see you. Hey, my bag. You're going the wrong way. Shitty bike! You sure nobody's home? Relax, Bjrn the house is ours. Sweet, huh? Look at this. And there's more. Let's split. Relax, Bjrn. We gotta divide up the loot. We've got over 100 smackers. Too bad we only found 30. -30? That only makes ten each. What the hell does Mulle need all that money for anyway? Is somebody there? Come on, the coast is clear. You said nobody was home, man! How was I to know they came home? We only got ten each. Holy cow! Ten whole kroners! Hello, Bjrn. What a night owl you are. So, his lordship made it home. Bjrn, I'm talking to you. - What? - Where have you been? We were just playing ping pong. We lost track of the time. Can I help you? My lord, are you okay? No, there must be something wrong with that potato. Absolutely not. You mean you can do that with all sorts of bottles? Yes, all kinds. - Well, I'll be darned! - Here, try it yourself. - No, no, I couldn't. - Take a look. I can't do that kind of thing. I'm going to bed now. Good night. So, that was that. I think I can say we covered what we were supposed to. At least, most of us did. But you should know that next year... ...you'll have to really pull it together, because the demands will be greater. - Have a nice vacation! - You too, sir. Step right this way. Place your bets. A winner almost every time. - Who's that for? - A grandchild, right? Let's see what you got. That's really nice,and almost the same color too. What have you done with Sten? I didn't think you could live without him. Play "The Cold Shoulder." Okay. And that one. There you are. Like a glider. - Gosh! - A real work of art. Yes, the law of gravity has been suspended. - You used chewing gum. - You think so? No, let me try. - Now watch. Step right this way, ladies and gentlemen. Place your bets. Look at all the fine prizes you can win. Step right this way. Last chance to place your bets. - Number 15 for me. - Number 15. Now let's see who the lucky one is. It's number 15! Take your choice from the top shelf. Yes, you, young man. What would you like? Look, I won a Moroccan cushion. What the hell are you gonna use that for? To put my feet on. If you don't give it to me, I'll come up and get it! - You just stay there. - It's for my mother! Quiet, Mulle. No reason to raise a racket. You don't wanna get kicked out of the gang, do you? I don't think it's fair. I just won it. My mom always wanted one like that, and now you've taken it. Come on, Mulle. Don't start with that. If you really want it so bad... It's my cushion, for Christ's sake! Nope. Right now it's the gang's. But if you eat this... Take a look, Mulle. How can I eat that? You wanna be in the gang, right, Mulle? Shit, man. You want your cushion, right? Be a man. Open your mouth. That's it. Swallow it. The whole thing. Mulle! That's disgusting! Mulle won a Moroccan cushion. Mulle, wait. - What is it? - Where are you going? Bjrn and me are gonna get some ice cream. - I don't give a shit. - Yes, you do, Mulle. Come on. Mulle! You're too much. Mulle, can't you take a little joke? Bjrn! Are you coming, Bjrn? She earns a lot of bread, the candy lady. Even gets to eat all the ice cream she wants. Imagine all that money. Where do you think she hides it? Probably buries it. Every night after closing up shop, she rides home on her bike with all the money. She just needs a little push on her bike. Then the money's ours. Wouldn't it be nice to have a little fun with that money? I was thinking of a little boat trip to Sweden. - How does that sound, Mulle? - A boat to Sweden? Yes, but we need some bread to have fun, right? I'm just taking a little fish food, Dad It's a cinch. Don't you see? Just make her fall off her bike and the money's ours. Who's gonna push her? Mulle, of course. You want to do it yourself? - No, but Mulle... - Stop it. It's just the job for Mulle. Which one shall it be? What are you doing? Looking for the right one. Doesn't it eat ordinary fish food? -Zappa? You must be off your rocker. He needs live food. Good thing I'm not a guppy. Look how still he is. As if he didn't give a shit. Now he's perked up, but it's too late. Zappa . . . Zappa. . . are you hungry? Are you afraid of him? Of who? Zappa. Come on, Zappa. Zappa! You'll have to explain everything to him so we're sure he understands. Me? Yes, you're the best at it. I was just thinking that... it could be dangerous. Relax, Bjrn. You're forgetting one thing. We're in this together. Got it? Sure. Everybody has a part to play. - Is Mulle at home? - Come in. - Come in. Sit down, but be quiet. - I'm going over to see Grandpa. - I'll be back at dinner time. - Okay. Nice, Gogge. One more time. Up on the finger. Come on. I'm not playing with him, if that's what you think. I'm training him to walk across my hand. Mulle... Isn't he silly? Remember what we talked about with Sten? About the candy lady and the trip to Sweden? Have you thought about it? So whaddya say? - She's got feelings too. - Nothing's gonna happen. I just don't like it. All you have to do is bang into her by accident. We'll take care of the rest. But why me? Hell, we're in this together. Everybody has a part to play. Get rid of that cardboard. - Why are we going this way? - Just be quiet. -Hi. -Hi.You're going abroad? Just to Sweden.To all the mosquitoes. My pop has rented a cottage We're going over to buy candy. Cut it out! Of course we had to go this way! Have a nice vacation. Have a nice vacation. Why can't you be quiet, you ape? Cool it or I'll smack you one. Two licorice sticks. Five Zulus. Five Pirates. And a cream puff with coconut. Hold it. You've already spent two kroner and ten re. -Hva s? -Du fr skylde meg tiren. I owe you 10 re already, I think. That's okay. Here. And what do you want? Don't you want anything? He can't be serious. But he said so. Like hell he's got a stomachache! His mom said so too. He's too much. He knew we were gonna have a meeting. Poor Bjrn. Come on! - Where are we going? - Just come on. Jesus, Sten! He loves that bike. He does? So much the better. Kick in the spokes. Kick 'em in, man! Kick it hard, you moron! That's for having a stomachache! Is the tire flat? We can fix it up right away, Bjrn. We've got tools in there. Shall we do it now? The handlebar's no sweat. Can I have a ride, Mulle? That'll be 12.75, please. Don't you have anything smaller? Hurry up. People are waiting. Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fnf. That's not enough, not at all, Bjrn Yes, it is. Then it goes down again. Listen, stop this childish nonsense. Yours doesn't even stand up. - If you get... A real awful one. A real hard-on in the middle of phys ed. Then you count to ten in German. - Don't interrupt. That's not enough. - Then what? Just think of Miss Buddenschn. Imagine the home economics teacher without clothes. Yuk! I bet her ass is blue. Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fnf and Miss Buddenschn. If you two could pull it together, there's two Swedish chicks right over there. One of them's got the biggest boobs in Europe. Where? Don't you know where the boobs are? Oh, the ones in the checkered pants? - Don't talk so loud. - Two Swedish hookers. I bet they've been shaved. I've got some friends. You wanna dance? You're not old enough for that. We're eighteen. You don't even have hair on your dick. No, but I've got a hairy ass. Okay. Three stouts and two soda pops. I knew it right away. You did not. Yes, I did. Mulle, I said. "Those chicks aren't from Sweden. They're from around the corner." Is he always like this? Much worse. You know what we need now? Let's dance, right? Now, don't interrupt, Kate. Okay, what do you need, Mulle? I'd like four doughnuts and two brownies. That's 5.75 It's on Mulle. The ferry will dock momentarily. Thanks. Where's Kate? Which Kate? Come on. Let's find Mulle. See you. Have a nice vacation. You're in here? Please close the door. He's been in there for over an hour. Stinker. Did you say something, Henning? Bjrn, I forgot the sugar. I'll go back to the store. Don't you need money? Four pounds of sugar. - Where're you going? - I'll beat you to the store. Idiot! What would you like? - I haven't decided yet. - Weren't we gonna get some sugar? You keep quiet. I'm the one doing the shopping. Have you decided what you want? A pack of sugar. Is that your little brother? Yes, you might say that. Henning? Let's see who gets home first. I'll give you a 30-second head start. Okay, but you're in for it if you cheat. I'm glad you came back. Yeah, my mom forgot to buy sugar, so... You live here? No, I'm just helping my uncle. My aunt is sick. She's been put in a home.... What's it called? A con... conva... Convalescent home. Convalescent home. Only till she gets well again. Have you been to the chalk quarry? No. No. What's with your pants? Where've you been? Is the elastic broken? It's your own fault the food's cold. That's no answer. - What? - That mumbo-jumbo. What do you want me to say? I'm hitting the sack. Already? We haven't even had our coffee. What would you like? Sten! Sten! Sten, open up, you hear? Aren't you behaving like a baby? If you don't want to lose face in front of the others, then come out immediately. Mom! Please speak louder. There's a bad connection. It's Berit. No, he isn't. Excuse me. Don't mention it. Mom! Sten, come out of there right now. Are you leaving? We're eating in 15 minutes. Wash your face and come down. You want more water, Sten? Berit called half an hour ago. She did? She wanted to speak to you, but you were out. Sten? Berit is the switchboard operatorat the factory. I thought we were here to relax. - That's all we're doing. -And for Sten's sake. My God, I only said that Berit had called. There you go again. I thought... Dad, you're not allowed to smoke in here. You're right. Thanks, Sten. Not too far in the future,machines will take over the dull and tedious work. Then workers must be ready to take over production and manage and distribute the work themselves. Did I take off too much? No. Sit still now. We might be able to visit your aunt and uncle in Silkeborg, and maybe even stay there for a while. Then hold your partner around the waist. Not so hard. Soft but firm. -Like this? -Yes. Now we start on the right. One and side step and together. Back and side step and together. Forward and side step and together and... Bella 9528. Hello, Sten. No, he's out playing soccer, I think. Yes... yes.. Good-bye. - Why don't you want to talk to him? -I gotta go. Take him! Your left leg! And Ole Madsen smashes the ball... ...past the clumsy goalkeeper! Ready? Over here! A header! - What are you doing? - I have to go. Kirsten? Kirsten! Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fnf.... sechs! - Did you fall in? - Yes. Why don't you get out? There might be a fish... Don't you wanna come inside? Well, maybe I could dry my shoes. How's your vacation been? Well, pretty dull. Just reading a lot of books and stuff. Are you really gonna play on the top team? No, not yet. I think you could. I'll treat you to an ice cream later. - The candy lady closed her shop. - Closed her shop? She's in the hospital. They say she fell off her bike. Well, well, Sten. What a surprise. Have a seat. So what's for dinner? Nothing special. Just chops. You couldn't have known, but on Mom's new diet, fats like that are out of the question. Know what we'll do instead? We'll go out for dinner. You can have whatever you want. I'll call a cab. You can wear your new sweater. Taxi? Please send a cab to the Saxroth residence. Thank you. Zappa. A car like that takes a lot of money. - I felt this was the right time. - We'll probably have to get a roof rack while the boys are small. We wanted a four-door. Henning. - What? - Come here. - We could never afford a car like that. - You wanna see? Of course it isn't cheap. Why? Take a look. That's why it was so cheap. There's no engine in it. You have to install pedals. You're full of baloney. I am? Hi. How was your vacation? You look like you've been boozing and screwing for two weeks. You lied about those pedals. This is Folke and Asger, our two new members. That makes five of us. Members? Yes, of the gang, or whatever it's called. Wonder what little Mulle has been up to on his vacation. What a pity. He only wants to play with cars. Come on, Bjrn. - Where did you meet her? - In a country store. - And she wanted to do it all the time? - Over and over. In the chalk quarry, the shop, everywhere. And you did it, you naughty boy! One can't refuse. - Variety is the spice of life. - Yes. Like my dad. He likes to "eat" out too. What does your mother say? My mother? She has nothing to say. Not anymore, at least. I'm gonna get my dad's room when it's fixed up. Has your dad moved out? Sure. Moved in with another lady. Her name is Berit. Anyway, never mind. Cheers, Bjrn. Something tells me we're headed for a busy autumn. Hello, Mrs. Bentzon. I'm Mulle's father. I'd like to talk to you. Come in. I just wanted to talk with you about... It won't take a moment. It's about.... It's about my son's bike. - Your son's bike? - Yes. It was smashed up. - Would you like a drink? - No, thanks. He says Sten has smashed it. Sten? That's what Mulle says. Can he still use the bike? He can't fix it himself, and I don't think that I should... Take it to the bike shop, and then send your son over here with the bill. That wasn't what I meant. - I just wanted to let you know. - I appreciate your coming by. - Well, then, I'll say good-bye. - Good-bye. - No, the other door. - Thanks. He's got some nerve, Mulle boy. Why didn't we go see Uncle and Aunt in the country? Things are pretty good here. That way we save money too. It's better over there. What's wrong, Mulle? Tell me what's wrong. I just wanna get out of here. It'll work out, Mulle. Don't worry. Right? Come on, Mullleman! Let's play ball. Here we go. Come here, Mulle! Watch old Wriggle-legs do his number. Teamwork, Mulle. Over here! What the hell's the big idea? Why don't you play somewhere else? How cute. May I hold it? Is it a he or a she? I don't know. Gogge! Gogge! All right, let's stop now. Thanks for bringing your pets in. Class will be over soon, so please start packing up. Mulle and Bjrn, you clean up. Open the windows. So...... Such good boys. Beat it. You're not supposed to be here during recess. Relax, Mulle. I said beat it! You did? Yes, I did. Up here I'm in charge, get it! Shit! Close the windows! Come here, Gogge. Maybe he's stuck....Gogge! - You let him out! - Me? - I know it was you! - I have no idea where... - You're lying! I can see it I don't know anything about it! Do I, Bjrn? What. . . I don't know. Gogge? Gogge? Move! He's back there! No, Sten! Sten! Mulle! Is it fun? Singing in the choir, I mean. Mulle is crazy. What do you mean? You saw how he went berserk in the hallway. Wasn't that because his bird got killed? - How should I know? -You were there when it happened! I had my back turned. It was between them, anyway. - What are you and Sten up to? -Nothing. You've been so strange lately. - Did you do your math? - You're not gonna copy it. Bjrn, can't you see it's no good? I've had enough. Of what? Of you. It's all over. - Is Mulle home? - I think he's asleep. Already? Yes, it looks like it. That's Berit. Let's go. I say, isn't that Bjrn? Aren't you going to say hello? Do you realize what time it is? Mom.. . . Were you at the youth center? No, we were at Sten's dad. Sten's dad? Yes, he's moved out. Are they divorced? I was there with Sten and some guys called Folke and Asger. I must say, I didn't expect that. That nice man. - Does he live alone now? - Nobody was at home. Too bad. It's always best to call in advance. Will you carry the milk and sugar? I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Mulle, but the way things have developed, you realize we can't have you here in this school. Not only because of what happened in the hallway, but also because your schoolwork has gone downhill recently. Have you discussed this at home? Anyway, Mulle... I think you'll be glad in the long run. Right? Zappa. . Yeah, Zappa! Sten! Sten! - We're going over to the store. We need some booze for New Years. You eat too much mustard! You're coming for New Years, aren't you? It'll just be the four of us. Maybe some of Asger's chicks. A box of matches. Excuse me. - A box of matches. That's a large bill. Don't you have anything smaller? I can't change that. Perhaps my wife's purse... It doesn't matter. I don't need those matches. Don't go over there! This is Berit. Is this Berit? Yes. Who am I speaking with? How are you, Berit? Can't you tell who this is? What's the meaning of this? Yes, hello. Hallo. Is Berit at home? Come on, go in and show it to him. What time is it? Half past ten. -Aren't you drunk yet? -Not yet.. You wanna see a model of your father? I've seen him. Ole's got one too. Are you going to set off fireworks at twelve? Of course. - Can I borrow your sparklers? - What for? - To light them. - In bed? Only one. That's it. One for eleven and one for twelve. I said one. - Bjrn, phone. - Who is it? Who do you think? Tell him I'm not home. On New Year's Eve? Hello? Hello? Where the hell are you, man? We've got guests. Bullshit. You're here in five minutes. - This is a bad time. - We've got lots of booze. We're in this together, right? You can't pull out. Can you, Bjrn? Are Folke and Asger there too? Those idiots went to go get some chicks. Darn, Bjrn. You gotta come. It's no fun without you. - I don't know. - You're coming, got it? We're in this together, Bjrn. You're coming, Bjrn! Hello? Is that you, Sten? - Who did you expect? - Yeah. It's Dad. Some idiot keeps calling and asking for Berit. At one point we thought...it was you. Why would I do a thing like that? Right. Why would you? It was just... Well, I'll hang up now. Happy New Year. Bjrn! Bjrn! Happy New Year! Nice of you to come, Bjrn. Shall I make you a drink? Sten...... What do you say? We've got lots of gin. Sten, I've thought things over. Let's call it quits. You want lime in it? Darn, Sten I'm not into this anymore! Gin and lime it is. You want ice? Asshole! Asshole! Sten! Sten, for Christ's sake! This is crazy! Sten, for Christ's sake I guess I took two. Did you hurt yourself? Are you crying? Why are you crying? You wanna see the fireworks? It's almost twelve.
