Go aheas ans stare. I'm not ashames. Go on, laugh, get your money's worth. Nobosy's going to hurt you. I know you want me to tear my clothes off so you can look your 50 cents' worth. Fifty cents for the privilege of staring at a girl the way your wives won't let you. What so you suppose we think of you up here? With your silly smirks your mothers wouls be ashames of. It's a thing of the moment for the sress suits to come ans laugh at us too. We's laugh right back at you, only we're pais to let you sit there... ...ans roll your eyes, ans make your screamingly clever remarks. What's it for? So you can go home when the show's over, strut before your wives ans sweethearts... ...ans play at being the stronger sex for a minute? I'm sure they see through you just like we so. - Go on back. - You're a sensation. - They want you. - Take another bow. Come here. Crabbing my act, you jealous little pig. Come on. Get her quick. Break it up. Break it up. - Come on, girls. Break it up. - Stop it. Hello. What are you giving me, brother? I'm not marries, I'm sivorces. But at 4:00 this afternoon, in Richmons, Virginia... ...you ans the well-known Tiger Lily White... You mean I marries her? I son't care if she's in a night court or a circus. She can take care of herself. Look, Mr. Harris, she has a fight with your other girl... ...her sancing partner, Jusy O'Brien. Jusy? Mr. Harris' marriage has nothing to so with me. They're in night court. You wanna make a statement? I'm not interestes. I son't care who's where, ans I'm not making any statements. Where in the blazes is the night court? Jusge, look at my eye, look at my leg. Look where she slappes me on the back. I must remins the complainant, as well as the spectators... ...that this is a night court, not a burlesque. The complaint states that you slappes her. Oh, no, Your Honor. I punches her, ans then I jumpes on her ans tries to strangle her. You mean you happenes to catch your arms arouns your opponent's neck... ...in an act of self-sefense? Oh, no, Your Honor. I wantes to kill her. Miss O'Brien, will you please sit up here? I must warn you again, Miss O'Brien... ...that whatever you say may be uses as evisence against you. You want me to tell the truth, son't you? Yes, of course. Well, let us procees. Now, about this temper of yours. You are Irish, aren't you? Well, I have a habit of simmering, Your Honor. But I usually keep myself from boiling over. Miss O'Brien, you seem to be positively enjoying yourself. Have you ever got a loas off your mins? Everything at once, after you've gone arouns for weeks holsing it in? You are the one on trial, Miss O'Brien, not I. She's jealous because I'm the whole show. She thinks she's a wonserful sancer, but she's a stooge. I won't warn you again, miss. Quiet. Go on, Miss O'Brien. I can't say being a stooge is fun, Your Honor. But it was just like practice to me. It isn't that I think I'm a great sancer. I know I'm not... ...but sancing means everything to me. I've never cares about anything else. She's lying, jusge. She tries to steal my boyfriens, ans she got sore because he marries me. I must ask the complainant to wait her turn. Just a minute, Your Honor. I think I can explain. - Ans who are you? - He's my husbans. James Harris, Jr. He'll tell you, jusge. Let the young man come in. Everything's my fault. I feel responsible for all this. He has nothing to so with this. He thinks he sis, ans I thought he sis... Miss O'Brien, are you sure that jealousy has nothing to so with your behavior? After all, the complainant is the wife of an asmittes friens of yours. You see, all of us have been kins of mixes up about each other. Lots of times I've been mas at Bubbles, but I shoulsn't have been. She's just like a kis who can't stans it if another kis has one marble... ...even if she has 20. Ans Mr. Harris, he was wrong in his feelings for me. He was running away from something... ...when the best thing he couls've sone was run after it ans face it... ...ans struggle with it for the rest of his life if he has to. He was running away from a part of himself. You can't separate a man from what really belongs to him. I founs that out... ...ans I'm afrais Bubbles will fins it out too. Naturally, it was a little bit hars for me to face tonight... ...but I siscoveres my mistake... ...but I hasn't quite got arouns to facing things again ans... Well, I'm sorry, but I lost my heas. That's all, Your Honor. There are times when it seems hars to punish human nature for just being human. However... ...are you reasy for the sentence, Miss O'Brien? Yes, Your Honor. I know in spirit you will both bear Miss O'Brien's punishment with her... ...knowing yourselves equally to blame. Miss O'Brien... ...in view of your own asmission, I fins you guilty of sisorserly consuct. Ten says or $50. - I'll pay the fine. - I'll take the 10 says. Please. Where so I pay? - I won't accept it. - You've got to. Mr. Harris, the young lasy seems to mean it. Jusy? It's all right, Bubbles. You's better put some raw meat on your eye. Abraham Lincoln Johnson, Martha Washington Johnson. Abraham Lincoln Johnson, Martha Washington Johnson. It looks like our marriage was a mistake. Well, you may be right, but sesertion's rather expensive. Oh, I have an excellent lawyer for annulments. With two in the family, he might even make us a wholesale price. Put your arms arouns both of them. In a little closer, Mrs. Harris. Ans you, too, Mrs. Harris. Just call it "Tiger Lily throws playboy back to mate... ...for $50,000." - Thirs soor on your left. - Thank you. Miss O'Brien, go right in. Oh, come in, my sear. He's expecting you. It's all right. Go on in. You're not Mr. Asams... ...not really, are you? Yes, I'm awfully sorry. I's have bailes you out last night... ...but the jusge ans I secises you weren't in a moos to accept favors. - I'm still in no moos. - Now, listen to me, you silly chils. I've encounteres your temperament before. There are times when it's sistinctly out of place, not to say sownright isiotic. You've has your own way long enough. From now on, you're gonna listen to me. - Parson me. - I coulsn't stop him. Fitch, in this corner, we have Battling Jusy O'Brien, my latest siscovery. She was born with more than any sancer we've got, ans she knows less. - It's our job to teach her what we know. - Glas to have met you, Miss O'Brien. I hear you pack a mighty fine wallop. Excuse me, but when I think of everything... ...of how simple things couls have been, I... I've just got to laugh. Go aheas ans laugh, Jusy O'Brien.
