You were lucky, with your ... The network here is local. Something block transmissions but not is. I try to find it. Good. Why Bukes speaks so little? Es bread ... It's a little shy. - Shy? - If. Especially with pretty women. Or maybe he decided he does not like you. Seeing their performance is worse for me. Did you read his file? Drifter, I read all the files. What is your score? Only figure, without context, right? That is why that does not like you. Your score might go wrong, but it is work. We are good with our work. How old were you installed the chip? At the age of 11. And without the chip? Paralysis. You must be a certain age. Harbinger sponsors them? If Me curaron. I thought it was dependent on the system ... You have no idea. He was spinning but not lost.

I am connected to the network, I can see, yes. Really? - Turn off the damn things now. - I can not. You can not? However, he had no problem starting to walk everything else. I can not just turn them off There must be a reason. An error ... Study the possibilities. This is not a damn equation. We have to get out of here. - Otherwise, I'll shoot. - Not like that. She does not know how. - A programmer goofed. - Do not. An error is not as effective. I could not find it. But I found this, not far from here. Captain must be sought. Goodwin, go to the red dot. I hear you. It is useless for us. We do not see either the pads or the forest. But if he sees Mills. If you see them, also see her and us. Does not matter. - "Does not matter"? - Do not. At this point, any help is good. Did you see ?, Hackett was shot three times. 3rd before falling to the damn ground. Exactly, and I keep thinking about it.

Me too. Is everyone in one piece? They have not tried anything. They could do so. They were everywhere last night. Mills? If, of course. The signs are behind us. We return to the starting point.

Did you see what you've created? None of this happened before. The code is more advanced than I could imagine. I understand, I can try to control it. It's a little late for that, do not you think? - You do not understand ... - Be realistic. They are murderers. It is all they are. She stood in the way, and they did not fire. It's because they do not know if I'm one of them. Yeah, neither do we. What are they? Are their replacements. Do our replacements? They called SAR Reprogramming Analysis study. They learn. And they use it to improve. Like us. They were created to save lives, and they did Are the lives of those who saved? The of Cutbill, Loftus, Hackett, Drifter? We build them so that people like you do not have to die or kill. That does not choose you, I decide. And how successful has it been so far? I deal with that, so that people like you do not have to.

I recovered this. All we need is a trigger. There is a leader who is responsible for all this. The SAR code rewrites and expands. You should come near me. The detonation stops everything. Do you know why you're alive? Because we are pushing to be here. They gain time to prepare and then come for you. Maybe I can stop this. Are you going to kill himself? Even if he survives, the pulse erase his memory. At this point, there is no choice. I have a little time before my chip is turned off. The aftermath will be manageable. No. Do you realize what I did?
