 

                        THE KARAJAN MOB Please! Give me one week. I'll get you the money. Just because our guys work here undeclared, do you think you can fuck with us. You will pay us. You will pay what you owe us. Today. You swine... - Got the colors right in the end? - Yes, I think so. I'm satisfied. - But I don't know about the building. - No, that's true. - Shall we go? - He said he'd meet us out here. I don't really know where we're going. - He's not answering. - Typical rjan. Oops! Late to the party again. Work, work, work. - Hello. - Hello. Shall we go and see the apartment, then? No more pictures, please. We must move on. The district court has been asked to extend the detention of the accused. However, the court sees no evidence... that Zanko Zajkov would interfere with the upcoming trial... and therefore, is free to go. Order in the court! Order! You can move in, in two months, if you like. God, it's so nice! Look around a little, I'll make a quick call. That was two days of my life I'll never get back. "As a manager you must have clear goals and find joy in what you do." I get the message. That's enough, thank you. - What's he doing now? - Talking to himself, I think. What do you need me for? On the one hand, you don't give me... ...the responsibility I deserve. Then you send me on useless management courses. What a fucking joke. Why the hell don't you send Johan? It might be good for him to attend a management course. Call the instructor and tell him that he needs a management course. - Embarrassing. - Yes, poor bastard. May I? - So this is where they are buried? - Yes. It's almost 25 years ago. Lucky for the taxpayers that he became a cop. - Car Accident, huh? - She was 19 and pregnant. She was due that week. If he ever finds the driver he'll forget the law and go straight to the Old Testament. - That explains a lot. - Undoubtedly. - Where the hell is he now? - No idea. Some fucking watchers. Huh? Poor citizens. - Why hasn't the invoice been paid? - The accounts lady is on vacation. Some bastard at city hall must able to take care of it. Call them. That's how it works with local government. Why so stressed? - We're not in arrears. - We need to have some cash flow now. Call and push them a little. - It looks expensive. What's the rent? - I've paid for three months. Have you? And then what? - Forty-seven hundred. - Oh, that's good! But the location and size. The bastard is three months late. He never learns. I'll cut his throat. He said today, so we'll wait until tonight. All we do is wait. - Thanks, rjan. - "Pappa" Well, I must go now. Bye, Honey. Damn it all, what idiots. We've lost two days. We're surrounded by fools. I don't want any more trouble. That applies to you too. You are in charge of Scandinavia. You must be completely clean. They broke a guy's leg over a payment. When they were questioned, they fingered me. They won't talk again. Good. Tell me how things are now. It's best in Sweden. Construction is in full swing. A stadium in Stockholm, a housing complex in Gteborg. Both projects in cooperation with Swedish municipalities. Swedish municipalities. Brilliant! Hey, look what my daughter has made. - Manja? - Manja. - Keep it as a talisman. - Thank you. How is the whore business? New girls on the way to Stockholm Gteborg and Norrland. We should have waited. We need to lie low for a while now. Especially with what we have going on now. - Business must go on as usual. - That's what I want. Business. Business. No more crap like that. It's not profitable. How about a bite? A little Thai food? I'll just take care of something first. Shit! "Withdrawal: 5,000 kronor" - Thanks for the ride. - See you on Monday. Cheers! - Hello. - Hello. - Was it a good course? - Oh yes, very entertaining. Was it that bad? Nina sent pictures of the apartment. How could rjan arrange that rent? - Let him help out. It's good for Nina... - Yes, that's good. Yes. Aside from that, I need to ask you something. What is it? What is it? What are you thinking about? - You've gone quiet. - Where's Ola? He... You were getting him. Oh... Damn! - What did you think of the apartment? - It's perfect. I just don't know if I can afford it. With studying and such. Don't worry about it. It'll sort itself out, it's cool. - What are you doing? - Just tidying up a bit. So... What do you know about what happened between your mother and me? You went off to work. First in the U. S., then in Saudi Arabia. That's not the reason it broke up between your mother and me. Tell me your mom's version, I'll tell my mine later. I don't really know mother's version. She took me along when she was working in Europe, The Hague and such. That was after we separated. Should I have taken you? From your mother? Would you have liked that? Everything that happened was very stupid and very immature. Your mother's job meant as much to her as mine to me. She had started her advertising agency and I had my job in Saudi. And then we lost contact. Then work was still your priority ahead of me. Can I just take this first? - Do you have money? - Are you nuts? It's a Yes or No question. Do you have money? I have 42 thousand. One can only take out 10 thousand a day, so you'll have to wait 'til tomorrow. On Monday you will have the full 480,000, right? Yes. It won't pay the workers. I know. - 42,000 is not even enough for them. - I know it! I'll show that bastard. Sign it and the apartment is yours. But, I haven't decided yet. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Now I want you to have the apartment. It's yours. Okay? Can you go upstairs? Just go up. Listen to me... Hurry up! Hey, I need to talk to you. That's the last time you look me up without calling first. What did you want to talk about? I going to lose my house. It's tough. Especially for my daughter. I have her every two weeks. We have to stay somewhere. Should I arrange an apartment for you? Given what our cooperation cost me and gave you, yes. I want the police to help me with some accommodation. Oh. That's all you're getting. Hey! You wanted to talk. Yes, I want you to help me with something. Check with your contacts on the street and in the jails. - What's it about? - I can't give you all the details now. When do you ever? You wouldn't understand if I did. Tell me, and we'll see. You won at last. Huh? I'm sorry. I completely forgot. But you... you were only there fifteen minutes. I'll just head over here. Hey. - Hello. How did it go? - They won, but... I think... Let him be. He'll get over it. Hey? Yes. What were you saying before? What was it? Huh? What do you want to say... Oh, God...! rjan, can I call you back in five minutes... She hasn't been heard from all afternoon? - She left. - Did you have a fight? Maybe I said something, I don't know. - How long has she been gone? - Since we looked at the apartment. - Have you called her? - Yes, but her phone is off. - Have you talked to her boyfriend, Bill? - No, I didn't think of it. I called you first. I'll hang up and call Bill. Bye. - Take it easy. It's only been a few hours? - You didn't hear rjan's voice. - Bill here. - Hi, Bill. Have you talked to Nina today? No, she was going to call me after she saw the apartment, but it was... - She's with her dad. - No, she left there. I'm a bit concerned. Can you come and sit with Ola for a while? - Absolutely. - Super! Bye. What didn't I hear in rjan's voice? Come on. Why don't you call when you hear this. We wonder where you are. Kiss, kiss. Hey. - rjan? - Kitchen! - Did she say where she was going? - No, she just left. She hasn't called him. Surely she would have called. - It's damn strange. - Yes. I can't answer now, but tell me who it is. Bye. Hello, Nina. It's Mamma again. Call as soon as you hear this. We're wondering where you are. We're with rjan now and we're looking for you. We're worried. Ring. Please let me know as soon as you can. Bye. Cheers. Nice house. - Did you build it yourself? - Yes. The patio door up there... What happened to it? - Some young brats... - When did it happen? - During the week. - Thanks. - What day? - Monday. Thanks. Nina doesn't usually do this. She always calls. - What should we do then? - Tell me what happened. I just did. Can we look at the hard drive of the camera at the entrance? Sure. There's nothing to look at though. I erased the hard drive. When nothing happens, I wipe the whole disk. - Okay. - Every day, yes. What did you fight about, exactly? I don't know. Maybe she was upset when I talked about our divorce 15 years ago... Come on, let's go. - Now? - Let's go. Bye. What's going on? He acted really strange. - Something's not right. - Yes. He's lying about what happened. The hard drive erased, a pane in the patio door replaced, rental car. - I'll see you Monday. - Will do. Thanks. - Who was that? - Just a guy from work. - I'll be back. - What are you doing? What are you doing? We need to report her missing. It's not illegal to go away. If we report her missing they won't do anything yet anyway. - What's he doing? - I don't know. Keep an eye on him; I'll take a look. - He seemed to be hiding his face. - Mm. Why? Because he's withdrawing someone else's money, maybe. - Was he using Nina's card? - I don't know. That's his building. - Nina's getting an apartment here. - We'll see to it. Are those his men? He has a contract with the city. And he sub-contracts the jobs. Wait here. Twenty thousand. Plus the 42k you took, and my car. It is worth 200k, at least. For us, it's maybe worth 75,000. So we need 343k more. Please, can you listen... No, you listen. Hey! You there! - You. No civilians. - Okay, sorry. Wrong way. Pyotr! Tell the boys they have to work overtime... ...two hours each day, tomorrow and Sunday. The municipality is late with the wages. The weekly pay will here on Monday. Everyone will get a generous bonus for the weekend work. - For both shifts. - Okay. Do you recognize her? Look closely. Never seen her before. rjan left. - We have him on the GPS. - What did they do? There's an issue between them, money or some other shit. What will you do? No! Johan, where are you going? Are you completely stupid? You don't need a worm if you're using a fly. - Why not? - You don't need a worm for fly-fishing. That's the bait. You don't need anything else. - Patrick here. - Can you check a few plate numbers? I'm off work and so are you. What's going on? I think something's happened to Nina. She's gone. Can you check the plates? They're Swedish and Estonian. Check all the registers - now! Send the details. What the hell...! I know whose cards he used to take out the money. He took them when we were at his house. My personal cards, company card... - What about the PIN numbers? - I've always used Nina's birthdate. It was he who called you, right? Fucking bitch! There are 9, 227 cakes in circulation right now all over Europe. This is Herman. Sourdough cake. We'll take care of Herman for ten days. Then we send him on his way. He must never stop bubbling. - What if he stops bubbling? - Then he dies. Are you in? - I'm in. - Niklas and Vidar? My office. Now, thanks. Close the door. For your information, then: Johan will proceed with his investigation... You've reached Nina. I can't answer now, but... This is Vidar and Niklas. They've been briefed. We'll check the cars Johan photographed outside the building. Then I'll write up your complaint. So Johan isn't mentioned. There isn't much to go on. But the theft was serious enough for a search warrant. We'll find her. Hey. Take the surveillance camera's hard drive as well? The warrant only applies to financial records. After the weekend, we'll have pictures of you at the ATM in the cap and hoodie. You know there are two cameras? The one you hid your face from and another one at the side. And a witness observed you making the withdrawal. How should I interpret your silence? rjan invokes his right not to answer the question. Yes, so it seems. Hell. What the hell? - Still more? - It's crazy. One of the Swedish-registered cars from the building site was found in Aspen. A Customs narcotics dog reacted when it drove on the ferry to Estonia. Customs found nothing. There could have been dope in the car earlier. All the Swedish-registered vehicles, even the one the dog marked... ...are from the same company: MM Cars in Gteborg. They have been reported stolen 16 times the last five years. Seventeen. There was one more. It's fucking sick. They were found a few days later in Tallinn. Full and clean, with the key in. The company is owned by an Estonian: Madis Mgi... MM Cars. No one we know, but dope, Estonia... It sounds familiar. Put a flag on the company so we can see when the cars cross the border again. Shall I attach your number? No, mine. With the connection between the building and MM we'll check out Madis Mgi. Now. Do it, Niklas. - Hi, Johan. - Sorry to bother you. - Hello. - Come in. Patrick just called. I can recover the deleted files. But what will you do with them if the disk is not included in the warrant? We'll see. Go ahead. We're getting nowhere. If you call it grand larceny, we'll never find Nina. Yes, but we can't reduce the charge. There's no evidence of another suspect. Then may I talk with him. Huh? - Wait. - What? Usually, I go to the prosecutor and may detain him, but he can be released. - What? - We can always seize him again. Will he go out the front door? If he says anything to you, we'll note it and it can be used as evidence. It has a large memory, so it may take some time. Now let's take a walk. Look at the top one. It's not about us. It's for Nina's sake. What's happened? I don't care about the money. I'll stroke a line through everything. Just tell me what happened. I can see you know what's happened. Tell me what it is. I know you're not a bad man, rjan, but... You must tell me, please! Hey. Back a little. Stop. Go forward a little bit. Stop. Back a bit again. Stop. No problem, you'll get your share at the site, first thing on Monday. Sure, but no details on the phone. See you tomorrow morning. - Then we'll go over everything. - Okay, boss. - Was that Zanko? - He's landed at Landvetter. - What's he doing here? - He has orders from Andrei. - Andrei? - He wants us to lie low for a while. Did he tell you how to get firms to pay for illegal workers? Should we ask the bailiff to collect for us maybe? What do we do with her? Didn't you tell him? Are you crazy? We'll tell him tomorrow. We'll use her as we thought. - What a fucking mess. - Yes. I have to take care of the workers. Remember what I said. You make one little sound... ...and we will hurt your father, really bad. You've worked with with Estonians and others from Eastern Europe. I don't know what the Russians and the Estonians are doing now. - It was a gamble. - Your daughter? - Frank? - Wait a minute. We're settled here. I'm going to Gteborg and empty the apartment. I'll be in Gteborg by two or three tomorrow. Can I help... By three, it'll be over. - Okay. - Okay. We have until Monday to pay the ransom. Major Crimes is forming a team to exchange Nina. Here are pictures from the kidnapping. There were two, one of them is a woman. - Supervisor of rjan's construction. - She's called Kaie Saar. - rjan told me. - Lithuanian, former KGB. The man is Stefano Heldna, Ukrainian. Both residents of Estonia... ...without citizenship. Passport photos are coming. Does rjan have phone numbers and addresses for them? We traced the numbers. They're only used at the building site, sometimes in town. The phones are off so much, they must have other ones. Kaie Saar has learned a thing or two from the KGB. Send a personal leave form to my mobile. - What for? - Check surveillance camera. As a relative, you can not work on this. The rules are clear on that point. Fuck the rules. You think you can stop him? I'll disappear for a while. I'll put you down for vacation on the work schedule. You have the time and I don't care what you do after hours. Okay? - I'll come to the office later. - You can help me better where you are. I talked to Lisa. He doesn't know any more about the Estonians... ...than he told me three years ago. But Seth can keep an eye on them. Here he comes now. And you... Well... Have you arranged accommodation for me yet? Why don't you find something yourself? I want to live in a quiet neighbourhood without a lot of muss and fuss. - Be a little more specific. - Okay. Rdjursgatan 33, a townhouse. There are 30 other townhouses in that area. It's quiet there. Two other options are... ...Skogsvgen 20, and Jupiterstigen 4. They're all in north-west Hisingen. It's quiet there. Quiet? Why are you worried about quiet? Do people driving scooters in the mornings disturb you? No, something else bothers me. Do you know there are 4,000 pedophiles in town? 8,000 if you count the suburbs. Pure Mathematics. 1% of the adult population have pedophile leanings. You should check out anyone... ...suspected or convicted of pedophilia living near those addresses. What do you mean by "near"? It depends on the degree of risk from the person, right? You and I are in the same boat. We both have daughters. We love them more than anything on earth and want to protect them. If they're Estonian Russians doing construction in Sweden, it's Karajan. The Russian Mafia are in Estonia. Dope, amphetamine is their thing. Construction is a front to get their men here legitimately. I want to know who the principals are. How would you contact them? I wouldn't contact them, because I don't deal with drugs. My colleague's daughter has probably been kidnapped by Karajan. Call me in an hour if you have anything I can use. - Then I'll help you with those addresses. - Fair enough. But don't expect too much. We're going to find our colleague's abducted daughter, Nina Andersson. Surveillance and GSI will watch the area around the building. You can see pictures of the area and photos of the suspected kidnappers. Stefano is leaving the site in a white Mazda pickup. Plate number: Kalle Emil Adam 094. Two other cars are with him. And 98-13 is joining the crowd. Kaie Saar is the prime suspect. She has a construction company in Estonia... ...and is a sub-contractor for several Swedish companies. Kaie Saar's accomplice is Stefano Heldna... a board member of the same company. Pictures of Nina Andersson are here. We may pay a ransom and make an exchange with the kidnappers. Come. I want to talk to you. What the hell are they doing now? Surveillance will follow the suspects for a lead to Nina Andersson. Questions? Hello? - It's fine. - Do you hear me? - Should I... - It's fine. Here we go. I have a special price for you this weekend. one hour at the construction site. Not two, as normal. - It's a good deal for you, yes? - Yes! Okay, let's have some fun. Okay, who's next? Who's next? You? I'm sorry... - Yeah? - I've got the money. I have to take it. Already? Good. The full amount? Okay, I will give you instructions when to meet, in two hours. - She's alright? - Yeah, no problem. I want to talk to her. Hello? - No. - But how can I know that she's alright...? - You don't until I get the money. - Why? - So we're meeting at the Avenue. - Yes, at the Avenue, I'll meet you there. - Wait. - You fucking rapist! Hello? Hello? Hello! trying to break his neck. Should we intervene? Go, go, go, go! Police! Area C. Ongoing assault... ...between the bunkhouse and a caravan. A dozen men. Construction workers. Where's the girl? Where is she? Where is she? - Giorgi, help me! - Where's the girl? Police! Hold it! Police! Stop! It, uh... Cut off. I know it's my fault. One arrested, one injured. A suspect ran into the woods. 185 cms, dark blond. You bastards... The police raided the building site in Gteborg. - Stefano was there. - Why did they raid it? I'll dispose of this issue, but we need to talk. - The apartment, about 20 minutes. - Okay. Hey, Tage. What's happening? Where are they? Stefano Heldna is in jail. Alleged rape also. - Rape? - In the caravan. - Patrick, it's Niklas. - I'm here. Your gut feeling wasn't wrong. You were right about the car rental. It's been dark all night. Ten minutes after the raid, the place lit up. Madis Mgi is on his way out. - Follow him. Vidar is coming to help. - My pleasure, sir. Hey. Was the girl you sent away in the ambulance a prostitute? Yes. It seems the workers have been spending their wages on sex... which has been much appreciated. One guy tried to sodomize her, and then it all went crazy. - Where are you? - What nationality is she? Russian. Why? Johan? I'm here, Niklas. South side. Okay, the suspect has parked his car and is waiting for the tram. A bit unusual. He's talking to the air. He must have a hands-free. - Did you feed Herman? - Damn, I thought you did. It was a bad idea to adopt the dough with you. Of course I fed him. Little Herman is full and satisfied. Who's he talking to? What the hell...? My cars have been seized. I rented eight cars to the construction company. I'd rather not lose them. We don't know anything yet. We also have a car on the way from Tallinn. We must be cautious. - What do we do? - Follow the car dealer. The entire building, apartments, bunkhouse and other areas were searched. No Nina Andersson. No Kaie Saar. Hello, Cecilia here, Security at the Swedish Embassy in Estonia. A car that you requested tracking on: A Swedish BMW sedan, JHB 490. I just heard from Customs in Tallinn. a ferry to Stockholm. On a car transporter with three other cars without tracking codes. Have you heard from Customs in Vrtahamnen? The ferry has just arrived. What is it? Why the hell didn't you say anything before? You always say you can't talk about important things on your phone. When you called we had already taken her. Her father had begun to pay. Shut up! - I am surrounded by fools. - What? We'll solve this. My buddy worked for Estonian builders last winter. It wasn't great, he said. They were greedy and paid with products. - Products? - Amphetamines and Russian whores. One gram of dope for a working hour. It usually sells for 200 kronor. billed as two hours of work. Decent wages for an Easterner, but the construction company gets most of it. They avoid taxes and fees, and the money goes to the guys at the top. Isn't that good info? I wanted to know who the principals are in Gteborg and how to contact them. The talk is the suburban gangs will drop the price on amphetamine next week. So a big shipment is coming in. Spy on them and you'll find the Estonians. And you eliminate the competition. I just want a safe life for me and my daughter, as I said. I'll help you with it. Appreciate it. Hello, this is Irena. I'm not available right now... - Hello? - Hey. This is Jonas. Are you free? Can you speak English so I understand? I'm Jonas. Are you free? Yes. Can you come now? - Yes. How much? - It's 2,000 kronor. Special is extra. If you want extra girl, then 3,000 kronor. Okay, two girls. You go to Jakobsdalsgatan, and you call me when you get there. After the raid, the car rental owner... ...rushed off to a meeting in the middle of the night. We believe a large batch of amphetamines is entering Sweden. The construction firm is part of the enterprise. We haven't seen the top layer. If we can provoke them where hurts most, we may find Nina. Okay. Do it. But be damn careful. We will need your help. - If the lawyer needs something... - I know, I know. I haven't told them anything. Good. Who did that to you? The police? I don't know. Some crazy person... ...asked for the girl, took my wallet, my mobile phone. He stole it. As your lawyer, I need to ask you this... Did you kidnap the girl? Uh... Yes. - Is she alive? - When I last saw her, yes. The girl is the stepdaughter to a cop. That's why half the police force raided the construction site. Oh, no... Holy shit, I'm fucked. I'm so fucked. Stefano Heldnas's mobile. Swedish subscription, prepaid. Check all the places he's been. Check who he called. Ping them so we can follow them in real time. I'll roust my telco contacts. How did you get the phone? Just get them. No, he hasn't told them anything. They're looking for Kaie. Yes. They know nothing about you. Just let the girl go and let Kaie take the blame. I'll call you back and tell how I decide. Well, my advice is to disappear. Leave the country. - Yes, that I will. - Good. Bye. Do this... Stage a drowning accident. Drop the girl in a lake. You said Andrei wanted us to be a bit cautious... He said we shouldn't do anything stupid. We need to think about business. The police are going to find this girl. She will tell them everything. Set fire to the apartment and leave the country. I see. We need Andrei's approval. She's a cop's stepdaughter. Oh my God. Slightly more complicated than a carpenter's daughter. The phones have been used all over town. But they've all been used for long periods at the construction site. Hello. This is Jonas again. Where am I supposed to go? Okay, you go to Jacob Dalsgatan 140. The entry code is the 7382, and you go up to the first floor. I open the door. - Hi... - Hello. Want to come inside? No! Please! No! In here! Do you have a cell phone? - Open the door! - No, I'm not doing anything for you now! Pappa bought a ring. - Hello? - Has he left the apartment? - No. - No? It's okay. - Look here. - Hey, you drunk! Party's over. - Get up. - Come on! - Come on now. - Get him up. We gotta go. Down! Down on the floor! Where is Kaie Saar? Where is Kaie Saar? Let him go, you fucking drunk! You fucking bastard! What do you want? Do you know who you're dealing with? Do you know who I am? Do you know who you're dealing with? Matte, help me out here. Can you get hold of a blue light? We have a problem. - Are you taking the kids to daycare and school? - Absolutely. I'll go swimming with them later. We have a problem. Darling, can I take a raincheck on that? I have to work. "Suspected Pedophiles" Niklas and Vidar are going out on E4 to meet the car transporter. What are you doing? Oh, just something a little different. You know... Your info about the suburban gangs expecting a big supply of amphetamines... - Where did it come from? - Um... Hjrdis. If it all goes to hell... ...and backfires as it almost did with Seth Rydell last time... Let me finish. You won't even head the lost property department. Do you know why I didn't want you to recruit Seth Rydell? I'm thinking of quitting. Then you will apply for the position of head of GSI. - What? - You're made for it. Calm, strong, creative. A little feisty. Well... May I ask what you'll do? Yes, you can ask. But you'll get no answer. Now we must attend to the operation. Niklas and Vidar will make contact soon. So, Vidar, on with rags. The white-green Scania is coming. Hello there. Is it coffee break or was I driving too fast? Turn off the engine and come with me. Yes, okay. Has anything in particular happened? Over there? - Know anything about sourdough bread? - Sourdough bread? Tell me about Herman's sourdough bread? I know nothing about sourdough bread. We have bingo, jackpot, bull's-eye, a sure thing. We have ten bags here. - I'll get started. - We'll call your boss. - My boss? - The CEO at Gota insurance. Are some of my drivers involved in drug smuggling? No, no. The fact is that like you, they are completely unaware of it. Just a moment. Sthlgren. One moment. Here. Talk to your driver. Well... Hakansson here. No, do as he says. If he says he can drive one of those vehicles, we'll depend on it. They didn't try to hide the shit. Then each blames the other if customs or the police find it. So no one can be prosecuted. Let me go. I don't know anything. Your daughters, maybe five and ten. I have a daughter. An eye for an eye. I'm a police officer and I'm going to kill you on your own burial ground. During the last ten years we have found 30 bodies there, all impossible to unidentify. Or you can just give me information I want and I'll let you go. I do not know where Kaie is! I told you! - Where is the girl? - I do not know. I don't know anything kidnapping. Jesus! What you have behind you is a tank with so much pollution... ...it can tear your skin off in seconds. When it gets to the lungs, it's like acid burning from the inside out. What girl? I know nothing! I don't know what you're talking about! - Last chance! - I only take care of... - What? - When exactly did Kaie call you? She called me two hours ago. - Two hours? - No, no, it was one and a half. One and a half... Is this the number? Yes, it is her new number. "Private Mlndal Angling Club" Matte, it's me. A new number. Check where this cell phone is right now. - 070-7100775 - Okay. I just heard from Tallinn. They approve the idea of the lake. Do it. Right now. Dump the weapons and set fire to the documents and the apartment. Okay. We have visitors. Zabangidas new leaders Johnny Ahmad and his buddy Tony. You want to bet they're getting product to sell in Grdsten? - You're early. Do you want coffee? - We want to get started. The goods will at any moment. Come on. Vidar, ignore the traffic rules and get here as fast as you can. Breaker, breaker. Bandit One is the man! Sophie, for fuck's sake, where are you? Here are all the pedophiles in north-west Hisingen. Good luck with the move. - You should have been here an hour ago. - Did you wake up on the wrong side? There isn't a truck driver faster than me. - Unload the car. - Yes, yes, yes. - 10 in place. - Good. Do you see anything from there? I'm blocked off. This year, 138,000 people were convicted for crimes in Sweden. Now we have another one. How many convictions led to jail time? last year's statistics. You know your diagnosis, don't you? Savant syndrome. I take it as a compliment, my friend. Matte, a hit. The cell phone has been in the same area all night. It's in Klippan. - Do you need backup? - GSI? - All out on surveillance. SWAT? - Okay, SWAT is good. What the hell is this? I don't know. It's the first time it's happened. Try another bag. I'll test it with my stuff. Yes... It's not pure. It's only five or ten percent. I'll take care of it. Next time you'll get a good deal. Ahmad and Tony are leaving. They're pissed. How much did you dilute it? - 95 Percent. It's not strong shit. - No wonder they're pissed off. - The stuff in the car. It's crap. - Crap? What do you mean? It wasn't pure. There's a traitor somewhere. We need to talk. See you at our usual cafe. - About 20 minutes. - Okay. stay back so you won't be recognized. Understood. I'll stay away. Hey. I'm a policeman. - Have you seen her? - No. - Nothing that seemed unusual? - No. Help! Help! Get back! Get back! Away, away! Help! Help! Help! Move over! Move! Police! Down! Where?! The screams came from up there! Nina! Nina! Nina! Nin... - Here you go. - Thank you. Here you are. The subject is at Caf Ritazza. - The place is crowded. - Is he talking to someone? He's talking, I can't see who it is. Nina! No, no, no. No, no, no, no. No. Nin... No. No, no, no! Damn... No, no, no! Nina! Nina! Nina! No, no! Come on! If the goods are not okay, then the cops must be onto us. No, that can't be true. Why would the police dilute the product? Why not put in a tracker or substitute sugar? Dilution suggests it's betrayal. Yes, sounds likely. Are they gone? Mm. They're gone. Did you get them all? Mm, both of them. Three. There were three of them. Three? Vidar, go in. I want to see who he's talking to. If it is in fact the police... ...and we're the target... ...then they're looking at us right now. It's probably best to get out. We should split up. - Close down completely? - What? Why are you in such a hurry? We can't solve it here and now. Can't we? Who knew about the car? Me and you. Who else? Who else? You don't need to know. - I'm just wondering. - No one here anyway. Just Andrej's people in Estonia. That's why I have to go there. I'll take the ferry from Stockholm. - A tall blonde, right? - No... Did he have a name? - Za... Zanko, I think. - Zanko. What did he look like? Short dark hair, slim. We'll talk when I get to Tallinn. All right. - The subject is leaving. - I'm on him. Latest update? Kroon here. It's Johan. There were three kidnappers, not two. Slender, short dark hair. - Za... Zanko, I think. - Zanko. Slender, dark-haired, short hair. Black leather jacket. Unshaven. "Take control of your life" Sthlgren has sent a picture of a Zanko. - He's one of those who took Nina. - Vidar is on him. I'm on the way. He's heading for the toilets. Vidar, observe. Don't do anything 'til Sophie gets there. Does anyone see any reason why we can't grab both of them in 20 seconds? Excellent. Then we'll take them. - Hey, Madis! Police, stand still. - Police. Lie down. We lost him in the garage. - Police! - He ran... He's going up the stairs. I'm going. Take over. Police! Zanko's coming down in an elevator. Police! Get down! I just want to tell you we picked up Zanko. Thought you might want to know. Thanks. It's over now. We got all three. Police! Here. Medic! You've been a good lawyer; But our business is over. Sweden is closed. Before I send you the last invoice... .. I thought you might like to see this. All cases, including what just happened Gothenburg... ...is related to one specific police officer. Johan Falk. The girl's stepfather. Johan Falk? Interesting character. He's no longer bubbling. - Did you feed him this morning? - Yes, absolutely. Did you add lots of sugar? Sugar? - Now you have the prince. - Okay. What the hell...! One moment. Hello? It's me. I just wanted to know how the move is going... - Sophie? We should... - Which house was it? I came into some money from elsewhere. So I'm keeping the house for a while. - Sophie? - But... thanks anyway. You know it's for my daughter's sake, right? Now I have to go. See you. Shall we? It's Monday, damn it, come on. What was that about...? A bitch who bugs me. I get crazy. - 200,000 Danish, now 240,000 Swedish. - Come, come, come! That was quick. Oy, oy, oy. Lovely! Half for you, brother. You have as much debt as I do? Yes. Maybe we can do it again? I don't think so. It only works once. How did you find out? We only knew it was in north-west Hisingen. Magic. I don't want to be a cynical bastard, but it costs 30,000 for such a project. - 30,000? - 31, 230... plus or minus. This could be put to better use, if they're going to kill each other. Take this player... Thomas Langgaard, a Dane. The one they wiped out in north Hisingen. - Langgaard? The pedophile? - Exactly. - He was jailed for it in Sweden, right? - Exactly. He got on the wrong side of the biker gangs. They put a price on his head. Know how they found him? It's karma. He had a secret address and identity. Out of the blue, a neighbour spotted him and saw a way to make a buck. Boom. Cut his throat. Do you know who did it? Two fucking idiots who were arrested on the spot. to become biker gang members. That's what I mean. Pedophile? Karma. How is it going? Well... - Ola, you take it. - Nina? Nina? Post. Thank you. "The rent is paid up for 6 months. Hugs and forgive me - rjan" - What was that? - Nothing. Hey. It takes time. Someone said you had a present for me. Really? What do you say? Maybe.
