Head up, Casey, watch the audience not your feet. Now, on the beat. Perfect. Head direction, girls. Stay together. Clean fifth. - Tight angles, girls. Be precise. - Two and three and four. KRISTYN, DILLON & NATASHA: And two and two and three and four. I can't believe I remember every single move of this dance. You did it, like, six years in a row or something, right? Seven. Dillon. Okay, you are hereby ordered to stop growing. Your sleeves fit you last week. TARA: Shh! - DILLON: Since when are you the shush-monster? - I'm sorry, guys. I don't wanna be a downer but I have three solos to think about. So can we have some focus, please? STAGE MANAGER: Dillon, Tara, you're up next. Let's go. She's got three solos? [MUSIC STOPS] It's close, girls, but continue to practise downstairs with Madame Marguerite. You need to focus on every single step, Holly. - It's Hannah. - That is right, my dear. Every move must be precise, exact, controlled. You will be perfect. Yes, madame. NATASHA: And who is next? Last rehearsal before the show, Dillon. Let's make magic! Ugh, she's so obnoxious and so dramatic. KRISTYN: And so good. [TCHAIKOVSKY'S "BLACK SWAN PAS DE DEUX" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Nicely done. [SIGHS] I wish I could dance the Black Swan pas de deux. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Bingo. [GRUNTS] [MUSIC STOPS] - Yes! Hoo-hoo! That's my girl! Whoo-hoo! - Perfect. TARA'S FATHER: Yahoo! [WHISTLES] You guys were amazing. Of course we weren't going all out. Saving something for the show tonight. That's why those positions were so sloppy, right, Dillon? - Sloppy? - You looked perfect to me, Dillon. Really? We've got more work to do than I thought. NATASHA: Let's have the milkmaid number. Lower the cow! Hailey, where's my bucket? Check. - Dance like nobody's watching! TARA: Because nobody will be watching. Except the cow. A simple "break a leg" would have been nice. [PULLEY SQUEAKING] Oh... ["MILKMAID DANCE" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Nice. Good. Oh, no. That's not the choreography. What's she doing? Something awesome... ...that's gonna get her in a whole sack of trouble. Stop! Stop the music! Stop everything! That means you, Kristyn! What? Whoa! [GRUNTS] Miss Faraday. This is not the choreography we rehearsed. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Is it your goal to get the attention of the international ballet scouts tonight? Uh, yes, madame. Then I strongly suggest that you follow the choreography that I have given you. - This is cutting into my rehearsal time. - Shh! I've seen other girls attempt to dance their own ideas... ...and I promise you that story does not end well. I don't mean to, Madame Natasha. I just get caught up in the music and the flow... ...and my feet just do their own thing. You can do that "own thing" if you like, Miss Faraday... - ... but it won't get you anywhere. - I understand, madame. You're a good dancer. You could be another Tara if you do as I say. - Isn't that what you want? - Yes, madame. NATASHA: Take five, everyone. DILLON: Are you okay? - Dillon. - Thanks. I'm fine. Come on, Kristyn. Let's get you some new shoes. TARA'S FATHER: Hey, yo. Uh, madame. - Yes? - She can do it. - What? Tara, Tara, she can do the solo for that Faraday girl. Oh! Ha-ha-ha. Where are my manners? Hey, turkey jerky? All protein, madame. I'll set the line-up after rehearsal, as I please. No one is in or out until I say so. This is Tara's big night, so I don't want anything to spoil it. Capiche? The international ballet masters will see plenty of your daughter. What else are they gonna see? Falling cows? Check. An octopus in a milkmaid costume? Double check. Is that the kind of programme you run-? My programme is not in question here, Mr. Pennington. Are we clear? Ye- Crystal. Who's blasting the AC? It's freezing in here. Brr. The temperature in here is perfect. Hello? Madame Katerina? Madame Katerina? KATERINA: Coming! HAILEY: Oh, hi. Ha, ha. Madame Katerina, do we have any size fives? Shoes? Well, there should be some extras over by the Giselle costumes. It'll take more than new shoes for me to make Madame Natasha happy tonight. I was far from perfect. Oh, nonsense, dear. I saw the whole thing. Beautiful dancing. Like a butterfly. When I'm dancing I know the choreography... ...but I get lost in the music and it starts to flow through me... ...and then new moves just start moving. HAILEY: She's been this way forever, madame. She knows every role and every step but when it's time to perform, she just... Okay, there are no size fives here. Try over in Swan Lake storage. [KRISTYN SIGHS] Giselle. I would give anything to dance Giselle. [HUMMING] Careful. We're not quite done with that one yet. Tara's so lucky. Madame will never trust me with a lead role. KATERINA: But your milkmaid dance is a delight! Oh. Just once I wish I could be Odette, Queen of the Swans. I wanted that too, but Natasha got all the dancing talent in our family. HAILEY: Yes! Size five! Oh. Two. [GASPS] KATERINA: The Snow Queen. Our holiday production this year. Does Tara wear this too? - Not this one. Ha, ha. KRISTYN: Doesn't matter. I'm sure I'll be wearing antlers and pulling a sleigh. Ugh. Plenty of shoes, madame. But no fives. - And all the stores are closed. - Oh, wait. I might have something here. They're beautiful. They're for you, my dear. - Thank you, madame. - Right size. - Wrong colour. - No way! Pink is always in style. You know, I bet I can bleach them to match your costume. KRISTYN: Don't you dare. Madame, if you had these all along, why didn't you...? KRISTYN: Wow. These are some shoes. Whoa. BOTH: Whoa. Hailey, where are we and what am I wearing? I have no idea and it looks like Tara's Giselle dress. Tara's dress? Where did it come from? Madame Katerina did the bodice and I did the skirt... ...but the fabric is from India, so technically- No, I mean how did I get into this dress? Uh, I guess the same way your hair turned strawberry blond. What? [ADOLPHE ADAM'S "DANCE OF THE FRIENDS" PLAYING] Wait! I know that music. BOTH: Whoa. KRISTYN: These houses. It's like we're in Giselle. How could we be in Giselle? I don't know, but if we are, the maidens are about to appear. Look, the peasants are about to crown Giselle Queen of the Harvest! - And there's Albrecht, the prince. HAILEY: Jerk. Engaged to another girl and still trying to date Giselle. Where's the nice guy, Hilarious or whatever? KRISTYN: Hilarion. He's hiding, I guess. HAILEY: Oh, of course he is. And we're in a ballet and pigs are about to fly. No. No flying pigs. When the music ends, Giselle will come right out of that cottage! [MUSIC STOPS] Right now. She's missing her cue. [END OF "DANCE OF THE FRIENDS" PLAYS AGAIN] Right now. Where do you think she is? Back at the costume shop? [END OF "DANCE OF THE FRIENDS" PLAYS AGAIN] KRISTYN: Right now? Oh... Psst. Giselle. [WHISPERS] Who's she talking to? I think she's talking to you. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Me? I'm not Giselle. You've got the dress and the hair, and a new pair of... [BOTH GASP] BOTH: The shoes! Dance now, ask questions later. [ADOLPHE ADAM'S "VARIATION OF GISELLE, ACT 1 " PLAYING] She's so beautiful. I must have her as my wife. - So you're a peasant, huh? - What? Yes, that's correct. Single, are you? No fiance? - No, no, no, of course not. - Ha-ha-ha. Of course not. Not masquerading as a peasant to deceive Giselle into marrying you? Oh, I'm sure I wouldn't know what you're talking about. - Beef stew or foie gras? - Well, foie gras of course. Aha! [MUSIC STOPS] [ALL CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] That was awesome. Now let's get out of here. These shoes. I love these shoes. My darling, you are more beautiful today than ever before. - Um... Thank you. - Your eyes, blue as the sky... - ... your hair, kissed with strawberry- - Oh, yeah, right. Ha, ha. - I don't know why- - And I've never seen you dance... ...like that before, or anyone else for that matter. MAN: Giselle... ...this man is an imposter. Look at his hands. Soft like a baby's behind. Yes, yes, it's true. I'm royal. And rich. And stunning. But is any of that my fault? - No. - Providence shines down upon you today... ...as I give you the honour of accepting my proposal. Oh, I think there's a little misunderstanding. Exactly, Giselle and I are to be married tomorrow. Ha, ha. That's hilarious. It's Hilarion. ALBRECHT: You? Ha! What can you offer her? I am descended from the most royal of royal lineages. You are nothing but a oafish farm boy. I am a hunter. And provider for this entire village. Giselle and I milked our first cows together. Remember, Giselle? I got you your first bucket. - Bucket? ALBRECHT: Bucket? I can give her gold buckets, to carry her gold bullion in. Whoa! Hold on. I'm not getting married. I'm only 17. Seventeen? Better late than never, my sweet. You don't look a day over 16. Couldn't we just dance some more? HAILEY: Giselle? A word? Your first bucket, really? It was a nice bucket. Kristyn, we gotta get out of here. I don't know. They're both kind of cute. And you saw me dance, right? If this is Giselle, you know how this story ends. Mad scene, dance, dance, sword in the heart. You got some ghosts there. Wooo... And grave. Yeah. It doesn't end well, does it? But just one more dance, then we'll go. [ALBRECHT & HILARION SHOUTING AND GRUNTING] Oh, not the face, not the face! Uh, they're busy. Let's go. Where are we going? Anywhere but here. KRISTYN: Someone's coming. - Maybe they can give us a ride. - What are you doing? - Flagging down whoever is in that- - No, you're not! Whoa! Oh, wow. Did you feel that? I did. This is not over. You can't just take whatever you want everywhere you go. Yes, actually I can. I am sixth in line to the throne. Third, if you don't include my sisters, which I don't. [SNOW QUEEN CLEARS THROAT] ALBRECHT & HILARION: What? Exactly what is happening here? Oh, um... Uh... Making plans for my wedding to Giselle, Majesty. Oh, he hopes in vain. Your Majesty will be the guest of honour at my wedding to Giselle. And where is the bride? Bring her here so I may watch her choose between you. The Snow Queen. What is the Snow Queen doing in Giselle? That's what bothers you most about this scenario? I am waiting! Your Majesty, if we had known you were coming, we could have- Giselle has gone, ma'am. Gone! Gone where? - Um, to the market for buckets. - Bucket-? How did this happen? I fear that she is not entirely well. Go on. He's right for once, Your Majesty. She was not quite herself today. Ha, ha. She spoke of not wanting to marry me. Ha-ha-ha. Silence! Oh, no. I got them in trouble by leaving. I'll just go explain and we'll all have a big laugh. Do you see them laughing? Did anyone else see anything? Um... She was wearing pink shoes. [ALL MURMURING] Yeah, it's true. She wore beautiful pink shoes. Where did she get pink shoes? I... Uh, from Claude, the cobbler. That is not the answer I was looking for. Find her. And bring her to me. - Everything must be perfect. - Of course, Your Majesty. - I will leave no turn unstoned. - Led by me, Your Majesty. Until then, dance. Go. Be perfect. Well, what are you waiting for? ["DANCE OF THE FRIENDS" PLAYING] It's not safe here. We have to go. We have to do something. I can be Giselle for a little while longer. How much longer? Long enough for...? [GIBBERING] Or until you're a...? Uhh... Wooo... ALBRECHT: North is the best route. South is warmer. She probably headed that way. We shall flip for it. Heads! I always call heads. It's my head, you see? Just flip it. Heads! And a handsome one at that. Fine. She couldn't have gone far on foot. Madame Frosty went that way. The Goofy Brothers went that way. We'll go this way. I don't see anything that looks like a way home. I don't either. Maybe we should go back the way we came. That would be logical. Logical? Is anything about this logical? All I know is I did a dance I've never done before. And the steps were perfect, if I do say so myself. Again, does that sound logical? When we get home, I want Madame Katerina... ...to order me 10 pairs of these shoes. [HAILEY GASPING] The shoes. It has to be the shoes! Unh. What are you doing? You put on the shoes and, poof... ...we're here in this wacky land. So if you take them off... No way! I'm not taking off these shoes. It makes sense. Listen! Wait! [SWANS HONKING] Can't we just try to...? Whoa. - Whoa. - Exactly. No, I mean, whoa, check yourself out. Double whoa. - Swans! - Uh-huh. Swans on the lake. Kristyn, every time you find migratory fowl on a body of water... ...doesn't mean you have... Oh, yeah. That's pretty much your basic Swan Lake. SNOW QUEEN: You will inspect every dog-house, mouse-house... ...and gingerbread house in the land... ...until Giselle is found and brought before me. Do I make myself clear? - Yes, Your Majesty. - Um, um, um, um... So the Giselle is gone. Like vanished. Like poof. Wearing pink shoes? Ooh! Sounds exciting! Anyone else craving excitement? WOMAN 1: Odette, there you are. WOMAN 2: Welcome back. WOMAN 3: You're beautiful. - Amazing. WOMAN 4: Marvellous to see you. They think I'm Odette, the Swan Queen. - Kristyn, we can't get involved here. - Did you see the crown? Yeah, Kristyn, I made the crown. Although, this one looks real. Uh-huh. You're finally catching on, Hailey. This whole thing is real. These poor girls have been turned into swans by the evil sorcerer Rothbart. Yeah, I know the story. - And this lake is made of their parents' tears. - Ew! How'd I miss that part? Look, just give them back their crown and let's go. - Don't even think about dancing. - Oh, okay. Good evening, ladies. [KRISTYN GASPS] - Prince Siegfried. - Heh. Of course. Hm. I'm most fortunate to come upon such beauty here in the moonlight. My name is Siegfried. I think we've met before. I'm a prince. I get that a lot. And what are your names? This is my friend, Hailey. And my name is... Odette. For a few minutes more, her name is Odette. Shall we dance? Of course. [TCHAIKOVSKY'S "WHITE SWAN PAS DE DEUX" PLAYING] Odette, such a beautiful name. - Where are you from? - I'm from, uh, you know, around. Is this domestic silk or imported? Wow. I've never seen anyone dance like this. It's like you're making up the steps as you go along. It just flows right through me, you know? So little Miss Odette has come to the party, hm? I know we've just met... ...but I wanna invite you to a party tomorrow night at my royal pavilion. - A party? - Yes, right over there. Oh. SIEGFRIED: Say you'll come. I want you to know more about me. More about my world. - I could stay here forever. - No, no, Kristyn. What are you-? No, no. Kristyn, don't you dare. - Hey, hey. SIEGFRIED: Well, I hope you do. Oh, she will. Right here on this lake. Kristyn, the sun. I think it might be time for me to go now. So you'll come to the party? I won't leave until you say yes. I'll be there. Save a dance for me. I will only dance with you. Until then... - Oh, isn't he dreamy? - Yeah, he's so cute. Okay, we need to go. But what about the party? Aren't you forgetting what Rothbart does to Odette? Magic spell, turn into swan, tragic ending, remember? Thank you for that flattering introduction. Too late. BOTH: Rothbart! Shoes, Kristyn. It's our only chance. Take off those pink... ...feet. [KRISTYN & HAILEY SCREAM] BOTH: You're a- Ugh. This is so not my day. Now listen up, my feathery friends. My darling daughter Odile will marry Prince Siegfried... ...without so much as a honk from any of you. Do you understand? [BOTH HONKING] Flap. Peck at his shoes. Yeow! Ow, ow, ow! My booties! [GRUNTING] Now get in the water. Aw, Lake of Tears. Ugh. Ick. Gross. [HOOFBEATS APPROACHING] SNOW QUEEN: Rothbart. Disruption is spreading across the land. What news? [CLEARS THROAT] Uh, not a problem here. Everything is fine. A- okay. Uh, pheasant jerky? Quail jerky? Swan jerky? [KRISTYN & HAILEY HONKING] Act natural. Do something swan-ish. [SQUAWKING] Uh, so, Majesty, as you can see here, everything is, uh... [COUGHS] - ... hunky-dory. SNOW QUEEN: Hm. You will attend the Prince's Regency Ball, I presume. Well, of course. With my little flower, Odile. She grows more beautiful and talented by the day. She'll be honoured to dance for the prince. Ha-ha-ha. Yes, as she must. I'm off to the ball, ha, ha... ...where they'll be serving swan livers swimming in swan gravy... ...and a swan sorb- Ooh. [COUGHS] [SQUAWKS] Oh! The coin said south. Therefore we should head south. See here. The weeds are trampled. Two women on foot from the looks of it. - But the coin. - Money cannot buy everything, you know. There is value in doing things yourself. Like milking a cow or hunting your own food. Oh, ridiculous. What fun is there in blisters, calluses or creases in your trousers? Here. Let me show you. This is how you hunt. Bull's eye. Now you try. [GRUNTING] [ALBRECHT YELLS] There. Doesn't that feel valuable? HAILEY: Ugh. What are we gonna do now? KRISTYN: There's only one place we can go. - And that is? To the ball. I have to dance with Siegfried again in order to break Rothbart's spell. The only thing that can break the spell is true love. You only danced with him once. Yes, but there was magic in the air. Didn't you feel it? Yeah, there was, from Rothbart, and now we're swans. So we have to get to the ball... ...before Odile can trick the prince into saying he loves her. [HAILEY SIGHS] It's going to be a long walk with these tiny feet. Ah, you forget, we've got these. How hard can it be? [GRUNTING] [KRISTYN GASPS] I'm flying. This is amazing. Try it, Hail. Ugh. Yeah, sure. How hard can it be? I'm a swan now. I should be able to fly. [GRUNTING] Okay, I can't do it. Just keep trying. [HORSE NEIGHS] BOTH [SINGING]: That's my name too Whenever I go out The people always shout There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt Da da da da da da A little bit softer now. [SINGING SOFTLY] John Jacob Jing- No, I mean don't scare the birds. Look. Oh. The perfect place to rest. Ha-ha-ha. Well, look who finally showed up. Hey. It's the wedding singers. Oh, and they've got some food. Be careful. Psh. We're just birds, remember? Ooh. Look at those delicious swans. Delicious? Why you... [HONKING] Hailey! I'll bag a few for Giselle. Allow me. - Fly, Hailey, fly! - Oh, boy. You did it. [HAILEY CHUCKLES] I can fly. Ha, ha. I can fly. Ha-ha-ha! I did it. Ha! Fantastic. You missed by 20 feet. And now they're gone. That's hardly the kind of gift a girl wants to receive anyway. "Marry me! Oh, here's a dead bird!" Hm. You'll come off like a golden retriever. There's meat for a week on that bird. And soft down feathers for a pillow. Whatever you have to tell yourself, my friend. HILARION: It doesn't have to be a pillow. Look, my cousin Sieg is having a party tonight. All the girls in the land will be there. Giselle is sure to turn up. [CHATTERING] Tonight, Siegfried, you choose a bride. Oh, I will, Mother, I will. Hm... [CHUCKLES] How do I look, Daddy? You look perfect, except for one little thing. There we go. And don't forget, I'll introduce you as Odette. And I'll get the prince to fall in love with me. There she is, Mother. The girl I've been telling you about. She's lovely, my dear. Yeah, I think she's the one. Ah, Your Highness. Allow me to introduce my daughter Odette. I'm so glad you're here. Of course you are. - Shall we dance? - Heh. Let's make magic. ["WHITE SWAN" PLAYING] [HAILEY SIGHING AND PANTING] HAILEY: Okay. Wow. We do not fly quickly. Ha, ha. I did not know that about swans. I just hope we aren't too late. [KRISTYN GASPS] That music. They've started. She's me already. And you can't transform back until the sun goes down. Go down. Go down, go down, go down. You dance beautifully. And you're even more beautiful. Look how he's gazing into her eyes. He's totally falling for her. I mean me. I mean, we've gotta stop those two. Come on. [BOTH HONKING] [CROWD MURMURING] Almost there. Almost there. Yes. Aah, aah! Unh. Sun's down. It's you. You're the one. This isn't how it goes. [SQUEALS] Daddy! [SOBBING] Now, now, little precious, Daddy's here. Shushie. Oh, no, no, no, you're overwrought, dear. Let's get you some fresh air. [CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] Your style is magnificent, Odette. I didn't know my son could dance like that. He really got his dance on. Heh. What is that? "My dance on"? It just means let your feet do their own thing. Another chance to get my dance on, my lady? Sorry, Siegfried. Not tonight. I have to tell you something. Not before I ask you right here, right now, to be my wife. Why does everyone keep asking me that? Okay, Kristyn. Love, love, love. Spell is broken. Now let's get out of here. [HAILEY SHIVERS] - What have I missed? HAILEY: Oh, no. SNOW QUEEN: Mm. Something is not right here. You. - Who are you? - Hi, I'm Hailey. I'm just hanging. You don't belong in this story. Look, Siegfried, you chose me and broke the curse... ...and for that I'll always be grateful. And maybe, one day, if we apply to the same colleges... Oh. What is colleges? [SHIVERS THEN GASPS] The Snow Queen. Hailey? Hailey. SIEGFRIED: What is it? All I can tell you is that things are a huge mess right now... ...and I've gotta go. Go? Where? My guards can take you anywhere you need to go. I don't want anyone else getting hurt. Thank you for this, the dance, for everything. Odette? Hailey? Hailey! [SIGHS THEN SOBBING] ALBRECHT & HILARION [SINGING]: People always shout John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt Da da da da da da ALBRECHT: See, I knew you liked that girl. Why did you want to leave the party? I felt strange dancing with the other girls while Giselle is still missing. True. - Onward to Giselle. - Giselle. - Giselle alone. KRISTYN: Hey. Miss, may we be of some assistance? Oh, thank goodness it's you guys. Giselle? - It's you. - Oh, yeah. Giselle, right. Listen, the Snow Queen kidnapped my best friend and took her away! But you look so different from before. And I still don't believe you're 17. - Marry me. - No, me. Stop. I'd like a nice wedding as much as the next person but... [SIGHS] Please. Just take me to the Snow Queen's palace. I have to get my friend back. Whoa. And take on the Snow Queen yourself? I don't know. I don't think things will get that far. We just have to find Hailey. Who's with me? [HORSE NEIGHING] Whoa! [KRISTYN GRUNTS AND THUDS] I'm good. Come on, guys. Could we please canter a little less? I'm chafing back here. Whoa. I've only heard stories. None of them good. Now I know where everyone goes for the winter. [ALL CHUCKLE] Funny. Thank you for getting me here. The rest is up to me now. Don't go. Think this over, please. We could be so happy. I mean, we've got - Fifteen? ALBRECHT: Fine. You, maybe 13, but either one of us could give you a happy life. With me, you would be significantly more comfortable but- I would never be happy if I didn't try to help my friend. That's what friends do. Then we won't be happy unless we try to help you. Yes. We're all in this together. Turns out he's, um, uh, a willing marksman. He can come in handy. Thanks, guys. We're like the Three Musketeers. The three who? People don't call ahead anymore, they just show up out of nowhere. And you've brought friends. Oh, and look at you, with a house full, and here we are barging in. Ha-ha-ha. Where are our manners? Another time perhaps? So you're the one who's been changing the stories, not following directions. Well, dear, you're just in time for the show. Hailey. SNOW QUEEN: What do you think, Giselle? Or might I say... - ... Odette? - Let her go. I'm the one you want. Tut, tut. Don't be jealous. It'll be your turn soon enough. I've taught her the correct way to do a pirouette. She takes direction perfectly. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Perfect. - Now, a hundred more. - She's not a dancer. Well, everyone has to start somewhere. - That's not what she wants. - But it is what I want. There is one way to dance these steps. My way. Stop. [MUSIC STOPS] [HAILEY GRUNTS] [CACKLING] Now it's your turn. ["BLACK SWAN" PLAYING] Let her go. [BOTH SCREAM THEN GRUNT] Stop that. There is only one way. Ooh! There is only one way to tell this story. No, there's more than one way to tell this story. [GRUNTS] [SIGHS AND PANTS] [MUSIC STOPS] Perhaps you should marry her. She always did wanna milk the cow her way. [HAILEY GRUNTING] - What happened? - Everything's okay now. [ALL CHUCKLING AND CHATTERING] Thank you for what you did. WOMAN: Thank you so much. You ready to go home? Thank you so much, both of you, for all your help. Here, a little memento. It's two headed. Heh, heh. Thank you. Take the bucket. It's yours. I think I'll miss you most of all, Hilarion. I'll miss you too. Huh. What am I? Imitation foie gras? Whoa. Okay, did we just-? Doodiloo, doodiloo. "Who are you and...?" [SHIVERS THEN YELLS] Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Yes, I think we did. TARA: There you are. I have been looking all over for you. You're a size five, right? Well, I brought you these. They're from last season. I wasn't gonna use them anyway. Those look great. Thanks. Break a leg. KATERINA: There you are. We've been looking all over for you. Madame Katerina, the shoes... Did I...? - Did we...? - Why, I don't know about that. But I do know, Kristyn, that it's your turn for the showcase in 15 minutes. Hailey, please help her into her costume. I will, but first I've got some ideas of how to make it better. Good. Follow your instincts. ["DANCE OF THE CYGNETS" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [CROWD APPLAUDING] [SEWING MACHINE WHIRRING] ["BLACK SWAN PAS DE DEUX" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Hey, I've got your dress. Quick. Come on. [CROWD APPLAUDING AND CHEERING] Yes! Hoo-hoo! That's my girl. TARA: Wow. Go out there and make magic. DILLON: You're gonna knock them dead. STAGE MANAGER: Milkmaid finale. Places, please. - Hey, have fun. - I will. [PULLEY SQUEAKING] ["MILKMAID DANCE" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] ["KEEP ON DANCING" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] I follow my heart Somehow it always seems to know And when I dance My feet are dreaming I close my eyes and let go The music flows through me And then I know I'll be fine Listen to the beat of your heart Keep on dancing - She's amazing. - Yes! Whoo-hoo! Keep on dancing Keep on dancing 'Cause dance is who I am Ha-ha-ha. Madame's going to be surprised. Ha-ha-ha. Furious. Isn't it wonderful? Ha-ha-ha. Listen to the beat of your heart Keep on dancing Keep on dancing Shining just as bright as a star Keep on dancing Keep on dancing 'Cause dance is who I am Dance is who I am [CROWD APPLAUDING, CHEERING AND WHISTLING] Yes! Ha-ha-ha! Way to go, Kristyn! Now that's what I'm talking about. TARA: Nicely done, Kristyn. You too, Tara. Then when she was 12, we actually moved to France for a year... ...so Tara could dance. That's where she learned French dance. So... Ladies and gentlemen, the International Ballet Company offers the roles... ...of Giselle and Albrecht to Dillon Matthews and Tara Pennington! [ALL CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] But what's even more exciting... ...is this new dance voice you've been hiding from us. Where is Kristyn? Um, here. I've been searching for something new and I didn't know what it was. And now I know it was you. What you saw tonight was utterly- Utterly unexpected, inspired and the best dancing I've seen in years. She took everything that came before it and gave it back to us fresh. That's Kristyn. Always giving us something new. Now I've been planning a new ballet... ...and I want to build it around you and your ideas. [GASPS] And we're going to need this dress. We won't forget the dress. Natasha, well done. Keep the talent coming. [BALLET SCOUTS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Miss Faraday, I owe you an apology. No, madame, of course you don't. Yes, I do. I see that I was trying to turn you into a second Tara... ...but what I really needed was the first Kristyn. Class starts tomorrow promptly at 9:30. And please bring your good ideas. Congrats on the Albrecht role, Dillon. Thanks, but I always thought of myself more as a Hilarion. Albrecht's kind of a jerk. No, it turns out he's really nice. And he and Hilarion end up being good friends in the end. Um... Am I right, Hailey? Ha, ha. Uh, who's hungry? Mazzacco tacos in an hour? I'm there. HAILEY: You need some help, madame? Oh, not at all. You girls go ahead. I'm just tidying up. Okay, see you tomorrow. Bye, Madame Katerina. Come on, let's go. [KRISTYN & HAILEY GIGGLING] ["KEEP ON DANCING" PLAYING] # I follow my heart # Somehow it always seems to know # And when I dance # My feet are dreaming # I close my eyes and let go #The music flows through me # And then I know I'll be fine # Listen to the beat of your heart # Keep on dancing # Keep on dancing # Shining just as bright as a star # Keep on dancing # Keep on dancing # 'Cause dance is who I am # I stretched for the sky # That's where I wanna go # I close my eyes to see more clearly # The less I think # The more I know # The music flows through me # And then I know I'll be fine # Listen to the beat of your heart # - Listen to the beat of your heart # - Your heart # Keep on dancing # Keep on dancing # The beat of your heart # Shining just as bright as a star # Just as bright as a star # Keep on dancing # Keep on dancing # 'Cause dance is who I am # I colour outside the lines # I'm changing up all the rhymes # - I trip and stumble again and again # - Again and again # But at least these steps of mine # Even when I fall, I shine # I know this feeling # Will lead me to a bright tomorrow # Yeah # Listen to the beat of your heart # Keep on dancing # Keep on dancing # - Shining just as bright as a star # - You're as bright as a star # Keep on dancing # Keep on dancing # Just keep on dancing # Listen to the beat of your heart # Keep on dancing # Keep on dancing # Listen to the beat of your heart # - Shining just as bright as a star # - Just as bright as a star # Keep on dancing # Keep on dancing # 'Cause dance is who I am # Dance is who I am
