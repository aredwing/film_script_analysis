 

                        Coming! Who is it? Phone service ma'am. Phone service ma'am. Hi. Howdy ma'am. The phone. it's in my boudoir. it works fine ma'am. Does it? You didn't call me for the phone. I did. Where do you think you're going? Maybe this isn't such a good idea. You called me for a reason. Okay... I thought you were cute. You like that, huh. Please. Hold still. Please... stop, this isn't funny. it's not funny to call in fake phone trouble and waste my time. You're scaring me. Damn right, bitch. Stop! I have a stun gun in here! Go for it. Did you come? No... did you? No, I was faking it for you. I was faking it for you! Jesus Christ, I thought you were- I thought You were coming. I'm sorry Tiffani, i- I can't get into it with you Caleb, You didn't even grab my titties. it didn't occur to me. My titties didn't occur to you? Look at them Caleb. They occur to every man i meet. But not you! I don't think this is working. I can be meaner. I need a little shake en' bake in my iife. I need to feel... dirty. Filthy. You're so... S.u.V. Double coupons. Family fun. I'll break stuff next time. Caleb, it's over. Tiffani... Good-bye. I waited twenty-four days to have sex with you. Well I didn't want to seem like a slut. Tiffani... Caleb? Leave. I gotta jetta. My belt? Fucking bitch! I'm still not buying it. Give me another chance. I am not... a slot machine. Goodbye Caleb. You're a... decent boy. Nice ass. Heterosexuals are a fucked up species. Twenty-four days! And then one week of not raping her mean enough and then I get shut out! Almost like a computer man. You do every little thing right. and then wham sad face fatal error For us, sex on the first date is a given. You figure out hardware mismatches and move on. Oh, well it's just so easy bake for you. Most guys don't know when to stop moving on. At least you get laid all the time. Hey, it's like 104 days between dates for me, because I don't look like you. Like me? I am not gonna stroke your gorgeous, muscular ego. So what happened to that Jason thing? Justin. Guys around here are like day-old donuts, I mean I eat them because they're there, but you don't want to invest anything in them. At least you got a whole box right there. You don't have to starve. Caleb, I'm on Friendster, my life is so Not-Having-Sex and the City right now. if oniy I were gay. Honey, come out or stay in, do not Heche me into a Mariah. I don't mean literally. Oh of course, liliterally. You know what I mean. You know it's easier for us to get chicks too. Straight girls love gay boys. I could have any girl I wanted. Shut the fuck. Serial killer. Remember Marcy Brooks? Shut the fuck! Milkshake Marcy? Senior year, right after i came out, senior year she offered to Hoover me. To see if she could she could cure me. But you were a geekazold. No offense. Because I'm gay. Now I really want to be a fag. You and Ricky Martin both. Jennifer Seaver. Jenny the Beaver!? Fire- crotch? Shoves her fist in my pants. Full-on grabs my corndog. Swearto God I was gonna puked. They feel safe with us because we're not a threat. Like how they get naked in front of puppies. We're just puppies with dicks. You know, some girls with their puppies- let them eat them right out. Read that in the Kinsey report. My spec-i-a-lity. What I woulda done with the Beav. impregnated her. Got a shit job. Sounds real hot. She's not even your type. So you think more girls would go for me if they thought I was gay. Stop thinking. You just look pretty and turn the letters. No! But I mean- Let's get a Sofia Coppoia things straight here. Being gay is more than listening to good music and eating low fat foods. There are certain things you have to do to convince the general public. Oh. Maybe we could stage a bashing? No, What you need to do is find the loudest queen on campus and smoke his pole. That would be a wrist stamp to pussy smorgasbord. I'm hungry. I'm not your bitch. Oh my God! You pricked it Gwen! You pricked it! I can't believe it! Oh Gwen, I love you! I love you too, Joey. Which one do you want? Oh honey, that one! Oh, it's so big! I love you Bunnycakes! And I love YOu Gingerbutt. Mongoloid. Dildo. Ooh, where'd you learn that ''big girl'' word? Your girlfriend. Oops, I mean ex-girlfriend. it's my brother, he just got dumped. Hard. Who told you, you little bah- witch? I know. He totally is. uh, excuse me why don't you? Oh okay, why don't I just turn into gaseous form for a minute. Smells like you're halfway there. Dogs have a heightened sense of smell. With with an ass that big, it's like spotlights to us. Those are headlights and I don't plan on braking. Keep on pedaling, you're almost to a busy intersection. The intersection's only busy because you're giving half-price blowjobs. What are the rules to this game? I don't know but you just lost, loser. Freak. I'm on the phone. He won't leave me alone. Go graze outside. Stop mooching. Go back to college and eat your instant Ramen. Mom! Caleb's drinking out of the milk carton! Am not! it's the acidophilus! Caleb, Honey? You okay? We heard you got dumped. You're way hot! You're accent sexy. Even homeless people have accents, Huh? I don't like to kiss. You're kidding. Seriously. You can play with my nipples if you want. Y'know, kissing is so 1990s. I think I might be- Well, I think I might be gay. Gay?! Well, a little bit. I turned another one? it could be a phase. Please. Can you list any tracks on Madonna's Like a Prayer album? um, Express Yourself, Cherish, Oh Father- Vogue... No honey, Vogue was on Dick Tracy. it's not a fucking phase, you're full-fledged homo. Jesus, what'd I do?! Well, didn't you ever suspect that- I mean I am a little... I know what you mean. We're all just people. Just bodies with organic needs. We need satisfaction. We shouldn't deny our bodies. Let's not deny our bodies. Honey, it's not going to work this time, I'm pretty gay. Oh, I was good enough for you last night you fucking faggot. You're not being very positive about this. I couldn't be any more positive if I was gang raped in a repository bin at the needle exchange! All I do is help gays come out. So who are you fucking? Well, i haven't had sex yet. Hah! I mean, except with you. And some other girl. Get out! Well, can't we be like, best friends or something? I already have a gay best friend. Yeah, Marc. is he single? Get out! it's like I'm on a conveyor belt. A little piece of sushI no one wants. You lookin' for Mr. Right Now? Please, I'll settle for Mr. Five Minutes Ago. Sorry. No prob- -lem. Joey just remember! Every time you suck a dick! Every time you poke some boy in the brown eye! Just remember that you've... eaten... PuSSY! You ate pussy and you liked it! i, i... You came! HI Gwen. Who's your friend? Oh, Jesus. Fair thee well my fairy fay. Who was that? I don't know, he's a newborn. No, the girl. Gwen. She's hot. Yeah, she's cute. But a total Meredith Brooks hit single. Excuse me. That her boyfriend? No, her roommate, Marc, the love of my life. He's gay and I'm invisible. All her friends gay orwhat? She's kind of a fag hag. I hate that term. 'Cause you're one. Shut up. I am not. You live with me. So she's straight though, right? Yeah, but she's totally in love with Marc. They screwed when he was in the closet and she's been trying to replace him ever since. Doing a real good job, she keeps dating fags. I feel like a turnstile to the white party. Why do you keep doing this? I don't know. They're time bombs, Gwen. it doesn't seem worth it. I met you. Let's not go there. You're the best thing that ever happened to me. I wanna go home. Marc, take me home. I just got here. Let's hang for a bit. I'll do a little damage control. I bet I looked pretty stupid out there. Not at all. Liar. You did look sorta goofy. I did? You ate pussy! You liked it! Fuck you! I almost made it with ''British Guy'' in a broom closet. But he wouldn't kiss. Maybe your breath was penisy. Can I make you a drink? Did you want me to make you a drink? I'm gorgeous, not helpless. it's not a sexist thing. I just thought you might be... You, know stressed out. Just get the fuck out of my way. Sorry. Thanks hon, wanna mix one for yourself? Fuck you. She just brushed me off- with a flame-thrower. She's just like that at first. You like them butch. Would you stop being a total zit and leave me alone. What's taking so long? Oh, hI Gwen. You know this guy? Yeah, this is Caleb. Caleb, Gwen. Sorry Caleb. it's been a night. Nice to meet you. Caleb's gay. You're gay. uh. Yeah. He's kinda new. Oh honey. That's so sweet. You two together? Oh no. Not anymore. We're just roommates. Good. We were never together. Sorry. Sometimes I can be a cunt and a half. I thought you were a drunk breeder boy going forthe chick in despair. Your shoes had me fooled. Like I said, he's new. Gwen. HI Marc. Kevin. Kyle. Marc, this is Caleb. Hi. He's family. Nice to meet you, Caleb. I'm sorry, I'm totally drunk. No you're not. You're designated driver. No, I think you're wrong, Gwen. I was just meeting Gwen and... You new here? He's my roommate. We dated. We didn't date. Let's away, ourwork's done here. Where are you going? What? Let's give them some room to breathe on each other. I wanted to talk to Marc. Not a chance with that around, hon. So... You stole my boyfriend! He's not your boyfriend. Oh, so now you're gay? it was your idea. You knew how I felt about him! We're not doing anything. You're going on a date! That was his idea. I've been stalking him for years. You decide to be gay for one night- I'm not gay! Why don't you just tell him you like him? That would be as futile as drug testing at the Gay Games. So you think you're gonna get Gwen like this? I don't know. I don't want to go. But he lives with her. I'll get to see her again. I can just tell her and get this all sorted out. Of course there goes any chance I had with her. And you live with me, so Marc will have to come here. This could be parfait. Go on a few dates with Marc, the four of us hang. You come to the sad realization that you're straight. You go running to Gwen, Marc comes running to me. Genius. I'll be your... goatee. How do you know they'll do that? Sounds ''etch-a-sketchy.'' No, it's parfait. You don't understand human nature the way I do. I'm a musician. Who got you that date with Tiffany? You hit herwith my car on purpose? No that was just dumb luck, i knew how to take advantage of the situation. Plus Tiffany lives right next door to them and seeing you date her neighbor would kill her. Okay, one date, and we'll see how it goes from there- but no sex stuff. Yeah, try to control yourself. Fuck me or fuck you? You'll actually wear it for what, twenty minutes? Not with this guy. Because he's Mr. Wonderful, Mr. Yin up my Yang, I talked to him for fifteen minutes and I feel like I've known him my whole life. I'll be happy if he likes to kiss. He's probably a freak. When he's around, my heart beats like a trailer park house. That is so gay. And I mean all three definitions. So what are you doing? Eating out? Richard's having a b-b-q for staff in the music department. And then...? I dunno, but try not be here, okay? Oh, and then you're eating out. What if he tries to grab me? We're not pirates, we just dress like them... and chase booty. He'll be just as nervous as you. So try not to punch him if he makes a move on you or anything. I don't think I'd punch him. i think I'd probably just start crying or something. Aww. You got fagitude. Well, how do I know if he wants to do it, is there like a code word or something? You mean like homolingo? We talk normally... in English. I'm a failed role-model. Do I look gay? Like an insatiable bottom. Why did you say that? Just to fuck with you. it's for you, Blowmeo. Hello? it's me. HI Tiffani! I was just running out the door, but- HI Tiffani! So, I ran into Max today. How is Max? Well, he's fine and you're gay. Oh, that's just- it explains an awful lot. I thought maybe I wasn't attractive enough. But now I see where I stand. I thought maybe, you know, i could win you back to ourteam. Sorry Tiffani, I'm gay now. How could you do this to me? Well actually, I think you did it to me. I think you turned me gay. I did not turn you gay! How can you say that?! I mean don't take it personally. I am a person! How else am i supposed to take it? Bastard! uhhhhhh. Fag! Fag! Fag! Fag! it's funny, I used to have- had a friend in this same building. I'll be like five minutes, okay? Please, Siegfried and Roy couldn't tame your hair. uh, it's OK. Gwen can keep you company. I'm used to entertaining your tricks. Okay, mute! She's kidding. I haven't had a trick in like so long. I mean- Tricks are for kids. I mean, I've had dates, it's just- Go powder your nose, babe. The powder that goes on your nose. Hello, and welcome to the Gwen Anderson show. Mind if I couch with you? Sure. So, what's your majorette? Poli-sci. Oo! Brainy smurf. I'm not very good at it though. Honest. I like you. Thanks. Did you bring condoms? um. I'm kidding. Relax. You look so tense. How's that? it's nice. When you guys get home try not to make too much noise. I have to tutor in the morning. I don't think you need to worry about- Kidding again. I don't tutor. Make all the noise you want. This girl upstairs has all makes them pretend to rape her. She screams and throws things. it really freaked me out. I called the cops the first couple of times. Oh. Huh. it probably isn't different guys. it's probably just the same just different roles. Oh no, it's different guys. Sometimes there's like three and they do this whole gang bang routine. She's all ''No! You're doing me all at once!'' Sick, huh? But you know, to each her own. My parents think I'm nuts for chasing gay boys. Maybe they'd lighten up if i into orgyastic splendor. You know, two guys, one orifice. They call it double dicking. That's pretty weird. So...Caleb. Before you started to go girl, did you ever go girl? Oh, no. I mean, just the thought of it is- Ooh! Defensive. Like not even before you came out? No. Okay, so sue me, but I have to say it. if you've nevertricked with a are you sure you pick dick? Well, um. I've never done it uh, you know, gay. My god you're a virgin? A virgin homosexual? Lemme touch you! What about Kyle? Oh, we never... Thank god, you just don't look right together. A virgin. You're so cute. How did you make it past 18. I would have thought some plucked you from the chicken coop a long time ago. Well Marc is very gentle. He You've got nothing to worry about. Okay. Caleb, honey. if you've never had a boy or a maybe you should try the normal thing first. I mean why stray down a path isolation when happiness might be right here. Ever even been curious about kissing a girl. A little maybe? um, Gwen? Yes? We need to talk. Talk to me. Am I interrupting? Okay, I tried everything. Total fag. He's all yours. She tries that on everyone- not that there's a lot of guys... You ready? Sure, whatever. Play with the safety on, boys. Always do, Mother. Would you boys do me a favor? it would so turn me on. What's that? Kiss. I think two guys kissing is so hot. Not in front of you. Oh, please?! We haven't even done it in I mean we don't even know if we're going there! Think of it as an icebreaker. Caleb? Please? For me? um, only if it's okay with Marc. Oh, it's okay. Well great! Great. Great. Please, how's a girl supposed I kissed my grandma like that in her coffin. Gwen, if he doesn't want- Wow. That's a way to start a date. How was that? it was great. it was a start. Goodbye, Gwen. Oh, uh bye Gwen. Bye... Sexual. Sorry about all that. That's just Gwen. Oh, I totally dig her. She's great. Seems like every time I find it's a girl. Straight boys must have it so easy. I wouidn't say that. Oh come on, perfect girls are everywhere. it's cruel. I'm sorry, am I making you nervous? Not at all. I'm making you nervous. No, it's okay. So, I gotta warn you. They're all music-types at this party. Classical musicians. A little offbeat. That means crazy. Yeah. You like classical? Hello! Sweetheart! Oo! Who is this? Caleb, this is Richard. And his wife Miko. And so the program spelled Beethoven- B-E-A-T... So Caleb , what do you do? um. He goes to the u. Wonderful! So how long have you two been an item? Ronnie! Please! We kinda just met. That's so sweet! The two of you look so cute together. Like a couple ofJudds or Culkins. Caleb, have you heard Marc play? No. Well you must. He is the most this school's had in years. it's divine. Marc, you have to play something before you leave. I thought we were going to do eight hands two pianos later. Yes! Richard! Set that up! Caleb. Why don't you turn pages for Marc and Winston. Just turn the page as fast as you can when I nod. You'll do fine. Ready?... And. Turn! Oh! Sorry. Turn! That was so cool, man. You guys were awesome. You really had a good time? it was great! That Ronnie's a character. Yeah, I have some weird friends. They were fun, though. And you're great on the piano. Well, I'm also a flautist. Just eat less beans. Have you seen this one? I don't think so. it's really good. Your next appointment? Yeah? What're you guys doing? it's just Kyle. He asked about me?! No. Has he mentioned me? No. What do you want? Well, what're you guys doing? Renting videos. What?! I can't believe you're going along with this. This is sick. I'm in a video store. I can't really talk. Pronto? Hey. I'm at Debbie Milford's. Am i hang over night here? Renting a video is code for having sex. You're paranoid. Renting a video? So I am staying the night. Gwen, he's so cute. What else is gonna happen? Two gay men sitting on a couch, boring movie, raging hard-ons. it's the code you rent a video, you get laid. Dude, you said there was no such thing as Gayspeak. Well I was wrong. Do not go home with him. Gwen's gonna be there. Only if she's a bad fag hag. Gwen honey, yourturn. Just a second. Take yourtime sweetie. We have all night long. Caleb, this is so not cool. Nothing's gonna happen. Plus, I can tell Gwen's into me. it's working. Of course she's into you. You're gay. Shut the fuck up. God, Gwen he is so... unh.

Keep your hands off my man. I'm hanging up. Okay, he's getting off. So. You seen any of these? Gwen? Gwen? Hmm. I thought she'd be back. Well, at least we got the place to ourselves. Go ahead, make yourseif at home. And when I say that I mean and roll around on the floor. Gwen? Trust me, if she was here, she'd be all up in our pubes. So. Video? Huh? You know, that thing we rented. Oh yeah. We could watch it. Yeah. Or... Or? Orwe could not watch it. Oh. it's up to you. I'm cool either way. Oh, sorry. That was really good. Yeah. So.

Oh I don't normally... What? Make that much. I should go. Yeah. Sure. Thanks. You're welcome. I'll call you. Yeah! Call me. Drive safe. Yeah, you too. Wish I had your cell, I woulda called instead of stopping. I'm glad you stopped. You want my cell? Abba-solutely. Let me get mine. Let's fast forward through the small talk. I want to know how it went. Went? You just made it with your first guy! Aren't you happy? I'm confused. Didn't it feel good? Shit, I was too pushy. Honey, Marc's a good guy. The best. You're in good hands. it's just too much- Too soon? No, not that, I don't know. We're all just people. Just bodies with organic needs. We need satisfaction. We shouldn't deny our bodies. Are you turned on? No, that's just my- You're still turned on. You've had a boner since you left Marc? No! Don't be embarrassed. That's how it is the first time you do it, you just wanna do it again. You mind me doing this? No. How about this? Don't you think we should, uh, I mean we're in public. I think it's sexy you're worried about Marc, but it seems to me that Marc didn't do his job. Calm down. it's fine, I'm just- Suck that. And don't give me any strictly gay shit. Who needs friends that won't fuck friends? Eat it little gay boy! Yeah! Whoa! That's your perineum. You are such a fag. Why, you back so late? Can we talk about this in the morning? Caleb! Fuckin-A, what happened? Did you do it with Gwen? Sort of. Well, did you talk about me? Caleb? Hello? Good morning! Wait forthe beep and tell me something I don't know. This is for Caleb. You're probably sleeping. i I had a great time last night. Really. So I just wanted to call, ecause lots of guys have a thing about calling, where you don't call, and and see who calls first. And well, I didn't wanna. Geeze, I sound really stupid. Anyway, call me. Mwah. Okay bye. What the fuck? Shit. Kyle, I'm sorry. Fuck you! it's not what you think. Hello? Oh shit. it's Marc. I'm sorry, did I wake you? No. I just got your message. God, I feel like a stalker. I just realized I didn't leave thought I'd call leave it on your machine. I didn't think you'd answer. No, that's fine. Well, it's nice to talk to you anyhow. I'm sorry, were you busy? No. Just... recovering. You must be one fuck of a fuck. That was him. Marc's the asshole type. He normally fucks and moves on. But I guess with you. I mean who wouidn't want to... keep you around. How could you fuckin do this to me? That's not fair. it's not like you guys even- You don't even know, do you? You're so stupid. Well, I invited them over for dinner. Here? Great you guys can just make out in front of me. Wanna screw in my bed? I invited Gwen too. We're all gonna sit down and tell the truth. And just. Just... Just what? Huh? Things are so simple in your aren't they? Well, Caleb, it doesn't work that way. Things are a lot more complicated than just sitting around telling people how you really feel. I'm trying to fix things here. Okay? You're doing a Fabio job so far. Just say you'll come to dinner. Okay? Fine! I'll be there with balls on. You're not planning on cooking, are you? Well, I wasn't gonna ask, but since you brought it up. Fine! I'll cook. I'm not that stupid. I do know. if I were gay. Even a little. it'd be you. Alright, I won't go. He wants you to. it's like he's Tell him I have consumption. I shouldn'ta done that last night. it was hot. it was fucked up. You should've seen him, he flew out of here like a seminal Meatloaf album. He seemed to like it on the phone. That's what's so fucked up about it. Are you jealous? No. You're jealous! I am not. This is so great! it's finally the otherway around. Do you know how many boys just to get to you? Shut up. You're scared I could convert him. Maybe I just will. I need to practice.
