 

                        Now arms out and up. Out and up. Good, Blanch! And up. Out and up. Out and up. And out and up. And out. You got it, Estelle! The wop-wop, wop-wop. Wop-wop, wop-wop. Now shimmy, whoo! Shimmy! Shimmy, shimmy. And bring it home! Go forth, and get on with your bad self. My God. I'm so late. Hunter, Hunter, I need you to clean up this mess. Okay, make sure you put the towels in the wash. Yes, yes, got it, got it. -All right, keys. -Keys, thank you. Now, are you gonna stay in here all night, or are you gonna go meet my new dad? You're really excited about me going out on this date, aren't you? Very, very excited. I want you to have fun. No drinking and driving. Text me when you get there. Okay? Yes. And remember, don't use Windex... On the bar, got it. Okay. Okay. Hey, hey, hey, no spilling. Watch what you're doing, man. Yo, I thought you said only a few people, man. What's going on? Yo, what are you talking about, man? This is a few people. No, it's not, man. Okay, look, I mentioned it to Mia, and she told Mya. And by the way, Mya got a thing for you, bro. I'm just saying. She totally does. She talks about you all the time. It's actually kind of annoying. It's annoying. You know what, man, look. You throwing this party right here? This is huge, a'right? Yeah. Kicking off the summer right. It's gonna be the best three months. Hey, Hunter. This party's rad. Okay. Go, Mya! Are you allowed to have parties here? Come on, dance. I don't really dance. Dancing's not my thing. All right, we're just gonna... -What's up, asshole? -Hey, man, you got a problem? Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, man, what's going on? Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight... No. No! Stop! So, which one of you threw the party? I did. So sorry I'm late. I had to bust it over to BB's before the breakfast ended. Let's get to adjudicating. Smooth. All right, what's happening here? Disturbing the peace, destruction of private property, underage drinking. What do you got to say for yourself, son? Well, your honor, I... I didn't do most of those things. My friends did. But I took one drink, which I'm incredibly sorry for. Coolio. And well said. You seem like a good kid. Nice suit. Good job, Mom. That's why I'm only gonna give you 100 hours. What? Sir, 100 hours of jail time seems a bit steep. 100 hours... of community service. Mom, I want you to decide where he serves those hours. You know that old choreographer of mine? He runs a camp up north. No, no. You can't make me do that. She can't make me do that, right? Great. I'm good. That happened real fast. I'm fine, and I'm okay. Please don't make me do this. Doing your hours at the rec center is not gonna keep you away from those boys. -They're not that bad. -They're not that good either. This is... This is gonna be so horrible. Mom, Ivan's that guy who threw a shoe at me, right? He's eccentric. You know, it's actually a compliment where he comes from. I was 6, okay? That was very scarring for me, all right? You're leaving me in the hands of a known child abuser. Would you stop? Mini James Brown! Ivan. Me, me. Wa-wa... Okay, all right. It's gross. It's very... stop. Mini James. Why do you keep calling me Mini James? -You don't remember? -What? -He doesn't remember? -No. You will remember. You will remember. All right, well, here's my time sheet. You just have to sign off my community service hours, and I get to go back to Planet Earth. Hunter. You still go that wit. You still got that wit. Come on. Why don't we just go take a tour, come on. Mom, Mom, Mom, no. This is the drop point. This is where you cut the cord. Right, of course. I love you. -Love you too. -It's gonna be good, okay? All right. Call you. It's gonna be all right. All right. Here, you can be whatever you want to be. I started this place 25 years ago. I've been producing the best dancers in the country. Music videos, film, TV. You name it, we got it. Welcome to Dance Camp. Mess hall is down over there. Cabins are over there. We got basketball courts, pool... yes! We got all sorts of crews here. You name it, we got it. Nice job, Kelsey. Watch out. Out of my way, fool. We got the YOLOs over here. Those are some of our youngest crews. They've been here for two years now, and look, they are sharp, sharp. Good job, girls. Snap it, snap it. Come on, girls. Get into it. Get into it. Get those arms up. Nice. Listen, Hunter, I don't want you to be shy, okay? If you want to take some dance classes, hip-hop, crunking, jazz, anything you want, if you want to practice a new move, you go, you book out some time. This is the place. I want you to reconnect with the dancer inside of you. I don't have a dancer inside of me. That is creepy. Young ladies, chill! No autographs here. Ladies, ladies, I'm sorry. All right, all right, all right. You guys want a little Lance? I'll give you a little Lance. #WhosReady4Camp? That's right, that's right. Hey, an autograph. Look, sorry, bro. I'm just a regular guy like you. No autographs here. And that is Lance. He's pretty much a legend around here. Legend of Dance. See, if you want to be in the Legend of Dance, you got to have a really tight crew. Right, yeah, none of those sentences have any meaning to me. You see, every summer around here, all the crews get together and compete to be legends, Legends of... Dance, right, I get it. You are good, you are good. So we've got you in the Moonwalk cabin, right there. It is even more fun than you could possibly imagine. No, no, listen. Look, I'll just find my own little cabin or area. I'm not a part of these dancers or campers, obviously. You're so funny. You're gonna love it here. You know what I'm gonna love more, Ivan, is getting my hours signed and getting the hell out of here. No, I'm... No, I'm cool. I'm good. You guys keep pretending to be robots. Okay. Okay, they're pretty cool. Yeah, that's my butt. What? No. I wasn't looking at your butt, no. I was... I was checking out your form. Which is great. Great form work. I'm gonna go to my cabin. Okay. Don't take another step, muchache. I'm gonna have to kill you, all right? I'm just kidding. I won't kill you, okay? Hey, look, there's two rules here at the Moonwalk cabin. Rule number one: I'm gonna need you to shower every day, okay? No stinkies. And if you don't, I'm gonna get in there with a loofah, I'm gonna wash your gooch, all right? Yeah, that sounds reasonable. Okay, rule number two: anytime you enter and exit the cabin, I'm gonna need you to do a moonwalk. Okay, now, that's a dance hazing thing, isn't it, where I moonwalk and everyone laughs at me because I'm the dumb one to believe it, right? Comprende, muchache, all right? The thing is, muchacho, I'm not really a camper. I'm just here for community service, all right? No, muchacho, okay? Look, I'm gonna need you to follow the rules, 'cause rules are rules. So let's pip you back there, okay? Hey, how's it going? Thank you. It's nice, see? It's real nice. Come on, let's feel it out. It'll be fun; do it with me. Just kind of want to feel it, my hombre. We all got M.J. in our heart. You just got to make sure he's right there with you. That's the spirit, my man. -Come on in! -No. Okay. It's okay. Hey, you know what? We're gonna work on those dance moves. We got a long time to see it. I am Dougie. I am your counselor. This is my bunk. I do a little dancing on the side myself? And in the wind, you know? And he's got the open... All right, cool, let's show you around the cabin, okay? We got the mailbox over there if you want to talk to Mom-Mom and Pip-Pip. Keep a secret candy stash back there. Through the door are the restrooms. And here, the piece a la resistance, is your bunk, complete with a bunkmate. This is Jebediah, but the word on the street is, is the kids like to call him Jeb. Hey, Jebby, why don't you hop on down and see your bunkmate Hunter? What did I say about playing games? Have fun, boys. You're my new bunkmate? Hi. Before you say anything, I need you to fill out this. This is a bunkmate questionnaire. So it's got your medical history, preferred bedtime, the way you like your s'mores, dietary needs... Yeah, no. I'm not gonna fill this out. Ballsy, coming in hot. I like that, I like you. What is this, like, your first camp or something? My gosh, is it? Yeah. Yeah? My gosh. Well, it looks like we got a noob situation over here. Boys! Hey, hey, no, I'm actually not here to dance. I know. I can read it all over your face. You got classic noob face. Face of a noob, noob face. Face of a noob is what you've got. -Okay, all right. -Yeah. Well, let me break it down for you. The bunkmate relationship is the cornerstone of a positive camp experience. We got to know each other better than we know ourselves, upside-down and inside-out. Yeah, I definitely don't want to know you inside-out or upside-down. Well, I've already filled mine out, so you're gonna. And, hey, listen. Don't worry, I got your back. I'm what they call a camp pro. I start out every summer at astronaut camp until it's... tchk... over. Then I'm off to math camp and SAT prep camp. Then it's to Jewish camp, though I'm only half-Jewish, so they only let me go for half the time. After aeronautics camp, I would usually go to robotics camp, but until the technology's there, it's basically like glorified K'nex, you know? Then I went to Phat Camp, but with a "P-H." I learned to rap like the Notorious BGI. Football camp! Fantasy football. But still! Consumer electronics camp, video game camp. By the way, have you played "DDR?" Hunter, "DDR," "Dance Dance Revolution." Have we not talked about this? My gosh, you're gonna freak. I have video. There are these guys in Russia. They're the all time "DDR" champion... Hunter? No. Hello, hello, hello, dance camp campers. So excited to see you all settling in. It's gonna be a great year this year. So most of you have probably picked your Legends of Dance teams. Please... do not forget to get in touch with the team captains. Yeah! Just... just cleaning up here, you know. Right. We have rehearsal in here. Hunter! I didn't know you were on this team. I'm not. Cheyenne, this is Hunter. I heard about him. He's just doing some type of community service. He's not here as a dancer. So are you saying that you're into bad boys? How does that make sense? 'Cause... bad boys do... community service. I'm not into anyone. I'm here to dance, and I'm here to win. Are you guys flirting? Is that what this is? I mean, maybe not, because it's so awkward, but, well, maybe that's what flirting is. Alex, hey. Hunter, this is Alex. We go way back. He's deaf, but he lip-reads very well, and also I can sign for you, 'cause let's just say he's taught me a thing or two about the language of sign. What's up, man? Deaf sister? No, no, no. But you know you're at dance camp, right? Okay. Okay, wait, okay, guys. Slow down there, slow down, 'cause... Okay, dance is about being on time, so that's what I expect from you. Come on. Kenton, leave your skates at the door. Gather around. Right, whoever has the stress ball says their name and their favorite dance style. Cheyenne, hip-hop. Yo, I'm Emily. Ballet, I guess. Kenton. I jam-skate. Sanjana. I like modern. I can also do some kathak, but, like, not as good as my parents. My parents actually met at a dance school in India. I've only been there once, but that's because my dad got in a fight with his brother, and he's all, "I'm not going back till he apologizes," which will never happen... Let's keep it moving so we actually have time to dance. Totally understand what you're saying. Sometimes I have this tendency to ramble. -Pass the ball. -Right. So my name's Vanessa. What's you're favorite style? Honestly, for me, I'm all about that krump. Skating. I like animatum. I literally love hip-hop, like Cheyenne. My favorite dance style would be... dancing. Like, getting nasty and shit. Hell yeah. Well, you know "DDR," "Dance Dance Revolution?" I pretty much crush at that, so... Pass the ball, Jeb. Yep, yeah, cool. Hunter Portis. Zumba master. Okay, focus. We need to pick a team name. So, to save time, I've thought of one already. From now on, we'll be known as... the Dark Shadows. What about Generation Dance? Or how about the Glitter Ponies? I, for one, love Cheyenne's idea. Okay, then it's settled. You got something to say? Okay, now, you can totally shut me up, cut me off, whatever. I'm not a part of your little squad. But why don't you just go with what was on your sign? 'Cause that makes no sense. It said TBD, "to be determined." Right, yeah. It could mean To Be Dancers. It could mean Tough Bitches Dancing. I like that. It's mysterious, so it fits my brand. Yeah, I like that last one, the bitches one. Okay, fine, whatever. We're TBD, okay? Now let's get to work. Come on, everybody up. We only have a week until we face off against Flow Nation. This week's theme is "Breaking Out." Let's see what I'm working with. Okay, so we're gonna go, slide to the right, spin, punch to the left. Really? Right now? You have to be doing that right now? You guys try. Five, six, seven, eight. Yeah! Baby, baby, baby! What the shit, bro? My gosh. Lance, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... I see what's going on here. Cheyenne put you up to this, didn't she? What? Hey, man, chill out, bro. I guess since Cheyenne can't beat me fair and square, she's got to try and take me out instead. Yeah, yeah. Cheyenne, yeah, she sent Jeb out here to play "DDR" to take you out. Yeah, that's what I just said, bro. I just said that. Okay, I see the problem. You don't understand what sarcasm is, do you? I'm pretty sure I know what sarcasm is. Right, guys? -Yeah. -He knows what sarcasm is. See? I know what sarcasm is, Hunter, clearly. But since you're new here, I'll fill you in a little bit. This isn't the first time that someone's tried to take me out. I live my whole life with a target on my back. So I suggest all three of you get out of here before I whoop all of your asses. Hunter, come on, let's just go. You're, by far, the weirdest dude I've ever met in my life. -Yeah? -Yeah. Well, you're the worst dancer I've ever met. Boom! Sarcasm! That's not really sar... Hey, shut up, bro. Look, me and you, right here, right now. Bro, look, I'm not fighting you, okay? The only thing lamer than being at dance camp is getting into a fight at dance camp. No more talky-talky. Your finger's on my face. What are you gonna do about it? Snap. What's with the headband? It's part of it. -Back up! -Back up! Back up, son. Welcome to Lance Camp, bitch. It's just ironic, 'cause you just put that paint on, and now... -Shut up. -Sorry. I just thought I would point out the dramatic irony of the moment. Like, you couldn't have written it better. Jeb. That thing have a silencer on it? Done and done. Nothing like a good nebulizer treatment before bed to help you fall asleep. One wise whistling wizard. Two tooting tuba tunas. Three twirly tricky tree toads. Four fresh French flamingoes. Five freezing fleeing... What are you saying? These are my vocal exercises. I have to do them every night before bed for dialect camp. It's in just two months. Why? Does it bother you? No. It's wonderful. Hunter, are you still upset because Lance pushed you in the paint bench today? I feel like it's a double-edged sword, because on the one hand, yes, Lance pushed you on a paint bench, and everyone laughed, and it was embarrassing. But, on the other hand, Lance is an Internet celebrity. Like, getting seen with him in any context is good for your online persona. What do you think? I got an idea. I like ideas. Wake up Alex. My gosh. I feel like a spy. I feel like a lamb spy. # Sneaking around # # Here we go, sneak, sneak, sneak # # Sneaking, sneaking, sneaking around # What's up, YouTube? It's Lance. Just Lance. Kidding. But seriously, it's just Lance. And today we're coming at you live from E=MC "we don't really need to do math because we're really good dancers" Squared cabin at Dance World. And today, you know what? I'm gonna be answering questions from my 133,256 followers. First up, Chron85. Come on. Stay down. All right. "Lance, do you ever feel like you have a target on your back?" That's actually a very important question, and probably one of the best questions that anyone has ever asked me. And the answer is yes. I can't believe I get to be a part of this. This is a camp classic! All day, every day, 365 days of the year. And, yes, there were talks between the Bieb's team and I about me becoming a backup dancer, but I said, "Look, Justin, look, Scooter, I got to stay in school." -What are we doing? -We're gonna smoke him out. That's what I decided to do. So #stayinskool, #... Is that... Get me out of here! Come on! #Revenge. Let's jam. Sacrifice your body! Get me out! Sacrifice yourself! On three, one, two, three. Is that-! Get me out of here! Sacrifice your body! Okay, I get it. I know why I'm here. I know why I'm in trouble. How was I supposed to know that that would happen to his face? Fragrance sensitivity affects one in every 15,000 Americans. What? Imagine a world with no scented candles, with all-natural tree sap deodorant that just makes your armpits stick together. Look, Hunter, I forgive you... Okay. Because every allergic reaction I have is an opportunity to spread awareness of my condition. The amount of sheer pain I feel on the outside is nothing compared to the amount of joy I feel on the inside. I just hope that we can put this past us and become friends. Me too. Lance, go back to your cabin. Thank you, Mr. Turgnofsky. You've been most gracious. #Respect, brother. #Getoutofhere, yeah? I win. Thank you, sir. Okay, I'm gonna just... How many community service hours do you think you've worked so far? 191/2. -Wrong. -No, right. Look, I have the time sheet, actually. -Zero. -What are you doing? You haven't been doing any work. All you've been doing is causing a disturbance. You're drifting. Hunter, your soul needs... soul. That doesn't even make any sense. Do you even know what this is? You don't. There. That's the kid I want to see. Okay, you just have that stored away in your cabin? Yes. That's not creepy at all. That's the kid we're all waiting for. Well, you're gonna be waiting a long time, 'cause I'm just trying to get my hours done and go home. You want to get done with your hours quicker? Yes, I do. I'll make a deal with you. Pick a team, any team, and compete in Legends. I'll count the hours that you practice as community service hours... on top of your work hours. Deal, deal. Yes. Mini James Brown. Okay. What's with the shoe, man? That's dance code for "good job." Really? Yeah, I doubt that. Hello, everyone. We have a big day ahead of us. Just a few hours before Legends of Dance officially begins. Today's contestants, finalize your routine. No, bigger. Roll everything. We can't lose, let's go. Five, six, seven, eight, one... Make sure they're sharp. But most of all, have fun, while working hard, while having fun. We're killing it out here! Dance Camp, baby! Three years, three years! One, two, three, four. Sanjana, focus. Seven, eight, one, two, three, four. Jeb, look up. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, and pose. Six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four. Do you have to clean right now? I'm not here to clean. I'm here to help you guys out. I'm here to "dance." What makes you think you can help us? No music or anything. Okay. It was unsettling... but not completely awful. Which is what you guys have been giving me. We're on tonight. You've got some serious catching up to do. Yeah, no problem. Fall in line, from the top. All right, we're gonna do it with the freeze this time. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, freeze, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, freeze, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six... What are you doing? I'm frees... I'm freestyling. This is choreography. You have to learn the steps. Well, yeah, I haven't had a chance yet. You're not even trying. Look, this is a single-elimination tournament. If you're gonna be on this team, you work as hard as the person next to you. You better not screw me. Don't make a sexual joke. I wasn't even gonna do... I think I'm gonna go to med school. I think that's a more secure option. I mean, my whole family is doctors. Well, my... My cousin taught me how to do make up. I thought I wanted to be a makeup artist. But then I decided that I'm making the right decision. Chi-monee! Hee-hee! Welcome to Legends of Dance! That's the energy I like to see. Now, let's get a quick recap of the rules, okay? In each round, two teams will dance set to a predetermined theme. All team members must be present, or their team will be... disqualified! The team that wins over the audience's heart the most will come one step closer to becoming Legends of Dance. Let's hear it for my mentor and yours, Ivan! Ivan, Ivan, Ivan... Bam! Thank you, thank you. Ivan, Ivan, Ivan... And stop. I'm gonna be on standby with my honest and sometimes soul-crushing critiques. But ultimately, you pick who wins, all right? All right, I'm out, peace out. First up, we've got Flow Nation versus TBD. Is your group name actually To Be Determined, or are you still trying to figure it out? I wanted Dark Shadows, so... Okay. First up, Flow Nation. Boo. You're just gonna sit there? You're not gonna stretch or anything? No, I'm fine, I'm good. Thank you, guys. Ivan, your thoughts? There was effort. All right, guys, bring it in. Let's keep the focus. This is what we've been training for. It's in the bag, yo. Okay, coming up next, and let's hear it for them, it's TBD! Hunter? TBD! -TBD. -TBD. -You're behind. -You're ahead. That was awesome. Good stuff, TBD. Excuse me, my little worm. Thank you. Now, let's hear the thoughts of our resident aficionado. Was it bad? No. Were they good? No. They have to learn their steps. Excellent, now it's time to put it for a vote. That's embarrassing. Let's get Flow Nation on up here. Let's get your hands nice and warm. It's time for us to vote. Let's hear it for Flow Nation. Let's hear it for TBD. That was really close. Ivan, will you please break this tie? In my opinion, tonight's victor, by a narrow margin, is TBD. Congratulations. TBD will be moving on to the next round. What the hell was that? You screwed everyone up. Me? No, no. Look, okay, I was a tad bit slow in the beginning. But I caught up. We were fine. Fine? Fine's not gonna cut it. Cheyenne's right. Fine is no help. Look. Let's see what Lance and his crew has in store for us today. I don't know, man. Doing backflips doesn't make you a good dancer. It just makes you a person that's really good at doing backflips. Yeah, but, like, really good at doing backflips. How you guys doing? Enjoying the show? Don't worry, I'll stay after and sign some Lance-graphs for you. Hat trick, three years, baby! Is this guy for real? If we're actually gonna win this thing, you're gonna have to work. Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m.? Yeah, no, can we make that 9:00? Seems like you're not really invested. Crap! Better watch where you're going, Hunter. Boom, sarcasm. What are you doing? Why are you making this so hard? And snap, and then roll down your body. Snap, roll down your body. Two, three. Set up, go. I can't hear you. I cannot hear you! Man. You and me, dance battle, right now. Jeb, I never turn down challenges, but I can't take advantage of a special-needs kid. Well, Lance... you might want to consider it, 'cause your mom did last night. She took care of all of my special needs. Let's dance, you little guy. -Go! -Go, Lance! Floor is yours. All right. Dance circle. Start out easy, got some floor work. Hype the crowd, hype the crowd. Okay. Yo, what is this? What is this? Al Roker here. And welcome back to the 5th Annual Special Olympics. -All right, Jeb. -All right, Jeb. -Come on, Jeb. -You got it. Okay, that's sit-ups, dude. That's not dancing. All right, "DDR," level 8, expert level. -What? Okay. -Yeah, yeah. Kelsey, Kelsey, hit it. What's he doing? All right. Hunter and Jeb forever! #Forever! -Yeah! -Yeah! All right! Lance. From the moment we met, I knew you were a "DDR" master. I felt the connection between us. -All right, okay... -And of course, it was all the things that you said and the way... All right, there's people here. Don't make it weird. Okay, sorry. You danced the steps. Thank you. I'm pretty good at duets. He's really embraced the camp. And it has nothing to do with me taking the hours away from him either. Has he made any friends? Yeah, he's making tons of friends. He even has a little ballerina inside of him. You're sure you're talking about my son? I mean... Campers, you have spoken. And the team that will be joining Dance-ish in the semifinals is... TBD! Nicely done. No, this is not happening! Recount, recount, recount! It's real, and it's raw, and we like that. Gather around, my little birdies. Your theme for the semifinals is... duets. Cheyenne! Cheyenne loves to duet, right, Cheyenne? Dude, that's French, right? Yeah. -What do I do with my chest? -You just leave it there. -What do you mean? -Try it, try it. -I am trying it. -Try it. Hey. Hey. -I saw that. -Yeah. -Can I talk to you? -Yes, you can. Yeah, yes, you can. Jeb, do you mind? Sorry, if you want to talk to Hunter about something, you might as well talk to me, because we don't keep any secrets from each other. That's our rule. That is not remotely true. This bond cannot be broken. Yes, it can. -Jeb. -Okay. I can take a hint. Just to be sure I was taking the hint correctly, you're saying you'd like alone time, without me? Okay. Sorry about that. Anyway, as you know, I'm an awesome dancer. But there's this one type of dance that, it's not like my... You know when there's two people, dance together... Dance together, I get it, yeah. Starts with a "D," ends with an "et." Involves two people, the "D" word. -The "D" word. -The "D" word. Yeah, "dork," you're being a dork right now. No, that wasn't the word I was thinking of. Look. Lance killed us last year at the couples dance. Okay? There was crying involved. Like, lots of crying, okay? Like, the type of crying where you can't breathe, you're, like, crying so much. Lots of crying. Yeah, look, that was last year, okay? I got an idea. What are we doing out here? You'll see. One, two, three. This is insane. Yeah. They're mating. -Right now? -Right now. They're getting down and dirty. I've never been good at dancing with a partner before. Maybe that's because you haven't had the right one. Follow my lead. Cheyenne, look, relax. Read my body, okay? How am I supposed to do that? Trust me. Get my hand. Look up. All right, now rock with me. My bad. It's all right. Look, it's my job as male to make us look good. That's sexist. No, it's leading. Definitely sexist. More so leading. You're a pretty good teacher. Yeah, I learned from my mom. Do you have to talk about your mom right now? Yeah, I felt that too. That was... Awesome. That was awesome. Yeah! TBD! -TBD! TBD! TBD! -Yeah! Now, that is how you bring it to the semifinals. Cheyenne, Hunter. The team that will be joining E=MC "we don't have to be good at math "because we're really good dancers" Squared is... TBD! Ladies and gentlemen, be safe tonight. Sayonara. Cheyenne, you learned how to tango. Good for you. But a little piece of advice. When you lose again this year, try not to cry. It's embarrassing. Jerk. Good luck. -What's up, guys? -Hey, what's up? What's up, man? No PDA, got it, good policy. Can I talk to you? Yeah, sure. Hunter, the other night was nice. I agree. But I can't let any distractions get in the way of winning Legends. We had a moment, and it as nice, but... I get it. No, I get it. I'm just here to do my hours, and there's no point of us getting caught up in anything. Give me your time sheet. I need to sign it. Right, almost forgot about that. Well, you got a lot on your mind with finals tonight. What are you doing? I'm gonna send it in. Wait, I'm done? 100 hours. Good job. Hey, Hunter. Yo, man, this summer's been crazy, bro. Miss you, Hunter. Congrats on finishing your hours. We're coming to bust you out. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, muchachas and amigas, the Finals! -Sanjana, Kenton. -Hey. Looking hot, buddy. This is going to be the best night of our lives! Let's go ahead and turn it over to one of our judges, Ivan, the guru of dance. How are you feeling tonight? Really excited about tonight? Yes. I'm very intrigued about what TBD is gonna be pulling out of the bag to go up against Lance's crew. What the hell, Lance? Lance? Who's Lance, man? -Shit. -What's up, bro? What's up, man? What are you guys doing here? Yo, we came to get you out, man. Everyone's waiting. Party with your name on it, man. Before we continue on, let's go ahead and meet our special guest judges. First up, it's the Prince Charming of dance. It's Mr. Bruno Tortellini. You're welcome. By the way, the name is Tonioli, dance and reality television royalty. It's a pleasure to meet you. I know. Jeb, where's Hunter? What? I don't know. I thought he was with you. Your little boy toy gone missing? I heard he finished his hours, and then he bounced. You didn't know that, did you? She didn't know. But, like, Hunter wouldn't flake on you guys, would he? That would just be so terrible, because all dancers must participate in the finals. You know that, cutie pie. Lance Camp. Anyway, it's a true honor to meet... Cheyenne! Miss Lele Pons. How you feeling about the competish? Yeah, I don't know where I am, and I don't know how I got here. If this is a prank, I don't like it, 'cause I'm usually the one that pranks people. That's funny. That's hilarious, Lele. Anyways, ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together. It's the moment we've all been waiting for. So we came to get you out, bro? Yeah? Yo, we should light some shit on fire. No, no. Prison break, right? No, it's not even worth it. Guys, I can't just leave. Sure you can. I guess so. I think you forgot to get some off. Okay. You ready to bust out of here, man? -Get in the car. -Freedom! Let's go, baby. Without further ado, I... You can't. Hunter's not here. You got to stall. -Okay. -Stall. Okay, I'll do that. I'm gonna do that for you. It's actually kind of annoying. It's annoying. That's what I said. How would they know it if you forgot to say it? What did I tell you about correcting me in front of other people? I wasn't correcting you. I was just adding some more information that you forgot to say. Yo, where's that bitch Hunter? Good question. He left. No, no, he didn't. The Hunter I know wouldn't do that. He wouldn't do that to me. Us. Jeb, I saw him. He finished his hours, and he bailed. You know you can't compete without a full team, right? Yeah, I know. And I think I would be reincarnated as a hawk. I'm a bird of prey. In my day-to-day, I operate like a bird of prey. I've got a beak, and I've got great eyes. That's enough, Dougie. Thank you, Doug. I got it. Excuse me, campers. I have an announcement to make. It saddens me to say this, but TBD will be unable to perform tonight because they do not have a full team. And therefore, they will have to forfeit the competition. E=MC "I don't have to do any math because I'm a really good dancer" Squared... God, I hate that name. -It's terrible. -I hate it. Are this year's Legends of Dance champions! That's my baby! Three years in a row! Legends! Legends! I'm in the books, baby! I'm in the books! Yo, what up, guys? This is Lance coming at you live with the #SpecialAnnouncement. And it looks like I'm the first ever three-year Legends of Dance champion, son! We're living proof that with #hardwork, #anythingispossible. Follow your dreams. Let's go, let's go. I earned it. TBD, good job, guys. Told you. I can't believe he actually left. Yeah, it's 'cause he's a little punk bitch. I'm speechless. I literally have no speech right now. I thought he was our friend. I thought this meant more to him. I thought he cared about this as much as we do. I thought... shit. I'm creating speech right now, aren't I. I'm speeching... Speaking... crap. Hey. I'm here. I made it. No, you didn't. We had to forfeit. It's over. Hey, Hunter. You owe me an apology, little guy. -For what? -For your selfishness. I was supposed to humiliate you, and you took that away from me. You know what, asshole? You're lucky we got disqualified, okay? How so? Why would I be lucky? You think you actually had a chance against me. Have you seen you? Have you seen Lance? You suck at dancing. I rule. I'm the shit, bro. What's that? Little Hunter... Little Hunter doesn't have a comeback, does he? Nah, you're scared. You know what, asshole? I got a comeback. TBD versus the name of your stupid-ass team. Tomorrow night. Let's give the people what they wanted, right? We already won, Hunter. It's over. #Over. I'm cool. Now, all of these people with their phones out recording you right now will know that you turned down a challenge. Lance, we're gonna do it, right? Chip, shut the hell up. Look, you're on. But good luck getting your team together, because the last I heard, they hate your ass. Give me my trophy. Yo, delete all those videos. Hey. All right, look... I know I owe the team a lot of apologies. But listen, I wanted to come to you first, my bunkmate, and most importantly, my bro. Would you hear me out? All right. All right, honestly, man, when I first came to camp and I saw that I was bunked with you, I was thinking, "Dear God, why? Why? Why me?" But since that day, I realized, yes, you can be a dork at some times, but I've grown to love you, man, 'cause you're yourself. You're not afraid to stick up for yourself and your friends. And I figured out, that's what it takes to make it. So I'm coming to you and telling you that I can't do this without you. So are you with me? Hunter. You had me at "bunkmate." So... are you in, man? Sweet. That's so sweet. Guys... I love you. And you. So... are we doing this? Yeah, I mean, we already learned the routine, so... Yeah, I mean, it's my last year at camp. Got nothing to lose. I'm in. That's it? Yeah. I thought about it, and I'm in. Do you need me to explain why? -No. -No. 'Cause I can. Sanjana, we're good. -Please. -Keep it right there. The question is, what's Cheyenne gonna say? Okay. Good luck. I challenged him as a member of TBD. Why would you do that? You're not a member. You left. And that was a huge mistake. Plus, why would we compete in an unofficial competition? Look, Cheyenne, dance isn't about competition, okay? It's about self-expression. Yeah, it's about letting off steam when our parents expect us to be perfect. It's a way to be creative. Or feel unique. Or tell the world you hope the robots do take over because deep down you trust them more than the humans! Just as a... that's just an example of what we mean. I saw you kiss that girl. Listen, Cheyenne. Yes, her lips touched mine. But I pulled away. I promise, true story. Why should I believe anything you say? You don't have to. I mean, it's not about me. It's about us, as a team. I think you want this as much as we do, maybe even more. This doesn't mean I don't hate you. I'm super aware of that. But okay, screw it. Let's beat that bitch. That's crazy. That is exactly what I was just going to say. Let's go! Hey, Jeb. Come on, we're heading over to costumes. We're going to the closet. Guys, Ivan doesn't know that we're here, so we kind of want to keep a low profile. But this is the finals we've all been waiting for. Let's make some noise for our teams! It's gonna get so hot in here, you're gonna be able to light a match. Why would I light a match? So you don't burn yourself. That's why I'll light a match? So I won't burn myself? Whatever. Think about it, think about it. Let's hear it for Lance and his crew! Lance, Lance! Hey, all the ladies, check him! Come on! Watch this! Come on! Higher, higher! Yeah, baby! Move! Get out of my way. Useless. I won, yeah! I'm the best, baby! #LanceCamp! TBD are shit! Yes, yes, yes, yes. Get lost! Up next is the team fighting for sweet, sweet redemption. Let's hear it for TBD! All right. You guys ready to go out there and show them who we are? -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. All right, let's do this, on three. TBD! -TBD! -TBD, let's go! Hey, hey, let's go, TBD! Yeah, Kenton! You, baby, you, baby, yo! It's not that good. Seriously? Come on, Em! Let's go, Emily! Go crazy! Go crazy! Champs for life. I mean #Champs4Life. Crap. You found the little Mini James in you. Let's party! Guys, guys, stop. I'm trying to have a beautiful moment here. Enough with your tonsil hockey. One, two, three! Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight. Walk up the stairs, stride, walk down. Walk up the stairs, no, walk down. Walk up the stairs... Walk down. Walk up the stairs. Tricky-ass stairs.
