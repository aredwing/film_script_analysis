 

                        Hello. Good evening. We are here to talk to you about relationships. This is not our story. Don't think that love has changed a lot since then. The story of love affairs is everlasting. Not so everlasting... Everlasting Antonakis, everlasting. Have you forgotten our story? I was chasing the tram for you with a bicycle for two hours. And this is what happened to me. What if you hadn't caught it? What if you hadn't seen me? What if I hadn't seen you and met someone else? Then what? I would be spared! Haven't we all wondered what our lives would be like if we had found our soul mate? Haven't we all wondered whether things happen by chance? Every minute, every moment, our slightest decision may change our lives. I don't believe in fate. My sweet Antonakis... A love story, any time, at any age... What is simpler than that? The truth is that the simplest, is also the hardest... -Hi, Mr. Christos. -Hey you're late. How are you? -How am I? I suffer from love. -Love? I'm in love too but I don't act this way. Yeah right... -Bye Vasilis, bye. -Bye! Oh, Mr. Sotiris, I forgot all about you! I passed by your shop and didn't stop... I am in love Mr. Sotiris and I've lost my mind. Do you mind if I deliver tomorrow? Alright, stop yelling... and it's such a beautiful day today. I'm coming around right now. God damn it... Hey love. How's my baby? Babe... See, a delivery came up and I will be late for an hour or so... OK stop yelling love... don't yell. I won't be long. I am wrapping up with deliveries and will be there soon, ok? Do you love me? She loves me... No. I don't miss a relationship, company, partner or any other disgusting term... It's so obsessive. Why should I feel guilty for feeling good about myself? Of course you'd argue that it's nice to love someone, to have a companion, but... You're asking me to name "fear" as love? Is that it? So, it's not about being in love and certainly not about loving someone. This is about compromise, insecurity, compromise and dependence, and many things that we all bear by nature and that others force upon us. Social conventions. Besides, I have all these things... and surely at some point I would sell you out for a sweeping love affair. What? No? Ok... I take the last one back. Take a look around us, Lonesome. Everything changes. Aren't we fine? What is it? Excuse me, I'm spilling my guts to you and you wanna pee? Lonesome. No way, I'm exhausted... There are many things I want too, but I don't act like that. Lonesome? I'll make you a deal. You'll pee in the yard just for tonight and I promise you tomorrow we will take a very long walk. Agreed? Come on, don't look at me this way, don't do this to me. Don't make me go out tonight... I'm begging you, please. This is an "if"... that you don't know what it will bring and where it will lead you. You're conniving and ungrateful and like all females you're only trying to get what you want. Yeah right. I don't see what's the difference between you and any bitch. From a broad at least I get sex. You can't even do that. Really now, what do you offer in this relationship? I'll tell you what. You give nothing back. Ok, pee here. Surely it's not anybody else's fault. It's mine... The asshole. I only give in this relationship. And starting tomorrow forget everything. the bones, the long walks, everything... And I'm gonna ask the vet to come by and give you the triple shot. I should have gotten a cat. Yeah, right. Lonesome! I'll make you a deal. You'll pee in the yard just for tonight and I promise you tomorrow we will take a very long walk. Agreed? Come on, don't look at me this way, don't do this to me. Don't make me go out tonight... I'm begging you, please. Every moment, every minute, the slightest decision... ...can change your life. You're the best female I've ever met, certainly the most faithful and understanding. I promise tomorrow we will take the longest walk of your life. Ok Lonesome? Go pee outside and I'll be back in a while. Come on girl... Is it alive? You can go, you don't have to wait. What are you talking about? How could I do that? Besides I didn't want to go where I was going in the first place. Not that I prefer being here. I was going to a wedding reception. I don't usually go out looking like this. Even though today something was telling me to stay in. Do you believe in fate? -No. -I do... Labrador Retriever? -German Shepherd. -Ah, a Shepherd. What's her name? -Lonesome. -I'm more of a cat person myself. Not that I don't like dogs. I like them very much. Do you want me to shut up? I tend to talk too much when upset... -I'm Christina. -Demetris. Doctor, what's going on? How is she? Please say something good... -Relax. The dog will be fine. -Really? Doctor, thank you so much... I told him that everything will be ok and that I couldn't bear the guilt if she died... It's not my dog. I'm the one who hit her... -Tell me. -She has some broken ribs. I managed to stop the internal bleeding. If you got here later, she would have died. Mainly, if she hadn't had the accident and if I hadn't treated her, we would have missed the massive tumor she had. -Tumor? -Tumor? She's a very lucky animal. She wouldn't have lived more than a year. She will have some discomfort, but it's a small price to pay compared to what would have happened to her. Lonesome will be with you for a long time. So, in a sense I saved her... -What do you do? -I'm a director. I mean, I work for a production agency, mainly advertising. Do you think that someone from your work or your environment has reason to... No. -Are you married? -No. -You live alone? -Yes. -Security systems? Alarm? -No, none of that. -Your mistake... -What's my mistake? I was in my house at 11 o'clock at night. What exactly was my mistake? -Security systems? Alarm? -No, none of that. -Your mistake... -I took the dog out for a walk, we had an accident and then had to rush to the vet. That's why I wasn't here. That saved you... You should thank God they didn't find you inside. This is a vicious gang. They have broken into five houses this month alone. Times have changed... You are lucky to be alive. Try to put this whole thing behind you as an unfortunate event. You happened to be in the wrong place the wrong time. -Good morning. Can I speak with Christina? -This is she. -Hi. It's Demetris. -Hi Demetris. -Hi. -Tell me. Well, I called to tell you... I mean I called to thank you. Not just for helping me with Lonesome... who by the way is doing much better... Listen, hold on, listen... Speak! -She's much better. -That's good. Yes it is. But even better, because of you I was saved from a dangerous situation. That's why I called to thank you. The night we rushed Lonesome to the vet, they broke into my house. I came back to find my house all messed up. And now, two days later, I feel a little better and called to thank you because if we hadn't met, I could have died. I see. Criminals broke in my house. They robbed me. -Yes. -What do you mean "yes"? -I was fired... -Excuse me? An hour ago I was fired and I can't follow a word you say, not that I care, to tell you the truth, because an hour ago I was told that starting tomorrow I will be unemployed... Which means what? It means that I have to leave my apartment, find a new job, and we all know how hard that is, cut all expenses and borrow money. This situation makes me doubt myself and feel inadequate and absolutely unnecessary and helpless. Do you understand how hard it is for me to talk to you right now? And surely, it's something that we're all used to nowadays, I am not the first, nor the last to lose her job in Greece these days. But I'm very good at what I do. I am really good. And I find it unfair that I'm deprived of the right to do what I'm good at. I'm an architect. Do you know how difficult it is to do your job in this country? Nobody builds anymore... What the hell am I supposed to do now? -Hello? -Do you want to go for a cup of coffee? -What's his name? -Yannis. -Have you been together long? -A year. -A good year? -Look Demetris, I'm glad your dog is fine and glad that our encounter saved you from a dangerous situation, but I'm messed up. As time goes on and I realie what happened I get furious. If last year someone told me that I would be in this place today I wouldn't believe it. I wouldn't have believed either that they would break into my house like that, nor that I would meet you. I'm only trying to have a normal conversation, so that you won't think how bad things are. -Yes, but they are bad! -Does that help in any way? -I'll leave... I won't let them ruin me. -Who? -The ones running the country, who turned it into the cesspool it is and who are responsible for the fact that I don't know how to react... -You're not well with your boyfriend, huh? -No. -No, I'm not. -It shows. -Do you have a relationship? -No. Nor do I want one. I believe that some people are made to have relationships others are not. I agree. Besides, for us guys is completely different than you girls. -What do you mean? -For us men it's easier. Because of time. -Because of time? -Yes. Most women your age are anxious. Marriage, kids, security. -My age? -Yeah. Not that you grow old. Which you do, but I'm not referring to you personally, but to women in general. Women have a biological clock that starts to tick after the age of 30. Add the hormonal pressures, the time constraints and the social stresses so you give way more easily, and in general you're a little more... -Broken? -Not broken. Complex... Its natures fault, not mine. I'm a friend of your sex. -Oh, you... -What? You're sort of an... asshole. Too bad. That went well... Marisa? I'll pay you later... -Ok, I may have sounded sort of an asshole. -Soft of? It doesn't start... -Have you put it in neutral? -You have your own opinion for women, obviously you have issues with your mother, like most Greek men, you just haven't met the woman who will show you that things are quite different. You choose bimbos who can neither think, nor process anything. It's so simple, so shallow, it's just elementary. -Is this why you got mad and took off? -This morning I had my life planned out. I had a job, a relationship, everything was normal and in order. The last thing I need right now is bullshit from a jerk who has no idea about how to hit on a woman. It won't start! So if I said all these things differently you may have liked it... This is my grandmother's antique car, and I am driving it illegally... Nothing seems to be going well today. I may have liked it, maybe. Good, tell me what can I do to convince you to go for a drink sometime, somewhere nice and with the promise that I won't piss you off. To push! The clutch. Let go of the clutch! Gas, step on the gas! More gas! More gas, step on it girl! -What, you're leaving again? -Shouldn't I? Why should you? Aren't you the one who wants to sleep alone so you don't feel oppressed? Yes, but its daytime. So it's not an actual sleep-over. -Besides, we can make an exception. -For me? Yeah. Is it wrong? I just needed to stretch, but I liked the sound of that... -Really? -Really. So you tricked me. -Is that a barrel organ? -Yes, he passes by every morning. Love doesn't need time,, it needs speed. It's like running. Reality is love's enemy. You are trying to escape reality. Truth is hunting you down and you run. Running to stay ahead. Oh, my favorites... Thank you so much. -Pralines... -Pralines! I could eat all of them now, but I shouldn't. I will save them for tonight, after my boy goes to sleep. -I brought a movie to watch if you like. -I can't. I have to make dinner. -What day is it? -Wednesday. Wednesday... Iron, lentils. What time is it? I have a little time before the school bus brings him over. Some tea? Yes. You can't imagine how bored I am to make dinner, then help him do his homework, and then play with him, by the evening he has me exhausted... He's an awesome kid! The other day he asked whether his dad is coming back. He was going to ask me sooner or later. What was I to answer? I am sure he understands. He's such a bright kid. It needs to be handled delicately. I need to handle it smartly, calmly and properly. Mom? It's me, Demetris. He'll come back. I am sure. Demetris is the only thing worrying me. This boy is taking a toll on me. He's very wild and feisty. His teachers call every day to tell me about the problems he causes. I had a talk with him the other day. He knows his father left us. I told him again that he will come back, but he's not stupid. He's five years old. He understands. I don't care though. I can handle it. I raise him by myself anyway. I'd really like to know where the bastard has gone. What kind of man abandons his wife and child? Maybe he's even dead... who knows? Even if he's dead, I can't forgive him. I had a life too, my career, and now I have to do a hundred jobs to raise this brat. Mom? The only thing I want for him is not to make my mistakes when he grows up. Not to put his trust in any relationship that could hurt him. To be able to stand on his own two feet, on his own. He's got the power, and the ability. He shouldn't expect anything from anybody... Don't you agree? Yes. -Well, I've got to go. -No. Stay for a while. Sorry if I bother you with my problems. I still have time before the boy comes. Look, I'm reading this book... It's so great. The 80s we're living now is the worst decade, the most destructive. I've been saying it but nobody believes me. Do you want me to read you some? Yes. It's a huge leap, but she's not oppressive and she's not like the others. And in the end, let's try it. What do we have to lose? I know, if you weren't a dog, you would rightly mock me. But, between you and me, we are better with her, right? Isn't it? I found a job. And why is that something bad that we have to talk about? That is very rare, we have to celebrate it and then make out... It's not in Athens. Where is it? -Yannis' family has an architectural firm... -Your ex-boyfriend? -Yes. -You still talk to him? Sometimes, yes. I didn't know that. -He knew I was looking for a job... -And he wants to help? And where is this job? It's exactly what I studied for and what I like to do. I've been looking for six months and I can't find anything. And it seems like I will never be able to find any job. I can't borrow any more money from my family, nor be a burden to you, nor my friends, I don't have a place of my own, my stuff are in boxes and I don't know what tomorrow will bring. For how long can I do this? I'm not 20 anymore. It's in Italy, in Rome. In Rome? Yes, his family owns an architectural firm there and they travel back and forth. It's a technical firm that renovates buildings in Italy. -You want to go? -The question is whether I can stay here. You expect me to ask you not to leave... They haven't seen such a wave of immigration since the 50s. Everyone is leaving like crazy. When do you think you'll be leaving? Can we pay? That's what you're waiting for. For me to ask you not to leave. -No. -But you are thinking about it. -Where's the waitress? -Christina... Do you mind if I leave? I'm not feeling very... Christina? Christina, wait! For six months now, you are the one who is working, sets our program, you never back out on anything! Not even once! And once I have a problem, you don't care at all. Why shouldn't I think of my work, my life, my future, myself? -I don't want to depend on anyone. -That's because I didn't ask you to stay? It's because everything changes and I don't feel safe. -Is it my fault everything changes? -No, but it would be easier if I didn't feel lonely all the time. What do you want me to say? That I made you a spare key today? Will it make a difference? No matter what I do, you don't trust me. When did I not trust you? When did I ask for more than you can give? Then, why are we fighting? Because I'm scared? Because I don't say what you want to hear? I may be more in love than you, but never admit it. -Why not? -Because when in love, people say bullshit. And I'm very much in love. And I don't want you to leave, I want to be with you all the time, and I can't imagine life without you, but is this all enough for you to make such a decision? -Yes, they may very well be. -Why? You have all these from me, why do you want to hear them? Because I'm pregnant you idiot, that's why! And I'm in love with you too, and I'm scared of my feelings for you. And I'm afraid I'll make a mistake and regret it later. That's why. -I have many weaknesses. -Me too. -I mean, I have too many. -Yes, I know. -Do you want this child? -If I'm alone, no. The only thing I want, is you. Whatever that may include. -With or without a child. -Just hearing this, is enough for me. I'm surprised I'm even saying that. But for the sake of moving on, can you take this for granted, or do I have to repeat it every time? -No, you have to say it every time. -Oh, here we go now... -I'm scared. -Me too. Very much. -We may be making a mistake. -Maybe, but since we love each other... let's go through with it and we'll see what happens. That's where I stand. -And if we fail? -Are you sure we won't fail if we're apart? You're right. And if in the future we get bored of each other? No, you will never get bored of me! -And if sex stops being so good? -At some point that will happen. And if we start acting like those couples I make fun of? Then you will stop making fun of them. And what will we do with our jobs? Why do I have to have an answer for everything? -Because you're the man. -Now I'm the man. When we met I was a neurotic, an asshole, a chauvinist and now I'm a man. Yes, cause now I'm not feeling well, and I want you to be the strong one. And what will we do when I don't feel well? -Then I will be the strong one for you. -Really? Ok, I like that. The fact that my left side feel numb, what does it mean? -You're having a heart attack. -Heart attack? Too many changes! Lonesome, I'm leaving! Lonesome? What's wrong girl? Lonesome? Come on, get up. Lonesome? Lonesome! Lonesome! Get up! Lonesome! What's wrong, sweetie? Lonesome! Come on, get up! Oh, yes... The loss... it's hard. At some point we all lose something we love. Sometimes even our self. And at that time, you feel so alone... I can't bear this. -Please Antonakis, can we stop for a while? -What's wrong Elenitsa? Come on girl, what's wrong? Guys, can we stop for a while? Do you want some water? I said stop! Demetraki... -I like calling you Demetraki. -I like hearing it. -Can I tell you something? -What is it? -Isn't this nice? -Very much. -Demetris? -Yes, love... I love you. We're fine, grandma, but we're expecting a couple over for dinner and I'm a wreck. Should I put oregano or not? Demetris, come help me out! Lonesome has made a mess here! Grandma, can I call you tomorrow, cause now I'm losing my head? We'll talk. Bye. Yes, man, I see it. I'm afraid this is only the beginning. Yes, sure. Do you have to ask? We'll reschedule for some other time. Ok, bye. Excuse me, have you seen what's going on out there? I refuse to. All roads leading downtown are blocked. -Aren't they coming? -How can they come? -Then why I am cooking like crazy? -How could they have known, Christina? Are you serious? There's chaos out there, and you worry cause they aren't coming? -Christina? -Can you put the baby to sleep, please? Can you tell me why you have tantrums all the time? -I'll be fine. -I miss things too, but I don't act like this. What do you miss? Tell me. You miss your job, your friends, to get out of the house even for a while? -You are the one obsessed with the kid and don't want to do anything. -Because there's nothing to do. Cause I'm going crazy locked inside the house, because I miss my job, my friends, I miss being free to say whatever I want, I miss not worrying all the time about the baby and the mistakes I may make, I miss not having to live prescheduled, preset, in a sterile environment... I miss me! -Do you know what I miss? -I don't care about you now, only myself. I miss being alone whenever I want, not having to explain myself for everything, I miss not feeling guilty for having a job and for loving it, I miss not worrying about you 24/7, I even miss jerking off whenever I want. And most of all I miss my girlfriend. My girlfriend! -Come on, sweetie. -Come here, darling. What is it? I told the truth. Was I wrong? You're the same shit as her! The bottom line is... That I don't miss all these things more than I would miss you if I didn't have you. -I'm sorry. -I'm sorry too. -I miss being your girlfriend too. -You are. As far as your dick is concerned... -Do you really feel oppressed? -Yes, sometimes. Ok... You're free to play with it whenever you want. -Thank you. -Every day? -In the morning shower. -Even when we have had sex? -This has nothing to do with it. -So you're a wanker. -Yes, a professional one. Are you jealous? -No. I mean, yes. I don't know. -Do you want to go out for a drink? -Demetris, are you serious? -Like old times. -And what about the baby? Do you know how long it's been since the last time I've had sex in a car? -It was fun. -Why didn't you want to go to your place? -Is there someone there? -No, I just like to sleep alone. And if you came, you might have wanted to stay and... then I wouldn't know how to tell you that I don't want you to. You were afraid I would become a burden? I have to wake up at 7:30, make breakfast for my two children, send them off to school and go to work. Are you divorced? No. We don't go out much with my husband. There are the children, the house, our engagements... That's it. I'm glad to hear that there are "happily" married couples. I go out on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and he goes out Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. -What about Sundays? -Sundays are dedicated to the family. You know... Grandparents, family dinners... -Love. -Yes, that's what we call it. See, you didn't have to worry. If you want... we can do this again. Why not? The day after tomorrow I will stop by the bar. If you're there... ...we'll talk. -I may be there. So, I'm leaving. -It was my pleasure. -Mine too. Do you have a reason why you don't want to sleep with another person? -I feel oppressed. -You're lucky to have this luxury. -Yes, I know. Goodnight. -Goodnight. Christina? -I love you. -Me too. Of course, sleeping together is essential for a couple. That's how every day ends and the next day begins. It's very important to agree with your partner on sleeping. -Don't you agree Antonakis? -18.250! -What's that? -Nights! -What nights? -That I haven't slept alone. Big deal to sleep alone. You can stretch, toss and turn, you do anything you want. Long forgotten good days... We can cut down our salaries, we can get cheaper equipment, cheaper cameras, we can cut down every production's budget, keep only the ones we need. -We can't shut down. -We can't go on. Why not? They still make productions, people want to see... Panayiotis, it's not about the money. Really. -It's because I can't bear not working. -Neither can I. But I don't want to go to jail. I can't sustain a studio with deficits. Either I shut down now, or sooner or later the bank will confiscate it. You have to realie that there are no more clients, advertisements, product, there's no demand and offer. Things aren't what they used to be. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. So daddy is once again an unemployed director. Thus a nobody. There goes another spoonful! But mommy found a job and we're happy for her. Aren't we? Yes we are. We're happy because at last she does what she wants and what she likes. Come on! Another spoonful! And where did mommy get a job? Where? At her ex-boyfriend's firm, Yannis. A very kind and very disgusting man, right? You don't want any more? Come on girl! Well done! Now that mommy has a kid with the untalented and unemployed director, Yannis felt sorry for her and offered to help her. So, since daddy can't fulfill mommy's needs, mommy went to work for her ex. And daddy? Daddy can't do anything... So he pretends to be a fool. He is jealous and jumpy because he can't cope with all this... And he's a looser. Come on. I'm sorry... For all the things we might do to you without meaning to... And that you will bear for the rest of your life. Forgive me... Do you want to go out for a drink? Or for me to take you home? Demetris will pick me up. -How does he feel about you working here? -Not good. But he tries not to show it. If he still had his job, it would be easier. -The kid? -Yannis, thank you for your help, but don't ask about things you don't care about. Who knows? Maybe I care... Demetris? Let me introduce you to Yannis... Yannis, this is Demetris. Demetris, what are you doing? Are you fucking him? -Ok... You probably don't. -It's not my fault you chose this job, nor that you don't have it anymore. -I'm jealous. -Figure it out on your own! -Ok, I'm sorry. I've become obsessive. I sit alone all day and fuss, that's why I act this way. I'm jealous, I want you and I want you to show it too! I show it all the time! What else do you want? -I want more! -You're crazy. -Where's the kid? -Sofia came over to watch her. We can't make ends meet and you call the babysitter, who we fired... What's this? For me? I thought we could go out for dinner and then for a drink. Even if we can't make ends meet. For me this is more important. -What is it? -You didn't have plans for dinner or drinks. You bought it, because you knew what would happen, and you wanted to make me feel bad about it. You didn't answer whether you're fucking him... -Demetris... -Will you get all hysterical? -Yes. -Do you want to listen to some music? You dickhead, stuck-up asshole! Mom? -Stay still! -We're almost done... She fell off her chair and hit her head at the corner of the table. Stay still, girl. Look at me. Mom, no. Don't take this off. The doctor is coming soon and... -Demetris... -Mom? -My sweet little boy... -Don't worry, everything will be fine. Why did you cut your hair like that? What have you done with your hair? You don't like it? It will grow again. I like it no matter what you do with it. Let's go home. I'm tired. Mom? Mom! Mr. Demetris, its Katerina, your mother's caretaker. It's urgent. I can't reach you anywhere. Your mother... We had an accident. You have to come immediately. She's at the hospital,, she had a heart attack and it's not good. ...one, clear. Mr. Demetris,, please call me. Where are you? I don't know what to do. Three, two, one, clear! We are given the gift of life only once... Like a unique opportunity. And what do we do with it? Instead of living it, we drag it here and there and ruin it. Organized society, organized human relationships. But if they're organized, how can they be relationships? Relationship means encounter, surprise,, the birth of emotions. How can you organize emotions? Unemployment has risen to 16,,6%... Ominous scenarios for the Greek economy... Businessmen swamped in debts... The IMF... Isn't obvious? An unexpected state of poverty always affects a relationship. Everyone has his dreams and it's hard to realize that you weren't raised this way. In our days, poverty in Greece was a given, due to wars, we didn't lose something suddenly. -The fact that it's sudden is the problem. You become distant, you feel suffocated. You are in denial. You need time and patience to realize and adapt. Either way, the human kind always manages to find a solution. Of course! Humans are like cockroaches, we always survive. It needs training, knowledge and awareness. And tenacity, too. Just think how worst it would be if you had a family. At least now, what you have saved is only for yourself. You don't have to pay rent, upkeep, no kids, family, no commitments... Most Greek men would like to be in your shoes now. Why don't I find this comforting? Because you lost your mother a few months ago and its normal to feel like shit. -But it will get better. -It would be different, if I had my job. You're a director, not a clerk. Something will come up. There are no more productions. Even if I wanted to produce something, I can't. The whole country is in the same state. Take a look around you. Maria... So, if I want to keep my job, I have to go. They have a convention upstairs today and they're driving me crazy. -What are you doing on New Year's Eve? -Nothing. Why? There's a party here with some clients and I have to be here. -Do you want to come? -Your husband? I don't know. But since I'm inviting you, it means that I don't care. I'm off. -Tonight? -Tonight? It's Tuesday. You're right. I'm sorry. My son has a fever and... Tomorrow is better. But if you want something, call me. If I had a normal relationship, things might be better, right? Yes. But they might also be worse. Three, two, one... Happy New Year! -Happy New Year. -Happy New Year. -It's a bit boring, huh? -Very boring. Are you Demetris? Yes. Have we met? Sorry, but I'm a bit drunk. Do you know that you've ruined my life? With Maria we are one of the couples that you admire when you see it. We have our home, our children, our jobs, our cars, we're successful. Everyone envies us. -Do you know what "15 years" means? -No. She likes you very much. -Yes, but she won't leave you. -Maria and I are both equally guilty. Then why am I the one who ruined your life? Because of you, every day, I think what a liar and coward I am for tolerating this whole situation. Just because I don't have the guts to be alone. Do you know how hard it is to live with this thought every day? Please, find something else to spend your time... And let me be as I'm used to. Monday, Wednesday, Friday is hers, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday is yours. That's how I met her. What makes you think she won't leave again? It's not about leaving... ...but about coming back. Hi. -Happy New Year. -Happy New Year. Demetris, let me introduce my husband, Yorgos. -Hello. -Hi Demetris, Happy New Year. Happy New Year. -Great party, huh? -Yes, they do it every year. -Yes, we know, we are neighbours. -Honey, Anna wants to know when... -Hi. Happy New Year. -Babe, this is Maria and Yorgos. -Hi. -Hello. -Nice to meet you. -Likewise. -They are here just... -Neighbours. That's nice. -Do you do it on purpose? -What? -Why did you come? -I didn't come alone. And I don't get your question. I live next door. I can't go out one night with my husband? Christina is very smart and will figure it out. Figure out what? Demetris relax. It only happened once and no one will find out. I don't want to hurt her. As you said, it only happened once and it's not worth it. I said to see if you will correct me. If you can remember, it was more than once. Don't worry. We were both in a weird phase and it's over. If we want to repeat it, you have my number. Happy New Year. Spyros, we have defaulted! Happy New Year. That was it. Whatever we were taught and believed in... is wrong. -Bye! -Good night. And we threw a party... so we don't think about it. We are imbeciles. Everything happened under our noses and we didn't see it coming. Come on, let's go. And do you know why we are imbeciles? -Christina, you're drunk. -Don't interrupt me, honey. Because supposedly we didn't know, and we trusted everyone. But deep inside we are responsible as well, aren't we? -You are very drunk, please... -This crisis is a bit like relationships. -Christina? -Am I right, darling? It's like when you suddenly realize that the other is cheating on you, and you feel so belittled and ashamed. So helpless... The worst is when you try to find out where did you go wrong. Because you probably did. Don't you agree, Spyros? That's when you feel totally humiliated... For fighting for something that may never have existed... And for not wanting it as much as you thought. Most of all you don't want to believe that it's over and you've lost. That's the problem in this crisis, I found it! That you're forced to face something that you didn't want. And that's very cruel, isn't it? -Let's go home. -Maria is very charming. For how long? Happy New Year. Thank you. Always the same. Man, woman, love, sex, breaking-up and crying. The same old story, almost boring. -I would love to live all these again! -When did you break up? Antonakis, you have forgotten! I think that your reaction is a bit extreme. Of course. You're on Demetris' side. Men are jerks, honey! They're money down the drain! -Elenitsa, won't you shut up? -Why should I? What will you do? You will leave me? Those days are gone, Antonakis. Shut your mouth now. Our granddaughter is breaking up and you are dancing? She should do what she feels. If she thinks she can't continue living like this, good for her. -That's what you think? -Christina... You and Demetris are two people that... That you can't find a love like yours, that's what he wants to say! Listen, our house is yours, you can stay here with the kid, until you decide what to do. I won't tell you that you mustn't break up because you have a child. But do you think that you will find another love like this? You see what you did? I missed my song! Pawnshop The town center is in ruins due to the crisis. Athens is now a deserted town. Every day the scenery gets worse. Shops and malls are shutting down. People's lives are changing. The problems arising from recession increase. It is essentially a new era. A city in ruins,, inapproachable. People don't know how to react to this. A generation that has never experienced something similar. -Is that ok? -Yes, but you don't have to give them all now, I can borrow from my grandmother... -She won't pay my daughter's daycare. And I want to pay every expense for the child. I'm saying it because I know that you're under a lot of pressure. No pressure. I got a deposit from my job. -The vet came over. -Why? -Because she's 11... -And what did he say? That we should start preparing ourselves... Are you giving her the medication? -What do you think? -If she doesn't take them on time, she gets tachycardia and that's why she's down. She takes medication on time. She's down because she's old. If she gets worse, he thinks that it's better to put her down. I went to see a specialist. What kind of specialist? A psychologist, for the kid, to see how should I handle this situation. Without me? How much was the session? I want to pay that too. Or did you tell the doctor that the kid's father is useless and doesn't give a shit? She misses you a lot. I miss her too. Very much. Tomorrow she can sleep over, if you want. We can set up a temporary schedule, so that the child knows what's going on. How can the child know what's going on, when you don't? Please, don't put her in the middle of all this. -But she is. -We have to make sure we don't hurt her. You're leaving me because I cheated, cause I don't earn enough or are you simply bored? Because I'm with a man who does nothing, in fact he doesn't know if he wants me. -He's just afraid to admit it. -So it's my fault. I'm telling you how I feel. You're ridiculous. Thanks. At the first difficulty, you got scared and chickened out. The first? Have you realized how long I've been saying that we're not good? Have you realized how many times I've asked you to spend time with me? I wanted to. But you've become so neurotic and hysterical and you only want to show me how useless I am. -There we go again. Your alibi for everything. The house, my work, everything. You need to control and approve everything and I have to apologize for everything. For not having a job, for not earning money... When did I complain about money? Why do you think everything is about money? -Is that our problem? -That too. And not that sexually you don't even want to look at me? Not that you are stuck in a relationship and even now you don't realize how shitty it has become? -I am the one who doesn't want to break up! That's why you cheated on me? It's always going to come to that, right? Yes. No matter how many times I say "I'm sorry" and that it meant nothing? How was it? -Don't do that. -Why? Was it good? Christina... -Different? -Yes. How many times? A few. -Would you rather I hadn't admitted it? -Yes. Could you live with it? If I fucked someone, who didn't mean anything to me... While you waited for me, could you live with that? No. Not if I was still in love with you. -If you weren't? -Yes, because I wouldn't care. So, you're asking me not to be in love with you. I'm asking for a second chance and for you to understand that I was having a difficult time... -We were having a difficult time! And I could have done the same, without you finding out, but I didn't. And I try becoming like everyone else, I try to compromise because we have a child, because I'm scared, because I love you, but I can't anymore. And I regret not leaving for Italy and having this child with you... That you left me and that I haven't accomplished anything, and that now this child will have so many problems, because of me... I have regrets too. I regret leaving my house that night and meeting you. My life could be better too if I hadn't met you. I didn't say that I regret meeting you. You regretted having a child with me. That's worse. Maybe if we met at another point in our lives... ...we could defend this whole situation better. I still am. I'm not anymore. I'm sorry. FOR REN Think it through. It's easy, it's cheap, it won't cost, you'll lose nothing. -A documentary? -Yes, a documentary. -About relationships? -Yes, about relationships. -How is that interesting? -It concerns everyone. -Everyone is concerned about the crisis. -Yes, but there's a fine line between them. -Take you for example. Are you married? -Unfortunately, yes. -Don't you love your wife? -I hate her. -Your children? -I loathe them. Ok, you're not our target group. Think about all those who would like to see a movie about what they're going through or what they would like to have. -People don't have money. -Exactly. So they would choose something of their interest. Like loneliness, love, life, death, age, company, companionship, continuity... -Will it have nude? It's a documentary Panayiotis. It can't have nude. The studio is empty, the equipment is rotting, the crew are unemployed... It won't cost a dime, you have nothing to lose. -What about a script? -We don't have one. -Actors? -No. Are you messing with me? Have you ever been alone for so long that you're starting to like it? -That's not commercial. -Ok, leave that to me. I have gathered the material, I've worked on it, the only thing I want is two people to narrate the story, two convincing, appealing people... Trust me, I'll work, I'll write the script, I'll shoot it, everything. All I want from you is the ok. -Don't you have a house in Plaka? -Yes. -If I lose my money, you lose your house. -Thanks Panayiotis, you're an artist. With this damn invention called "clock",, we push hours and days like a burden. And they are a burden,, because we don't live, do you get it? We divided the day into corpses of moments,, into killed hours hidden inside us,, in the caves of ourselves,, where the freedom of desire is born, and we stuff them with every kind of shit and trash they serve us for values, for needs, for ethics, for culture. We leave out the most important, like searching deep inside us and knowing ourselves and the people around us. We turned our body into an endless graveyard of murdered desires and expectations. When we grow old free and in peace with ourselves, when we remain ourselves, that's not death, but a transition. It's a division in a million lives where, if now, in this life form, you're alive, if you don't murder your being, you will bring grace and beauty. The important thing is to get along with yourself, to bear yourself. -Most of us don't. -Then they're doomed. It's very important to be happy with yourself. Then the best things come your way. If you feel good about you. Remember what we said Antonakis? The moment. I wonder... Do you believe all these things you're saying? Of course. We passed by the store, she saw it and went crazy. Here it is! It's a great idea. Thank you very much. But we don't want to spoil the fairy tale for mommy. Let him down to play. You bought a dog for me, so that I'm not alone? No, it was her idea. If you don't want it, you can return it. -Baby, I'll pick you up tomorrow, ok? -Where are you going? I'm going home. Be a good girl, ok? -I want to see a DVD. -What happened with the rent ad? Nothing yet. Nobody. I guess I have to lower the price more. -Put it in. -Are you sure? Is it a good idea? -I mean, it's not what you want. -There are many things I don't want, but I'm beginning to get used to it the last few months. -It will get a lot smaller, right? -Do you have something better to suggest? -Where did the red, Indian lantern go? -In the storage room. Why? It blended nice here and you liked it... I hated it. I didn't know. -Come here and see the puppy. -I want us to talk. I, on the other hand, want to spend a day with my daughter without talking. -May I? -Tomorrow? To go over the same? No. I'll come tomorrow morning. And if you didn't like the red lantern, you could have said it. What is this? What is it? It fell down. -Hi. -Hi. -The puppy that was for sale? -Some girl bought it a few days ago. Ok, thanks. There's the right moment for everyone. Whether it's now or later. I guess that for me, it hasn't come yet. Me and this gentleman here, have broken up three times. -Five. -And I always missed him. -I always came back. -And I took you back. What would you do if I didn't come back? -What did you say? -It's just hypothetical. What would you do if I didn't come back? -Am I not your love? -Yes, what would you do? I would die, Antonakis. I would die. -Do you like this? -Yes. -You really like it? -Yes. So, mommy was right. Antonakis, are you okay? -A great love never dies. -Are these words coming from you? Yes, from me. Didn't you always say that everything can be expected in life? -Yes, but I never want to lose you. -Okay. -You will never leave me, right? -Never Antonakis. And I don't want to hear anymore bullshit about death. It's a manner of speaking, Antonakis. For us to be together for so long, it means that you deserve me, Elenitsa. Enough with moments and fate. -Lets go home. -Cut! -What did he say? -He said cut. -Cut what? -Not cut, Antonakis. It means that they stop filming. -Great! We're leaving, thank God. -Yes. -How are you? -Demetris, you tell us. How was it? -I can't say these things again. -You were both wonderful. -That part where I cried... -Yes? I didn't mean to, it just happened. If we can edit that part... -I'm afraid I'll become ridicule. -You're such a stuck-up! -Do you want to start fighting? -Don't worry, you were very good. Besides, when we edit the film, you can come, see the material, and if there's something you don't like, we can leave it out. -Let's do the last scene now... -Our girl came to pick us up. That's Christina, our granddaughter. What time did you tell her to come? Is it my fault she came earlier? Christina, come here! She brought the damn dog along... -It's my birthday present. -That's all we needed! -Are you done? How did it go? -Great, wonderful! I'm a bit tired myself. -Hi. -Hello. Christina, this is Demetris, the director I told you about. This is Christina, our granddaughter. -I hope they didn't give you a hard time. -Not at all. On the contrary... Our granddaughter recently returned from Italy and she's staying with us. -She's divorced. -Grandma! I'm only saying because you're looking for a place to stay, and Demetris lives in Plaka, so he may know about something good. It's not the time now. Don't pay attention. -I say we go change now... -Why should we change? We have the last scene now, we have to change. -I said I'm tired, do you get it? -Antonakis, shut up! -Do you see that? No romance. -Let's go now. I can't stand you anymore! Don't talk to me like that in front of the others! -Are they nagging to you too? -They're a lot of fun. May I ask something? Have I seen you before? Me? I don't think so. Did you buy the puppy from the pet shop in Plaka? Yes. Are you sure I haven't seen you before? -Don't you think I'd remember? -Right. -Can I wait over there? -Yes, of course. You can also sit in front of the monitor, for a better view. -How big? -Excuse me? The place you're looking for. How many square feet? Not many. I'm asking because I have something in mind. -But the thing is there are two of us. -What do you mean "two"? Me and my son. Okay, you can see it and if you think it's good... Okay. If you want, we can go over there later so you can have a look. Action! -There are secret affairs... -The conventional relationships... The affairs with passion and inhibitions... The simple relationships where you pitch and scrape until you die... And the ones where you know you have found the one and only, true love. Of course we don't know what everyone regards as true... There's a lot of things we don't know, and that no one will ever be able to answer. -That's why we are still together. -Antonakis, tell me... What are we now, after all these years? We are lovers... I love what you just said! Are you nuts! Do you want to kill yourselves? For God's sake! There's a bathroom, a small bedroom, the kitchen will be installed next week... And of course the entrance at the staircase will be detached, but the workers... Have not finished yet. Do you know how many times I've passed in front of this house? And now you're thinking that you may live here... -How much do you want? -In euro or drachmas? We'll figure it out. Yes, I think so too. -Is that a barrel organ? -Yes, he passes by every morning. Eleni! Come on, girl. We'll be late! We have to leave in ten minutes and... Eleni? Do you know that your mother loved to sit there and listen to the barrel organ? Do you miss her? I don't know how my life would be without her. Come on, we'll be late. Come and help me choose what to wear. Ao - oo o T E A&B Group/Ploegos
