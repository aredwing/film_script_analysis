 

                        It is the biggest cash robbery in U.S. history... $8 million taken from an armored-car company office in New York City. There may have been close to $30 million here yesterday, all in cash, mostly 50s and hundreds. A task force of FBI agents and New York City detectives are trying to solve the biggest cash robbery in U.S. history. FBI and New York City police investigators swarmed over the roof of a Bronx armored-truck company after thieves cut a hole in the roof and made off with the largest cash theft in U.S. history. Police also said that a television camera pointed at the vault had been moved, leading to speculation that the burglars had inside help. At this point not one penny has been recovered. But FBI officials say they're working on a number of good leads and are optimistic about finding the money. If I knew, I would be out there with a shovel looking for it.

See you boys later, all right? What? What, they got fries. Those assholes are swimming in money, bro. Look at us looking for bullshit jobs... you studying to become a cop. For what? I'm trying to do something with my life. Now a waste of time 'cause you're a stupid shit. - What did I do? - The fucking Black Sabbath concert. Now 'cause of that I can't even apply to be a cop no more. Black Sabbath concert was like a million years ago, bro. It stayed on my record. I should fucking kill you for it. - It's a fucking joint, bro. - You think I don't know that? Yo, that sucks, bro. I'm sorry. Let me take you to Papagalo's, buy you a drink. - You ain't got no money. - I got money, come on. I'm gonna go do a piss. - Yo, I'm sorry bro. - Yeah. Honestly, that sucks, bro. - Come on, drinks on me. - You ain't got no money. Call me later. The rain is miserable. Sorry I'm late, Mr. L. - Hey, Nance. - Hey. I saw Vicky. She said you're not taking the cop test no more? - Uh... - Because of Eddie? Yeah, you know. And my mother got a thing for him, so. - Yeah, he's an idiot. - Yeah. All right, well, if you need anything, an umbrella or whatever, I'm here. Okay, thanks, Nance. All I can say is I've already got a weapons permit. I can work nights, weekends, whatever you want. I've been studying to be with the force since I was old enough to read. Yeah, I'm sure the boss would be real impressed with that. Look, my friend, this ain't the NYPD. I hope you can understand that. Yeah yeah, I understand that. And are you okay with the $200 a week? Yuh... I was making 50 a night working at a club. Well, you've already got a job! How lucky are you? Hey, Mary, let's send somebody else up here, okay? Uh, the club closed, so I'll take it. Oh. I thought so. Okay then. Welcome aboard. Is it hot enough for you here, huh? Frigging air conditioner ain't working. They're gonna fix it. They keep telling me they're gonna fix it, but who the hell knows? You keep playing with that thing, you're gonna blow your balls off, man. Or worse... mine. Yeah, sorry. I just, uh... You can't believe they gave you a gun on your first day, huh? Yeah, I mean I never even shot anything before, you know? Just remember, the vest is for your heart, not your balls, so. You're Chris, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, that's right, yeah yeah. I'm Tony. Well, I told you that already. And this... Marie and Giana. That's my wife and little girl. They're the only thing keeping me from driving this over the border. So anyways, we do about eight to 10 pick-ups a day. Then we drive around and drop it off, drive some more, get some more, the owners take some off the top, and then Wednesday morning we go back to the Reserve. Done. Beautiful. Brain surgery. Wait, the owners are taking money? Yeah well, it's the bosses' rule, but hell, they can do whatever the hell they want in here. A lot of monkey business all I know is going on. Knowing too much will drive you crazy, anyway. Just keep it simple, do your job, find a girl, buy a house. Okay. So this is how it goes. We pick the money up, we lock it in the back here with you. - Lock in the back. - We're only talking 83 grand or so. That's it. One of these bags can hold 250 easy. Biggest load I ever had was six million. - It's crazy, huh? - Hey, you want to shut the... No no no, it's fine. Just stay on your toes. You stay out here. I'll be in and out quick. - Hey, Sal! - Yeah yeah. Oh what, did you get a haircut? Hey, officer. - Hey, kid. - Whoa whoa whoa! - What, are you crazy? - Whoa whoa. What the hell's the matter with you? Wait till I tell your father about this. - You could have gotten yourself killed. - Hey, partner. Try and not let somebody sneak up on you. - Yeah yeah. Sorry sorry. - Yeah, all right. When we're hauling loot, you're gonna be on shotgun duty back here. - All right, back here. - You got that? - All right. - All right, good. All right, so guard it like it was your mother's 83 grand. - Want me to stay back here? - Yeah, do what you want. - Okay. - A lot of salami in those bags, huh? - Yeah, no kidding. - Trust me when I say I know what you're thinking back there. Trust me, I do. Cash makes people do some crazy shit. - You gotta keep your head about you. - Okay. It's hot as hell back there, right? Uh, no shit. Yeah well, you'll get used to it, buddy. Listen, it's my daughter's birthday, so I gotta get out of here early, okay? - Okay, sounds good. - While they sort through the bags, do whatever the hell they do, I'll walk you through the process. Coming in! Wait, they're not gonna care that you're leaving me alone to put away the money? Who, the boss? A bunch of criminals up there. Don't worry yourself over it. We just do our thing up here. Okay, so the keys to the lock up - are kept right here. - Whatever you say. Minimum wage. Come on, I'll show you the good stuff. Anyway, this... this is okay? I don't know. Ask him. One, two, three, four. They're not very creative here. Yeah, no shit. And there it is. $25 million. - That's $25 million? - Give or take a couple of 'em. Of a million?! Hey, whoa whoa whoa. Watch out. There's a camera right there. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Okay, so after they're done upstairs we drop it in here, it piles up until it's full. Half the time the drivers don't even bring it upstairs first. So how do they know how much is in there? They don't. - They don't? - No. - So if some goes missing... - If some goes missing, it wouldn't be the first time around here, pal. Oh hey hey! - Hey, come on. - There's a dog in there? Yeah, there's a dog. Come here, this is Barney. I forgot to... he's deaf as a doornail, - the poor old guy. - What, he lives in that? He lives in there with the money. Come on, go ahead. - It's crazy. No shit. - Go back to bed. Oh. Hey, that's Maria now. Come on. I gotta lock this up. Now remember, your partner here came down with a severe head cold. - Got it. - All right? - Yeah. - You gotta get my back on this one. - You got it. - Put those keys back behind the desk. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. Fucking dog. Boy, what, are you taking a night off, Pop? Hey. No, I was just taking a little break. Well, good for you. - What's going on here? - They let your father go. - What? - After 10 years, no warning. - Enough, dear. Enough, dear. - Nice people, huh? What, because of that thing in the bathroom the other night? - Mm-hmm, of course that's why. - It's fine, really, enough. - That's it. - No no, it's not fine. - He had no right. - He's the boss, he has the right. No. Why? Because you stood up to that jerk-off, that's why? Of course that's why. The bunch of hoodlums - living their lives like criminals. - Enough. - Enough, both of you. - No, that's not enough! You've been there 10 years and what? He's just gonna say, "That's it, no more"? - Mm-hmm. - That's exactly what they're gonna say. And they can and they did. And that's all. 10 years my father's working for these people. And what has he got to show for it? Nothing. No retirement, no insurance. You know what? I worry about that stuff, you know? Yeah well, we all worry about that, kid. What are you gonna do? Come on, let's get to work. Oh, your date was good? It's the circus. What are you gonna do? Giana loved it. There were clowns and things. You know, they had a unicorn and some craziness. - You know? - Oh yeah? Hey, so what's the deal at Empire? You know, far as insurance or retirement? Again with the retirement? You're too young to worry about retirement. Especially with those hoodlums, believe me. Ahh, you keep saying that. What's the deal? They're crooked, right? Huh, always in that room? Yeah. They ain't playing Tiddlywinks in there, pal. You just wait out here, okay? You're like that cartoon thing... you worry too much. Hey, guys, how you doing? Trust me, from here out you'll be doing the heavy lifting, I guarantee you that. They don't pay me enough to do... Get your hands up! It's okay, whoa whoa whoa. Shut the fuck up! Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Come on, come here, you motherfucker! - Motherfucker, motherfucker! - I'll kill you, no! Get the fuck... No no, hey! No! Yo yo, hey! Marie... Get the fuck outta here. Let's go! Fuck the money! Let's get the fuck outta here. Kid's lucky he was wearing a vest. If not, game over. - No doubt. - The kid's named Potami or something. He's right over there. I'm gonna go talk to him. Mr. "Potami". I'm Jerry Ransone, cop... detective, you know. Is he dead? Yeah. High probability. Listen, Mr. Potami... hey hey. Whoa whoa. Easy,okay? Listen, if you had anything to do with this whole whatever-just- went-down... listen to me, now's a better time than later if you want to shoot straight with me. I'm giving you a chance. Sound fair to you? Listen, I'm not gonna waste your time, I don't want you to waste my time. I got a life too. - I got a lot of shit to do, okay? - I already told the other cops. Okay?

Glad you're okay, Chris. - Thanks, Nance. - Good night. - She's a good girl. - Yeah. - Very nice girl. I like her. - Like a sister that I like. - Shut up. - Hey. The main thing is that you're safe, thank God. - That's the main thing. - And your partner? The job will take care for his family? - That's what they said. - Then that's what they'll do, right? That's what they said. Good. Oh hey! Fucking-a, malaka. I thought your dad was the man of steel, right? - With the mouth. - Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse my language. What happened? I mean a fucking bomb?! - His friend was just killed, Eddie. - I know, that sucks. - Are you kidding? I mean... - None of this would have happened if it wasn't for that thing with you smoking pot and all that. - In the Led Zeppelin show. - No, I know. - Chris would be a police officer now. - I know, I feel terrible. Yeah, you're talking about Black Sabbath, by the way. Trust me, I wish we saw Zeppelin. What the fuck happened, bro? - Oop. - I'm gonna go. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna go lay down or something. Going to lay down? Why would everybody... everybody leaves when I show up? Yo, what channel's cable? A botched attempt at an armored-car robbery left one man dead and a slew of questions, as a pipe bomb was detonated in broad daylight at 125th and Lennox Avenue in Manhattan. Police are investigating the robbery as two suspects, both wearing masks, fled the scene in what's being described as a blue van. Potamis! - Yeah? - So you'll be working nights here now. What? Why? We give our guys on the streets guns to shoot people who show up with other guns. I had Tony's back, okay? Great. So you'll be working nights now. You can go. There he is. Dirty Harry- Yeah, good job with that. Aren't you supposed to bring the money inside at night? I don't know, are we? - I'm just asking. - So are we. The money will be fine out there. Exactly. Just keep an eye on the monitors and we'll all be fine. Got that? Good. Let's go. The bosses don't give a shit. Why should we? Exactly. Fuck that. I got kids at home. The fuckers are giving Tony's wife 5,000 instead of 50. I know they're stealing it, trust me. - What, the owners are? - Fuck yeah, the owners. Everybody's up to shit in there. Everybody. Yeah, everyone except you, bro. Yeah well, the place is a joke. Oh, let's cross. Fucking... I don't want to deal with those guys. - Let's cross. - What, your father working today? - No, he... - What? - They let him go. - What? After 10 years they fucking let him go. - Fucking assholes. - That's it, no more. Fucking... Thinking they're big shits in their Cadillacs, right? - Fucking big shots. - Excuse me? I'm just saying you fire this guy's fucking father after 10 years? Sorry, I'm not sure I'm hearing you right. I think the least you could do is be a little loyal. Let's go. - I don't know what you're saying. - Fucking big shots in their Cadillacs, right? Big shit. - I take the trains, yo. - Asshole. You know what? You should rob that place where you work. You say the place ain't got no security, so. Yeah, you're right. I should. Yeah, I am right! What, you don't think they'll screw it over? They screwed your friend over. Look at him. Fucking widow.

Call if there's a problem. - Okay. - All right. All right, bro, just let me... - show it to me one more time. - Just keep your fucking voice down. - Let me see one more. - Cut the shit, all right? Holy shit! And they won't know? They don't even count it half the time. Jesus, holy shit. The camera doesn't even see the door when it opens. The place is a joke. Like I even want to fucking take it. - You know, fuck it, right? Do you understand? You gotta get me a job at this place. Do you know what I could do with $25,000? I could pay for my fucking wedding, my fucking car. Shh, keep your fucking mouth down. Calm down, okay?

Eddie, why would you say anything to those people? I mean, it's like you're retarded. Mike... I mean, he's a maniac, you know that. We were just talking, bro, relax. You already said that. Besides the fact, they work for Spiro! Fuck Spiro. They don't give a shit about Spiro, nobody does. You know you didn't tell me that they leave the truck outside overnight for no reason. You know you wanted me to put it in action, bro. Put what into action? Listen, you idiot, get whatever stupid idea is in your head out of your head. Seriously, let me ask you, what's the worst that could happen, what? What did Georgie get that one time for auto theft, a year? And a year ain't worth a chance at a million dollars? We're not talking about robbing a car, Eddie. I'm not cleaning lambjizz the rest of my life, bro. My father died when he was 42. Your father... no offense, but he just got canned - for cleaning Spiro's toilets. - Watch your mouth. All right, I'm sorry. Look, all I'm saying is think about it, okay? Just think about it when you go to your house tonight, okay? Worst-case scenario, I go to jail for robbing a fucking truck, you know, for a year. Anything else, we're set. We're set. Fucking think about it. We're set, bro. Hamilton Bohannon, 1978. Have a great night, New York. Look at you, buddy. Sitting in there with $25 million. That's a lot of money. Okay, Eddie, the diner, tonight. Look, Chris, I just gotta know that this asshole can keep his mouth shut. Okay? If Spiro finds out, we're dead, - me and Jimmy. - Why, you don't trust me? No! Listen, no more bullshitting, okay? This is serious. And Mike's right. Nobody but us knows anything about anything, okay? What's his problem? I just... I just think if we're going to do this, we should let Spiro in on it, no? You tell Spiro, he'll want it all. Yeah, but we don't have to give it to him all. See what I'm saying? Eddie's right. He's trlos, but he's right. Spiro can't know nothing. What, you don't think he's gonna find out? No, I don't. Okay. Okay, Jimmy. I'm serious. We're serious. Are you good with that? Hey. He's asking you a question. Eh, I'm out. - Fuck it. - You're out. You don't need me for this. You got two guys anyway. I was going to do construction at the movie theater this weekend. All right? I'm gonna go. Look, I'm still in for the Colombian deal. All right? However that goes down, but this... it's... no. No, I'm gonna go. - You sure? - Yeah. Fuck him. More money for me then, right? Okay. Don't worry, all right, Chris? Don't worry. He knows I'd kill him. We're good. Right. Okay okay. Okay, this... is Empire. Okay, Thursday night I'll be the only one there. Eddie, off Boston Road there'll be a fence. At the top of the fence, there'll be a camera. I want you to break it. The next night... Friday night... - the guards will be out by 8:00. - I'll see you tomorrow. Nobody gets overtime, so believe me, they'll be out like clockwork. 8:00 sharp. There's a phone booth two blocks away on Jerome Avenue. You and Mike will go there and you'll wait. I'll go inside, so I'll make sure everything's cool. But I'm serious, you stay out there and you'll wait. And nothing happens until I call you. Nothing... until I call. Hey, whoa whoa whoa, hey! He's okay, he's okay, he's okay, he's okay. Anyone else here? - Is anyone here?! - What? No. - All right. - What's going on? We got a tip a crew's coming in here. You know anything about it? - Do you know anything about it? - No no. All right, get up on the roof. Staircase's right there. Secure that door. Check the perimeter. Everyone, move! I've been upstairs, downstairs, all over the place. Nothing in here. Camera look like it's out of order, but hey, what you gonna do, huh? Other than that, not a mice stirring. Do you have any idea how many violations are going on in this place? - It's crazy. - Yeah yeah, it's about as secure as a candy shop. - Hey, it's only money, right? - Yeah, exactly. All right, I'll take one last look around the premises. - Just holler. - For sure. Mind if I do a few sets on your thing over there? You know, knock yourself out. 'Cause it's Nautilus by the gym over by my place. You know what they say? Dead weight, that's the only way to really get that size on, you know? Gotta feel that burn. - Yeah. - Little hard work, no big shirts. You know how it is. Yo? The fucking cops are here, you hear me? - Are you fucking kidding me? - Fucking cops... - they're already inside and I fucking... - Yo! Hey hey hey, what was that there? - That? - Yeah, what was that? Naw, I was just, uh... you know, I was talking to my mother. - That was your mother? - No, she was... I don't know, she was doing some cooking or something. - I'm gonna go use the bathroom, okay? - Yeah, it's right down there. You sure you don't want to call her back? No no, that's okay. That's what I'm talking about. I think we got something out here, boss. Roger that. On the move. Let's roll. Enough with the weights. - Everyone move! - Let's go. Move! Fuck. How are things going out there? Come on, talk to me. Two perps, both armed, masks on. - One just slipped the fence. - Anyone else? Negative. Roger that. - You ready? - Ready. You stay. - You ready? - I'm ready. Let's do this. Freeze! I said freeze, drop your weapons! Ah shit, get back. Stay down, stay down. Don't move. Johnson, call for backup. Call for backup. There's shots fired down here! - We need backup! - What do you see, Ronny? Talk to me, buddy. Talk to me. The bald perp's behind the trucks. No eyes on him. If they move, I got 'em. Okay, you see anything, you talk to me, you got it? Roger that. - Johnson, get to the back. - Roger. I got it. Stay here, don't move. You hear? - What are you... - Don't move, stay there! Any visuals, Ronny? Huh-uh, nothing yet. Dispatch, we've got guns fired here. We're gonna need backup at Empire. Situation just got real. 10-71, code two Jerome Avenue. - Yeah. - We need backup! We need backup here! Got eyes on one. By the gate, by the gate! No hits, sir. One's still behind the truck. Roger. Stay the course. Two cars headed over. On their way. Roger that. We've got a real situation here. Tommy, what's your 10-39? Turning onto Jerome Avenue now. Hold tight. Talk to me, boss. What do you need? What do you need? Talk to me, what do you need? Still no visual on the perp, sir. Still no visual. Boss, I'm getting no response here. Lost eyes on the one behind the truck, sir. He's definitely armed. Ronny, talk to me. Do you have eyes on the situation? Backup, we're gonna need some backup here! Somebody's gotta give me something out there. Talk to me! Talk to me! What do you need me to do, boss? Shots fired, shots fired. Backup, we need backup, we need backup! Shots fired, shots fired! Shots fired, we need backup! We need backup! We've got officers engaged in gunfire here. What's the ETA? Coming into Empire now. Boss, what's the situation out there? - We've got cars arriving. - All clear, everything's all clear. 10-26 all clear. Backup arriving on the scene right now. Roger that. Move! What the fuck was that about? It's about somebody with a big fucking mouth I'm gonna have to shut. - F... there he is. - It could have been a coincidence. Ain't no such thing as a coincidence, Eddie. Mike, what the fuck you doing here? - What's up, Jimmy? - Mike, wait... Want to rat me out, you fucking scumbag? - Mike, I didn't... - Fucking do it. Get up. We ain't calling quits on that Empire place neither, okay? Get the fuck in! Yeah, he shot the guy. He's a hero. He saved the cop's life. He could've died. MY 5", my son... There he is, there he is! My hero. - Say hello. I'm gonna go talk to Eddie for a minute. - Eddie. - I'll come back, I'll come back. Oh, now he's a hero he has no time for his mother. Where you been? I was calling you all morning. Where was I? Where the fuck were you? How crazy was that shit last night? Another crew comes to do the same fucking shit? What? What's up with you? Where were you? Well, Mike killed Jimmy last night. That's where I was. - What? - Yeah. Thought he ratted us out, now he wants to go back in and rob Empire again. - What, are you fucking crazy? - It's not me, it's him! Jimmy had nothing to do with what went down last night, okay? - It was a fucking coincidence. - I know. You know what? It's too late. Killed him, so. What the fuck's Spiro gonna do when he finds out about this? You know he's gonna fucking kill us, right? That's why I say we gotta go back in there and take the money for ourselves before Mike, - before him, before anybody else does. - What? Are you fucking crazy? - No. - They're not gonna leave the money - on the street any more anyway, okay? - So we go inside and get it! Just fucking forget it. Forget everything. There's cameras at every door, okay? So why am I even talking? I'm not even... I'm not... Cops won't expect it. Nobody will. Shut your fucking mouth. Will you please shut your fucking mouth? - I'm doing it with or without you. - Oh really? - You gonna do it without me? - Yeah yeah, really. And when I get there, you can call the cops, you can fucking shoot me or you can say "Fuck yeah, Eddie, I'm with you." But you know what? I'm doing it. And I'm not doing this shit any more, bro. I'm fucking done with this. - I'm done. - Watch your mouth, okay? You watch it. I'm doing it, Chris. I know it's just you after 8:00. ...And it was sayonara New York for sunny California. Albert Hammond in 1972. Got on board a westbound 747 Didn't think before... What to do Oooh, that talk of opportunities TV breaks and movies Rang true Sure rang true... He's fucking crazy, right?

Well, here I am, boys. Whoo! Whoo yeah! - What the fuck? - Whoa! What, are you fucking crazy?! Well... I told you I was fucking coming, bro. How about that? What'd I tell you, right? I told you. Where's it at, huh? I ain't leaving without it. Brother, I'm not leaving till I get that money. I ain't leaving without it, okay? Look at you, you look like a lunatic! Yeah, that's right, yeah. Answer the phone, go ahead. Answer the... you answer the phone right now! You might as well shoot me dead right now, okay? I'm not going to jail.

You gonna help me carry this shit out or what? There's a fucking camera, you idiot! Where? Oh, what are you doing? That's fucking great, Eddie. What am I gonna tell people, huh? You tell me, what am I gonna fucking tell people now? You're on the camera and you're talking to me, you fucking idiot! Damn, we got clowns in every room here. Aww shit. Hey, you might want to go holler at your boy there before these FBI clowns take over from him. Looks like your party got a little out of whack here. Look at this place, huh? God, look at you. Yeah, I, uh... I was on the phone - and then... - You were on the phone? You were on that phone right there? - You make a call there? - No no. - I, uh... - Not that. I don't know. My head's all messed up. Three times in a month is crazy. Man, what are the odds of that, huh? Three times. What are the odds that the guy knew exactly where the keys were too, huh? Unbelievable. The dog passed out from fear. 9mm must have scared the shit out of him. They found it unconscious. They thought it was dead. They thought the dog was dead. - I'm Detective Ransone. - Yeah, I know who you are. Listen, so what have we got here? We've got three break-ins on the same premises, we've got two men dead, we've got no arrests. Does anybody here have any idea how many dollars that disappeared from this spot? Uh, Detective Ransone or Mister... how do you pronounce it? ...Patemi, is it? Potamitis. Yeah. See, now you know why the FBI is rolling up in here. Yeah, so. Mr. Potamias, you got Santa Claus coming through your ceiling, right? They break in your gate, shooting a 9mm within proximity of your dog and you're unconscious. Yeah. No, I, uh... I don't know. I was making the rounds. I come back and I guess somebody hit me. You weren't on the phone? No phonecall? Didn't you tell me you were on that phone? Honeywell called and you said everything was okay. - Was it okay? - Yeah, like I said... no, I was making the rounds. I come back and some... Somebody hit you. Yeah. Nothing caught your eye? Nothing seemed out of the ordinary at that time? The camera outside's broke, so the only visuals I had were on the money room and the doors. Yeah, and somebody's coming through your ceiling. That's a brilliant move. Whew. - Very clever. - It's really clever. Very clever, very tricky. Wow, these guys are something else, huh? - Excuse me, sir. - So you got anything else for us, - Mister... - Potami. Potami? Detective Ransone, any more questions? No, I think you guys covered everything. No? Good. So we're done here, right? Somebody get this kid to a hospital. - Unbelievable. - Mmm. Mr. Potamatis, Ernie Anastos. It's been reported that over $9 million were taken in last night's heist. Do you have anything to say about that? No. Can I just ask you a couple of questions? Five minutes? Keep shooting. Keep shooting. God damn it, Eddie. Hey hey- - Hey. - What's going on? Nothing, I was... I need to go for a walk. Go for a walk? Where are you gonna go for a walk, huh? Hmm? Where are you gonna go? Nowhere. I'm just going for a walk. Where you gonna go? The police are out there looking for you. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm sorry. - I just... I'm sorry. - What's going on? - I gotta go for a walk. - What's going on? What's going on? - Nothing. I'm fine. - You're not fine. You're not fine. Come on. You were out all night. The police are here all day looking for you. Your face... come on, tell me. Tell me, tell me. - Talk to me. - Nothing. No, I... - I'm gonna go for a walk. - No. - I'm gonna come back. I'm okay. - You're not okay. Listen... - You're not okay. - I'm okay, Pop. I'm all right. Don't walk away! Listen to me. I'm talking to you. Chris! - Chris, listen to me! - I'm sorry. If goddamn Eddie has something to do with this to make the police come for you again, I'm gonna kill him, you hear me? Listen to me! U.S. District Attorney Giuliani, welcome. - Agents Nugent, Marichal. - Hey, how you doing? - Hot enough for you or what? - Good to see you. How are you doing, fellas? So how much are we talking about being taken here? Yeah well, the newspapers are downplaying it, but we think it's upwards of $10 million. - Jesus Christ. - The largest one in history. And the security guard, there was only one? Only one guard, but he doesn't really seem that capable - of much of anything, sir. - Well, seemed capable of shooting a would-be robber two nights prior according to this report here. You're right about that, sir, but listen, we think that whole thing might have been a decoy. Because we've got the guy on surveillance tape, right? Two nights prior, he's disabling a video camera in the back. So you think the two are connected? Yeah, but talking about details, manpower... there's no doubt about it... we're talking Cosa Nostra. And the detective who's been on since the beginning... Detective J. Ransone? Yeah, he's setting up a makeshift interrogation over at Empire right now. - You find that funny? - Mr. Giuliani, there's no way in hell that that greaseball guard could pull off this job on his own. It's just too big for him. I'm willing to put my badge on it. Well, no harm in letting him follow through with the workers, but I tend to agree with Marichal here. This thing stinks of organized crime. - Agreed. - Go after all five families. Someone's gonna talk. Under District Attorney Rudolph Giuliani's orders members of all five of New York's crime families have been arrested to be questioned in regard to the Empire heist. You missed some shit on your upper lip. - You should shave that off. - Now believed to be the largest since Lufthansa. War... - $8 million, 9 million, how much is it? - Hey, how you doing? - No one seems to know anything... - Hey, back off! - ...Other than this is... - Where's the money, Giuseppe? ...The biggest heist in U.S. history. Ladies and gentlemen, someone out there has a lot of cash. It's your half right there, every penny. - Told you we could pull that off. - You fucking ass! That's for breaking my fucking face. How else were you gonna say you had nothing to do with it, huh? Fuck! I talked to Mike. He wants to, uh... Mike wants to meet with us. You fucking... What was I supposed to do? He called me. He said we go in with the Colombian deal on him and that's it. He won't say nothing to anybody, so that's it. - There it is. - I'm gonna get in my car. You come around me again, and I'm gonna fucking kill you. - What else was I supposed to say? - I will fucking kill you. - You understand me? - I just handed you $8 fucking million! You didn't hand me fucking shit, you understand me? - Get the fuck... - Didn't hand me fucking shit. And you walk the fuck away and you tell Mike to do the same or I'll kill you both. - I'll fucking kill you. - Yeah, fuck you! I should have shot you when you came through that fucking roof. Fucking prick. This fucking cocaine. You know I should kill you, right? Slit your throat... for backstabbing me like you did. I mean, that's why I'm here right now. I'll pay you back. And your friend? He had nothing to do with it. He just... didn't rat me out, so. That's it. I'm not an asshole, Eddie. Fucking look at me, okay? Listen, I'm in. I'm all the way in, so. But Chris stays out of it and that's the way it's gonna be. You could shoot me, you could do whatever you want to do, but you know what? Kill me, you don't find out where the money is, and... you know, and I'll tell Spiro about Jimmy, so. You know? Okay. It goes down tomorrow then. Good. Don't disappear. - Not going anywhere. - Yeah. Good. Now get the fuck out. All right. - You got something? - Somewhere in here. Got it. - Let's get outta here. - What, we stepping out? - Yeah. - Okay, let's do this. Michael, where's, um... - Where's what? - Where's Jimmy? Where's he been lately? - Jimmy's working. - No, I know, he hasn't been here in... it's been like almost a week. He's always with you. I'm just wondering. I'm just wondering where he is. I think he's got the... the construction thing. - Oh yeah yeah. - He's been working at that movie house. - Mm-hmm. - So it's been real busy over there. Yanni, that looks good. Can you turn it on? You can't turn it on? There's a lava in the back I think. It looks good anyway. Where the hell are you going? Use the bathroom. Hey, I'm looking for a... Spiro Stravakis. - Stavrakis. - Stavrakis! That's good. Are the police asking? - What, that obvious? - Only if you're the police. Yeah, we came here about the Empire heist. Just curious if anybody knew anything about it. The Empire heist in the Bronx? - Mm-hmm. - And you're here looking? I thought the papers said that was the Guineas. - You know, the real mob. - Ah, you know. Big-time lowlifes, small-time lowlifes... it's all the same to me. Ain't that right there, Michael... Dimitriu? Did I say that right? You come into my place and you start saying people's names, - but you never said your name. - You're right. - We didn't. - And what are you insinuating? That maybe Michael here had something to do with this robbery? Just want to ask your boy if he have any ideas on it, that's all. My boy, detectives, has the good fucking sense to know that if he or anyone around me had anything to do with something like this without my knowledge, that they'd lose their balls. So no, you can be certain he has no ideas on this. So you're answering for him? - I just did. - He's answering for you. Okay. Well, we got nothing else. - Yassou? - Yassou, yeah. All right. Yassou. Michael, have a seat. Look at him, he's talking to someone. - Son of a bitch. - You sure? I'm positive. He's looking right at the camera. I've been looking at this thing all afternoon. Ah, here he is. Son of a bitch. Hey, Chris. Hey, man. - Hey. - How you doing? Come on in. Hey, guys, give me the office for a sec. - Sure. - Hey, listen, I never got the chance to properly thank you for saving my life out there. So thank you. Yeah, I'm glad to see you're doing okay. Yeah, me too. Here, grab a... grab a seat, sit down. Listen, uh, thanks for coming down, man. You know, any time something like this happens we gotta bring you down, we gotta talk to people. It's all the procedural bullshit. You know the drill. - Yeah, for sure. - Okay. So I gotta ask you... nothing seemed out of the ordinary? Not a thing? Uh, I know it sounds crazy, but, you know, I was making the rounds, I went to the bathroom. I didn't hear anything. I come back. That's it. You know these guys? That guy's a Michael Dimitriu and another guy's Eddie Papastratos. They're small time criminals, but I wanted to know if you knew them. - Yeah, why? - I was just checking, that's all. I mean I haven't spoken to them in a while, you know, if... SO... you know, I'm sure they had nothing to do with this - if that's what you're saying. - I didn't say that. But okay. Okay, so, you have any more questions or is that it? You said that there was only one guy, right, - who broke in, the robber? - No no, I didn't. You know, I didn't see anyone, so. Huh. You know we got this video here and, uh, near the money room right before the guy with the ski mask looks up and he smashes the surveillance camera, it's like he's talking to someone. Then he looks up like someone told him where the camera was. It's the weirdest thing. Like I told you, I didn't see anyone, so. Yeah, you said that already... a few times. - Yeah. - Okay. Okay, you don't know nothing. Okay, are we good? Yeah yeah yeah. We're done. Okay, great. I thanked you for saving my life, right? - Yeah. - Okay, good. But that don't mean for a goddamn second that I won't hesitate to drag your ass in if I find out you've been lying to me about all this shit. Do you understand? Yeah, I got it. All right, we're cool. Now you can go. Whoo! Hey! Spiro wants to talk. Get in. Yo, Orlanda. Please, sit down, yeah? Here. You're late, huh? So this is where we hang out, huh? The big time. Please, no secrets. Put your bag down right next to ours. It's cool. Eight mill, all there. The coke pure? Why do people always ask that, huh? It's the movies, yeah? Of course. Clean? Of course. Now you must have serious financing for Mike to make you his partner instead of Jimmy. - Right? - Yeah well, listen, Jimmy ain't a part of this no more. Okay? Okay. Let's count it. And now we wait, huh? It's a lot of money to count. Christo Christara. Wow, you've been through a lot lately, huh? Some couple of fucking days. We got something for you. Where's... where's our special guest? Anybody know where our special guest is? - Taking a piss. - He's taking a piss? He's taking a piss. Hey, he's taking a piss. Okay, so. Before you tell me where the money from the robbery is in the Bronx... and you're gonna fucking tell me, which is the only reason we don't bash your fucking head in right now... but before you do, there's somebody I want you to meet who's been telling me about a robbery you didn't want to include me in on. Spiro, listen, I don't know what you're talking about, okay? Hey, I understand. I understand! That's why I'm saying I just want you to meet somebody first. It's not a big fucking deal! And here he comes. We don't have to wait any longer. Our fucking special guest... Mr. Jimmy back from the fucking dead. Unbelievable, right? Next time you want to kill somebody, make sure you fucking kill him! How you doing now, Christo, huh? Now go get my fucking money. Two? Yeah. Eddie Papastratos working tonight? Not tonight. How about his friend, Chris Potami? Who's asking? Cops. How about some menus? Naw, it's all right, honey. We really are cops though. If it's okay, we'd like to look in Eddie's locker. Is that all right? Eleni, come here. These guys say they're cops and they want to look in Eddie's locker or something. You're cops, the two of you? - Those real? - Yes ma'am. - Yeah. - What'd he do? Well, we're hoping nothing. All right then. Come on. - Just follow you? - Yep. Go ahead, do what you want. - Which one? - Middle. - It's okay? - Mmm. Find any shit about another girl in there, you hand it over to me. Yeah, you got it. No goddamn way. Wow. Is eight. Eight million. It's all there. Here's 400 extra. It's yours. Okay, you can go now. - What are you talking about? - Stand up, turn around and walk out that door. What the fuck are you talking about? It's not hard. Stand up... turn around - and walk out the door. - Sit still. What the fuck are you talking about, walk out? - Whoa whoa whoa, relax relax. - I said turn around, - and walk out the door, yeah? - What's going on? - Turn around and walk out the door. - Okay, chill. Put the gun down, put the gun down. - I said do yourself a favor. - What the fuck is going on? Walk out the door. - Go! - You shot me in my fucking mouth? Get the fuck out! Go now! Get the fuck out of here now! - Get the fuck out now! - Are you fucking serious, huh? - In the fucking mouth! - Heavenly Father Save the people Save their souls - Save our father... - Come on, come on, come on. Save our mother... Oh! Fuck! - Save the people... - Get us our fucking money! Save their souls... Eddie? It's over. I'll talk to him. Eddie, Eddie. Eddie, Eddie, Eddie. My DA's got half the Italian mob on lockdown, my lieutenant's wondering how half the missing Empire money landed in the lap of some mid-level Colombian cocaine dealer and I'm thinking you and your friend know where the other half is. So before I let you go... and unfortunately I have to... I've got two questions for you, Eddie: Where's Chris? And where's the money? Chris, Chris, what is going on? I'm being serious right now. You need to tell me what happened. Shit, my father. - Fuck, come on. - Chris, I'm being serious. You need to look at me and you need to tell me what's going on.

And don't you know it. You think your boy's gonna talk? Yeah. I think he'll come to his senses. The FBI said today that the man whose job it was to protect the money stole it: Christos Potamitis. We spoiled his vacation where he's been sunning himself by the pool most of the afternoon. It was a matter of me trying to get a bag to come to me. The building's landlord said he was amazed the burglars could get through the roof. Uh, we specifically made this roof to have steel construction because we wanted to have the security in there. Just dollar signs, you know, coming at me. You know? "Here we are." More arrests are expected says the FBI, as is recovery of the 11 million, which is still missing. And the money still to this day is gone? - That's correct. - Vanished? Just vanished. - Into thin air? - Into thin air. The way it disappeared out of the money room, it disappeared out of our hands.
