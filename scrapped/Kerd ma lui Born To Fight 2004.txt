I've survived because of this talisman... I'm giving it to you. Time to go. Hello. Hello, I've come to make another order. Usually you call and order first, this time I don't think we have it for you. Why not? I need more stuff. Lately the warehouse has stopped producing. If you want to wait, it may be a long time. How's this, when the stuff comes I'll give you a call and let you know. As of now, why don't you go home first. C'mon, help me out. Just switch other people's orders and give me what I need. That's not convenient... - Yo! Phone call! Excuse me. Take good care of him for me. Boss, is that you? Who is that? An old client. Are you sure? Yes sir. I don't think so. Shoot him. But he's our client, boss. I have plenty of clients. I have nothing to lose. Are we ready? It's started. Go! Use our route. This one is yours Your under arrest, asshole. Are you sure?

Lieutenant! Today at 1pm... Jang Sei Yang AKA General Yang, the notorious drug lord... ...was arrested in an abandoned warehouse in Chonburi, which was used a safe house. The US government narcotic agency have contacted the Thai government... ...to have General Yang extradited to the US to stand trial this week.
