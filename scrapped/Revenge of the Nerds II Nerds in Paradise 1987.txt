Despite prejudice, persecution and painful pummelling, the members of Lambda Lambda Lambda fraternity overcame the powerful Alpha Betas and gained control of the Greek Council. It was a victory that underdogs throughout the free world would always remember. It was a defeat the Alpha Betas would never forget. Now the Tri-Lambs face their next challenge. As representatives of Adams, they prepare to join delegates from across the nation at the United Fraternity Conference in legendary Fort Lauderdale. It is a time for fraternity leaders to discuss the philosophy of brotherhood, to set guidelines for their organisations... and get laid. # (man) She... wore... an... # Itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polkadot bikini # That she wore for the first time today # She... wore... an... # ltsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polkadot bikini # That she wore for the first time today (braying laugh) (# "ltsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini" by Devo) - Hey, Gilbert. - Hi, Lewis. I got you some more reading material. - Great minds, huh? - Yeah. Hey, how you feelin'? - Actually, I'm feelin' pretty stupid. - Why? I'm the only guy in the world who could break his leg playing chess. Hey, don't get down on yourself, Gilbert. That was a very tricky move. - Thanks. - Sure. - What's on your mind, Lewis? - I'll tell you, Gilbert. You're the president of this chapter and I don't know if I can lead these guys. Lewis, you're a born leader. You got the looks of a Kennedy and the brains of an Einstein. And the prowess of a Skolnick. - (braying laugh) - (car horn) Hey, that's my dad. I gotta go, Gilbert. OK. - Bye. - Knock 'em dead. - (braying laugh) - I'll be in touch. - Tickets? - (nerds) Check. - Money? - (nerds) Check. - Prophylactics? - (nerds) Che... (braying laugh) You kill me, Dad. You really got the pedal to the metal. Yeah, I do, Dad. I got the cruise control locked in at 35. I'll tell you what. Kick it up to 37. - Let's live dangerously. - Dad! (beeping) Uplink. It's my pager. Here you go, Dad. Just plug that into the lighter. (Mr Skolnick) OK. - It needs 13.8 volts. - Uh-huh. "Gilbert to Lewis." - Hey, it's Gilbert. - (Lamar) Gilbert. (Gilbert) Hi, guys. Ifyou've kept to your timetable, and I bet you have, you're now travelling Highway 116... "approaching the Duttonhoffer cutoff." - God! - God, Gilbert! "Watch out for that pothole." That Gilbert. In any case, guys, I just wanted a chance to tell you to have a good time and beware of those Alphas. They're here. Nerds. - (Poindexter) You know what? - What? According to this, the year-round mean temperature in Fort Lauderdale's 72 degrees. Well, it's located 26 degrees, four minutes north longitude, 80 degrees, nine minutes west latitude. What did you expect? 68 degrees? (braying laugh) Excuse me, miss. I just want you to know that I don't intend to sleep with another woman until I'm back here in your arms with my head resting between your creamy thighs. Jerk. Excuse me, miss. I just want you to know that I don't intend to sleep with another... Excuse me. Are you with the group from Adams College? - Yes, sir. - Great. May I see your tickets, please? Good. Follow me. I'll take you directly to your plane through the VlP entrance. Wow, did you hear that, you guys? We're VlPs. - This is gonna be awesome. - Where did Booger go? - (slap) - (woman) You pig! - We're VlPs. - Right here. Very lmmense Penises. Uh! Well, men, we finally made it. (Wormser sniffs) Is this change in climate affecting your allergies? So far, I'm a little clogged. I wish I had some Hexidol. - 30 or 50 milligrams? - Do you have the liquid? Coagulant or deconstrictant? Just blow your nose on your shirt. That's what I do. Wow. Guys, I think that limo's for us. - (Wormser) Sure this is for the conference? - (Lewis) Yep. Take this, please? Thank you. (# "Back To Paradise" by 38 Special) Oh, my God. I love you! I love you! We're staying at the Royal Flamingo! 555-4369! Hey, you missed a spot! (braying laugh) Hey, guys! Hey, guys! Have a nice time! Wargh! Get the window! Get the window! To Fort Lauderdale. (nerds) To Fort Lauderdale. Look at the size of those coconuts. - (Lewis) Gee, those are big ones. - Wow. I've never seen anything like it. You know, guys, I see no reason why you all have to check in. I mean, I'll do it if you guys wanna hit the beach kinda early. (Booger) Wait up! (# "ltsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini" by Devo) (Booger sighs) (Booger) Boys, our ship has come in. - May I help you, sir? - Yeah, I'm here for the fraternity council. - Ooh! - Whoa! - Are you OK, sir? - I'm fine. Is my hair OK? - Yeah. Um... - Ooh! Stewart! - What's your problem? - Lots of problems. Starting with a painful childbirth, leading up to this embarrassing, awkward moment now. - Com...? - Comstock. Jeffrey and Helen. - C-o-m... - S-t-o-c-k. Yes. That's fine. Sir, excuse me. I just wanted to say that that accident wasn't his fault. It was mine. So I hope nobody was hurt. Or will be. Ow. And that's how we won the Greek Council. I play the violin. Can I get you a drink or something? Don't go away. - Hey, Poindexter, she got a sister? - I don't know. - She's kinda shy. - Yeah. I'm gonna buy her a drink. Jesus. Anybody know how to say "Bite my crank" in Spanish? "Muerde mi manubrio. Por favor." I'm a polyglot. I gotta buy this girl a drink. But, Poin... It was really cool of you to take the blame for me. I thought this was gonna be another in the never-ending series of poundings in my life. - Really? - Yeah. People pound me all the time. - I guess I'm a little screwup. - That's not necessarily true. If you believe in yourself, you can be a big screwup. (braying laugh) What I meant to say was if you believe in yourself, you can be a giant. Lewis Skolnick. - Stewart Lipsey. - How you doin'? - Hi. - I'll see you around. - Sure. - OK. Two rum and Cokes, please. Welcome to the Royal Flamingo. May I help you, sir? - Sir? - Yeah? Yes! Um, sorry. Lewis Skolnick, of the Lambda Lambda Lambda delegation from Adams College. We have a girlfriend. Uh, I mean, a reservation. Oh, no. This computer hates me. Let me get someone who can help you, OK? Uh, you know, I know a thing or two about computers myself. Um, maybe I could help you out. Oh. Well... I type in your name, press "Search" and... nothing. I spotted your problem. It's stroke technique. - Excuse me? - Stroke technique. See, you have to arch your fingers. Try that. - Like this? - Uh-huh. - It worked! - Yeah. See. Look. "Lewis Skolnick. 10..." "Cancelled"? That can't be right. I'm sorry, but your rooms have been given to someone else. We're the Tri-Lambs from Adams College. It's really important that we stay here. I mean, isn't there anything you can do, please? Listen, I'm just a trainee, but let me talk to my manager, Mr Munsinger. - I'm sure he can straighten this out for you. - That'd be great, uh... - Sunny. - Sunny. Thanks. Sorry. Mr Munsinger? Excuse me. Um... the Lambdas are here and the computer shows we gave their room away. - I don't want nerds staying in this hotel. - But this poor guy has no place to stay. Forget it. That room has to stay empty. Why? Fire law. To which fire law are you referring, sir? - Who's the manager of this hotel? - Fred C Dobbs. - Who's the acting manager? - You, sir. - Let's go three for three. Who's the trainee? - Me, sir. - Who's to obey the fire laws if I tell them to? - Me, sir. Excuse me. Now, where am l? Where were we? Geek alert at three o'clock. - Booger! Booger! - Yeow, baby! - Lewis has a problem. - What? He needs our help. Come on. (growls) Come on, Booger. Wormser! So, how far is Daytona Beach from Fort Lauderdale? What? Fort Lauderdale Men's Club, right? No rooms available? OK, thanks. Thanks. - Hey, guys. How's it goin'? - That one's full too. That's the ninth one. Here's a thought. We're only gonna be here five days. Do we really need a room? Oh, wow, look at these geeks. Man, what kind of a fraternity lets these guys in? Listen, Rog, I don't want these nerds hanging around my hotel. Buzz, relax. These guys are history. Watch. Pardon me. Are you guys the Lambdas from Adams College? - Why? - I'm Roger Lattimore. I'm chairman of the United Fraternity Council. Call me Rog. Lewis Skolnick. Lambda Lambda Lambda. Adams. I heard how much trouble you guys had, how you couldn't get a room. - You wouldn't believe it. It's been so trying. - I bet. That's rough. Yeah. I wish I could help you but it's out of my hands. You see, the manager here is a guy named Buzz Munsinger. He's right over there. - Hi, Buzz. - Can you introduce me, Rog? Well, I'd like to, but, you see, Buzz is an Alpha like me. - You mean Alpha Beta? - Yeah. He doesn't want you to stay here. You know how it is. So, I guess you guys'll just leave, huh? Here, I'll call you a cab. - Wait a minute. I think I've found one. - The Hotel Coral Essex. "Full recreation facilities, spacious ocean-view suites." - Sounds great. - Confirm it, Poindexter. - Fantastic. - It was a pleasure meeting you. - I guess we'll see you at the conference. - OK, we'll see you tomorrow. Well, gentlemen, no point in hanging around this dump any longer. Heaven awaits. (Booger) Must be checkout time. They must have had a heck of a party here, guys. (duck squawks) Hello? Hola, mijito. Hablo ingls? Yes, you speak English. We have a reservation. We're the Tri-Lambs. Oh, yes, here it is. No problem. You follow me. Your room is in the Ricky Ricardo Wing. I'm Aldonza, your hostess. If you need anything... # You just call me # Don't be afraid And over here is the beautiful Olympic-sized swimming pool. - You be sure you shower before you use it. - (growling) - Didn't I just see...? - No. - Alejandro, scame Wanda del pool. - (growling) And over here is the wonderful sauna. (coughing) You be sure you leave it the way you find it. And this is Damu, Mamu and Shamu. Boys. - Hey, dogs. - (dogs growl and bark) Down the hall and to the left is the Coke... machine. Over here is the gym. Come on, Daddy. Wanna go around the world with Selena? - Yeah, let me make it good for Daddy. Ooh! - (Aldonza) Yoo-hoo! Babies! Follow me. Big man, you. And over here, this is your room, the Ricky Ricardo Suite. Boys! # (Aldonza) La-da-dee-dada dee-da-da-daa Oh, don't worry. It's just a little evidence. # Magic carpet Now, you just make yourself at home, OK? (all scream) I'm just going to cook you your lunch. # Dee-da-dee-da-da dee-dada-dee Ugh! (metal detector crackles) - Poindexter, that's my pocket protector. - Sorry, Lewis. Harold! Harold! Wow. That's cool. We trashed their house last year. That didn't work. We locked them out of the hotel, they checked into another. - What are we gonna do? - What are you asking us for? - You're the one with the 2.0 average. - 2.2. We can't shake these guys. Christ, there could be a nuclear war, there'd be nothing left but cockroaches and nerds. Let's kill 'em. Nah. Wait a second. I got it. It's so simple. I mean, they're nerds, but they're men too, sort of. And what is the thing that every man in the world is afraid of? - I don't know, Tiny. What? - Come on, guys. You know. At one time or another, every man in this tub has been petrified that a chick is gonna see him naked and see how small his dick really is, right? - Jesus. - Come on, guys, admit it. Yeah, sure. Whatever... Tiny. What? What do you...? It's a reverse nickname. Like they call red-headed guys Blondie and right-handed guys Lefty. Mini-link, are you finished? - And bald guys Hairy. - Will you shut up? We gotta get rid of these guys. We gotta get rid of 'em in a major way. Hold it, fellas. I'm gettin' an idea here. Yeah, by this time tomorrow, the nerds'll be history. (Ogre) Nerds! Ogre, relax. Tomorrow, you'll be at the podium and the nerds'll be packin'. All right, Rog. (laughs) Whoo! (knock on door) (Aldonza) Pony express! - What's this? - I think it's an invitation to a party. "Dear Lambda Lambda Lambda, you are invited to the United Fraternity pre-conference barbecue. " "Fraternally yours, Roger Lattimore." Party, party, party! # (nerds) Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily... (driver) Guys! Guys! The pre-conference barbecue is right down that path. (Lewis) OK. Thanks for the ride. Guys, this is gonna be a blast. We'll see you when it's over. - (driver) Yeah. - (drumming) - Hey, they even have a band. - Just our luck. We get here in the middle of the drum solo. I don't know about this. Something doesn't smell right. That's me. I'm sorry. Anxiety makes me flatulent. Take a Valium or something, for Christ's sake. (woman screams) - Look! - Holy shit! (woman whimpers) (Wormser) This must be one of the last of the Seminole lndian tribes. Jesus H Christ! - Guys, we gotta help her. - (nerds) Uh... - Well, if not us, who? If not now, when? - Somebody else, some other time. No, Lewis is right, guys. Are we mice or are we men? - We are. - We're Tri-Lambs. When the going gets tough the tough get going. That woman there needs our help. Come on, men. Follow me. (woman whimpers) (Booger) Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. - (Wormser) What are they gonna do? - I don't know. - I think they're gonna sacrifice a virgin. - I hope not. A virgin's a terrible thing to waste. There he goes. (Indian chants) Come on, guys. (Wormser moans) (Roger) Hit it, boys. - (woman giggles) - (growling) - (Wormser) What was that? - (Poindexter) I don't know. (woman) Careful. Winston, hit the lights. (nerds scream) - (woman screams) - (Wormser) Oh, no! (Lewis) Oh, my God! Trespassers have witnessed sacred ritual. Must burn clothes and chant... or die as well. - What now, Mr Hero? - Me? - OK. - Comin' right off. - (Booger) We're sorry. - (Wormser) Yeah, real sorry. (nerds intone Buddhist chant) (nerds) Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Intruders must leave Seminole country. So get out of Florida. (chanting continues) Wait, wait. (speaks Seminole) - I don't think those guys are lndians. - Why not? Well, when I said "Bite my crank" in Seminole, no one responded. (Lewis) You said that to these guys? - (growls) - Argh! - (Lamar) My blouse! - (Indians yell) (woman groans) - (Ogre) Nerds! - (nerds) Ogre! - You don't go anywhere. - Damn. I'm gonna kill you guys. Uh, geeks! (nerds scream and whimper) (Indian war cry) (woman) Oh, my! (man) Will someone put some clothes on them? - (woman #2) Look, honey. Nerds. - (woman #3) Are any of those our waiter? (Wormser) Hitchhiking five hours without a ride. (Booger) Would you pick up five guys in their underwear? - Well, at least we're home. - I can't believe this. I've never been so humiliated. Lewis, you must be crazy to think we're gonna stay here. We were fools to think we'd be accepted here. I'm going home where I can not get laid in peace. No, you're not. We were chosen by Adams College to be their representatives. - We're gonna stay here and represent them. - Lewis! Last year we were messed with, but we fought back and we won. We can do it again. That was Adams. This is the real world. I really don't know about you guys, but I'm not giving up. - (woman) They really like that. - (woman #2) Two for one. I'm really sorry I snapped at you guys. (all apologise at once) (all) Go ahead. (all apologise at once) Lewis, we're really sorry. We're not gonna quit on you. Are we, guys? - No. - No. No. All right. (snorting and spitting) (snorting and spitting) This room is a pigsty. Thank you. - You should be ashamed of yourself. - Fuck you. Who died and made you God? My name's Dudley Dawson. They call me Booger. Edgar Po Wong. They call me Snotty. (belches) (chuckles dismissively) (belches loudly and long) (belching continues) Master. My son, soon you will take over. Those geeks look dumber in their underwear than they do in person. (Indian war cry) In my day buttwipes like that couldn't get in fraternities. You went to college to drink, play football and get laid. None of this academic shit. We had our standards. I turned out just fine. I mean, look at me. A hotel manager. Whoa! At least you guys got rid of those geeks. Hear, hear, fellas. Here's to the last of the nerds. Nerds! I don't care what kind of convention you've got, I didn't get a wink of sleep. There was yelling, carrying-on like I don't know what. We thought we heard sheep noises. Why don't I do this? Would you hand me a complimentary pass, please? Here. This is a certificate for a free night the next time you stay with us. Well, all right, but that doesn't excuse it. - I thought I heard power tools. - I am very, very sorry. Enjoy the rest of your stay. - What's this about a free night? - I thought because we're having a ha... I'm not paying you to think. This hotel isn't giving away rooms while I'm acting manager. Unless you wanna have it taken out of your paycheck. Get it? So get your little ass back to work. - That was rude, sir. - Lipsey, you dipshit. - That was rude. I think you should apologise. - What? (Lipsey yells) Safe! - Say, uh... - Stewart. Stewart, yeah. What are you doin'? - Standing up for myself. - Let me help you up. Oh, Stewart. Hi, Sunny. How's your stroke? Mr Skolnick. Did you find a place to stay? Well, actually, you can just call me at the Hotel Coral Essex. I-I mean, you... Stewart, are you OK? I just wanna thank you for standing up for me. - I guess you got fired, huh? - Yeah. - Fired? Who fired you, Stewart? - The manager. The acting manager. Men? - Yeah, just the three of us. - Nerds! Debbie, the car is... There's plenty of room. Yeah. Yeah. No, cos the seats go down. Sure. Don't forget the blueberries and cream. - Are you the manager here? - Yeah. Skolnick, come here. (Ogre growls) Skolnick, you're a smart guy. Don't you understand? You're not wanted here. Wrong, sir. Adams College wants us here. - We are their delegates. - We have a right to be here. - Tell him, Poindexter. - Yes, how correct you are. Excuse me. According to Article 34 of the bylaws of the United Fraternities, all representatives representing represented organisations are allowed, by law, their rightful place. - Yeah, so bite me, all right? - (growls) No, fine. Fine. You're right. You're absolutely right. If that's the law, then... that's the law. So, we are resolved to extend the reach of our domain to include technical and trade schools and English-speaking universities outside of the country. Now, to our last order of business, which concerns constitutional amendments, which will be voted on at tomorrow's session. Uh, Proposition 15, sponsored by the Alpha Betas, will be introduced by Chip "Tiny" Hayes. Excuse me. Uh, Chip "The Meat" Hayes. "Whereas it is a moral obligation of every fraternity to glorify both the body as well as the mind, be it now resolved that all fraternities shall a... shall a... " - Augment. - Thanks. "augment existing academic standards with new physical standards as well." - What? - That's unfair. - That's unconstitutional. - That bites. "Therefore, the membership of each fraternity must meet such physical standards or be excluded from this conference. " Thank you. - And who decides the standards? - (Roger) Pardon me? I said, who decides the standards? Why, your, uh... your democratically elected leaders, of course. - Do I hear a second? - Get the nerds outta here. - I second it. - (Roger) Thanks a lot. Proposition 15 is moved and seconded and will be voted on at tomorrow's ballot. They can kick us out if we don't pass the physical standards. - (Booger) We're screwed. - No, we're not. They're not getting away with this. Point of order! Hey! Point of order! This is totally unfair. Hey, I'll give you the mike as soon as I make this brief announcement. - All right. Make it quick. - Thank you. Gentlemen. Wet nightie contest, poolside, in five minutes. Wet nightie? Whoa! (crowd chants) Gentlemen, we got 24 hours to get through to these people. - But how? - How? They're rational individuals. All we have to do is explain to them that Proposition 15 is unfair and inappropriate. Guys? What are you doing, looking at women like that? You're a kid. You should be ashamed. I made a mistake. We're gonna have to fight fire with fire. I agree. Let's torch their hotel. - No, I mean beat 'em at their own game. - Football? No. I think we should have a "No on 15" party. - Right, guys? We can do it. - Right. The Tri-Lambs prevailed at Adams. We can prevail here. - Wormser, here. - Thanks. - Stewart? - I sure hope this works. If this doesn't get a crowd, I don't know what will. - Hit the switch. - Hit the switch. - Hit the switch. - Hit the switch. Hit the switch. - (Stewart) Wow! - (Booger) All right! - Hey, you guys, that worked great! - I don't get it. Ave Maria. (man) Party! Oh, thank you, God, for my five little babies. - It's party time! - (Lamar) Hit it!

I guess I underestimated these guys. Motion is carried. Proposition 15 is hereby removed from the agenda and is rendered moot. - They actually did it. - Maybe the Alphas aren't such bad guys. Now, I have one final order of business. Could Lewis Skolnick, president of the Adams College chapter of Lambda Lambda Lambda, come up to the podium, please? - Go. - Go. (Roger) In order to make certain that this organisation is never again embarrassed by such misguided deeds as the Alphas are guilty of, I hereby propose the following constitutional amendment. Henceforth, any fraternity guilty of illegal or improper conduct shall be expelled from the United Fraternity Conference and their national charter revoked. And, Lewis, I'd like the record here today to reflect that we introduced this proposition together. OK, Rog. (Roger) Let's officially bury the hatchet between the Tri-Lambs and the Alphas and put this joint amendment to a vote. I think I'm gonna cry. - All those in favour? - (audience) Aye! - Hey, guys. - Here you are, fellas. It's all yours. I know it must be kind of overwhelming, but, uh... we just wanted you guys to know how sorry we were. You know, Lewis, I hate to use "party" as a verb, but you guys can really party. We were impressed. Yeah. God, you know, Rog? We must be dreaming. Nah. If we were dreaming I'd have a boner. - Boner! - That's great! To truly hock a loogie, one must not retrieve the phlegm from the throat... but from the soul. Oh, God, Gilbert, I really wish you were here. The Alphas down here are so great. Listen to you. Are you telling me that they called you up, they invited you over to their hotel, and then they gave you their suite? - Yeah. Yeah, it's just incredible. - It's too incredible. Lewis, I know you, and I know that sometimes you're so eager to be liked that you don't take the time to see people for who they really are. Are you saying I'm some kind of weenie who can't take care of himself? - I'll tell you, I'm not that kind of weenie. - Lewis, I just want you to be careful. Remember, once an Alpha, always an Alpha. - Ow! - Sorry. Hey, Boog, let's go. (hums throatily) (fly buzzes) (spits) (fly stops buzzing) Ah. Now, my son, you are ready to go out into the world. Awesome, Booger. And don't forget the whipped cream. So, you guys just get the nerds into my car alone, and I'll take care of the rest. You understand? - Yo. - You bet. Great. Sir? Oh, yes, Sunny, I have a job for you. Mr Lattimore'll explain it to you. Sunny, I just feel terrible about the way I treated the Tri-Lambs, and I thought maybe you guys could take 'em out and, I don't know, show 'em a good time. Actually, you could use my car if you want. Well, that's awfully sweet of you but, I mean, I have to work. - Buzz? - Part of your job is taking care of customers. These are important guests. I want to make them happy. You what? Earlier, I erred in my judgement. These Tri-Lambs are, uh, good nerds. Men. Look, just do your job, will you? Yes, sir. And, uh, Sunny... have a good time, OK? Yes, sir. Bye-bye. You know, guys, Gilbert, UN Jefferson, all our brothers, they're gonna be so proud of us. Gents? Uh-oh. I think we're in their seats, guys. (Lamar) It looks like they're coming to talk to us. (Booger) Whatever's in this drink, I want a case. It's not the drinks, it's us. Guys. See, we're winners, and it shows. - Shall we? - What? Jump 'em? Talk to 'em. Find out what they're like, what they're thinking about. - Find out what they look like naked. - Find out if she's got a brother. Find out how long they've been listening to us. - Hi, Sunny. - Hello again. - Hi. - Yo. - Nice day. - Beautiful. - Wow. - Yo. - Paradise. - It is. - (Lori) You bet. - (Michelle) Yo. So, you wanna get funky or what? (# "Funky Town" by Pseudo Echo) - Lewis? - Yeah? Would you rub some of this lotion on my back? - Yeah. - Thanks. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Well... actually, the truth of the matter is, Sunny, I'm a little nervous. - Nervous? - Yeah. I mean... I'm not really the cool dude I seem to be. - Oh, no? - Uh-uh. I mean, I've never even... really rubbed lotion on anybody except Poindexter there. - I can't believe this. - What? Uh, rubbing lotion on a girl who, uh, could date anybody she wanted in the entire state of Florida. - I don't date that much at all. - Get outta town. Guys like Roger ask you out all the time. Guys like Roger barely have enough glial cells to be considered primates. - It's the shyer guys you wish would ask. - Did you just say "glial cells"? - Yeah. I was speaking facetiously, of course. - Of course. Everybody knows they are measured not in quantity but in respect to their ratio to neurons in the parietal lobe. Sunny, you're amazing. Hey, guys, we're thirsty. You wanna go get us some brewski? Brews... Yeah! Yeah, we'll get you some brews. What do you say we kill off some of those excess glial cells? - OK. - We'll be back in a flash. Guys, come on. Beer run. Don't worry. We'll be gone in no time. What do you mean? # (Lamar and Wormser) 4,749,681,999 bottles of beer on the wall # 4,749,681,999 bottles of beer # If one of those bottles should happen to fall # 4,749,681,998 bottles of beer on the wall (Lewis) OK, you guys, you get the suds. I gotta go drain the lizard. Bye. Get some chips, Poindexter. Anything you want, Admiral. I got beer! I got beer! I got... - Freeze! - Busted. Get your hands up! Turn around! You're under arrest. - For what? - Grand theft auto. A Roger Lattimore reported this vehicle stolen from the Royal Flamingo. Oh, no. That's a misunderstanding, Officer. That car was lent by the beautiful girls who are our dates. Beautiful girls? Oh. Get your hands up! Turn around. (guard) Let's go, fellas. - Come on. - "We're winners" you said. - "They can see it" you said. - OK, so I'm stupid. - You believed me. What does that make you? - A felon. Right here. - No, I'm only 15. I'm just a kid. - That's not what it says here, Senator. (inmate) Damn! I gotta get outta here. I liked her. I actually believed her. I was thinking "Lewis, this beautiful girl, she likes you." You were thinking, just using the wrong head. There's something of greater importance here. Yeah? Like what? Like it's gonna be a bit inconvenient finishing college from jail. - I studied really hard this year. - (Poindexter) Know what occurred to me? The amendment Lewis cosigned could be used against us to destroy the Tri-Lambs. Gosh darn it to heck anyway. Do you mind? I'm cursing. Hey! Would you back off? We're just speaking quietly amongst ourselves and it does not pertain to you. - What are we gonna tell Dean Ulich? - Listen, you little geek... Listen, buttface! I'm in no mood to deal with an idiot like you! Now, why don't you just sit down before you really make me mad?! Lewis! Lewis, do you realise you just said "buttface" to the missing link? - I did? - And really loud, too. (chanting) No more nerds! No more nerds! No more nerds! No more nerds! No more nerds! No more nerds! No more nerds! Yo, yo, yo, yo. Yo, I'm looking for my homeboys. Yeah? Well, it looks like you got us instead. Hey, Rog. I thought we were gonna get rid of these nerds. - Yeah, so did l. - What did you do with the Tri-Lambdas? Argh! What did you say, nerd? Tell me what you did with the Tri-Lambdas now or you guys are in big trouble. - (Gundy) Big trouble. - (Winston) Big trouble. Fellas, relax. Come here, Stewart. You're right. I should tell you. - It's really very sad. - Sad? What are you talkin' about? Well, you see, the guys... the guys are all in jail. What? - Yeah, they... they stole my car. - They stole your car? - But you wanna know the saddest part? - Yeah. They're about to get their whole fraternity thrown out of the conference. - What do you mean "thrown out"? - Ogre, didn't he call you a homo? Homo? Whoa! Hey, Buzzo, we've got a problem here. Hey, nerd! I thought I'd fired you. (Ogre laughs) Nerd! Oh, my God! What happened? - We're in trouble. - What's wrong? They said the Tri-Lambs stole a car and they were thrown in jail. But I know my friends wouldn't do that. - Wait a minute. Who told you this? - Them. - Good shot. - Here's a problem that just won't go away. Yeah. Just like my crabs. - Wha...? - Oh, Jesus. - Let's go finish these geeks off. - Guys, it's just a joke. Guys, I don't have crabs. Seriously! Guys, I'll show you if you wanna see. - So long, suckers. - You guys are all right? - Stewart! - Hey! How are you? How was doin' hard time? Hard time! How did you get the money to bail us out? Oh, I didn't. She did. You. Lewis, I'm sorry. I swear I didn't know. - (Sunny) Lewis, wait! - I say we fight back now. It doesn't matter any more. They'll just find another way to try to get rid of us. - They'll send somebody else like her. - What? Yeah. You're not worth the lotion I squirted on you. - Lewis, I swear to you, I didn't know. - Oh, I'm so sure. Just get 'em in the van. We just don't fit in. Yo. You sound like I used to sound before you taught me how to fight for myself. Well, why don't you just forget it? Don't you understand? It doesn't matter that we're good dressers, or we have good personal hygiene. No, wait. Don't you get it, man? People don't want us around. No shit, Skolnick. Surprise! This way, nerd! - Come on! Come on, let's go. - (Wormser) Help! (Ogre) Come on, we gotta get outta here! Let's go! Hurry! - (Ogre) Come on, get him out here. - (Tiny) Come on. Ogre, you swine! You might have brought us out here, but there is no way you'll make me stay in that cabin another minute. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! - Ogre. Ogre. In the water. - Oh, that's right. I forgot. - You guys are unbelievable. - We spared you, didn't we? Aaaargh! Whoa! Aargh! Aaaaaaargh! - (Ogre) Hope you like living with the fish! - (Tiny) Have a nice swim! OK, fellas, let's get outta here. No, wait a minute. I'm getting the hell outta here. Excuse me. Weird chick, man. - Excuse me. - What's with you? (Roger) Hey, Sunny! Have fun with the geeks. Hey, nerd! We sure are gonna miss you tomorrow at the convention, when we get your asses exterminated! I can't wait to tell everybody how we outsmarted 'em, we framed 'em, and we got 'em arrested, for doin' nothin'! Ogre, listen to me, and try and understand. If you tell them that, it's gonna give us away. Let's just keep it our little secret, OK? Secret, my ass. I can take care of anything. - Fellas? - I'll tell the world! - He's history. - History? Whoa! No! Help! I can't swim! Man overboard! Hey! Guys! Ogre's drowning! (Ogre) Come on! Help! I can't swim! Oh, God! I'm sinking now! Wow. - I'm gonna die! - Ogre. Ogre. Just relax. Relax. - Oh! - Relax. - I'll pull you. - You're a strong little guy. - Ogre, I'll pull you. Just relax. - Swim faster! Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I thought I was gonna die. You're a strong swimmer. Wow. What? Let me go, you fruit. I carried you this far. You work your way in on your own. (Wormser) But I saved your life! (Tiny) See you at the convention! - Are you all right, Harold? - Piece of cake. Hey, what are you geeks looking at? Those guys just dropped me off to nerd-sit. Boy, this is great. The perfect ending of the Tri-Lambs. Even on a deserted island we got somebody callin' us geeks. Oh, we're gonna do great things at this convention. I don't know what the hell I was thinking. We are geeks. I mean, look at us. We're not like anybody else and we never will be. - Ah, Lewis! - Lewis! - So, what do we do now? - (Poindexter) Maybe we should build a fire. Split up. Let's find some wood. Come on, Worm. Don't even get me started, Wormser. We're gonna be here till you're old and grey. Damn Alpha Betas! Just my freaking luck. Bush. We've got bush! Would you mind if I sit here for a while? It's getting pretty cold on the beach. - (Stewart) Sure, come on down. - (Booger) Have a seat. Uh... - (coughs) - (Ogre grunts) Why not? - You want a hit? - Me? - Yes, you. Come on. - Sure. You don't mind? (coughs) So, what you're saying, essentially, is that along with infinite space, which extends beyond perpetual bigness, there's also infinite smallness? How? Easy. Take an asymptotic line and extend it outward. Oh. Right, right, right. So perpetual bigness exists simultaneously with perpetual smallness. What was I thinking? (coughs) What if c-a-t really spelled "dog"? - Wow. - Yeah. That's heavy, Ogre. - Dog. - Wow. Kind of a bummer, huh? - Gilbert? - Hello, Lewis. - How did you get here? - Don't ask me. It's your dream. - I woke up. - No, you dreamed you woke up. Ow! Ow! Well, thanks a lot, Gilbert. I was dreaming about three naked girls. I know, Lewis, and I'm a little shocked. - Come on, Lewis. - Come on. Don't even think about it. You're still dreaming. You're not awake. Look. (snores) Wow. Hey, what do you know, Gilbert? I know you're acting like a complete weenie. What happened to the old Lewis? Well, he got dropped on a deserted island with Ogre, of all people. Those people think we're a bunch of nerds and I think they're right. It doesn't matter what they think, Lewis. It only matters what you think. Did you forget everything we learned at Adams? Come here. Now, what do we have here? We have a great group of guys. But they need someone to make them feel proud about themselves, not ashamed. She's not one of the guys, Gilbert. - She betrayed me. - (mimics) She betrayed me. - She did! - Lewis, use your brain. She wouldn't be here if she didn't care about you. (snoring) - Hey, will you keep it down? - (snores) I don't wanna wake me up. Gilbert's my best friend and this is an important dream. You guys know that. Listen, Lewis. She's a great girl. You're a great guy. If she doesn't like you for who you are, she's not good enough for you. - I know that. How do you know that? - I don't know that. You know that. - I know that. - I'm not Gilbert, just your image of Gilbert. Gilbert, stick to the subject. I don't know how long you're gonna be here for. I'm sorry. The subject is, you're acting like a weenie. - I am. - But it's not too late. We've gotta get off this island. Those guys are gonna vote us out of existence. - You've gotta get outta here. - Yeah. Now, time is running short. Your course is clear, Lewis. You look great. I believe in you. - What happens now, Gilbert? - Well, now you gotta wake up. So I gotta go. It doesn't always work. (braying laugh) See ya. - So long. - Night, guys. (snoring) (Lewis) Gentlemen, awaken! Let's go! Come on! Up! Everybody up! Move your butts! - Sunny. Sunny, I'm sorry. - What? Come on, please, Sunny. I've been ignorant and proud. - You have. - Yeah. Well, can you forgive me? Real ignorant and proud. I know, but they're gonna vote us out of existence. We can't let that happen. The vote is in six hours. We're stranded here. What do you want? Whenever you have a small group of people with an aggregate lQ of over 1,000, anything's possible. - (Ogre) Amen. - Yeah. So, who's with me? - I am. - All right! Enough of the hugging. Let's go kill 'em. (Wormser) We have to determine our location. Well, given our travel time of 122 minutes and 47 seconds, and a headwind of 14.7 knots, if we take the crossvariables, factor out the constants, that's two degrees times by two kilometres. That'd be two plus two. That would be... Four! Four! Right. Well, that means that we are no more than... 44.74 miles from the southernmost tip of Florida. Just a little to the left. OK. Stop. A little to the right. OK. See, the angle of the sun will pinpoint our exact latitude and longitude. OK, stop. Now a little to the left. Wormser! 22.3. - Rodriguez lsland. - Frederico Rodriguez? What was he? An old boyfriend or something? (Sunny) General Rodriguez stole military supplies from Castro during the Bay of Pigs. He hid them on his island - this island. - (nerds) This island? - Yeah. - And they never found the stuff? - No. - There must be tons of shit around here. - If your calculations are correct. (Lewis) Wow, military supplies. Now all we gotta do is find the stuff. Right, Poindexter? (Poindexter) OK. Tell me again what you did. (Stewart) I ionised the coconut milk and de-ionised the sea water, using your glasses to distil the silica from the sand. And then I reversed the polarity of the magnetisation. - It's pretty crude, but it just might work. - Gee, I hope it works. (Ogre) You guys built this thing. Too bad you can't carry it yourselves. - (Poindexter) Ogre, sh. - Come on, geek. I'm carrying this thing. (tapping) (tapping speeds up) Loud? - Spread out! Spread out! - Let's look for it, guys. - Hey, you guys! I found a cable! - So did we. Uh-oh! - Hey! Geek! Geek! - Sh! (Poindexter screams) (Ogre groans) Hey, guys. Bingo! (Lewis) Hey, Booger. Booger, come here, man. Check this out. - What the hell is it? - I don't know but there is a whole lot of it. Could be our ticket out. And now the last order of business before we close this convention. As many of you already know, the Adams College chapter of Lambda Lambda Lambda disgraced itself yesterday by being arrested on a charge of grand theft auto. Pursuant to the recently adopted constitutional amendment, we must now vote on whether to expel those Lambdas from the conference and to terminate its national charter. Before we vote, do the Lambdas have anything to say in their defence? Anything at all? Wait. If I could just interject for a second here. I find this really insulting. I mean, I guess the Lambdas don't feel they have to explain their actions to their brothers. (rumbling) (woman screams) If we can just have a little order... then we can get this whole sad event behind us. All those in favour of expelling the Lambdas, please signify by saying... (rumbling) What is that? - Gentlemen! - It's the nerds! They're back! And they're bad! - Don't panic, please. We just wanna be heard. - That's my leg! Poindexter, stop! - (Sunny) Wait! Stop! - Sit down! There's a motion on the floor! - (Lewis) Poindexter, stop. We're here. - All right! I'm trying! I'm trying! - Oh, my God! - Watch out! (Booger) Cut it out, you crazy maniac! (Poindexter) I can't stop this. (girl) Oh, wow. - Nice job, Poindexter. - Yo. - Can I borrow your mike? - Sure, man. Thanks. Everyone, could I have your attention, please? - Take your time. I don't want anybody hurt. - Sorry, pal. I would like to speak in our defence. No remarks. There's a motion on the floor to have you expelled. - My statement'll be brief. - Fellas, get him. (Lambda) Be cool now. Hey, we wanna hear what the brother has to say. - Sure thing. - Right, Tiny? (high-pitched voice) Yeah. (laughter) - You're dead, nerd. You're dead meat. - (Lewis) Hey, Tri-Lambs. Thanks, guys. Ogre. Where's Ogre? What did you guys do to Ogre? (Ogre) Hey! Hi, Rog. Ogre. Ogre, baby, you're beautiful. Are you OK? - I am fine. - (Roger) Come here. I got a job for you. Oh, really? Great. Come here. Take a look at these guys. Now, tell me what these guys have in common. I don't know, Rog. They're all wearing green. Come on, Ogre. Take a closer look. They're ugly. They're wearing funny clothes. They're different. I mean, look at this pathetic bunch of losers. You got an effeminate little pansy. - Hey! - You got a four-eyed geek. You got a nose-pickin' pervert. And where's the king, the monitor of this special-ed class? That's enough. Nobody talks about my brothers that way. I wouldn't worry about it considering they're all about to get expelled for stealing my car. They didn't steal that car. They were framed. I was there and he set them up. OK, OK. Maybe I did. Maybe I did. Now, what are you gonna do about it, Skolnick? You gonna make a little speech? It's not gonna do any good. Wanna know why? Cos I'm strong, and you're weak. Cos I'm the type of guy that everyone here wants to be like, and you are pathetic. It's the way it is. It's the way it's always gonna be. There's nothing you or your pencil-necked geek friends can do or say about it. Comprende, dickhead? You're right, Rog. There's nothing I can say about it. But there's something I've gotta do about it. - (crowd gasps) - (grunts) (crowd applauds and cheers) Lewis, you stud, you! (chanting) Nerds! Nerds! Nerds! (Roger) Ogre! - Ogre! - (grunts) - Ogre! - (growls) (Lewis) Dear brethren, we are called together today to initiate the newest member of the Lambda Lambda Lambda fraternity. Do you, Frederick Aloysius Polowoski, solemnly swear to stand together with your fellow brethren with dignity and compassion, to respect all those who pass through these doors and to uphold all the values that we hold dear to the Tri-Lambs. I do. (Lewis) Are we ready with the ceremonial punch? - (Lewis) Frederick. - (Ogre) Ogre, Louie. - (Lewis and Gilbert) Frederick. - (Ogre) Oh. Hup! O Lambda truest, I am the newest member of your clan, and in your... - (nerds) Hallways. - hallways, I swear I'll always be proud of what I am. And now, our newest Tri-Lamb may drink. (gulps and slurps) (Ogre gasps) (braying laugh) (# "Back To Paradise" by 38 Special) (braying laugh)
