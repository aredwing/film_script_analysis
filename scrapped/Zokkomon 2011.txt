 

                        - Hey Kunal, come on and join us! - Yes man! You mustjoin in. Hey shortie! Beat me and l'll treat you to an ice cream. - Bet! - Bet! Good morning, Sir! Go, Kunal. - Who wins, brains or brawn! - Brawn! - Got you! Got you! - Kunal... Kunal... - Yes! - Father Peter would like to meet you. l'll have my ice cream when l return. Kunal, l've received a letter from your Uncle and... ... there is something you should know. Your Uncle insists that he wants you to study in the school run by him in his town. But Sir, l don't want to go there. Son, since the last three years after your parents passed away.. ..we have tried to make this school your home. But my child... Your Uncle is your legal guardian. Sir, please Sir... Please sir. There is nothing l can do. l want to stay here. Please sir. Sorry Kunal... l am so sorry. Far, far away... is a valley ln that valley... is a town The days and nights are strange Everything there is unusual Lend me your ears listen to this tale There's a small town And the story begins there All through the year The seasons are lovely The streets are lined with trees and their shade And flowers on every branch that never seem to fade There's a small town And the story begins there All through the year The seasons are lovely The streets are lined with trees and their shade And flowers on every branch that never seem to fade The people here know not about the outside world This town's thinking is centuries old What a town, O Lord What a town, O Lord They have joys and sorrows but know little of the world outside Their simplicity is their downfall Those they revere, fool and betray them The streets are lined with trees and their shade And flowers on every branch that never seem to fade The people here know not about the outside world This town's thinking is centuries old What a town, O Lord! Though darkness has spread This deceit shall pass A new dawn shall come People will arise O gentle and meek, hear this! Here he is... First he was a curse for his parents, now it's us! - Bless you! - That's enough... Baban... take him in. Son, sit down and stay away from him... he is jinxed. Do you think you're royalty! Your parents send you to school so that you learn... ... you study, so that we can make humans out of you. Backsides up! And in today's world to become human you need? English. Teacher go fartee. This means the teacher has gone to drink tea. Repeat after me: Teacher go fartee. Hey you rabbit, why are you showing me your teeth. Sir... it's not teacher go fartee. ''Teacher has gone for tea'' is correct English. Heard that? The school belongs to his uncle... ... while the English language belongs to his aunt. And himself - he's royalty. Now he will teach us English. Come here. From Dehradun is he! An Englishman is he! To his senses will come he! When a home grown slap wakes he! Now he'll go home with a long face and won't act smart from today. Kunal... This is how it is here, Kunal. Never say anything clever. Fomenting will help. He hit me on the other cheek. Missing your old school in Dehradun? The teachers there never beat you? Did they punish you? The teachers spoke with a smile? Do the masters there laugh? lmpossible! At most, those masters may smile sometimes. Here the masters only beat us. Just because we're small, they beat us when they want? They will punish us? Force us to stand with our hands up? And we can do nothing! What can we do? We may want to do so many things. But kids are helpless. They are so lazy. Not ''lazy'', ''weak''. Yes children are weak... lf you think you're weak, you are weak. My mother used to tell me... ''You're as strong as you believe you are.'' You're as strong as you believe you are. Take this, my love! Oh... look how greedily he is looking at my baby. - Give him a bit... - No! No! Give it, my son. Otherwise his evil eye will ruin your appetite. Happy birthday, Kunal. Happy birthday, Kunal. Arju, catch me if you can! Kunal! Ghosts live there. - Stop yelling! Or you'll alert them. - There are no such thing as ghosts. Kunal, there are ghosts in there. Bad things happen to anyone who enters. lt can't be true. lt's true. That's why even Pehalwaan Mama is afraid to enter that house. There are ghosts here. My parents said there are no ghosts and they never told lies. There are no ghosts. lf there are no ghosts, l dare you to enter that house! Come on, if you've got the guts. - See, you got scared! - l'm not scared of anything. Then enter that house. Go. Actually nobody's forcing you. lf you're scared, forget it. l'm not a coward. Kunal, stop! What will happen to him? You're as strong as you believe you are. Kunal, run! He's a mad man! - He is dangerous. - He makes children disappear. He practises black magic. Run Kunal! Here you go, Sir! Sir, you're looking so handsome... just like a bridegroom. Focus on your work and don't forget! Please excuse me for being late. People of that village were so happy that... ...l was giving them a new school... just not letting me go... raining garlands! They told me to plead with you to sanction the grants soon. l told them how big-hearted you all were. What will you have - tea, coffee, something cold? May l speak to ddddd... Deshrajji, please? - Shahrukh! King Khan! - Unbelievable! King Khan for the world. But for you... l will always be the middle-class boy from Delhi with dreams in his eyes. You were the first to see those dreams. Shahrukh, please. Giving me more credit than l deserve! Deshrajji, l rang up to congratulate you. l've come to know you're opening five more schools. Shahrukh, with your support my dream to open up 5,000 schools will surely come true. ln fact, the Education Officer is sitting right in front of me. Then l have called at the right time. Give him the phone. He wants to speak to you. Shahrukhji, l'm Shyamlal Markanda. l'm a huge fan of yours. Markandaji... ... forget about screen heroes, let's talk about real life heroes. Like our Mr. Deshraj. one of the finest educationists in the country. He really deserves all your help and support. Yes, Sir... certainly, Sir... Thank you, Sir. Markandaji, thanks to you, Sir! Goodbye! Khudahaafiz! God bless! You are too kind, Sir. He has hung up. Never forgets what l've done for him. Anyway, let's get down to business. - She is... - l forgot to introduce to you... ... she is Choudhary Madam, from the state audit department. Okay. Sit down, Deshrajji. we have studied your proposal but there is a serious problem. Your accounts show that 6 million rupees are missing. Money sanctioned by the government for library, laboratory, benches... ... seems to have been diverted to your personal account. ln fact, l've come here for your .. .. explanation before l file a police complaint. Police! - Can't we do something? - There is a plan. You know my brother left some money for Kunal? Notjust some money. ... but he gets the money only when he's 21 . But if anything happens to Kunal... ...then the money goes to his only relatives. That's us. Oh, we can't do that. Oh, so we can't do that! lnstead l should rot in jail. Or better still drown in the river... ... or hang myself. But we can't do that! Stop it! What do l have to do? Kunal! - Would you like a ride? - No, Uncle, l am afraid of heights. Would you like to try this ride? No, Uncle, remember l told you, l am afraid of heights. And l told you there is nothing to be afraid of. Would you sit with me? l? Please, Uncle... l am afraid of heights. Don't worry, son. We have come all the way here, let's try one ride at least. Please, Uncle, l feel nauseous. No, son, we have already purchased the tickets. Opportunities likes these are rare. Sit and enjoy... Uncle... Uncle... Uncle! Uncle... l am not your Uncle! Uncle... Hello! Rajrani, tell everyone Kunal died in a train accident. Oh God, he was so young... You should have killed me instead. Give it to me... come on... let go. - l want the bag... - Even l want it... Let go! Get lost... you scoundrels. Got scared! l'm not afraid of anyone. Good. You're as strong as you believe you are. What did you say? - You're as strong as... - you believe you are. My mother taught me that. Good. Oh! Same to same. Teached the truth. What's a kid like you doing in a place like this? l came here with my uncle. He took me to the theme park... ... and there l got lost. Give me your address, l'll take you home. lt's very far away... in the hills... l'll tell you what. Tonight, stay with me. Tomorrow morning, we'll go find your uncle. No, it's okay, l'll manage. Your wish! Great house... ... and lovely neighbours. Good night! - What happened? - Nothing... You should not be alone so late at night. l'll come with you. Getting lost is not such a bad thing. Sometimes we have to lose ourselves to find ourselves. - By the way, my name's Kitu. - Kunal! Let's go! Kitu Didi! - Come! - Kitu Didi! Be quiet! What is this place? This is a warehouse, costumes and props from films are kept here. Why did we enter through a window? What difference does it make? My dear! When people shut the doors of their hearts, we enter through the window. Does this place belong to you? Kunal, for an artist the whole world is her home. During the day, l draw people's portraits... ... and at night, this becomes my home. lsn't it wrong to live in someone else's place? Now you listen, old man... it's wrong for humans to sleep on pavements where rich kids drive over them. Nothing's wrong with living here. - You live alone? - Yes. And your family? Kitu Didi, don't you have a family? Forget it. Life is very cruel, you'll not understand. l may be small but l know how cruel life is. Tell everybody the truth. What happened on that day! what happened that day? Tell us.. Go on, son... tell them what happened that day. Kunal entered the haunted house. We warned him not to enter. l told him bad things happen to people who go in. But... Who can avoid destiny! His death was pre-ordained. His death was the wrath of the ghosts. lt's the revenge of the ghosts! Kunal, where are your mom and dad? My mom and dad... on a mountaineering trip... ... they had an accident. Kunal, do you know that after good people die... ... they become stars. Come let's find your mom and dad in the sky. - Kitu Didi! - Yes. When there were no human beings on earth, there were still stars. Meaning? There is no connection between people dying and stars. l may be small but l know the truth. You talk like a wise man, but you've not understood one thing. What? Sometimes we have to look at the .. .. world not with our minds, but with our hearts. What good will that do? Stars leap out of our science books and become our friends. The moon becomes more than the earth's satellite. He becomes your pal. Understand? Wait, l'll make you understand. No matter what, always smile All that happens, let it go The world may be upside down But there's one truth my heart knows Where joy abounds, that's real life All that happens, let it go Take that worry off your face Just as you dust off your coat May sorrow never reside ln your heart that's pure inside All that happens, let it go All that happens why it does no one knows Why some lose, why some win no one knows Look at this circus called life People walk the never-ending streets Everyone with hope in their eyes They stumble and fall They know not what's going on Argument and fights galore They scream, their voices sore Get it, got it? Did you? All that happens Why it does no one knows Where joy abounds, that's real life All that happens, let it go Every day troubles grow We still love the world so After all it is our home Let's nurture it Appreciate it Let flowers bloom Love each other Nurture love Make friends Sing songs of happiness All that happens Why it does no one knows Why some lose, why some win no one knows Deshrajji, please stay calm. His face was so smashed. The ghosts have claimed Kunal. May the gods give you and your family strength. Please give us a private moment with Kunal. - That's enough, Rajrani. They have left. - Yes. Poor Kunal. l will always miss Kunal. lf you miss him, thats ok! Sir. Sir, what if he comes back? lmpossible. Jhunjhunmakadstrama... ... such a tongue-twister. Will he remember our town's name? Can he make the long journey and find this place? And how long do you think he'll survive on the city's mean streets? - There must be some confusion, Kunal. - No, Kitu Didi. l'm sure. He deliberately left me behind. See, we'll do one thing. l'm taking you back home. l want to find out... ... what kind of person would leave you behind? But, if they're not happy to see me, can l come back with you? Kunal, l don't even have a home. Home is where you are. Run, Kunal! Taxi... Station... Go! Go! Hurry up! Hey... stop! Come! Sit down. l'll get us some snacks. Please give me a packet of fries. When will you stop doing this, Kitu? Kitu Didi...! l haven't done anything! Kunal, don'tjump! Go to your uncle's house. l'll find you there. l promise. This girl must have been living in that godown ..for at least three months. You've just discovered it? Since when? - Six months, five days. - And before that? - Five months at the Museum. - And before that? - Two months in lnorbit Mall. Why do you do this, Kitu? This time you'll go in for some time. Take her away. Thank you, Uncle... Bye! Kunal? Babloo! Wait for me, Babloo! Ghost! Ghost! Kunal's ghost! - Have you gone mad? - l swear, there is a ghost out there. Give him a glass of water. Ghost! Kunal's ghost! Window! Through the window! Because he died in an accident his soul is not at rest. That's why he returned as a ghost. God knows what havoc it will create. Open the door! Mummy! Papa! - Come in, you are wet. - What happened! Papa! Kunal's ghost... l saw Kunal's ghost. Oh God! He's come back! Now what will we do? What are you searching for? Please don't do anything you'll regret later. People think he's a ghost. There's no punishment for killing a ghost! Oh God! Deshrajji, did you see Kunal's ghost? Ghost? Get out! l'm a ghost. Get out! - Really, l'm a ghost. l said, Get out! - l told you no, l'm a ghost. Don't come close. - Get out! Stupid boy! There are no ghosts. Please don't throw me out. My uncle wants to kill me. So you are Kunal! Please let me stay here tonight. Help me please. Why should l help anyone? You don't need a reason to help someone. All folks are warned. The ghost of a boy is roaming the town. Fools! ldiots! They will always remain idiots! Superstitious! They believe in ghosts and they call me mad! Why is everybody calling me a ghost? - You're dead. Your uncle has even performed your last rites. There are two kinds of people in the world! Those who make others fools and those who become fools. Don't follow me. You'll regret it. Leela, l have to leave this place soon. l need to get home. - Home! Yes, Leela, l have to leave this place by any means possible. Kunal must be waiting for me. Magic... just magic. How dare you! What are you doing here? Get out of here! Magic... Uncle, just magic. l'm not your uncle and this is science, not magic. Don't call science, magic! l am sorry. But l know this is a laser projection. So? Laser means: light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. There is no place for science in this town. Get out of here or you will become just like them. But you too live in the same town. l don't live in the town! l live in this haunted house! Go away! Don't show your unlucky face again. Go away! Why do you think this ghost has come to haunt the town? To wreak revenge on those that troubled him when he was alive. They never forgive. This is the revenge of the ghosts. Revenge of the ghosts! Where are you going? l'm leaving. - You're going nowhere. l'm leaving. - You're not leaving. l have to go. Kitu Didi will come to take me away. Kitu Didi! Even in your sleep you were muttering about her. Nobody is coming here. - She will come. She promised. Don't go. l can show you how to get even with your Uncle. l don't want to get even with anybody. My Uncle and Aunt don't love me. The teachers in school are cruel. l have nobody here. Go away then! l'll fight alone. l need no one. He's turned out a coward like the rest. lf he had stayed, people would have realized the truth about Deshraj. This town could have been transformed. But, he too had no courage. l am with you, Magic Uncle. l never lose courage. We'll change the face of this town. For now you're no longer a small boy... ... you're a dangerous ghost which the entire town is terrified of. Just as steel cuts steel, fear will be used to drive away fear. You will do this. - But what if l get caught? - lmpossible! With science at the service of a ghost? Never! You're as strong as you believe you are. Listen brother, it's time to rise To accept without a thought is just not wise Look, think, understand, recognize To blindly accept is just not wise Listen brother, it's time to rise To accept without a thought is just not wise Look, think, understand, recognize To blindly accept is just not wise For ages the world has been in the dark Now you need to shine like a bright spark lt's been said before and l'll say it again When the courage is within you There is nothing you lack - Zokkomon? - Yes, Zokkomon! Don't you know how to sweep? - Come on... faster! - Haven't you eaten? Why are you so late? Were you waiting for an invitation? Son, please eat this. lt's very tasty. You think you're royalty! Hurry up! l'll slap both of you now. Can't you see the dust in that corner. Polish it so well that anybody looking.. ..at the statue will be impressed. Sir! Our Deshraj sahib really looks impressive. Why not! Craftsmen came all the way from Jaipur to carve out this statue. Our Deshrajji is no less than a king. He does not allow even a fly to sit on his nose. His nose is cut! Where is his nose? Who is it? Who dared to do this? Who is it? Who dared to do this? l will skin you rascals alive. We did nothing, Sir. lt happened by itself. How? Sir, from that corner... the rascal is hiding over there. l'll get him! Please come, Sir! We will get him! We won't let him escape! Be careful, Sir! Check there! Sir! Help... help! Ghost! - Sir! What happened? - Ghost! From up, from down. Stop! How was l born? Where am l from? What will l do? Who am l? l am your inner voice, l am Zokkomon. Listen carefully ... ... because very soon we shall meet again! Sir, the ghost... he's going to come again. He will come every day. Shantaram, stop crying! Go home and keep your mouth shut! There is no such ghost. He's an imposter. Papa, it's Kunal's ghost! l've seen him. Go to your room now! Go away now. Ghost! Ridiculous! lf people come to know that Kunal is alive, ..then it will be the end of us. People will only know if he remains alive. My name is Zokkomon! Magic Uncle, you should have seen his face when he saw me. When they were hung upside down. Stop being childish, will you, there's lots of work to do. - But l am a child. - Not anymore. Now you're Zokkomon. Madam, please let me go. There's a little boy who was living with me. l don't know what he's going through and where he is. l'm begging. Madam, please l need parole. Madam please, listen to me. please madam.... How many times have l warned you - don't touch any of my stuff. You never mentioned that you are the renowned scientist Dr. Vivek Ray! Shut up! Why did you come to this town? And why didn't you try to educate the town folk? - None of your business. - No, Magic Uncle, you will have to tell me. Fine. Don't tell me. Now even l don't want to support you. l left everything behind to come here. Because this is my home town. l built a laboratory, tried to use science to improve people's lives. But Deshraj was threatened. He wanted the town folk to stay superstitious, fearful. lt helped his scams. - Long live. - Swamidev Baba. Deshraj used Swamidev Baba well. They both plotted against me. Why are you not helping me? Nobody can help you. This is the wrath of the Gods. l could have dealt with Deshraj all by myself... ... but so long as the town folk remained superstitious, Deshraj would keep fooling them. lt was impossible to keep the truth or science alive among these people. So l retreated into the haunted house. Where people feared to enter. Where l could keep science alive. And l waited for the right time. Zokkomon has come! Sir, now what should we do? The ghost has come back. - What nonsense you're speaking! - No, Sir. Where is he? There's no one here. There's no one here. What are you staring at? Deshraj... is a thief. Who has done this? Speak out! l have done it. Who are you? Zokkomon! Zokkomon, if you have the guts, show yourself! Go home. Shantaram, send them all home! Children, go home now. Go away... move. You received half a million rupees for a new library. Where is the money Deshraj? Show yourself you scoundrel. Sure! Come downstairs Deshu. Get out. Stand back... get out of the way! Show yourself, you scoundrel! l will swallow you up. Just as you swallow up the money meant... ...for mid-day meals for children! What are you doing here, go to your classes immediately. These kids will have their class right here... ... where Zokkomon will teach them how to fight for their rights. Shut up. Where are you? l am warning you, my fury will burn you. Oh, looks like your fury has set your pants on fire! Fire... Your game is up! Just watch as l reduce you to dust. Prepare for war, my friends. Each child in this town will soon be Zokkomon. Zokkomon! Through the darkestjungles and highest mountains Arose a call The darkness will soon fade And in every alley and every lane The new day will shine bright He roused us up from our sleep Taught us that we can if we believe He planted the ray of hope Hear his name Zokkomon Think defeat and you've lost Believe victory and you've won That's my creed, it gets everything done lnjustice and persecution if it exists We won't bow down to it We may be small but it doesn't matter We have the courage, the will to go on We have the courage, the will to go on lt's now up to us The change is ours to bring He planted the ray of hope Hear his name Sir, do you have any answers? Mr. Deshraj must address the questions that Zokkomon has raised. Or else we might get into trouble because of him. Deshraj needs to clarify all our doubts. - Shut up... be quiet. - We will not keep quiet. Please stay calm. l'm sure you all understand, first l lost my brother and his wife... ... and now my darling Kunal. How can a man who has faced so many tragedies speak. That's enough! Now l know. Let me enlighten you'll. l went into a deep trance and realized... ... this is no ordinary ghost. There's a ghost in the mike. There is someone who wants to prevent Deshraj from doing good work. Thus through black magic and other dark energies... ... he has sent a dark soul in the form of Deshraj's nephew. So that you all are cheated. But do not fear, l have a solution to this too. Very soon, l will perform some rites and destroy this dark soul. - All hail... - Swamidev Baba! - Long live... - Deshraj Kumar! Oh Zokkomon, tell us what to do to placate your angry soul! What should we do so that you rest in peace? Rid yourself of all your fears and superstitions and l will leave. Punish scoundrels like Deshraj for their wrong deeds... ... and you will not need me. Rise and speak, break your silence. This is all Zokkomon has to say! Look, Sir, what the newspaper says. ln a small town called Jhunjhunmakadstrama .. ..something strange has taken place. A ghost named Zokkomon is bringing about a miraculous change. The town folk say... Deshraj and Swamidev Baba fled that day. We trusted them blindly. We were wrong. l was returning from the market, a black cat crossed my path... ... so l stopped. But then my children said let's go, nothing will happen... ... so l carried on. And actually, nothing happened! Zokkomon has cast a spell on all the children. All they talk about is science. Zokkomon is our friend! Since Zokkomon has come, going to school is fun. l will do anything for Zokkomon! lf the children praise him, then l'm sure Zokkomon is truly great. Because of Zokkomon, children now want to go to school. They are no longer afraid of the teachers. Because now the teachers are afraid of Zokkomon. l have lived all my life in Jhunjhun.. ..and have never witnessed a miracle like this. lf they had the guts, why didn't they answer Zokkomon's questions? l would like to bless Zokkomon.. .. from the bottom of my heart. Long live Zokkomon! Diwali is being celebrated in Jhunjhunmakadstrama.. ..with a new fervor. He is a ghost! You went ahead and killed him. And he turned into a ghost. You are a liar. You are a murderer. - We will be ruined. - Shut up and stop this nonsense. Only l will truly celebrate Diwali. Rani, what's wrong? l'd enjoy it if Kunal was alive and here. l've told you a hundred times you can't wander around like this. Magic Uncle, l know Zokkomon can't celebrate Diwali. But Kunal wants to celebrate Diwali. Kunal wants to play. What childish nonsense. The real Diwali is the victory of good over evil... ... and that's what we're doing. This Diwali has no meaning. l want a home. We have a home. A roof over our heads... Food to eat. Books... laboratory... What else does one need! l want Kitu Didi. Your Kitu Didi will not come. She'll come! Without you l feel lost Every moment l think of you l can't seem to sleep What do l do For so long l've been alone Every passing moment so hollow Every heartbeat seems to ask Where have you gone How l miss those days And the starry nights Every moment a beautiful memory Your every word sweet as honey Why is it so l have to be without you l wait for you To bring back the time we shared Hear me if you can Come back to me Happy Diwali, Kitu Didi! - How far is the town from here? - Whom do you want to meet? He's a small boy. His name is Kunal. Do you know him? He is long dead. His ghost has turned this town topsy-turvy. Excuse me, do you know him? Kunal... Get up. Let's practice. l don't want to go anywhere. l want Kitu Didi. Forget about Kitu Didi. Let's go. Start practising. Up... Higher. Kitu Didi! Kitu Didi! Thank you, Magic Uncle. - Got scared! - l'm not afraid of anyone. Good. Then we set my uncle's pants on fire! Then Magic Uncle took me to a great height from which l swooped down. Come on Kunal, we have to plan for tomorrow morning. What's happening tomorrow morning? l'll tell you... Tomorrow Kunal will risk his life again, and fight your battle for you. - My battle? - Yes, your battle. For which you have used Kunal. This is notjust between Deshraj and me. lt's not such a petty battle. This is Zokkomon's battle. The truth cannot be hidden by noble phrases. The truth is that you have put Kunal's life in danger. For the town folk, Kunal is dead. Now you want Zokkomon to die too. - Zokkomon cannot die. - Why? By wearing this costume, he stops being human? Yes. Zokkomon is not the name of any mortal human. Do you know why Kunal became Zokkomon? Zokkomon is the name of an idea. lt's the name of hope! You, me, we are all ordinary mortals who can die. But hope never dies. lt beats eternally in the human heart. That is why Zokkomon cannot die. This town needs hope. lt needs Zokkomon. lf Zokkomon lives in the hearts of people... ... then he will still be alive, once Kunal goes away. Tomorrow morning, Kunal leaves with me. What does he think of himself? - Kitu Didi. - What? - We cannot leave as yet. - What? Magic Uncle did not force me. l chose to become Zokkomon. - What? - Yes. You have no idea. Zokkomon has brought about change. Nobody beats up my friends now in school. Children are actually learning. People are challenging superstition. All this is because of Zokkomon. Living with a crazy man, you have also turned crazy. Biting off more than you can chew! Come on, go and sleep. Sir, l just saw Kunal walking towards the main street. Do not be afraid. l am not a ghost. l am Kunal. Kunal...! l told Kitu Didi we cannot go back as yet but she is not agreeing. But Kunal, without Zokkomon things will go back to the old days. Zokkomon is going nowhere Arju, only Kunal is going away. Meaning? Kitu Didi says that if Zokkomon lives in the hearts of the children... ... then he will remain alive even after Kunal leaves. l may be leaving, but you all are here. Zokkomon! This name has caused me endless grief. Now, l am going to get rid of this Zokkomon with my own hands. You can kill me but you can never kill Zokkomon. Show me your power, Zokkomon! Come on! lf you kill me a thousand Zokkomons will take my place. Go on then... call out for Zokkomon... Uncle... Uncle... Uncle, if you kill me a thousand Zokkomons will take my place. Please don't hurt me... Please forgive me. l killed Kunal. He fell down because of me. l abandoned Kunal in the city... ... and told everyone that he is dead. l siphoned off his money. l killed Kunal. Please don't hurt me. Please forgive me. - Where is Kunal? - l did not kill Kunal. He fell down himself. Please forgive me. l did not kill Kunal. Please don't hurt me. Please forgive me. Don't hurt me. When can we shift Kunal to the hospital? lt's impossible to shift him in this condition... ... anything could happen. l should have never let him be Zokkomon. He so badly wanted a home. And l never really understood the meaning of a home. Kitu Didi, when will Kunal wake up? Nothing will happen to him. He's not Kunal, he's Zokkomon. Zokkomon cannot die. Zokkomon cannot die? Zokkomon! Zokkomon! Were you afraid? Yes! Kunal is fine! Kitu Didi, Magic Uncle, l feel l have returned home... l have found a home. l hope now you are convinced You're as strong as you believe you are! Uncle is in jail... ... where he's opened another kind of school. The town folk still run behind Swamidev Baba... ... but to throw shoes at him. The haunted house is now the most wanted house. No one is afraid of it anymore. The people of Jhunjhunmakadstrama have a new passion: science. Magic Uncle and Kitu Didi still don't see eye to eye. But we are a happy family! But most importantly, it's the children who have changed forever. Every child in the town has become... Zokkomon!
