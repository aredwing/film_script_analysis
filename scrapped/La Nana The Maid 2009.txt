 

                        Dad, she's not my girlfriend, What's up? OK, I'll give you more ice cream, Mundo, please! He spilled it all over himself again, Dammit, Camila, You always drop everything! Mom, Lucas keeps bossing me, I'm not going to clean up after something I didn't do, Mom, I want a Playstation 3, No way! That's too expensive, and, you know, Dad... But what do you want? You want what? I didn't hear, Pilar, what did he ask for? I don't know, play... something, Martin, don't drink all the juice, Camila, you light the candles. Stop whispering! Hey, you're also whispering. Why can't we move this along? Here, keep it on your lap. Here Gabriel, keep it. Why don't we go over there? OK, her favorite has to get her. Go Lucas! Go on. Hey, Raque Raque. What's up? Are you playing deaf? No. You playing deaf? Raquel, let's go to the dining room. I'm not going, Lucas! Why are you so embarrassed, Raquel? It's just us. I'm not embarrassed, of what? Yeah right. Careful Camila, the candles are going to drip. She doesn't want to come, she's way too embarrassed. Well then let's go over there, what a drag! Oh Camila, it's her birthday. Come on Raquel, don't be silly! Come on out, Raquel! Raquel! Raquel! Raquel! Come on, come on! Happy Birthday to you... Happy Birthday, dear Raquel, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday, Raquel. Thank you. Happy Birthday, Raquel. Here. Open it, don't be boring. Raquel, if the sweater doesn't fit, you can change it, okay? But you ruined the surprise, that sucks! I'll open it later. You're getting old, Raquel! How old are you now, 25? You shouldn't ask a woman that. Yes, don't be cheeky. Sit down, please. OK, I'll leave these here. Who doesn't want cake? I want cake. Me too. Everybody. You, sit down. How long have you been here, Raquel? Over 20 years? One year before Camila was born. Oh, let's not calculate. Well Raquel, we're very happy that you're still with us. I'm happy too, I don't know what I'd do without these kids. They're a lot of work, though. You'll have to excuse me, I have work to do. No Raquel. I forbid you to do the dishes now. If I don't do them now, I'll still have to do them later. Fine, let's clear the table. All right, kids. Up. Don't hurt yourself from the effort. Excuse me, my phone is ringing. I'll be right back. Yes, go! Lucas! Don't wind them up, please. Hi Mom. Thank you. Forty-one. I have to go now, we're celebrating with the family here. Okay. Say hi to everyone. Bye. Kids, don't make a mess, I've got everything set for breakfast. Kids! The party's over. Off to bed. I'll put them to sleep, Mom. Yeah, sure you will. Shall I help you, Raquel? You're still having those awful headaches, huh? It's nothing. I'm getting old, that's all. If you're getting old, what's left for me? Oh Raquel, you've got so much work. I've been thinking that we could hire someone to help you out. No, no. Raquel, accept that this house is too big for you. Oh, dear. You can't stand anyone, can you? You kicked Rita out. She was a thief. Lucas called her "the poacher." Raquel. We're going to study all night long... so please don't vacuum near my room too early. Okay. Hello. It's Raquel's birthday. Happy Birthday, Raquel. What do you want? Hey Camila, I've got everything tidied up here. Get out. But Raquel, she's starving. Sure, since I do the cleaning. She should eat at home. Forget it, let's go. No! Don't worry. Damn it Raquel. Do whatever you want. And thanks for swearing at me on my birthday. Martin, get out! Kids, to bed! Lucas, please. Come on! Enough. Let's pray. Lucas, are you going to pray with us? Lucas! Okay, you're tucked in. In the name of the Father, the Son... We're going to pray for all who are suffering and in need. Gabriel, what are you going to pray for? For the whole universe, except for Martin and the devil. Hey! Excuse me girls, good night. Mom, how could you run off like that in the kitchen? You're crazy, really! Oh, please! Mom, Raquel hates me. She's always hated me. I'm sick of it. Camila, how could she hate you if she raised you? She's very tired, that's all. Oh Mom, you're so blind. Okay... Good night. Sleep well. Bye. Don't do that to her! But it's good for her. I don't mind, Camila! Lucas, get up! Gabriel. Alright. Come on, Luquitas, it's late! Hello Raquel. How did you sleep? Not much. Oh dear. Mundo, honey, wake up. Mundo, wake up. Thank you. Yes ma'am? It should be in the closet... Okay, I'll go. Hurry, you're going to be late. - Bye Raque, thanks! - Bye Lucas. No, I want that one, Pilar. The ones at the club are all dirty. You could start playing a little less golf. Hey, Pilar, I'm playing once... Oh shit, close the door! Dammit Pilar! Sorry Raquel, he's neurotic. Raquel, please help me find Mundo's golf shirt! Oh thank you. Here it is, you didn't even look. Okay, thanks. Bye honey, I'm off to the university. Pilar, don't forget about Camila! Right. Raquel! Please vacuum here first, the girls need to rest. Thanks, bye. What's up? Raquel! We're leaving. Could you give us some snacks, please? No, it's too late, we're out of snacks. Forget it, let's get some at my Mom's pastry shop. No, we haven't run out of snacks. I know where you hide them! What are you talking about? Don't bother me! Hey! Hey! No one goes into my room! Get out of here! Here are the snacks, you psycho! - I'm telling your mother! - Let go of me! I've got things to tell her too... You're just the maid here! Let's go. Bye. Hello. Raquel, I've been calling for a while, what's going on? Nothing, I'm just a little dizzy. What is it? Raquel, Mundo called me because Camila was very sad, You two were arguing again, I asked you to not wake them up, I'm too busy. I can't remember everything. I've got too much work. Yes, you're right, that's why I'm calling, I'm going to hire a girl to help you, OK? - A girl? - Yes, I... I don't know what lies Camila told Mr. Mundo but I didn't... Look, it'll be better for everyone, I have to hang up now, there's a student here, Mom, do you remember that classmate I told you about? Yes, I do. You remember? He's in jail in Russia. Don't play with the napkin! He's in jail in Russia for punching a cop outside a party. I can't believe you! Use the fork, Gabriel! But wait, one thing... Eleven years in prison! And his friends were released. That's bad news... Thank you. I'm sure he didn't punch the cop. It's so unfair, he should be in school. Hey Raquel, want to see a magic trick later? - You've learned a lot of tricks. - Yes. Raising your grades, now that would be a good trick. Magic is my thing, look: I'll turn you into a pig! See? Don't believe me? Look! The napkin... Lucas, we're eating, stop it, please... Close the door! Mrs. Pilar... About what you said this afternoon, I... Raquel, I'm thinking about it. Camila has to understand that I'm... Raquel please! Forget about that for now. Tomorrow is your day off, go out, rest, go for a walk. We'll talk later. Hi, can I help you? Do you have sweaters? Yes, those are last season's, and these are the new ones... a little more expensive. Looks good on you. - Hi. - How much is this? It costs 5,000. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm taking it. Cash? Lucas, stop! Stop! Raquel, tell him! It's just a mask. Lucas, leave them alone. - Cut it out! - Okay, enough! - Have they eaten yet? - I have no idea. Who's your mother with? With Mercedes, a new maid, she's Peruvian. Raquel! I guess she didn't hear. Raquel, I want you to meet someone. Lucas told me already. Raquel... It's nothing bad... She's just going to help you. You can do whatever you want, you're the boss. Pick up the pillow. Gabriel, the pillow... Mercedes, please come upstairs. This is Raquel, this is Mercedes. She's from Peru, close to Lima. Hello. Hello, how are you? Fine. Could someone please answer the doorbell! I'll go Mom, don't worry. Come on Raquel, be nice! I was thinking that Mercedes could handle the kitchen and the first floor... and you could take care of the kids and the second floor. The kids only listen to me anyway. Sure. And you can show her around the kitchen. Open it. A kitten! Mom! Kids, come here! Dad, come! How cute! What is it? No running! Don't think that this house is like this every day. A kitten, how cute. It's so pretty. Look at it, it's beautiful. Camila, I'm sorry... but you could ask before bringing an animal home. Well, I... - Oh Dad! It doesn't matter. - No! It does matter! It's not a game, you have to feed it, take care of it, be responsible! I don't have time to look after animals. Raque, we'll all take care of it. Right Dad? Look! Okay, but I warned you, all right? I can take care of it, in Peru we had like six cats. Get over here! The large glasses are here. Don't open that. Here are the cleaning products. There are the plates. The condiments are here. So what are you going to cook? Peruvian food? Yes, a little of everything, right? The vacuum cleaner and waxing machine are here. What are you doing? Don't give it milk there! Get it straight, I don't want that cat indoors. Hello, hello, hello, you little cutie! Thanks Mercedes, for taking care of the cat, you're the best. It's my pleasure, Miss. Call me Camila, we're the same age. Okay, Camila. I'll make sure he doesn't run away. What's his name? - Would you like to name him? - Me? Yes. Are you going to cook or what? Lucas, stop it. Can't you see they're scared? What's going on? I told you what your chores were, leave the kids to me! But they were so scared. Raquel, it's fine, Mercedes is right, we got a little wild... She's got to understand, we're not in Peru! Dammit Raquel, you're being a bitch! Bitch? Let's go. Mercedes? Want to see a trick? Here, pick one... - Raquel, are you okay? - Come on. Good morning. Lucas, excuse me. Mom, don't look! Sorry! Were you practicing? Yes. I wanted to talk to you. I know that Dad should be the one to tell you this... Raquel's tired of washing your sheets and pajamas every day. What! She said that? Lucas, it's normal for your age! Mom, get out! I don't want to talk about it. We have to talk about these things! Mom, get out! Come on! Out. Lucas! Raquel is just doing her job. Thanks. Mercedes! Mercedes, the grocer! Open up! What did I tell you? - Good day, sir. - Hey, are you new? Yes, sort of. Raquel! Mr. Mundo, good morning. Hello Mercedes. Come on in. Raquel? Raquel? Raquel, turn that off please. How could you leave this girl outside for so long? I didn't hear anything. Be very careful with this model, okay? Don't vacuum in here please. - Should I sweep? - No, don't even clean, forget it. I want to ask you for a favor. Don't say that I went to play golf at this time, okay? Sure, don't worry Mr. Mundo. Thank you. See you later. Lima... Lima... Raquel, open the door! Pilar, look. I finished it. That's incredible! It's beautiful, honey. Almost a year. What if I put it here? Look. Yes. Lima! Yuck! Maybe it's in the pool! Go see. Mercedes, have you seen Lima? Oh Camila! I have to tell you something about the kitten. What happened? It got lost this morning. How? Dammit, Camila. May God forgive me... but I'm sure it was Raquel who let it out. - She's talking nonsense. - All right. Raquel may be crazy but I don't think... Think what? You should see what she does. She locks me out, she treats me like a dog and she disinfects the bathroom every time I take a shower. Mercedes, I'll speak to my mom tomorrow, okay? I already spoke to her. I told her everything already. - You mean she already knows? - Yes. Divine, what a beautiful dress, that French thing to take care of women, especially their neck that low neckline... Mom, Mercedes is leaving. What? How come? This girl's been here, less than a month! She can't leave like this. Mom! Leave this to me, alright? Why should I care. You fix your own problem. Grandma, there's nothing to fix. Mercedes can't take this humiliation any longer. What are you talking about, dear? Everyone in this house is well-treated. Grandma, I know what I'm talking about and so does my mother! Raquel treats her awful! Oh please, maid fights, I've seen millions! Mercedes, I don't know what to say. Mom, you could apologize to her. Thanks for everything, excuse me. Mercedes, wait for me outside, okay? Grandma, do you think that I make these things up? Let's quit this boring subject! Grandma, I hate it when my mom plays dumb! Enough! Camila's right. Raquel's got you eating out of the palm of her hand. Admit it. Mom, she adores this house. That's why she gets like that. She's very apprehensive. She's grown tiresome, obnoxious, fussy... What do you want me to do? Fire her? Why not? Because I can't, Camila. You don't need to, dear, we'll bring in Sonia. Sonia, go get the dirty laundry. No one told me to do that. Well, you have to. Hey, what did we say? Mrs. Pilar, not you, okay? Okay, I'll do it this time, but remember... Yes, it's clear. Sorry, Sonia. It was supposed to be a flip! Not a flop! What was that, man? - Lucas, look what I brought for you! - Good. Hey, great! Thanks Raque Raque. You haven't called me Raque Raque in a long time. Right! You're the one and only Raque Raque! Hey! Don't wet me with that towel! Stop being silly! Hey! Why do you make such an effort for these ingrates? Just do your job and you'll be happier. I am happy. With someone else's kids? Before you know it, they've grown up, they're gone and they don't even remember your face. Those damn ingrates. I love them and they love me. I'm part of the family. Hey, I don't have any infections, okay? I'm sick of your weird shit. Aren't you going to get the door? Or no one told you to do that either? Hello! Yes, I'm coming! Good morning. Where's Miss Mercedes? Miss Mercedes no longer exists. Raquel, the door is shut! Open up! I'm locked out! I've got something in the oven! Raquel, open up! I saw you, you bitch! Open up! Open up! Kids! Kids! Oh fuck! Sonia? Motherfucker! What happened? Nothing! Nothing happened! I am not your toy, do you hear me? I deserve respect, you hear? You idiot! You knocked the boat over!! Come here! Come out of there! I'm telling Mrs. Pilar! Stay out of this! Tell whomever you want! See if I care, bitch! You stay of this! Raque... Raque, she's gone. No Mom, this has nothing to do with it, you sent me a cave woman. No! She's crazy, Mom! It's not my fault. I'm not going to fire her! Dammit Raquel! Raquel! Raquel! Don't think that you're going to get away with this! Lucas! Kids! Am I alone in this house? We're trying to fix the boat! Where's the glue? Kids, just leave it, it's no use. But Mom, Dad will be devastated! Damn Raquel! Careful with this, Lucas. Okay! Put it away. It's Dad. Close it, close it! Hello. How are you? Good, how's it going? Hello. Hi Dad. What happened? What the hell happened? Shit... What happened here? I spent a year on this! Isn't anyone going to tell me what the fuck happened? Sonia knocked it over. Yes, she... but she left. - What do you mean? - She quit. Isn't that a little exaggerated? That's what I said, but she left. Well, it's all right... She had the worst breath! Yeah! What a foul-smelling witch! Lucas! Okay, help Dad clean up. What is it? What is it? Raquel! Raquel what's wrong? Shit! Watch out, watch out! Camila! Camila! Raquel! Careful! Careful! Careful! Help me out! Lift her legs up! Camila, open the door please! Careful! Don't let go of her! Come on, open the door! Watch her head! Her head Mundo, please. Lucas, help me, dammit! - I'm going to drop her! - Watch out! Mundo, calm down! Camila, stay with the kids... We're going to the hospital! Open the door! Why doesn't this piece of shit open!! I can't move my legs, I can't move my legs! Hello? Okay. Mom, Lucy's here! - Lucy, I'm Camila, - Hi, how are you? Good, come in! Do you need any help? Don't worry, this way I get a little exercise. Come in. Excuse me. It's so hot! Are you tired? - Yes, a little. - Do you want anything? Okay, a glass of water, thanks. - What a nice house. - Yes. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello Lucy. - How are you? This is your room, Lucy, what do you think? I don't know, normal? Small, Yes, it's little small, I got you this uniform, hope it fits, - Should I put it on right away? - I don't know, as you wish, Look, that's Raquel's room, She's still in bed, poor thing, - And how is she feeling? - She's doing better, I'll introduce you to her, She must be sleeping, let's let her rest, - Shall we show you the garden? - Yes, let's go, - Should I wear my uniform now? - Your uniform? Yes, sorry, I don't know how this works, Don't worry, we'll help you, Hey, you've got a pool! Not for very long, Here's where we hang our clothes, - What a beautiful garden! - Well, thank you, but it's really thanks to the gardener, He's a perfectionist. - So you don't have to worry about it. - That's good. Look at those idiots watching TV all day. Kids! Come say hello to Lucy! How sweet. - Have you tried on your uniform yet? - Yes, I'll wear it tomorrow. - So you don't get your clothes dirty. - Okay. And have you met Raquel? Have you seen her? No, because... I knocked on her door, but she didn't answer. - So I decided not to bother her. - No, she must have been sleeping. She's catching up on - I wanted to ask you something. - Yes, tell me. Could I go out for a jog at nights? Yes, of course, but will you have any juice left? Juice? No, I mean will you have the energy, because this house is big. Oh yes, yes don't worry. - Well, good night. - Good night. Hello. Good morning. How are you? I'm Lucy. Shouldn't you be in bed? Okay, I'd better do my chores. You're not going to have breakfast? Oh? Yes, good idea. Wait! Raquel... Raquel! Wait, Raquel! Don't leave me talking to myself! Raquel! Raquel, you're so stubborn! - Hello Lucy. - Hello. What happened? There's a fuss going on. I don't know, I got up, and Raquel was having breakfast here, but she looked awful. Lucy, I'm sorry. She gets more difficult than she really is. Did you two have breakfast together? No, we didn't. When I sat down, she got up and went upstairs, but she looked awful. She gets a little difficult with the new ones, but don't be scared. No, I'm not scared, don't worry. People don't scare me. Where were you this early? Where were you? Fishing, actually... Jogging a little. Since they went out for dinner... she gave me permission to go out earlier. You haven't mopped here. But it's clean. This is for mopping, and you mop every night. If it looks clean, it doesn't mean that it is clean. Well, I'll mop later, I'm going to shower, look at me. Raquel, look... Don't worry, I'm not staying in this house for the rest of my life. I'd die. I'm glad. Excuse me. Arrogant, proud, and capricious... She won't let anyone comfort her... Crying and she left... They say she spends her nights crying for him! ...her nights crying for him! she won't let them comfort her... And Mundo? - Lucas wanted to park the car. - I'm going to put the kids to bed. - Good night. - Good night, Cami. What is it? Raquel? - Raquel, what are you doing? - Leave, I'm disinfecting here. Hey, but the smell! You can't be here... - Come go to your room. - Leave me alone! Let go! Skank! What's wrong with you? God! Come here. Why are you like this? What did they do to you? What happened to you? My God, what did they do to you? Come, come. Go to bed, Okay? Take that off! Okay, come, come. Let's go to your room, okay? It's going to be fine, you're going to be better. It'll soon pass. Lie down here. Rest, all right? Thank you. Such a lot of used clothes! See anything you liked? No, I don't need any... these people need it much more than I do. Thanks anyway, ma'am. Hey, the kids took all the cool clothes, as they call them. Raquel, what are you doing up? I feel better. If I stayed in there, I was going to rot. I think so too, ma'am, she should do some things to revive a little. You look much better, the prayers must have done you well. The kids prayed for you every night, Raquel. That must be it. Okay, let's go Lucy. We're going to be late. No, no, leave that, this one is lighter. Excuse me. Don't strain yourself, Raquel. Give it to me, here. Leave it! Give it up, you better have some tea. Okay, open the door. I'm having lunch at my mother's. Bye Raquel! Hey, you look like an ox! - Because of my big head? - Because of your load! Silly! Raquel! Raquel! The door's shut! Raquel! Raquel! Raquel! Open up, please! No! Why are you like that? Why don't you cut it out and come sunbathe with me? Have a good time! Come, relax! I'll make a spot for you! Come here! Hey! What are you laughing at? Imagine if Don Mundo had arrived and seen you naked. How could you? Who raised you? And you? Who raised you? Where's your family? I don't like talking about that. Why not? I don't know. I don't have much to say. Do you like talking about your family that much? Yes, always, I miss them very much. The kids adore me. You like that grey-haired one. Hey! Don't shout so loud! Raquel, shouldn't we lose the formalities? That's the one I like. That one's identical to my Uncle Eric. What uncle? Does he live there with you? Yes, we all live together, we're very close. Oh! This pisses me off, these commercials! You made me think of my people, Raquel. It's so much fun there. All right! Isn't it too much? Is it paradise there? If it wasn't for the hard labor, it would be paradise. See to believe! Let's go see then! I'll invite you whenever you want. Nah! What am I going to do there? And why not? We could go spend Christmas together. Or do you have plans already? Okay, ask then. You're crazy, that doesn't work. You think that's going to improve your shape? What are you two laughing at? This one's laughing at my exercises. Raquel was doing this, to lift her... Right, don't bother me! Camila, she went like this. Right, want a punch? Oh! You're crazy! Fight? Fight? Who's going? Raquel? You? Oh! Did you hear what he said? He called me "four eyes"! Hey... What is it, Raquel? It's that I do want to spend Christmas at your house... for a change. Okay... well, let's go. Right. Good night, Raquel, sleep well. Okay. But look, this Nativity scene is sad! It needs more colors. Don't you have more animals? This dinosaur is divine! - What do you think? - Much better. Put in those colored balls. Of course. Mom, this Jesus doesn't have a head. - Oh! Well, look for the head. - But Baby Jesus can't be beheaded! You're going to hell! - Oh! But Mom! Don't say those things! - It's a joke! Hello Mrs. Carmen. Oh Raquel! How are you? How are you feeling? Better, eh? Yes, much better, thank you. How nice, kids. Mrs. Pilar... - Could I have a word with you? - Yes. Yes? Lucy invited me to spend Christmas with her family... and I feel bad about saying no. Oh! But if she invited you, go! You're going to make her happy! I knew you'd understand, because... it makes me sad not to spend Christmas here. Oh! But we have so many Christmases ahead of us... But do you want to? If you want to, go! - Yes? - Yes. Okay! Then go tell Lucy! Go! Thank you. Excuse me. Bye, Mrs. Pilar, thank you very much. See you when we get back. Have a nice Christmas. - Bye Raquel! - Bye. - Bye Raquel. - Bye dear. Have a good time. - There's the taxi! Let's go! - Lucas, help her with the bag! Wake up! We'll exchange gifts later! Bye. - Want to listen? - Okay. Hey, I've never seen you this early! Oh, shut up! Well, this is my Uncle Eric, Raquel. Raquel, Eric, Eric, Raquel. My pleasure. Lucy has told me a lot about you. - All bad things I guess. - Oh! You're so silly! Let's go. That Nativity scene is a disaster. Camila! Honey, could you get some ice? Be quiet! Shut up!! Presenting the great magician, Lucas! What is it? Okay honey! Right! Let's toast to Raquel who's here with us! I'm going to take a picture! Grandma! Grandma! Look at the camera! Could you take one with mine please? Oh no. I want to be in your picture too. You take it! The other one was just a rehearsal! So now look really happy! Do you know how Raquel stays young? She does some exercises to lift her butt. Good thing she's your friend! Hey, this friend from Santiago is so popular! It's my mom. - Where is her family? - Mommy, mind your own business. They're in the north, we're six siblings. Every one of them has a family, except me. Excuse me. Hello Mommy... Hi, how are you? Yes. I'm at a friend's house. No, you're not interrupting! How are you? And how are Cesar and Verito? And how's your health? I'm sorry, Mommy! Hello? Mommy! Forgive me please, okay? Hello? Hello? Mommy, can you hear me? Hello? I'm tired, I haven't stayed up late in a long time. I'm full of work. It's good to have work. Oh yes, that's true. I'm so full... I feel like a pig. How can you say that? There's a pig close by and it's like this! Nothing like you at all. Don't think I'm stupid. I know what you're doing. And you don't like what I'm doing? I don't mind. Cheers... To you. What is it? Are you embarrassed? If you want to look, just look. You know what, I never, umm... Don't worry, stay still... Relax... You know what, I'm sorry, but I can't... Maybe later. Raquel! We're going to have breakfast! Aren't you coming? Let's go. I want to leave. Could you take me to the bus station? No Raquel, don't talk to me like that... Not anymore. Did something happen? What? Did you sleep with my Uncle Eric? Right? You liked it! Did you sleep with him or not? Yes. And? Good... really good. You know, my head hurts, I'm hung over. My head hurts less every day... - Strange, huh? - Let's sit there? I wish I could spend my birthday here. Right, careful. I sent her to buy some bread! All right, let's go! The present! Camila get the cake, now! Go get your mother, close the door. Now! Tell her it's ready. Hello? Okay... Surprise! Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... Can I make three wishes? You're full of confetti! Hey, thank you very much. Raquel organized everything! She didn't let us help! - Oh! Friend! - Open it, I hope you like it. Raquel, how fancy! It's too much. Mom! What are you doing?! Okay, put it on because I'm going to take a picture. But it's going to get dirty. Just on top, hide the tag. Get closer. How lovely. Oh Lucy! Don't get like that, you're going to make me cry. I know it's not the best time to tell you this but... - I'm going to miss you so much. - You're leaving? No! I realized over Christmas that I miss my people... and I want to go back. Besides, Raquel has really recovered, look at her! But who's going to... Your family must be really happy, right? Yes. That's good. Oh dear, what a surprise. Lucy, we're going to miss you. Come on friend, I'm going to come and visit... and you know you're welcome in my house. No, I know. I'm going to cut a piece of cake. Would you like some? Yes, thanks. - Bring some plates too, Raque. - Can I help you? Kids, you're eating with spoons. Spoons! Forks! I want a big piece! Big! I am a robot... - Shut up! Don't sing that! - Shut up runt! Learn something useful! Raque! Wow! Raque in tight clothes! You look really cool, where are you going? Fishing... No. I'm going to jog a little. To jog! Since when do you jog? Well, good luck. Bye.
