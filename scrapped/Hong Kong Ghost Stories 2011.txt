 

                        Excuse me, where is the school office? You, hi... Excuse me, I'm a substitute teacher. Could you tell me where the school office is?. It's lunch time now, I'll take you to the school office. I'm the new substitute teacher, Miss Yip. My name is Don Don. Don Don Aren't you going out for lunch?. I'm dieting. You're not fat at all. This is the school office. Great, thank you. Bye-bye. Bye. Excuse me, I'm looking for Miss Kong. There are two answers for this question. A, she's not here. B, I am Miss Kong. Pick one. Miss Kong, you have a great sense of humor. Not really... nothing much happens around here and it'd be tough to get by without a sense of humor. You've been here long?. A few decades already and I'll need to stay for a few more decades or so before retiring. You're late. I'm sorry. But heavy rains and a traffic jam. Is this Jennifer Yip?. Principal Ko?. Is 'Principal' engraved on her forehead?. I read your resume. You haven't taught for over three years. It doesn't matter. I've read up on the changes in the syllabus. I'll be able to catch up and follow along. That's great, we have a teacher on maternity leave. That's why I would like you to take over her history class. Sure, I can do that. Then, please start tomorrow. You will teach the afternoon class. Miss Kong will give you your schedule. OK. Jennifer!. Chung, you scared me... what are you doing here?. Why did you change your phone number?. I've been waiting here for you all day. Please let me go. No... Why won't you give me a chance?. A chance?. I've given you over ten chances in the past three years. I was admitted into the hospital, four times. Four times, you don't remember?. I do remember. Just give me one more chance, I don't want to be like this. No... don't be that way... Let me go!. I won't be that way again. Get up, there are people... What are you looking at?. Let's go!. It hurts... Let's go!. Don't... Please don't be that way, just give me one more chance. Let go of me!. What's happening?. Uncle, I'm just asking her to go with me. Jennifer, go home first. Jennifer... Go. Go, or I will call the police and tell them you had assaulted and caused bodily harm. No... Go!. Still not gone?. Outrageous!. You haven't worked for 3 years, because of him. Being a bum is no big deal until he gets drunk and starts to beat you. Mom couldn't bear it. At first, I thought it was his job that made him sad along with the stress and pressures, that's why he started drinking. I really didn't think he would beat me. Man abusing woman, it could become a habit. If it can happen once, there will be a second and a third time. He will beat you all day, don't you know?. Don't worry about it, and make a new start. Focus on your teaching now, then look for a good man. Mom, I don't want to think about that now... okay?. Well, it's your decision. Your Highness, if you want me to sleep in the living room at least give me a blanket. No problem, Mr. Yip. You'll get it when you go to sleep. Jennifer... if you run into that bastard again, don't be soft-hearted. Okay, okay. Miss Yip, this is Miss Kong. Being this is your first day, I didn't schedule too many classes for you to help you adapt. The two lessons in the afternoon are with F.4E. and I've outlined the course for you. The kids in that class are a bit naughty, so be careful. You can find me at the school office, if needed. Miss. Don Don?. I can't find the F.4E classroom. Do you know where it is?. I am in F. 4E, I'll take you there. Good, thank you. It's up ahead and around the corner. Are you ok?. He's just teasing me. You got the time to threaten me, why don't you worry about him first. What are you talking about?. If you provoke him again, I will take care of you. Beat me if you dare. Go back to your seats!. I am the new History teacher. My name is Yip. You may call me Miss Yip. I know that History can be a bit boring, but... if you learn more about history, then we can realize more about our current society, right?. Miss, just read from your teaching manual... for those who'd like to listen; and for those who don't... they will do their own thing. You don't think all of us are trying for an A, do you?. How about this. We won't teach today. How about, if we... get to know each other better?. Miss, are you bored?. You're so pretty, a lot of boys won't mind chatting with you. Yes, I'm just here to teach, and it is only a job. I can just teach on my own, and you guys can keep fooling around. Isn't there any other option?. What do you mean?. You want to fool around with us?. We may not accept it. You granted favors to whoever asks for it. Go to hell!. Examinations must be taken. Being a teacher, I can't bare to see you fail. I can help you. I know!. We'll ante up enough money, then you can give pass to all of us. Alright. Be quiet. Be quiet. I don't want any money, why don't I bring in some... movies; some period pieces, so we can watch and learn at the same time. That way, everyone can learn something. We only want blue-ray discs. Miss Yip, lesson over yet?. Yes. I didn't think you were that powerful. There was a female teacher, who after teaching this naughty class... was in tears and said she wanted to leave. Maybe... I am not that much older than them and understand what they are thinking. Keep up the good work. Bye-bye. Bye. The year 2012... the end of the world... The end of the world... come, trust in God... The year 2012... the end of the world... Trust in God now!. You will be saved!. I trust already... You will be saved!. It is the end of the world... come and trust in God... Trust in God... You will be saved!. How come they haven't arrived?. It's getting late... Are they coming?. Hey bosses, what's your hurry?. Those girls need to get dressed... after school; before meeting you... I'm not in the mood anymore!. Here they come... Iook!. Here they are. Which is the one?. Sister Amy... What took you so long?. This is Mr. Chan and Mr. Wong. Hello... They're the same All the guys here are either Peter or John. See, my girls are the best. Let me tell you, this one... is her first time, so young and fresh. You better be quick, or your chance will be gone. I still want this one. I want two thousand to do it. Two thousand?. Sure... Iet's go. I'll pay you. Go... Don Don!. What's happening?. Don Don!. What are you doing here?. Part-time call girl?. Which eye did you see it with?. I'd pay three thousand for that one. Miss, who are you?. I am their teacher. Mr. Chan, Mr. Wong... Don't go!. Shit!. You've screwed it all up. What are you doing, bitch!. I can tolerate your misbehaviors during the class. But if you're pimping your classmates... I can't turn a blind eye. Shall I be a private tutor instead?. No one would hire me even if I wanted to. What made you do this?. There really is a generation gap between you and me. Is it really got to have something in trouble... Iike if my father vomited blood and my mother got breast cancer... Can I do it then?. You are so square. Look, does it fall from the sky?. Don't you feel bad?. I don't feel bad. Sometimes I may have an orgasm or two. I may charge less if the guy was handsome. For those two 'uncles' just now; I'd ask for more. I'm warning you, don't be blabbing it around to anyone. Otherwise, you'd better watch out. Class dismissed!. Carol Where is Don Don?. She didn't go to school today?. Did you force her to turn tricks?. I don't know what you're talking about. You guys tell her. Miss... What's happening?. What do you want?. Nothing... just that our paths crossed and collided. The baldy who teaches Physics said that. Miss, what you saw about Carol last night in Mongkok... you'd better forget about it. Otherwise, you'd better watch out. What's up?. You threatening me?. Do I dare?. Must be famished, speaking gibberish. Let's go for a stick of fishballs!. Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don, this is Miss Yip. Don Don, are you there?. Don Don Excuse me!. Anyone out there?. Please open the door!. Please open the door!. Anyone out there?. Please open the door!. Please open the door!. Our colleague traced the number here. The phone is still inside the school. Don't worry. We'll go inside to search around. Thank you, Henry. Uncle Bring us in to have a look. The teachers are all gone, nobody's here. Doesn't matter, take me in. Alright, then. I told you the teachers are all gone, but you didn't believe me. Okay, take me around some more. Alright. Jennifer!. Jennifer... What happened?. Are you okay?. I want to go home... Go home first. Come. Come, let's go home. How is Jennifer?. She had nightmares the whole night. Saying it is dark, so dark... I think she's suffering from an emotional crisis. Do you think the school may have something to do with it... Tell her not to go back to school. No, wait till she wakes up, then we'll talk to her. Go get changed, let's get some breakfast. Hello... Jennifer?. Did you lock yourself inside the school toilet yesterday?. I had a bit of a headache... I... So... take a rest today, I'll call in sick for you. When you return tomorrow, I'd like to talk with you. Okay, thank you. Bye. I am a good person, I even bought a lunch box for you. Let's sit here and eat. This is for you. Thank you. You're welcome. Miss Kong... Yes?. Could you keep an eye on F.4E?. The kids in that class, really need attention. F.4E? I scheduled for you to teach F.5A these past few days. I think you've made a mistake, I've been teaching F.4E these few days. You were teaching F.4E those few days?. What's wrong?. Ah... you... You... Let me organize my thoughts... and see how I should explain it to you... How come you're turning pale?. You... Calm down first... I'd like to tell you... that we don't have F.4E in our school. No F.4E?. Yes. So what class have I been teaching these past few days?. I'd like to know too. Let me show you. Here it is. How come it's like this?. It was here!. So which class have I been teaching these few days?. You... Are you religious?. Why do you ask?. What happened?. I also want to tell you... but, we had a staff meeting... and agreed not to mention this incident again. I have the right to know!. I really can't tell... Just tell her. We used to have a class F. 4E. That year, there was a student in F.4E who was always being bullied. One day, he brought a canister of natural gas to school. He sprayed the gas onto those students who had bullied him, and lit the fire. Our staff raced to help put out the fire and to save the kids. But the fire burned more and more intense, and the whole classroom was burnt up. Including teachers and students, a total of fourteen was killed. Therefore the school had cancelled the F.4E class to ease everyone from the trauma. How come I haven't heard about this?. Maybe because you were studying in the UK these few years, therefore you don't know about it. I don't know what you had experienced. But if you don't want to continue teaching here, I won't force you. Principal, we are really short on manpower. Then tell the students to do Self-studies. I... I will teach the morning class then. For just this week. Well... the morning class it is. Class F.2A. More easy, okay?. Miss, you alight here everyday, are you going to alight here today?. Yes, I'm sorry, thank you!. I told you not to contact me again. I'll say it one last time. It's been seven years. I can't accept an end like this. Can you just give me one more chance?. I'd like you to give me one more chance now. I really can't live without you... I've been heard this line too many times already. And I've seen you act this way many times too. If it continues, you will beat me to death. Don Don?. Miss... Don Don, how come you are here?. I'm specifically came to find you. We don't have a F.4E at school, which class are you actually in?. Just don't ask again, no matter what. Be sure not to go back to school again. Don Don... Don Don!. God lead us the way, we can pass the dark valley and we don't afraid to be hurt. In the name of the father, the son and the holy ghost... Amen. Jennifer, come here. Right, let me do the introductions... this is Minister Lam Hello, Minister. Hello. I am Mrs. Fong, I live across from your home. Your mother said that you had experienced some strange incidents recently. That's why, we invited Minister Lam and other parishioners here to pray for you. You mother said you are also a Christian. Yes. But after returning to Hong Kong, I seldom join any gatherings. Let's have a seat. Actually, we also believe in demon spirits. Jesus Christ had cast out the demons. Actually I'm not really sure of what I saw. I had seen some pretty strange cases. In the church, we've also seen these kinds of cases. But what I am quite sure is that demons do actually exist in your mind. They cannot touch you or strangle you to death. They can only make you create illusions. Keep your faith strong, also be with God. then no demons can cause any harm to you. Remember, prayer is a powerful weapon. Bible verses are also a strong weapon. Jennifer, let us pray together. Give yourself to God. Everyone bow your heads and pray. Our Father who art in heaven... Hallowed by thy name... Thy kingdom come... Thy will be one on earth as it is in heaven... Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us for our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us... Bring us from the valley of death and deliver us from evil. May God be with me... Hurry up... Excuse me, Miss. All are illusions. All are lies. Everything is fake. Have to faith in. Miss, we miss you so much. Did someone ask you not to come back to school?. Why are you standing there stunned?. Are you here to teach?. Let's start the lesson, Miss!. All are illusions. All are illusions. My God!. It's already five-something?. Don Don?. Miss... Don Don, how come the class F.4E is so strange?. Are you human or... I already told you not to come back to school last night. I'm not afraid. God is with me. Won't be able to help you. The Chinese are under the control of another group of Gods. After the Lord, there are no other Gods. He is the only Eternity. Miss, you have to believe me. They want you to die. Don't go back to school again. They want me to die?. What about you?. Are you like them?. I don't want to see them harming you. Don't come back to school again, please. Don Don... Why are you here again?. We'll talk after you've watched this clip. Actually, when I wait for you here everyday I already want to shoot you. When you got off the bus just now, I started to shoot. But I saw you are talking to the air... Are you okay?. I am really worried about you. I think the school I substitute at, is really troubled. Let's put our differences aside first, I feel you really need to see a friend of mine. My friend is well experienced in these strange matters. I am a Christian. If it does work, you wouldn't have been acting like that just now, right?. Just go and get some advice. There's no harm in that. That school, did have a murder case. A lot of people were killed. It happened about 20 years ago. This girl, her spirits were down and was having bad luck which easily led her to those restless souls. What can we do to help her?. Good always prevails over evil. Trust me, I will help you. Please guide our way, Master. This is an Exorcist club, it is very powerful. Only when you're desperate, should you ever use it. Thank you, Master. Take it, just in case. Mom Dad Mom Jennifer, grandma is sick. We go see her. Call Reverend Lam if there's anything. Dad. Hello... Miss, you can't escape. How do you get my home's phone number?. I know a lot about you, too You dare to hang up?. I'm not teaching anymore... don't call me again!. Mrs. Fong?. What's up?. Your mother couldn't reach you, so she called me. Thank you. Mom, where are you?. You sent me a message this morning, that said you have some urgent business and told me to meet you at the school. Are you still at home?. I didn't send any message. Are you kidding?. Two of your students, are here keeping me company while I wait for you. What students?. One is Carol, the other is Okawa. Auntie, let me speak with her. Thank you. You're welcome. Your mother is here with us, why don't you come over quickly?. Don't hurt my mother!. Is everything all right?. Should we get Minister Lam?. No... no... I'll go if there's nothing else. Miss Kong!. Miss, come with me quickly. They've taken away your mother. Where is my mom?. Mom!. Let my mother go!. Either you die, and join us down here or your mother dies, you choose. I'm not choosing either one of them!. Push her down!. Mom!. Mom!. Mom... Miss, no... don't kill me... No!. No...Miss!. Don't kill me, Miss... Miss, don't!. Don't kill me, Miss... No!. Sir!. My daughter... What happened in here?. My colleague called me, and I rushed here. A colleague said he saw Jennifer kill fourteen students in the F.4E classroom. Ever since I've been a police officer... I've never seen such a case of cruel mass murder. How did it happen?. They killed my mother, they killed her... They killed my mom... Honey!. What's up... how is our daughter?. Something happened... Where... Daughter!. Girl, what did you do?. Your mother was always with me. Daughter, what happened to you... Why are you like this?. They pushed mother down... Officer Chan Officer Chan, I am the Principal Chan here. He's not the Principal... This lady said she has been working here as a substitute teacher. He is not the Principal... I have never seen her before. The Principal told me, fourteen people from F.4E died. He is not the Principal... But, it all happened twenty years ago. Anyway, we did not hire you. He is not the Principal... What happened here twenty years ago?. We had originally... put the photos of those teachers and students here as a memorial. But afterwards, some teachers felt uncomfortable. That's why it was covered. Sir, please come with me. It's them!. That's them!. It's them... Officer Chan, we found a blood stained... weapon that is very suspicious. Who actually gave it to you?. Chung... Master... Master gave it to me... To fight against the demons... You saw Chung?. Chung committed suicide and died the day before yesterday. I was afraid to tell you. He used a sharp weapon, in from the throat and out from the hindbrain. We suspect it was a screwdriver. Good always prevails over evil. Trust me, I will help you. This is an Exorcist club, it is very powerful. Only when you're desperate, should you ever use it. When I thought they are human... all of them were ghosts. When I thought they're ghost... all of them were human!. Bring her with us. Yes Sir. Evil spirits, only exist in your mind. They cannot touch you or strangle you to death. Ghosts, use all kinds of illusions and the dark, bad side; deep down in one's heart to shatter your faith. Good. You're great!. What's it to me?. I'm not Wong Jing. What are we going to shoot next?. You... what are we going to shoot next?. Shit!. How come it's so cold in here?. We are the Landlord Society and here to play Landlord Poker. I really feel that... I'll have a bronchitis. This is the funeral parlor. How can it keep the corpses if it's not cold enough?. If you want to warm up, go to the crematorium. Are you very cold?. Go and break into Hell. Take two chicken wings with you and barbeque them. How much longer do we need to sit and wait?. Look, there's no one around. What's up?. Are you in a rush to reincarnation?. It's not that busy tonight. What do you mean by not that busy?. We have a lot to do. Quiet!. We're here to attend the funeral. Could you show some respect to the dead?. If Bobo heard that, it would be very embarrassing. Can she hear us?. If she heard, she'd be out here yelling at us already. Look at her!. She's already dead, but still has a smile on her sadly face. Just like the day we went for a trip. Maybe, Bobo had a premonition that already. She knew the destiny already. After all, Bobo is so poor. Everyone has a destiny, it is a fate. If Bobo did not break up with her boyfriend, she wouldn't have gone for the trip. If she didn't go to the trip then she wouldn't get into that shuttle. And now she had lost her life... Yes, it's fate. It's a fate. If she accepted Jack that day. Things wouldn't become like this. Sorry, Jack was after me. No, it's me!. It's me!. Be quiet!. Your turn!. Hello, everyone!. I am Bob. I am your guide of this trip. Welcome to all of you, who joined our... "Tricky Tour" that brings you a 4 days 3 nights... amazing... Iuxuriously Thai... eat and sleep tour, are you feeling happy?. Looks you guys are too ecstatic to say anything. Hey baldy, when do we get to eat?. We haven't eaten anything since we landed. Oh Miss, please don't worry!. We're going to the Flea Market now to have a walk about first. A walkabout for some luck. We will then go to have some food. Let me tell you a secret, that Flea Market... has no fleas!. What a lousy gag!. Escort... Excuse me, Miss!. I'm a Tour Guide, not an escort. It's all the same. Honestly, actually... I don't mind what it is as long as I can put it into my mouth. The most important thing is, tonight... What entertainment programs do we have tonight?. Auntie, why don't you just say it clearly. Don't pretend you don't know. Coming to Thailand, of course we came to look for Thai boys to learn Thai. From body language to body massage; those kind of things... those kinds of fun things!. That's right, just like those Thai boys in "His Magazine". Everyone having a muscular body; like a piece of triangular chocolate that only melts in your mouth, not in your hands. If it melts in my mouth, I can only... swallow it down... My two sisters here, are easy to talk to. If you don't have the 'His Magazine' type, they won't mind Wu Fung, Raymond Lam... or even Patrick Dunn. Your call. If you two are easy to talk to... Frankly speaking, actually my real name is... Hung Qiu Fung!. Go to hell, fat ass!. I'm not into idiots. I'm so sorry!. Are you okay?. I'm fine, thanks. You're welcome, be careful. Go away if you are fine!. I feel dizzy... Auntie, are you all right?. I have menstrual pains. Your periods haven't stopped yet?. "Period comes, Period goes... Periods make people shed tears... Why do women have to experience this process?. " So painful!. You are so heavy. What can I do for you?. Actually, I'll be okay if a man kissed me. You're a man?. Come on, baby!. There are people around. Behave yourself!. I understand you men... Your looks are humble, but you're a beast inside. Come on, baby... That's enough!. Did you charter this shuttle?. Yes, I chartered this shuttle. I like to sit here, and there... I'll go back to my own seat... Excuse me. I've read that book, the author is... ! @ # $ % You bastard!. Stop the car!. Damn it!. Have you finished your cursing?. How come you know how to speak Cantonese?. You are crazy!. I am Hong Kong people... I have three stars on my HKID card, bastard!. But you looked like you understood when I spoke Thai. When did I say I understand?. I was just ignoring you. So... why did you stop the car?. I need to pee, okay to go to toilet?. Just a moment!. You better be quick, bastard!. Excuse me, everyone!. Our driver needs to go pee. and we'll be on our way when he returns. Why don't we sing a song in the mean time?. Good!. I'll do the singing. Everybody knows, my famous song... "Period comes and period goes... Periods make people tired... Suffering more if I had a cold drink..." "Suffering more..." You have periods?. Yes!. Whoever knows the song, sing along, okay?. "Autumn comes... no... Period comes and period goes... Most women suffers... Help me stop my pains and help me face..." Thanks for all your support!. Let's sing together, everybody!. "Period comes and period goes!." "Period comes and period goes!." Buddies, sing along!. "Period comes and period goes!." Do you guys have periods too?. Yes!. Look at your silly face, thank you, thank you!. We got guest!. It's a man Who?. This man is okay. Is he Bobo's boyfriend?. That's him?. Looks a bit like him. If I had a boyfriend that is as cute as him... I would never quarrel with him. If I had a boyfriend like that, I wouldn't let him go. We're not going to let go of this one!. Escort, escort... The driver's back from the toilet, but the car's broken down. Then, when can we arrive at the hotel?. I am starving!. How about those Thai boys?. I'm fine even if it's Hung Qiu Fung. This is such a remote and scary place. Are there any ghosts here?. There won't be any during the day time. But hard to say when it gets dark later. Honestly, you guys also noticed it... I've given all my valuables to the driver and still he won't start the engine no matter what. What can we do?. Look at him, right?. Think of something. I want to go back to the hotel!. How about, if I have sex with him and see if he wants that. Save it!. I don't think it'd be much help. Let's have a cup of tea first, it may help to calm down. I want too. Hey handsome, why are you here alone in Thailand?. A single man coming to Thailand, most likely here to go whoring. Of course not!. I was originally here with my colleague, however he noticed his passport had expired when we arrived at the airport. Therefore he couldn't board the plane. Don't get me wrong. Your colleague... is a boy or a girl?. He's a boy. Two men coming to Thailand... Definitely here for the prostitutes!. That's really not the case. Actually I came to Thailand... for photography. It doesn't matter. The four of us, are all here for the male prostitutes. After meeting you tonight, I could save it. Which room are you staying in?. Tell us!. After bathing and cleaning up... We'll have a 5P party tonight. I still haven't got the room number yet. No matter, you can come to our room. Yes, we can all party together. Do you dare?. The worst would be to die in a love clutch together!. Doesn't have to be so mean even if she is quarrelling. Just leave her alone. Let's go... Did you hear this?. Say something!. Hey!. Hold on!. Do you have any Thai Baht?. My card is not working, I'll need to get a new one. I'll exchange it for you later. No... No... I just bought a new one... at the airport. Thank you!. Come, I need to search you!. What's up?. Your legs are quite thick. What is this coming out of your pants?. Don't touch... It's just a flash light. Do you have a lot of money?. Thank you. How much?. I'll pay you back in Hong Kong dollars. That's okay, no big deal. Thank you. All right, my name is Jack, and you are?. My name is Bobo, how about you?. I'm called Harriet. I'm called Mon, like the Mon in Doraemon. I am Cheryl. I am Mindy. Bobo, although we just met each other, but I overheard you talking on the phone just now, and it sounds like you have love problem. You can share it with us. It's nothing. Bobo, don't be afraid. Boys don't grow up, if you don't scold them... That's right, I always argue with my boyfriend when I was in Hong Kong. When we quarrel I'd say I'll kill his whole family. That's why I say... Men are like jewelry, you have to change it to feel better. It's fixed. All aboard!. The shuttle is here... I think he's been driven crazy. Let's go... Excuse me. Are you Bobo's boyfriend?. Hi, I am a good friend of Bobo. Nice to meet you. But I didn't expect to meet you in this kind of place. I have never heard from Bobo that she has friends like you. How much do you men know about women?. If you really knew Bobo, you wouldn't argue with her that often. How did you know we argued a lot?. Bobo talked about you all the time. Especially on that trip. She told us a lot of things about you. What did she say?. Did she leave any words for me?. Do you really want to know?. Please, tell me more about Bobo. I really miss her. Okay then. I'll tell you what Bobo wanted to say to you. But there is one condition... What's the condition?. You have to have dinner with us. Dinner?. Of course!. We've been sitting here the whole night, without eating anything... Feeling so weak, how can we tell you anything?. Well Bobo, she... What are you waiting for?. It is so quiet all night, are we enjoying the air conditioning here?. Let's go Quickly... quickly... This is my home, not bad huh?. We agreed to have dinner, what are we doing at your house?. It is difficult to get a place if we eat outside, they always put in way too much seasoning. It can't compare to dining at home. Come on, Handsome, take a seat, make yourself at home. Are you tired after working all day?. I'll draw a bath for you. Are you serious?. You think of everything, I'll cook something up for you. It'll be ready soon. Come and help me!. Hey Handsome, you're all wrapped up, where are you from?. Hawaii Isn't Hawaii very hot?. We have air conditioning. Aren't you afraid of the cold?. I'm afraid... You have strong arms, if you cuddled me with them... I should feel very cozy. Let's try it now. Do you know, I always feel... empty, lonely... and cold!. Excuse me, I'd like to visit the washroom. Just likes to bullshit, and doesn't even lend a hand. Ready to eat that fast, did you cook?. Didn't really cook, we're having hot pot tonight. Anything I can help with?. Handsome, go to the kitchen and bring out the pot of soup. Be careful, it's hot. I'd be very upset, if you got hurt. Hey Handsome... You can call me Karl. Karl, you're just staring and not eating, why have you stopped?. Are you afraid that we may poison you?. I've eaten, and not that hungry. You girls eat, I'm fine with just looking. You're funny, and just like to look?. Then would smelling it be better?. That would be fine. You girls just eat, no need to worry about me. Tell me quickly, what message did Bobo have for me. Or did Bobo leave anything for you gals. Why would she leave us anything for no reason?. Why?. You really want her stuff?. Bobo left too sudden, and didn't leave anything for me. I remember. What do you remember?. I remember Bobo was just like you, she didn't like to have hot pot either. That night when we were having dinner... and just like you, she stopped eating anything too. Please enjoy. Are you kidding?. Who would anyone go to Thailand for hot pot?. Don't you think it's not hot enough here?. You're insane, to have to only have Thai food when in Thailand?. You don't eat Hai Nian Chicken Rice and Singaporean fried noodle in Hong Kong. I don't see you only eating those Aberdeen fishballs all your life. You can't say that. When you come to Thailand, you should follow the local customs. Otherwise why are you here?. AV Girl is popular in Japan. I didn't see you following Japanese customs when you were there last month?. Why don't you film several audit videos for all your friends?. How do you know that she didn't?. It's pretty obvious, she is a fellow student of Sora Aoi. Aoi without a big breasts. How do you know I don't?. You can clearly see by looking at you. Go examine your eyes!. After chatting for so long... Jack, you haven't told us what you do. I'm a policeman. Jack's a cop?. Have you ever worked undercover?. Just like that super cop... Everything is...nothing?. Just goofing?. I'm just kidding!. I work in the Organized Crime & Triad Bureau. OCTB?. They focus on big cases. Have you had any special cases lately?. Tell us. They're just... this and that... and those... These and that and those?. You think Officer Jack will spill his guts?. Those cases are all confidential, he can't tell. But there are only a few of us here, tell us just a little bit. It's really not very nice. Actually, what is it like to kill?. After working as a policeman for so many years... Actually, most murders are committed on an impulse. You've read this book too and I remember it says... There is an old doctor, who looks to be decent. One day... he kills his wife of several decades. The reason was just because his wife had been calling him rubbish everyday. The problem was that, it wasn't the first time his wife scolded him. His wife had been scolding him for a full thirty years. Why did the doctor specifically lose his mind on that day?. I know... that doctor had a period that day. Emotions... human emotions are very strange. A sudden impulse, can make people do... the things that they may regret later. I finally understand, why I often hurt people because every time when men see me, they get impulsive. Actually, when you get extremely angry. You should calm down for three seconds. These three seconds, could save a person's life or save your own life. Maybe because their plan was not thorough enough and that's why you caught them. But if they kill with careful planning, I don't think you could've solve the case that easily. You can't say that. I believe every case, has their own flaw. What kind of flaw?. The Will of God. I believe in it. It usually happens without any logic and difficult to escape from. Bobo, aren't you eating anything?. Your face... Iooks worse than Keroro. Are you feeling sick?. Bobo!. Is Bobo ok?. Shall we go check on her?. I won't... She must be pregnant. This kind of storyline, have been used to death by TVB. You like watching TVB?. I only wanted to watch Raymond Lam. Raymond Lam is TVB Stop talking about Raymond, I can't eat if we keep talking about him. Come on, let's eat!. Who is it?. Surprise!. Bobo!. This room is huge. And the view is great. How come the bathroom is so small?. There's nothing to eat here?. Are you sleeping?. Did we wake you up?. That's pretty obvious. Bobo, why are you sleeping in so late?. It's getting dark. We all decided to go swimming, and do some night-diving. I didn't sleep well last night, I'd like to sleep-in a bit more. Are you crazy?. At this time, we should be out looking for fun. I just had a look, and there are four Thai boys down there just like the Fahrenheit type, so cute. We're going down to splash around... I don't like to swim. No, doctors say... exercise is good for the fetus. What you said?. Bobo, are you pregnant?. Are you insane. Jack, I got one too. What have you got?. I got you here with me... and I am not afraid of anything. Let's do something exciting tonight, like skinny-dipping. My dream bag!. This handbag is the most expensive handbag at Milan Station for three consecutive months. Bobo, you are so lucky. Look... Give it back to me!. Who is he?. You are so bad, looking at other people's stuff without asking. You'd watch it with us. That girl on the side is quite pretty. Bobo, how come you look like a passer-by?. That man looks pretty cool, who is he?. Boyfriend. What about the woman then?. His wife. The man is your boyfriend and the woman is his wife... Then who are you?. This kind of storyline, after TVB finishes with it... ATV will definitely follow and use it too!. The third wheel, silly Do you watch ATV?. ATV is going to shut down. ATV hasn't shut down yet, but just keeps repeating the same programming. Is it any of your business?. I'm not going swimming!. Go away!. Go... Go away!. Go!. Bobo!. Go!. Why do you always have such a temper?. Although I've known you for only three short days but I really treat you whole-hearted. I'm so disappointed in you. We hate you!. Let's go!. We are no longer friends!. Don't expect any other guy to go after you. Why don't you leave?. Whatever is making you feel sad?. Why don't we talk about it. I'm really tired, please leave me alone. Sorry. I didn't expect Bobo, to tell anyone of my relationship with Phoenix. Look at you, you must think you're Casanova. You like being with lots of women. Seriously, how much of this is real?. No matter what, I'll support you. As the saying goes:. Man is not decadent due only to poverty... When you have the wealth, you will be tempted. I am not that kind of man, I only love Bobo. You can say whatever you want now, she's dead anyway. If you still miss her so much... Why don't you go down to be with her?. Right, you said you saw a photo in her handbag... Where is her handbag?. Did you see anything else in her handbag?. It's like this, that handbag was my present to Bobo. I want to have it back as a memento. She's dead already, what good is it to get back the handbag?. Do you want to cuddle the handbag everyday?. You shouldn't feel too heart broken, Bobo forgave you before she left. She had forgiven me?. Didn't she call you that day?. Hey!. Having fun?. Yes!. A lot of fun?. If it's so much fun, then don't come back Hong Kong tonight. There's a tour coming up, going to Libya right away. Do you want to see the war?. Yes!. If so... Come over to my room after breakfast and finalize the formalities... We "Tricky Tours" take things seriously. It's just a name. We'll go when finished, okay?. Come... Hey!. Are you going to Libya?. Lib what?. Go away!. Bobo, are you really not returning to Hong Kong?. I plan to stay here for a few more days then maybe go somewhere else. So when will you be back in Hong Kong?. I don't know, but we'll have dinner when I get back. How do we find you when we're back to Hong Kong?. Social networking sites. Karl Actually, it's almost time to go. You should show me your gun for a quick look. I didn't bring my gun here. I don't believe you, it's obviously in here. @ # $ % &!.!.!.!. What did you say?. I was swearing What language did you speak?. We are in Thailand, we would obviously swear in Thai. Block it!. Block it... What's taking so long, I'm really hungry. Jack, are you hungry?. I'm not. You went pee for that long?. No, there's a car to pick me up, I'm leaving first. That soon?. Just wait. What's up?. You've forgotten this book. My gift to you, I have another one at home. Enough chat, hate to make somebody wait. Is it a boyfriend?. Wouldn't be hiring an expensive private chauffer now?. That's it, goodbye!. I don't have boyfriend. You can look at me... Jack... It's hopeless. Jack... That day, look how happy Bobo was when she left. Who would've expected her to get onto a wrong car, and lose her life. After all that, you guys only knew her from the tour. And you say you and Bobo were good friends. We are all good friends. How can you measure a friendship by time. It's fate. We should know each other earlier. There are lots of feelings, that doesn't need to be told. Let me ask you once again... Have you seen Bobo's handbag?. Do you know what's inside?. How would we know what's inside?. Your line of questioning, is getting stranger and stranger. Are you worried about the handbag, or are you worried about Bobo?. Wasting my time. You're crazy!. Using a knife to stab my friend... What did you put in?. Something you shouldn't have eaten. For example, rat poison. This time the portion is more precise than last time. Don't worry, it won't be too painful. You'll lose your breath soon. What's wrong, why don't you eat?. We are not hungry. Right, you eat some more. Is the food to your tastes?. You guys invited me here, not just for the dead shrimp and dead fish?. Getting back to the point, what about the debt?. I really don't have the money. Could you give me few more days?. When you embezzled the money, give me a few more days?. Don't say I'm mean, but I have given you 1 0 days in total. Karl is really working hard to raise the funds. You know the current stock market, has been dropping. He will pay back the money to you once he has it. You are so funny. It's you guys who are stealing from me now. Don't make it like I'm up in here, collecting on your debt. In short... If you don't settle this account by tonight, I will call the police. Whatever you got to say, say it at the police station. Phoenix, you really want to be that absolute?. That couple of million dollars means nothing to you. Yeah, just another couple of million on some... clothes, shoes and a few handbags. But, I'm not happy when you use them on women. Especially the women are of that quality. Even if you don't feel the shame, I do. It's my fault, blame me if you want. Don't blame Karl, don't call the police. It's wasn't easy to qualify for that Certified Public Accountant License. Phoenix Think clearly, do you really want to be so extreme?. I am your husband. Honey?. You still remember you have a wife. When you're out having fun, why do you shut off your phone when your wife calls?. When you get drunk, why do you tell everyone that your wife is dead?. Does a couple sleep in separate rooms?. How long have it been since we had sex?. One year?. Or has it been two?. I don't even have the key to your room. I can't even remember what your penis looks like. Honey?. You can do whatever, but just don't call the police. I am calling the police. I'm sorry... You stabbed me?. I am your cousin... Not only did you take my husband, you stabbed me too?. Let's die together!. Bitch!. Don't go!. Hack you to death!. Hack you to death!. Why are you so impulsive?. I told you I slipped some drugs into the hot pot. Look at you... all messed up and I have to pick up after you again. Honey, you look so painful flipping around. Why don't you just save your breath and be on your way. Honey, look!. This is your money. When you were out, I took it from your safe. Don't worry, I will spend it with great pleasures. You want to call the police?. In your next life. Say something!. Don't you like to scold me?. Scold me!. I told you to say something!. Don't look at me!. Go to hell!. You bitch!. Shit!. Have you finished puking yet?. Quick!. Come out and help me with the corpse. What are you looking at?. Help me!. Drag it over there. Sorry, cousin... Hurry up!. Where is my mobile?. What are you talking about?. I can't find my mobile phone. I haven't used my mobile today... yet I clearly remember bringing it out with me. But I didn't take it out during dinner... Where is it?. Are you done yet?. Your mind is frazzled. Come back with me to get it, it'll be quick... You're crazy!. Look for it yourself if you want!. I'll wait for you in the car. Go!. Bitch, double-cross me?. You're going to die when I find you!. "Period comes and period goes... Women suffer the most... Could you make me painless for me to take it" Thank you!. Everybody!. "Period comes and period goes... Period's here bringing me tears..." Everybody sing along!. I found your grandfather who is in a nursing home. If you don't pay back my money, you can visit him at the cemetery during the Ching Ming and Chung Yeung Festivals next year. I am Bobo. What, you finally came to find me?. You should know that, I really miss you. Stop bullshitting, what do you want from me?. Be quick. Pay back my money and your grandfather lives a few years longer. Otherwise, you'll have one more person to die with you. Do you dare?. I will die with you at most!. Do you hear me?. Say something!. Hey!. Stop!. Do you have Thai Baht?. My card isn't working, I want to change to another one. I'll exchange it for you later. No... No... Just now at the airport... I bought a new one. Take it... Thank you. What, I'm returning your call. Had you called a bit later, I would have done it. Just give me few more days. Okay, I'll wait for you. But to tell the truth, I really do miss you. Bobo, we don't really have to end this way. How do we contact you back to Hong Kong?. Social networking sites. Karl Why are you calling me again?. Your grandfather was admitted to the hospital. What have you done?. If you hurt him, I won't let you off!. He had a stroke yesterday, I sent him to the hospital. His condition is stabled now. You don't have to worry. Bobo, all the things I've been doing all these years, were all for you. I know, you hate me for killing Phoenix But really, I couldn't stand her treating you so cruel. Now she is not around anymore. No one can stop us from being together. But I'm still having nightmares every night. I can still see the way she died. I'm so scared!. I am really scared... Come back. We're together now, don't be scared. Grandfather was calling your name all night. He and I worry about you so much. I know it's my fault. I shouldn't have threatened you with your grandfather. But I was afraid that you wouldn't come back. Bobo, I really miss you. Are you serious?. Yes I am. Tell me where you are and I'll send someone to pick you up. You write down the address of my hotel in Thailand. I got a car to pick me up. I'll leave first. Is it a boyfriend?. Wouldn't be hiring an expensive private chauffer now?. That's it, goodbye. I found her, remember to do it without a trace. Is it done yet?. It's done, but I couldn't find the thing you wanted. What!. What's wrong with you?. There was an accident. What accident?. Hello... Hey?. Can you hear me?. Anybody there?. Hello... In order to find where Bobo kept the money she stole from me, I decided to attend her funeral. I believe Bobo had accomplices. We are Bobo's good friend. Nice to meet you. But I didn't expect to meet you in this kind of place. Bobo was always talking about you. Especially on that trip... she told us a lot about you. Just because of those words that you said I suspected you knew where the money is. That's why I had dinner with you. I have no idea who you gals are. So I better be caution. Whatever the outcome is... Just consider yourself bad luck. What did you put in there?. Sorry, ladies... That's what you get for pretending to be good friends with a dead woman. You deserve it. Handsome, are you coming out or not?. So tired... Where'd they go?. Don't see them?. You guys couldn't have survived... Were you guys serious and real?. Once you're dead, you can't die again for the second time. But my stomach really hurts. It was hurting so bad that I thought I was going to die again. It was really disgusting, I was foaming at the mouth. It's rare for us to come up from below. Of course I have to go to TVB to see Raymond Lam. Why do we have to have hot pot with this bastard?. Raymond Lam?. He's making movies in the mainland. How did you know Raymond was making movies in the mainland?. I don't mind saying this after death, actually I have a crush on Raymond Lam. The newspaper reports are real?. Stop your chattering, let's get back to him first. Bobo told us already from down there. If we came up here to have hot pot with you, you would definitely kill us. I really didn't expect it, that you look so pious yet with such a evil heart. Impossible... I did put the drug in, how can you survive?. We have become what we are now... all due to you. Shit... shit... shit... Escort, why are you troubled, like you've lost your business?. Get out of here bitch!. I have some bad news to announce... Our company's shuttle bus, broke down on the way. We really may not be able to go back to Hong Kong tonight. No way?. Are you kidding me?. I bought tickets to Raymond Lam's "Chok-ful Chok-ful Concert" It's was really difficult to get, I have to go back. His concerts are 'Chok' every year. It wouldn't matter if you skipped a year. You think he won't 'Chok' next year?. How about, if everybody came to Libya with me. Don't you want gigolos?. There are lots of them there. No!. You have the gall to ask us to stay for another night?. This tour of yours, lousy food, remote hotels... perverted tour guide, even worse than being a beggar. I have to go now, give me a car!. Auntie, a car, we definitely don't have. Desperate to go back to Hong Kong, good, well... here is the way to return, you may go back. Don't worry, when the bandits see what you look like, they won't do anything to you. Save it. What do you mean by that?. I have to go back tonight, I made a date with my boyfriend. I don't believe the bandits won't want me. Mr. Bandits!. I'm here!. Take me away!. No one's answering you. No... Of course there's no one answering me. Look, there is the police, the bandits won't come now. Don't worry. I got a way. Bobo said her boyfriend is coming to pick her up. We can hitch a ride. That's right!. Still yakking?. Let's go!. We might not be able to catch up to her, let's go. You guys go first, I'm waiting here for the bandits. Come on, hurry... You guys are really going?. Then let's go together. Don't come. Stop!. More people means fewer seats. What if we don't have a seat because of it?. Goodbye. Bobo, good thing you haven't left yet. Yes, so worry that you had gone. Bobo, thanks for taking us to the airport. We're going the same way anyway. Actually where are you headed for?. I'll take an earlier flight back to Hong Kong. Have you made up with your boyfriend?. Sort of. Driver, how come we've stopped?. It's not broken down again, is it?. Is it done?. It's done, but I couldn't find the thing you wanted. What!. What's wrong with you?. There was an accident... Hello...hello?. Can you hear me?. Anybody... You're not human, you are ghosts... You are not human... You are ghosts... It was due to you. We thought it was bad enough to be robbed but didn't expect to be scapegoats. I had no intentions. I didn't mean it... That first time you didn't mean it, but just now was full intention?. Let me go... Iet me go... I don't want to die... Like I always say, handsome guys have no conscience. I'm begging you, I really don't want to die... Please let me go. It's time for us to go down below. But I haven't played enough, what should we do?. We'll bring him down with us, and take our time to play. We'll do exactly that. No... No... No!. Nothing... nothing... No ghosts... no ghost... I'm not afraid to kill, why should I be afraid of ghosts?. It's not real, they're not real... It's not real... No ghost... No ghosts... no ghost... Hey!. Hey!. Thank you. Hey Handsome, where are you headed?. I'm sorry, we were going to let you go. But when we got back, Bobo said No. She's coming up to bring you down herself. What's the situation?. A corpse was found inside the water tank. Preliminary findings, looks to be a female victim. Aged between 20 to 30... Time of death was around 2 weeks ago. Who made the report?. The Chief of the village. He said that there was no water for the whole morning and didn't know who had forgotten to shut off their tap. He knocked on every door, yet no one answered. Then he checked on the water tank, and found the body. Have you get other statements from all the villagers?. All were recorded Sir, except one. It's a tenant, we had called but no one answered yet. We found the landlord, and got the key. Let's go and have a look. Yes Sir. Follow me. Sir, we'll go inside to check it out. You forgot this book. My gift to you, I have another one at home. I believe every case, has a flaw... What kind of flaw?. The Will of God, I believe in it. It usually happens without any logic, and difficult to escape from... I can't find my mobile phone... Come back with me to get it, it'll be quick. You're crazy!. Look for it yourself if you want!. Bitch, double-cross me?. You're going to die when I find you!.
