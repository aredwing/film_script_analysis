And the yapping is getting louder and louder. I walk down and say, 'Hey mate, you alright?' And he just sits there, says nothing. I lift his head up with my hands... and he's got this cut across his neck. It looks like a big fucking mouth.

She kicked him out for maybe, I don't know, 48 hours... then took him back into her home with that daughter... and just let him live there. Just let that fucker live in her house. JOHN: You wouldn't do that, would ya? - VERNA: Fuck no. - JOHN: What would you do? VERNA: Oh, first chance I got, I would fucking... probably skin his penis. What about you, Nigel?

The whole country applauds a bunch of blokes... who killed and tortured men, don't they? Why do they do that? Because they fucking deserved it, didn't they? See, I don't get it.
