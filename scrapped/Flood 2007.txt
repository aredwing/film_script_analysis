That's got to be a mistake. (Woman on TV) Despite attempts to limit loss of life and property damage... the residents of Maine on the east coast face the grim task of cleaning up a shattered state. - The storm unleashed... - (Woman) It's a few more days. And your dad's really been looking forward to having you over. Yes, he has! I am not patronising you. - (Dialling tone) - Mel? Mel? She hung up on me. - Please tell me I was never like that. - (Chuckles) - More tea? - Please. Preferably with a sedative. (Gran) How about with a biscuit instead? There's water pouring through the door. (Creaking) Mum! Mum! Oh! Oh, no! Open! Oh! Open! Open! Your sister's going to kill me. I promised her you'd be on time. We better hurry up, then. You need to review this. Pressure's continuing to drop in the North Sea. Press offices are pushing for further updates. We're inundated with requests. - I need to run the shipping forecast by you. - OK. OK. Quiet, everyone! This storm we've been tracking for the last few days, I need everything on it. Where it's headed, how fast. Get me the latest atmospheric pressure reports for the Northeast. Everything you've got from the British Oceanic Data Centre. In 40 minutes, I'm briefing the Deputy Prime Minister. (Woman) The Thames Barrier became operational in 1983 and is the largest fixed tidal defence system in the world. It has ten moveable gates stretching and is capable of holding back billions of gallons of water that would otherwise flood London. - The Barrier is what... - Lets you sleep safely at night. Good morning. (Computer voice) Samantha Morrison (Woman) You're clear. Miss Morrison, these came for you. Ha. Thank you. - (Samantha) Good morning, Frank. - Boss. See the news? If you're referring to football, I don't want to talk about it. I'm not. This will be what you're interested in, then. Figures for the tidal gauges at Moray and Aberdeen. Things aren't looking too clever with this storm in Scotland. Ten hours to high tide. Recalculate the tide's expected height when it reaches London Bridge. - I'll activate the protocol for a high tide closure. - No problem. (Woman on TV) The rescue operation continues in Wick. Despite hazardous conditions air rescue support is being called in but those in need of rescue far outnumber available resources leaving many stranded on rooftops The figures from Wick show the current death toll at 21. Another 15 are missing. We can expect those numbers to rise. We're still waiting for reports from further along the coast. The Prime Minister is calling in from Australia in ten minutes. - So I need to know why we had no warning. - Sir. Isn't this the storm that hit the east coast of the US? Sir, forecasting is not an exact science. Haven't you been tracking it for five days? - The storm is constantly changing. - You have models. - With respect, sir... When a storm surge is moving this fast, there's no means of predicting exactly what it will do. By the time we have new data, it's already out of date. - What's gonna happen next? - Well, based on the available data... the storm is moving northeast back into the North Sea. - So, the worst of it's over? - I believe so. Though actually you can't predict what this storm is going to do at all. Can you? I'm confident about this, sir. Deploy full emergency services within a 50-mile radius of Wick and use all available resources to check the sea defences below Wick. Already under way. Best try do everything we can, and hope this time you might be right. (Phone rings) Kate? Hi, Dad. Just calling to remind you it's your granddaughter's christening at ten o'clock. - I haven't forgotten. - Please don't be late. And, uh... Dad, just so you know... Rob's coming. - I see. - I didn't think he'd be able to make it but... (Baby cries) Yes. It's been a long time. Are you sure this is a good idea? Yes. I do. But does Rob know I'll be there? Dad, I want you there and your granddaughter wants you there. It's a big day for her, you know. So no excuses, please. - Ten o'clock, then. - Don't be late. (Reporters) Deputy Prime Minister! Good morning. Good morning, Reverend. How you holding up? Well, we're used to turbulent weather here in Scotland. But this... this was something else. We... we just were not prepared. And why weren't we given any warning? Sir, do you have any idea of the fatalities we've experienced today? Sir? No. No, I haven't. (Reporter) Do you have any advice for us? What's your name? What's her name? - Her name is Kirstie. - Kirstie? That's a... very pretty name. A very pretty name. Why wasn't I informed about Arbroath? Set up a meeting with Hopkins from the Met Office and Fuller from the Environment Agency. They better damn well have an explanation! - (Woman) Hey, Kate. - Look, you'll have all the help you need. - Just in time. - I've gotta go. Bye. - Minute to spare. - You didn't have to come back for this. - What kind of uncle do you take me for? - Thank you. (Church bell) - Waiting on someone? - It's probably just as well. We thank You, Almighty God, for the gift of water to sustain, refresh and cleanse all life. Over water the Holy Spirit moved in the beginning of creation. Through water You led the children of Israel from slavery in Egypt to freedom in the Promised Land. .. received the baptism of John, who was anointed by the Holy Spirit as the Messiah, the Christ... We thank You, Father, for the water of baptism. - What name have you given this child? - Elsa Emelia. .. and know Your goodness all her days and be protected from evil. Elsa Emelia, I baptise you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. (Congregation) Amen. - Hey. - Kate. - Why didn't you tell me he'd be here? - Cos I knew you'd react like this. And I wanted you both here. You've hardly seen each other since Mum died. Yeah, maybe you're right, maybe you're right. He did turn up for the funeral. I give you that. My daughter needs a grandfather. She deserves that. (Phone) Rob, this is a new start. - I'd like us to look forwards. Be a family. - Wait. Wait. Yeah, wait. A family? You mean like being there when the kids are growing up? Come on. You know it wasn't as simple as that. You should see him with Elsa. He really does care. The only thing he cares about... is himself. Anna. - (Anna) You OK? - Yeah. Bad day. It's about to get worse. You need to go to the Barrier. - What? - They're closing the gates this evening. But there's a problem, and it needs looking at right away. - Thank you. - Rob, you're the only one I have left. Christ! I mean... Sam's there. We're under contract. Someone's got to check it out. Easy for you to say. You weren't married to her. There must be someone else. What about you? Very funny but, I'm a bit busy running your business for you. Taxi's on its way. Bye. - (Dialling tone) - Yeah, thanks. Actually she's just returning to her office. I'll get her to call you. (Knock) - More coverage from Arbroath. - Thanks. Inspector Hendrick's mum has sent you in some cakes again. Why don't you take'em home? I don't think it's me she's trying to fatten up, ma'am. Penny? Penny? - Get me Samantha Morrison at the Barrier. - Will do. (Woman on TV) We interrupt this programme for breaking news from the English coast. The severe storm that devastated Wick and Arbroath earlier today is continuing to wreak havoc further south having left a trail of carnage in Scotland. The storm is now battering the coastal towns of northern England. (Phone) - Hello. - Malcolm? Leonard Morrison. Ah, Professor Morrison. It's been a long time. - Indeed. I have a favour to ask you. Now's not a good time. The boss is on the warpath, and we're dealing with this storm. This won't take a minute. Could you email me the figures from all the tide gauges south of Aberdeen? - Can I ask why you need that information? - Let's call it professional curiosity. We can call it that. I wouldn't ask for these figures if I didn't need them. Storms continue to wreak havoc here in the Northeast. Winds of 90 miles per hour are being recorded along some parts of this Scottish coast. Yes, just hold for a moment. The Chairman of the US Federal Bank. Mr Moysoe, you're on speaker phone. Arthur. I'm sorry to hear about your casualties. Why, I appreciate that, Arthur. And I'll convey your sentiments to the Prime Minister. I'm sure you're aware the dollar has dropped a further 40 points overnight. Confidence has been lower here since the storm damage in Maine. And we have some big players dumping some huge quantities of stock. We could be facing a major meltdown. I'm sorry to hear that, but just at this moment we're trying to deal with the human catastrophe. I'm just calling to let you know you could be facing an economic one too. A couple of these guys have started dumping UK stock. It's having a ripple effect. Thanks, Arthur. I'll talk to you later. (Woman) Keep my office informed of any barrier operations connected to the storm's progress. - Absolutely, ma'am. Due to the high spring tide and the storm damage in Scotland, we are planning a precautionary closure. But if anything comes up I will certainly let you know. Thanks. Penny. Get me the Met Office. Will do. Commissioner, you have the full cooperation of the Met Office. - (Woman) I need to be kept informed - I've emailed you the updates. - Thank you. Thanks for your cooperation. - Yeah. We're on top of everything. - Professor, I'm a bit busy. - (Leonard) Hear me out Those figures you sent me for the tide gauges... - Yeah? - Don't you think they're on the high side? It's a storm surge. Nothing unexpected given the circumstances. I've fed the numbers into my computer model. If the surge continues to grow at this rate... the entire east coast of England could be in trouble. Malcolm. - What's the latest on the tidal gauges? - Gotta go. All right. Thanks, Anna. Hi, Sam. What are you doing here? Problem on Pier 1. No one else available. Ah, right. Well, it'll do you good to get your hands dirty. - You're looking well. - Thanks. I hear business is good. Anna still running things for you? Well, nothing's changed. - She gives the orders. I obey. - Hm. Nice flowers. And I know it's not your birthday. - I know. It's great, isn't it? - Yeah, it's great. - Does he know you hate roses? - (Knock) Oh, look at this. It must be my lucky day. They've sent the big boss for me to push around. How are you, Rob? - You're looking lovely as ever, Frank. Right. Uh... well. Shall we go? Our guys don't think it's anything major, but with this early closure, and seeing's how we pay you guys so much just to sit around, I thought I might call on your services. - What do you reckon? - Could be corrosion. - Or? - A wear problem on the main bearings, which will affect lift capacity. Yeah, we thought as much. Leave it with me. I'll run some ultrasonic tests. - If it turns up positive... - We wait nine months for the parts to arrive. (Man) Frank... I'm at a detail on Pier 3 There's a hydraulic problem. I need you to look at. On my way. Sorry. All right. Get your paper! There you go, darling. Thank you very much. Storm body count rises! Storm body count rises! Late Standard! I want to know we're not gonna need any more body bags today. Latest figures have the storm heading east into the North Sea, towards the Hook of Holland. You told me this morning. What about Arbroath? Sir, the storm is not behaving within expected parameters. (Snorts) Has the danger passed? Yes or no? It's difficult to say. If the prevailing winds were to drive the storm south, the surge would be squeezed between the British coastline and mainland Europe. Now, this creates a funnelling effect and raises sea level. But that's just a worst-case scenario. Most surges lose momentum before that. They... they just peter out. Not always, though? No. Not always. So? What do you think? Nothing of immediate concern. She's pretty tough. - How much longer do you need? - What's your deadline for closure? We need you out of here in two and a half hours. Well, well. In that case... .. I'll get out of your way as soon as possible, then, shall I? (Sighs) - You know I didn't mean it like that. - Yeah, yeah. - Well, you can manage till Frank gets back? - Oh, yeah. Don't worry about me. His name is Duncan. We've been out a few times. I don't need to explain myself to you. - Yeah, that's right. So why are you? - Cos you asked. - No, I didn't. Cos you wanted to know. (Sighs) - He's an architect. - Really? England are two-nil up! Two-nil... Oh, you're Canadian. Why would you care? Two-nil. Is it possible that this storm could change its course? If we did see the storm change its current course and a severe rise in sea level, there could be flooding down the east coast of England. - Damage estimate? - The last time we saw something similar was... The storm that hit East Anglia and Canvey Island killed 300 people on land, another 200 at sea, nearly. That surge was a body of water four metres high and the size of Ireland. At present, this storm is heading out to sea. Experience suggests it would be pointless to cause unnecessary alarm at this stage. Right! So tell me, how the hell am I gonna reassure the public? (Journalists shouting) - Steven. - Thank you, sir. Does the Prime Minister intend to cancel his tour and return home to deal with this crisis? The situation is fully under control. But, yes, the Prime Minister will be flying home from Sydney. You can bet he's very keen to be here for and with the British public at this time. Deputy Prime Minister! Deputy Prime Minister! - Yes? - Why was there no warning? Well, just at this present time we're concentrating on managing the situation. The latest figures from the Met Office... indicate that the storm is heading eastwards out into the North Sea. Deputy Prime Minister, are you saying that the danger has passed? Well, yes, yes. I'm very pleased to be able to say that the indicators at the present time... show that our coastline is no longer under threat. - Deputy Prime Minister - That's the last question. Thank you. - (Shouting) - Sir? There's a gentleman in reception. I explained you were busy, but he won't take no for an answer. He's insisting on seeing you. - Who? - He says his name's Leonard Morrison. - Sam. - It's OK. He's fine. - Sorry to have to trouble you. - No, it's fine. We'll talk in my office. - Tonight's is the highest tide of the year. Yeah, which is why we are closing the barrier. My computer model is predicting that the storm and the surge will reach the mouth of the Thames Estuary at high tide. This means that the volume of water moving upriver will be massively amplified. Don't underestimate the Barrier. It's designed for problems like this. Not this much water! Sam, you know I wouldn't come here... Have you spoken with your old colleagues at the Environment Agency? They're not taking my calls. You're saying... the confluence of storm, surge and tide... Could be catastrophic. (Hopkins) This doesn't make any sense. It was heading east towards Holland two hours ago. This wasn't meant to happen. It's heading straight for us. - Commissioner Nash. - Sam Morrison.. - Hi Sam What can I do for you? - We may have a problem. I've got Leonard Morrison here. He's an expert in the field. Professor Morrison has uncovered some worrying data. According to this, it looks as though the storm and today's spring tide could collide, resulting in a volume of water so great that it could override the Barrier. Info. - Let me get right back to you. - Of course. Excuse me, Leonard. (Penny) Morrison's an environmental scientist. He was chief analyst at the Flood Hazard Research Centre, and sat on a Parliamentary advisory committee which reported on the siting of the Barrier. The report he submitted outlined a key flaw. He reckoned that the Barrier was situated in the wrong place and recommended that it be built closer to the mouth of the Thames Estuary, closer to the sea. Basically, his concern is that under certain tidal conditions the Barrier could be overwhelmed. Get me Sam Morrison again. He just turned up. - He's here about the Barrier. - Yeah, of course he is. Look. I know that this is really bad timing, but we need to listen to what your father has to say. - I don't care what he has to say. - If this storm changes direction... Is that what this is about? No, don't... don't tell me. Storm surge coincides with the spring tide, and the Barrier won't hold. - Am I right? - Yeah. I've seen the forecasting on his model. - It's a very real possibility. - I don't believe this. You still don't get it, do you? This is an obsession! This obsession destroyed our lives! He's wrong but he could never admit it! Even though that meant losing his own family. My mother died heartbroken because of this. Why should I listen to him now? Just hear your father out. And you, Hopkins? What's the latest position? The storm has dramatically altered its course within the last hour. It's likely to hit the southeastern coast of England later this afternoon. - Can you be more specific? - Gales up to 80 miles an hour. So we should anticipate considerable damage. You're all missing the point. With respect, Professor Morrison, this is hardly an appropriate forum for your theories. - According to my computer model. - Must we? Forecasts from the Met Office and Environment Agency haven't been very accurate so far. Sorry, Professor. Please continue. Assuming no change in wind conditions, my figures indicate that this storm, and the tidal surge travelling with it, will reach southeast England and the Thames Estuary at high tide. What does that mean? The combined volume of water will overwhelm the Thames Barrier. So, what, are you saying that central London is now at risk? I'm afraid I am. And I'm not talking here about a single wave. This is an event that could last for hours. So, which areas are most at risk? The danger zone includes the Docklands Light Railways, 68 Underground stations, three World Heritage sites at risk, eight power stations, dozens of museums, and, of course, your location in Whitehall. What does this mean in terms of population? Approximately one and a half million people either live or work within the flood danger zone. How long have we got? Figures I've received from the Met Office indicate that the storm will reach the Thames Estuary three hours from now. Dear God! That's seven o'clock this evening! Why didn't anyone see this coming? Well, somebody did. We need to initiate evacuation protocol immediately. The longer we delay the decision to evacuate, the greater the risk of there being substantial casualties. Sir? Do it. Rob! Thanks for... in there. Well. It look s like you were right. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. In fact, I'm sorry about a lot of things. Hey! Coming back in a half an hour. I'll win back every penny. All right? London Underground asks that all passengers keep their belongings with them at all times. If any bags are left unattended they will be removed and destroyed. - Takes years of practice, of course. - Yeah, you should maybe be on the telly. - Yeah? - Yeah. Kate. Now, listen, I want you to do something for me. No, don't ask questions. Just listen. Get in the car, take the family, and get as far away from London as you can. I want you to drive as fast as you can. No, no, look, Dad... Dad's here with me at the Barrier. Don't ask questions, just do what I'm saying! Kate, listen, listen. Dad was right all along. Yeah. Goodbye. Track down the girls for me. They should be leaving the cinema now. - Penny, make sure you call home too. - Ma'am. It was my understanding... the emergency services would receive at least 12 hours' clear warning of a major flood alert. And we've had barely three. What the hell have you people been doing? When this gets out, there's going to be panic on an unprecedented scale. We have less than three hours before the surge hits the Barrier. How long can we keep the Underground running? We'll have to clear the lines an hour before the water hits. - But that only gives us two hours. - Less. To clear the tunnels by 6.20, London Underground have to start withdrawing services at five. That's an hour from now. Rush hour will have started. Look. Trains have to be run out to depots, staff pulled, stations closed. Fewer trains means we're shifting fewer passengers. Once word gets out, stations will fill with people trying to get out of London. The trains that do get through are gonna be full before they even reach most platforms. Right. I'm declaring a State of Emergency. (Woman) The Emergency Management Committee Cobra has... (Man) south of the River Thames.. are to be evacuated... - (Woman) the City of London. - Government advice urges those who... - (Sounds horn) - (Soldiers) Get back now! - (Sounds horn) - Get back! Get out of the way! Lads! Get back now! Back! high ground wherever possible. (Woman) Make your way to the nearest emergency exit.. .. to the lower pump room. Gotta change a circuitboard. - Initiate the gate closure now. - Right away, Sam. (Alarm goes off) (Alarm blaring) This way! (Alarm blaring) Tell Frank I'm heading down to the machine room now. (Alarm blares) Come on, Bill, where are you? I have to brief the Prime Minister so I need a status update. The Barrier has initiated closure, and evacuation procedures have been activated. But, sir... no population movement on this scale, in this time frame, has ever been attempted. We're dealing with millions of people. (Sirens wail) Leave this area Please make your way to higher ground.. If you live anywhere around a river area make your way to higher ground.. - Back! - (Shouting) (Siren) The space between the gate and the cill has reduced to 75 millimetres. We're right on target. - I couldn't get through to Kate. - I've spoken to her. It's all right. - Sam. - Yeah? We have to get these people out of here. Time's moving on. Frank and the boys are refusing to go. I'm not gonna leave without them. (Woman) Please make your way to the nearest emergency exit.. Please evacuate and make your way to the nearest emergency exit... We should get out of here. Please evacuate and make your way to the nearest emergency exit.. Please do as the soldiers ask.. Please do what the soldiers say.. It's going to be at least 45 minutes before all schools at risk in the zone have been cleared. That means we may not get to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in time. The patient population there approximately 2000. This came in a few moments ago, ma'am. The Suffolk coast... half an hour ago. Prioritise the schools. - Bloody hell! It's a mission getting down here. - Yeah. Nearly there. All right. Up you go then. - Why I got to go up? - I'm too fat. Sweet. Sweet, Bill. You do work here, don't ya? Oh! It's filthy up here, Bill. I know. Boss! You ought to look at these tidal gauge figures. Excuse me. Put me through to Commissioner Nash at Cobra. - Hello Sam. - Ma'am. We'we received some new information. The surge is growing in size and is travelling up the Estuary at a height of four to six meters. - How long have we got? - It's a matter of minutes before it hits us. Sam. Patch all video feeds from the Barrier through to us immediately. Oh, my God! - God. - Sir? (Alarm sounds) - I need to check on my crew. - I'll go. - I'll go with Frank. - No. - No time to argue. - Let's go. We need to relocate now. Sir? Please, God, they got out. (Screams) - (Rumble) - What's that? Let's get out of here! Frank! Oh, God. Oh, my God. - (Alarm blares) - (Electrical crackling) - We need to hurry up. - What about the others? My crew? What about Leonard? - We have to go up now. - No! Now! We have to go up now! No! (Tyres screech) Yeah, we're at Cobra 2. - Anything on the girls? - I've left messages on their phones. They'll be patched through to you the moment they call. Get me an update on the hospital and school situation as soon as you can. - Hey, did you hear that? - No, I don't hear anything, mate. Exactly. Hello, Control? Come in, Control. We need to get to a phone. Find out what's going on. I need to see what's happening out there! Come on! I need pictures! - Come on! We've got to get up to the bulkhead! - (Rumbling and creaking) Rob! Leonard! - Where's Frank? - Dad! You all right, Dad? Look! If we stay here, we're gonna die. - Come on, Dad. - No! No, I can't! I'm sorry, I can't! Sam! It's breaking up. We've got to jump. It's all right, come on. Trust me. We're gonna be all right. - One! - Rob, this is madness. Two! Three! - This was supposed to be instant plug and play. - We're almost there, ma'am. (Man) We've got it. Sir? Jesus. Can you get in any closer than that? - My God! Who's that? - Switch to night vision. - It's Professor Morrison. We need him here. - Let's get him here. All military aircraft are committed elsewhere. Well, then, requisition a civilian one! Top priority! Yes, ma'am. No. Morrison. What's happening? I want that Barrier signal back up! We need to see what's happening out there. Oh! Ah! Sam! Sam! - Sir, we've got it. - Good. Ma'am? Ma'am? You need to see this. (Moans) (Man) Cobra 2? Search and Rescue 4 I think we've found your stray. Steady! Here you go! Cobra 2? Search and Rescue 4. We're on our way. Wait... wait! No, tell him to wait! There are two more people down there! No. Please! My son's down there! He jumped! You've got to find him! No one could have survived that. I'm sorry. (Gasping) Sam! Sam! This way! This way! Over here! Over here! (Sobs) Do you think you can make it to the Dome? I don't know! It's all right! The current will take us! OK? I'll be right behind you. I'm gonna let you go. All right? Go on! - I need figures from Tilbury to London Bridge. - Commissioner? Commissioner? How do we stand at the moment? Sir, we're up against it. The scale of this thing, it's... - Even New Orleans can't compare. - Sir, we need to talk about this. - What? - I'm concerned about the security situation. Signing this will give the military certain powers. Limited powers, to overrule civil authorities during this State of Emergency. What? I must retain the authority to coordinate air rescue. I need to get thousands of civilians to safety, and I can't do that without military assistance. All transport, all vehicles, must remain under Cobra's command. We will work with Cobra, but I have to ensure the security of all rescue personnel, buildings.. - Of course. - With respect, everything, including security concerns, remains under the control of Cobra. Commissioner Nash is to be given full military cooperation in accordance with agreed protocol. - I'm not trying to change procedure. But if civilian unrest gets out of hand, I have to be able to react accordingly. Yes, but cooperation is what's needed if we're to save lives. You'll work under Cobra in all areas of the evacuation, reporting to Commissioner Nash. Is that agreed, Major General? Yes, sir. - Where's my liaison officer? - Behind you, ma'am. (Shouting) (Gasping and sobbing) Oh! Rob! (Bill) This is the old transformer for the Northern Line. Oh, that's not right. Climb to the top of here. See if we can't get out that way. Oh, a ladder. There's a pattern forming here, Bill. You know what? I think you might be one of them workplace bullies. - Not now, mate. - You might want to see someone about that. (Bill) OK, come on. - (Rattling) - No, it's locked. I am having serious second thoughts about all this. A young lad like me, stuck underground... with a bloke... like you. - Ma'am? - What? It seems the girls left you a message earlier. In the confusion we didn't get it. (Quietly ) They're meeting friends in town after the film. In town? But... they could be anywhere. I'll keep trying to get through to them. (Phone) (Ringing) (Beeps) Claire, it's me. This is officially my hundredth message. Just give me a call, darling, whenever you can. (Beeps) (Men) Get back! Get back! (Sirens wail) (Man) Come on! Come on! Lock your door! Shove off! - Open the door! - Shove off! (Screaming) - (Screams) - Hang on! Commissioner, we have to shut down the gas and electricity mains in Deptford, Kennington, Camberwell and Bermondsey. The hospitals can only run so long on backup gennies. We haven't got them all evacuated. It's that, or we could have another Fire of London on our hands. (Shouting) Whoa! I can't hold on! Aaah! (Sam screams) - Latest evac figures. - Status report on the Royal Family? They've been safely moved to Balmoral, ma'am. All right. Bullet points, please. We need to look at the time scale we're working to. Ma'am. There's no slowdown. The momentum of the surge is enough to keep the water coming. But the wind and the rain's adding to the problem. The Met storm forecast let us down completely. Is this data reliable? An event on this scale is... is practically unheard of. This is a thousand-year storm. This latest data feed is as accurate as can be. But I need to know what further collateral damage we can expect. If the surge maintains its current momentum we have, I don't know... an hour? Before most of Central London is underwater. Two at most. What can be achieved in two hours? No matter how fast we work, we're not gonna get everyone out. So we should concentrate our efforts on the key evacuation areas in the southwest. We should deploy the bulk of our troops and any available emergency service personnel here... agreed? But we'll be abandoning this corridor of people in the southeast, Bermondsey, Lewisham. - Given the speed this thing's moving, we have no choice. We have to prioritise. - Focus on the southwest, Mr Bullman. - Right. Next schedule briefing, 15 minutes. - The next press conference is scheduled... - Move it till later. (Roaring overhead) Sounds like they got the trains running again. Like no train I've ever heard. (Shouting and screaming) Shit. What is it? Is that from the Thames? - What is it? - I don't know. We got to go. - Go! - What is it? You're freaking me out! (Shouting and screaming) - Come on, Bill, run! - Christ! I'm running as fast as I can! Come on! (Creaking) Shit! Oh, my God! (Man) This is turning into one of the worst natural disasters ever recorded. More than 200000 people are still unaccounted for... and emergency services are stretched to breaking point. - The scale of the disaster - Professor! Are you all right? Patricia Nash. - Why have you brought me here? - We need your help, sir. My help? I need to find my son. There's not much you can do for him out there. Your best chance to help him is to help us. Hm. Your Barrier Breach model, we need access to it, and your projections for collateral damage. - They may not be relevant any more. - Of course they are. There are millions of lives still at risk. Oh... I need access to my database on the university server. If it's still up and running. - Can we get you anything, Professor? - I need to find my son Rob. He's the best marine engineer in the country. His company's under contract to the Barrier. - Samantha Morrison... - Is in charge of Barrier operations. - He'd head for Defiant. - Defiant? Defiant Engineering. Rob's company. It's not far from the Barrier but it's on higher ground. - There's just a chance they might... - If there's a chance, we'll find them. Commissioner? This may all be too late. But we have to try. Rob! Rob! (Woman) Help us! (Man) Help! Sam! (Man) Help! (Woman) Over here! - (Woman) Help! - Sam! (Woman) Over here. Help. You can't stay here! The only way out is up that way! I think we should stay here! If you don't move you're gonna die! Quickly! Come this way, quickly! Oh! (Rob) Go, go! Keep going! Keep going! The water's rising! - How long do you reckon? - About 20 seconds. Make that ten. Hurry it up! (Shouts) Open the door. Open the door! Come on, come on. - Put in the key! - OK! OK! Aaahh! - Bill! - Zak! - Zak! - Bill! This way. Easy. Careful, careful. That way. (Gasping and coughing) - You all right? - You OK? - Where did you lot come from? - It's a long story. - It was like a tidal wave! - A tunnel's collapsed! I'm afraid it's a lot worse than that. - Come on, we have to go! Run! - Let's go. (Rob) Let's go! Let's go! Run if you can. Come on! Quickly! - You OK? - Hey. Somebody's coming. Mind yourself there. - They work here. - Maybe they'll help us. - You OK? - Yeah. That's blocked. - I don't know. I'll go and have a look. - I tried it. OK. I'm having a look up there. Sam. Sam, wait up, wait up. (Bill) There's water coming in everywhere. We only just got away with our lives. The fire service guys have scoffed all the biscuits as usual, so I bought you these. Tea. Coffee. They're damn smart girls, ma'am. One variable can throw off an entire forecast. - Keith... - The worst storm in history and I got it wrong. Keith, don't torture yourself. We all got it wrong. People make mistakes everyday but... mine's gonna cost lives. - Maybe thousands of them. - You mustn't do this to yourself. No one could've predicted this, nobody. We've got to keep it together. We've gotta do what we can now. All right. Look. I think I've got a bit of a plan. If memory serves me, about on the other side, there's an air shaft. If it's not flooded we could perhaps get to ground level that way. During the Blitz, hundreds of people would come down here and use these as shelters, yeah? Government put up these massive steel blast doors, closed them in. Sealed them in from the explosives. There's gotta be one for this station. They're under something official, like a Tube map. If we can find it, get it closed, it could buy us enough time to get in that air shaft and get out, yeah? - Yeah. - All right. (Rushing water) Run! Run! This way, come on! Come on! Run! Keep going! Keep going! We've gotta find a latch or a handle or something! That's it! Give me a hand! Give me a hand! Come on! That's it! Go on, mate! (Bill) Get it closed! (Zak) Push it, Bill! It's coming again! - That's it! - Put your weight into it! Bill! (Screams) (Zak) Don't let go of me! (Bill) Zak! (Zak) Hold it open! (Rob) I can't! Don't let go! Now hold on! Bill! (Gasping) (Groans) (Sobs) - Hey, you all right? - Yeah. - I think I found a way out. - OK. So this must be what Bill's talking about. Where is Bill? Commissioner Nash. The latest indications are that the storm has turned. It's heading south. That's not the point. The crucial issue is when will the surge lose momentum. That's what I'm saying. No storm, no surge. A surge this powerful will maintain its own momentum, and for a long time. - What do you mean? - It could take out the rest of the city. We haven't seen the worst of it? All of those people at the safety points, including your rescue teams, are at high risk. Do you see that, Mr Hopkins? That's just two people. There are countless others depending for their next breath on the accuracy of your forecast, as are we. Keith. - You all right? - It's too high! - You'll have to climb. You're not safe here. - I really don't think I can do this. - You can do this. - Yeah, you're gonna be fine. - You will follow me and you're gonna be fine. - All right? All right. This is crazy. If one of us slips... By my calculations, the water will be six to eight feet deep here, here, but only one or two feet deep here, here,here. So these are the roads your people should be using to get survivors to Greenwich Park and other safety points. So these are our key evacuation corridors. But if these are our only access routes, land-based search and rescue in these other areas is gonna be well nigh impossible. I need more air support. All our air support is already deployed. Our pilots are massively overstretched. They're already flying longer than is safe or legal. My guys aren't overstretched. You can't expect miracles from us if this is all we've got to work with! Would you excuse me a moment? Johnson, take over. Hey! Keep your eyes on me. You're doing great. Look at me. We're doing well. I can see the end. What's going on? Zak! Zak! Zak! Give me your hand. Aagh! Take my hand. Grab it. (Grunts) (Man) Can you see anything there? - Phone. - I tried, the phone lines are down. - (Dialling tone) - Got a line. - (Dialling tone) - Oh, shit! Hello? Hello? Can you put me through to Cobra? Yeah. Can you repeat that? Yes, that's right. Put them straight through. We want to talk to them. Ma'am. I think you'll want to take this call. - Is it Claire and Emma? - Claire? I'm sorry? Yes, um... that's fantastic news. Hang on one second. There's someone here you should be talking to. I'll pass you over. It's for you. - Morrison here. Dad, it's you! Rob. Oh, thank God. Rob. Dad! I thought you were... I'm still here. I just can't believe it's you. Where... where are you? We're in central London, or what's left of it. - We? Is Sam with you? - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, she's here. Rob, I may need your help. Stay where you are. They'll be able to trace this call. I'll make sure you're both picked up as soon as possible. I can't tell you how relieved I am. Me too. I need to speak to Sam. Can you put her on? Yeah. Sam. Leonard! Oh, God, it's so good to hear your voice! - Sam about the Barrier... - What? - Do you think it's still operational? - Uh... Oh God, well, I can't imagine the Barrier is in very good shape. Is there any way we could open the gates manually? Well, yeah. No, no, you could override the auto setup. But I think access would be an issue. Sam. I think the Barrier is our answer. What's the problem? But we need to rendezvous at Defiant first OK. Although the surge is still ploughing its way upriver, if we lower the Barrier, the water upriver can drain into the Estuary. What we then need is a force which in effect increases the rate at which the tide ebbs. - Is that something we can create? - There may be a way. To stop the surge, I think we should open these sluice gates. Let the whole lot flush downstream. We'll need exact timings from the Met Office, so that the whole operation coincides with the ebbing of the tide. But if we open the sluice gates, wouldn't we be releasing even more water into the flood plain? Of course, but if you get the timing right, with the Barrier open, we'll have the water from the sluice gates counteracting the surge, and the outgoing tide pulling it back down the Estuary. Hopkins? Where the hell's Hopkins? I need him here. Get me the Waterways Manager. It's Commissioner Nash. (Footsteps) - Zak. - Yeah. We're gonna go now. I want you to stay and look after the others. OK? You'll be safe here. Someone will come soon. All right? Yeah. - Thank you. - No. Thank you. Sam. Sir. Safety points are filling up. We're running out of fresh drinking water. We'll need to requisition more transport within the next 30 minutes. Right, but make sure you coordinate with Ashcroft. Oh, I'm due to speak to the PM shortly. Do we know yet how many people didn't get out? The latest estimate is, um... 200,000, sir. (Sighs) It's Hopkins. - What about him? - His... body's just been found. What? How could... - I should have seen this coming. - Oh, no. I'm sorry. Oh... (Deputy Prime Minister) So we ask for your prayers... for those who are braving terrible conditions in a bid to save lives. This is just the start of a terrible day of reckoning for London. Rescue services are highly stretched and we have to face the consequences They're preparing us for the worst. Loss of life on this scale is something we've never experienced before in this city. I believe London will survive, and we will recover. Thank you. Jesus, they don't think anyone made it. It's not as if they're gonna be out looking for us. May I join you? Our only reason for being here is to save lives. God knows how many we've lost out there. we've failed... or I did. You've done everything humanly possible. Countless people owe their lives to you, including me. You've seen the pictures. Who could survive that? My girls are out there. I don't even know where they are. This all look s great, but in real life we're dealing with massive unpredictable forces. I don't care what your model says. There's no way we can predict what's gonna happen when these two bodies of water come together. It's a hell of a risk, ma'am. And the chances of it working out the way the professor think s it will, must be a million to one. - Leonard? I've taken all known variables into consideration including the issue of timing. I think my plan will work. Blind faith in computer models is what got us into this mess. - Ignoring computer models... - Please. What are the timing issues? Low tide at the barrier is 10.45 am. For this to work we have to open the sluice gates at precisely 9.15. The Barrier gates will have to be lowered before the sluice gate waters reach them. The Barrier is not currently operational. Yeah, but I've spoken with Samantha Morrison. There is a way of lowering the Barrier but we don't have much time. If the Barrier gates can't be lowered then the plan with the sluice gates won't work. We'd be gambling with millions of lives. So you're asking me to open the sluice gates, unleashing millions of gallons of water, before we know for sure whether we can lower the Barrier. How sure are you? I'm sending my son and daughter-in-law to the Barrier. Does that answer your question? I need to brief the DPM before we do this. Richardson? Ma'am. - (Samantha) How's it going? - All set. Anyway, I kind of, um... don't want us to be apart any more. Let's go. Dad! They found us! Help! (All) Help us! Help! Help! Help us! Makeshift messages on rooftops like this one here at Canary Wharf - are starting to appear all over London - Ma'am? This outlines manpower on the sluice gates. - 200000 people were still in the flood zone when the Thames reached its banks. Just when we thought that no one could have survived. thousands of people are holding up signs telling us they're alive. Tens of thousands of people still don't know where they'll be sleeping tonight But at least for now London can breathe a sigh of relief, as the monster surge that overwhelmed the city literally begins to drain away Help! Help! Sir? I need the go-ahead. We're running out of time. I've already spoken to the Prime Minister about it. But I need to know, is this our only option? I'm afraid so, or we do nothing. I'm sure you'll agree that is not an option. There's no guarantees that this will work but this is our only hope. - But the key thing is we... - Sir, we need a decision. With the high risk of failure, sir, we cannot take this action. Sir? We're out of options. We need to do this. (Leonard) Minister, I'll go to the barrier myself. Go ahead. Wait your turn. (Man) Please. Come on! Come on! All right! Keep moving! Move it. Move it. Move that way! - Ma'am! - What's the matter? The girls have been picked up by a mobile search and rescue unit. They're safe. Oh... Thank you. - I haven't lost my kids. - They're all that matter. It's good to see you, Dad. Let's go, let's go! Come on, get some effort in there. Put your back into it! Give him a hand on there, come on. (Nash) Commander Bryant, if we don't open the Barrier in time, our ability to manage this disaster will be nonexistent. - In 2 hours this control centre will be taken out. - I understand, ma'am. - Give me Professor Morrison. - Certainly, ma'am. Professor? - Commissioner? - Professor The surge is moving further inland. - Are you sure? - It shows no sign of stopping - Has Fuller downloaded the latest projections? - Yes. - We're counting on you, Leonard. - Understood. What we're trying to do is very dangerous. I'll take the risk, Dad. No one knows the Barrier like me. It's my job. I won't let anyone else take my place. Rob. - I know I haven't been much of a father. - Dad, don't. - I wasn't much of a husband either. - Dad, don't. It's obvious now why the work meant so much. I'm sorry I doubted you. This is where we are in the back-up control room. This is the room we need to get to. It houses the manual override which will allow us to drain the latch room. The problem is that this room will be flooded and there's a good chance that all these access routes are under water. What do you suggest? The sluice gates upriver have been opened. We're on a clock here. We need to drain the latch room to operate the hydraulics that will open the Barrier. Now, even if we do make it as far as the override room, the Barrier's anti-terrorist motors will activate and there will be no way back out. The drainage system is only operable when the room is sealed from the inside. Whoever goes into this room is gonna run out of air before the door can be re-opened from the other side. This is a death sentence. This is madness. We need a contingency if they don't succeed. What do you suggest? There is only one option, ma'am. The Barrier gates must be destroyed. - We don't have the authority. - I'll get it. Sam. I can't let you do this. Whatever happens on this Barrier is my responsibility. - I have to. - Sam, listen... This is no longer a civilian responsibility. As senior officer here it's my duty. I need you both here to operate the latch release. I've made my decision. Commander. You're a brave man but we both know it can't be you. - You don't know this Barrier well enough. - (Sighs) It makes sense. - Sam. - No. - Listen. - No, I won't. Why? You know why. He doesn't know enough to go down there. Rob, I'm asking you... It's our only choice. (Man) That means you maintain your formation... Prime Minister, all our aircraft are fully armed and fuelled. I must reiterate, time is of the essence. I don't need to be reminded of that. What is the status of the rescue operation at the Barrier? It's difficult to tell. We're having communication problems with the team on the ground. - That's all we need. I don't want our handling of this crisis to come under any more question. We are monitoring it minute by minute. Major General, your aircraft are to remain on the ground at the present time. Deputy Prime Minister, get me a reason to delay this. No, don't. (Klaxon sounds) Dad! (Klaxon sounds) Dad! - (Knocking) - Open the door! Open the door! Dad! Commissioner, the Prime Minister for you. - Prime Minister. - Commissioner, I need an update. Surge waters are continuing to work their way up stream. Their momentum has slowed but we have major damage and further potential loss of life... at Chelsea, Clapham, Hammersmith and Putney. And the sluice gate waters to combat this surge? Current estimates suggest the confluence between the sluice gate waters and the surge in less than 30 minutes. It's not enough Commissioner You're giving me very few options. Ma'am. Commander Bryant's on the line from the Barrier. - Good. - Signal's been patched here. - Commissioner Nash, are you receiving me? - Yes. Yes. We're under pressure from the Prime Minister and the military. Unless you can give me something concrete, we have less than ten minutes before aircraft are ordered to take off and destroy the Barrier. Ma'am, Professor Morrison is currently trying to engage the manual override system. He may need more than ten minutes. - I need an exact time. - I can't be more precise. - You don't know when he'll be back? - Buy me all the time you can. Professor Morrison won't be coming back. OK, let's go. Help me prime these gates. Pull down, and up. We've begun priming the gates. As soon as it's completed I can open the Barrier. - ( Nash) Sam - Two minutes. - The Prime Minister. - Hang on one moment. I'm through to the Barrier. They have to prime the gate before it can open. Prime Minister, we need to get the aircraft to the Barrier now. We're running out of time. Good God! (Ashncroft) We need a decision Major General, you have my authority to destroy the Barrier. (Nash) What!? We have a go. You're clear for takeoff. (Man) We're clear for takeoff. Sam, you all have to get out of there now. It's too late ma'am. We're gonna finish this. - Come on. - It's only a matter of minutes. (Rob) That's it. Follow me. Ahh! (Rapid beeping) OK. (Pilot) Cobra 2, we're minutes away from the Barrier. (Beeps) (Klaxon) Commissioner Nash, status report. - Bear with me a few moments, Prime Minister. (Klaxon) - Barrier. - Sam. - The gates are opening! They've done it. - The gates are opening. - Stand them down, Ashcroft. - Abort. I repeat, abort. (Pilot) Disengage! Abort! Abort now! Oh... - Stand back there, please. - Stand back. (Laughter) (Helicopter blades whir) (Whispers) Thank you. He left you this. He loved you. I'm sorry, Dad. Take my father home.
