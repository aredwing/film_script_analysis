 

                        Ladies and gentlemen, this next race is a claiming race for $6,500 for three-year-olds and up. The pacers are approaching the starting line, and they're off. It's Golden Girl going to the front... They got a few pieces down, but no craps. B.J., crib, some wheels. But the Rabbi's with it, so you'll be pitching right out of the synagogue. Maybe they'll make you honorary Jew, hmm? Well, you get a day's pay out of it, but you're gonna have to deal from the shoe. We used to have three spots a night. Now I get a $5.00 and $10.00 poker game 'cause these fucking casinos got the entire planet broke. Everything is comped with these fuckers. You know, we could take them off at the crap table. Take 'em off? The casino? Huh? There are mirrors on every table, spotters all over the place. Fucking eye in the sky, every 12 feet apart. What are you gonna take, a walk around the block? Come on. You know my move. I know you got a great move, but the casinos put something in the craps so that nobody can switch 'em. Well, how come I never heard of that? It's a federal beef, Joe. You know, bumps did a three and change for going against the casinos. It's still on paper. Look, I got to go. I got to go. My daughter's in town. Oh, don't worry. Don't worry. I'll find something, ok? What about your kid? Uh, I don't know. I don't know. All right. Well, take care of yourself. Well, you want odds on that come back? No more bets. Swing shift. Table 6. They're going in and out. Looks ok. She in the book? Yeah! Ok. All right. Here we go. Here we go. Want a 4? Look. They're out again. Right there. Yeah. Go. You've been made. Excuse me? What are you talking about? Excuse me. Hold the dice, please. Excuse me. Could you come with us, please? Why? Tell 'em to grab the beard, too. - You too, sir. - Me? Absolutely. Right now. Take your chips. Let's go. That's ok. We won't be long. I didn't do-- Sorry, guys. Um, ok. Uh, I'll be back. Gonna take 'em to DGE. We got her. Come on. Miss, have a seat. Were you cheating? - What? I-- - Were you cheating? I-- I-- Jeez. I'm a cosmetics distributor. - Yeah, I bet you are. - I-- I am. Find table four. Zoom in on section three. Now look, Miss, this would all go a lot smoother for you and... your man if you just come clean. What? I don't even know him, ok? - You don't? - No, I don't. Look, look, I come here all the time and nobody bothers me, all right? This is-- this is ridiculous. It is. Look. Look, I'm not upset. I just want to get out of here, all right? Get the hammer. A hammer? N-no. This is insane. - I want a cop here now. - Oh, really? Yeah. All right, play it. All right, freeze it. What are you doing there? - Um... - Sit down. Uh, ok. I'm getting my makeup out. What, I-- I can't do that or what? Where's the dice? I don't know what you're talking about. Lady, we know our equipment. Where the fuck are the dice? I don't... Hammer, take a look at this. They went out on her roll. Any big winners at the table? You find anything on her? What about this guy? You know him? I've seen him before. How ya doin'? Yeah, how ya doin'? Hey, how's it going? - Let me see your hands, Honey. - Yeah, sure. Mm-hmm. Where's the dice? I don't have any dice. - I know you don't. - I don't. Rouge. Rouge? W-what does that mean? It means that, without any money lost, anything found on them, no harm done. That's very cute. See, my bosses are bean counters. They need proof. I don't, though. I don't give a fuck what you do out on the street. Don't fuck with me. Take your shit, get the hell out of here, and don't come back. Get her out of here. - I'm filing a complaint. - You do that, sweetie. Yep. And you... maybe it's a fluke, you come running up like the white knight at the last second, but I doubt it. Been in the game too long. Consider yourself the luckiest man in Atlantic City. Now fuck off. What's with this rouge? It's talc and oil. The eye sees it as ultra-red. Shoots the back of the second mirror. That's why we couldn't see through it. - Well? - Well. Stanley was right. They're marking the dice. Yeah? You see it? Yeah, I saw it. That's just terrific because I'm not used to getting treated like that, you know? Come on, Jan. How was I to know they were gonna back-room us? - Oh, you knew. - I didn't know. - You fucking knew. - No, I didn't know. Come on. Stanley said they were marking the dice, so I figured you smeared them up a little bit, you know, make a few false moves, get a reaction. I mean, the worse that could happen was they ask us to leave, which they eventually did. - No. They kicked us out, remember? After they snapped our pictures. Don't you think they're gonna pass those pictures around to the other casinos on the boardwalk? No, they don't need to. I mean, they got us on tape. Oh, really? That's-- that's just great. So this casino thing, is it over or what? - Oh, no, no. It's not over, no. - Great. - Come on, Jan. - Uh-huh. What are you worried about? There's nothing to worry about. - Come on, Honey. - Don't "Honey" me. Wayne. Yeah, it's Joe. Yeah, the results come in from Belmont yet? Ooh. No, no, no. I couldn't make it last night. Uh, what's the spread on Boston? No, no, it's too high. No. All right. I'll call you back. Jeff. Hey. It's Joe. Yeah, what are you showing on Boston? No, come on. You keep moving it around. There's no room there. I'll tell you what, you know what? Give me the Knicks plus 7 1/2 for a dime, and give me, uh... give me Buddy's Revenge in the late-night double. $50 box. Yeah. You know what? I got a call. All right, I got to go. I'll call you back. All right. Bye. Hello? Hey, Irene, yeah. How you doing? Yeah. All right. Yeah, I'll be there tomorrow. Yeah. Bye. He participates. It's not that. They all love him. He's always been a model client. Then what is it? Well, as you know, he's very high-functioning. He reads, he writes, he has excellent comprehension. It's just that his mood swings are intense. Irene, what did he do? It's not just one incident. His whole attitude is becoming more and more hostile. In the 12 years that he's been with us, he's never used profanity like this. You know what? I'll donate more, whatever it takes to get over this. Oh, no, no, no. It's not a question of money. He turns 21 in three weeks. He's got to move on. You need to come and pick up your son next Wednesday morning. I can't take him with me. That's impossible. I'm a salesman. I'm on the road constantly. You know that. That's good. Joe loves to travel. He takes the buses, the subways, everywhere by himself. Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I should take him to work with me? He can't stay here. He attacked an employee. We have a no-tolerance rule against that sort of thing, and I'm gonna tell you right now, so will that group home. All right. What happens if I don't take him? Well, then I am gonna have to refer you to some state-run facilities. Come on, Irene. You know what those places are like. You would do that? I'm not the one who makes that decision. Well, isn't there another place until he's ready for the group home? Well, there's the Golden Angels. It's a private facility in Greenburgh, but it's expensive. All right. How much? It's a great deal of money, Joe, Plus there's a lot of red tape involved. You mean tax forms, work stubs, all that nonsense? The whole 9. Look, the logical place for Joe is the group home. It's where he belongs. He'll get a job and he'll live productively. That's all I want. Well, good. If you take him now, he'll see what it's like to be with family. And in 6 months, you can reapply for the next transitive training session. In 6 months? You're killing this kid if you put him with me for 6 months. He was supposed to enter the program in three weeks, but he's simply not ready. Let's go, let's go. Concentrate. Joe Duma's the winner! If you can get him to agree To go into the group home on his own And stop the cursing and fighting within the next three weeks, I'll take another look. All right. There it is. He got it. Hey, what, do you got a little hand action going back there? All right. Whose deal? My deal. Come on, ante up. What time did that fuck say he's getting back? Why don't you just deal the damn cards? I'm waiting on him same as you. All right. One for you, one for you. One for little boy blue, and there and there and there. Ok, I bet that. Yeah, I--I'm in. I'm out. I'll raise. There's 14 and change in the pot. You can go all in. You know that? Hey, this game's pot limit, not table stakes. I can go in my pocket. You're betting into trip 10s. You got to have three kings full. I don't have three kings full. Really? No guts, no glory. I'll call. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to bet the pot. I'll call. Aces full. You played that hand to catch an ace? There was only two out. They were both in my hand. You said you didn't have a full house. All the years I've been playing cards, I never seen a hand played like this. I think there's something going on over here. Something funny's going on. I think there's something funny going on here! You want your money back? Huh? You shuffled the cards. You dealt them. I can't help it the way they turned out. That's why they call it gambling. You don't like it, take your money back. Go ahead. Take it back. You're pretty good, my friend. Lyin', fat fuck. Hey, hey! What the hell you doing? Joe, not for nothin', but how'd you get him to deal the cooler? I didn't see nothin'. Got to keep your eyes on me. I'm a little fast. Let me show you something. Oh, Gee. Huh? On the cut, baby. I came in on the cut. Double George. What'd I tell you? You see that? He's the fucking best. Did you see me give him the "what do you do," huh? Oh, yeah, real good. Ha ha ha ha! You're my hero. That's it. Come on. Let's all take a bet. All right, I'm clean now. Oh, he's clean. Ha ha ha! It's a nice suit. It's white. Yeah, I can see that. You know, I'm sorry I haven't been around much. Been having to travel. Work things. I got your letters, though. Thanks. I'm not much of a letter writer. Don't worry. You'll be back with your friends before you know it. I can go back there? Well, I mean to the new place. I'm not going there. Listen, kid, you're going to go, ok? Let's not talk about it now, but let's be realistic here. I know a girl. Oh, yeah? She's pretty. Is that a fact? She likes me very much. Well, who could blame her, you know, a nice boy like you? She showed me her clit. It's pink and sensitive, and sometimes it hides on you and you have to find it with your tongue like this. Great. All right. Let's go inside. Come on. We have a pitching game here in the middle of the 9th. Got a tie ball game... Hey. Heh! How's my robe? It itches. It itches? Come here. Come here. Roll here. Come on. You got to keep your eyes on me. I'm a little fast. Let me show you something. All right, here. Watch this, here. All right. This is called a Fast Jack move. - Fast Jack. - Fast Jack. Here's what we do. All right. You see that? They're pulling 6. You gonna fade to 6, right? We're gonna fade to 6. Who else wants to bet? Anybody else want to bet? - They were red. - That's right. They were red. Now look at them now. They're white. You see that? You like that, huh? See, I use the two different colors. This way I could watch the switch. I could watch if there's any leaks involved. See what I'm saying? Why don't you try it? Go ahead. All right, just-- all right. That's it. All right, yeah. Easy with the money. Put the money down. Just roll the dice. That's it. All right. So, Joey, um, you know, they said that-- Miss Santini says you're giving them a hard time over there. Yeah? Anybody bothering you there? - No. - No? They're my family. They're your family? All right. And what about the guys you live with? I mean, uh, huh? Are they nice guys? - Yeah. - Yeah. Um, but, J-Joe, you can't keep-- Just stop for a second. Look, look. I spoke to Miss Santini, and she says that if you keep cursing and fighting, you see, they can't let you in the group home, ok? I'm not going there! No, what do you mean, not going there? - Look look, look. You got to go there, ok? - No. - Listen to me. You'd be on your own. - No. You're gonna make new friends. It's gonna be really nice-- I said no! Joe! Joe! Come back here! Joe! What the hell is wrong with you? Get inside. Joey! Hey! Hey! What the hell is wrong with you, huh? Nice people don't act this way. That's right. Stare at me. Go ahead. Stare in these eyes and see how much I like this. You are gonna learn whatever the hell they want you to learn, And you are gonna go wherever the fuck they want you to go, because it's gonna be them or me, and it ain't gonna be me. I'm sorry, ok? I didn't mean it like that. Look, I know I wasn't there and all, But I was a phone call away, ok? Your mother wasn't there either. My mother's dead! Your mother's not dead, and stop saying that, all right? Just stop saying that. Listen to me. She took off, ok? What was I gonna do, huh? Hands off, fruity pebbles. Look, I don't even know what to say to you anymore, all right? What do you say maybe I get you tickets to, like, some wrestling matches. How's that? Ok? I wrestle Greco-Roman. Tomorrow, I tell you what, I'll take you somewhere nice. Nice? Yeah. You like nice, right? Come on. Come on. Let's-- everybody likes nice. Come on. Come on. How you doing, guys? - Hi, fellas. - Hey! Yeah. Hey, Stan. Hey, Joe. Hey, this is Joe. That's my kid. I'm making belly strippers for 30 years. Some half-ass hustler is gonna score big with this paper, and me? I get $12 a deck. Well, I've heard it before, Stanley, ok? Hey! Get away from there, please. All right, just... it's ok. Just tell Stanley you're sorry, all right? Tell his mother to go eat a bowl of cocks! My mother has been dead for a very long time, kid. Let's dig her up and fuck the skeleton. Oh, shit. I'm sorry, Stanley. I like him. Listen to me. Listen to me, ok? You can't talk like this to people, all right? You're not a kid anymore. Just sit down. Listen, I need a full line of tops for the bait tomorrow. What do you need? and do me a favor. Would you give me the sand finish? You know, the polished ones are too slippery. Yeah. In the cabinet. Joe, I think I found something. Two guys out of Miami. They got a ton of money. Perfect for the turn. Listen, every time you want to do something like that, you know what happens, you know? These double-cross moves always come back to haunt you. Joe, listen to me. These guys are rank suckers. They go off big in Vegas. We can take down some serious numbers here. Yeah? Well, you know what? I don't mind robbing these guys. I don't mind robbing anybody, but I don't do it with my mouth. I do it with my hands, all right? I'll get that move. Yeah, someday, huh? See these, kid? These are tops, ok? You know why they call them tops? They got no 5s, they got no 3s, and no Aces. You see? We get away with it Because you only see three sides of the cube at once. See that? Here. I'll give you $20 If you can make a 7 with these. I think you're making a big mistake here. Maybe. No, no, not maybe. Definitely. Maybe we can go another way. What do you mean? The casinos in Atlantic City, What do they use to make the dice glow, make the 7 light up? Black light gel. But you need an ultraviolet lens or filter to see it. You know, like the eye in the sky. Kid, come on, please. Please stop that. Can you get me any of that stuff? All right, forget it. You know what? What do I owe you for the tops? Ah, we're even. Joe! Please. It's ok. Let him have it. Go ahead. All right, come on. Here. I'll give you $20 for trying to make the 7. I didn't make the 7. That's ok. Come on, let's go. I'm sorry about the kid, you know. He's, uh-- I-- - See you later. - Bye. Just a sec! Hey! This is Big Joe. Hey, Big Joe. I'm Janice. Hi. - Hi. How you doing? - Good. We got some stuff from Gino's. Great. Come with me. Janice, this is a very beautiful house. Oh, thank you. I have to use the bathroom. Oh, yeah, sure, sweetie. Just straight down there. Dad, I'm using the bathroom. All right. Go ahead. So what's the problem? I need you to help me do something, all right? I got to convince this kid to get into the group home. Well, I don't know what the big deal is. He seems very sweet to me. - Sweet? - Yes, sweet. Sweet? He ran out in the street naked, he beat the shit out of an orderly, and then he told Stanley to eat a bowl of cocks. It's not funny. No. Well, Stanley needs to eat a bowl of cocks. Listen to me. I am stuck with this kid for 6 months if I don't get him into that home in a few weeks, ok? It's not the end of the world. Joe, it's-- What's your address here? It's 1524 Pelham Manor. Excuse me. You come sit down and eat right here in the chair of honor. Want a breadstick? Yeah. Let me serve you some... Oh. This is my high school grad ring. See? Hey. Hey, you. Uh-uh. You know, your father tells me that you'll be graduating soon from that place where you live. Yeah! Come on, hurry up and eat. Chasing the shots is running tonight. Well, I don't think I can make it tonight. What? Are you kidding me? I've been waiting He's a mudder and it's gonna rain. Well, the problem is you make grocery money and I blow the whole bankroll. So who says you have to bet on every race? Dad. I can't bet one race. I'm broke. Dad! What? There's this guy and he went to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have good news, I have bad news. The good news-- the bad news is you have cancer and you're gonna die. But the good news was the nurse in the hall... Um...the bad news was the nurse in the hall--" No, that's the good news. Yeah. "The nurse in the hall... I'm fucking her!" Yeah, "I'm fucking her!" He's a character. # if you want to see her # # tell her that you aren't very far away # # oh oh oh # # we can't complicate it # # make sure we say it # # we have a love we can't betray # # I'm gonna find my way to get to you # # and make our dreams come true # # the road ahead of us isn't far # # ahh ah ah... # Hey, Joe, want to bring that music down? Come on, give me a break. # you know I need you, you know I love you # Hello? Mr. Duma, it's Irene Santini. Hello, Irene. I just want to let you know That I spoke to the administrators at the group home and they've done everything they can, but their quota is filled, so it's not possible to take Joe Junior on, not in the time that we discussed. What? I'm sorry. I mean, come on, Irene, he's doing so good. He's not cursing or anything. The filing is done and it's too late to begin the process. You told me three weeks, so what do I do now? The next session for the group home begins in the fall. I told you, I can't keep him here that long. At this point, there is simply no other option. All right, what about that place we talked about, that Golden Gates or something. Oh, you mean, the Golden Handle? Right. Like I mentioned, it is a great deal of money. What about if I'm willing to pay the whole thing in one shot, you know, for the year? If that's what you really want to do, then I will pass on my recommendation, and I'm sure that it will help. Yeah. All right, thanks. # used to be all by myself # # I needed someone else # # to give me... # You know, they grabbed my picture at the casino. Janice's too. They got us on tape. That's how you discovered the gel, huh? What were you, playing to smear? Ah, you know, it don't matter. They got you on tape, you're fucked. They got us on tape doing nothing. Janice was just picking up the dice and throwing it. That's it. The tape could prove that. You know, and I could walk into any casino I want. I just can't take down the money. Joe, you're not thinking about going back to Atlantic City, are you? No, I'm not going to Atlantic City. I'm going to Vegas. Vegas? That's a whole other ball of wax. Security in Vegas is 10 times tougher than A.C. That's right. And if A.C. has it, you can bet that Vegas had it first. You better believe it. So if we're gonna make a move, I say we make a move in the spot where we can grab the most money, and that's Vegas. Move? What move? Even if you can get the dice into the game, how are you gonna get them back out again, huh? A table gets hot, every rat spotter and high-line surveillance device is gonna be on you. And on top of that, they got cameras, they got tape everywhere. No one can overcome that. No one. Look, Joe, Joe. Why are we fucking around here? Why don't we just turn these two schmucks from Miami? It's a sure thing. We don't have to take any chances. It's not a sure thing. And I need money now. You get me that black light gel and I'll come up with something. All right. Here we go, my boy. You stick with Teddy, you'll learn plenty. Your daddy's got a set, let me tell you, monkey balls. You're gonna knock all five of these levels into the game in one shot. Uh, levels or fronts are square dots, which means there's nothing wrong with them. We got to get them in so your daddy can match them up with the tops. And the tops is what gets us the money. We just got to dirty them up. Come on. Now shake 'em up. Shake 'em up real good. Yeah, real good. Come on. That's good. Now, you see, now they look more like the one's they're using. Who's got the rest? All right, come on. I'm laying it down. I'm laying it. Come on, I'll lay 150. Come on, put it down. Bring it there. Clean it up, boys. I'm laying he ain't making it. Come on, who wants a lay in? You're laying 120. Well, look who's here. It's aces full. Hey, Mickey, where you at? I hope you brought your checkbook. I'm just jocking, just jocking. What you doing here? Me? What the fuck are you guys doing here? I bought a row of tickets from Benny. I do it every year. Got to support the locals. Benny who? You guys want to dance, go find a dance floor. I'm here to play dice, ok? Who's in the middle? There's 100 open. Let's go. Yeah, I'm a really good dancer. I know you are. - Who's he? - That's my son. Looks just like you. That's me. 7 away. All right, come on. All right, there's 300 in. I'm good. Let's go. I'm in for 100. I'm laying in. Let's go, let's go. Come on. All right. Come on, come on. Let me have the dice. Ok. All right. You ready? Coming now. Come on, baby. 6. Ok, here we go. Here we go, here we go. Smack 'em, guys, smack 'em. I'm laying 200. Ok, put it down. Here we go. Get out of here, will you? Get him out of here. That's money. Winner, gentlemen! A winner! He may be fat and ugly, but he sure can throw them bones. $200 coming out. Come on, I got 200 coming out. You want to change this for me? Come on, come on. Don't hold me up here. Give me the dice. Let's go. This guy's got bad dice. What? What are you talking about? Let's see your pockets. Get your fucking hands off me. This guy's got extra dice on him. What are you, fucking crazy? I'm out of here. He's a cheat and these other guys are with him. Yeah, I'll bet he's afraid to go to sleep at night thinking somebody's going to steal his shoes. Shut up! I got nothing in my pockets, fellas, all right? Nothing's here. Look. See the rabbit ears? Nothing there, including my money. If somebody's cheating here, I want my money back. This guy cheated me once before. I ain't gonna let you get away with it this time. You know what, don't you coat it for me. All right? I came here, I lost my money, now I want out. Ok, I'm outta here. You ain't goin' nowhere. Yaaah! Hey! Come on. Let's get him out of here. Joe Duma's the winner! Who's this belong to? Come here. The retards like the zoo. All right. Break it up. Game is over. Everybody go home. - You ok? - Yeah. Yeah. What the fuck was that all about? I don't know. I got made going into my pocket. Fucking Tom is still steaming from the cooler hand. Should have just brushed. We got us an awful lot of man here. That damn knocker didn't know what hit him. Yeah. That's right, Teddy. Encourage him, ok? Encourage him. This is the kind of shit that got him tossed out of that spot in the first place. Here, Fitz. Take this. What the hell is the matter with you-- attacking this guy? You know you're not supposed to put your hands on anyone. You know that! I told you: Nice people don't act this way. Now get in the car, Joe. I wish you were dead instead of ma! Hey, hey. Don't say that. - I said get in the car. - Don't say that. - I'm going home! - What home?! You got no home, kid! That place is done with you. It's over. Now get in the fucking car! Fuck your mother! Joe, Joe! No good here! I fucked yours. I fucked yours and look what happened! Huh? Look what happened when I fucked yours! Come on. Joe. Calm down. Calm down, calm down. Come on. Come on. I'll take care of him. I'll take him home. Calm down. Calm down. Come on. God! God! You ready up those Miami guys. - All right. - I am done with this kid! You got it. Get in the car. Go home. How did you get here? You take the New Haven line to new Rochelle, Mamaroneck Road, and then you walk four blocks and you catch the number 35 to new Main Street and you walk the rest of the way. Oh. You know, you could have called me. I would have come and got you. Back in the bunk-- that's where I live-- I named it that, 'cause it sounds cool. Now everybody names it that. My friend Brian-- he can only take the bus when he's with me. 'Cause they all trust me there. And I'm never late. My friend Brian had reconstructive surgery on his eyes and his lip. He's still ugly. You really like it where you live, don't you? - Yeah. - Yeah. In the morning, in my room, when the sun comes up a certain way, my face looks good. Oh, I think your face is beautiful. All the time. I hurt someone today. I hit him good. - He tried to hit my dad. - I know. I know. He told me what happened, and you were very brave-- you were. But I just don't think it's a good idea to hurt anyone, no matter what. I'd do it again. I'll do it again if they make me go to that place Where no one comes back from. You know what? Maybe the reason no one comes back from there is because, I don't know, 'cause they like it so much. Right? You know, your father really cares about you. He's just-- He just has a hard time showing it sometimes. Does he care for you? He told me about your wrestling medal. Yeah. He did. He came right to the racetrack and showed it to me. You should-- I'm telling you, you should have seen his face When he was bragging about you, how you won. First place-- was, the second class division? - Middleweight. - Middleweight. That's what I meant. I have very powerful legs. Yes, you do. Yonkers Joe's not much of a letter writer. I know, and he can be a jerk sometimes. I know. But it's just because-- because he's different From a lot of people, you know? A lot like you. Do you understand that? Hmm? I have a very good build. Oh. Oh, you do. I'm gonna have to contain myself. I'm gonna go get you a pillow and blanket, and you are gonna stay right here tonight. Ok. Go 8! Go 8! Janice, I won! oh... See? You should have done some reading about tactics. Bet to win and what happens? - We won. - Yeah. We won. - I'm gonna get my money. - All right. You know where to go? Hey, Joe. Joe. Let's go. Come right back. Bye, sweetie. He's been doing better, don't you think? Yeah. Listen, thanks for coming down, you know? The kid really likes you. Sure. No problem. Stop worrying. He'll be fine. Oh, goody, your shadow. You didn't tell me he was gonna be here. Hey, Joe. - Hey. We were just bragging about you. This is Bam and Dino from New York, but they live here now. Good to meet you. Dino, this is my wife Janice. How you doing, Janice? Good. How you doing? These guys, they did some business with Carmine in Yonkers. Yeah. We were supposed to be a part of those British junkets to London. - Missed a hell of a score. - Heh. I know all about it; you're top of the line. We heard what you did in Gibraltar too. They actually signed the casino over to you? It was hardly a casino. You know, we've been around the counters for years, you know. Bam here fucks with those snappers himself. Is that right? I can hold up a crap. I got a little bum shot going. Ooh. That'll get the money. Listen, you guys are serious about this? They just need a few details, Joe, that's it. Yeah. We're not 100% convinced about the eye in the sky. Now, how are you gonna block that, even for a second? I'm not. I want the eye watching me. I want them all watching me. This way we don't have to worry about a blow. Watch. Do it again. Fuck! Hey, I'm looking right at 'em. I--I don't see anything. That's a good switch. - But where's the leak? - Leak? Leak? Every move has a leak. You know, an angle where you can see the other dice in your hand. There is no other dice in my hand. That's impossible. It's on the back of your palm. Uh. Uh. I spilled. Hi! I'll talk to you guys later. I'll see you upstairs, ok? Can't talk here. I gotta go. I'll meet you guys back in the club house, all right? Joe, hold on. Spilled? He's just pulling your prick a little. Hey, Joe. What, they got hot horses? They're all hot to Joe. I won. I was number 8. Congratulations, son. Hi! I won. - Joe. Joe. Hey, Joe. Hold on. Hold on. My dad--he lost, but I bet three... Here's the works. It's a dead ace-deuce splitter. - Perfect. Joe, can we--? Listen. Man! - What? - I couldn't get the black light gel. - What? Listen, man. Let's be realistic. We have a better shot at moving tops on the president Than beating a casino. Now, listen, we can turn these guys. They know you're capable. All you got to do is show them the way. - All right? - Yes. - All right. - All right. Ok. Yeah. - All right. Let me get my kid, all right? - Yeah. I won. Can I have my money? I--I had three bets. I was number 8. Joey. Hi. Heh. Hi. Come here. It's ok. Come on. Come here. What the hell is the matter with you? - I won. - Come on! Let's go! - I won the money. - I know you won. A lot of people won. Ok? A lot of people win with this. What are you doing in there? - I won! - Ok. That's only for the owners and the jockeys. You cash the tickets up there. Come on. It'll be all right. Just come on. Hurry up. Hey. Is he ok? Yeah. He's ok. Hurry up. Come on. I got to put that bet in, ok? - Joe? - Come on. This horse! I got to bet it now. Come on! You want to tell me what's going on? - Just come on! - Aw, jeez. Come on, Janice. I don't want to get shut out, all right? I only got one play today and this is it. Ok. Fine. Just tell me what's going on. These two guys from Miami, you know? They're half-assed hustlers. They think they're with it. They don't even know they're alive. Come on. Stanley wants to put 'em through, you know? Come on. Let's move here, please. Cut the crap, ok? What? All right, Joe. Look. That's where you cash your tickets, right over there. Go over there, cash your tickets. Ok? Go ahead. And then come right back here. Come right back when you're finished, ok? Look, Stanley wants to turn these guys, Janice. That's why we're down here. "Turn"? What does that mean? He wants to take 'em to Las Vegas, you know, play it on the square. Use their money. Take a shot with it. Well, why would you do that? Well, why not? They think I'm gonna move loaded dice to the game. We told them up front, "you could still lose with loads. there's no guarantee." Meanwhile... I pretend to move. We use their money. Right? If we win, great. - If we lose, it doesn't cost us nothing. - Wait wait wait. Pretend to move? I don't get it. What advantage does that give you? You'll be gambling on the square. Wouldn't you want someone to give you - 100 large to Gamble with? - Yeah. I mean, 'cause that's what they're coming up with-- 100,000. But it still doesn't mean you're gonna win. You know, this is ridiculous. If these sick degenerates didn't have to bet every horse in the goddamn race, I could've been down by now. Just tell me what's going on. No more bets. Do you believe this? Huh? That's 'cause everybody's gotta bet every horse. Hey, hey. Joe. Joe. Come on. Look, Stanley will go off with half that bankroll in chips if the dice don't go our way. We will get the money. What happened to you do it with your hands, not your mouth. What happened to that? You know what, Janice? I don't like it, either. But I'm tired of the whole thing, you know, and I'm tired of Stanley; I'm tired of these guys. And you know something else? - We're not qualified to take care of the kid. - Shh! Can I tell you something? Can I? - Yeah. - Just one thing. You're full of shit. - Did you get your money? - Yeah. $20! # there's just one place for me # # this is it # # yeah, just one place to be # # this is it # # I'm so happy to be here # # when I look around it's clear # # yes, it's perfectly plain to see # # there's the cream of the crop # # this is it # # on my list at the top # # this is it # # couldn't ask for nothin' more # # like a home that I Adore # # if there's one place I fit, this is it. # Come on. Welcome to the grand plaza. There's no obligation to buy. Your prints will be at the counter. Honey, we'll take our own pictures, ok? Thank you. Holy shit. These guys must really want to impress you, huh? Yeah. It's all right. Ha ha! More than all right! Whoa. Thanks for helping out with the kid. Yeah. You mentioned that already. Viva Las Vegas! Whoo! Hey, suckers! Whoo! Hey, Teddy. Do you know they've been together for 20 years? Who's that, my man? - My balls. Hey, that's pretty good, kid. I gotta remember that. So... what do you think of these egg rolls? Not much. What? There's nothing for me. Oh, God. Give me that. Lookit here. These egg rolls. These egg rolls has dropped from a $40,000 allowance to a claimer. He should win going away. - Yeah. - Yeah. He's also the favorite, got the best weight, the fastest time, and everybody's picking him. - That's right. - Can't possibly win. Oh, God. You are the worst handicapper I know, you know that? What do you wear that for? - I don't know. 'Cause I like it. - Yeah? 'Cause I like you. - Hey, Jan. - Yeah? Remember those monitors at Atlantic City? Yeah. Why? The camera. I could get in so close to the shooter that I could actually see the dice in their hands. Right? I mean, but how could the camera stay on everybody at the table at the same time? - If the person-- - Wait, wait, wait. Could we just talk about something else, please? This is important, Janice. Like what? Like, I don't know. How about your son? Yeah. What about him? Well, ok, I-- I think it would help him if he knew that you cared about him, you know? So he could do well at that group home. They're not gonna let him in the group home. What do you mean? Why not? Red tape bullshit. I don't know. I spoke to the woman that runs the place. You know, she told me about a spot that-- it's like the Taj Mahal for kids like this. It's very expensive. That's why we got to make this score, Janice. Wait, wait, wait. You don't got to put him in that place. Listen... has it really been all that bad? You know, the time he's spent with us? Why don't you just let him stay awhile? I-- I'd help you out. I would. You want to get realistic here, Janice? Why? He's your fuckin' son. I mean, he's your blood. What's more realistic than that? You believe in God? What? Do you believe in God? - Yeah. Why? - Yeah. Well, so do I. Nancy and I were young and healthy. She was pregnant. I don't care what the doctor said. You know, I didn't push her; she fell. 'Cause we were going at it like two stupid jerks, - like animals. - Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying that that's the reason he turned out this way? How could a mother take off and leave her kid? How could a woman do that? I don't know, but it's got nothing to do with who he is. It's payback for what I do. What the fuck are you talking about? Come on. I'm always figuring, figuring it in my head. And his head don't work. It's fucking perfect. His head works fine. And if you believed that, you should have quit a long time ago. Hey. I gotta live. Ok? I gotta eat. This is what I do. Nobody gets a pass in this life, Janice. And this kid is my fucking sentence. You know what? You're a fucking asshole. You got a kid who loves you, who needs you, and for whatever the fucked-up reason, you won't let him in. You won't let anyone in, and you know why? Because you got no fucking balls, man! You're so fucking scared, you can't even see. You know what? I'm out of here. I'm going home. - This is stupid. - No. That's not true, what you said. - Oh, it is true. - That's not true! Hey! What are you looking at? You can't see me anyway. It's not even about us anymore. It's about your kid, who's more of a fucking man than you are. - The kid doesn't even like me. - Oh! That is such bullshit! You are so fucking full of shit! You know, I may be old and I may be ugly, but I am not full of shit. You want to know why I wear this thing? I wear it all the fucking time. You want to know why? Because it reminds me of who I am. A dumb, Yonkers girl from Lincoln High. I have done fucking nothing with my life, but I don't bullshit... and I promise you... we got a chance to do something good here... and you are fucking blowing it. I mean, you're ask-- I don't know what you want me to do. I don't. You're not ugly. It's all right. Oh, jeez. What are you doing? What-- What's this? A present for you. Oh, that's so sweet. I love the wrapping. - It's pink. - Yeah. Ha ha! That is definitely pink. "The plaza." Hmm. Oh, my God, it's us. Ha ha ha! Look at you. Oh, you look so happy there. Look at your father. He's got a little smile. Oh, oh, I love this. Thank you so much. My friend Joe. Come here. Mwah! Mm. Oh, I'm sorry. Oops. Ha ha! Yeah. Oh, that was so sweet of you. Thank you. Ooh. Ooh. Heh heh. Ok. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. That's enough. That's enough. No, no, no, no. Joe, Joe, Joe, stop. Hey, hey, hey, slow down, Joe. Hey, what are you doing? Come on, J-- Joe, come on. Stop it. No. No. Please. Please don't do this, Joe, please. Joe, don't do this. Joe! Joe, get off! Stop it! No! Stop it! No! Goddamn it! Get off me! Get off me! No! What the hell is wrong with you? Huh? Huh? Are you crazy? You son of a bitch. - Huh? - Get off. What the hell is wrong with you? You hurt her? You fucking hurt her? Stop. Please. Please get off. Leave him alone. He'll never change, all right? - Are you all right? - Yes. - Are you all right? - I'm ok. Please. Bring him back, please. Go get him. Oh... Oh, shit. Janice! Janice! Hey! Look at me. Look at me. Huh? What you did-- What you did was inexcusable. You hurt somebody who cares about you, who loves you very much. Janice loves you. Everybody loves you. Just let me go home. I'll be right again. You don't have to see me. You don't have to write me. Just let me go back to the bunk. Don't you think I would if I could? I know how bad you want to go back there, - But there's no going back. - Fuck you! Fuck you. You turned your back on me, And that's a rotten fucking thing to do. Janice! Stop it, Joe. S-stop it. I shouldn't have done that. - I shouldn't have done that. - Joe, listen to me. - Listen to me. - I don't belong here. I have three chromosomes, and you have two. That's why I'm so fucking ugly. Nobody's ever gonna love me. You know that's not true, huh? There's something out there for you. We just got to find it, that's all. I'm not gonna turn my back on you. You went through some shit now. Every man goes through shit. Every man has got problems, right, And you're a man, right? I wear musk for men. That's right. Listen to me. We're gonna do this together, ok, me and you. You're fine. You're not ugly. You're ok, but right now, you're gonna go upstairs, and you're gonna apologize to Janice because that's what a man does. Now come on. Come on. What's out there? There's nothing but desert out there. Come on. There's the shuttle to New York. I know. Joe has something to tell you. I'm sorry. All right, all right. Come on. Sit down. Just sit down. Listen. He was screaming your name out there. He's-- he's sick about it, Janice. I mean, he knows he's wrong. Are you still my friend? Yeah. Yeah. I'm your friend, And I want to forgive you, But you can never, ever do that again to anyone. That is not how you show affection to a woman. - Men don't act that way. - That's right. That's exactly it. That's it. That's it. It's all right. It's all right. Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's ok. Shh. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. Shh. I know. Joe, it's me. Open up. What's up? Well, what's going on here? Look. We got two apples building at the table downstairs. We got to make a move right now. I'll be down in a minute. Oh, Jesus Christ. You know you're gonna put me in a hell of a jackpot with these guys if we don't do this thing. You put yourself in the jackpot, ok? - Listen. I came up with something. - What? What, what, what? You came up with something? - Yeah. - Well, then tell me about it. I want to know right now. - I mean-- - Uh, Joe. It's ok. It's ok. I'd like to hear it too. Ok. Let's do it. Come on. Hey, come on. - Hey. - Hi, Stanley. The eye in the sky is gonna be watching me because I'm the shooter, right? What happens if I grab the dice with an open hand and show that I have nothing in it? Oh, come on, Joe. How you gonna make a move with nothing in your hand? You're the expert, right? When the player shoots and the dice are in the air, - can you see them? - What? Can you see the dice in the air? Well, there's no reason to even look at them when they're in the air. As long as they hit the backboard, nobody touches them, what's the matter? - That's right. - Wait a second. Wait a second. Are you saying that you can switch the dice in midair? I'm gonna show you. Joe, come here. I want you to sit over here. I want you to help me out here with this, ok? Here. Put this over here. Come on. Just sit down over there. Yeah. All right? Here. Listen. Ok? All right. Ha ha ha! See, here's what I'm gonna do. Here. Watch. The eye in the sky is gonna see this. I'm gonna pick up the dice with an open hand, right? Now watch. Good job, Joey. I don't understand. What just happened? Yeah. It couldn't be more simple. I hold on to one of the die. Do you understand? I only let one go. Stanley, come on. I'm gonna whip it really fast, right? When that dice hits your side of the table, All you have to do is let go of the load. You don't even have to look. Do it just like Joey did. Just let it go. Let it fall down. Come on. Janice, you'll be on my right side. I could cling to you afterwards. Well, that's still only one die. What about the other one? - You do it twice. - You do it twice. What's the matter? You never made two moves before? That's great. It's great. - Eh, no. It won't work. - What? You don't have the black light gel. I got it. - You got it? - That's right. I got it. It's back home. We could be back here in two days, And one more thing-- Teddy remains. Joe, the Miami guys are my play. I put it in motion, right? What do we need Teddy for? Because the Miami guys are green. That's why I need you and Teddy At the table to guide them. They don't know what they're doing. We got about 8 or 10 rolls Before the heat comes down, so every bet counts. I don't need to wake them up with any bad money plays. Ok. All right. Now, how you gonna get the loads out of the game? I'll move them out. You just get them in. Then you're clean. You got nothing on you. We ain't bullshitting nobody. All right. All right. Let me go down, deal with them. Thanks, Travis. That's a half a yard for you. It's a 3-4 splitter. Combine this with the ace-deuce and knock out the 7s. Hey, that combo is gonna make us a lot of low numbers. Uh-huh, mostly, 4s, 5s. Now, I reversed the deuces on the weight So you can identify them. Now, the spots, they go From the right to the left When the 6 is up. - Can you see that? - I see it. All right. Here. Watch this. Take a look. - Oh, damn. - What do you think? Yeah. I got to admit it. The gel is great. It's the same shit they stamp your hand with At the track in Miami. I got it at the raceway. You have any problems? Nah, nah, nah. Just melted it down. No. It's perfect. What? I can't make the drop. I thought about it for a long time. If I get made, I'm ruined. I mean, I blow my business, My license to sell, everything. Joe, it's a good idea. No. No, no, no. It's a fucking great idea. I just can't do it. I mean, come on. The only way we could have a problem Is if you don't drop the dice. I mean, I've seen you make much harder moves For much less money. Joe, even if we get by, this is Vegas. They get wind of my business, They're gonna know that I'm around mechanics. I don't mind lumps for trumps, But, you know, we can wind up in the can here. I still think our best bet Is to turn to these Miami guys. I mean, they're raring to go. They'll do anything you say, you know? Why don't we just stick to the original plan? That was never my plan. Oh, damn it, Joe. I'm a hell of a lugger and a pretty good takedown man, But I ain't never been much of a mover. - You know that. - What mover? We're talking about opening your hand And let the dice drop out. Joe, you know, with your past, this is not gonna be like bumpsy, you know? They're gonna throw in a conspiracy charge, and you'll do a dime over this. Is this worth 10 years of your life? All right. All right. - I got an idea. - What? Well, I think this might work. The kid. Let him do it. We already know he can. How's that? I seen him do it. It got by me. Plus, anything happens, What are they gonna do, huh? They take one look at him. They slap him on the hand. They throw him out. I could do it. I'm good at this. Damn right. It could work, Joe. Yeah, right. The skies will fall from fucking heaven before I involve my son in this. Ok, Joe. All right. Then what do you want to do here, huh? We got these guys waiting back in Vegas with You want to see that money go out the front door? Dad, I could help you. I could drop the dice. That's not why you're here, Joey. Oh, Jesus Christ, What are we gonna do here? Look, Joe. Why don't we just turn these Miami schmucks, huh? Otherwise, they're gonna lose every dime of the money, every dime. He's right, Joe. I mean, is it better that we let the casino get it? Come on, Joey. Let's go. Well, I still don't understand why you're marking dice you're not gonna use, and don't give me that bull about them wanting to see them after because I'm the one who's supposed to get rid of them. Oh, fuck. You're gonna make the move yourself, aren't you? - You're crazy. - No. You're fucking crazy. You can't do it, ok, not alone. I got the gel. I get the dice in the game, I'm clean. You get out of there, they got nothing. - The bad dice will still be on the table. - So? So they'll find them. That's right. They can't prove it's me. No. It's crazy. You know what? I'll do it. I'll make the drop. No. I can't. I got to cling to you. Ok. Then I'm not going in. I'm not. I'm not gonna help you, ok? It's nuts. Are you telling me you want After what happened? Especially after what happened. I could help you, dad. All right. I could help you. - What are you doing? - I could help you. What are you doing, huh? I could drop the dice. I could help you. I could drop the dice. I could make the move. I could help you. Dad, I could help you. All right. Go wait over there. Go ahead. Joe, what are you doing? Just wait over there. Look. He could drop the dice. We could tell him to wait right here for us at the Vegas club. Are you fucking crazy? You can't pressure him, and he won't freeze up. if anything happens, I take the blow, not him. And if you do take the blow, what happens to him? Right. You hadn't thought of that. Forget about it. It's a bad idea. Janice, listen to me. You're gonna use your son like this? - It's not about me this time. - Bullshit. Bullshit. - It's about you. - No. It's not about-- Hey, listen to me. It's not about me this time. It's about him. I'm telling you, he has caught Every bad break a human being can catch, including me for a father. All he wants to do is help me, And I have done nothing for him. I don't buy it. Janice, I've been alone all my life, but I'm never lonely until I look at this kid. Right or wrong, I want to help this kid right now. Please, let him feel like he's part of something. He's part of this. Let him help me, Janice. He could do it. I know it. Ok. Ok. - Ok. - Good luck.

Stay here in case he shows. - Where are you going? - I got to go find him. What are you doing? You can't go back in the casino. Where else am I gonna go? It's the only place he knows. All right, but don't panic. - I won't panic. - All right. Joe! Joe! Joey. Joe, where you going? Come on. The bus will take me all the way to Grand Central Station in New York City. Then I get on the number 7 to route 100, and it takes me all the way home. Come on. What are you doing here? I called Miss Santini. You have to dial a 1 first. She said Janice sounds very nice. I told her that I was sorry and I want to go back to the bunk. You know, this greyhound must be a three-day ride, you know? Two days, 10 hours, and 50 minutes. I told Miss Santini that every man has got problems, and I'm a man, and I have problems, but my dad says that the group home sounds like a nice place, and I believe him. She said that I could go home until the group home is ready for me, and in 6 months, they're gonna need me very much. Yeah. Well, I need you very much. I want you to stay with me. I want to go to the group home and get a new job and meet new friends, but you can write me. You can write letters if you want to. Ok, but I want you to come home with me and Janice, ok, on the plane, all right, And then we'll talk about it. I love you, dad. I love you, dad. I love you very much. I know. Hey... Hey, wait a minute. You take this money. Take some money. Need some money? Here. When you get back there, you call me, all right? I'll be waiting for you. Joe Duma the winner. Ha ha ha! Oh... What happened? Did you find him? I found him. Where is he? He went back to the place he likes. You let him go? He let me go. You're not gonna believe me, Janice. What happened, he called Miss Santini. He got on a Greyhound bus by himself. He had maps, schedules. He had everything all planned.
