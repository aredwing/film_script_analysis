Chandler pharmaceuticals distributed among the citizens of the information, that they help them get through the day. They help you through the night at, the week or the month. They even help with the attachment! They should get you over the worst. In all this it should help them. And now for the record: I'm not worried about a pissed-off gulf coast DJ. And I said to Pierre, that I wished I Russ Chandler outside to run into. That would be a good opportunity to the bully to miss. We are back in New Orleans ninth district. In our region, the popular and controversial DJ Aldous Huxtable. I wanted to ask you, and I hope that you give us an answer. They preach so emphatic about the trigger for the events that occurred. I can tell them exactly, what the triggers are, Connie. There are greed and avarice. You have to be a genius to figure it out. This is since time immemorial that. Obviously Chandler pharmaceuticals is nothing more than a bargaining chip our government. She let it be, That your "posttraumatic anti-stress" - Drugs in recent months to distribute the inhabitants. And now we see what these mind altering pills are capable of. I tell them, you are... - Okay, okay. Aldous. You are the wrecking ball our society. As you can... How can you be so sure, that there is a connection there with the drugs? Could not it rather a be living in the water parasite, from the time after Katrina? The facts are still very clear. In recent months, the competent authority Drugs can do nothing about these experiments in experience, which were incidentally commissioned by... My son returned with acute PTSD from Iraq. God bless him. He was involved in the tests with these drugs. And now? What should I do now? You should get him out from these tests! He is not a participant of the test, it is the test! My goodness, this pharmaceutical companies Chandler pharmaceuticals, and the competent governmental authority they provide your son with drugs that have camouflaged as anti-depressants. But oh, it's the devil, it's voodoo. It is a virus! And you guys are crazy! You take it with right and left, no matter as it just comes and swallows it like a candy! What's wrong with you? Wow. Just look at us. Our fathers would be very proud. Why do you need Black Rain as a bodyguard? We need Black Rain not as a bodyguard. I want you to be eliminating this creatures for me. So you need me to dispose of your garbage? This will not be cheap, Rush. The disposal of garbage is your task. To pay you for it, is mine. There are about four or five thousand of these persons. Yes, more or less. It has it changed completely. I wants you, you are removing for me. Here is someone I want to introduce them. Dr. Soulis? Welcome Katie Ann. Beautiful. That was guys against girls? And what have you to do with it? Dr. Soulis is the Managing Director of research and development here at Chandler. Yes, thank you. Listen. Let me tell you something about the background of this drug. As I myself witnessed what devastating aftermath of Hurricane Katrina had on the residents of New Orleans , I saw a crystal clear chance for a more effective treatment of post-traumatic stress and anxiety-like behavioral disorders, under which seemed to suffer from the patients. I immediately started with the development of an innovative drug, which should help to solve the stress and returns the poor people their former life. I'm strongly assuming that it was not your intention, To make the victim to mindless killers, Dr. Soulis? Oh, quite the contrary. I think the doctor may speak for themselves. Thank you. Yes, really. Quite the contrary. You have to understand, there was an extreme craving for this drug. There was not much time for further clinical testing. What we did not know was that, with the increasing burden, their blood changed during the treatments of patients. So much so that it is a negative behavior pattern to resulted in some parts of your brain. I mean, ultimately, these are patients, according to our experience, more or less brain dead. Let me summarize it for you in very simple terms: It's not even so much brain function exists, that these poor bastards to could tie the laces. And what about the human basic need to survive? I would not say that you are human. The point is, you see, need these people, they require and want fresh blood and do everything. Your instinct wants it that way. Whatever happen! Wait here. They belong to me. The trigger is stiff. Throw time on it a glance. I will just informed that we have a surprise guest. A guest caller on the line, it is Dr. Soulis. It is something like the father of this drug. He is a scientist. Has and develops, because of the post-traumatic-stress syndrome. And the result is violence and corruption in our beautiful city. Dr. Soulis, we know your call appreciate. Are you there, sir? Hello? Aldous... A very good evening, sir. Aldous, let me explain. My project was the development of an innovative treatment. Not only to live with PTSD, but to cure it under certain circumstances. What can you offer us? What information we can get from it, to get out of this fatal situation? I wanted to give them back your life. Okay. I have good news and bad news . What you want to hear first? So, I always prefer the good news. All right. Here is the bad news. You scoundrel. There is absolutely nothing we could do for these poor people. If you are taking this medication, it leads to massive brain damage. And it gets mixed with other illegal substances... Croak shalt thou, that thou hast made me so dependent. I have no idea what are you talking there, man. ...These act as an accelerator. Result, the conversion takes place almost rapidly. We unfortunately have no other choice but to eliminate the victims. The good news is that we have colleagues, at the University of Texas. In the medical center. They say that you could reverse the effect, all of you who have taken the drug within the last 72 hours. You're right, these are really good news , sir. This is fantastic. And how can we get to this serum? On this, there is in Texas, from the medical center? Well, as you probably know, the airport was closed, I mean the Louis Armstrong Airport. In fact, this is true. Likewise, the entire airspace was New Orleans. How no-fly zone. I do not know for what reasons, because you know as much as I. Our government... ...Denied the flight to get there. There you have it. What can you say to ? What can we do? Chandler pharmaceuticals keeps us on a short leash, long as we take this anti-depressants. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, here speaks again Aldous Huxtable. It was previously rare that I'm speechless, but today is to a particular case. That's why I make myself on the way to Austin to the serum to find and herzubringen it. I can not just sit here and wait. For all those which are in dire straits, is Pierre, my assistant, here, answer your calls and passes the information, if you are in trouble. It is time to put the fight. The war... Aldous that came in here for you. What is it? - No idea, it was dropped. What do you mean dropped? By whom? I do not know. Military. - Military? Yes, yes. Camouflage, any badge, all that stuff. What is it? My God. He has told the truth. Is that what I think it? Pierre, I have to go now. Aldous Huxtable logs off. God have mercy on us all. I do not know how I go there and how long it will take. The way is long and my time is short. Take that with. Pierre, I wish you could come with me. Take care of yourself. - Thank you. God bless you. Are you Aldous Huxtable? Yes, that's me. Do I know you, sir? Get into the car! - You're welcome. I think I've peed me. You go to the door, Bro! Move your ass, I'm just gambling, man! Fuck you, nigger. This is your shit and your door. Pass on prefer, otherwise are you there like that. What is going on? Ah, hi Sorry to bother you. Do you think we could get two grams of your good stuff? From the good stuff? - Yes. I interrupting my fucking game because of two crappy bags? No, no. Sorry. Can we get a Eight-Ball? That would be better! Yes, make two out of it. I'm still money from my dad. Age, I hate this part of the city. The guys chasing me afraid. We need a hiding place for it. If Mom and Dad find that they'll kill us. 200 Okay. I... If you only touches my fucking game, I get the out. That was it. Hey, you draw to you with us a pure if we...? That would be really... - Fuck off! Yes? Rush? I want the exact numbers now. How much is of the stuff really outstanding? And how many patients were administered the drug? And even if I knew how many pills we released... There are a lot out there street dealers who peddle this shit. The mix the stuff with all sorts. Why are you asking me that? For what I pay you actually ? War it out myself. Rush! I know you know of the serum. I'm not paying you to make you worry about a fictitious serum, the totally ruin my company would. I'll pay you for it, that you flat do these creatures and that calm returns before it spreads further. Do you hear me? Katie, do you hear me? Yes. Fuck! Wow. A really great automobile is this. A muscle car from the period, when they were still made of iron. That has really cost money, the vollzutanken times, am I right? Have you ever heard of hybrid ? I ask you something, you are wearing no economic, on fiscal responsibility? This is yesterday's news. I do not want to talk shop, but let's just say, the price of fuel and the ecosystem not very near the top on my shitty To-Do list. It wanted to have just said. Have mercy on us. What's going on? It is hard to believe that these things our friends and our neighbors. Thank you earlier 've saved my life. Yes. Do not mention it. Wow. Ha... Do you hear the guys about it? What? Are you a fan of Zydeco? Oh yes. My father thought that it is important for us to understand, What our heritage is, and the music has played a major role. When we moved sometime in the St. Bernard church, he desperately wanted that we look at all these guys. My grandfather thought he was crazy, but today I really appreciate it. And you? How do you know the guys? I've played with the boys guitar. - Really? The only white person in the band. I was a little shit. Ah, you're not old enough to know who is Clifton Chenier. He is no longer with us. Clear I know. Clifton died a year after our first meeting. Jerry Reed would say I was the swinging little guitar, ha I played with Rockin Dopsie, Beau Jocque, Boozoo Chavez and the others. I do not think that's true, but I am curious if it is true.
