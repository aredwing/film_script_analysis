A NICE TOWN WITH HARDWORKING, LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS. BUT EVEN THE NICEST TOWNS HAVE BACK ALLEYS AND BACK ALLEY TROUBLE. THAT'S WHERE I COME IN. I CARRY A BADGE. IT'S PLASTIC. [anxious clamorous music] I'M SAM STEELE JR., PRIVATE EYE, AND RIGHT NOW, TROUBLE IS JUS AROUND THE CORNER. THAT HERD OF WATER BUFFALO CHASING ME IS BILLY COOK AND HIS GANG. BILLY'S THE UGLY ONE. I KNOW, THEY'RE ALL UGLY. - GET HIM! - AS SOON AS I CAN BREATHE AGAIN, I'M CONTACTING LENORE. SHE'S MY RECEPTIONIS AT THE JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY. I'M THE JUNIOR, AND SHE'S THE ONE WHO MAKES SURE I STAY OUT OF TROUBLE. IT'S NOT EASY. [breathing heavily] LENORE. LENORE, CODE 11. I'M NEAR A DUMPSTER IN AN ALLEY OFF OF COURT STREET. - SAM, DARLING, CODE 11 IS AN EMERGENCY PIZZA DELIVERY. I TRUST YOU MEAN CODE 12? BILLY COOK IS ABOUT TO STOMP YOU INTO GROUND CHUCK. - RIGHT AGAIN, LENORE. I'LL HAVE THAT TO KEEP ME WARM IN THE HOSPITAL. - CODY, GET AWAY FROM THAT SMELLY THING. - LENORE? LENORE? LENORE, I'M IN HERE. - I DON'T DO DUMPSTERS. - I'M FINE. I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. [grunting] OKAY. OKAY. AH! - DON'T TELL ME THIS IS OUR NEW OFFICE. - WHAT DID I SAY ABOU BILLY COOK? - YOU SAID HE WAS A BAD EGG AND THAT HE'D BE MAD THAT YOU CAUGHT HIM STEALING FREDDIE MALONE'S BICYCLE. - AND? - YOU SAID WHEN HIS MONTH OF DETENTION AND GROUNDING WAS UP THAT HE'D BE COMING AFTER YOU. - AND WHAT ELSE? - YOU WANTED ME TO REMIND YOU THAT THE MONTH WAS UP. - AND WHAT DID YOU DO? - OH, I SEE. YOU WANTED ME TO TELL YOU BEFORE THE MONTH WAS UP. - [sighs] YOU'RE THE LIMIT, LENORE. - OH, AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT IN HALF AN HOUR. BETTER GET HOME TO WASH OFF THE STENCH OF HUMILIATION. - [sighs] DAMES--JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT 'EM FIGURED OUT, THEY LET YOU TAKE A DUMPSTER DIVE IN YOUR GOOD SHOES. [melancholy trumpet music] - DETECTIVES STEELE AND FOGLE, CHIEF VAN OWEN NEEDS TO SEE YOU RIGHT AWAY. - 10-4. - HEY, SAM, AIN'T THAT YOUR KID? WHAT'S HE DOING DOWNTOWN? - I DON'T KNOW. - WHAT'S WITH THE FEDORA AND THE TRENCH COAT, MAN? - HELLO, SIR. WHAT BRINGS YOU DOWNTOWN? - I WORK HERE. WHAT ABOUT YOU? - WHOA, SAM. YOU ARE SMELLING RIPE. WHAT, YOU BEEN GOING TO SCHOOL IN A GARBAGE TRUCK, SON? - NO, DETECTIVE FOGLE. IT'S SUMMER VACATION. - MM. - LOOK, SON, I KNOW YOU LIKE PLAYING PRIVATE DETECTIVE... - I'M NOT PLAYING, SIR. - NEVERTHELESS, YOU SHOULDN'T BE COMING ALL THE WAY DOWNTOWN. YOUR MOTHER WOULD BE WORRIED SICK. - SIR, I'M ON A CASE. - DOWNTOWN IS OUT OF YOUR JURISDICTION. THAT'S AN ORDER. NOW, LET'S GET YOU HOME. - HEY, SAM, YOU RIDE IN THE BACK. TAKE THAT STINK WITH YOU, ALL RIGHT? [enigmatic accordion music] - WELCOME TO MICHE. RIGHT THIS WAY. - [French accent] AH, MERCI. THANK YOU. - WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE WINE LIST? - UH, NO, BUT COULD YOU HAVE THE WAITER BRING ME SOME SPARKLING WATER, NO ICE? - OF COURSE. UM, IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING, YOU'RE NOT FROM AROUND HERE, ARE YOU? - NO, NO, I AM FROM LYON. IT IS FRANCE. - WHAT BRINGS YOU TO DES MOINES? - A SMALL COMMUTER PLANE FROM CHICAGO. NO, I TEASE. I'M ON A SIGHTSEEING TOUR OF YOUR COUNTRY, AND DES MOINES, IT'S AN AMERICAN CITY WITH FRENCH HISTORY. - I KNOW, WE STUDIED THA IN HIGH SCHOOL. DES MOINES IS ACTUALLY FRENCH FOR THE-- - UH! LITERALLY THE TRANSLATION MEANS "OF THE MONKS." ORIGINALLY IT WAS RIVIERE DES MOINES. - OF COURSE. I'LL GET YOUR WAITER. - AH, IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE THE LAST ROBBERY. MAYBE WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF THE CAT FOR GOOD IN DES MOINES. - I CERTAINLY HOPE SO. THE MUSEUM WON'T BE THE SAME WITHOUT ITS REMBRANDT. AND I'M STILL UPSET ABOUT THA FIRST ROBBERY. A DIAMOND NECKLACE STOLEN RIGHT OUT OF VANMEETER ESTATE? NO ONE IS SAFE. - SPARKLING WATER, SIR. - I HAVE ASKED FOR NO ICE. IS THIS TOO DIFFICUL TO UNDERSTAND, HUH? - NO ICE. YES, SIR. - DON'T FORGET: STAY IN YOUR JURISDICTION. - AND TAKE A BATH. - I HESITATED TO TELL MY FATHER THAT PRIVATE DETECTIVES DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH JURISDICTION. HE WORKS FOR THE MAN, SO HE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT. - VANGUARD MUSEUM. - AH, HERE WE GO AGAIN. [tires squeal] - I ALSO FAILED TO MENTION THAT DETECTIVE FOGLE DIDN'T SMELL LIKE A DOZEN ROSES EITHER. - SAMUEL VERNON STEELE JR., OUT OF THOSE FILTHY CLOTHES AND INTO A HOT BATH NOW. - MOM, PLEASE, I'M WITH A CLIENT RIGHT NOW. CAN'T I DO THAT FIRST? - OH, YOU SMELL LIKE A GOAT. AND YOUR SHOES ARE RUINED. - MOM, PLEASE. I DON'T HAVE THAT MANY CLIENTS RIGHT NOW. - WELL, IF POOR LENORE CAN STAND IT, GO AHEAD. BUT AS SOON AS YOU'RE FINISHED PLAYING DETECTIVE, IT'S BATH TIME. AND LEAVE THOSE FILTHY CLOTHES OUTSIDE. - THAT POOR DELUDED WOMAN. SHE'S CONVINCED HERSELF THAT MY JOB IS A GAME. I GUESS SHE DOES IT TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE DANGER. - AND THEN HE FELL OUT OF THE DUMPSTER, RIGHT ONTO THE... RIGHT ON TIME, SAM. YOUR 3:00'S WAITING FOR YOU. THAT IS IF YOUR MOMMY WILL LE YOU SEE HIM BEFORE BATH TIME. - THANK YOU, LENORE. - WHAT'S THAT SMELL? - [sighs] IT'S A LITTLE AROMA I LIKE TO CALL JUSTICE. WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, MELVIN? - SOMEBODY STOLE MY BIKE. - I CHARGE A QUARTER A DAY PLUS EXPENSES. - EXPENSES? - WELL, STAKEOUTS CAN RUN LATE, AND COFFEE ISN'T FREE, MELVIN. - MY AUNT ETTA GAVE ME A KENNEDY HALF-DOLLAR FOR MY BIRTHDAY. IT'S ALL I GOT. BESIDES, YOUR MOM WON'T LET YOU DRINK COFFEE. - YOU GOT A DESCRIPTION OF THIS BIKE? - WELL, IT HAS TRAINING WHEELS. - YOU GOT AN INNER EAR INFECTION? - AND IT'S BLUE AND IT HAS WHITE STREAMERS ON THE HANDLEBAR GRIPS. - YOU SURE IT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOUR SISTER? - HEY. - [laughs] JUST KIDDING, JUNIOR. WHY DON'T WE CHECK OU THE SCENE OF THE CRIME? LENORE, PUT CODY'S LEASH ON. WE'VE GOT A CASE. - WHAT? - CODY. ON A LEASH. LEAD THE WAY, MELVIN. [mysterious orchestral music] [walkie-talkie beeps] - ABOUT TIME YOU FELLOWS GOT HERE. - SORRY, CHIEF. WE WERE ACROSS TOWN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - IT WAS EITHER COME HERE OR SIT IN MY OFFICE AND GET YELLED AT BY THE MAYOR. - HE'S TOYING WITH US. - PRICELESS MING VASE LIFTED RIGHT UNDER THE NOSES OF THE MUSEUM SECURITY. THIS IS THE FOURTH ROBBERY IN THREE MONTHS AND WE'RE NO CLOSER TO CATCHING THE CAT. AND WHEN I SEE "WE," I MEAN YOU. SAM, I DON'T EXPECT A LOT FROM THE REST OF THE DETECTIVES... - HEY, I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE. - SAM, YOU'VE SOLVED SOME OF THE BIGGEST CASES EVER TO HIT CHICAGO. I EXPECT MORE OUT OF YOU. - WE'LL CATCH THIS GUY, CHIEF. YOU CAN COUNT ON IT. - I HOPE SO, DETECTIVE. BECAUSE IF THE CAT IS FREE TO DO THIS AGAIN, THE MAYOR'S GOING TO WAN TO START A TASK FORCE, AND YOU TWO WON'T BE INVITED TO THE WEDDING. ESPECIALLY YOU! - YOU HEARD THE MAN. LET'S GET TO WORK. - HOW DOES HE KNOW THE EXAC WEIGHT OF A MING VASE? - I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE LEAVES NO PRINTS AND WEARS NO GLOVES. - THE GUY'S GOOD. - THAT'S WHERE MY BIKE WAS WHEN I WENT TO THE HOUSE FOR LUNCH. - HMM. YOU LEAVE YOUR BIKE OU TO GO HAVE A BOLOGNA SANDWICH, NEXT THING YOU KNOW, IT'S IN A KINDERGARTEN CHOP SHOP. - ARE YOU TALKING TO YOURSELF? - IT'S CALLED AN INNER MONOLOGUE. ALL GOOD DETECTIVES HAVE ONE. NOW, SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU LOST YOUR BIKE. - RIGHT HERE. I WAS CLEANING I WHEN MY MOM CALLED ME IN. - OKAY. GOOD. HMM. IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT YOU HAD A CLEAN BIKE. OKAY, CODY. SNIFF ME OUT A CLUE. - WHAT'D YOU FIND? - A CLUE, MELVIN. - IT LOOKS LIKE A PIECE OF GRAVEL. - MELVIN, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE PAYING ME 50 CENTS TO TRY TO FIND YOUR BIKE. I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CLUE AND A PIECE OF GRAVEL. - CAN I GO? - SORRY, KID, THERE'S NO ROOM FOR AMATEURS ON THIS KIND OF A JOB. YOU CAN WATCH CODY, THOUGH. - AND THIS, THE FOURTH ROBBERY IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS, HAS VICTIMIZED THE SECOND MUSEUM AFTER TWO ESTATE ROBBERIES IN THE GREATER DES MOINES AREA. WE HAVE NO WORD YE ON WHAT WAS STOLEN, BUT GIVEN THE TRACK RECORD OF THE CAT, IT IS LIKELY THE MUSEUM'S FAMED VASE FROM THE MING DYNASTY WAS THE TARGET. AND WITH US RIGHT NOW ARE THE TWO LEAD DETECTIVES ON THE CASE. DETECTIVE STEELE, CAN YOU SHED ANY LIGH ON THIS LATEST ROBBERY? - THE CHIEF WILL BE GIVING A PRESS CONFERENCE LATER TODAY. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT. - IS IT TRUE, DETECTIVE STEELE, THAT THE MAYOR IS CONSIDERING FORMING A TASK FORCE TO PURSUE THE CAT AND THA THE FBI IS NOW INVOLVED? - NO COMMENT. - HOW YOU DOING? MAYBE WE COULD DISCUSS THE CASE OVER DINNER OR SOMETHING LIKE... NO COMMENT. - SO THERE YOU HAVE IT. THE CITY'S FINES ARE ON THE CASE. BELINDA MARTIN REPORTING FROM THE VANGUARD MUSEUM IN DES MOINES. - WHAT THE KID DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT THIS KIND OF GRAVEL ONLY CAME FROM ONE PLACE IN DES MOINES AND THAT'S WHERE I'D FIND THE BIKE. IT PAYS TO HAVE THE MOS EXTENSIVE GRAVEL COLLECTION IN THE STATE OF IOWA. THE HOUSE BELONGS TO THE AMES FAMILY. NICE FOLKS. BUT THEIR OLDEST, KEVIN, BELIEVES THA "THOU SHALL NOT STEAL" IS MORE OF A SUGGESTION RATHER THAN A COMMANDMENT. - HEY! THAT'S MY BIKE! - HE'S GETTING AWAY. HURRY. [grandiose orchestral music] - JOEY AMES, KEVIN'S YOUNGER BROTHER, HE MUST NOT KNOW THAT THIS THING IS HOTTER THAN PIZZA ROLL FILLING RIGHT OUT OF THE MICROWAVE. I NEVER KNEW BEING A PRIVATE EYE REQUIRED SO MUCH EXERCISE. NO, NO. - HEY, LOOK, SAM. MY MOM PUT MY BIKE AWAY WITHOUT TELLING ME. WHOSE BIKE IS THAT? - MINE! - THIS IS FOR TAKING MY BROTHER'S BIKE AND FOR GETTING ME GROUNDED OVER SPRING BREAK. - HEY, CAN I HAVE MY 50 CENTS BACK? - AND THEN YOU ASKED THE REPORTER OUT TO DINNER? - WELL, SIR, I DIDN'T KNOW THE CAMERA WAS STILL ON. - THE CLOCK IS TICKING, GENTLEMEN. THE CURATOR AT THE BARTLEBY REFUSES TO CANCEL THEIR EXHIBIT, AND THAT'S ONLY ONE OF THE POTENTIAL TARGETS THE CAT MIGHT HIT NEXT. - CHIEF, I KNOW YOU'RE FRUSTRATED--WE ALL ARE-- BUT WE'RE MAKING HEADWAY. WE HAVE A LEAD ON WHERE THE CA MIGHT BE FENCING HIS GOODS. - I KNOW, DETECTIVES, BUT LEADS AREN'T ENOUGH. WE NEED AN ARREST! WE NEED IT NOW. - CHIEF, THE MAYOR NEEDS TO SEE YOU RIGHT AWAY. - TELL HIM I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. I'LL TRY TO GET YOU AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE. BUT YOU TWO GO OUT THERE AND FIND THE CAT, OR WE'LL ALL END UP DIRECTING TRAFFIC! - HEY, NICE JOB, FOGLE. MAYBE WE'LL CATCH THE CA WHILE YOU'RE HAVING DINNER. - I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS DAY CAN GET ANY WORSE. - IF YOU'RE SMART, YOU'LL RUN AWAY RIGHT NOW. DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU. - I JUST GOT A CALL FROM MRS. AMES. SHE SAID YOU TRIED TO STEAL HER SON'S BIKE. - MOM, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. I WAS ON A CASE. - NOT ANOTHER WORD, YOUNG MAN. YOU MARCH INTO THAT HOUSE RIGHT NOW, TAKE OFF THOSE STINKY CLOTHES, AND TAKE A BATH. OH, YOUR FATHER IS NOT GOING TO BE PLEASED. - TOUGH DAY, HUH, SAMMY? - SOME GREEN TEA? - THANK YOU. - IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER. I WASHED YOUR TRENCH COA AND YOUR FEDORA, AND THEY SHOULD BE JUST FINE, BUT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THEM TILL NEXT HALLOWEEN. - YOUR MOTHER ONLY WANTS WHAT'S BEST FOR US. YOU KNOW THAT. - I KNOW, DAD. - IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD AN EVENTFUL DAY. - YES, SIR. - HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN RUNNING THIS DETECTIVE AGENCY OF YOURS? - SINCE SPRING BREAK, SIR. I'VE SOLVED HALF A DOZEN CASES AND MADE ABOUT $2. - WELL, THAT'S GOOD WORK, SON. BUT... WE CAN'T HAVE YOU RUNNING AROUND DOWNTOWN OR STEALING BICYCLES. - TWO ISOLATED INCIDENTS, SIR. I ASSURE YOU. - HERE'S WHAT WE'VE DECIDED. YOU'RE GROUNDED FOR A WEEK, AND NO MORE PRIVATE DETECTIVE BUSINESS THIS SUMMER. - BUT, DAD-- - SAMMY. I HAVE ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOU AT WORK. I DON'T NEED TO BE WORRYING ABOUT YOU TOO. - THE CAT, RIGHT, DAD? HE IS A SLIPPERY ONE. - YES, HE IS. - YOU'LL CATCH HIM, DAD. YOU ALWAYS CATCH THE BAD GUYS. I ACCEPT YOUR PUNISHMEN BUT REQUEST THAT WE REVISIT THE JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY ISSUE AT A LATER DATE. - A MUCH LATER DATE. NOW GO TO BED. - HOW'S YOUR TEA? - LIKE HOT WATER THROUGH GRASS CLIPPINGS. - OH, HUSH. YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD FOR YOU. HOW'D HE TAKE HIS PUNISHMENT? - LIKE HE ALWAYS DOES: STIFF UPPER LIP AND A SHOT AT NEGOTIATION. HE REMINDS ME OF DAD. BORN POLITICIAN. - I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY BOYS. - WE'RE BOTH JUST PUSHING OU A DOOR THAT SAYS PULL. WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT SOMEDAY. - I THINK YOU JUST NEED A LITTLE MORE OF THIS. - I KNEW MY DAD. AFTER I SERVED MY TIME, WE'D TALK AGAIN. THE JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY WASN'T DEAD YET. LENORE? [static crackles] HEY, LENORE. YOU THERE? [static crackles] [dubious accordion music] - [sighs] TWO MORE FOR THE CAT, AND THEN... I AM OFF TO KANSAS. - SO I GUESS YOU ALREADY HEARD. - HEARD WHAT? - MY DAD GOT TRANSFERRED TO ST. LOUIS. WE'LL BE MOVING NEXT WEEK. I FIGURED THAT'S WHY YOU'RE CLOSING THE AGENCY. - NAH, MOM AND DAD ARE PUNISHING ME. THEY'RE MAKING ME SHUT IT DOWN. SO YOU'RE MOVING, HUH? THAT'S A BUMMER. - NOT REALLY. MY DAD GO A REALLY BIG PROMOTION, AND WE'LL BE MOVING INTO A REALLY COOL HOUSE, AND CODY WILL HAVE A BIG BACKYARD TO PLAY IN. - SOUNDS GREAT. - SO I GUESS SINCE YOU'RE GROUNDED, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE I TO MY GOING-AWAY PARTY. - WELL, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GE SOME TIME OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR. WHEN IS IT? - FRIDAY, 1:00. - I'LL TRY AND BE THERE. - I HOPE YOU GET TO REOPEN THE AGENCY EVEN IF I'M NOT HERE. - POOR LITTLE GUY. - THE MAYOR? - ALL OVER ME LIKE SYRUP ON A PANCAKE. IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE I GOT TO HIDE. - WE'RE HEAR TO SEE DR. LOWELL. - THE SCENE OF THE CRIME. I THINK HE'S GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU. CAN'T HANG OUT ANY LONGER. TIME TO TELL THE MAYOR WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY IDEAS! - GOOD TO SEE YOU, CHIEF. - ANYTHING NEW, DOCTOR? - NO PRINTS, NO DNA, BUT WE DO HAVE A PARTIAL FOOTPRINT HERE. YOU SEE, ONCE AGAIN, OUR THIEF KNEW THE ENTRANCE THAT WASN'T BLOCKED OFF OR WIRED TO THE MAIN ALARM SYSTEM. HE CAME IN THROUGH THE VERANDA UPSTAIRS AND CAME DOWN THIS STAIRCASE. - WHAT DO YOU THINK, EDDIE? - SEVEN. - SEVEN AND A HALF. - MM. - ANYTHING ON THE VERANDA WORTH NOTING? - WELL, BASED ON THE SCRATCH MARKS ON THE EXTERIOR WALL AND THE ROOFTOP, HE USED A GRAPPLING HOOK. - WHAT ABOUT THE BUSINESS CARD? - WELL, THAT'S THE SAME AS THE OTHERS. NO PRINTS, INK-JET-- PROBABLY A HOMEMADE JOB. - HOW'D HE DESIGN THA CAT PAW? THAT'S REALLY COOL. - LOOK, WE'LL HAVE ALL OUR FINDINGS BACK LATER ON AT THE LAB IF YOU WANT TO STOP BY TODAY. - THANKS, DOCTOR. LET'S GO TALK TO OUR FAVORITE FENCE. - LUNCH FIRST. I DIDN'T HAVE TIME FOR BREAKFAST. - OH, AND, SAM, THIS GUY ISN'T MAKING ANY MISTAKES, AND AT THIS RATE, WE'LL NEVER FIND OUT WHO HE IS. - WE GOT A FOOTPRINT NOW. THAT NARROWS IT DOWN TO A FEW MILLION PEOPLE. - WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, PARTNER? - THIS THIEF KNOWS HIS TARGETS. KNOWS THEM INSIDE AND OUT. KNOWS WHEN TO HIT, WHERE TO HIT, AND WHAT TO HIT. - STAKING THE PLACES OUT. - FOR DAYS, MAYBE WEEKS. AND HE ONLY HITS THE BIG TARGETS. ESTATES FIRST, DIAMONDS AND SAPPHIRES, THEN THE REMBRAND AT THE POLK COUNTY MUSEUM. NOW THE MING. - HE'S GOT ALMOS ALL THE GOOD STUFF IN TOWN. THERE CAN ONLY BE A FEW PLACES LEFT TO HIT. - LET'S GO FIGURE OUT WHICH IS ON THE TOP OF THE LIST. - HEY, CHIEF. - CHIEF, YOU GOT A MINUTE? - I DO IF YOU GOT SOMETHING ON THE CAT. - MAYBE WE DO. - I'LL LET DETECTIVE STEELE FILL ME ON THE DETAILS, ALL RIGHT? - WE'RE GOING ABOUT THIS THE WRONG WAY. WE'RE WAITING FOR THE CA TO STRIKE, AND THEN WE START LOOKING FOR HIM. WHAT IF WE WERE A STEP AHEAD RATHER THAN A STEP BEHIND? - WELL, I LIKE IT, BUT HOW? - GOING BY WHAT THE CA HAS STOLEN, THERE ARE ONLY ONE OR TWO MORE PLACES FOR HIM TO HIT. BASED ON THE INSIDE INFORMATION HE OBTAINS, WE KNOW THAT HE STAKES OUT HIS TARGET LONG BEFORE THE ROBBERY. - SO WE STAKE OUT THE TARGETS AND WE CATCH HIM BEFORE HE ROBS. - YES, LIEUTENANT FOGLE, BEFORE HE STRIKES AGAIN. GOOD WORK, SAM. LET'S IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL TARGETS. TAKE ALL THE RESOURCES YOU NEED. - THANK YOU, SIR. FOGLE, GO BACK TO OUR OFFICE, MAKE A LIS OF POTENTIAL TARGETS. START WITH THE DA VINCI EXHIBI AND THEN WORK FROM THERE. I'M GOING TO GO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE FENCE AND I'LL PICK UP A PIZZA ON THE WAY BACK. - WHY DO I GOTTA DO THE DESK WORK? - CHIEF, YOU DID SAY TAKE ALL THE RESOURCES I NEED, RIGHT? - IF YOU CONSIDER FOGLE A RESOURCE, YOU'RE WELCOME TO HIM. - I AM A RESOURCE. - COME ON. - WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TOAST, SWEETHEART? - NO, THANKS. - WELL, EAT YOUR FRUIT, THEN. - WHY HASN'T DAD BEEN AROUND FOR BREAKFAST? - YOU KNOW HE'S ON A BIG CASE. I DON'T THINK HE'S BEEN HOME FIVE HOURS ALL WEEK. - IS HE ON A STAKEOUT? - I THINK SO. I THINK HE'S HAVING TO SLEEP IN HIS CAR. - WOW. - I HEAR LENORE'S FAMILY IS MOVING. THAT'S A SHAME. I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LIKE HER. - [chokes] MOM, I'M TRYING TO EAT HERE. - ALL RIGHT. WELL, SHE WAS YOUR RECEPTIONIST. AND I THINK YOU SHOULD GO TO HER PARTY TODAY. - BUT I'M GROUNDED UNTIL MONDAY. - I DECIDED TO GIVE YOU TIME OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR. IF YOU MAKE SURE THAT TEN IS ZIPPED UP BEFORE YOU GO. - I'M JUST GOING TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO CODY. [crickets chirping] - I'D NEVER ADMIT IT, BUT I WAS GOING TO MISS LENORE. SHE WAS A GOOD DAME, AND SHE HAD A GREAT DOG. I'M SORRY YOU'VE GOT TO LEAVE, LENORE. - HA! I KNEW YOU LIKED HER. - NOW YOU KNOW WHY I HAVE AN INNER MONOLOGUE. [dramatic orchestral music] - YOU GOT ANYTHING, MARTINSON? - A COUPLE DUMPSTER DIVERS AND A STRAY DOG. THAT'S IT. - THIS HAS GOT TO BE HIS NEXT TARGET, FOGLE. IF THE CAT IS STILL HERE, HE'S GOING TO WANT A SHO AT THAT DA VINCI EXHIBIT. - MAYBE HE KNOWS WE'RE WATCHING HIM. IF I WERE THE CAT, I'D BE HITTING OVER AT THE ANTIQUE SHOP. WINDSOR HEIGHTS. A LOT LESS SECURITY OVER THERE. - LESS RISK, LESS REWARD. AND I THINK THE CAT WOULD LIKE THE CHALLENGE. - OKAY. [melancholy orchestral music] - I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D MAKE IT. - WELL, MY MOM GAVE ME TIME OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR. - HOW'D YOU PULL THAT OFF? A GOING-AWAY PRESENT? THANKS. I'LL GET CODY. MEET ME BEHIND THE SWING SET. - DIDN'T THINK I'D SEE YOU ON THE STREET SO SOON, SAM. - BEAT IT, MELVIN. - I GUESS SAM HAD TALKED HIMSELF OU OF WHATEVER PUNISHMEN HIS MOM HAD-- - MELVIN, I'M THE ONE WITH THE INNER MONOLOGUE. [sighs] - FOLLOW ME, AND DON'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS. - MY CURIOSITY HAD THE BEST OF ME. I KEPT MY MOUTH SHU AND FOLLOWED. I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOU PLAYING KISSY FACE WITH LENORE, BUT I FIGURED CODY WOULD KEEP ME OUT OF TROUBLE. - NOW YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS. - WHAT? HOW? WHY? - RIGHT, WELL, MY GRANDFATHER OWNS THIS LAND, AND MY DAD BUILT THIS FOR ME SO I WOULD HAVE A CLUBHOUSE. HE DIDN'T WANT ME WORKING FOR A PRIVATE DETECTIVE. EVEN THOUGH WE'RE MOVING, GRANDPA SAYS THE CLUBHOUSE IS STILL MINE, AND SINCE I WON'T BE HERE TO USE IT, I'M LEASING IT TO THE JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY. - BUT THERE IS NO JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY. MOM AND DAD SHUT IT DOWN, REMEMBER? AND WITH YOU GONE, WHAT'S THE POINT? - YOU'RE SWEET, SAM, BUT YOU'LL FIND ANOTHER RECEPTIONIST, AND AS FAR AS YOUR PARENTS ARE CONCERNED, SINCE IT'S NOT IN THEIR GARAGE, HOW WILL THEY KNOW IF THE AGENCY IS BACK? - [sighs] I DON'T KNOW. WOW. - WOW IS RIGHT, AND IT'S ALL YOURS IF YOU CAN PAY THE RENT. - WHAT'S RENT? - ONE KISS ON THE LIPS. - I SUPPOSE ONE KISS ISN'T GOING TO KILL ME. AT LEAST, I HOPE NOT. NOT A WORD OF THIS TO ANYONE, LENORE. NOT A WORD! [spirited orchestral music] - WELL, GANG, HERE WE ARE. OUR NEW HOME. - OH, I LOVE IT. - DO YOU MIND IF I LOOK AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD? - YEAH, I GUESS IT'S ALL RIGHT, BUT STAY ON THIS BLOCK. IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE HOUSE, YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR, ALL RIGHT? - AND DON'T BE GONE TOO LONG. I'M GOING TO WANT YOUR HELP UNPACKING THE KITCHEN, OKAY? - ALL RIGHT. [charming acoustic music] [kids laughing] - HEY, SHE'LL UNDERSTAND SOMEDAY. DADDY HAD TO GET A JOB TO PUT A ROOF OVER OUR HEADS AND FOOD ON THE TABLE. - YEAH, SOMEDAY. - LOTS OF KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. - YOU SEE? I KNEW YOU'D LOVE IT HERE. - CAN I HELP CARRY SOME BOXES IN THE HOUSE? - SURE, UH, GRAB THAT ONE THERE BY THE FLOWERPO AND BRING IT INTO THE KITCHEN. - WATCH OUT FOR THE MOVERS. - GOT IT? ALL RIGHT, THANKS. - HOME SWEET HOME. - HEY, GANG. - I WAS HOPING YOU'D MAKE IT. - I GOT SOMEBODY TO COVER FOR ME TONIGHT. I WANTED TO HAVE DINNER WITH MY FAMILY. IT IS SO NICE TO HAVE A MEAL WAITING FOR ME. - WELL, WE WERE KIND OF COUNTING ON YOU. - SO, UH, DID YOU SOLVE THE CASE? - DON'T INTERROGATE YOUR FATHER, AND, PLEASE, TAKE YOUR ELBOWS OFF THE TABLE WHILE YOU EAT. - WHAT'S THE SCOOP ON THE CAT? - WE WERE ON A STAKEOUT, SON. NOTHING GLAMOROUS. JUST WAITING FOR THE CA TO MAKE HIS MOVE. - WHAT THEN? - HOPEFULLY WE CATCH HIM IN THE ACT. - THAT'D BE PRETTY COOL. - HEY, I SAW A MOVING TRUCK DOWN AT THE OLD MILLS HOUSE TODAY. I GUESS SOMEONE'S FINALLY MOVING IN. - MAYBE WE SHOULD GO DOWN THERE AND INTRODUCE OURSELVES. - WELL, THAT WOULD BE NICE WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE TIME. SO HOW WAS LENORE'S PARTY TODAY? - PARTY? - UH, YEAH, DAD. LENORE'S MOVING. HER DAD GOT TRANSFERRED TO ST. LOUIS. - AND SHE HAD A GOING-AWAY PARTY TODAY, AND I MADE AN EXECUTIVE DECISION TO LET SAM GO. - THAT'S FINE. SO HOW WAS IT? - UH, GOOD. YOU KNOW, FRIENDS, FOOD. A PARTY. - WELL, I KNOW YOU TWO WERE CLOSE. I'M SORRY YOUR FRIEND IS MOVING. - HEY, MAYBE OUR NEW NEIGHBORS HAVE A CHILD YOUR AGE, HONEY. - HEY, HEY. NAPKIN. SO, HONEY, ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT TOMORROW? FIRST DAY ON A NEW JOB? - YEAH, SURE. FIRST DAY'S ALWAYS EXCITING. I JUST DON'T LIKE BEING THE NEW GUY. I'VE GOT TO PROVE MYSELF ALL OVER AGAIN. - YOU'LL DO GREAT, DADDY. - THANKS, SWEETHEART. - HEY, DON'T GET USED TO PIZZA, YOUNG LADY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT KITCHEN READY TO COOK IN TOMORROW NIGHT, ALL RIGHT? - WELL, I GOTTA GET UP IN A LITTLE WHILE. I'M GOING TO GRAB A SHOWER AND GO TO BED. - ALL RIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. - GOOD JOB TODAY, DEAR. - THANKS, DADDY. - GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE IN A BETTER MOOD. - I JUST REALIZED HOW LUCKY WE ARE. THAT'S ALL. - WHY DON'T YOU FINISH UP THAT SLICE AND THEN HELP ME MAKE UP THE BED FOR DADDY SO HE'S GOT A COMFORTABLE PLACE TO SLEEP, OKAY? - ALL RIGHT. - OKAY. - OH, CHERI. TRES BIEN. AH, YES. YOU MAY HAVE FIGURED IT OUT, BUT YOU WILL NOT STOP ME. [chuckles] PAS MAINTENANT, PAS JAMAIS. THEY MAY HAVE FIGURED IT OUT, BUT THEY WILL NEVER CATCH ME. NOT NOW, NOT EVER. - STEELE AND FOGLE, ALL CLEAR ON THE BACK END. I'M TAKING OFF. - THANKS, MARTINSON. WE'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE. - SO HOW WAS DINNER WITH THE FAMILY? - WONDERFUL. I HADN'T SEEN SAMMY SINCE WE GROUNDED HIM. - HOW'D JUNIOR TAKE THE WHOLE SHUTTING DOWN OF THE DETECTIVE AGENCY? - VERY WELL. I THINK IT'S JUST A PHASE ANYWAY. BESIDES, HIS RECEPTIONIS GOT TRANSFERRED TO ST. LOUIS. - WHO HIRES A TEENAGE RECEPTIONIS AND THEN PAYS TO MOVE HER TO ST. LOUIS? - HER DAD GOT TRANSFERRED, GENIUS. SHE'S NOT REALLY A RECEPTIONIST. - I KNEW THAT. - LESS TALK, MORE STAKEOUT. [warm orchestral music] - HA. [clicks tongue] - AH, I SEE YOU MET DOUG THE DOG. - YEAH, I GUESS SO. - HOW YOU DOING? I'M DEPUTY CHIEF CARR. YOU MUST BE DAVE MARSH. - THAT'S RIGHT. READY TO GET STARTED, SIR. - AH, GOOD TO HAVE YOU ABOARD, DAVE. LISTEN, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE TOUR OF THE PLACE AND THEN I'LL LET YOU GET SETTLED IN, OKAY? - GREAT. THAT IS AN EXCELLENT DOG. - AH, YEAH, WELL, DON'T GET TOO ATTACHED TO HIM. NEW REGULATIONS AT THE FIREHOUSE: NO DOGS. - [panting] - DOUG WILL BE GONE BY THIS WEEKEND. - GOT A GOOD HOME TO GO TO? - NO, NOT YET. I'D TAKE HIM HOME MYSELF, BUT I GOT THREE DOGS. MY WIFE WOULD KILL ME. LISTEN, LET ME GET YOU SETTLED IN. WE'LL GO UPSTAIRS AND MEET SOME OF THE GUYS. - GREAT. - BE GOOD, DOUGIE. [tranquil orchestral music] - HELLO, MY NAME IS KATHY STEELE. - WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? [angelic harp music] - MY FAMILY AND I LIVE JUST DOWN THE STREET. - I'M CASEY MARSH, AND, UH, THIS RUDE LITTLE GIRL IS EMMA. - YOU GOT A NAME, SHORT STUFF? - MUFFINS. I-I MEAN SAM. SAM STEELE JR. - THAT IS SO NICE. WHAT DO YOU SAY, EMMA? - THANKS, MUFFINS. - HERE'S A BASKE FULL OF SOME SHAMPOOS AND SOAPS JUST IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T UNPACKED YET. JUST OUR WAY OF SAYING WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. - OH, THANK YOU, KATHY. I'D INVITE YOU IN, BUT THE HOUSE IS SUCH A MESS RIGHT NOW. - OH, NO WORRIES, CASEY. WHEN YOU GET SETTLED IN, JUST GIVE US A CALL, WE'LL HAVE YOU OVER FOR A COOKOUT. I KNOW YOU'RE JUST GOING TO LOVE THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. - YEAH. - [chuckles] I'M SURE WE WILL. - OUR PHONE NUMBERS AND ADDRESSES ARE IN THE BASKET, SO JUST GIVE US A CALL IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A BREAK. - OH, I'M SURE WE WILL. THANK YOU AGAIN. - YES, VERY NICE. - THAT WENT WELL. - BE RIGHT BACK. [gentle orchestral music] - HEY, YOU GUYS, LOOK WHA I FOUND AT THE FIREHOUSE. [laughs] - DAVE. - OH, COME ON, HONEY. THEY WERE GOING TO GET RID OF HIM, AND NOW, UH, DOUG, IS GOING TO MAKE OUR LITTLE GIRL HAPPY. - DOUG? - YEAH. AND MAKE SURE YOU TAKE CARE OF HIM. - OH, DON'T WORRY, DADDY. I WILL. - ALL RIGHT. - YOU STAY HERE. I'M GOING TO WALK THROUGH THE MUSEUM AND CHECK THINGS OUT. - HEY, CAN YOU GET ME A SMOOTHIE AT THE CONCESSION STAND WHILE YOU'RE IN THERE? I'M FEELING A LITTLE PECKISH. - NO. - I TRUST EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER, DETECTIVE. - SO FAR, SO GOOD. HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING WITH THE DA VINCI EXHIBIT? - RIGHT ON SCHEDULE. I'D SHOW YOU AROUND, BUT THE ROOM IS UNDER LOCKDOWN WHILE THE EXHIBI IS BEING PREPARED. WHY DON'T WE HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE TO DISCUSS YOUR SECURITY PLANS? - LEAD THE WAY. - OKAY. I'M GLAD YOUR DEPARTMEN IS KEEPING AN EYE ON US. - WE WANT TO CATCH HIM IN THE ACT, MS. CARMICHAEL. I'M HOPING THE EXHIBI AND THE CHALLENGE OF YOUR SECURITY WILL LURE HIM IN. - DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS YOU'RE WATCHING THE MUSEUM? - WE'VE TRIED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE, BUT I'M SURE HE SUSPECTS ADDITIONAL SECURITY, ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TARGET IN TOWN. - WE CONSIDERED MOVING I OUT OF THE CITY, BUT GREAT ART WILL ALWAYS ATTRACT GREAT THIEVES. NO USE RUNNING FROM THEM. - THE GREAT ART OF DES MOINES HAS ATTRACTED THE CA SEVERAL TIMES. I JUST HOPE IT DOESN' HAPPEN AGAIN. [dubious instrumental music] - HEY. - HI, SWEETHEART. HEY, I NOTICED A LO OF BACK AND FORTH TO LENORE'S HOUSE TODAY. MIND TELLING YOUR MOTHER WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT? - UH, YEAH, I WAS JUS RETURNING SOME STUFF THAT BELONGED TO LENORE. THE MOVING TRUCK WAS GETTING READY TO LEAVE HER HOUSE, SO... - DID YOU HAPPEN TO GIVE HER YOUR TRENCH COAT AND FEDORA? BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM LATELY. - UM, YEAH. YOU KNOW, SHE LOVED THE JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY SO MUCH, I WANTED TO GIVE HER SOMETHING TO REMEMBER IT BY. - AREN'T YOU A THOUGHTFUL BOY? mwah! I'M GOING TO GO GET US SOME TEA, FOR MY HARDWORKING, THOUGHTFUL SON. - I'D NEVER LIED TO MY MOTHER, AND I DIDN'T LIKE THE TASTE OF IT, BUT THE JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY WAS GOING TO BE BACK IN BUSINESS. - THERE MUST HAVE BEEN ANOTHER DOG AROUND HERE, HUH, DOUG? JUST DON'T DO NUMBER TWO AGAIN. I'M RUNNING OUT OF BAGS. WELL, IF IT ISN'T MUFFINS. - IT'S SAM. SAM STEELE JR., TO BE EXACT. HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A DOG. - I DIDN'T TILL TODAY. DAD GOT DOUG FOR ME AT THE FIRE STATION. - DOUG. THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD NAME FOR A DOG. - I DIDN'T THINK OF IT. HE SHOWED UP WITH THAT NAME. - HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAVE TO TAKE MY GLASS BACK INSIDE. YOU MIND IF I HELP YOU WALK DOUG AFTER THAT? - WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO HELP ME WALK DOUG? - WELL, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT I'D SHOW YOU SOME OF THE COOLER PARTS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT IF YOU DON'T, THAT'S FINE. - HURRY UP. AND BRING SOME SANDWICH BAGS. - HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WHAT'S THE RUSH? - EMMA MARSH GOT A NEW DOG. I'M HELPING HER WALK I AND SHOWING HER AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD. - WELL, AREN'T YOU JUST THE NICE NEIGHBOR? WAIT ONE MINUTE. LET ME SEE. WELL, THANK YOU FOR ALMOS CLEANING YOUR FACE. HAVE A GOOD TIME. - YEP. - WHAT IS THIS? - THIS IS THE WORLDWIDE HEADQUARTERS OF THE JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY. - WHAT'S A JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY? - COME ON. LET'S SEE WHAT'S INSIDE. [mischievous instrumental music] - VERY...NICE? I'VE GOT TO GO HOME NOW. - WAIT. I NEED A PARTNER IN THE AGENCY. I CAN'T DO IT ALONE. - YOU DON'T NEED ANY HELP SITTING OUT HERE READING COMIC BOOKS. - HEY, THE JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY DOES GOOD WORK. WE HELP KIDS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF BULLIES AND THIEVES. - YEAH, I BET IT'S A REAL CRIME WAVE AROUND HERE. - NOT ANYMORE. LISTEN, IT'S JUST YOU AND ME AND DOUG A FEW HOURS A DAY SOLVING CRIMES. - WELL, WHERE'S YOUR POWER SOURCE? AND DOES THIS CRATE HAVE WI-FI? - UM, NO. - WELL, IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS, WE'VE GOT TO DO IT RIGHT. I'VE GOT A LAPTOP WITH A SIX-HOUR BATTERY AND AN AIRCARD. - REALLY? - YEAH. JUST BECAUSE YOU FANCY YOURSELF A DETECTIVE FROM THE 1940s, THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T HAVE SOME 21ST-CENTURY TOYS. I WANT THE BIGGER DESK, AND DOUG IS GOING TO NEED A PLACE TO LAY DOWN. - THE BIGGER DESK IS MINE. - SURE, IF YOU WANT TO SI OUT HERE ALL ALONE. - [sighs] ANYTHING ELSE? - YEAH, DO WE GET PAID FOR SOLVING THESE, UM, CRIMES, OR ARE WE DOING VOLUNTEER WORK? - MY RATE IS 25 CENTS A DAY PLUS EXPENSES. - OUR RATE IS 50 CENTS A DAY. YOU GET 40%. I GET 40%. AND DOUG GETS 20%. - WAIT A SECOND. THAT MEANS YOU GET 60%. - WHAT DOUG DOES WITH HIS MONEY IS NONE OF YOUR CONCERN. - I SUPPOSE YOU WAN A TRENCH COAT AND FEDORA TOO. YOU'LL HAVE TO GET YOUR OWN. - OF COURSE. I'LL NEED A KEY FOR THE PADLOCK. MAKE ONE FOR ME, PLEASE? COME ON, DOUG. TOMORROW MORNING, 8:00 A.M. - THAT'S A LITTLE EARLY, DON'T YOU THINK? - JUSTICE DOES NO HIT THE SNOOZE BUTTON, SAM. - MARTINSON HERE. - THIS IS STEELE. - WE'VE CANVASSED THE ROOFTOP AND THE PERIMETER. ALL SECURE. - 10-4. WE'LL DO IT AGAIN IN ONE HOUR. I AM BEGINNING TO THINK THE CA HAS LEFT DES MOINES. - THAT WOULD BE SWEET. [mysterious orchestral music] [tense instrumental music] crack! - WHAT THE? [dubious accordion music] - [grunting] - THIS IS DETECTIVE STEELE. ALL POINTS, THE BARTLEBY MUSEUM HAS BEEN HIT! - THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. AS YOU KNOW, THE CA STRUCK AGAIN LAST NIGHT, THIS TIME TARGETING THE DA VINCI EXHIBI AND THE BARTLEBY ART MUSEUM. NOW, WHILE I REFUSE TO PLACE DIRECT BLAME ON ANY DETECTIVES CHARGED WITH SOLVING THIS CASE, IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT WE MUS GO IN A NEW DIRECTION. TO THAT END, THE MAYOR AND I ARE ANNOUNCING A TASK FORCE WHICH'LL BE LED BY THE NEWLY HIRED CHIEF OF DETECTIVES, JOEL MANGAL, WHO WILL BE IN CHARGE OF BRINGING THIS THIEF TO JUSTICE. ALSO, THE FBI HAS AGREED TO COME ON BOARD TO HELP US SOLVE THIS CASE. NOW, UH, I'LL TURN THE PODIUM OVER TO DETECTIVE MANGAL. - SO MY DAD WAS SEN TO THE BENCH. HE'D BE HOME TONIGHT, BUT HIS HEAD AND HIS HEAR WOULD BE SOMEWHERE ELSE. - WELL, THAT WAS PLEASANT. SO WHAT HAPPENED? - HE MUST HAVE HAD ACCESS THROUGH THE JANITORIAL AREA, MAYBE AS A SANITATION WORKER. - WELL, HE KNEW WHERE THE MUSEUM'S BACKUP GENERATOR WAS. THAT'S NOT IN THE BROCHURE. - A CLEANUP GUY WOULD HAVE TOTAL ACCESS. - TELL IT TO THE NEW TASK FORCE. THEY'RE ON THE JOB NOW, AND WE'RE NOT NEEDED. - FOGLE AND I COULD GO TALK TO THE SANITATION COMPANY THAT SERVICES THE MUSEUM. - THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. THAT NEW TASK FORCE WON'T WAN TO GET THEIR CUFFS DIRTY. - YEAH, AND THE FBI WON'T EITHER. - WELL, GENTLEMEN? THEY'RE NOT COMING HERE. [incredulous accordion music] - [sighs] LET ME SEE HERE... AH, OUI. ONLY ONE MORE TO GO AND IT'S THE EASIEST OF THEM ALL. - AND THIS JUST IN: CHIEF VAN OWEN HAS ANNOUNCED THAT A SPECIAL TASK FORCE HAS BEEN CREATED TO CAPTURE THE CAT, WHO, LAST NIGHT, BROKE INTO THE BARTLEBY MUSEUM. - A SPECIAL TASK FORCE, HUH? MAYBE MY LAST ROBBERY IN THIS QUAINT LITTLE TOWN SHOULD BE VERY SOON. HUH. [brooding instrumental music] - YOU'RE LATE. ruff! NOT A GOOD WAY TO START OUR NEW BUSINESS. - I SEE YOU FOUND YOUR DETECTIVE WARDROBE. - I HAVEN'T LIVED HERE VERY LONG, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE CA IS THE BIGGEST STORY IN TOWN. - YEAH, I WAS AT THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS THIS MORNING. THEY ASSIGNED A NEW TASK FORCE TO TRY TO CATCH HIM. - I KNOW, AND IT SEEMS YOUR DAD ISN'T ON THE CASE ANYMORE. - HE'S ON THE CASE. HE'S JUST NO PART OF THE TASK FORCE. - I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING THIS CAT PERSON-- A ONE-MAN DES MOINES CRIME WAVE-- AND THE POLICE ARE NO CLOSER TO CATCHING HIM THAN THEY WERE ON DAY ONE. - LOOK, IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME MAD... - I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE YOU MAD, SAM. I WAS JUST THINKING THAT CATCHING THE CA MIGHT BE GOOD FOR OUR BUSINESS. - AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT? - WE OUTTHINK HIM. THAT'S HOW. MOM WANTS ME HOME TO DO SOME CHORES. CALL ME WHEN YOU WANT ME BACK HERE. - I HAD TO ADMIT IT: THE KID HAD MOXIE. ONE DAY ON THE JOB AND SHE WANTED TO TAKE ON THE CAT. - SAM, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU ALL MORNING. - JUST GETTING SOME EXERCISE ON MY BIKE. WHAT'S FOR LUNCH? - SANDWICHES, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SERVE YOURSELF. I'M ON MY WAY DOWNTOWN TO SEE YOUR FATHER FOR LUNCH. NO COMPANY WHILE I'M GONE. AND IF YOU LEAVE, LOCK THE DOOR, OKAY? I'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR. [bell ringing] [dramatic orchestral music] [siren blaring] [bangs on door] - YOU ALL RIGHT, MA'AM? - OH, I'M SO SORRY. I WAS COOKING A ROAS AND GOT PREOCCUPIED IN THE BACKYARD. WELL, NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THE ROAST IS BURNING. THERE'S SMOKE ALL OVER THE KITCHEN. - SO THERE'S NO FIRE THAT YOU CAN SEE? - OH, HEAVEN FORBID, NO. JUST A BURNT ROAST. I'M TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO COOK BUT FAILING, I'M AFRAID. - WELL, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHECK IT OU JUST THE SAME, MA'AM. - OH, OF COURSE. PLEASE, COME ON IN. - AGENT 170 TO RADIO. IT'S GOING TO BE A FALSE ALARM. FOOD ON THE STOVE. AGENT 170 HAS CONTROL. CANCEL ALL THE RESPONDING UNITS. - I GUESS I SHOULD BE HAPPY OUR ALARM SYSTEM IS SO SENSITIVE, BUT I DO HATE TO BE THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF. - I GOT IT DOWN HERE, MARSH! CHECK, UH, THE UPSTAIRS. [suspicious orchestral music] YOU GUYS EAT OUT A LOT? - OCCASIONALLY. - HI, SWEETHEART. SORRY I'M LATE. - IT'S OKAY. - SO WHAT HAVE THEY GOT YOU DOING NOW? - FOGLE AND I HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWING SANITATION WORKERS. WE'RE RELEGATED TO DESK DUTY. IT STINKS. - OH, SAM, IT'S JUST ONE CASE. YOU'LL BE BACK ON TOP BEFORE YOU KNOW IT. - NO, NO, NO. I FELT LIKE WE HAD THIS GUY FIGURED OUT, AND HE STILL GOT PAST US. I HAVE AN IDEA ABOU WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO NEXT, BUT NOBODY WILL LISTEN TO ME. [ominous orchestral music] - HERE'S YOUR WATER, SIR. ARE YOU READY TO ORDER? - AH, PAS MAINTENANT. - ALL RIGHT, WELL, WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. [crickets chirping] - HONEY, DON'T FEED DOUG FROM THE TABLE. - I'M NOT, MOM. HE MUST HAVE PICKED UP SOME BAD HABITS AT THE FIRE STATION. - SO WE HAD A FALSE AT THAT HUGE ART DECO MANSION. IT WAS AN AMAZING PLACE. - I LOVE DRIVING THROUGH THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. DID YOU GET A GOOD LOOK INSIDE? - ACTUALLY, I DID, AND IT WAS EVEN NICER ON THE INSIDE THAN ON THE OUTSIDE. I THINK THEY EVEN HAD A REAL MICHELANGELO. - A REAL MICHELANGELO? - ART EXPERT, COULD HAVE BEEN FAKE, I GUESS, BUT IT LOOKED REAL TO ME. - WELL, IF IT IS REAL, THEY BETTER HAVE GOOD SECURITY WITH THAT THIEF STILL ON THE LOOSE. - I'M SURE THEY DO, HONEY. THE FIRE ALARM SYSTEM WAS STATE OF THE ART. - CAN I BE EXCUSED? - ALL RIGHT, JUST HURRY BACK BEFORE YOUR DINNER GETS COLD. OKAY, HONEY? - MAYBE SHE'S NOT FEELING WELL. - SAM, YOU THERE? SAM? ARE YOU THERE? - YEAH, WHAT'S UP? - WE MAY HAVE A LEAD. MEET ME AT THE OFFICE AT 8:00 A.M. TOMORROW. - UGH, 8:00 A.M.? - THAT BOY IS LAZY. - [whimpers] - YES, YOU ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL. AND LIKE ALL BEAUTIFUL THINGS, YOU HAVE A WEAKNESS. I MUST FIND IT. - JUST MY LUCK TO HAVE A PARTNER WHO WAS RAISED ON A DAIRY FARM. [yawns] - I HOPE YOU'RE NOT TOO TIRED. WE'VE GOT A LATE NIGH AHEAD OF US. - WHAT'S THE STORY, MORNING GLORY? - MY DAD SAID HE SAW A MICHELANGELO AT A MANSION IN WEST DES MOINES YESTERDAY. IF IT'S REAL, THEN WE MAY HAVE THE CAT'S NEXT TARGET. - BUT WHO WOULD HAVE A MICHELANGELO IN A PRIVATE RESIDENCE IN DES MOINES? - DANIEL HARGROVE WOULD. HE'S THE CEO FOR A MULTINATIONAL COMPANY BASED HERE IN IOWA. AND HE'S AN ART COLLECTOR, ACCORDING TO HIS COMPANY BIO. - YEAH, I KNOW THE HARGROVE PLACE. I WENT THERE FOR A PARTY LAST YEAR. IT WAS FOR THEIR GRANDSON. - GOOD. SO YOU KNOW THE LAY OF THE LAND. - YEAH, BUT I NEVER SAW A MICHELANGELO, AND IF HE HAS ONE, WHY DOESN'T HE TELL ANYBODY? - PRIVACY? SECURITY? YOU NAME IT. AND IT'S PROBABLY IN THE ROOM WHERE THEY DON'T ALLOW FUDGESICLES. - WELL, IF THERE'S A MICHELANGELO THAT MIGHT BE STOLEN, WE NEED TO TELL MY DAD. - NOT YET. - WHY NOT? - IF WE TELL THE AUTHORITIES AND THE MICHELANGELO IS A COPY, WE LOOK LIKE IDIOTS. AND SO DOES YOUR DAD. - YEAH, WE NEED TO DO SOME LEGWORK OF OUR OWN. - RIGHT. STARTING TONIGHT. MEET ME IN YOUR BACKYARD AT 10:00 P.M. - BUT MY CURFEW'S 9:30. - SO WEAR YOUR FOOTIE PAJAMAS UNDER YOUR TRENCH COAT. JUST BE THERE. - WELL, I GUESS THE JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY REALLY IS BACK IN BUSINESS. - YOU LOOK LIKE A DETECTIVE. NOW LET'S START ACTING LIKE ONE. - SHE WASN'T AROUND WHEN I SOLVED THE CASE OF THE MISSING LUNCHBOXES, SO I GAVE HER A PASS. SHE WAS GOING TO SEE ME IN ACTION SOON ENOUGH. THEN, RESPECT. - QUIT TALKING TO YOURSELF AND MAKE SURE THE WALKIE-TALKIE BATTERIES ARE FRESH. - [sighs] - I CAN'T REMEMBER A TIME WHEN YOU'VE BEEN TO BED THIS EARLY, SWEETHEART. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE FEELING OKAY? - I'M FINE, MOM. I'M JUST...TIRED. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU HOME, DAD. - IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME, SON. - SLEEP TIGHT. - OKAY. [mischievous instrumental music] - ARE YOU GOING TO HANG THERE ALL NIGHT? - AH, YEAH. OKAY. OKAY. LET'S GET THE CAT. - HE'S, UM, THAT WAY. - OKAY, RIGHT. THE GATE'S LOCKED. NO WAY IN. - WE'LL FIND A WAY IN. COME ON. LET'S FIND A SPO TO STAKE OUT THE HOUSE. - [whimpers] [train clattering on tracks] [ominous orchestral music] - ONCE I GET OVER THE WALL, I'LL UNLOCK THE GATE. [grunting] thud! [cat meows] - FRONT GATE WAS OPEN. [mysterious orchestral music] - NICE BINOCULARS. - THANKS. DAD BOUGHT 'EM FOR ME AT A MILITARY SURPLUS STORE. - [Doug growls] - YOU'RE RIGHT, DOUG. SOMEONE'S IN THERE. AND IT'S NOT THE OWNERS. I WISH THE HARGROVES WERE HOME. WE'VE GOT TO CALL THE POLICE. - YOU CALL THE POLICE. HE'S GETTING AWAY. I'LL CALL YOU ON THE WALKIE-TALKIE AS SOON AS I KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING. - FIGURES. THE PHONE ONLY WORKS WHEN YOU DON'T NEED IT. COME ON, DOUG. LET'S GO FIND A SIGNAL. [frog croaks] - TOO EASY. [dubious accordion music] [engine turning over] - POLICE? HELLO? MY NAME'S EMMA MARSH, AND I JUS SAW THE CAT COMMIT A ROBBERY. HELLO? HELLO? - MRS. STEELE! MR. STEELE! - EMMA? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - WHAT HAVE YOU AND SAM BEEN UP TO? - OH, HONEY, WE PUT SAM IN THE TENT HOURS AGO. HE'S ASLEEP. - THAT'S NOT RIGHT, IS IT, EMMA? - WE'RE THE JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY, AND WE THOUGHT WE KNEW WHERE THE CAT WOULD STRIKE NEXT, AND WE WERE RIGHT. HE ROBBED THIS MANSION, AND NOW SAM'S IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR, AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE SAM IS. - WHAT? - WHERE IS THE HOUSE THAT WAS ROBBED? - IT'S THE HARGROVE PLACE. - WHAT? - WHAT KIND OF CAR WAS IT? WHICH DIRECTION WAS IT HEADED? AND HOW LONG AGO DID YOU LAST SEE IT? - IT'S AN OLD MUSCLE CAR. A FORD GALAXIE. 1960s. BURGUNDY. HEADED WEST ON BERGER ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO. - GO HOME, EMMA. LET THE POLICE TAKE I FROM HERE. WE'LL FIND HIM, KATHY. EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT. - I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LET HIM SLEEP IN THAT TENT. - FOGLE, I'LL BE IN FRON OF YOUR HOUSE IN TEN MINUTES. WE GOT A LEAD ON THE CAT. - BUT WE'RE NOT ON THE CASE ANYMORE. - DO IT. [distressing instrumental music] - WHAT HAVE WE GOT, PARTNER? - I'VE ALREADY GO AN ALL POINTS OU ON A BURGUNDY MID-'60s FORD GALAXIE, AND THE TASK FORCE IS AT THE ESTATE. - CHIEF DOESN'T WANT US ANYWHERE NEAR THE TASK FORCE. - I'M NOT GOING THERE. I'M GOING TO FIND SAMMY. [somber orchestral music] [anxious instrumental music] - [chuckles] mwah! RESTEZ. [sighs] [laughs] BIEN, BIEN. OH, MY DARLINGS. YOU MUST WAIT HERE. PAPA WILL RETURN FOR YOU IN A FEW WEEKS, YOU SEE, WHEN THE HEAT IS OFF, AND THE POLICE, THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THE JAYWALKER. OH, SWEETHEART. OH, MY MING VASE, IT IS YOU I WILL MISS MOST OF ALL. THE WAY YOU CURVE... OH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? OPEN THIS DOOR, HUH? YOU DO NOT KNOW WHO YOU ARE TROUBLING WITH! WHO ARE YOU? - I'M SAM STEELE JR., AND YOU'RE UNDER ARREST! - I CANNOT HEAR YOU. MAYBE IF YOU OPEN THE DOOR, HUH? - AH, SURE. HEY. I'M NOT FALLING FOR THAT. I COULDN'T SEE THE LOOK ON HIS FACE, BUT I'M SURE THE CAT WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN HE HAD BEEN OUTSMARTED BY SAM STEELE JR. - SAM, ARE YOU THERE? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? SAM? - EMMA. EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL. THE CAT IS MY PRISONER. HEY, WHY DON'T YOU WAKE UP MY DAD AND TELL HIM THAT THE RES OF HIS CAREER IS WAITING FOR HIM AT THE DES MOINES MINI WAREHOUSE COMPLEX. - WILL DO, SAM STEELE JR., PRIVATE DETECTIVE. MRS. STEELE! HE'S ALL RIGHT! - THANK GOODNESS. WHERE IS HE? - HE'S AT THE DES MOINES MINI WAREHOUSE COMPLEX, AND HE'S CAPTURED THE CAT. - OH! OH, MY. AND IT'S ALMOST DAWN. I'M GOING TO CALL HIS FATHER. THANK YOU, EMMA. - DOUG, WE DID IT. - HE'S IN HERE. - I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU. YOU ARE GROUNDED FOR A YEAR. thud! - HE'S BEEN COMPLAINING ALL NIGHT. WHY DON'T YOU LET HIM OUT? - CAT! WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED. IF YOU HAVE A WEAPON, PUT IT DOWN. WE'LL SEE HOW MANY LIVES YOU HAVE. - HANDS ON YOUR HEAD! STEP FORWARD. - THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL "SURROUNDED"? - WE LIED. - MUST BE WHERE HE'S KEEPING ALL THE LOOT. KEEP IT TILL ALL THE HEA WAS OFF. - [sighs] AND I SUPPOSE THIS IS THE PRIVATE EYE WHO CAPTURED ME, HUH? - YES, SIR, MR. CAT. YOU'RE JUST A VICTIM OF SOME GOOD OLD-FASHIONED DETECTIVE WORK. - THERE'S A SCOOTER INSIDE. CAN I HAVE I IF IT'S NOT STOLEN? - DIBS ON THE SCOOTER. - DIBS. DIBS. I HATE DIBS. - I NEVER BELIEVED THAT BEING A GOOD DETECTIVE WAS HEREDITARY, BUT WHERE DETECTIVE SAM STEELE AND HIS SON ARE CONCERNED, THAT IS THE CASE. NOW, DETECTIVE STEELE AND, TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT, DETECTIVE FOGLE HAVE MADE US PROUD BY STAYING ON THE CASE AND MAKING THE ARRES OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS THIEF EVER TO VICTIMIZE THE GOOD CITIES OF DES MOINES AND WEST DES MOINES. AND FROM THIS DAY ON, ANY TIME I HAVE A CASE THAT NEEDS SOLVING, I WON'T HESITATE TO CALL ON THE JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY. NOW, SAM AND EMMA AND DOUG HAVE PROVEN THEIR WORTH TO THIS DEPARTMENT. NOW THE MAYOR WILL PRESEN THE MEDALS OF HONOR. [applause] [mischievous orchestral music] [phone rings] - JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY. EMMA MARSH SPEAKING. OH, YES, SIR, MR. MAYOR. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. THE MAYOR'S DAUGHTER LOST HER EARRINGS AT THE MALL. SHE WANTS US TO LOOK INTO IT. - HMM. - TO THE SCOOTER. ruff! Captioning by CaptionMax [brassy detective music]
