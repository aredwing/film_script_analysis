This might explain why we never came up in the next class. - Do we have things we need to move? - No. Frank does not know the new locations. Now what we do here. We go out and talk to all and ask them to spread the word. The whole town must know that the person who Wagner shoots, gets half a million. - Where do you get the money from? - It's my problem. It is important that in explaining them, that we clear our own shit up. Whatever they say, it is us who have suffered the most. - Not too? - Yes. We'll fix that. Come on. Everything in me says, "Go your way. Leave him power of now. " - I understand. - Do you? Really? My life does not shit without you. - Sorry, but you have to see this. - What is it? I ...

These are images from an ATM on the other side of the street. And that ... Frank Wagner. Is not he suspected of police murder in Gothia Towers? Exactly. Look at his hand. A corpse, an armed Frank Wagner. Same time, near the crime scene. This is due to the investigation. But I still believe that you should show this to your department. No. Try to see here. This is 70 minutes later. Without a machine further up the street. It's Falk. Therefore, you have the right, not my department. You should also know that Falk said to me that he helped a friend. Now you see. It's Frank Wagner. I do not know, but ... It's a little uncomfortable. What the hell do we do now? We do what we always do. We do our job. Send from witness protection. Tell management who codename Lisa is. We must act, as if Frank has been revealed. Drag your resignation back. You are crucial as Franks contact. No, it's not going to happen. I is only responsible for Frank. Send a witness protection I send a text message with the address. Do we know if he is revealed or can it may be a criminal showdown?

They say that it's serious. - Where is she? - At Sahlgrenska. - Come on. - I'll call you later. Frank. A colleague from GSI has been shot. It can not be a coincidence. I must leave immediately. Do not wait for witness protection. Go ahead. Where? - How? We have no money. - What is most important? Go ahead. We do not know if I revealed. If I have it, we must have money. Okay. I need to check something. I'll be back. Well, keep me informed about everything. - Hanging shot episodes together? - We do not know. It was Patrik Agrell from GSI. Frank Wagner has worked for us as infiltrator for six years. Wagner is code named Lisa. Johan Falk is his contact. But Wagner's suspected of having shot one of Falk's colleagues. According to Agrell is it just a rumor which GSI has created. Falk and Wagner has developed something which is more than purely professionally. Hey, it's Sophie. I can not pick up the phone but please leave a message. Sophie, damn. Call now to me. Dyke was said with love and respect. I need to know what it says in the papers. Ring. Seth! - How are you? - Jo ... The fucking stick! Seth, your ok the pimp. Therefore, I will pay it as necks him. How shit I'm on. - You're going to be accountable. - I is not accountable for anything. But you were perhaps a little tentative Values ??of Frank Wagner's head. Or should I tell you will not? What message would it send? 100,000 to that necks him. - Yes? - It's your contact Johan Falk. Sophie's been shot. Say a place where we can meet. - Who has shot Sophie? - Why chase the Wagner? - He has given half of the city. - It is you who is a police informer. I have givetjer three fucking tip. He has worked for you for several years. - Drop it. How did Sophie it? - How do you know? You keep your mouth shut and listen to me.

Not mine, but those in've written about Wagner. Sounds codename Lisa familiar? With police stamp and all this shit. So now you must leave me in peace. And you dispose of with my papers. Ready. Okay? - It is Helen. - Hey, it's me. - I just wanted to ask if everything is okay. - How are you? I thought ... Yes, I ...

Yes, he was wearing ... ... balaclava and dark clothing. How some military pants. With pockets on the legs. You take care of the girls. So we take care of the other. How does that work? Signal inertia is almost identical with the body in the apartment. If they are more, it's a gang. If it's a gang, then they should vei be on your hate list? Stop it. Not if they are from Eastern Europe. We must look at all cases with Eastern Europeans. Law Firm Fredrixon. Hello. Fredrixon. I have a time in the archive. Just a moment please.

There are not many taxpayers. Our best infiltrator is revealed. Your name is on the agreement. You approved it. Why? Have you heard about public law? Everyone has the right to read it here. Up to and including lawyers. But it is marked secret. Have you taken over principle right, foolish decisions? Yes.

Russian iejemorder residing in Estonia. A very loyal friend. He worked shown for Andrej Dudayev. Pis. I begin to understand, how this is related. Lill-Gnistan and Annica, I must go now. It's nothing personal, but because of the civil servants. Go home. Turn off the gps `s in all of our cars. Start with Johan. - Where is Marie and Calle? - At Scandic Crown. This time, we say it is not to anyone. Forget it with money. Listen ... I have 9-10000 you can get. Thank you, Johan. It's perfect. Then I can just pull me back and perhaps open a hotel chain. On the Riviera. I also have a helicopter. MEET ME AT RDASEN That's the plan. I must meet Frank and Johan and brief them. I will help them, but it is illegal. If you do not feel comfortable with it, you should be here in the office. - I had even done previously. - I trust you, Patrik. No, I will not be seeking it here. I'll stay here in the office. If police lawyers not can protect our informants, - - We might as well drop his pants and bend us forward for the pigs. So I'm on. I see. I know what I must do. I would have liked you, but you do what is right. Check how it goes with Sophie. Agrell! - What's this I hear about Frank? - You're his uncle? Ove? Motherfucker! It's okay. I have heard that Frank works for you. Has he ever been delinquent? And now I hear, that the pigs will not help him now. - Instead, he called for. - You've heard almost right. Management is not on his side, but we working with him, helping him. I understand you're angry. I have kept silent about it for so long, so why should I believe you? You can ask him yourself. Do you want to? - And no file number? - No, it is located in one of the boxes. - Some of our old cases. - Godfather. A single note at 3-400 boxes. - How many weeks in? - Will you help us? - No, my coffee gets cold. - Yes, it may not happen. Come on. I am looking for Agrell. - He's out. - Everyone is out. You must help me. Falk protect a suspected murderer. I must get hold of Patrik, otherwise it goes completely to hell. - He's out. - He's out? That's all I know. Thank you. I'm sorry for all the crap we have been saying all these years. I probably said something worse. - Thank you to have kept him alive. - It is he very well though. - What about Christian? - I can not get hold of him. Maybe he's at the station. Our Estonian colleagues Unrecognized body. An assassin working for the Estonian-Russian mafia, Karayan. Over there is zero. Three years since we shot a robber over there. The assassin, that you took care of this morning - - Worked for Karayans ringleader, Andrej Dudayev. Big Brother Alex Dudayev, who we shot. Head of Karayan in Sweden. - The person who shot the boss's little brother ... - It was Sophie. Frank has done business with Alex and informed us. Can you reveal a infiltrator like that? No, but we've taken Heads for Karayan in Sweden several times. Then they will know why we are so successful. We have a receipt. Signed by attorney Fredrixon, - - Who has represented some of Karayans men. Fredrixon has ist gossip in all feasibility studies, code named Lisa in. - Gossip? - The material is not presented. As no one knows exists, unless you go in the archive. If you are a little clever, that lawyers should be - - You might figure out who Lisa is. - By going through it all. - If he can just look at it? Often found the informant's name only on a paper in each case. One must compare Cases and find a common denominator. By process of elimination you can so find out who is Lisa. But it is a huge puzzle. You can not clear the archive. He must have copied it. - It is a breach of confidentiality. - We can not prove. What would Seth Rydell do? He also read our papers. He's probably gone with Karayan. It serves he's probably good money. Call Christian again. Was Alex Dudayev not former intelligence officer? according to Estonian police consists half of Karayan of the sort. People who are not nationals and lost the job when the Russians left. Ove Wagner again. His maternal uncle. Come on, uncle. Andrej Dudayev has worked in the GRU, Military Intelligence. Is it not likely to Fredrixon entrusted - - Collecting material while intelligence people through it. You have called Christian. Leave a message. - Has he responded to your call? - Yes, the first time. - When? - This morning. - Does he generally does not respond? - It is very strange. - What are you doing? - We drive. - Mobile died. - It is the battery. It does not last as long, when you're favoring a hidden line open. Or they are not stupid. Take my car to the hotel. They may have been software in your mobile via Christians mobile. - But then they have the ... - Taken Christian. What do we do? It's his brother. Maybe it's enough. Al respect for your dead brother, but a brother to a brother. It's not enough. Should we signal that we did not finish what we start? No, we're going to complete it all. At the masks. Bye, Christian Wagner. When I write reports, user only code names, right? - Are you sure? - Yes. Have you found the notification yet? We're closing. Have you found it? It's hopeless. - We'll fix it after the weekend. - Okay. Now you begin to think like a real cop. - Do you have it all? - Yes, all our. But all the other departments 're sitting ducks. We can not win all the matches today. I would like to talk about Sophie. - Alone or do the girls? - It's probably best for everyone attending. We can talk in my office. Falk from GSL. - They are gone. - How are you? He must get away from here as soon as possible. Can you go yourself? There is still no that follows. - Just go. - To the right of a precaution. No ... Not a thing. It is very strange. It's their big chance. - Did you check under the car? - In the car, under the car, everywhere. There is a legend. Just drive me to Frank. I need to speak with Frank now. Did they tell you? I know that you work for the police. I wish I had known three years ago, so mother had been told. - What have they done to you? - I thought they would kill me. They asked me to tell you something instead. They have mapped all of us. Me. You. They have everything. They know where our children go to school, where our wives are working. Everything! If you do not appear, they will get at you in other ways. And they do not stop, before they succeed. They have emptied my apartment for addresses, pictures, photo albums, camera. Beware, mobile, everything. Even banknotes with children's friends' phone numbers. I called Liselotte. She is so scared. She just cried. They said, they will start with my family. Christian ... I'll do it here. Do you hear? I'll do it here. Frank! Frank, wait a minute. - We'll fix it. - What the hell do you fix? What the hell do you fix? Want to write a few more papers that anyone can read? You've ruined it all. You have ruined my life. You've ruined Marie's life. You have destroyed Calles life. It's all ruined. Do you understand what I'm saying? I'll Never on ever see you again. - How are you? - One of the cars is seen. NI is coming. Well, when I turn to? They strike on 15 minutes. They know that can be operated and civilians. Think it's suicide. Seth is the only connection to Karayan. We can not wait until it passes. What will you do? What would you say to him? He'll kill you. We are running away. Sticks of ... My family's here. And we will never be able to relax. We will never fie us safe, so long as the pig is here. If something happens to me now ... No, listen. Listen. Look at me. If something happens to me now ... ... so should I just continue. Jo. You just travel. If you do not hear from me within two hours, - - Then you take Calle, You will go. I love you. I love you so much. Damn. We have a problem. Why the hell have we not thought on it? There is the backup of this. There are backups of all these files in the digital records. How stupid. So lawyers can also grab them that way? As long as they file number. I do not have access. Do you? It is the design project managers and investigators who have access. Then try to do it, we talked about, okay? Mother ... Mother ... Want to tell us something? What? I might tell something ... ... who will do when she gets home. Will not you tell that it was you, who saved her? Right now, I think she'll hear your voices. Johan Falk live simply but nicely. Get ready. We strike. Moving on. Roland similar admittedly Skipper Snot Finger quite a bit. "Take it easy," said the girl with braids. Zan ... You must ... If mom says it ... Stick to mom all the time, then it's all okay. Are they okay? I'm just going with these guys, and then I'll come as fast as I can. - Where is he? - He's gone. - When did he go? - It's your fault. Go now. Get out! Frank has bolted. Ham Fredrixon rolls around with our papers. I put a stop the fucking mafia lawyer. The alarm has gone by the front door. Someone has broken into. - How are you? - It is very uncomfortable. ENTRANCE CAMERA 2 It is NI. The national task force. - Kitchen guaranteed! - Living proof! - Why is Ni broken in with us? - Has something happened? They probably found the car, Frank came in. It's probably been reported stolen. Bill is with us now. - We booked a room more. - Good. Police looking for Wagner. So he's still out there. He is still our top priority. Thank you. Yes, the villa was empty. I told you. Johan will of course not let his family be involved in this. What are we doing? - I have already said no. - But it all depends on you now. I was not operated for to delete public documents. I'm on Johan's side, but he is not even in service anymore. - But you have been investigating. - I know what you have going in. It is not a game. in breaking the law. Sophie is in the hospital. It's all just completely wrong. Okay. Well, it's all completely wrong. The only thing going up in is Sophie. I go up to the pigs shot her. They shot her in the street the eyes of her daughters. Johan is out there and need help. We're just sitting here like idiots, and you say that it's all wrong. I do not understand why you will not do anything. You will not delete anything, Vidar. You swap just about the record numbers. We find a closed case and moves all the digital documents over. They do not disappear and will not be deleted. No one will only ever could find them. Wait. The shooting of Sophie North. The phones keep ringing. It's a bad time to go on. We have no theories about why she was shot. Let Sthlgren handle it. She says she is busy to find the head of GSI. No one knows where they are. You are the only one that can handle this. Okay. The officer was shot several times. The wounded officer's condition would be serious. Hello? We have no money for the restaurant. We can not meet you. I'm sorry. I'll call you back. Despite the heavy night and morning in Gothenburg - - The police management There are no comments. But Police Chief Lena Tornell - - Holds a press conference about the events. Vijay approves 200,000. - Have you heard anything? - No, but anyone knows where he is. - Sorry, it looks like a pigsty. - Do you spend wisely. So it is now. What an ugly bag. - There are more than 200,000. - There are actually 500,000. Jas. We clean up after yourself. - I've messed up! - It is you who have fucked you! I salute the way from Vijay. He got 10 years! Shit. Moment No, let it sit. - Your fucking snitch. - Yes, I'm a fucking snitch. Come on. Hold this. Wait here. - They have several informants. - Bye, Dad. You can even see in the new documents. I send them over a secure line. Well, and if I need to check other cases ... Can I call you back? What are you doing here? Do you know why we tolerate your kind? Because I just fit your work. But you have gone too far. Now there shall be no rules anymore. I have not done anything. Oh, damn it! You can not prove anything with a stolen mobile phone. I give a shit about evidence. What the hell are you doing? - What the hell have you done? - I have not been here. You're crazy. CODE NAME "LAILA" - You have to press hard. - Fuck, man. Satan. Share Russians. - Tell the Russians. - Why the hell would I do that? Because it determines whether I'll drop you off at a hospital or in a ditch. There is a lot of money in this case. A lot of money. I do not take them. I'll let you keep them. Although I desperately need them. Think of what it will mean to you. I have never done anything that has been directed at you. Everything I've done has been against your competitors. You will aliigevel ... you will ... never could find them. Why not? Because they drive around in a car. - What kind of car? - With sleeping bags and canned goods. A black van. A Chevrolet. An older model. I do not fucking. - How many are they? - I do not know. Four or five pieces. - That's me. Where are you? - On the outskirts of the city. - So you're alive. - For several hours at least. Russians run in a variety Chevrolet van, an older model. They have no fixed location, so we must try to take them. - Collect them you trust the most. - It will not be many. - No. Meet me at the concert hall. - Okay, I'll brief the others.
