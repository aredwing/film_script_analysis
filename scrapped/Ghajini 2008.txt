Forget this case. But it's such an interesting case. Interesting yes, but it's also a police case. But... Sunita, you want me to call your parents? Fine, I won't take it up. But as medical students, we want to know. Okay... That is Sanjay Singhania. Hit on the head with an iron rod. After the incident, he lost his memory. He is unable to remember anything now. We call it short term memory loss. He remembers events for only about 15 minutes. AfteRWards... he forgets everything. For example, he'd ask your name... and in 15 minutes he will have forgotten it. He recalls only fragments of the incident. But we can't say how much of it he remembers. Regular tasks like eating, drinking, driving, also his feelings... lie embedded in his sub-conscious mind. How does he go about his everyday routine? How does a child perform instructed tasks? By committing to memory, learning by rote. Or, by jotting things down in writing. Likewise, he remembers tasks by writing. What was that incident? Who assaulted him? This, no one knows. Unfortunately, he doesn't even recall a face. How can someone live on like this... I wonder, what he's doing this moment... Ghajini Killed, just like Mangesh. The second, this week. Even if I've to search every street, I'm going to get this one in 48 hours. Find out who... I must find him before the police gets to him. Where to? There... Orchard Avenue. Pin 400076. My street We're in Orchard Avenue. Take the next right. Odyssey. It's a building on your right.

He paid me with a five hundred note. I didn't have change. So I wrote it on the back. He forgot to take the change... hey, it must be him. Who...? This one always forgets. Sometimes he forgets to buy a ticket, sometimes it's the change. At times, he'll go on buying tickets. He keeps on asking the names of bus stops. Can you recognise him? - Why not... looks a strange sort, keeps his head shaven, has a long scar on the head. Every morning at ten, he takes the bus from Hiranandani. It's nine. We got an hour to get him. Come on. Take camera Bus 392 There he goes. Hey... Damn it. See you in the canteen after the lecture. Excuse me... excuse me, sir... Hi sir! I'm Sunita. Sunita.

Why is it beeping? It buzzes every 15 minutes. So that I can take photos... of important things, people... to inscribe on them, to remember. On photos? Yes. What are you doing? Making notes...

My mother was born in this city. I share a bond with this city. Here we are, in Air Voice. In my office. And they are my most trusted employees. Dad said, put all your emotions into work, don't get emotional about it. Across India, we're targeting a 500 million subscriber base. Are you shocked? I can achieve it. And I'm not being vain, I'm just confident. It's a fine line between vanity and confidence. That I can achieve, speaks my confidence. Only I can achieve, would speak of my vanity. We need confidence, let's build on it. Kindly leave vanity outside office. Thank you. Swing in the rhythm "Jhoom jhamak jhoom" Tap out the beat "Tum tamaak tum" Hey kiddo!

From Delhi to Bombay, he talked non-stop. Plain chatter. I could only listen on. Then all of a sudden, I love you. Will you marry me? I say, are you silly. Are marriages made in thin air?

Her words could make Spring blossom Her charm could make seasons spring Even her lies... are so endearing, she could make me believe illusions in all things Upon her many paths, praying, hoping, eager-eyed, musing fragrant shades of memories, I stand still and...

So... what's next? My boss is hosting a party tonight. Without even asking me, they sent out invites naming Sanjay as the chief guest.

Who goes to parties with chequebooks? What are you upto? Whose chequebook is that? Even for over-acting, this is too loud! Five hundred thousand? Have you gone mad? Thank you, sir. - All the best. I'm finished. I could kill you. Our leading model, Sonal. How do you do? - I'm very good. Kalpana has told us so much about you... - We all know that... there're others... That article of yours in Economic Times. - Not again, sir. Please... You... for Sanjay Singhania! And they fell for you? Am I'm too clever, or it's a world of fools? I love you. What? I love you. I want to marry you. What... so all of a sudden...? Not so... all of a sudden. I never thought... Give me time, to think. Shall I tell you tomorrow? If I say no, you won't take it badly? Bye. Happy new year. Happy new year. To her, I'm just an ordinary guy. I wish to remain this unexceptional man... who wins her love. So I haven't told her the truth about me.

If she refuses, then I remain Sachin... and I fade out of her life. All I await now, is tomorrow. This wait for a yes will keep me up tonight. This suspense is haunting, how can I sleep tonight? To what news my morning light will dawn, to melodies of love like rain? Or, is this thirst to go unquenched? Like a passion, unfulfilled You hold me in an ecstasy, thrilled And now, the consummation, of that ecstasy, in your arms, is all I wish from you In my heart of hearts, how I pine To splash you with my colours of life In every mood, to match my rhythm It's all I wish from you If only you say yes, then life... can spring forth from the fountainhead... to spew my pearls of life upon your path Consummation... of that ecstasy... in your arms... is all I wish My gossamer dreams are cast in glass As I ford my nights in dark Fearful, lest my fantasies shatter My hopes are inflamed Yet I fear, lest some tempest... puts out my flame I wait for a lone yes To turn on the springs ofjoy... in a culmination... of my dreams... in the ecstasy of your embrace It's all I wish I have my Moon, over me my skies Where dense dark clouds also hover I wish this Moon is never overcast A searing loneliness, a pacing heart, and not a moment's peace... make up a wonderful story of mine; I've only a restless yearning... for a passion unfulfilled, for an ecstasy, the thrill... of your embrace It's all I wish from you In my heart of hearts, how I pine To splash you with my colours of life In every mood, to match my rhythm It's all I wish from you If only you say yes, then life... can spring forth from the fountainhead... to spew my pearls of life upon your path For you, I thirst All night, I kept thinking. Until one o'clock it was, why you? By two o'clock, it was why not? At three am, am I rushing into this? At four, if not now then how will I ever...? By the time it got to five o'c lock, I had decided. I do. I love you. Now's my turn to tell her who I am. But you don't know who I am. What...! - When you get to know about my dad... it'll blow your brains. Is she talking my lines? Take this. In 1992, my dad had three Ambassador cars. Oh wow... - Oh yes. He had a travel agency. Shetty Travels. Shitty Travels? - Hey! Shetty... Travels. Yes... I see... Shetty Travels. - So. It was my uncle who cheated him. Ohh... He stole all three cars. Brokenhearted, my dad died. That day, I swore... until I buy three Ambassador cars, I won't marry. Three...? Can't it climb down by a couple or so? No way. If you can wait, then wait. OtheRWise, marry a girl of your class. I'll wait. Don't worry. Even after I'm rich, I'll still be the same to you, like I'm now. Promise? - Promise. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. A very happy new year to you. - Thank you. Mr Goenka has canceled for the day. The board meeting is at eleven thirty. The marketing presentation is post-lunch. Okay. Sir... what did she say when she got to know about you? I haven't told her. Why, sir? Because, in 1992... her dad had three Ambassador cars. Her uncle tricked her dad out of the cars. Now she wants to be richer than her uncle. Until then, she won't marry. What if you just told her...? She'd want to be richer than me... that'd be the end of my wedding. Truth is, I prefer to keep up this facade. I had bought this flat... as my gift to her... after telling her about me. It's not to be, but I got to give her the flat, somehow. That's your responsibility. It'll be done, sir. Thanks. May no one ever wish you ill. And your tank forever be petrol-ful. For me too... please. - Quiet! There's enough for everyone. For me, too? - Late, even today? You bought it? Yes... surprise. One in. Two more to go. - Great! I sold the jewellery meant for my wedding. Dear husband to-be, I don't think, you care for a dowry. So, I bought a car. Sure... it moves? Are you joking? Take a test drive. Come on, kids. Smooth drive, isn't it? Smooth roads. Hey...? Smooth as butter. The radio, there's one in there. It works! Hey, this car is mine! I just bought it. Nice, isn't it? - What a pretty car! Good news, sir. The fax is in from London. We've got the licence. All calls to UK will be routed through us. That's wonderful! Give the good news to the staff. Sure. You must go to London immediately. Yes Hi, how are you? There's good news! Strange! She always pips me to the talking post? Even I have something to tell you. No. Me first. Tell me. I won a brand new flat in an Air Voice lucky contest. Air Voice lucky contest...? Sir... that flat you wanted to give her... I fixed a contest to do it. Wow, that's great! Congratulations. Notjust congratulations. Get over here in five minutes. Kalpana, I'm a bit busy. I can't come. I'll hit you for pretending to be busy. I'm giving you the address. Come right away. Hi! Hi... congratulations. Thank you One second! What's this? You're taking your first step into this home. I want to capture it for posterity. You too, come over. Nice, isn't it? Beautiful. This is how it'll stay forever, to remind us of the first step we took. So! How is this home? Fabulous! New home, second hand car... lucky strike? I'm feeling so happy! Weren't you saying something on the phone? Yes... I got to go out of town for ten days. Where to...? My village. Why, so suddenly? My mother is sick. Then, bring her here. I got to go, I have some property there... two acres of land. I got to sell it... for my mother's medical treatment. Ten days? You'll come sooner, if you can...? I will. You will come, won't you? What's it, why are you nervous? I don't know, it's just an odd feeling. Hey... Silly you. All the rest are standard clauses. I think we've covered everything, right? Yes, we've clarified all the points. I'll need a hard copy on the flight. Will be done. Make sure, all changes are incorporated. - Right. Yes...? - Sir, we're getting late. It's one o'clock! All right, let's pack. Thank you, gentlemen. Hello? Hello Sachin... Kalpana. - Yes Kalpana? I got to see you right away. Come over to my old place. It's one am. Say, what's the matter? I got to see you before you leave. Please. All right. I'm coming. Why are you standing on the street? Just waiting, for you. So... why did you call me? What's this? One hundred and thirty five thousand. For your mother's treatment. Where did you get so much money? I sold my car. What... why? You would've sold the land. Don't sell it. It's an inheritance. A car... I can buy again. But... you wanted the car so much! Forget it. Show your mother my soap ad. I'm looking nice in that one. Come back quickly. Next week, I'm in Goa for an ad shoot. I'll be back in two or three days. You're getting late... now go. Go on.

You are my passion Why didn't I find you before? How was it that you came to me... how blessed I am, but it's hard to believe That day, I swore... until I buy three Ambassador cars, I won't marry. Don't sell it. It's an inheritance. A car... I can buy again. And once I believed, that the Creator finds... His urge no more And then... He created you And now He is revealed to me... in all His glory Chords of a music touch my life, I can feel new tunes coming into life But I still can't believe... how blessed I am, how you came to me... I love you. Come back quickly. That's upto 21st June 2006. AfteRWards, Sanjay went to London and Kalpana went to Goa. What happened after that? Anything more on the man we arrested at the girls' hostel? No, it's turning out to be a strange case. - How come? Bring him. It was tough keeping him under control, so he was given a sedative. He has several names and numbers tattooed. Also, several strange remarks. On the head... he has a deep scar. Found on him... a gun, a camera, photographs. We haven't been able to find out who he is. Call up those numbers. Find out who they are. Hello? Constable Dhuri from D.N. Nagar Police station. Do you recognise this man? Yes. He is Sanjay Singhania, chairman of Air Voice. The chairman of Air Voice? - Yes. He suffers from short term memory loss, doesn't remember anything beyond 15 minutes. A friend of mine, he has tattooed in my name and number, for remembering me. That's all. Where did you find him? Medical college girl's hostel. In a lift. Sir, his manager and his secretary are here. Have you written a complaint about him? - Not yet, sir. Wait a while. He's only a patient. And do you know who he is? He was found in a girls' hostel with a gun. How is one to take him for a medical patient? The gun is for his safety. Here's the gun licence. He didn't shoot at anyone, did he? No complaint has been registered. You can take him away. But from now on, be careful. Please take their contact details. Thank you. - Thank you very much. Careful. Sorry, you aren't allowed... - Who are you? Move over. - Whom do you want? Silence! Why are you locking us? Whose address is it? Mine. The date is tomorrow's. One day on, you'd be gone. Don't shoot him! My name and number are on his body. In police records, he's a friend of mine. A murder enquiry can become big trouble. You mean, we leave him alive? - Yes, alive. But like the living dead. He's got memory tags everywhere. We've got to erase what he has written, we got to turn him into blank paper. Now, he's just like any other furniture Just like a vegetable. Newspaper archives? - First floor. Why are you hiding? Come out. Come... careful. Sit. What happened to you? I'm from Latur village. Ramesh brought me to Mumbai, saying he'd find a job for me. But he sold me to someone. Now... he's forcing me to go to Goa. And... there are more girls like me in a bogey up ahead. At one of the stations, I managed to get away and I'm hiding here. Don't cry. Nothing is going to happen. I'm here with you. She must be around. Hurry up. Move in. Look behind. Did you see a girl, wearing a frock? Give me ten Rupees. Here. Open the door. - Open up! Give that girl to me! I paid 2000 Rupees to buy her! Come on, open up! Open the door! Open it! It's gold! Should be worth 3,000. Forget the girl. Let's go. It's all right. Don't be afraid. We'll get down at the next station and we'll go to Bombay. We've been after chickens. Will we spare a hen if we find one? Let go... leave her! Sister... Help me! Leave me! How far can she run? Sister, do something! Look at her... there. Sister! Help me! Hi, how are you? I'm okay. Are you in Goa? No, I'm returning to Mumbai. What? It's a long story. In my train, there were some goons. They were taking 25 kidnapped girls to Goa. Somehow, I managed to save them. I'm on my way back to Mumbai with them. What! Are you all right? Tell me about it, what happened? Don't worry, nothing's happened to me. Are you sure? I'm perfectly all right, really. You're too much, Kalpana. But it's also what I like the most about you. What...? This habit of helping others. The first time I saw you, you were helping some disabled girls across a ditch. How do you know that? There's so much I haven't told you. Stuff you'll be amazed to hear. Drop the melodrama and tell me. Not like this... when I'm saying it, I got to see the look on your face. So, I'll tell it to you once I'm back. See you. Take care, bye. Bye.

I think we shouldn't wait here. Where are you going? You can't kill him so easily. There are too many of them in there. Stop! We'll get him when he's alone. This is a very dangerous area.
