All in a night, spring came... ...rushing from beyond the ends of the earth... ...and spilling out all over Umberny... ...its sack full of colors... ...and buds and birds' eggs... ...snails and tadpoles... ...rainbows and newborn animals. Bees hummed... ...mammoths gamboled... ...meadows rang with the plighting of troths... ...and deep in his ancestral cave... Hero... Fairbeard frisky... Lord of all Umbs... ...snored and grunted... ...stirred and groaned... ...and got out of bed to look outside. "Fiddle-fuddle, Umb. "A thousand spitting curses!" Cathryn... Una stared at the carved, curving creature... ...delicate, questing, perfect... with arched neck and a single slender horn. "Sir Frisky," she cried. "Sir Frisky, what was it? "What did I see?" Hero stared back. "Why, a unicorn." Una was trembling like an aspen... ...pale as a unicorn herself. Straight past his nose zoomed 7 enormous butterflies... with eyes like stars and bright blue wings... ...and each one was humming. And then Hero started to tremble... ...for it seemed to be him who was humming... ...not with his usual tuneless hum... ...but a butterfly's humming... ...just as if one had flown down his throat. The stone circle was shrouded in stillness. There was no whisker of wind... ...but the holy tree swayed and tossed... ...as if in the grip of some terrible storm. Deep sobbing broke from its trunk... ...as though some locked creature was struggling to escape. It was raining... a sudden, torrential downpour. Snug in Rose Nest with all the blinds pulled down... Amberlash was cozily entertaining Eggbert to tea. "This lovely weather should hold... "shouldn't it, Eggbert, darling? "No one could catch cold, not seriously... "I mean, die of pneumonia... out tonight." Cathryn... In the pit, the water rose round Una's ankles... ...creeping up about her knees. "Oh, bother. Blast!" She sobbed. "I bet I'll drown." Suddenly, the sounds of something... ...came crashing through the forest, nearer and nearer... ...several somethings. And then she heard the snorkeling trumpetings of... "Hero! Hero! "Help, help! Get me out!" In a flash, the Lord of Umberny was off his steed... ...leaning over the edge of the pit... ...stretching a long arm down in the pouring rain. "It's no good," Una sobbed. "I can't see anything... "not even your hands. "I'm too deep." - Hello? - Cathryn? It's Joan. Can you talk? Hey, you sound different. Are you all right? Yeah. Fine. You didn't sound like yourself. Must be the connection. You know what just happened? That son of a bitch called me just now. He wants me to pay some goddamn percentage... ...of last year's taxes... ...because we were legally community property then... ...or some such bullshit. Oh, God. Well, yeah. I had a date with this guy Howard. You don't know him. Only met him last week at some party or other. Anyway, he was sitting right here... ...and I broke down and just cried... ...and hung up on him. Then I made a damn fool out of myself with Howard. Told him to leave, that I couldn't go out. And he... Ouch! God... Damn it! That cat! Well, he just stepped right on my boob. That hurts. Joan? Hello? Joan, is that you? No. Who did you want? I was talking to Joan. Is that you, Cathryn? - Who's speaking, please? - Don't you know? Cathryn! Cathryn! Are you there? Cathryn, can you hear me? Well, what happened? I don't know. Must have been a crossed line. Well, listen. Are you and Hugh going out? No. Hugh's got to st... Hugh's got a business dinner. Oh. Well, maybe I'll come over. I'd really like a drink. What movie's on tonight? I don't know. I was going to go to bed, but come on over. Listen, I promised Judy I'd call her. I'll get right back to you, ok? Ok. Fine. I'll get right back. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Hello? Cathryn? Is that you, Cathryn? Yes. Who is it, please? Do you know where your husband is tonight? What? I said, do you know... where your husband is tonight? Who's speaking, please? You don't know? - Hello? - Hello. Alert. This is a blow alert. - This is the telephone company. - Hugh, Hugh! We're going to blow out the lines. Yeah, baby, it's me. Listen. Listen, I just called to tell you not to wait up. I'm going to be later than I thought. - What? - You hear me? What? I just wanted to tell you. Oh, fine. Do you know what's black and white... ...and black and white and black and white? Huh? A nun falling downstairs. That's good, eh? Listen, I'll see you in the morning. - Hugh? - No, it's me. Cathryn. Cathryn? Yes? I want to speak to my husband, please. That's who I'm calling about... old Hugh. Please, will you put my husband on? Oh, Cathryn, I would if I could. If this is one of Hugh's little jokes... ...just tell him I don't think it's very funny. - Funny, eh? - Who's speaking, please? Not funny. At this moment, old Hugh is with a girl... ...probably in bed by now... ...at Ambassador Towers... 1334 Commercial Drive. The telephone number is 274-9382. Why are you telling me this? Why are you telling me this? Good-bye. I just thought I'd better tell you... ...if you try to call them... ...you'll probably get a busy sound. I imagine they've taken the phone off the hook. After all, isn't that what you do... when you don't want to be disturbed? I'm sure they don't want to be disturbed. Cathryn? Cathryn, can you hear? Cathryn, I'm talking to you about your husband... ...about old Hugh. How was the meeting? A waste of time. - Really? - Yeah. Jesus Christ, Cathryn. Why are all the phones off the hook? Isn't that what people do when they don't want to be disturbed? What if I tried to reach you? I didn't think that was very likely. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Who the hell would call at this time of night? Oh, thank God it's you! - Jesus Christ, Joan! - I've been calling all night. It is 4:00 in the morning. Is Cathryn all right? - Yes, she's all right. - I want to talk to her. I'll have her call you in the morning. Good night. Sleep tight. Jesus Christ! About your friends! Shit. I want to get to the bottom of this phone business. And I want to know who you were with. What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means I want to know her name. What's the matter, baby? Did someone call you? Did someone telephone? Huh? Who was it? - Who called? - I don't know. Some woman. She kept phoning me and... ...telling me about you and some girl... Awful things that... I don't know. She kept ringing, and I'd hang up... ...and she'd ring again. Hugh, it's not true, is it? Tell me it's not true. Of course it isn't true. I can prove where I was and who I was with... ...if that will make you feel any better. But why would anyone do such a thing? I mean, she even gave me a phone number and address. Now, what was her name... ...this girl I was supposed to be with? I just kept seeing you with this girl. Oh, Hugh. I want to go home. I want to go to Green Cove. - Can we both go? - Of course. - Can we go together? - Yes. - Right now? - In a few days. I have to square things away, and then we'll go, all right? Listen, listen. There is no one else. There is only you... Just you. Come here. Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. Cathryn? Cathryn? Jesus Christ! What's the matter, baby? Are you all right? What happened? You scared the shit out of me. Are you all right, baby? - What happened? - No, I just have... What are you yelling so for? - I just had a dream. - A dream? What kind of dream? Cathryn, I have got to know what's happened. - Leave me alone! - All right. - I don't know! - All right. All right. Now, I'll call George. You just stay there and rest. I'll call George, and he'll take care of everything. Then we'll drive out to Green Cove. It will take us a couple of hours. We both need a rest. The beginning. "Long, long ago"... wrote Ancient, the wise historian... ...in big, slow, spidery writing... "the most heavenly spirit of the universe... "tossed from her finger like an emerald... "the fair land of Umberny. "Very far down through the reaches of the sky... "it fell... "to sink into the heart of the great continent. "To Umberny's north lay Goll. "To Umberny's south lay Gonn. "To east and west... "to east and west... "a great many other lands lie... "but none is as fair as the land of the Umbs." It's beautiful. I love it here. There's a covey of quail down there. Right down there, between those trees. Umbs, as you probably know... ...are very small people... quarrelsome, peaceful, jealous and kind... ...cowardly, brave, happy and sad... ...as man-children have been since the dawn of time. They live in caves or little, stone, conical houses... wear thick, furry bearskins... ...hunt and fish and farm... ...and paint wonderful things on the walls of their caves. But one thing you can never tell about an Umb is his age. Some are born looking old... ...others you'd think are 5 or 12... ...can very well turn out to be 300. And as nobody in Umberny can count... ...nobody bothers a bit. "I do believe... I do believe I can begin"... ...the wise old historian muttered... ...and he shuffled across to a shelf stacked up... with pieces of fresh bark... ...and pots and pots of mammoth blood... ...shuffled back with his fresh sheet... ...and dipped his quill again. "In 59310, here at the Umbs'... "spring had fallen overnight... "rushing from beyond the ends of the Earth." You don't mind going down alone, do you? - No. - Light a fire. I won't be long. You've got the keys, don't you? Cathryn. Who's up there? Who is it? Hugh. Hugh? Hugh? Hugh, the chim... Hugh, the chimney's on... Cathryn? Jesus Christ, Cathryn! Open the flue! You didn't open the flue! Turn off the gas. Turn it off! Have you... Turn it off. It's not off. Wait. Here, Cat. Let me... There. Open the window. Here, let me get that. Jesus Christ. Were you upstairs just now? - What? - Were you upstairs? Of course not. Why? Why did you ask me that? I must be imagining things. I just thought... I heard somebody moving about. It's impossible. Hugh, I did hear something. What are you trying to do... smoke him out? I heard something, anyway. I'll have a look. Maybe some animal got up there. Cathryn. Got him. Got him. What a chase... down the hall... ...into the bathroom, into the bedroom... ...then the linen closet. That's where I first saw the spoor. A couple of elves riding his back. Got them, too. Two in 1 shot. We'll bury them after dinner in the back. What's for dinner? Spaghetti and salad. Spaghetti. Forgot the wine. I put out 4 bottles of the whiskey. I know. I was using them with the fruit and the cheese... ...in a setup. Forgot them. It doesn't matter. You can get some when you go into town. Spaghetti without wine... ...is like a ship without a rudder... ...and tomorrow is another day. Wait a minute. Good. Gonna try for those birds one more time. Hugh, didn't we have a colander? - A what? - A colander. You know, that pan with the holes in it. Strainer! Did you take that home? No. I've got one at home. You mean, we own 2 colanders? Find it? No, but you'll never guess what I did find. What? This must have been here since last summer. Valpolicella. Remember when John and Sherry came up for the week... ...and brought a whole case of it? Now, that's really the luck of the gods, isn't it? Where did you find it? Behind the deep freeze. Did you find the colander? - Do you really need it? - What? The strainer thing. I'm sure glad you found the wine. Like I said... ...spaghetti without wine... ...is like a ship without a rudder. Hugh? What? What? Will you be long? Oh, my God. And Hero saw... ...a perfectly oval, sea-green stone... ...no bigger than a linnet's egg. "Oh, my goodness! It can't be," he cried. But it was. Thinking stones... ...even in Umberny... ...are terribly rare and hard to find... ...for they are magical. They can help you in the smallest ways, like... ...like reminding you how many pies you had for tea or... Things really don't change, do they? You always looked on the dark side of life. Or where you left your spear. Who is he? Your husband? Or with big things like dreaming up a poem. What's his name? Henri? Duc? Bravo. Or did you find another French lover? This is not happening. This is not happening. I will not let this happen. He has taught you games. Like you used to say... ...or tell myself... "I'm not really making love with him. "That will make everything all right." You are dead... ...and you have been dead for 3 years. You can't be here. I won't let this happen. Do you know... ...every time we meet, you actually used to act... ...like it was the first time... ...and I could never have made love to you. Cathryn... Shut up! You're dead! I am a ghost. Do I scare you? My God! You weren't on that plane. You weren't in that crash. Somebody took your place. Somebody else died, not you. You put me on the plane, remember? You stood behind a post and blew me a little kiss. You were afraid someone would see you... ...and it would get back to him. Why did you do it? Die? Die? All right. Hugh will be here in a moment... ...and then we'll see who's here and who isn't. He will think you're crazy... ...if he comes in and hears you talking to yourself. Come on. Come on, Cathy. Let's go upst... Oh, God! My, my, my. The ghost bleeds. What did you do that for? You could have killed me! Again? Oh, my God. Did you bleed like that on the plane? You're ruining the chair, you know... ...floor, everything. Ah, shut up, please. God. Jesus! God. My goddamn gun. Caught my hand in the goddamn breech. Sorry to make such a mess, but this goddamn thing... - Hugh, let me look at it. - No, no, no. It's all right, dear. No, that's ok. I'm going to take a bath before dinner. Goddamn it! Jesus. I've cleaned it up. Cold water, rub gently. Right? You taught me that. Remember my bed... ...that time you miscalculated? Shut up. You have a filthy mind. Did you really think you were pregnant? I was. I was pregnant. For 5 days. It was more than that. It was much more than that. I was pregnant for weeks. You were 5 days late, that's all. And you want to know something? You can't get pregnant. That's a lie. There's nothing wrong with me. There's nothing wrong at all with the tests. It's Hugh. It's not me. There's nothing wrong with me. No, I don't suppose... ...there is anything wrong with you physically. What do you mean by that? Just what the words say. That's all. You're trying to say I don't want children, aren't you? Cathy, my love... ...listen to me. First, you never were pregnant. - That's not tr... - Second... ...if you had been... ...making love with me that afternoon... wasn't about to make you lose it. Third and mainly... ...it wasn't just me... ...lying on that bed. It takes 2... ...to tango. - Right? - Well... ...let me tell you something... Monsieur le Playboy. All I ever wanted from you was a baby. That's right. I wanted a baby. I wanted a baby for Hugh, for me... ...for our marriage. I am not a cheater. I did not cheat. You'll just see... What are you doing? Cleaning the blood from your mortal wound. You dripped. Did you call me just now? I thought I heard you talking to someone. You did. Who? Is someone here? I was talking to myself. I do quite often. Where did you get that? In the cupboard. It's been around for a long time. It's my puzzle. I had it when I was a child. - Oh, yeah? - Move over. What's it of? I don't remember. Got you. That's not right. No, that's not right. How's your hand? What? Oh, it's all right. Do you think we ought to go and do the shopping? Yeah. I made a list. I'm going to leave in a few minutes. - There. - You put down wine? I think you ought to get some steaks or something. Yeah, yeah. I made the list. It's all there. Does this one go in here? Here? No. You know, do the edges first. It's easier. That's cheating. And put all the yellow pieces together in a pile. Hugh? Hey, Hugh! - What? - Don't you want me to come? No, no, darling. I'm ok. I'll get it. Go back inside. Shut the door. Close the door. What is the puzzle? Is it yours? Deeper than the mammoth hunt... ...deeper than any of her unicorn treks... Una went into the forest. She was catching hints of animals she had never seen. Eyes like yellow coals gleamed out of thickets... ...a horny tail rose from a bush... ...and all about her in the dying light... ...teeth snapped like scissors. Now and then, a snake slithered across her path... ...or she fell into the footprint of some giant beast. Screeches, chatters, snorts, and running feet... ...vied over the drip, drip of sodden branches... ...and her own feet made barely a sound on the leaves. "What exactly is a soul?" They were sitting round the fire... waiting for the fish to roast on sticks... ...and Hero said, "Bother. "Surely everybody knew about souls. "Well, a soul is... "A soul is..." Not for the first time since the day he had found it... Hero wished more than anything... ...for the thinking stone to be in his hand. "Might it be a sort of slipper?" Said Una. "Yes, a slipper. A slipper or a sapling... "or a bird or a fish or even a tiny ewe?" "You see, a soul... A soul... "A soul makes you like dawn or trees in my poems... "and pipes and bells and shells... "and birds in spring and unicorns. It..." What? What are you doing here? Go away. Get away. I don't want to see you. Go away. - Hugh. - Yeah? - Are you alone? - Guess what I found. Artichokes. I mean, avocados. - Oh, marvelous. - Come on down. God, the food here could feed an army. - Who helped you carry it in? - Guess. But you said you were alone. I lied. - Come on, Hugh. Who's with you? - Close your eyes. - Who's with you? - Close your eyes. I've got a surprise. Surprise. Marcel. How are you? Fantastic. The old fart really looks terrific, huh? Ran into him at the gas station. His car broke down. I thought I'd ask them to dinner. Them? I've got a real surprise for you. I don't think I could take any more surprises. Come on out, honey! Don't you see the resemblance? Resemblance? That's Susannah. That's my little girl. It's taken me a hell of a time, but I've got her up here... ...for a whole year. Come on. Give Cathy a big kiss. Hello. Hello. If you won't, I sure will. Let's go down to the boathouse. Susannah, I've heard so much about you. Shall I take your hat and coat? Scotch and soda for everyone... ...or shall I make one of my famous marts? Whiskey's fine for me. Nothing for me, thanks. Come on, you old fart. Have one of my vodka marts. You're so tall and pretty. Thank you. - How old are you? - 121/2. How old are you? 13 and 1/4. Do you like jigsaws? Yes. I saw that one when I came in. Cathryn, where's the vermouth? Then maybe you can help me with it... 'cause I'm stuck. What's it of? I don't know. 20 birds. Covey of quail down there... ...you know, but I got... I cannot get near the damn things. I've tried twice now. You never will at this time of year. There's a piece here that doesn't fit. I'm gonna put it in. And I'll put all the yellow pieces together... ...and all the green pieces... ...and then we can look in the yellow pieces... ...for the best piece. That's a good idea. You could do the edges. That's cheating, though. It's not. We've got to do it sometime. I know, but if you do the edges first... ...it makes it easier. I don't think it's easier. I think it's a difficult puzzle. All right. You can do the edges. Son of a bitch. I don't think I have any vermouth. Hugh, can we make a fire in here? - It's freezing. - Yeah, just a second. Son of a bitch! Where's the vermouth? The-son-of-a-bitching vermouth! You make the fire. I know where it is. I'll get it. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. We don't have any vermouth. Yes, we do. I have some here in this cupboard. I got a new bottle. Son of a bitch. Oh, no. I know where it is. I wonder how he got custody. I can't believe her mother would just... ...give her up just like that, especially to Marcel. Vermouth. - What... You... - Who is he? I've never even heard of him before. - He follows me? - Look here, will you... I found the bottle. You want it? Take it. - I'm sorry. - Cathryn? What happened? - Are you ok? - I dropped the bottle. I just dropped the bottle of vermouth. Son of a bitch, Cathryn. Are you crazy, Marcel? For God's sake! Oh, look at him. He's gonna kill me. Like to throw you on the floor... ...and take you right here. My God. He's my replacement... - Hugh? - Or at least one of them. Would you marinate the steaks? Sure. Hey! Get back to that fire, you old crotch. - Well? - What? - Where are they? - What? The steaks? I don't know. You did the shopping. I didn't get any steaks. Oh. Well, what are we going to have for dinner, then? - Spaghetti and salad. - Spaghetti and salad? Yes! Spaghetti and salad! I was just kidding. I got the steaks. Can't you take a joke? - Where are you going? - Upstairs! Go away. Please leave me alone. Oh, Susannah. I'm sorry. I thought it was my husband. I need to go to the bathroom. Of course. It's in here. I don't know if I put any towels in. Oh, yes. Dinner was over. Only the nuts roasted... 3 years I've been trying to get custody of the child... ...and I finally did it. Christ knows what it cost. When I first came up here to paint... ...it never occurred to me that that adoring wife of mine... was screwing everything she could find. It took me 2 years to find out what was happening. Finally, I caught her red-handed... "I expect you're longing to hear the rest... "of the history," he said. With a friend of mine, too. Extraordinary. I'd be most enormously grateful if you didn't interrupt. That's when I came up here for good... ...and that bitch got a divorce. You think she'd let Susannah come up to me for the summer? Very carefully... ...he took the thinking stone... ...from his pocket. No way. So I put detectives on her. That's right. A year and a half, I had her followed. Back with a rush... ...tumbled all the things he'd learnt in his history class. It cost me a fortune... ...but I got the lot... ...tapes, pictures... ...year-and-a-half's evidence with 16 different men. No ounce of fear, no dream of future... God knows how many we missed. Takes me around to question... ...friend or foe... Talk about the 1,001 nights of Sodom. I've got my own dirty book... ...and last month, I threw it at her. I said, "either I get Susannah for a year now... "and then every summer after that... "or I take the whole damn thing to court." Marcel... Susannah's awake. All right, darling? You've been asleep. Your father's here. Did you take a nap, baby? It's late for little girls. Come on. I'll take you out to the car. Shouldn't we... Hadn't we better wake him? Let him sleep. Don't! Open the door. Grab the rest of her things. You stay asleep now, baby, huh? Bring those things. Help me with the door here. You stay asleep, now. That's right. In you go. There you go. That's it, now. Where the hell do you think you're going? I'm going inside. I'm cold. What's the matter with you? They're both asleep... Marcel, what the hell do you think you're doing? For God's sake! That's better, you bitch. Listen! You listen to me! Just stay away from me, you hear? I love my husband... ...and that's what I'm going to do from now on. I've been sick. I'm sick! But I'm going to go in there, and I love him... ...and I'm going to show him I love him! I'm going to just go in and tell him... ...and just keep away! Hugh? Wake up, Hugh. Wake up. Hugh, I need you. Wake up, please. - They've gone. - Oh, yeah? Talk to me. Make love to me. Make love to me. Sit with me here, please. Stay with me and make love, please. I need you. God, I have such a crick in my neck. Hugh. Hugh, please. Don't go. Hugh, don't go, please. Stay with me. Put out the candles before you come up, huh, baby? Cathy. Come on. Come in here. There was a lot of traffic. - Cars and... - Go on. Sit down. Beautiful windows. - Fire. - Do you like it? - It's lovely. - Look at me. Look at me. - Could I have... - Look. Could I have a drink? Do you want a whiskey? Yes. Shall I get some glasses? Do you have any? I have some. You don't want anything to drink... Any wine? I didn't say I would definitely come here. You knew you would come here. Please, Marcel. Don't be so rough. Have you been here long? Come give me a kiss. I'm cold. What do you mean, cold? Do you want a drink? Yes. I think I'll have some of this wine. - Hi, baby. - You're back soon. I didn't expect you this soon. I was at the office, and I was thinking about you... Hugh, I'm a little cold. I'll just close the window. Aren't you cold? Please, let's get some champagne. It's a marvelous idea. I'll get some glasses. But not downstairs. Right here. Don't give me a baby. I want a baby. Cathryn! Cathryn, baby... What's the matter? Are you all right? Cathryn! What is it, baby? Jesus. - I saw! I saw... - What? Did you have a dream, baby? Come back to bed. Come on, now. Come on. Come back to bed. Hello! Anybody home? - Coming! - You left your door open. Morning, Marcel. Hope we're not late. I had a hell of a time... ...getting out of bed this morning. - Good morning, Susannah. - How about you? Oh, I feel marvelous this morning. I'm just making some breakfast. - Would you like some? - Just coffee. Susannah, what about you? Breakfast? No, thank you. She's been up since 7:00. Made her own breakfast and everything. You're daddy's big girl, aren't you? Why don't you go outside and play? Oh, isn't it a little cold? It's not cold... ...but I'd rather stay and do the puzzle. Can I? Yes, of course. You know where it is. Hugh will be down in a minute. What got into you last night? What? Maybe I should have said "who?" Jumpy. Yes, I am a little jumpy. Just leave me alone, will you, Marcel? We're in here. Boy, did I sleep last night! It's the fresh air, they say. - Sure you wouldn't like an egg? - No, no. Just toast and coffee. Well, whatever it is... I'd like a steady diet of it. You like cream in your coffee, Marcel? - Black for me. - What did you do with Susannah? I brought her. I thought I'd leave her with Cathryn... while we went out after the birds. Terrific. Hey... You know how to catch a polar bear? You cut a hole in the ice. Put some green peas around the hole. When the bear comes up to take a pea... ...you kick him in the ice hole. You must be happy to be spending a whole year... with your father. I am. I hardly ever got to see him before. But I love my mother, too. Well, of course. She still loves my father, too... ...only she won't act like it. I guess men are that way, and you have to accept it. What way? They just don't stay in love very long. My mother has lots of boyfriends... ...and they never last very long. My father and mother were divorced. I grew up in Green Cove with my grandfather. - I never saw him. - Never? Well, hardly ever. I wasn't as lucky as you. Are you my father's girlfriend? Of course not. What a funny question. I'm married. But you were kissing him last night. I wasn't. Perhaps I was. But that's because we're old friends. My husband and I haven't seen him since last winter. Know what I'm gonna miss the most while I'm up here... ...for a whole year? - What? - Jenny. Who's Jenny? She's my friend. She's 2 years older than me... ...but we're best friends. Daddy says maybe she can come down... ...and stay with us for a while... when her school gets out. That will be nice. But I'll bet her mother won't let her. I bet she will. Have you asked her? No, not yet, but I bet she won't. She never even lets her sleep over... ...or things like that. Well, I bet this summer she will. Why don't you ask your father to ask her? If she can't, though... will you be my best friend? Of course. I'd love to. Trade secrets and everything? Everything. There's nothing I'd like better. Look. A dog. Isn't he pretty? It's cold. I think I'm going in. Can I stay out and play with him? Yes, if you want to. I love you. Yes, I love you. - Hello. - Hello. Well, Archie, you seem to have found a friend. - Is he yours? - Yes. Didn't I see you walking down... ...from the top up there? Yes. It's nice. Do you live here? Near. It was fantastic last night. I'd almost forgotten. Ignoring me isn't going to do any good. I just want to talk about last night. Look at me. You'd just as well talk to me. That's what you've got me here for. It was fantastic last night. You could call it an orgy. What do you know about last night? What? I was there, wasn't I? You weren't there. You weren't anywhere. You haven't been anywhere for 3 years. You're dead. Maybe so... ...but I know something now I didn't know then. I know why you never responded like you... Shut up! You're dead! Now, just stay dead. You want me dead? Make me dead... with a gun. Look. Yes. Shoot me... ...like your bird... ...in 1 of 2 shots. Cathy. Look. It's easy. Take it. Go ahead. There's a good ghost, then. Cathryn? Cathryn. Are you all right? Oh, I feel so silly. This gun just went off. I was putting it away, and it went off. That's very dangerous... ...having a loaded gun about. Gave me an awful fright. I've absolutely shot up my husband's camera. And it certainly made a loud noise. You know, guns aren't made to fool around with. You could have killed someone. I know. Well, I'm glad it was only a camera, then. Good-bye. Come along, Archie. Bye, Archie. Poor Rene. Rene? I mean, Hugh. Poor Hugh. Deep as a well came Ebony's groan. Out of Una's breast shot a tiny blue bird... ...straight to the sacred bonfire... where it hovered and spun over the flames. It was Una, Una who felt the pain... ...like flames scorching her heart. She knew that the little blue bird... ...had always been part of her... ...lodged inside her since she began. But the pain of being without... was more than she could bear. "Oh, my soul. "My soul. "Give me back my soul." Do you want anything else? No, thank you. This is the first time I've ever had a tomato sandwich. - Do you like it? - Yeah. I'm not going to be able to finish this puzzle. There's too many pieces missing. They should be there. I know where they are. Did you find it? Yes, I did. Here. I'm going upstairs for a bit. - You frightened me. - No kidding. Where's Hugh? How the hell should I know? I think you'd better get out of my bedroom. You really got to get rough now to make it work, haven't you? Susannah's downstairs. She'll hear you. Not me, but she might hear you, so shut up. - Bastard! - You started this. You ought to finish things you start. Oh, you bitch. That's better. So you do remember last night? Last night? You remember last night? Just as long as you do. You know what you are? You're a schizo... One minute fighting like a tiger... ...and the next all love and kisses. You just don't understand about women. Some women, but I understand you. Oh, yeah? Cathryn! What the hell happened down there? What? Who shot off the goddamn gun? The gun! Who shot off the goddamn shotgun... ...in the goddamn house? It wasn't loaded, that's for sure. Who loaded it? I don't know. I just picked it up... Well, I have never in my life... ...kept a loaded gun in this or any house. Jesus Christ! It looks like someone... was shooting skeet in the dining room. Well, I didn't load it. Well, you shot my camera. I told you, I didn't load it. Well, why were you handling it, anyway? - I was putting it away. - Why? Because everywhere I go, the bloody thing... ...gets in the way. It's a wonder I didn't blow my own head off. I didn't load your goddamn gun. I wouldn't even know how. You were the last person to use it, so it must have been you. I'm sorry, baby. L... It just scared the shit out of me, that's all. I shouldn't take it out on you. I'm sorry. Do you know what the butcher said when he dropped... ...the meat cleaver on his arm? "It won't be long now." Jesus Christ, Cathryn! I'll tell you a secret. I was getting bored with that camera, anyway. Forgive me? Jesus, it's hot outside. Where'd I put my slippers? Oh, there they are. Hugh, did Marcel come back with you? Yeah. He must have beat me back... ...by 15 minutes. You mean, he's here? He's been here in the house? He crapped out and drove the car back. I walked down the ridge. I still haven't got those goddamn birds. I'll tell you something. He doesn't know his ass from third base... ...about hunting birds. Get yourself decent. I'll make some drinks. Hugh, will you ask Susannah to come up here a minute? Yeah. Susannah! - Annie Oakley wants to see you. - Who? Oh, never mind. Cathryn. Did you want me? Yes. Did you finish your sandwich? Yeah, a long time ago. - Is your father here? - Yeah. These boots of mine are so scuffed. I was having a rest a little while ago... ...and I thought I heard somebody coming upstairs. - Was it you? - No. Oh, then it must have been him, then. No. He's been downstairs with me since he got back. We were doing the puzzle. Really? That's funny. I could have sworn I heard somebody. You sure he didn't come up here? Absolutely not at all? - All right. - Is that all? Yes. I'll be down in a minute. We finished the puzzle. It was of a house... ...and tiger... ...and a... Yes, I know. Don't come! Go back! Go back! I can't hear you! Go back! Baby, is that you? Jesus, I thought you'd never get back. - What's this? - What? Oh, yeah. Listen, George called... ...and he's going to be out of town... ...and the McKenzie thing has come up... ...so I'm going to have to go back for a couple of days. I can make the 6:15 if we hurry. How could George call? We haven't got a phone. I know we haven't got a phone, Cathryn. I live here, too, you know. I mean, how did he get through? He got through... ...by calling Andy at the bar... ...and Andy took down the message... Andy gave the message to Charlie... Charlie got in the Land Rover... ...and drove out here and gave me the message... ...and I gave Charlie a fiver. Any more questions? So, I get to stay here all on my own. That's absolutely great. That's terrific. Cathryn. Cathryn, wait a minute. Cathryn, go upstairs, pack your things... I don't want to go. I want to finish my book. Better yet, I'll call George... ...and he'll just have to change his plans. We haven't got a phone. Listen, honey. I really would worry if I left you here. Yeah? Since when? All right. Ok, Cathryn, you win. Hugh? Hugh, I'm sorry. - No, no. Really... - Hugh, I'm sorry. I really want you to... I want you to go. - Promise? - Yeah, promise. I've got plenty to do here, really. - Really? - Yep. So listen, darling. I'll try to wrap it up in one day. I'll be back by Friday, no matter what. So you meet the 7:45, all right? What if you get through by tomorrow? If I get through by tomorrow... I'll give old Charlie another fiver... ...he'll kick over the engine, and he'll drive me home. Hey, what's the difference between a rabbit? What's the difference between a rabbit? Nothing. One is both the same. I love you. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Come on out. How'd you get rid of him? I just thought him away like I thought you here. Why did you disappear this afternoon? I was ready for you. I'm here. That's all that matters. Do you have to be so rough? Aren't you going to get undressed, too? Hero... Hero lay amongst his chalk and paints. Over him, the finished canvas... ...of the Goddess of Plenty smiled down. He smiled, too, in his dream. Long legs carried him over valleys... ...and streams and hills. And then far ahead, upon a plain... ...he seemed to see a burning, fiery bush. On and on, he ran towards it... ...till his face tingled with its warmth... ...and as he reached it, Heavenly rose out of the flames. "What are you chasing here?" "My heart's desire," he said. "Run on. "Run on and find it"... Heavenly cried. Gave my love a cherry... That had no stone... I gave my love a chicken... That had no bone... I told my love a story... That had no end... I gave my love... - Good morning. Hi. - Well, good morning. Weren't you afraid of being caught in the rain? No. I don't think it's going to rain. Besides, Archie needs his exercise. I'm just making some coffee. Would you like some? Thank you, no. I must keep moving. I try to walk at least 3 hours every day. Archie. He seems to smell your dog. I don't have a dog. Oh. Then you're just a nosey parker, Archie. Archie, come on. Come here. Come on, Archie. Good boy. Good-bye! Why, you horrid... You naughty dog! Go on! Out, out, out, you dirty, dirty dog! Go on. Go. Go. Go! Shoo! Shoo! Hi! Hello. Did you walk all the way from the house? Of course. That must be about 5 or 6 miles. That's not far. Does your father know you're here? No. He wasn't in this morning. - He wasn't? - No. He was gone when I got up. I thought maybe he might be here. Here? Why should he be here? I don't know. I just thought he might. But you saw him last night? Want to go for a walk? You did see him last night? Answer me! Yes. What time last night? After midnight, I suppose. He woke me up when he came in. He was drunk. Why? Is something wrong? No. L... I was driving my husband to the station last night... ...and they said in the village... ...that some man had driven off a cliff... ...and I just thought... ...for a moment... I'm sorry I frightened you. Do you want to come in and have some tea? I wonder who the man was. I probably got it wrong. I'll put a kettle on. Cathryn, can I ask you something? When you were my age, did you look like me? A bit, but I was prettier. Why? Because I think when I grow up... I'm going to be exactly like you. Don't you get lonely up at the house... without your husband? No. No, I'm quite used to it. I used to spend a lot of time there as a child... ...and my grandfather wasn't always there. Sometimes I spent days and days on my own. What did you do? Oh, I used to go for walks... ...tell myself stories... ...play in the woods. When I'm alone, I think. I do that. That's when I really get afraid. Did you ever ask your father about having your friend up? - Jenny? - I don't need to. You're my friend now. Yes, I am. But what would you do if I went away? Tell myself stories... ...play in the woods. I'd make up a friend. Hello! You bring the ketchup? Look, Dad is cooking steaks. You have to come in. Please? No. Really, I can't. I have something very important to do tonight. But he's going to be mad. Bye, Susannah. Bye, Cathryn. - Hey, where is she going? - She didn't want steak. Cathryn! I got steaks. I got Valpolicella, too. Hey, where are you going? What am I going to do... Jesus Christ, Cathryn. Let me in, Cathryn! What's the matter with you? Why didn't you stop? Why didn't you pick me up? I was afraid. I wasn't sure it was you. Well, for Christ's sake, open the door and let me in. For Christ's sake, Cathryn. It's me! I know it's you... ...but I found out I can get rid of you... ...just like I got rid of Rene and Marcel. I can get you out of my mind forever. Cathryn! What are you talking about, Cathryn? I love you! You don't. Hello? Yes, it's me. Yes, I'm fine. No. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Listen, I'm driving in tonight. I'll be about 31/2 hours. Wait up for me, will you? No, no, I'm fine. I'll let you know... everything's worked out. I love you... won't be long. Cathryn. Cathryn. Cathryn. Cathryn. Cathryn. Hugh! Hugh? Hugh! One day, she came out of the forest. Oh, the hills that fell away at her feet... ...the sky... ...a whole blue sky like a mat of cornflowers... ...space and stillness and silence. The sea. And then her arms dried, and her mouth... ...crystals in the sun. "Spunshon..." "Had she seen it before?" She said. Una did not remember. She turned back to the land again... ...and saw on the beach through her tears... ...a unicorn pawing in the moonlight. You see, Cathryn? It was easy. Go away! I killed you! Not me, Cathryn. Not me. "Unicorn," Willow whispered... ...and she stretched up her arms to it... while tears streamed down her cheeks. "Unicorn, good-bye, and thank you. "Thank you for being mine." And the unicorn dipped its horn till it touched the snow... ...and watched them gallop... ...away, away... ...down the lane, out of sight... ...and it turned and ran swiftly into the forest. And then Ancient picked up a nice, fat volume... ...and put it on the table... ...and in big, spidery writing, he wrote... "In Search of Unicorns." The end.
