How wiii you get him? i wiii. i wiii sureiy get him. i am caiiing from the P.M.F. in two days... ...i wiii detonate J.C. hospitai. Who is speaking? Why so much security in the hospitai aii of a sudden, sir? is a poiitician or a minister going to be admitted? No. P.M.F. has threatened to biow up this hospitai! it couid oniy be a threat. Perhaps. Butut we don't want to take any kind of risk. What's aii this? How did this happen without my permission? Do you know that this fooihardiness... ...can put us in deep troubie?! You think i did it? Has this ever happened? Hitherto we have aiways taken each others consent. Butesides this organisation is mine. Hey Shah Aiam! This is no time for quarreis. Understand? Neither did you do this, nor you. Meaning this is some third party's job. Now we have to think who this third party is? And what is his aim in phoning the coiiector... ...and taking P.M.F.'s name. Understand? What is there to understand? Whoever did this, wants us to contact him. Yes. That is his aim. Butut not we... ...he wiii contact us Butut now? How? Swamy, can you teii us... ...why did that P.M.F. terrorist phone you oniy? Butecause everyone knows that oniy Swami Satyanand... ...is the true weii-wisher of this country. Can you teii us about your conversation? And what did you say? i toid him what a true patriot shouid have. Vioience is not the soiution to any probiem. i assured him... ...that i'ii piace his demands before the government. Tiii then he shouid not resort to vioience. He has agreed. What is his demand? That day he didn't specify it. Butut within two days... ...he wiii. Tiii then i request you journaiists... ...not to create terror among the masses. You said you had phoned the coiiector... ...so that someone from the P.M.F. contacts you. Through which you can reach iqbai? Then where does Swami Satyanand come in the picture? And why is he iying that you contacted him? i don't understand what he has got to do with this? There is something fishy. i've got to find out. Speaking. Why did you iie to the press... -...that i phoned you? i didn't recognise you. Who is speaking? i am the man from P.M.F.... ...who is going to piant a bomb in J.C. hospitai. i was awaiting your phone caii. Where can we meet? You teii me. At the border. Done. Probiem soived. Think twice, Arjun. Suppose he sends the poiice instead? Aarti, if the poiice comes then Satyanand is honest. Suppose someone eise comes in piace of the poiice? Greetings. Peace be upon you. Same to you. Do you know your entry in the gang has strengthened it? Our organisation is at its peak now. Hence some of them are trying to defame it. One such person... ...is at the border near the snow-capped mountain. i want him. Aiive. Okay. Friendship! What kind of friendship is this? We were ready to die for each other! And today?! We are ready to kiii each other?! is this friendship? Teii me?! You had sworn to protect peopie! You had promised to destroy the ones who spread terror! You were born on this iand... ...and today you want to ruin it? No! ! This is not my country it oniy beiongs to you peopie! it is easy to give sermons. Butut when you experience it oniy then you wiii know Had you been in my piace... ...you wouid have done the same thing! My bravery! My duty! My fideiity Do you know what i got in-iieu of it? My happiness, dreams... ...my desires... everything got ruined! A bomb was piaced here! Here! And i, an expert in decoding bombs... ...couidn't defuse the bomb piaced in my heart. That bomb expioded. That was R.D.X. Which is iight compared to others and is piastic based. Hence terrorists groups make more use of this. The most important thing during an emergency... ...is decoding a bomb. We wiii discuss its defusing tomorrow. So many cars at this hour? it is... ...not our iand that has been defeated. Butut our sentiments. Our faith! This iand is ours. And we shaii achieve it. Consequences... ...be whatsoever! Give me my shawi,Zaira Quick Father, where are you going? Come aiong. There is a vacant iand outside the viiiage. There is tension regarding it from the past few months. The matter is in the court. Butut whenever Satyanand comes... ...he provokes these youngsters. We shaii not iet them seize our iand! ! Never! We have got to take a decision! Either it is them or us! Mr. Ahmed Khan, piease remain quiet! We won't iisten to your sermons today! Tonight there shaii be bioodshed! Yes! Butiood! Then go ahead! Kiii everyone! Kiii each and everyone! Butut before kiiiing just think once... ...whom are you going to kiii? The ones whom you caii uncie, aunt, brother and sister? Go ahead! You want to put an end to this dispute, don't you? Then put an end to the age oid reiation! Lay heaps of corpses for a piece of smaii iand! You wiii kiii each other then... Then what? Has bioodshed ever been a soiution to any dispute? Has hatred and vengeance been a soiution to any probiem? Rafiq, you teii me! No. Probiems are soived with iove... ...trust and peace. And sow everything here! Here, in your hearts! i have seen iot of bioodshed. Partition! The wounds are stiii fresh. We endured the pain but you won't be abie to. You wait, my chiidren. For God sake go away. Go away! Go away! Aiiah Aimighty i'm going on Haj. Piease accept my prayers. Father! No! Father! Father! What are you waiting for? Every singie iife is precious to me. Go phone the doctor caii ambuiance. Go hurry up. Butut the poiice? What poiice? What wiii they do? No one wiii do anything! We have to do everything! Got it? Go! Hurry up! Oh God! This chiid! Pick her up! Take her soon in my car. Quick! Stand iike this oniy with your heads bowed down. Shed tears and watch the sight. Do you know who he was? Our weii wisher. His iife was very important. Aii of you couid have sacrificed your iives for him. He wanted to go on Haj. That was his iast desire. Butut aias! A man who aiways spoke about peace and iove, got kiiied? Why? For a piece of iand? Give it away! We don't want anything! Give whatever they ask for! Butut i want his iife back! Ask them! Ask them for it! Can they return it? No! i am sorry Mr. Shah. Your preachings are aii very nice. Butut i can't afford to iose my peopie... ...by treading on your path. Danger! ! Let every city be informed... ...to protect women and chiidren! Teii everyone there is danger! Butrother. i saw his death. Butut what happened in the entire country... ...in fact what is happening. You are a journaiist You must be aware of it Teii me why is it so?! Why?! Butut now we are not aione. The P.M.F. is protecting us. And i am with them. The enemy of our community is Satyanand. And weii-wisher, Shah Aiam. Now it wiii be fight to death! And tiii my iast breath, i shaii fight for my community! Now no one can stop me. No one! it wouid be better if you don't obstruct my way. Or eise... Or what? You'ii kiii me? Butefore that i wiii kiii you! You want to ease your pain by hurting others?! You want to seek vengeance of your peopie's death... ...by kiiiing innocent peopie?! So much of hatred?! There is a fire of hatred burning in me too! it's because of you that my father is in jaii! Grandma is aiways crying! Sarita gets nightmares! So shouid i take up arms, too?! And kiii everyone?! Want to save your community? This way your community wiii perish instead! Butecause they aiso have a iimit to endure everything! Reiigion! Which reiigion teaches you to hate each other?! Create a waii of differences between one another?! To kiii peopie of the other community?! Go and ask a hard working man, a iabourer! He is neither bothered about tempie nor mosque! He oniy wants two square meais! No reiigion beiieves in bioodshed! Don't you understand this smaii thing? That some peopie for their vested interest... ...are creating fights between us? To keep the fire burning in their house they are kiiiing others! When an educated man can yet trapped in their pioy... ...what wiii happen to our country?! Teii me! You think... Satyanand is responsibie for whatever happened with you? No! Even Shah Aiam! They are one! You were a bomb expert. They needed you. They iaid a ciever trap in order to entice you! To reach you, i iied... ...that i am pianting a bomb in J.C.hospitai. Satyanand caiied me here.

Butut now i won't iet that happen! We have to fight another war for independence! And save this country from the iikes of Satyanand and Shah Aiam! We have got to show them... ...our strength unity and power! And you wiii come with me! Carefui! Hurry up! Quick! What happened? Hitherto, i was oniy fooiing the worid. Butut this boy made a fooi out of me. Who? D.i.G. Uday Singh's son, Arjun. Yes. He used to phone me in the name of P.M.F. Butut what is more astonishing is... ...that he has escaped from our ciutches. That too aiongwith your iqbai. Butut Swamiji, they are friends. iqbai knows everything about me. if they escape from our ciutches... ... we won't be abie to escape from the ciutches of the iaw! Have patience! The worid is very smaii. Where wiii they go? As for the iaw, it is sitting with you here. Arrangements wiii be made. We managed to come here, Arjun... ...but they are aiso very powerfui. They won't sit with their hands tied. Now what, Arjun? Now there wiii be a game. Butut the pawns wiii be theirs... ...and we'ii make the move. in my name? This audacity?! A government that runs on my money is now... They wiii drag Shah Aiam to the court?! The one before whom no one has the guts to speak... ...wiii be questioned! This journaiist is very excited! Butut now no more drama. Find that duo and put an end to this story! Yes? it is me... ...the one you are iooking for. Thought i'd meet you once before going to the court. You? Sureiy you wiii meet... ...not me, but your death! Where are you speaking from? Just teii me where you are. in your house. i'm coming up. Stay there! How did Arjun get here? Go iook for him! Come out! A death-merchant and such a coward? i thought you wouid be very brave. Butut you are trembiing iike a dry ieaf. Want to iive! They aiso wanted to iive. Whom you kiiied in the biast and riots. Did you iet them iive? it wouid be better if come to the court tomorrow. if you try to ieave this country i wiii kiii you. Butecause you are constantiy under my vigiiance. Swamiji! That Arjun... He has come here? i'ii go! No? Thank God. What happened Shah Aiam? What happened! He piaced a dagger on my neck in my own house. Has summoned me to the court tomorrow. And that means the gaiiows. Butut i won't go to the gaiiows aione. The noose wiii be around you neck you know it. Do something besides just smiiing and shaking your hand! You iose patience very soon. He wiii not go to the court. Don't cry. Didn't you say that truth aiways triumphs. Yes. i'ii prove that in court tomorrow. That won't be necessary. Grandma, go in. No. Let it be. Why fear ascetics? i drive away the fear of my devotees. My devotees are my strength. Hence i don't take services from gangsters and dons. Senior poiice officers, Ministers... ...poiiticians: are my bodyguard. At my service are the M.L.As. This country's big and smaii poiitician... ...breathe afterwards... ...first they take my name. You are surprised, aren't you? You shouid be. Such a powerfui man... ...has personaiiy come to your house. Why? Butecause you... ...fear going to the gaiiows. i had heard that you are a very enthusiastic journaiist. Now i am convinced too. You know quite a iot about me. Not quite a iot, but everything. i know that you have a hand in the bomb biasts. it is at your behest that riots take piace. You are not a saint, but a beast. i know that you wouidn't come out of your iayer easiiy. To hunt you down, i have to create terror. Hence, i didn't kiii your friend Shah Aiam. And today... ...you have come to taik to me? Now there wiii be no taiking: it'ii be just war. War. if so, oniy i triumph! Oniy time wiii decide your fate. Now get used to sieeping on the fioor... ...in the darkness with the mosquitoes. Butecause very soon you wiii go to jaii. it's impending doom that drives you crazy. instead of sending me to jaii... ...you shouid be thinking of getting your father out of jaii. i can do that very easiiy. One phone caii and he wiii be free. Butut in iieu of that, you must... Give iqbai to you? Yes! Butesides your father's reiease you'ii get everything you ask for. A pimp can oniy taik about deaiings. And you are born one. Okay. i wiii make a deai. Butut of your iife. Of your destruction. Destruction! You know not, the powers i possess. if i wish... ...then aiongwith you... ...i can't destroy your famiiy members in one second. it wiii not even take a second to biow your brains off. Can your bodyguards save you now? Can you caii those poiitician and minister now? Can you caii your foreign devotees? if i kiii you, you wiii become a martyr. i can't make that mistake. i want to expose you before the pubiic. So that the poiice officers who kiss your hand... ...shouid handcuff you and drag you to jaii! There are peopie who touch your feet. You ought to beg of them for mercy! Go! Run away Go! Son. There is a proverb. Too much knowiedge can prove to be dangerous. Listen carefuiiy. You must be knowing... ...that you had informed me on phone... ...that you are going to piant a bomb in J.C. Hospitai. i iiked your voice so much. i recorded it. i know. You were not serious about it. Butut i took it seriousiy. i fuifiiied your job... ...by pianting a bomb in the hospitai. if you go to there with your friend... ...then death wiii weicome you. And if... ...you come with your friend to the court. Then there wiii be an expiosion in the hospitai. And aiongwith thousands of peopie... ...your iove for your country and friend wiii be biown to pieces. And you wiii go straight to your father. Undoubtediy, victory shaii be mine at any cost. You have to decide. One friend. Or thousands of probiems i... ...shaii await your phone caii. Do wait. Butut not for my phone caii. ...but for your death. Go! Long iive Swami Satyanand! Long iive Swami Satyanand! Butiess you! Butiess you! Run! There is a bomb! Quick! Run! Move! Where is the bomb? in the basement. Uday Singh, do you wish to say anything in your defence? Do you have any witness or evidence. Yes, Your Honour! i request the court to aiiow me to... ...piead this case! What is the truth? Who has a hand in making you a terrorist? What reiation do you have with Shah Aiam? Your honour. i have been brought here... ...to speak the truth. And whatever i'm going to say is the truth. i know Mr. Shah Aiam. He is a nice man. He is iike an eider brother to us. This man is trying to trap me to save his father. Traitor! ! Traitor! ! i wiii kiii you! ! You fear these peopie! ! is this your own statement? Yes. Even this court spares you, but i won't! i wiii kiii you and your masters! What is aii this? Come to the witness box... ...if you wish to say something. is this a court room or a farce being enacted? Can a thug threaten to kiii peopie iike this? He is being forced to iie! i know him from many years. He is a very decent and patriotic person. Such a man is being threatened? That too in front of the court? You are crossing your iimits. i'm sorry that i couidn't controi myseif. Butut, your honour! i stiii have some witnesses. Permit me to summon minister Sharad Patii. ...to the witness box. You may. Did you sign, my father... ...D.i.G. Uday Singh's arrest warrant? Yes, i did. What for? Butecause he did a very dangerous thing. He gave refuge to a terrorist in his house. Heiped him. Terrorist? Yes. A terrorist whose name is iqbai Khan. This one! i don't know. Couid be... Meaning? You are not very sure? Actuaiiy, i can't know every terrorist personaiiy, can i? You see, D.C.P. Chautaia toid me and i signed it. This means... ...that if your D.C.P. Chautaia... ...caiis Mr Satyanand a terrorist... ...you wiii agree. No, how is that possibie? He had proof, too. Mr. Chautaia No you accept that iqbai Khan is a terrorist? Your siience says that you arrested D.i.G. Uday Singh... ...as a resuit of some conspiracy! At someone's behest! if iqbai is not a terrorist ...then my father's arrest is a crime! For which the minister and Chautaia shouid be punished! The number of days and nights my father spent in jaii... ...on account of that shouid be taken from them! No! No! Your honour! He is a terrorist! Butefore my very eyes, he kiiied three peopie. Uday Singh heiped him so i arrested him. The minister and Chautaia both are right. iqbai is a dangerous terrorist. Just now this man, whose name is Shah Aiam... ...who is a very respectabie man... ...said that iqbai is his friend. Whom he knows from many years. Now what does this mean, i don't have to expiains that. iqbai wiii say the rest. Yes, i am a terrorist. A murderer! i have finished everything! Lost everything. Mother! A friend iike Arjun! This country! Peopie's trust! Everything! This man... ...who aiways considered me as his son. Butecause of me he has been put to shame. And the one responsibie for aii this is Shah Aiam! i have aii evidence against him! He poisoned my mind. i became biind. Not oniy me, he has misiead thousands of peopie. Provoked hatred in them! Save them, your honour! Save them too! Oniy then wiii my country, my nation, be saved! Controi yourseif. The faise statement that iqbai gave in the beginning. ...was at my behest. Had he spoken the truth eariier... ...then perhaps Shah Aiam wouid refuse to recognise him. Hence it was necessary to enact this farce. On the basis of the prima facie evidence... ...the court is sure that Shah Aiam took the iead... ...in the bomb biasts and riots. Hence the court orders his arrest... ...and start an inquiry against him. What are you doing? Leave! You can't arrest me! i wish to say something! Your honour, there is some misunderstanding. i'm just a pawn, the reai mastermind is someone eise! And that is Swami Satyanand. i am ready to expose his activities before the court. You are iying. This man is the enemy of our community. Hence in a fit of vengeance he is iying. Does he have any proof? Does he? Not at aii There is Swamiji SSwamiji, save me! i have served you a iot. i beg of you! Piease save me! Save me, Swamiji Wiii he save himseif or you? He is the man who pianted a bomb... ...in J.C. hospitai at the Swami's behest. No! He had pianted a bomb, Your honour. How did you know? Butecause you had toid me on phone. is it? Then why didn't you inform the poiice? He did aii this to trap me. Speak! Speak! Yes, at Swamiji's behest. Did you see, just by puiiing one string. ...everyone got dragged. Actuaiiy they are aii birds of the same feather. Swami Satyanand and Shah Aiam... ...have created tension aii over the nation. Expioiting reiigious and caste sentiments... ...they are hunting us! They are trying to create differences between peopie! And minister iike him are supporting them! These are the peopie... ...who are hand-in-giove with iawyers and pimps! Peopie have no roofs over their head... ...but even the bathrooms of these peopie are air conditioned! Peopie are starving to death. Butut their famiiies go on hoiiday tours abroad! Poiiticians, god-men and Mafia are stuck to our country... ...iike termites! They have made it hoiiow from within They are responsibie for riots that took piace ...from 1 94 7 to 1 997! These peopie are behind every kiiiing... ...right from Gandhi to Gandhi! These peopie suppiy arms from Punjab to Kashmir! They are the ones who torch mosques and tempies! Do you know why, You Honour? Butecause iaw in this country moves at the pace of a turtie! A Committees wiii be formed: inquiry commissions wiii be set up! And after 5 or 1 0 years, when the report finaiiy arrives... ..it wiii be ciosed in some fiie forever! And these peopie wiii continue unhindered. These are separate countries for every reiigion in this worid. There are Hindu countries, isiamic nations and Christian iands. india is the oniy country... ..that has piace for every reiigion in its heart. Butut the way they are creating differences.. ...dividing our nation... ...there wiii come a time when our country... ...wiii vanish from the worid map forever! Forever! A ioveiy sermon indeed, son! Butut what do you think... ...that if you impress the court.. ...the worid wiii turn topsy turvy? No. What punishment wiii the court give? A few days of imprisonment? Every prison is iike my ashram. i have my discipies there. i shaii pray to estabiish my contact with the Aimighty. And then be free. Think about yourseif! Your own seif. Do you hear the chaos outside? They are aii my discipies. At my instance, they wiii wreak destruction! Ascetic! if i wanted, i couid have kiiied you iong ago. Butut the hope that the court had aroused in us.. ...by summoning even the President to court... ...is what made me trust it. Hence, i got you here. As for the masses, they know everything about you now. With the Judge's permission, the entire proceedings... ...of this court are being teiecast iive on teievision. The court orders him to be arrested! Swamiji, there is mayhem! Let me go in. impostor! Scoundrei! You cheat us?! Buteat him up! Peace! You caused fights in the name of reiigion?! Butreak his bones! Don't spare him! i .. i am the protector of iaw. Don't beat me. i have served you a iot Long iive the Swami! Did you see what happens when the masses unite?! Didn't i teii you that you wiii be at the feet... .. of those who bow before you? Look! Look at the power of the masses! The end of the iikes of you is near. Not oniy here but in the entire worid. Long iive independence! Long iive independence!
