 

                        About 60 years ago, a woman threw herself from the overpass and committed suicide... that's why the remains were only the upper part of the body, cut from the train... Since then, local kids start rumors about the appearance of a ghost that's an upper torso. In recent years, their have been bodies found separated in two. Therefore, re-enacting the rumours elementary school students tell of the Teke Teke. Rie-Nee-chan? Are you also looking for information on the Teke Teke? I'm also investigating the recent murders... That girl... She was your friend? At nightfall, the Teke Teke appears on the overpass... It then walks around looking for a prey. When the person turns around, it surely kills them. If the victim manages to escape... ...it kills them within three days. And what if, that night, I saw the Teke Teke... Does it means I'll die tomorrow? Kana... If I'm not mistaken, you said that she fell off the overpass, right? She got rid of all things red. Red things? Clothing, furniture -everything that was red. Did you know the place where the victim lived? Yes, I know. I'll let him take you there. The landlord's daughter still lives there. Do you know why Reiko killed herself? No. Just between us... ...an American soldier assaulted her. She was also still a virgin at the time. And so, you know, she would bleed. And that's the reason why she doesn't like the color red. You shouldn't believe half of the things she says. I lived close by, but I never heard of that story. Anyway, no American soldier would be in this area. Maybe the Teke Teke really exists... In the area she committed suicide, there is a memorial built. And when a strong earthquake hit, the memorial fell down. So maybe if you put the memorial back in it's place... The memorial is just a stone, right? Are you listening? Then what should we do!? I saw her that same day you did... I saw that monster... Reiko Kashima That's it! Do it quickly! - Maybe the red is no good. - What? - She hates red and goes after it! If that's true, the car is red! Get rid of all the red! "One Year Later" "Investigating Kashima-san" Reiko Kashima... If chant this, you can be able to exorcise the evil spirit. Kashima-san, Kashima-san, Kashima-san. The things people write... - Oh really? You were in Kakogawa? Sorry I came so suddenly. It's ok, we never get visitors since we moved here. Long time no see. Do you remember me? It's Takeda. I will now be going to college in this area. Would you like some tea? Kana - chan!? Ever since her cousin died, she has been like this. All year? I brought something for you... Kana, what's wrong!? I'll come back from work later. Can you go home yourself? That's all. Here's your new medication. Be careful, okay? Teke Teke 2 Hurry up! I'm fast enough, no? Come on, as if every day you see a murder scene. Murder? It wasn't an accident? They were sliced straight in half. It must be have been premeditated. Yeah, I guess... Hurry now! Hold on a minute! Are you okay? It's already been cleaned up, huh? Well, It is already past noon. It's getting late... Wait a little bit more.. A little bit... Ok? That person... Maybe a relative... Reiko, let's interview him? Why would we? Well, I'll go then. Izumino All-girls Highschool Teke Teke? Izumino All-girls Highschool Teke Teke? Yeah... Elementary students tell it a lot. You haven't heard of it? One winter in Hokkaido, a woman ran in front of a train, And got cut right in half. Her body split. Exactly. But it was very cold, and the blood didn't disperse. And the upper half of the body was said to have moved. And after a long time, they say on the pedestrian bridge that a ghost appears of a legless woman who chases people. If you see her the Teke Teke will cut you in half. Are you trying to say that yesterday was because of her? Reiko, are you scared? Of course not... Not only yesterday's accident... Last year there was one in Setagaya. People say she was there too. Oh, you mean at the pedestrian bridge where that girl got cut in half? Yes and you know, the perpetrator hasn't been caught? And they say that the girl, along with the one that died recently, both attended the same school and were classmates. You're lying! But do not worry, When you cross the bridge, get rid of everything red. Bridge? I heard it was a railway crossing. And in high school, they say that, you must chant "Kashima -san". And if you say that, then everything will be fine. Kashimas' "ka" is similar to the word for mask. The part "shi" is the word for dead. And the part "ma" like the word akuma (demon). What kind of garbage is that? No, it's true! Enough fooling around. People died after all... She's scared, huh? She always used to love scary stories. But, if all these rumors are true, we are all very unlucky. Why? Red neckties. - You where talking to him last night, why was that? Well, what do you expect me to do with him? Tone-san. You've missed yesterday's meeting at the culture festival. Sorry, I forgot. That's was you always do, right? When you come, what will you do? I apologized. It isn't a big deal, so no reason to be angry. Right? Yeah, it really isn't. Well, everyone is trying hard. Selfishness of one brings trouble to the whole class. I'm sorry, okay? I'll help next time. That's a promise. Reiko, you're so brave! In what sense? You're not afraid Tone-san? No, why not? Besides, the truth is on my side. Well, I guess so... What should our class present at the festival? I still think it's better to perform. Chihiro wants to put something in. I don't want to put anything in... And now I would like to decide what we'll present at the festival. If anyone has suggestions, do not hesitate. Does anyone have anything? We don't have anything at all. Chihiro; You kind of wanted to put something in. I do not have anything. Chairman, what are you gonna do? DepartmentofJournalism uh, Okubo-san... Did you photographed the recent basketball game? Ah, I'm sorry... I forgot... How about I do a report for the next match? The article with surely be on time. - It'll be here. - Okay! Sounds good! I'm here... Wait a little. Natsuki-chan, do you want to come with us? I would, but... The rest you can finish tomorrow! And by the way, we will invite along Chihiro. Right Rika? Yep, all good. Will you come, Natsuki-chan? Come on, let's go! Delicious! Yea, It's quite good. Natsuki-chan, you bought this watch yourself? Yeah, from the department store. Wow, so cute! Can I see it? So cute! - It truly is! - So cute! Natsuki-chan, are you Nakashima's friend? Yes, we're in the same circle. You know, I wouldn't suggest that. Rika is better for you right? Maybe now you'll hang out with us. Chihiro hangs out with us now. Let's eat. Ah, here she comes. Our class chairman. Today too, huh? Really gettin' sick of it... Sayako Ayama gets everything she wants. It's childish to hear her talk like that. But what kind of person do you think I am? It's ok. I'm not as sensitive as you, Natsuki. Let's go. I wondered why you suddenly called me, about Reiko Kashima again. Sorry... It reminded me of that horrid coffee you would make. The current secretary makes wonderful coffee. However, it is lacking in some place. I'm sorry... Nothing can be done now, and by the way- Investigative Journal , Investigator - Shoichi Yoshida Shoichi Yoshida? Investigative Journal , Investigator - Shoichi Yoshida Investigative Journal , Investigator - Shoichi Yoshida That's the investigator for the Reiko Kashima case. It's because you seem to be absolutely desperate for answers. I looked around and finally got my hands on these documents. You owe me. All of it is somewhat strange and obscure. However, there was actually a rape that occurred. Sometimes the locals can create rumors. So the criminals weren't soldiers or in the army? This investigator seemed to have a different opinion. According to him, the criminals were three young men. All three had the same last name; Numazaki. However, they aren't related. Just a common name in the area. On that day, there is evidence that Reiko Kashima was seen with three guys. Then why where they were not arrested? Reiko Kashima testified that the perpetrator was American. I don't get it... And what happened to the three guys? All three died in a accident on the train tracks. December 10th Received a call from the office in Kobe. Numazaki Hiroshi, Masao, Kenzo... where hit when crossing the train tracks. It was pronounced instant death. All three were up from night until morning. There is reason to believe that at that time they were intoxicated. The 10th was the third anniversary of Reiko Kashimas' death. I am not sure what to think of this connection. To my sincere regret, this investigation has come to an end. On the day of the incident, Reiko Kashima was spotted with three men by a teenager... named Tokyu Kondo. Kondo... You shouldn't believe half of the things she says. I lived close-by,but i never heard of that story. Anyway,no American soldier would be in this area. Tokyu Kondo... "Godie" "Idiot" Out of the way! Something wrong? My wallet was gone. You had it in your bag? It was just here. My wallet is missing. Reiko, what are you doing? When you were out of gym, where did you go Hakayama-san? - Huh? - You would have seen who took it, no? Wait a minute. I just had a stomach ache and I went to the toilet. - You think it was me? - What do I do Sayaka? - Reiko, come on... - Well, who else? And where's your evidence? - Let's look for a little more - It's useless! It was stolen. You don't know for sure. You can't blame someone so soon. Yeah, what Natsuki-chan said. You're the one who doesn't always lock her locker. And you know that... It's only herself to blame. Hey-You can't just yell at Sayaka. Natsuki. Rika wants you. Yeah, but... It's fine. Go have fun. I forgot that I have plans. Ready to go? Don't talk to that thing. Well... See you tomorrow. So, next song? No - I don't really want to. You must be hungry, huh? Maybe pizza? But I don't have no money. Hey, don't worry about it. I'll treat you. A burger? What happened to Nakashima today... I thought no one would guess. Sayaka got the brunt of it. I don't know what you mean. What happened was horrible. Next time do it yourself. We don't do it everyday, idiot. What are you talking about? um, Okobo-san, what's going on? It's ok, just eat. You mean to say, Tone-san... Took Reiko's wallet? Chihiro, you knew? What's done is done. Reiko built her own path. She's right. I can't believe it. That's a crime. Well, in that case... Here ya' go. You had so much fun singing here today, huh? Loud at first, and now silent? Natsuki, don't act hastily. So, that means that Natsuki-chan should take it. Yeah, a true friend should feel obligated to return it. Here. Get rid of it. You aren't any better than us. Well, let's go. Teke Teke? Yeah...Elementary students talk about it a lot. But don't worry. When you cross the bridge, get rid of everything red. The overpass... Red things... Hello, is this Haiyako? Yes... Yeah, don't worry about it. I'm sorry I thought it was you today. I guess I dropped it somewhere. So... I want to apologize to you... Can you come meet me? You know what I'll say... I know exactly what you're up to... Why do I have to come along with you? I have no idea what she would do if I came alone. She said so much before. If you say it to be true, it will. Damn, it's cold. Isn't it? Nakashima-san! You're not going to apologize, but do something else? I know what you're doing. Something wrong? You don't hear that strange sound? Sorry to bother you. Ah, you again. If you want my wife... she gone right now. That's ok... I actually came to ask you a few questions. Me? This journal belonged to the investigator of the Reiko Kashima case. As you said earlier, the perpetrators of the incident weren't American soldiers. Even if so... What do you mean? This investigator, even after the death of Kashima Reiko... continued investigating. And in the records, it says a teenager saw the people who commited the crime the day. His name was... Tokyu Kondo. It was you, 60 years ago. Can you tell me, what you saw that day? It was a long time ago... I forgot everything. Seems Kenzo Numazaki was close to you... Although, in his village he was known as a bully. For you he was like an older brother next door. Get out. What do you want? Talking about all this, what you want to hear? If you found it, read it yourself. The Teke Teke... Reiko Kashima is killing people. If I'm not mistaken, you understand what I'm saying. What Kenzo did to that girl is true. That day, I skipped school to play in the mountains. Stop! Please! I heard someone shouting and went to go see. I was scared... I immediately recognized the men. These three were always loitering. Word got out when she broke silence. However, one of the criminals, Hiroshi Numazaki... was the son of the chairman. The adults feared that word would spread.... That's when she covered her mouth. At some point, rumors spread that it was men from military troops. And the truth about what happened, was covered up by assumptions. Then she killed herself. And that was the end of that part. You know what happened to the three men? All three were killed in a train wreck... It was quite bloody. They were torn to shreds. It's because of her curse. It all caused a lot of noise in the town. Torn to shreds... "NumaZaki" (Note: He is extracting components of the name Numazki) (Elements: "Katana", "Mouth", "Mountain", "Big", "Encouraging") Reiko was questioned by police yesterday. What would be the point of killing Sayaka? Isn't it obvious? Revenge for everything! Revenge! Are you stupid? It can't be. And where's Saki? I don't think she's sick. I think she's still in shock. It happened right in front of her. And Nao? She had an excuse too. What kind of garbage? Natsuki, you still here? Please don't report me to the police. I don't even know anything anyway... What's the matter? What are you hiding? My... What does this mean? - It's not... - This proves it. Of course. You're their friend... - Listen... - Don't touch me! Reiko! There's nothing else to say... What you said was true. The Teke Teke is real. That day, I called Hayama-san to the overpass, So the Teke Teke could finish her. What do you mean? I wonder who's next. What? Hey, are the articles and photos in for the basketball game? uh, yeah, Okobo put them in. But it's not here. Really? She said she would do everything today? She really didn't? Hey, where is Okobo-san? - A classmate and her when home together early. - Classmate? Yeah... Okubo-san! What was she thinking? Calling me to meet... Okubo-san! This is what happens when you cross the tracks. Do you fully understand now? Who do you think should be next? All those who made a fool of me, will burn in hell. Stop it! Go on then... Stop me. DemonBuster!!Anotherattack! Notasinglewitness! "uppertorso" "Lowertorso" "Dismembered body" "Serial murders, Schoolgirls found dismembered!" "Mysterious series of murdered highschool girls" "3 victims" "Mao Okobo" "Sayaka Hayama" "Kana Ohashi" Really, and your friend suffered the same fate? Sorry for coming so suddenly... It's ok, but, I don't think I can help you. She wasn't one to keep a grudge. um, may I visit her shrine? Yes, of course. We have a guest now, but please come in. Please sit. Thank you. Sorry, for your loss. Thank you very much. Wait! I want to ask you something! I don't feel like it. You know something about Kano-san. Hold it! I saw the Teke Teke. You know something. Where did you see it? The train tracks. Do you wanna talk? Reiko finished off both of them? You seriously think so? Maybe you should check yourself into an asylum. But, then wouldn't we be next? Yeah... It would, only naturally... I'm just worried Rika. Is something happens it's all my fault, right? Then who's fault is it? What is it? I wanted to talk about something... Can you come here? What's going on? Come on. You scared? I hope you don't think it's too strange. Or do you want to guess what will happen? Please don't go! It's all for revenge. She's already killed two people! Hey, just listen! It's interesting, no? Let's go see. She's just trying to intimidate us, right? And if it comes to that, we'll beat her. Great idea! Like when she goes home. And will you guys come? Reiko Kashima? I've studied that incident in Kakogawa. Kana-chan was also convinced that the Teke Teke and Reiko Kashima where related. My friend told me... her name is Reiko Nakashima. Reiko Nakashima? Reiko Kashima... I want to stop Reiko. I'm afraid this girl is directing the Teke Teke. But, it shows that she is weak. Because she is utilizing the Teke Teke. And why do that? All those who made a fool of me will burn in hell. "Reiko Kashima" Look. In all the victims names, mandatory character particles are then connected with Numazaki. Sekiguchi, as to guchi ("mouth") Hirayama as to yama ("mountain") Oohashi as to ooki ("large") Whose Numazaki? Sixty years ago, they were the criminals, who raped Reiko Kashima. Hold on. It's true. Saki-chan has none of those characters. So she didn't kill her. Everything happening now, is all because of Reiko Kashima's curse? What else could it be? After all those girls and Numazaki... Apart from similar elements in the name, this has to be the reason she kills them. That means it won't stop then? I don't know... urban legends... Reality becomes fiction and fiction becomes reality. And monsters start to crawl everywhere... For example, Reiko Kashima starts up when people talk. There is a version during wartime where she lost both legs... Or, the version that she was a dancer and got her legs cut off in a car accident. And I heard the version of the Teke Teke, Where she lived in Hokkaido and died on the overpass. And so... With all that I found, it's still strange. We can't tell if it's true or not. I think I got something... This is the character for "water", right? Natsuki MiZutani ("MiZu"-"Water") And you, Takeda -san? No, I'm okay... Wait. Tone Marika "Tou"("Sword") Who are these people? Anyone cold? Reiko! Well, let's go? No. No one picked up the phone. All four of them. But, if the Teke Teke is going for them, we can't doing anything. They say, if you have time to say an incantation, you can protect yourself from it. Incantation? And you really believe that? No, it's just written in books. Instead of talking, we have to think. A place where nobody goes, away from the train tracks, Train tracks... Where there are no people... Hikari! Scared me! Stop it! Coward! I'm not afraid... - I don't see Reiko - Probably already sitting at home. She called and then turned back? Pathetic... - I need the toilet. - What? Can't you wait? - Can't you wait? - Nope, catch up later... What is it? Hikari? Nakashima? Is that you? Don't stop, let's go! Do you hear that? What? Come on, are you a coward? Enough already, come on. How long are you going to hide? Come on. Reiko... All four are dead. Reiko, you're wrong! You can't control the Teke Teke. The Teke Teke controls you! She killed them all! So what? You just using her. I don't care... So cold! The Teke Teke is close. It seems so... Reiko, let's go! I told you not to touch me! - Do you want to die!? - Yes, I want to die! Reiko... Please... Run! Quickly! Yes! The spell! The spell! Kashima-san, Kashima-san, Kashima-san! It doesn't work. Kashima's "ka" to the word for mask. Kashima's "shi" is the word for dead The part "ma"... Kashimas' "ma" is the word for demon! Reiko... Forgive me... I'm sorry... Thank you... not to be redistributed or copied in any form.
