Born at a time when heads fell around her like cabbage stalks, - - to grow up at all was an achievement. To grow up to greatness was a miracle. HATFIELD HOUSE, ENGLAND NOVEMBER 16TH, 1558 - Mr. Parry. - Bills for gowns, shoes, caps! Where's the money to come from? No I didn't. That's all over! Mrs. Ashley. What have you done? Sit down and prepare yourself for some news. Bad news. I've just left my Lady Elizabeth. She received a message from London Her stepsister, Queen Mary, is ill - It's cruel to lose one's sister. - You mean Bloody Mary is dying? - She'll be dead by morning? - Dead as a doornail. - This means ... - Young Bess will be queen. Queen of England at the age of five and twenty. - Mrs. Ashley! - Mr. Parry! Do you remember the last little drink we had together? - Yes. It got us into trouble. - We mustn't overdo it this time. - Long live Young Bess. - Long live Queen Elizabeth. Well, when she sits on the throne, - I can safely say ... I did it. You're a remarkable woman. You've been no ordinary governess. Yours has been no easy task. A difficult child. All children are. Let alone a daughter of the monster, King Henry - And Anne Boleyn. - A dangerous mixture. Well, we're in harbor. - At last. - But it's been a stormy passage. Like the song of the seesaw: Here we go up, up, up - Up to the sky so high - Here we go down, down, down Bumpety-bump, goodbye. That's how it was. To start with, we were our father's darling. Those were the times when we went up, up, up. Up, up, up in the sky. So high. - Look. Your future Queen Elizabeth - Just like her father. There's breeding for you. No mistaking the fatherhood. - Henry, didn't I have a hand in it - Yes. But I gave you the idea. Don't scowl at me like that. Why don't you laugh like your mother? That's the way to win peoples' hearts. But Anne Boleyn laughed once too often and with the wrong people. She took three lovers with her. Old Harry did things in a big way. Come, we're no longer the future queen. The King doesn't want us. We're a nobody. So we were chased away from Court to Hatfield. Without a mother. Without a home. Old Harry took another wife and a son was born. He was heir to the throne. We were declared illegitimate. So we went down, down, down. Bumpety-bump. Goodbye. We'll never wear these shoes again They're full of holes. We have to see to it that our new stepmother likes us, - - our appearance, our little ways and our manners. Now Your Highness is back in your father's grace. Isn't it wonderful Your Highness! Now listen carefully. This one is German. Don't forget that. After all, it's not her fault. We can't pick and choose. What we need is a mother. Ist das meine liebe Tochter Elizabeth? Komm hier, mein Kind. Hab keine Angst, mein Liebling. I took one look at the King's face and knew what he was contemplating For him a change, for us, a ride to Hatfield. In no time we were back to be inspected by our fourth mother. Don't be stubborn. It can't hurt us to try again. This one is said to be beautiful. Your father is very much in love. Come in, child. I won't eat you. Don't stare at me like that. Say something. I made you legitimate out of the goodness of my big, fat heart. Doctor says it will kill me one day He's in the Tower reconsidering. Anne Boleyn's brat, I'll put you in the Tower if you dare defy me. You dare. I'm beginning to like you To my good health. Henry, please. No more wine tonight This is your new stepmother, child I can see you like her. I do, too. I like her very much. Come, my darling. I'm afraid we have to go home now. Back to Hatfield. Don't worry. The King will soon have us meet another stepmother. And another and another. Well, I will not come! Open the door, Bess. Please. It's Lord Thomas Seymour. He's to take you back to London. Bess, we're going back to Court. Those are the King's orders. You'll be the death of us both. My Lord Admiral. Will you come and talk to her? I can do nothing. I see. Leave it to me. I have a way with children. Good morning, Lady Elizabeth. The King sent me here to talk to you. - I've looked forward to it. - It will be a very short talk. - I've just begun. - I've finished. - I promised your stepmother ... - I've had too many! You can tell the King I said so. Will you please come closer to the door? - Well? - I'll tell the King that I failed - But only on one condition. - What condition? I want to have a look at you. Open the door and I'll come in. - Why? - I want to see your face and eyes - What for? - Can you come still closer? I have my ear against the door. Because of a woman I once knew and liked and laughed with. - Who? - We never speak her name. - My mother? - Yes. I know the King banned you from the Court because you're like her. Well then, come in. Come in and see for yourself. Well? - I can't see much from here. - Stay there. Keep the bargain! I always do. That's why I make so many friends. I don't need your friendship. I don't need your pity either. - What are you doing? - Opening so I can see you better. - We can drive back in the sunshine - You're full of tricks. - Don't you trust me? - No! If the King could see you like this he'd change his mind. You're so like him. The way you stand there, stubborn, suspicious. Exactly like him. Even down to wanting to throw the inkwell at me The King's daughter! And yet, there's something else in your face. I've seen it before. Her eyes. The slim nose. There's no another nose like this in England. I'd know it in a thousand. But where's her smile? She turned men's heads with that smile of hers. They made your childhood very unhappy. But you'll be as beautiful as she was, and everyone will fall for you That will save you from ever being lonely, as you are now. Bye, Lady Elizabeth. I'll tell the King I failed. He'll be surprised. Hitherto, I've been lucky with my missions. Goodbye. What has happened? What does this mean? Wait! Wait! This is your room. And this is where Mrs. Ashley will sleep. The Queen wanted you to have the nicest room overlooking the garden What's the matter? Don't you like it? - What's all this? - Caps, gowns, scarves. She thought you'd like them. Catherine. There was another Catherine. I grew to love her, but she was killed. - It can happen again. - It won't. - I could never be happy here. - You shall this time. The Queen is the sweetest woman in all God's world. How tall you are. You're almost a grown woman. I'm glad you're here. I'm told you have brains to match your looks. And a charming companion to me and the little Prince of Wales. Edward needs a sister, and I need ... what shall we call you? A younger sister or a daughter. Will you like that? The chief thing is that we've got you and we're going to keep you. Make way for the Prince of Wales. The Prince of Wales. Make way for the Prince of Wales. Make way for the Prince of Wales. - What a fuss, just because I come - Edward, is that you? - You heard the idiots shout. - But it's the middle of the night I had to wait till Mother Jack went to sleep. I'm a prisoner in my room - Come let me look at you. - I wanted to show you this. It's a model of the Admiral's flagship. He gave it to me himself - I like my Uncle Tom. - Edward, I'm so happy. - About what? - I love the Queen. We're friends. She won't last. What did you say? She won't last. Take care, you're smashing my ship. Edward, will you answer me? I order you to tell me everything you know - Is she in danger? - You're hurting me. - I think the King wants a change. - A change? She contradicts him, and nobody's supposed to contradict my father. When I'm king, if anybody contradicts me, they'll be execute - You don't know what you're saying - They quarrel about religion. Well, I hope the French come in time to save her. They'll invade us. Perhaps they'll kill the King before he kills her. - But they'll have to hurry. - I don't believe you. Don't you? Come on with me. Why should you care? The King's will and wish means nothing to you! The King's law is not heeded by his own wife. What a sad spectacle! - You plead for a heretic? - You see! After the execution, they'll send you back to Hatfield. - Anything in sight? - Nothing, Lord Admiral. Keep looking. First man to sight the French fleet gets an extra grog Signal Burnell. Tell him to fill in that gap in the line. The biggest fleet ever gathered against us. The danger is real. Ned, the King's barge is coming for the ladies. You should go with them - We want to stay for the fighting - Will you lead a boarding party? Why not? Are we so sure we can beat them that we have women on board? That was your idea. - Is this a war or a picnic? - A picnic, sir. That's the spirit. That's what I like to hear. - Don't you agree, spoilsport? - Not with overconfidence. - Did you forget their 300 ships? - No, and they didn't forget me! - I broke the blockade in Boulogne - Glorious nonsense. Glorious performance. Were there ever two brothers less alike, fighting like cats? Archbishop, tell them what happened to the Kilkenny Cats. Just a moment, Your Majesty. - How do you feel, Cranmer? - A little better. - How is Mrs. Cranmer? - Very well indeed. - You're not afraid of me, are you? - No. What reason could there be? They say in this document that while I was in France, - - you authorized a translation of the Bible into English. Could you hurt my feelings allowing this jewel to be translated? - Who am I to use the royal power? - Who did it then? - Not I, Sire. - Who is cleverer than the King? Who between the church and the state thinks he can do as he pleases? Does Your Majesty forget that I was monarch while you were away? - No, Kate, I do not forget that. - I've pleaded for this translation I know. I still think that the word of God should be available for everybody. So you've become a learned doctor? - You're here to instruct us? - I never thought ... Quiet! Pretty business that I, in my old age, should be taught by my wife. Do you know what the law obliges me to do, even though I like you? Even though you're a very pretty woman. I like you very much. - Stop that hellcat screeching. - What is it? - The French! - Where? Out there. Tall ships. Coming up like clouds. - Top-man, what do you see? - Nothing, my Lord Admiral. - No trace of the French? - Not a sail in sight. I did see the ships for a moment. Perhaps they saw us and sailed away - Take that brat out of my sight. - No! Go, Lady Elizabeth. You'll go back to Hatfield. I don't want to ever see you again - I'll not go back to Hatfield. - What's that? - I'll not go back to Hatfield. - Sail ho! - What do you make of them? - Ships of the line. French. Nine, ten ... Bound for Portsmouth. The King's barge for the ladies. You! Come here. You're very lucky. Did you see the before they could see them up there - Yes. - Don't you know the world is round - They must be wrong. It's flat. - You shape the world as you want. Why not? Didn't you? So I did! And you're my daughter. Water! I never laughed so much in my life Thank you, Kate. Kate. Don't mourn. Look forward. I've told these gentlemen to honor and treat you as if I were alive. Come here, Ned. You ambitious, old horse. You can't wait for me to die. Don't lie to me. I know you're shrewd. You're my son's uncle. That's why I want you on the Council. But you're a cold fish. People don't like that. They like a man to laugh and drink with them. A man of courage. Tom! I want him on the Council too. Come here, Tom. You're a man of my own kidney. - Look after my little son. - I will. - We've had some good fun together - Great fun. - We did some good work, too. - We made the narrow seas English. Keep them so. - You'll need ships. - I'll get them. Tom. Don't be too much of a hero. Ned's a jealous fool. Watch the French, but watch Ned first. I'll watch him. The sheep. Just a lot of sheep staring at me. Mary, big crazy sheep. My little son a frightened sheep. You, how did you get in here? Come closer. I want to see you. - Who are you? - The black sheep. Come closer. - Anne Boleyn's brat. - Your daughter! I remember. You saw the French coming. - What will you do when they return - England has never been invaded! - Not by the Normans? - They're us, so they couldn't have Did you all hear what she said? Tom, did you hear what she said? I wish she were a boy. Watch her grow up, Tom. You keep an eye on her. Ned, wait and see. She'll make you jump. I wish I were there to see the fun. - Pray to release me from purgatory - You have abolished purgatory. Don't argue, Ned. - Ashley, what are you doing? - Last time I left half our things - They'll drag us out of our beds. - The Queen will protect us. And who's to protect the Queen when she's queen no longer? Where did I put your warm bodice? It's always so freezing in Hatfiel Hatfield? Back to Hatfield? If I did, I'd never see him again. Princess Elizabeth. Get back to Mrs. Ashley. - I must talk to you. - In my room? In your bedgown? You'll lose your head. Do you know what it would mean if they saw you - They'd say I seduced a princess. - They say I'll be sent to Hatfiel Away from everyone I love. The Queen and ... They would! They shan't touch you and they won't send you to Hatfiel I'll find a place for you to live with the Queen. And I'll come to see you. Often. - My lord. - It's bound to be my page. Don't be afraid. Barney's a good boy. Forget you saw the Princess. - I'm talking to you. - I have a message from Seymour. - He wants you at the Council. - He's not losing any time. The coast is clear. You can run along now. - Was the King lonely all his life - Yes. I'd rather die than be lonely all my life. You'll not be lonely, Bess. And remember, no fear any longer. - Don't forget to come and see me. - We have an appointment. The Lady Elizabeth. Your pardon, madam. Bess, is that you? Edward. Where have you been? I've been sitting here all alone. I was left all by myself in the dark. I was afraid. Why? My father is dead. Yes, Edward. And now they want me to be king. And I'm frightened. Can't we run away and hide somewhere? - We can't. You have a duty. - But I'm afraid. You're our father's son. Be proud and strong as he was. Here he is. I found him. The King is dead. Long live the King. Long live the King. Long live the King. - Long live King Edward VI. - We pledge allegiance. - Long live the King. - Long may you reign. Make way for the Lord Protector! I can announce that the Council has appointed me Lord Protector. My wife, Lady Ann, and I were entrusted with the great honor - - of becoming Your Majesty's guardians. That's not what my father said. Bess, you heard what my father said - Uncle Tom was to take care of me - The King, my brother, is right. The Council, after careful deliberation, has ruled otherwise. You were coming from the east wing so you came from the Admiral's room - It's the simplest logic. - No! Your syllogism ... - Don't speak so I can't understand - It's difficult to avoid. - Ned, don't let her insult me. - You have insufficient evidence. - It's her character! - Do you know my character? I knew your mother. Like mother like daughter. And we know what she was - Ann ... - Stand aside. I can handle this. - Madam, I'm warning you. - Who are you to warn me? - My mother's daughter. - And following in her footsteps. Spending the night with any handsome man. That was Anne Boleyn Excellent. Maturity is the secret in wine as in women. - I thought you liked them young. - No. Young wine goes to the head. - What are you two talking about? - Bess. She'll end like her mother No, Ann. Youth will have its fling A fling is the word. That's quite signature. Something regal about it A little too regal. That's why we sent her to Hatfield - Sorry to separate you from her. - Would I find love in the nursery Yes, when the nursery holds a possible future queen of England! Ann's warning you against letting ambition lead you into danger. - But I love danger. - You also love your life. Don't amuse yourself with royalty. It will be taken as a bid for power You intercepted Lady Elizabeth and sent the Queen there, too. - The Council will be disturbed. - The Council is you! You're Lord Protector against the King's wish. He didn't want you to have all the power. Neither does the country. - Neither do I. - What's your aim? My office? No, not yet. Not now. - What makes you hesitate? - I don't know, Ned. Perhaps the memory of Mother, who feared we'd end like Cain and Abel - Or the desire to be happy. - With whom? Elizabeth? - That's my private business. - Is it? - Is it your private business? - Yes! In 47 B.C., Caesar went east where he came, saw, and conquered. Mr. Mums, aren't you leaving out an important date? The year when he fell in love with Cleopatra. That's always interested me. I've often wondered ... What was the fascination she held for one so much older than herself Was it her youth or intelligence? It's important to know, Mr. Mums. - We're to discuss his conquests. - Yes! His conquest of her. Of course she fell in love, but how was a girl her age able to hold him? - I couldn't tell you. - I know. She showed him that she shared his interests. They talked about strategy and about ships! Ships again! Ever since we came here, it's been nothing but ships and admirals. Why not? What is more interesting than the fleet? We are a seafaring people with the best admirals in the world. - To name only one ... - Tom Seymour. A man of great ability and daring, but where are the ships he needs? - This is a lesson in history. - But ships made our history. How many ships have we today for the defense of England? 25! Shall the Spanish plunder the world - - while Tom Seymour sits idly for lack of ships? Drink this. You'll feel better. An you've had enough lessons for today - You'll make a corpse of Mr. Mums - Thank you, Mrs. Ashley. I shall be grateful for a rest. It's hard to match her energy at my age Poor Mums. He'll never understand my interest in all these things. If he has a brain, he'll understand And he may tell the Court that you want to be an admiral's wife. - Am I wrong? - No. No, you are not wrong. I love him. I love him dearly. I shall love him until I die. Bess, my darling! He's a fine man! My father picked him out for a magnificent future. Had he lived, he might have picked him out for me. Because we match! - But you're so young. - I can still share his thoughts. One day he might sail my ships with my flag. - With my love. - In his eyes, you're only a child His eyes say different things to me And so do his letters. He writes me every week. He'll come to see me as soon as he can. - There's something you should know - What? - He's in love with another woman. - That's not true. I should have warned you long ago. But the secret is not my secret. What secret? Speak up. What have you heard? You're an old eavesdropper, listening at key holes. There is no secret. If there was another woman, you could name her. - There is no other woman. - My poor child. Go, Ashley. Go! Catherine. Bess, darling. I'm sorry you had to find out this way. They were secretly engaged when the King decided to marry her The Protector would rather kill him than let him marry a royal. That's why they have to meet at night. Sweetheart. It's all right, Ashley. Go back to bed. Barnaby, did I see someone with the King? Yes, Your Grace. Princess Elizabeth The Princess Elizabeth, here at Whitehall? Where are they? - On the lawn. Playing shuttlecock - How long have they been together Edward! Edward! Edward! Bess. Edward. - Edward. - Silence. Horse-leech. Wood louse. Beetle-face. Herring guts. What is it you want to tell me? - If I'm caught they'll beat Barney - But he is Tom's page. - He gave him to me for Christmas. - Do they whip him for what you do? It's a great honor to be the King's whipping boy. - Well? You asked for an audience. - With the King. Not a baby. But they treat me like a prisoner. They don't even give me enough pocket money to bribe my servants. They don't allow me to see him, but he puts coins under the carpet He's a wonderful man. Don't you think so, Bess? - Don't you like my Uncle Tom? - What difference does it make? If you want to see him or Catherine you should be allowed to see them. - You might have plans for them. - Plans? You might want them to get married Perhaps you think they'd like it. - Perhaps they would. - Then say so. Your wish is the law - Who's to argue with the King? - Who's to argue with me? Did I say it was my wish they should get married? Yes! I think I did. - Isn't it a brilliant idea? - Who am I to judge your ideas? See that the country knows you're the master. They're your subjects. They have to obey. Let it be today. It's torture Bess, what's the matter? You're crying. What are you crying about? - I don't know. - You're crying about me. You don't have to feel sorry for me Don't pity me. Stop it, Bess! I can't abide weeping women. Bess, you'll see what happens. I'm the King! By the devil's teeth, where are my servants? I want pens and parchment I want to write a letter to a friend of mine. "We have Your Highness's contentment at heart and, after consideration, - it is our royal wish and desire that you marry our Uncle Tom." "We expect you to do it forthwith, showing yourself as a good subject "We chose our Uncle Tom because he will not be troublesome to you. - Oh, Tom! - Not troublesome to you! Rascal! Perhaps we laugh too soon. The boy has no power. Ned won't allow it. He must if the letter's made public I'll read it at the reception. "We persuaded Bess of the excellence of the idea - - as soon as it matured in our mind." - Is this perhaps your doing? - No! - No, it isn't. - Barnaby told me you were there. Bess, my sweet Bess. You talked the King over. You did it for me. I told you I had nothing ... nothing to do with it. Bess. Bess. My dear, what's wrong? Madam, I ... I shall leave the day before the wedding. Now I understand. Oh, my darling. You thought you'd have to leave. That's wrong. This is your home! You belong to us. I love you, Bess. And Tom loves you too. You know that, don't you? - Yes, madam. - Then you'll stay? Yes, madam. Today my Uncle Tom wed Catherine Parr. It almost killed Uncle Ned. But it was my wish, and I am the King! More power to Uncle Tom. I'll give him ships to fight the pirates. I am the King. Uncle Tom has defeated the pirates It almost killed my Uncle Ned. Hoorah! - They cheer him like a savior. - A man can work for his people. But the crowd still runs after a handsome face. - Just listen to those women. - The man's insatiable. - He has two wives already! - What ridiculous nonsense you talk! - If only you'd listen to me. - I do, too much. - That's why I sent Tom on the trip - The Lord High Admiral. Welcome home, and thanks in the name of the Council for a splendid job. - I'm glad you liked what I did. - Not all of it, Tom. It seems that after the battle, you had a good time with the pirates. We cracked some bottles and played cards. They're great captains. - And robbers! - Yes, they do forget their manner They want me to do it again. Keep the sea lanes open. This is great. Just give me ten times as many ships. - And the crowd will cheer you. - And sweep you to the throne. Fascinating idea. - We'll all go to sea with you, Tom - Afraid, Ann? I wonder why? Had you hoped I returned defeated, or, better still, not at all? Was that the idea of sending me out with only five decrepit ships? - Make way for the King. - But, Your Majesty ... - I have to see my Uncle Tom. - I told you the King was not ... Your Majesty. The admiral of your fleet reports with great pride. The campaign you wished has been taken to a successful conclusion. - We are very pleased. - Your ship was in the lead. - A shining example to the rest. - We are very pleased. We thank you - Little rascal! How have you been - Nothing under the carpet! - There will be! - Put His Majesty down, Tom. Your Majesty, your people want you Tom! Cathy! - It's so good to have you home. - Oh, Cathy. Why aren't you down to greet him? What will they think of you? - They'll be happy to be alone. - Aren't you behaving strangely? - He'll think you don't care. - Leave me alone, Ashley. Bess! Well, what's this? Triumphal arches everywhere, but Bess is in her room I thought you'd like a few moments alone with Catherine. I see. Tact. - Grown up, is that it? - Yes, milord. - Isn't it all rather nonsense? - No, milord. Yes, milord. No, milord. Welcome home, Tom. - Why don't you ride with them? - I should only spoil their fun. Besides, they're going to try the new sails, and I'm not a sailor. You're troubled, Ashley. What is it? I'm not sure he realizes that she's no longer a child. It has always delighted me to see them together, Ashley. What do you think of it? It's as good as new. - Better! - Why? You've made improvements. The mizzenmast is rigged to make her easier on the helm. - Where did you pick that up? - I read and I watch. - I like everything about the sea. - That includes me. - You most of all. - Bless you for that, Bess. - What can't we do with 100 ships! - We? You and I and England. Cathy. We're home. I'll tell her what a great sailor you are. You belong there! We'll sail again, together. Unless ... Unless the Lord Protector has his way. How would you like to go to Denmark or Sweden to be married there? - You're not serious. - My brother wants to marry you off To the Danish or the Swedish prince Doesn't he know I'd never dream of leaving ..? I belong to England. He knows that one day this country may belong to you. - That's why he wants you gone. - The King is still young. He's not strong. He won't grow old And your sister Mary's a fool. She's not like you. If you were queen, would you let your admiral do great deeds? I'd give him opportunities he never dared dream about. I'd send him around the globe like the Portuguese do. Send him to the New World to let the Spanish know we're the masters - But we're a small country. - That can be remedied, Tom. - It can be remedied. - It's exciting to hear you talk. I find myself believing in what you say. - I envy your admiral. - But that will be you, Tom. - You! - My dear Bess. Who knows what I'll be when you set out to beat the Spaniards? You'll be with me, Tom. Always! Always! Well, nobody's home. We're back. We're hungry. Cathy. Don't move, sweetheart. Beautiful! I wish that Italian Leonardo was alive. He could have painted you. Tom! - Have you been far? - Everywhere. We circled the globe Conquered the world. It was wonderful! You behave as if we haven't seen each other for weeks. Tom, put me down, please. Thank you, milords. Tom! - What's that? - Princess Elizabeth. - Here? To do what? - Meet the Danish envoy. Don't you think he should see her before he recommends the marriage? - You know she won't leave England - Yet she wrote me a letter. Most surprising in it's graceful attitude. "Whatever your choice may be, I'll bow to the wisdom of the Council." "No one is more eager than I to do what is best for the country Does the letter disturb you? Strange she never told you of her plans. - Your sister is pretty tonight. - Is she? - And very foolish. - Yes! - You're not in favor of this? - No. - Your sister appears to be. - Yes, but all girls are silly. And if she doesn't take the Dane, she'll have to take a German. Uncle Ned loves the Germans. I wish he'd die. What? - What was that? - I wish he'd die ... D-Y-E. - It's the wrong spelling. - What are you talking about? Spelling. Nobody knows for certain how to spell the King's English. - As long as it's the right word. - It was exactly the right word. Edward. Would you ask the orchestra to play the Danske Dans? What does she want? Danske Dans! Princess. - Thank you, Barnaby. - Your Highness. Do the Danes really put meat under their saddles until it's tender? That's the Hungarians. Uncle Tom, you promised. - In here, Your Highness. - What is it? The Admiral asks you to wait for him here. He wishes to speak with you. - What about, I wonder? - He didn't say, but ... But what? What were you going to say? I heard him tell the Lord Protector that he wishes to speak with you . ... about this Danish marriage. Really? Poor Tom. Spending the night talking to Ned Seymour instead of dancing. I danced with almost everyone. I haven't stopped for hours. - Even though my shoe pinched me. - Let me do that. It's been a glorious night, hasn't it? Something to talk about - On a long, Danish winter night. - Don't leave us for Denmark. That's not for you. You're so exquisite. I've said too much. I must go. The Admiral will soon be here. Don't go, Barnaby. You don't want to leave me. Never again, as long as I live. Do you want to kiss me? He saw us. The Danish gentleman. I want no one to suffer. I didn't see his face. Let us assume that our project was a mistake. - We thank you for your forbearance - Good night. - Where's that girl? - Tom took her home. He's in a rage Look! That lighted window in Lambeth Palace. The bishop is working night and day on that new religion. Isn't that exciting? A new religion Perhaps a new way of life. - A new England. - Who was the man? - What man? - The man you kissed. - There was no man. - Boy, then. Yes, of course. Barnaby Fitzpatrick! Was it Barnaby? - Answer me. - Yes. Don't tell me you love him. You must be proud of your night's work. Outrageous performance. - Then let's forget it. - You have sent him to the block! Not him. Too young and unimportant Had it been someone like you ... That would have pleased you. Doing like your mother. Is that what you want, to drive everyone mad who loves you? Is it? Tom, what are you saying? It couldn't be ... - No, that would be beyond belief. - What would? That you're jealous. Tom Seymour, the great Lord Admiral, jealous. Stop it. Stop that, I said. - But it's so funny ... - I said stop it! Stop it! Bess! - Forgive me. I was beside myself. - You couldn't help it. You either had to kiss me or ... And I think it was better that you slapped me. - Is that what you wanted? - I love you, Tom. I always have. It should never have happened, but I can't stop loving you. I couldn't bear it anymore. I want to hurt you. I was desperate. I love you, Tom. Bess. - Yes, Catherine? - Come here, child. How lovely you look, this morning. Come and sit with me. - I'm disturbing you. - I've finished. Tom has gone to London for two or three days. We're alone together That will give us time to talk things over. We've had a wonderful life together you and I and Tom. Last night when Tom came home, I knew something had happened. We talked all through the night. Your name was never mentioned. And yet I knew. You see, I love Tom and he loves me very dearly. I can't afford to lose him. I'm not like you ... strong and independent You have your whole life before you One day you may be Queen of England But I need Tom. He cannot mean all that to you. He means my whole life to me. Come here. Sit close to me. Bess, you're so young. This may be no more than a passing infatuation If it is not so ... Then you will have to go away. Only you can know whether your love for Tom is deep enough - - to outweigh all the unhappiness of separation. I thank you for your kindness. You make me feel so ungrateful. Bess, Bess. I'm sorry, madam. I'll have to go. - Mr. Parry? - Yes, he's back. Mr. Parry, you saw the Lady Catherine? How is she? - No one may see her. - Where is the Admiral's letter? There is no letter. No letter? - Milord was distraught. - I know. That's why I sent you. She is ... She's in no danger, is she? - Mr. Parry! - The Lady Catherine is dying. Remember once, many months ago, you carried me in your arms like this? - I remember. - You'd been away with Bess. And I thought I'd lost you to her. But when you came home, you were very sweet to me. Your bed is ready now. Thank you, Lady Tyrwhitt. Tom. You don't want me to die because you want to marry Elizabeth, do you? Do you? - Would you mind leaving us? - Tom ... - Tell me. - Merciful heavens, Cathy! Have I ever wanted to hurt you? Have I ever wanted to leave you? Haven't we been happy together? Forgive me, Tom. I must be mad to say such things. Where's Bess? Tell her to come closer to the bed Bess is not here. But you were talking to her. That was Lady Tyrwhitt. Bess is in Hatfield. Remember? Hatfield? Oh, yes, now I remember. She said she had to go because she loved you. Tom. Yes, Cathy. You're not the first man to be in love with two women. We celebrate His Majesty's birthday in the spirit of brotherly love, - - which he so nobly embodies as a shining example to us, his servant Long live the King! The Earl and Countess of Courtnay. Happy birthday, Your Majesty. Sir Anthony and Lady Denny. My humble duty, Sire. Lord and Lady Mostang. Loyal greetings, Your Majesty. Lord and Lady Clinton. - Look who's here. Elizabeth! - Yes. How pale she looks. Grief! She hasn't seen Tom for almost a year since Catherine died - Letters? - Just one before he sailed. Her Highness, Princess Elizabeth. May God grant that you rule Englan for years in peace and wisdom. We thank you, dear sister, for you loyalty and loving kindness. I'm playing shuttlecock with Mary Throckmorton now. - You've changed. Are you sick? - I must see you. Please! What can I tell you? His ships have been sighted. He'll be home soon. - He's well. He isn't wounded. - That's all I wanted to hear. - Thank you, Edward. - I think you like my Uncle Tom. - I hope they won't arrest him. - But he won another victory. Yes, and he wasn't meant to. Besides, he's coming back to you. - Edward, what are you saying? - That's what he said in his letter - What letter? - The one he sent by courier. - I never got it. - Of course not. Uncle Ned got it. Edward, what's in this letter? I've got to know. - It was a nice letter. I liked it - But what did it say? You're to wait for him. When he's back, you won't be lonely anymore. Are you lonely, Bess? I think you are. My Uncle Tom loves you, and that's why Uncle Ned wants to kill him. Kill him? Edward! - Who are you? - Your new steward. Appointed by the Lord Protector to take Mr. Parry's place. Mr. Parry and Mrs. Ashley were taken to London for questioning. Lady Tyrwhitt now has the honor of being your governess. I'm glad you're home. We didn't know you'd be delayed in London. My Lady Elizabeth? My Lord! My Lord? Is that all you have to say? - You've come. - Did you ever doubt it? Tears? That's not like you. That's not like my young Bess. I'll remember 1,000 things I should have said. And it'll be too late. But why? You risked your life coming here. Ned isn't giving me much time. My life isn't worth anything if I don't risk it. We'll put up a fight But when shall I see you again? Not for some time. - Perhaps never. - Never? What sort of word is that? You only came to say goodbye. I couldn't leave without your Godspeed. - Bess! - I love you and I'm frightened. Ned will kill you if he can. Do you remember when we sailed? We planned to sail the seven seas. Explore the four corners of the Earth, find new countries. Remember - I shall remember while I live. - I felt the future belongs to us. - So did I. - So it does! So it will! It's time. Godspeed, Tom. Godspeed! Milady Elizabeth. We came in the name of the King to tell you that Admiral Tom Seymour - has been arrested and taken to the Tower. I don't believe you. You wouldn't dare touch the Admiral Read this. The people will set him free. You admit he tried to arouse the people against us. Did you help him? - For years you've conspired ... - Take care. You're not very wise! - Remember I'm second to the throne - You've thought of that, have you? - You, too, want the throne. - That will cost you your head. It is your head that is in question It's my duty to protect this realm - against you and my brother. He finally influenced you to marry him He hoped to overthrow the Council. Many witnesses have, under pressure testified to the shameless affair. - Even Catherine accused you of it - You're lying. She loved me. - She was my friend. - But you were not her's. Have you anything to say? Whatever you say will be set down word for word and weighed. Perhaps in your own favor. - I'll testify. - Write. Yes, write! I accuse the Lord Protector - - of trying to convict a man of things he has never done. He is plotting the basest crime of all. The murder of his brother. Write that in his envy and fear, - - and most ignoble envy of Tom Seymour, he would like to kill him - Because the people love him. - Your violence betrays your guilt Write that the Lord Protector stands accused before the people - - whom he plans to betray. If he knew the nature of the English, he'd tremble. If he tries to kill his own brother like Cain, he'll be driven out. He'll find it in the Bible, which translated so he may understand it Write that if he harms Tom Seymour he puts a noose about his own neck You think you have sovereign power Don't forget you're in danger. Remember that here you are only a subject, as your mother was. But she took three lovers with her to the block. I shall ask the King to send forth a proclamation - - stating that all your charges are lies and slander. I shall demand this proclamation to be read by everyone in this country Five o'clock and all's well. Well, jailor, where's that sunshine you promised me? Barnaby! A friendly face. You don't know what this means to me. Bless you. - Have you seen her? Is she ill? - They never left her alone. Night and day they questioned her. They say that ... She turned on them again and again She was their judge. Her father said, "Watch her grow up She'll be a match for you." "I wish I could be there to see the fun." And he was right. There will be fun in England soon. I want to be there when it happens I see. I can't quite believe it. I've always been lucky. Lucky with things and lucky with people. It's hard to believe that this could be the end. "To the Lieutenant of the Tower of London." "Tower of London ..." "We, Edward, by the grace of God.. "Grace of God ..." "Do hereby command you ..." "Do hereby command you." Goodbye, my boy. Tell her from me ... Tell her ... Well, never mind. I think she knows. Now we're alone. Yes. You have to go to bed now. Why didn't they let you come before Why didn't they let you see me? I liked my Uncle Tom. Princess Elizabeth. She never mentions his name. That's how I know that in her heart, - - he's still alive. Look, it's another day. She'll be Queen of England. That's why I put on this dress. I wore it when the little King died But for Ned Seymour's execution, - - I trimmed it with this gold lace It's beautiful. Here we go up, up, up Up to the sky so high - Your Majesty. - Your Majesty.
