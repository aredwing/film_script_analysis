 

                        FEUER... EINS! HERE, GENTLEMEN, IS WHERE THE ADELIA WAS ATTACKED AND SUNK. YOU SEE, SHE WAS WELL INTO THE DANGER ZONE. OUR PROPOSED CONVOY SYSTEM IS SIMPLY THIS: BRITISH DESTROYERS WILL MEET YOUR TROOPSHIPS AT THIS DANGER ZONE AND CONVOY THEM TO THE FRENCH COAST. NEITHER THE SHIP AT SEA NOR THE BRITISH DESTROYERS WILL KNOW UNTIL THE LAST DAY WHEN AND WHERE TO MEET. EVERYTHING DEPENDS UPON THE SECRECY OF THIS RENDEZVOUS POSITION. IT WILL BE SEN BY WIRELESS IN CODE. BUT OUR CODES HAVE BEEN READ BEFORE. WELL, IT'S THE HOPE OF EVERY MILITARY CRYPTOGRAPHER TO INVENT AN UNBREAKABLE CODE. I'VE HAD 3 YEARS' EXPERIENCE ON THE EUROPEAN FRONT. ALL THAT EXPERIENCE HAS GONE INTO THE MAKING OF THE NEW CODE THAT I NOW OFFER YOU. WHAT IF WE SEND A MUNITIONS SHIP UNDER THIS NEW SYSTEM BEFORE WE SEND ANY TROOPS? WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO GAIN BY THAT? A TEST OF MAJOR BRENNAN'S CODE. IF THE MUNITIONS SHIP GETS THROUGH WITHOUT ATTACK, OUR TROOPSHIPS WILL FOLLOW. IT'S GREEK TO ME. LET'S HOPE IT'LL BE GREEK TO THE ENEMY. WAS IST DAS? THE NEW CODE. HMM. HELLO, YOUR EXCELLENCY. MR. GORDON! I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE... ANYWHERE BUT 6,000 MILES FROM HERE, HUH? MAKING TROUBLE FOR DIPLOMATS WHO WANT TO KEEP SECRETS. EXACTLY. WHEN I WAS IN TOKYO, YOU GAVE ME MANY A SLEEPLESS NIGHT. WHAT NOW? HAS YOUR PAPER TRANSFERRED YOU TO WASHINGTON? OH, I'M NO LONGER A NEWSPAPERMAN, YOUR EXCELLENCY. WELL! THAT'LL BE GOOD NEWS IN MANY A CAPITAL. ESPECIALLY BERLIN, SIR, SINCE BY WAY OF ENCOURAGING THE ENEMY, I'VE JUST BEEN COMMISSIONED A LIEUTENAN IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY. AH. NOW YOU MAKE ME FEEL TRULY SORRY FOR THE GERMANS. YOU'LL FIND OUT WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO BEFORE THEY KNOW IT THEMSELVES. OH, I'M AFRAID YOUR IMAGINATION'S RUNNING RIOT A LITTLE- YOUR FIRST FAILURE AS A PROPHET. OH, YOUR EXCELLENCY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE WE ARE. PAPA GREGORY? HMM? JOEL, MY DEAR! HELLO, DARLING. I WANT YOU TO DO A FAVOR FOR ME. HMM? OH, SO I WAS A BRIBE. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, PARADE WITH YOUR SUFFRAGETTES? OH, YOU DON' LIKE THAT, DO YOU? I DO NOT. YOU RULE YOUR MEN COMPLETELY, AND YET YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED. YOU WANT I IN THE LAW BOOKS. NOW, DON'T YOU WORRY. ALL I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO POINT OUT BORIS STRONSKOFF FOR ME. BORIS STRONSKOFF? HE WAS STANDING RIGHT OVER- OH, THERE HE IS NOW WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS US. I HAVE A BRILLIANT IDEA FOR MY RUSSIAN BAZAAR NEXT WEEK. I'M GOING TO ASK HIM TO SING FOR US. I BEG YOUR PARDON, MONSIEUR STRONSKOFF. OH, MONSIEUR STRONSKOFF, YOU DON'T KNOW ME. I'M JOEL CARTER. AH. I CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE ONLY USED TO THE FRENCH. IN RUSSIA, WE HOLD THE HAND MUCH LONGER. YES. YES, OF COURSE, BUT I- I JUST WANTED TO ASK IF YOU'D SING FOR US NEXT WEEK, MONSIEUR. IT'S FOR CHARITY, YOU KNOW. YOU SAID SING? JUST A FEW SELECTIONS, OF COURSE. IT'S FOR THE RUSSO-AMERICAN RELIEF COMMITTEE. AHA. WHY DO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN PURSUE ME? WH- OF COURSE, I DO NOT BLAME YOU. YOUR MEN HERE, THEY ARE SO WEAK. THEY ARE NOTHING. I- I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND, MONSIEUR. IT'S JUST THAT I WANTED YOU TO GATHER TOGE- AH, YES, I UNDERSTAND. THESE MEN HERE, THEY... UH, THEY BORE YOU. BUT THIS WEEK, I HAVE NO TIME FOR YOU AT ALL. MY TIME IS, UH, OCCUPIED. BUT NEXT WEEK... OH, EXCUSE ME, PLEASE. PAPA GREGORY? HMM? HE'S GONE CRAZY. WHO'S GONE CRAZY? BORIS STRONSKOFF. I TALKED TO HIM JUST NOW, AND HE DIDN'T MAKE A WORD OF SENSE. YOU TALKED TO HIM? YES. HA HA! ALLOW ME. MISS CARTER, THIS IS BORIS STRONSKOFF. MADAME. HOW DO YOU DO? THEN WHO IS THAT MAN? LOOK. HO HO HO! IS THAT THE MAN YOU TALKED TO? YES. I ASKED HIM TO SING FOR ME. SING? THAT'S WILLIAM GORDON. HE WAS HEAD OF THE A.P. BUREAU IN THE FAR EAST. JUST COME HOME TO JOIN THE ARMY. HE BELONGS IN FRONT OF A DRUGSTORE IN THE MIDDLE WEST. OH, NO. HE'S NO AS BAD AS THAT. STILL, HE DID MAKE A RATHER STRANGE REMARK TO ME A MOMENT AGO. ME, TOO.

WASHINGTON, D.C., CALLING SAN DIEGO 2163W. DR. JACKSON? YES, THIS IS DR. JACKSON. HOW ARE YOU, MY DEAR FRIEND? HOW'S THE STOCK MARKET? THE MARKET IS QUITE DEPENDABLE, I THINK, ESPECIALLY IN MUNITIONS STOCKS. MY AGENT, THEREFORE, ADVISED ME TO SELL YOUR WESTERN CHEMICALS AND TO BUY NORTH AMERICAN, I RECOMMEND YOU LE THIS DEAL GO THROUGH. AND DO NOT CHANGE, AS YOUR PROFITS LATER ON WILL BE MUCH GREATER. THANKS A LOT. I KNOW YOU'LL MAKE SOME REAL MONEY FOR ME. WHEN WILL YOU PHONE THE NEXT MARKET NEWS? TOMORROW AT 3:00. THAT'S NOON YOUR TIME. VERY GOOD, MY FRIEND. GOOD-BYE, AND THANK YOU. S.S. DEPENDABLE. MUNITIONS. LONGITUDE LATITUDE TOMORROW AT NOON. BUT HE SAYS TO LET IT GO THROUGH- LET IT GO THROUGH BECAUSE PROFIT LATER ON WILL BE MUCH GREATER. LET IT GO THROUGH? A SHIP FULL OF AMMUNITION TO BE USED AGAINST OUR TROOPS? BRING ME THE MEDICINE. NIETERSTEIN IS MY SUPERIOR, SIR, BUT I THINK HE'S INSANE, IF I MAY BE PERMITTED TO SAY. BUT YOU'RE NO PERMITTED TO SAY. AND NIETERSTEIN IS YOUR SUPERIOR BECAUSE HE HAS THE INSANITY YOU CHARGE HIM WITH. CAN'T YOU SEE IT'S A TRAP? WE LET THIS SHIP THROUGH, THEY THINK THEY'RE SAFE, AND WHEN THE FIRS TROOPSHIP IS AT SEA, WHAT A ROMAN HOLIDAY FOR THE FISH. BUENOS DIAS, SENOR. EMERGENCY CASE. PASE USTED, DOCTOR. GRACIAS, SENOR. HOW'S YOUR HUSBAND? HE IS RESTING, DOCTOR. I WON'T DISTURB HIM. I'LL BE BACK LATER. HERE. GIVE HIM THIS MEDICINE. GRACIAS, DOCTOR. GRACIAS. VAMANOS. ACHTUNG! THANKS TO YOU, MAJOR BRENNAN, AND YOUR CODE, OUR TEST SHIP GOT THROUGH. I WAS SURE IT WOULD, SIR. WE'LL USE THE SAME PROTECTIVE MEASURES TO GET OUR TROOPSHIPS THROUGH. A MILLION OF OUR MEN MUST BE IN THE FIELD WITHIN 6 MONTHS. ISN'T IT AWFUL WHEN THEY GROW UP AND YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE BIRDS AND THE FLOWERS AND THE BEES? HA HA! ANY, UH, GRANDCHILDREN? YOU AIN'T GO NO PERMIT TO PARADE. CLEAR THE STREET. COME ON! GIVE ME MY SIGN! GIVE ME THAT BANNER! LET ME ALONE! DON'T HURT ME! HEY, BUDDY, WAIT A MINUTE. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. LISTEN. I'M IN- YOU'RE RESISTING AN OFFICER, NOW. OFFICER? WHAT? OHH! WHY-WELL, THE MAN'S A MARVEL. WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? HOW AM I DOING? WELL, LOOK. THAT'S A-FINE. NOBODY SHE'S A-KNOW YOUR HUSBAND, HE WALLOP YOU NOW. WELL, THIS IS AS FAR AS YOU GO. AH, COME ON. CHANGE YOUR MIND. I KNOW A PLACE WHERE THEY'VE GO THE MOST AWE-INSPIRING HAMBURGERS- OH, NO. REALLY, I CAN'T. THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I'VE BROKEN THIS DATE. NOW I'VE REALLY GOT TO GO THROUGH WITH IT. SEE? SEE, THERE IT IS IN THAT UNIFORM. WHERE? LET ME HAVE A LOOK AT IT. THAT'S A CINCH. I CAN FIX THAT. OH, NO, YOU DON'T. BUT ALL I'VE GOT TO DO IS EXPLAIN TO HIM- NO. I AM LUNCHING WITH HIM. I BET YOU HAVE TO PAY THE CHECK. NOW, THESE HAMBURGERS ARE THE MOST AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL, BIG- SORRY. GOOD-BYE. YOU WON'T CHANGE YOUR MIND? UH-UH. WELL, THANKS FOR THE BLACK EYE. SAME TO YOU. I NEVER GOT A SHINER IN NICER COMPANY. THE PLEASURE WAS MUTUAL. I BET I NEVER GET A CHANCE TO SOCK ANOTHER EYE LIKE YOURS. THERE ISN'T ONE LEF IN THE WORLD. DO YOU REALLY THINK SO? NOW, TODAY WE HAVE WITH US MISS BARBIE BURNS OF BROADWAY, WHO WILL PERSONALLY KISS EVERY LUCKY FELLA THAT ENLISTS. NOW, THAT'S PRETTY HIGH PAY FOR JUST DOING YOUR DUTY, AIN'T IT? COME ON UP, FELLAS.

WHAT? MY TRAIN DOESN'T LEAVE UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING. WHY, YOU TOLD ME THIS WAS YOUR LAST DAY. WHY, YOU'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF ME. YES. WELL! I MUST SAY YOU DO THINGS WELL, LIEUTENANT- LUNCHEON, TEA, DINNER... NOW, WHAT MORE COULD A GIRL ASK? I'M WHAT'S KNOWN AS A GOOD PROVIDER. HA HA HA! HA HA HA! WELL, THIS IS WHERE I LIVE. I'M HOME NOW. ALREADY? NOW, WE'VE BEEN WALKING FOR HOURS. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. LET'S WALK JUST ONCE AROUND THE WORLD. WHAT DO YOU SAY? WE'LL END UP HERE JUST THE SAME. I'M AFRAID YOU MIGH MISS YOUR TRAIN. I WISH THAT TRAIN DIDN'T LEAVE TILL THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. WHY DON'T-WHY COULDN'T YOU GE A DESK JOB HERE IN WASHINGTON? LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE DOING IT. OH, NOT FOR ME. THAT'S JUST THE TROUBLE. TROUBLE? YOU SEE, YEARS AGO OUT IN THE FAR EAST, WHEN NEWS WAS SCARCE, I ENTERTAINED MYSELF WRITING A BOOK. REALLY? OH, NOT THE KIND OF A BOOK YOU THINK. THIS WAS A BOOK ON CODES. IT WAS CALLED HOW TO ENCIPHER AND HOW TO DECIPHER HOW DO YOU LIKE THA FOR A TITLE? HA HA! A LOVE STORY, EH? HA HA HA! WELL, I DIDN'T WAN TO LET THE BOSS KNOW THAT I WAS WASTING MY TIME ON CODES SO I HAD THE BOOK PUBLISHED UNDER A NOM DE PLUME- ANSON MERIDAN. THAT'S ME. HA HA HA! WELL? WELL, THE GOVERNMENT- THE WAR DEPARTMENT'S BEEN RAISING HEAVEN AND EARTH TRYING TO FIND ME, THAT'S ALL. OH. YOU MEAN IF THEY DID FIND YOU, THEY'D KEEP YOU IN WASHINGTON, EH? THEY WOULD, BUT THEY WON'T, BECAUSE I'M GOING TO DO MY FIGHTING AT THE FRONT, NOT BEHIND A DESK. OH, I DON'T BLAME YOU AT ALL. I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU. YOU DO? UH-HUH. HA HA HA! YOU KNOW, UH, I'VE CHANGED MY MIND AGAIN. I WISH THAT TRAIN DIDN' LEAVE FOR TWO DAYS. TWO DAYS... LIKE THIS ONE? EXACTLY LIKE THIS, ONLY... ONLY WHAT? I WONDER IF THERE REALLY IS A WAR GOING ON OVER THERE? OH, BILL, DON'T GO. MY DARLING... HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE I EVER HAPPENED TO CALL YOU THAT? DO CALL ME THAT, PLEASE. SAY IT AGAIN. DARLING. MMM. HOW'S THAT? OH. OH, BILL. LIEUTENANT GORDON? YES? MAJOR SLOAN'S COMPLIMENTS, SIR. THE MAJOR INSTRUCTS THE LIEUTENAN THAT HE'S BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE WAR DEPARTMEN AND TO REPOR FOR DUTY AT 10:00. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THEY CAN'T DO THIS TO ME. I'M NOT GOING TO SIT BEHIND A DESK WITH A WAR GOING ON! I'M GOING TO FRANCE! SORRY, SIR. THE MAJOR'S ORDERS. WELL, WHAT THE- SAY, WHAT KIND OF A WAR IS THIS? ANYTHING WRONG, LIEUTENANT? WRONG? LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO, I, A FREE AND PATRIOTIC CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES, AM ON MY WAY TO FRANCE, WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M YANKED FROM THE TRAIN, THREATENED WITH ARREST, AND SUMMONED HERE FOR WHAT? TO FACE AN ENDLESS LINE OF DOORS MARKED "KEEP OUT." WHAT'S THIS COUNTRY COMING TO, ANYWAY? WILL YOU JOIN ME IN PROTES AGAINST THE INEFFICIENT, INCOMPETENT BUREAUCRATIC ADMINISTRATION OF OUR SO-CALLED WAR DEPARTMENT? WHY, I'D BE DELIGHTED, LIEUTENANT, UH... GORDON. LIEUTENANT GORDON. LATE OF THE 73rd, NOW A MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY. SUPPOSE WE MAKE OUR PROTEST NOW? ATTABOY! HEY, TOGETHER, YOU AND I WILL START A MOVEMENT THAT- WON'T YOU COME IN, LIEUTENANT? I'M ASSISTAN SECRETARY OF WAR. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, LIEUTENANT. WE ALWAYS LIKE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. AT LEAST, I DO. WILL YOU HAVE A CIGAR? YOU MIND IF I SMOKE? NOW FOR THE PROTES MOVEMENT. WHERE DO WE START? WELL... MR. SECRETARY, I ASK YOU... I'M ON MY WAY TO FRANCE. I BREAK A BEAUTIFUL GIRL'S HEART TO SAY GOOD-BYE. BANDS PLAYING, FLAGS WAVING, BAYONETS GLEAMING IN THE SUN, AND WHAT HAPPENS? I'M DRAGGED HERE AND LOADED DOWN WITH PENS, PENCILS, ERASERS, EYESHADES, PAPER CLIPS. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT, EH? NO, SIR. IT CERTAINLY IS A PUZZLE TO ME. WELL, LET'S TAKE A HYPOTHETICAL CASE. SUPPOSE YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF THIS OFFICE AND YOU'D BEEN HUNTING HIGH AND LOW FOR MONTHS FOR A CODE EXPERT, A FELLOW WITH THE NOM DE PLUME OF ANSON MEREDITH, A FELLOW YOU THOUGH YOU REALLY NEEDED. AM I BORING YOU? THEN SUPPOSE YOU FOUND OUT THA HE'D BEEN COMMISSIONED UNDER HIS REAL NAME IN THE ARMY, SOME OTHER BRANCH THAT DIDN' NEED HIM NEARLY AS MUCH AS YOU DID, AND THAT HE WAS LEAVING FOR AN EMBARCATION POINT THIS MORNING. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? EXACTLY. TAKE LIEUTENANT GORDON TO MAJOR BRENNAN. WOULD I BE COURT-MARTIALED, SIR, IF I ASKED WHO GOT ME INTO THIS? YOU HAVE YOUR ORDERS, LIEUTENANT. YES, SIR. SHALL I-SHALL I ANNOUNCE YOU NOW, MISS CARTER? CARTER... CARTER. SO YOU GOT ME INTO THIS, HUH? NOW, PLEASE. DON'T GET EXCITED. YOU CAN DO JUS AS MUCH GOOD OVER HERE AS YOU CAN OVER THERE. AND I THOUGH IT WOULD BE- YOU THOUGHT! WHO ASKED YOU TO THINK? WHAT BUSINESS IS THIS OF YOURS? WHAT'S ALL THIS NOISE? HONOR AND TRADITIONS OF A MAN'S FAMILY- NOTHING IS SACRED TO HER. WHAT WILL MY CHILDREN THINK OF A FATHER WHO FOUGHT FROM BEHIND A DESK? CHILDREN? CHILDREN? IT'S PURELY HYPOTHETICAL, UNCLE STEVIE. MY DEAR NIECE TO THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF WAR- LIEUTENANT GORDON, WILL YOU REPORT TO MAJOR BRENNAN OR MUST I ARRANGE A MILITARY ESCORT? I'LL GO, SIR. MAYBE THIS'LL TEACH ME A LESSON NOT TO LET MYSELF GE PICKED UP BY STRANGE WOMEN. THANK YOU. I WAS ORDERED TO REPOR TO MAJOR BRENNAN, SIR. OH, YES. COME IN. COME IN. I'M LIEUTENAN WILLIAM GORDON, SIR. OH, YES, LIEUTENANT GORDON. DELIGHTED TO KNOW YOU. I'VE ADMIRED YOUR BOOK FOR YEARS. THANK YOU. LET ME SEE, IT WAS CALLED... OH, ROBERTS... WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THAT GORDON BOOK? HOW TO ENCIPHER AND HOW TO DECIPHER, SIR. THANK YOU, ROBERTS. I NEVER CAN REMEMBER NAMES AND TITLES. ROBERTS HAS BEEN REMEMBERING THEM FOR ME FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS. YOU DID WRITE THAT BOOK, DIDN'T YOU? YES, SIR. IT SOLD 5 COPIES. I BOUGHT 3 OF THEM. WELL, YOU'RE VERY MODEST, LIEUTENANT. THE BOOK IS VERY WELL KNOWN AMONG STUDENTS OF CRYPTOGRAPHY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS? WIRELESS INTERCEPT. WELL, I SUPPOSE IT'S AN ENEMY WIRELESS MESSAGE THAT YOUR OPERATORS PICKED OUT OF THE AIR. EXACTLY. WE KNOW THEY ARE COMING FROM SOME POWERFUL SENDING STATION BELOW THE BORDER. AND WE SUSPECT THEY CONTAIN INFORMATION GATHERED IN THIS COUNTRY BY ENEMY ESPIONAGE AGENTS. NOW, THE MEXICAN GOVERNMEN TRIED TO LOCATE THE STATION FOR US BUT SO FAR, WITH NO SUCCESS. WE CAN'T READ THESE. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD? I THINK SO. BUT WILL YOU? NO, SIR. HMM? BECAUSE IT'S AN "I LOSE IF I WIN PROPOSITION." HA HA! I DON' UNDERSTAND YOU. IF I DECIPHER THEM, I'LL GET WHAT I DON'T WANT: A PERMANENT BERTH BEHIND A DESK. BUT THIS IS THE ARMY, MAN. YOU'VE GOT TO DO AS YOU'RE TOLD. I WAS BROUGHT HERE AGAINST MY WILL, SIR. BUT I CAN'T BE MADE TO THINK AGAINST MY WILL. YES, I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL. THANK YOU. LOOK, HERE. IF YOU SUCCEED IN MAKING ANYTHING OF THESE, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO ARRANGE FOR YOU TO HAVE A WACK AT THE ENEMY AT A LITTLE CLOSER RANGE. IS THAT A PROMISE, SIR? THAT'S ALL, LIEUTENANT. REPORT TO MR. GARDNER IN THE DECODING ROOM. YES, SIR. P-N- P-N- O- Q-R-R- O- Q-R-R- F- T-N-O. F- T-N-O. YES? YES, THIS IS GARDNER. WELL, TRY THE SECONDHAND BOOKSTORES. WE'VE GO TO HAVE COPIES OF ALL THEIR SHORTHAND SYSTEMS! I DON'T CARE! PAY ANYTHING! SAY, I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT- DON'T INTERRUPT. I TOLD YOU NEVER TO INTERRUPT. R- N-P... R- N-P... NEW INTERCEPT, SIR. O- T-O-T-L- O- T-O-T-L DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING ON THE TABLES! OH, YOU'RE THE NEW MAN. THERE'S A DESK OVER THERE. JUST SIT DOWN. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE. L- F-R-O-N-O-Z- L- F-R-O-N-O-Z- GOOD EVENING, LIEUTENANT. GOOD EVENING. I HOPE YOU LIKE YOUR DESK, LIEUTENANT. TABULATE THEM INTO LETTER GROUPS - TWO LETTERS. NOW, THIS IS A FREQUENCY CHART. SOUNDS VERY COMPLICATED, BUT IT REALLY ISN'T. ENABLES US TO FIND HOW OFTEN EACH LETTER APPEARS IN A MESSAGE. THIS IS A REGULAR PRINTED ALPHABET. NOW, WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO PUT A CHECK NEXT TO EACH LETTER EVERY TIME IT APPEARS IN THESE INTERCEPTS. IT'S THE FIRST STEP IN BREAKING THE CIPHER- EXACTLY WHA THOSE MEN ARE DOING. TAKE YOUR TIME. AND BE SURE YOU'RE ACCURATE. ACCURACY IS THE FIRS ESSENTIAL IN CIPHER READING. IT DIDN'T WORK, SIR. WELL, IT MAY WORK BY A MATHEMATICAL FORMULA. TABULATE THE NUMBER OF LETTERS BETWEEN ALL REPETITIONS. EITHER WE'LL FIND A COMMON FACTOR OR WE'LL GO CRAZY. PERSONALLY, I THINK WE'LL GO CRAZY. OH! DOES EVERYBODY AROUND HERE GET LIKE THAT? WE DO DURING THESE TIMES. WHEN THE ENEMY HAS SOMETHING ON THE FIRE, THEY FILL THE AIR WITH PHONY MESSAGES TO COVER UP THE REAL ONES. SO, THEN WE KNOW THA SOMETHING HOT IS HAPPENING, BUT WE DON' KNOW WHAT. SO, THE ARMY HECKLES THE INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT. THE INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT HECKLES US. WE HAVEN'T GO ANYBODY TO HECKLE. SO, WE HECKLE OURSELVES. YOU MIND TELLING ME HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN HECKLING YOURSELF HERE. IT TAKES 3 MONTHS TO GE ON TO THE FUNDAMENTALS. I CUT MY EYETEETH ON FUNDAMENTALS. THAT INTERCEPT CAME FROM BELOW THE BORDER. WE CAN PRESUME IT'S EITHER IN IT OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE "E" IS THE MOS AND YOU'VE GO NO Es THERE. IT CAN'T BE GERMAN BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A FLOCK OF Qs THERE AND THERE ARE NO Qs IN GERMAN. IT CAN'T BE SPANISH BECAUSE IN SPANISH "Q" IS ALWAYS FOLLOWED BY "U" AND YOU'VE GO NO Us THERE. WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS? GORDON. MAJOR BRENNAN SENT ME. WHY DIDN' YOU SAY SO? GLAD TO HAVE YOU. WE CAN USE YOU. I HOPE YOU'VE GO A GOOD CONSTITUTION. WHY? YOU'LL NEED IT. HAVE A CHAIR. SIT DOWN, LIEUTENANT GORDON. SIT DOWN. NO, THANK YOU. I'VE GOT A DATE IN FRANCE. I'M IN A HURRY TO KEEP IT. CAN I BORROW THAT? GARDNER, HAVEN' YOU HAD ENOUGH? GO HOME AND GET SOME SLEEP. LET LIEUTENANT GORDON HAVE A CRACK AT IT. THANK YOU, SIR! YOU MIGHT REPOR TO ME IN THE MORNING. WELL, I'LL ONLY BE HERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE, SIR. I'D CERTAINLY LIKE TO GET AWAY. COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE I CAN REACH YOU? I'M AFRAID NOT. WELL, IS THERE ANY CHANCE THA I CAN MAKE THA FIRST BOAT, SIR? I'M ALMOST CERTAIN YOU COULDN'T. GOOD NIGHT, LIEUTENANT. GOOD NIGHT. MAJOR BRENNAN. MR. GRAYSON WILL ESCOR YOU TO THE BRIDGE. YES, SIR. HERE'S THE CODE BOOK, CAPTAIN. THANK YOU, SIR. WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO ENSURE ITS SECRECY. I UNDERSTAND, SIR. THE RENDEZVOUS POSITION WILL BE RADIOED TO YOU AT SEA. GOD SPEED YOU, CAPTAIN. WE'VE BEEN ON THE WRONG TRACK ALL NIGHT. IT ALSO PROVES THAT I'M NO GOING ANYWHERE FOR A WHILE. NEW INTERCEPT, SIR. THE INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT REPORTS THAT IT MAY BE IMPORTANT. IT'S BEEN SENT 8 TIMES THE LAST TWO HOURS. DEAN. YES, SIR. ERASE THAT STUFF ON THE BOARD, WILL YOU? AND PUT THIS IN IT'S PLACE. YES, SIR. WE MIGHT AS WELL TAKE A CRACK AT IT. MORNING, BOYS. MORNING, MISS CARTER. SORRY, MISS CARTER. OH, I FOOLED YOU, BOYS. THIS TIME I HAVE ONE. OH, GOOD MORNING! HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING ALL NIGHT? OH, NO. NO, WE JUST CAROUSED. GOT A CASE OF SCOTCH, A 3-PIECE ORCHESTRA, AND MADE A NIGHT OF IT. NOW, BILL, BILL, DO YOU WANT TO KILL YOURSELF, STARTING OFF AT A PACE LIKE THIS? IDEALLY, YOU SHOULD HAVE SOMEONE TO RELIEVE YOU. MISS CARTER, YOUR CONCERN TOUCHES ME DEEPLY. I'M MOVED ALMOST TO TEARS. WELL, I CAN GO TO MY UNCLE- YOUR UNCLE, MY EYE. I'LL GET MYSELF OUT OF THIS MESS. YOU CAN PUT ON YOUR RUNNING PANTS AND TAKE A NICE MARATHON OUT INTO THE COUNTRY- ABOUT 30 MILES OUT, WHERE THE COWS ARE. OH, BUT, BILL, PROMISE ME YOU'LL LIE DOWN FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE AT LEAST- I PROMISE YOU THAT IF YOU DON'T GET OUT OF HERE, I'LL LIE DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND SCREAM. I'LL GO. I'LL GO. HAVE YOU SOMETHING- SOME KIND OF SEDATIVE TO PUT A NERVOUS PERSON TO SLEEP? YES, MISS. HOW MANY AT A TIME? OH, ONE WILL PUT YOU TO SLEEP IN A HURRY. OH, IT'S NOT FOR ME. SAY, THAT'LL PU A MULE TO SLEEP. THAT'S JUS WHAT IT'S FOR. WILL YOU PLEASE GIVE THIS TO LIEUTENANT GORDON? HE SENT OU FOR IT. YES, MA'AM. AND THE TRICK IS... TO FIND THE COMBINATION... OH, COFFEE, THANKS. JUST WHAT I NEED. NOW, WE CAN DISREGARD THE "HSI" BECAUSE THAT'S MERELY THE WIRELESS CALL SIGNAL. YES, SIR. NOW, LET'S ASSUME FOR A START THAT EACH LETTER THERE MEANS THE LETTER AFTER IT IN THE ALPHABET. YES, SIR. K- L, D-E, W-X, N- O, Y-Z... OH, THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE GETTING US ANYWHERE, DEAN. TRY IT IN THE REVERSE ORDER- THE LETTER BEFORE I IN THE ALPHABET. YES, SIR. SAY, I'LL BE BACK IN JUST A MINUTE. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING, LIEUTENANT. YOU HAVEN'T SOMETHING IN HERE THAT'LL KEEP A FELLOW AWAKE, HAVE YOU? I'VE TRIED COFFEE, AND I DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING. I THINK SO. YOU'RE THE NEW MAN, AREN'T YOU? UH-HUH. HA HA! WELL, I'M PROFESSOR MARTIN. HERE. TRY SOME OF THIS "NO SLEEP." POUR SOME OF IT RIGH IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND. HOW MUCH? OH, A GENEROUS TEASPOON FULL. WELL, I'D BETTER TAKE AN EXTRA BIG SHOT. PUT IT RIGHT IN THIS WATER AND DRINK I RIGHT DOWN. I USED TO GIVE THA TO MY PUPILS WHEN THEY WANTED TO STAY AWAKE WHILE THEY CRAMMED FOR THEIR FINAL EXAMINATIONS. HA! AFRAID THEY STAYED AWAKE, ALL RIGHT, BUT THEY DID VERY LITTLE CRAMMING. WELL, THANKS. YOU'RE WELCOME. THAT WAS JUS WHAT I NEEDED, THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT DIDN'T WORK. I TRIED THE FIRST LETTER FORWARD AND ALSO ONE BACK. AND THAT DIDN'T WORK. WHAT'S THE MATTER, LIEUTENANT? I DON'T KNOW. MY HEAD'S SPINNING, AND MY HEART'S JUMPING. GET A DOCTOR. AND TELL HIM TO BRING A STOMACH PUMP. QUICK! DOCTOR? STOMACH PUMP? I GUESS I PU TOO MANY SLEEPING TABLETS IN YOUR COFFEE. YOU PUT SLEEPING TABLETS IN MY COFFEE? I ONLY WANTED YOU TO GET A LITTLE REST. OH, THIS WOMAN IS MAD. GUARD! GUARD! OH, GUARD. YOU AREN'T GOING TO BE ANGRY WITH ME, ARE YOU, BILL? SHOW THIS LADY THE DOOR - THE FRONT DOOR. AND IF SHE TRIES TO GE IN AGAIN, USE YOUR GUN. OH, BUT, BILL, I JUST WANTED- DON'T SHOOT TO KILL. JUST WING HER. I DON'T WANT HER HAUNTING ME. RIGHT IN THERE, LIEUTENANT. WELL, SUPPOSE YOU TRY TWO LETTERS FORWARD AND TWO BACK. YOU TAKE 3 FORWARD AND 3 BACK. YOU 4, AND YOU 5. AND WILL YOU TAKE 6- YOU 7, 8, 9, CONSECUTIVELY ON DOWN THE LINE. BACKWARD, FORWARD. LIEUTENANT GORDON. YES. THIS LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING. AND 5 BACK. F- I-R-S-FIRST. WELL, THAT CERTAINLY DOES LOOK LIKE SOMETHING. FIRST. FIRST WHAT? FIRST TROOP SHIP? WHAT'S THE NEX GROUP? G- D-O-U-G. FIRST "GDOUG". THAT CERTAINLY DOESN'T SOUND LIKE TROOP SHIP, DOES IT? NO, SIR. SAY, WAIT A MINUTE! WHAT DAY OF THE MONTH IS THIS? FIRST. HEY, YOU DON' SUPPOSE... THAT IN THE LETTERS OF THIS FIRST GROUP THEY'RE USING THE DATE WHEN THE MESSAGE WAS SEN AS A KEY WORD FOR THE RES OF THE MESSAGE, DO YOU? LET'S TRY IT OU ON THE CIPHER WHEELS. LET "A" EQUAL "F" ON YOUR WHEEL. LET "A" EQUAL "I" ON YOURS. LET "A" EQUAL "R" ON YOURS. EQUAL "S" ON YOURS... AND EQUAL "T" ON YOURS. ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S THE FIRST LETTER OF THE MESSAGE? B. B. "B" BECOMES "W." I. BECOMES "A." J. BECOMES "S." Z. BECOMES "H." V. BECOMES "I." W- A-S-H-I HEY, IF THE NEXT LETTER IS ONLY AN "N... " AND IT IS. G- O- N WASHINGTON! WASHINGTON. NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE. LET'S HAVE THE REST OF IT. S- A-I- RIGHT OFF THE STRAIGHT LINE. S- T-A-T-O-S WE GOT IT! "WASHINGTON SAILED STAND BY FOR RENDEZVOUS POSITION." "WASHINGTON SAILED. STAND BY FOR RENDEZVOUS POSITION." THAT'S THE MESSAGE WE SENT TO THE BRITISH ADMIRALTY, MAJOR. EXACTLY. WE INTERCEPT A WIRELESS IN ENEMY CODE. THANKS TO LIEUTENANT GORDON, WE'RE ABLE TO DECODE IT. AND WE FIND THEY'RE SENDING OUT THE SAME MESSAGE THAT WE SENT TO INFORM THEIR U-BOAT COMMANDERS OF THE COMING OF THE TRANSPORT. BUT HOW COULD THEY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT? YOU DON'T THINK THEY COULD HAVE BROKEN YOUR CIPHER? IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S A CODE NOT A CIPHER. ONLY ONE MESSAGE HAS BEEN ENCODED IN IT. WITHOUT A COPY IT'S UNBREAKABLE. THEN SOMEONE MUST HAVE STOLEN IT. NO, NO, NO. EVERY COPY IN WASHINGTON IS UNDER MY PERSONAL CONTROL. WE'VE NO CHOICE. WE MUST RECALL THE SHIP. WE CAN'T RECALL THE SHIP. IT'LL DAMAGE THE ALLIED MORALE TO THE BREAKING POINT. THERE'S NO WAY TO GE A NEW CODE TO THEM. THE RENDEZVOUS POSITION MUST BE SENT IN THE CODE WE GAVE THE SHIP'S CAPTAIN, WHICH HAS BEEN STOLEN BY THE ENEMY. WE'RE IN A NICE MESS. IF WE SEND IT, THE ENEMY KNOWS THE TRANSPORT'S POSITION. IF WE DON'T AND LET THE SHIP TAKE IT'S CHANCES, IT'LL PROBABLY SINK IT ANYWAY. WE STILL HAVE AND WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THEM?

I SHALL SEE TO I THAT YOU HAVE THE COOPERATION OF EVERY DEPARTMEN THAT CAN BE OF THE SLIGHTEST USE. WE'LL NEED IT. THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. WAIT HERE AND KEEP YOUR EYE ON THIS FOR ME. YES, SIR. MISS CULLOUGH'S APARTMENT PLEASE. HELLO, OLIVIA? MY DEAR, COULD YOU COME OVER? COULD YOU? RIGHT AWAY? THANK YOU. WHAT'S THE MATTER, CHARLES? SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED... SOMETHING VERY UNFORTUNATE. ABOUT US? YOU DON'T MEAN THERE'S BEEN SOME GOSSIP? NO, DARLING, NO. THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU TO WORRY ABOUT. BUT IF YOU WORRY, I WORRY. WHAT IS IT, CHARLES? I CAN' UNDERSTAND IT. I KNOW I HAD IT WHEN I LEFT THE DEPARTMENT. I THOUGHT I BROUGH IT UP HERE. IS IT SOMETHING YOU'VE LOST? IS IT IMPORTANT? VITALLY. A DISPATCH. I HAD IT IN MY BRIEFCASE ALONG WITH SOME OTHER PAPERS. ONE CAN HARDLY MISLAY A BRIEFCASE. IF IT SHOULD FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS... OH, BUT IT MUSTN'T. OF COURSE IT WON'T. LET'S TRY AND THINK. HOW LONG AGO DID YOU LEAVE THE DEPARTMENT? ABOUT AN HOUR. AND THEN WHA DID YOU DO? WELL, I WALKED TO THE CLUB, HAD A CUP OF COFFEE, AND THEN TOOK A TAXI. YOU SURE YOU DIDN' LEAVE IT AT THE CLUB? I TELEPHONED IMMEDIATELY. THEY HADN'T FOUND IT. BUT THEY'RE MAKING A THOROUGH SEARCH. WHAT ABOU THE TAXI? I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE NAME OF THE COMPANY. OH, THAT'S EASY. WE'LL NOTIFY THEM ALL. ARE YOU SURE YOU DIDN' STOP OFF ANYWHERE ELSE? HELLO? GET ME THE ACME TAXI COMPANY. THANK YOU. YES. THE TOBACCONIST. BY JOE, I FORGOT THAT. I'LL GO BACK THERE. DARLING, YOU'RE SO TIRED AND OVERWORKED, YOU CAN'T EVEN THINK STRAIGHT. HELLO?

PHONE ME WHEN YOU GET THERE. I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL BETTER ALREADY. HURRY, DARLING. HELLO? LOST AND FOUND DEPARTMENT? YES. I'M REPORTING THE LOSS OF A BRIEFCASE LEFT IN A TAXI. MM-HMM. THANK YOU. DRIVE AROUND THE CORNER. YES, SIR. WOULD YOU LIKE TO EARN $10? WOULD I!? I WANT YOU TO DRIVE BACK TO THE ANDOVER ARMS AND TAKE THIS BRIEFCASE TO APARTMENT 4C. YES. OK. THAT'S A SOFT WAY TO PICK UP 10 BUCKS. WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE TO TELL THE LADY YOU HAND IT TO THE GENTLEMAN LEFT I IN YOUR TAXI ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR AGO AND THAT YOU SAW THE ADDRESS ON THE TAG. I GET YOU. PARTY BY THE NAME OF BRENNAN LIVE HERE? OH, YES. A GENTLEMAN LEF THIS IN MY TAXI. OH, THANKS. WAIT A MOMENT PLEASE. IT'S A LUCKY THING I SAW THE NAME ON THE TAG. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MISS. DID YOU GIVE I TO THE LADY? YES, SIR. ALL RIGHT. NOW FORGE THE WHOLE INCIDENT. YES, SIR. CHARLES! WHERE ARE THEY? FOR YOU. ANYTHING WRONG? YES. OH, HOW DO YOU DO, MY DEAR? COME RIGHT IN. HOW ARE YOU? I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE HAD RELIEVED YOU FROM DUTY. ANYTHING WRONG? EVERYTHING. I KILLED BRENNAN. WHAT? BUT WHY? I COULDN'T HELP IT. I HAD TO, I TELL YOU. AFTER ALL, WHAT'S ONE LIFE IN A WAR? I DON'T REGRE ONE LIFE, ONLY YOUR STUPIDITY. I HAD ONE OF HIS DISPATCHES. HE CAUGHT ME. IT WAS HIS LIFE OR MINE. THERE WAS NO CHOICE. THERE WAS A CHOICE. BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO MAKE IT. WITH BRENNAN KILLED, THEY CAN SUSPECT ONLY ONE THING: THAT WE HAVE THE CODE. THE VITAL THING IS TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY DO SUSPECT. BUT OUR ONLY CONTACT'S GONE. WE MUST FORM A NEW ONE. IMMEDIATELY. IT'S YOUR ONE CHANCE TO REDEEM YOUR BLUNDER. WHAT ARE YOUR ORDERS? IN WAR, ONE MUST ALWAYS CREDIT THE ENEMY WITH AS MUCH INTELLIGENCE AS ONESELF. THEY WILL BE SEARCHING FOR YOU SOON ENOUGH. THE WISEST PLAN IS TO LET THEM FIND YOU. PARADE, REST! MAJOR CHARLES BRENNAN DIED AS HE FOUGHT, BRAVELY AND ALONE, FAR FROM HIS COUNTRY AND HIS HOME. WE OWE HIM A DEBT WHICH CANNOT EVER BE REPAID. WE FERVENTLY PRAY THA GOD MAY REST HIS SOUL IN PEACE. ANY IDEA WHO THAT WOMAN IS, SIR? I HAVEN' THE SLIGHTEST IDEA. MRS. BRENNAN IS IN ENGLAND, ISN'T SHE? YES. IF THAT WOMAN IS A RELATIVE, IT'S STRANGE THAT SHE HASN'T SHOWN BEFORE NOW. IF SHE'S IN DEEP MOURNING. IT IS STRANGE, ISN'T IT? ROBERTS, I'D LIKE YOU TO GIVE ME A BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT MAJOR BRENNAN. IT'S ALL RIGHT. LIEUTENANT GORDON'S BEEN PLACED IN CHARGE. YOU WERE WITH THE MAJOR A LONG WHILE, WEREN'T YOU? YES, SIR. DO YOU KNOW WHETHER HE HAD ANY VERY CLOSE WOMEN FRIENDS? I WOULDN'T KNOW, SIR. SORRY. I SEE. ALL RIGHT, ROBERTS. YES, SIR. RUDY. YES, SIR. THAT WOMAN IN BLACK. HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN HERE? JUST A FEW MOMENTS, SIR. WE'VE BEEN WONDERING WHO SHE IS. SO HAVE WE. UNLESS I MISS MY GUESS, SHE'S BEEN PLANTED HERE. PLANTED? FOR WHAT REASON? OBVIOUSLY TO BE PICKED UP. SUPPOSE YOU TAG HER, FIND OUT WHO SHE IS, THEN PICK HER UP. YES, SIR. WE JUST PICKED THIS UP FROM THE POST OFFICE. IT'S MARKED NEW YORK. MISS OLIVIA KARLOFF, ANDOVER ARMS HOTEL, WASHINGTON, D.C. WELL? THE WOMAN IN BLACK. LAST NIGHT. OH, YES. JUST AN ADVERTISEMENT, APPARENTLY. APPARENTLY. BUT DO YOU NOTICE THE STAMP? JUST AN ORDINARY TWO CENT STAMP. EXACTLY. TWO CENTS. NOW, IF IT'S JUS AN ADVERTISEMENT, IT COULD HAVE GONE FOR ONE CENT... UNSEALED. WHY SHOULD THEY USE A TWO CENT STAMP? WELL, LET'S HAVE A LOOK A IT IN THE REFLECTOSCOPE. THAT'S JUST WHA I WAS THINKING. DO YOU MIND TURNING THAT LIGHT OUT, LIEUTENANT? THANKS. HOW'S IT LOOK TO YOU? FROM OUTWARD APPEARANCES, IT'S A BONA FIDE ADVERTISEMENT. YOU SEE, EVEN THE GRAIN, IF IT HAS BEEN DISTURBED, HAS BEEN CLEVERLY IRONED BACK INTO PLACE. IF THERE'S A HIDDEN MESSAGE, WE'LL HAVE TO FIND THE REAGENT TO BRING IT OUT. THAT'S QUITE A JOB WITH SO MANY REAGENTS. EVERY SECRET INK HAS ITS OWN DEVELOPER. CALLS FOR A LO OF EXPERIMENTATION. YOU KNOW, TRIAL AND ERROR METHOD. NOT A VERY DEFINITE METHOD. WHY, I CAN GIVE I THE FIBER TEST RIGHT NOW. WON'T TAKE A MINUTE. LET'S DO IT. YOUR HUNCH WAS RIGHT, LIEUTENANT. THIS CIRCULAR UNDOUBTEDLY CONTAINS A HIDDEN MESSAGE. THEN IF WE CAN GET SOME HIN AS TO THE TYPE OF REAGENT... WHERE DO SPIES GENERALLY CARRY REAGENT? WELL, 9 TIMES OUT OF 10, THE REAGENT IS IMPREGNATED IN THE CLOTHING WORN BY THE PERSON TO WHOM THE MESSAGE IS SENT. IN CASE IT'S A WOMAN, IT MAY BE HER STOCKINGS OR PERHAPS HER UNDERWEAR, OR IN CLOTH-COVERED BUTTONS, OR... I'VE GOT ANOTHER HUNCH. YES? I THINK WITHIN AN HOUR, I CAN PROVIDE THE REAGENT WE'RE AFTER. MEANTIME, GO ON WITH YOUR EXPERIMENTING, PROFESSOR. JUST WHAT ARE YOU DOING? OH! GOOD MORNING, BILL. HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE? WELL, I HAD A PASS FOR THE CHAMBER, ALL RIGHT. WHEN YOUR ORDERLY WEN TO THE FILING CABINET, WHY, I JUST OPENED THE DOOR AND WALKED RIGHT IN. I'LL BET THEY NEVER EVEN MISSED ME. I BET I SHAN'T EITHER. SUPPOSE YOU OPEN THE DOOR AND WALK RIGHT OUT AGAIN? BUT, BILL, I ONLY CAME BECAUSE I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU. THE LAST TIME YOU WORRIED ABOUT ME, YOU NEARLY KILLED ME WITH SLEEPING POWDERS. NOW IT'S A BAYONET. OH, BILL, DON'T BE SILLY. IT WAS THE ONLY THING I COULD FIND IN HERE TO CUT THE STRING ON MY PARCEL. OH. THE DEPARTMENT GAVE ME THIS OFFICE TO FIGHT A WAR, NOT FOR YOU TO USE AS A PARCEL ROOM. COME ON. OH, BUT, BILL, LOOK WHA I HAVE FOR YOU IN HERE. OUT YOU GO. BUT, PLEASE. WAIT A MINUTE. COME ON. BUT, BILL, REALLY. IT'S FOR YOU. I GOT UP EARLY THIS MORNING AND GOT IT JUS FOR YOUR PROTECTION. AND THE MAN I BOUGHT IF FROM SAID YOU COULDN'T EVEN FEEL IT WHEN YOU HAD IT ON. WHY, YOU CAN WASH IT, AND IT WON'T RUST. IT'S THIN, AND WILL STAND ALL KINDS OF ABUSE. I'LL BITE. WHAT IS IT? WHAT IS IT? A BULLETPROOF VEST. NO ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT. NO ONE, DEAR. NO ONE AT LIBERTY. SLEEPING TABLETS, BAYONETS, BULLETPROOF VESTS, HUH! WHAT A GAL. COME ON. UH-UH. NO, YOU DON'T. I WON'T GO UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHEN I CAN SEE YOU. HMM. HOW ABOU DINNER TONIGHT, BILL? I'VE GOT TO EAT. I SUPPOSE IT MIGH AS WELL BE WITH YOU. OH, LOVELY. BILL, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO WEAR TONIGHT? HOW ABOUT A STRAIT-JACKET? HEE HEE HEE. OH, HOW DO YOU DO? WELL,GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE. WON'T YOU COME IN, PLEASE? I'LL JOIN YOU IN JUST A MOMENT. BYE. OLIVIA KARLOFF. RUSSIAN. SHE CAME BACK TO WASHINGTON BY CAB. WENT TO THE ANDOVER ARMS APARTMENTS WHERE BRENNAN WAS KILLED. THANK YOU. WON'T YOU SIT DOWN, PLEASE? NO, THANKS. BUT I WOULD LIKE SOME EXPLANATION OF THIS INSANITY. NOW, MISS KARLOFF, YOU WERE BROUGHT HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS, NOT TO ASK THEM. UH, DO YOU MIND REMOVING YOUR VEIL? NOT AT ALL. THANK YOU. AND NOW I'LL HAVE TO ASK YOU TO TAKE OFF THE REST OF YOUR CLOTHES. OH, I BEG YOUR PARDON. HEH. THAT WAS RATHER ABRUPT, WASN'T IT? YES, RATHER. UH, WILL YOU SEND ME A MATRON, PLEASE? WOULD IT BE ASKING TOO MUCH FOR YOU TO TELL ME WHY YOU'RE SO INTERESTED IN MY CLOTHES? OH, NOT AT ALL. WE WANT THEM FOR CHEMICAL INVESTIGATION. IT'S A RULE, YOU UNDERSTAND. MM-HMM. YES. I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. YOU SENT FOR A MATRON, SIR. YES. WILL YOU PLEASE TAKE MISS KARLOFF BEHIND THAT SCREEN AND GET HER CLOTHES? YES, SIR. THIS WAY, PLEASE. NOTHING IN THE HAT, LIEUTENANT. HERE YOU ARE, SIR. DO YOU WISH TO EXAMINENEHESE? IS THAT ALL, MATRON? THAT'S ALL. SHE'S BOWLEGGED. WOULD YOU PLEASE GIVE MISS KARLOFF THAT COAT? THEN GO TO THE NEARES DEPARTMENT STORE AND GET HER A NEW OUTFI TO REPLACE THESE. SIZE 14. SHE'LL NEVER GE INTO A 14. GO GET IT, PLEASE. HERE'S A LITTLE WORK FOR THE BOYS. I THINK I'LL HAVE THE MARRIED ONES WORK ON THESE. I SEE. THEN WHY WERE YOU AT MAJOR BRENNAN'S FUNERAL LAST NIGHT? FUNERAL? MY MEN FOLLOWED YOU FROM THE DOCK. I WENT TO THE BOA TO SEE A FRIEND OFF. CERTAINLY YOU WEN TO SEE A FRIEND OFF. AND THAT FRIEND WAS BRENNAN. WHY DON'T YOU STOP LYING? OUR RECORDS SHOW THAT YOU CAME TO THIS COUNTRY WITH HIM, YOU STAYED A THE SAME HOTEL, YOU DINED TOGETHER, HE MADE YOU EXPENSIVE PRESENTS, AND LAST NIGHT, YOU WERE AT HIS FUNERAL. WHAT WERE YOU TO HIM? I LOVED HIM. LET'S HAVE THE REST OF IT. I WENT TO HIS APARTMEN AROUND 4:00 THAT DAY. HE WASN'T THERE. SO I THOUGHT I'D FIX SOME TEA AND HAVE IT FOR HIM WHEN HE RETURNED. I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN, HE WAS ON THE FLOOR. I WAS ABOU TO TELEPHONE THE POLICE, BUT I WAS AFRAID OF EXPOSURE. WHY DID YOU FEAR EXPOSURE? BECAUSE I'D HAVE TO TELL THE POLICE THE SAME AS I'M TELLING YOU. YOU SEE, HIS WIFE NEVER KNEW ABOUT US. TO HER, BRENNAN WILL HAVE DIED IN THE SERVICE FOR HIS COUNTRY. THAT WAS VERY GENEROUS OF YOU. GENEROUS. DO YOU THINK I CARE ABOUT HER? I DID IT FOR HIM... BECAUSE I KNEW HE'D WANT IT THAT WAY. CIGARETTE? YOU SEE, I'M RATHER LONELY HERE. MOST OF MY FRIENDS ARE IN ENGLAND. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KEEP ME HERE, ARE YOU? IF YOUR PASSPOR IS IN ORDER, THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING TO PREVENT YOUR LEAVING. HOPE I HAVEN' FORGOTTEN ANYTHING. I'LL GET YOU A RELEASE FROM THE SECRETARY OF WAR. THANKS. THIS IS MY FIRS EXPERIENCE WITH AMERICAN OFFICERS. HOW DID YOU MAKE OUT? IT WAS VERY PLEASANT. LIEUTENANT GORDON IS CHARMING. DON'T YOU THINK SO? WELL, OF COURSE I'VE ALWAYS MET HIM WITH MY CLOTHES ON. OH, LIEUTENANT, I- HE'S NOT HERE. WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS? YES, HE WENT TO SEE THE SECRETARY OF WAR. WELL, WHEN HE RETURNS, WOULD YOU KINDLY HAVE HIM SEE ME IMMEDIATELY ABOU THIS BEAUTY CIRCULAR? CERTAINLY. THANK YOU. FINE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND, LIEUTENANT, WHY YOU WANT TO LET HER KNOW WE HAVE THE CIRCULAR. THE IDEA IS TO FORCE HER HAND TODAY. UNLESS THE GERMAN RING IS ROUNDED UP IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS, WE CAN'T SEND THE RENDEZVOUS POSITION TO THAT TROOP SHIP. NOW, IF THAT BEAUTY CIRCULAR CONTAINS DAMAGING INFORMATION- OH, I GET YOU. SHE'LL CONTACT HEADQUARTERS TO WARN THE OTHERS. EXACTLY. WHEN THAT WOMAN LEAVES MY OFFICE, DON'T LOSE HER FOR A SECOND. TELL CLARK TO PUT TWO MEN ON HER TELEPHONE IMMEDIATELY. OK. OH, UH, MISS KARLOFF, I DO HOPE YOU LIKE THE OUTFIT. I DID TRY TO GE SOMETHING BECOMING. THAT WILL BE ALL, MATRON. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT SHOPPING FOR SOMEONE ELSE, YOU KNOW. YES. AND SUCH A BARGAIN, TOO. ONLY $4.98 FOR THE WHOLE OUTFIT. I'M AFRAID THIS HAS BEEN RATHER TRYING FOR YOU. BUT NOT UNINTERESTING, LIEUTENANT. SUPPOSE I TELEPHONE YOU TOMORROW. YES. I THINK I SHALL FEEL BETTER IN THE MORNING. ABOUT 10:00? AT 10:00. GOOD. OH, MATRON, WHEN I GO SHOPPING FOR MY FALL OUTFIT, MAY I CALL ON YOU? MADE A MONKEY OUT OF YOU, DIDN'T SHE? ARE YOU SURE SHE DIDN' MAKE ONE OUT OF YOU? HEH HEH. BROUGHT THIS MAN FROM THE CODING ROOM TO TRANSLATE THIS FOR YOU. IT'S IN RUSSIAN. FOLLOWED HER EVERY MINUTE FROM THE TIME SHE LEFT HERE. SHE WENT FIRST TO THE ORTHODOX CHURCH. INSIDE THE DOOR, SHE BOUGHT A CANDLE. THEN SHE WROTE ON THAT SLIP OF PAPER AND LEFT IT FOR THE PRIEST THERE. CAN YOU TRANSLATE IT? OH, YES. IT'S FROM THE CHURCH, HUH? IN MEMORY OF THE SERVAN OF GOD, WILLIAM BRENNAN, PLEASE OFFER UP A PRAYER. WELL, THAT'S THE FINAL TEST. IT'S NEGATIVE. JUST A PRAYER SLIP, AFTER ALL. HMM... WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING QUEER ABOUT THIS CHURCH BUSINESS. YOU'RE SURE THA SHE DIDN'T SPEAK TO ANYBODY AFTER SHE BOUGH THE CANDLE? WE'RE POSITIVE, LIEUTENANT. SHE WENT OVER TO THE ALTAR AND KNELT DOWN TO PRAY. HMM. WELL, WE'LL KEEP ON SHADOWING HER, THOUGH I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO GET US ANYWHERE. SHE'S A VERY CLEVER WOMAN. YOU SAY SHE WENT STRAIGH HOME FROM THE CHURCH, HUH? YES, LIEUTENANT. LOOK UP THE NUMBER TO THE ANDOVER ARMS FOR ME. WILL YOU? RIGHT. GOT AN IDEA? WELL, CHURCH OR NO CHURCH, SHE MUST BE PRETTY WORRIED ABOUT THAT CIRCULAR. IF I CAN CATCH HER RIGH NOW WHILE SHE IS WORRIED, I MAY BE ABLE TO FIND OUT WHAT SHE KNOWS. CAPITAL 7296. THANKS. CAPITAL 72- UH, NEVER MIND, OPERATOR. NOW WHAT? IT JUST STRUCK ME. IF SHE REALLY IS WORRIED, SHE'LL TRY TO FIND OU WHAT I KNOW, WON'T SHE? YES, I GUESS SHE WILL. LET'S WAIT AND SEE IF SHE DOESN'T PHONE ME. HOW'S THA FOR DEDUCTION? ALL RIGHT, IF IT WORKS. MEANTIME, KEEP RIGHT AFTER THAT CIRCULAR, PROFESSOR. THERE'S SOMETHING THERE SOMEWHERE. I'LL WEAR OU THE PAPER TRYING. THAT'S THE IDEA. HELLO. YOU'LL FIND CIGARS IN THE LOWER DRAWER. WELL? WELL, WHAT? WELL, HOW DO I LOOK? YOU'RE SURELY NOT GOING TO WEAR THAT OUTFIT. WELL, CERTAINLY. WHY, BILL, I WORE I JUST TO PLEASE YOU. IT'S GOING TO LOOK SWELL IN THE CAFETERIA. CAFETERIA?! OH, I ORDERED A TABLE FOR US AT THE CORDON ROUGE. I'M SORRY, BUT 30 MINUTES IS AS LONG AS THIS DESK CAN SPARE ME FOR DINNER THIS EVENING. OHHH. IF I HAD ANY PRIDE, I'D GO RIGHT HOME. INSTEAD OF THAT, HERE I AM CHASING YOU. DO YOU KNOW ANY OTHER GIRLS WHO WOULD? THOUSANDS. THEN WHY DON' YOU GET YOURSELF ONE? HOW CAN I WITH YOU SNOOPING AROUND ALL THE TIME? HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE YOUR EYES SCRATCHED OUT? HELLO? OH, MISS KARLOFF. FINE. I'M GLAD YOU CALLED. SUPPOSE WE HAVE DINNER TOGETHER THIS EVENING? CORDON ROUGE? FINE, FINE. HEH HEH. GOOD-BYE. I THOUGHT YOU WERE HAVING DINNER WITH ME. NOW, JOEL, YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T DO THIS IF IT WEREN'T VERY IMPORTANT. ALL I KNOW IS THAT YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR PROMISE TO ME. WHY MUST I ALWAYS KEEP REMINDING YOU THAT THERE'S A WAR GOING ON? OF COURSE, I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO TAKE THE CORDON ROUGE. YOU WERE TOO BUSY. A CAFETERIA WAS ALL YOU COULD OFFER ME. BUT THE MINUTE THAT-THAT VENUS OF THE RUSSIAN STEPPES CALLS, YOU HAVE THE TIME AND THE INCLINATION. BUT, MY DEAR- ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD. I DON'T HAVE TO THROW MYSELF AWAY ON YOU. I'M STILL YOUNG. I'M BEAUTIFUL. I'LL GO WHERE I'M APPRECIATED. WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND I CANNOT NEGLEC ANY POSSIBILITIES. OF COURSE NOT. I NEVER MET THE MAN YET THAT COULD. WE'LL ORDER DESSERT LATER. YES, SIR. I SUPPOSE, LIEUTENANT, YOU'VE BEEN WONDERING WHY I ASKED YOU TO TAKE ME TO DINNER. I RATHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT IT WAS BECAUSE YOU, UH, WANTED TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME. I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU, LIEUTENANT, ABOUT A VERY SERIOUS MATTER. YES? THIS AFTERNOON IN YOUR OFFICE, ONE OF YOUR MEN BROUGH IN A BEAUTY CIRCULAR. I COULDN'T HELP SEEING IT. WELL? WOULD YOU TELL ME WHERE YOU FOUND THAT CIRCULAR? AT THE POST OFFICE... ADDRESSED TO YOU. OH! THANK YOU. I FEEL BETTER NOW. LIEUTENANT, THE DAY THA MAJOR BRENNAN WAS KILLED- OH, HELLO! SURPRISED TO SEE ME? NO. AREN'T YOU DANCING, TOO? NO. CHATTY FELLOW, ISN'T HE? OH, I FORGOT YOU TWO DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER. MAY I PRESEN LIEUTENANT GORDON, CAPTAIN NIETERSTEIN. HOW DO YOU DO? HOW DO YOU DO? ALLOW ME. MISS KARLOFF, MISS CARTER. THE MATRON, YOU'LL REMEMBER. THIS IS HER NIGHT OFF. OH, UH, CAPTAIN NIETERSTEIN. OH, HELLO, UNCLE JOHN. OH, HELLO, JOEL... GORDON, CAPTAIN. MISS KARLOFF, MR. CARTER. HOW DO YOU DO? SO THIS IS WHERE YOU FIGHT THE WAR, EH? COLONEL PETROFF AND I JUST CAME FROM A LATE ORDNANCE CONFERENCE. CAPTAIN NIETERSTEIN. HIS EXCELLENCE HAS JUST CALLED YOU, SIR. WOULD YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO RETURN IMMEDIATELY? THANK YOU. WHAT? I'M TERRIBLY SORRY. I'M AFRAID I HAVE NO CHOICE. MAY I TAKE YOU HOME? YOU CERTAINLY MAY NOT. I JUST LEFT HOME. WELL, I SHALL BE BACK AS SOON AS I CAN. WELL, DON'T HURRY ON MY ACCOUNT. I'M AMONG FRIENDS. WELL, FORGIVE ME AND AU REVOIR. AH, THIS WAR IS GETTING TO BE A NUISANCE, ISN'T IT? OH, UNCLE JOHN, WHY DON'T YOU ASK COLONEL WHAT'S-HIS-NAME TO COME OVER HERE AND WE ALL 5 COULD BE TOGETHER. HE WOULDN'T MIND, WOULD HE? UH, WELL, WE BETTER GO BACK TO MY TABLE. YOU'LL EXCUSE US, WON'T YOU? OH! ALWAYS GLAD TO EXCUSE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO GO BACK TO HIS OWN TABLE. YOU'RE NO FOOLING ANYONE. THAT MEANT ME. I'M SORRY FOR THESE INTERRUPTIONS. NOW, WHAT ABOU MAJOR BRENNAN? THE DAY THA MAJOR BRENNAN WAS KILLED, HE RECEIVED A BEAUTY CIRCULAR EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE I SAW IN YOUR OFFICE. HE DID? YES, I REMEMBER LAUGHING ABOUT IT AT THE TIME- A MAN RECEIVING A BEAUTY CIRCULAR. WE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT THEN. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT NOW? BECAUSE YOU ATTACH SO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO IT. OH, I KNOW YOU MUST. AND IT WAS ADDRESSED TO ME. WELL, MISS KARLOFF, WE INTERCEPTED THAT CIRCULAR JUST AS WE WOULD HAVE INTERCEPTED ANY MESSAGE COMING TO YOU. YOU WERE UNDER SUSPICION BECAUSE OF YOUR ACKNOWLEDGED AFFILIATION WITH A MAN WHO WAS KILLED. OH, I SEE. OF COURSE, I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THESE THINGS. BUT ISN'T THERE SOME WAY THA YOU CAN TRACE A LETTER LIKE THAT, FIND OUT WHO SENT IT? AND THEN, IF THERE IS ANY DANGER... I ASSURE YOU, WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR TELLING ME ABOUT IT. IT MAY LEAD TO SOMETHING. CALL FOR YOU, LIEUTENANT. I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE HAD DINNER IN MY OFFICE. PARDON ME. HELLO? HELLO! GORDON! THIS IS MARTIN! YES? GORDON I'VE GOT IT! THE BEAUTY CIRCULAR-IT'S- OH, THE PAPER. YEAH, YOU'LL FIND THAT ON MARTIN'S DESK. YES. I LEFT IT THERE THIS AFTERNOON. IF YOU GENTLEMEN THINK I'M GOING TO LEAVE MY DINNER FOR ANY SUCH NONSENSE, YOU'RE SADLY MISTAKEN. WELL, IF YOU CAN'T FIND IT, WHY DON'T YOU CALL ON THE BOY SCOUTS THEY'RE USUALLY VERY EFFECTIVE. HELLO? HELLO? WHO IS THIS? THE PAPER MUST BE THERE. I LEFT IT THERE JUST AS SURE AS MY NAME'S BILL GORDON. OH, LIEUTENANT GORDON. WELL, A TERRIBLE THING HAS HAPPENED. THEY'VE JUST KILLED PROFESSOR MARTIN. MAYBE MARTIN'S GOT IT ON HIM. THE WHOLE INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY CAN'T FIND A PAPER. HA HA HA. NO SIR. THERE'S NOTHING HERE. YES, SIR. I'M POSITIVE. OH, ALL RIGHT. LET IT GO. I'LL FIND I IN THE MORNING. NO. IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT DOESN'T MATTER. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. GOOD NIGHT. CONFOUND THESE INTERRUPTIONS. I SUPPOSE I'M TERRIBLY SILLY, BUT I AM REALLY FRIGHTENED, LIEUTENANT. BUT YOU MUSTN'T BE. I'LL SEE TO IT THAT YOU GE ALL THE PROTECTION IN THE WORLD. YOU SEE, AFTER CHARLES WAS KILLED, I HAD NO ONE TO TURN TO, NO ONE TO HELP ME. AH, BUT THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE. I'D LIKE YOU TO FEEL THAT I'M YOUR FRIEND; THAT IS, IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION. OH! WILL YOU EXCUSE ME A FEW MOMENTS WHILE I MAKE SOME REPAIRS? WELL, AS YOUR NEWLY ELECTED BODYGUARD, I SHOULDN'T LET YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT. WE'LL START OUR SERVICE OF PROTECTION WHEN I RETURN. NIETERSTEIN GOT THE CIRCULAR. GOOD. DID YOU GE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE RENDEZVOUS POSITION OF THE SHIP? I HARDLY HAD TIME. TIME IS SHORT. THE AMERICANS MUST BE MADE TO FEEL THAT IT'S SAFE TO SEND A MESSAGE. SOMEONE MUST BE CAPTURED AND THE CODE BOOK FOUND ON HIM. WHO IS IT TO BE? WE HAVE DECIDED ON CAPTAIN NIETERSTEIN. DOES HE KNOW? HE WAS CALLED AWAY FROM HERE AND GIVEN HIS INSTRUCTIONS. HE'S TO APPEAR TO DO HIS DUTY. USE THIS. WHEN? IMMEDIATELY. I'M AFRAID YOUR FRIEND MISS CARTER DOESN'T LIKE ME VERY MUCH. WELL, THAT SHOWS THAT SHE HAS EXCEEDINGLY BAD JUDGMENT. NOW, HOW ABOUT LAUNCHING OUR FRIENDSHIP WITH A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE? UH-UH. NO. NONE FOR ME, THANKS. NO? HAVE YOU BEEN DECORATED? OH, THAT. I FOUND I IN THE LOBBY. CAPTAIN NIETERSTEIN. VERY CARELESS OF THE CAPTAIN, DROPPING HIS MILITARY HONORS AROUND IN CAFE LOBBIES. YES. PARTICULARLY, WHEN HE WASN'T IN UNIFORM AND WORE NO MEDALS. OH! WHY, THAT'S TRUE. I WONDER WHY HE CARRIED THIS ONE WITH HIM. PERHAPS HE'S ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO GO TO BED WITH THEIR MEDALS ON THEIR PAJAMAS. HEH HEH HEH! I WONDER IF YOU'D BE GOOD ENOUGH TO RETURN IT TO THE CAPTAIN FOR ME. OF COURSE. OH! JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE. WHY, THAT'S STRANGE. YES.ERY STRANGE... FOR A MILITARY ATTACHE TO BE CARRYING A REAGENT. WHAT? I HATE TO INTERRUP OUR DINNER, BUT DO YOU MIND COMING WITH ME? WHERE ARE WE GOING? CAPTAIN NIETERSTEIN SAID THAT HE WAS RETURNING TO THE EMBASSY, DIDN'T HE? I BELIEVE SO, YES. WELL, THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING. WON'T YOU SIT DOWN? PARDON ME. MR. CARTER, COULD YOU COME WITH US TO THE EMBASSY? IT'S VERY URGENT. WHY, OF COURSE. COLONEL PETROFF, YOU WON'T MIND SEEING MY NIECE HOME? GOOD NIGHT. I SHOULD BE DELIGHTED! IT'S OUTRAGEOUS! I REALIZE THAT THIS IS VERY IRREGULAR, YOUR EXCELLENCY. IF I'M WRONG, YOUR EXCELLENCY NEED ONLY REPORT ME TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND I'LL BE COURT-MARTIALED. WELL. THAT AT LEAS WILL BE SOME RECOMPENSE. I ALWAYS PAY OFF WHEN I LOSE, SIR. BUT YOU YOURSELF ADMIT I THAT THERE IS NO OFFICIAL REASON WHY CAPTAIN NIETERSTEIN SHOULD POSSESS A REAGENT. THE CAPTAIN HAS ALREADY ASSURED YOU THAT THE MEDAL WAS STOLEN FROM HIM SEVERAL DAYS AGO. I DOUBT VERY MUCH, SIR, WHETHER PEOPLE STEAL MEDALS MERELY TO DIP THE RIBBONS IN REAGENT. I'M PERMITTING YOU TO PROCEED MERELY TO PROVE HOW WRONG YOU ARE. AND I SHALL LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR COURT-MARTIAL. LIEUTENANT GORDON! YES? WOULD YOU LOOK IN THAT DRAWER? VERY USEFUL, I SHOULD SAY, PARTICULARLY, IN WARTIMES. SURELY EVERY MAN IS ENTITLED TO A HOBBY. THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE MINE. NICHOLAS WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED IN ELECTRICAL CONTRAPTIONS. THAT PROVES NOTHING. LIEUTENANT GORDON. IT'S THE OFFICIAL CODE. I CAN'T PERMI THEM TO SEE IT. NATURALLY. THE BRENNAN CODE. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS A-B-C. THE MESSAGES WERE INTERCEPTED WITH THA AND DECODED WITH THIS. FAIRLY COMPLETE, I'D SAY. I'M SORRY, PAPA GREGORY. I HAVE ONLY ONE EXPLANATION TO MAKE: MOTHER WAS GERMAN. YOU SEE HOW DIFFICUL THIS WAR HAS BEEN FOR ME. YOU ALL HAVE ONE COUNTRY AND FIGHT FOR IT. I HAD TWO AND HAD TO CHOOSE FOR ONE AND AGAINST THE OTHER. BELIEVE ME, I DID WHA I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT. NICHOLAS. NICHOLAS. MY COMPLIMENTS. LIEUTENANT GORDON SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF YOU. BUT-BUT I DIDN' DO ANYTHING. I ONLY FOUND THE MEDAL. I NEVER EXPECTED- IT'S A GREAT CONSOLATION TO KNOW YOU'RE SO CONCERNED ABOUT ME. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. BELIEVE THAT. BUT I WOULD HAVE DONE I INTENTIONALLY IF I'D KNOWN. YOU SEE, I, TOO, LOVE MY COUNTRY. I THINK WE CAN GO NOW. DO YOU MIND IF I DRESS? OF COURSE NOT. AAH! WAR, MY DEAR. WAR... DEATH... OH, IT'S HORRIBLE! WHY ARE SUCH THINGS? THEY HAPPEN. THEY ALWAYS WILL, I'M AFRAID. YOUR EXCELLENCY, I'M SORRY, BELIEVE ME. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I REGRET THIS. BUT WE'RE GRATEFUL, DEEPLY GRATEFUL. YOU'VE HELPED US TRAP THE HEAD OF THE... SPY RING, AND I SHALL SEE THAT YOUR SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED. I DON'T WANT RECOGNITION. DO YOU THINK I WAN TO GO THROUGH LIFE WITH SOMETHING TO REMIND ME- WOULD YOU CARE TO GO HOME NOW? IN A MOMENT. IT'LL BE SAFE FOR YOU TO SEND THE RENDEZVOUS POSITION NOW, SIR. I'LL GET BACK TO THE DEPARTMEN AND HAVE IT SEN IMMEDIATELY. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, SIR. WELL... HUH. HERE WE ARE AGAIN. I THOUGHT COLONEL PETROFF WAS SEEING YOU HOME. WELL, YOU DIDN'T EXPECT ME TO SPEND THE REST OF THE WAR WITH THA - THAT AMOROUS FEATHER DUSTER. DON'T YOU THINK I MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO GO HOME FOR A CHANGE. HEY, THAT'S MY TAXI! WELL, IT'S IN THE ARMY NOW. THE ANDOVER ARMS. NO, NO. THE PARK HOTEL. I MOVED AFTER CHARLES WAS... UH, TAXI! TAXI! WHAT IS THE NUMBER OF MISS KARLOFF'S ROOM, PLEASE? MISS KARLOFF IS NOT IN, MADAM. OH, YES, SHE IS. I'M AFRAID MADAM IS MISTAKEN. I JUST SAW HER COME IN HERE WITH LIEUTENANT GORDON. I'LL SEE, MADAM. MISS KARLOFF, PLEASE. HELLO? A LADY JUST- VERY WELL. I WAS MISTAKEN. MISS KARLOFF IS IN. BUT SHE DOESN'T WISH TO BE DISTURBED. OH, SHE DOESN'T WISH TO BE DISTURBED. WELL, SHE'S GOING TO BE. AND I'M JUS THE GIRL TO DO IT. MISS KARLOFF IS A VERY DANGEROUS WOMAN. THERE'S NO TELLING WHA SHE'LL DO TO LIEUTENANT RDON. MY DEAR MISS- MY NAME IS MISS JOEL CARTER AND MY UNCLE HAPPENS TO BE THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF WAR. IF YOU DON'T SHOW ME WHICH IS MISS KARLOFF'S ROOM, I'LL CALL OU THE ARMY AND THE NAVY! AND MAYBE A MARINE IF HE'S NEEDED. VERY WELL, MISS CARTER, SINCE YOU INSIST. THIS GENTLEMAN WILL SHOW YOU UPSTAIRS. THANK YOU. THIS WAY, PLEASE. UH, THIS LADY WISHES TO SEE MISS KARLOFF. THIS WAY, PLEASE. I'M TAKING THE MESSAGE TO MISS KARLOFF NOW. GOOD. NOTE FOR YOU, MISS KARLOFF. OH, THANKS. EXCUSE ME. SURE. BAD NEWS? OH, NO. JUST ANNOYING. ANY ANSWER, MISS KARLOFF? YES. SAY THAT I CAN'T SEE HIM UNTIL THE MORNING. YES, MISS. OH, JUST A MOMENT. I'M NOT IN THE HABIT OF RECEIVING CALLERS AT THIS HOUR. YOU RECEIVED ME. YES, BUT YOU'RE NO A PERSISTENT SUITOR... UNFORTUNATELY. THAT'S ALL. OH, JUST A MINUTE, BOY. SURELY THE GENTLEMAN WILL EXPECT A BETTER ANSWER THAN THAT. YOU THINK SO? WON'T HE BE DISAPPOINTED? CAN YOU SUGGEST ANYTHING BETTER I COULD TELL HIM? YES. YOU MIGHT TELL HIM THAT THERE'S REALLY NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT THE NEW CODE. I'M REALLY NOT VERY GOOD AT RIDDLES, LIEUTENANT. WELL... THAT'S THAT. MY COMPLIMENTS TO YOU AND TO CAPTAIN NIETERSTEIN, A BRAVE MAN. BUT HIS SACRIFICE ONLY CONVINCED US THAT THE BRENNAN CODE WAS USELESS AND THAT WE HAD TO GET A NEW ONE. I'M FROM THE ARMY INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT. I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME TO THE MAN WHO GAVE YOU THAT MESSAGE. YES, SIR. MISS KARLOFF, I THINK YOU'D BETTER COME WITH ME, AND YOU CAN DELIVER YOUR ANSWER PERSONALLY. ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD. DOWN... I SAID DOWN. GET OUT. SORRY, LIEUTENANT GORDON, BUT THE FORTUNES OF WAR- OR THE MISFORTUNES. IN OUR BUSINESS, THERE ARE ALWAYS REVERSES, LIEUTENANT. YOU RECOGNIZE THIS, OF COURSE. SOME SORT OF CODE, I SUPPOSE? THIS IS THE NEW AMERICAN CODE, AND YOU KNOW IT. UNFORTUNATELY, THE WAR DEPARTMEN DOESN'T TELL ME EVERYTHING. COME NOW, LIEUTENANT. EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE THE CODE EXPERT. ONLY SINCE MAJOR BRENNAN'S REMOVAL. PRECISELY. IT WOULD BE VERY UNFORTUNATE IF THE PROCESS WERE TO BE REPEATED. AT LEAST I SHALL HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT WHEN I DO GO, YOUR ONLY KEY TO THE CODE GOES WITH ME. LIEUTENANT, I KNOW THAT YOU ACCEPT WHAT IS... INEVITABLE AND THE INEVITABLE IS THAT I GET BUMPED OFF WHETHER I DECODE THAT MESSAGE OR NOT. SO I'M NO GOING TO DECODE IT. YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT. YOU WILL BE... "BUMPED OFF" ANYWAY, BUT I HAVE AN IDEA THAT YOU WILL DECODE THE MESSAGE BECAUSE... IF YOU PLEASE. AS A SOLDIER, YOU REALIZE THAT AN EMERGENCY REQUIRES EMERGENCY METHODS. I DON'T KNOW ANY EMERGENCY THAT REQUIRES WARRING ON WOMEN. I THOUGHT THERE WAS A CODE OF DECENCY EVEN IN WAR. UNFORTUNATELY, LIEUTENANT, THE SITUATION IS TOO ACUTE FOR THE USUAL AMENITIES. IF I DO DECODE THIS MESSAGE, WHAT GUARANTEE HAVE I THA MISS CARTER WILL BE RELEASED? IF YOU DON'T DECODE THE MESSAGE, YOU'RE SURE OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN. IF YOU DO, WE HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN BY KEEPING HER HERE. WE GET WORD THAT OUR U-BOATS HAVE LOCATED THE RENDEZVOUS POSITION, SHE WILL BE RELEASED. ANOTHER MAN DID SOMETHING LIKE THIS ONCE. HIS NAME WAS BENEDICT ARNOLD. THIS POSITION IS 1,000 MILES OUT OF THE REGULAR SEA LANES. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT DOESN' SEEM TO BE FAR ENOUGH. YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THA WE WILL HOLD MISS CARTER UNTIL THE TRANSPOR IS LOCATED? HARDLY. NOW, SINCE I'M ABOUT TO MAKE AN ABRUPT DEPARTURE, I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO DO A FAVOR FOR ME. OF COURSE. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO MISS CARTER. IN A SHORT WHILE, LIEUTENANT. THANK YOU. LONG DISTANCE. SAN DIEGO 2163W. DR. JACKSON. HELLO? YES? OH, IT'S YOU. HOW ARE YOU? YES. FINE. THAT'S SPLENDID. YOU NEED HAVE NO WORRY. THE MEDICINE WILL REACH THE PATIENT IN 20 MINUTES. MISS CARTER IS HERE. BRING HER IN, THEN JOIN US IN THE NEXT ROOM. VERY SMART, MR. GORDON. HAVING ME MANHANDLED AND GAGGED AND PUSHED AROUND WHILE YOU PLAY RUSSIAN BANK WITH THAT-THAT BLONDE? WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? FU MANCHU? JOEL, WHETHER YOU HEARD ABOUT IT OR NOT, THERE'S A WAR GOING ON IN EUROPE. THERE'S A WAR GOING ON RIGHT IN THIS ROOM. YOU HAVE BEEN MAKING SOMETHING OF A NUISANCE OF YOURSELF, DEAR. AFTER ALL, I'VE HAD WORK TO DO. YOU'RE STANDING THERE LIKE A NOBLE, LONG-SUFFERING MARTYR JUST WAITING FOR ME TO SPEAK MY PEACE AND GO. YOU DON'T WANT TO SEND ME AWAY, DO YOU, BILL? NO, DARLING. I MUST STAY HERE FOR A WHILE. BUT I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW? YES, DEAR. YOU KNOW, BILL, UH, I CAN'T HELP BEING A LITTLE SCATTERBRAINED AND GIDDY ABOUT YOU EVERY- DON'T SHOOT. DON'T SHOOT. IT'S PATRICK O'REILLY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. I NEVER SHOT A MAN BY NAME OF PATRICK O'REILLY IN MY LIFE. HERE. NO, YOU DON'T. I'LL HAVE THE HANDCUFFS ON YOU, ME BUCKO. GORDON! ALL PRESENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR, MR. CARTER. GET ON YOUR FEET HERE. QUICK! TAKE HIM OUT, BOYS. HOW ABOUT THE RES OF OUR SEWING CIRCLE? WELL, THEY'RE ALL PRESEN AND ACCOUNTED FOR, TOO. NOT QUITE ALL, SIR. REILLY. YES, SIR. THERE'S A DR. JACKSON AT SAN DIEGO 2163W. YES, SIR. HE'S A TRANSMITTER. PHONE SAN DIEGO TO GET HIM. RIGHT AWAY, SIR. WELL, IT WAS MIGHTY ACCOMMODATING OF THE GERMANS TO SEND OUT THIS MESSAGE TELLING ME WHERE YOU WERE. MR. CARTER, I STAKED EVERYTHING ON YOUR DECIPHERING THAT. YES, AND YOU ALMOST LOST. WHAT SAVED YOU WAS MY KNOWING THAT THE FIRST MESSAGE WE SEND OU UNDER THE FALSE CODE MEANT NOTHING, AND SO THE GERMANS COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE OUR RENDEZVOUS POSITION. HOW ABOU MY POSITION? JOEL! HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING THERE? HIDING? HUH! HIDING? HE DID IT. HE HIT ME OVER THE HEAD WITH A HAMMER. I WHAT?! HE TOLD ME HE LOVED ME AND THEN HE HIT ME OVER THE HEAD WITH A HAMMER. MY DEAR CHILD, GORDON SAVED YOUR LIFE. HMM! THE NEXT THING YOU'LL BE TELLING ME IS THAT I WAS CAPTURED BY THE GERMANS. UH- JOEL... AH, DON'T YOU DARE HIT ME AGAIN. JOEL, DEAR. WELL- CAN YOU READ? IT'S VERY INTERESTING. WHAT IS IT? LATITUDE 37 NORTH, LONGITUDE 15 WEST. IN OTHER WORDS, THE RENDEZVOUS POSITION OF THE GERMAN SPY RING. NONSENSE. THAT'S THE ADDRESS OF THIS HOTEL. MY SWEET, WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL, WERE YOU EVER DROPPED ON ANYTHING? HMM. DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME ALL THOSE PEOPLE WERE SPIES? AH... CAME THE DAWN. HEH HEH HEH. THEN THAT WOMAN WELL, I GUESS THAT OUGH TO TEACH YOU A LESSON, RUNNING AROUND WITH A SPY. WELL, GORDON, YOU SAID YOU WANTED ACTION. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT NOW? I THINK IT'S SWELL. YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU STILL WANT TO GO TO WAR? WHY, I CERTAINLY DO. AND DON'T FORGET, SIR, YOU PROMISED ME THAT AS SOON AS I FINISH THIS JOB, I COULD GO. NO, NO, NO, NO, UNCLE JOHN. DON'T YOU DARE LET HIM GO. HE'S JUST TRYING TO GE OUT OF MARRYING ME. AND TO THINK I COULD HAVE HAD YOU SHOT. OH, DARLING, I THINK I'LL GO ALONG WITH YOU. A WIFE'S PLACE IS WITH HER HUSBAND... WHEN HE'S IN PARIS. AH, BUT I'LL BE UP AT THE FRONT. BUT YOU COULD COME BACK OVER WEEKENDS. OR WE COULD GET THE GERMANS TO COME RIGHT DOWN TO PARIS. THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE TO LEAVE YOU AT ALL. NO, DARLING. YOU CAN DO JUST AS MUCH HARM HERE AS YOU COULD IN PARIS. ALL ABOARD! I HATE GOOD-BYES, DON'T YOU? OF COURSE. I WISH YOU'D KISS ME AND LEAVE ME ALL OF A SUDDEN. THEN I COULD JUST STAND RIGH HERE AND PRETEND YOU'RE GONE FOR A PACKAGE OF CIGARETTES. THAT'S RIGHT, DARLING. I'VE JUST LEFT FOR A MINUTE, AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. AND WHILE I'M GONE, PLEASE BE MISERABLE AND MISS ME AND LOVE ME. LIEUTENANT GORDON? YES. MAJOR SLOAN'S COMPLIMENTS, SIR. YOU'RE TO REPORT BACK AT THE WAR OFFICE AT ONCE FOR DUTY.
