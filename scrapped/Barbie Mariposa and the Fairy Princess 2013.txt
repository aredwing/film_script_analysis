She read every book she could find. And the dashing Prince Carlos also shared her love of reading. Then, one day, Mariposa discovered that the magical lights in Flutterfield were growing dimmer. These lights protected Flutterfield from the Skeezites, monsters who eat Butterfly Fairies. The lights were going out because Henna, an evil Butterfly Fairy, had poisoned Queen Marabella, and it was the Queen's magic that made the lights shine. So, Mariposa and her friends flew to the Bewilderness on a quest for an antidote. But along the way, they faced peril and danger of all kinds. When they finally arrived at the Cave of Reflections, Mariposa proved her courage and earned the antidote. When she did, her wings grew larger and even more beautiful. Mariposa and her friends returned to Flutterfield to discover the Skeezites attacking the Royal Palace. Mariposa gave the antidote to the Queen, who was instantly healed. The magical lights returned, forcing Henna and the Skeezites to flee. Queen Marabella hailed Mariposa and her friends as heroes, which they are to this day. (FAIRIES CHATTERING) (GASPS) Hey, Mariposa! Hello, Mariposa! Hi! (BOTH GIGGLE) WOMAN: Hey, Mariposa! Oh, hello! Morning, Mariposa. Hi! Hey, Mariposa! Good morning. Thanks for the suggestion on the book. Oh, no problem. I'm glad you like it. Wait till you read the sequel. Mariposa. Excuse me. Yes. Sorry to bother you, but I was hoping you might have a chance to say hello. My daughter's a big fan. Of mine? I know all about how you and your friends got the big scary Skeezites out of Flutterfield. Oh, it wasn't just me, there were lots of fairies who helped. Willa helped. Is it true you've read every book in Flutterfield? (LAUGHS) Well, not every one, but there's still time. Will you sign my book? Really? Okay. And whenever you're looking for a book recommendation, come by the Royal Library in the palace. I'm there every day. I will, for sure! Thanks so much, Mariposa! You're welcome. See you later. Bye! Hey! How come I never get an autograph? (CHUCKLES) Because you never have a pen! You must be the most famous librarian ever. "Royal Historian. " And I chose the best job in the world. I get to spend all day with the biggest collection of books in Flutterfield. (SIGHS) It's perfect. (ZEE SCREAMING) (FAIRIES CLAMORING) (THUDDING) (LAUGHING) Easy, Zee. I'm right here. What is it? (CHITTERING EXCITEDLY) The Queen? Did she say why? (CHITTERING CONSPIRATORIALLY) (SHOUTS) That would be a surprise, since it's not Mariposa's birthday. Let's go find out. Zee, lead the way! (CHITTERING) (CHITTERING TEASINGLY) (SMOOCHING) Zee! (LAUGHS) Huh? (CHITTERS) Mariposa. Thank you for coming. Of course, Your Majesty. Prince Carlos. Good morning, Mariposa. (CLEARS THROAT) Oh! Lord Gastrous. (CLEARS THROAT) Mariposa, tell me, what do you know about Crystal Fairies? The Crystal Fairies? From Shimmervale? Crystal Fairies? Yuck! Well... Huh? (GRUNTS) Their land is built on an amazing natural energy source called Crystallites, and the Crystallites heat and power everything in their realm. See, Mother, I told you she'd be the perfect choice. Hardly. She hasn't mentioned that they're vicious, vile, and the sworn enemies of the Butterfly Fairies. With all due respect, Lord Gastrous, I don't believe that to be true. Ah-ha! You see? Misinformation! I've been around long enough to know who our enemies are. Mariposa, Crystal Fairies are scary and cruel. Everyone knows that. Only because that's what we've been led to believe. It's what's in our fairy tales. But the real history is different. Look. MARIPOSA: Centuries ago, Butterfly and Crystal Fairies were allies. Then, the Crystal Fairy King accused the Butterfly Fairies of trying to steal their Crystallites. The Butterfly Fairies denied it, the Crystal Fairies didn't believe them, and everyone got angrier and angrier until the two sides declared themselves eternal enemies, and vowed never to have contact again. Okay, but what about the part where the Crystal Fairies grind the Butterfly Fairies' wings to make their bread? Where's the picture of that? You won't find it. It never happened. Preposterous! Your Majesty, the girl has no idea what she's talking about! But I do! Your Majesty, all the horrible stories about Crystal Fairies are just that, stories. This is history. And it's exactly the thing on which we should base our decisions. Research, not hearsay. I'm convinced. Mariposa, you shall leave for Shimmervale as Flutterfield's Royal Ambassador. You will live with the Royal Family for one week, and prove that... (CLEARS THROAT) ...Butterfly Fairies and Crystal Fairies can be friends. Huh? What? But Crystal Fairies are dangerous! If Mariposa goes there, she'll be... Welcomed as an honored guest. That's what King Regellius assures me. The Crystal Fairies will love you, Mariposa. I know it. But, who will look after the Royal Library? Willa can manage that. She can? I can? (CHITTERING INQUISITIVELY) Of course she can. And I will help also. I... I'm sorry. I can't. Your Majesty. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) (CHITTERING NERVOUSLY) Mariposa! (SNORING) (SIGHS) Ah, Willa told me I'd find you here. Hello, Carlos. (CHITTERING GROGGILY) Ooh! Why won't you go to Shimmervale? I don't think I'm ambassador material. Oh, but you are the smartest fairy I know. You've read every book on Shimmervale. Yeah, I'm great with books. But making peace with the Crystal Fairies? I can't do that. But I know you'll win them over. But what if I don't? What if I say or do the wrong thing? What if I make things worse? You won't. We all believe in you. Just be yourself. And remember, the best way to make a friend, is to be a friend. Hmm. Oh! I almost forgot. My mother asked me to give this to you. Ooh. It's beautiful. It's a Flutter Flower. It's made from the most precious magic of Flutterfield. Whenever you have doubts, just take it out and it will remind you of us. I'll go. Please, thank the Queen for me. You'll be welcomed on the outskirts of Shimmervale. Guess I'll see you when I get back, then. Bye, Carlos. Goodbye. And good luck! ZEE: Goodbye! Goodbye! Okay, Mondays, the new manuscripts come in. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you need to lead the guided tours. On Wednesdays, the tapestries get touched up and cleaned, and on Fridays, we read to the elderly. Did you get all that? Yes. I think so. Uh, what was that thing you said? After "Monday"? There! Is there anything I forgot? Um... Your clothes? Oh, right. (CHUCKLES) Hmm. I'm on it. (ZEE CHITTERING) (SCREAMS) (LAUGHS) (MUTTERING) Oh, Zee. (BOTH GRUNTING) (GRUMBLES) (BOTH GRUNTING) Come on! (ALL GRUNTING) (STRAINING) (BOTH PANTING) Piece of cake. (SIGHS) Thanks. Wish me luck. Be careful, okay? I will! Good luck. Okay, Zee, we're ready to go! Zee? Looks like one of your books doesn't want to go. Zee. You're not afraid of the Crystal Fairies, are you? Mmm-mmm. Mmm-hmm. Zee, it'll be fine. There are no stories about Crystal Fairies eating puffballs. (WHIMPERS) Come on. Let's go have an adventure! (LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) (CHUCKLING) (ZEE GIGGLING) Ooh. (GASPS) Yay! (ZEE CHUCKLING) (CHUCKLES) (LAUGHING) (CHITTERING INQUISITIVELY) Hello? Boo! (SCREAMS) (SIGHS) (LAUGHS) (CHUCKLES) Huh? (THUNDER RUMBLING) (GASPS) (SCREAMS) (CHUCKLES) Shimmervale; A History says, "Diplomats to Shimmervale receive a grand welcome, "including a parade, marching band, and fireworks. " Ooh. Ooh. (CHIRPING CELEBRATORY TUNE) (ZEE IMITATING FIREWORKS) (MARIPOSA GASPS) This is the meeting spot, Zee! (CHITTERING SUSPICIOUSLY) Hmm, we're right on time. ZEE: Huh? Hmm. (RUSTLING) (SCREAMS) (GROANS) (CHUCKLES) Is someone there? (WHIMPERING) Hello? (GASPS) Don't hurt me! Of course we won't hurt you. I'm Mariposa, from Flutterfield, and this is Zee. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) You're not going to hypnotize me with your wicked magic, then lure me back to your dark, dismal cave and... (CHITTERING INQUISITIVELY) Um... No. (LAUGHS) Oh, goody! I'm Talayla. Your butterfly wings are so beautiful! Thanks, I like yours too. Ooh! Look! How cute. (GASPS) Is that your war beast? War beast? No. Then, yay! How cute! (GRUMBLING) So, is this the grand welcome? (CHIRPING CELEBRATORY TUNE) (IMITATING FIREWORKS) Oh, that. Sorry. The flying band was too afraid to come meet you. (SINGING TRAILS OFF) Ah. It's okay. Huh? (SIGHS) Come on. I'll show you both all around Shimmervale! I mean... (CLEARS THROAT) In the name of his Royal King Regellius, it is my privilege to give you an official tour of our fair land. (GIGGLING) Let's go! (CHITTERING INQUISITIVELY) (LAUGHING) Meh. Welcome to Shimmervale City. (BOTH GASPING) (ZEE PANTING) Ooh! And I see every roof has a Crystallite, the main source of heat and power here in Shimmer... (LAUGHING) That's my line. Sorry. As you can see, every roof has a Crystallite, the main source of heat and power here in Shimmervale. (WOMAN GASPS) MAN: It's a Butterfly Fairy! (GASPS) (GASPS) Hmm? Follow me. TALAYLA: Next stop, GlowWater Falls! Wait. (PANTING) Here it is. Historians say this... Historians say this is where Shimmervale's first residents discovered Crystallites. MARIPOSA: Wow! MARIPOSA: I never thought I'd say this, but pictures don't do it justice. Yup. It's why we end the tour here. (PANTING) Zee? Are you okay? (PANTING) Aw, am I going too fast for you, little puffer? (PANTING) And now to the palace, where you'll be staying. (CHITTERING NERVOUSLY) (LAUGHING) Come on. (PANTING) Wow. (GASPING) The castle was built over 4,000 years ago under the reign of King Fremulous the Fourth. His wife, Queen Safrila, designed much of what we still see today. CATANIA: Hey! Huh? (BOTH GRUNTING) Up here! (SNORTING) Hi. (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) (GROWLING) (BOTH GASPING) Anu! You're scaring her! (GRUMBLING) Ah, you're Mariposa, aren't you? The Butterfly Fairy? Yes. I'm Catania. Oh, it must be so terrifying, flying across Fairytopia to get here. CATANIA: Were you scared? Scared? I don't know, it was more... REGELLIUS: Catania, away from the window! Ah, I've got to go. Nice to meet you. Welcome to the kingdom. (SNARLING) Hey! (LAUGHING) (GROWLING) (LAUGHING) (GROANING) TALAYLA: There you are. I thought I lost another visitor on the tour. I'll never live that down. Anyhoo, let's show you to your room. MARIPOSA: Zee! Come on! (GROWLING) Ooh! (LAUGHING) Yo! Tah-dah! Cuckoo! (ZEE GIGGLING) And now... Tah-dah! (GASPING) Wow! MARIPOSA: It's... (SPLUTTERING IN DISGUST) I decorated it myself. Really interesting. I based it on everything we Crystal Fairies know about Butterfly Fairies. That was thoughtful. Do the trees in Flutterfield really come alive, snatch the fairies in midair, and devour them? What? No! These don't do that, do they? Nah, I couldn't figure out how to make it work. (SIGHS) (SCREAMS) I did put in hidden thorns, though! (GIGGLES) Just like home. (GRUMBLING) (CLEARS THROAT) And now it is my extreme pleasure to invite you to meet His Royal Highness King Regellius, and the Royal Princess Catania. Unless you want to stay here and freshen up, you know, where it's familiar? No, uh, we would be honored to meet the king and princess. (CHUCKLING) Ready to meet the king? I think so. Please welcome Mariposa, Royal Ambassador from Flutterfield! (GROWLING) (GROWLING) I introduce King Regellius and Princess Catania of Shimmervale! (GASPS) Hey! REGELLIUS: "Hey"? Is that how you address the Princess of Shimmervale? No. I, uh... I believe in Flutterfield it's actually a term of deep respect. Isn't that right? Yes! Yes, it is. (CLEARS THROAT) "Hey," Your Majesties. Hey. (CLEARS THROAT) Hey. Hey. (GROWLING) (GROWLING) Is that thing growling at me? A beastly, "How are you?" in Flutterfield. I see. (GROWLING) (SQUEAKS) (CHUCKLES) Cuckoo! Clearly I have much to learn about Butterfly Fairy customs. Let's repair to the terrace for tea. Madam Ambassador. Come on, Sylvie. (NEIGHING) (GROWLING) (WHIMPERS) (GROWLING) Hmm. (BURPING) (SCOFFS) (BOTH GROWLING) (GRUNTING) (BOTH GROANING) Hey! Watch where you're going! You almost made me spill my smoothie. (GROANS) Carlos! Good morning! It's afternoon, actually. Oops. I slept in. Then I stopped by Fluter's Bakery for some Poof Pastries. Breakie? It's lunchtime. Oh. (SCOFFS) No breakfast for you then. (LAUGHS) (SLURPING) Now, let's see. Today's shipment of books has already come in. Check! Inventory new books. (CHUCKLES) (SCREAMS) (SIGHS) This could take a while. (SLURPING) Hmm. (YELPS) (ANU LAUGHING) (GROWLING) (HUMMING) (CLEARS THROAT) So, to defeat the Skeezites, your people must be trained as warriors from birth. Oh, no. We're not warriors. I mean, we have warriors, but we're a very peaceful people. More tea? Please. But I was under the impression Butterfly Fairies were built for battle. The armored scales, the vice-like pincers, the fire breath! Fire breath? Um... Ah... We actually don't have any of those. Hmm. (CLEARS THROAT) (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) I love how the Crystallites shimmer in the sun. Don't touch that! The Crystallites are only to be touched by Crystal Fairies! Oh! Of course. I'm sorry, if I could just... Oh, excuse me. (GROANS) My word! (GASPS) Oh, no! (SCREAMS) (REGELLIUS GROANS) (GROANS) (SNICKERING) Oh! I'm so sorry. This is awful. MARIPOSA: Let me help. Ooh! My bad. Oh, sorry! (GULPS) (SMACKING LIPS) Ah. (GROANS) Here, allow me. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Thank you. Oh! (GASPS) Did I get you? Here, let me see. Please. I prefer you didn't! (SIGHING) Perhaps, Madam Ambassador, it would be best if you simply sat down. And moved a bit farther back from the table. Of course, Your Majesty. (CHAIR SCRAPING) Perhaps, just a little farther. (CHAIR SCRAPING) A bit more... (CHAIR SCRAPING) More. (CHAIR SCRAPING) Teeny bit farther. (CHAIR SCRAPING) Perfect. I'm sorry. What? I said, thank you! (GROANING) (GASPS) Oh, no! (WATER SPLASHING) (GRUNTS) This Royal Tea is over! Come, Catania! (SIGHS) (BOTH CHITTERING) Well, that went better than expected. Don't you think? (SIGHS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (GROANING) Now is the time, Boris. Eight years of planning my revenge. Eight years to hone my magic and become even more powerful. Eight years of talk and no action. When are we gonna get to the revenging? Silence! I need to concentrate. Yes. (GASPS) Yes! Look at it! It's beautiful! Beautiful? Personally, I prefer things to be shinier, you know? Sparkly, like a piece of jewelry, or a lake! That's really shiny, with sun sparkling... (MUFFLED) Beautiful because it's completely destroyed! (GROANING) GWYLLION: Soon all of Shimmervale's Crystallites will have had their final glow. (BOTH LAUGHING EVILLY) (SNORING) (YELPING) (WHIMPERING) (SCREAMS) (WHIMPERING) (CHITTERING) Can't sleep, Zee? (CHITTERING IN FRUSTRATION) I know. I couldn't sleep either. (GRUNTING) There's just so much more to learn about Shimmervale. I can't have anymore tea disasters. (GRUMBLING) Hmm. It says here that outsiders are forbidden to touch a Crystallite, especially the Heartstone, which is the most powerful Crystallite in Shimmervale. That's why the king was so upset at tea. (GRUMBLING) (LAUGHING) Sorry, Zee, but I'm not tired and this light just makes me feel like I'm at home. (GASPS) (LAUGHING) Hey! Why, you... Oh! (BOTH LAUGHING) (SNORING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Good morning. Mariposa? (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) Whoa! Ready for your introduction to the people of Shimmervale? Huh? Huh? We don't want to keep the king and princess waiting, not to mention an entire kingdom of Crystal Fairies! I'll never live that down. One minute! (SNORING) (GRUMBLING) (CHUCKLING) Come on. (NEIGHING) (LAUGHING) (GRUMBLES) Mariposa, before our conversation was interrupted yesterday, you were about to enlighten me as to your weapons training and hand-to-hand combat skills. Combat skills? Yes, the ones you used to fight the Skeezites, of course. Oh. Well, it never really came down to "battle. " Rayla, Rayna and I met Zinzie, and then we all flew to the Bewilderness, where we found clues leading us to the mermaids who told us to fly east to the Cave of Reflection... If you don't want to tell me, just say so! I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be evasive. (GRUNTS) Shimmervale City, Your Highness. (NEIGHING) Please welcome Mariposa, Royal Ambassador from Flutterfield! Well, it looks like everyone is busy today. (DOOR OPENING) We're not busy! Well, it appears my subjects are preoccupied. (DOOR CLOSING) MAN: No, we're not! (SIGHS) Oh! (GASPS) Your crown! (GRUNTING) (BOTH SCREAMING) She's attacking the King! (FAIRIES CLAMORING) (BOTH GROANING) (GRUNTS) I'm sorry! Your crown, Your Majesty. (SIGHS) Perhaps you beat the Skeezites by tripping over them. There will be more people here tomorrow. I'm sure of it. (DOOR SHUTTING) MAN: No, there won't! (DOOR SHUTTING) (SIGHS) We're flying. We're flying. We're flying. And mother thought two years in art school was a waste of time. And we're stopping. (CHUCKLES) (CLEARS THROAT) A long time ago, I forget how long, our fairy forefathers built Flutterfield on top of a putrid swamp. Ah, but Miss? It says that Flutterfield was built on a magnificent and exquisite garden. Yeah. Moving on. Okay, over here you'll see our resident mural guy painting some kind of picture? ALL: Ooh! (CARLOS CHUCKLING) Willa, you're not supposed to bring the visitors back here. Please stand back, this is a very fragile... (GASPING) ...tapestry. Okay, people. We're flying, we're flying. MAN 1: You're not very good at this, are you? MAN 2: When's Mariposa coming back? WOMAN: Can I get a refund? (SNORING) (YAWNING) Huh? (CHUCKLING) (BLOWING A RASPBERRY) (HUMMING) Good morning, Zee! (SCREAMING) Ow, ow, ow. (CHUCKLING) Today will be better, Zee. (SIGHING) Oh! I just know it! Good morning! Here's your dress. (SCREAMS) My dress? The king has asked me to invite you to the Annual Crystal Ball. Crystal Ball? What's that? Just the biggest social event of the year. Everyone comes to the palace to celebrate! That's perfect. I'll win over the citizens of Shimmervale and the king will see that we can all get along. Do you know where I can find the king? I want to thank him for the invitation. (IMITATING AIRPLANE ENGINE) (IMITATING GUN FIRING) Now where is my third flying battalion? (CHITTERING) Ah, yes. Thank you. When you're responsible for the kingdom, Catania, it will be important that you position your guards at all the strategic locations from which an enemy could attack. Oh, yes. Mmm-hmm. Your Majesty! Oh, Mariposa. Your Highness, thank you for the invitation. I'm very honored. I wanted to know if you want me to, well, address your subjects at the ball. I bring greetings from Queen Marabella, and I could simply say that everyone in Flutterfield sends their good wishes. (IMITATING GUNFIRE) (CHITTERING) (GROWLING) Let's see how it goes at the ball, Mariposa, and perhaps you can address the people. Thank you, Your Majesty. (YELPS) (WHIMPERING) (LAUGHING EVILLY) (GROWLING) (ZEE SCREAMS) Zee! No! Oh, no! (RUMBLING) Now, look at what you've done! I'm so sorry. Here, let me help you pick those up. (GRUNTING) Honestly, I'm not even sure why I agreed to this arrangement. Father, it was an accident. And those wings! They're a menace! Can't you do anything about them? Do anything? Um, I guess I... Better. Keep them that way. (SIGHS) I'm sorry. It's just he... Hmm. I'll talk to him. Father! Keep them this way? (GROANING) Ow. That could be difficult. (SIGHS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (GWYLLION LAUGHING EVILLY) You wanted to see me, Your Majesty? Oh, yes. (CLEARS THROAT) I want you to stay close to Mariposa at the ball, Talayla. It's our most important celebration and I don't want anything to go wrong. Yes, Sire. (GWYLLION LAUGHING) You see, Boris? Patience is a virtue. Everyone in Shimmervale, all in one place. Sharpen your talons, my friend. We go tonight. Oh, I'm a-sharpenin'. I'm a-sharpenin'. (BOTH LAUGHING) (CREAKING) (SCREAMING) (BABBLING) Sorry. (SIGHS) (SIGHING) Oh! Wow! Ooh! (LAUGHING) Did I get it right? You did this? You worked so hard to learn about us, the least we could do is return the favor. (CHITTERING) Hmm. (CHITTERING DISAPPOINTEDLY) Is it anything like home? It's perfect. I've actually been reading up on Flutterfield since I found out you were coming. You have? I love to read. Sometimes I feel like I never want to leave the palace. I'm perfectly happy spending whole days lost in books. Me too! (GIGGLING) I've noticed. It's why I think you'll like this. Wow! Catania! You did this? Well, I had some help. (CHITTERING PROUDLY) (CHUCKLES) (GASPS) This is incredible! Oh! I can't believe it. Have you read this, Flight of Fancy? It's one of my all-time favorites! (GASPS) Mine too! Grab it. I want to show you something. (WHISTLING) (NEIGHING) (CHUCKLES) It's okay, Sylvie. We can trust Mariposa. (SNORTS) Follow us! (NEIGHING) This is my favorite place to read. Wow. It's beautiful. (LAUGHING) Come on up! Isn't that a Crystallite? Only the most important one in all the land. Come on! This is the Heartstone, isn't it? It's the most powerful Crystallite we have. I feel safe when I'm near it. Like nothing can harm me. Harm you? Who would want to harm you? Um, it must be hard being away from Flutterfield. Do you miss it? A little, but I'm really enjoying getting to explore Shimmervale. I can't wait to see GlowWater Falls again. I... I haven't been there in years. You're kidding. Years? Since I was eight. Why not? I don't know. Let's go now. (NEIGHING) Now? You just said you haven't been there in years. Don't you miss it? A lot. But the Crystal Ball is this afternoon. We need time to get ready. We'll be quick. We'll be back in two wingflaps. (BOTH CHITTERING) Okay, just for a little bit. (NEIGHING) I understand, Sylvie. But you'll be right there with me. (SNORTS) (NEIGHING) (BOTH CHEERING) (CHITTERING PLAYFULLY) MARIPOSA: Wow. You think this is amazing? Follow me. (GASPING) I didn't think getting closer could possibly make it any more amazing but... (INHALES) It did! Ooh! Have you ever skipped Rainbow Rocks? (GIGGLING) How would I have ever skipped Rainbow Rocks? (MUSICAL NOTES PLAYING) Whoa. (CHITTERS) Oh! You try. (MUSICAL NOTES PLAYING) Whoo-hoo! (BOTH CHUCKLING) You're a natural! (MUSICAL NOTES PLAYING) (MUSICAL NOTES PLAYING) (BOTH LAUGHING) (BOTH CHITTERING PLAYFULLY) (SIGHS) I've missed this place. Why has it been so long? Does it have anything to do with why you don't fly? (SYLVIE NEIGHING) It's okay, you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. No, I do want to. I was eight years old. (LAUGHING) CATANIA: My father and I were having a picnic when we saw something down below. It was an old woman. She wasn't from Shimmervale, but she was poking around the Crystallites. (GRUNTING ANGRILY) My father confronted her. She asked for a Crystallite. I knew what my father would say. He told me all the time. "Our responsibility is to the Crystal Fairies. "If we let other creatures have Crystallites, "we could end up without enough for our own subjects. " So your father said no. Mmm-hmm. What did the old woman do? Well... You dare deny the Gwyllion? (STRAINING) I can't move! You had your chance. Now you owe me all your Crystallites. CATANIA: Daddy! Catania, go back! (LAUGHING) Even more precious to you. (GASPS) (LAUGHING EVILLY) (GASPS) (GRUNTS) (LAUGHING) (CATANIA STRAINING) Say goodbye to your little one. (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) (GROWLING) Madam? Uh, Mistress? Uh, Gwyllion? Look out! Gah! My spell was too weak. Get him! I'm a-gettin' him. I'm a-gettin' him. (SHOUTING) (GRUNTS) (BOTH GRUNTING) Hey, watch your hands, would ya? BORIS: Oh! Let me go! You're mine now! Not if I can help it! (STRAINING) Get off of me! Give me back my daughter! No! (GRUNTS) (GROANS) (GASPS) My staff! Take her! (CATANIA SCREAMS) Daddy! (GROANS) Catania! (WHIMPERING) Got it! (LAUGHING) (GRUNTS) You treat me with such disrespect? You will regret this! Yeah! You mess with us, we'll mess with you, eh? Ah, hey! Wait up! Gwyllion! CATANIA: Both my wings were broken. They healed, but I haven't flown since. What happened to the Gwyllion? She never came back. Are you worried she will? My father worries about it a lot. It's the real reason he allowed you to come. He wants advice on fighting the Gwyllion. But he could have just asked Queen Marabella. I'm sure she would have... No. He doesn't trust Butterfly Fairies enough for that. Do you? Yes. I want you to have this. Catania, I... I can't. With our history, no Butterfly Fairy should ever take a Crystallite from Shimmervale. You're not taking it. It's a gift. Oh! Thank you. I have something for you too. It's so pretty! It's a Flutter Flower. I thought I needed it to remind me of home. Maybe after I leave, it can remind you of me. Oh! Thank you. Huh? (CHITTERING CURIOUSLY) Whoa! Whoa! (NEIGHING) (GASPS) The Crystal Ball! We need to go get ready! Whoo-hoo! (CHIRPING CELEBRATORY TUNE) (SIGHS) (WILLA EXHALING) My wings feel like they've been flapping for days. Oh, it's been a long week. But I think we did it. Mmm. I think you're right. Mariposa's gonna be so impressed. This wasn't so hard. Now, how did the reading to the elderly go? I was just gonna ask you the same thing. Oh, no! Oh, no! (CRASHING) (BOTH GROANING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Uh, come in. (GASPS) Oh, no! What's wrong? I came to get you for the ball, and you're not even ready! Sure I am. But, but... You're not beshimmered! Hmm? (WHISTLES) (SNEEZING) ALL: Tsk, tsk, tsk. Mmm-mmm-mmm! (ALL CHIRPING) Ooh! (ALL CHIRPING HAPPILY) (GIGGLING) We do this in Flutterfield too, only we call it befluttering! ALL: Bye. Thank you. What do you think? Whoa! (SCREAMS) I'll work on it on the way to the Crystal Ball. (BALLROOM MUSIC PLAYING) (CHITTERING) (MUSIC VOLUME INCREASES) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (INHALES) Wow. Ooh! (CHUCKLES) Uh-oh. (GASPS) Oh, no! How can you enjoy the ball if you can't fly? CATANIA: I know how. Your wings! If you have to fold down your wings, I will too. (GIGGLING) What do you think? Beautiful. Thank you. My pleasure, Your Ambassadoress. Oops! (GIGGLING) Still working on that. (LAUGHS) (SYLVIE NEIGHING) MARIPOSA: Just an intimate gathering with a couple of close friends? I told you. Everyone comes to the Crystal Ball. (CHUCKLES) I'd be surprised if anyone isn't here. What is it? Mmm, nothing. It's just, I always loved dancing, until... So, we'll dance! But I don't... Take us down please, Sylvie! (NEIGHING) (SINGING) Oh! Wow! Caramel toffee dumpling? (CHITTERING ENTHUSIASTICALLY) (GROWLING) Huh? (CHITTERING INQUISITIVELY) (MUFFLED CHITTERING) (SPITTING) ALL: Ew! (CHITTERING AFFIRMATIVELY) (BOTH GIGGLE) (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Let's dance! But we're the only ones down here. What if everyone stares? What if they do? Come on, it's fun! (LAUGHING) You're right, this is fun! Told you! Huh? (GIGGLING) (ALL GIGGLING) WOMAN: Oh! Look at that. What are they doing? (ALL MURMURING) (ALL CHEERING) (GASPS) Whoa! Oh, no. (GIGGLING) It's fine. Now I know how it feels. (GASPS) That Butterfly Fairy has a Crystallite! (ALL GASPING) She must have stolen it! What? No! I knew we couldn't trust them! Look out for her fire breath! (ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) Enough! (WHIMPERS) Mariposa, you stole a Crystallite, after we welcomed you. And trusted you. No, Your Highness. I gave it to her! We were at GlowWater Falls earlier and... You went to GlowWater Falls unprotected? I know. But Mariposa and I... She's a Butterfly Fairy, and in no position to know what's best for a Crystal Fairy Princess! We weren't doing anything wrong. I understand why you're so protective, but... You know nothing! You don't know what it's like to be responsible for a kingdom. You don't know how to protect us, so we have to protect ourselves. Leave! Immediately! Leave? The ballroom? Leave Shimmervale! And never come back! Father! Not now, Catania. As you wish, Your Majesty. (WHIMPERING) (WHIMPERS) But Father, I gave it to her! Even more reason to separate you from an obviously bad influence. Ugh. (NEIGHING) It's all right, people. The Butterfly Fairy threat is over. Smile! Dance! Enjoy! (ALL MURMURING) (BALLROOM MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHS) (SIGHS) I don't know what's worse. That I failed, or that I have to go home and admit it to people who believed in me. (WIND WHOOSHING) What is that? I thought everyone was already at the ball? (CHITTERING) (YELPS) We can't just go. What if it's dangerous? What if... (MARIPOSA GASPS) What if it's the Gwyllion? (CHITTERING APPREHENSIVELY) (CHITTERING) Zee! (CHITTERING IN PROTEST) I know the king told us to leave, but we have to warn them. Uh-uh. Zee! We have to help the Crystal Fairies. They're our friends. (CHITTERING IN PROTEST) Catania's our friend. And Sylvie. Are you going to tell me that Anu isn't a friend? (CHITTERING HESITANTLY) If the king and the other Crystal Fairies aren't our friends now, well, I'm going to be a friend when they need one most. (MOANING) Shimmervale, your day of reckoning has finally come. Whoa! You're so wicked! (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING EVILLY) (GASPS) Ahh. Well, look what we have here, Boris. Oh, so shiny. (LAUGHS EVILLY) Not for long! (LAUGHING EVILLY) (BALLROOM MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHS) Ugh! I don't understand? He's the one who doesn't understand, Anu. (CHITTERING IN AGREEMENT) (GASPS) No. It can't be! (GASPS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) What? Oh, no. MARIPOSA: Catania! Mariposa? I think it's the Gwyllion! She's putting out all the Crystallites! (GASPS) If she turns all the Crystallites to rock, Shimmervale will freeze! (ALL GASPING) (ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (STRAINING) (GASPS) Father! No! (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING EVILLY) Gwyllion! One Crystallite! That's all it would have taken. Stop, Gwyllion! Have mercy on us! Yes, I will show you the same mercy you showed me. (LAUGHS EVILLY) (PANICKED CHATTERING) Now witness as I destroy your most precious stone of all! (GASPS) The Heartstone! Huh? (CHITTERING IN SURPRISE) The Heartstone is like a candle, if we keep it lit, we can re-light all the other Crystallites. (LAUGHING EVILLY) (GASPS) The Gwyllion! (WHIMPERS) She's going to get to it first! What do we do now? We do what your father did. We find a way to break her magic staff. But how do we... (SCREAMS) You guys are lousy hiders, eh? (SHOUTING) (SCREAMING) Catania! (NEIGHING) (SCREAMING) (PANTING) (GRUNTS) BORIS: You're not gonna get away from me this time, Princess! We have to do something. Oh, yeah! Oh! (NEIGHING) Shimmervale, for your selfishness I leave you with nothing! (LAUGHING EVILLY) (BORIS SCREAMING) (NEIGHING) (GASPS) (BORIS GRUNTING) (CATANIA PANTING) (NEIGHING) (GASPS) (CLANGING) (NEIGHING) Sylvie! Whoa! (SCREAMING) (NEIGHING) Oh, yeah, right? (LAUGHS) Yeah! (GROANS) What? Hey! (BOTH LAUGHING) (GRUNTING) What? (SCREAMING) (GROANING) (MUFFLED STRAINING) Are you all right? I am, but Sylvie's wing is hurt. She'll be okay, she just can't fly. (GWYLLION LAUGHING EVILLY) Oh, no! Catania? Fly with me. I can't. I don't fly. And it's the Gwyllion. You can do this, Catania. Be brave. I'm not brave. I'm scared. I can't. Stay here. (CHITTERING INQUISITIVELY) Of course. Go. Thank you. (LAUGHS EVILLY) I can feel it! Not too much longer. Gwyllion! Stop! (STRAINING) (GRUNTS) (GASPS) Boris! Get her! (GRUNTS) (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING EVILLY) (BOTH SHOUTING) Boris, get them! (GRUNTING) (BOTH SQUEAK) Nice try, puffballs! Yeah, you better run! Ha! (BOTH SCREAMING) (LAUGHS EVILLY) Well done, Boris. (LAUGHING EVILLY) No! (GRUNTS) (GASPS) Mariposa! No! (NEIGHING) Huh? (STRAINING) No more interruptions! It's happening! It's happening! (LAUGHS EVILLY) No! Catania! (BOTH STRAINING) You won't stop me this time, little one. (SCREAMING) Boris, help me! (GASPS) (SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) (SCREAMING) (ALL MURMURING) (BOTH SCREAMING) (BOTH GROANING) You made it! Not fast enough. It's too late. Look! (SHUDDERING) It's so cold. Catania, look! (CATANIA GASPS) The Flutter Flower. (GASPS) Hmm, I wonder. Huh? Huh? I thought maybe... (GASPS) Keep holding it close to the Heartstone! (STRAINING) It's working! (CHITTERING EXCITEDLY) (GASPS) The other Crystallites! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! (BOTH GIGGLING) Whoa! Whoa! Your wings. Your wings. Ooh! Ooh! (BOTH CHITTERING) (BOTH GIGGLING) (CHITTERING) CATANIA: Father! Catania! You're flying! And your wings, they're beautiful! (GIGGLES) Thank you. I'm so, so proud of you. And you, Mariposa, I owe you an apology. I misjudged you. I was wrong. BORIS: Mistress, come on! Get up, eh? We still got a chance! You can do this! (GROANING) My staff! Where's my staff? It's gone, Gwyllion. Just like you'll be when I'm done with you. REGELLIUS: Any last words? Father, no! You mustn't harm her. What? Remember why all this happened. The Gwyllion asked us for one Crystallite. One. And we have so many, but we said no. And that gives her the right to destroy us? No, not at all. But destroying her isn't right either. What do you suggest we do? What we should have done in the first place. (CHITTERING INQUISITIVELY) She's being a friend, and maybe making one too. I'm giving you your freedom, and a chance to start over. I know that's not always easy, so maybe this will help. You... You're giving me a Crystallite? After everything I did? I'm righting a wrong. I... I don't know what to say. Oh! Oh! Thank you. I hope I can live up to your faith in me. You're kidding me, right? Come on, we had 'em! You changed. You used to be cool. (LAUGHING) Come, my pet. We have much to think about. (GRUNTS IN DISGUST) Hey, if you don't want your shiny things any more, can I have 'em? You may be a child, but in some ways you're wiser than I'll ever be. Thank you, Father. BOTH: Aww! (SNIFFLING) I would like to repay your kindness. Thank you, Your Majesty. Hmm. There is one thing you can do for me. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) (CHITTERING) (CHITTERING HAPPILY) (CLEARS THROAT) (CHITTERING) Mmm-hmm. (GIGGLING) Mother, this is King Regellius of Shimmervale. King Regellius, my mother, Queen Marabella of Flutterfield. Your Highness. I mean, "Hey!" (CHUCKLING) Uh, hey? It's an honor to meet you, Your Highness. You're not concerned about my fire breath? (CHUCKLES) Your Majesty, I am ashamed that I ever thought... Our myths about you were just as silly. But it's all in the past now. It's a privilege to have you here. And I wanted to give you this. An offering of peace and goodwill. (GASPS) Is that a Crystallite? It's even more beautiful than Mariposa described. Thank you. You're welcome. May I have this dance? Why, yes, I'd love to. (HUMMING) (BOTH CHUCKLING) WILLA: No way! Watch! Ready? Ready. (GRUNTS IN SURPRISE) (ALL GIGGLING) Seriously? You knocked the king's crown off his head with your wing? (CHUCKLES) Whoa! Well, it was an accident! I've never seen his face that red. I have. But not since I accidentally put lava sauce in his fluffle muffins. ALL: Ew! I'll never live that down. (GIGGLES) I almost forgot. How'd everything go at the Royal Library? Not much trouble, I hope? Um... Are you kidding? (CHUCKLES) It was a breeze. No trouble at all. Hey! There's that awful tour guide. We want our money back. Uh-oh. I have to, uh, freshen up. WOMAN: Hey! Come back here! (CHUCKLES) I just wanted to tell you again how impressed I am by everything you accomplished. Thank you, Carlos. I couldn't have done it without the Flutter Flower. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Care to dance? I'd love to. (BOTH CHEERING) See. What did I tell ya? Made for each other. (CLEARS THROAT) Well, I can see clearly that my ideas of the Crystal Fairies were farfetched indeed! You are in no way vicious or vile. Why thank you, Lord Gastrous. Boo! (SHOUTS) (ALL GIGGLE) Hmm. Right. Oh, I love this song. Do you dance? I do now. Then come on! You want to get your groove on to this, Lord Gastrous? What? No. I, uh, never... (SCREAMS) (BOTH LAUGHING) (BOTH CHITTERING HAPPILY) (SMOOCHES) Oh!
