Jimmy Hopper, please come to the principal's office. Jimmy Hopper. Girl, don't be leaving your bag on the floor. It's like giving it to charity. - Hi, I'm Charity. - I'm Megan. - Are you a dancer? - I used to be. Yeah, me, too. Until I had my baby. Get busy! Go, Charity! Get busy! Go, Charity! Get busy! Go, Charity! Get busy! Go, Charity! Get busy! Go, Charity! Go! Go! Go! Oh, my God! You bring your baby to school with you? Hell, yeah! I am a good mother, okay? You can't just be leaving your baby with anybody. These nannies be beating on your children like LAPD. I keep him with me because that way I know that he is safe and sound. You know what I'm talking about? You can't just be leaving your kid with anybody. These people out here be crazy, neglecting their children. Okay. All right, boo boo, you remember to breathe through the vents... ...and Mommy loves you, punkin! - Hey, Jack. - Hey, Tracy. I was wondering if you have a dance partner for the senior showcase... 'cause I was thinking we could be partners. There's this really romantic scene in Romeo and Juliet. That's great. I've always wanted to play that part. You'll be a great Romeo. I'm not talking about Romeo. You're so funny. "Delighted that he was fat Delighted that he was old... "No doubt in the world about that Delighted that he had gold" How now, brown cow. Scene. An actor prepares. Acting, people... ...is action and reaction. - Oh, shit! - Yes, son, yes! Yes, that is truth! - You don't know me. - I see murder in your eyes. Yes, that's good, son. You need an agent. You are excellent. Now, what will you do to act? What are you willing to sacrifice... ...for your art, son? Yes? Are you willing to die for it? Are you willing to cry for it? Are you willing to lose your manhood for it? No? You, get out of my class, get out of my class! You call yourself an actor? Get out! Damn it, I gave up my manhood... ...twice. Yes, it hurt. I bled. But I got five weeks' work on a non-union student film. Now, class, there are 50,000 people who have the audacity... ...to call themselves actors. - Yeah, like Jessica Simpson. - Yes, like Jessica Simpson. Did any of you guys see Employee of the Month? Refund, please! That Dane Cook makes me do this. Well, I kind of like that movie. I thought she did a really good job. I saw it four times. Yeah, I guess I'd rather see her act than... ...ruin the Cowboys' chances of ever winning the Super Bowl. It seems as though we have a debate going on here. How about those mom jeans? Irregardless of what you may think of Miss Simpson, she is a success story. Of the 50,000 people that call themselves actors... ...there's only 500 working actors. Of that 500, most of them are white. There are a few roles for black people... ...but those roles are usually for the Wayans brothers. We must all, in our lives and in our craft, have one thing. Dignity. Yes, dignity. Well, I remember one time, they offered me a role... ...in a despicable, disgusting, stereotypical racist movie. Do you know what I told them? - Yes, Miss White? - You turned it down. Hell, no! I took that money! But I did it with dignity. Let us watch. Boy, you ain't picking that cotton fast enough. Massa, no! I be's the best cotton-picking picaninny this side of Jubilee. Yes, sir, I's a cotton-picking fool! They call me Lightning Jack. - See, I just love picking me some cotton. - Boy, you lie talking me? Massa, I's be here forever. I cuts my own foot off, sir, to show my love to you. I love me some massa. No, Massa. No! Integrity. Attention, ladies! Everybody take your place. I am your dance instructor... Ms. Camelto. Now, I'm sure most of you have heard... ...that I have a huge count... Excuse me, country music collection... ...but that's irrelevant. I have one interest here today... ...and that one interest is dance. I wanna see you dance and I wanna see you smile. Understood? I barely saw you there. You look like a needle. You look like a gutted worm. You look like the number 11. What are you, Mary-Kate or Ashley? I've inserted tampons bigger than you! I don't teach by the pound. You, shave it! What do you think this is, Busch Gardens? Trim it! Flatten it. Look who freed Willy! Whale spotting! Grecian tanker! You've got more chins than a Chinese phone book. How about some butter for those rolls? We do the mashed potato here, we don't eat the mashed potato. Please. You gonna keep the baby? I hope so. And what's your situation? Did you grow up next to a nuclear power plant? You look like you were yanked through a closed door. You know, you're never gonna make it as a dancer, Sister Sledge. If I were you, I'd kill myself. My life is over! - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! It was a metaphor! Girls, if you wanna have a successful senior showcase... ...you're gonna have to step it up. Nora, show them how it's done. Be a tree. A cloud. An earthworm. An acorn. - Wow, she's amazing. - A pair of lips. That's Nora, she's a triple threat. - She acts, sings, and dances. - You're a cup of coffee. She's won every competition out there. Excellent, Nora, excellent! Perfect, perfect, perfect. Brilliant, A-plus! Now, for the rest of you cows... I want you to follow me over here to the balance beam. All right, that's good, Jack, that's good. Now, take it to the right. Take it to the right. Now the left, come on! All right, now bring it up the middle. Let's go, come on. Jeez, give me that. You have got to take your ball and drive it hard into your opponent! And I mean drive it long and hard. Let's go again. - Dad, can I ask you a question? - Yeah, shoot. Did you ever wanna try something new... ...but were afraid of what your friends might think? What, like bonking a hooker? Nothing wrong with that. Your first time should be special. No, that's not what I mean. Did you ever wanna try something other than basketball? Like having a strong man pin you down? His hot breath breathing down your neck as you struggle to the ground... I know what you're getting at. If you wanna join the wrestling team, you have my full support. Now, remember, we got basketball practice this afternoon, huh? Lady-killer. Excuse me! This is the dancers' table, and from what I understand, you no longer dance. - Damn, Nora, you are so mean. - Not mean. Just real. Come on. Don't worry about Nora. She is all bark and no bite. Besides, those are the rich bitches... ...and you don't wanna sit with them anyway. Now, this is us, right over here. Holla, holla, holla, holla! Now, these are my roll dogs. This is Uglisha and what's her name. - Hey, girl! - Hey, girl! Wait, you don't know her name? I thought they were your friends. No, no, girl. I didn't say they were my friends.

I don't mean to offend you... Oh, girl, I'm just messing with you! She got you, girl. She got you good. Yeah, she's like, "I'm surrounded by black girls. Backpedal, backpedal.

What do you wanna be? I wanna be a doctor. I bet you wanna work with kids, don't you? - No, vaginas. - What? I wanna be a vaginacologist. They're all I think about. Big ones, small ones, the cute ones with the little Hitler mustaches on them. Or how about the ones that are fat like Jay-Z's lips? But I gotta get into college first, so... But what about you? What does your mom think about you dancing hip-hop? My mom's dead. Well, how come you never talk about her? What am I supposed to do? Run around the school yelling about it? If it helps. My mom's dead! She's dead! My mom's dead! This book is so good. - You like Thomas, don't you? - No. Well, he's okay, I guess. He does have a nice smile, beautiful skin and luscious lips. But I love his big, fat... Hey, hey, hey, girl! That is my brother. What? I was just gonna say "butt. " Well, you should see his... Girl, I wonder who that could be. I hate when people come by unannounced. So tacky. What do you want? You know what I want, Charity. I'm here to pick up my son. Hey, son. All right, I'm out. I'll be back next week to pick him up again. He's such a good father. Yes! I got in! What is it? What's happened? - Dr. Thomas Anderson! - Let me see. Hold on. "You and everyone else that applied have been accepted... "to Just Community College. " Just Community College? Just Community College! That's great. You got in! Congratulations! That's great! Megan, tonight I'm taking you out to celebrate. - Don't look. - Okay. - Stairs, there's stairs. - Where? - Right now. - Okay. - I'm so excited. - I'm glad. - Are you looking? - No, I'm not looking. - All right. Are you ready? - Yes. Surprise! I'm sorry. I can't go in there. What do you mean you can't go in there? - This is where I'm taking you. - No. Come on. It's opening night. You're going. She risked her life... What a sacrifice... Smashed by a truck Last words were, "What the fuck?" Momma's gone, momma's gone... No more can you see her face... Or hear her voice on the phone... Your momma's dead, momma's dead And she's never coming back... Your momma's dead, momma's dead That's right, she's never coming back... You can wish... She's never, never coming back... You can cry... She's never, she's never coming back... Now go kill yourself... That's right, she's never coming back... Mom! Encore! Encore! - I thought you would've liked it. - I did. You wasn't acting like you did. Wasn't even being loud. I didn't hear you heckle once. I'm sorry. I don't want you to think I didn't have a good time tonight, Thomas... ...but dancing isn't a part of my life anymore. Why not? You just woke up one day and decided to waste your talent? How do you know I have talent? 'Cause I danced at the club? Because I saw the look on your face when you did it, Megan. It's the same look you had tonight. It's the same exact look that you had... It's the same... Mother... Guys, can you quiet down here, please? Can I talk to the girl? Low self-esteem? Vulnerable? Thank you. - Like I was saying... - Yeah. I saw the look on your face when you did it. It's the same look you had tonight. Goofy, happy, pale with freckles. So, if you're gonna tell me something about not dancing... ...then tell me something real. Maybe I don't want it to be real. What I want is to wake up and see my mom. For things to go back to the way they were when life made sense. And it's all my fault. She got scraped off the highway for me. For my damn audition. - She was rushing, it was raining. I... - Wait, it was raining? Well, yeah, but she promised she would be there. I made her promise. Damn! So, it was raining and you still made her promise? - Yeah, and then I didn't wait for her. - That's messed up! So, even if she didn't die, she still would've been late? I know I should've waited for her, but they called my name and... And then I didn't say anything. So she would've got there and been stuck outside. That's what you're saying? Well, technically, yeah, but they called me. You didn't put your mother's name on the list? Are you kidding me? Well, I had to go over my dance moves, so I didn't have time to! You didn't have time for your own mother? The person who gave birth to you. You didn't have time for her? - No, I... No, I... - Okay. No, I see what kind of party? This is. Cry me a river. All she wanted was for me to dance. No. All she wanted was to live. Not that she didn't support your dream. It's just, the point is you killed your mother. And she's never coming back. She's dead because of you! God hates you, okay? So, you not dancing doesn't make any damn sense at all. I know! But she... I just don't think I could do it without her. Do you want this? I mean, do you really wanna go to Juilliard? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Well, then, it's on you to make your dream come true. Oh, shit, black girls. So what you're gonna wanna do is make that left, go up three blocks... - I don't know you, and... - What are you... - Thomas, what are you talking about? - Sistahs! Yeah! - So this is where you live? - Yep, this is it. Oh, my God! This is my dad's music room. He's actually pretty good, if you like the buckets. I don't. He's working tonight, so he's gonna be gone all night. So that means we could probably play the TV as loud as we want. Yeah! There's a Blue's Clues marathon! It's not working. Well, I was thinking more like... Make hotdogs? Not exactly. Okay. More like... Ice cream. Who has two thumbs and wants ice cream? This guy. No. Charades. I like charades. - All right, I'm good at this. - Yes! Yoga. You're doing yoga. - Leap frog. Okay. You're riding a pony. - Yeah, yeah, yes, yeah! No, Thomas! Have sex! Why didn't you say something? Well, I'm a little shy. Yo. Sugar Bear wants to see you. Who's that scary-looking guy? Who, him? That's nobody. - Just an old friend, you know. - Okay. - We should all get together sometime. - Yeah, great. I'm just gonna go hang out. Do some cardio. Read. - Well, have fun. - I will. I really... Hey, yo, Thomas, they caught us, fam. I don't know how they found you, though. - I gotta go. - Okay. So, I'm gonna give you a call around 9:11? That's a little late, but that's okay. And I also got us some Police concert tickets. Oh, my God, I love the Police! I'm so excited! There's a COPS marathon. COPS. Love it, right? - Okay, I'll TiVo it. - Okay. Bye. Bye! You ain't got my dough yet? You know how much bread, how much cheddar... ...how much cake that is? I want my chips! Don't worry, man, we gonna have your money for you, Sug. - When? - Soon as possible, fam. Well, that ain't good enough. There's a dance battle coming up, and I suggest you win. - What if we lose? - No! No! No! And I am telling you... My belly's growling... I like glazed ham, pig feet and toes... The Biggest Loser, I say no... Give me mo, mo, mo, mo steaks... Chicken and ribs, too... I'm not living without food... I don't wanna be no Nicole Richie... Chips by the mountain Soda pop from the spout... You can say what you wanna I'm not working out... Fry me some chicken, strike up the grill... 'Cause you're gonna feed me... That's right, you will, yes... I am smelling food... I'm so hungry... Smucker's is the best jam I've ever known... And you, and you, and you... You're gonna feed me... Feed me... Feed... Me... Be aggressive, guys! Let's score! Excuse me! Come on, let's get that basket! Why do they call you nappy? I don't understand it. Why don't you "D" up on her? You know, maybe if you weren't so tired from having sex with Thomas... ...maybe you could guard her. How do you know I had sex with Thomas? Who's the ho now? - Give that back! - No! You are going down, Twiggy! You bow-legged bitch! Break it up! Break it up! Get off of her! What are you doing? I am not gonna have two nubile, sweaty teens fighting like that... ...making me moist in my own gym! Do you understand? If you've got a beef to settle, we're gonna settle it my way. Got it? Oh, yeah! That's what I'm talking about! - Get her! - Come on! Get that ass! - Grab it! - You want some of this? I'm gonna make it rain on these hoes! Yeah! Show me what you got! Let me see some ass! What is wrong with you guys? Do you know what's at stake here? We're talking state championships! Hey! Stand up, Weiner! You're not looking polished, Knob! You gotta play hard, Cockran! Headd! You gotta give me some! Don't you guys wanna know what it feels like to be winners? To be 10 men, holding each other after a big victory? Standing naked in the showers... ...screaming at the top of your lungs, foam flying? Yes! Yes! Yes! Now, that is the spirit, son! Now, the rest of you, get your head in the game! Let's go! So, how did he catch it? Probably one of them kids at school. You know kids. I told him to wear a condom, but does he listen to me? No. Just like his damn daddy. Now you sit there and let it itch. So, I heard about the fight. Yeah. It was all Nora's fault. It was all Nora's fault? You didn't have anything to do with it? No! She's just jealous of me and Thomas. Well, what do you expect? It is hard out there for a white girl. It used to be that y'all just show up and bat your eyes... ...and the brothers would come running. But now, the competition is fierce. You see, girl, first it was J. Lo with Puffy. She opened the door for every Latina this side of the border. Then it was Kimora Lee Simmons leading a dojo ofAsian bitches. And now, we got Kim Kardashian... ...and her big, Armenian ass pulling brothers right and left. So, what is a rich white girl supposed to do? The last thing she needs is you coming in here with your blonde hair... ...your perky breasts, and a little bit of rhythm... ...taking the last sellout brother left. You think that Nora is the only oppressed white girl? Well, I'll have you know, I have paid my dues. Excuse me, miss? Have you been drinking? - Nope. - Ma'am, step out of the car. The damage isn't that bad. Ma'am, I'm gonna have to have you blow into this tube. Ma'am, I meant this tube. It's a lot bigger. Ma'am, I'm gonna have to take you in. Time's up, Miss White. You're free to go. Hope you learned your lesson. What took you so long? Your flashback was longer than your time in County... ...and that don't make you one of us. I thought we were friends. What do you mean, we're not gonna pay Sugar Bear back his money? 'Cause I'm tired of Sugar Bear always trying to punk us, B. What type of self-respecting thug pays back a debt? So, what are you gonna do when he comes after us? He ain't coming after us. We gonna get him first. - Meet me under the bridge tonight, 8:00. - No. - Bitch. - Okay. There's something I need to tell you. You're pregnant? Oh, no. What? No, Thomas, I'm not pregnant. Good, 'cause with your big head and my ears, God only knows. No, I'm performing at the senior showcase... ...and then, who knows, maybe Juilliard. That's great! And I was kind of thinking, you know... ...maybe we should just kind of cool it for a while. What do you mean? I'm saying I think we need to take a break. Break, definitely, yeah, we should definitely take a break. How long you need, like, We actually should synchronize our watches... - So we can meet up... - No, Thomas. I need space. Okay. Space. Space is good. That's enough space? Thomas, we're done. Definitely. This has been a long rehearsal, very tough. Thomas, I'm leaving you! I don't wanna be your girlfriend anymore! We spend more time defending our relationship... ...than actually having one! Nobody wants to see us together. Not my friends and not yours. I'm saying it's over. Fine. - Fine, leave! Get out! - Sorry! I'm sorry! God has put you in my path and I aim to keep you! I'm making steaks for dinner and I expect you to stay. Megan! So, here's my number. You just call me. You married? That's sexy. I'll talk to you later. Oh, shit. - Hey. - Hey. Can we talk? Can we talk, Charity? I just want to let you know, from now on, things are gonna be different. I don't wanna be the kind of father... ...that his kid only sees him on the weekends. That's not the kind of life I want for my son. My son! - You don't even know his name. - It doesn't matter! Maury said it was a 99.9% chance that he is mine! And I'm gonna honor that! Anyway, I want my kid to wake up every morning and see my face. Here, put this in his room. I'm out. Hey, sup, man, I gotta talk to you. - I ain't going with you. - What you mean you not going with me? I mean this shit is dangerous! Of course it's dangerous, it's a drive-by! But we can get the money. All we have to do is battle the 409s at the Streets tonight... ...pay Sugar Bear back, and we're good. Nigger, did you wear a pink shirt to a drive-by? It brings out my eyes. Look, if you walk away from this, I'll walk away with you. Walk away from what? I'm not you, Thomas. I can't go to Just Community College like you... ...be a doctor, operating on people and shit. Yes, you can, man! If I can do it, you can do it! Not with these hands! I got guns for hands! They call me Edward Triggerhands, fam. For me, it's all about respect. A- Con... Are you wearing the elastic I asked you to wear? Keep your chins up. You're never gonna be a Nora. Have a good show. Yes, this is she. Hey, Charity. Where's Thomas? The last time I heard, he and A-Con went after Sugar Bear. - What? - Yeah, well, they owe him $5,000 ...and they can't come up with the money. There has to be another way. Well, if he had a crew, he could've battled at the Streets... ...and possibly won the money back, but where we gonna find a crew? Hey, guys! Thomas is in trouble and he needs our help. There's a battle at the Streets tonight and he needs a crew. So, what are you saying? You want to start a crew? Yeah! And who's gonna be in this "crew?" Well, maybe you don't wanna step out of your perfect world... ...but there's a lot going on under the radar at Musical High. Take sweet little Tracy, for example. She has really bad hair. Tyler has a horrible smile! And what about you, Nora? I mean, everybody knows that you're the best dancer in school. Let's do this! What about the showcase? The 409 Crew coming up, y'all! It's that time, y'all. Now, I believe that our distinguished panel of random extras... ...have made their decision. May I have the envelope, please? Man. And for all you people at home watching... I am wearing all yellow. This is a tight moment. Tighter than the button on my suit. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner! - The winner is... - Hey, yo, Truck! - What do you want, punk? - Hey, hey. Hey, now. I wanna battle! Me and you, one on one. That's not how it goes. You have to have a crew to battle. - Says who? - It's a written law of the Streets. Says it right there. "No dance battling without a crew. " - And you don't have a crew. - Oh, yes, he does. Megan? What are you doing here? Oh, no, this for street dancers only. They're not street dancers. We gonna do it just like we do it on the Streets. Now the baddest man hit my hand. Now you've been challenged. Do you accept? - Let's do this. - All right. Then it's gonna be the 409 Crew versus, what's your name, young man? - Thomas Uncles. - The Uncle Toms! Show your love! Let's go, 409, let's go! Uncle Toms, assemble! We got this. Hey, wait a minute, I thought only the good guys get to go in slow motion? - Hey, yo, Thomas. - A-Con! What's up? Wait, what happened with Sugar Bear? Mr. Stache took care of that, man. We good. Now let's serve these suckers, B. Everybody huddle up. Hold on, man! Yo, how we gonna compete with these guys with these guys? We got this, A-Con. All right, everybody. You just do what you do best, okay? Let's do this! - What's going on? - I don't think I can do this. Remember the routine you used to do at the club? Do that and you'll be great. Okay. I didn't mean that club. That's my girl! What's this? Yeah! Nigger! Did you wear tight ass shorts and skates to a battle? Yeah. So did you. Oh, yeah. And it worked for T.I. In ATL, right? What up, dawg! Wee! Stop weeing! Yeah! What! Yeah! They did their thing tonight! And the judges have made their decision. And the winner is... - A tie? - What? Oh, hell, no! Y'all can't do this to these kids! What y'all want to see? Y'all want to see them battle it out? All right. We gonna do this the Stache way. Each crew gets one move, no rules, and the audience will decide. Let's get it on! Let's go. They got one move left, and we know what that is. Three, four, five, six, seven. - What are they doing? - Stealing our move, man! I'm stealing your shit! Now what? Yo, that's not fair. You stole our move! That's true. But you still got one move left. Sugar Bear? I came here to get my bread, my chips, my cheese. - Here you go. - I'm talking about my money, bitch. Don't get cute. All right, fat boy, let's see what you got. I'm about to get in your ass! Am I still cute? I look like a black Gumby? Uncle Toms! Uncle Toms! Uncle Toms! Uncle Toms! And the crowd has spoken! The winner of this year's Battle of the Streets and $5,000 ...goes to the Uncle Toms! Yeah! Show your love! Now that's a battle right there! That's what I'm talking about! - Good work, guys! - Hey! Hey! That was really wild, what you did out there. Thanks. I couldn't let you go out there and risk your future. Oh, my gosh, Megan! Megan, congratulations, girl! Thanks, Charity. By the way, I brought somebody with me. - Well, now, that certainly was different. - I guess it was. So, you and your entire crew missed the senior showcase for this? Ever since I started hanging out with these guys, I've learned a lesson. Some things are more important than going to college... ...or getting a high-paying job... ...or inventing something that could save the lives of millions. It's something we like to call respect. And you only get it here, in the Streets. Yeah! Well, this might surprise you... ...but I know a little something about the hip-hop. What you know about hip-hop? Well, back in the day, I happened to be one of the best beatboxers around. - Is that right? - Yeah! - Well, why don't you kick a beat then? - All right. That beat is hot. But her lips ain't moving. - Oh, yes, they are. - Yo! We like to party... We don't cause trouble We don't bother nobody... We're just some men that's on the mic... And when we rock upon the mic We rock the mic right... I am a human beatbox... Hold onto me. What's the matter, Thomas? - You think you know me? - Yes. Then you need to see me in the light. Are you afraid? No. I'm not afraid. You should be. - Aren't you even a little scared? - No. More disappointed than anything. You just turned around with glitter on your face. - You don't even have fangs. - Let's dance. - Now you're dancing. - At prom. And next year, at Juilliard. Thomas, why didn't you take me when you had the chance? You don't know what you're saying. You don't really want this. It will change your life. Besides, you know what they say. Once you go black, you never go back? No. You shouldn't do it until you're with the one you'll be with forever. I dream of being with you forever. - So you really want this? - Yes. Give it to me right now. You're gonna live a long and happy life with me. Oh, shit, white guys. So, what you're gonna do is leave the car up front. Here are the keys. It's the one blasting Coldplay. Don't steal anything, okay? Scurry on.
