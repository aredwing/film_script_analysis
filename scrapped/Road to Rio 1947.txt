 

                        Where are we heading for? Wide open spaces where men are men. And the women? No women! That's how we got into this thing. Yike! Head south, boy! It's going to be a cold winter. What do you say we book our act around here? Good idea. No girls anywhere as pretty as the girls in Oklahoma. Pa! Pa! But he sung so pretty. I'll get him if it's the last thing I do. What did he tell you his name was? Frank Sinatra. Hey, Scat? How about playing some dates in Texas? Now you're talking. No girls anywhere as pretty as the girls in Texas. I reckon we lost them, Buck. Yeah, but they're going to be mighty easy to track down. One of them told my little sister his name was Gene Autry. Louisiana! No girls anywhere pretty as the girls... No, you don't! We're going to stay right here and get ourselves a job. Yoo-hoo! I know: " Don't phone us, we'll phone you." Don't race your motor, I booked a date for us. We're going to be eating again. Good news for the mice. No we can quit stealing their cheese. I'm so hungry, my pucker won't puck. My waistline was practically back to normal. Which one? Where we playing? Johnson's Mammoth Carnival. Oh, the seals couldn't make it, huh? What a setup! We sing, we dance, we recite, and then you do your specialty. Oh, I'll blow them out of the joint. Well, this is a little different. This is a novelty act. What kind of novelty? All you have to do is ride a bicycle. What kind of bicycle? Oh, a regulation bicycle. Standard equipment. Oxyacetylene lamp, a new departure coaster breaker. Do I ride it fast? The slower the better. No hands, huh? That's entirely up to you. Well, pack up your bugle. Let's fly from this fleabag. Lucky our laundry came back. This time I'll take the money so some gal won't tear it out of you with tears. No more. Heart of stone, that's me! Come along! What is this? Don't want to wake up the desk clerk. Come along. "We're full of glee My buddy and me We're happy all day through" "You'll always see us Laughing ha! like little boys We're so full of joys" "But that's why we say to you" "We're on our way" "To Apalachicola Bay" Tell me, where's Apalachicola? Clever town, down south. Down south? What are we wearing this long underwear for? Because we're quite a target. "Magnolia trees and possum And a pretty southern gal" "It's better than the orange groves In Cucamonga, Cal" "We're going to stay Along the Apalachicola Bay" "We may stop in Old Cliff Corner For some ham and grits" "Or pass through Tallahassee If the weather permits" "We're on our way" "To Apalachicola, F-L-A" "Way down upon the Swanee" "The Swanee River" Swanee! Oh, that old Swanee! I can't wait to get down there. See my little old mammy with that load of cotton coming up the road. And there's my sweet old pappy. He's always got a load. Oh, and that Confederate moonlight shines down and makes those stills look so swanky. And that Thanksgiving dinner, humph. When they barbecue a Yankee. Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak. "Carry me back" "To old Virginny" Virginny. Ow! The path to the schoolhouse down which I would wind with my little bitty old ball weevil trudging behind. Come along, Ball. Come on. My pa bet on horses that always ran fourth, so Ma rented cabins to the folks from up north. Apalachicola, I hear you calling! Apalachicola! "I'm on my way" "Well, let's go!" "We're on our way to..." "Apalachicola Apalachicola" "Apalachicola Apalachicola" "Apalachicola Apalachicola" "Apalachicola Apalachicola" Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! More? We're killing them. Shall I tap them with an encore? No. It's time now for the topper, your novelty act. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, you fools! Hmm, thank you, you doll. Don't leave the grounds. Here, here. Get dressed! Warm them up. Oh, Mr. Johnson! Our contractual obligation, hmm? I hope your partner does better than the Great Sandar. He'll be in the hospital for at least six months. Yes, well, don't you worry about Barton the Magnificent. He'll give you a good show if it kills him. Hurry, hurry, hurry! You made a good deal, Mr. Johnson. Psst! Does Notre Dame know about this boy? A little insurance. He'll see that your partner doesn't get cold feet. Too late! Shall we, then? What a build. You think Superman will sue? Just as I thought, falsies. Falsies? You kidding? That's real flab. What's this for? I'm going to play a fast chorus of "Dinah" while I'm riding the bike... Oh, no. Just whistle it, kid. My bread! itll be all right, don't worry. Come along. Here we go! Hup! Up here? Yes, sir! Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Where am I going? Why am I climbing? Your bicycle's up there. My...? You want me to ride that thing? Up there in the stratosphere? Who do you think I am? Mr. Jordan? Up that ladder! How did Mount Baldy get into this? Up that ladder! Get yourself an eagle, brother! Wait a minute! What is this? What kind of...? Wait a minute, please! I can't stand altitude. I get dizzy spells. Wait a minute! Not too high, my nose will bleed! Wait! I may hatch this, you know! Take it easy. We're getting 200 bucks for this. See? Well, let me hold it. If anything goes wrong, at least I won't die poor! You can trust me, boy. I'll take care of your dough. You'll take care of it, all right, until some dame comes along. All they have to do is tell you the sad story of their life and you want to give it a happy ending! Steady now, I'm getting ice on my ears! Don't push, we're here. Ladies and gentlemen... I have to go down, I forgot my rosin. Your attention, please! Barton the Magnificent will now perform a sensational... - an aerial feat: The Ride Through Space! What's your problem, honey? I'm in trouble. Big trouble. Oh, there, there. Well, just tell old Scat all about it. Please! I'd like to talk it over a second. Just one second! Please! nerves of steel! Introducing Barton the Magnificent, substituting for Sandar, who, unfortunately broke his leg this afternoon. Just a sec! I'm not getting enough money! Whoa! Whoa! Please! Please! Wait! Wait a minute! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! I did it! I did it! Oh, no, you don't! Just one show! Oh, no! Please, it's windy out there! Please! Don't! Where'd you go? Aaargh! Oh, please! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! You know, this picture could end right here. Scat! Do something, you burglar! Lay your coat down! Help! Hang on, pal. Old Scat will take care of you. Tilt! Hey! Don't let that wagon get away from you, now! Giddap! Whoa! Atta boy! See you at the Derby. You'll be glue if you talk to him. "Queen of Brazil." Ha-ha! No girls anywhere as pretty as the girls in Brazil. Oh! Don't beat their heads in till I get my money back. You can break his legs, but don't tear the tights, they belong to me. Come on, let's find him. Watch your step, folks. Step carefully, please. Watch your step! Snap it up! This is a Texas steer. He's still kicking a little. Hey, where are you going? Put it on the block! Anymore? That's it, matey. Close her up! Okay! Don't go away. I'll be right back. Hot Lips? Psst! Hot Lips? Let me hear from you! Hot Lips? Psst! Well, I'm getting warm. That's ham. Hot Lips! Huh? Huh? Quiet, quiet. You sound like a typewriter. How do you feel? Huh? Like a popsicle. Where are we? I'll get you a spot of tea. Come on. What I need is a blowtorch. You look like an ad for Kool Cigarettes. Come on. So long, fellas. Where are we? What happened? Who was it? Hurry. This is bad for my throat. Oh, oh. Come on, I'm getting cold. What happens now? Everything's all fixed, penguin. Wait till you see the cosy little hideaway I found for us. A lifeboat built for two. All I want to do is curl up in a nice warm stove. Huh? Hey, in here! Come in! Your suits, gentlemen. But just a minute. Where are the other two? Why, I really don't know, sir. I had them when I left. Would you please try to find those suits? We'll be terribly inconvenienced without them. You wouldn't want us to be inconvenienced. Those suits were tailor-made. We're very fond of them. We'd better get them back... Harry! That'll be all, thank you. I'll tell you when to get tough with people. You're working for me, Harry, and I've too much at stake to have it spoiled by your hoodlum tactics. Is that clear? Right, Mrs. Vail. Come with me. I can't find Lucia. Right, now we can see. Yeah, I've seen enough of you. Here, give me that. Burn that man's suit. I'd like to defrost my goose pimples, if you don't mind. Isn't this great? We got the housing shortage beat. We got our own lifeboat. If the boat sinks, we're sitting pretty. We got the jump on the women and children. You couldn't get me a trap like this nearer the boiler room? I don't want you down there. I like heat! I'd like to hear from my blood again. I want you up on deck where it's healthy, where you can breathe that good, deep salt air You're salty enough for me, getting me in these nooks. Because you give my money to those dames! May I give you one small piece of chitchat for your files? If the most beautiful woman in the world walked by, know what I'd do? Give her the full fuller. I'd give her the brush. Do you hear that? What's that? Come on. Who's there? It's just a dame. She's crying. Maybe I can help her. Don't bother. She's old enough to blow her own nose. Wait a minute. You gave me your word of honor, your scout's oath and you crossed your heart. That's a tough parlay to buck. But those are real tears. This dame's different. Here, now, here! No, let me go! Here! Here, now! You don't want to do that. That water's pretty cold out there. Hey, let's get back. You want to get caught? Come on! I said, let me go! Let her go. Maybe she wants to rinse a few things. You're loaded, you've got everything to live for. Yeah, she's loaded, but remember Oklahoma, Texas, New Orleans? I'll help you jump. Now come here! Get back in the nook, schnook. Go on! Hey, whoa! Wait a minute, I just thought of something. If you jump, you'll get us into trouble. We got all we can handle now. I'm sorry. I'll go back to my cabin. Go back to your cabin and shoot yourself. That way, nobody will get hurt. Make it very quiet. A little killing... Take it easy. Who are those men with Lucia? I don't know. But there's something familiar about them. There should be. They're wearing our suits. Shh! You'll thank me later for interfering. I can thank you now, Mr...? Sweeney. Scat Sweeney. My name is Lucia Maria de Andrade. And I'm Hot Lips Barton. Okay, introduction's over. Let's spread out. Wait a minute. Wait, don't push me, pappy. This kid's in a lot of trouble. We got to take things easy. Will you give her the brush? Scout's honor. Okay. So long, kid. And don't tell him any sad stories, because we're cleaned out. Haven't got to eat. Stowaways, third class. Stowaways... Why do you want to take that long, wet leap? A gorgeous gal like yourself? I don't know. I'm worried and confused. I just don't know. Couldn't a man, could it? No. Yes, I suppose so. Oh, I get it. All men are rats... No! No, it isn't that at all. I love Sherman. He's going to meet me in Rio. We'll be married. We'll be happy, we'll be very happy. Wait, wait. Who's Sherman? He's my Aunt Catherine's brother. Your uncle? No. He... You see, she's not really my aunt. She's my guardian. Well, does she know about...? Oh, no! If she ever found out what I tried to do tonight, she'd be heartbroken. She's a wonderful woman. Well, now we're both confused. You're not in love with this fella. You couldn't be. Girls don't go around cutting themselves in with the porpoises when they're going to marry the fella they love. That doesn't make any sense at all. No. Nothing makes sense lately. Every time I make up my mind to do something, I change it, just as though I had no will of my own. There are hours, days even, when I just don't remember what's happened. I know what you're thinking, Mr. Sweeney, and maybe you're right. Wait a minute. Don't you tell me what I'm thinking. You're just as normal as I am, if that's any consolation to you. But you got to pull yourself together, honey. Well! Free movies! Isn't this pleasant? Outdoors and everything. Do you mind sitting here on the balcony? I wonder what we're running tonight. Say, look, honey. Hey, psst! You're going through a tough time and you're letting it get you. That's no way to handle trouble. Look at Max and Gertrude up there on the screen. Her lease is up, he's got a big hangover and her feet are killing her, but there they are up there, floating through the air as if they didn't have a care in the world. How do you know all this? Watch the next shot. Why, Mr. Sweeney, that's you and your friend. That's right. We stopped off in Hollywood for a few days, and stole a couple of dollars doing extra work. Old Hot Lips, he's really hamming it up, isn't he? But getting back to Max and Gertrude, you'd think he was madly in love with her, wouldn't you? Now, I'll tell you something, the boy has a redhead in Jersey City. Mad about her. You'd think she was in love with him. She's not. Watch this. He thinks she's in love with him. Watch this here. Loves to show his teeth. You can't blame him, though. They cost him a pretty penny. You see? No use worrying. "Love is funny" "Or it's sad" "Or it's quiet" "Or it's mad" "It's a good thing" "Or it's bad" "But beautiful" "Beautiful To take a chance" "And if you fall You fall" "And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all" "Love is tearful Or it's gay" "It's a problem Or it's play" "It's a heartache Either way" "But beautiful" "And I'm thinking" "If you were mine I'd never let you go" "And that would be" "But beautiful I know" Ah, you happy little Grable bait. Come on in. What happened? Did you brush her off? Or do I have to learn how to say "not guilty" in Portuguese? This girl's in trouble, boy. Big trouble, big! She's in a worse jam than that girl in Bridgeport. Bridgeport? You mean the wife of that sword-swallower? Chased us six blocks, burping daggers all the way? Don't go again, please, please. Lucia? Lucia? Are you asleep? Listen closely, child. You love Sherman. I love Sherman. Those two men you met tonight, they're stowaways. They're stowaways. They should be reported. They should be reported. You hate them. You loathe them. You despise them. I hate them. I loathe them. I despise them. Sleep, child. Sleep. Yes! How do you...? You like sugar on your ketchup? Nice grab, a bottle of blood. No toothpicks, even. I'm going to eat a shoe. Hey, don't snap your cap. Come on, we'll get something solid. Wait. I can't go out there in this costume, they'll pick me up. Which is a switch. That's right. Let us be inventive, egghead. We take your leotard... Steady now. Open your coat. Will it fit this high? You'll be a smash on the deck. You'll look like Lord Puffing well out for his bracer in the morning. That's jolly, isn't it? There you are. Oh, that's grand. Put a bottle of tiger sweat in my hand and I'm a man of distinction. Will you join me in a bloater? Lead, old boy. Thank you. There you are, Mr. Stanton. Anything else, sir? That's all. How do you do? How are you? Starting to kick up a bit. Keep a stiff upper. It always gets choppy through the Gulf Stream. I clearly remember the last trip. I understand at that time the ship did a complete somersault. Oh, yes. Lost my wife, you know? Oh, lucky fellow! Lucky fellow! Will you join me in a spot of breakfast, maybe a waffle? Shall we, then? That titillates my gastric juices. My stomach is drooling too, you know. Maple syrup, honey? Nice thick maple syrup. Yes, and maybe a piece of ham. Nice thick greasy ham. With a little bit of fatback. And some banana cream pie. Yum-yum-yummy! Absolutely wizard! That sounds like a breakfast fit for a fat old king. Waffles, maple syrup and ham! Maybe some onion soup. And whipped cream. Excuse me! Tilt, old boy. Dig in, pal. Come on, come on. What's the matter? You shouldn't have mentioned that onion soup. You weak-stomached people! I come from a long line of seafaring... Okay, boys. Let's find them. Seems to have calmed down a bit, huh? Not for me, it hasn't. There's Lucia. Hello, honey. I see she brought a friend for you. How are you feeling today? I hate you. I loathe you. I despise you. You made a lot of progress last night. This is your old buddy Scat. Don't you remember at the rail and the song? Officer, I want to report these men. They're stowaways. You should've played a record. Oh, so you're the two guys. Come with me! Wait a minute! The lapels! Drop the material here. Fly, fly, fly! What happened? Nothing important, child. Let's have breakfast. Shh! He's asleep. Sit down, gentlemen. You're next. Thank you. Uh...? See anything of them? No, sir. Check the linen lockers? Yes, sir. No luck. I'll find those patty-cakers if it's the last thing I do. Steady, Ingrid. Ha-ha! So sorry. Oops! Just a small gash. Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Thank you. Shh! What's that noise? My moustache! It's shorter now. Why, you...! You look better. You! I'll do the cutting now! Steady! Think it over! I had a shave this morning! Okay, wise guys! Where have you been? Well, how do you do? Somebody need a shave? We got to take care of the crew. It baffles me. What kind of a piece of business is this? I save her life, then she turns us in! Can you figure out why she hates me? Why she hates you? No, that's hard to figure why she hates you! Oh! The governor get our note? Come on, the captain wants to see you. If it isn't Captain Bligh. Coming, Mr. Christian. Do you think he'll go for it? I'll tell him we're both nuts. He'll only believe you. The captain will do the talking! Say, captain, our presence... We demand better treatment... Oh! Stay away from us, will you, sister? Please, I want to help you. Oh, she wants to help us! You mad because we're still breathing? I think these belong to you. Come to Daddy! My old heater! My little brass gold mine! Now I can smoke up and learn the truth. Did they hurt you? Say, "Ah." Gentlemen, how would you like to work your passage to Rio as members of the ship's orchestra? Do you mean it? Both of us? Yes, both of you. Just report to the leader. I've already spoken to him. Wonderful! Thanks a lot! Don't thank me. I leave you in the custody of your benefactress. Can't we be friends? I'm really very grateful. Grateful? What's the idea of turning us in? I don't know what came over me. I found myself saying things and I didn't know why I was saying them. Why don't you just run for Congress and let us alone, huh? Now look! Lay off those kisses. You know he's weak. I just wanted to show my gratitude. Show me. I can take it. All right. This is for both of you. Steady. I'll get him in the next round... Oh! You should've been with me in that refrigerator. Look, sister, you might as well face it. My buddy's turned over a new leaf. Tell her. In a lifetime of tears and laughter, it's been my discovery that friendship between two men is more important than friendship between a man and a woman. Duller but more important. Tell her you're through with women. And as far as you and I are concerned, we don't even know each other. Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, we arrive in Rio shortly, and the purser's asked me to announce if you have any questions about disembarkation he'd be glad to answer them for you if you come to his office in the morning. Thank you. "Hey, Mr. Sweeney?" Hello. "We've a problem That is apt to spoil the trip Because when we get off the ship" "We know we'll never Understand the language We won't be hip" "Oh, now, Miss Andrews" "After due deliberation Of your problem All you do is move and wobble" "Which in any language Always means a miss" "A kiss" "And this?"

Where are you going? Going out for a little smoke. Oh, no. You've been telling me that every night for the past week. This time I'm going with you. Make sure it's only the pipe that smokes! Just a minute, clumsy. Pick up that stuff. What? You heard what the man said. Stoop if you can. Come on. What stuff? This stuff. Excuse me. Certainly. Excuse me, please. Harry? She'll be meeting him in the same place. See what they're up to. Strange business. I don't get it. Where's that radiogram you mentioned? I've hidden it over here. Let me see it. It arrive today for Mrs. Vail. I opened it. "Rodrigues knows about the papers. Immediate marriage necessary." Signed "Sherman." What papers? I can't imagine. Who's this Rodrigues? He's the attorney for my aunt's estate. Looks to me like Sherman's after your money. Oh, no. It couldn't be that. My aunt Catherine has supported me all of my life. I still don't like her. She gives me a creepy feeling. You know, lately I seem to get the same feeling. Sometimes when she talks to me, I get chills up my spine. Honey, next time you get chilly, I'm your man. Lucia, mind if I come in? How do you like that dish-faced Don Juan? He's checking up on me. Lucia? This is Hot Lips. String him along a little bit. We might need him, huh? No, this is the first place he looks. Well, here I am. Start bubbling. Hello. Are you alone? I certainly am alone. Why do you ask? I thought you might have a date with bean belly. Oh, no. What makes you think that? He's always looking for a place to keep warm. You don't think I could get serious about him, with a great big handsome hunk of man like you around, do you? Just call me Hunk. All right, Hunk. I must remember what kind of soap I use. Here, drop anchor and we'll talk it over. Did I say "talk"? Yes, we do have a lot... I know there's not much time for talking. I know how you feel. Shall I kiss you now or do you want me to tease you for a while? Oh, but, Hot Lips... I'm all lips. Please, I... I know how you feel. You're warm and grateful, passionate... What's the matter, you crazy or something? Please, I... Who came in? I'm sorry, I lost my head. Yeah, that makes two of us. I'm sorry. Please sit down. You sold me, baby. Come on, dear. That's better. Let's live a little. Forgiven? Oh, naturally. Naturally. Oh, you have such a nice smooth hand. Oh! This one's even softer. And this one's softer, too! You have three of the nicest... Three hands? Three...? And this one's got hair on it! Aha! And it's got an ape on the end of it! Alone, huh? Who's this, your father? You were never better. Great try. Goodbye, sister! And don't write! Take it easy. Let me tell you... That's all right. I'm not blaming you. You couldn't help yourself. You're just a weak spineless jellyfish. You're so sweet. I know what's cooking here. This doll's making a play for you so she can get to me! But, Hot Lips... It's not going to work. You double-crossed your last sucker. Let's blow this nest. Uh-oh! Mrs. Vail. Who? The Black Widow. The closet, come on! Shh! Oh, there you are. The captain's been asking for you, child. I was just coming up. Don't kick them. They've had enough. Cigarette? Thank you. There's my brother. Sherman? Hello, darling! I'll meet you at the gangplank! Where's Lucia? Find Lucia. Yes, ma'am. Scat, you do believe that I didn't know those men were in the closet? I believe you, but that Hot Lips still thinks he was framed. Let him think that way, huh? What are we doing? I thought you were getting me off the boat. Stand by. Genius. Thinking all the time. There you are, all to yourself. Very intimate. Scat, you're a genius. Well, I admit it. Get in there. Take off that skimmer. Can you handle it? Oh, I think so. In case you want to get a little air, you can bore yourself an opening. No dancing, please. Tilt! Sorry, honey. Hey, what do you say...? Oh, there you are! Why did you want to meet down here? Big news. We signed a bull fiddle player. We're going to meet him at the hotel. That's... What do we want with a bull fiddle player? My mind is working all the time, wheels are turning. Tell me more, Orson. When we get off the boat, we'll get a band for you, like you always wanted. Isn't that wonderful? Are you happy? Let me see how you look when you're happy. Not that happy! I talk the language, I'll make the contacts. We can't miss. You're getting on the ball! For a minute, I thought you were down here with Lucia. No! That doll is cooked for me, boy. Feels like the bull is already in here. Hey! Why do we have to carry this thing? It's a union rule down here. The bull fiddle player never carries his own instrument. They got their own union? Yes. Take some. Here we go. Push a little. This is no ricksha! Left rudder! I can't understand you leaving Lucia without even saying goodbye. I'm through with that chick. I told you downstairs, don't you believe me? Yeah. Can you breathe all right? Sure I can breathe. See? It won't be long. Easy there, butterfingers, easy! You waiting for your broom? I'll listen for you on "Inner Sanctum." What about Rodrigues? Nothing yet. As long as he doesn't get to Lucia before the wedding, we're safe. The papers. Good. Put them away. Where's the girl? She's not on the boat. What do you mean? She's not on the boat. She must've gotten off with those two musicians. What two musicians? Two men she met on the boat. What about the wedding? There'll be a wedding. They just left the pier. Follow them and you'll find Lucia. And then take care of those two. I hope you had a pleasant trip, Captain Harmon. Ah, Mr. Rodrigues. Tell me, captain, have you seen Senhorita Lucia de Andrade? Lucia? Didn't she get off with her aunt? No, I didn't see her. Then she must've left with those two American musicians. Two American musicians? I wonder how I can find them. That shouldn't be very difficult. One of them has... Thank you very much, captain. Thank you! What is this, another lobby? Don't be silly. This is our suite. Our suite? Who pays? Drop it, yes. Hey, hey! Who's getting married? This is two men! Compliment of the hotel, senhor. Oh, on the cuff! Keep it coming! Tip the boys, huh? We're down to our last buck. How do you say "give me some change" in Portuguese? It's too late. There they go. They're off. Check back, men, huh? Check back! We're down to the burlap. Give me a hand with this thing. Hurry up. Just take it right there by the end. That's a good man! Up! Don't strain yourself there! There's another handle, you know! What are you, the head of the union? You're always beefing. You'd holler if you were hung with a new rope. Here we are, living in a wonderful suite. The most expensive in the hotel. And there'd better be a fire escape. You all right? You keep asking me. I'm all right! Okay. Then put this over in the corner, will you? Why don't you get a whip? You're not a little stiff, are you? Stiff? I haven't had a drink since I left the boat. Nice setup, a suite! What do we need two bedrooms for? You can't expect Lucia to sleep on the sofa. No, sir. If anybody sleeps on the sofa, I'm... Huh? Aha! Aha! Hello, Hot Lips. Oh, no, no! You're a mirage. It can't be. It's just a figment of my imagination. A soft figment. A bull fiddle, huh? Wait a minute. The bull fiddle, those two gorillas... If they'd have known what was going on, they'd have killed us. What makes me think they didn't know? Come on! Take it easy! Take it easy! So long, sister. If we don't get in touch, it's nothing personal. It's just that we're prejudiced against dying young. He's right, Scat. This is my problem. Hold it, now, wait! This gal's in a lot of trouble, and you got to help her. Like any guy would, with red blood in his veins! I got news for you, I'm anemic. She stays with us. Nothing doing. If you think I'll let a beautiful doll like this live in the same apartment that I'm living in... If you think... If you... lf... Yes, Hot Lips. I'll give you just 72 hours to get out of here. Grand! Now we're promoting. Come one, what are we waiting for? Let's live a little! I'd like to, if you'd only let me! Open this up. I'll have mine straight. Happy grapes! Are you ready to bubble? The Guanabara Club, please. Yes... I'd like to speak to Senhor Cardoso. Who's Cardoso? One of the band gave me a lead on him. He goes for jump music in a big way. We're going to pick up a little bread. Now we're moving. Hello, Cardoso? This is Scat Sweeney of Scat Sweeney & His Dixie Hotshots. Featuring Hot Lips Barton. Featuring Hot Lips Barton, yeah. Zoot Shapiro told me to look you up when we landed down here. He said you might have a spot for our band in your club. If you're any good, I certainly could use you. Mr. Cardoso! Our group is gone! Really gone! I've also got a great gal singer with us, Ginger O'Roark. Great singer? Hell, if she looks like Lamour, she can sing like Lamour, can't she? Oh! Tell him she plays bull fiddle from the inside. Also plays the... No! The rest of the band? Well, there's, uh... Well, there's me and Hot Lips Barton. That's two. Three, four, five pieces. Five pieces in the band, yes. Say... Shh! Yes, Mr. Cardoso? That's a little soon, don't you think? How about tomorrow night? Fine, fine. You got yourself a band, brother! How's that for operating, huh? Don't put away your scalpel, doc. Where are the other pieces? Let's... You mean, you're going to hire those guys? Why not? Let's talk to them. I'll be back in a minute. But they're on key. Come on, break open the happy brew. Let's go. Thank you. Oh! To the Dixie Hotshots? Yes, right! Not so hard! I must go on a diet. That grape must be a little grumpy. Shall we go again? Put it right in there. That's pretty athletic stuff. That might've happened to my stomach. Ready, boys? I guess so. We're though here. How about that? Don't miss this time. What are you looking for? A light. Well, you've got a light. They don't call me Hot Lips for nothing, you know. Hey, let's get out of here. This joint is haunted. Just what we need, huh? We'll never get away with it. We want Dixie Hotshots not Hot Tamales. It's simple. We'll get five snappy, zooty uniforms. Using what for money? Hock something we don't need. Like your head? Wait a minute. I think I can help. I know a store where we can get credit. Great. I'll clinch the deal. Hey, fellas! Tell them. What did you say? They're joining up! Wait, Shorts! Let's not be that grateful. That's our racket. Lead us to the store. Here we go, come along. Wait. What's your problem? Lobster Ear, don't you want to think this over? No, nothing to think over. Come along, we're set. You're happy, huh? Gee, things grow fast in this country! Tropics, you know. Come along. Scat Sweeney was one of those men on the boat. And Ginger O'Roark is Lucia. Good evening. Mrs. Vail's reservation. Yes. Right this way, please. I don't like it. These stripes look too good on us. You would know. I get a funny feeling about this whole deal. It's too perfect. Stop worrying. You want to get wrinkles over you wrinkles? They look more like Americans than we do. They could be the Andrews Brothers. Yeah, Patty, La Verne and Pancho! Wait. Hold everything. What's your problem? We're supposed to be Americans. They don't understand English! I got that licked! We teach them a little help talk, and Cardoso will never know the difference. Now, break it up for us foreigners. Wilco. "You're telling me." "You're telling me." You telling me. You're telling me. "You're in the groove, Jackson." You're in the groove, Jackson. You're in the groove, Jackson. You're telling me. You're in the groove, Jackson. You're telling me. What do you think? "What do you...?" What do I think? This is murder! This is murder. This is murder. You're in the groove... You're telling me. What do I think? What do I...? Time! Time! Drag! You better rehearse. Right. When I hold up one finger... You're telling me. You're in the groove, Jackson. This is murder. Five more minutes, they'd speak better English than you. You're in the groove, Jackson. This is murder. They're off again! Come on! Come on! Yes, sir, yes, sir! We're all ready. Come on, honey, We'll be on in a minute. I'm not quite dressed. Maybe I better help. Tut-tut! I'm a little young, huh? Uh-oh! Trouble. I wish you the best of luck. Come on, let's cut in, quick! Hi, Mr. Cardoso. I see you've met the boys. Not really. I was just... This is Spike, Satch and Oscar. Spike, Satch and Oscar. I'm honored, gentlemen. Okay, fellas, on the stand. You have a few minutes, yet. Let's shoot the grease, hey, boys? They use most of it in their hair. They don't talk very much, do they? Well, actually, they talk a blue streak when they get going. Yeah. Say something to Mr. Cardoso, fellas. You're in the groove, Jackson. Isn't he sweet? Plant me now and pick me later, eh, big boy? You're groovy! Shall we, then? Come along. Oh, just a minute. I'm sorry. You'll have to put out that cigarette. No smoking. I said, no smoking. You're telling me. I'm telling him! He's the one that's smoking. This is murder. I don't care if it is murder. You cannot smoke. No smoking. No smoking. You're in the groove, Jackson. You don't have to get fresh, I'm only telling him the rules! You're telling me. Oh, no. I told you before, I'm telling him! For the third time, no smoking! This is murder. You want to stunt your growth? He's a tobacco fiend, but it shan't happen again. Shall we, then? "You're telling me"! You're telling me! Back off! He likes to mimic people. His mother was frightened by a parrot. Crazy Americans! Teach them some more and we'll get killed. This is murder. You're telling me. What a gown. How did you put that on? With a spray gun? You heard what the man said, no smoking. Not one little puff? No! Is everything going all right? Sensational. Watch this. You're telling me. You're in the groove. You're telling me. This is murder. Look out. We're on, come on! Let's try and finish together, huh? "Romance" "It's such a wonderful thing" "One glance" "And I was set for a fling" "And he isn't flip and flighty Like high school boys" "He's a college man With plenty of poise" "He knows an awful lot" "I guess you'd say He's got experience" "Experience" "He takes me out to dine And knows the proper wine" "Because he's got experience" "Riding in his car We had a flat" "It was dark as it could be" "He got the tools And fixed it just like that" "Experience, you see" "He takes me straight home And he bows and shakes my hand" "Experience comes through" "So if you want someone To plan with" "I'll gladly give this man With experience to you" Break it up big now, buddy. Let's get out of here. We can always open a laundry somewhere. "Experience, you see" "He plays the nicest notes And this belongs in quotes" "Experience comes through" "So if you want someone To plan with" "I'll gladly give this man With experience" "To you" Holy smoke! Did you hear that applause? I think we're a hit. Honey, you were perfect, wonderful! You think he'll hire us? We're a cinch! My aunt is out front and wants me to join her. No, not that woman again? She's nothing but trouble. Not anymore, Scat. I'll see her. Very good, boys! Very good! Groovy, groovy! Ah, my dear! You were wonderful! Congratulations, hepcats. From now on, you are working for Cardoso. Best move you ever made. Come on, fellas! Get a dancer for the bubbles. We'll be right back. Lucia, you were wonderful. Darling, congratulations. Thank you, Sherman. Come on, sit down. We'd like to talk to you. I'm sorry to have to say this, Sherman, but if it's about the wedding, my mind is made up. But, Lucia... Of course, dear. We'd be the last to try to change your mind. Do sit down. Naturally, I'm not very happy about what you're doing, Lucia. But if that's the way you feel, then, of course, I want to help you. Don't you see, dear? That's all. I want to help you. A drink to our future, gentlemen. Whoa! Steady. To the Dixie Hotshots! Who are they? Oh, us! Yes. Well, Lu... Uh, Ginger. You're just in time, Miss O'Roark. Get a load of this contract. We just signed for five years. Two-week guarantee. Proud of me, honey? I hate you. I loathe you. I despise you. Baby! She acts more like Bogie! Please, what is going on? What is this? These men are making a fool of you, Mr. Cardoso. They told you this was an American band, but it isn't. They picked up those three men right here on the street in Rio. Don't pay attention to her. She jumps the track now and then. Her noggin's on the toboggan! Cleo, your camels are waiting! Look at those clothes. You are not Americans! You're telling me! You're telling me! You're in the groove... So, you are phoneys! You have been making a fool of Cardoso. No, we're doing everything for you. You heard the applause. That does not matter! Liars do not work for Cardoso. Get out! You don't have to call us names. We're on the level. Look at our faces. Don't confuse the man! Let me tell you... Get out! Pedro! Silvio! You are through. Fired! Get out of here and never come back. We can explain everything. If you'd just let us talk... Whoa! Drop that body! You all right, pal? Oh, I hate you. I loathe you. I despise you. Lay off me, will you? I feel bad enough. You phoneys! You will never work in Rio again! Who wants to work? We're musicians! Broken-down trap. Psst! Huh? Oh. Good night, boys. Good night, miss! The papers. Put them in the safe when you get to the plantation. What about those two musicians? They can still cause trouble. Really, Sherman. You should know by now that I never leave any loose ends. Get some sleep, child. You have a long trip ahead of you. Come along, darling. All right, Harry. Drive around to the stage entrance. With pleasure. I guess our engagement with Senhor Cardoso was of the limited variety. Don't worry. We'll find another country where a dame can get you in trouble. I can't figure that Lucia out. One moment she's sweet as pie, and the next second, a heel. What's in her mind? Look, you got 32 slaps. You want to try for 64? Let's grab a northbound boat and we switch this time. You hang on the meat hook. Oh, better tell the boys it's off. We'll send you one of our old straitjackets, huh? Bye, fellas. So long. Adeus. Come on, genius. Let's grab the boat. Uh-oh. It's tall, dark and cyanide. Good evening, Mr. Sweeney, Mr. Barton. Hi, Mrs. Vail. Hiya, fellas. What do you hear from your embalmer? I'm sorry. Mr. Sweeney... Yeah? I'd like to make you and your friend a business proposition. Business? He's all ears. What kind of a proposition? Lucia's getting married tomorrow. I think it would be best for all of us if she never saw you again. I'm willing to give you $10,000 to leave Brazil. Ten grand? That's a big deal. We'll have to have some time to think this over. You'll have to give us time. Well, time's up. Where's the money? Oh, really. I don't have it with me now. Come along. We'll arrange the details at my home. Let's talk this over. Let's get the money and talk and count at the same time. Happy thoughts. Jolly. We usually charge 15,000 to leave countries. You're getting quite a bargain. Straight to the vault, James. Psst! You can skip the java, Mrs. Vail. Never mind the coffee, just pour the sugar, huh? You're very suspicious young men. It's not that. It's just that we're grown up. This might be a plot to get rid of us. The coffee might be poisoned. Yeah, who knows, this could... Have you got any tea? Very well. I'll put your minds at ease. Which would you rather have? Ten thousand in cash? Or this piece of jewelry? Personally, I look better in the green stuff. Just a minute. My turn. I'm afraid you've made a very poor choice, gentlemen. You see, this locket happens to be worth $50,000. Fifty... The stone is one of the largest and purest of star sapphires. It was mined in Rangipour Province of India many generations ago. Way down there? If you look closely, you can see the iridescent star of the true sapphire. Look closely. Closely. Yeah. Yeah, I can see it. Can you see it, Mr. Sweeney? Look deep into the stone. Now, do you see the star? Yeah, I can see it. Good. Keep looking into the star. You won't be needing this? Many years ago, two men killed each other in a struggle for the possession of this stone. One of them was the Duke Duchampere. A good-looking young man, who bore a resemblance to you, Mr. Sweeney. In fact, you are the Duke Duchampere. I am the Duke Duchampere. The other man was a certain Count Venescue. I am the count. Generation after generation, gentlemen, your two families have hated each other. I hate your family. I hate yours. This hatred has descended to you, the last decadent offspring of these noble ancestors. Swine. Pig. That's the same as swine. All right. Ham! You both desire this stone. You would kill to get it. There's only one way: a duel. A duel. A duel. A duel to the death. A duel. A duel. To the death. To the death. A duel. To the death. Come, gentlemen. Your pistols, gentlemen. Loaded, I trust? It's easy to find out. Not yet! Not sporting, huh? My man is ready, Baron. Good. You gentlemen know the rules. When I say go, take 10 paces, turn and fire. Take 10 paces, turn and fire. Take 10 paces, turn and fire. Let's get out of here. Go! Well, dog, why do you wait? Haven't we forgotten something? Ah, yes. The final insult. Ten paces, turn and fire. Ten paces, turn and... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What is this? A gun! Oh, I remember. That dame, she hypnotized us. Aha! You've got a gun too! She wanted us to kill each other. Boy, what a narrow escape, huh, pal? Ten paces, turn and fire. Oh, now, duke. Duke! Scat! I mean... Scat, snap out of it! Wake up! You don't want to kill me. I'm your buddy, your friend! It's no use, Count Venescue. But I'm not a count. I'm not a count! I'm just Hot Lips Barton, a plain ordinary schmo! I must avenge the family honor. What family? You haven't even got a family! You were left on a doorstep with a bottle of milk, homogenized! Ten paces, turn and fire. Stop saying that, Scat! You got to listen to me. We're friends, we're practically brothers! Blood is thicker than water, and this is no time to prove it! Besides, I want to live. I'm too young to die. Too young, do you hear me? Too young! Let go, you swine. That's the same as pig! Eight... No! Nine... No! Ten paces! No, no! Walk some more! You took short ones. Turn... Don't do it, pal! Don't shoot! You haven't got a license! Besides, I'm out of season! Please, don't! Hot Lips! Hot Lips! Oh, my pal. My buddy! And I killed him. Oh, when I think of all the gay, carefree, happy times we've had together... Now he's gone. I wonder where he kept his life insurance. Oh, I'll remember you like this, partner. Lying there in that beautiful double-breasted, brown pinstripe. Hardly even been worn! Well, you've got me to thank for this. I've lied to you, I've double-crossed you, I've conned you, ever since the day we first met. Remember that gal in St. Louis? The one that broke a date with you because she had to go to the movies with her grandmother? Well... I was Granny. We didn't see much of the picture. You remember the 20 bucks that disappeared in Cincinnati? You thought your money belt had sprung a leak. I stole that 20 bucks and bought myself a duck press. Hot Lips! You're alive! Say something. Give me that 20 bucks. Let me help you. Don't help me anymore, Granny. You've helped me enough! How do you like that? Not even my size! You want to take it easy... Lay off me, you fat Benedict Arnold, you! And another thing, this deal about Lucia... Wait a minute. Lucia. Yeah, what about her? Don't you see? The same thing that happened to us happened to her. That swinging locket routine. Deep, deep. Stop it! It makes me seasick. That's the gimmick. That's how Mrs. Vail gets her to do anything she wants. That's why she's marrying Mallory. Poor kid. Are we going to stand by and let her throw her life away? Are we going to take the easy way out? Yes, we are. You're admitting you're a dirty coward? No, a clean one! I've seen everything. I've seen it all. But never, never in a lifetime of tears and laughter, have I seen a guy walk out on a gal who's nuts about him. Well, you're seeing one right now. l... You mean Lucia? You mean she's nuts about me? She's dying to kiss a trumpet player. Oh, well, that figures. It's nothing new to me. I've had dolls blow their lid about me before. Well, don't stand there. You want to be best man, don't you? Come! Always was. Howdy. We would like to speak to Senhorita de Andrade. We're friends of hers. Ah, for that, you will have to go to Campinas. She's being married this afternoon to Senhor Mallory. This afternoon? A big wedding. The whole countryside will be there. How about people? Everybody will attend. Good day, senhores. Everybody will be there but us. How far is Campinas? About 300 miles. Walk faster. Brother, we're stymied. Not if we can hire a plane. Hire a plane? We haven't got enough to get an airmail stamp! We'll get dough. Sure, there's nothing to it. A guy's going to step out from behind a tree and say, " Here, boys. Here's some dough. Hire a plane." Psst! Gentlemen! I wonder if this ever happens in real life. Mr. Sweeney, Mr. Barton. l... Oops! That's Eenie, Meenie and Mo. My name is Rodrigues. The fella in the radiogram. I understand Lucia is very fond of one of you. You will do anything to help her? Remember, it may mean your life. I'll get the police. No, no, no! The police cannot help us, not yet. But you can. How? Gentlemen, hidden in a safe in Mrs. Vail's bedroom at the coffee plantation, you will find... the papers. The papers? Morning or evening papers? They are in a long manila envelope. Find the envelope and give it to the prefeito. Prefeito? Sounds like a dessert. That's one of the local big shots. The prefeito will be at the wedding. He's a man we know we can trust. I don't get it. How can the... papers stop a wedding? These papers can. Ha-ha! Gentlemen, you do what I tell you. Un momento. Shh! What do you think? Fly to Campinas. Get the papers. Stop the wedding. Foil Mrs. Vail. Rescue Lucia. Boy, what a finish. Great. Who was that? The Warner Bros. They're very jealous. Thank you. Now, here's the money. Hire a plane. My car will take you to the airport. Come! Hey, you're going to go with us? I'll be along later with help. Fine. Happy landings. Goodbye. Oops! Break it up men, we've had this already. Oh, yes. A nice landing. Don't ever use the wheels, it's better that way. Picturesque place, isn't it? Yeah. We got to meet Chloe here. She's featured here. Look at this. You all right? Come, men, come. There you are. Pretty cosy in there, wasn't it? You're telling me. Pay the man. Uh-oh. They went that way. Pay the man. Here you are. There we are. There we go. Here, one for the copilot. Nice work. And the hostess. There you are. Buy yourself a B-29. Make our goodbyes to the rest of the passengers. Thank you. Which way's the hot dogs? Over here. When are they going to hold the wedding? I'll find out. Amigo? We got to find those... papers pronto. They're going to start as soon as the prefeito arrives. He's liable to see a double-header: Lucia's wedding and our funeral. Round. Huh? Uh-oh. Mrs. Rigor-Mortis. Let's see what's playing up there on the mezzanine. Amigos! Hey, do you believe in ghosts? Who says opportunity doesn't knock twice? We lost them. We better tell Mrs. Vail. Come on. Listen closely, child. You're in the chapel. My brother's at your side. You're about to be married. Lucia Maria de Andrade, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? I do. Come, child. Time to get dressed. Come on, let's go in. What's playing in there? The papers. Oh! Hey. Don't do that! Where's the safe? Behind the painting. Always is. Any more ideas, fat man? Oh! Tilt! They must've talked to Rodrigues. Don't worry, Mrs. Vail. They'll never get the papers. How do we know they haven't got them already? Twelve to the left. Seven to the right. Nine to the left. ... to the right. What was that? Five to the... Five to the right. The papers. Lucky for all of us, they're still here. Tony, you watch that door. Harry, this one. I think our friends will be dropping by. And this time, no games. Let's crack this little crib, huh? Those sneaks. What's the matter with you? We got the combination. I was just reminiscing. Hurry up. The papers! Shh! If they hear us, we're dead ducks. Quack, quack! Quack, quack! Quack, quack! Charge! What's the matter with you? "Everybody here Likes chicken cacciatore" "Everybody here Likes chicken cacciatore" "Oh! Oh!" "And there's a few Who like chopped chicken liver" "And there's a few Who like chopped chicken liver" "Oh! Oh!" Come on, Blanchard. Knock them, Davis. Faster! Scat? Scat, where...? Who? Oh, it's you. Proceed, boy. Prefeito! Oh, this is it! Fly, boy! Okay, guys, the party's over. Help! Help! Help! Get the lead out of your horses! Thieves! Where are they? Where are what? Where's the papers? Honest, fellas, we haven't got any papers. We can't even read! I wouldn't be caught dead with... No use. Huh? We're cornered. Fellas, the papers are right in back of the clock. That's right. Right there. Back of that pendulum. Stop horsing around. Where's the papers? We'll give you just 10 seconds to make up your mind. Well, look. It's there. One... Right in back of the pendulum. two... Watch the pendulum. Four, Four, five, five, six, six, seven, eight... seven, eight... Watch the pendulum. Deep into the pendulum. Deep. Psst! Hey! We seem to have them. What do we do now? Watch. You are children, little children, playing a game. Playing patty-cake. Yeah, yeah, patty-cake. One of you cheats. Naughty, naughty. The other one doesn't like it. You go faster and faster. You're waiting for a chance to get even. Faster and faster! You're waiting for a signal. A signal to slug each other. And when we say "three," that's the signal. One, two, three! Whoa! Ha-ha! That's what they get for not seeing our pictures. Come along! Come along! Wait! Look out! Hey, wait a minute! Hold everything! Look out! Stop the wedding! Yeah, return the presents! Lucia? I do. I do. Don't you see? She's hypnotized. Snap out of it, honey, for me. Baby? Baby? Sorry for this interruption. These hoodlums don't belong here. Are you going to stand there...? Just a second. Wait, sister! You're the one going to the clink. This whole wedding is a frame-up! Wait till you see what we got. Yeah! The papers! What am I doing in this wedding dress? You're all right now, baby. Here you are, sir, take a look at these papers. Is he on our side? Pull up the drawbridge! What are you doing, you fools? We hate you. We loathe you. We despise you. Let me go! We hate you. We loathe you. We despise you. Gentlemen, you have all our thanks. Your discovery of these papers has prevented a horrible miscarriage of justice. Papers stop a wedding? I still don't get it. Let's see. Aha! What does it say? The world must never know. What do you know? We never quite made it! Exciting, though, wasn't it? I'm sorry, nobody home. Put the shoes out later, will you? You thought you'd get away with it, huh? Get away with what? We're married, bud! You're married? I'm sorry, Scat. This is the man I love. My dream boy. Oh, please, honey, not in front of strangers. Get a barrel and go over the falls, son. We'll check with you. How do you like this? And close the door tight. All the time I thought she was in love with me. Take it easy, honey. This doesn't figure. It doesn't figure at all. Oh, I might've known. Deep! Deep!
