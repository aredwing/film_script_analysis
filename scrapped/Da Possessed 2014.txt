Hey, you have no proof. - What are you talking about? - Don't tell me you are courting that Anna. I dont like her. She's not pretty. She just has big boobs. Really, mom? They're big? Big! Like an underwear and whiskey model combined! Dont try to hide it, Anna. You're so obvious. You're a brave girl, but when it comes to love, you're vulnerable. You've been in love thirteen times now. Thirteen times you've been heartbroken. Thirteen times you've bought your own wedding ring. And youre only twenty-eight! You're a flirt! Don't you dare court that girl. And dont hide it from me. Family members don't lie. Im not hiding anything, mom. Promise. Let's sleep, mom. Good night. Good night! Sleep! I have a new playmate! Someone will finally bury us properly. He is the key to our vengeance. We will use Ramon's body. You mean, we will possess him? He was the one who disturbed our resting place. He woke us up. Therefore, he is the chosen one. The chosen one? Ill be able to play again. Go, Anya. Entering the nose is no good. Find another hole. All right. I have to time it right. There, there. Perfect. One, two, three... It still didn't work. Yuck! There's so much saliva. Oh, I know what to do! Ramon is naughty. He likes it in a different way. You, naughty boy. Yuck! It stinks! Dump that out, Ramon! - It stinks! - What the heck, Ramon? Go to the bathroom! Smells like septic tank! Mom, that's your breath. I tasted it. How was your trip inside? Hi, Anna! May I ask you out on a date? This is my latest project - the casino! What do you think, my friends? It's a brilliant idea, Don Demetrio! Why are they laughing? It's so corny. Look who's talking! How can you trust such faces? I think theyre just naturally happy people. Listen up! He is my foster father, Don Demetrio. He owns this casino. We all work for him. You got it?! Im happy to meet all of you. We, workers, are also happy to meet you. Shut up! Father... That is Ramon. Our most hardworking and most handsome employee. Get back to work! Go! Ramon, just stay there. Father... This is Ramon. Our most hardworking and most handsome employee. Is there anyone among you, lowlifes... who wants to die by my gun and the fists of my friends... just to court Anna? None. No one, Don Demetrio. Hi, Anna! Let me walk you home. Are you mad? You're mad. Anna... You really are mad! Anna... How do you make a banana disappear? How? Replace "B" with "G". Gone-nana. In English, it's gone Anna, listen to me. Let me explain. And why should I listen to you? Youre not even courting me, right? It was my first time to meet Don Demetrio. Of course, I got a little scared. A little? You were on your knees, face flat on the ground... Scared to your wits! You're just a LITTLE scared?! Anna... I promise you, I'll be braver next time. Anna... Anna... I want you to know... I will pursue you. I will court you, and I will be proud of it. Anna, how do you make a banana reappear? How? Showman-a'.! How do you make a banana run? How? Runinanairunmana. How do you make a banana go away? How? Bye-nana! Leave! Gone-nana! Wanna come with me? Runinanairunmana. Run-nana. You came home late again! Me? No! me! Late? That's not true, Father. Whos your new boyfriend? Boyfriend? What's that? Is that edible? Dont forget. You have had thirteen boyfriends already. They were all scared of me. No one was brave enough to pursue you. So if one thinks of courting you... he must go through me first! Because if not... he can never get near you! Yes, Father. Bless... talk some sense into your niece. Happy birthday, happy birthday Make a wish! Now, blow the candle! Blow! Yehey! Happy Birthday, Anna! Thank you, Daddy! I love you! I love you, too, Daddy. I miss my Daddy. I wish he didn't die so soon. We were so happy. Right, Auntie? We were poor. But Daddy and I were really happy and contented. Its not that Im complaining with my life now. Its just that... I feel like I'm in a cage. I understand, Anna. But I also understand Don Demetrio. He's just protecting you. I saw how close Don Demetrio and your Daddy were. Thats why, when your Daddy died... he took you in as his own. But sometimes he's too protective, Auntie. He's always overreacting! Just like you. Always overreacting! Always! Always overreacting! Why?! Why is he always overreacting? Always, overreacting! He's overreacting, Auntie! Always overreacting! Hey, Berting! Why are you here? Did you and Marie fight again? Hey, Berting! Get up! Let me sleep. You don't want to get up?! Berting! Ramon! What is it? Why are you calling me? What do you want? Hi, Babe! It stinks like Durian! She got hit with Durian! It's him, Doc. Oh, Ramon. Hi Doc! Belen. Berting. According to my mother-in-law, I'm not a part of the family. Hello! No! She's not part of the family, too. Get used to it. I am certainly not part of the family! Thank God for that! Yes, I know! We're not related to reptiles! Okay, fine. Members of the family... I'll give it to you straight. Ramon's heart is really weak. It's not asthma that makes him black out when he gets scared... but panic attacks. Huh? He should never get scared again. If he gets scared... he might die" What!? Doc? What does that mean? It's like this... Woah! Theres a ghost behind you Ramon! Ramon! Ramon! Ramon! Ramon! Doc, revive him! Clear? Clear. Ramon?! Ramon... That will happen if he gets another panic attack. Doc, does that mean I'll die if I get scared again? Like I said... Whos that beside you? Ramon! Clear' Clear. Any more questions? None. We get it, Doc. Good. Okay. I ll go ahead. Okay, Doc. Please, go ahead. Leave! See! I told you this would happen! You shouldn't be working for that girl! But Mom^lm courting her! No! I won't allow it! Ramon! Ramon! Okay! I allow it! You may court her. Right, my dear? I love you, dear! I love you! Welcome to the family! I love you! Just for you my child. Famiiy? She's family?! Hello, guys Welcome to my crib! Granny, is that you?

Granny, dont sleep. Oh, I'm sorry. We need to be sure that your house is haunted. First... If you feel there's someone playing with your hair... or with your blanket while you 're sleeping. We're 20% sure! There's a ghost in your house. Second... If things disappear and reappear by themselves... We're 40% sure! Third... If you feel like someone's watching you as you bathe, or as you brush your teeth... or while you wash your dishes. Were 60% sure! Fourth... If the piano plays... by itself...

When someone plays with a ball, but nobody sees it. It must not be a top or a toy car... Just balls... None. There are no ghosts. None. Dan-dan-dan-dan. We're 100% sure! Berting, tell Ramon to take the kids out of the house. He can't be there when we have the ghosts exorcised. I said, he cant be there in the house - This old geezers got nothin! Crap,! Lola Domeng? Lola Domeng? Lola - Lola Domeng! Shh! She's sleeping! Keep quiet! What are you staring at us like that? I had no idea Lola Domeng still had some spunk left in her. We're not gigolos. We're her grandchildren. Are you spirit mediums, too? Uh...yeah. Well, you do look like you work with the dead. Why do you say that? Why are you here? My house is haunted. Maybe you can exorcise the ghosts. Momfasyo bolele! Dude, wait! You should read it in reverse. Start from the bottom. It's called back-masking. The spirits will weaken faster for sure.

Youre so busy. So I proposed for you. Youre lucky I said yes. I'm so happy! Tomorrow, you have to go to my poster father to ask for my hand in marriage. Really? I kissed you? Did you hear what she said? Of course, I heard it. I'm not blind. This is our chance to finally get inside Demetrio's house. And Ramon will be our key! Mom, I'm going to Anna's foster father... to ask her hand in marriage. Mom, what happened here? Are the townspeople forcing us to leave again? Mom, that's not your name. You are Belen Villamayor. This is your handwriting. Why did I write these? I dont know. You've been acting weird for days. I don't know who you are anymore. Am I Anastacio Balbitero Jr.? Witnesses say that these people were gunned down... and were buried by unidentified men in a vacant lot. Ghosts who possess the living are usually vengeful. Whoever is possessed by these ghosts... If he or she is still alive... should start praying... because these ghosts will not rest until they get what they want... even if they kill the one they possess! What the hell, man?! This sucks! Where the heck is Ramon? He's still not here. Beautiful women shouldn't wait for such men! So you're allowed to wait then? What did you say? - What did you say?! - Auntie Auntie! Take this! What did you say? Maybe he's stuck in traffic. You've been waiting for five hours. Is he coming from Mindanao? Maybe he bought flowers. He's taking too long. Is he still waiting for them to bloom? Wandering spirits are very playful. They can do a lot of bad things to us. They can flick our ears. Tickle our armpits. Poke our butts. Pinch our foreheads. Tap your heads. Bite your hands. Give us a wet willies. And pull on our eyebrows. But for the sake of bringing peace to Ramon's life... I am begging you, do not move a muscle! Do not ever leave! And do not give in to the ghost's power! We are Ramons strength! Let's all hold hands. Anastacio Balbitero Jr .. can I invite you to a heart-to-heart talk? Father! Let's play! No! Im not part of the family. I'm leaving already! Excuse me! Nobody moves! Nobody leaves! Nobody gives in! Im scared. Anastacio' Balbitero Jr... what do you want from me? Please answer quickly because Anna is waiting for me. I hate the name Anastacio, babe. For goodness' sake... call me Chemerut. Che... Che... Me... Me... Rut... Ramon! It's your turn... Che... Che... Me... Me... Rut.. Rut! We are the real owners of that land! Thats true! I have the title! They stole it from me! Those monsters! They are animals! Dog! Cat! Goat! Rabbit! Turkey! They are gutless! They have no guts! They are full of bile! They have no shame! No mercy No woman, no cry All of them will pay Where did he go? He walked out. Can the two of you walk out as well? Ramon He doesn't love me, Auntie. He doesn't love me. What did I tell you? I know, right? I really believed we were engaged. I even matched our names to make sure. E for Engagement. Stupid! E is for Enemy! Anna, maybe Ramon didn't show up because he is the enemy. Listen to me... So you won't get hurt anymore... repeat after me. Ramon is my enemy Ramon is my enemy Ramon is my enemy Ramon is my enemy! Again! Ramon is my enemy Again! Ramon is my enemy! Faster! Ramon is my enemy! Ramon is my enemy! Ramon is my enemy! Slower! Ramon is my enemy! Why did you leave us, Ramon? Marie should have died instead! Ramon is gone! Bad move, Big Sis. You killed Ramon. I didn't know he'd die from fright! So what are we going to do now? - It hurts! It hurts! - How can we now possess him? Maybe we can bring him back. But were not God. Were just ghosts. Ghosts. Anya, you are the solution. Use your remaining powers from the fake spirit mediums to revive Ramon. But if she does that... she won't be able to possess Ramon's body anymore. Does that mean I won't be able to play anymore? This won't take long. Everything will end soon. We have to revive Ramon because he is the only one who can help us. Call the priest! Call the priest! Fine. Mom! Why didn't you wake me up? Anna's going to kill me. And why aren't you guys dressed? I'll go ahead! Stay here! Anna! Anna! Stay there! Anna! Anna Im here! Don Demetrio... Ive come here to ask for Anna s hand in marriage Here's my fist! Go! Put him inside the car! Hurry! Go! Son? Ramon? Son? Son, what happened to you? Dad, are you here to fetch me? What are you saying, son? Who did this to you? Ramon! Son... Son! Son! Son! You are despicable Demetrio! It's so easy for you to take a life. I volunteer. Son? You're'alive! You're alive! Dad, you're dead! You died already! What are you saying? I'm still alive. You can feel me hugging you. You can see me crying. Look. Dad, you're alive. Dad! Dad! Mom, tell me the truth! Is dad dead or alive? Ramon, what happened to you? I got beaten up. Wasn't it in the news? Answer my question! Ramon you're toeing the line! Knock first before you enter! Come in! Mom, tell me the truth! Is dad dead or alive? He's been dead a long time. I told you, didn't I? He became a seaman, then his ship sank. A shark ate him. His body was never found. That's not true! It is! Dad is alive! He's dead! In fact, he's behind me right now. Hi, children! Yes, Im alive. Mom! You lied to us for so long. I thought you said it's bad to lie, Grandma? I'm not walking out because Im not part of the family. So... I'm staying here. Mom? Since I was a kid, I thought dad was a ghost. I grew up a coward. Afraid... Anxious? with no balls. All along I shouldn't have been scared... because there's nothing to be scared about. Mom, please stop eating rice every time you feel guilty! Ramon, your father cheated on me. He left us. My rage made me hit him hard. But even after I had beaten him up... it still hurts. It hurts here. So, to punish him I told all of you that he was dead. But I came back. Because your mistress left you! I loved your father. But he broke my heart. He made me believe in forever, only to be told that forever does not exist. And I hated him for that... because he pained me so deeply. All my life, I was led to believe a lie. Everything was a lie. A lie, everything was! I'm so sorry, son. Mom, why are we talking in English? Because it's a dramatic scene. The lines sound better in English. Do you still love me, Belen? No, Anding. I do not love you anymore. But you can still be a father to our children. Thank you. I feel for you. If Berting left us for another woman... I would have killed him as well. Thank you, Marie. You're welcome... Mom. This is the first time you called me "mom", my child. This was given to me by your grandfather. It protected us from vampires. It's also effective against ghosts. As long as youre wearing that, they cannot possess you. Thanks, dad! Be brave, Ramon. Don't be like me, a coward. But now I have realized that there was nothing to fear but fear itself. It's better to be possessed by spirits than to be conquered by fear... because spirits can be exorcised by priests... But fear can only be defeated by you. You're right, dad. I need to overcome my fear before I can marry Anna. But, of course. You cannot love while you are still living in fear. Why is that? Because it takes courage to love. Wow, dad! You speak English. Yeah. Your mom is right. Dramatic lines sound better in English. Show yourselves to me! I'm not afraid anymore Show yourselves! Come on! Show yourselves! Psst" Babe... Why do you look like that? I got stomachaches from our previous costumes. And this is how we want to look like when we finally get buried. What do you want from me? All we want is... Hey! Hey! Stay back! Is justice for the super ugly way we were murdered. Come on, bro. It's so hard to impress the chicks when you look like a zombie. All I want is to fall in love like you. Me, what I want is simple. I just want a playmate, but he killed me. Who? Don Demetrio! What?! Call the police. Dig up our bodies and bring them to the authorities! Four bodies were found. Three adults and one child. They were all gunned down. Four? But there's only three of them? Who's the fourth one? Madame, you have guests. Let them in. What are you doing here? Anna, there is something you should know. Sir... Miss... MY friend! What brings you here? How are you, my friend? Demetrio Demetrio, we have a warrant of arrest for the murder... of Anastacio Balbitero Jr., Dado Balbitero, Anya Balbitero... and Arnel Ignacio Jr. My father? My friend... Yes. It pains me to tell you... that the fourth body we found at the crime scene is your father... - Arnel Ignacio Jr. - My father! You, heartless criminal! Monster! Demetrio Demetrio! I hate you! You're the killer of my father, Arnel Ignacio Jr.! You are evil! I wish you death! Anna! Anna! Anna! I am so sorry. I swore to your father, on his grave, that I would take care of you. That I would treat you like my own daughter. All my life I was led to believe a lie! Everything was a lie! A lie, everything was! It really does sound better in English. How dare you! How dare you! All my life I was led to be- Enough! We re taking him to the precinct. Demetrio Demetrio, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. Anna... What?! It's still closed. Here. Vhong diggy diggy diggy Vhong diggy diggy diggy Vhong diggy diggy... "w: flaw flaw hone-u... At last, justice has prevailed! You are the devil, Demetrio!

Uncle Ramon, Grandma Belen is missing What do you mean? She was taken. She usually wakes up at 5:30 AM. But ifs already 7:30 AM. We didn't make it to school, and that's very unusual. We should report this to the police! Bro, bro! I talked to the night watch. They saw a Mexican-looking fellow come out of our house last night. My father! Your father? My adoptive father! Where is mom? Check the earthen jar. She was taken to an abandoned building. An abandoned building? Yes. In an abandoned building. That's where she was taken. Why in an abandoned building? All kidnapped victims are taken there. From Mara, to Marimar, to Claudine, even Kristine Hermosa. Everyone who's been kidnapped is taken there. Not in a swimming pool... Not in an apartment, or a condo. Shes in an abandoned building for sure. Good evening, Ma'am Anna, Miss Bless! Where's my father? I can't tell you. Hes inside... with the kidnap victim. He has been waiting for you. And Ramon as well. You want to get hurt before giving a straight answer? Father! Father! Take care, Anna! Arent you tired of being a goon? No! Where is your girlfriend?

Tell me you did! Yes! How does it feel... to have the people you killed haunting you now? Innocent people that you killed without mercy? What if he dies instead?! You won t give it to me?! You're it! You, heartless monster! She's just a child! You will soon feel the wrath of Anastasio Balbitero Jr.! Oh, really? Why arent you laughing?! Laugh! Laugh!

Dont you dare touch me! Raise your hand! Raise your other hand! Raise your foot! Raise your other foot! And raise your- Surprise! I dare you. Shoot my hand! Go ahead and shoot! I will take you to your grave! Chemerut, that wasn't part of the deal! I will take you to your grave! Shut up! I will take him to his grave! You can't do that, Chemerut! You can't! Damn it! This one is for Dadu! Goodie! Hi! Im already here! This one is for Anya! And this one is for me! Faster! Let me go Come on! Just bring the chair with you. Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up Hurry! - Hurry up! - The chair is heavy can't you see?! Do you still remember what you did to us? You forced me to give you our land! Now, it is you who will die! And I... myself... myself... ...myself... Stop it, Chemerut! Myself... myself... myself... Stop it, Ramon! Wait, I'm Ramon! Stop it, Chemerut! Myself... myself... myself... Myself... will bury your corpse! What did you do?! I know my father's sins are grave... but it is not up to us to sentence him to death. Ramon! Ouch! That hurts! Why did you eject me from your body?! I'm not finished with Demetrio! Take off that rosary! He has to die! Sorry, Chemerut. I cant do it. What do you mean you cant do it?! You're a coward! Yes, Im a coward... but not this time. You make me braver. And I promise you will get the justice you deserve. I will make sure Don Demetrio goes to jail. Chemerut, I want to be braver... but not in the way you want me to, by killing a person. That's not me. I hope you understand, Chemerut. Sis... I think this is enough. Weve used Ramon enough. Big Sis, I'm okay with just seeing him behind bars. I'm so proud of you! You're so brave! Youre my hero! Excuse me. Can I make a request? Can you, at least bury us first? Move it! I can't believe you did that! Wipe it off. That tastes rotten. Thank you so much, Ramon. We owe you a lot for what you did for us. Don't worry. One day, we will come back to return the favor. Oh, no need. No need. I'm good. I'm good. No, I insist. No, please dont. Goodbye, bro. I hope you and Anna will have some sexy time someday. I pray for that. Bye bye! - Anna! - Does she have to step on us?! Ouch! Ouch! My child... Dad... I miss you so much. Please, don't go. Stay with me. I miss you too, Anna. You may not see me but I am with you every single day. One day, we will be together again. But for now live your life with Ramon. I like him. Cheers! I love you, my child. I love you too, dad.
