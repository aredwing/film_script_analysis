 

                        Tyler... Can you hear me, Tyler? Tyler. Tyler, lovey? Can you hear it? Can you hear it calling? Can you hear how lonely? We couldn't block it out. # Tyler # Tyler! Tyler! Can you hear me, man? Tyler, can you hear me? Look at this mess. I'm not reinstalling this shit. Shut up, Bob. Mrs. Crawley? Tyler? Hello? Tyler? Christ. Hey, g-guys! Guys, get up here! Aw, fuck. Is she dead? I don't know. - She take all of these? - Aw, fuck. I'm gonna call 911. - Mrs. Crawley? - Pauline? - God... - Do we do mouth-to-mouth? The phones in pieces! Where's a cell? Clear her airway first. No! She said to block the door! She said to block it! So get away from her! Tyler, what... What is going on? You shouldn't have come here. How did you get in here? Your mom still leaves a key out. She opened the door! The key... with the key! And she just... she got so scared. Okay, hey. I'm gonna take that from you, okay? 'Cause you're being a fucking nut. - A keyhole! - Agh! Keyhole! Turn it, Chris! You have to turn the key, Chris! You have to lock it out, or it'll get you too! Agh! Oh, Mommy. I tried for you. I tried to block the door. I tried to make it stop. # I became awake # # From a very dark place # # A patchwork of fear # # Of poorly conceived ideas # # With a blister of water # # The mark of working hands # # Ready to catch or cut # # The senses aligned # # The animal urgency # # And voices picked up # # Going over the static # So, uh... I waited. Yeah? I thought you were picking me up at the airport. # I became awake # At this hour, we have rain in low-lying areas. Inland, expect 10 to 20 centimeters of snow, clearing overnight with highs of 0, lows of minus 4. Your extended outlook, plus news headlines and sports coming up. - What up, buddy? - Stop. You're fine. # All awake, ooh # # I became awake # # I thought I was sleeping # # But I was only forming # # A structure with no ceiling # # With words like a runway # I'm just waiting for some old friends who are coming. My signing sucks now? Thank you. You understand these, though, right? Yeah. # Now I am light # # All awake # # All awake # # All awake # Sorry, gents. Needed to get my tip-out. Boom! How are you, boys? Good. What up? What up? So we're really doing this. Hey. No refund on rentals. Hanging out at Pauline's Retreat, like we're kids again? Could fix us up. Whoo! Huggs fell off! What are you doing? Yeah, I, uh... I got to take a piss. Got the bladder of a little girl. We're almost there. Look, just take it in. I'll walk. What do you think, Mom? Three out of four ain't bad. Get out! Come on! Oh, God. Hoo! There we go. How did Pauline ever do this? Little Jimmy. I'm sure you got somebody on the payroll who could chop that for you. Yeah, I'm not doing that well. Not here, either. It's these friggin' gloves. I can't get a grip. Yeah, that's probably it. So... Where's Tyler? He, uh... he called down. Yeah? He's getting her ready. We just thought we'd give him some space. Yeah. So how's married life for you? Good. It's good, yeah. It's been a while for you two. How's all that coming along? Let's have a couple drinks first. Huggs, right here! Oh... - Come on, buddy! - Yeah! Number 81! Whoo! Do I really still have to call him "Bobcat"? Such a douche. Come on. He's not a douche. He's my cousin. He's mellowed. He's a family man. Oh, poor family. Remember the time that... He ate an entire block of butter up here? Sick! That was the best 5 bucks I ever bet. Hey, Chris! Heads up! Nice throw, Montana. So, uh, you gonna take your bag in, Opie, or what? Oh, no, please. After you, Cocktail. Ladies first, I insist. Hey. Hey. You just want to back up a little bit, please? Take that. Whoa! Guys, guys! Ashes! Ashes! We all fall down. You gone crazy again? Um, day's getting short, so I should probably get going. You don't mind me doing this part on my own? No. Just a regular key, though, right? Yeah, just a regular key. You take her up to the beacon tower. You come back. We're gonna have some fun. Pauline's winter wake. Thanks for making it up here, guys. Like, lots. Aw, fuck, man! Come on! What? I'm just giving his snow angel a smiley face. I think he looks pretty good. I think he looks like Ty. Yeah, well, that's 'cause you're lucky and you got to miss the whole thing. Would you have tackled him? 'Cause I think you would have shit yourself. Okay. Douche, douche. Woodpile. So then what are we, uh, watching for? Apparently... this is what the doctor says... gift wrapping his feces and presenting it to his loved ones on their pillows at night. I don't know, Jim. He did all the paranoid classics: Delusions, hearing weird voices, seeing shit in the TV static. Stabbing all his friends a bit. The doctor said that it was reactive, that when he saw Pauline OD that he just kind of blew a circuit, you know? How you doing back there, Huggsy? You need a break yet? A... okay. What happened to him is what happened to her. Just bad wiring. Like mother, like son. Come on, man. Look, he wants another chance, right? With his best friend. Oh, fuck. Bye, Mom. Shit. I'm not really seeing this. I guess she's on the breeze now, huh? You want to talk about it? I forgot how good you got on that. Hey, Ty. Don't tell anyone, but you've always been my favorite. Bet you could use this. I'm unleaded now, remember? Doctor's orders. Yeah, but tonight's a wake, buddy. Katie? Katie, can you hear me? Yes, I will be back for your surge. For your... For your window. Yes, I'll be back. Disconnect that! Boys' weekend! No, it's Bob. Yeah, he hasn't changed. Still an idiot. Ty? Y... yeah? You still drinking the lame and juice? Yeah. Okay, all right. So what? If you can't make her a baby, then she's just gonna turn you into one? No, no. I mean, she's great. And I'm... I'm fucking lucky. You are. She is beautiful. See, now, that's why I haven't told her yet, that it's me, you know, shooting blanks. Jesus, Jim. 'Cause I'm afraid she's gonna leave me. Don't tell those guys, though, eh? No, sure. I can't believe I still have a reason to be jealous of Bobcat. This is just our backyard. That's Bruce, our cat. Oh, fuck. Can't we come up here one friggin' time without you... Hey, hey! I'd get this shit bronzed if I could, all right? Pauline didn't tape over a single thing. It's our whole fucking lives. Yeah, well, the top-loading part, at least. That was my fucking season. That was your fucking hair. You looked like David Lee Roth. What happened to those glory days, huh? What's that supposed to mean? Look, baldness is a sign of virility, bitches. I got the kids to prove it. How did we get from there to here so quick? If you got an interception, then all I am saying is that it is unrecorded in any scorebook that is... Unrecorded? Show me. I'd love to see it. # Forever # # I told her # # I'm not that kind of guy # # She said we'd communicate # # Much better # # If my dial-up was Wi-Fi # All right. # She drives me crazy # # With her blogs and vlogs # # Her Skypes and Twitters and URLs # # Guess I'll always be a top-loading VCR # # In this motherfucking Bluetooth world # Fuck, yeah. And here we go. Whoo! Come on now, Chris. It's just those old strings, Chrissy. Yeah. I'm gonna... gonna go wash these. I thought of that before I came down and brought a new set. And that's 'cause... You're my favorite. Of course. I believe it's time for more football. Bob, we've been watching football for three hours. I don't care. - Really? - Yeah. Bob, look, no. I've watched your... - Guys! - Please! Much love. Just let me pick one. No way, man. It's a football-only VCR. - You know the rules. - Really? I am sitting out there with strangers. Chris, listen, I... No, Ty, wait. Let me go first. There's something that I want to talk to you about. They wouldn't even let me go to her funeral. Now I'm wrecking this one too. All I can say is that, that part of Mom that was always Mom would never hurt me. Then she did this. And then I don't remember much. I never thought I could hurt you, and I did. Chicks dig scars. We look like cowboys now. Right. But I am still me, you know? That's what these pills are for. They're not supposed to remind you that I... I'm crazy but that I'm good now. Even in the bin, I tried to get them to hear that. My shrink... her name's Megan... she would give me all these mental checks I could do, like counting down sevens and stuff, but I'd look around at these other guys. One guy's, like, spinning hankies like they're propellers. Another guy's rocking back and forth, clapping, going, "Megan, Megan, Megan, Megan, Megan, Megan, Meg"... So I stop her. I stop her. And I go, "Listen, you got to get me out of here. " And she tells me I'm sick. And I go, "Yeah, I know. But these motherfuckers are crazy!" You're a piece of shit. That was a setup. Maybe. Maybe not. But there'd be days where I'd think, I got to hold on to that stuff for when I'm with the guys. And then there were other days where I'd wonder, why the hell would you give me a second chance? I'm not going back there. I promise. Well, enough of this depressing shit. This was supposed to be a funeral. You were gonna tell me something before? I was just gonna do a toast. To the only mom who let us play monster tag at 2:00 in the morning. Or let us eat a bowl of Cheezies with milk on them. It tastes like Kraft Dinner. We got away with murder, man. She was one of the good ones, Pauline. An empty glass is bad luck, Ty. Just, gentle. To Pauline. To Pauline. Love you, Mom. So who bunks upstairs, and who gets the floor? - I'm going... - Boom. - All right. - In. - Oh! - Boom! So, what, you just thought that it was gonna be a big celebration when we came out here? I'm with Ev, all right? The five of us come up here for a boys' weekend, and it's couples therapy? Don't I get enough of that in couples therapy? Hey, look, did Ev booze Tyler up? Like, more than the once? Come on. Man, he is just pushing his luck. How about you? It looked like you were gonna tell Tyler you're moving. How did you know that? Come on. Your mom talks to my mom. They're gossipy bitches. I don't know. I just feel like I need to get on a new path, you know? Like I missed a connection somewhere or... I wouldn't tell him. He'll lose it. I'm allowed to move. I mean, look at Jim. Look how it changed his game. Don't you mean "Mr. Huggan"? Fuck. You know, at least the old Huggsy knew his place. Now we got to deal with this asshole? Ah, Bobby, that's in your head. Maybe. But you need to be careful what's in Ty's. Look, man, all I'm trying to say is that if you're gonna tell him you're moving, you better move quick. Like, run. Shut up. Oof. Hey, Bobby. Yeah? I got an idea. Minus 7 is... Is 86. Okay. Back to the retreat. Hello? Mom? Holy... Jesus. So you went out last night. I can't lie, man. I'm not feeling too good. Yeah, well, we're all going through stuff, Ty. And you all keep telling me about it. Then you could tell me yours. I mean, I deserve both barrels. All right. Both barrels, then. This is arthritic now. I'm old before my time. And I still don't know what I'm gonna be when I grow up. You know, I thought that, uh, this was finally it. And now, rehab done, and I am back to the back of the line. What's sign language for "I'm sorry"? But now you're not feeling so good? I think I'm still seeing stuff. What did you see? I know I've got no right, but would you just come with me? Please. Just you. Hey, listen to me, Ty. Ev was slipping booze into your drink all night. Why didn't you tell me that straight off? Look, it was a shithead thing for him to do, and, hey, we got back at him for it. I... I saw... a shape, in the woods, a person. Ty. Meds? Booze? You didn't see anything. Look, we're coming out. I've been waiting years for you two to come out. Ty, after breakfast, I will go with you, okay? It's all yours. Were you guys tossing some salad in here? Hey, has he noticed yet? No. Shh. Oh, you cock-knockers! How am I supposed to make tips? This is some juvenile bullshit, boys. An eyebrow for an eye. Seems like I'm nursing a hangover. See, I thought that this was a boys' weekend, not a little boys' weekend. Just a little something for my brain to idle. It's not idling, Jim. It's reverse. Jesus, hanging out with, "Katie, did you pack my puzzles?" And... "I'm unleaded now, remember? "Doctor's orders. I can't drink anything. " Ev, Ty had nothing to do with this. No? I went for a walk. Great. We all came up here for you, and you want to be alone, in the dark, in the woods. Well, as long as everyone else is comfortable with that. I got it. I don't know why I always have to be the one... You guys have to stare in the face of some shit. Listen, Ev. I need you to have my back. With what? I'm nervous. Me too. Why are we doing this? Cause Chris would do it for us. Shut the fuck up. All right, Jim? Yes. Just keep walking. You'll know it when you get there. Trust me. What am I supposed to say, Ty? Am I in the wrong place? This is the part where I tell you that I'm not crazy. It was... It was a box. I was in a... a box. I don't follow you. It was around me, but it wasn't there. An invisible box? It blocked the weather. Oh, fuck, listen to me! Hard not to! Needed some backup, did you? Just in case? All for one and one for all, huh? You want to show him something? We're not seeing very much. Well, whatever it was, maybe you're its favorite. Holy shit... What is this? Can you see it? Can you see it? Do you smell crossed wires? Yeah. Can you hear it? I'm not dreaming? You guys are here? Yeah, we're here. You don't know what it's like to feel your mind stab you in the back. I came out here, and I see this thing... this crazy thing... what was I supposed to think? Anybody got a Kleenex? No, I'll be okay now. I just thought I was alone. What is this? Did we discover something? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what this is. Come on, Telecom, you're supposed to be the brain here. You're not scared? No, man! I am pumped! Look, Ty, I'm sorry I didn't believe you. My track record's not that great. But it's not the same anymore. It was a room, but now it's turned into a hallway, like a corridor. I'm gonna drive through it. What's that supposed to prove? That I'm not a scientist? No! Wait, wait! Well, we might be hallucinating, but I doubt the Ski-Doo is. Guys, check this out! Nice one, genius. Did you pay for these rentals? That was the edge. Now it seems more like the middle. When did it get bigger? When Ev came back? I didn't see it happen. It doesn't seem to get any bigger this way, but that way... Oh, my God. I didn't break it, Bobby. The magic force field broke it. Yeah, well, who's gonna fix it? Huh? Let me call Katie. Or not. Seriously, this is so crazy. Uh, no offense to Ty. Sorry. So machines don't like it. Like going into a tunnel or something. Look, guys, wait a minute. Come here. Anyone else see that radio tower? It lines up with the end like an end post. Yeah. The tower. It's, uh, north by south. So what can we do with this, Jimmy? I mean, you know people, big people. Uh, "do"? Can we, like, slap a finder's fee on it or something? I thought you were a cowboy. I work in a fucking bar. If there's a chance here, I'm gonna get me mine. I mean... People go to hot springs. They... they go to oxygen bars. I do feel good. I feel all cleared out. I was about to say the same thing. You can hear me? Yeah, why wouldn't we? Fuck! We are gonna be on the cover of National Geographic, boys! Whoo! I think we should get out of here. What? Why? I think we should leave this alone. Wait, Ty. Now, when you go, it goes. I mean, that seems to be the drill, right? Well, looks like we all made a new friend. Guys, please. Come back to the cabin. We'll figure out what to do. Please. Oh, shit! Shit. I got a nosebleed. God damn it. It's no worse than a playground fight, come on. Oh! Stop. Stop! Don't be a pussy, Jim. Hey, Ev! Fine. You guys go back. Wash up, whatever. I'm gonna stay. Why? To stake our claim. Change up with me in a couple hours. It's incredible, boys! What we always wanted. Bob, I want to go. No more football games. I'm not. I don't know. Maybe it's like the northern lights or Bermuda Triangle. Except that it's a rectangle. And it doubles every time we go in there. How does it do that? How does it do anything? I mean, I don't know. I mean, somehow, we must be stimulating its growth. Right? Sort of like Bob's hair pills. Hey, yeah. You've been looking in my shave kit. What kind of a bitch move is that? Man, don't be paranoid. I'm just ripping on you some. Apparently, that's what we do, right? Yeah, well, how did you know? Well, I thought we all knew. You're gonna pay for it, science fair. Oh, what? You gonna rough me around too? Oh, these really are the glory days. Whoa, whoa, time-out! Guys, we don't know what this thing is. We don't know why it's getting longer. Let's put our heads together here. Come on. Where are you? I went out. Something fell. It was a little star. But there was such a sound. I had to see if it hit the beacon. And something had burned there. There were so many ashes. Tyler, lovey? I breathed in a door. And now I can't lock it. It's open, and it's in there. It's in my head. It's small, but... Oh, lovey. Oh, the things that it's opened me to. Twinkle, twinkle, little star. How I wonder what you are. Twinkle, twinkle, little star. How I wonder what you are. Guys, how long has this thing been out here? I knew something was telling me to find it. She called it a door, but you called it a corridor. Mom said a lot of things on a lot of tapes. She was nuts. Did you ever ask yourself why? Reverse that doubling out there, and it could have been pretty fucking small for a pretty long time. I'm packing my shit to go. I can't hear this. I can hear you. Welcome to the oxygen bar. If you seriously think Mom was crazy 'cause of that place in her head, like a tumor, then why am I crazy? Maybe you're not. Then why did that happen? Maybe it needed to. To give us a shove. Ty... How did I get stuck working at the same fucking school that we all graduated from? Maybe now we get to look to the future because the future came to get us. It's almost time to switch up with Ev. Who gets next shift? Hello! Somebody there? That's a good way to get yourself killed. Could have taken your head off. I never use it anyway. Thanks for letting me keep it, though. What are you doing, Huggs? Don't call me Huggs anymore, all right? It's Jim. Seriously. I heard the snowmobile protesting. Where'd you leave 'er? What, are you hunting bear? Bear hibernate during the winter, son. This is for deer. You don't know much about hunting, do you? The girls like me, though. Yeah, well... It's the women that like me. Don't tell the wife. Lee. Lee Sheppard. My boss' name is Lee. Ah, he must be one of the good guys. He's a she. You trying to be funny? No, sir. We're just a few guys out here, camping, trying to cheer our buddy up. They the ones that took your eyebrow? Yeah. Stupid prank. I don't suppose any of them know how to fix a sled either. We're weekend warriors. Hmm, no shit. Here, I'll kick 'er up the arse for ya. No, it's, uh... it's really okay. Thank you, though. No offense, son, but you seem a mite hopeless. Hey, hey, hey. You been playing in the snow here? Out of nowhere, this thing is calling us. We make that place exist, Ty, just by being there. That makes us a part of something. You sound like my paranoid nightmares. Oh... Oh, my Lord. What if we caught something in there? What, like the flu? Come on, Ty. But we could still treat it. If we had to. Ty, those are in the past. How about we start thinking about what happens next, how we get a second chance out here? Chris, that place is damaging us. Chris! That's a nasty scar. Cut myself shaving. No, you didn't, Everett. I didn't tell you my name. Now, I know you. I know all of you. This is really something, Everett. This... this is... Ours. My boss, Lee? I fucked her too. I can hear you. You don't get to tell anybody what you saw. Hi. Look at you guys. Bobcat! Jim! Come on. It's time to go. It's getting a little late, Ty. I don't think we're going anywhere tonight. Then you got to do something for me. You got to take one of my blockers. Why would we do that? I'm the only one not bleeding. Tell me why. Come on. It's just like a playground fight. No, it's not. Take one, please. I dare you. A dare? Well, it isn't exactly a block of butter, Ty, is it? Jesus. All right. Give them to me. Hey, Ev. We were just about to change up with you. Is that blood? Oh, it must be my nose again. It's probably because of the cold. But you're feeling... Good. Yeah, real good. I had a real moment out there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We should tell you what we were thinking in here... Thinking, thinking, thinking, Jim. How are we gonna turn you into a man of action? Has it changed? Has it grown? All secrets will out, Ty. And I got a good one about you. Hey, Ev, check this out. It's a tape we found of Pauline. Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don't want to see that again! Tyler, lovey. I went... Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Whoa. It changed. Because I made it stronger. What? You think this is... The place. I think it's talking to me. That's signing. It's giving me a sign. What's it saying? Just, "connect. " Connect, connect, connect. Wait, no. Did this fuck up the rest of my tapes? Oh, yeah, because that is real important right now. What's that supposed to mean? Well, it means, who gives a shit? You want a smack in the mouth? Something bigger is happening here! No, no, no, you're right. You're right. Maybe the time has come for us to set aside all these childish things, Bobcat. Says the guy who can't come at all. What did you just say? You don't know what to do with that wife of yours, do you... Huggsy? Do you need me to knock her up for ya? Your wheels spin so fast, but the rest of you is just shooting blanks. Oh, shit. Thanks a lot, fucker. I swear to God. I didn't say anything. Oh, sure! Well, I guess you're blood, so... Look! I didn't! I don't know how I knew. I thought we all knew. This is what's happening! The corridor is changing our minds! You know what? You don't even deserve a kid. You are a kid. You never got past high school football, you big bald baby! Would you just listen to me? Look, why shouldn't that place cross our wires like it did with the snowmobile or your cell phone? Look, it's opening up some sort of pathway out there, right? Well, what if it's opening up a pathway in here too? It's driving us out of our minds and into everyone else's. And the one that I have to share is sick. Do you really want to believe that, Ty, that now we're all just like you? No! No, I just... I just want you to take one of my pills. They'll block this out. That's what they do. No, hey! Don't! You gonna jump him again? After everything you did? I don't want to block it out. Look at how stuck we all are. Got to make a change. I know all about you, Ty. I know that you killed your own mom. What? Pauline told me, out in the woods. We got to face our old shit, guys. When we waked her, we waked her good. We got to grow up. Ashes to ashes, Ty. You're the one who brought it back here, in the urn. And you brought it all of us. Okay. Guys, we can't handle this. Guys. It's okay. The corridor is a ray, the first line of a grid. Ashes. - Of a web. - Ashes. Of a worldwide web. We all fall down. Of a universe-wide web. It needs to reach out and touch somebody. Huggs, I love you. But Ev's right. You think too much. Ha! That's for my eyebrow, bro. That's for Bobcat. Oh, yeah! - Oh, shit! - Oh! I am just trying to mend some fences here. Show much love to you both. It's in my eyes. I did this for you, Jimmy, to fix your blanks. Baldness is a sign of virility. Yes. Intervention! We're all getting real! I've listened to you all for so long, and I've never done a thing about it! Yes! Yes! There you go, cuz! Yeah! You don't look a day over 16! I'm wearing a rug. It's a... it's a Huggs-rug! That's just a start, number 81! We're gonna put you back together. We are gonna put you back in the game! That's right, Jim. That's right, baby. Shake it off. I'm proud of you. I'm proud. We have to get you help. We have to get you help! Don't worry about it, man. Just ripping on me some. That's what we do. What did you do? You crazy fucks! Turn the key now, Tyler. You girls breaking up? I'm gonna lock you back in the bin. And when you're done hiding behind your pills, then you can come out and play. Tough love, Ty. You tell me that you killed your mom, and I'm gonna stop what I'm doing. What are you doing? Mending fences. Showing much love. Like Chris said. Katie? I can't reach you. Come on, Jim, you always were the brain, but now you got to man up. I'll try to, Ev. I will. Sampson! Out of the mirror. We're gonna do a little group therapy. Fucking getaway weekend, and I can't get away from therapy. You know, my fucking wife... Won't recognize you when we're done. This is gonna be more like a body shop. So let's get you on the hoist! We're gonna get you back in fighting trim! Come on, Jimmy. One day I look up, and I was so old. You know, my wife shits out these babies, and she gets so old. You might as well bring the whole box. Okay. Jim, Jim. Please, let me out of here, Jim. Fucking invisible man. Let me out, Jim. Jim? Please. Jim! No! Come on, Jimmy. That's it, Jim! Get up there! Hit him like I did! Come on! Minus 7 is 93. And minus 7 is 86! Minus 7 is 79! So is this happening, Ty? Or is your mind just stabbing you in the back again? Everybody, now, like your shrink said: Got anything you want to say to me, Ty? Please, Ev, stop it! Stop hurting him! Stop hurting him! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Did your mother die screaming? She sound like this? Megan, Megan, Megan, Megan, Megan, Megan, Megan. Do you want... want to get started? # Tyler # # Turn the lights back on # Turn 'em on yourself! I threw the fuses outside! Jim? Jim? Ev? Bob? Bobcat? Look what they did to you. Tough love. Just guys hanging out. Okay, come on. I'm gonna take you home. I'm dying. Future didn't... didn't want me, buddy. Corridor's coming, before it goes to the... to the city. Tyler? I just got to tell you something. What? Can you hear it calling, lovey? Couldn't block it out. Games in the dark. Bob's dead! He's dead! Marco. Polo! Monster tag. Like when we were kids. I don't blame you for what you did to Pauline. I mean, she could be very clingy. I didn't do anything! Get away. I guess it was because of her mind, you know, that she needed to hold on to you so tightly. But, oh, my God, Ty. Your entire adult life, living in her basement. I mean, that must have been so... Smothering. Shh, shh. This is what friends are for. Yeah, hey, hey, we're gonna get real now. We're gonna fix you. Hold him, Jimmy! Come on. What do you have to live for? Huh? Psych wards? Pity? We're gonna set you free. My path is finally showing itself to me. What did you do to that hunter? Protected our future. I don't want to see these things. But you're starting to, aren't you? Those pills of yours are wearing off. The corridor has been looking for me all along, to make it stronger, to take it where it's going. You never told me how clear it made things, Ty. How simple. All these years, taking shit off customers, banging my boss for an open mic slot when I should have just beat her to death instead. Look what it's done to us in a couple of hours! It's only gonna get worse when it gets somewhere! Jim! Connect the dots! Fucking corridors! Please think of Katie. Jimmy. You pull it together, Jim. What, the wife didn't pack the iron pills? Pull it together, Jimmy! I'm trying to, Ev. I just... Well, that's disappointing. You know, Ty, I really thought you'd be the next to go. I didn't think you'd last this long. But that's good. It shows that you want to feel alive. You know, we... we never got our test... no great war, no frontier to tame. But you be glad, Ty, because I'm gonna give you yours right now. I'm gonna shoot someone, and you are gonna tell me who. No way. See, I love both of these guys, so it's gonna be like you pulled the trigger. Now, you tell me! Can you feel that pull? You are gonna pick someone, or I'm gonna kill you. So who is it gonna be? Lucky Huggs with the great job and spectacular wife or your little girlfriend Chris? Who is it gonna be? Ev. Ev, wait, not me. I'm talking to Tyler now! I'm helping him get real. You tell me the truth about Pauline. Rock! Mom overdosed on pills she never should have stopped taking. That's the whole story. Paper! I don't know what you want me to say! Scissors! Please don't point that at me. Mom... she cut my face open, and then I don't remember anything until I woke up... Rock! - In the fucking bin! - Paper! They put me in restraints because of what I did to you! Scissors! Not because of what I did to her! That's not what she told me, Ty! Can I just have a goddamn drink? Well, now you're talking. Somebody help me. A toast. To our discovery. To our rite of passage. Please, don't let this happen. I just want to go back home. I came here for you. I can't do this. I know how this sounds, but I could pay you. He isn't even awake. Please, just don't say my name. Better say something. Oh, my God. Say something! I want answers! Ev, shoot Ty! Jim! Jim! Well, you're not shootin' blanks anymore! Whoo! You always were my favorite, Jim. My friend, for you. Stop! You feed it thoughts of dead cells. But it calls for the living. Chris... You think you know what it wants. It talks to me. You listen, but you do not hear. I can speak for it. Help translate it further. I can be its living cell. Do you understand that? We are killing each other. Do you understand that? The corridor. It's a probe. It's a... seeker. It's... It's searching, like we all are. And you think you know what for. Pure connection. These are my delusions, Chris. They're not yours. Think what you sound like. A false prophet. And yet I speak the word. Chris, come back! A little male bonding. This place is really putting us on the same wavelength now, Ty. Your pill's dying. You can't block it out anymore. Welcome home. We're not really here. Maybe you never left. No... oof! Where are we going, Ty? Where are we going, huh? Where we going? Huh? Huh? Huh? You can't keep running from it, man. You can't keep running. You know why? 'Cause, all corridors lead back to your room. Now, you take a good, real look. You're driving me crazy! You're driving me crazy! Shut up! Shut up! How could I forget this? Shut up! What I did to you? And the truth shall lock you up! No. I said I'd never be in here again. We're not here. We're not really here. We still have to stop it! You can't stop the future, Ty. I drugged you! Oh, look at you now! I made a tough guy out of you! My pill is in your blood now, so think for yourself! Think! Think! Think! Think! Think! Think! Think! Ty! Ty! Ty! Enough! It's me! Fuck you, Ev. It's me. I know. Jim. Bobby. Oh, my God. What have I done? I wasn't trying to kill her. I wanted to kill that place inside her. We have to go get Chris. You'll never stop it. You'll never stop it, Ty. It grew up so fast. Better than we ever did. Ev, don't. None of this would have happened if you'd done this yourself. Hey! You gonna walk all the way to the big city? Can you hear me? Hey! I'm not letting you go. Not you. Everyone else is dead. Just connected now, to a path larger than themselves. Why can't you hear how lonely? Why can't you hear how it searches? I don't care! Chris, it took our friends! I am it. I am its word. I am its sound which will travel. And then you connect it to the world and everyone dies? What kind of fucking message is that? You don't get to know what it can do. You don't get to understand. If you're so in touch with it, then tell me something. Tell me. What was the last thing that I ever said to her? Good-bye. Chris! Tyler? Lovey? Can you hear me, Tyler? Tyler? Turn the key. Tyler, lovey, turn the key. Can you hear it calling? I'm ready to listen. You're driving me crazy! It was never her! It was always you! You have to disconnect! I won't block the door! I'll let you in me! Turn me instead, now that she's gone.
