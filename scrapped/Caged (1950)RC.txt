handle The Commissioner means your predecessor never quarreled with the staff My predecessor refused to regard criminals as human beings ve tried to change that attitude intend to keep on trying There is no place on my staff for matrons like Evelyn Harper Its too bad all this had to happen before she was fired Who said anything about firing her Why fire a political appointee just because of a minor difference between you and her Besides firing her wont do us any good Its this stink weve got to squelch How do you intend doing that can get Harper to take back what she said She can call it a mistake admit that she was hotheaded The directives Sam Well m coming to that At the same time well announce that these directives are to be put into effect immediately Directives The Commissioner has put it in the form of a memo to you Inmates who have been honor women will no longer be put in subordinate positions on the staff The proposed plan to allow occasional work outside the prison when merited by selected girls is denied as well as the proposed plan for educational You dont honestly think d consent to that Why d be betraying every man and woman working to free prisons from methods like yours to insulate them from the abuses of politicians cheap politicians Have respect for my position Mrs Benton wouldnt allow the Governor to speak to me like that Oh Fred Mrs Benton lets not lose our tempers Look we came here with the best intentions in the world hoping to get together with you to let this thing all blow over but you leave me with no alternative except to ask for your resignation If he asks for my resignation ll demand a public hearing Now just see here We can get together We can if you tear up those directives and fire Evelyn Harper That will clear my name and allow me to do the work that must be done around here Hell do nothing of the kind Then ll announce youve asked for my resignation and ll demand a public hearing The State allows me such a hearing and
