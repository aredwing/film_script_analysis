 

                        I love what I do. Do this every day if I could. It is what it is. I love the money. The girls are hot. I'm living a lifestyle. This is what I do. Some people work 9:00 to 5:00. If that's what you want to do, you can do that. I prefer getting my hair and makeup done, and looking pretty in front of a camera all day. This is what I do to make my money, to pay for school. I just want money and success. I have a daughter, so I'm trying to make a life for her. You know, we're out here just getting our money, and being beautiful. And a lot of people have a certain perception of video vixens, which is... My name is Lorie Walker and I'm 23 years old. What are three words, you would use to describe yourself? Three words I'd use to describe myself... Uh... Adventurous and... ...loving... and... ...afraid. Afraid. Afraid of what? The future. Isn't everyone? Lorie? - Lorie? - Hmm? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Are you sure? You look like you don't want to be here. - I'm... I'm here. - Good. Okay, take these books over there and put 'em on that shelf. Okay, all right. And, um... all these, too. Okay. Thank you. All these, baby, please. Thank you. - And Lorie? - Huh? Smile. Mmm, yes. Sweetie, that's crooked right there, okay? How is it crooked? Excuse me, do y'all sell bicycles? You're such an idiot. - What are you doing? - I know. What's up, Lo? Hey, don't... hey, don't. What are you doing here? I was in the area ballin' so I decided to come check on you. Oh, my gosh. How's your day going? - It's going. - Going? - Yeah. - That's cool. Wait, wait, wait, come here. You got a huge booger hanging out of your nose. I do? - I'm just messing with you. - Oh, my gosh. Why are you wreaking havoc? Excuse me. This is not a social hour. You can see your little boyfriend on your own time... No, no, no, we're just friends. Whatever you are. Okay, on that note, I'm gonna take off. But real quick, don't forget about my graduation dinner. - I'll be there, I'll be there. - Okay. - Lo, don't play me. - I won't forget. Don't forget, call me. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. He's a cutie. You know, all of that is crooked. You need to start again, okay? Okay, what... # Yeah # I just bought some new ice on my wrist # Yeah # I just bought me a brand-new fit # Yeah # I just buy some new shoes on a whim # Yeah # I got money I can buy me a okay # That's what you do when your money right # # That's what you do when your money right ## Damn, what's up, shorty?

You ain't all that anyway, stupid bitch. What?! Oh, my God. - Whose car is this? - It's mine. C.K. Just bought it for me. Navigation, leather seats, everything. He did not hold back nothing. And I know Nana don't like him, but you see how he does by me, you see he does good by me, you know? Tell Nana yet? Nope. What's wrong? Nothing. Lorie, you can't stay in this slump forever. You've got to move on. Stacy, I'm gonna talk to you later. All right. I love you. I love you, too. Get out. Go. Come on, now, before she come over here. I don't have time for her. Whose car is that? I don't know, Nana, you gotta ask her. Your sister needs to wake up and smell life.

And you just bought me a new Mercedes and I love it. - Man, here we go. - What? I love it. Mm-hmm. How was your day? It was fine. My day was stressful. Two of my students got into a big fight and I had to file a police report. Have you made a decision? I decided that I'm not gonna go back next semester. That wasn't... exactly an option. I know. We decided school was a priority, regardless of what happened. # Silent screams # # Shattered dreams and teardrops # # All there is are memories # # Dancing # # Oh # # What do I do now? # # Oh # # What about my dream? # # Is there any hope for me? # # Who or what can set me free? # # Free ## Lorie: God. I had to get out of there. Mm-hmm. You see why I dipped out. Hi, C.K. Okay, well, I'm doing good, too. He had a long day. Lorie? - Chloe, oh, my God! - Hi! How are you? I was literally just thinking about you the other day. - Really? - Yeah. Wow, you look exactly the same. Thank you, so do you. Are you still dancing? No, I did some music videos for a while, but I'm acting now. Well, what are you doing back here? My boyfriend's here shooting a music video. Baby, this is my friend Lorie. We went to high school together. - How you doing, Lorie? - Nice to meet you. Oh, and this is Shark. He's directing the video I told you about. How are you? - Nice to meet you. - Pleasure. I got us shots! I'm okay. You don't drink? - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Ahh! You know what? I think I'm gonna have one. - Yeah, you sure? - Yeah. To new beginnings. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Where you going? Yo, E! - I'm gonna call you back. - E! Where Melvin at, nigga? Where Melvin at, nigga? I think I'm gonna go back by my sister. Okay, it's good to see you again. You too. It was nice meeting you guys. - Say bye. - Nice to meet you. You tell your brother I'm out here. - So this is how it is? - Oh, it's been like that. Partner. Hey. Who are we looking at? Stacy: I don't think I've seen you have this much fun in a long time. That's because I haven't. Hey, I didn't know you were here. - Hi, Chloe. - How you doing? Long time no see. Yeah, you still peeling out fast, girl? Sometimes. Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? My gosh, I don't even know. You should come to the video shoot. Why? Because Shark thinks you're cute - and asked me to invite you. - No, no thanks. Why not? Because I... Stace, this music video director that I just met wants me to come down to a video shoot tomorrow. Well, is he cute? Actually, he's super-hot. Okay, so where is he? Right there. Oh, my God. - Yes, he is fine. - What do you think? You should come, it's gonna be fun. I... I don't want to go. - Shit, I do. - She does. I've never been to a music video before. We are definitely coming. Okay, well, Stacy, he didn't invite you. He invited you, so he invited me, okay. Put your number in my phone, I'll call you tomorrow and give you all the information, and then... you guys decide. - It's gonna be fun. - We're probably not gonna come. And we are definitely gonna be there. Okay, come. - See you tomorrow. - Stacy: We'll be there. - You're the worst. - We'll be there. You're the worst. Have some fun... dang. Good morning. Your dean called to check on you. Oh, that's nice of him. He also wanted to know if he can expect you back in the fall. He said he needed to know ASAP before summer's over. You already know the answer to that, Nana. Okay. - Stace, I feel crazy. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm uncomfortable. Can we just find Chloe and the director guy first, before you say you're uncomfortable? Please. Um... Oh, excuse me. Ladies, you're late... over there. How you doing, baby? You all right? What's your name? Oh, uh-uh, no. Oh, hell no. Excuse me! - Excuse me! - What happened? What the hell? Sorry, yeah, no. We're not here to be in the video, we're actually here to hang out with the director, 'cause he invited us, so we're not in all that. Oh, like every other girl, honey, okay? - Yeah, copy that. - Excuse me? Can you please tell the director that Lorie Walker is here to see him? After you guys get dressed we need all of our girls set-ready in ten minutes. Okay! I don't think you're hearing me correctly. I said, we're not here to shake our asses. We're here to see what the director... He invited us. So first of all, if you can't hear me correctly, - I can help you out with that. - Stace, Stace, Stace... So if you got a problem, yeah, you can keep it moving, keep it moving. No, this shit gets on my nerve. Every time somebody get a little authority, - I wanna feel my... - Okay, okay, Stacy. Stop looking over here, stupid. But you're making a scene. - I don't care, I don't care. - Okay, let's just go. No, I don't wanna go, I'm just saying... He's right there, he's right there. All I'm saying, can you see my point of view? - Who? - Ladies. Hi. - I'm glad you came. - Me too. This is Stacy. Hi, thank you for having us. Of course, of course. - Uh, Shark? - Yeah, bud? I got three redbones ready to get - butt-ass naked right now. - Put 'em over there. Put 'em in the pool. Oh, how y'all doing? - Good. - Fine. Put 'em in the pool. Good. Are you ready? Ready for what? To be on camera. Oh, no. I... I hadn't planned on getting on camera. Well, why not? - Hmm? - Go on. Because, I mean, it's... It's not really my thing and I don't have any clothes and it's just... - You don't need any clothes. - What? No, no. No, I didn't mean it that way. I mean, we have plenty of clothes for all of our featured models here, okay? Okay, well, I'm not a model, so... Follow me to wardrobe. - Come on. - Stacy, what's going on? Just wait 'til you see your sister. She looks incredible. Okay, but do you got her looking like the rest of these girls, 'cause... No, no, no, no, no, of course not. So you trying to get with my sister? Still trying to figure that one out. Well, let me just say something. Thank you. I'm her sister. And I'm crazy. Understood. Good. Oh, my gosh! Look at you, you look so pretty, sister. Oh, my gosh. I love it. - I feel so uncomfortable. - You shouldn't. Man: Shark, we're ready for you on set. All right, guys, let's get to set. Come on. These heels are so high I can barely walk. What are you gonna do? Who was that new bitch walking with Shark? Never seen her before. She's probably just fucking him to get a part in the video. Like you did? Lorie, these are my girls, Jessica, Taye and Bubbles. They're the girls I'm moving to LA with. - Hi. - Lip gloss. Oh, yeah, of course. Nice to meet y'all. So, you do videos, too? Oh, well, this is my first one. So you trying to get in the game? Not exactly, I... It's kind of just... I don't know. Like the experience. Oh, yeah, she was invited personally, by the director. And you just came along? And you cannot ask me a question. Cute. All right, ciao. Bye, girls. They really wanna get slapped.

You sure that this was your first video? Yeah. Yeah, I've never done anything like this before. I don't know what you're doing later, but a few of us are going out to dinner and I'd love it if you joined me. Lorie, girl, did you know you're getting paid for this? - I'm getting paid for this? - Yes. Of course you are. So, okay, let me ask you this. Is this video gonna be, like, on BET and MTV and everything? Of course it is. I only direct the best. Ooh! Girl, you about to blow up. So I was just asking Lorie if the two of you would like to join me for dinner tonight. I can't. I have to go to work early in the morning. I won't have you out too late. She's going. I can't go, but she can go. Stacy, you're my ride. I'll get you home nice and safe. See, he'll get you home nice and safe. Not a problem. - What's the deal? - Can I... I'm gonna borrow my sister just for a second. Stacy, what are you doing? Would you stop being such a tight ass and go with him? I don't know him like that. Okay, well, when's the next time a Hollywood director is gonna ask your stanky butt to go to dinner? Hmm? It's not like you have to sleep with him. I'm not gonna sleep with him. Okay, so then loosen up. - Fine, fine, fine. - Fine, go. Um, I have to be home early. Fine, we'll be out of here in 20 minutes. And just to let you know, if anything happens to my sister... No, nothing is gonna happen to your sister. I promise you I will get her home safe and sound. Thank you. You're going to dinner. Order anything you want. Yeah. Everything just looks so expensive. Man: How can I help you? We're gonna have a bottle of Chteau Margaux. Nice. So, Lorie, tell me about yourself. Well, what do you want to know? Everything. Actually, Lorie was, like, the best ballet dancer. No. Really? I wouldn't say the best. Do you still dance? No. Why not? Um, because I got in a car accident and shattered my knee. I'm sorry to hear that. Oh, don't be sorry, it's okay. You're different. I'm different? Don't worry about it, it's a good thing. Okay. You're hilarious. Well... I'm a lot of things. Do you have a boyfriend? Um... I haven't had one of those in a really long time. And why is that? Because I haven't found anybody worth the label, I guess. So what about you? What are you about, since you get to ask me 20 questions? Well... I'm about a lot of things. Chloe: Not something I wanna think about. Lorie: Thank you. Oh, my God. - It was so good to see you. - You too. - We have to keep in touch. - We do. What?! Stop, I'm trying to tell her bye. If you find yourself in LA, hit me up, okay? Okay. Baby, will you stop it? I... enjoyed you tonight. I had fun, too. So you going back to LA tomorrow? Yeah. Gotta get back. Always working. Well, it was nice to meet you and have a nice life. What? Why you gotta say it like that? I don't know, I just... I think I have an idea about you Hollywood directors. - Really? - Yeah. Different cities, nice restaurants, different girls. The fast life.

I'm just trying to picture you all "hoochiefied" up in a music video, dancing in front of a rapper with a little skirt on. First of all, it was very tastefully done. All right, if you say so. Second of all, I wouldn't have even done it if Stacy hadn't encouraged me, so... I mean, were you nervous, like... - At first. - A little bit? But, y'know, it's kind of like being on stage a little bit. Please. Don't tell me this gonna be your new career now. Uh, no. All right. - It was a one-time thing. - Okay. So forgive me? Ehh...

I don't know if I'll ever be content, you know? What are some of your goals, since school is not an option? This is gonna sound horrible. I didn't go to school for an education. I went to dance. There's nothing wrong with that if dance is your passion. It was. Ballet was my everything. Was my ticket. You don't need ballet for that. Just be patient with yourself. You'll figure it out.

I kept telling your damn sister to leave that boy alone. She just had to rebel against anything I told her. And she's turning out to be just like her mother. Now you running in that same path. You okay? I heard you from my room. Oh, my gosh, Stacy. I just had a dream that you were killed. Oh, my gosh, sister. That was so scary. Don't be scared. I'm not. Now that you're here.

How much longer, Gomez? I need just five more minutes. We gotta be camera-ready in ten minutes. How you doing, baby? Good? - Lovely. - Good, good. Yeah, man.

Look nigga I'm hot And I ain't take my medicine Ain't gonna stop walkin' on I'm higher than I ever been Every girl I'm dealing with is asking for a wedding ring Because I tell 'em anything Never am I settlin' Uh yeah I'm in this bitch And I ain't going wrong with the beat around And I ain't no punk Don't be surprised when I beat you down They say I'm arrogant I say I am confident Now who they got a problem with? Boy I don't need to trip it's okay... All right, let's get it, peoples. Angie Martinez sitting here with video "it" girl, Lorie Walker in the building. - Hi. - Hi. I don't know why I feel like you're everywhere, I feel like I can't see a video and you're not in it. You know, I've been working pretty consistently, so I've, you know, kind of had a... I don't know, been around in a way where people are able to see me often. Be careful when you say "been around," because, you know, there are some stereotypes. You know, everybody's different and, y'know, there are people who do what they do and for me, personally, I, y'know, I don't do a lot of stuff except for just come to work and do my job, so... So why do you do it? # I'll settle down # # Some other day # # So long # # I'll never be coming home... ## Shark: Good morning, baby. Everything all right? Thank you for being a part of my life. There's nobody I'd rather have sitting in that seat than you. # When the sun is burned out # # And there is no one else around # Lorie! # And there's a hole # # That only you can fill # # Like a trip that won't end # Oh, my Lord. # This dark depressing thought of another night ## So how are you and Shark doing? Just fine. Well, you've been out here for, like, six months and you haven't worked with anybody but him. Yeah, well, that's because he doesn't want me to work with anybody else. Because he owns you. He doesn't own me, Chloe. He just... he just wants to make sure I don't get caught up. Look, you should be out networking and meeting other directors. Yeah, but why should I meet people if I'm working on all of his gigs? Because you can't put all of your eggs in one basket. What if he gets tired of using you? Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about, but it's your career. You gotta be able to take care of yourself. Don't depend on a man. I know. Lorie: Y'know, I've done a lot of different things, you know, and a lot of different videos, but now it's like I'm looking to take my career to the next level, you know? Well, you have an agent? Not yet, but... Look, you're a beautiful woman, all right... Thank you. - But you gotta get out of these videos, you know? - Start... start acting. - Yeah, I want to. I mean, that's kind of... Look, I'm gonna give you my card. Give me a call, I can give you all kinds of referrals. Okay. Hey, what's up there, birthday boy? What's up? What are you guys talking about? You know, just talking to Lorie about getting an agent, getting herself out there, getting her some more work. She doesn't need any more work. I keep her busy enough. Isn't that right, baby? Hey, I really want to talk to you about this film, okay? One a picture production company might take on a script. I think it might be amazing. Okay. Ooh, let me see. - Wow, those jeans look hot. - Yeah? Yeah, they make your butt look good. Thanks. Do you think I should get a butt job? No, you should not do that fake shit. Why? It could be a little bigger. No, your butt is perfect. Yeah, but it's natural and boring. No, it's not boring. It's better to be natural. Lorie, we can't all have perfect little bodies like you. My body's not perfect. It's that I'm working what I have. And what I have is these jeans that I'm going to wear outside of the store. And tonight, maybe. And tonight, maybe. - Yeah, they look good. - Yeah. I like your shoes, too. Well, I need to get shoes to go with it. Excuse me, excuse me, girls, girls, hi. How you doing? I don't mean to bother you, I... This is weird. I was inside and I was just looking at some candles, whatever, and I was with a friend, and I just had to stop you, I couldn't take my eyes off you. You're very... you're very nice-looking. - Thank you. - I'm sorry. I don't mean to embarrass you. But we have a bet. I mean, you have to be an actress, model, singer, dancer? - Maybe. - Maybe? She is. - We both are, actually. - Chloe. That's no surprise. Well, I'm a film producer, and I'm sorry, I don't mean to take your time, but I'm doing a film and I would be honored if you would come and meet with us, read for us. If you're interested, it's a fabulous new indie we're working on. - Really? - Yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah. I'll definitely give you a call. - Would you? Good. - I would. Jermaine. - Lorie. - Lorie. - Lorie Walker. - Lorie. You can call me too with... She's got my card. Okay, cool. Where you going? Um... out with the girls for some drinks. You know you gotta wake up early in the morning for your shoot. I know, Shark. I'm a big girl. What's wrong with you? Nothing's wrong with me. I just want to go out with the girls for some drinks. Girls' night. Who you going out with? Chloe and some of her friends. Oh. Going out with the groupies, huh? We're just going out to network. Is that what they call it? Network? Oh, my God, whatever. Look, you know as well as I know that all Chloe wants to go out for is to fuck a celebrity. Okay, but I'm not going for that reason. Look, baby. All I'm trying to do is protect you, okay? I appreciate that. I would appreciate it more if you would just let me do these sometimes. I just want to go out and make my own connections. You don't need to make your own connections. Okay, but I want my own connections. Don't you walk away from me when I'm talking to you! What are you doing? I got they dome tapped They what? They dome tapped I got they dome tapped They what? They dome tapped I got they dome tapped I got they dome tapped I got they dome tapped I got they dome tapped I got they dome tapped Hey, bitch. Air kisses, air kisses. Oh, my God, this club is full of lames! I can't even stand it. Kill me now. Ugh. What are we doing after? Oh, I gotta go home. I have my Golden shoot in the morning. I'm doing that video. Shark's directing that, right? Yeah. Well, B. Gunz is having an afterparty, so... what's up? - Ooh. - Uh... I'm down. - You wanna go? - No. - Come on. - You're totally coming. - I have to... - Okay, you're coming. And I'm gonna go to the bathroom, and I think you guys should join me. I think we should, too. Grab your purse. I don't have to go to the bathroom. Oh! Lorie, you don't have to do it if you don't want to. What does it feel like? It's like three cups of coffee. It's like... it's like a lot of sugar, you know? Just hyper. Trust me, if you don't like it, it'll be gone in 20 minutes. Promise. Close... close that nostril and just sniff real hard. Breathe in. Perfect. - Party girl. - Nicely done. Give me another one before somebody comes in. We're good. - Here, enjoy. - Oh, my God. Party. I can't believe I'm doing this. Ugh, ahh... Oh, my gosh, you guys, I needed this. Oh, no problem. All right. I hope Max isn't there, I hate that dude. Loser. Let's not talk about guys at all tonight. Yeah, what's up with you and Shark anyways? That guy sucks. - He does, he sucks. - I've known him forever. Did you guys used to date or something? Hell no. I been in this industry a really long time, I've seen him go through a lot of girls. Thank you. You know, he usually picks the fragile ones, you know, he'd build up their confidence a little bit, treat them like a queen, and then he thinks he owns them. Sound familiar? Uh, see, I told you. That's why you need to be making your own connections. Exactly. - One more before we go? - Let me get another one. Enough with the Shark garbage. Let's go party. - Check. - Oh, my gosh. - Let's. - Check. You have a little bit. You have a little bit. Okay, let me just stop at the bar and get a drink and then we're gonna go find some more blow, all right? - Yes. - All right! Excuse us. We need some more drinks. Champagne first. Lorie: Oh, I wanted to try... - I've been looking for you. - Excuse me? Remember me? I met you a while back with Shark. Oh, yeah, I remember. I reached out to Shark about getting you in my video, but he told me I couldn't use you unless he was directing. Oh, okay. Okay, well, call me. Hold on, hold on, baby. Run that by me again. So what you getting into tonight? I'll be here. - You'll be here? - Yeah. All right, be good, all right? Oh, my gosh. I'm so fucking high. Okay, look, I see a really cute guy over there. I know, I'm so... Oh, my God, I need a drink. - My phone's ringing. - Already? You just gave him your number. Shit, Shark. Thank you. It's hitting your throat. Yes... Thank you, guys. - Hey, party girl. - Hey. You coming out with us tonight? I'm gonna text you. Bye, Shark! What time did you get home last night? About 2:00 in the morning. Lorie: Are you serious? Okay, that'll work, that'll work. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Question, can you guys meet my quote? Yeah, that's perfect. Oh, that's gonna be fine. Okay, sounds good. I look forward. Bye. Who was that? Um, it was Brainchild's people. He wants me to be in his next video. You didn't ask for my permission. I didn't think I needed your permission. No? You work for me, don't you? Yeah, but, babe, it's nothing personal. I just kinda, you know, wanna branch off and do my own thing sometimes. Lorie, I got you into this business, didn't I? Yeah. And that's why you should be happy for me. Baby, just because I'm working with other people doesn't really mean like that should change anything. Well, it does. All right, now... now you're available, okay, just like every other little girl out there trying to get a job. That's you. Okay, fine. - I'm gonna get ready to go. - Really? Have fun. Woman: Welcome to the Aurora Borton Show. In the house, we have Video Vixen of the Year, we have Ms. Lorie Walker. - Welcome. - Lorie: Thank you. I've been trying to get you for a long time. You've been really, really busy these days. What you got going on? Oh, my gosh, I have a bunch of stuff going on. I have another video next week, I've done actually three covers this month and I'm getting into the acting world a little bit, too, so it's very exciting. Any nude work coming up? Uh, no. - Not yet? - No, just no. Okay, all right. You're looking really beautiful. To my male listeners and my ladies, she's looking hot. Thank you. So, with that being said, are you dating anybody? Um, I do have a boyfriend, yes. And is he this video director we hear you've been spotted around town with? Um, my boyfriend is my business, so... You can keep it real. I mean, come on, that's what we do here. I am keeping it real now. All right, now, tell me about this boyfriend, this video director that got you in the business. I hear you're his main girl and you really can't work for anybody else, is that true? I don't think I wanna comment on that. Okay. Well, why don't you comment on what people think about the term "video ho," and when it's thrown in your direction, how do you feel about that? Actually, that term hasn't been thrown at me, but the term, I think, is obviously derogatory and disrespectful and I think that there are definitely girls who do their thing... I'm not one of them. That's a great answer. But at the end of the day, you are sleeping with your boyfriend who is a video director. So thank you very much, Lorie Walker, for doing our show. We appreciate you, so anytime you have time to come back through, we'd love to have you. Thank you. Lorie: Hello? Where are you? I just left the photo shoot. Where you going now? I'm going to meet up with Chloe to get our nails done. You know she's got a horrible reputation, right? Yeah, but just because she has a bad reputation doesn't make her a bad person. Yeah, well, people talk about it. You don't want people to start talking about you, now, do you? Shark, I don't care. Well, you ought to care! Let's go, am I good? Now, has anybody seen Lorie? Jason: Hey, what's up, Lorie, it's Jason. Just letting you know I will be in LA this weekend, I got a tryout for the Clippers. So say a prayer for me. But, no, it'll be real good to hear from you. Like I said, I'll be in town all weekend. I hope you're doing well, I been seeing you all over the TV and... Hey, Lorie, it's Jason, this is like my sixth time calling you now. Pick up, pick up, call me! You forgetting about your friends now? What's going on? I got some really good news, I really need you to call me. Anybody? Lorie: Coming, Shark, chill the fuck out. Could you please take your position? Can you wait a fucking minute? I'm tired. Man: What's wrong with your girl, man? Shark: Today. - Please. - I'm fucking going. I'm coming. Where am I supposed to stand? You know where to stand. I know where to stand. Can you show me, please? I gotta hold your hand for everything now? - Right there. - Fine. Man: You gonna do this or what? Oh, my gosh. I can't believe this, this is so weird. I mean, we're both really living out our dreams. Yeah. No, we definitely blessed. I checked on your grandmother the other day. Oh, yeah? How's she doing? She's holding up. I think she's in denial about your sister, but... I don't know if I ever told you this, but, like, I consider your grandmother to be like my grandmother, you know? And she's already lost two of her girls, like, I feel like I... I talk to Stacy all the time, so, you know, I talk to her in my dreams. Lo... I'm gonna ask you something and I want you to be honest with me, all right? Are you happy? For real. Very. Very happy. Honestly, who would have thought I'd be living, you know, my life this way? It's just... Well, I'm very happy for you and you know you got my support in whatever you want to do, okay? And I'm very happy for you, Mr. NBA man. Not yet, but I'm supposed to find out tomorrow. Excuse me! Hi, can I get a latte? The service is so fucking bad here. I gotta go to the bathroom. Shark! Open the fucking door! Now you can really branch out and do your own thing. You don't need me anymore. Have fun getting fucked in Hollywood, baby girl. - Fuck you! - Huh. - No, all right. - What are you doing? - Leave! - No! Get the fuck out of here! I live here! Here. You know what, don't forget this, okay? Have fun. Open the fucking door! Fucking bastard! You fucking bastard! Hey, Mama. Lorie? Lorie... What, what, what? - Hey, girl, wake up. - Hi. Hi, I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm just... I'm such a... I'm so tired. You think you could get me some coffee? - Yeah, sure. - Yeah. Thanks. Playback. Yo, hold on. Cut, cut, cut. What? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Are you okay? Yo, she all right? Dude, if she says she's okay, she's okay. I'm okay. Man: Roll playback, roll playback. Let's go, people. Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut! Let's take 30, take 30. Hey. Stupid fucking asshole. What? Yeah. I think you should get your stuff and leave. This is not working. Look at you. You need to get your shit together. Fine. Fine! Fucking fine! To get my shit together! Asshole. Lucky I ever did this fucking video shoot. Oh, he's so fucking lucky I even did this shit. You talk to Chloe yet? Nope. I've been texting her and calling her, but she's not hitting me back. It's probably 'cause she's busy. That's what you think. I've heard this before. Sounds like somebody's a little bit jealous of your success. No. - Chloe's not like that. - Right. So why you staying at my house and not hers? Okay. Ugh, my God! My nose, goddamn! Can I have some more of this? No, Lorie, chill. Chill on that shit. Oh, it's good. No, we still gotta save some for tonight. That was my shit. - Do this! - We'll get some more later. That's not the point, okay? And you didn't put in on this, man, and it goes all up your nose. You better chill. But you love me. Deuces! That's what I'm about to tell that nigga tonight. Deuces. Lorie! Lorie! Oh, shit! Yo, girl, come in here for a second! Fuck! - Shit! - Shit! Let's get her in the shower! We gotta put you in the shower, let's go. - Pick her up! - She's heavy, too.

Okay. Can I see your profiles, please? Yeah. And the other one. You have a beautiful body. Thank you. This role, Lorie, requires a little nudity. Are you okay with that? You don't have to answer that now, don't worry about it, we'll discuss it later. But I do think you'd be perfect for this part. I'd love to have you. Sounds great. It's the good stuff. - I splurged. - Did you? Well, I don't know what it's called, but I splurged. Thank you very much. It's a new hit, it's a hit. It's gonna be huge. - East Russia? - Mm-hmm. Lorie. How are you? Are you fucking serious? I can't believe this shit. - Lorie... - Don't fucking talk to me. What just happened? We used to be really, really close. Is that right? So what, are you a producer? Yeah, yeah, I am. I am. What have you produced? Well, I produce movies. Hey. Jason. What are you doing here? Oh, my God, you didn't tell me you were still in town. I mean, if you bothered to answer my calls, you would know I made the team. What?! - Oh, my God, congratulations! - Thank you, babe, thank you. Oh, my God, that's crazy. That's what's up. Give me a hug! You made the team! Good to see you. She is a stunning woman. I mean, but what am I gonna say about it? You mind if I grab a drink? Knock yourself out. It was a pleasure meeting you, Jermaine. Yeah, likewise. - Enjoy your movies. - Thank you. Lorie: Congratulations. Where your friends at, who you with? Um... I don't even know, I think they're over there. But look, it's good to see you. - Okay. - Give me a kiss. Okay. - Have fun. - All right. Ha! How's my girl? - Great. - Yeah. Fabulous. Come on, we'll go to my place. - Where are we going? - Afterparty. - It's right up the street. - Afterparty! - Come on. - Whoo! Come on, girl! ...but they are so fucking stupid. Can I sit here? Baby, you can sit wherever you want. Okay. And can I take my shoes off? Yes, do whatever you want. Okay. Oh, what happened to your friends? I thought we were having an afterparty. Oh, they may come later, possibly. You should invite them, because the more, the merrier. - Really? - Yes. Definitely. All right, I'll... I'm sure they're on their way. I just wanna... I wanna spread my wings. You do, huh? Yes, this town is so fucking suffocating. Me first. Can I... I'm gonna go to the bathroom, can I... Oh, yeah, sure. It's right...

You know, I have parameters of what I feel... Stop! Ow! That actually hurts. Stop, stop! Stop! Stop it! Ow! No! Hey, you dumb bitch, come here! Have you lost your damn mind? So where do you go from here? You'll figure it out. Don't be half-stepping if you want to be... Then she gonna come and tell me she need more money. - You believe that shit? - Man, that chick's crazy, man. - You got to let her go, man. - For real. She ain't getting nothing out of me, I can tell you that. Dude, there's a woman behind the dumpster. Probably just some crackhead. - Tell her ass to move. - Ma'am, ma'am? Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am, excuse me, ma'am? Excuse me? Yo, ma'am, we got a job to do. Could you please move? Yo, man, yo. This chick is crazy! Call the police, call the cops, man! Yo, get 9-1-1. Go inside and tell Nana I said hi. I don't want to go in there, Stace. Please? For me? Man: Sometimes, we forget our purpose. We live in a world that's corrupt, it's chaotic, and as individuals, we can fall into darkness if we focus on instant gratification. The key to avoiding that is self-discipline and self-responsibility. We focus on our health. Not just our physical health, but our mental health and our spiritual health, and although we're here to encourage each other and we don't judge, as part of your process, you'll all need to take responsibility and ask yourself that question. Why am I here? We have a speaker here today, Mildred. She's a sponsor and a recovering addict. I've asked her to say a few words. - Hi. - Hi. - Thanks, Phil. - You're welcome. Hi, my name is Mildred and I'm a recovering addict. I've been clean for ten years and I'm here today to tell you that you can do it and you're in the right place at the right time. You've made a... an important decision today. You've acknowledged the fact that you can't do it by yourself, that you need a higher power to depend on, to... to get you through. Yeah. There was a void that you were trying to fill with drugs, going down this dark path. It's scary. But you know what? There were signs, signposts. Angels would come and tell you words of encouragement, saying, you don't have to do it this way. You had dreams, you had visions of encouragement and all along, God was bringing you to this place, to this particular time in your life where he's saying to you, "You can do it. " Is that Lorie Walker?! Can I get your autograph, girl? You are so crazy. I know, but I'm so proud of you. There she is. Oh, my God! What are you doing here? Oh, my gosh. I got you something. So what's next? I don't know. But... something good. I want you to know... ...I love you, okay? I really do. And if you need anything, I mean, anything, I'm only a phone call away. You know that, right? I love you, too. My name is Lorie Walker and I'm 24 years old. Man: What are three words you would use to describe you? Adventurous... and... ...loving... and... ...optimistic. Look, let me break it down for you. You got your professionals, and you got your video hoes. Your video hoes and your professionals. What's up, I'm Yasha, 22, video girl. My craziest experience? Probably dating a director. I would say that's my craziest experience, yeah. Hello, my name is Jessica and I'm 21 years old. I'm a video vixen/rap artist. A lot of the girls in the game are hustlers. We grind, and this is what I do. Hi, guys, my name is Christie James, and, you know, basically this whole video thing, I love to do videos, it's really fun, but to be honest with you, a lot of these girls are underpaid and overworked. Not me, because I'm smart and I have a head for business, but a lot of times, it's like the rates are crazy. It's like $50 for a 12-hour shoot. Are you fucking kidding me? Like, look at me, look at what I'm about, hello. I am aspiring to be a veterinarian. A lot of people assume that video girls are hoes and they're just running around to meet artists and screw them, whatever you want to call it, but we actually have dreams. We all, y'know, aspire to do other things... the good ones, that is. What's up, my name is Kandi. I'm the new hot chick right now. I'm not fucking no directors, I'm not fucking to get no part. I'm not trying to be like them. I wanna act. Like, I wanna get my Halle Berry on. I'll get naked or whatever, but I really want to work, that's what I wanna do. I been doing this for about four years now, I'm established in the game and I'm from South Central Los Angeles and I know all about hustlin', so for me, Hollywood is the same path about hustlin'. Get to where you gotta get to, network with who you gotta network with and make it to the top. You know what, I'm sick and tired of bitches hatin' on my shit. This is my world, this is how I live, so stop hatin', bitches. I mean, in this game, these girls all come up to the video shoots, I mean, you know, just trying to fuck their way in there, you know, to get with somebody, but you don't got to fuck your way in no video. You ain't gotta be like that. You just come up here, you be classy. You be a lady. You do your thing the right way and that's how you could get somewhere. I don't understand these bitches right here. Like, honestly. A lot of these hoes, they come into this industry, they turn into, like, light-seekers. Oh, my God. Like moths to the flame, they follow the light. It's just, like, they fall in love with all these wannabe ballers, and all these so-called famous types, meanwhile, all they end up with is STDs and broken hearts. When's the last time you were at the clinic? But, you know, I mean, it's more than just, you know, looking good. A lot of these girls come in this business and they think that, oh, the camera's gonna fix all their flaws, you know? Oh, I don't gotta worry about staying in the gym, because there's retouching, airbrushing. Bitch, who the fuck do you think you are, not respecting the craft, okay? The craft, you gotta respect it, and it will respect you. # Girl, girl # # Girl, girl # # Girl, girl, girl... # # You're my video girl #
