life flash across the sky Upon turning around he noticed that throughout most of his life there were two sets of footprints in the sand his and those of Christ Except during the worst times of his life when there was only one set of prints The man said to Jesus You promised you would walk with me always Why did you forsake me when needed you most Jesus replied There was only one set of footprints in the sand during the worst times of your life because carried you want to be like everyone else Thank God you never will What got into you You have to learn to control yourself m not going to the Christmas party this year The guy was twice his size The little bastards got nerve He gets that from his old man Hes been doing well lately huh You call that doing well little fights no

Charbonneau says we mustnt seek to lay blame Father Charbonneau had to talk to someone What am l chopped liver Youre impossible to talk to The whole neighborhood will know Of course not No one else is to know about this Is that clear This is strictly a family matter What did the priest have to say Its a sin yes but not the end of the world Hes not alone The sin is in the act not the inclination Look whos talking Him and his cassock Dont start He says he knows a priest whos real good with teenagers Forget it Its not a priest he needs Sometimes wonder why we pray to a longhaired guy who hangs out with a bunch of guys in robes Its fishy Honestly Why are there no female priests then Theyre starting to get on my nerves Anyway well take care of his problem immediately Its all in his head Abnormal people get treated People arent born that way they become so Its up to us to make sure that our son doesnt Nature doesnt make mistakes Theres no inbetween Its one or the other a boy or a girl

cheque ll pay you back tomorrow Better than nothing See you would be cured if could simply make it through the storm Happy birthday Christmas Fall on your knees hear the angel voices night divine The night When Christ was born Yesterday when was young The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue teased at life as if it were a foolish game The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame The thousand dreams dreamed the splendid things planned always built alas on weak and shifting sand lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day And only now see how the years ran away So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out He wrote that for you Zac Yesterday the moon was blue And every crazy day brought something new to do used my magic age as if it were a wand And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond The game of love played with arrogance and pride And every flame lit too quickly quickly died The friends made all seemed somehow to drift away And only am left on stage to end the play There are so many songs in me that wont be sung feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue The time has come for me to pay for yesterday When was young Happy birthday my man The old mans still got it huh Its been a while since ve seen him with an inhaler He got rid of it Since when Almost a year think He didnt tell us said nothing okay dont know about cake overate Weve got news dont want to steal your thunder bro so ll be quick Were
