This is routine to me, let's meet tomorrow in Saudi. Are you Surya? No. - lt's you only! Are you here with information or finding it from me? l've found you. - Are you mad? l've matter. - What's it? Raja Goud called you. Would l come meekly if you wear dark glasses like Karunanidhi and order me? Loof! - What did he say now? l didn't get him. - Read it from back, you'd know it.

Who is he? Whether it is burial ground or green fields, whether it is school or a temple, if he lays his eyes on it, it must be occupied. Turning himself as the most feared man, and the way he announced himself as Godfather... Did you see how he got crushed? Like Hitler, the ego to rule over the kingdom of liquor, his aim is to wipe out mining barons like Shankar and rule as mining mafia king, the name everyone says from a little boy to old aged, Raja Goud!

Tell me, shall l pack you up? l've booked a bed in Care hospital, shall l get you admitted there? lf anyone feels thirsty, it's not wrong to offer a glass of water, don't think of giving the well, you'll be in trouble. lf it is good to anyone, l'll go to any extent. You did and have become a hero to this locality. Water supply, ration, current, fight for it. Don't try out settlements. lf you do, neither you nor this colony would be here. With the same idea, you sent three goons from three regions, they're chatting with death now, l know they're your henchmen, don't unnecessarily provoke me. Remember one thing, if l get angry on anyone in this city, l'll beat you only. Save yourself by not making me angry. lf not, nobody can save you. Go...go away! His face is dull!

Where's the man who boasted too much? Has he run away like a coward? We'll show you Peddanna's power. Tell him no use of boasting, we'll thrash him. Why didn't anyone of you inform us about this incident? We didn't want to disturb in Saudi... Come Surya, let's take him to task. No, please listen to me. - They beat us! Can't you get beaten up for a friend? You sacrifice life for friends, are you saying this? Don't get emotional. He's not Surya, he's not the Surya who went to Saudi. What happened? ls Sriram safe? - He's fine. We've lot of work, let's do it. Come. What's it? What happened to him? He's never like this. What happened to him? l've fallen in love, Subbu. - Love? l'm sure the girl would've been very beautiful. l didn't see her properly. - How did you then fall in love? l couldn't see her face clearly. Perfect height to me. She was wearing nose pin, it was twinkling! l fell for it. Who is he crying here? - May be his mother beat him. What happened? Nothing brother. Tell me who beat you, l'll bash them. Baby beat me. - Which baby? Baby was little taller than me. - Why did she beat you? She beat me for saying l love you. Did she beat for saying l love you? Come on, show her to me. That girl! Will you beat if anyone says l love you? - Yes.

You slapped me, are you scared because he's tall? Hello, girl, l'm talking to you, come on slap me. Shall l drop you? Tell me...slap me... Hello...hello... l'll keep on saying l love you till you slap me. Hey girl! Film is great! Hello girl! Trouble is here too! Move...move...stop... Are you listening? l'm saying l love you to her. Brother! What's this? What do you lack? Are you dark? Aren't you glamorous? Don't you've good timing? You're a package of everything. How dare she'll not accept your love! What's this brother? They're tough girls, take them to Gandipet... Where were you Saturday at 10 am? What bother's you where ever l may be? The same nose pin. But... l'm saying it with my heart. She's very strong. Double or single, don't mind. Drowned...l'm drowned... Don't slip away like a fish... Why are you angry like sister of Goddess Kali? Hey you girl! l don't like your attitude... l don't like a girl like you trying to look angry... Don't get irritated, O girl... A big man like has fallen in love for the time... Don't say its wrong and turn away from me... O princess, you must come down from high pedestal towards me... Fighting me you're trying to use axe for what could be nipped with nail... With the first sight... deep inside the heart... That generates a myriad of feelings is what you call as love... lt's a type of coma that affects suddenly... lt's not love if we plan and execute, O girl... lf you ask me why do l like you so much, l don't know why... l've given up everything for your love... Why are you getting angry and furious on me? When luck is giving you a windfall without you seeking... lf you throw it away like refuse, you'll lose your eyes... Using lipstick... putting make-up quite often... You get dressed up to flatter men... And if we men follow you, you give us a slip with a sorry... lf all girls turn into matchsticks and burn brightly... This life would be spent pining for a wife... lf a male fly lands on you, you say its a sin... Women's organizations would protest in your support... Beautiful girls are biting like female mosquitoes... Who should we share our agony of losing sleep over it? l'm frank in everything, l like you very much. l've never told this to any girl till date. l promise on my Sri. Who is he? - He's everything to me. lf you've the same opinion on me and similar feelings, say frankly yes. All our hurdles are cleared. l want to do many things. l'll freshen up and come, let's paint the town red with our love. l forgot to tell you, my name is... - What's in a name? l didn't love your name. But you! Oh Venkamma! Tell me at least your name. What you said just now? Venkamma. My grandma's name, isn't it good? Shall we go out for dinner tonight? Why just dinner? Let's go on night out. Do you've any problem? One who visits temple on Saturday is a devotee, one who goes to pub is a lover like me. Very naughty! What? Love at first sight? One doesn't get a train ticket without name and lD, How could you love at first sight? That is... You gulped it in one go! Looks like you're a habitual drinker. Daily once only. Yourjoke is too much to handle. Daily once! You're enjoying such a silly joke so much, l think you love me deeply. Any doubt? Would you like to check it? He always disturbs...give her one more tequila, she'll have it. What's it? Juice for me, tequila to him. You did a good job. l'll prove him that getting a girl isn't as easy as having a beer in pub, but as difficult as drinking the water of seven seas. He must be in shivers next time on hearing love or love at first sight. As per out plan all of you come as soon as l make a call. Let's all join together and take him to task. Apple juice of for the girl and tequila for the boy. Shut up! What a speed! l'm scared of you! She fell down! Venkamma, get up! Don't know what do you eat, you're quite heavy. You're inebriated.

Why am l in another dress? Who changed my dress? l did it. Who else would change it? How dare to change my dress! lt's the demand of the situation not dare! Without my permission, how could you... Who told me to go to the room? You! lt means you'd given the permission, right? Why are you looking stunned? lf a girl, who has fallen in love at first sight, if she insists on taking her to room, would you still love her? Not ordinarily, when there's no bad intention in either of us, why should l be afraid? lf you fall in love with a girl, and then if you come to know her character is not good, l had acted like to teach you a lesson. ls such a fine actress hiding in you? My love for you has doubled, you know that? l want to kill you. She fainted again. Earlier fell after a drink now after a wordy duel. Please come in, doctor. Please check her. Still not yet out of hangover, she had too many drinks, right? Not because of many drinks but it was first time. l've to change her dress, will you please... What's this? A girl got drunk and insisted on taking her to the room, will you bring her to the hospital and insult women? What do you think of women? We're just stepping out of kitchens to pubs. Will you lock us again in kitchen? The girl was shouting at you but you were taking it silently, why? Would anyone leave mother because she's not beautiful or father because he's short tempered? Didn't catch the link? - Didn't sync. Someone had used it, l liked it so l used it again. That's all, do your work. - Okay. Stepping out of kitchen to enter pubs! You've entered pubs and ruining homes. She said about showing him, don't know what he is seeing now! l don't know. Still haven't yet got a call from her? What happened? No call from you or response. Do you know how much we're worried? She's taking rest, if you give the address, l'll bring her. Thank you very much. We tried to teach you a lesson but we learnt a good lesson. Actually, we're here for a tournament selection on behalf of Horsely Hills College. Thank you very much. - Take her carefully. l was waiting for you. Where were you yesterday? Quite busy? Bloody! Something has happened, what's the matter? That is... - lt's a long story. Long story or wrong story? - Mixed story. Why did you call me so many times yesterday? To introduce my sister to you. - Who is it? The girl who failed in running and walking very dull. That blue tracks. Are you enjoying it? lt seems blue! You'll get it nicely, enjoy it. Fat boy! Sri, l'll meet her later. - Why later? She's here. Wait. What? Lost the race? Forget it! He's my best friend Surya. That's Subbu! Till now you were in Horsely Hills and we were here, so couldn't meet. What's that look? l must look angrily at you! You didn't even meet me for 2 days in the name of practice, is this your final result? Sri, you're getting unnecessarily serious. lf not what else? Your best friend is responsible for my failure. You come with me for a moment. -= Where? To tell you in short what was happening for 2 days, l proposed to you sister and ruined her practice. lt didn't click. She's no ordinary girl. Sorry buddy. What? - Fat boy! What would be my condition? How could you befriend such a guy? You'll get ruined, cut his friendship immediately, brother. Would l get ruined? Are you telling me about him? Do you know what she's telling? - What is she telling? lt seems l must cut your friendship. Shall l do it? - Do it, no problem. Shut up, bloody! l think she has misunderstood you. l'll clear it. You needn't do it, good bye to your sister, come. Please listen to me. - Come...come... Don't know when l will see her smile? lt seems you went to Saudi, how is Sriram? He's going to become the manager of the company. l'm really proud of having such a great friend. But l'm ashamed because he has a friend like you. Why did you say like that sir? - lf not what else then? Always in that gym, fights and settlements, don't you ever want to settle down in life? l'll settle slowly. What you will? Look at Sriram. He made me to retire voluntarily. He took over the responsibility of this home. He's getting is elder sister married. He's training younger sister to be a sportswoman. At least get sense seeing him. Like Buddha had a Bodhi tree, l'd also find some neem or banyan tree. l'll see then. You'll never reform in life. Every man must have an aim in life. lf it is so, l too have a great aim in life. What is it? My aim is not having any aim. Murthy sir, if you give me a gap, l'll give the gifts sent by him. This is for you. To make Sirisha beautiful in marriage he has sent a beauty parlour. This is for the younger sister. What's that frowning face? Smile please, has sent gift for you too Take it, smile please! He's coming here in a week, right? Why did he send these gifts with you? l mean he has to bring a lot of things, sent few things with me. Brother! Who is this rotund man? - He's our uncle Kasi. Younger brother. - He's shining and handsome. Rs.10 lakhs in shares, Rs.50 lakhs in real estate, Rs.20 lakhs in food industry, did he earn it? - No, lost it. But he hasn't lost the confidence of earning it back. l've never seen you here. - Fat boy! Your memory is sharp. How can you see me? They were living in Vizag, l was in Hyderabad, they shifted to Hyderabad and Sriram left to Saudi, Meghna was studying in Horsely Hills, got me? ls it clear to you? Okay? - Okay. Brother is coughing. What happened? Where are you? Come fast! Brother is coughing, come fast. What happened? Just because l had heart stroke, don't make me a patient and test my patience. Well said sir! Get up! - You wait. Don't overact, he's fine. Brother is coughing. - l'll get better. Sriram has told us to do this. We've to collect Suryapet private report and send him an email. Her engagement is just a week away, why are you taking her out? Take Meghna with you. l'll not go. - l'll not take her. Always fighting! Go dear, its your brother's work. My national's practice starts today. Okay then, let's go tomorrow. Meghna, be ready tomorrow. Wait! Why are you leaving when scholars are discussing? Scholar? - Any doubt? You...? l'll ask you a question, will you answer it? Shoot! What was the position of your legs while sleeping tonight? Can you tell me tomorrow morning? What would be the position of my legs while sleeping tonight, is this a question? Should l answer it? You foolish... Why did he leave? - Left long back. Hubby! - What?

You had challenged my father, right? lf anyone challenges my father, he'll accept it. Your words are mot matching him, l don't want anything of him. Watch my father's ability now! Father! According to the challenge thrown by you, at 11.30 pm, lifted my left leg, at 11.45 pm, l lifted my right leg, at 3.15 am early in the morning, You were sticking to bed like a lizard face down! lt means last night you didn't sleep at all! You go out son. Go! - Going. Wedding anniversary comes in leap year only, l didn't know you'd ruin it like this. Try touching me for next 4 years, l'll kill you. You tried to outsmart me, right? You don't know how advantageous this decision is to me. Wait a second. - l can wait for a year also. Not only that maintenance my father sends every month is also cut. You planned this to avenge me, right? To make you go sleepless. Are you still here? Do you've sense of time and common sense? He doesn't have sense of time and common sense, brother. Other than eating three square meals every day. You don't have one good habit to come good in life. He'll never come good in life, brother. He'll never reform. - Please don't get angry. Why don't l've it? l was late by 10 minutes only. You please relax, l'll take care of things. This is Sriram's work, you mustn't do anything wrong. No...no...l'll do anything. Look, this is Sriram's work. Please bring back Meghna safely. - Okay. You're going with him, please be careful. He'll trap you easily. l'll not get trapped so easily, uncle.

Where are you taking me? Your family thinks l've taken you out, l think l'm eloping with you, is it okay to you? Blood doubts! Hop on! You said you spared us because it was your gym, what will you do now? He said he'd pack us in body bags. Ask him would he pack us? Why aren't you answering us? Are you scared? Not even a school boy would get scared of you, idiot! You're a like a comic villain in an animation film. l'm a hero, why should l fear anyone? You moron! He used a bad word. Reverse it. No need, l've abused you straightly. Moron! Shall l show you the taste of crossing words with Raja Goud? Not only me, he has many enemies. He's finished today, you fool! l'll count to 10, before that leave the place and go home. lf not l myself don't know how bad the situation would be! Start the count!

Kasi, l'm escaping! Come here! - l'll go. Coming! l think he's the man behind him. lf we bash him... We're calling you and why were you leaving? l wasn't leaving after you called me, you called me while l was leaving. What's your name? - Kasi, sir. Why are you here instead of Kasi? Would a man named Tirupathi be always in Tirupathi? A question is not an answer to a question. Threatening is also not an answer to a question. Please keep away from me. How you connected to him? - Who? l don't know him. Shut up! Comedy! Not him, that man! l don't know him too! Without knowing you, why would he say Kasi escape! What am l to say sir? Bad luck is taking over my life. Though l said no, it's still winking at me. Why are you talking about astrology when l'm asking the address? Tell me where can l find him?

Beat him! lf all others are beaten up and we look fresh, our boss would kill us. Please beat us. - l wish to beat your boss only. Tell him to come before me, l'll undress his dhoti and beat him black and blue. Stop! Don't you want to know where we're going? No need to rush, tell me after sometime. Meghna! lsn't the location very beautiful? Why is the bulldozer coming towards me? Would she beat me? l didn't call you, l was calling her. l never had this feeling ever since l started wearing half sari. l don't mind if you've crossed eye or if you're mad. lf you say yes, by dawn we'll marry. By evening first night! l like you very much. l've never seen any girl talking so openly ever since l started wearing pants. l can't carry you, so you carry me! l'll stand and you sit. What? ls she okay to you? Okay? She's rocking! Love at first sight has some logic, logic has some calculations, calculations have few missing numbers, what do you know, my foot? You come with me. - Where? Where? To marry! First night immediately. All of them tie 3 knots but l'll tie 33 knots. Temple is there! l'll hop on you. Carry me. Leave me please! - Take me. l'm marrying my uncle next month. He's a wrestler, you know that? Marry me as junior wrestler. The boy is very sharp, you marry him, girl! Have honeymoon with him. So, this game is yours. Stop! O girl...different kind of girl... Don't take chances, O girl... Don't cross the path of boys... lt'll shock you O girl... She's a rebel girl who plays wrong game... She's pinching my heart... Why is she so proud? Go away boy... you mischievous boy.. Your smart act won't work out with me... Adventurous boy... you're pain in the neck... l'll do anything, don't ever dare step on my shadow too... What is that which sprouts on its own instantly? lt grows only after cultivated well... lt blooms flowers without budding... When it blooms, fragrance spreads all over the heart... lt's the magic of wonderful love, l'm sure it is there in your heart too... Tell me! Your eyes have seen what's in my heart... Depth of the heart is vaster than sky... lf the girl is genteel, the river would flow... Would the water ever cross the banks? lf youth rebels with love... nothing can stop it's will flow... lf time comes to break the rules... nothing can stop it... lf you say so, l would say no... The day isn't over without a tiff... Do you know Vaishnavi? l've talked to her few times on phone. Brother used to get tensed about convincing her family. And he used to tell me that you'd talk to them and convince them. How far it has come anyway? To settle that issue, and since it was his birthday too, Subbu and l went to Saudi... Don't people come out without a veil? Everyone look same. lf you pass comments on women, they'll cut your tongue. lf you ogle them, they'll pluck out your eyes. lf you dare touch them, they'll cut your hands. lf you try more than that... That's it! Why Sriram is working here instead of Bangkok? Useless fellow! What would you do in Bangkok? Fool... How come it vanished? Vanished again! What? Somebody is trying to kidnap me here. - Who would do it? They're trying to trap with money and kidnap me. Look there, it's a hologram phone! Any image would appear so naturally. You brought a good phone. That's good but unable to get Sriram. Let's go out and try. Get up...fat boy...get up! Where is he? He would've got stuck with some important work. We've his address, right? Let's go. Come. Come...come...come fast. What's that drawing? - Somebody would've jumped. Hello Subba Rao! How are you? Are you fine? What's this commotion? What happened? Come in, l'll tell you. - What's it sir? Come to my flat, l'll tell you. - What happened sir? ls everything okay, right Subba Rao? What else? Where is Sriram? Have you arranged any surprize party? l'm sure it will be a party. The murder you'd seen there was committed by Sriram. Did my brother commit a murder? Though it's unbelievable, police believe it as truth. Who they say he has murdered? Vaishnavi! Yes, he has killed Vaishnavi, the girl he loved and wished to marry. What's all this? Come and sit here. Have some water. Sri, look at me! What's all this mess? Vaishnavi is dead! Telling with great sorrow that Vaishnavi is dead, showing me the last photo he took of her in his mobile phone, She told me what had happened... Do you know how strict my mother is? lf your mother is strict, my friend is too smart, he can easily get her approval. He'll mould himself to the situation and manage it. Will you marry and enjoy life? Aren't you ashamed of? Why not? Won't you enjoy life? l may not be daring but l do care a lot. l'll look after you like a princess. l'll cook twice a day. lf it is necessary, l'll wash the vessels too. What about the clothes? - l'll wash it. Children? - l'll give birth to them. How is it possible? Expecting you'd try to dominate me someday, l've saved proofs. - What's it? Personal letters you wrote to me. Are you still keeping it? - Hold it. l'll keep with me all my life, now l'll read it aloud. Stop! No please. How aged you'd be? l know l love you, that's why l'm cheap to you. Vaishu, l'm like ice! Boss, you're super! - No please...no... Please return it. Don't play with me. l'll show these letters to your friend. - No please. l'll make say wow for you! They'll make fun of me, Vaishu. Please return it. Will you give it or not? l fell for your love poems only! No Vaishu, please listen to me! Why is he hiding instead of telling the police it was an accident? Won't this make him a murder suspect? When l asked him the same question, People gathered around the body of Vaishnavi who fell down 20 floors, by the time he came down, police had arrives and he panicked, fearing if he fails to prove that it was an accident, it's death sentence for murder in Saudi, and went hiding in fear. Sriram was telling us about the incident and police arrived. Stop Sri...listen to me... There's no other way than telling the truth to the police. No, death is the only way for me. There are no bails and no benefit of doubt. There wasn't anyone else other than me and Vaishnavi. lt's better to die now than dying a death every moment waiting for it.. Don't talk mad, come down. lf you come near, l'll jump now. Don't come near me. l'll jump down. Come on jump! Why should you get punished for a crime not committed? No need of additional punishment. My love Vaishnavi has left me. ls there any punishment worse than it? Don't talk foolishly, be practical. Think about your family that depends on you. Don't worry, l'm there for you. l'll take care of things, you be brave. Since there's no evidence to prove Sriram's innocence, it was indeed a murder, and she died falling down because Sriram had pushed her, police have proved this with their investigation, this court accepts it, and according to the Shariat law, this court sentences culprit Sriram to be hanged till death. What's this sir? Look Mister! l'm also from Hyderabad, so l took personal interest in this case. l regret we couldn't prove that it was an accident. May Allah show mercy! lt's not in our hands anymore. Once the Royal court of Saudi passes the judgment of death sentence, there's no other way other than waiting for the date. After all the formalities are over, Embassy is responsible for handing over Vaishnavi's body to her parents. Sir, in lndia a death sentence can be commuted by President. ls there any such possibility here? Not even God has that right in Saudi. But there's only one who can commute it with a mercy petition. Who? lf the dead girl is married, her husband, if she's unmarried, her parents have that right. Can his death sentence get commuted if l get mercy from her parents? l haven't yet seen anyone escaping death sentence with a mercy plea. Allah will not punish us for our sins in hell, people here believe that he punishes here and in this life only. Yes sir but that's for people who have committed the crime. But my friend is innocent. l'll sacrifice my life to save his. a meeting with him, sir? Sri, l'm going to Hyderabad, l'll get this mercy petition signed by them, l'll get you released. Be brave. You're not dealing with an ordinary man. Vaishnavi always told me about her mother Surekhamma only, it seems she's very principled, it seems very strict, l'm worried they may take your life if you go there for their mercy. Just tell me where are they? Leave everything else to me. They're in Suryapet near Nalgonda, just say her mother Surekhamma's name, Surya, my father isn't in good health, if he comes to know this and if he has another stroke, l don't think he would survive this time. You don't worry, Subba Rao talked to your company executive and managed things well, l'll take care of it from now. We'll celebrate your birthday as usual in coming years too. Trust me. My brother is deep trouble, are you telling me this now? Now...will you tell me now? Brother! Brother! lf you're in this condition after hearing this, l think of the condition your father, a heart patient would be. That's why your brother told me not to tell you anything. The reason for bringing you is, l felt a woman's support would help when l seek their mercy. Here's the mercy petition! We've to get it signed by them. Surekhamma Nilayam Greetings madam. Will you please call the elder of the family? Please sit there. Somebody is here to meet you. God! You're a traitor! l was searching for you! Are you in Suryapet as Peddanna? Just one minute, Peddanna. Please don't move. ls there any chance of a big fight scene here? Oh no! When dialogues can do it, no need to use action. No. Greetings Peddanna. How dare you come to my house! Hack him boys! He always brings the fight to home also, shut the doors! Cool down Peddanna, are you vegetable to cut or grind? We're humans, this is not the time for emotions. l beg your pardon if l had hurt your feelings. Why is he here? - Please don't trust him, Peddanna. He challenged to strip your dhoti and beat you. Shut up! ls it mouth or... would l dare say that? No Peddanna, he's dove in pant and shirt, ask him. Brother, he didn't threaten to beat you, he said he would chase and beat you. Cut his head and hang it on my threshold. They'll never listen to words. Shall l start with you? You? Move...move... Thought l had escaped? l wanted to check around the place. Let's fight it out, come on! Come with me! Hold me tightly! l'm not taking advantage, hold me! Kill them before they cross the boundary. Call Sl Ankineedu! Block all the roads! lf he escapes, Raja would thrash us. He's escaping! Catch him! Let's hide here for sometime. Don't get tensed, l'll manage. Wait here, l'll be back in a minute. l think the trouble is getting bigger and worse with him. l must get rid of him first to get them sign the mercy petition. Yes, Sl sir! He's in Venkateshwara marriage hall now on highway number 5! Who are you? Have it, don't get tensed. Do you know? Theirs is also love marriage. lt seems madam made him chase her for 5 years to say okay. l thought women are same till recently, every woman is a specimen! Strange! See there! Please forgive us for disturbing this marriage. All the guests are requested to go out from the main door only... lt's danger for you to be with me. Join the women and slip out. l'll meet you outside. You go to the front. Don't worry, just walk out. l'll join you. Go...go... Trying to cheat me! Come with me! l've seen many people like you. Why are you staring at me? Go! What are you looking at? You're finished in the hands of Raja Goud. Suryapet, via: Choutuppal - Kodad Madam, buy ticket! One to Suryapet. - Not one but two. l almost got him but he managed to escape. You both enjoyed the chase like love birds, where are you going alone now? Where is he? One or two, brother? - Three please! l knew you'd come. What? - Your ousting orders. ls your cell switched on? - ln vibration mode. You'll get the vibrations now. Where are you? - l'm travelling in a bus sir. Why? Are you not on duty? Sir, my wife went to her parents' house and l'm going to meet my parents. Why did you arrest Surya? That is... - Did you file FlR? No sir. - Why? Raja Goud told me.. You're not Raja Goud or Shankar Dada's henchman to do as they say. You work for Govt. Arrest me! No jokes please. Hello, he's good comedian. Please ask him to do comedy. Bye. Where are you going? Just got into the red bus! To Suryapet? What are you planning to do there? Do you want to solve this problem all by yourself? How? Goud uncle, my brother didn't kill your daughter, he loved her, you're mistaking him unnecessarily, if you say so, ls it? Did you hear this Surekha? What a tragedy would've happened! Why didn't you tell me about this little while ago, dear? Please give me the papers. Surekha, give me a pen. He'll sign and since you visited them for the first time, do you think he would present you a sari and jacket and say good bye? He'll rip you apart! What's that stare? Like a silly girl! What was his name? What was that short man's name? Your uncle Kasi. Were you planning to wage war with Kasi on Raja like Queen of Jhansi? He'll stamp you to death. So, give up these silly ideas and trust me. How am l to trust you? What have you done to trust you? l don't know what l would do, but l know l will do it. Devil! We haven't yet reached Suryapet. - She's enlightened now! Come brother! l was waiting for you. l lost my phone in water, so l couldn't call you. Where is he? - He escaped! No, he would've let him off. No, in the fear of losing my job, l let him off. So fear of losing job is more than the fear on me. He ran away fearing us. He didn't run, he made us run. He came to our home and made us run mad. The more he goes far away, the faster he nears his death. You'd returned from Saudi long back, won't you tell us what had happened there? Subbu, do one thing call TV channels, let's have a press meet here. Along with them, Sriram's family would also come to know the news. We've to get Raja Goud and his wife to sign the mercy petition. lf possible, use brain. What's our Sriram's position if Raja refuses to sign it? What if we break the jail and help Sriram to escape? ls it local Cherlapalli jail to try this? lt's ajail in Saudi. Tell me. What if we join his gang and befriend him! Your brain is working! But little change. We've to develop enmity not friendship. Till now he was after us, hereafter we must be after him. Listening to your words, l'm worried about your life in trying to save Sriram. ls it? Let me see it! l'll save Sriram's life risking my life. Raja Goud! Be ware! Let's go! Bloody coward! Are you here to get me such messages? Find Surya! Where is he? lf he has guts tell him to face me. l'll show him the sharpness of my knife. Find him! Aren't you participating in the game? No! What happened to you suddenly? Your brother poured money for your training, will you stop it citing silly reasons? l think your brain has lost its sense with hostel food. Sriram would feel bad if he comes to know. Please think over it again. What's there to think? She's playing, that's it! l can't! Please don't force me. The rhythm is upbeat and my feet danced to it... He's the man who would've done something. That's why she's refusing to practice and withdrawing from game. What have l done? What did l do? He says as if he's innocent. l'm sure he would've done something, brother. l...l...l'll talk to her. The noose is tightening around my brother's neck, as a sister, how can l concentrate on sports? Don't deliver Savithri and Kannamba's dialogues from old films, Do you think only those who share blood share the sorrow? Do you know how much we've shared between us? He's just a brother to you, but he's everything to me. What do you know about our friendship? What do you know? This friendship is funny... Life too is less for it... A friend with heart is everything... Money, name and fame is all ours... Let's go to win the world... Love is wishes weaved together... Friendship is affection without any wishes... Friendship is above everything... Even a miser friend is okay... World listen to what is said... Friendship listens to what isn't said... That's why friendship is one of its kind... Born in trust...one which breaks the barriers of hearts... lt's a companion of life... Even King can't go to heaven without a good friend... Though eras change friendship never changes... Looks like you've become very emotional. Not emotional but aversion! You told me as if yours is great friendship like Akbar and Birbal. Silly friendship! Silly friendship? Many people tried to break it. They wanted to create differences between us. They wanted to burn it. Nobody couldn't! What do you think great friendship is? Sacrificing the girl he loves for me, to make a victor, slowing down to make me a winner, and l surviving with a kidney donated by him, is this friendship? No! l'm not making fun of your sadness or responsibility. Lifetime's opportunity, Sriram will come back. Everyone will be happy. But if you look back in life, you would've missed a lot. Please listen to me, let's go. She'll not come. l said come. - She'll not come. Can't you hear when l say she won't come? Why are you bossing over my family? You fool! What do you think of yourself? You come here. Do you think there's no one to ask you? You've grown like a palm! What's it man? Why are you staring at me? Why are you staring at me? Please listen to me. - Why should l? Why are you irritated, frustrated, and perverted? l think you'll have a stroke. Please listen to me. Meghna, get him a BP tablet. Go...go... - l don't have BP. l'm not irritated, frustrated and l don't have diabetes, l'm talking to you, why are you looking that side? Got it right? - Tightly! Do you need to get so emotional? l got little emotional with the situation. Why are you shouting like Sai Kumar? - Who is Sai Kumar? Why are you shouting again? Don't you know who Sai Kumar is? - l know. Twisting his moustache, and says l'm the fourth lion! You know it, right? Why are you going over board? - Over means... Why that unnecessary build up? What did you say? Fool...what's that? Tell me...tell me... why are you pushing me? How dare you push me! l beg you! Why are you coming after me? Why are you so sensitive, Kasi? lt'll calm down. Please be cool! Give him a tablet. - Take it.- Take it... Have it! How can he have a tablet without water? Get water! Go...go... He'll say like that, he's too shy! - l don't want water, don't go please. Go...go... No...no...please don't beat me. l beg you. Do you want some more? That's better! You've already made a hole to the finance of this home. lf you talk about any business or deal! Bloody short man! No need of water or tablet, he's fine now. Shall we go Kasi? Let's go downstairs. You go. - You go...go... Come! She refused to go, but suddenly changed her mind. lt's all Kasi's magic! What did you tell her to accept? Nothing sister-in-law, l told her everything in detail, l said you're good and would be successful. You're looking lovely, short man! You explain perfectly. Come. Surya, Raja Goud's men are searching for you. Don't they have any other work, are they brain less? They don't have your address. Why is he coming here? Who is he? - Shankar Kaka! Long term opponent of Raja Goud. Shankar and Raja are sworn enemies! Brother, my name is.. - No need of introductions. Tell me the matter. Matter is, no one in this city dares to bid liquor tender against Raja for the past 20 years. lf anyone dares, he'll be dead. But Raja is sleepless now and people are no more scared of him. You're the reason for it. l too want you only! lf you support me, l'll take part in this year's tender. Tell me the percentage of your commission! Do you need to play national games? Go to kitchen and cut vegetables. You'll jump in anger to first floor but here unable to jump a feet! Some are born to win, few like you are born to make others win. Never shout on artistes and sportspersons! Praise them! What have you achieved to praise you? lts very easy to comment. l'm the one who plays and sweats! l can see how you play! ls it any drawing competition for a festival? National games! Champions compete with you. Give it to me. Come closer. Take your position. Come! Up...up...up! Take it...take it... What's this? lf you eat all this, you'll put on weight not win cups. Weight! lf you want to change her fate, reduce her fat! Cut it! l'll smash you! l don't want money gotten from misusing the weakness of humans. Give slippers to those who don't have it. They'll salute you. lf you give slippers to a man without legs, he'll beat you with it, Give percentage to men working for you, just give me a promise, that's all! What's this brother? Don't sell spurious liquor like Raja Goud. l got you, brother. You called me younger brother earlier, now you're calling me elder brother! lf you change relationships according to the situation. then l'll also change my relationship! l know about your honesty, brother! Would anyone dare keep fire in pocket? Bye. ls it necessary to join forces with Raja Goud's enemy? lt is necessary to create a necessity of me to Raja Goud. Brother, Shankar is bidding for liquor tender against us. The snake without teeth is trying to raise its hood again. What's making it take the risk? Surya! Yes, it seems he has joined hands with Surya. Why is he inciting us? We couldn't do anything when he came to my home. When he attacked our property and business, we kept quiet. Brother wait and see how gory his death would be! l'm getting Anwar bhai's men from Mumbai. Do we've to get men from there to introduce him? Would my sword have blood if somebody else stabs him? l'll kill him personally! lf you cross swords with Peddanna, it's death! They were to die here, so escaped from us earlier. Brother, Mumunsamy Naidu has called. Auction is about to start. Peddanna, as usual our entire syndicate is here! Same old thing, right? We'll give up bid at 650! lf he's at home, he would turn up, he's underwater, how can he come? Didn't get me, officer? Rs.200 crores and one rupee! You must add at least Rs.10000 to the bid, sir! Why? Rules? lf you tell me the rules, l'll tell you the result. Do you want me to tell the final auction bid? Want to bet? Rs.500 crores! Rs.550 crores! Rs.600 crores! Rs.610 crores! Rs.650 crores!

Once...twice... Brother! Can't bid anymore, he has crossed Rs.1000 crores! Third time! l don't know to sign, give inkpad, thumb impression only! Leave my hand! Contract is going to Shankar! Peddanna, please forgive me. All these years you were my voice! Now the voice has changed. How much percentage they're paying you? Not percentage, he warned me! Got scared for warning! What did he do to scare you? Peddanna, he has planted bomb! - Bomb? Where? Under you seat! Seeing the bomb under you seat, my bayonet started shaking! Brother, it has vanished! Where did it go away? No problem now! Brother! Why has it come here? Did the bomb walk to this place? Let's go away slowly. Come brother! lt has come on me! l've seen many things but never ajumping bomb! Remove it, brother! lt may go off! Remove it...may go off. Where has it vanished? See again. - Appeared again. Watch now. Gone! lf you cross our path again, image of the bomb would turn real. l'll get blown! You'll come good, well said. lt's enough if l don't go up there! Peddanna, you're a damn good driver! Don't press it again, it may come under my seat! Already our bases are shaken with Rs.1100 crores bid! There's a tomorrow in every man's life. But nobody knows if the man would be there or not. Yesterday was yours, today is mine, tomorrow is yours or mine, let's decide it. Decide it! Coming! Your taste is good, engagement sari and jacket is perfect colour! Look after what else they need! - Okay. Come. Why is she dull? Why are you dull? Shall l help in cutting it? Sriram used to call every second day, but no call for week now. You say he's not calling and he says no time! Moreover he's not working for a small company but very large company... Though the company may be big... - What's the discussion? l'm asking about engagement arrangements, that's all, nothing else. he's asking about another thing too. About what? - About Sriram's phone call. Ever since he went to Saudi, we didn't get any call from Sriram. you don't remember it! No phone call? Just now talked to him. Did he call you? Why didn't he call us then? Signal is weak here, so he called me. He's cheating you. You're unable to get it. Give me Sriram's number, l'll call him. Give me. Give me, l'll call him. You'll not find the phone, l know it, and l'll call him. l'll talk to him. Brother, you don't know... Brother? - Yes...yes. Take it. - Give me. One minute...l'll talk to him, daddy. How much she loves her brother! Brother, let's also go. Hello brother! Come brother! We're fine. How are you? - Give the phone to father. Please don't disturb her, Kasi. Signal will weaken. Will signal get weak or your secrets would be out? What? Would you like to talk to dad? Father...brother! l'll not talk to him. Tell him to come here taking leave. He can go back after engagement. l'll talk to him. - lt's important, give it to me. Did you hear it? How angry he is? Did you use up all the leave for businessman Kasi's oil business? What? Are you ruining his life there also along with business here? l don't know anything. Did you hear it? lt's like this only. You don't worry, l'll take care of things here. Everything will happen as you think. Okay? Mother wants to talk to you. What an area this is? No signals at all!- Yes, never. Please don't get tensed. Am l not your son too? No way! Excuse me... Go...go... Father... - l'll take care. You take care of him. What? - Come here. Am l running oil business? - l thought so. Did l ask him to take leave for it? - No? l'll rip you apart! How dare you raise hand on me! He's no ordinary man, he's like these bombs. Getting the stick! He brought down your 20 year old liquor empire in one day! lt seems he's entering mining business too with Shankar. l'm shivering for the earlier bomb effect. l don't know where l'm, so l'm planning to join Baba Ramdev's Yoga classes. please don't venture out. We've everything and fight with nobody, the loss will be ours, brother. He came to you seeking your forgiveness. You didn't care about him. lf we try to ignite an atom bomb with matchstick, it's danger for us. lf the same atom bomb is with us, our opponents would fear us. l think we must give Surya an opportunity to join us. What's this song? Work fast. No use in giggling, do it fast. Lot of work to do. You've changed the sweet for dinner, it must be fantastic! Are you talking on phone or doing any work? Doing both. - Don't act smart, get going! Where's he? How far the decoration has come? Everything is okay. - Go, check it. l'll check. What are you doing, Meghna? - l'm doing her hair. Plait?

And they listening you! Do you know to make hairstyle? ls it any difficult thing? Are you doing it for your wife? - Shut up! Can you do it now? Do it for some girl. - l'll do it. He says hairstyle is great job! Has she come with a wig? Wait, l'll do hairstyle to you. - Stop... Where is Praveen? Take the bananas inside. Go. - Okay. What are you doing here, Kasi? How is the savory? - Great! Give me one. Go away! Greetings. - How are you doing? Greetings. - Greetings. You have it. Sit there and eat. - Thanks, you're a good man. Give it to me. Do some other work, go. - Okay. Why are you carrying it? What's wrong if we do our work ourselves, brother? He got me into soup. My brother is working so hard, couldn't you've helped me? You boasted yesterday that you'd do everything yourself. You're mad, brother. Why would others do our work, brother? You eat, l think you're very hungry. What for he's useful other than eating? Move away! How was my kick? - l must scold Sriram, not him. You sit and eat happily! Got it? He's asking you to eat. How is that? - How is that? Watch next! - What to see? What am l to see? l'll eat this. Eat...eat... - Watch it. Take these bananas. Sister-in-law, somebody is calling you. Please look after these carefully. Okay, l'll look after it, sister-in-law. There's a fool here, he meddles in everything, no head, no brain, no height! Such fools do exist! Must burn their backs with a hot spatula. Sweets are burning here, isn't there anyone to take care of it? Sriram will get bad name, you know that? Why isn't anyone here? Left it alone! Sweets are getting burnt! Hey you short man! l know it's your handiwork! His hand got burnt! Hey short man! Please exchange the rings! Kasi inquiring a lot about Sriram. We must do something about him. As you'd planned, we've tempted him with a drink party. On this happy occasion, the short man will get the stick. Are you comfortable, Kasi? - Very comfortable. Atmosphere too is very friendly. ls it? Have a peg. Have it l say! Tell me...tell me... - May l? l've stopped business and starting doing trade. Really? lt seems he stopped business and started trade. Did we arrange this to hear your silly jokes? What did l say now that he's manhandling me? Are you complaining? lf you beat me, l'll go away. We'll also join you. - No, l'll stay back. Why are you always in this house only? Where's your motherland? - My mother has no land. ls beating your habit? Who burnt my hand? ls your hand burnt? Who burnt it? - Who burnt it? You? You? You? Why are you crying slapping me? My hand is paining! lf by beating your hand pains, how much it would pain me for getting beaten? lt's Subbu! He's missing the party! l'll talk to him. - We'll also come. Pleas don't come back. lf he thrashes me like this for a peg, what would become of me if he drink few pegs? How to manage him? An idea will change life! l'll give him a shock. Talked to him, he can't come now. Did you mix the drink perfectly, Kasi? Why has the taste changed? - How would l know? How can you say you don't know, bloody short man! How would l know? Tell me what did you do? To protect your health from over drinking, l poured the drink in the pot. Wasted the drink in pot? What's the time now? Midnight! Oh my God! l want a drink now! How do l get it now? Take out the drink. - What? Take out the drink. - How can l take it out? l poured and it went down. Will you take it out or shall l bash you? How can l take out the poured drink? Take it... Go fast! Come...come...squeeze it tightly! Excellent! Well done Kasi! Only my brand must come out not some other brand. ls it any factory to bring out your brand only? Squeeze it... You poured a full bottle, you haven't yet taken out a quarter. Wait. - My friends are waiting there. Come. Pour... lt's coming...pour... You asked for whisky but got wine! This is not wine but your blood! - Blood? Are you going away? What happened? Did anyone abuse you? Other than thinking about guests' requirements, what have l done? You did everything, brother. Me? What have l done? Didn't you get it, brother? Brother, you do that business, you do this business, brother, you do this business, did you ever slap me and asked where's the money? Had you asked me l wouldn't have committed these mistakes? You're rocking! Brother, l'm unable to swallow food. Kasi is feeling bad. - You wait. Brother, if l ever step into this house again, l'll come back as responsible man. This is brothers' challenge! Brother! - Want me to stay back? Brother-in-law! Please don't stop his emotion! He could end up as Ambani with this emotion. Well said. Yes uncle, father has taken this decision for world's good. Watch out, he'd return here as Ambani! Okay, get going! Getting late to your train. Bye brother. Brother! Where will you go at this hour? How will you go? Brother! God has given a street! My foot! That's sky! ...a street! - That's better. No need of son anymore... no need of wife anymore... O my brother! Come!- Coming! Come son. Go. Victory is assured! There he is! Your reverse gear has worked wonders! Raja Goud has invited for a compromise. Take it as the paper is signed! Concentrate on the game, practice well. Come on! Brother! When did it fell down? Beautiful piece! Where did you buy it? l don't need weapons. l'm myself a weapon! lt's not my greatness if you've come to compromise. lt's all your greatness! lf a man who opposes you is with you, there won't be any opposition, right? That's why you're my man from this day! Giving a present to a friend is my tradition. l'll give you also make your wish. l don't want property or money, brother. Just say one word, you've forgiven me. Surya, l've forgiven you long back. Not me, but my friend. Why should l forgive your friend? What did he do? He didn't do anything. lt happened. What are you saying? About your elder daughter Vaishnavi. As father you're the only one who can save an innocent's life. lf you sign this paper, you'd save my friend. How dare you ask me to save my daughter's killer! Even if l lose my entire property or go begging on streets, l'll never forgive him under any circumstances. l will... lf the path has thorns and glass pieces, we come wearing slippers. lf you want revenge, kill me. There's on one to mourn my death. But there's a big family dependent on him. l'll not kill when you give an opportunity, l'll create it myself. Did you get his signature? - Not yet but almost done. You concentrate, on ground nobody must be anywhere near you. Aren't you coming? Dealing with Raja Goud, l'm quite busy. You be focused on it. ls it l? ls it really l? What has happened to me? l've become a part of you... Am l seeking you? lt's you... lt's true but can l take it as dream... Am l giving myself to you? lt's you who refused and it's again you who desired me... l had pinched myself to check suspecting if it was really myself... My heart is soaring into sky with happiness.. Magical love will enter wherever you may be... And how much you may try stopping it... lf you say my heart obeys... That l like you very much... lf you get restless and can't stand in one place, you're in love... There wasn't any commotion in me till now... Before l tasted the magic potion of love... l too felt as you'd said before... Flood of love will drown you fully... Will it leave you without sweeping you away? Whatever it is, l've fallen for the heart that soothes me... You'd have realised the power of first sight... My sweet darling! You'd achieved your aim. Have you taken the video? You've to send it to Sriram. l've already mailed it to him. My daughter's range is different from today. World sportstars would chase Meghna from now. l fell flat on seeing you running in ground, l came running behind you, l said no to Sania Mirza, Shoaib married her later, Koneru Hampy checkmated me, l said l'm already booked. Did l win the cup to marry some cricketer or tennis player? You asked him rightly, Meghna. Won't she marry a gentleman like you other than sportsmen? l know it. How would you propose to her? Let me see it. She said no when l proposed to her three years ago. l think she may beat me if l do it again. No shame? - That's why! You idiot! Devil! Did you see her? Bye sir. South Manager of lrrigation department. He likes me so much, he didn't want me to retire too. lt seems he saw the news about Meghna on TV. Not only him, everybody who has seen it talks about Meghna. What happened? Sit here! Get some water! Call ambulance. Sleep comfortably. Called ambulance? - lt'll be here any moment. What's this twist now? You haven't yet got the paper signed. Sriram's position is getting worse. Here this man is getting worse. What shall we do now? When all the avenues o peaceful settlement fails, only one option remains, brandishing a knife at him! l'll not spare you or this family which had killed my daughter. Get up! Who are they, Surya? Some guys, let's go to the hospital. Be careful! Deflate their car tyres. Slowly. Get down. Come on boys, he's leaving! Don't worry, we've almost reached. Peddanna, drink water! Who attacked Peddanna? - Shankar Kaka's men! He was a dead snake, you supported him, he has raised the hood and trying to bite Peddanna. He's taking away Peddanna with him! Get in...get in... Where are you going, brother? Come Surya! We've killed Raja Goud! There's no one to challenge us in this city. Get a chair to brother. l oppose Peddanna's policy. Not to Peddanna! You promised not to sell spurious liquor. That's why l supported you. But don't think l would do anything you say. He was ready to lose everything for his daughter, l liked that character, if you've guts, come on try killing him. Duryodhana needs Karna's support in the war, but l don't need anyone's support. This city must have only one king! Boys! Kill them! Forgive me, Peddanna! What are you seeing? Get a chair. Nothing to worry, madam. Few street dogs barked at him, they got chased away! Arrange hot water for his bath. You'll be fine in few days, Peddanna. Surya, friend of Vaishnavi's killer. lt seems if we sign papers, his friend's death sentence would be commuted. He did everything for it. Throw him out, boys! Madam, it was an accident not a murder. Go away! - Please listen to me, madam. Get out! Go! You hit the target even in anger. You must hit, had l been in your place, l would've killed! Go...get out... - Please listen to me. Shut the gate! l'm Saudi Subba Rao here! Saudi court has announced the date. Sriram will be hanged day after tomorrow. Why am l getting bad dream? Madam! Start the vehicle. Greetings madam. l'm Sriram's sister. Won't you let us be peaceful even in temple? He's near home and you're here. Madam! - Send her away. Please come.- Madam... - Please don't irritate her. Come madam. Please don't irritate madam, please go away. Go...go please... Don't make her angry. Please go away. Brother will be hanged day after tomorrow. He loved your daughter more than his life. But he didn't want to take her life. Please save his life, madam. You're like my mother... How is Surya related to you? - Nothing to me. He's my brother's friend. l'll get my husband sign the mercy petition. Can you force Surya to marry my younger daughter? We rarely see men who live selflessly for others. The first time l saw him, l realised he's fire! Shall we go? God won't punish us for our sins in next life or in hell, don't how many people's curses us, our younger daughter was born like this. He took away our elder daughter from us. With a small wish that God would show mercy at least in this, with a selfish motive, l'm asking you! Get Surya's approval, you stand guaranty, get the paper signed, l'll arrange the marriage. Will you force him to marry my younger daughter? What's his job? No time to talk to his father also. Does he think sending money for marriage ends his responsibility? All our relatives are here. But he hasn't turned up. Why aren't you answering my call? Come, l've to tell you a matter. Come fast. Where? - l'll tell you, don't worry. What happened, Surya? Tell me Surya! - What happened? Do you know how many times l had called you? l wanted to tell you very important matter... What have you done with my son? Ever since you came back from Saudi visit, my son has not called me even once, What is happening there? Tell me! You say he's your best friend, tell us what has happened there? Tell me l say! You don't get excited! lt's not good for your health. He's coming tomorrow, l was here to tell you that. Why are you bombarding me with an inquiry like CBl? Are you angry because he's not here or because l'm here? For both. We must go to the airport by tomorrow morning 9 am! Be ready. You could've told me that little earlier, right? You could've have given me little space, right? That's okay, still have to distribute cards and arrange things, who will do it? - l'll do it. Do it. - l will. Do it. - You don't excited, please. Catering, marriage hall, decoration, everything is done.- Okay. Surya, come here. ls my brother coming? Did Raja sign the paper? How? Can you force Surya to marry my younger daughter? You be on the job of getting Surya's approval, l'll get the paper signed, Don't worry about how it's done, be happy it's done. Sriram must be shocked with marriage arrangements. Go...go...go... lf we carry a sharp knife, it may hurt us. Our lives are in danger if Surya is by our side. Surya, who played havoc wit our lives, and it seems you'd forgiven your daughter's killer too! The word forgiven isn't there in my life. l'll not forgive you, my long time enemy. l'll not forgive Surya, my new friend and old enemy. l've saved my daughter's killer's life to kill him with my hands. He mustn't die in gallows elsewhere! Right here...in my hands! My dear Vaishnavi! l'll offer his blood as prayers to you. Control yourself, your dad's ego is hurt! Go to him immediately, else he'll kill me. Go! Go...go... Go! Go...go...Go! We were waiting for you, did you feel like meeting him first? How are you doing father? Waiting to meet you, how are you son? l'm fine with God's grace, father. God is always beside good men. You shut up. - Okay. How are you son? - l'm fine, mother. How are you sisters? - Fine, brother. Come. How are you Sirisha? She's ready all decked up like bride. Next is marriage band and welcoming the groom! O darling...heart says it's with you... Come on break into ajig of celebration... A heart has united firmly with another heart... Eyes and dreams have been linked... lt's all the magic of your greatness... We're all for each other says the auspicious moment... Colours...vibrant colours... band is playing... Let's rock it with fun, frolic and wild celebrations... My heart wishes to shout, raise dust and fkte... l like the girl... Your waist... Though you say no... l'll insist on adding its beauty with a golden girdle... Check the measurement first... lt's invisible waist... l'll decorate your beauty with jewels... l'll ask for your smile which is equal to gold... Then, l'm crossing the line, and l'll rock you... Don't ever leave him... Even after 100 years and many more... Did you see Sri? - l think is outside. That's all, brother-in-law. Hubby, Sriram is missing. Missing? ls he a little boy to go missing? He'll be somewhere here only. l've tried his phone, it's switched off. Sir, few goons took away Sriram. - What? They took him away in a van. Raja Goud's men are taking him to Suryapet. Suryapet? My son isn't here for 10 hours, what did you do in between? Recently when they attacked me, you said it's regional trouble, now, what have you done with my son? What have you done with him? Nothing will happen to Sriram, l'll take care of him. Do you want to blow up the issue and have him get killed? Please let me go. - Don't let him go from here. Please try to understand. lt seems my son Sriram is in some trouble, you move, it seems he saw it, please get the details and help us, sir. Where have they taken him? - Come, l'll show you. This can't be solved by police. Please let me go. Where are you going? - He's in danger. The day he became your friend, he fell into danger. You always say you're his friend, you're not moving from here, it's a promise on his friendship. Dead promise! Father! Will you please let him go? lf not brother will die for real. Do you know what you're talking, Meghna? Nothing will happen to father. Meghna, don't say anything. He must know how his son had returned safely from Saudi. You've taken all the pain, which a father should've gone through, what pain have you left for him? That could break him. - No Meghna! Let me tell him, it not he'll let you go. You wait. Brother got into a situation in Saudi where he was sentenced to death, without caring about his life, he saved the life of his friend, father. You be brave! Till Sriram has your blessings, nothing will happen to him. Trust me. You were guarding me in fear that he would trap me in love, l'm accepting shamelessly, father, l had fallen for him, you know that? After rejecting his proposal couple of years ago, he never embarrassed me with again, l'm yearning now for a good man like him, you're sleeping peacefully dreaming about your son, but he spent many sleepless nights to make your dream come true, father. ln these modern times when friendship is restricted to words and quotes, Surya is a friend with commitment. Like armour and ear studs save Karna's life, he's the shield of his life, kill him first, boys! Hack him boys! l'm ordering you, boys! Hack him! Why to kill without any reason? Surya is a honest man! He thrashed men who dared to touch you. He brought back your lost glory and power. We were with you for years but couldn't do it. Why should we pick up trouble with him unnecessarily? Even if we do, he'll break bones when he beats casually, and if he beats with emotion, we'll lose the hospital expenses. - Yes, brother. Has he become your friend too? Sing paeans of him like eunuchs! l'll finish both of them! You may not know the value of life, but l know it. Father! Father! Please forgive me, though it wasn't my mistake, l had to lose my love Vaishnavi in the incident, l'm also going through a lot of pain, lf you or your daughter have no objections, l'll marry her. You've made me realise the value of mercy. l was thinking like a demon and kill you all. Please forgive me. Father! Please forgive me, Murthy! You've proved that having no aim is also a great aim People go to forests and Himalayas to achieve this. You've achieved it living amongst people. You're embarrassing me. People are watching us. No more tensions, right? Are you happy now? No! The real problem is still pending. What's the problem? Finding a man like you for Meghna... How would it be if you marry her? No way Murthy! How can l marry this tough girl? She's after you! f you're angry, slap me. That's why! You've to tolerate me. Can't avoid it. Are you seeing this or not? Why would you see this? Gunasekhar! Will you tell the story or not?
