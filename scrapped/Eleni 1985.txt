 

                        (CHURCH BELL) (GOAT BELLS JINGLE) (MAN) I don't know the names. - And are you going back? - Maybe. What crimes did you commit during the war? I thought we weren't going to talk about that. You don't have anything to worry about. You can't be prosecuted, so why not? What crimes did you commit during the war? They weren't crimes when I committed them. They became crimes when we lost the war. - Larry would like to see you, Nick. - Can it wait? Why? What's up? - You got the job. - In Athens? But you didn't hear it from me, OK? Hear what? Congratulations. (TV) The magic number is eight. Any combination of eight wins... - Dad? ...and the Sox win the Eastern Division. Now turning to basketball. Last night the Celtics won over the Rockets. A strong performance by Larry Bird... Nikki. Dad, if you always fall asleep during the news, you'll never keep up. I know, but if I stay awake for the news, I get so upset at what I hear, I can't sleep at night. I'll make some coffee. My grandson's birthday's coming up. Does he want a bicycle? I don't know. He's a big boy. Nine years old. The same age as I was when I left Greece. And I'm now the same age as Mother was when she was killed. - I got that job in Athens. - But you promised Eleni. Didn't she make you promise that you'd never go back? Nick? Yes, I promised. I want to know why they tortured her, why they killed her. What it was like to suffer the way she did. Why do you want to know that? Because I can't think of anything else. Sometimes people say things before they're killed or about to die, and I want to know what her last words were. Everything. - Why now, all of a sudden? - Things are converging. You should forget these things. I tried. But there is one thing I can't forget, this wonderful legal invention called the statute of limitations. After a certain amount of time, you're absolved of all your crimes. You committed atrocities during the war. If you wait long enough, as if by magic, you become innocent again. In Greece, you wait 30 years for innocence. Thirty years are up. The murderers, hiding in other countries, are free to go back now. The man responsible for my mother's death could be innocent now. And I sit here drinking coffee. Nikki, you have waited all this time for that? Thanks. No pencils. Nick, is that you? Nick? Nick? (BABY BABBLES) - Hey! - (GIGGLES AND BABBLES) Thank you. Dear Mother of God, we thank you for these blessings. Dear Mother... I... We... Nick? There you go. One, two, three... - Oh! - Bad luck. It's $2,000. Nikola! (BOARD GAME CHATTER) (CHILDREN SING HYMN) Christ is risen! Indeed He is risen. - Christ is risen. - Indeed He is risen. - Does Father know that the war is over? - Of course he knows. - (MAN) Christ is risen! - Indeed He is risen. You said when the war was over he'd write to tell us when he's coming. You said by Easter we'd get a letter. The war, the bombs, they destroyed all the post offices. The ships that carry the letters across the sea were sunk. All these things take time to rebuild. Like our schoolhouse. It just takes time. (SINGING CONTINUES) Christ is risen, cousin. (BELL STOPS RINGING) (PRIEST SINGS PRAYER) You're old enough to stand with the men now. Go on. (CONGREGATION SINGS RESPONSES) (SINGING CONTINUES) (BLESSING IN GREEK) (SINGING CONTINUES) (A SCREAM) Nick? Are you all right? No, I'm not. Your father called me after you left the house today. I thought he might. He thinks I have some influence over you, being your wife and all. Don't give me that look! How am I supposed to understand? I don't want to argue with you. Why do you have to go back? We can work it out together here. Here is not the problem. What are you going to do in Athens? What I normally do. I report stories. - What stories? - All kinds. Yeah, about former Civil War criminals returning after 30... I'm aware of that. Maybe they're all dead. Gosh, I hope not. If they aren't, what will you do with these old men? Probe them a bit, ask them a few questions. - What if they don't answer? - Then I'll rephrase the question. Nick, is it a requirement of being a bureau chief in Athens to carry a gun? Is it? It used to be in the study, then it disappeared. Where is it? Is that how you'll ask questions, with a gun? No, you're a reporter, you don't have to answer questions, just ask them. - Nick, I know about your mother... - I don't think you do. You want to ruin everything over something from some 30 years ago? "Some 30 years ago"? "Some"? People don't get murdered at "some" point in time. It wasn't "some" to her. It was a specific year, month, day, hour, minute. A specific second when the trigger was pulled. Even then she was alive until a split second later. The bullet ended her life. It wasn't "some" to her. Not "some" at all. Before there was England, there was Greece. Before there was America, there was Greece. And long before Greece was a monarchy, we were a democracy. What is another name for a democracy? - Republic. - That's right. And the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a democracy. In a democracy, all of us play an important part. We... We pass laws. And we obey them. If you went home after school, the doors were closed and your parents wouldn't let you inside ever again, could you still believe they really loved you? No. No. Well, the King, from inside his palace, says he loves his people. (MAN) Spiro! (INAUDIBLE) (CHILDREN YELLING) Where's your teacher? You, that way! Go that way! (KNOCKING) - Good evening, Eleni. - Good evening, Katina. The government militia is arresting all the communists. - Spiro is my cousin. - I know that. I'd hide him in my house, but that'd be the first place they'd look. - So I beg you... - And if they find him here? They won't search your house. Your father's a monarchist, your husband's in America. Everyone knows where your sympathies lie. My sympathies? I have no sympathies, as you call them. Then I seek refuge in the only neutral house in all of Greece. You'll have to stay in the cellar. I have grown daughters, you understand. I'm sorry you're in trouble, Spiro. But I do enjoy this sneaking around at night. It makes me feel young! Give me a kiss, cousin. Be careful, Eleni. He kisses very nice. I'm a teacher, Eleni. I'm not a revolutionary. They're turning me into one because I want to teach that everyone is a king. And a king is just another human being. What's wrong with that? I don't know. Please. Thank you, Eleni. (NOIS Y STREET SOUNDS) How did you find out about me? I've only been here a week. It will only take a few minutes. It's a wonderful story. A Greek boy goes to America, he returns as the "New York Times" bureau chief to write about his native land. It would make me happy if you'd appear with me on TV. Well, in that case... Gentlemen! Nikola! - Nikola! - Yes! He's alive! Your father is alive! America! We're going to America! (BO YS CHEER) (EVERYONE GASPS) (THEY CHATTER AND EXCLAIM) - Can I go, Mana? - Whoa. Yes, go on. (ELENl) Georgia... Ana, for the baby. Open it! - Open it! - Where's she going? - What was that? - Probably dollars. There's no telling how many in one envelope. "My dear wife, "my dearest daughters, "and you, Nikola, "my son whom I have not seen..." (CHATTERING) "Business was good, then it was bad, and soon I think it will be good again. "I will start looking for a house for us all. "I have become a citizen of America..." - (ELENl) lmagine that! - He's not Greek any more? It says, "I have become a citizen of America. "I am no longer a foreigner "and I can now vote for President and Mayor of New York. "Eleni, my beautiful and loving wife, "take good care of our children while I work and save money for our home. "All of you live in my heart. "And soon I hope to see and embrace... "...and embrace each one of you. "I kiss your eyes and those of my angel children. "I, your loving husband, write this." How will I speak to Father when we go to America? What do you mean? I'm worried. He's been there a long time, and maybe he only speaks American. - Maybe he forgot Greek. - No, I wouldn't worry about that. I think we should go there soon, just in case. Why don't we surprise him? "Hello, Father, here we all are!" (ELENI LAUGHS) It's a long way, you know. It's across the ocean. You have to have an invitation. When you get to America, they say, "Who invited you to come?" Like to a wedding. But if he loves us, why doesn't he send us an invitation? Because he's saving all his money to build us a fine house with enough rooms for everybody. I know the problem: There's too many of us. - You have too many children. - No. I need all my children. But when we go to America, will Father call you "my beautiful and loving wife"? - What, like in the letter? - Yes. Well, I hope so. Maybe you will only love him. And you won't love me any more. No. I will always love you. Why? (BO YS SHOUT) Nick! Hey, Nick, here it is. I never forget a funeral. He died of cancer a few months ago. - Did you know him? - Yeah, he was my school teacher. - Is this a coincidence or what? - What? All these dudes were Civil War criminals. I'm thinking about doing an article on their return to Greece. Oh, yeah? I already did that story. It's been out for a while. You haven't read it? I did. - Yeah? What was wrong with it? - Too general. - Too general for whom? - For me. - Were you really born in Greece? - Yes. That explains your sunny Mediterranean personality! This guy insists on talking to you, Nick. He saw you on TV. That's great. The bureau chief of the "New York Times" is a TV personality. Lay off. Who is it? He says you grew up together. His name's Antoni Makos. Hello? (WHIRR OF MACHINERY) This is my old friend, Nikola Gatzoyiannis. (MACHINE STOPS) We grew up in the same village. We used to have sword fights, remember, Nikola? We saw our first aeroplane together. And now he's an American. Nikola! I thought we were going to talk about old times. These are old times. I didn't know you'd seen my mother when I came here. I'm sorry I mentioned it. Go on. You said you were drinking water at the spring. She looked at me, you know, in that way. What way? (ANTONl) You know what children meant to our mothers. They see a boy who's not even theirs and they look at him in that way. That's how she... You're an educated man. Why do you think our mothers loved us so much? I have children of my own, but I find it hard to... Do you have children? Did my mother say anything to you? No. - Do you go to Lia often? - I don't go back now. I went back once a few years ago. Spent the night in loannina. - I saw that man. - What man? That guerrilla who led the prisoners to the execution site. - Are you sure it was him? - He said he was stationed in our village. Do you know his name? Tasso Levendis. He didn't remember me. Does he still live in loannina? Don't know. When I saw him, he was in a bar, pimping, offering me women. (CLANGS) Listen! Listen! Listen! The government is warning all the people in this area that we can no longer protect you. Communist guerrillas are advancing. Civil war has begun. Father, what should I do? You? What are you afraid of? You're a woman! It's me they'll kill first. They know I'm for the King. Long live the King. Goodbye. - Mother, should we go to loannina? - Who'll look after your home? - It's your duty to look after your home. - Yes, but my children... These aren't Germans, Turks or Albanians. They're our own people. They won't harm women and children. Lukas? - Lukas, are you staying? - Yes. My wife has convinced me I'm too worthless for the communists. If they kill me, it'll prove how wrong she is! It's finally come to this. We've been invaded by everybody. Now we're being invaded by ourselves. Go. Go quickly. (ECHOES) People of Lia! People of Lia! You have nothing to be afraid of! We have come to liberate you... ...in the name of the new Greece! Everybody in the house. (DOGS BARK) Out! Everybody out! Out! - Come on, Mother. - Come on! We won't see you in any harm. Outside! Everybody outside! Spiro. Thank God it's you. Major Spiro Skevis, Democratic Army of Greece. I have the honour to inform you this village has been liberated. Your house has been chosen to be the HQ of the Army of Liberation. You'll be out of the house by tomorrow morning. But Spiro, don't you remember when Katina brought you here? I remember. Be out of the house by tomorrow, Americana. (INAUDIBLE) It's only a house. It's just stone and mortar. And wood and glass. All of you were born here and so that makes it special. Memories make it special. But we can take those wherever we go. Some day, we'll all be together like this, all packed and ready. And instead of moving to Grandmother's, we'll be leaving across the ocean where your father is waiting for us. It will feel just like this. We'll take our belongings and our memories, and we'll leave this house for ever. But we won't be sad, because we'll all be together. That's what's important. We mustn't be sad tomorrow. Take 'em in there! Animals and food stay behind. I have a family to feed. I have an army to feed. Anyone hiding food will be shot. Those are our orders. - I will obey your orders. - Mana, what will we eat? One thing more, Americana! All your able-bodied men have fled. I need soldiers. Each household will volunteer their eldest daughter to fight for the army. Olga, you will have the privilege. Spiro... Major Skevis, I gave you my house and food. But Olga knows nothing about fighting. Please, I beg you. We will teach her. You've two days together, then she's ours. - Mana... - Sh! We're at war and those are orders. Anyone who disobeys will be dealt with accordingly. Understood? We will obey your orders. Mana! Mana, don't let them take me away...! What do you think I can do? Olga. They had to do this in the old days. The Ottoman Turks came gathering all the boys for their armies. To save them, their mothers cut off their fingers. Sometimes they gouged out one of their eyes. I won't be a cripple, will I? I'll never marry if... (OLGA SCREAMS) No, Mana! Where is your husband, Mother? Where is my father? Where is her father and my husband? Where are our men? Have I been told lies all my life? Eleni! You're a woman, you're forgetting your place! Is this my place, Mother, to torture my own child? Is it my place to stay behind? Always to stay behind when our men run off? In return for what? Mana! No! They put me in charge of food supply, so I... - How could you? - They were going to take her! They? What they? - I've tried to save my child! - These are our own people. Don't! My child... Yes. But not some animal to be hobbled. Get out! Take your food and your advice and get out! (HER SOBBING CONTINUES) Olga Gatzoyiannis is requested to join the People's Democratic Army. Major Skevis... please. My daughter is so clumsy, she spilled boiling water on her leg. She can hardly stand. Remove the bandages. You should teach your daughter to be more careful, Americana. All unmarried girls over 15 may join the People's Democratic Army. Have your daughter Glykeria prepare to leave. And be careful, Americana, no more accidents. (ACCORDION PLAYS LIVELY TUNE) (INAUDIBLE) (HE WHISTLES) You must be the famous Tasso Levendis. I hear that if you want a woman you're the man to see. I know some women, yes. Money's no object. I know a lot of women. Let's get in my car and take a drive. You have a car. - You've missed a turn there. - I want to go home first for more money. (TYRES SCREECH) Where's your home? A little village called Lia. Lia? Are you crazy? It's over 50 kilometres from here! You know the place? You've been there before? Hey, what's going on? Who the hell are you? I wouldn't do that if I were you, unless you want to bounce. (TAPE CLICKS ON) - I saw that man. - What man? That guerrilla who led the prisoners to the execution site. - Are you sure it was him? - I really wasn't. So I talked to him and he said he was stationed in our village. Do you know his name? Tasso Levendis. Get out. (CLICKS DOOR LOCKS) - (ENGINE STARTS) - (GUNSHOT) I was not on the execution squad. I just brought the prisoners to the site. Your mother had a trial. The judge ordered her confession. The judge sentenced her to death. It was legal! - She was tortured. - Torture, too, was legal! - Who gave the order? - The same judge. - His name? - His revolutionary name was Katis. - I don't know his name! - Where is he? I don't even know if he's alive! - Where did he hide after the war? - Czechoslovakia, when we lost the war. Some people from your village went with us. - Where in Czechoslovakia? - Bratislava! (JEERING LAUGH) It's too late! Even if you find him, you won't find him. You'll find an old man who used to be Katis. Just like you found me, an old pimp, who used to be a soldier! If you live long enough, it seems you cease to exist! You're too late! We're all dead and gone! (MAN) One, two, three, four... (WOMAN) One, two, three, four... (WOMAN) Quicker! Quicker! (WOMAN)... three, four... Careful! (RAPID GUNFIRE) Who are you? Eleni Gatzoyiannis, wife of Christos, from Lia. - Come with us, you're saved. - I can't. My children. No! No! My children! These people you're looking for, they're relatives? Well, relatives and friends from my village. I've been told that they fled here after the Greek Civil War. Yes, we have many Greeks living here. Too many. First, we kept the records in order, but as you can see... If you find any relatives, take them with you. (SPEAKING GREEK) Next! Name? Gatzoyiannis. Go ahead. Next! Move on! (GENERAL MUTTERINGS) Comrades. Comrades! I welcome you in the name of the Democratic Army of Greece. Mothers of Lia, your children are in danger. The fascist government's attacks on your village will continue. If your children are not killed by bombs or bullets... they'll die slowly from starvation. What little food we have left has to be rationed out to our fighters. But... because of the party's great concern and love for your children, our leaders have found a way to save them. We've called you all here today to announce that the People's Democracies of Albania and Czechoslovakia have opened their arms to your children. They will take them, care for them, feed them well. And educate them to become lawyers, doctors, engineers. Whatever their talents permit. And when the civil war is over and the red flag flies, they will come back to you, tall, healthy, happy. Ready to take their place in the new Greece. Who will be the first to volunteer her children? Who will be the first? Katina, for the love of God! We have our first patriotic mother. Katina Skevis. You wish to volunteer, Comrade Skevis? Yes. I would like to volunteer some advice to you, Mr Comrade-ln-A-Blue-Suit. My husband died in the war, fighting for your cause. I carried on the dream he whispered to me once in the night of a better life for my children. My children. Not yours. Not the party's. Not the People's Democracies of Albania or anywhere. Mine. No mother will give up her children. There are no volunteers... here. (INAUDIBLE) (MURMURING) (GASPS) Mothers of Lia, you know your children are hungry. Your children can eat like this... ...every day... ...if you let them go. Any child who steps forward at this moment... ...can have as much bread and marmalade as he or she can eat. - Mana, I'm so hungry. - No. Left the country. Albania. Dead. Left the country. Soviet Union. She's still here. Not as pretty as she was in the picture. Dead. Left the country. Where? It doesn't say. - When? - It doesn't say. - Was he a friend or a relative? - A friend of the family. It says here he had no identification on him. What was his full name? I just remember him by Katis. He's probably dead. I'm going off duty. If you want, I can tell you where to find that woman. Yes? I'm looking for Ana Katroubis. Who are you? Nick... Nikola Gatzoyiannis. - Eleni's son? - Yes. What do you want from me? You must know I didn't do it on purpose. I was forced to testify against your mother. You must know that. Yes, I... I knew that. I didn't come here to blame you for anything. I did it to save my son. The judge, he told me I had to join the guerrillas, to be a soldier. My baby would have died. There was nobody to look after him. So I sinned against my soul to save my child. I understand that you had no choice. The judge, what was his name? - Stavros Petrakis. - He called himself Katis at the time. The officials at the bureau told me that he had died a few years ago. They don't know anything. He's back in Greece! We're too ashamed to return, but he's not? Where in Greece is he? Where in Greece is he? (SHOUTS) Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! (BO Y'S CRIES CONTINUE) Eleni... Mana! (GUNSHOT) Mana! They said "volunteers". We can only hope and pray. We must do more than hope, Mother. - If we do as we're told... - No! Mother, you've brought me up the best way you knew how. - The way I was raised. - Yes. To obey and to know my place and never to complain. And in all that sunshine of my life, I have lived in the shade of somebody else's authority. There were flowers in my heart, Mother. But there are some flowers that never blossom in the shade. It was the price I paid to be like everyone else. I didn't complain, and I'm not complaining now. But I am saying, "No more." They took our food. They took my home. They took my dignity. And I gave in at every turn. But I will not give them my children. They will not take them from me. Escape? Are you mad? With children? - There are guards and landmines! - You know where the mines are. You know where the guards are. They've taken my Glykeria already. I can't just wait. If we get caught, they'll kill us. If they take my children, it'll be worse than dying. He doesn't understand. He's a man. Suddenly I'm promoted! I'm a man! - When were you planning? - Tomorrow night. - I'm getting a headache. - There's no time to lose. They might come for the children at any moment. - Everyone would respect you. - Please. No respect. In Greece, only the dead are respected. (COCKEREL CROWS) Mana, soldiers are coming! Somebody betrayed us. We need a woman from your household for a work detail. Yes, I'll come! Not now. We're rounding everybody up first. Bring extra clothing for three to four weeks. No, I can't! We leave in an hour. That's an order! They only want a woman to work. I'll go in your place. They wouldn't take you, Mother, you're too old. Oh, why now? Why today? We'll take care of everything while you're gone. - When you come back... ...you'll be far away! You're all leaving tonight just as we planned! Listen to me. We can't wait. Three or four weeks is a long time. They could come for Nikola or Fotini any day. Olga, listen to me. You are the oldest, you must take my place. When you are safe, write to your father and tell him what has happened. He will find a way to send for you. He loves you. - Not like you, Mana. - I'll be all right. It may be better this way. I can help Glykeria escape. Then the two of us will join you in America. We will! Come quickly! Gather round me while we still have time. Sit down. Come on, sit down. You have never seen the sea. It's beautiful. It's big and blue and endless as the sky. It makes you dream to look at it. And so you will dream of a new life in your new home, and when you wake up, it will be there. You stay here. Don't let them see you cry. My children... ...I bless you all. You must go away and you must never come back. Do you understand me? Yes, Mana. Here, take this. When you are safe, throw it behind you. When you throw a black stone, it means you will never return. Promise me you will do this. I promise. Kiss me this one time. My heart and blood. Sh! (INAUDIBLE) - You got a cigarette? - No. Oh, all right. (CHILD CRIES) (NICK) Dear Joan, I'm sorry I haven't called or written. My dear Joan... My dear... children. Dear family... I am back in my grandmother's house. I took my last walk with my mother from here. Out the door and up the hill. She held my hand and made me promise I'd never come back. We'd planned our escape here, and I've only just realised something. Escape routes exist when you're a child. All kinds of escape routes are possible. Then, when you grow up, they vanish, and you have to live without them. Anyway, I kiss your eyes and those of my darling children. Your husband sends these words. (JARRING WHINE) (IN GREEK) I'm looking for Eleni Gatzoyiannis. Well? All the relatives of the escaped have been locked up. Except for Eleni Gatzoyiannis. - The Americana? - Yes, sir. This soldier allowed them to escape? Their escape route went past his post. He stood on one of our mines. Lock him up. Don't give medicine to traitors. Traitors? He was wounded while in pursuit. Peasants and children! Our army can be outwitted by peasants and children? If so, the word of this escape will inspire others in this territory. He was a collaborator. He was bribed by the Americana and her dollars. He was wounded while trying to escape. Please, get me a signed confession to that effect. We're going to have a trial, Americana. And at that trial, in front of all the people, you're going to confess your crimes. What crimes? What have I done? You collaborated with the enemy. You transmitted vital military information. No! All I did was to help my children escape. That's all. Escape? This is a liberated village. What were they escaping from? Your village is loyal to our cause. I have sent reports to my superiors stating that loyalty. How am I going to explain this escape to my superiors? - Hm? - I don't know. (BLOODCURDLING SCREAMS) - (THWACK) - (SCREAMS) (SCREAMING) - Citizens of Lia! - Sh! For some time now, there's been a fascist organisation in existence in your own village. I am happy to inform you that thanks to the vigilance of our guerrilla intelligence, this organisation has been uncovered. The criminals before you have endangered all our lives by passing on vital military information to the enemy with the 20 traitors who fled from Lia. All of you must abhor their treachery. There they are. Andreas Mikopoulos. Spiridon Mikopoulos. Vasili Nikou. Alexo Gatzoyiannis. Elias Gratos. Eleni Gatzoyiannis. The Americana! She was never one of you. How many of you had packages from America? While you starved, she feasted. While you worked, she plotted. Americana, you are charged with organising the escape and trying to bribe the citizens of Lia with your American money. That's not true. I have done nothing wrong. (CHILD GIGGLES) I have done no harm. And I have wished no harm to anyone. All I wanted was for my children to be safe with their father. By refusing to send her children to socialist countries, she betrayed the goals of our revolution. By sending them to fascists, she betrayed us all. Who will speak in her defence? (MUTTERINGS) It is against the law to withhold information of guilt or innocence. So I ask, if any of you have proof of the Americana's innocence or guilt, step forward now and speak. We have a witness. Comrade Katroubis. Yes, I have something to say. She, Eleni Gatzoyiannis... (BABY CRIES) ...the Americana, she tried to bribe me with her American dollars to turn against you and join the fascist cause. - Ana... - You did, you tried to bribe me. But I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it. Katis, the children are leaving. Citizens of Lia, our children are about to leave for Albania and Czechoslovakia. We will take a short pause in the proceedings of this trial, in order to permit their parents to say goodbye. (CONFUSION OF PLEAS AND CRIES) (CHILDREN PLAY NOISILY) (INAUDIBLE) Citizens of Lia, the People's Court, having found the accused guilty of treason, is now ready to pass sentence. Andreas Mikopoulos, - death by firing squad. - (VILLAGERS GASP) Vasili Nikou, death by firing squad. Eleni Gatzoyiannis, death by firing squad. Spiro, when do we die? Tomorrow morning. Do you know where my daughter is? Can I see her? One last time? (SOLDIER) You, move! Please, Spiro. Open up. - Glykeria! - Mana. Aah... - (SHE WEEPS) - Sh...! Sh! Don't cry. Don't cry. Oh, look, they've cut your hair. Never mind, it will grow back. It's been hard for you, I know. - But you must be strong. - Mana! No. Listen, you must live. You must live. You have something wonderful to look forward to. Some day, you will marry and have children of your own. It is such a joy... ...to be a mother. It is such a joy. And I thank God for letting me know it. Go now. Don't wait for them to separate us. Goodbye, my child. May you live for me as long as the mountains. Go... now. Load! Aim! My children! Fire! (ECHOES) My children! - Those were her last words? - "My children." I was hidden over there. I saw her. Mana... (TAPE) The judge, what was his name? (ANA) Stavros Petrakis. (NICK) He called himself Katis at the time. (NICK) The officials at the bureau told me that he had died a few years ago. (ANA) They don't know anything. (ANA) He's back in Greece! (ANA) We're too ashamed to return, but he's not? (NICK) Where in Greece is he? Where in Greece is he? (ANA) In the town. Saloniki. Yes? Can I help you? I think I have the wrong address. I am looking for Stavros Petrakis. I'm his wife. Is it about the pension? No. My name is Nick Gage, "New York Times". I have an appointment with your husband. Appointment? He didn't say anything... Come in. You shouldn't open the door by yourself! I told you before! - There's a man from New York. - What? A man from New York. He says he has an appointment with you. My wife says that we've got an appointment of some kind. My name is Nick Gage, "New York Times". "New York Times"? You didn't say "New York Times", you just said New York! I'm doing an article about the evolution of the Greek judicial system. The Minister of Justice in Athens suggested I speak with you. Wait a minute! Now I remember. I saw you on the television. Well, apparently there's been a little breakdown in communications. The Minister was supposed to telephone you about this interview. Sorry to bother you. I can come back at a more convenient time. Oh, please... Oh... all I have these days is convenience. No, no, it's perfect. Please... sit down. Go and get our guest something to eat. Yeah, "New York Times". Oh, look... Let me just go and... I was taking a little nap. Had I known... I'll be right back. Sit. Sit! (INAUDIBLE) So... I'm all yours. I've ordered that we should not be disturbed. I really appreciate your cooperation. On the contrary, I'm very grateful to you. You've made me very happy. My wife and my daughter are sick of my stories of the Civil War. And you come all this way, The "New York Times" yet. They're in there now, plotting how to deal with me when you leave. Please. Shall we start? Testing, one, two, three. Testing, one, two, three. Stavros Petrakis. (REWINDS) Testing, one, two, three. Which side were you on in the Civil War? On the side of Greece, of course. It wasn't so much a war, you understand, as a... No, it was a battle of ideas. To me, Greeks have always clung to the notion that man's life is ruled by ideas. And the period in question... ...it was an exhilarating time. Wonderful bread. Home-made. You must try it. - No, I'm not hungry. - Please, you must. It's fresh. The wheat comes from my village. You can't buy bread like this, especially not in America. Please, Nick. No, no. You were born in Greece, I shall call you Nikola. - If you don't mind? - No, I don't mind. And your parents are in America? My father is, yes. - And your mother? - My mother remained in Greece. Although I've heard some wonderful things about America, some of our people chose to stay... My mother didn't actually choose to stay. She had some legal problems during the Civil War. There was a trial, there were witnesses, there was a judge. - What side was she on? - She was on the civilian side. Were you ever involved in trials of civilians? No, that's impossible. There are no civilians in a civil war. If you're looking for your mother, maybe I could be of some assistance. You see, I've got some friends... My mother was executed. Death by firing squad. Her name was Eleni Gatzoyiannis. Some called her Americana. Do you remember her? Remember her? I don't understand. About 800 kilometres away from here, there's a village called Lia. Do you remember that village? - Lia? - Lia. No. No, I... I don't think that I have ever been to a village by that name. Some names change, but this village is still called Lia. You, I believe, were called Katis at that time. Katis? No. No, I was never... I think maybe you made a big mistake. Why are you still alive? How can you live, knowing what you've done? I think you'd better leave. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm talking about Eleni Gatzoyiannis, my mother. I'm not interested in your mother! Sit down. Sit down. You don't deserve to die standing up. Sit down! (ECHOES) My children! (GUNSHOT RESOUNDS) Don't be afraid. (NICK) My dear family, I'm sending you this tape. I'll be coming home soon. The hunt for my mother's killer is over. I did not inherit the necessary hate to end a human life. I am still mystified by the love my mother felt for me and my sisters. The question of being worth it or not is no longer applicable. I accept it as something she gave me. I accept her love as my inheritance. I miss you and I love you. I miss and love my children. I hope with all my heart the love I've discovered is not for mothers alone. I want to feel it, too. I have a need to feel it. To share the inheritance my mother left me with you and my children. I know that they are not just my children. I know that they are ours. I may be late in returning home to claim them, but I hope you can understand my need to say those words. My children.
