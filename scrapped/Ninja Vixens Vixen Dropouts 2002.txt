Shingen Takeda of Kai took in girls who were orphaned or lost. They were trained as priestesses in name but ninja vixens in reality. Two to three hundred priestesses were being trained at the school. Script: OTO Producer: Ryoji SAEHARA Two to three hundred "priestesses" were being trained at the school. Class "I" and Class "Ro" The 47 letters of the alphabet were used to name each class. There were 47 classes, grouped by ability in the order of "I", "Ro", "Ha". Nozomi FUJIKAWA There were 47 classes, grouped by ability in the order of "I", "Ro", "Ha". Nozomi FUJIKAWA Nozomi FUJIKAWA There was yet another class just for students left behind and... There was yet another class just for students who couldn't keep up. Miyu INABA Airi HAZUKI There was yet another class just for students who couldn't keep up. Miyu INABA Airi HAZUKI Miyu INABA Airi HAZUKI It was the 48th class... It was the 48th class... Takashi TANIGUCHI It was the 48th class... Takashi TANIGUCHI as known as Class "N". Takashi TANIGUCHI as known as Class "N". as known as Class "N". Only the Class "N" training facility was located deep in the mountains of Kai... Director: Mineko TAKEUCHI so that they were prevented from distracting the other students. In the heart of Kai-Shinano mountains In the heart of Kai-Shinano mountains Village of Bush Warblers Class of "N" This is the Class "N" teacher, Cloud. "He's" a she, despite her appearance. Class "N" Teacher, Cloud (Female) This is the Class "N" teacher, Cloud. "He's" a she, despite her appearance. This is the Class "N" teacher, Cloud. "He's" a she, despite her appearance. She's gonna kill us! What's wrong, Ayane? Get up! Instructor Cloud is wilder than usual. Maybe she started her period. Her cycle is 28 days and it started on the 15th. So today is the second day. That's tough. No wonder. Next, Tsunami! Instructor Cloud, may I use a ninja power? As you wish. Thank you. Ninja vixen's ninja power... "Flowers Ablaze!" Your introduction is too long. Next, Misty! You call that a disguise, you old hag? Next, Pomegranate! Yes, ma'am! Ninja vixen's ninja power... "Towering Rage!" That's not a ninja power! It's just a fat woman's feat of strength! Damn! Next, Treetop! A blowgun dart? Don't think! Just blow! Who goes there! Shizu, what's up? Here's the message from the Master. "It seems that some Wind Demon ninjas infiltrated our land." "Be alert at all times." Wind Demon ninjas? Did you hear that? Wind Demon ninjas! Who's that woman? It's Shizu from Class "Ro". No wonder. She looks sharp. You know everything, Sis Misty. Thanks to 40 years of being a ninja vixen. It's 35 years! Damn it... I need to go now, Instructor Cloud. Thank you. Let me give you back the ninja star from earlier. Right. She caught it in mid air! Unbelievable! I could do that too. Long time ago. Your piercing look hasn't changed. Awesome! Did you see? That's what it takes to be in Class "Ro". Scum like all of you won't get there even in a hundred years. Meet me at Point Three in an hour! "Scum like us can't do it in a hundred years," huh? Who's teaching the scum then? Why doesn't she disappear like that? Her ninja power may be top-notch, but maybe she's ugly. Maybe she needs the head cover. What a bitch! Ouch! Ouch! The swelling is gone already! Because I'm young. By the way, how's your leg? Eating helps me heal fast. - Treetop! - What are you doing, Tsunami? Please stop! Treetop, when did you grow so big? What are you talking about? Unbelievable! Tsunami, let me use your mirror. You don't need it, do you? Excuse me. What? What do you need? Something's been bothering me. Something's been bothering you? What is it? The woman from Class "Ro" moved her lips to say some words. STRAY DOG Stray dog. Stray dog? Man, not that again. You know what it's all about? - Wanna hear? - Yes! Listen, this is between us. Ayane used to be in Class "I". What?! And that woman, Shizu, was also in Class "I" at the same time. She was in Class "I" too? One day they clashed over something. Shizu was demoted to Class "Ro" and Ayane came all the way down to "N". So, what happened? I don't know. Stray dog... stray dog... stray dog... Say that again? Say that again? I'll say it over and over again! An orphan with bad upbringing like you shouldn't be allowed in Class "I"! You bitch! Stray dog. Going wild again? That shows how lowly you've been since birth. You should belong to the class you rightly deserve. Stray dog. Let's go. Stray dog. Stray dog. I'm... I'm not a stray dog! I'm not a stray dog! Ninja Power, Shooting Stars Ninja Power, Shooting Stars Be more serious! Ninja Power, Shooting Stars Oh, dear... You idiot! Listen, when a ninja can no longer fulfill her duty, it's time for her to die. If you don't like that... Get strong! More! - Get strong. - Get strong. More! - Get strong! - More! Moron! Run all the way to the Ryujin River! Go, go, go, go, go! Which class do you belong? N! Which class? N! - N! - Which class? Gimme a second helping. It's so delicious! Looks yummy... I don't care if I die now. Ayane...? I wanna ask you something but I don't want you to get mad. That woman from Class "Ro" and you know each other, don't you? Misty must have told you, huh? Right. She and I were both in Class "I" long time ago. Treetop, you're good at reading lips. So you must've understood what she silently said. Yes. Stray dog. Ayane... It's no big deal. It's just a nickname they gave me when I was in Class "I". But still... I lost my parents in the war and the Master took me in. Most ninja vixens in the Takeda clan have backgrounds like that. You, too, Treetop. Yes. Same thing with Shizu. There should be no discrimination among orphans, but.. She sees me as a lowly barbarian. That's why I cut her face. Only the people in this class call me by my real name. When I came here, I was determined to go back to Class "I" soon. But, now, I feel comfortable here. Besides, what we do is pretty much the same wherever we are. Our ultimate goal is to be of service to the Master as walking priestesses. Isn't it right? Well, we'll have another day of training with Cloud the Demon. Let's go back to sleep. Morning time! Rise and shine! We'll work enthusiastically and happily again today! Ow! My leg cramped! If you were able to read my lips, write what I said in secret ninja code. Ninja Power, Lip Reading If you were able to read my lips, write what I said in secret ninja code. Ninja Power, Lip Reading You can go have lunch as soon as you get it right. Ninja Power, Lip Reading Secret Ninja Code Correct. Go have lunch. Sorry. I'll see you later. Correct. Time for some grub! If you don't want to eat, don't. Instructor Cloud, may I step forward? As you wish. Got it! What?! Instructor Cloud, could you do it a little more slowly? Are... you... an... idiot...? Got it! Hydration pill Hydration pill. Satiety pill Satiety pill. Fasting pill Fasting pill. These are all indispensable handy food for ninjas. You will obtain ingredients on your own, make them, and deliver them by 6pm. Now go! Yes, ma'am. What are you doing? Hurry up and go! Got it! Ah! I forgot a yam! What should I do? I've got to have a yam. Yam! I'm sorry. I yelled too loud. I didn't mean to surprise you, either. I thought no one was around. You want a yam? Well... um... Do you live around here? Y-Yes... I'm Yohei. I'm from Shishino Village. I see... See you. Hey, wait up. Isn't this what you want? Man... - You're taking a break too? - Yeah. - Hey, Tsunami. - What? What is it? Oh, nothing. Come on. Just spit it out! Do you know why you were assigned to our class? Yes, I do. It's because I'm stupid. No matter how many times men con me, I still fall for them. If I fall in love, I tell him everything. That's why I'm in Class "N". I see. Ayane, do you have a man you love? What? Well... um... the thing is... You've never slept with a man. So, you're a virgin. How cute. I didn't do it! - Who did it then? - How would I know? Don't lie to me! Why you... bitch! What's up with you? Do you want a piece of me? I'll be happy to take you on. What's going on? Misty's portable food is gone and she says I ate it! I know you took it! Don't waste your time. Hurry up and make the pills. Or Cloud the Demon is gonna roar. What do we do? I know... I have a great idea. What is it? I'll tell you. What?!?! Are you sure? You're gonna do it? Of course I will. I can't wait! By the way, where is Treetop? Sit down. Thank you. Ayane. Ayane! What? You like yams...? I'm a lumberjack, but I'm good at digging up yams too. So anytime... Thank you. Well... Wait up! I'm sorry! Are you all right? I'm all right. I guess Treetop will beat you to it. I have better taste than that. I don't think he's bad at all. There seems to be a ninja vixen who wants to get laid. Maybe we would be able to help. Are you sure it'll work? I'll be just fine. The hydration pill. Pass. Something is not right about Treetop. The satiety pill. Pass. Hey, did something happen? Like what? She's totally dreamy. It's like she's in a La-La Land. A woman changes... Hey, what are you yakking about? You won't get dinner or a bath... - We did it... - Really? Success? She's not dead, is she? Pomegranate, poke her. I don't want to. You do it! I don't want to either! Tsunami! No. Ayane! What?! Guess I have no choice... Since I concocted it, she won't wake up till the morning. All right! Let's go out on the town! We are literally walking priestesses. Anyway, you look awful in that outfit. Like you have room to talk? So, what do we do in town? What do we do? What do you wanna do, Tsunami? Of course, find a stud and you know the rest... I wanna enjoy hot sake first. I wanna eat as much as I can. What about you, Ayane? Everything you guys just said. But... We have no money. Without money we can't eat, and... we can't have sake either. I'm not sure about the studs, thought... Treetop, you can count on me. Yes. My wife doesn't cook for me anymore. You need to be firm with her. That happens as the years go by... By the way, aren't you gonna get married? I can't. I get nervous. Yeah, right. You get nervous? You just can't score big. That's all! Welcome! Ninja Vixens' Ninja Power... Way to go, Tsunami! Show them plenty. She will change three more times. One... Two... Three. Bubble Mirror. Ninja Power, Bubble Mirror Hi, boys. Don't rush. Get me in the mood first. I have a weakness for that sound. I love you. More... More... Give me more... This luscious young babe will... make... you... happy. How come it's not working on that old man? Tsunami's ninja power excludes anyone over 40 years old. Old man, use this to cover the bill. Another bowl! Sure, right away. Do this and this. Now try it. No, do it this way. Let me use this for a sec. Hey, you old geezer! Yes? What's your name? It's Genzo. Hey, Genzo. Don't you get any handsome customers here? There's a handsome guy right in front of you. - You? - Sure. Handsome? Sure. Everyone, listen! Who thinks this old man who looks like a raccoon dog is a hunk? Raccoon dog. Raccoon dog. Raccoon dog. Raccoon dog. Raccoon dog. Raccoon dog. If you enter now, you'll be in trouble. Hey, Ayane. What is it? Have you ever kissed a man? What?! Kiss. You know, kiss... You do this and then you push your lips against the other person's... Stop! It's gross. No, I haven't. You haven't? You really haven't? Gotta problem? You're not a good drunk. You seem to be having too much fun. What do you want? You didn't want me to see this, did you? Why don't you attack me... just like you did that time? Having a scar here is extremely disruptive to my missions. Even someone stupid like you would understand. If I didn't have this scar, I would've been able to stay in Class "I". Do whatever you like. You don't need to tell me. What are you doing? What are you doing to our beloved Ayane? If you do anything, we'll tell on you to the instructor of Class "Ro". Then you may get to come down to our Class "N". Humph! Ridiculous! All of you are trash! Come on. Get a hold of yourself. Ayane, let's go back. Cloud the Demon may be be awake by now. Well, let's get going. Let's go. Come on. Get a hold of yourself. Don't underestimate a stray dog. Ninja, Vixen, we want to ask you a question. Is there a Genzo Kosaka among them? Don't lie! Genzo Kosaka has a mole right here. If you know, find him yourself. - What did you say? - Boss. - What's your name? - It's Genzo. Hey, Genzo. Don't you get any handsome customers here? There's a handsome guy right in front of you. - You? - Sure. Handsome? Sure! - Let's go. - Sir. Get started with your training! Who the heck are you? That raccoon dog! Hey, Genzo, you can't be here! You insolent chicks! Down on your knees! Who do you think this is?! This is honorable Ambassador, Gonzo Kosaka, from the Takeda Army! All of you... That's enough. Sir! Ladies, how do you do? I've come here today... per our Master's request... to teach you what a man is all about. In a few years you will start traveling as "walking priestesses"... to collect information on locales and to be of service to Master Shingen. In order to fulfill your duty... you may need to fully utilize your young beautiful bodies. Right. You may need to let men enjoy your beautiful bodies. Unless you know exactly what to do when the time comes, you won't be able to manipulate them. Am I right? So, what I'd like you to do today is... to learn about men's mentality and their bodies... by having actual intercourse. That's it. Now, let's get started. Excuse me, Master Genzo Kosaka? Yes? What is it? Isn't there someone else? No, I'll do it myself. You mean, you... in person...? This is a special case. That's why I came here by myself. - By yourself? - Yes. All right then. If that's the case... - I'll be your partner. - What?! Master Genzo, please watch your step. Ladies, watch this carefully. Argh. I'm nauseous. That was gross. Treetop. Go for it already. Why don't they get it over with? She's not like you. What do you mean by that? Let's go back. But what about Treetop? We'll make up an excuse for her. Master Genzo. Here you are. Do you have good reason for sneaking out from the special lesson? We're sorry. Don't even let me remember... Where is Treetop? She went to dig up some yams for Master Genzo. That's very good. They're with the Wind Demon! Get ready! Listen, this is the first mission for Class "N". Protect the life of Master Genzo Kosaka at all costs! Don't hesitate to kill! Sir! Look! - Treetop! - It's a trap. Don't act impulsively! Who is he? Treetop's man. Treetops? He's probably bewitched by the Wind Demon's magic. For now we should fortify the defense and light a signal fire... and persevere until the reinforcements arrive! Treetop will be killed by then! Ayane! You're not to act on your own! What Master Genzo said is a time-tested tactic. That's right. However, Master Genzo, it only applies to other classes. What? Unfortunately, they are in Class "N". So what? I'll give you one more mission. Rescue Treetop! Are you going against my order? Listen. When a ninja can no longer fulfill her duty, it's time for her to die. - If you don't like that... - Get strong! - More! - Get strong! - More! - Get strong! Let's go! Pomegranate, go ahead! Ninja Power, Towering Rage! Ayane! Why you! Tsunami! Ninja Power... Make your introduction short! Flower Ablaze! Ninja Power, Flower Ablaze Flower Ablaze! That's too much pollen! All right! Everyone, on your knees! The Wind Demon agents are all dead. Right. Good job. I'm sure your accomplishment will certainly please our Master. We're most honored. But I will accept any punishment. If she needs to be punished, so do I. - Me, too. - Me, too. - Me, too. - Me, too Hold it. Who said she'd be punished. Everything went as I ordered. Everyone, let's start training! What?! What?! END
