What the f uck you know? You don't even keep your f ucking nails clean. I want to talk to you about morals. The morals of the young people today is gonna get them in big trouble. Because they act like they don't know the difference... ...between right and wrong. This is the truth. And one of the reasons is their parents. Parents are not taking care of the children. They don't tell them the difference between right and wrong. Wait now. No, ma'am. You have to listen. Because part of the responsibility is the children. Because this is their life. It's not their mama's or papa's. They have to think f or themselves. Even if their mama and papa didn't do something about it... ...the children have to think and try their best to come on up. -Take this girl here. -What about her? That child ain't a bit more married than the man in the moon. -How you doing? -Fine, how you doing? She's flirting with another man. Tell me she's married. -She's young. -She's loose. She's not loose. You were young once. Yeah, but I was never flitty. I was never flitty. She was never flitty. I need to talk to my f riend. What's wrong with you? Chicago gonna kick your ass. -You gonna play cards or sightsee? -Chicago, come on. -Chicago ain't gonna do shit. -You stupid? He'll kick your ass. -You're killing my action, girl. Stop. -lesha, what action? -What's up? -She trippin'. -She ain't doing nothing wrong. -You got nothing to do with this. -Calm down. -She know what she's doing. -Come on, girl. -Wait, don't start nothing. -I'm talking. I'm talking. -Come on now, don't start fighting. -What's wrong with you, man? -I can't talk to nobody? What's happening, man? -You mind if I take some f ood to go? -No, man. You go ahead. -My cuz! -Don't you worry. Something don't look right over here. I'm gonna have to get in this shit. -Chicago, stop. -Try to be cool. -Gonna get his ass. -We were just talking. Get your hands off me. Shit. -Fuck you. -Get out of my f ace. Why you gotta act up every time we go someplace? -Shut up. -Why the f uck you gotta act up? What's your problem?

I'm sick of this. You act like an alcoholic bitch. -Why you calling me a bitch? -All you do is get drunk. That's why I never go anyplace with you. You always acting crazy. Just like my damn mama. I'm sorry. God, I'm sorry, J. It's okay. It's gonna be all right. You just gotta f reeze up on that shit. I didn't know. I swear I didn't know. You're my best f riend, though. I don't wanna hurt you.

You need a f ashion tip, sweatshirt-wearing ass. Why y'all always fighting? I thought you were f riends. -I just work with him. -Fuck that nigga. Can I get some air? Breathing like a goddamn dragon. Anyway... Turn that shit up, man. A wise man once said, "Look at the ocean and realize... ... that no matter how famous you are or how much money you make... ...know that you'll never be as important as the ocean. " Why didn't I ao to colleae? Grandmamma would be rollina over in her arave two times if she saw me now. I wonder... No, he probably aot babies and shit. Look at him.

This ain't my motherf ucking day. I can't believe he hit me. Tired ass. He gonna get f ucked up, watch. Is it true the ribs can tell the kick Of a beast from a lover's fist? The bruised bones record it well The sudden shock, the hard impact Then swollen lids Sorry eyes spoke not of lost romance But of hurt Hate is often confused Its limits are in zones beyond itself And sadists will not learn that Love, by nature, extracts a pain Unequalled on the rack Why are we stopped? I don't know. I'll find out, though. They was gonna break up anyway. I remember when I was little... ...and my uncle Leon used to come around. He used to give me and my cousins change. He'd go to the liquor store and buy a 40-ounce of beer. Always throw us the change. I'd always ask f or the big nickel. I couldn't pronounce "quarter, " so that's what I called it. Look at your nails. Give me your hand. Come on, give me your hand. Anyway, so because of that, my grandmamma used to say... ...I was always looking f or the big nickel. -That's bef ore she died. -When did she die? About two years ago. She left me the house. When I was 12, my mama committed suicide. She named me Justice because she was in law school... ...when she was pregnant with me. I'm all alone now, though. I got a cat. Cute little cat. Damn. Give me your hand Make room for me to lead and follow you Beyond this raae of poetry Let others have privacy Of touchina words And love of loss of love For me, aive me your hand Look, I gotta tell you something. Shit, don't tell me you got something. No. I'm only telling you this because I care about you... ...and I think you should know bef ore we go any f urther. A little girl, huh? Why didn't you tell me in the beginning? I mean, how was I supposed to know what we was doing? I'm gonna go check on my cousin. Aunt Audrey. Kalil. Aunt Audrey. Kalil. Hey, where do you think you're going? -Kalil! -Shit, man, it's his cousin! -Yo, man, somebody shot Kalil. -Who shot him? What relationship is this woman to him? Just get away f rom me, man! Cover him up, man! Cover him up! What the f uck are you doing? -What's up? What room we in? -What happened to you? Don't touch me. If I had got there on time, this never would have happened. Instead of f ucking with you. What? So we scraping the bottom of the pudding cup now, huh? Know what you talking about bef ore you judge. Well, ex cuse me. I'm sorry. You even walk different. Let's go, fellas, all right? I don't got all day. Watch your head. I thought there was gonna be two of you. No, it's just me. -See you the next time around. -No, I don't think so. You don't fight no man with your fist. You fight him in his wallet. Instead of swinging at him, you should have gave him some. Wait till he went to sleep and took that credit card. -And we all would have had a party. -On him! What credit card? That nigga ain't got no credit card. -No credit cards? -Shit, then you is a f ool. -I'm telling you, men ain't shit. -Ain't that the truth. Ex cuse me? I thought you were in love. Well, you thought wrong. Don't be assuming shit, okay? When you assume, you make an ass out of you. Well, you were already an ass. You got a lot to learn about the world. Come on, y'all. Let's go get a drink. These little girls don't know their cooch f rom a hole in the wall. -But they gonna learn. -You got that right. 'Cause all I do is dress and rest. -'Cause love don't live here anymore. -Come on, Jessie. Morning, Lawrence. You hungry, baby? Come here and get something to eat. I ain't hungry. Too mad to eat. Audrey. Audrey, sit down. Sit down. You gonna wear yourself out. Lawrence. Shante, check that chicken, baby. Make sure it don't burn. Lawrence. I want you to know, you my f avourite nephew. Your mama and l, even though we're sisters, we don't always get along. But I was always happy that you and Kalil were like brothers. Family's got to stick together, no matter what. Aunt Audrey, I know you're probably not thinking about this right now. Probably ain't important to y'all. But it's important to me... ...to know what you're gonna do with the equipment. We gonna sell it. We need the money. Why don't you mind your business? He put every dollar he had into that equipment. You just gonna f uck it up? -Watch your mouth. -I'm serious. You know he did. What you think we should do? Give it to me. I'll do something with it. I'll do what he would have wanted me to do.: Use it. Tell Annie I said " hi." And I love you. I love you too. Pretty women wonder Where my secret lies I'm not cute Or built to suit a fashion model's size But when I start to tell them They think I'm tellina lies I say, it's the reach of my arms The span of my hips The stride of my step The curl of my lips I'm a woman, phenomenally Phenomenal woman, that's me I walk into a room Just as cool as you please And to a man, the fellows stand Or they fall down to their knees Then they swarm around me Like a hive of honey bees I say, it's the fire in my eyes The flash of my teeth The swina in my waist And the joy in my feet I'm a woman, phenomenally Phenomenal woman, that's me -Damn! -Daddy, could we go to the store? Go in the living room. It's too dangerous in here. Men themselves have wondered What they see in me They try so much But they can't touch my inner mystery When I try to show them They still can't see I say, it's the arch of my back The sun of my smile The ride of my breasts And the arace of my style I'm a woman, phenomenally Phenomenal woman, that's me Now you understand Just why my head's not bowed I don't have to shout or jump about Or have to talk real loud When you see me passina It ouaht to make you proud I say, it's the click of my heels The bend of my hair The palm of my hand The need for my care I'm a woman, phenomenally Phenomenal woman, that's me Don't look at me. Look at her. Sitting over there in that cheap dress. -Acting like she don't know you. -She know who I am. -Plastic Payless shoes. -Cheap-ass weave. Ain't even human hair. The bitch got yak hair in her head. Is there a problem? If you don't quit staring, I'm gonna slap you. We're not having that here. You take it to the street. -We could take it out. -Don't you mess with my man! Remember this: Every time you kiss him, you tasting my pussy. -You got to go! -That's wrong. -Please, darling, cool it down. -She need to whup her ass. None of that! I'm kind of tired too. Watch yourself. What's up? -How much is it? Twenty-five? -Yeah. Thanks. Ex cuse me. -What's up? -Who's this? -Keisha. -Hi, Keisha. My name is Justice. -Can we sit down f or a few minutes? -Yeah, sure. -She's so cute. -This is my baby. Look... It took me a long time to come down here. I mean, I know I made a mistake. But everybody make mistakes. And I had a lot on my mind. I'm sorry. I apologize. Forgive me? Come here. I wanna whisper something to you. Get the f uck out of here. I ain't f alling f or that again. No, f or real, though. Come here. Come here. Come here. Oh, my God!

That's just what it look like too. Come on, let me fix your hair. -Her hair look fine. -Come on. It's a mess. -I guess my assumption was right. -Ain't wearing black no more either. They make an all right couple. But he's not my type. -Kind of cute, though. -Nice nose. There's a few things we could do with your hair. We can put some ponytails in it and huge flower ribbons. Or barrettes. Or we can put some big, big, big curls in it. Big locks. Which way would you like it? -Curls. -You like the curls? The curls, okay. -Do you go to school, Keisha? -Yeah. -You do? You like school? -Yeah. -What's your teacher's name? -Mrs. Frazier. Mrs. Frazier?
