 

                        Please don't execute me. It is such a waste of my lovely woman's body. I've got years of shagging in me. Why chop off my head when thou could... lift up my dress and look at my front bottom? Phwoar! I'm not gonna kill you! CHEERING Sir... I owe thou a shag. Oh... - ALL: - Large! HE GULPS Kevin? - Kevin! - Wuuurrrgh! - How's your homework going? - Fine, until you came in. Oh! Bring this mess down when you come. I'm not your slave! Don't talk to your mother like that. MIMICS: Don't talk to your mother like that! HE SNORTS Oh... So unfair... "Dear diary. Sorry I've never written in you. "I have higher things on my mind." "If I did write down my thoughts, you would be a bestseller. "I am a teenage genius, unrecognised by the world. "The only person who understands me is my best mate Perry." All right, Kev. "He is joyful in his understanding of my wisdom." Your jacket's inside out. I do know. I don't conform to conventional dress patterns. "Until Perry met me, he was but a humble peasant, "but now he is top." Respect. "We are only free to express our philosophy through our mixes." # All I wanna do is do it # Big girl, big girl # All I wanna do is do it # Big girl, big girl # All I wanna do is do it # Big girl, big girl # Big girl, big girl, big girl... # Kevin! Turn it down! MUSIC GETS LOUDER "When we are top DJs, my senile parents will surely eat their pants." - You're a genius, darling! - You certainly proved us wrong. I sure did. Huh! Thanks. Will you shag me? OK. - GIRLS: - Shag me! "For, dear diary, there is pain behind my genius. "My teenage heart is broken. "I've been up for it for three bloody years, "but no girl has yet let me go the whole way." HE HOWLS HOWLING HOWLING HOWLING CONTINUES - You got it? - Yeah. - I get the goods, you give him that. - Go, go, go. Go, go, go. This, please. Wurrrgh! 3.99, please. Thank you! KEVIN GASPS You were scared of the pigs. - I ain't. - They're scared of me. - I rule this manor. I'm hard. - There's your dad. KEVIN YELPS No! Are you all right, Kevin? Oh... Hi, Dad. Yeah, fine, thanks. Why are you lying there? I'm a bit tired. I need a sleep. We're knackered, Mr Porno-P-Patterson. Yawn. "Debbie from London loves clubbing. "I go to Ibiza every year for the clubs and the carefree sex. "It's fantastic. Everyone gets off with everyone else. It is so horny." - I love her, Kev. - That's it! What? We are DJs. Where do DJs go for the summer? Ibiza. And all girls who go to Ibiza shag anyone, especially DJs. So where are we going to go? Ibiza? What, you think you deserve to go to Ibiza after this? HE MUMBLES It's worse than we expected. "Kevin lacks application. - "Is still a virgin..." - What? "Is still emerging from a rebellious phase that shows no sign of ending." - Huh! - It's just awful, isn't it? What have you got to say for yourself? So can we go to Ibiza? I think I've answered that! No! Oh! That is so unfair! Mum... - Perhaps if... - I said no! Ugh! - What your father says goes. - Ugh! Ugh! I can't take any more! I'm adopted! My real parents couldn't possibly treat me like this! I hate you! 'Scuse me... I'm running away! Goodbye for ever! - You leave no room to compromise. - DOOR SLAMS - Compromise with that? - He has nothing to look forward to! - He deserves it. - He'll be impossible all holiday! 'Scuse me, Mr and Mrs Patterson. Erm... Could I have a jam sandwich? WHIMPERING CHURCH ORGAN PLAYS Kevin left us a note, to remember him by. It is typical of the Kevin we all knew, loved, and in many cases, shagged. "I'm killing myself because I'm too good for this world. "A prophet is never understood in his own land, innit? "Soft friends, don't be sad. "I've gone to a better place, where you never have to tidy your room, "a place where your parents buy you new Nike trainers every week." "I didn't mean to cause you any pain, Mum... "but you shouldn't have made me wash." - SOBBING: - Kevin! Kevin! Yeah. I'm dead now. Yeah. Oh, Kevin! Kevin, tea's ready! HE SIGHS HE FARTS How nice you've come back. We thought you'd gone for ever. Eeeuurrrgghhh! We've decided... that you can both go to Ibiza. BOTH: Come on! Provided you get a job to pay for it. What are you talking about? YOU pay for my holidays. That's what parents are for! - Our lives are about more than that. - Don't be so ridiculous. Pass the salt, please, Kevin. I am not your slave! This is what happens when you compromise! Do you know what the trouble with you two is? You're so alike! BOTH: What?! That is so unfair! - You want ME to give YOU a job? - Yeah.

I stuck it up her good. That mean you don't want to go to Ibiza? Now you don't need to go to Ibiza for a guaranteed shag. I'll get a shag here, probably. No, we can still go to Ibiza. I can always do more shagging. Oh. Thanks, Kev. You're a mate. But how are we going to get the money? It's all in the mind. We're DJs. We can earn our money on the street. # All I wanna do is do it # Big girl, big girl # All I wanna do is do it # Big girl, big girl # All I wanna do is do it # Big girl, big girl, big girl - # Big girl, big girl, big girl... - Oi!
