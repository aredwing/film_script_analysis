 

                        - I heard a sound. A wind. A strong wind. And then a whisper in that wind. Remnants. Fragments. Shattered pieces of an illusive memory steeped in pixilated streaks and auto-tracked frames. A laugh, a kiss. Where am I? In your arms? Your lap? On your shoulders? Tap, tap, tapping like the rap, rap, rapping of the raven. That wind would become rain. That rain would become snow and that snow would become ice. That ice will melt back to the sky. We are born of muscle, of meat and of blood. Not from loving arms, nor brutality or harm. As family is, as family does. Brother, sister, mother, father. We are lodged and trapped in every pore. But that is our skin, nothing more. We are at one with the floorboards, the tin roof and the sky. We are left with two questions. - Hey, Jacks. Hello? - Hey. - Writing poetry on our precious company time again? - Artists write poetry. Assholes just complain. - True. How long till the big day again? - Three more months and I'll be a daddy. - It's Andy, right? - Unless he got a sex change in the womb, yes, that's the plan. - That's so awesome, bro. - Thanks. Don't call me bro. We're not 17. It makes you seem old. Depressing. - Look, asshole, I was just gonna get a cup of coffee. Do you want something or not? - No, I'm good. Thanks, man. - I see. Man's okay, not bro. - You are a man, right? Thus I can call you as such. However, you are not my brother. Does that make sense? You see the difference? - Dude, you're such a dick. See ya later. - Jack Thurlow. - Jack Thurlow? - Yep. Just said it. - Derrick Thompson with Hudson valley sheriff's department. I'm sorry to tell you, but there's been an accident. - Wh-wh-what kind of accident? - Your parents... Damien and Theresa Thurlow... They... they lost control of their car last night. - Are they alright? - I'm so sorry. - Hi, babe. - Hiya, beautiful. - How's our tree house? - Ah, it's alright. Same ol', same ol'. How's, um... How's your grandmother? - Hmm... Hold on. Sorry. I just didn't want my mom or uncle to hear this. Baby, she's fucking dying. And no one will admit it. It's like they're too English or something. I'm just... tired. - Well... why are you still up? - Um... I don't know. Couldn't sleep. I... My uncle's house is really creepy. The wind... Just rattles and rattles. Taps and taps. But, hey, the good news! Our little one's doing well. - Let me see. - Hey, what's that jacket you're wearing? - Hmm? Oh, it's, uh... It's my dad's. He died today. - What? - Yeah, uh... he and my mom were at the cabin and apparently when they were driving back to the city, they lost control of the car and flew off the highway. My mom made it. Minor injuries. She's home now, but, um... Yeah, my dad's... My dad's dead. They didn't wanna give details, but I got them anyway. So I guess the... The windshield severed his head clean off his body, or at least nearly clean off. I guess there was still some... Ligaments attached to the back of his neck. And then the wheel broke all of his ribs and caused massive internal bleeding, which would've killed him anyway, regardless of his head getting chopped off. Fuck, man. - Baby... Love of my life... I-I don't know what to say. I don't know... what to do. - Do? Say? There's nothing to do or say. Um... we live, we drive, we crash, we die. Had to happen sometime. - Jack... you're scaring me. - What do you mean? I'm fine. Like, I'm already at peace with it. It's weird. It's crazy, right? - Your dad was your best friend. God, I'm so sorry. - Shhh. Stop it. It's fine. I'm... I'm fine. Really. I mean it. - Hey, it's Shanda. Leave a message. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. - Hey. It's me. Um, I don't know if you got the voicemail I left you earlier about the accident and my parents. Uh... yeah, I... I just wanted to touch base. I'll probably get in around 1:00 tomorrow, just cab it from the airport. Uh, anyway, I'm fine. Excited to see you, shithead. - Yeah, I had... I had to come out here. He's my best friend. I changed my flight to his. I think he's asleep. Yeah, yeah, I'll see you... then. Yeah, love you, too. Okay, bye. Ahem. - Ah... - Jack? Jack, I think you're sleepwalking again. - Ah... - I don't wanna wake you or upset you, but you need to go back to bed, okay? You have to wake up early tomorrow... For the airport. Jack, what... What are you saying? What are you saying, Jack? - Anne frank. - What? - Up there. I... want... you... - Up where? - I'll go up there, too. Attic. A... - What's in the attic... Jack? - Oh. Uh... I'm in the attic. Oh. Oh!!! Fuuu...!! I'm in the attic!! - It's okay. I'm in the attic!! I'm in the attic! Hey, hey, hey! Hi. - Hey. - I don't remember falling asleep last night. - Hmm. Fuck. What time is it? - Seven-ish. You sleepwalked last night. - Did I? Fuck. I haven't done that in years. - Yeah, well... you went crazy. You beat the shit outta me. - Jesus Christ. I'm so sorry. - Hey, better me than your baby momma, right? Fuck it. So, uh, what's in the attic? - The attic? - Yeah, you, uh, kept screaming on and on about... the attic. - I have no idea. - Look, just so you know... I'd do anything for you, you stupid bitch. - I'd do anything for you, you lazy whore. - We better start packing. You're going home. - Mom?! Mom? Mom? Mom? - Oh... Oh, Jack. My god. You're here. - 'Course I am. Give me this. - Be very careful. Careful, careful, careful. - How's your pain level? - Oh. It's... it's good. Not bad at all, really. - Where's rusty? - Oh, my god. He's still at the vet. We didn't take him to the cabin. - Why not? - The owls. They drive him crazy. You can get him tomorrow afternoon, if you want. Well, for godssake, give your mother a hug. Oh... - I'm so sorry, mom. I'm so sorry. - For what? - For... the accident, that I wasn't here sooner. - Well, that makes no sense. You're sorry? You had nothing to do with it. - I wasn't saying I'm sorry like it was the conclusion of an argument. I was just being nice. - Well, you don't need to be nice. None of this is nice. You need to be here and you are, so I thank you. I thank you for that. Because your daddy would appreciate it too. One hour, honey. - Awesome. So are you gonna play? - Play? Wh-what do you mean? - Violin. At... at the funeral. - Oh. Um... Whoo... I don't know what I would play. - I dunno... Dad always liked that Chopin piece that you transposed. - No, no, no, no. That piece is for keys, not strings. But if it's really important to you, I-I'll... I'll see what I can do. - Look, I swear to god, nobody on this planet makes better fucking lasagna than you. - Hey now. Is that any way to talk at the dining-room table? - Please. My table etiquette was intrinsically bound from within at far too young an age. - There it is. - There what is? - Your father. He had a mouth that could run a marathon. He could spout a thousand words in 25 nanoseconds. It was in him and now it is in you. - Jesus Christ. How are you... - How am I what? - How are you you right now? So okay? - What am I supposed to be doing? Am I supposed to be crying? - Yes. Yes. - You're not. - I never cry. But you cry every five fucking minutes, so what the fuck? You were in an accident. A fatal and painful accident. Dad got his head chopped off right next to you. You devoted your life to a man who is now dead. You lived with him. You spoke with him. You fought with him. You invited him to your bedroom and let him come inside you to create a child. This child. This pretentious little fuck. I-I'm... I'm yours... and his, and I wanna share this pain with you. - Are you finished? - I don't know. Am I? - I'm proud of you. I am. You know, right out of the gate, you had your say with me. Bravissimo. Now it's my turn. I always loved your biting wit, your acerbic observations, and - oh, my god - your immense vocabulary... when it came to whining... About something simple in such an unnecessarily complicated way, but as your mother, I'm gonna tell you right now... To shut the fuck up. You wanna sit across from me at the same table where I spoon-fed you and dictate how I should experience my grief?! You lost your father at an unfairly young age, and that is a hurricane of hurt and confusion, and I respect that, but you make no mistake, I lost my husband. I'm gonna tell you something. I don't care if you are my son, or if you were my neighbor or you were my enemy, I will be goddamned if anyone is gonna tell me how I should shed tears in the name of my fucking husband! Ah! Ah! Ah! Sometimes... I regret ever spreading my legs. Just hold on, buddy. You are not ready for sleep, are you? - No! - Okay. Alright. Stop, stop. One sock. Two sock. There we go. - What is that, daddy? - It's a tape recorder, my boy. It's, uh, a device that makes things last forever. With this, you can hear me no matter where you are or where I am. - That's weird. - You were so good in the car ride over here. Mommy's not gonna leave you alone. She's gonna go right in with you and make sure nothing happens to her little love bug. No. My sweet baby. You're so good. - Ah, here he is! - You're so gonna get lots of treats. - Oh, yeah. Oh, man. Oh, fuck, I missed you, buddy. I don't know why they put him up here for a whole fucking month. My mom never liked him anyway. - Is that gonna be cash or credit? - Uh, credit, please. - Okay. If you wouldn't mind just signing a few things here. I am so sorry. - Oh. Thank you. - No, I really mean it. - I appreciate it. - Your father really loved you. He would waltz in here every week for rusty's diabetes shot and he would hold rusty high over his head and he would talk about his two sons, yeah. You and rusty. He even made all of us... We all got a subscription to look alive magazine just 'cause he said you wrote for it. He was a good man. - Um... that's it. Thank you very much... Nancy. - Oh. Don't forget your card. - Oh, thank you. - May god be with you, Jack. - Can I ask you something, Nancy? - You just did. - Um, how many hours a day do you work here? - Twelve. - And... how many animals do you see die by euthanasia or... or... or physical failure each day? : About 11 or 12. - That's about one per hour. So assuming that these pets have families, other than the lonely old cat lady, you must see double, triple, quadruple that in... In crying faces, right? Devastated faces. Tragic faces. And yet, somehow... you believe that god cares about us. - Oh, I'm so sorry. I did not mean... - shhh. Nancy. Nancy. Nancy, I'm not... I'm not challenging you. I'm admiring you. I'm... reminding myself that there's still goodness in the world. Still good people in the world. Good people like you, Nancy. Doh! Thank you, Nancy. Mom? Mom, you awake? - I need to sleep! - Okay. Just letting you know that I... I got rusty. - Oh, god. Don't let him scratch the door. I just hate when he does that. - Will do. Uh, Shanda's coming over a bit later with food. Do you want anything? - No. I need to sleep. - Okay. - Did you talk to that whore nurse, Nancy? - At the vets? Yeah, she sent her condolences. - Huh. I bet she fucking did. - What does that mean? - Swear I'm gonna kill that bitch. - What bitch? - What bitch? Crystal! That fucking bitch. - You mean crystal, the love of your life? - If she's the love of my life, fucking shoot me right fucking now. - Give it an hour, you'll be in love all over again. - Pfft! Shut up and eat your burrito. The house is so quiet. - Yeah, it is. Just like mom always wanted. Guess she finally got her wish. - Can I tell you something that... You probably shouldn't hear right now? - Please do. Your specialty is providing unwanted information. - I always thought this house was haunted. - Really? Why? - I don't know. Ever since we were kids, it just felt like there was some dark vagina just hovering over this place, waiting to swallow me up. - Maybe it was just your latent homosexuality talking, hmm? - Shut up. I'm being serious. I've always been scared here, dude. Why do you think we'd fall asleep in the TV room and then you'd wake up in the morning and find me passed out in the yard? Just felt safer outside. - You'd go outside 'cause you walked in your sleep. - Hey, so did you. God, we're so weird. - Found something in the attic last night. - What? - It was a tape recorder with a full tape. It was labeled "for Jack." - Well, did you listen to it? - What are you looking at? - We're best friends. - Yeah. - No secrets. - No secrets. - To be honest, it wasn't... Your house that's always scared me. It's your mom. She always scared the living shit out of me. I'm sorry, but i... - no, no, no, no sorries. - Every time... I'd leave here to go back to my house... I would just be thinking: good luck. - Hey! Peepin' tom. - Hey. - What ya doing? - Smokin'. - You got a name? - Jack. - Duncan. How come I ain't seen ya before? - I live in L.A. I'm just here for some family shit. - Ah. I see. I see. Hey, do ya wanna do some blow? - 'Scuse me? - Said, "do you wanna do some blow?" Do you want some or not? If you don't snort it, I will. - Symmetry. See I... oh! - So what do you say you're doing back here when you're all hot shit parading around Hollywood? Hmm? - 'Cause there was an accident. My dad got his head chopped off. - Ah, so you're all full of shit. - Nah. No, truth, man. He's dead. Dead and gone. As of... 48, 72 hours ago. I dunno. - You serious? - Yeah. Funeral's coming up. Fuck. Helluva lot a work, a funeral. You're literally planning... The party... of a lifetime. Poof. - Well... Shit. Pfft. I know I'm supposed to say... I'm sorry, but, um, but I guess you're pretty sick and tired of hearing that by now. So... instead, I'll just say... "fuck, man." - "Fuck man" is good. - Did you love him? - My dad? - Yeah. - More than anything. - Mine was a piece of shit. He hated me. No, he hated himself. Tried to hide a lot of secrets. And those he couldn't hide, my mom covered up for him. A runt and a cunt. A liar and a lioness. Rawr. - You're a child. Who the fuck are you to pontificate? - Oh, man, I'm... I'm pontificating? - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Probably don't even know the meaning of the word. - Wait. I'm sorry. What the fuck is your problem? - Look, Doug, Duncan, whatever the fuck your name is, you jerk off in your window at me. You seduce me with drugs. You think you've had a rough life at 19, but I promise you, you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. - Hmm. Fuck you. You're a fucking asshole! And, more importantly, you're out of your goddamn mind. : Okay. Get yourself all tucked in. There ya go. I'm gonna tell you a story and we'll record it. That way, it's here whenever you need to fall asleep, okay? Hmm. Once upon a time, there was a little boy, and he went to the woods with his mother. They planned to pick berries and flowers of color, but instead the boy picked up his brother. His brother was shy and so very mean, and angered himself at all that was seen. The angry, old brother, he needed a friend. "Come with me," said mother, and she danced to the end. The boy, he cried out, "oh, mother, no, no!" The mean, old brother cried: "Let it be so!" To their surprise, mother flew to the sky, darting past sadness and what makes us cry. "Now, my dear boys, you see nothing is wrong," their mother sang loudly amidst flight and song. You are with me, the sky and the sea, you who I love and you who love me." The boy sat down at the edge of the cliff, tears in his eyes and wondering if. But soon he would smile, because all the while, it was simply a dream and no evil scheme. Mother alight lifts babe in her arms, holding him tight with all of her charms. She sings a sweet hum, a dear lovely song, "till tomorrow, my darling, here's where you belong." Jack? You asleep, Jack? Okay, good. Here we go. When you're all grown up... When you're a big boy, a young man, when you're ready... You're gonna find this tape. In the attic. When you're ready, Jack, you go up to the attic. - What? What the fuck?! C'mon! - What are you doing? - You locked the attic. Wh-wh-why did you lock it? - What are you talking about? - This attic was unlocked a night ago. Now it's not. Open the fucking door! - Alright. You wanna do this? Let's do it! I didn't lock the fucking attic, but I have a feeling that you wouldn't like what you found up there, sweet little boy of mine. Not yesterday, not today, and not tomorrow. So, why don't you just curl up and cry yourself to sleep like a good little boy? I'm gonna sit here... Until I can trust that you've gone to sleep. Good boy. - This is why, mom. This is why I need to go up there. - In the attic. When you're ready, Jack, you go up to the attic. And, someday, you'll know the truth. But just remember... I love you more than anything. - What is he talking about? - Rewind. Fast-forward. Stop. - And, someday, you'll know the truth. But just remember... I love you more than anything. - Rewind. Play it again. - Why? - Just play it again. Play that piece again right now. Play it again. - Just remember... I love you more than anything. - Rewind it and play it again. Play it again! - I love you more than anything. - That's all that matters. That he loved you. - I love you more than anything. I love you more than anything. I love you more than anything. - He loved you. Shhh. Shhh... - First, I just wanna thank you all so much for coming. It means a lot to both my mother and my father. I believe most of you have known me since I was... This big. So you also know I'm terrible at public speaking and I did not prepare a speech of any kind for today. But here's what I will say. My family - the unholy Trinity, if you will - could always agree that a funeral should never be a funeral... But a celebration. That's what today is. It's a celebration of life... Well lived. A life of kindness. My mother and I truly hope you believe that. I... I can still feel my father standing behind me, his supportive hand on my back, telling me I can do anything. And I look in front of me, and thank god I have my mother to tell me the same. Still standing... Right here with me. Now, as my father would've said, let's celebrate life... Not death. Celebrate perseverance... Not failure. The future, not the past. The joy, not the pain. Here's to you, dad. And now my mother. Um... My mother... Uh... That was beautiful, asshole. - Well... thanks for coming. - Yeah... real tough choice. It was either this or happy hour at the cracker barrel. - Just give me a minute, okay? What the hell is the matter with you? You have any idea how awkward that was for me? You were supposed to close the whole thing. - Just take me home. - Look, I get that you're hurting, but you can't put everything on me. I'm fucking hurting too. - Please... Just take me home. Please? Thank you, Shanda. I'm gonna go lie down. Jack. - I have something I wanna tell you, and I really want you to hear it. You've been so strong through all of this, and I know it's hell, because I've been there. Losing my mom was probably... The hardest thing I've ever had to deal with, even though she was a complete psycho bitch. But... I just want you to know that no matter what... I am here. I am your friend. And... What I mean by that... is, I am here with a huge bag of weed in my pocket. And, as your friend, I demand that we get very fucking stoned. - Thanks. Is that dress yours? - No. Crystal's. She, uh, bought it for her niece's baptism. - That's ironic. Bought for a birth, worn for a death. - Celebration. Remember? - Ah... celebration. - Your words, not mine. - No. No, my mom's words. She's always been hell-bent that funerals aren't sad. Hatred is just love. Hitler was just misunderstood. Dahmer's just a very hungry guy. - Ugh. Yeah, Jack the ripper was just defending himself. - Pearl harbor's just a... Fuck. I didn't think that one through. - Your dad would've been real proud of you today. - You think? - I know. Hey, you remember when we were, like... 10, 11, and I slept over and, uh... We snuck out and stole your dad's... No, your mom's whiskey and cigarettes. - It was rum. It was definitely rum. - And your mom and dad had that huge blowout fight. In that window right over there. - That wasn't a fight as much as her throwing him around. - And she threw him up against the glass out of nowhere. Scared the shit out of us. We were laughing so hard. We were hiding in the bushes. Fuck. Why was that so funny at the time? - I don't know. Maybe 'cause we... like, really understood it, ya know? - What do you mean? - Like, like... When you're a kid, everything that was so important is just so, so trivial now, and vice versa. - Mm-hmm. - Like two people that happen to be my parents were just... Fighting each other, just throwing each other around. That's... that's a funny thing to watch when you're a kid. Then you get older, and you realize that that shit is in you. That your parents... are you. And all that bitterness... I'm... really stoned. - Tell me something. You feel like dancing? - You know what? I think I do. - Hey, man. Fancy meeting you here. - Great, it's you. - Sven. How ya doin', daddy? Uh... This is my best friend... Jack. - Best friend, huh? I thought his friend was that dike over there. Strange. Haven't seen you here before. - Well, I've been coming here my whole life and I haven't seen you either. I guess that makes us equally strange. - Let me see your hands. - No. - Well, Sven, he... reads palms. Like a witch. - Cool. - Now, this is very interesting. See, your heart line... Goes all the way up to here. But your head line... Stops here. - What does that mean? - That means you're already dead. - I'm sorry about that. - It's fine. - No... it's not. People like Sven think they have the right to use and abuse and manipulate even if they don't know how or why they have that right. - May not know the meaning of the word, but tonight you pontificate very well. - Hey. I liked what you said today. At the celebration. - You were there? - Sorry. Tried to stay as hidden as I could. - How did you know about it? - Your mom told me. Her and I speak all the time since I moved in. - How long ago did you move in? - A while ago. - You know my father? - Uh, we... met each other a few times, in passing. To be honest, I don't think he liked me very much. He'd only say a few words to me every time we saw each other. But I'm not trying to say that he was an ass or anything, or that I'm any less sorry... - here we go with the sorries. - Hey. Come on. Hey. Look, two for two, okay? You were an asshole before and I was an asshole now. I don't know you, but for some reason, I care about you, so can you sit down and we can talk a little bit? - Fuck off, queer. - Jack. Jack! - Sorry. Sorry. Stop it. Come on, asshole. Shhh... Rusty. Mom hates that. Rusty, come on. Rusty? C'mere. C'mere. Shhh... c'mere. What the fuck is wrong with you?! You hurt him! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No! Stop, stop, stop! Stop! Stop, stop! Please stop, stop, stop, stop! No, no, no, no, no!!! Jesus. - Whew! - You scared me. - Oh, you scared me. Ha... what are you doing up? - I wanted a glass of water. What are you doing up? - I was hungry. Sweet dreams, good boy. - 'Night, mom. - There he is. There's my boy. My good little guy. Jack out of the box! See? You're smiling now. It's not so bad to smile, is it? Huh? Once in awhile? Here's baby Jack, and here's baby Andy! Ah, my two little monsters. My good little monsters, huh? Oh, man, you are gonna fight and scream and give mommy and daddy such a headache, but we're gonna love you. Yes, we are. We're gonna love you forever. - I don't wanna! - Jack? What's wrong? Come on, now. Come on, Jack. Please! Stop crying! Oh... oh... Oh! Oh!! Oh!! Oh...! - What the fuck? Fuck. What the fuck? Um, what... Would you be? What would you be? Um... Dad's social security. Social security. 8-2-7-2. Um... Dad's birthday? Dad's birthday... Um... okay. My birthday. 19... Ah... come on, Jack. Come on, Jack. Jack. Jack. Jack. J... A... 2. C... 2. K... : Jack? Jack, are you okay up there? Jack, I just want to know you're okay. - And you don't... Remember any of this? Your mom and dad never said anything? - No. Your mom never said anything to you? - No. No, of course not. I... you... I would've said something. - There's something else. - What? - With the briefcase. There was... There's a videotape and, uh... - Tell me. - It was my mom... my dad... Me as a baby... and my twin brother. - But you don't... Have a brother. - I did on the tape. Andy. - Isn't that what you were... Gonna name your kid? - Not anymore. - Jack. Jack, my boy, I hope you can hear me. You need to know I never wanted this hurt for you. I... don't know when you'll hear this. Maybe never. But if you are hearing it... it probably means I'm already gone. You'll be a man soon. And a man needs to know the truth. And the truth is... I'm sorry. Endlessly sorry. I've failed you. I've failed to protect you. My own baby boy. My own flesh and blood. The devil is in you now. - It's not real. It isn't real. It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. - You having a bad dream, baby? - What are you doing here? - I thought we could have a little cuddle. Like we used to. With Andy. What are you doing?! Oh! Ow! What are you doing?! You open the door, you fucking sonofabitch!! You filthy sonofabitch!! - Go away! Go away! Ah!!! Jack is not at his phone, so please leave a message after the tone. - Shit. - Jack is not at his... - Hey, um... It's me. I was just, uh... I don't know, whatever, just... Just call me back, okay? - Hey. You're shaking. What's wrong? - Nothing. I just... - You worry too much about him. Jack will be fine. - Look, I know he's a hard-ass and he's been a dick to you, but trust me, he breaks. When I came out, he was there, when... When my mom died, he was there. He's always there. Now, I have to be... - shhh. Well... go. - Something really bad... Is happening. - So when's your boyfriend get back? - Six days. - Nice. - Hey, you okay? You don't seem okay. - I'm fine. What? - Definition of not being fine when someone says, "I'm fine." - Said I'm fine and I meant it. - Oh, yeah? What about all that screaming I heard last night, huh? You know I'm your neighbor. It's kinda hard to bullshit me. Okay, just stop. Let the dog go for a second and just talk to me. - You don't... know me. - Is that a question or a statement? - Neither. Pretending that I'm talking to myself, 'cause that's the only way I can accept the words I want to say out loud. - Okay. I'm Jack. Now, say whatever Jack wants to say to Jack. I'm... Jack. Tell me what you think of Jack. - I hate you, Jack. I hate your family, Jack. Your lying mother. Your bastard father. It's pathetic. The only thing that could open your eyes was the death of everything you trusted and believed in. Your whole world. A world that would be better off without you in it. I have to go. Where's my...? Rusty?! - Hey, whatever's going on, you mustn't say things like that. - Where the hell have you been? Jack? It's 1:00 in the fucking morning. - What do you care? - What do I care? I care about the broken windows. What the hell did you do? What did you do? Jack, I'm talking to you! What did you do about... - what did I do? What did you do? What did you do? You... you don't remember? You don't remember slapping dad around? You don't remember pushing him around? Hmm? How does that feel? Does that feel good? Does that feel good to you? 'Cause that doesn't feel good to me. Because I'm a good person. I'm a good person, you fucking idiot. Getting into bed with me - what the fuck is wrong with you? Jesus. - What are you talking about? - I have to go call my fiance and check on my baby. That's right, mom. I'm having a child. Can't wait to fuck him up like you fucked me up. - Oh, my... - Hi. - Hello. Hi. - You okay? You seem upset. - Uh, I'm... I'm... I'm fine. I'm fucking great, actually. - So how is everything? - You told me to call you as soon as possible. Now you're gonna ask me about the fucking weather. - I'm sorry. Is this actually Jack Thurlow? Because the Jack Thurlow I know would never speak to me that way. - I'm sorry. Really, I am. You look upset. What's wrong? Did she die? - Who? - Your grandmother. Is our baby dead? Our baby's dead. - I went to the doctor's appointment, just a routine checkup, and everything was normal, and they don't know what happened! They don't know anything! Just... something went wrong and... oh!! I'm so sorry, Jack. I'm so sorry. It just hurts so bad and I need you! I need you! I'm so sorry. - Our baby's dead. Sit down. Tell me what this means. - Did you read all of it? The whole report? - Yes. - Then you already know. There's nothing more I can add, even if you hold a knife to my throat. - Don't... - Go for it. - Tell me! Tell me who this is. Is it...? That's... that's me. - Your father and I were always at the university, teaching. Not less than four nights a week. Our neighbor had a 19-year-old son. He needed money, so he became your babysitter. After a... a few months, we noticed that you were vomiting almost every morning after he had looked after you. He finally admitted to us that he and his father... had been touching you. So we went to the police. There was a... a trial, and they were punished. It's as simple as that. - How did I tell you? - One morning, you threw up, and daddy asked you what was wrong and you s... You said he had put his peepee in your mouth. That was all we needed to hear. And the therapist said that after two years, it was a miracle that you had forgotten everything, so we decided that that was best. - What about Andy? - Andy. Andy's not in here. How did you find out about him? - Doesn't matter. Answer the question. - Andy is your brother... And he was born with you. He was your twin. And he got an infection and he died. - Bullshit. Tell me! - Okay. You cried... so much. You cried and you cried and you cried and you cried and you cried... and... Andy... was so full of smiles. He was so happy and... - get... get to the point. - No. There is no point. I'm gonna go lie down. Oh! - Don't make me kill my mother. - That night, your father must have had some kind of breakdown. He went from some kind a high to a low. He couldn't take your screaming anymore. Neither of us could. I... woke up and I heard the water running in the bathtub and that is all I know. Alright. I saw the lights out in your room. I stumbled to the tub and I saw your father holding my baby under the tap. And I said to him: "Why?" And he smiled... And he said, "Jack won't cry anymore. Now we can sleep." But I knew it was Andy in that water. It was not you. And he knew it too, because 10 seconds later, you started to cry again. It was supposed to be you, Jack! It was supposed to be you! It was not supposed to be Andy! It was supposed to be you!! It was your father. And I have a question for you. Why, after all the things I sheltered you from, have I become the devil and he's god? - Hey! You okay? - No. She's lying. She's lying! She wants to make me insane. I'm not. She wants to make me insane. I'm not insane! He would never do that sh... He would never do that. Never. She's just... she's just... Fucking bitch. What the...? No. No. : Help. Help! Help! Help! - I will, Jack. I will. I'll help you, Jack. Just... Be a good boy. That's it. Just breathe. Be a good boy. Hi. - She's back. - No. - Jack? Jack, I'm coming in. Jack? Jack! Fuck! - Sh... She killed him. - Here, let me just, um... Jack, co... - what? Mine! Mine. Don't fucking touch him. - Ahem... Look, I'm just trying... - what? What? Trying to what? Trying to what? Trying to what?!! Are... you trying to help? Are you helping? Are-are-wh-wh... I'm sorry? Is that what you're gonna say? I'm sorry? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Who... Are you? - I'm your best friend, Jack. - You're my best friend! - I'm your best friend!!! - My best friend! Are you gonna f-f-fix anything? You gon... You gonna make me laugh? G-get me stoned? You gonna tell me... Fucking jokes? I don't need help. I'm... Fixing things. I don't need you. I don't need you. Go away! Go away! Get out! Get out!!! Get out! Get the fuck out! Get out! Ah!!! - Once upon a time, there was a little boy, and he went to the woods with his mother. They planned to pick berries and flowers of color, but instead the boy picked up his brother. His brother was shy and so very mean and angered himself at all that was seen. The angry, old brother, he needed a friend. "Come with me... - Hey. You know what you have to do. Hmm? - Mom... I made you a drink. - Thank you, darling. - You wanna hear some music? Will you dance with me? Yes? - Hello. You must be Jack. - Yes, I... I must be. - I'm Linda Fletcher. I live four houses down that way and I just... - what do... what do you want? - Well, I-i just wanted to say I'm so sorry about the accident and that I couldn't be here for the funeral. I had planned to be, but my daughter just had her first child in Phoenix, so I just got back... - congratulations to her. And to you, being a grandmother. Wish you luck and lots of it. Are those flowers for us? Is that why you're here? - Yes. I just wanted to send my sympathies. I can't imagine what you must be going through. - Sunflowers. That's my mom's favorite. - Yes, I know. - I'll be sure she gets them. Is there anything else? - Um... no. Just, um... let me know if there's anything I can do to help. - Will do. Thank you and good night, Linda. Shhh... Don't worry. Be there soon. Ah!!! We're here. You see that, mom? See... the tire tracks at the edge of the cement there? Even through the rain, there they'll be. Even through the snow, there they'll stay. That wind will become rain. That rain will become snow. That snow will become ice and that ice will melt back to the sky. You belong here. So do I. - Yes... just take us home... Jack. - We are home. - Ah! Ow! Ugh! Ah! Ow! Jack! Please! Ah! No! No! No! Stop! Help!!! No!!! No!!! Oh, my god! Why are you smiling? Don't smile! - Wh-what-what are you doing? - What are you doing, Jack? - He had to go. So... so did she. So do I. - You're right. He did have to go. And so did she. Open your eyes, Jack. Where is she? The accident? They both died. First I didn't realize why you just kept talking about your dad. But then I realized. You couldn't let them both go at once. Please put the knife... Put the knife down. Hey. We're here. - I'm sorry. - For what? - Everything. - You can say it. You can hear it. I'm sorry. What? What is that? - Mom. Can you hear? I have to go inside now. I don't want to keep her waiting. - Jack! - Sweet dreams, good boy.
