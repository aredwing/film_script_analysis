All the pure souls that come here to worship at Notre-Dame. Tonight, we'll wait for her as she goes by... ...and we'll take her away.

A dog obeys... ...his master's call... ...whatever you say... ...I will do it all. A dog obeys his master's call... ...whatever you say... ...I will do it all. The doors of Paris close... ...and in the streets, the darkness grows. The night takes of her clothes... ...and laughs and cries and wakes all our desires. At night, the dark dreams ride on Paris heights... ...till dreams are satisfied. Till we have found all we require. On the bridge of dreams... A girl I saw, an angel seemed. The angel smiled... ...and then she disappeared, as I grew near. Through Paris streets I ran... ...the angel flew right through my hands. I thought of Paris night... ...I laughed and cried...

That girl is my wife... ...she was given to me... ...by the king of a tribe. Did you touch the girl... ...you creature of sin? She never let me near. Don't touch her you hear. Father, do you recall... ...this word carved... ...on a stone beyond... ...The Gallery of Kings? Do you know what this word means, this word anarchy? Why do you bother me? The Greek anarchy means destiny. Is that Quasimodo... ...those men have led away? My poor hunchback has fallen low... ...let's hear what these men say. Hunchback cripple, you are to blame. Ringer of bells you bear the shame. Pray for his soul this child of sin. God in your mercy, take him in. Someone take pity on Quasimodo... ...the weight of the world... ...brings him low. Does no one listen there, is there any water here? Oh, I need it so, I pray you, I pray. Water, please, I pray... ...for Quasimodo. I'm thirsty! Give me a drop to drink! I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty! Give me something to drink! Belle... Belle... Belle... ...is the only word I know that suits her well. When she dances, oh, the stories she can tell. A free bird trying out her wings to fly away. And when I see her move, I see hell to pay. She dances naked in my soul and sleep won't come. And it's no use to pray these prayers to Notre-Dame. Tell... ...who'd be the first to raise his hand and throw a stone. I'd hang him high and laugh to see him die alone. Oh, Lucifer, please let me go beyond god's law. And run my fingers through her hair, Esmeralda. Belle... ...there's a demon inside her who came from hell. And she turned my eyes from god and, oh, I fell. She put this heat inside me I'm ashamed to tell. Without my god inside I'm just a burning shell. The sin of eve she has in her I know so well. For want of her I know I'd give my soul to sell. Belle... ...this gypsy girl is there a soul beneath her skin? And does she bear the cross of all our human sin? Oh, Notre-Dame, please let me go beyond gods law... Open the door of love inside, Esmeralda... Belle... Even though her eyes seem to lead us to hell. She may be more pure, more pure than words can tell. But when she dances, feelings come no man can quell. Beneath her rainbow coloured dress, there burns the well. My promised one, please let me one time be untrue. Before in front of god and man, I marry you. Who... ...would be the man who'd turn from her to save his soul. To be with her I'd let the devil take me whole. Oh, Fleur de Lys... ...I am a man who knows no law. I go to open up the rose, Esmeralda. She dances naked in my soul and sleep won't come. And it's no use to pray these prayers to Notre-Dame. Tell... ...who'd be the first to raise his hand and throw a stone. I'd hang him high and laugh to see him die alone. Oh, Lucifer, please let me go beyond God's law. And run my fingers through her hair, Esmeralda. Esmeralda. These gargoyles my friends, watch over you. They will keep you safe, from all the harm men do. If you need a place you can come to. Ask asylum of us, we'll take care of you. The Notre-Dame of Paris... ...it's my home in the sky. Here in my home so high... ...the weather's always nice. Where summers pass us by... ...we're safe from winter's ice. Where I think about why... ...we must live and must die. These gargoyles your friends, now they are my friends too. It's they who make me laugh, the days I can't get through. Sometimes they make me happy, they look just like you. Though your face frightens me no matter what I do. Here in my home so high... ...the weather's always nice. Where summers pass us by... ...we're safe from winter's ice. If you're wondering still... ...summer winter you'll come. And my home if you will... ...you can call it your home. When you need a place, you can come to.

Ave Maria. Pardon me. If in your house I come stealing. Ave Maria... ...no one ever taught me about kneeling. Ave Maria... ...please will you keep me... ...from this misery, madness and fools... ...who rule this evil world. Ave Maria... ...I'm a stranger and you're my last recourse. Ave Maria... ...please can't you hear me? Please take down all these walls between us. We all should be as one. Ave Maria... ...please watch over my life night and day. Ave Maria... ...oh, please protect me. Please guard me and my love now I pray. Ave Maria. If you can see inside of me... ...as I can see inside them... ...you will know of all these men... ...which of them really loves you. Esmeralda you'll see... ...that only my love is true. I feel a wave of passion, move through my heart with such pain. I have no time for reason, so I just let passion reign. I let go so easily, on a night as warm as sin. Midnight swimmer, midnight sea I will not come back again. Your love will kill me, your love will kill me. And you will bear my curse as long as my life will be. Your love will kill me. Your love will kill me. And I saw it would be when I looked at you... ...when you looked at me. Your love will kill me. Your love will kill me, your love will kill me. My sin and my obsession, crazy desire you bring. I know there's no salvation, I see our bodies burning. Your gypsy dreams all haunt me, I live to see your dances. Please raise your eyes and want me, please give me all the chances. Your love will kill me, your love will kill me. And you will bear my curse as long as my life will be. Your love will kill me, your love will kill me. And I saw it would be when I looked at you... ...when you looked at me. Your love will kill me. Your love will kill me. Your love will kill me. You brought the springtime to fill my heart in it's winter chill. I lost my strength and my will, and now my tears start to spill. I never knew such desire, just looking into your eyes. And now the soul in me cries, and now the night is on fire. Your love will kill me, your love will kill me. And you will bear my curse as long as my life will be. Your love will kill me. Your love will kill me. And I saw it would be when I looked at you... ...when you looked at me. Your love will kill me. Your love will kill me, your love will kill me. Your love will kill me. Your love will kill me. Your love will kill me. Your love will kill me. Who follows me? Is it my shadow drained of light is it a phantom of the night. My shadow grows. His druid's hat obscures his face, a long black cape around him falls. Say who you are... ...show who you are. Come here to me... ...so I can see! Your conscience follows you, listen to me. For else I will see you hanged before you're through. Soldier come near! Just go from here... ...there's more to fear than to your eyes it may appear. I am a soldier sir... But here... ...that does not mean... ...anything. And are you not a man of god? By god! Upon the streets of St Denis. ...there is a place for you and me. And when it gets too dark to see, look for the lights, knock on the door. This is the place you have to find. If you have loving on your mind. You will be back time after time, back to the house called Val d'amour. At Val d'amour they close the door... ...they give you what you're looking for. No pretty words no diamond rings... ...but you can buy most anything. Just pay the price and love is yours... ...behind the doors of Val d'amour. From every corner of the world, they come to take their choice of girls. The captain's and the sailor boys, they come to find their little joys. No matter what the tongue they speak, their money talks week after week. Ladies of love my heart is sore... ...I am Gringoire the troubadour. I'm sick with love you have the cure behind the doors at Val d'amour. Guitars implore come one come all... ...come take your tour of Val d'amour. At Val d'amour they play a part... ...give them your money not your heart. Beneath the sheets your love will flower... ...it'll last the night or last an hour. When sick with love I know the cure... ...I take a trip to Val d'amour. It takes all night, but be assured they get it right at Val d'amour. Mesdemoiselles excusez-moi... ...I'll wait for my Esmeralda. She read her fate here in my hand, tonight she'll make me understand. Just north of Paris on the square... ...off Popincourt you'll find us there. The lowlifes come from everywhere... ...oh, nothing's pure at Val d'amour. And gentlemen in courtly dress... ...they fall in drunk and make a mess. At Val d'amour we close the door... ...and give you what you're looking for. No pretty words no diamond rings... ...but you can buy most anything. Just pay the price and love is yours... ...behind the doors of Val d'amour. Behind the doors of Val d'amour. Behind the doors of Val d'amour. Light of delight... ...when everything's alright. The first man to hold you tight... ...and show love in all its might. May no hands other than mine... ...ever touch your love so fine. Dark angel of the street... ...hold on to me, I'll show you night is sweet. Hold on to me, let me feel how your wild wings beat. We, though we're not the same... ...burn in a single flame. I want your love, I will risk all my life for you. Take me, take me if it is my destiny. Come see, come see if it's your destiny. Phoebus. Esmeralda! Oh, destiny... ...you are the master of man. Oh, destiny... ...you write our lives in the sand. Oh, destiny, though we do all that we can. Oh, destiny... ...you say if we fall or stand. Oh, destiny... ...you hold our lives in your hand. Oh, destiny. Oh, destiny. Oh, destiny. Talk to me of Florence... ...and of the renaissance. And of Bramante tell... ...and of great Dante's hell. In Florence they have found... ...that the world is really round. And there's a new unknown... ...continent to be found. They tell me ships have sailed, upon the open sea. For new ways to the East, wherever they may be. Luther will give the world, the true New Testament. The old world falls apart, mankind learns discontent. And Gutenberg with his books... ...will change the world again. In Nuremberg on his press... ...books pour forth, day out day in. Novels, poems and songs... ...men can read of right and wrong. New ideas come along... ...who knows where we belong. The little things all come, with great things to descend. The little words are strong, they bring down monuments. The books they read in school, will kill cathedrals all. The bible kills the church, and man will make God fall. The new will kill the old. They tell me ships have sailed, upon the ocean sea. For new ways to the east, wherever they may be. Luther will give the world, the true New Testament. The old world falls apart, mankind learns discontent. The new will kill the old. The new will kill the old. The bells do not play... ...in Notre-Dame today. Quasimodo hides up above... ...Quasimodo is sick with love. The bells have lost their voice... ...for three days by his choice. Quasimodo is sad... ...Quasimodo is going mad. Quasimodo dies for love. The bells that I make ring... ...they are my loves, they love me well. I want to hear them sing... ...loud as they swing, my pretty bells. In thunder or hail... ...or in wind or in rain. Their song will never fail... ...singing through joy, singing through pain. Bells that ring when we're born, bells that ring when we die. Bells that ring every day, every night, every hour. Bells that ring when we pray... ...bells that ring when we cry. Bells that ring to wake us up when the sun lights the sky. For the feast of Rameaux, for the Quasimodo. For a bright Christmas day and for the day of all saints. For annunciation, for the resurrection. For St valentine day and for when Good Friday comes. Celebrations they sing, all processions they ring. The most beautiful day it is the feast of our lord. Days of years, days of kings. Easter day my bells ring. And on Pentecost day they sing with bright tongues of flame. Confirmation they sing, and communions they ring. Bells that toll for our death, dies Irae, dies illa. For ascension they sing, for assumption they ring. Bells that bring us hosanna and sing hallelujah. The bells I hold most dear... ...of the beauties I have here. They are my Mary's three... ...all best friends to me. When my little Mary rings... ...when children die she sets them free. And my big Mary rings... ...when sailors set forth on the sea. But when my great Mary sings... ...when lovers exchange wedding rings. Then something in me always cries... ...then something in me always dies. To see their happiness, to see their tenderness. When a woman will not give me a single caress. My bells marry and blend, and take wings on the wind. In the midst of the stars up in the vaults of the sky. All these bells that I sound, Kyrie Elieson. Hosanna, Hallelujah, Dies irae dies illa. Bells that mourn with the sad, bells that laugh with the glad... ...all these bells that have never not once rung out for me. The bells that I make ring... ...they are my loves, such joy they bring. I want to hear them sing... ...if Esmeralda does still live. To tell the world that Quasimodo loves Esmeralda. Gringoire where has your lady gone? I never see her dance at Notre-Dame. I don't really know where she has gone... ...priests and poets are not one. In women I see love... ...the church puts them below and my poems above. Where is she, your Esmeralda? The small Paris streets... ...can't sing without her song. She's alone in a tower of stone... ...far from those who fear... ...all her powers unknown. Poet what do you say, is it this or that way? Do not use your words to play... ...have you seen her today? Where is she my Esmeralda? The kingdom I rule has lost all its splendour. She is like a swallow of spring... ...that someone has caught... ...and tied down the wings. She is there in the prison called la-Sonte. If she can't get away that is where she will stay... ...until she is hung. You need tell me no more. Where is she your Esmeralda? The small Paris streets... ...can't sing without her song. She is like a swallow of spring... ...that someone has caught... ...and tied down the wings. Will the birds they put in cages... ...ever ride upon the wind? Will the children life outrages... ...ever learn to love again? I lived my life like a swallow... ...I arrived here in the springtime. All the little streets I'd follow... ...all the gypsy songs were mine. Where's my friend who rings the church bells? Where are you, my Quasimodo? They will hang me as the light swells... ...you can break these bars I know. Esmeralda have you left me? Do you hide yourself away? I have counted every hour... ...I have missed you every day. Have you left upon a journey... ...with your handsome shining soldier? With no marriage taking love free... ...like the gypsy girl you are. Have you died out in the small streets... ...with no prayer to get to heaven? There's a priest who counts your heartbeat... ...if he comes near you must run. You remember at the street fair. When they hurt me on the great wheel. When you begged I gave you water. At your feet I had to kneel. On that day our friendship started... ...it will last as long as we live. Once together never parted... ...all we'll have to give we'll give. Will the birds they put in cages... ...ever ride upon the wind? Will the children life outrages... ...ever learn to love again? Cast away.... ...souls at bay. It's our dreams... ...they betray. Now they say... ...we can't stay. Prayers we pray... ...lost today. Put the shade... ...of your skin... ...with the shade... ...of my skin. Put the song... ...that you sing... ...with the dance... ...that I bring. Refugees... ...downward bound. Fill the streets... ...of your town. Can't we make a world... ...to which... ...everyone belongs? Can't we make a world... ...without fears, without frontiers? We're called names... ...we are blamed. We're kept down... ...we are shamed. In the night... ...torture comes. Try to speak... ...without tongues. My homeland... ...I hold here. In my heart... ...ever near. In your land... ...I find tears. Words that hurt... ...things to fear. In my heart... ...summer dies. From your grey... ...winter skies. Can't we make a world... ...to which everyone belongs? Can't we make a world... ...without fears... ...without frontiers? Cast away... ...souls at bay. It's our dreams... ...they betray. Now they say... ...we can't stay. Prayers we pray... ...lost today. Cast away. Cast away. Esmeralda this high court charges you... ...with having wounded a soldier true. If he is wounded he's living still... ...oh, let me see him one time if the court will. You have seduced him with foul sorcery... ...stabbed him to kill him it's plain to see. It wasn't me on my soul I swear. But you were alone with him in his bed there. There's a priest out of hell, who followed me. Out of the night he came, can't you see. This girl has all these wild imaginings. She always thinks she is seeing crazy things. I think he looks a lot like you sir. See how the devil looks out of her eyes. She is a stranger, a sorceress... ...she is a pig, she is a bohemienne. Did you commit this crime, and do you now confess? I am the victim here, I can say no more or less. Torturer come... ...I'll ask her the question again. She's only strong, because there's a devil within. Make her body feel the pain, only pain will bring the truth... ...the truth. Do you confess? I love him I confess. You will have to die for your sin. Assassins, assassins! Bohemian, you have confessed to using magic. To prostitution, and to attacking Phoebus de Chateaupers. On the day appointed you will be led from your cell to the Place de Greve... ...where you will be hanged. May God have mercy on your soul. Phoebus... ...if he's alive then it's God's will. Please tell him that I love him still. Phoebus... ...if you can hear, please come to me. Tell them the truth and set me free. Phoebus... ...tell them so they will let me be. Phoebus... ...when we went in and closed the door, I laid my knife upon the floor. Phoebus... ...the man in black I saw him there. He came behind you from somewhere. Phoebus... ...I saw my knife move through the air. Phoebus... ...I hope by everything above. Esmeralda does still have your love. Phoebus... ...the girl who danced once on the square who gave her life to you out there. Phoebus... ...each night in my dreams you appear. Please come and take me far from here. Phoebus. I was a happy man, until I saw her face. I hid my need away in some dark secret place. All that power of sex, I kept down and I never let go. I had only one design the truth of god and man to know. Oh, I'm a priest and I love this girl. I love with a love that destroys my world. Against the wind and the tide I could stand any shock. Straight and proud like Notre-Dame upon her rock. I let no woman near, I suffered for God's care. In the heart of the night I saw the lightning flare. Oh, I'm a priest and I love this girl. I love with a love that destroys my world. Heal me with your touch or hurt me once again. Make me suffer for my sin. Just lead me onto hell and I'll deny my Christ. For hell with you is paradise. Oh, I'm a priest and I love this girl. I love, yes I love, with a love that destroys my world. Oh, I'm a priest and I love this girl. Heal me with your touch or hurt me once again. Make me suffer for my sin. Just lead me onto hell and I'll deny my Christ. For hell with you is paradise. Oh, I'm a priest and I love this girl. I love, yes I love, with a love that destroys my world. Oh, I'm a priest and I love this girl. This girl. You ride so high and straight and fair. You look like you belong there. So strong and right and four square. No other man can compare... ...or maybe you don't really care. Just look for pleasure out there. And always get your share. Is there a heart in you somewhere? My heart is pure, my heart is rare. If you are hurt, I'll be there. We'll start again from nowhere. You'll have my heart if you will swear... You'll have my heart if you will swear that you will hang... ...the Zingara. I'm not a little girl now. I'll show you that I know how. I'll show you how I can be. You think that I am so pure. I tell you don't be so sure. I can be wild and free. Your words of love are hard to bear. Your promises are thin air. My heart is hard and I don't care. I'll leave you hanging out there. Unloose my belt, let down my hair. Come take me, if you still dare. Your love is all I want to wear. You'll have my heart if you will swear. You'll have my heart if you will swear that you will hang... ...the Zingara. You'll have my heart if you will swear. You'll have my heart if you will swear. ...that you will hang Esmeralda. ...that you will hang the Zingara. My heart was led away. I knew no right from wrong. The gypsy girl had made her magic strong. I knew no night or day. I lost my way back home. I would have died if I'd stayed too long. I, who hurt your heart, I am not the same. I'm down on my knees I accept the blame. I've had time to heal my body and soul. Tell me what to do to get back to you. My heart was led away. I knew no right from wrong. The gypsy girl wanted gold for her song. I knew no night or day. I lost my way back home. But here with you, I am where I belong. My heart was led away I knew no right from wrong. The gypsy girl for her sins will be hung. I've changed the night to day, I've found my way back home. Deep in my heart, I've loved you all along. Please tell me what to do to get back to you. I'm your priest and I've come to prepare you to die. I'm cold, I'm weak, can't you let me go? I've done nothing to anyone. The clock is striking five, it means that dawn will come soon. Very soon they'll unlock that door, very soon you will be no more. Very soon I'll find happiness. Will you still sing when you're bound... ...and dance at the hanging ground? What have I done to you... ...that you hate me through and through? It is not that I hate... ...it is that I love you. I love! What is it I have done... ...a gypsy girl alone? That love for me has come to you, the priest of Notre-Dame. One bright morning you danced... ...on the square in the sun. I watched you, so entranced... ...my whole world came undone. Now my heart ever still rules my mind and my will. All my empty life unfilled... ...and now since that day. Mirrors show no sign of my face... ...but Satan in my place. Of me, there is no trace. Oh, my love, he will come... ...light my days like the sun. He will come take me home... ...my dark days will be done. Come to close evil man... ...you will die by these hands. No one can hate like I can... ...you will die where you stand. Go to hell, that's what I demand. Give me one hour with you, I'll be yours to command. You must choose don't you see... ...before day dawns above. Choose the gallows or me... ...choose your death or my love. Choose the grave or my bed. To be living or dead. If you nod yes with your head... ...your bonds will be shed. I'll release you, and let you go... ...to the ones you love so... ...to the devils you know. Go away... Go away... Go away... Go away... Free today. Flown away. Souls at bay... ...find a way. I've set them... ...free today... ...souls at bay... ...find a way. - Free today. - Hear us pray. - Souls at bay. - Find a way. - Facing plague. - Who will pay? - Seize the day. - Whole worlds sway. - Free today. - Hear us pray. - Souls at bay. - Find a way. - Facing plague. - Who will pay? - It's our day. - Souls that pray. When they were locked away... ...I opened up the bars. Now they are free today. They're free to see the stars. Hear our prayer asylum now. Hear our prayer asylum now. Free today. Hear us pray. Souls at bay. Find a way. Hear our prayer asylum now. Free today. Free today. Free today. Moon... ...you who shine your light. Bright... ...on the Paris night. See... ...how a man suffers all for love. Clear... ...solitary star. So far... ...when the day returns. Please hear... ...up there so high the cry of the world. Please hear the cry... ...of a man in pain. For whom... ...all those million stars... ...don't shine... ...like those shining eyes. He loves... ...with a mortal love. Moon. Moon... ...please don't disappear. Before... ...you have time to hear. Just hear... ...how cries the heart of the human beast. Please hear the cry... ...Quasimodo cries. He cries... ...for his heart is full. His voice... ...over mountains flies. So high... ...that I know it flies to you. Moon. See... ...how this man aspires. To join... ...his poor voice with angels. Moon... ...you who shine your light. For... ...poets as they write. See... ...how a man suffers all for love... ...for love. This small whistle I'll leave, so you can call on me. Day's you'll hide from the light, but you can walk around at night. On the roof of my Notre-Dame for you the stars will come. You have nothing to fear, you know I'll be near. You're as still afraid of me... ...as I can see. Esmeralda when sleep has come... ...do you still see your shining sun? God you made the world all wrong, I'm so ugly, he's so fine. I would love her my life long, but she never would be mine. Now he owns her heart and soul, without giving her a thing. And she thinks he'll make her whole, with the love she thinks he'll bring. She will lie down at his touch, and believe his lies with pride. It's his face she loves so much, she can't see what's deep inside. God you made the world all wrong, he's so rich, and I'm so poor. He will make her life a song, he will give her nothing more. God you made the world all wrong, let her have her shining knight. Beauty to the rich belongs, not to us outside the light. I am just an ugly stain that the world just wants to hide. God you gave me so much pain, were you ever on my side? God you made the world all wrong, I have nothing, he has all. But I'll tell her all along he won't be there is she falls. He was born to silk and lace, to make love and to make war. I was born without a face, God, what did you make me for? Tell me what side God is on, those whose silver buys the host... ...or those who pray to god alone, day and night, this Holy Ghost? Can this Jesus we adore save his blessing only for. ...those three kings of gold and myrrh, and leave the shepherds at the door? God you made the world so wrong, I'm so ugly, he's so fine. I will love her my life long. But she never will be mine. A million stars light... ...this beautiful night. This is not a night to die... ...let me sing and dance, beneath the sky. I have such love to give... ...to give. I want a chance to live. Live... ...for the one I love. Love... ...as no one has loved. Give... ...asking nothing in return. Free... ...free to find my way. Free to have my say. Free to see the day. Be... ...like I used to be. Like a wild bird free. With all the love in me. Live... ...for the one I love. Love... ...as no one has loved. Give... ...asking nothing in return. Though this world tears us apart... ...we're still together in my heart. I want the world to hear my cry. And even if I have to die... ...love will not die. Love will change the world. Live... ...for the one I love. Love... ...as no one has loved. Give... ...asking nothing in return. I'll love... ...until love wears me away. I'll die... ...and I know my love will stay. And I know my love will stay. Asylum! Asylum! Asylum! Asylum!

A heart. A heart that love can heal. A heart that tears can chill. A heart that still can feel. A heart that had to kill. Look over there! Your sweet Esmeralda! Do you recall, Quasimodo... ...when she was dancing there down on the square? I sent her to the scaffold, don't you see? For she would not give her love to me. You have done this, you! On a cross like our Jesus she'll die! Look over there... ...the hangman awaits. For the gypsies cry. Your Esmeralda... ...its her that will hang. When the sun starts to rise! Frollo! Give her to me. Hand her to me. Leave her alone. She is my own. My Esmeralda. Don't go away. Please won't you stay? When the years have all come and gone... ...they'll find beneath the ground. Our two bodies joined as one. ...showing how we were bound. How much Quasimodo once loved... ...Esmeralda the gypsy girl. How he was marked by God above. ...just to help him to bear his cross. Just to help him to bear his cross. Eat my body and drink my blood... ...Vultures of Montfaucon. So that death more than this life could. Join our two names as one. Let my poor soul just fly away... From the miseries of this earth. Let my love find the light of day... ...in the light of the universe. In the light of the universe. Dance my Esmeralda... ...sing my Esmeralda. Dance just one more time for me. You know I'll die for love of you. Dance my Esmeralda... ...sing my Esmeralda. Please let my poor soul fly free. It is not death to die for you. Dance my Esmeralda... ...sing my Esmeralda. Please come sleep here in my arms. You know I'd die for love of you. Dance my Esmeralda... ...sing my Esmeralda. Beyond, and beyond beyond... ...it is not death... ...to die for you. Dance my Esmeralda... ...sing my Esmeralda. Please let my poor soul fly free. It is not death... ...to die for you. English Adaptation by BANQUO NOTRE-DAME OF PARIS From nowhere came the age of the cathedrals... ...the old world began. A new unknown thousand years. For man just has to climb up where the stars are. And live beyond life. Live in glass and live in stone. From nowhere came the age of the cathedrals. The old world began. A new unknown thousand years. For man just has to climb up where the stars are. And live beyond life. Live in glass and live in stone. But it is doomed the age of the cathedrals... ...barbarians wait... ...at the gates of Paris fair. Oh let them in, these pagans and these vandals. A wise man once said... ...in two thousand, this world ends. ...in two thousand, this world ends.
