I met him. I became a yakuza. The townsfolk adored the boss. He cared for them. Good morning. - Hello, sir. - Beautiful day, isn't it? What is this? Brother?! Shut your hole. You got it wrong! However... Even a wild town like ours was not... Immune to recession. Hard times hit mercilessly. Masaru Papa. Take this and kill me. I wish I'd never been born. Be with you soon, my Son. Boss! Boss... The boss did all... He could to protect his town. One day, maybe... I can be like him. Welcome back. Enter. Thank you, sir. This is Kageyama I can't recall you ever... Bringing your men around. You know. Sure. Wait here. Yes, sir. Hello. Hello. Extend your right foot. Son of 8 bitch! I'll beat you to a pulp! Don't lose your temper! Teacher. Yes. Like this? Yes, you're doing well. Thank you. "Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right foot... Turn to him the other also." Wonderful. Utterly wonderful. You're more civilian like every day. Good work. As a reward, have a cigarette. I've quit. You've quit? Marvelous! I guess it's time. Break a leg, guys. Where do they go? Off to Toyland. See? Still standing? Sit down. .Just Sit. My seat is there. It's well worn. Want a drink? Yes. You know. Sure. Down it. Bottoms up. Too soon? Boss, is it okay? Sure it is. He'll become one eventually. I don't mean that. You might want to try something better. Not for your health. Justin case. I wont touch civilians. May I have another? See? Thank you. Do it. Thanks! Well? No reaction? It was delicious. Goddamned dumb fuck. Dipshit Fucking can't even get a tattoo! Yakuza is this. Bullshit. Not bullshit! Yakuza is about taking it. That's why we call tattoos "endurance" My skin is sensitive! You haven't a clue how much... Endurance my sensitive skin has built up! Who gives a fuck? Go rub cream on it, asshole! I'm sick of your puppy shit attitude As long as I can take it... I've no need for tattoos. The boss returns! Boss. What happened? He took on the Karatani gang across the bridge. No, they tried to rough up a teacher. I told them not to pick on civilians. So, I educated them physically. Who's gonna cover yer fuckin' ass now? Say, teach. Gambling at your age only... Hurts those around you. Take it as a life lesson and move on. Yes. Go. I'll patch things up with them. Is your going necessary? Yes. Okay, then. You seem down. After you're out, let's get dinner. Us two? No, no. With the boss, of course. Say... If you had one wish... what would it be? A tattoo. You know, one just like the boss's. I See. How about you? Ask me later. Well, I'll get you something when you get out. You cool? Later. Sir. Why are you fucking here? Sorry. Why aren't you with the boss? He told me to check on you. What? Who knows? He wants you to hook up with Kyoko She'd never go with a yakuza Boss! Well, catch you later. What's up with you? Boss... It's coming. Finally coming. The boss, he saved us. He gave our life meaning. We must hang in until the recession ends. Masaru has his problems. But so do we all. Yes. The shopping district gets by thanks to the boss. He's kept out the chains and supermarkets. I'm not cut out for this modern era crap. You're a modern boy. You two, leave. Go! Never set foot here again. That's what I said. I'm as happy as a clam at high tide now. I broke away to live life my way. As a yakuza Excuse me. Is here Akihabara? What? Is this Akihabara! Boss! Masaru Masaru Sneaky bastard! Boss! Damn you. Fucker! Boss... Take my blood... And walk the path of... A yakuza vampire! Where's Hogan? Not here. There's a knitting class in the basement. Huh? What the fuck? Who? Feed? The boss was a vampire? We entrusted our lives to a vampire. Let's move on to the next step. We can talk about that later. How's it hanging? You know. Gotcha. Pee you! Hey folks! Save your lame reactions. For sure, I'm a kappa goblin. Gander all you want at my kappa-ness. What's up? Yeah, well, I wanna discuss the plans in detail. As a bigwig in the organization, watch yer mouth when talkin' to me. Well, the shit's hit the fan. Which means? He's coming. He? Who's coming... sir? For all intents and purposes... The modern monster. The world's toughest terrorist! Kyoken's pretty strong. But there's no comparison. It's so chilling, you gotta laugh. Why? The boss is already dead. As for the reason... my beak is sealed. But... There'll be hell to pay if we don't finish... Before he awakens. He? What the... Hell? Alive? What the hell is this? I hunger. I thirst. Why are you running, asshole? Sit the fuck down. Forgive him, I beg you. I'll mop the floor with your brains! Honey! Honey! Kageyama Basie rd. No hurting... The non-yakuza. The boss's rules, remember? Hold it. You were the shitbag that didn't protect him. Me? Yeah. For that, you must pay. With your life! Hot, hot. Hot. Burning up... Don't touch civilians! Kageyama? Are you... "Suck" Honey! I'm not supposed to hurt civilians. Idiot! What did you do? I'm sorry. What did I do? You. Die! .Just kill yourself and die! Yes. Die! Nobuko No... No need to apologize, Kageyama Nice... I feel so... nice. Nobuko No! Stop! Not in public. Besides, it's been a while. Honey! Mr. Hasegawa? What is it? Nobuko Honey! Everyone. I'm very sorry. I was happy as a yakuza I have no regrets. Wait... "Goodbye" Not right... "For reasons of a personal nature..." No. "The family is experiencing an emergency..." No! That's wrong. "More than feelings..." It's all about feelings. More than words, its feelings. First, I should hug her and... Kageyama? What are you doing here? You okay? Why still the bandage? You're healed, right? I've been crying all day. The boss has been murdered. It's beyond belief. By the way... Wasn't there something you wanted to ask me? I've been through an ordeal. I thought losing my sight wouldn't matter. But that's inconsiderate After all the boss did for me. Paying the surgery fee... Despite all that's happened... Your smile I want to see your smile. Kageyama No, no good. OW... That hurt. Not again. I'm bad... no good. A dream? How do you feel? I had a horrible dream. What about? Well... You're eating soba noodles but it turns out you're eating frog eggs. Then they grow into tadpoles - That dream, right? Uh, yeah... I see. You are the real deal. The blood... You want to limit your intake to 250 ml per session. About the size of a soda can. Your blood enters the body wherever you bite. They will become yakuza vampires. Civvy blood tastes good. It's entirely addictive. Blood of yakuza tastes bad and is low in nutrition. See, you have to take in blood. But too many of you will lead to disaster. However, if you only get by on yakuza, you'll be undernourished. That's why... The boss hid his true ability Then... Why did he bite me? Good point. I was told to give this to you. Ah! Now I get it. Get what? It's clear to see. Well, you got me. What's it mean? It means we don't know shit- When do we know? It's not something you ask! Right now you're as blank as this paper. You'll find out yourself and with your own body. Myself? Right. There's a reason. He chose you! The boss's blood beats within you. Hop to those beats! Blood! You suck it! Suck! Suck! Screwing around? Sorry! Idiots, go find Kageyama! Fucking half-wits. Araietsu Yes. Say... Do you... Hear a drip-drop sound? What? No, nothing. It's pretty loud. What? Maybe your ears are ringing? It's not that. You're right. I hear something. Captain. It's in your head. Isn't it? It's me. Kageyama What? Masaru Do you want revenge? I cant You can't? Your mind sails the sea of an emotional storm. Direct it outward, not inward. When you get pissed, punch. Itll feel great. Close your eyes. "Suck" Rise, Masaru You are no longer the wimp you once were. Place your bets. Bets down. Even. All bets now closed. What is this? Reveal! Five. Two. Odd. We're gambling. Hey! This is our goddamn territory. Whaddya think you're doin', tramp? Your high school is? Ninato Niachi High. Grade 2. Class 3. A minor gang. You mean class. Want a piece of me? Give it your best shot, fuckwad. I am, you know, a realtor. We realtors love high school girls like this. What kinda shit are you spewing? Don't fucking laugh. I'm a yakuza of sorts. It's my shitty life. One doesn't just become yakuza- Then... How do you become yakuza? Right. Do we take some sort of national exam? Isn't that against the antitrust laws? We've no room... For two-bit hoods like you. What the fuck? Want to give your words meaning? Find your enemy. Avenge the boss. Without vengeance... Without setting things right... You're not yakuza Don't wrinkle your skirt, girlie. Sister. I'll handle these pricks. That's yakuza! Real deal yakuza! Bitch. I am, you know, a realtor. We realtors love nurses like this. You fuckin' with me? You find this funny? As for me... I'm Nikiko, a bit of a novice. We haven't shared sake yet. You'd better leave before you get hurt. All of you, out, now. Did you speak? Captain! Why dontcha pump a couple bullets in me... If yer so hell-bent on fighting? Life's a struggle for survival anyway. Captain. Get the picture? Hey... Is there a leak somewhere? Huh? Captain. Captain! Captain! Captain. Watch it, asshole. What the fuck? Why're you walking like that? Can't you walk normal? What's with the fake yakuza? Where are the civvies? Excuse me. Sorry. Hey, captain. Mama, mama! You're normal, right? What are you talking about? A yakuza is going nuts in my place. Do something about it. Hey! She's got trouble. Do something! Hey! What? Do I look like I work for free? You're a public worker. Public worker yakuza I abuse my authority, drink booze, and play. Listen, I pay you people. Do something. A civilian is in trouble. That's where we come in. Captain, are you okay? Let's go. Let's try here next. Fucker What the hell? I paid for the woman. Cut the shit- You're not an animal. Aren't you the school teacher? Sawada, right? Kiss my ass. Teach... Get your shit together. You're a pain in the fucking ass. Here's your money back. Let her go and... Bastard! Whoa! What are you doing, teach? Well? Wanna rumble? I'm yakuza Ready to fight. Teach, calm down. Wanna start life over? Get a gun. What's happening? "Suck" Come on! You don't wanna do that. I don't mind. Oh, and... I'm a yakuza now. Fuck your protection fees. All of it! Let's not get... So, you gonna bite us too? Bring it on! Try me, fuckers. I'll kill you. What a putrid stench! They must taste like crap! FUCK off, dog Shit! What them? Captain. OW! What the fuck? Over there. A kid? Huh? Is that that dead guy's son? Masaru? It's dying time. Go! Now! Drive! Drive! Stop. Stop. Kageyama? Back it up! Hold it! What is it? Again. My head goes drip. Captain. We've more pressing matters. Decreasing civilians. No civvies means no revenue, and no gang. You could say we've been living off their blood. Now what? They're turning into yakuza and sucking blood. We must secure the civvies Right? Captain. What's that? No way. Is her brain melting? It's Kageyama! Protect the captain! Inside! Protect the captain! Captain. Avenge the boss. Captain. In the car. You guys, go! Kageyama! Calm down. Calm down! Calm down, bastard. I'm yakuza Fuck that noise! Fucker! Dynamite? Your bath is hot and ready. Your bath is hot and ready. Hey, let's get out of here. Hey! Why did you interfere? I was taking my revenge. You were in a serious bind! You're lucky I came. You should be thanking me. Know what? A great power welled up within me. That's not all. Your wounds have healed. You've taken the boss's power. Soon, you'll be in full control. How did he... Take my blood... And walk the path of... A yakuza vampire! Boss... Smells like oranges. Oranges? Maybe... That's the point, baby. Burn it. "Stay foolish" Stay foolish? I get it now! You do? You can do it! You can! Stay foolish and you can beat them. You want blood. Basically... You want my blood? Basically... It's no lie to say I'm scared. Can I really do this? Don't give up. Because... You want to be the greatest, right? A man like the boss. He's coming. At last Here for a store opening? I wanna double-check. I can join your organization, right? We're past that Stage already. When someone is about to be beheaded... Do you worry if the plate is dry? What's that fucking mean? Is someone feeling a bit feisty? My plate's gone a tad dry. Shit! What the hell? Oh... Long time no see. Hold on. This is the frightening guy? He's the modern monster... the world's toughest terrorist. Take a look at this. It's Kamiura's blood. Here it comes! The bulging eye stare down! Like a frog in headlights? Hardly. He'll stare a car off a cliff. The ol' Kaeru-kun death stare. Why don't you cool down? Here. Here. Kaeru-kun truly despises yakuza This one does what we tell him to do. Please release him. The blood of the immortal yakuza has been passed onto another. This is where you come in, Kaeru-kun Crapola. What the fuck was that? Chilled to the bone. This is fucking bullshit! I'll make 'em pay. Don't fuck with the Japanese yakuza! This way. "Honesty Farm"? Captain? What are you doing? Don't step on it! On what? My crop. Crop? Move your fucking feet! I'm growing them. First... You nourish them with milk. Freshly kneaded. Milk. And then... See? It sprouts... sprouts. Quickly, quickly... Healthy and strong. We cultivate decent civilians. Harvest! A bumper crop! In this way... We can drink the blood of the living. Without civilians... Yakuza cannot survive. Know what I'm thinking? Uh... I mean, what's on my mind. Boss. Watch me now. Where are Aratetsu and Angus... At a busy time such as this. Captain! Fuckers I control the garden of civilians. You are of use no longer! Die! What is it? Hold... Hold up there! Don't ride like... This is no good! This is really no good! You, huh? Not so fast. The kid. There's something he must do. Masaru, can you handle it? You... What do you know of me? Kudos for waiting. It's me instead of the boss. Angus! Aye! Angus! Run it over! Flatten the fucker! Squashed him like a bug! Piece of shit scallywag Shit! Angus! Fuck, Angus. You okay? Sometimes yakuza just gotta go wild. Right! Kageyama! Yakuza kick ass. Know why? We don't care about winning or losing. We just fucking fight! Kageyama, I'll take care of him. Don't fuck it up. Later. All right. Oh really? Angus, go help your brother. Yes, sir. Oh, fuck! No fucking good! Subtract stupid from yakuza and you've nothing left! I'll get your head and apologize to the boss with it. That hurt. Damn asshole. Brother! Brother... Angus! What's happening? What's happening to the world? Bring it on. My blood boils. Wait Kyoko? You won't win like that. Watch and see. I'll win. You know why I'm here, right? Drink my blood. Save the world.
