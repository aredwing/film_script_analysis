[AUDIENCE CHEERS] That's my sister right there. WOMAN: Hayley, you rock! We have a little song about obsession. Aah! # the voice said to go # move me # impossibly tall # to walk and I've over it WOMAN: It was always me and my brother. We used to hide under my bunk bed. I'd come up with a line. Jack would pluck a melody out of the air. But then the songs started to work. # let me in, let me in # the look in your eye that is punishing me # So we packed up the truck and moved to I.A. Whoo! Oh, my god! The music was like our secret place. And jack and I were two halves of the key. And we walk towards the fire. Ready to erupt. Nothing could hurt us. Because jack and I had each other. And then I met carter. - Hi. - Hi. He's a journalist, not a musician. But he loved my lyrics, my words. Things happened really fast. Pregnant with twins. Beautiful. I was 19. Carter's daughter Lila was our flower girl. She lives with her mom half the time. Jack was our best man. Do you cherish her? - Of course. - Cherish her. Of course. Jack! - I love you. - I love you too. Bye. Okay. WOMAN: Bye! [CROWD CHEERING] [CANS RATTLING] WOMAN: Carter and I were baby bjorning it. Jack was busy doing what rock stars do. [JACK SINGING SOFTLY] # we are the flesh, we are the blood # # baby, you and me We got Willie nelson coming to our show. Gonna get high with Willie. Give it to me. Jack. Jack. Jack. Go fucking call an ambulance! MAN: He's od-Ing. Baby, wake up. WOMAN: I don't know if it was the hand of fate Or if I'd abandoned him. The guilt pulled me away from my husband And my kids. It took months before I even started to write again. But then the lyrics just poured out of me Like a volcano. And then all the songs Ended up being about jack. I like your new hair. Blond. Kind of like a rock-Angel thing going on. Yeah. Yeah. [COUGHS] So how do you replace someone As special as your brother on guitar? Well... uh... Enzo is... Is great. Annie heard him playing in a bar. At the audition, it turned out He knew all of our songs really well. Enzo sort of looked like my brother. - Rock and roll. - You got it, baby. You'll hear him. He's coming on... [HORN HONKS] - I'm so sorry, guys. The limo's here. We can meet at a place... yeah. Nobody can replace my brother. That's... That's not what this is about. This album is just my way of honoring him. Well, I look forward to hearing it. Thank you. CHILD: Hiya! Oh! Oh! This is my ball! Ha ha. How'd it go? Well, I think we have ourselves another spin cover. - Fingers crossed, right? - Mm-Hmm. - All right, thanks again. - Thank you. Bye. - Oh. Put that in the car? - Yeah. Hurry up. I'll just be a sec. Say goodbye to your mother. Wow! Good hug. I'm going to miss you guys. I love you. You guys go with Mrs. R. Now, okay? I'm going to go say goodbye to daddy. Mmm. You okay? - Yeah. Just... - Yeah? Never perform without jack. Well, it's Austin. It's your home turf. Say your byes. Let's do this. - Bye. - Bye. [LIMO STARTS] WOMAN: Johnny! MAN: Hayley! Open. - Ahh. - Ahh. - Highly inflamed. - Yep. You need to moderate your drinking... Let's just administer the shot, okay, doc? Just a little numbing spray. Okay. So this is going to go down your nose. There we go. Say "ahh." - Ahh. - A little prick. # the voice said to go # move me # impossibly tall to walk, and I'm over it # # so I fashioned a key # I twisted it and I'm inside # let me in, let me in # you know, I won't stop until I can see # # let me in, let me in # the look in your eye that is punishing me # # I won't stop # no, I won't stop # I won't stop # no, I won't stop # I won't stop # no, I won't stop # let me in, let me in # the look in your eye that is punishing me # Thank you, Austin. Y'all are awesome. So our new album came out today. And we're going to play a new song off of that. This is for jack. [AUDIENCE CHEERS] # where did you go # why did you go, my mystery # you left me alone # you left me to drown in misery # # so where are you now # why would you want to leave me # # to go sleep in the clouds and dream # # still shining down on me # in pieces underneath # 'cause half of me is gone # half of me is gone # baby, please wake up # baby, please wake for me now # ooh [INAUDIBLE] # ooh [MUSIC ENDS] [LIGHT APPLAUSE] Thank you so much, Austin. Give me a second. Yeah? Uh, did you hear the applause on "half of me"? Yeah. No. There wasn't any. Sometimes the new ones take time to grow on you. You know that. Okay? Smile. It's your party. Hayley, can you sign this for me, please? - Sure. - Thanks. Big fan. Can you kiss that too with the black? I'm sorry? Just put on the black lipstick and kiss it. Uh, that's not really my color. Just put the lipstick on, okay? Hey! She said it's not her color. Hey! MAN: Come here! Hayley! Hayley, come back here! ENZO: I better walk you to your room just in case. HAYLEY: Okay. Do you... Do you want to come and hang out for a little bit Or is... Is that awkward? Come on, girlfriend. Who's going to worry about me? Okay. ENZO: You shouldn't look at that. Yeah, well, I try not to, but... this guy has written, like, half a fucking novel About how I don't have any talent left. The new songs are too sentimental, And they don't have any edge. Hayley, don't read the blogs. I mean, even the douche bag from spin hated it. Like, of everything I've done, You would think that this time They would have a little more compassion. You can't take this personally. Well, I wrote, like, half a dozen songs About the death of my brother. It's pretty personal. Hayley... you already got one going over there. Yeah, I do. Look, maybe you just need someone To bounce some stuff off of. Like you and jack did. Come on, sit down. I am going to give you a neck rub. My little goody bag. - For you. - Thank you. Just relax. I don't know if it's the xanax or the vodka, But I'm feeling kind of trancy. Unh. Feel that? Ahh. That is a massive knot. Girlfriend, you are stressed. Mind if I go deep down into the tissue? Go as hard as you can. [MACHINE VIBRATING] [ENZO CHUCKLES] [HAYLEY SIGHS] [GROANS] I'll do anything you want, Hayley. I just want you to feel good. It feels really good. [MOANING] [MOANS LOUDER] [BUZZING] BOY: Mommy, I hate rabies. Rabies? Okay. You're looking better, Benjy. I like your scarf, Lila. Very cool. I want to go back to my friends. Okay. [BENJY MUMBLES] - Bye. - Talk to you then. What are you working on? Trying to finish that Texas debutante murder story For vanity fair. There's so many grisly details about the bucket, Knots of hair, and... Sorry. Being a dick. Just distracted with everything going on. But I'm here. Wow. You look relaxed, Like you went to the spa or something. I miss you. Yeah, I miss you too. Carter, some of the bloggers have not been very positive About the new album. Those bozos are just jealous, I'm just saying. You know, and you don't even need to do another album For a while. You know, after I get this book deal... Make a few bucks... You could take some time off. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] WOMAN: Are you up? Just a second. Okay. I got to go brace myself for whatever's next. Bye. CARTER: Bye. - Hey. - Hey. Where you Skype sexting carter by any chance? Ew! That's for my children. Thank you. You're disgusting. Okay. Ah, are you hungry? I brought you food. Wow. Glamorous. Has the label cut our expense account already? [GROANS] WOMAN: What? Are you serious? Are sales really that bad? It's early. Can't really... what is this? No, Annie, it's not... It's not early. It's not like we're some new band. I mean, if anything we should come out strong and fade. You just stay positive and I worry about the numbers. This is so sticky here. What are they cleaning this thing with? Ugh. What did you... What did the other bands that you managed do In this situation? Um, well, I have a comeback list. Stop calling me, please. Okay. Here we go. Yes, number one... You hold a big charity event. I'm already talking to whale people. That one's done. Number two... Date a hot celebrity. Obviously not an option. Obviously always an option. Number three... You just get out and... This one has a tendency to backfire. Delete. You know what? You just have to write a great song. With more edge. [INAUDIBLE] [ELECTRIC GUITAR PLAYING] Get your jacket. And bring your guitar. HAYLEY: Come on! There's a guy. Back up, motherfucker! Enzo, it's a deer. Deer don't attack people. Well, there's been a few cases reported. Heh. Come on. Annie told me to write a new hit song. Like I can just push a button or something. You bring your little book? Let me hear some lyrics. Come on. Okay. I have something. But it's really rough, okay? As long as it's really rough. - It's really rough. - Okay, good. So I just have that. And I thought it would kind of go... # if I let you in # let you see inside No, that sucks. - No, it's good. - Uh-Uh. Try something like... [HUMMING] Okay. # if I let you in # let you see inside # I don't know if I can hang on # # to what I used to be # I let it die # crawling around me # it's all yours No. Stop, Enzo. I'm trying to be good. You are good. Uh-Uh. This is crazy. We have to go. Come on. What's crazy? That you and I make great music together And have even better sex? We didn't have actual sex last night. [SIGHS] You know we did. It's okay. We used protection. Enzo, I was really wasted. I... I have a husband. I have kids. And you're into guys. Whoever said I was gay? What is gay anyway? I really don't want to hurt anybody. Maybe this could just be What happens on tour stays on tour. I'm really good at keeping secrets. [GASPS] Don't worry. I won't do anything Unless you want me to. You didn't do anything like this last night. Yeah? First time's always free. [HAYLEY VOCALIZING] [MOUTHS WORDS] [LIGHT APPLAUSE] Thank you so much, Austin. WOMAN: There we go. Oh, that guy in a coat and tie... He dropped that off for you. Ugh. Fuckin' creepy fan. Ew... ANNIE: ...these reviews are brutal. Apparently her brother had more than half the talent. Even pitchfork doesn't like us. I almost fell asleep during the song. You guys are assholes. But some of that shit the critics said was spot on. Enzo and I have been working on a new song. And it's going to blow your fuckin' brains out As long as you write bass line for it. Yeah! - Fuck pitchfork! - Yeah! Get me a drink right now! - Yes, ma'am! - Thank you. Uh-Uh. Take that. It's much stronger. When can we hear the song? Well, you just keep the party favors coming, Giselle, you'll have a new song by morning. - Uh-Huh. - Egh! Aah! Dirty! I love it. Yeah. Cheers! [BOTH SINGING SOFTLY] Yeah? Focus! Okay. # this is what [SINGING SOFTLY] I think that's good. - All right. - Okay. Wow. Hayley and jack, huh? When did you get that? Uh... i was 19. A lot of fans got 'em after your second album. Didn't you see the photos on your web site? No, I must've missed those. Did you miss this? Uh, can you stop for a minute? Those guys are, like, our only neighbors. Evie, Paul. Hi. Beautiful night, huh? They're friendly. Yeah. Well, my kids kind of torture their dogs. So... it's just this next driveway here. Thank you. Hmm. No one's home. DRIVER: You going to be okay? Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure they'll be home soon. I think carter emailed me something actually. I'll take this one. I'll get these. Thank you. Want me to wait? Uh, no. It's fine. Have a good night. - You too. - Bye. [POP] Guys? Cody? Benjy? Mrs. R.? Carter? [TOY MUSIC PLAYS] Cody, Benjy? Aah! Hey. What's wrong, mommy? Nothing. I just missed you guys. Uh, where's Mrs. R.? Where's daddy? Ciao. Hi. Oh, forgive me. I'm Camila. I'm your nanny for the day. Your husband said he emailed you. Uh, yeah. Maybe. I think so. Um... I brought the boys a gift. I hope you don't mind. [PASSES GAS] Uh, Benjy. Sorry. BENJY: I accidentally farted. That's very cool. Thank you. Your nanny Mrs. R. Had some family issues. And so the agency sent me. Your husband had a late interview. I'm sorry for the confusion. No. It's... It's fine. I guess I just didn't read the whole email. But, um, sorry. The door was unlocked. So I just got a little freaked out. You have nothing to worry about. I am practically a ninja. - Hiya! - Ya! Careful guys. I think you guys are gonna be happy, Because I've got presents for you. Yay! HAYLEY: Where are they? BOYS: Yeah! Where are our presents? Help. You know what? I think maybe I left them in the limo. [PHONE RINGS] Oh. I bet that is the limo driver right now Calling about your presents. - Hello? - Hey, it's Enzo. I found the puppets in my bag. Yeah. We were just looking for them. ENZO: Must've put 'em in there by mistake. Um, when's a good time to get them? ENZO: How about now? Hey. Uh, how... How... Your little side gate was open. - Right. - It's okay. I locked it. Oh. Here they are. Awesome. Thank you so much for driving all the way over. I missed you a little. Uh, I've got to go get back to my tribe. - Hi! - Hi! Guys, look at your presents. - What does this do? - Well, let me show you. - Careful, careful. - Hold on. I'll show you. It'll talk right here. BOY: Cool. But you have to record it first. But how do we turn it on? Well, let me see the instructions. Hmm. Can't really read 'em out here. - Come in. - Okay. So what you do. Excuse me. [HIGH PITCHED VOICE] you push this button here On my lovely husband's behind. And you push it and you talk. Say something. I'm going to eat you up. [RECORDING] I'm going to eat you up. You've been bad. Okay, guys. You're being weird. Come on. Time to go to bed. I'm sorry. Extreme kiddy fatigue. - Night everybody. - Night, stinky! Oh, you're the stinky ones! I'll work on the song tomorrow. Aah! Fuck, Benjy! Enzo, really? Benjy, no biting. You know, he plays guitar with that hand, kiddo. - Sorry, Enzo. - It's okay. It's just how I make a living, you know? Go brush your teeth, okay? Go brush your teeth. I'll be in in a sec. Uh, are you available tomorrow? For as long as you'd like. Cool. May I? What a gentleman. Never leave again. Except to get dog food. Dog food? We don't even have a dog, Bengal. But daddy said we will very soon. Did he say that? Yes. Well, we'll just have to talk about that another time. Goodnight, baby. - Goodnight. - Muah. Love you. Sleep well. One more kiss. Muah. Sleep tight, okay? [HEAVY BREATHING] [EXHALES] [CARTER GROANS] You're not getting off that easy. What's that supposed to mean? I missed you. [CARTER GROANS] You good? Yeah. Or do you want... No, I'm okay. I'm okay. Sorry. It has been a while. But next time I promise. Scout's honor, it's all you. Okay. All right. I'm going. Okay. I'm glad you're back though. ANNIE: Good morning. I hope this video boosts the sales a little. So am I going straight to the choreographer's loft Or what? I think maybe sit down for one second. Okay. They cut the shit out of the budget. Slashed it in half. Where's... Let me use your phone. - I'm calling Nigel right now. - I would not recommend... No, I want him to tell me himself. Actually the label doesn't want a video For "half of me" anymore. They killed the shoot, Hayle. And the money is from me for the new song. Annie. No. No. That's crazy. No. You know what is crazy though? Driving all day and all night just to listen To some scrawny 16 year old girl and her weirdo brother Play you three songs In their parents' McAllen, Texas, garage. That's crazy. But it's called faith, Hayle. And I have believed in you since the second I signed up for this insanity. We'll find a young kid director. Make something artsy. I pull every single favor that I have in this town And we make this video. I fuckin' love you. Yeah? Yes. You are a liar. But I love you too. Shit. I'm good at what I do. - Okay. - Okay. So you go to this choreography session And you dance that little skinny butt off. Because the label has already paid for that. And we make our video that much better. Yeah? Thank you. [MUFFLED SINGING] # no, I won't stop Whoo! Yeah! Wow. Very good. Hi everyone. What's... What's happening? Carter sent me a text. Oh, yeah. The puppets broke. And Camila here said that Enzo could fix 'em. I brought the new song anyway. I wanted to show it to you. I mixed it last night. Oh, and I brought my puppet tool kit. Well, thank you. That's very cool. And he taught me something. Let's give her a little show. - Oh, yeah. - All right. Okay, ready? - This one. - Okay. All right. # let me in, let me in # let me in, let me in That's awesome. That's great. - Thank you. - That's awesome. - I'm so proud of you. - Thank you. I can't even get you to play guitar hero. Enzo's persuasive. Miss Sinclair, this came for you. Um... coat and tie fan guy? How did he get my address? CARTER: Is that a snake's head? Egh. Somebody take that somewhere else, please. Yikes. Who is this fan anyway? He is, uh, I don't know. Some psycho in a suit. He chased me in Austin. Yeah. It was weird. He was just, like, running after us. We had to hide. We? Who's we? I'm not the most macho guy. So... we hid instead. No. No, it was not funny at the time. Ooh, ripe. That reminds me. I brought tomatoes from my garden. Heirloom tomatoes. Seriously, it's kind of creepy. Now he's stalking me in I.A. It's scary. All the way from Texas to mess with these guns? I don't think so. [BOYS SCREAM] Yeah, no. I don't think so. He's welcome to come, huh? Right? Okay. Dinner's almost ready. BOY: I hate tomatoes. ENZO: Well, every time you eat one, You give yourself 10 minutes of extra super powers. - Really? - Whoo-Hoo. Why don't you ease up on the potato juice a little bit? You know, just a touch? Given everything that's happened, I think Hayley's earned the right to unwind a little. Don't you? Yeah. Yeah, no. I think we all have. Cheers to that. BOY: Cool! Cheers, big ears. Can I see it? This? Who's hair is this? Well, it belongs to my soul mate. Look, mommy. It's the same color as yours. Well, lots of people have that color hair. It's the same as yours too. Give it back to Enzo. - Eh. - Thank you, sir. BOY: Thank you, sir. [CHUCKLES] This is good. - Oh! - Boom! Threat neutralized. Yeah! Uh, I'm going to go to bed. Yeah, I should probably go too. Well, It has been a lovely evening. No. No. You're not riding through the canyon tonight. Babe, why don't we make him a bed out there in the studio? Oh, and I wanted you to hear the song too. It's just a demo. Both of you. I think I'm going to wait until she's ready for me to hear it. I don't really want to start world war iii. Oh, I hear you on that one. Uh, let's just call him a cab. Come on, babe, you have people Stay in your studio all the time. Yeah, he's not even drunk. And you're the judge? You've been going at it Like it's mardi gras all night. - Whatever you say, dad. - Whoa. Come on, Enzo. Play me that song. [SIGHS] Can't live with 'em, can't kill 'em, right? Right. [DOOR SHUTS] Not cool, Enzo. You can't just show up like that. You told me you wouldn't do anything unless I wanted you to. Hayley, your husband texted me. What was I supposed to do? I didn't want him to get all suspicious. - I'm calling you a cab. - Just... Listen. [MUSIC STARTS] # if I let you in # let you deep inside # I don't know if I can hold # to what I used to be # I let it die # coil around me, it's all yours # There's a camera over there. How did you do that? I've never sounded like that before. Tripled your vocals. Mixed them at slightly different frequencies. [HAYLEY GASPS] Don't bite me. [MOANS] Hey. You were out there for a while. How'd it go? Yeah. We just had to talk about the track for a bit. It's just a demo but it sounds wicked. Well, that's awesome. Can't wait to hear it. All right, so this guy tied up his victims With the exact same clove knot as the debutant killer. Right? I'm gonna send you the link. Fascinating. Awesome. I can't wait to see it. You want to come take a shower with me? I took one after my run. So... Okay. Well, I'll be back soon. Okay. Whoa! [KIDS LAUGHING] Hayley, check this out. I'm restringing this piano with real cow guts. I'll layer it into the track. Enzo. Enzo! You need to back off. You have to cut me some slack. This is... It's too much. Okay? Um, where's your garden? Your heirloom tomatoes? I always say that. I mean the sunset junction market. Pretty much live out of that place. Uh... oh, look at this bolex. It's about the only thing my father gave me. [CAMERA WHIRRS, STOPS] I want to show you something. Something that I made. Annie liked it. I'm a very affordable director. Especially for you. Irish gin. Try this. My friends in Portland home brewed it. Why am I not surprised that you make films, Enzo? [DARK MUSIC PLAYS] I made this a long time ago. Kind of my early childhood memories. My father thought I was too effeminate. I'm sorry. ENZO: Only my mother really understood me. That's my sister. My real sister. Daddy's favorite. HAYLEY: She's beautiful. Very cool style. So do I get the job? Yes. It's stunning. I mean, you inspired me. Even way before I met you, I used to listen to your songs over and over And play along with them. Wow, your sister's a really good actress. Her fear seems very real. Yeah. HAYLEY: Wow. Enzo, it's so... disturbing. So universal. Pain, pleasure. Light, darkness. In order to create... you have to embrace the dark side. ENZO: Stay right there. You'll do whatever I say. [CAMERA WHIRRS] Shh. Yes. You can struggle. But you can't escape. Okay. Get up. Reload. Thank you. That's great. This is a macro lens. It'll get you in closer. Get on the ground. Hey! This is awkward, huh? Yeah. You know if he wasn't gay, I might just have to kill him. Anyway, the lime tree's gonna fall. So I'm gonna brace it. ENZO: Sean, could you put a little lip gloss On my finger, please? Thanks. And we're rolling. [CAMERA WHIRRS] Part your lips. Do not push her too hard. We're shooting the wide stuff now anyway. Annie, I know exactly how hard to push. Tighten the dress up. Even more. Annie, can I get a drink. I'm on it. - Like, a real drink? - Definitely on it. Suck it. There you go. Okay. That's good. Thank you. All right. Ah. Camila, why don't you take 'em in the house? Oh. Come on. Are my kids wearing leashes? Uh... i think so. Yeah. They're not gonna get lost in the crowd. And we're back. [CAMERA WHIRRS] # if I let you in # let you deep inside # I don't know if I can hang on # # to what I used to be # I let it die # coil around me, it's all yours # # this is what you came for, but you took so much more # # much more than I can give # this is what you came for # now it takes so much more # much more for me to live # close enough to fall and die # close enough to thrill me # close enough to crawl deep inside # # keep me close enough to kill MAN: # close enough to kill [LABORED BREATHING] You guys, the label is gonna flip over this new video. Oh, my god! Enzo, come here! ANNIE: Enzo, I'm going to Nigel right away. Ahh! Uh. I'm so happy. Happy manager! Happy manager! The partridge family is here. You guys want to give 'em some space. - Sure. - Let's do it. Come on. Enzo, that means you too. Come on. [DOOR CLOSES] Let's give them some family time. Okay? [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR OPENS] Get your ski on. Bye! Can we see the video? Ah, not a chance, kid. Well, maybe Lila and I can see it. I'm 11, you know. Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, as soon as I get a copy, You guys can see it. Who wants to go to the ridge and hunt for coyotes? [IMITATING COYOTES] Let's go! BOY: We're doing a race. Look what I found! LILA: Oh. Look coyote vomit! Well, good. I was getting hungry. Slightly better than your mother's cooking. Oh, gross! Come on. Let's keep exploring. Let's go. So why don't you try something natural, like, You know, melatonin? Yeah, like, I tried the melatonin. But the xanax is the only thing That actually calms me down enough to fall asleep. So I thought maybe I could just get A couple more months of that. Any recent illnesses, Severe cold, sore throat? Nope. When was your last period? Uh... well, it was before the tour. So... DOCTOR: Today's the 27th. When did the tour actually begin? Six weeks ago. Okay. Well, Hayley, You are pregnant again. Congratulations. This is good, right? Yeah. Uh... it's just that my husband has had a vasectomy. Well, they don't always work. Studies say 1 in 2,000. Really? No more xanax. No booze. No cigarettes. [KIDS YELLING] CODY: Mommy, Benjy hitted me. But Cody started it. [YELLING CONTINUES] HAYLEY: Hey, Benjy, no. Hi, you're home early. Um... You know, I shouldn't have looked at this. But... are you pregnant? Looks like it. The stick was blue. See, I thought you didn't want another kid. Yeah, you thought that. But you never asked me. Just like you never consulted me about the vasectomy. I told you I was thinking about it. You were all for it. Yeah, but then you just did it. But you know it's, like, A 1 in 2,000 chance. It's a borderline miracle. Maybe it's meant to be. Maybe we should just embrace our destiny. When are you due? I have no idea. I'm going to call the doctor tomorrow. To be honest, I was just... I was so in shock I didn't even pay attention. But it could be good, right? Have another little monster running around. Morning. Delivery. Thank you. Why am I the last to know? Come on, carter. It's from Annie. You know we have to strategize a little bit. CARTER: Okay. [PHONE RINGING] ENZO: Uh-Huh. Finally you answer. What the fuck is going on? You sent me a baby gift? How did you know? And how did this happen? I mean, you said you used protection. ENZO: Those things rip sometimes, Annie. You were pretty wild. All it takes is a tiny, little hole. Nothing's foolproof. It's like 1 in 2,000? Where did you get that number? ENZO: Hey, for dinner tonight I picked up these organic baby artichokes. The twins'll love 'em 'cause you peel... You're fucking kidding me, right? You don't understand. You're no longer welcome in my house. ENZO: Don't stay that, Hayley. You have to leave him. Oh, Jesus, Enzo. I can't talk to you anymore. Do not call me again. Do you understand? Do you understand? ENZO: Yes. I understand. Hey, so I was just about to call you. The label flipped out over the new song. Annie, I screwed up. I fucked up really badly. ANNIE: Why? What's wrong? How long will it take you to get here? I'm turning the car around right now. I was just about to come over. Okay. I mean, I was just... I was torn up. You know, the critics were in my head. And I thought that I couldn't do any good work without jack. So you fucked Enzo to get your mojo back. I totally get it. It's okay. Yeah, I mean... I got inspired again. Because you're riding the beast. You've opened up Pandora's box And you're facing joy and horror head on. Sweetie, every single artist... They have affairs because it fuels their creativity. Look at woody Allen and Bruce Springsteen. And... Picasso. For god sakes, Picasso... Every time he had a new mistress, He started a new freaking art movement. I'm pregnant. [SPITS DRINK] Oh, shit. It's okay. It's not like you mowed down a deaf kid while texting. This is fixable. Um... you know you don't have to go through with it. I could talk to Enzo. I can be very discrete. Discrete? Annie, he's obsessed. I have to get him out of my life. He sent a bassinet to the house The day after I found out I was pregnant. I didn't even tell him. I mean, how does he know? You think he bugged my cell phone or something? Can you do that? I'm sure... I'm sure they have an app for that. He has no boundaries. We didn't even do a background check on him. Yeah, because we thought he was amazing. He is amazing. I mean, he's a genius. - And what genius isn't twisted? - Uh-Huh. I mean, my brother was a fucking nutbag. Maybe I'm being too paranoid. [SIGHS] I really thought that He was going to be the one to take us to the next level. I thought that too. I mean, you know, I've always wanted To headline Madison square garden. And... And score films And make a fucking opera on the moon. You know, I wanted to make really dangerous music. And I felt that with Enzo. You know, I was fierce, Teetering on the edge of something. Here. Oh, you're pregnant. Right. Okay. Okay. This is what we're going to do. [SIGHS] You're going to walk this edge for a little while longer. We lay down enough tracks to put together an album. And then if you still want me to, I cut the chord. Just like that? Pretty much. I'll call the lawyer tonight And I'll make sure that you're protected. And I'll spin off the dark prince. I'll get him his own deal. And he will be so busy with that, He won't have time to munch your box Let alone ruin your life. Yeah? I will meet with him tomorrow, give him some Annie rules, Turn him into a well-Behaved, willing mistress, okay? - Okay. - I'll be here for you. - Okay. Thank you. - Okay. - All right. - Thanks. I'm so sorry about Enzo. It's okay. - Uh... - Yeah. I told carter that you sent the bassinet. Okay. Shit. What? When I rolled up earlier And he was digging in the garden, He thanked me, then he mumbled something About being the last to know. And that's all that happened? That's all he said. But then I said, I had no idea what he was talking about. But it's fine. I... I can fix that. - Okay. - Okay. - Bye, thank you. - Bye. Uh, Camila, will you help me move this into the guest room? Yes. You can leave that right there. Uh, Annie, didn't know they were going to deliver it so quickly. That's why she was caught off guard When you asked her about it. Well, that's one way to explain it. - What do you mean? - Exactly what I said. But, hey, we're all just standing on a big rock Hurling through space. Did you put the whiskey in? A whole shot. Just like you showed me. Okay. I need it. I thought you couldn't have any more babies. You know what, bud? I think it would be better If your mom explained that to you. Well, it's complicated, buddy. But, um, Sometimes the doctors think that you can't have any more babies. You know, sometimes they make mistakes. And this time they were wrong. Um... yeah, no. Okay. You guys have a bit more food and you can have a cookie. What? Um... Annie, she... She drove off the side of Mulholland on her way home. They suspect foul play. And she said that she didn't make it. Well, I'm going to go to the hospital. You know, I said she's dead. And her sister's coming down from Berkeley tomorrow. You and Enzo can go over then. Are you leaving? Uh... sorry. Can I help you? Um, no. I think it's best if you leave, And I'll call you tomorrow. Yes, miss. Hey, guys. Uh... you guys go brush your teeth. And I'm going to meet you in the bathroom in a minute, okay? [WIND CHIMES] [DOOR SLAMS] Carter? You've been bad. Carter? [GASPS] Stop. Stop. I need to tell you something. You know, I interview real interesting characters all the time.

Oh, they wanted to travel abroad. I found the house on craigslist. I could not believe it when I saw the address. Our little fuck shack. Enzo, I have a husband, and I have children. Not for much longer. The husband part that is. What did you do? I chopped off the lime tree roots on this side of the fence. Made the tree lean over. Whoo. Carter got all worked up about it. Watch this. [IMITATES STRAINING] Ahh. Dug his own grave. Goochie goo. Oh, Hayley, don't feel too bad for him. I might've saved your life. I just heard him yelling at you. Yeah, you're right. He's an asshole when he's drunk. Could've just divorced him. Then I wouldn't have to go through with all this. But love makes you crazy. Right? Oh, check this out. A 1960s tube stereo. Mint condition. That's amazing. It's about the music. You've always wanted to headline the garden. Haven't you? Huh? [CODY AND BENJY TALKING] Oh, the place is a mess. I was going to hang some drapes. Here, don't... [KIDS CONTINUE TALKING] Cool, huh? These baby monitors have extraordinary range. Twins are fine. Yeah, they sound happy. I cannot wait to meet our little prodigy. So you can hear everything we're saying over there? Including your little conversation with Annie About how I have no boundaries. And you wanted to be rid of me. No. I just got freaked out, okay? I got freaked out. Then we went outside And we talked about it more. And I realized that I want to be with you. I want to create with you. I have to. Music is just a starting point, The genesis. That is cause for a drink. You sent that gift? Oh, yeah. I kind of liked that fan boy's style. So I carried it on after we got home. This is for you. Enzo, a martini? Bad daddy. Baby! It's okay. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. How about some oj? Well, I think I should probably get back to the kids. Don't worry. I've got it all covered. Oh, listen. I remixed "half of me." [MUSIC PLAYS] It's a duet now. I'm channeling jack. # baby, no, no, no # I'm right here # you are the seed # in ecstasy # you are the need # to feed inside you What's wrong? Are you okay? I...
