He is not there. He may have drunk and fall somewhere. No... He went in search of some Ayurvedic... ...medicine for Sarada and l haven't seen him yet. We can't predict his behavior. He will be there always, except in the time of emergency. l got remember now. Please tell him to clean the temple premises. He obeys only you. l will tell him when l see. Will Devan come for the festival? He will come. Last week he wrote me a letter that he will come for festival. What about this time? Why this bus is getting late? l am also thinking that. lt would have fallen into the ravine. You... l give the medicinal plants and also some river fish to the home. lt will taste better than tortoise. Did you hear? - What? Devan is coming for the festival. ls it? - Yes. Master... He is happy to hear about his friends arrival. You must clean the temple premises, the festival is coming. The bus has reached. "l gave leave for dreams today..." Come madam, come. -Yeah, careful. "l took a room in heaven..." Hey...Gavi girl. What? Don't misunderstand. Let me decide that, what is the matter? Lady...Your English is too bad. Pronunciations and grammar is very poor. Don't worry; l will take care of it. lf you don't tell anyone then l will tell you a truth. l am the one and only bus conductor in South lndia who knows English. Oh... - Yes. How much is the fare from Pathanamthitta to Gavi? What? - Tell me. Only 46 rupees. You learned English to give a ticket worth Rs.46? That is... lf you ask like this... My dear master... - Yes. l will survive with this little English; you mind your own business. - Okay. Kalyani...come. They are calling. Coming madam coming. Shall l go English man? Wasted a ticket. He write letter to his parents once in a year. But it is two letters a week for you! - Good. ls he have any job there? What is wrong with you, let her read that letter. - Sure. Venu master... Come, sit. l always think to come here with mother. Now l get the time. What to say, he is always busy. After the school time, he has work at the garden or with the cows. And l can't walk much alone. Get him married, you need company in this old age. l am fed up repeating the same thing. You carry on, l will bring the tea. No, Thanks. Actually we came for another thing. Today l saw Anna at church. He told me, she is your friend's daughter and her parents are not alive. Being frank if you don't mind will you gave Anna for my son. Mother is like this. You keep quite. You didn't replay anything... That is... She will be really happy there. l will look after her as my own daughter. Not because of that... lt is rare to find such a nice gay like Jose master. But... We have fix Anna's marriage with our son Devan. They are in love also. We are also happy with that. We decided to arrange their marriage in this festival season. Mother always makes proposals for me. You don't take it as serious. - lt's okay. Mother... it's getting late. Shall we go? - Okay. This is the first time you come here, and you don't have at least a tea. lt's ok, have it later. We are leaving... - Okay. Mother... Don't look at that side, she is already booked. l was just...Whether serious or not, i just said. - Okay. You told me that Anna is master's daughter, but... ...Bhargavan brother told that she is his friend's daughter. Even though, he considers her as his daughter itself. Where is master's son? He is working at Surat. He will come once in a year. l haven't seen him yet. Once when he comes on leave, at that time l was also in leave. So that was leave on leaves. Joke? - Yes it is. Chandran bother...Who is that? Chandran bother... Chandran bother...Chandran bother... Why are you smashing? We came to call brother Chadran. We paid him an advance for drama to entertain the tourists. They are shouting there. He might be somewhere with weeds. You don't worry, if you don't mind l will sing a song for them. Are you a singer? Latha...l have a skill for that. No... it is not easy to sing. l... What? Oh it is that... Yes that's it, what a headache. lt is better to take the foreigners to the cowshed than hearing your song. They can listen to the cows. You come here. A singer... l don't know what to do. How could you trust Chandran and promise to the foreigners? l don't think he will cheat like this. Hey Kalyani...Come on. They are calling. Go and tell them some excuse. "Everybody says Kalyani in my heart." "Black Kalyani in my heart." Conductor is singing! "When l touch, l understand it is a piece of sugar cane." "lt is a piece of jiggery." Come on Foreigner. Kalyani come, conductor is singing a song. Come Kalyani. "Everybody says Kalyani in my heart." "Kalyani in my heart." "Black Kalyani", "Black Kalyani" "Black Kalyani in my heart." "Black Kalyani in my heart." Oh my foreigner... "Like that everyone says." How is your tourist? Don't be afraid in such situations. l learned music very well. But have not yet learned to sing! Anybody can cheat the foreigners. Sing with me, you will learn a lesson. Don't tease me. Then you sing a song. - Yes l will sing. Come on man. "Come along me, you beautiful butterfly, to the magnolia boughs" "For crooning a tune with me!" "Come along me, you beautiful butterfly, to the magnolia boughs" "For crooning a tune with me!" "This is the month of spring..." "And the breeze which pilfers honey feels rather shy!" "Come along me, you beautiful butterfly, to the magnolia boughs" "For crooning a tune with me!" Are you feeling cold? - Yes. Then take this also. Go away. "Underneath....this flowery valley..." "As beautiful as a peacock" "Who creates this bewitching canopy?" "Underneath....this flowery valley" "As beautiful as a peacock" "Who creates this bewitching canopy?" "Lovely parrot! Who is going to marry you?" "ls that dove who chariots among the reeds?" "ls a tree of desires blooming?" "Only you and me saw it?" "Come along me, you beautiful butterfly, to the magnolia boughs" "For crooning a tune with me!"

Then why did you hide this? Don't you know it must be reported to police? Even he knows the rules very well. Sir...that...l... So it is not because that you don't know...? Tell me, did he died on the spot or you throw him alive into ravine? Sir, l already told you. He suddenly comes in front of the bus. He was plucking tea leaf at that time? Don't play drama. Then you tell me. Why did you kill him? Sir, that is... Why don't you saying? l don't know anything sir. You idiot...lie to me.. Reveal it. Otherwise l will make you tell. Don't beat him. He is innocent. You step back. Tell me... Tell me the truth. Sir don't hurt him, l did everything. When he was sick l drive the bus without listening him. Master's son id dead because of my fault. l wanted to hear this, l will ask him rest of the story. You can go now. Get lost. After killing him, what did you do with the rest of gold in his bag?
