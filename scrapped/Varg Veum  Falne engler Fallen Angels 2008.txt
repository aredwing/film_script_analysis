 

                        Ruth? Ruth? Are you home? Ruth? Ruth? Are you hungry? I'm preparing food, do you want some? Ruth! - No, this can't be right. - What? - Simon lives here. - Simon? Simon Follnes at Disturbance Patrol, a colleague. Of both of us. She's been living in a flatshare downtown. They hadn't seen her since yesterday. Preferred to be found by mum and dad, I guess. Simon... Simon. No! No! No! VARG VEUM FALLEN ANGELS Insurance fraud. In Poland. Varg? - Hey! - Hi! Haven't seen you in ages. - Are you doing okay? - Sure. And you? And your... Fine. Really great. I'm working a lot and... It's going really well for Jacob and the others. You haven't changed a bit. - Rebecca? - Coming! - Say hello to him, then. - I will. Jacob's band is playing at the Wharf tonight. Why don't you come? - I have to work. Perhaps another time? - You haven't changed much you either. - You came! - Yeah. Thank you all. This next song is about what we want, who we want, and how we want it. - He seems to be enjoying himself! - He looks great on stage. Remember the Jane's Addiction concert in London? Jacob was standing next to us. Then he turned towards us... - He goes like this: "See that...?" - "That's me in a few years." Look who's here, it's Derrick! Have we done anything wrong or what? Hello, Jacob. We must have done something wrong. You never show up when we invite you. - Great to see you, man! - Likewise. - What do you think? - You were great. Don't lie to me. I know it's not your sort of thing. Varg! Hello! Hi! Am I interrupting the male bonding, or what? - We're just talking about old times. - Will you come for a drink with us? Of course he will. Now we're really going to make up for lost time! Why don't you go on ahead, I'll just have a smoke with Varg. - What's next? Going on tour? - Yeah. - For how long? - Eight weeks. What does she say to that? She cheats on me. - Did she say so? - No, I just know. You just know? Or I think I know. That's the problem, really. And I can't take it any longer. I must know. - Forget it! - Isn't that what people like you do? What? People like me? Eh? Are you seeing someone special? Then you would've known what I'm going through. Hi! I haven't seen you for years, then all of a sudden twice in a week. Are you following me around or what? - Are you spying on me? - Rebecca... Damn you! - It's Jacob, isn't it? - I felt I owed it to him. I've done something stupid, I'm sorry. He can be very persuasive. But I just hadn't thought he would go this far. It looks a bit like he has his reasons. What do you know about relationships, Varg? Sometimes I just need to get away, and then I come here. Do you think you can take a snapshot or two, and then that should make it true? No, that was silly of me. Do you get paid per hour for this, or what? I remember you took a lot of pictures. Had known you for two weeks, and you started ordering us around. You made us pose at the churchyard with moody dark looks. You can do that when you're twenty and have been to a photo work shop. - Are these yours? - Yes, do you like them? Yes. You should make more like these. But I will have to shoot anorectic models for a few more years. Do you ever think about London? That things could have been different? It was a mistake. Rebecca... We don't even have to talk about it. You never think about me? - I have to go now. - So go then! Try to understand. You were my best friend's girlfriend. I'm sorry. That was totally out of line. Tell me about your life, then. It's not every day I receive the visit of a private investigator. Don't do this again. Rebecca, you're married to Jacob. It's not about that. Not any more. You're just afraid. Come on then! - Nothing? - Doesn't look promising. It seems he made sure to stay on the gravel. No traces. It's a nice house, huh? Great location and... What were you doing here exactly? I was on a job. She was the wife of a friend of mine. He suspected her of cheating on him. I thought you didn't do this sort of prying into people's sex lives? I just wanted to reassure him. That he was wrong. Was he wrong? And she was alone? What about the car? It was dark - black, no blue. Blue, I think. An estate car. All right. Are you coming inside with us? What was the last thing you saw? She was hanging in his arms like a rag doll. - He must have knocked her unconscious. - No signs of a fight. One would assume that she struggled before she was put up like that. The only thing I've found is this mark here. He must have attacked her from behind. The thumb here and the other fingers on the other side. Like this. - What is this here? - Some first drops of blood. It's from a mask. He drugged her first, but why? And the white dress? Was she wearing that earlier today? No. Did you see her change into the white dress? Have you spoken to Jacob? Her husband? He will be questioned in Oslo today. He's flying back tomorrow. They said you were the one who found her. Was she...? Nothing indicates she felt any pain, Jacob. This just can't be true. Hanged? What about... what I asked you to do? - Does that matter now? - It matters more than ever before. I saw nothing. Are you sure? So I had no reason to distrust her. - Do you want me to drive you anywhere? - I just want to get home. - The police are still working there... - I want to go home, Varg. I'm glad that you're here. Aren't you going to answer? Are you here on an official business? This is Ruth Follnes, the daughter of a colleague of mine. Until yesterday we assumed it was suicide. - Two identical murders? - For the moment, yes. One thing doesn't ring right. Rebecca had sex before she was killed. And Ruth didn't. Are we barking up the wrong tree trying to find a connection? Or is your statement inaccurate? - Rebecca wasn't alone. - Oh no? Who was with her then? I was. Now I'm here on official business. Are you the idiot or do you think I am one? - What happens now? - I'm just sitting here thinking. About...? Shall I charge you with giving a false statement? - Why don't you? - Its a quite common fantasy. What is? Charging people with giving a false statement? Sleeping with your best friend's wife. But unlike you, we have a little more self-discipline, don't we, Isachsen? - For how long has this been going on? - It's not the way you think, Hamre. Well, I'm waiting. We slept together many years ago, in London, after a night out drinking. It should never have happened. Since then we've hardly had any contact. - Not until yesterday? - Not until yesterday. A few glasses of wine and some old memories and the fire is rekindled? I didn't know you to be so passionate, Veum. Jacob has had a tough time lately. I wonder, would it be possible to... ...not mention this thing with his wife? Something like that. This is a murder investigation, Veum. I don't care about your sex life. So what if it wasn't sex? And it wasn't sadism? - What does he get from it then? - Are you asking me? I'm asking you. There's something with the way they are hanged. So white, clean and innocent. It's quite theatrical... As if he's trying to say something. Quite an unusual way of communicating, wouldn't you say? Killing might not be the main point. The murders might be the means to obtain what he really wants. And what does he really want? In any case he's addressing an audience. He's considerate towards his victims. A real gentleman, you might say. Do you know how he drugged them? With Rebecca it was gas, and with Ruth pills. Enough to knock out a horse. What kind of pills? Simon, you're on sick leave. Do you realize that? I want to do my bit. I don't think that's such a good idea. Go home to your wife. She's already back at work. Sitting staring at the wall doesn't make things any better. There's got to be something I can do? Talk to Syversen. But nothing related to the case. It was lithium. The pills, it was lithium. Supposed to relieve mood swings. - Have you seen this woman before? - Rebecca is here quite often. - She's here? In what way? - As a guest. She often spent the night here? About once a month, perhaps. Mostly at weekends. Alone, or what? She mostly comes alone. I've never seen her arrive with someone. There's been some talk about goings on in the corridors, but... I don't know. As far as I know, I don't think she has a boyfriend. How about this girl? Have you seen her and Rebecca together? No. What's the matter with her? Is she ill or something? Excuse me! Do you know a girl called Ruth who lived here in a flatshare? - Are you from the police? - No. - Then you must be a journalist? - No. So what is it you want then? I don't really have the time. I'm off to work. Why did she move out? It didn't work out. She was totally fucked up. - So finally we threw her out. - When was that? Three weeks ago. Do you know where she stayed after that? She's must have been sleeping around, I guess. What was her problem? - Are you sure you're not a cop? - Do I look like one? Here. You can just press "play". She stopped taking her medicine, I think. She said the pills made her fat. It seemed to me she was getting more and more spaced out. I even started feeling afraid of her. - Why did you film this? - To show her. I thought that maybe if she could see this, it would make her realize. Had she been diagnosed? Manic-depressive. She received treatment, which seemed to help. Or so the parents said. The friend said she stopped taking her medicine and got worse than ever. People described her as extremely destructive. Sexual self-mutilation. She was banned from several clubs. Went to bed with just anyone. What about the footprint? Find anything? - A standard army boot. - A very common kind of footwear. Yes, but it's damaged here - see that? On the outside the sole is worn flat. He stalks the victims beforehand. Which means they are carefully chosen and not picked at random. - Fallen angels. - Sorry? Like in the Bible. The fallen angels were thrown out of heaven. They were pure and elevated, but then they misused their free will. Tell me, have you joined a sect or something? What if the murderer sees himself as some kind of divine executioner. He sees it as his duty to kill women. Soiled, apostate, hence promiscuous women. - Was Ruth a prostitute? - In the eyes of the murderer. And Rebecca? Hi. Rebecca was a regular guest at Park Hotel. Do you know who I've been thinking of a lot? Eric Clapton. He lost his son and writes this just amazing song. I think it must have made it easier for him. I'm not able to work at all. Jacob. Did you know she stayed at that hotel? Sometimes she left, and sometimes I left. Isn't that the way it is in a relationship? You must have wondered what she was up to. People were talking at the hotel. Am I supposed to start doubting her now? You said it yourself, it doesn't matter. Rebecca is dead, and I'm a paranoid idiot. - We had a lot of fun, the three of us. - We did. Shall we go and have a beer or something? - No. - Only if you had the time, of course. Varg? Find the fucker who did it. Now we can welcome a popular guy, he has just released... There he is! Ladies and gentlemen, please give him a warm hand... Johnny Solheim! - Hello, Johnny. - Hi, daddy! - How are things? - Great! You're out now with your second album, "Good To Be Back". Why that title? Well, what happened was that I went to the States to record the album there. You were in Nashville, weren't you? ...came in as number one. - Mum, come on! - Yes, I'm coming. - Stine? - Yes. - Did you go into the garden? - No. Come then! But, Johnny, we've been told that you didn't come back from America alone... ...we must... watch this now - because Johnny bought an old Chevrolet 77. That's right, an lmpala. An lmpala. Wow, look at that. A reliable source tells me it has rust problems and cracked seats. What makes you buy such a car? Well, its a little piece of Nashville, isn't it? So it was like a love at first sight thing? I would rather picture you in a Ford Mustang or something. Hello? I have to be careful now so my wife doesn't lock me out of the house. You could always sleep in the car, there's enough room there. Best of luck to you! Johnny Solheim, ladies and gentlemen. Mum, you missed the whole thing! Mum? Mummy? Mummy? Stine! Stine! Stine...! Stine! Stine! Varg speaking. Your theory about fallen angels, that one we can just forget. Hamre called me. That's Johnny. Johnny? Johnny, you must come home. It's Stine. We have nothing, we know nothing. A ghost just passed through here. We still know several things about him. He's intelligent, well organized. He's got to do this. It's a mission he must accomplish while he still can. You don't say. This is still about guilt. The dresses, all the symbols. She was eight, Veum. The only thing she's guilty of is being born. You can go home. - Varg? - I've done something very stupid. - I've got to talk to you. - Now? In the middle of the night? - I have to get up early tomorrow. - I have to tell you something. - Could it wait until tomorrow? - Just forget it, Jacob. Varg! Wait. - I just felt so weird. - That's great, Jacob. You have no idea what I'm going through. I needed some company. I missed her so terribly. It's so damned sad. Sad? Do you want me to tell you what's sad? A eight year old girl killed in the same way as Rebecca. "Johnny Solheim's dead daughter." That is sad. Stine? - Do you know Johnny Solheim? - Yes, sure - we played together. - Before we got our breakthrough. - Did Johnny Solheim play in "Camp"? He was our guitarist for a short while. But it didn't work out. Ruth Follnes... Have you heard that name? No. Who's that? Yeah? - Hi, Hamre. Are you sleeping? - No. Who can sleep now? Johnny Solheim was a guitarist in Camp. Two out of three victims can be connected to the band. The real targets here are not the victims, but their relatives. The only thing Stine has made herself guilty of, is being born. She was killed in order to get to Johnny. What about Simon and Anita? Where is the connection there? I don't know, but there's has to be something. The next victim will be someone close to Harry or Arild. Okay. We will organize protection. All men will be armed. Hello. Are you quite sure this is safe? Trude has said she would rather stay home with the girls. The point here is to continue to live as normal as possible. You have to trust the boys. - Do you know anything more? - I'm afraid we don't. - Hi, Harry. How are things? - I don't know. This is just crazy. It is, isn't it? - Have you spoken to all the others? - No, not Johnny Solheim. The doctor gave him something to sleep on. He was in shock. - None of them knew Simon and Anita. - And what do Simon and Anita say? - They had hardly ever heard of... - Camp? - Hamre, everyone has heard of Camp. - No, Veum. Not everyone. Yes? Then Harry's parents at Kolbotn are taken care of. What about Arild? The mother's dead, no sisters or brothers. The father's in Brazil, he has been informed. - Otherwise he seems very single. - Everybody has someone. Hey there, Varg! You just disappeared last time I saw you. You got an SMS that seemed to make you happy? Is there something you haven't told me, Arild? Is she married? Underage? Is it a guy? Are you willing to risk her life just because of some silly secret? Her family is super-religious. She's shit scared of what they might do if... If they find out she's seeing me, they marry her off to some old sod. In the best of scenarios, see? Nobody knows about us, Varg. Have you seen her lately? Then he knows about you. What's her name? - Varg, I can't. I... - Come on, Arild. What's her name? - Noor. - And where is she now? She teaches adults at Fana secondary school. Evening classes. Call her. Call her, I'm going there now, okay? - Bye, see you! - See you later! - Hi, Arild! - I've been trying to reach you. - I had my mobile on silent. - Everything's okay? - Yes, shouldn't it be? - Do you have people around you? I think most of the others have left. What's going on, you sound so funny? The police think that the guy who killed Rebecca might come after you. They think that he hits the wives and girlfriends of us in the band. - But you haven't told anyone about us? - Come to my place right away. - Then we can talk about it. Love you. - Love you too. Hello? Noor? Anyone here? Noor! Noor! Arild, call her! Just do it, quick! Come on then! Come on, out of the way. - Is he armed? - I don't know. Armed patrol, we're unblocking the door. Confirm that message is received and understood. I repeat, we're unblocking the door. Confirm that message is received and understood. What are you doing here? I heard on the wire that you had caught him. Blocking removed. Come out with your arms over your head. I repeat: Come out with your arms over your head. - Hey! Put that gun down! - Simon, put the gun down. I'm counting to three. One - Simon! Two... Your arms over your head! Okay! Easy. Who are you? Who are you? She's dumb. She works here as a cleaner. - We've searched through the building. - Do it one more time. - At least that removes all doubt. - Yeah, it's the band he's after. And he wants an audience. It must be something he wants to take revenge for. Something they have done. What is it you haven't told us? Eh, Simon? - Are you talking to me? - Yes, I'm talking to you. He's killing in order to punish you, isn't he? - What have you done to deserve this? - What do you mean? Why do you rather let people get killed instead of talking about it? Veum, now you're going too far. - Susanne and Elisabeth, bedtime! - Is daddy getting a hug? I've spoken to the police for hours. I've told them everything I know. He's hit all the others, Harry. Next in line is Trude, or the girls. - We have 24 hours protection. - For the rest of your life? - No. - He will make it sooner or later. Are you protecting anyone? Or are you afraid of someone? - Is there money involved? - We didn't make any money back then. When, Harry? Before you made it big? Before Johnny left? Just tell me what happened. Why don't you rather talk to Jacob about this. You're pals. You know how he... manipulates people around him. Does he manipulate you? No, or I don't know. - But... I didn't want to... - What was it you didn't want? - What is it? - Nothing. Jacob Asen's here. He wants his wife's wedding ring returned. TRACES OF SEMEN, INTERCOURSE BEFORE DEATH You said she hadn't been the victim of a sexual assault. Well, and she hadn't. So what does this mean then? I was forced to have you suspended, Simon. I had no choice, I hope you understand that? What were you thinking of in there? I didn't think, I just snapped. You have of course been under a terrible strain. We will take that into account. Sorry. Before you made it big something happened that may explain the murders. Harry asked me to talk to you about it. Jacob? What is it that you're so afraid of? I've written a speech in Rebecca's honour. I wanted to for once give her all the credit she deserves. I want to thank her for being patient with me, but I just don't manage. Say what a wise, funny, whimsical, fantastic person she was. They're all sitting out there. Her mother, the whole family. This is what they need to hear. Not that you fucked her before she died. You didn't have the guts to make her yours when you could. But going behind my back is of course different. For how long? For how long, I said. Yeah? Do you know when he will wake up? At the earliest in a couple of hours. Perhaps not before tomorrow. - Have you prepared food? - Yes. Do you want some bread? Salad? She would have become just like you. Yes. Anita, there's something I have to tell you. - I have done things. - Simon! I know how much you loved her. But now we have to move on, you understand that? You're all I've got. Simon. You know that? Yes, I know. It's been three years, Simon! It's been three years. Do we have anything at all? It happened in an area out of the range of the surveillance cameras. - So he knew the place? - Or was just lucky? No, this killer is not counting on luck. This whole thing was executed according to a detailed plan. Hi! We're sitting here with the whole picture, but we don't see a shit! Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Is it you guys that are getting a lift with a patrol car? - The car is right over there. - Okay. THE BEGINNING Isachsen? It's me, Veum. I can't talk to you right now, he's taken the twins! - Shall we go? - This is totally insane. - Do you have a better idea, Harry? - We must go to the police! What do you think Trude will say then? He kills Stine and gets a couple of years in jail? No fucking way! - Are you only after revenge? - If I want revenge? A man sneaks into my house and kills my eight year old daughter. You can bet your ass that I want revenge. What do think will happen when he gets out? Has he forgotten you, you think? And your twins? He must be stopped. I've already spoken to the police. In the interrogation report it says that it was you who found her. It seems you were able to think pretty clearly. Do you know anything about knots? No. No. Because then you would have seen that this one here is totally wrong. All the other nooses were professionally made. But this here was made by someone who has no idea how they are made. The day you found her... She wasn't getting any better, was she? She wasn't taking her medicine because she believed the pills made her fat. Then one day she couldn't take it any more. She came back here. Took some pills, and killed herself. Simon blames the band for something. What had they done to her? Anita? What had they done to her? She worshiped him. The lead singer. Simon didn't allow her to go to their concerts. He was afraid. He works with these things and he knew what might happen. What happened? I was sitting here in the kitchen all night, waiting. While Simon drove around looking for her. At five in the morning he finally found her. In a bus shed. She was completely lethargic. Didn't say a word. Didn't reply to our questions. When she came home she just went straight upstairs and went to bed. In the end I managed to make her talk. She had stayed behind after the concert, with the guys in the band. They had given her some pills, and then they... They... All four of them. Grown men. She wasn't even fifteen. I promised her one thing. Not to say anything to her father. Not say anything to daddy. There has to be something else we can do? Jacob, you can't seriously mean that you want to do this? It's all my fault! If only I hadn't said anything, then perhaps... Anita, Anita... There are two children out there, two young children. I don't know anything. I can't help you. Hello, you've reached Jan Isachsen at Bergen Police Department. I cannot... Open the door and get in. It's just too bad, isn't it, Simon. You did everything you could to protect your daughter and yet it went wrong. It's not too late to turn back. Hamre is still alive. What happened? What on earth happened, Simon? Your daughter killed herself because you weren't there for her. Four grown men, one after the other. That's what killed her. Hey! Give it here! You heard me, give it here! Throw it here! Do you hear me! Throw it here! Here! Get out of the car! Now! He's got Varg. You prick! What do we do with Varg? We have no choice. We've got to take him too. What are you playing at? Jacob? Look at me. Are you going to kill me? How will you kill me then, Jacob? Make me get down on my knees and give me a shot in the back of my head? And how will you get rid of the bodies? You could bury us. But there will always be a dog coming along and dig out the whole shit again. - You could dump me in the sea, but... - I didn't ask for this. Some little girl four years ago. How can you avoid it? Stop raping fourteen-year-olds! It wasn't rape! Besides, how could we know she was fourteen? She was totally up for it. What do you think will happen if this gets out? I haven't deserved that. I haven't deserved any of this. What happens now? You regret so intensely what you've done that you'll blow your brains out. So what shall we do with Varg then? - No, Jacob, you can't... - Everybody will believe he did it. - Have you gone totally insane! - Can you shut the fuck up! Jacob... You do it. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Especially not if you want to see your daughters again. - Don't listen to him. - How's that? Have you checked your mobile lately? Go on, check your mobile! He's got the girls! Where are they then? They're alive. But not for much longer if you shoot me. If he had them he would've already killed them long ago. I forgot the dresses. Tell me where they are! Tell me! Now! Otherwise you will shoot me? Or what! Tell me where they are! Harry! Harry, I shall find your daughters. The next will hit your thigh, so tell me where they are! All right, all right. Come here, and I'll tell you. I'll whisper it to you. - Don't listen to him. - Shut up, will you! Come here. - What? - What's he saying? You can do whatever you want with me, it's the only way. Harry. Harry? - What are you doing? - Ruth was deeply in love with you. I said we should go to the police, but you wouldn't listen. - Why do you never listen to me? - Harry, drop it. - Harry! I know where your girls are. - Tell me then. I'm the only one who knows where they are. - There's only one place they can be. - So tell me then! - Call the police, then I'll tell you. - Do as I say, or they will die. Who do you trust here, Harry? Him or me? - Shoot Jacob! - Him or me? - Shoot Jacob. Shoot Jacob! - Harry! Don't do it! I shall find your girls. - So where are they? - I don't know. I was bluffing. - What?! - I had to. It must be possible somehow to reconstruct the route he followed. From toll road receipts or something. We're talking about two young girls. He can't have taken them just anywhere. There was something about his reaction. He actually believed that I knew. - Why did he believe that? - Because it was so obvious?
