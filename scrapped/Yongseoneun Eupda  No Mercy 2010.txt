A Picture byCinema Service and The Dream Pictures Co-produced byLime E&S iKorea Export Insurance Corporation Executive Producer KANG Woo-seok SUL Kyoung-gu RYOO Seung-bum Hey! l said, up on my signal, idiot! The point was the flutter right before the sunrise. l'm sorry l got nervous. The weather was perfect today... Now we have to come back tomorrow! lt takes sweat to get a masterpiece, right? Forget it... Let's get out of here. - Oh, come on... - Why did l bring him along? Hey, did l want to be here? You dragged me out here! For God's sake! Now what?! Written and Directed by Kim Hyoung-jun NO MERCY So, she died from over-excitement during intercourse? A death in the saddle? ln so-called 'sweet death,' C.O.D. is usually heart attack for men and cerebral hemorrhage, for women. That's why some say that men takes in sex through their hearts and women through their brains... l'll leave it to yourjudgment. But the autopsy showed no sign of cerebral hemorrhage. She was anaphylactic to penicillin. You mean antibiotics? But, that's used everywhere... For an anaphylactic, even a small dose of penicillin could be fatal. The husband takes out a lucrative insurance policy for his wife... and visits the hospital to get an injection for a fake sore throat, comes home and has sex with his wife. A trace of antibiotic in the husband's semen is passed into the wife's body. This small hospital receipt played a crucial role in catching a murderer. lt looks like you did, sir. Are you really going to leave? Stay for another semester. l'm sorry but l want to move on and live with my daughter. l'm tired of living with bodies. So it is for Hye-won... lt's fortunate that we have experts on Gaucher's disease in the country now. Hey, isn't she coming in today? She is being delayed by a few days. Doesn't she know how much her dad misses her? Hang on... Kang speaking. l'll be on my way. My mother would flip if she found out what l do at work... What an atrocity in a countryside like this? She's chopped up pretty good. The hell with a day-off... Just my luck, eh? Hey... Why should l get socks for him? What am l, a personal assistant? What's her problem? Oi! Min! Yes, sir! Are you setting up the line or what?! People are coming across, idiot! Yes, sir! Hey, get out of there! Come on, out! Get behind the damn line! Hey, you! Mister! You, over there! Where do you think you're going? Are you out of your mind?! Are you all right? l am so sorry... Professor... Huh? Do l know you? Class 21 of Police Academy, sir. l took your psychology classes. The horn-rim glasses who came to my house for questions? Yes, the horn-rim glasses... You're right. l didn't recognize you without the glasses. lt's been over 5 years and l never graduated... but you still remembered me! l'm honored, sir. - Hey, doc! - Hello. lf you're done talking, get back to yourjob! What an atrocity in a quiet countryside... This way, professor. Thank you. Do your goddamn job instead of knocking people off their feet! The victim's name is Oh Eun-ah. She has been reported missing. What a beautiful body. Pink nipples, a deep naval and perfectly shaped pubic hair... lt's upsetting to think that such a beautiful body will rot away. The perpetrator rearranged the dismembered parts... back into the positions before they were mutilated. Well, except for one arm. What a psycho! Why go through the trouble of chopping it up in the first place? What do you think the crime scene and the body are telling you? Pardon? Me...? Yeah. Well, if the killer placed the body in a location like that... Maybe it wasn't his intention to hide it. You're over-complicating the matter. Dismembering a body is usually grudge-related... lnvestigate the people around the victim and it's game-over. l'll bet it's a crime of passion or grudge-related. Why would a robber want to mutilate the body, huh? Continue... lf l were the killer, l would've gotten rid of the fingers and dumped the head elsewhere in order to impede identification process. But, why is only one arm is missing? The missing arm, he could have misplaced it. You can easily make mistakes when you're nervous. Especially when it's not a couple of pieces but six. lt's definitely possible. lt's not slices of pizza we're talking about... Let's get started. Come on. Let's give the man some room. Detective Min can stay. ls that okay with you, Chief? Of course... Let's get out of here. A dead body is no longer a person. lt's evidence. The C.O.D. is brain damage from fractured skull. Soil containing granite was found inside the nostrils, mouth and ears. And, trace of salt was found all over the body. lt appears the killer dismembered the body by the sea in order to avoid cleaning up the blood and dumped the body parts near the mouth of the river. The weapon used is likely to be a long and hard object. Most damage was done near the crown of the head. ln order to deliver a blow directly perpendicular to the crown, the killer was either over 6 ft 6 or... he struck his victim while she was kneeling down. She was struck right on the head. But if her face hit the flat ground, there is little chance that soil gets into the mouth or the ears. Therefore, l believe she was murdered where there are mounds of granite soil. ls there such place in the town? Granite soil can be found in a cement factory. ll-seong Concrete, Ltd... Because of the Coastal Reclamation Project, there are tons of such factories at the seafront of Kunsan. So, the killer murdered the victim at a cement factory, dismembered the body by the sea and dumped it near the river bank. What about the suspects? The victim had a boy friend. We haven't been able to locate him. Find him! The rest, split into 4 units and dig up every single cement factories. Hey, Byung-do... Who the fuck...? A cop, you asshole! Heads to the floor! Now! So, you saw him yesterday? At the Chung-ang junction. Down the road... Be precise, asshole! At the junction... Turn right at the second traffic lights. Hey, Byung-do! What the fuck?! We're working round the clock in How could a murder take place here? lsn't there a point in time where the factory stops running? Did you hear what l just said? Those trucks come in without a pause of a second. - Easy, boys! - This is like a fucking desert. Detectives! Do something about the protesters, instead of hassling us. They don't seem to run out of the energy. Save the estuary! Protect locals' livelihood! What's going on? Out of the way! Be quiet! This isn't a fucking market place! Hey, Byung-do... Let's have a heart-to-heart conversation, you and me. You whacked her because you couldn't pay back her money, right? What are you talking about? l haven't seen her in a month. l'll show you how you can screw yourself. Where were you on the night of 15th? l was feeding the horses. l said where?! What the f...?! Trying to kill me with a stare, you little fuck? Fucking bastard! Take a seat, asshole! Now! God damn it! l told you we don't know either! You're wasting our time and labor. Do you have any idea how you're costing me by the second? The Iock's broken. Reach underneath the door... There's string. PuII it and the door wiII open. There you go. Come here. Hello, gorgeous! That's my daughter. ls she still studying in the States? How did you know that? You told me when l came by your house 5 years ago... l remember it clearly. You have a good memory. She is so beautiful. She's coming back tomorrow for good. After 13 years. You must be thrilled. You have the crime scene pictures? We found the arm in a granite mound. lsn't that weird that the killer only left one arm there? The killer murders his victim at the factory, dismembers the body in the tideland... then, goes all the way to the estuary while leaving one arm at the murder scene. l think the killer wanted to say something about the 3 locations. There's got to be a commonality. A commonality? Perhaps, a message for us. A message? Environmental activists... protesting for tearing down of the embankment... ll-seong Concrete, Ltd... the sole supplier for the embankment construction. They say that motiveless crimes are on the rise... But, l simply don't believe that. Fundamentally, there is no crime without a motive. Remember to consider all the possibilities. There is always a motive for a murder. Hey, probie! The ink on your record card still hasn't dried. l admire your enthusiasm but it takes more than enthusiasm. The granny in the canteen has enthusiasm, too. - Chief! - What... You can't let a probie present a high-profile case like this. l did a good preparation. Detective Min. Yes, sir. You ready for the presentation? Yes, sir. Don't let your nerves get you. Be articulate. Come on, Chief! Well. you got nothing out of your suspect! l'm still working on him... Let's get rolling. The environmental group ''l love Venus'' has been systematically impeding ''ll-seong Concrete's'' production while continuing with their daily protests at the seafront. They are particularly concerned with issues relating to River Keum. Venus? Like the bra company? Quiet! This is a book written by the group's leader, Lee Seong-ho. 'River Keum is a reincarnation of Venus, the goddess of beauty.' 'But the government built an embankment at the at estuary severing her waist in half and they chopped off her legs with Coastal Reclamation Project.' 'Now with the Grand Waterway Project, They're building 3 lock gates and 1 dam.' 'Now the river is cut into 6 pieces.' 'Divine goddess, forgive the barbarity of the fools who is tearing your beautiful body into 6 pieces.' 'l am planning to punish them for their foolishness.' That's a touching story! Venus... my ass! What the hell's the matter with you? So, ''ll-seong Concrete,'' tideland and the River Keum estuary... Yes, sir. The Venus and dismembering of the body over these 3 locations. The killer is a lunatic environmental activist. That's correct, sir. But, your claims are circumstantial and none factual. On the day of the murder, there was a confrontation between the workers and the environmentalists at the factory and the factory stopped operation for 20 minutes, leaving enough time for murder. This is the leader of ''l love Venus,'' Lee Seong-ho. Lee suffered from polio and has a class-4 disability. So, the twisted foot print and the hole represent... The affected leg and the walking stick, sir. Bring him in for violation of mass demonstration law and question him! Pardon? - 5cm apart is good. - Okay. Don't worry about the damaged ones. - Okay. - Like this. Somebody had a drink or two. Lee Seong-ho? Who are you? - Well, l... - The police, sir. We have some questions for you. What the f...?! You're here to arrest me. l have to pay for what l did. The environment is on loan for our use from the future generation. ls it a crime to try to protect it. You're not being questioned for violation of demonstration law. Oh, you said l was a murder suspect. Did you just laugh? You must think this is funny. l'll show you how you can screw yourself! River Keum is as beautiful as the goddess herself. lt provides a habitat for thousands of migratory birds. Coilia fish swim back up from the sea to lay eggs in it. So l call the mouth of the river the womb of Venus. Cut the crap about womb. Are you lecturing me? l don't care about Venus or her womb. Just tell me if you killed her or not. What the...?! Because of the embankment, the locals couldn't get their boats out and subsequently, lost their livelihood and left their homes. And, the estuary died out, too. Detective, you have interests in environmental issues. l learned from your book. l supposed your family had to leave, too. What the hell are you on about? Hello? You want to get some coffee? What was that about? Let's give the girl a chance. Come on, Chief! Shortly after losing his livelihood to the embankment, your father died and your sister took her own life. What does my family's tragedy have anything to do with this case? Doctor Kang? Yes? Lee Seong-ho asked me to give this to you. Lee Seong-ho? Hey... So-hee! l'm sorry. Dad, I'm arriving on Thursday instead. Renunciation procedure is taking Ionger than I thought. Your hatred for the embankment and obsession over River Keum... lead to staging a dramatic performance of murder and mutilation of the body. Detective, that book isn't a crime novel. lt's like saying all authors of crime novels are criminals. Mr. Lee, it was a fine and dry day, today. l'm sorry for soiling your shoes and cane. l sprayed some water at the entrance. Your foot print matches the print we found at the crime scene even the position of the cane matches. What's your name, Detective? Min Seo-young. Min Seo-young. Detective Min. You have something on yourjacket. Well done. That was impressive. You got yourself a killer. Yes. Professor! We got the kiIIer! It was a young environment activist caIIed Lee Seong-ho. I wanted to Iet you know before anybody. HeIIo? Professor? Kang Hye-won...? She arrived in the country Iast week. l'm not feeling pretty right now. Let's get this done and over with. You said you sawed off the limbs. Who helped you? Why do you keep staring at the clock? You have to be somewhere? Look at me! You, crazy bastard! Professor, what brings you here? Where is Lee Seong-ho? Pardon? l heard you got the killer. ln the questioning room. He is still being questioned. ls he trying to pierce the clock with a stare? Detective Yoon! What's up? l heard you got the killer. Can l see him for a second? Will you get a confession out of him? l have some facts to confirm with him. He's a total nut case. He confessed to sawing off the limbs... and now he's just staring at the goddamn clock. We have our men out looking for the instrument. When we find it, he's a dead meat. l won't be a moment. What the...?! What the hell are you doing? Why did you lock the door? Open up! Now! Are you listening to me? Hello. What took you so long? We lost the whole day. You didn't have to go to the airport. Where is my daughter? Let's have a talk about that. Who the hell are you? l don't see why that's important. lt's your daughter's life that's important. What do you want? Cutting to the chase, are we? l gave some thought to killing and mutilating Oh's body so that people will think about the meaning behind it. But, that wasn't very effective. So l thought... if l murdered and cut up Korea's top medical examiner's daughter... Bastard! l'll kill you if anything happens to my daughter! l'm not... finished... Listen to me carefully. l want to make a deal with you. What? Get me out of here in 3 days. Then, the victim of the second murder will no longer be your daughter. Do you think it's possible? - What if it isn't? - But, you confessed! You're right, l did. The police are out to recover the evidence. When they do, you're finished. So will your daughter be. You know why people get weak? lt's because they have something to lose. Who the hell are you? Do you know me? l know you well. You do? Don't give too much thought to my words. What to do, what to do... The clock is ticking. Your daughter grew up to be quite a lady. Didn't you hear me banging on the door? Are you ignoring me? Professor, You're back! Did you find the instrument of crime? lt was an electric saw. lt was where Lee said he left it. lt had trace of blood on it. lt's gotta be it. Where is it? ln the lab. Didn't you say your daughter was coming back today? She's being delayed by a few days. Professor! Hey, what brings you here? l heard they found the instrument of crime. Oh, that... lt's right here. l'm gonna finish what l'm working on first. l know it's urgent... but, like other babies it has to wait for its turn. Where is Dr. Kang now? ln the autopsy room, l think. That professor of yours requested for a psychiatric evaluation on the nutcase. A psychiatric evaluation? He must be going out of his mind... He's playing a cop now questioning the suspect... lt's game-over once the evidence is processed. Why would he do that? You have his autopsy report? Not yet. Are you out of your senses?! What about the blood result? They said it'd be ready by tomorrow. You're kidding, right?! You gotta twist their arms if you want any work done! They won'tjust deliver it over to you like a damn pizza! Go make some coffee. l'd be better off if she didn't talk at all... Yes, bro... Pardon? ln the autopsy room? Now? Well... all right. l'll be right over. Professor! Detective! What brings you here at this hour? Shouldn't you be busy? l said it was urgent. Professor Kang wanted to see me. What are you doing here? l'm here for your autopsy report. Why are you sweating so much? Do we have the result on the blood sample? l was about to start. We'll have it by dawn. ls that why you called me over? l'd better hurry back. Did you request a psychiatric evaluation on Lee? Let's have a word. l saw Lee briefly, earlier on. lt appeared he could barely walk without the help of a cane. l just can't see how such a man could commit the crime. Are you suggesting that he may not be our killer? Maybe we're relying too much on what we see. And l, depended too much on the autopsy result. But, he gave a confession and we recovered the evidence. He put the body on display and gave out a confession. lsn't that almost too easy? l suspect there may be a pitfall. But, we're requesting for a warrant in the morning. l'd better double check my report before it's too late. You'd better consider all possibilities and go over the facts again. l never broke a regulation in my 20 years in the force. l appreciate that. l have to talk to my daughter. Call her. l'm sorry but it's not possible. Call her now! lt's me. ls she okay? There's someone here who wants to talk to her. He's being such a pain. You think you can kill her now? Where are you?! l'll have you killed if anything happened to her! pIease... The number you have diaIed cannot be recognized... l will... kill you. Hello? Dad? Baby, where are you? Are you all right? Dad, I think this man is trying to kiII me. HeIp me! No, baby! Don't you worry. Daddy will come and get you. Hang in there, sweetheart. Hello! Hello! How can l believe that you'll let her go if l set you free? Do you have any other choice? Where is the murder weapon? l don't remember. You gotta help me help you. You must have taken care of the saw. You're better than l thought, doc! Just answer my question. Where is the murder weapon? You seem to be more confident about tampering with the evidence. Talk to me! People's memory is a funny little thing. Cut the crap! Well, the important thing is why did l kill that girl? What? Refresh your memory. Are you really a cop? You don't look like one. Just tell me what you know. Do you know this man? l don't think so. Do you any man that Oh Eun-ah used to hang out with? There wasn't any. Except for that Byung-do bastard. Min Byung-do? Was he her lover? A lover, my ass! He is a complete asshole. Where can l meet him? l don't know. He must be feeling horses somewhere. Feeding horses? You know, the screen betting shops. Are you sure you're a cop? Hey, Detective! You stayed here all night keeping an eye on me? Do we have the result? Yes. Only that all that effort went down the drain. What?! You haven't finished? l have. Only that... it wasn't human blood. What do you mean the blood didn't belong to human? He fucked us around. l thought it was weird that he gave out to the probie. All we needed was one piece of evidence! What did you do to his face? lt wasn't me. Who did that? Find the evidence! lt's the top priority. Split into 3 team and search the factory and Lee's house. Find anything you can. What are we looking for anyway? Let's be simple. Go to Lee's house and bring in any sharp objects or tools that may have been used as weapon. There's gotta be something. Hey, Min! Yes, sir. You stay here and get the autopsy report. But, finding evidence is more important. l told you to get the report ages ago! He likes you. Go get it now. Even if we have the evidence, we need the report for the warrant. Detective Min? Professor, where are you? I need your report. l called in sick. l wasn't feeling too well. The report isn't ready yet. ls it urgent? I don't know... As you suspected, the test resuIt wasn't good. It was dog's bIood they found on the saw. Chief went berserk teIIing everyone to bring back the murder weapon. The murder weapon? Yeah. The assauIt weapon that struck Oh. When are you coming in? ShaII I drop by your house? HeIIo? Professor? Professor! Hey, sweetie. How have you been? What happened to you? Lee Seong-ho asked me to give this to you. Don't miss out a single detail. Yes, sir. Go. What's with the mess? There's a scalpel. Over here, sir! - Where? - Come on! Hurry! There is a trace of blood... and the size and shape looks about right. The punk left it out in the open. No wonder we couldn't find it. Come on. Let's go back. Okay. Let's go. Did she get poked by something? lt's a cut. A cut? lt's not an ordinary knife but something sharp like a scalpel. The wound is on an awkward place. Maybe it was inflicted on purpose. l'm sending it over now. Please look into the man. Did l ever ask for a favor before? Yeah, it's urgent. Excuse me, sir. What are you doing now? You put it in the wrong way. You should put it face down. lsn't that Seong-ho and Pyeong-sik? His name is Pyeong-sik. I knew him weII. He was an orphan but Seong-ho's father took him in and raised him as his own. He and Su-jin were Iovers... But, after she died, both Seong-ho and Pyeong-sik Ieft the viIIage. High schooI girI gang-raped! Victim kiIIs herself Defendants are from weII-do-to famiIies SchooI-girI rape: defendants waIk free Park Pyeong-sik! Park Pyeong-sik! Where is my daughter, you bastard! My daughter... Where... where is she? You want your daughter back? Do you? Then follow the rules. l don't like this any more than you do! Hye-won! Baby! Wake up! Hye-won! Hye-won! Hye-won! A possible murder weapon was recovered from Lee's house yesterday. Based on the lab result, we'll proceed with the request for warrant. ls it true that Lee committed the crime as part of his environmental protests? ls it related to the Grand Waterway Project? That'll be all for today. Once we have the warrant tomorrow, this case is closed. Oi, Min! Yes, sir. Do you have the coroner's report? Not yet... He could not be reached. Are you kidding me? What in God's name...?! How difficult can it be obtaining a piece of paper? lf you don't get it by tomorrow We can't get the warrant. And, drop this in the lab, too. Yes, sir. Was Lee a medical student? Why did he have a scalpel in the house? He is a lunatic. That's why. Something as sharp as a scalpel. lt wasn't human blood. You didn't leave the room even for a moment? l told you l didn't. Not in the last 3 days. Please think again. This is really important. That's right. l went to the autopsy room when Dr. Kang called me. You were there, too. What happened to your face? Why did you go around asking for trouble? ls it because of the trial? ls that why you killed Oh Eun-ah? l remembered who you are. My testimony was true to my findings from autopsy. Doc, you're going around in circles when you have so much to do. They recovered the murder weapon. The murder weapon? l did everything that l could. There is nothing more l can do. lt's all my fault. Please let my daughter go. But, l'll still go to jail... You could have told me where you kept the murder weapon. What can l do now? lt's up to you to figure out. Letting me out is yourjob, not mine. ls that how much you care about your daughter? What can we do now? The time has almost run out... Son of a bitch! When this is over, l'll kill you with my own hands. lt doesn't matter. This is not it, either. What? The blood type doesn't match. Oh was type-O but this is B. God damn it! That wacko must have killed another one. ls he a serial killer? Look. The thickness doesn't match either. lt looks good enough to me. Does it have to be an exact match? What are you gonna do about the press statement? Find a weapon that's an exact match to this! Pardon me? Make one if you have to! We know he is our guy. We gotta nail him down somehow! hat can l do now? We have your confession and evidence. You still don't get it, do you? Maybe you aren't as smart as l thought. l'll ask you one more time. Why... did l... kill Oh Eun-ah? She was such an easy girl. Easy with her body, a loud mouth... even with her heart. Don't you get it? Do what you're good at. Wait! Where are you going? l'm busy today. Let's talk some other time. Did you meet Lee again? l said l was busy. Why did you tamper with the evidence? What is happening to you? Tell me! Just give me a little more time. l don't have much time now. l'll explain everything later. Just let me go. You are under arrest for obstruction ofjustice. - You have the right to remain silent... - My daughter's been kidnapped. Excuse me? lf Lee is indicted, l'll never see her again. But, why...? Please. You have to trust me. Defendents: Choi DW, Lee YJ, Moon YM. PIaintiff: Lee Seong-chan Victim : Lee Soo-jon Lee Seong-chan... Lee Soo-jin... Father, Lee Seong-chan... Sister, Lee Soo-jin... Lee Soo-jin was his sister? That's really not possible. lt's a Class A-security file. Not many peopIe have access to it. Come on, for old time's sake... l don't have the authority. l could go to jail for this. lt is really important. l beg you! Please? The case you asked about... was a gang rape case of a school girl. Defendants were kids from powerfuI famiIies and they were released on grounds of insufficient evidence. Witnesses incIuded Oh Eun-ah... What?! Oh Eun-ah was the witness? And Prof. Kang who was the coroner... What brings you here? What are you doing to Prof. Kang? What are you talking about? Where is his daughter? ls it because of the trial? ls that what the professor said? You think they walked because of Dr. Kang's testimony? Don't talk about things you don't know. He gave a testimony based on his findings. lt wasn't his fault. This won't bring your sister back from dead. Hello? Mr. Detective! What do you think of Prof. Kang? l admire him. You admire him, do you? Do you know what kind of man he is? l know him better than you do, at least. And, he thinks the same of you, too... right? Where is Hye-won? You know what? You can try to forget your past but you can never erase it. What you're doing now will never be forgiven. ls this what you're looking for? ls it a match? lt's a precise match. So, it's been right under our noses all along? Lee gave out the murder weapon and it matches the wound. lf you file for a warrant now, we'll get it in time. Good job, Detective Min. Hello? You are a curious cat, aren't you? Who is this? I'II teII you what Dr. Kang is up to. Wait... Damn! This is all l could get. He must have kept himself busy at night. Good job. l didn't do this for money. You will avenge Eun-ah's death? Yeah. For good. l'd like that. What's in the bottle? Professor! Detective! Detective! You want to help her? You bastard! She was getting in the way so l thought l'd give you a hand. We're running out of time, doctor. What have we got? Lee says he'll tell us everything. He's already given a confession. lt must be his last attempt at getting away. We have the murder weapon. There is no way. What?! What did you just say? I toId her we shouId go home but Su-jin said she wouId stay Ionger with the boys... l came home alone. l paged her over and over again but she didn't call so l went back and found her on the beach with the boys... lt looked like she was having a good time. Don't lie! My baby would never do that! Please tell the truth. Lastly, we would like to call Dr. Kang to the witness stand. lf a relatively inexperienced teenage girl engaged in a forceful intercourse with multiple partners the inside tissue would be badly damaged. No such signs were found in the victim's vagina. The state of the victim's vagina suggests that she had a normal intercourse at best. ls it safe to assume that the sex was consensual? l cannot be 100/ conclusive but it appears to be a case of fornication than a rape. Based on the eye-witness account and the coroner's testimony, the court finds the defendants not guilty. l didn't kill Oh Eun-ah. Have you lost your mind? What are you saying?! My client was investigated under duress. He gave a false confession after being physically assaulted. Do you even know what duress means? We have the murder weapon. Your walking stick. Listen to me carefully. They all know that you're the killer. They just don't have the supporting evidence. So what? Give this to the police. They'll do whatever to come up with evidence that will tie you to the murder. But, if they have this then that's a different story. So, while they hang onto this, you'll get me out. Overturn your statement at 7am tomorrow. And, when they mention your walking stick as evidence... l'm not the only one who uses a walking stick like that. Did you find any evidence on the cane that links to the murder? What?! Who else walks on three other than you? There is no direct evidence to suggest that you're the killer. Didn't they find my foot prints? Where they recovered the body is less than 1 km from where you lived. There is a more than enough chance you could have been there. Again, it falls short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. What other evidences do you have that connects to me the murder? Dr. Kang said that even my foot prints couldn't be sufficient evidence. You are the killer, motherfucker! Even if you are not! There seems to be signs of duress, on top of insufficient evidence. Should we take this to court? Ourjob is to find evidences. The judge will make his judgment as to whether you're guilty or not. What now? What do you mean Lee is not the killer? Dr. Kang sent me his autopsy report this morning. What? He found a trace of semen inside the victim's vagina and a finger print which he missed out in his initial autopsy. What does that mean? He said there was no evidence of rape... Even if there was semen, doesn't it belong to Lee? The blood-type of the semen's donor is the rare RH-A type. lt's not a match to Lee's blood type. And the finger print doesn't belong to Lee, either. This tracks back to Min Byung-do. God damn it. What's the matter with the doc? We have no grounds to hold Lee in custody. Let him go and have the other man brought in for questioning. Min Byung-do! You are under arrest for the murder of Oh Eun-ah. - Don't move! - Shit! Let go! Let go! Fucking bastard! Son of bitch! Good to see you. Where are we headed? Let's go home first. We're expecting a guest. Look at you. Here is what you asked for. Thanks! There were two autopsy reports on the case, though... The one that was used in the trial said the sex was consensual... whereas the other said the body was too badly damaged to determine this. Are you saying that Professor purged on the stand? That case had problems from the beginning. The kids' parents were powerful people. The trial was a puppet show. l'm sure the witnesses were bought up. l found something else, too. The 3 defendants... they all died. Choi Dae-wook and Lee Young-je died from car accident in Jan 2003. And the third one got killed in a club. lt's a cold case. Now that Oh Eun-ah is dead, it's the professor's turn...? Doctor, your plan worked out. The timing was perfect, too. Where is my daughter? Detective Min seemed to think so highly of you. She must be so disappointed after founding out the truth about you. Where is my daughter?! Was that the only way? How could you do it again? Was it easier the second time? l did everything you told me to do. Where is my daughter? Did you hurt your hand? Be careful. l'm sorry about your sister, too. Do you? l mean it. l really do. So, please... don't do this. Why did you do it, man? Pardon? Lee Seong-ho was released? Are you serious? Prof. Kang is in danger. Dispatch a unit now. What the fuck do you mean where to? To Lee's house! Yeah, l swore. Fuck! So what! My family's misfortune came with the construction of embankment. She said, ''Fuck, so what?!'' To me! Step on it, punk. That little bitch will be sorry. Easy, man. Fuck, so what?! Huh? Was it really an honest testimony? My sister, a whore! You really believed that?! My testimony was based on scientific analysis... You think my sister was having a good time with them? A scientific analysis? The hell with that! Hye-won! Stay awake honey! Stay awake! Hye-won. Hye-won... lt's Gaucher's disease. lt's how her mother's bleeding never stopped while giving birth. The condition is genetic. lt's so rare that the only experts are in the States. She is all you should think about. But, l can't... How else will you pay for the bi-weekly bone marrow transplant? They'll provide you with means to look after her. But, l can't do that. lnside of the victim's vagina is clean. Her body has been in the sea for too long for me to be conclusive. Well, there is no conclusive evidence of rape, either. That's right, too... but... You tell them the facts you found out. Just keep from saying uncertainties like that the body had been in water for too long. Are you Prof. Kang? Who are you? My daughter Su-jin... She is not a girl like that. Please tell the truth about my daughter. She would never do anything like that. l only provide facts that l found out from scientific analysis. Please, sir... Don't let my daughter die twice. Please tell the truth. l beg you. l'm sorry. l'm so sorry. lt's me who did wrong. So, please... l trusted you. You should have told the truth. Kill me. l beg you, please! Shred me into pieces. But, my little girl... She has nothing to do with any of this. What you said made my sister a whore. People pointed condemning fingers at her. And, me! Hatred started growing. Every night, when l had dreams about her, l thought of you. l'm so sorry. lt's all my fault. Hye-won didn't have an easy life. Please don't touch her. Please let her go, please! Hatred began spreading all over my body like cancer. And, l couldn't help myself. l hear you. lt's all my fault. Stop it, now. Please let her go. But, it's too late now. Son of a bitch! You fucked me around?! Motherfucker! Motherfucker! Come on! Where is my daughter?! Motherfucker! Motherfucker! Let's go to her, now. Please let her go, please! Please... Grab it! Grab it now! Let's go! Now! Fuck you, motherfucker! Pick up the cane. Let's go! Stop it. l'll tell you. So, stop it. lsn't that Prof. Kang's car? What the f...?! What's he doing? She is waiting for you at a house near the embankment. In the house we abandoned when the embankment was buiIt 13 years ago. This was his revenge. Don't go inside, professor! Where is Hye-won? Lee planned out everything. - Where is my daughter? - Don't go inside! - Dad's here, honey. - Professor! Hye-won? Hye-won... Baby... Daddy came for you. Let's go home now. You can't be here.... You can't be here. l'm sorry baby l took so long. Come home with daddy, now. Hye-won... Let's go home, baby. Wake up! Hye-won! My baby! Where is she? My baby! Where...?! Hye-won? Hye-won?! Hye-won! My baby! Pink nipples, a deep naval and perfectly shaped public hair... Where is my girl?! My baby! My baby... My daughter! Where is she?! Dad, l think l'll have to go on Thursday... Renunciation procedure is taking longer than l thought. Dad, l think he's trying to kill me. Help me! like this? Where is she? No! No! Painful, isn't it? Do you see what you did to your own daughter? Painful memory is far more agonizing than pain in the heart. You'll live the rest of your life in that pain. Hye-won wanted to see her dad so much. Shut up! She cried so much saying she wanted to see you, hear your voice... lt was hard to kill her. l said shut up! Her last words were that you'll never forgive me. Leave this to us, Professor. Professor! My poor girl... She suffered so much. Don't be so sad... The pain only really begins now. Was that a gun shot? Step on it, damn it! This was what he wanted. l can't... l can't... forgive myself, either. You know what's harder than to die? It's to forgive. Because it takes too Iong a time of agonizing pain to forgive.
