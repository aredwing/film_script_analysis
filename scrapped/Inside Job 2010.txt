agencies to evaluate the CDOs 515 00:28:39,001 -- 00:28:42,000 and many of them were given an AAA rating 516 00:28:42,001 -- 00:28:45,000 which is highest possible investment grade 517 00:28:45,001 -- 00:28:48,000 This made CDOs popular with retirement funds 518 00:28:48,001 -- 00:28:52,000 which can only purchase highly rated securities 519 00:28:52,800 -- 00:28:56,000 This system was a ticking time bomb 520 00:28:56,001 -- 00:29:00,000 Lenders didn't care anymore about whether a borrower could repay 521 00:29:00,001 -- 00:29:01,000 So they started making riskier loans 522 00:29:01,001 -- 00:29:05,000 The investment banks didn't care either 523 00:29:05,001 -- 00:29:09,600 The more CDOs they sold the higher their profits 524 00:29:09,601 -- 00:29:13,000 and the rating agencies which were paid by the investment banks 525 00:29:13,001 -- 00:29:18,001 had no liability if their ratings of CDOs proved wrong 526 00:29:18,002 -- 00:29:20,500 You weren't going to be on the hook 527 00:29:20,501 -- 00:29:23,000 and there weren't regulatory constraints 528 00:29:23,001 -- 00:29:26,000 so it was a green light to just pump out more and more loans 529 00:29:26,001 -- 00:29:30,000 Between 2000 and 2003 530 00:29:30,001 -- 00:29:32,300 the number of mortgage loans made each year 531 00:29:32,301 -- 00:29:35,000 nearly quadrupled 532 00:29:35,001 -- 00:29:38,000 Everybody in this securitization food chain 533 00:29:38,001 -- 00:29:40,000 from the very beginning until the end 534 00:29:40,001 -- 00:29:43,000 didn't care about the quality of the mortgage 535 00:29:43,001 -- 00:29:45,500 they cared about maximizing their volume 536 00:29:45,501 -- 00:29:48,000 and getting a fee out of it 537 00:29:48,001 -- 00:29:50,500 In the early 2000s there was a huge increase 538 00:29:50,501 -- 00:29:54,000 in the riskiest loans called subprime 539 00:29:54,001 -- 00:29:56,300 but when thousands of subprime loans 540 00:29:56,301 -- 00:29:59,000 were combined to create CDOs 541 00:29:59,001 -- 00:30:03,001 Many of them still received AAA ratings 542 00:30:04,000 -- 00:30:09,000 -Now it wouldn't have been possible to create derivative products 543 00:30:09,001 -- 00:30:12,000 that don't have these risks 544 00:30:12,001 -- 00:30:14,000 that carry the equivalent of deductibles 545 00:30:14,001 -- 00:30:17,000 where there are limits on risks 546 00:30:17,001 -- 00:30:19,000 that can be taken on and so forth 547 00:30:19,001 -- 00:30:21,001 they didn't do that, did they? 548 00:30:21,002 -- 00:30:24,000 -They didn't do that and in retrospect they should have done. 549 00:30:24,001 -- 00:30:27,000 -So did these guys knew they were doing something dangerous? 550 00:30:27,001 -- 00:30:29,000 - I think they did 551 00:30:46,001 -- 00:30:49,000 All the incentives that the financial institutions 552 00:30:49,001 -- 00:30:51,000 offered to the mortgage brokers 553 00:30:51,001 -- 00:30:54,300 were based on selling the most profitable 554 00:30:54,301 -- 00:30:57,000 products which were predatory loans 555 00:30:57,001 -- 00:30:59,000 The bankers make more money if they put you on subprime loan 556 00:30:59,001 -- 00:31:01,000 That's where they are going to put you 557 00:31:07,000 -- 00:31:10,000 Suddenly hundreds of billions of dollars a year 558 00:31:10,001 -- 00:31:13,000 were flowing through the securitization chain 559 00:31:13,001 -- 00:31:15,000 Since anyone could get a mortgage 560 00:31:15,001 -- 00:31:18,500 home purchases and housing prices skyrocketed 561 00:31:18,501 -- 00:31:22,400 The result was the biggest financial bubble in history 562 00:31:22,401 -- 00:31:26,000 Real estate is real, they can see their asset 563 00:31:26,001 -- 00:31:29,001 they can live in their asset, they can rent out their asset 564 00:31:29,001 -- 00:31:33,000 You had huge boom in housing that made no sense at all 565 00:31:33,001 -- 00:31:39,000 financing appetites of the financial sector 566 00:31:39,001 -- 00:31:42,000 drove what everybody else did 567 00:31:42,001 -- 00:31:46,000 Last time we had a housing bubble was in the late 80s 568 00:31:46,001 -- 00:31:52,000 In that case the increasing home prices were relatively minor 569 00:31:52,001 -- 00:31:57,000 That housing bubble led to relatively severe recession 570 00:31:57,001 -- 00:32:04,000 From 1996 until 2006 real home prices effectively doubled 571 00:32:09,000 -- 00:32:10,500 At $500 a ticket 572 00:32:10,501 -- 00:32:12,000 they come to hear how buy 573 00:32:12,001 -- 00:32:16,000 their very own piece of American dream 574 00:32:16,001 -- 00:32:21,000 Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch 575 00:32:21,001 -- 00:32:26,000 were all in on this subprime lending alone 576 00:32:26,001 -- 00:32:29,000 increase from $30 billion a year in funding 577 00:32:29,001 -- 00:32:33,500 to over six hundred billion a year in ten years 578 00:32:33,501 -- 00:32:35,000 they knew what was happening 579 00:32:35,001 -- 00:32:38,500 Countrywide Financial - the largest subprime lender 580 00:32:38,501 -- 00:32:43,000 - issued $97 billion worth of loans 581 00:32:43,001 -- 00:32:47,000 It made over $11 billion dollars in profits as a result 582 00:32:47,001 -- 00:32:52,000 On Wall Street annual cash bonuses spiked 583 00:32:52,001 -- 00:32:56,000 traders and CEOs became enormously wealthy during the bubble 584 00:32:56,001 -- 00:33:00,000 Lehman Brothers was the top underwriter of subprime lending 585 00:33:00,001 -- 00:33:07,000 And their CEO Richard Fuld took home $485 million 586 00:33:07,001 -- 00:33:10,000 On Wall Street this housing and credit bubble 587 00:33:10,001 -- 00:33:13,000 was leading to hundreds of billions of dollars of profits 588 00:33:13,001 -- 00:33:19,000 By 2006 about 40% of all profits of S&P 500 firms 589 00:33:19,001 -- 00:33:21,800 was coming from financial institutions 590 00:33:21,801 -- 00:33:24,000 It wasn't real profits, it wasn't real income 591 00:33:24,001 -- 00:33:26,000 It was just money that was being 592 00:33:26,001 -- 00:33:29,000 created by the system and booked as income 593 00:33:29,001 -- 00:33:33,000 Two, three years down the road, there's a default, it's all wiped out 594 00:33:33,001 -- 00:33:37,000 I think it was in fact, in retrospect, a great big national, 595 00:33:37,001 -- 00:33:40,000 and not just national, global Ponzi scheme 596 00:33:40,001 -- 00:33:43,000 Through the home ownership and equality protection act 597 00:33:43,001 -- 00:33:46,000 the Federal Reserve Board had broad authority 598 00:33:46,001 -- 00:33:49,000 to regulate the mortgage industry 599 00:33:49,001 -- 00:33:52,500 but Federal Chairman Alan Greenspan refused to use it 600 00:33:52,501 -- 00:33:55,500 Alan Greenspan said no that regulation: "I don't even believe in it" 601 00:33:57,001 -- 00:34:00,000 For 20 years Robert Gnaizda was the head of Greenlining 602 00:34:00,001 -- 00:34:03,300 a powerful consumer advocacy group 603 00:34:03,301 -- 00:34:06,000 He met with Greenspan on a regular basis 604 00:34:06,001 -- 00:34:08,500 We gave him an example of Countrywide 605 00:34:08,501 -- 00:34:14,000 150 different complex adjustable rate mortgages 606 00:34:14,001 -- 00:34:17,000 He said if you'd had a doctorate in math 607 00:34:17,001 -- 00:34:19,500 you wouldn't be able to understand them enough 608 00:34:19,501 -- 00:34:23,000 to know which was good for you and which wasn't 609 00:34:23,001 -- 00:34:26,000 So we thought he was going to take action 610 00:34:26,001 -- 00:34:29,000 but as the conversation continues 611 00:34:29,001 -- 00:34:31,800 it was clear he was stuck with his ideology 612 00:34:31,801 -- 00:34:34,300 We met again with Greenspan at '05 613 00:34:34,301 -- 00:34:39,000 often we met with him twice a year never less than once a year 614 00:34:39,001 -- 00:34:41,000 and he wouldn't change his mind 615 00:34:41,001 -- 00:34:46,000 Alan Greenspan declined to be interviewed for this film. 616 00:34:46,001 -- 00:34:50,000 In this amazing world of instant global communications 617 00:34:50,001 -- 00:34:52,000 The free and efficient movement of capital 618 00:34:52,001 -- 00:34:57,000 is helping to create the greatest prosperity in human history 619 00:35:02,500 -- 00:35:06,000 146 people were cut from the enforcement division of SEC 620 00:35:06,001 -- 00:35:10,000 is that what you also testified to 621 00:35:10,001 -- 00:35:15,000 Yeah, I think there has been a, a systematic 622 00:35:15,001 -- 00:35:17,200 gutting, or whatever you want to call it, 623 00:35:17,201 -- 00:35:20,000 of the agency and its capability, 624 00:35:20,001 -- 00:35:22,000 through cutting back of staff. 625 00:35:22,001 -- 00:35:24,500 The SEC office of risk management 626 00:35:24,501 -- 00:35:29,000 was reduced to a staff, did you say, of one? 627 00:35:29,001 -- 00:35:34,500 Yeah, when that gentleman would go home at night he could turn the lights out. 628 00:35:35,000 -- 00:35:38,000 During the bubble the investment banks were borrowing heavily 629 00:35:38,001 -- 00:35:42,000 to buy more loans and create more CDOs 630 00:35:42,001 -- 00:35:45,000 The ratio between borrowed money and 631 00:35:45,001 -- 00:35:48,000 banks own money was called leverage 632 00:35:48,001 -- 00:35:52,000 The more banks borrowed the higher their leverage 633 00:35:53,000 -- 00:35:58,000 In 2004 Henry Paulson the CEO of Goldman Sachs 634 00:35:58,001 -- 00:36:01,000 helped lobby the Securities and Exchange Commission 635 00:36:01,001 -- 00:36:03,000 to relax limits on leverage 636 00:36:03,001 -- 00:36:07,000 allowing the banks to sharply increase their borrowing 637 00:36:07,001 -- 00:36:10,000 The SEC somehow decided to let 638 00:36:10,001 -- 00:36:13,200 investment banks gamble a lot more 639 00:36:13,201 -- 00:36:17,000 That was nuts. I don't know why they did that, but they did that 640 00:36:23,001 -- 00:36:26,200 We've said these are the big guys and clearly that's true. 641 00:36:26,201 -- 00:36:33,000 But that means if anything goes wrong, it's going to be an awfully big mess. 642 00:36:33,001 -- 00:36:39,400 At these levels you're obviously dealing with the most highly sophisticated financial institutions 643 00:36:39,401 -- 00:36:43,300 These are the firms that do most of the derivative activity in the United States. 644 00:36:43,301 -- 00:36:46,300 We talked to some of them as to what their comfort level was. 645 00:36:46,301 -- 00:36:52,000 The firms actually thought that the number was appropriate. 646 00:36:52,001 -- 00:36:57,000 Do the commissioners vote to adopt the rule amendments and new rules as recommended by the staff? 647 00:36:57,001 -- 00:37:01,001 We do indeed. Unanimous. And we are adjourned. 648 00:37:04,500 -- 00:37:08,000 The degree of leverage in financial system 649 00:37:08,001 -- 00:37:10,300 became absolutely frightening 650 00:37:10,301 -- 00:37:15,000 investment banks leveraging up to the level 33 to 1 651 00:37:15,001 -- 00:37:19,500 which means that tiny 3 percent decrease in a value of asset base 652 00:37:19,501 -- 00:37:22,000 would leave them insolvent. 653 00:37:24,000 -- 00:37:27,000 There was another ticking time bomb in the financial system 654 00:37:27,001 -- 00:37:31,000 AIG - the world s largest insurance company 655 00:37:31,001 -- 00:37:36,000 was selling huge quantities of derivatives called credit default swaps 656 00:37:37,000 -- 00:37:43,500 For investors who owned CDOs credit default swaps worked like an insurance policy 657 00:37:43,501 -- 00:37:48,800 An investor who purchase credit default swap paid AIG a quarterly premium 658 00:37:48,801 -- 00:37:56,000 If CDO went bad AIG promised to pay the investor for their losses 659 00:37:56,001 -- 00:38:02,000 But unlike regularly insurance speculators could also buy credit default swaps from AIG 660 00:38:02,001 -- 00:38:06,000 in order to bet against CDOs they didn't own 661 00:38:06,001 -- 00:38:09,700 In insurance you could only insure something you own 662 00:38:09,701 -- 00:38:12,500 Let's say you and I own property and I own a house 663 00:38:12,501 -- 00:38:15,000 I can only insure that house once 664 00:38:15,001 -- 00:38:21,000 the derivatives universe essentially enables anybody to actually insure that house 665 00:38:21,001 -- 00:38:25,000 So you could insure that somebody else could do that. So 50 people could insure my house 666 00:38:25,001 -- 00:38:29,000 So what happens is if my house burns down 667 00:38:29,001 -- 00:38:32,000 the number of losses in the system becomes proportionally large 668 00:38:32,001 -- 00:38:35,600 Since credit default swaps were unregulated 669 00:38:35,601 -- 00:38:40,000 AIG didn't have put aside any money to cover potential losses 670 00:38:40,001 -- 00:38:44,500 Instead AIG paid its employees huge cash bonuses 671 00:38:44,501 -- 00:38:47,000 as soon as contracts were signed 672 00:38:47,001 -- 00:38:52,500 but if the CDOs later went bad AIG would be on the hook 673 00:38:52,501 -- 00:38:57,500 People were essentially been rewarded for taking massive risks.

Our regulators are, are very vigilant. 1062 01:03:38,501 -- 01:03:40,800 On September 7th, 2008 1063 01:03:40,801 -- 01:03:42,800 Henry Paulson announced the federal takeover 1064 01:03:42,801 -- 01:03:45,000 of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 1065 01:03:45,001 -- 01:03:48,000 two giant mortgage lenders on the brink of collapse. 1066 01:03:48,001 -- 01:03:50,000 Nothing about our actions today 1067 01:03:50,001 -- 01:03:52,800 in any way reflects a changed view 1068 01:03:52,801 -- 01:03:55,000 of the housing correction or the strength 1069 01:03:55,001 -- 01:03:57,500 of other U.S. financial institutions. 1070 01:03:57,501 -- 01:04:00,000 Two days later, Lehman Brothers announced record losses 1071 01:04:00,001 -- 01:04:04,500 of 3.2 billion dollars, and its stock collapsed. 1072 01:04:05,501 -- 01:04:08,500 The effects of Lehman and AIG in September 1073 01:04:08,501 -- 01:04:10,000 still came as a surprise. 1074 01:04:10,001 -- 01:04:13,800 I mean, this is even after July, and Fannie and Freddie. So... 1075 01:04:13,801 -- 01:04:20,500 clearly, there was stuff that as of September major stuff  1076 01:04:20,501 -- 01:04:23,000 that nobody knew about. 1077 01:04:23,001 -- 01:04:25,500 I think that's, I think that's fair. 1078 01:04:25,501 -- 01:04:29,600 Bear Stearns was rated AAA, like, a month before it went bankrupt? 1079 01:04:29,601 -- 01:04:32,000 - Uh, more likely A2. - A2. 1080 01:04:32,001 -- 01:04:33,001 - Yeah. - Okay. 1081 01:04:33,002 -- 01:04:36,500 - A2 is still not bankrupt. - No no no. No. 1082 01:04:36,501 -- 01:04:39,000 That's, that's a high investment grade, solid investment-grade rating 1083 01:04:39,001 -- 01:04:42,500 Lehman Brothers; A2, within days of failing. 1084 01:04:42,501 -- 01:04:47,500 Um, AIG, AA, within days of being bailed out. 1085 01:04:47,501 -- 01:04:52,000 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were AAA when they were rescued. 1086 01:04:52,001 -- 01:04:56,000 Um, Citigroup, Merrill; all, all of them had investment-grade ratings. 1087 01:04:56,001 -- 01:04:57,500 How can that be? 1088 01:04:57,501 -- 01:05:02,000 Well, that's a good question.

01:34:04,001 -- 01:34:08,500 Companies like General Motors, Chrysler, and U.S. Steel 1627 01:34:08,501 -- 01:34:12,700 formerly the core of the U.S. economy were poorly managed 1628 01:34:12,701 -- 01:34:16,000 and falling behind their foreign competitors. 1629 01:34:16,001 -- 01:34:19,900 And as countries like China opened their economies, 1630 01:34:19,901 -- 01:34:25,000 American companies sent jobs overseas to save money. 1631 01:34:26,000 -- 01:34:27,600 For many, many years, 1632 01:34:27,601 -- 01:34:30,300 the 660 million people in the developed world 1633 01:34:30,301 -- 01:34:31,900 were effectively sheltered 1634 01:34:31,901 -- 01:34:34,100 from all of this additional labor 1635 01:34:34,101 -- 01:34:35,600 that existed on the planet 1636 01:34:35,601 -- 01:34:39,000 Suddenly, the Bamboo Curtain and the Iron Curtain are lifted 1637 01:34:39,001 -- 01:34:43,000 and you have 2.5 billion additional people 1638 01:34:43,001 -- 01:34:44,200 American factory workers 1639 01:34:44,201 -- 01:34:47,000 were laid off by the tens of thousands 1640 01:34:47,001 -- 01:34:49,600 Our manufacturing base was destroyed, 1641 01:34:49,601 -- 01:34:51,500 literally over the course of a few years. 1642 01:34:51,501 -- 01:34:55,400 As manufacturing declined, other industries rose. 1643 01:34:55,401 -- 01:34:58,800 The United States leads the world in information technology, 1644 01:34:58,801 -- 01:35:02,000 where high-paying jobs are easy to find. 1645 01:35:02,001 -- 01:35:04,700 But those jobs require an education. 1646 01:35:04,701 -- 01:35:06,500 And for average Americans, 1647 01:35:06,501 -- 01:35:09,500 college is increasingly out of reach. 1648 01:35:09,501 -- 01:35:12,800 While top private universities like Harvard 1649 01:35:12,801 -- 01:35:15,300 have billions of dollars in their endowments 1650 01:35:15,301 -- 01:35:18,400 funding for public universities is shrinking, 1651 01:35:18,401 -- 01:35:20,200 and tuition is rising. 1652 01:35:20,201 -- 01:35:23,100 Tuition for California's public universities 1653 01:35:23,101 -- 01:35:26,500 rose from 650 dollars in the 1970s 1654 01:35:26,501 -- 01:35:30,500 to over 10,000 dollars in 2010. 1655 01:35:30,700 -- 01:35:33,200 Increasingly, the most important determinant 1656 01:35:33,201 -- 01:35:35,000 of whether Americans go to college 1657 01:35:35,001 -- 01:35:38,500 is whether they can find the money to pay for it. 1658 01:35:38,501 -- 01:35:41,700 Meanwhile, American tax policy shifted 1659 01:35:41,701 -- 01:35:43,000 to favor the wealthy 1660 01:35:43,001 -- 01:35:45,800 When I first came to office, 1661 01:35:45,801 -- 01:35:49,000 I thought taxes were too high, and they were. 1662 01:35:49,001 -- 01:35:52,000 The most dramatic change was a series of tax cuts 1663 01:35:52,001 -- 01:35:53,900 designed by Glenn Hubbard 1664 01:35:53,901 -- 01:35:55,000 who at the time was serving 1665 01:35:55,001 -- 01:35:58,500 as President Bush's chief economic advisor 1666 01:35:58,501 -- 01:36:02,600 The Bush administration sharply reduced taxes on investment gains, 1667 01:36:02,601 -- 01:36:03,800 stock dividends, 1668 01:36:03,801 -- 01:36:05,700 and eliminated the estate tax. 1669 01:36:05,701 -- 01:36:08,500 We had a comprehensive plan 1670 01:36:08,501 -- 01:36:11,200 that, when acted has left nearly $1.1 trillion 1671 01:36:11,201 -- 01:36:13,900 in the hands of American workers families, investors, 1672 01:36:13,901 -- 01:36:15,500 and small business owners. 1673 01:36:15,501 -- 01:36:18,000 Most of the benefits of these tax cuts 1674 01:36:18,001 -- 01:36:22,000 went to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. 1675 01:36:22,001 -- 01:36:24,500 And by the way, it was really the cornerstone, 1676 01:36:24,501 -- 01:36:27,300 in many ways, of our economic recovery policy. 1677 01:36:27,301 -- 01:36:30,000 Inequality of wealth in the United States 1678 01:36:30,001 -- 01:36:34,000 is now higher than in any other developed country. 1679 01:36:34,001 -- 01:36:38,200 American families responded to these changes in two ways: 1680 01:36:38,201 -- 01:36:43,000 by working longer hours, and by going into debt. 1681 01:36:43,001 -- 01:36:46,300 As the middle class falls further and further behind, 1682 01:36:46,301 -- 01:36:51,000 there is a political urge to respond 1683 01:36:51,001 -- 01:36:54,000 by making it easier to get credit. 1684 01:36:54,001 -- 01:36:56,800 You don't have to have a lousy home. 1685 01:36:56,801 -- 01:36:58,600 The low-income home buyer 1686 01:36:58,601 -- 01:37:03,000 can have just as nice a house as anybody else. 1687 01:37:03,001 -- 01:37:06,600 American families borrowed to finance their homes 1688 01:37:06,601 -- 01:37:08,600 their cars, their healthcare, 1689 01:37:08,601 -- 01:37:11,800 and their children's educations. 1690 01:37:11,801 -- 01:37:15,000 People in the bottom 90 percent 1691 01:37:15,001 -- 01:37:20,000 lost ground between 1980 and 2007 1692 01:37:20,001 -- 01:37:25,500 It all went to the top 1 percent 1693 01:37:26,000 -- 01:37:28,500 For the first time in history, 1694 01:37:28,501 -- 01:37:31,000 average Americans have less education 1695 01:37:31,001 -- 01:37:35,000 and are less prosperous than their parents 1696 01:37:36,500 -- 01:37:41,500 The era of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street 1697 01:37:41,501 -- 01:37:43,400 and in Washington 1698 01:37:43,401 -- 01:37:44,401 has led us to a financial crisis as serious as 1699 01:37:44,402 -- 01:37:49,700 any that we have faced since the Great Depression. 1700 01:37:49,701 -- 01:37:50,800 When the financial crisis struck 1701 01:37:50,801 -- 01:37:53,400 just before the 2008 election 1702 01:37:53,401 -- 01:37:55,500 Barack Obama pointed to Wall Street greed 1703 01:37:55,501 -- 01:37:57,200 and regulatory failures 1704 01:37:57,201 -- 01:37:59,800 as examples of the need for change in America. 1705 01:37:59,801 -- 01:38:01,800 A lack of oversight in Washington 1706 01:38:01,801 -- 01:38:03,600 and on Wall Street is exactly 1707 01:38:03,601 -- 01:38:06,000 what got us into this mess. 1708 01:38:06,001 -- 01:38:08,800 After taking office, President Obama 1709 01:38:08,801 -- 01:38:11,000 spoke of the need to reform the financial industry. 1710 01:38:11,001 -- 01:38:13,000 We want a systemic-risk regulator, 1711 01:38:13,001 -- 01:38:14,500 increased capital requirements 1712 01:38:14,501 -- 01:38:17,300 We need a consumer financial protection agency 1713 01:38:17,301 -- 01:38:19,500 we need to change Wall Street's culture. 1714 01:38:19,501 -- 01:38:23,000 But when finally enacted in mid-2010 1715 01:38:23,001 -- 01:38:25,800 the administration's financial reforms were weak 1716 01:38:25,801 -- 01:38:29,200 and in some critical areas, including the rating agencies 1717 01:38:29,201 -- 01:38:30,201 lobbying, and compensation 1718 01:38:30,202 -- 01:38:34,500 nothing significant was even proposed 1719 01:38:34,501 -- 01:38:38,700 Addressing Obama and, quote, regulatory reform: 1720 01:38:38,701 -- 01:38:43,000 my response, if it was one word, would be: Ha! 1721 01:38:43,001 -- 01:38:46,000 There s very little reform 1722 01:38:46,001 -- 01:38:47,800 How come? 1723 01:38:47,801 -- 01:38:51,200 It's a Wall Street government 1724 01:38:54,000 -- 01:38:57,400 Obama chose Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary 1725 01:38:57,401 -- 01:38:59,900 Geithner was the president of the New York Federal Reserve 1726 01:38:59,901 -- 01:39:01,300 during the crisis 1727 01:39:01,301 -- 01:39:02,600 and one of the key players 1728 01:39:02,601 -- 01:39:04,300 in the decision to pay Goldman Sachs 1729 01:39:04,301 -- 01:39:05,700 100 cents on the dollar 1730 01:39:05,701 -- 01:39:08,000 for its bets against mortgages. 1731 01:39:08,001 -- 01:39:11,300 When Tim Geithner was testifying 1732 01:39:11,301 -- 01:39:13,500 to be confirmed as Treasury secretary 1733 01:39:13,501 -- 01:39:16,700 he said: "I have never been a regulator" 1734 01:39:16,701 -- 01:39:19,500 Now that said to me, he did not understand his job 1735 01:39:19,501 -- 01:39:21,500 as president of the New York Fed. 1736 01:39:25,001 -- 01:39:29,000 The new president of the New York Fed is William C.
