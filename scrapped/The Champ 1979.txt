Okay, Billy. -Right. | -Okay?. Billy Flynn? -Yeah? Who wants to know?. You a coop? | -No. I'm Mike Phillips. You look like a cop, you know that, Mike? -I'd like to talk to you. | -Not now, Mikey, I'm a winner. I'm Annie's husband. Just a minute? Yeah, all right. Let's find someplace. -We've got a little problem. | -No, we don't have a problem. I got rid of that problem several years ago. | You gotthe problem. I really wanted to taak about the boy. What did she do, cry a little bit | to get you to come down here? You could be in a lot of trouble | messing in other people's business. I'm married to the mother of your son. -You don't like that, but that's how it is. | -I'll tell you how it is: T.J.'s a healthy, happy kid, | and he's going to stay that way. The track is the greatest place | for a kid to grow up. I agree with you. You agree with me? Beautiful place for a kid to grow up. | t's kind of a paradise. When I saw T.J. I thought, | "My God, what a wonderful child! " My hat's off to you, Billy. | You've been a greatfather. Anyway, he knows his manners. -I got to go. I'm on a hot streak. | -Wait, wait a minute. There's more to it, isn't there? I mean... ..he does have a mother. He's got no mother. You can't decide for him! It's up to him to make up his own mind. I got to go. Let mejust ask you this: T.J. won't always be 8 years old. | He's a very bright litte boy. What happens when he finds out | that he has a mother?. And that she loves him? That she wanted to be with him, | only you wouldn't let that happen? How are you going to handle it? Some mother. She doess nothing for him, | and now after seven years it's: "Oh, my, I love him so much. | I just never knew it." Never did she change his pants... ..or wipe his nose... ..teach him his prayers, | tel him right from wrong, give him a bath. But what differencee does that make? Some goddamn mother! -Good night, gents. | -Good night. -Goood night. | -Good night. A horse? What am I going to do | with a goddamn horse? That horse cost me $6,000. I don't caare what it cost.

T.J. didn't exactly say so in the letter, | but I think.... I think he'd like me to be there. And.... Mike, what's more important | is that I think I should be there. Would you prefer I lie to you? Will you call me if you decide | to stay and walk horses? How's it feel, Billy?. Feels good. How's that? Okay, you guys, a few more rounds. | Let's get ready. Hesh, close the door.
