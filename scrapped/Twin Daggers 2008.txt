 

                        Sorry about the noise. lt's just such a pleasure to use the abacus again. Sorry again. Must be all the coffee l had this morning. Ah, Yakuza. Sorry about your boss. Heard he had a heck of a funeral. Who-ah! Baka! That was for cussing. Ah, ''Romeo and Juliet.'' My favorite. You got my sub sandwich there, Bobby? Funny, most people call be ''Body.'' Well, you certainly are. Did you watch my performance? Very nice, very nice. You obviously know a thing or two about dancing, don't you? See any rough edges that need to be smoothed? Oh, maybe a tad here or there. But nothing we can't work out. Then show me how to smooth them. l suppose my vast experience could be helpful, couldn't it, doll? You like what you see? Very good. By the way, your Russian friend sends his regards. No! Best mother in the joint. Don't move! Oh, shit! - Put it down! - Hey, don't shoot. - Put it down! - Don't shoot! Look, l was just looking. Don't shoot. - Here, catch this. - Whoa! Now you don't move! Whoa! Oh, shit! - Shit! - Oh, bingo! Wait. This one. Take the little one. How about another one, huh? This one's better. - Take this one. - No more, please. - How about this one? - No more, please! - Ha, yeah, take this. - No more, no more, no more. Ha ha! Hey, you look a little full. lt's been a pleasure doing business with you. Hey, you look a little stuck up. Oh no, oh no! - Ha! - Oh no, oh no. Oh God, oh God, oh no! Oh no, hold on. Not this one, oh no. - Oh no, oh no! - Ha ha! Not this one, not this one, not this one. Oh, shit. Sorry, man. What's the matter with you? Are you nervous about tomorrow? Nervous? l was a made man when you were puking on your prom night. What are you gonna do after the trial? Are you gonna lay low for the rest of your life? Hey, l'm gonna enjoy myself. What are you gonna do on your puny salary, huh? At least nobody put a contract on my head. Relax, it's the wind. All right. l know. Well well well. lf it isn't my good old team captain. Hello, Body. Nice to see you've maintained that namesake of yours. Oh well, you know, work out, diet-- the usual suffering. The witch and her body. The jackass and his muscle. Flex, nice to see you as well. You both here for the unique culture? l was told it was a unique spa treatment. Hmm. Well, if the three of us are here, then... Well, that's an unexpected reunion. Wonder who knows about the four of us then? Scholar, Body, Flex and Ghost. Welcome. The Army Intelligence Gifted Ops Team which specializes in ancient weaponry. That's ancient history. Hey, how did you know about the Go team? Most people who knew about it didn't live to tell it. Let me introduce myself. l'm Lan. l apologize for the false advertising. And l'm guessing you have some friends at Army Intel in order to get these photos. lt took me a long while to track down the four of you who went AWOL all of a sudden. And have you figured out why we went AWOL yet? The records show you guys had a fiasco of a mission six years ago. lt's an invitation-only game, l'm afraid. Shit! What? The FBl. You stupid idiots. So much for the Go team. Word has it now it's four new guns for hire. Oops. Forgot you guys don't use guns. Let's just say ''problem solvers.'' What do you want from us? A job offer. Yeah, well, the photos should have tipped you off-- working together ain't our thing. Thought you guys might've gotten along better during the course of training. Hmm, that's a laugh. You still owe me one. Shit! One, two, three. $4oo,ooo. My English-- no good. l heard 400 grand Ioud and clear. l Hay Moi. She is my cousin. And she needs a job done... if you guys are still interested. Looks like we're still here. ls this a joke? You want us to whack you? She Sue. My twin. She's worth that much, is she? Are you interested? No? You want us to go all the way to... China? First and foremost... show me the moolah. Here. Your advance-- $20,OOO each. Whoo! Looks like a real deal. Two conditions. First, no one else hurt. Only your target alone. Otherwise, no pay. All right. l'm a precision kind of gal. Collateral damage is bad for business anyway. One more thing. No witness. No witnesses? But yet, we can't whack any witnesses. Oh, man! lt must be done quiet. Afterward, l'll be Sue. You assume her identity. Would you mind clariing the situation a little? Why many questions? My apologies. Stick to the business at hand. Let's say one of us can nail your twin alone? Wouldn't it be unfair to split it four ways? We thought the four of you together would guarantee a result. Yeah, well, suppose one or two of us can get the job done. You know what l mean? All right. One person brings me Sue's body, take all the money. Hey, you still want to know what's going on with the twins? Not that l have to check my moral compass or anything. Okay. For your information, Moi International was founded by their parents until the evil twin could arrange an early exit. Yes, l warned her dad too. An original Shakespeare tragedy. l believe revenge is justified where the law couldn't serve the purpose. Then it will be delivered cold. - Morning. - Good morning. Yes? Yeah yeah. Okay. Miss Moi This is Mr. Ho'gan. Sue Moi. Nice to meet you, Mr. Hogan. The pleasure's all mine. Please, call me Bart. Then call me Sue. Have a seat, please. Can l bring you some coffee or tea? No, thank you. Buzz me if you need anything. You have a beautiful office. Thank you. lt feels very homey, very... safe. l didn't have to kill anyone to get it. Excuse my lousy joke. Your English is much better. Better than who? Somebody-- somebody you really don't know at all. l still have an accent despite all my years in America. Well, just makes your voice that much more appealing. Are you trying to sweet talk me into a deal? lt depends-- is it working? No. Damn. Let's talk business. l have the feeling it's going to be a very long talk. This is good. Almost as good as my favorite food. What's that? Maine lobster. Could eat them all day. Are you from Maine? Mm, you bet. Beautiful New England. lt's beautiful. But isn't it very cold? Ah, not if you've got someone to hold at night. Or a fireplace. Do you? Have a fireplace? Have someone to hold? Not for a long time now. l've been working too hard. - Me neither. - That's hard to believe. - You're beautiful. - What do they say? ''Lonely at the top''? Well, perhaps it's just that smart, powerful women tend to scare men off. - More water? - Yes, please. - Look out. Here. - So sorry! The first day on the job. Well, the way you're going, it could very well be your last. You okay? l'm fine. Where is the ladies' room? Over there. l'm just so clumsy. Don't worry. You're fine. You too? Pardon me? You got doused from that incompetent waitress too? Honey, you've got it all wrong. Let me show you. See, like this. Come on, come on. All right, your turn. No, that won't be necessary. Oh, come on. Don't be shy. Don't be shy. Come on. Whoo! Mangos. Sweeten those mangos, honey. Come on. You too! Swing it! Come on, swing it. Whoo! Oh! Wow. - Oh. - Ahh! ls everything all right? ls everything all right? Just some lady taught me how to dance. Well, l'm sure you dance beautifully. l've taken a class or two. Unfortunately, l have two left feet. Miss, may l have this dance? Have fun. Staking out your turf? You're not touching her tonight. May l? ls there a problem? What is it? You made me feel teCUre. l feel l can trust in you. Really? What if l wasn't the person you thought l was? Then you are insulting my judgment of character. Then you have my sincere apologies. Thanks for a wonderful evening. The pleasure was all mine. l'm warm now. Right you are. So, should we talk in your office tomorrow? Talk? Oh, yes. ln my office, nO. l'll call you. Oh. Love or money, Cap'n? What a choice. Oh, shit! Are-- are you-- Me Hay. l am so sorry. At least you noticed this! Yeah, almost blew my hem payday on a mix-up, huh? Uh, sorry. Let me finish my shopping, all right? Yeah. Those pants... make you look a bit fat, don't you think? Get out. Get out! Mr. Hogan? l'm Miss Moi's butler. Pleased to meet you. Miss Moi is waiting for you in the garden. You have a beautiful garden. Very unique style to it. l inherited my father's style. Western on our side, but Eastern at its core. A reflection of a changing world. Do you know what l just wrote? lt's a famous Chinese poem about something we all need. May l? Wow. l had no idea. Poetry is one of my true appreciations. But this is in Chinese. English, Asian, African-- l love them all. You're full of surprises. You don't know the half of it. Hmm, an antique fan. Remarkable. Still looks like new. lt's made of rare metal. Flexible, but it's still as strong. Sharp as a butcher's knife, l bet. l chop meat with it sometimes. Ah, ''Romeo and Juliet.'' My favorite. ''lt's the East, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, to kill the envious moon... The brightness of her cheeks would shame those stars. See how she rests her cheek upon her hand. Oh, that l could be a glove upon the hand, that l might touch that cheek.'' ''So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, retain that clear perfection which he owes.'' Can l ask you something? Of course. All these bodyguards-- are they really necessary? This is reality. Not like in the books. Are you in some sort of trouble? Do you understand the price of getting to the top? l knew people who got kidnapped and killed. Someone may be after me too. You okay? We should stick to the business at hand. You went inside her house. What happened? You did it? Just a scouting mission. Why not? Waiting for what? The butler was there. No witnesses, remember? You can't even fool a butler? Her bodyguards were everywhere as well. Then find other ways. l will. But first l have a question for you. Shoot. Did she really kill your parents? l mean, she doesn't seem the type. What are you saying? Me the vicious type? l'm not saying that. Your type-- read books, study arts. Almost forgot-- kill people for a living. Easy. Are you okay? What did l run over? One of those days, huh? Well, l got a spare. - Need some help? - No, it's my job. My boss is inside. l better hurry. What do you think you're doing? Hey, collateral damage means no paycheck. - Who's gonna know? - l will. You want to get me disqualified? She's mine. l set her up first. She's mine. You have to pass through me. You took my money. Do the job. lf you don't, somebody else will. You can count on it. What are you gonna do different? One spray of this herbal sedative, he'll be out for a half an hour. What collateral damage? You take care of the driver, l'll finish off the woman inside. We deliver the body together, agreed? Agreed. What's going on here? You're blocking the road. Officer. We're just helping him change his tire. So you're helping him? What's the story here? Oh, l had a blowout. - A blowout? - Yeah. Okay, so you need any more help? Oh no, almost done, sir. Good good, move out of here before l give you a ticket. All right. Hang on a sec. l need to see both your and your ID. Officer, you wouldn't give a ticket to a good Samaritan, now would you? Well, l suppose l could make exception in this case. Thank you so much. Yeah, thanks, copper. Thanks, copper. Aren't you gonna call me a greedy bastard or something? Easy come, easy go. l'll locate her again. So does everybody like what they see? The worry in his eyes Iooks genuine. Nice. Then l think l'm gonna have to fold. Don't move! Sorry, it's an invitation-only game. Gentlemen. Resume your seats. Shit! What? The FBl. You stupid idiots. You two jumped the gun. Now we're in deep shit. That's how l was trained. That's how l operate. Enough, the both of you. It's been done. So let's just deal with it. Flex, glad you could come. What's on your mind, man? Think you can collect that 400,OOO by yourself? l got just as good a chance as anybody else. l have a proposition for you. What say we team up and work together? lncrease our odds. lnteresting proposal. We work well together, you and l. Unlike the other two. You liked it 'cause you were in charge telling us what to do. l got the job done and kept everyone in line. Whatever, man. Don't you want to kill Body? l don't need help. You ever wonder what happened on that mission six years ago? What about it? Those two killed those agents on purpose. You saying Body or Ghost? Think about it. Go all the way back. When did Army Intelligence recruit you? - When l was in the slammer. - Same as the other two. They arranged your release and assigned me to train the three of you. Unfortunately, only you were ever grateful for the opportunity. The other two could wait to get out, though if they left, they would have been thrown back in the slammer faster than they could have blinked. After they killed those agents, Army Intelligence had to deny any knowledge of us to avoid a scandal. They gave the Feds false leads, and two months later arrested the wrong people and closed the case. Which is when they started freelancing for themselves. And l've had to watch my back ever since. And what about me? My career, gone. l have to sleep with one eye open. This isn't the life l chose. Is yours? Okay, Captain. Let's get 'em. Well well well. Fishing, Captain? Catch anything yet? The only thing biting today... is you. Ah, shit! ls she dead? One down. - Thirsty? - Thank you. Ah, this is Lan, my cousin. And this is Bart, my new friend. Pleased to meet you. Likewise. Either of you care to join me here for some exercise? Are you kidding me? l'm afraid of heights. Don't mind if l do. And l'll be exercising all the way to the kitchen for some ice cream. Need some practice, pal. Thank you. Not bad. Piece of cake. l'll catch you! Not so easy. Come on. Guess you're hard to catch. lf you want to catch me, Iure me. Don't chase. How shall l do that? Tell me sweet little lies. Butter me up. l'm gullible. You think l'm beautiful? No, drop dead gorgeous are the words. Your sweet little lies are working. Yes, but l'm not lying. Shh. You work and play hard. Must be tough. l have no choice. What do you mean? Being on top means there is a price to pay. l have enemies. l'm sure they're just people jealous of your success. Didn't you ask me about my bodyguards? Yes. What about them? l'm afraid. lt's my-- my sister. What about her? She is consumed with hatred. She will do anything to take my place. Surely things aren't as bad as they seem. You wouldn't understand what type of person she is. That's why l need-- need protection. You have goose bumps. So whose side are you on? - Does it matter? - Maybe. Maybe not. Look, Sue and Hay are both my cousins. l love them both. And who's the less manipulative? You want the truth? Lie to me and see if you live till tomorrow. The truth is l don't know. Neither do l care. So you'd let one kill the other? This is business. One of them will be the head of the company that l'm partner to. Ah... so you have a share in the company? See how complicated this is? Don't think that l didn't try to settle their disputes. The two of them have been going at each other since childhood. All l can say is, they are a messed up pair. l call them ''Twin Daggers.'' Hmm. Sort of reminds me of the messed up daughters of Shakespeare's Hing Lear. My best advice to you is do the job and take the money. Scholar? Scholar? Get down. Ghost is here. Aha! Where's Ghost? Man, what the-- what's wrong with you? My apologies, Flex. l've decided to go halves with Ghost. Say what? You two-faced son of a bitch. Don't try it. You-- l'm gonna cut your ass! l'm gonna cut your ass! You missed! l never miss. Uh-oh. Two down. Those were better days. l'm sorry for intruding. lt's okay. Do you have siblings? Only child, l'm afraid. Was it hard to be alone? You get used to it. You're free to do as you please. No security in here. Are you kidding? l need privacy here. You mind? Hey, easy. Sorry. That's better. What do you think of my skin? Soft, supple... vulnerable. Here. Come in. Miss Moi, Mr. Hogan, your fruit juice. ls Mr. Hogan staying here for dinner? Unfortunately, l have a prior engagement. Please excuse me. You did it? l didn't have the chance. You called me here to tell me this? Tell me, did your sister do something to you, or are you the bitter one? What's the matter with you? l want to know. She killed my parents. Not enough? Talk's cheap. l need proof. This is goodbye, sis. Don't-- don't kill me. Hill you? No no! Don't tell me l'm a monster. Please, Sue, you're my sister. We're just having a little fun. This your proof. She fooled you. She doesn't appear so brutal. lt's her gift. That sweet, gentle Sue. l'm sorry l doubted you. She fooled me too. l never saw it coming. And my parents, they loved her so much. Just have your money ready. Mom, Dad... your revenge is coming. This your proof. She killed my parents. Not enough? One person brings me Sue's body, take all the money. Okay, same time tomorrow. - See you tomorrow, Sue. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. - Thank you. She's really good. Yeah. Yeah, she's done very well for herself. l think she can afford it. Okay, who fancies a coffee? - l do. - Yeah, me too. - Yeah. - Yeah, l'm up. Anyone there? Hmm. Game over. Are you okay? Thank God you came. - Hello? - Scholar? May l ask who's calling? Do it tonight. Finish her. What's the hurry? l'm sick and tired of waiting. Tomorrow-- no more $4oo,ooo. Understand? Let me take you to Miss Moi. Hello, Sue. Bart? What a surprise. l need to ask you something, Sue. Don't worry. The contract we'll be negotiating is yours. And we should celebrate tonight. l want the truth. What? Your parents, who killed them? My parents? Why would you care? And your sister? What happened to her hand? You've been talking to my sister? Why would you want to know? Because l care about you and have a difficult decision ahead of me to make. lf you care about me, accept me. Forget the past. Wipe the slate clean. l can't. l need to know your history. You can't let go of the past? That makes two of us. Stay here. Let me show you the proof. - You idiot. - Hay? What are you doing here? Want the truth? Here. My parents. Jog your memory? Who killed them? Sue? Me? Or you? Deal with it. What happened? Who the hell are you two? - We own the clubhouse. - Yes. What do we do now? You set us up. No twins. We are one and the same. Bravo. Well played. You heard of the Chinese story about an empty city where the prime minister played music on the city wall alone? The enemy troops thought he was harboring an army inside the walls, so never attacked. Let me guess, your bodyguards-- Mmm, l just hired them to stand there. l could have killed you at many opportunities. But you didn't. No, l didn't. Your feelings were my best protection. And how did you reach me so well? lt wasn't easy. My friend at Army Intel gave me a hand. Not only did he track down you guys, he also gave me a profile of each one of you. That's how Hay, or Sue, Iearned what button to push. Hmm, so why the whole twin sister act? There are four of you and one of her. The only chance we had would be if you guys go after one another. So we kind of stirred up the pot a bit. Now you are the only one left. l believe congratulations are in order then. What for? Because you've already had your revenge. What do you mean? What are you two doing here? This is our clubhouse. We've come to stock up everything ourselves. Wrong time today. They've done nothing wrong. - If they talk-- - No. We don't know anything. They will talk. And l ain't going to jail again because of them. We don't kill innocent people. Sorry, Captain. You just can't do it! Let me go, God damn it! Sorry l couldn't save them. Though l've avenged two of the murderers. And you've taken care of the third. l'm falling in love with you. Let's start over with a clean slate. Scholar... l truly underestimated you. l still have a heart. You freaking liar! Unfortunately, the wrong time of day today. Come on, man, they're just some old folks. Ghost, watch them. You two, with me. You want to do time for killing federal agents? That was an accident. We were trained to respond fast. Yeah, try telling that to the Feds. Body's right. Our superiors will deny knowing anything about us. Okay. Just do it painlessly. The Feds could be here any second. Just take the money and disappear. Thanks, Captain, but... these two are witnesses. Leave these two to me. Just go. Did you get the account number? l was interrupted. Deposit the money into my account tomorrow and these designs will be yours. How you gonna explain these bodies? My three colleagues betrayed me, stole your money, killed the agents And l survived with slight wounds. Now leave. Then l'll be in touch. When can you stop lying? l knew when we had the four of you together you would try to knock off the others. lt was never about your money. lf the others were ever caught, they would have implicated me. This was my chance to shut them up for good. This is your moment to shine. lt doesn't have to end this way. You think l'm beautiful? No, drop dead gorgeous are the words. Your sweet little lies are working. Yes, but l'm not lying. Bart? So good to see you. Sue? What's going on? Oh, am l bleeding? What a workout. Are you okay? Here. Shh... Just tell me one last thing. Yeah? What's your real name? Juliet. ''The brightness of her cheeks would shame those stars. See how she rests her cheek upon her hand. Oh, that l could be a glove upon the hand, that l might touch that cheek.'' ''lt is but thy name that is my enemy.'' You knew your end... Romeo. Going to miss this place. lt made me feel like a big shot. And that fancy house l rented-- wish l could afford to stay there. You sold everything for this whole charade. Was it worth it? Now l can look at them without tears. l needed closure. Thanks for trusting me. The gang is waiting for you. Let's go. l did it. lt's over. Thanks for being my staff in my dummy corporation. Miss Moi-- Can l bring you some coffee or tea? You saved my life. You're welcome. l was so glad you came on time that night. He was about to do something. Your father hired me when l was an alcoholic and helped me stay sober. l owe him my life. All right, l'm gonna need everyone's ID. ...your and your ID. Officer... Things starving actors will do to keep a producer alive. Hi! Hello hello hello! You've got to show me that move again. Okay, swing those mangos, honey! Ah, yes! Honey, we were all touched by your parents in one way or another. And since we couldn't keep you from your revenge, at least we could protect you. At least. Thank you. Thanks, everyone. l couldn't say l wasn't scared around that ruthless assassin. lf you think that was scary, wait until the opening night. Yeah, we've got a show to put on.
