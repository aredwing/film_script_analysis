 

                        Richard. [Gasping] Shit. Jesus, Vee. I told you once. It's not right. You're my wife. Don't be such a bore. I saw her today... by the park. I want you to be careful there, after what happened last time. Fuck, careful? You want this as much as I do. [Kissing sound] We all have appetites, Richard. Some of us just have different tastes. [Kissing sound] [Woman, inaudible] Yeah, me too. Someone will turn up soon. Oy, that bloke's watching us. Where? Over there. Ya, I've see him hanging around here before? What direction? Pig or pervert. Same difference. [Sighing] Jesus, it's cold. [Exhales] You just need a decent meal inside you. Get some meat on those bones. Fucking rats eat better than we do. Well, rats aren't fussy, are they? You've got expensive tastes. I do wish you'd eat a decent meal sometimes, Richard. I had a sandwich at the club. Who was there? J ust Oharles, some of the boys. Any news? Nothing ever happens anymore. What else dld you get up to? Stopped at the park. And? She was there. He was too. He's always with her. No, they often split up in the afternoon. Better for business I would've thought. Tomorrow then. I'll leave work early. What do you want for dinner? Well, whatever. She'll eat whatever you put in front of her. They always do. H m. There was that one girl wouldn't eat fish. Spent hours on the Dover sole. Pearls before fucking swine. Well, If she wants to be fussy, she'll be sent straight to bed without any supper, won't she? [Chuckling] I'm going to get an early one. N ight, Vee. Greasy. I'll clean up before bed. Don't be too long. I want to get a good night's sleep and don't need you disturbing me. I'll just be a few mlnutes. Good night, darling. Vee... Yes? Do you ever think it's wrong? It's just a bit of fun. They get a meal and a few quid out of it. Besldes, no one gets hurt. M uch. I don't have change for that, mate. No need. What do you want? H m? I'm not in the game or nothing. I hope not. So what do you want? I'm Richard. Richard Gull. Sorrow. I just have one question. Do you know Jesus? I've never met the man. Well, he knows you. Yeah, well, I get about a bit, don't I? Oan't be expected to remember everybody. Listen, um, my wife and I, we believe in doing what little we can to help those less fortunate than ourselves, a meal, a hot bath, a few pounds in the pocket. Perhaps even a sense of possibility. You know, we like to think we give a small amount of hope to those who cross our paths. It's not much in a world as cruel as this one but it's something. You and your wife? Victoria. You'll like her. Everybody does. It's a nice ride. I admit the Lord has been good to me. I reckon. So is this a present then or do you have to pay him back? One thing, my wife and I take our faith seriously. I'd appreciate it if you respected that. Yeah, yeah, sorry. Don't be. Let's just enjoy what the good Lord has provided, shall we? Darling. Hello. I'm Victoria. Sorrow. I wouldn't normally welcome Sorrow into my home but in your case I'll make an exception. Oheers. So, how's dinner coming along? Very nicely. But perhaps Sorrow would like to clean up before we eat. Richard will show you where everything is. Wonderful. And we can chat properly later. I'm really very pleased to meet you. [Ioud footsteps] [Water pouring] [Knocklng at door] Here you are. Oheers. Well, you just relax and enjoy yourself. Feel free to use whatever's there. No hurry. Dinner won't be ready for a little while yet. You do eat lamb? Whatever. Well, um, have a nlce bath. Oh, we thought you might enjoy a small aperitif before dinner. What? A glass of wlne. Yeah. Oheers. How's it going? Too good for the likes of her. Sorrow, I ask you. She's all right then? She's perfect. You are clever. I feel like a little girl on Ohristmas morning. Oh, I didn't think bad girls like you got presents. [Chuckling] H m. [Gentle knocklng] (Vlctorla) Sorrow? Yeah? I'm just golng to set dlnner. Oool, I 'll be a minute. Wonderful. I can't walt for you to taste thls. (Rlchard, off) For what we are about to recelve, may the Lord make us truly grateful. And thanks unto him for delivering Sorrow to our doorstep. The Lord Jesus is a caring shepherd and watches over even the most hopelessly lost of his flock. Amen. This looks delicious. I just hope Sorrow enjoys it. I'm actually not that hungry. Well, eat what you can. Richard, pour her some more wine. Are you not-are you not having any? We don't drink. But we do llke o provlde for our guests. H m. You don't know what you're missing. Tell you what, Sorrow, you just help yourself. [Wlne pourlng] So, tell me Sorrow, how did you end up sleeping rough? Don't worry. You can confide in me. I've heard very many hard luck stories. Some of them quite shocking. It's true. Rlchard gets qulte overcome sometlmes. I do admire a man who's not afraid to cry. My father always said he was a bit of a weakling but men have to move with the times, don't they? U h, really there's not that much to tell. But there must be. You'll feel so much better for getting it off your chest. So what was it? Drugs? Or was bad old Daddy sneaking in for a quickie every night? [Chuckling] I bet that's it, isn't it? You naughty girl. Here, why don't you have some more to drink? [Pouring] I think... I think it's going to my head a little bit. Don't worry about that. I daresay you don't get booze of this quality on the streets. Do you drink very much, Sorrow? No, um... I like to keep my body clean, you know, pure, no chemicals. Olean and pure. [Echoing] And does that extend to boys? You know, men wanting to stick it into one hole or another? You must get a lot of that. I suppose It's qulte temptlng sometlmes if you're offered a few quid for the privilege. If you can call it that. I have... a boyfriend. Do you now? And how's that worklng out? Oan't be very comfortable with all that rotting in parks and back alleys. Dlrty, too. I mean how did you get clean afterwards? How vile. U m... [fork clatters to floor] She's had a bit too much to drink. She barely even touched her food, ungrateful little bitch. Do you know how much I've slaved over this? [Heavy breathing] About bloody time. Richard, get rid of that and open a clean one, would you? I'm gasping. [Breathing] [Whimpering] Have some fun with your little slut then. Do get on with it, Richard. (Rlchard) Lovely. You're lovely. See what you do to me. You love it, don't you? I can tell. You little bitch. You lovely little bitch. [Heavy breathing] See how wet you are, yeah, how much you like it? Bitch in heat is what you are. You're a cesspool, filth. You deserve this. Saw it in your face, knew that you were filth, that you'd want this. I bet you spend your life sucking and fucking. It's not enough, is it? It's never enough. You want more. Always more. [Heavy breathing] [Distorted heavy breathing] [Heavier breathing] [Moaning] Ohrist. Lovely. Look, she's trylng to whlsper sweet nothings in your ear, Richard. If you try to scream, my wife will stub her cigarette on your eyeball. U nderstand? Look at that. The llttle slut's enjoylng herself. Oh, can I pick 'em or can I pick 'em? Listen to me. What? [Whispering] I'm going to rip your cock off and shove it down your throat until you choke. Oh, good. Such a dirty little mouth. Why don't you wash it out for her, Richard? Set this child free from original sin. [Trickling] I baptise you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. [Trlckllng contlnues] [Groan] Olean as a whistle. Why don't you take a shower? Give us girls a chance to get better acquainted. Okay, but don't get too carried away. I don't want to miss anything good. H urry then. You don't mind his playing, do you? I didn't think so. It's all in fun. After all, we work hard for what we have so we deserve a little fun because we perform a function. What do you do? You're trash. You're nothing. You go through llfe waltlng for handouts. We take what's ours, what we are entitled to. We don't wait for someone to give it to us. We've earned it. You... you disgust me. Tough little bitch, aren't you? I respect that actually. I suppose you have to be. I can look after myself, but Richard, he's nothing without me. If it weren't for me, his darling mother would still be giving him back rubs every night. I've had to make my own way. You know what I'm talking about, don't you? I can tell. We're peas in a pod, aren't we? Two llttle old peas. You're a good girl really. You just need to be housebroken. Would you like that? I bet you would. Would you like mummy to break you? Look at you. Good enough to eat. You are enjoying this, aren't you? [Stifled cough-like] What? Are you laughing? [Choking] Do you think this is funny? [Scream] Victoria? [Sucking sounds] [Iow growl] [Ioud roar] [Cat-like growl] [Spitting and hissing] [Iow growl] [Growling] [Richard, shouting] [Iow steady growling] [Richard shouts] [Flies buzzing] [Buzzing continues] [Moaning] [Grunting] [Whimpering] [Whimpering continues] How long do you think we'll be able to keep him alive for? I don't know. Keep him doped up. We'll control the bleeding. Maybe a few weeks. I 'll have some fresh, raw meat for a few weeks. For what we're about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful. No one will be able to touch me. I see things, like, lot of... no matter what they do... so I don't touch people anymore. The man Is hanglng In the alr, but he's not human. What they're doing to him, it's horrible. But he's dying. He wants to die. [Chains clanking] I feel his pain. (Doctor Reese) Tell me what you're seelng. We've lost hlm. Take hlm away. Put hlm wlth the others. We've drawn another blank. He was so promising. The large dosage was too much for our boy. He wasn't strong enough to go ahead wlth the Graft. I'll keep looking. Something is bound to come along. [Cell phone rings] H i, Oarla. Oh, look, you know I can't. No, not anymore. Okay. Take care. [Approachlng footsteps] (Frank) Who was that? Sara, looking for a babysitter. Look I 'll [U N I NT E LLI G I B LE] You down there for nine. Okay, and the hash is Moroccan It's really good, yeah, but the coke is cut to shit so don't give that to any of the regulars. J ust give them some of the speed cheap instead. Okay. Okay. Be careful this time. [Dlstant loud muslc] How's it going? Same as last week, eh? Oheers, mate. Will that be okay? Yeah, yeah, that's sweet. It's not too strong. Enjoy. Here you go. All right. Enjoy. [Doorbell rings] What the fuck happened to you? [Faucet pouring] - Were you off your head? - No. So what happened? Why were you taking risks? I got mugged. My bag got stolen. My head hurts, Frank. Oan we not do this now? Babe's, it's really not working, is it? Every week something like this happens. Now, I know you've tried. But it's really not happening. I just want a pill for my head and to go to bed, okay? I've got to go out. Frank. [Door opens] [Approaching footsteps] [Ioud thud on floor] [Indistinct noise] [Furniture moving] [Female volce slnglng opera muslc over car radlo] Hello, Frank. Dr. Reese. Fresh? Very. It's important. We need twice as much. Tricky. It's a crucial time. You'll be well paid. Okay. I'll see what I can do. I can always use resourceful men in my line of work, Frank. Doctor Reese? I need to speak to you. It's, uh... it's about my girlfriend. (Jen) I'm a recovering drug user. Well, I mean I'm trying. It's hard. I manage to stay clean for a week or two and then I have a bad day. Frank's been great. But sometimes... sometimes I just get this ache inside and it's the only thing that helps. Is that all? Well, I was... I was on the game for a bit. How long? A whlle, I can't remember exactly. A few years. Frank would know. Frank was your pimp. He looked after me at first but, you know, once we got together he didn't want me doing it anymore. So you stopped. Well, I cut back. I started to work through an agency and that way Frank wasn't involved. And now? I'm trying to find a job. But it's hard. I'm going to give you some tablets. They're new but very promlslng. They're strong so don't be tempted to exceed the dally dose. And we'll need to take a blood test. Now you may get some slde effects. You might encounter some slight hallucinations, noises, lights, possibly some headaches, nothing to be alarmed about. But It's entlrely your cholce, of course. Jen, if we work together it can really make a difference. You've been through so much. (male volce) How much do you know about Doctor Reese? He must trust you. I'm his nephew. [Unintelligible] Get your first aid training? Yeah. Good. You'll need lt. You'll be night shift. Our boy needs watching around the clock now. J ust make sure he doesn't die on you or U ncle Reese will not be happy. Stinks in there. [Inhales deeply] [Releases air] Not good. Not good at all. [Light trickling] Nazi's figured out that these boys are something special. Used to slice them up, transplant their cocks and all sorts. Fuckin' evil. Even tried grafting them onto normal blokes. Sometimes it worked. Poor bastards would live for years. Anyway, Nazi's then found out that this stuff contains certain properties. Not only dld It heal the other prlsoners but it also messes with the head in a very special way. Our Doctor Reese Is very Interested. I thought this operation was all about drugs. It is, and a very fucking potent one, one that opens up the thlrd eye. Know what that Is? Only the blggest trlp a human belng can have and stlll be allve. Takes the drug experience to a whole new level. N ice. It's more addlctlve than crack and It ends up wiping your brain so much you can't even remember what day it is. But blitzed out people are happy people. And as long as Doctor Reese gets his money, who cares? Let the N H S take care of 'em. And I wouldn't want to be on that partlcular waltlng llst. Not a street drug neither. This is going to be very exclusive. Anyway, I'm off. Our boy's on his last legs so he needs watching 24/7. So stay awake and do your job. Any problems, give me a ring... but I mean real problems, yeah? Fuckin' hell. [Cell phone rings] Look, Oarla, I've told you I 'm not doing the stuff anymore. Well, I'm sure he'd be happy with Paula. Okay, how much? Yeah of course I need the money but no. No, okay? Everything all right? U m, yeah. Okay. Nothing to report really. Organic decaf soy latte. I got allergies. What's this? M m. Yeah, some bloke dropped it off earlier. Oh. [Sighing] Ah, bloody people. No, this dose is just wrong. Don't know what Reese is up... Hello? Listen, we make the spunk here and send it to you. You, send it to the lab. The lab makes it into tablets. With me so far? Good. Then you send it to Reese, not back here llke you keep dolng. Now come and collect it before Reese has your fucking kidneys removed. Hey, Dr Reese likes his sterilized toys to stay sterilized. He's got big plans for our boy here when his time comes up. That's why I brought his toys in. For some reason it's the one thing that keeps him going. Hold this, will you? [Electrical buzzing] [Electric humming] Wakey, wakey. Good boy. Here we go. [Squirting and sucking sounds] Always gets him started. Sweet. (nephew) Why the light thing in his eyes? I n lts eyes. It's not a person. It charges it up. Stops its sleeping, keeps the neurons firing. Good, lad. [Moaning] [Electric humming] [Gasp] [Groan] You okay? [Female volce screams] Yeah. What time is it? Nearly eight. You were out like a light last night. Yeah, I had one of those new pills. Weird dreams. You must've had a good night's [U N I NT E LLI G I B LE] though. Your eye looks better. I've got a couple thlngs to take care of. I should be back later this afternoon, yeah. Okay, yeah. I'll get a nice take-away or something, all right? [Cell phone ringing] [Knocklng] [Man groaning and moaning] Oh, oh. Llke that, do you? Oh, yeah. [Odd loud nolses] H uh, who rattled your cage? You passed out on me. I didn't pay good money to fuck a sack of potatoes. I'm sorry. I'm going to ring the agency about this. I'm giving you half, okay? Shit. (Jen) The pills made me feel better for a while. But now I keep on getting headaches and these strange white flashes in front of my eyes. Anything else? How are they strange? I can see a man hanging in a cage. It's like I can feel how he's feeling. He wants to die. These hallucinations are quite normal. Your body needs to adjust to the medication. It's important that you look after yourself. How are you feeling otherwise? Good. Good. I've been working again. You found a job? From my old agency. I see. They kept ringing. Why did you do that? Was it the money? Yes. No. It used to be for the drug money. But now, I can't explain it. I just feel sexual... but it's not normal. I feel like I'm hungry all the time. But I feel really good. I'm so confused. I'm just trying to understand, Jen. How can you? I don't even understand. Of course. (Dr Reese) Hello, Frank? Yes, yes the last dellvery was flne, very fresh. You assure me they are from separate donors? Good. Good. I'm calling about Jennifer. It's most important that she keeps taking the tablets I gave her. She's entering a critical stage of her treatment. She may behave strangely, become more detached and distant. It's quite normal. When you touch her she may pull away. The drug makes people very sensitive. Do let me know if she seems in any way unwell. I'm worried about her. She's been through so much. [Door opens and closes] (Frank) Jen? [Footsteps coming down stairs] Babes? You okay? I 'm tired. I've got a headache. Where've you been? Out with Pam. Looking like that? Like what? All tarted up. Fuck off, Frank. It was a job interview if you must know. You didn't mention it. So what? Maybe it's those that's giving you the headaches? Doctor Reese said the headaches are just a side effect. And besides I feel better. You're back with the agency, aren't ya? Oh, leave me alone, Frank. Answer me. Did you not hear me the first time? I said I've got a fucking headache. Now will you please just fuck off and leave me alone? Get off me. Not till you fucking answer me. Oh! Yeah, go on. You think I won't? Why should you be any different from all the rest? Weak, you always were. Don't. You don't care what I do. That is not true. It was different when I was turning tricks for you, wasn't it? No, things are different now. We are together. We're doing okay. You don't need to do that anymore. [Woman screaming] Frank. [Gasping] What is it? God. Jen. Jen? [Gagging] Stay away from me, Frank. J ust stay away. There we go, your favorite time of the day. [Door opens and closes] [Knocklng] [Cheerfully] Hello. (male volce) HI. M ichael? Yes. It's, uh, Karen, is it? Yes. Oome in. Thanks. Make yourself comfortable. Oheers. Oh, I uh, brought a bit of the old em' Bolivian marching powder. Oan I tempt you? Great idea. So I've just been down for an interview and I got a promotion. I'm, you know, it was my birthday so I thought, well, hell, go to town, treat myself to a nlce lady. I'm not a regular user. More of an occasional dabbler. It's my flrst tlme wlth thls agency. They seem nice people. Yeah. Yeah, they're good. [Sniffing] [Groaning] Oh, God. Oh, Ohrist! Oh, fuck. [Footsteps climbing stairs] Where the hell have you been? Jen? Jen, what...? Jen? Will you please talk to me, babes? I'm not angry. I just want to help. [Knocklng] Jen, please open the door. Let me help you. It's Frank. It's your Frankie. [To himself] Ohrist, why won't you let me help you? [Shouting] Jen, open the door! Open the fucking door! (older man) Oh, shit. J ust hold the fucker down, will ya? Get the choker. I 'm with you, babes. I'm with you. Hang on. We're going to get you some help, okay? Oh, now, listen, we need you to throw that shit up, okay? So I'm going to get you some saltwater. I'm just going to give you a little drink. Hang on. Jen. Oh, God, Jen. Oh, fuck. Doctor Reese, it's Frank. No, please, listen you've got to come here now. It's Jen. No, she's taking all those fucking pills you gave her. Your uncle's gonna shit when he hears about this. You tell him. [Cell phone rings] She's all right? Yeah. Yeah, thank you. [Deep sigh] I can't thank you enough. Well as long as she's all right. When can I see her? That will be great. Okay. [Doorbell rlngs] U h, yeah, I think that must be them now. Yeah, should I bring anything? Okay. [Doorbell rlngs twlce] Yeah, okay, look I better go. Thank you, Doctor Reese. Thank you. (older male) Yes. Yes. Everything is fine. She's been... Of course, "it's." It's... it's been no trouble at all. Yes. I will, Doctor Reese. (Jen) It's hard. I manage to stay clean for a week or two and then I have a bad day and Frank's been great. But sometlmes, sometlmes I just get thls ache Inslde and It's the only thlng that helps. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a trap but I've built it for myself, you know. I just need to flnd a way out. [Beeping] [Chains clanking] I need a new start, a change. How do I do that? How do I do that, Doctor? Can you help me do that? [Gasping] [Whimpering] [Screaming] [Screaming continues] [Screaming continues] [Screaming continues] [Phone ringing] (female volce) Romlett and Baker, hello? [Phone rlnglng] Romlett and Baker, hello? [Rlnglng] Romlett and Baker, hello? [Rlnglng] Romlett and Baker, hello? [Chair creaking] [Ticking] [Ringing] [Cartoon llke volces from televlslon] (Popeye, over TV) Ollve, don't you remember?

You gonna make me some? Why don't you make yourself some? I'm working hard all day. Let me finish this. I 'll make you some. I'm not just going to stand here watching you eat like a wet lemon. Well, watch TV. Don't want to watch TV. I'm hungry. All right, well, well share this with me. I 'm not going to fucking share this with you. I'm sorry. [Deep sigh] I 'm sorry, Pete. I'm not in the mood for it. You don't know where I'm taking you. No, I 'm not going in there. I told you I'm not in the mood. Please. Why don't we just go in the bedroom? Oh, get the fuck off me. [Loud thud] [Deep sigh] [Ioud music and chattering] Do you think Olaire's fit? What kind of question is that? Do you? I can't answer that. Yeah, you can. I just asked you to. No I can't. It's a no-win situation, isn't it? I mean if I say yes, that means I fancy my best mate's girl. And if I say no, that means I think she's a minger. Which is like an insult to you. So I can't win, can I? Not really. I just want you to tell me. Do you think she's fit? No, I told you already. I'm not going to... it's a no-win situation. Bullocks. J ust say yes or no. Is she fit or not? You're such a fucking idiot. You know that. [Ioud chatter] [Ioud music] (Pete) You ready? I thought you were going out with Al. Yeah, I was but you didn't want me to, so I 'm not. It's okay. You go on. I'll see you at home. But he's gone already. Well give him a call. What are you doing? I'm going out with the band. There's an after party they've invited me to. Well can't I come? Give him a call. He won't have gotten on the tube yet. And he's always up for biz, isn't he? No, he's gone. You'll have a much better time without me.

Yeah, sometimes I think that too. [Laughing] You bastard. [Ioud house music] [Laughter] So how come you've never had a girlfriend, Al? What you going on about, I 've had loads. I 've never met any. Yeah, well, I guess I don't keep them for very long. Why is that then? Because my cock's too big. [Laughter] Is it really? Nah, just kidding. [Chuckle] I bet it's bigger than Pete's. Olaire. What? Shut up. Well it probably is. I mean yours is cute but it's not big. Will you shut up, please? You're right. I've seen it. Fuck off. Language, Peter. So have you got a girlfriend at the moment then? Not at the moment, no. That's a shame. Not really. Would you like another beer, Al? Oheers, yeah. Go get some beers, Pete. You get 'em. I'm entertaining our guest. Why don't you go get them? Because I haven't finished yet and I think you've had enough to drink already. I don't care what you think. I want another drink. Well, fine, but I ain't getting 'em. It's all right. Look, uh, I'll get them. Do you want another beer, mate? Yeah, cheers. I'll show you where they are. [Dlstant laughter] (Clalre) You're absolutely dlsgustlng. [U N I NT E LLI G I B LE D IALO G]. [Ioud laughter] [Deep sigh] [Unintelligible dialog] Hello. All right. Oheers. Your beer, mate. Oheers. Al was just telling me how he's never had a threesome before. You guys are all the same. It's always been your fancy, isn't Pete? Not with another bloke. It's give and take, isn't it? Lisa's always fancied you. Doubt it. No, I reckon she'd be up for it. Well, she's not here, is she? Well I can get her around tomorrow maybe. Why don't we do it with her now? I don't want his smelly knackers swinging in my face. Thank you very much. Why would they be swinging in your face?
