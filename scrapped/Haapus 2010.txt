 

                        Hello! My name is Mangifera indiga oestoflawa... ...quadrifida rufocosttatta filfiliana microcarpa odoratta... ...orophila torcanda sumiliziliania superba Gurav. You may ask me, how this Gurav came in my name? But let me tell you, it's my surname. Because, my halt in this house may be seasonal... ...but I'm born in this clan. My ancestor were born in this clan. Yes. In the Gurav family. The eldest Gurav in the house is Anna Gurav. He reads the horoscope. He makes the calculation of one's life and death... ...depending on the relative position of the planets. Look at the time. How much one should wait? Brothers, we waited enough. Now please start the meeting. Will you listen to me? - It took lot of our time. I'm the village head. Am I mad to wait here for Anna Gurav? No matter how he's, but he's the forecast of this village. For the villagers, Anna is their God. But for Anna, his God resides in his mother... ...I mean our grandmother Kusumavati Gurav. Anna loves her a lot. Look, doctor says, soon you'll start speaking... ...if you take this medicine. Yes, I know. You're going to live more than 90 years. I've read your horoscope. C'mon, open your mouth. Yes. Very good. Okay! Anna would never step out of the house... ...without taking her blessings. Okay, I'll take your leave now. Hello! - Hello! Is this Mr. Gurav's house? - Yes, that's right. Parab here. - Parab? Okay. I'll call him. Anna's wife, Mai and Ajeet's wife Nandini... ...are totally different than all. They'd never cross their limits. Yes! Yes, hello! - Hello. Are you coming today? - Yes, that's why I called up. Come sharp at 6 o'clock 4 minute... ...and 25 seconds in the evening. Okay... okay... - Hello! Hello! Bless you! Throat is choked? - She's observing silence. Oh! Let it be. See you. Mai wanted to stop siring after a son and a daughter. And after she had twin daughters... ...her decision was final. As the horoscope suggested fourth daughter... ...Anna convinced her and Anandi came into their life. She's our Ankita. She pretends to be very shy type of girl at home. But in the outside world, she's totally opposite. Where are you heading to? For the computer classes. Is it necessary to go today? Yes. Otherwise, sir has said he'll commit suicide. What? I mean, he said he'll kill me. Yes, he'll kill me. Shall I go now? Come soon. Your would-be husband is expected at home. Shut up, you idiot. Anandi?! - That's what I was telling her. This is a routine with Anna Guav now. What do you mean? We keep waiting for him and he'd never come on time. Must be busy reading the horoscope. He never steps out of the house without finding the right time. Idiot fellow farted in the temple. Are you done? What's this? Does he check horoscope before attending nature's call? Mind you language. You're in the temple and not into your broker's house. Ajeet! I've spent 30 years of my life serving Chhajed. I will neither betray him... ...nor I'd tolerate any ill words spoken about him. Otherwise, right here... - What? What will you do? Villagers may by afraid of you and your Chhajed sir. But I'm not. Go and tell him this. Tell him, I'm here to answer to his dominance. "Give such a tough fight." "Give such a tough fight." So, Shivram? Are you alright? - Anna! Shall we begin? Why hurry? Wait a minute. let me check the time. Okay, now you can begin. Ajeet! Mango! We own the mango gardens. We own it since many generations. We took birth in Konkan. And mangoes grow well... ...in Konkan, so we own the mango gardens. But we could neither value this soil nor the mangoes. We grow the king of fruits. And still, we remained beggars. Mangoes are getting sold for high prices in foreign countries. But what do you obtain? Few coins. Traders come and cry that there's no business... ...and offer us low prices. Still we sell them. Why? We're happy if we obtain enough to satisfy our basic needs. Come to the point. Don't advise us. - Yes. We should take the mangoes to the market and sell it. We should earn the profit. What's this? - I'm not convinced. I object. Keep quiet. Earning profits. Don't blabber anything. Listen! You can sell mangoes to anybody you wish. You can make money in the ways you feel right... ...but don't listen to him. Nobody in Gurav family has ever succeeded... ...in this mango business. They've failed from last 10 generations... ...and it'll continue for the next 10 generations. But he doesn't understand this. Listen, Ajeet. Stop thinking about mango business. And stop provoking them too. I'm telling you. If you listen to him, you'll ruin your business. These are my words. Anna Gurav's words... ...who strictly believes in astrology and it's effects. Otherwise, you can do as you wish. If business could be done based on horoscopes... ...then the astrologers would have become millionaire now. Listen! An has reached on the moon... ...and you're still stuck with your mars, Saturn and Jupiter. People prefer modern method of transportation now. Yes, and that's why accident cases have increased. Are you getting me? They just leave home without checking the auspicious time. What are you saying, Anna? Everybody has to die some or the other day. Can you read their horoscope and make them mortal? Do you take the challenge? Tell me. Listen! I'll obtain good price of the mangoes. I'll develop this area. You just keep watching. Why are you silent now? Say something. Anna Gurav can only give suggestions. Final decision should always be yours. Anna! Anna, Ajeet is right. Look, you just don't do anything. Just bless him. That's it. Istten, Shivrarm! You can't put vermillion on the forehead of a woman on pedestal. Mind it. Mango is the king of all fruits. But you'll find many kings in the Konkan region... ...that'd win your heart. And one of them is Subhya. Subhash Chandra Shivalkar! You can go left or right. But I'm in the centre of your heart, Anku. Look straight. There's only one driver in the Konkan region... ...who can look behind and drive the rickshaw. And he's Subhash Chandra Shivalkar! Like this! Subhyna! Look straight. C'mon, hurry up! Dear, I'm in love with you. Let's hurriedly get married and... Hen! Hen! Subhya, look there. - God! Look at him. Subhya! What are you doing? Are you blind? Can't you see? Anku! Don't feel scared. You're safe. Your would-be husband is safe. Tell me when shall we get married? Marriage? You're mad. Keep waiting. Everything is over. - How can it be over like that? I had filled the full tank in the morning. Not the fuel. - Then? I'm talking about us. Everything is over between us now. Anku! Anku! Anku! Anku! Anku! Anku! What do you mean? Somebody is coming for my alliance today. Tell him to come tomorrow. C'mon. Will you take some steps or not? When I think about it even in my dream... ...I can see a scary face of Anna before me. He questions me of having an affair with a girl. He doesn't even accept bribe. But you don't worry. Anku, day after tomorrow, I'll come and talk with Anna. And that's final. You daily say this. - Yes. But this time I'll definitely come. 100%. By swear of you. Now if even 1% is reduced... ...then you can think that you've lost me. Anku! There he comes. Oblation him. Barrister Ajeetrao Gurav... ...has brought revolution in Vanerwadi's parliament. Barrister Ajeetrao Gurav, a developer of Konkan region. Mango trader. One, who's trying make people of Vanerwadi rich. Why do you bless him? Teach him something. He wants to trade mangoes. Going to make the villagers rich. Won't it be good if people become rich? And it's better to encourage rather than taunting. Give me water. Listen! You don't teach me what I've to do. Kayn? Wants to trade in mangoes. Tell him, I've already decided to jump in this business. Selling is not the only business. Aye, you come down. Go ahead. - Pick this up. Go ahead. Wants to jump in business. Ask him. What's the problem if I jump in this business? Mother, you know that in our family horoscope... ...Saturn is in the odd position... ...which is not in the favour of business. Tell him. Who's this Saturn? What relation does it share with me? There's only one evil star in my business horoscope. And it's always not in my favour. - Anna. Excuse me! - Yes. Take this. - What is this? You asked for the oblation. Very good. Bless your son then. For what? You've already put me aside in this house. Tell me what's wrong in doing a business? Listen, mother. I'm telling you. I'll see who does the mango business and how. I'll not let him pluck a single mango from the tree. Tell him, I'll steal the mangoes. Nobody in my family has ever stolen mangoes for business. I'll leave this house. Tell him to do anything he wish to. Tell him to leave now. Leave! Stop him! Ajeet, where are you going? To the Himalayas. Mangoes do not grow on Himalayas. Tell him, I'll make mangoes from ice and sell it. But... - Where will I go, mother? I'll go and stay in the cow-shed. Let him go. As it is we had to buy a new bullock. Yes, I'll go and stay there. I'll continue my research... ...over there and start with the business. Now I won't step in this house. And you can come there whenever you wish to see me. Bye, grandmother! - But Ajeet. - Hey. Where are you going? It's better for you to stay here. Go inside. Go. Let him go. I tell you, mother. I'll not take him inside if he ever returns. I'll kick him out. Anna! This teacher, who's irritated with the coolness of people... ...of Konkan region, came from Marathawada. In the very first visit he developed a strong opinion... ...that Nizam's atrocity was much better... ...than these people's mentality. Mister! Will you take me to Vanerwadi? Will it do if I drop you at railway crossing? What do you mean? I mean I'll drop you there. Increase your knowledge and learn some manners... ...rather than increasing your hair. How long is Anna Gurav's house... ...from the railway crossing? You should have told me before... ...that you want to go to Anna Gurav's house. Teacher getting Subhya's rickshaw is his bad luck. Were you from? - Ambejogayla. God! You mean you came from Marathawada? That means you're dropped into a forest from a city. I've come to see the animals of this forest. Yes, these hairy animals are really fit... ...to be caged in some zoo. It seems you're educated unemployed. Don't call me unemployed. My daily income is more than Rs100. I was asking the same question in other language. What? In pure language. Language I teach in school Are you a teacher? 100%. Any doubt? No! But what made you come to Anna Gurav? I've some work. It's not regarding some employment scheme. Meaning? - It's a personal work. Have you come to see his daughter? Yes! Thank you. Will you please show me... ...the direction towards Anna Gurav's house? That's Anna Gurav's house. Hey... are... There's no value of work. He didn't take the fare. Just increased the hair. It seems Anna is very famous. Has Anna died? Anna Gurav?! - No. Sada Damle. Barve street? Left for Japan and reached China. C'mon, hurry up! Rs.10 for 2 punches. Rs.10 for 2 punches. You'll get 2 punches for Rs.10. Hurry up! Hurry up! C'mon! Give it! Give it. Rs.10 for 2 punches. Give the money first. C'mon... She's Amruta Gurav. She's known as the bandit queen of Vanerwadi. The biggest question is who would marry her? Anna has successfully solved everybody's problem... ...by reading the planetary positions... ...but has failed in predicting about his daughter. C'mon, give it. - Will you show me this address? I don't want this. Keep it. I'm sick of roaming around and getting beaten. Now please show me Anna Gurav's address. Anna Gurav?! My God! Take care of the spike. Carefully! - Yes. Look, cut only the dry leaf. Carefully! Yes. Carefully! - Yes. Are you Anna Gurav? - Yes. Thank you. - Wow! Carefully! What are you doing? Guest! Come! Come inside. God! Hope... I hope your journey was safe. Yes, without much difficulties. But I got little tired searching your house. Okay. Go! Give him coconut. Go... Take it. - Take this. Let it be. I'll finish this first and then have this. This letter... I'll see it. Let the horoscope be with ynou. I'll read it later. No hurry at all. Horoscope? Why? See the girl first. - Girl?! Ankita! Ankita?! I'll introduce you with everybody. He's my son. Ajeet. - Hello. And she's his wife. - Hello. She's my wife. - Hello! She's my mother. Small... small... small mother. Small... small is mine... I mean she's grandmother. I mean... She's a grandmother. She's daughter-in-law. I mean his wife, and she's daughter-in-law... ...and grand daughter. Daughter-in-law. She's grand daughter. And... I mean... And I'm myself. Gurav. And he's my father. His father. Mine... I mean... I mean... My father was her husband. Her husband. Was this introduction or riddle? His that... and her this. And her that... Now tell me, who's whom? Eat slowly. Don't feel shy. - Yes. Just a minute. But my letter. It's my job to read the horoscope. And it's your job to see the girl. Listen, Cattle family... Before Gurav family head, I've to... Is this Mr. Anna Gurav's house? - I... Yes! Who are you? I'm Parab. I called up in the morning. Parab?! - Yes. Parab... - I spoke to you in the morning over the phone. Oh! - Yes. But then who are you? I'm Digambar Kale. Digambar Kale? Digambar Neelkanth Kale. God! Why didn't you tell me this before? I was trying to tell you this since when... ...and that's why this letter... I'm sorry. You didn't give me opportunity to say that... ...I'm Neelkanth Kale's son. I've been appointed as a teacher in the school here. Papa said Anna will arrange for your... ...accomodation in vanerwradi. So he gave me this letter. But you mistook it to be horoscope... ...and started with something else. You kept me in such an odd situation, I tell you. I was so confused. Parched rice. Sweet Ankita. Sweet coconut water. Ankita's coconut. - Shit! Ankita from coconut. Ankita's sweet parched rice, coconut water... Thanks for all of these. You do one thing. - What? For now you can stay in our house. - Okay. Anandi, come here. He's teacher Kale. Henceforth, he'll occupy your room. Okay? Anna! - No arguments. Come! - God, these ups and downs in Konkan I tell you... Are you a teacher? - Yes. Will you teach me? If you allow me to stay here... ...I'll definitely teach you. Okay? What will you charge? Charge? - Yes. Anna says that teachers don't teach at school. They take tuitions and make money. Tell your Anna, I'm not of that kind. Anna knows magic. He can predict future. Once, he cursed a man and a tail grew on his body. He had to remove it by operation. Really? - This is nothing. Anna has petted a ghost on the top floor. Ghost?! Does he know to do something good too? Your girl do not have sense. Have you taught her some culture or not? Don't speak anything. We came to you... - Neelkanth Kale. Have you sent your son... ...to your friend or to some bewitch? There's no comparison of our families. I'm a branch officer. We don't want your daughter. But you please listen to me. - C'mon. C'mon, can't you hear me? - Please, listen to me. No! I can't go against my wife. Done? Are you happy? You missed a good proposal. What was lacking in that boy? He was such a nice person. His horoscope was so clear. His father was baldy. - What? You had to marry a son and not his father. No! I don't want such husband. Oh! I see. So which type of husband do you want? Salman Khan? Or Shah Rukh Khan? I don't mind. Will it be okay with you? - What? Why are you laughing? Had they come in front of me... ...I'd not have spared them today. I'd have peeled off their skins. I tell you, we made good income... What? - Nothing. I just came to drop her. Chiltyna! Come inside. What's this? You think you're a wrestler? Look at her condition! And the way she behaves. How do I find a match for her? I feel ashamed to call you my daughter. If you're so ashamed then offer my life to some God. What did you say? And why do you find a match for me? Draw few lines on the paper... ...do some worship and take the decision. Listen! This is not in favour, that is not in favour. Sometimes blame a man and sometimes his fate. Always keep repeating the same sentence. Girl by birth. Then what? Sometimes it feels I'm not a girl but a stolen article. And whatever rules and regulations you've have... ...for girls, you can apply them to Ankita. I won't follow them at all. - Amru! You said enough. - Yes, brother. And listen! I won't tolerate your dominance as a father. Amruta! Enough of your drama. Now go inside. I don't want to stay in this house. Amru. Mother, I'll just be back. Vasanti! Did you see, you've a new friend today? Hey... Amru! What made you so angry? Amru! You're angry because Anna rebuked you, right? Isn't it natural? Won't he get angry? I'm not in his control and you too. Won't he feel tensed? Hey... Amru! Keep quiet! Hey, what made you cry now? God! Amruta Gurav is crying. Somebody please click her photograph. Hey, enough! Keep quiet! Anna can't think of anything other than horoscope? You tell me, brother. Are you happy with this marriage... ...based entirely on the horoscope? Or is sister-in-law happy? Tell me. Your stars matched and he got you married. But has anything matched between you after that? Hey, small conflicts are common... ...between husband and wife. Arguments and disappointments are always there. And she's really nice, you know. She trusts me. And more than that she has complete faith in me. What? Come here. Come here! Why were you banging your bangles? Can't ynou speak up? You want me to keep quiet? God! You always keep observing fast and all. Now take her home. Go. I don't want to go. Go! Don't be stupid. Go inside. Brother! - Will you go or want me to slap you? Instead I'll slap you. - What? Go inside. Yes! My God! Done! Your vow for silence is broken now. Anku! My Anku! Subhya! Has Anna selected that teacher for you? You go. If Anna will see you, he'll break your skull. You please go. - But... - Go. Subhya, what are you doing? Why are you coming in? I'm so tensed here. Tell me what happened. Have you decided to die today? - Anku! I love you. And I don't mind if I'll have to die for you. But my rickshaw has started shacking now. Tell me what has happened? I mean has Anna finalized anything? Every wound leads to somebody's death. Bless me! Gurav's house! Gurav's house Who's it? The ghost? Anandi had told me. Who's this? Witch or haunting soul? Save me! Save me! Save me! Anku! - Subhya! Anku! Madam, give me a chance to breathe. Otherwise, I'll die. I don't care. Over will take away his bride to Sawantwadi... ...and that's final. - I'm helpless. Then I'm a labour. So what if I'm a rickshaw driver? I love you. Tell Anna. Our marriage is made in heaven. Tell him to go there and check if he wants. Leave me. Spare me. Oh my! My! My! Subhya! - Yes. I can't live without you. Really? - Yes. - I too can't live without you. Then hold my hand. Now tell Anna that I'm made for Subhya... ...and not for the teacher. Right? Right? Right? Where do you try to escape? Madam! Why do you want to change... ...my physical appearance? You're changing the entire shape of my body. Anku! One could see past in Chandramukhi's mirror. But I can see the future in this mirror. - Really? Yes. See, we make such a nice pair. You spectacled. Ok, madam. You may have the strength of a Goddess... ...but I'm not a devil whom you can kill. God! God! God! Now get ready for beating. Run, hurry up! Run away! Hey... - Anna! - Look at me. Don't shout. - Amruta, what are you doing? Who are you beating? Leave him! - Let me go. What are you doing? He's a teacher. Teacher Kale. He's my friend's son. This girl is too much. - You don't think before you act. And listen! I'm telling you. He'll occupy this room. Silence! Apologies to him. Anna. No need of apology. It happened out of misunderstanding. Once, if she'd come to know that I'm not a stranger... ...her opinion will automatically change. Otherwise, I think many men are destined... ...to be sacrificed by her beating. - What? Take her down! - Amru! - Go! You too come down! It's very difficult to handle this girl. Amu! Listen! God! You've so many forms. Subhya! Subhya! Subhya, where are you? Stupid fellow! God knows who's that man... ...whom he has allowed to stay at home. He was supposed to marry sister Ankita. Hey, I'm not going to marry that teacher. Then sister Amu will marry him. Hey, I'm not going to marry that light weight... ...single body, weak fellow wearing specs. Then what type of a boy you want? I... Solid! And you? - I? I'm happy with the one I've married. And you? - I? God "One, who'd understand what I say." "And also those that I don't." "One, who'd understand what I say." "And also those that I don't." "One, who'd becomes restless if he doesn't see me." "He should be like that." "He should be like that." "One, who would be strong and sturdy." "One, who's stronger than me... ...and can challenge me for fight." ...and can challenge me for fight." "One, who is strong and sturdy... ...and can challenge me for fight." "He should be like that." "I can still see your image in front of my eyes." "I still feel your shadow behind me." "He left me alone in the midway." "Emptiness was left in my world." "Nobody would obtain so much in life." "It requires many virtues." "Even in his absence, I see him in all of you." 'I'll demand unusual things from him at any point of time.' "I'll keep finding faults in anything he'd do for me." "When he'd be disappointed by all that... ...I'll come closer and take him in my embrace." 'And I'll say, why these flowers do not give fragrance? ' "I'll travel across the dream world." "I'll roam around each and every panorama on the earth." 'With hirm in life, I should feel I'rm on the top of the wrorld.' "Nobody should be like him in the entire village." "No need for a sofa... ...his shoulder should be the best place for repose." "His love should shower like raindrops." 'His face should fall looking at ele teacher in the school.' Like a statue of qualities... ...this one is a movable statue of bad qualities. Ratanlal Ramitra Chhajed! A earns the profit on selling our produce. That's his business. Hello, Anna. Even if we see him from distance... ...we, all the mangoes suddenly say this... There comes... let go of it. Why should we speak bitter? Tell me. What made you come to me... ...early in the morning today? I mean, is it about the marriage? We'll see the horoscope later. Let's have a cup of tea first. Mhatba! - Yes. Bring cup of tea for Mr. Chhajed. Anna, I wanted to speak to you about Alphanso. Alphanso? - Yes. Anna, I want all the alphansos of your garden. All? Have your tea first. You know what? People think mangoes do not have horoscope. Actually, everything has horoscope. And not only that. Even the horoscope itself has horoscope. What? - Yes. I'll give you an example. Look, Aphanso falls in your horoscope. Really? - And you fall in my horoscope. - Okay. What does that mean? And both of us are having a cup of tea today. What does that mean? - What? We both fall in the horoscope of Tea. Did you get it? - Is it so? So what do you say about the garden? I've given you. But Anna, Ajeet seems to have a different opinion. You know what, Mr. Chhajed? Different people have different opinions in our family. But who takes the final decision? You, of course. - I? No! He takes the decision. The creator and protector. Brother Ajeet! Brother Ajeet! - What? Anna is dealing our gardens with Chhajed. Anna! Why are you shouting so much? First of all, drive away this lowly fellow from our house. Shut up, Ajeet. He's my guest. He? He's your guest? - Yes. If his business purpose is getting solved... ...he wouldn't mind being your brother-in-law. I'm telling you not to deal gardens with him. So, you want me to let the mangoes rot on the tree? - We'll sell it. Exactly who do you refer to? I'll decide about it. Is that clear? - You? - Yes. If you take the decision without consulting me... ...I'll see to it who dares to pluck the mangoes from the trees. Just a minute! Just a minute! Anna, listen! Both of you decide it among yourself. And then let me know. Right, Mr. Ajeet? I'm not in a hurry. What have you done? You have kicked the wealth coming to the house. Have you seen his daring? And your daughter rejected a nice proposal for marriage. I don't understand why God gave birth... ...to all the evil stars of my horoscope into my family. Anna! Anna, come out of these planets and horoscope... ...and look at the world with your eyes wide open. You've ruined the house. Keep quiet. What made you cry? Nanda, what are you staring at me? Calm her down. How many times I should tell you? Tell her to keep quiet. - Calm down. Keep quiet! Quiet! Nanda! - Now you... - Nanda! What's wrong with you? What's wrong with her now? - Nanda! Anna, have ynou seen wrhat condition ynou've rmade of ourr farmilyn? You're the cause of all this. All the time, worship, fast and vows... ...continue in the house. Is this a house or a temple? Have the sweets. - Don't teach me. Have the sweet! Anna, take the sweet. For what? There's good news. I'll tell you. I tell you something. - Keep quiet, please. Give me six months. I'll give you the results in six months. God! Brother Ajeet too will give the result? That means education is spreading wings. Take the sweet. Take the sweet. Take the sweet. I bought it from the village market. Don't worry. No, it's cheap. It's not too costly. Grandmother is asking the reason of distributing sweets. It was my very first day in school and it was a nice day. Why do you still cry? Anna left my math sum incomplete. Incomplete? - Keep quiet. Quiet. Teacher, adopt her. Teach her. I'll give you two boxes of Alphanso every year. Not only Alphanso, you may give me... ...coconut and cashew-nuts. That's okay. But why tomorrow? I'll start teaching her from today. Not today. The day began with the arguments. Start from tomorrow. 640 PM is the best time to start with it. So, Ms. Anandi, today we'll learn the operations on numbers. I mean multiplication and division. Okay? But, sir. I've a friend. Will you mind if she comes to study with me? No problem. Education increases by sharing it. But, yes, in return, she must give me one coconut daily. Sure, she'll. Sister Amu. I think I've heard this name somewhere. God, she?! She needs beating and not teaching. So, teacher! Are you scared? Are you scared? - I? What will you teach? What will you learn? Mathematics! My mathematics is very weak. My method of teaching is little different. Aye No need of touching. Okay? Otherwise, you'll never be able to... ...count nurmbers on your fingers. Sir?! You need teaching of mathematics. Once it becomes clear, I'll set all your angles straight. If you think you can fool me... ...then you're under wrong impression. Because one needs to have a brain to fool others. Your language makes me understand your history. And also your geography from the subjects you discuss. I very well know, how to make you a good citizen. If you feel that hands can solve all the problems... ...then you're living under a wrong impression. I believe it's unmannerly to raise hands at woman. I can make students do rock climbing in the PT period. I'm down to earth. I'm not a cheap teacher. So, today's period ends here. See you again. Hail India! Hail Maharashtra! Anandi, I liked your friend. I don't mind if she'd daily come and attend my period. I mean, if she wishes to. But she must bring a coconut for me. Okay? When everybody considers her dashing... ...this single body, light weighted, simple looking... ...teacher proved her weak. My entire life was shattering. But you solved all my problems at once. Amruta actually went to teach that teacher a lesson... ...but she herrself fell in love writh hirm. Once Anna returns, I'll give the proposal. Here comes Anna. What? - No. I was talking on the phone. That I'll bring it. I'll bring everything. Anna has come. I'll hang up now. Yes! Now take the measurement first. Shivaji! - Who? - You! I always respect elders you know? Subhya gone mad thinking... ...that Amruta and teacher are already freaking around... ...without much efforts. He started tricks to impress Anna Gurav. But he actually invited trouble in doing so. Listening to you, I feel green is your lucky colour. No. - Start wearing green colour clothes. Yes! And tie a belt in your neck. - Why? Chimes of the bell will knock God's door for you. And God will listen to you. Seeing teacher, getting settled in Gurav family... ...and himself getting failed to impress Anna... ...Subhya started feeling insecure. And he started putting legs into teacher's shoes. That day I felt... ...that you've come to see Anna Gurav's daughter. What are you saying? - Yes, I felt so. But you know what? Freaking out with Gurav's daughter... ...is a game plan. Okay! I must tell you something about your sister Ankita. She's a total flirting type girl. Meaning? - Better be strict with her. What do you mean? - You know what? She flirts with anybody from any village. She's so cheap. That rickshaw driver Subhanrao told me. He said she's like a public transport service. She's like God's offering for all the rickshaw driver. Shit! He said she's like a gong of the temple. Anybody can come and bang it. Teacher told Amruta about Ankita. But what was the result? Subhya had to go through it's punishment. I said that so that Anna would not marry you with him. I purposely told him many extra things. I thought he'd change his mind. But he came and told you. Silly... He's a number one fool. But in all this chaos, Ajeetrao concentrated and... ...continued with his research on mangoes. Along with his honest practice... ...he was also trying his best to get some financial support. I own mango gardens in Vanerwadi. - Okay. By my research, I'm trying to grow a new type of mango. Okay. - I wanted loan to carry on with this business. That's the reason I'm here. Don't underestimate. Out of the 7 jewels of India, 3 were from Konkan. This new hybrid mango, having... ...all the qualities of Alphanso but thrice it's actual size... ...is a miracle of this mango garden. Aphanso! Aphanso! Hey! C'mon, sir is calling you. Listen! Yes. These new saplings of mangoes have come. - Okay. Plant them backside over there. Okay! I'll do that. And come here. - Aye, sir is calling you. If you don't water them... - Aye, sir is calling you. ...It doesn't make any difference. I'm talking to you. But prepare such fertilizer that this time we've six trees... ...next year we should have 6000. - Are you deaf? Right? Now start working. - Aye. - Okay. I'm talking to you. C'mon. I'm calling you since when. Can't you understand? C'mon, sir is calling you. C'mon. Remove your hand. Remove your hand. - C'mon. Remove your hand. Is your sir handicap? Or he can't dare to come and stand before me? Mr. Ajeet! Why are you toiling hard in scorching hard? Do one thing. Let's sit in the AC and talk about business. Kayn? C'mon. If I'll start speaking, you'll sweat even in AC. Let it be. But the business should be first. Mr. Ajeet, you've grown a big sized mango. Now you say that you'll jump in the business. Seeing you many others will jump... ...in the business one by one. Then what about us? You know what? You must grow mangoes. And we'll sell it. If you'll jump in the business, I'll fix you somewhere. C'mon, I'll offer you double amount. Are you trying to bribe me? Or giving alms? Bribe! Mr. Ajeet, why do you up to inviting enmity? You're intelligent. Try to understand me. Remove your hand. - Listen, Mr. Ajeet. Ajeet! Take care of your man. Otherwise, I'll bury him under these trees. Mr. Ajeet. First your trees should survive for that purpose. Mind it. I'm a businessman by birth. I keep account of every small things. No matter how big mango you grow. Finally, it will come to me. Mind it, Mr. Ajeet. C'mon. Mai! Mai! Vegetables! Have you brought the entire market? Yes, otherwise Anna will say that there's no auspicious time... ...to buy vegetables for the net eight days. Teacher! - Yes, Anna. Come! Anna! Your specs. - Great. Anandi's book. And for Amruta. - What? - No, nothing. Nothing. - Please, sit. - Yes. Teacher! - Yes. Do you have your horoscope? My alliance is yet not fixed... ...how can I print wedding cards? Not the wedding card. I was talking about your birth horoscope. Do you have them? - No! Okay! So, do you know the date, time and place? Yes! It happened in past. Time was 1202 in the midnight. And place was my house. So, I came to know the birthtime. But place means not the house. I want to know the village in which you were born. Ambejogayla. - Ambejogayla. Okay, shall I take your leave now? Or will you check my horoscope... ...and tell me whether I should leave or not? Okay, take care of the specs. Otherwise, again in the market... Carefully, teacher. Take this book too. Mai. - Nothing. Today's meal is very simple. I know. Come here. I want to talk to you. I'm working here and... You just come. It's important. Come. Now? - Come. What's so irmporttant? Listen to what I say... For our Amruta... Go! For our Amruta's marriage, I've found a nice place. What? Do you still want to go to the backyard? - No. Any other work here? - No, it's done. - Done? Then leave. She's senseless. So, for Ankita and Amruta... Don't you have computer class today? Go and start studying. You'll get the food on time. Okay? They both are doing it. No need of your help. Okay? You go. Go! C'mon, leave now. Quick. I've thought of a nice place for Ankita and Amruta. - Who? Our teacher! - Teacher? God! Kale teacher? - Yes. Look, I've got his birth time. Once I get his birth date... ...I'll make his horoscope and finalize everything. Right? 49! - Amu! Amu! Amu! Listen! I missed the number. One... two... Amu, Anna is marrying teacher. What? Mai liked the teacher. Hey, are you mad? Anna has decided to get the teacher... ...married with either you or me. Aye! He'll marry me. And if not, I'll abduct him and escape. Matched! Okay, so everybody listen to this good news. After so many years efforts of matching many horoscopes... ...finally these two horoscopes are matching. - Great! Ankita and Teacher Kale's horoscopes have matched. 36 points are matching. Call for the engagement ceremony next week... ...and get them married. Happy wedding of Kale with Gurav. Anna! Happy wedding of Kale with Gurav is fine. But not Ankita. Amruta. - Yes. What did you say? I like the teacher. - I'll give you a tight slap. Yes I too like Amruta. What. You like Amruta? - Yes. What's the use of your liking? You'd like anybody. But the one sitting above should like. The one who makes the pair in heaven. Listen, teacher. It's his decision. He has made Ankita for you. And your marriage is final with her. How can He decide it like this? - Yes. Nothing doing. Anna sir! Here he comes. With key in hand. You? Why are you here? I want to marry Ankita. You think my daughter is available for anybody? So easily you said you want to marry her? Anna! Please accept my marriage with Ankita. Anna! - Yes. I love Subhya. - What? - I'm ready to marry him. Anna, just a minute. Listen! We both are twins, right? Now Teacher liked Amruta. So interchange our names on the horoscope. Wow! She's so intelligent. You think horoscope is like a board of public transport? That you can keep interchanging... ...from one bus to the other? Look at yourself. You look like a parrot with red legs. But, Anna, you told me parrot green colour is lucky for me. I had gone mad. Who will marry his daughter to this joker? Of course, you, Anna! Just shut up! Come here. Teacher! Teacher, let me be very specific. If you want to stay in this house... ...then you must marry Ankita. If you accept, hold her hand otherwise you may leave. Anna! - What? - Move. I accept marriage with Ankita. Hail Lord! "Lord of twelve signs, twelve planets and twelve positions." "He's our Anna. His decision is final." "Keep all the evil stars aside." ' Let mars shadow fall.' "Bless the couple." "Anna's twin sister's marriage..." You love me and wants to marry her? But listen to me. And I don't love you, still you want to marry me? Not just your name, but your intentions too are evil. That's what I was telling you. He wants to have all the pleasures from both the ways. It's not that. What's the use of hitting me? They're twin sisters. Why do we bother about who she's? Whoever comes in front, consider her your wife. Just shut up. - I was just joking. Subhya! You know what your problem is? Your mind has stopped working now. Understood? - I won't spare him. Tell me something. We know them well. Okay? We can go around with our respective ones and fool the world. Then why Anna and his horoscope... ...would create obstacle? And ideal example of a man of Konkan region... ...stuck with God and worship, is our Anna. Anna! - Yes, our Anna. Anna! Why he has to jump into the well? Our Anna. Anna! - Teacher! Teacher, are you chitchatting? - Yes. - Okay. Amruta, what are you doing here? C'mon, let's go home. And you too. - Yes. Return home before it's dark. Yes, I was trying to know... ...the difference between both of them. - Okay. Go home now. I'll take a visit of a garden and come. Ankita, what are you checking in the well? Has anything fallen down? There's a big frog. Yes, a green coloured frog with red legs. Even the animals of Konkan region are strange. C'mon. - I'll come soon. Okay? Don't worry, Anna. Ankita! Which one is mine from these two? Chandramukhi! - Who's this? She's a volcano. Subhya, what are you doing here? Ankita! Slowly! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! She? Sister-in-law woke up. Lie down! Why these bells are ringing? Am I seeing any dream or I'm in the temple? I hope Lord Shankar hasn't... ...send me any message through his cow? Hail Lord! Hail Lord! Sister-in-law, that cow will go to the cowshed. It must me some mice making noise. You go to sleep. Go to sleep! - Lord! God! - I'm dying. Mice... - Get up! Move. C'mon. - But... C'mon... - Mice... Again if you mistaken identifying us. ...I'll punch you very hard. What's wrong with her? - Speak slowly. Otherwise, I'll break your jaw. What all I should keep in mind? Plait! Language! Clothing. Such a big confusion. Look at him! Look at him! This teacher... Aye, Subhyna... This teacher who's from Ambejogayi. You allow him to enter into Anna Gurav's house. And I'm a son of this soil... ...still I need to enter secretly through windows. This is partiality. Shut up! Now, I'll say Hail India! Hail Maharashtra! And stay here. I'll stay here. What are you blabbering? You call yourself a son of this soil? When drunk, you can't even stand properly on this soil. And you want to say hail Maharashtra! Why shouldn't I drink? You left me in the well? Don't you have any respect for me? Shut up! Don't talk rubbish. And never say hail Maharashtra, when drunk. Is that clear? Why shouldn't I say? I'll shout. Hail Maharashtra. Who can dare make me move from here? I'll shout. Hey... You yourself shake when you're drunk and... ...you think you're shaking the entire Maharashtra. Listen, Subhyna. Listen to me carefully. Henceforth, you'll come in a daytime and not at night. And come through the door. Not from the window. Only then I'll marry you. Okay, I'm going. For her sake, I'm going. But mind it. Only I'll come to this house with my rickshaw. Only I. Go away. - Good night. Subhya! - Good night! Good that he left before getting sacrificed. Otherwise, somebody would have caught him at home. This is like our own people have become enemy. Who's he? - Marathawadi's man are like that. Why the bell is ringing? - Nobody is there. Who's he? Who's there? God! Help! I hope the bull isn't released. There he comes. - Who's there? What this sound means? I hope the bull isn't released. Madhu! - Yes. Just check if any bull is released from the shed. No, Anna. Then who's he? - I'm Madhu. You go to sleep. Just keep quiet. Rates will be finalized. Mango rates will be finalized. Tonight at Rane's garden... ...Chhajed sir will organize a meeting. Do come and rest assured. Alphanso of Vanerwadi will get sold. Rates will be finalized. Mango rates will be finalized. Tonight at Rane's garden... ...Chhajed sir will organize a meeting. Subhya! Subhya! Subhash! It's morning. Hey, he's not even in the well. God! It means my efforts went into vain. Hey, done? Okay! Subhash! God! What's here? Ghost! God has graced this soil by coconut trees. But what's this? God has graced this soil... ...by hairy animal in the trunk? Subhya! Subhya! Subhash! Is he dead? Subhya! Not yet? What do you eat? Keep waiting. Shit! Subhya! What's here? Wake up! Wake up, Subhya. Wake up! Wake up! Wa ke up! I thought you're dead. C'mon. Come out. Now I felt fresh. What fresh? I had almost fainted. Do you drink so much? Shit. Fine. Let's have a cup of tea. Tea? Idiot! Forget tea. Look at your condition first. What are you doing here in Gurav's farm? What else I should do? If Anna Gurav had caught me at night... ...he would have killed me. So you slept here at night? - Yes. When you're in trouble, don't fear of any obstacle. I was fortunate that my life was saved. You people of Konkan are very afraid by nature. Why? You people die everyday? No need to taunt all the time. Nature hasn't graced us prosperity... ...but still people don't offer life. In fact they welcome people with love. Then show some love for me too. And get me a cup of tea. C'mon, let's have a cup of tea, teacher. Did you hear some sound? Twice I was tumbling down here. There must be a trunk. People sometimes find God's idol from the ground. I think we too are graced with something like that. Shall we take out something from this? Don't just keep blabbering. Bring that spade. Teacher! C'mon, open it. Open it quickly. Wait! Don't be so eager. This is in our destiny. What's this? - People find gold and wealth from the ground. And what do we get? These torn papers. Are they okay? What's going on? Anku! Idiot! I'm Amruta. What are you doing here? Amruta, see this. God! He's Anna. He's grandpa... ...grandmother... who's he? What's all this? And why this trunk was buried here? It's something regarding mangoes. Yes! That means brother Ajeet must have buried it here. Look at this. - What's that? See this! - Gurkh Brothers. - Idiot! It's Gurav brothers. - Okay. What? - Gurav brothers? Villagers, everybody has different number of trees. But don't worry. I'll give you Rs 1 lac for each 100 trees. If somebody has more, he'll get double. If more than that, he'll get triple. Yes! You won't even be able to calculate it, villagers. Mr. Chhajed! We toil the entire year and look after the trees. We face all the hardship caused by every season... ...to grow and nourish the mango. And beg at a broker like you for Rs1 lac. Why? Ajeet! - Hey... Don't worry. Anna! Anna, don't mind. It's a young blood. It'll use abusive words. Tell me. - Approximately 2000 mangoes grow on one tree. So 100 trees will grow 2 lac mangoes. He'll take 2 lac Alphansos from you... ...and take it to the market. There he'll increase the rate. Double rate for Export. Triple rate for special order. He'll say there's recession in the market. He'll rate the box as per his wish. That means he'll earn Rs.1.2 million after the produce of one tree. And how much will he give us? Just one lac. Do you think we're beggars? Hey, Ajeet. Don't teach us. He's ready to give us one lac rupees, isn't he? You've gold in your hand. Do you know it's value? He earns billions on your produce. Ask him if I'm wrong. I do earn. I'm running a business. I'm not a Marathi man. I'm not a Marathi man. We know the business. Mr. Ajeet. Fine! I'll give ynou Rs2 lac. I don't rmind. 2 lac? I'll kick you if you're seen in this area again. Ajeet, mind your language. Anna, let him speak. It won't increase the rates. Mr. Ajeet, if you know the business, offer them your rate. I don't mind. Mr. Chhajed, why do you take him seriously? Why are you silent? C'mon, Ajeetrao. Speak up. Business is not that easy. It requires brain. How much did you offer? Rs.2 lac. Fine, I too will offer my rate. Rs.3 lac. Please, don't mind, Anna. Look at his clothing. From where will you give therm Rs lac? By worshiping or begging? Alphanso! We've Alphanso. It's gold! Real gold! Mr. Ajeet, now that you've started giving offer... ...you must continue with it. 3 lac? No, Mr. Ajeet. I'm scared. I tell you, nobody can afford to pay you Rs3 lac, And it won't even suit him. My rate is Rs4 lac. Tell me. Will you give it? I'll give it. If the villagers would agree, they'd raise their hands. C'mon! Rs.4 lac. See! They've raised hands. Rs4 lac. Rs4 lac... one... Rs4 lac... two... Rs4 lac... - Rs5 lac. - What? What are you blabbering? Let's go home. C'mon. Go to hell. Are you mad? I won't pay Rs5 lac. And how can I pay this rate? There's no market for it... ...how can I pay it? Now I won't buy your village's mangoes even if it would rot. Give them Rs.5 lac. Let's go. C'mon. He'll give us Rs5 lac? C'mon, let's ask him. How will you pay us Rs5 lac? Tell me from where will you arrange for it? Chhajed left and we also lost money. What will you do now? Say something now. Nanda! - Yes. I hope I'm doing this right. - Yes. Why? No! Just like that. What are you doing? What? - Leave me! - Why? It's Tuesday. I'm fasting. And I'm also fasting ever since I've been here in shed. I want to end my fasting today. Later! - No, now! - Later. But... - Nanda! - Leave me! - I won't. No! No! - What? Leave me. Brother Ajeet! Brother Ajeet! - Brother! Brother Ajeet! - Brother! - Brother Ajeet! I hope you're not seriously injured. - No, I'm fine. Had I been there, I'd have broken his skull. Let it be. Leave it! But are you alright now? - Yes. Everything was fine till now. And suddenly you came in. Yes, tell me. What made you come here? Nothing serious. But we wanted to speak to you. - Yes, tell me. You wish to start with Mango business... ...does that mean it's your family business? Are you mad? You've seen my relation with Anna. - Yes. Guravs are religious people, observing fasts... ...matching horoscopes and reading planet positions. They've nothing to do with Mango business. Then what's this? Will you take a look at this? From where did you find this? In the backyard of our house. It was buried under the ground in a trunk. And look at this book. It's an account book of mangoes. There's detailed information about mangoes. See. These handwritings... These are Anna's handwritings. Mango rates and market addresses... ...everything is written here. But then this fourth person... Who's this fourth person? Only one person can solve this mystry. Whose photograph is this, grandmother? Why are you hiding it? Who's he? - Grandmother? And why is he there in your family photograph? Anna? And who's standing next to him? Grandma, please speak up. Uncle?! - Uncle?! Uncle? Whose uncle? We had an uncle? Real uncle? Where is he now? Grandmother? Grandmother, what do you want to say? Uncle! Anna! One day before Anna were supposed to leave... ...an astrologer had come. He said that Gurav family has no success in business. If you do the business, it'll bring calamity. Bhalchandra, listen to me. - Okay, see you. Stop running after mango. With him? Mumbai! They left for Mumbai? Anna punished himself so severely. Till now I felt he hates my research methods. He has objection for that. But he punished himself and his family. I must speak with him. Brother Ajeet! - Brother?! Brother Ajeet! - Brother?! Stop, brother Ajeet. Brother Ajeet! Take it patiently. Otherwise, nothing will remain in hand. It was just a matter of coincidence. That astrologer said something... ...and accident took place right at that time. Anna got stuck between planets and stars. So also your business. And also our lives. Diamond cuts diamond. I think this astrology itself will change our fate. Teacher! Don't do anything that would bother him by any means. No, Mai. Whatever I'll do, will be for everybody's betterment. Trust me. And see how I tackle this matter in the funniest way. Just a minute! Slowly! Take care! - Slowly! I'll help you. Slowly! Slowly! God! It's so hot! Slowly, teacher! Anna! She's Ankita and she's Amruta. - Yes. They're twin sisters, right? I mean their birth time is same, right? Am I right? - Yes. So, their horoscopes would also be same. You're mistaking, teacher. In astrology, every second counts. But, Anna. Birth place wouldn't be affecting... ...the horoscope much, right? How can you say that? Now take the example... Welcome! Welcome, Mr. Subhash Shivalkar! You're most welcome! Who called for rickshaw? Nobody called for it. I've some work with teacher, that's why I've come. Now that you've come, take lunch with us... ...and then speak to him. Is there anything special today? Quietly sit and eat. Now go and sit there. Otherwise, you'll get a tight slap. C'mon! - Plate. - Here it is. - Okay. Don't act smart. - No. Anna, I wanted to ask you about the effect of birthplace. Forr earmple, Subhyna. If he'd give you correct time and date of his birth. But gave a wrong name of the birth place. Will it change his horoscope? Of course, it will. What are you saying, Anna? Is that so? Place is very important in the horoscope. That means instead of Vanerwadi... ...if he'd write Pimpalwadi, will it change his horoscope? Of course. Teacher! There's a science behind it. But people don't believe it. But how this universe is running? Can anybody say that? No. Anna! Grandma wants to say something. Yes, grandma. What? I shouldn't eat? Then? Shall I go and sit upstairs? Anna, grandma wants to say... that you weren't born here. What? Stop! Grandmother wants to say something else. Yes, grandmother, tell me. C'mon. Ring? Angathewadi? Okay, Anganewadi! No? God! Then? Okay, Kanpur? Kapalmoksha! Hatkarangle? Hatkhamba? Thamba! Sari? On sari? No! Anandi! Yes, she's a jewel! You're right. Ratnadongar Ratnabhat. Ratnagiri. What? - What? Anna, you were born in Ratnagiri. Congratulations, Anna. She's aged now. How will she know? Anna, you were small when you were born. She'd know better. What nonsense? How could I be born in Ratnagiri? Fine. Place doesn't matter. C'mon, everybody have some sweets. Teacher, do you know that... ...birth place plays important role in horoscope? I made my horoscope based on... ...Vanerwadi as my birth place. Now it became useless. It's okay. We'll make a new horoscope based on... ...Ratnagiri as your birthplace. Nowadays computer makes instant horoscope. You just have that sweet. You think I'm a kid? Now you want me to make a total new horoscope with new birth place? It's like darkness under the lamp. Now I'll have to make a new horoscope. Listen! Fools! Relax! Relax! - Are you satisfied? No! Give some rice. - Idiot! "Bear the thrashing rain and the lightening bolts." "Also bear the strong winds and scorching sunlight." "Bear the thrashing rain and the lightening bolts." "Also bear the strong winds and scorching sunlight." 'Face everything. Don't care about planets and stars.' 'Face everything. Don't care about planets and stars.' "We're together. Don't get scared." "Alphanso!" "Alphanso!" - C'mon, brother. What nonsense is this? Brother Ajeet. You must shave your moustache... ...to bring Anna to the right track. When I made a new horoscope... ...all my stars changed. Everything is going to be fine now. Horoscope says, I've success in business. - Really? Yes. "Who will create obstacle?" "Who can dare so much?" "Who will create obstacle?" "Who can dare so much?" How are you, teacher? Where's this photograph? Which one? - Photo! Mai! - Photo is here. - Come here immediately. Tell me something. Can you see father's photo here? What? Yes, Anna! - Why can't I see? What... - C'mon... Put that back to wall. Father?! What happened? Mai! See there, father has come. Where's he? "We'll change everything from our fate." "We're confident." Father, why Anna can't see you? "We're confident." "Alphansos!" "Alphansos!" "Alphansos!" "Alphansos!" "Green and big mangoes will grow from this." "This soil is my mother and the sky, my father." "Alphansos!" "Alphansos!" "Alphansos!" "Alphansos!" "Alphansos!" "Alphansos!" Stick? Stick? Stop! If you'll check your past, you'll find the path to your future. I didn't get you, father. Bhalchandra! - Yes. You lost your confidence by my accidental death... ...and got stuck in the horoscopes. Accident is an accident. Instead if you had patiently continued to run a business... ...my soul would have rest in peace. You stepped back and left me unsatisfied. Can anybody stop living as he has to die one day? You've made your family suffer with yourself. Bhalchandra! Now calm down. And fulfill your duty. Father! Father! You know what? Even if you can see the flowers... ...you can't say anything until it bore fruits. You'll see, Subhya. Not only in this village... ...but you'll see such fruits in the entire Maharashtra. Ajeet! Ajeet! - Let go of Maharashtra, think about the shed. Paste your moustache. Anna is coming. Ajeet! Ajeet! Subhya, move! Anna! - What? How come you're here? You tell me. How come you're here in my shed? Just make a move. - Brother Ajeet Ready? - Hmm... Anna has come. - Ajeet. H mm! Listen to me. Subhya, do you remember what I had told you to do? Check the moustache. It's perfect. Bye! - Okay. See you, Anna. Very strange! What a research? How's your research on new hybrid mango going on? Nice! Are you angry with me? No, Anna. Have I ever got angry with you? You're right. Anyway, but you carry on with your research. Okay? You earn name and fame to yourself and Gurav family. I want to see you reaching skies. Carry on. And if I've been rude to you for some reasons... ...then please forgive me. What are you saying, Anna? - I made a mistake. You can rebuke me if you want. But don't say anything like that. Relax, Anna. Relax! What's this? God! Chhajed! Leave me! Ajeet! - I won't spare him. Leave me, Anna! Leave me. He has set this fire. And it'll burn him now. We'll take away the mangoes. We'll sell the mangoes, Ajeet. We'll sell it. I don't care about the obstacle created by the villagers. You've your father's support. Anna Gurav. We'll take away the Alphansos. We'll take away the Alphansos to Mumbai, Ajeet. We'll take away the Alphansos. What we had planned and what has happened? Now that Anna Gurav is ready, villagers will support him. Then what about us? Never mind. We still have a trump card... ...which will not let a single mango enter the market. Is that clear? Now you just watch the fun tomorrow. Stop! Take this. Take it. Give it to him. The one sitting there. Yes! To him. Give it. Give it. Take it. What do you think? It's bringal? It's Alphanso. It's burnt and scorched Alphanso of our village. One of you is toiling hard for so many hours... ...on research and developing new hybrids of mangoes. He wants to start with mango business for your benefit. And what has he obtained? This? Ashes of his hardship? No! It's not your fault. It's the fault of that mentality. Hey, you don't teach us. You're not local resident. But I'm a son of this soil, right? I'm not a local resident. But do you know the value of the soil of this region? And the Alphanso of this same soil has burnt today. It's not burn, but set to fire. A broker has set it to fire, who wants to grab entire profit. Today it's Alphanso, tomorrow it could be jack fruits... ...cashew-nuts and coconuts. What will you do then? You'll keep blaming each other and die in this life. But remember one thing. It's not Alphanso, but your house is burnt... ...your village is burnt. And if you still don't think over it... ...you too will end like a burnt Alphanso. Wow, teacher. What a lecture! I felt you're a local resident of this region. Am I right, villagers? What a point! I too have to talk about one point. The man of this region is like a mango. Mango. If one mango rots, it leads to rot all the rest. If one is destroyed, all others will meet the same end. And villagers, he's the rotten mango of our village. You... Brother! - Ajeet! Eave hirm, Aeet. Ajeet! Brother! Ajeet, leave him! - Brother, please don't. Ajeet, leave him. Brother! Come here, you idiot! Come here. Leave me! Brother! No, brother. My clothes are spoiled. Never mind. Even if his clothes are spoiled... ...man's conscience should be clear. Anna, your son's intentions are never pure. Shut up! - Chhajed! - You just come here. A family member is ready to spoil his family. Mind your language, Chhajed. Just a minute, Anna. Hold him tight. Villagers, now see this magic. Anna, you too watch it. Chhajed! Anna! What do you think? Your father used to come to meet you? No, Anna! This boy is your father. You make horoscope of the people, right? But your son spoiled your horoscope. Yes. And you're responsible for it. You killed your father. Naturally, your son will do the same with you. And Anna, this is called fate. Yes. And if you don't trust me... ...then listen to it from one of the villagers. Bali! C'mon! C'mon! Now speak up! Will you speak up or want me to kick you? I didn't do anything. Brother Ajeet! Teacher had designed the entire plan. Anna, I'm innocent. C'mon, everybody! You may go! Child! Child! Do you solve the math properly? You should solve the math properly, okay? Your calculations should never go wrong. Once if your calculations go wrong... ...everything gets topsy-turvy. Like your father's life. Like your father's life. Anna! You just leave. I know I'm the cause of your grief. I'm the biggest obstacle in Ajeet's way of business. I'm the obstructing planet of Ankita's life. I'm the reason of Amruta's bold behaviour.

Sir, in the botanical terms it's name is... ...mangifera indica ostoflawa kamaya, microca, rufocostata... ...stimulla auragella tocara filfiliana... ...odoratta zozoillania superba.

Will you be able to supply? Yes! We'll give. Yes. I mean we can give... ...the entire truck full of mangoes that we've right now. - Yes! Next year, we'll supply mangoes of our entire village. Good.

Mother! Mother! Doctor! Grandmother! - Doctor! See this... I had told you, you've a lifespan of 90 years. I had told you. Friends, see this rmiracle of vanerwradi. So, grandmother didn't die. Yes, the reason of her survival... ...could be a topic of argument. But Anna came out of the world of horoscope... ...not completely but little. So this argument didn't become an issue. Otherwise, Ajeet's research has got recognition. Not only on mangoes. But also at home. I mean Nanda has given birth to twins. Baby boys. So Mai and Anandi are getting promotion now. Mai has become grandmother and Anandi, aunt. About village, our new hybrid researched by Ajeet... ...is getting planted by co-operative efforts. Ajeet has reached so high... ...that Chhajed is not even a sand of his feet now. But he's still down to earth. And yes! Subhya also has progressed. With Ankita in life, his family has expanded... ...as well as his business. I mean now he owns four trucks. Now, he delivers us to the big cities. Master returned to his village with Amu. Amu teaches PT over there in a school. Teacher too is on a research these days. Topic. Growing Alphanso in Marathawada. What about Chhajed? We heard that these days he's jumping into Cotton business. Of course, even there, he'll meet another Ajeet. Let it be. Now what have you decided to do? No, wait for some time. We'll definitely meet next year. What? See you in the market.
