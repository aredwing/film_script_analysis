I'm excited to show you. - They are the best products I've ever used. - (COMPUTER BEEPS) Credit card number is 6011-5879-1835-9498. Great. 53141666. And this is more pastel-y but I love them both. - Security code 609. -(PHONE CHIMES) You know it still looks good but, like, it could look better. I'm sorry. Can you try 603? Social security? You don't need that. - Okay, I'll hold. -(PHONE CHIMES) And I was like, "You know what? I'm worth it. " (PHONE VIBRATING) Hello? How's that sound? MOTHER: Yes, we have the new ones. Yes, three? Sure, we can do that. She's not home right now. (WHIRRING) - We have to go to the bank. -(LAUGHS) - These fucking Craigslisters. - MOTHER: Everything's going to be there. - ROGER: Babe. - Yes, I know. - I'm gonna use the van for a little bit, okay? - Tomorrow. ROGER: See you later. Mmm. Yes, that's correct. They haven't made the last eight payments. Okay. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Can you put us last? You will need to be current on your payments to start the modification process. I'm sorry, but... What do we need to come up with to stay in the house? - In English, please. - Excuse me. I'm sorry. Um, to be current? Twenty thousand. (PEOPLE CHEERING) (ENGINE STARTS) (MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY) Fuck, it's so loud. Turn it down. Claudia, turn it down. (MUSIC VOLUME LOWERS) Larry, let's head back. We've got one more. No, we're done. It's already set up. MARISSA: Hey. I thought that was you. Marissa. No, yeah, I remember. You're, like, the last person I expected to see here. Well, how's life? Good. it's really good. I'm not pregnant, I'm not married. - Are you in school or anything? - No, no, I'm not. But I'm sure you... Yeah, I am, it's... Pretty tough. I'm really stressed out about it but I figure, like, -all the work will pay off and... - Yeah. You know, it'll be worth it. Ah... You should come have a drink with me. -(DOOR CLOSES) - Catch up. Hey, I'm going to be right back, okay? I have to go to the bathroom. Okay. (BEEPS) (DOOR RATTLING) (DOOR OPENING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) She's not in the system. Check with Immigration. Now, because of your age and the fact that you have no prior record, the DA is willing to give you probation in exchange for a guilty plea. However, because you were in custody while waiting to post bail, they have placed an immigration detainer on you. After you plead guilty, you will be handcuffed and transported to an immigration detention facility. They'll hold you there a few days or a few weeks until they process you. And then you will be released back into Mexico as a free citizen. You'll never be allowed back into the United States. And if I don't plead guilty? Based upon the discovery that I've seen, they have an extremely strong case against you. PUBLIC DEFENDER: Go now with probation, or you can spend a couple of years in jail and then be deported. Those are the two options. Are you in contact with any relatives in Mexico? - Family? Friends? - Yes. Okay, well, I'll give you two a couple of minutes by yourself. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) MOTHER: It's not your fault. (SNIFFLES) It's my fault. I brought you here. I taught you that... That you were special. - That you deserved the nicest things. - CLAUDIA: Mom, calm down. I'll come back. I'll get some money together and I'll come back. People do it all the time. You think everything is easy, huh? MOTHER: Can you wait, please? Please, don't take her yet. You have to go to your father's house. I need to know you will be safe. (SNIFFLES) BORDER AGENT: Criminal gangs consider you rich targets. They will try to contact phone numbers of your relatives in the US for ransom. Dial zero after making calls on public phones so previously dialed numbers can't be accessed. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (CONTINUES SPEAKING IN SPANISH) (CREAKS) Think your fences can keep me out? - Assholes. -(GUARD SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Hey, girl! Keep moving. Keep moving forward! DEPORTEE: I'll be back. Not to see you. But I'm going to be over there in Chicago in one week. (SIREN WAILING) (DOG BARKING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Friend! Friend. You want some minutes to make a call? You can use my cell phone. I have minutes. Do you need help? (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO) Hey. Check this out. Can you do me a favor? This girl wants to go to the south. (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO) - What's going on? - A checkpoint. Where are you headed? Just ahead, about 10, 15 kilometers. (SPEAKING SPANISH) What's the status here? How many passengers are with you? Seven people. Okay, good. Have a good trip. See you later. Okay, thank you. Sit down. There are things to do. Are you, or aren't you a criminal? There's no in between. Speak! What's the matter with you? She can't understand you, Mama. She doesn't speak Spanish. (MOOING) (WHISTLING) You can't stay in the house all day. (CONVERSING IN SPANISH) What do you want me to do? Well, be patient. Try to understand her. How long are we going to let this go on? As long as necessary. Okay, whatever. ARTURO: Fuck. You speak English? Yes, of course. - Arturo. - Claudia. Claudia. We're gonna go fix fences. Coming with us. How much? Close to $10. An hour? A day. I'll work with him. That's very delicate. Why don't you help me with this? Just cut it like this. Be careful. Put these on. (SPEAKING SPANISH) How many do we have left? From here, four or five posts on this line, and that's it. Okay, let's finish what's left and then we'll go to the other side of the ranch. You should use better materials. Something that lasts. You're gonna start here and you're gonna keep going. The whole south fence needs to be repaired. Then you'll start on the north side. Keeps the cows in, people out. Works just fine. (SIGHS) This sucks. You should have stayed in prison then. Would have been better than this. Well, I can take you back if you want. Get on the horse and... Let's do it. (COW SQUEALS) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Hold her head, please. You wanna get kicked? ANDRES: Stand there if you wanna get kicked. (MOOING) (COW SQUEALING) (SHUSHING) Claudia, take it. (SHUSHING) You see plastic, you pick it up. Is this normal? ANDRES: Yeah, it's the same problem, over and over. Animals are stubborn. They only know one way to be. Even if it hurts them. I don't wanna go inside that house with him. Well, he's your dad. (MOOING) (SIGHS) Thank you. Hey, why is there a checkpoint? Is somebody smuggling drugs, people? No, not people. The military uses it to control whatever is passing through. Do you know someone who can help me get back? Andrs wouldn't like that. I don't care what Andrs thinks. (PHONE RINGING AND VIBRATING) Bueno. Was that Andrs? It's no one. Get to work. (INHALES SHARPLY) (MOANS) Congratulations. I got something. (CLATTERS) (ENGINE COUGHING) -(TIRES SCREECHING) -(THUDDING) (MOANS) (SCREAMS) Stop! Stop! (NEIGHING) You're an American? Arturo. (SPEAKING SPANISH) You going for a jog in the desert, bro? (RICKY SCOFFS) Think he's a good guy, right? (SPEAKING SPANISH) What's going on, Ricky? Why show up like this? Why don't you tell her what's going on? Nothing is going on. Tell her who you work for. In English. Here. Say it. Say it. I work for Ricky. You can call me Rick. You work for me? Mmm? That's not what I heard. I heard you were working for someone else. (SCOFFS) Why would I wanna do that? Look, the truth is that the Sergeant talked to me, and, yeah, he offered me money to give him information, but you don't think I'd do something like that? I'm not a traitor. Ricky, you know I would never do that, right? (SHUSHING) But we're friends, right? (SIGHS) But you know the deal. You mess with my stuff, I have to kill you. And I have to kill la pocha here. We're friends? (CAR DOOR OPENS) (CAR DOOR SHUTS) (ENGINE STARTS) (SNIFFLING) -(ENGINE REVVING) -(CLATTERING) You're gonna tell Ricky that you're gonna help him. Just tell him that you know the ranch. - I don't. - Well, learn it. Listen to me. Just help him get his stuff from one side to the other. Don't tell him, please. Don't tell Andrs. (GRUNTS) (GUN COCKS) I know my way around the ranch. I can make things really easy for you. I like American girls. I'm gonna take care of your truck. RICKY: Be in touch. I gotta run. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon. Nice day, no? What brings you here, gentlemen? I'm looking for Arturo. Claudia. Come here. (SPEAKS SPANISH) Where's Arturo? I don't know. He took your truck. I don't know where he went. You see? He's not here. Are you visiting? She's only here for a little bit. Go inside. Lita needs you. You have a beautiful ranch. A lot of land. Must be hard to maintain. To keep secure. Here, we don't have any problems with the ranch. Excuse me. I have work to do. (CAR DOOR SHUTS) (CAR ENGINE STARTS) Don't let them involve us into their mess. People are always driving through my land looking for a shortcut to the main road. ANDRES: it's always been a problem. If you see Arturo, you send him to me. Fucking reception, man. Okay, Mom. Bye. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Tell her to try it. Make her try it. You're her father. I've eaten a chili before. (PHONE RINGING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) - This is my nephew. -(SPEAKING SPANISH) That's not true. You fixed the truck? RICKY: It's not done yet. Come take a ride with me. Got a meeting. (SPEAKING SPANISH) No, no, no, look, shut up for a second. This is what we're gonna do. You're gonna go to his house. You're gonna tell him to return the money because we already agreed on a price. Under no circumstances are we giving him any more money, okay? Fucking Mexicans. Aren't you Mexican? No, I'm not fucking Mexican. I'm just... I'm stationed down here for a bit. Too valuable for this shithole anyway. You know what I mean, right? I came down here because things used to be so fucking easy. People just took the world as it is. They just took what you gave them, no questions asked. And now, that's all gone. it's a fucking zoo. If you could be anywhere else right now, where would you be? Would you be with me? Or would I be alone? -(INDISTINCT CHATTERING) -(VEHICLES HONKING) (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) I didn't bring my passport. It's all right. You don't need it. Open the glove compartment. RICKY: Hand me those cards. Good. Relax. With the cards, I come and go whenever I want. Good evening, sir. - Where are you headed? - San Diego. It's, um... It's our anniversary. (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO) Have a nice night. Thank you. (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) Yeah, you could make a run for it. RICKY: But then what? I know about you, Claudia. About all of it. You wanna be some poor illegal working shitty jobs? (SCOFFS) Shit, I couldn't do that. But if that's what you want, then go. (DOORS UNLOCK) RICKY: I'm not going to stop you. Or you could help me out a little bit. Do a few runs. Make some easy, easy money. And then I'll bring you back. Think it over. Go grab a cup of coffee or something. Need to have a chat with my dudes here. (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO) (CAR DOOR SHUTS) You just come and go as you please? I still haven't heard from Arturo. There's some food if you did not eat. (SPEAKING SPANISH) You want some more? No, thanks, Mom. (SIGHS) You mind if I come out with you today? (WHISPERING) What did she say? People are sneaking in. Stealing it for food. It all has to go or they'll keep coming. If theyre hungry, why don't you let them have it? 'Cause the cows are hungry, too. Okay, hold it up higher. -(GAS HISSING)) -(PHONE RINGING) Away from your body. Wait. Wait. Wait. Ola. When I was a boy, I used to love setting things on fire. My father asked me to weed his garden, and I burned it all. ANDRES: I didn't mean to bum it all. RICKY: Ready to roll, pocha? Keep doing what you're doing. You know your way around. Just make sure my stuff gets across the ranch. What's the matter? Don't you trust me? - Where's our truck? - Relax. We'll drop it off Don't worry. My dudes are cool. Don't think about it. Just get them through, fast and easy. Yeah, I got it. ANDRES: Lita and I, we committed ourselves to this place. They said that the land was too rocky. That I would always be at its mercy and I would make no money. (WHIP CRACKS) But I'm still here. Everything from the outside can ruin you. If you let it. (MOANS) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Good evening. Good evening. Hands on the wheel. Turn off the car. (ENGINE TURNS OFF) Come on. Get out. Search it. Get out. Sergeant! (INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO) Let her go. Your father know where you are? Yeah. Does he know who you're with? I was in town, and he offered me a ride. Bring back the truck. Come. They sent me here to stop this. Ricky's truck is clean. Okay. Let him go. It wasn't always this way. Some places, maybe. But here, things were always contained. I can help you. Ready to roll, pocha? (LAUGHS) Whatever you were paying Arturo, it's not enough. You want a raise already? (PHONE RINGING AND VIBRATING) This is Arturo's phone. Why do you have it? (CAR APPROACHING) (CAR ENGINE TURNS OFF) Andrs, come! (SPEAKING SPANISH) I've given the Sergeant permission to run patrols on our land. Nice truck! This is my truck. Now, I need you to tell me everything, right now. And don't lie to me. This is my whole life. Don't you see that? ANDRES: I could lose everything. CLAUDIA: He's dead. No. I told you she never should have come to stay with us. Andrs, no. Everything out of her mouth is garbage. If she doesn't know how to be good, then it's your job to teach her. CLAUDIA: Arturo wanted more. There are people who struggle and people who get what they want. I want more. Yeah? Is this what more looks like to you? "Pocha"? - You know what that means? - Yeah, I know what it means. It means you're a fraud. Fruit is either ripe or rotten. Not both. You can stay, tell the truth. Or you take this truck and you go. (ENGINE STARTS) (PHONE RINGING) RICKY: Pocha? What's up? How about that truck? Do you like it? Where are you? (MOANS) Tell me you need me. Tell me you need me. (MOANING) Say it. RICKY: Say it. (MOANING) Say it. (MOANS) Say it. Tell me you need me. (SHUSHING) I need to get out of here. We're almost done. No, I need to get out of here tonight. Everything is set up for tomorrow. What changed? Just one more run. And then we'll move on. And tomorrow you'll take me across? Anywhere you want to go. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Good evening. You can pass. (SPEAKING SPANISH) It's not time for you to go. There are still things you need to learn here. You understand me, don't you? Stay here with us. Sometimes when you love someone, you have to forgive them. Even when you don't want to. You will lose her again. I tried, Mom. Some things can't be fixed. There are only two types of people. Those who care about others. And those who only care about themselves. Which one are you? He's here. Stay in the truck. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Gentlemen. There's a change. A change? What do you mean, a change? Don't fuck with us. There's a change because there's a change, okay. (GUNSHOTS) -(THUDS) -(GASPS) Hey. Come out. We need to talk. (GUNSHOTS) Don't leave yet. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Count the suitcases! -(GUNSHOTS) -(SCREAMING) (GUNSHOTS) (MAN SCREAMS) (ENGINE TURNS ON) (GUNSHOTS) Fuck. - Where's Andrs? -(SPEAKING SPANISH) He went to look for you. (GUNSHOTS) Hey. (INDISTINCT NOISE) Who else is with you? No one. I told you, my family has nothing to do with this. Turn around! Turn around. - He set me up. - Shut up. Good men died because of you. - I didn't know about the others... - Move. Put them in the truck. Put them in the truck. Now. Okay. This is gonna end up bad for you. All of you will be arrested. You and your whole family. -(GUNSHOT) -(GRUNTS) (HORSE APPROACHING) -(GUNSHOTS) -(NEIGHING) (GUN CLICKING) (DOOR OPENS) You should have listened to me. It didn't have to be so messy. (GUNSHOTS) (ENGINE STARTS) (GROANS) (MAN SPEAKING IN SPANISH) This area is under military control. We will open fire. Claudia, what are you doing? (GAS HISSING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GRUNTS) (PANTING) I did this to her. There's a suitcase in the back with some money in it. It's for my mother. Please take it to her. I'm not going with you. (INDISTINCT CHATTER)
