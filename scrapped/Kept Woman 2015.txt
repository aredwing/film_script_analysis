 

                        Ah! OK! OK. We're safe. What did you really think of the play? Well... I love the design of the program. It's.. Oh no! No, I'm serious. This is the real work of art right here. I bet you it was designed by a talented, smart, beautiful woman who's got great taste in men. Come on! We're almost there. No, I can't do it! Oh no! I can't wait to get out of these shoes and into a bath! I love you in heels. You don't wear them enough! I'm sure you'll see them again sometime... next year! Oh my God! We've been robbed. Ugh! What? My grandmother's jewellery. Oh! Stay back! - Give me your wallet! - Just calm down, all right? And your purse! Hand it over! - That ring too. - It's my engagement ring. Either you give it to me or I take it from you! Just give it to him, Jess. You follow me, I start shooting! Oh my God! It's OK, it's OK, it's OK. Oh my God! It's just stuff, all right? At this point, we've done everything we can do. Evan? Hey, Tyler! Thanks for coming, man. I know it's not your precinct. Of course. You guys OK? Yeah, more or less. Just a little shaken up. Yeah, for sure. Did you give your statement to the officer? Yeah, and he just left. Did either of you get a look at this guy? It was just some random lowlife. Yeah, there's a lot of those in this neighbourhood. We're going to the station in the morning to do a sketch. OK. Do you wanna show me where he came in? - Yeah. - Yeah, follow me. What are the odds of actually catching this guy and getting my engagement ring back? It's..it's hard to say. Tyler. I wouldn't get your hopes up, Jess. Do you wanna... Yeah, let's go. Jess? What are you doing? Moving. Her face, when you've been looking for a while Left not a trace that we're underneath the weather And I tried to let go And she slipped away like a little girl But I really wanna make her mine My girl would never say What I need to hear to make it all OK So we try to make nice so the kids won't know For a little while But it really doesn't make it I find you, alone awhile With a heavy hand and a dark-lit smile And a fine time to regret what I still don't know And I really wanna make her mine She wants to know just who I am She wants to know just who I am But she can make you work for the worth that she has She wants to know just who I am All right, I got this one. I got this one. I got this.. Don't have it! Don't have it! - Oh! Whoa! - Don't have it! Don't have it! God! You good? Yeah! - OK. - I got this. Hey, babe! Cheese! No! Come on, smile! - Look at my hair! I look.. You look great. Yay! OK! OK! OK. - We're done! - We're done! Well, we did it. Yes, we did. I just hope we can afford it. We'll be fine. I'll take on some more clients. That'll definitely help. Think how much money we'll save by not getting our stuff stolen. Picture? You bet! All right. What we gonna do about this paste... Maybe you can give to another woman You don't know about that You became so understood I'm not - .. - Awww Ssst..sst Do you hear that? I don't hear anything.. Exactly... Doesn't agree... Actually I hear a little.. Who is that? I don't know Hi! Hi! My name is Simon. I live next door, and I wanted to introduce myself and offer a little welcome to the neighbourhood. Wow! Thank you very much! Oh, my name's Evan, and this is my fiance, Jessica. Hi! I.. Oh! Charmed! Oh, you look like you're coming from someplace fancy! No, uh, work. I lecture at the university. Cool! What do you teach? Men's Studies. I'm so.. Uh, I'm sorry. I thought you were kidding. Technically, it's referred to as "Men and Masculinity." I didn't think there was that much to know on the subject. Jess is just kidding. You got a real little firecracker on your hands, Evan! Yeah, you could say that! You know what? I'm sorry. That was really rude of me, and you are really kind to bring this over to us. Thank you so much. We really appreciate it. Would you, uh... Do you want to come in and have some of this with us? It'll take me a minute to find the wine glasses. I would love to, but I have some papers to grade, and I imagine you have some settling in to do. When the kitchen is ready, we'll have to have you over for dinner. Definitely! - I look forward to that. - Great. - Good evening! - Night! Way to make a first impression, Jess! Aw, come on! It was a joke! Wow! This is a really nice bottle. Well, he's obviously a classy guy. - Oh! - Just like me. Hi... this is it first morning for you Thank you For what..? All of this.. I know moving is not your first choice Don't go on it I'll be go around.. let them little traffic Sure are you Oke for the car? Ya, I'm still stay... I'm working away - ..dinner get ready for you when you home - wow... I'm going home already I love you I love you to.. "We believe in good design" Hey, Oscar! Hey, J! How's life in the burbs? Great! Good for you, man! I don't think I could survive if I wasn't walking distance to a coffee place or a pizza shop. - Yeah, I get it. Thanks. - So, listen. I've got something interesting on the Sierra Marshall case I wanna run by you real quick. No, no. I really have to be focusing on work. All right, but you're missing out! It's kind of juicy! OK! A short break won't hurt, right? What have you got? All right, so, you remember how the original suspect was the brother-in-law, right? He had an alibi, right? That's what the press reported, but guess who got hold of the police report? Mr. Goody Two-Shoes's story has holes in it. - Oh yeah? - Mm-hmm! Ah! Yeah, I know what you're saying, but who would he know that had access to a forensics lab? Who said he needed to know anybody? Jess! Is this thing on? I'm over here! We've been talking about this all day! I gotta go! All right, I'll catch you later. OK. Hey! Hey, honey, how..how was it? Uh, it was brutal! It, um, it was pretty much bumper to bumper the entire way. I'm sorry! I hope dinner's not too cold. I'm starving. It's..it's not, because I haven't started it yet. - Oh. - I'm sorry! I just got caught up with what I was doing. No, that's OK. I'm happy you had a productive day. I'll go whip up a stir-fry or something. - Did you finish your project? - Not exactly. Please don't tell me you wasted an entire work day on one of those missing-persons cases. No, I started on my project, but then Oscar and I might have made a breakthrough. - Oscar? - Yeah! I don't wanna start something, but I don't think it's fair that you're chatting online with some guy all day while I'm out covering the house payments. I realize my name's the only one on the mortgage, but you promised we'd be in this together. You're right. You're right. And we are. It's just the.. it's just the first day. OK, OK. Please, Evan! Give me a half hour. Simon! Oh, hello! Hey! I just wanted to say thanks again for the wine. We really enjoyed it. I'm glad to hear that! Do you have a cellar? Well, how did you know that? Oh, dust on the bottle. I just kind of figured. Hmm! You're very perceptive. Ah! Listen, I hope I didn't offend you with my man-studies joke. No! No, I've heard them all before. OK. Um, well, I also was wondering if you were free to join us for dinner Thursday. I'd love to. Great! 7:30? Perfect! I'll see if I can dig up something else out of my cellar. Perfect! All right, well, I will see you then! - OK! - OK! Bye! Oh! I have to say this is.. this is amazing wine, Simon. Well, I'm really glad that you like it. I just.. I feel kind of guilty pairing it with barbecue. No, no, no, no! Now is the perfect time to enjoy this one. In fact, I fear had I left it in my cellar one day longer, it may have spoiled. Hmm! Besides, I think you're selling yourself short, because this looks to me like some gourmet grilling. Evan does most of the cooking around here. Yeah, it's nothing special. Just simple stuff, really. Things like stir-fries or pasta, anything that doesn't take a ton of prep or... Really? Ah! So you don't cook? I can reheat with the best of them. She makes a mean rhubarb pie. I haven't made one in a while. Tell me about it! Well, you used to make them for me when I did something good. Now, I don't think I've been pie-worthy for quite some time. That isn't true. Well, I'm, uh, impressed. And I don't know how I would survive without TV dinners. They still make those? They're a bit of a relic of a bygone era, I guess, but then again, so am I. I come from a very traditional house. And my father provided, and my mother would cook, And she would threaten to stab anyone who would set foot in her kitchen with a butcher knife! The good old days! You must get lonely in that house all by yourself. Yes. I wasn't always. Oh. I used to live in it with my fiance, but I suppose the white picket fence wasn't for her. I'm sorry. It's OK! I'm sure she's very happy with the guy that she was cheating on me with, so cheers! Well, I..I can't even look at another woman without Jess sensing it. Ah! The possessive type, huh? I think the word you're looking for is "intuitive." Well, she's that too. Did she tell you that she's not only a graphic designer, but also a part-time crime fighter? No, she didn't! It's just a hobby. I'm part of an online group that works to dig up information on old cases. I think I've heard of this. This is a sort of crowdsourced crime-fighting. It's a lot of work that usually leads nowhere. But you are drawn to what you're drawn to, I guess. Absolutely. She also wants to write a book. Wants to? What's stopping you? I haven't found the right story, I guess. Well, maybe your new life will help you discover it. - Maybe! - Yeah! Are you sure he's not seeing anyone? That's what he told me. That's weird. I could've sworn I smelled perfume on him. Well, maybe it's just some fancy cologne. Hmm... maybe. You know, you should set one of your girlfriends up with him. Oh, I don't know. I'm afraid they'd all be too possessive like me. Oh! Come on! When we first started dating, you went into my closet, and you put a bunch of lipstick on all my shirt collars. Oh! Now, why would I do that? Oh, I don't know, maybe to show all the women that I was already taken. Oh! Simon! Hey! Oh! Hi! Hi! I'm, uh, trying to do some gardening, but this worked for my window planters, but do you have anything with a little more heft? The handle on mine broke, and I haven't gotten around to replacing it. OK. Uh, I'll just wait for Evan to get back to the car. Are you making dinner for someone? No. Why do you ask that? I.. That's just a lot of food for a single guy. I hate shopping. So I tend to buy as much as I can at once. OK! - OK! - OK! Well, have a lovely rest of your day. You too! He said he never cooks. Maybe he was inspired by my culinary skills. I'm serious. He..he was being weird. Look, we don't really know him. Evan, he was hiding something from me. What if he's having an affair with one of his students and he wants to keep it quiet? Whatever it is, something is off about him. I can feel it. You need to stop doing this. Stop doing what? Turning nothing into one of your whodunits. That's nice! I'm serious! Look, we have to live here. Unlike everything else in this neighbourhood, Simon's not boring, so maybe you can come up with a conspiracy about someone else. Maybe you could not talk to me like I'm crazy! Jess, we live in a house that we can't afford that I pay for working a job that I hate, by the way, so you could feel safe! I think you can't feel safe anywhere! Who said anything about not feeling safe? Isn't that where this is going? It sounds like it's going to a place where you blame me for a decision we made together. Look! Speak of the devil. - Hey! - Hi! I hope it's not too late. I saw the light was on. No, not at all! I'm sorry, Jessica. I forgot that I had bought another shovel after the other one broke. That's if you still need it. Thank you. Hey, do you wanna..you wanna come in for a drink? Uh, no, I..I have an early class in the morning. OK, well, next time, then. Absolutely! Good night. Good night. You know, there is something off about him. He's nice. Simon! It's Jessica. Are you home? Don't look at me that way. You haven't met this guy. - He's weird! - You're paranoid! He dresses weird. He talks weird. He literally wears his personality on his sleeve, but he has the most boring furniture. It's like he doesn't even live there. And he keeps the drapes drawn as if he's hiding something. I don't know, Jess. I know you get those million-dollar hunches, but, honestly, this doesn't sound like a whole lot to go on. But it all seems a little off, though, right? Right? Yeah, but if being a little off was a crime, we'd be having this conversation in jail right now. You're starting to sound like Evan. Uh.oh! Trouble in paradise? Oh, he's just stressed about the mortgage, and he thinks I should be spending more time working, which he's right about. All right, look, I can see this is stressing you out. Do you want me to check into this guy? No. No, it's fine. All right. Call me if anything else comes up, all right? I will. All right. Chin up! Night! Simon! It's Jessica. Are you home? Hello! How are you? Jessica! Simon! Are you busy? No, just trying to slog through this design project. I found something that I think you're going to like. Um, would you like to take a break and pop over? Uh, sure! Great. See you soon. Bye! Hi! Hi! I like your place! That's right. You haven't actually been inside before. Nope! Well, if you come to the kitchen, here's where your surprise is. OK! This reminded me of the one you were wearing the other night, so I had to buy it for you. I can't accept that. You don't like your present. I do! No, it's OK. I just have one other thing to show you. I really should be going. It's OK. You can stay. This won't take... ...30 seconds. Simon! It's Jessica! Are you home? So, when I saw you looking into my house like this, I realized that you wanted to be here with me... and that it wasn't me choosing you. In fact, it was you choosing me. Hi, Jessica. Who are you? My name is Robin. Where am I? Home. What's the code? Only Simon knows the code. What are you doing? What is this place? It's OK. You're safe down here. What do you mean down here? Is this Simon's basement? Yes. HELP! - No one can hear you. - SOMEBODY HELP ME! Please stop! It just makes him more angry! Shut up! Shut up! HELP! SOMEBODY HELP ME! Please stop! Please! Please! Jess? Jess! Hey, hon? I'm home! There has to be a way out of here. Oh, please! You have to stop this! You're gonna have to clean all this up. HELP! HELP ME! SOMEBODY HELP ME! No one can hear you. Just come back, Jessica. It's gonna be a whole lot easier that way. HELP ME! SOMEBODY HELP ME! I do realize this is going to take some adjusting. It's going to be much easier if you just accept that this is where you're meant to be. What do you want from me? I just want us to be happy. Oh yeah! You can try and kill me if you like, but you will die down here with me, buried like an Egyptian slave with her pharaoh. Oh, and if you try and don't succeed, that would be a whole lot worse. Isn't that right, Robin? Why do you have my suitcase? You packed it when you walked out on Evan. Hey! Where are you? Listen, I'm gonna apologize to your face again, but I'll just say sorry to your voicemail for now. I was an ass yesterday, so I came home early to make it up to you. Anyway, I'll, uh, I'll see you soon. How'd you get here? The same as you. Simon chose me. He chose you. From where? He was one of my professors. Simon said he knew... that we were meant to be together from the first moment that we met. How long have you been here? I don't know. A few years. Years? We have to get out of here. No, we don't. This is where we're meant to be. You're telling me you never tried to leave? When I first got here and I was still... confused. But the codes are always changed, and if you try to leave, bad things happen. What did he do to you? He just made me understand how much he loves me. Hello! Hello, Simon! Here's a drink for you, darling. So, I brought you some new clothes... I really wanna see you wear. Did you bring me anything? No, not this time, darling. I was focusing on making Jessica feel welcome. You understand, right? Of course. And I got you something else that I think you're really going to enjoy. Huh? What am I supposed to do with that? Write your book! I wanna support your creative ambitions, and this is a place where you can commit to them fully without having to worry about any of the things that women shouldn't have to worry about, like paying a mortgage, If you think you can hold someone captive but make them happy by buying them an old typewriter, you're crazy. What's crazy is the world out there. It's full of lost and weak men and overburdened woman, and this is our place where we're righting those wrongs. By keeping us prisoner? You've never been more free than you are now. You just don't know it yet. - Isn't that right, Robin? - Yes! I don't know what you did to her, but that'll never be me. Oh! Well, dinner's ready! Dinner's ready. Mm.hmm! All right, then! Jessica, why don't you.. No, Jessica there, you there. Why don't you come join us? Well... As this is your first night, I'm gonna allow you some leeway. But in the future, when I ask you to do something, I suggest you do it. Evan! EVAN! YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL THAT THIS ROOM'S SOUNDPROOF, 'CAUSE IF IT WEREN'T... EVAN! ...and he heard you, then I'd have to kill him. Evan, hi! Hey, Simon! Um, sorry to bother you. I'm looking for Jess. Have you seen her, by any chance? No. No. Is everything OK? Yeah, it's just she's not around and she doesn't have her phone with her. Huh! I spoke to her earlier this afternoon. Oh, so you saw her? No, no. We just chatted on the phone. I mentioned I was going to pick up some groceries and asked if she wanted me to get her anything, seeing as how you're without a 2nd car. What did she say? She said she didn't need anything. To be honest, um, she seemed a bit upset. Do you know what time that was? Uh, about half past 2:00. It's just weird. She doesn't go anywhere without her phone. Maybe she went out exploring the neighbourhood. Yeah, maybe. Um, well, sorry to bother you. Yeah! That part of your life doesn't exist anymore. It'll be best for everyone if you put it out of your mind. Nah, I'm sure it's fine. I'll have her call you as soon as she gets in. All right. So, she packed some clothes? Yeah, but she..she left stuff like her phone and her toothbrush. Well, maybe that means she doesn't plan to be away for long. Yeah, but where did she go? I mean, it just doesn't make sense. How's everything going between you two? It's going fine. Some tension with the move. Tension in what way? We had a blowup yesterday over, you know, money and work. That kind of thing. So it was bad? Bad enough that I slept on the couch. And you were still fighting this morning? I left without speaking with her. But it's not like Jess to just run away like that. What about the time in Puerto Vallarta? - That was different. - How? It was before we were engaged, and I screwed up. Did you screw up again, Evan? No, I didn't. Do you think she might have somebody else? No, there's no one I can think of. What about those wannabe detectives she chats with online? Yeah! She does spend a lot of time talking to those guys. Especially, there's this one guy named Oscar. Just Simon? It's my fault - That isn't true - It is Simon told me not try to escape but I didn't listen It's Oke If he doesn't know Oscar Garrett? Yeah? Sorry to bother you so early. I'm Officer Haynes with the NYPD. This is Evan Crowder. Jessica's boyfriend? Fianc. You know where she is? No. Has something happened to her? She hasn't been heard from since yesterday afternoon. I thought you had to be missing 24 hours before the police got involved. I'm here as a friend. Can we come inside? So, uh, what did you two talk about? I mean, a bunch of things. Like? Mainly this new case I've been working on. Did she say anything that might indicate she'd be going away? If anything, it was the opposite. She was complaining about not being able to go anywhere because of the car situation. She also... Oscar, we just wanna find out what happened to her, make sure she's OK. She said there was some tension at home because of money and stuff. Did she confide in you about anything else? Is there..is there somebody we should talk to? She was a little suspicious about your new neighbour, Simon. What do you mean by "suspicious"? She just had a bad feeling about him. She thought he was lying about having a woman at his place. - That's it? - You know Jess! This is my number in case you think of anything else or if Jessica tries to get in touch with you. Cool! I'll dig up what I can on Simon and keep you posted. Thanks, but I'll handle the police work. Yeah, OK. Gentlemen! Good morning. Hey! This is Tyler. He's a friend, and he's also a cop. He's helping me try to find Jess. She didn't come back home last night? No. Could I ask you a couple of questions? Of course! You spoke to Jessica an hour before she went missing? That's right. Like I told Evan, I called and asked her if she wanted anything from the grocery mart. She said she was fine, seemed a little upset, and that was about it. Do you live here with anyone else? No. Are you seeing anybody, a girlfriend? Why? Uh, Jessica expressed concern that you'd lied to her about having someone else in the house. She, uh, she was suspicious, something about extra groceries. I'm..I'm sorry, Simon. No! She's right. I did lie about the groceries. I was having someone in that night, and I wanted to be discreet. Why? She was one of my grad students. But I like Jessica, and..and I didn't want her to think badly of me. I'm..I'm sorry, Simon. No, no, no. If I were you, I would be very worried. I just hope that you find her. Thanks a lot. If we work together, we'll find way to escape Please don't talk about that Can he hear this? I don't know Robin, this isn't your home. You don't understand. Robin, you're a prisoner, and we need to get out of here. You don't understand. I do. I understand just fine. You need to listen to me. I think if we can have a plan, we can get out. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - No! No, no! This is where I'm meant to be! This is where we're both meant to be. OK, OK, OK. I need you to write down your email address and your password. No. I'm not gonna repeat myself again. Write down your email address and your password, please. Want me to tell you what happens if they're wrong? It's right. Now, I'm gonna be back tonight, and when I am, why don't you be wearing one of those dresses I bought you? Dear, Evan. I'm sorry. I thought moving would fix things, but instead, it just revealed the bigger problem between us. I don't need any money. I've met someone who understands me and is taking care of me. I just want to move on. I'm sorry this is abrupt, but I hope in time you'll agree that this was the most humane way for me to end things. I don't expect you to understand, but this is what I want. Please don't try to get in touch. Jessica. Six years! No discussion? Just gone? It doesn't make any sense! Do you think she could've gotten mixed up with drugs or gambling? No! No, man! Yeah, but then again, I had no idea she started seeing someone else. "I've met someone who understands me." What does that even mean? Did you email her back? Yeah, a couple times. Still no response. OK. I hate to tell you this, but you need to take out whatever cash you have in any joint accounts. All the cash I have went into this house. How could she do this to me? OK, show us the next one! Oh, come on! Don't be shy! Whoo! Oh! Turn around. Yeah. Oh, I think that's the one. What do you think? Definitely, yes! This is like your glass slipper. Mm-hmm! Do you like it? I asked you a question! What do you want me to say? I want you to be honest. OK. I wanna go home. Unfortunately, there's nowhere else for you to go anymore. What are you talking about? Evan received your email, and he acknowledged his limitations as a romantic partner, and he accepts that this is the best thing for you from now on. You're insane! ? Still I have to say? ? That I'm the only one for you...? Don't you ever talk to me like that. Oh, this is definitely the dress. - What do you think? - Mm-hmm! You know, what might be nice is if you ask Robin to help you with your hair and your makeup. Do you mind? - No, no. Not at all. - Great! And maybe Robin could use a break. Why don't you cook tomorrow night? He doesn't mean to hurt you. How can you defend him? Simon loves me! Us. ? I guess you'll never know? ? That I'm the only...? Well, that smells lovely! What are we having? Roast! Hmm! You look very nice, Jessica. When someone gives you a compliment, it's polite to respond. Thank you. And I have a little surprise for you too! I got you some of the stories I know you like. Maybe it will help stimulate your writing. - That was nice of you to think of me. - Of course! How's the drink, darling? It's fine. Jessica, it looks like you went all out. I'm not sure how it'll taste. Well, I appreciate the effort. You made it. Why don't you carve it? Well, would you look at that! Oh! No! Stop! Oh! I'll give you a choice. You let me go, and I give you my word.. How about I give you a choice? You give me the code to the door, or I'll torture it out of you. I'll die before I tell you, but you'll die down here with me, both of you. - Tell me! - No! What is it? Please don't hurt him! Shut up! Tell me now. The reason I'd rather die is because I don't wanna live in a world without you. That's how committed I am! I love you! Then I'm gonna give you a choice! Do you want me to cut out your left or your right eye first? Hmm? Last chance. NO! Robin! Stop! You need to accept it. This is your fate. How are you feeling? Leave me alone. Sorry if you feel like I betrayed you, but you were going to destroy our home. Stop calling this a home! You would've ended up like Megan if I hadn't stopped you! Who's Megan? The girl who was here before me. She couldn't find love in her heart for Simon, and she kept trying to run away. Did he kill her? Robin, did he kill her? No! I did. It was my punishment. I didn't try hard enough to stop her. I can't go through that again. Evan! Hey! Hey! What happened to your head? I took a spill on my bike. Well, it looks like you hit a brick wall. I hit the asphalt. I'm OK, though. Any update on Jessica? Nothing. And how are you holding up? Not good. You know, why don't you come over for a drink tonight? The ball game's on... Oh, I don't know. I insist! It would probably do you some good to get your mind off things. Yeah, sure. Why not? Up to bat is Shawn Martinez... Thanks for this. I've basically been pacing around that empty house, making myself sick. When my fiance and I broke up, we dragged it out. It was so long, so painful. There's no use. He won't be able to hear you. I have to at least try something. Don't you get it? This is just another test! All it's going to do is make Simon have to hurt you again! I almost think it would've been more humane if she just left like that. Hmm! Nothing about this feels humane. I don't know whether or not to feel angry at her for running away or like a fool for not seeing it coming. Well, angry feels better. Hey, you got that right! Mind if I get another? Please help yourself. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no! No, no! The best thing you can do for both of you is to just forget him. No! So, here's the deal. If you try to escape again, I'm not gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill Evan. Maybe you don't value your own life anymore, but I trust that you still value his. So, are you gonna be a good girl from now on? Mm-hmm. Let me hear you say it. I'll be good. That's what I like to hear. Now come show me. ? I remember the day? ? That I met you? ? Hand in hand? ? We strolled through the park? ? Then all of a sudden? ? You kissed me? ? And you started a flame in my heart? Ow! ? There were tears in your eyes? ? When you whispered? ? That nothing would ever? ? Cause us to part? ? But no matter, darling? ? What might happen? ? I shall always? ? Have that flame? ? In my heart? Hey, Evan! Hey! Wow! Heading back to the city, huh? Yeah, it's been a couple months since Jess took off. Figure it's time to get on with my life. Can't say I blame ya! Besides, I can't afford this place on my own. When do you leave? As soon as this place sells. Can I have a wooden spoon? Is something wrong? Do you really care? Of course. That's why I asked. Last night was supposed to be my night. What? With Simon. You've been with him 3 nights in a row. You act all innocent, but I see how you flirt with him, playing hard to get. You don't know what you're talking about. - Really? - Yeah. What I do know is things were a lot better before you showed up. I didn't have a say in that then, and I still don't now. Hello, Simon! Hello! Ah! Jessica? Hmm! How was your day? Did you get all your papers graded? Almost. A poorly written essay can be a real slog. I can help you with that sometime, if you'd like. I do have my English degree. Hmm! I'd appreciate that. Here's a drink for you, darling! Go ahead. You sure? Please! Excellent, Jessica. Don't you wanna read something? I think I'll just go to sleep. Hmm! Is something wrong? It's Jessica. Go on. She told me today that she still loves Evan. It takes longer for some people to move on. Not only that. She told me that she's just pretending that she wants to be here and she plans on trying to escape again. How do you know this? She asked me to help her. I see. I know this hurts you to hear... but she just doesn't love you like I do. Thank you for telling me. What are you gonna do about it? I'm going to address it! Jessica, wake up! Jessica, wake up! Get out here now! Is everything OK? No, no. Everything is not OK. Go! Robin told me that you confessed that you were still in love with your ex. - What? - And she said you were gonna plan another escape. No, but why would you say that? - Because it's the truth! - Simon... She's lying! I'm disappointed. And frankly, I'm a little bit surprised, because lying is the one thing that I cannot abide! Lying is a cancer for families, and cancers need to be cut out. Oh! Why? She had lies in her heart. How did you know? I'm the head of the household. It's my job to know everything. I feel like something's changed with us, like you're starting to see things the way I see them, and I couldn't take the chance that she was gonna hurt you! You understand, of course, that I did this for you? I do. So, could you put on some music? And then go in your bedroom, and make sure the music's very loud. Haynes. Hi! I don't know if you remember me. My name is Oscar Garrett. You spoke to a while ago about Jessica Crowder. Right. What can I do for ya? I'm assuming there hasn't been any contact with her. No, nothing. Well, I might have found something. Sure! You remember I told you Jessica was suspicious of her neighbour, Simon? I already spoke with him. I reached out to my network to do some digging. We started off crosschecking lists of missing women against students at schools where he taught. There's been at least one at every school. I'm, uh, I'm sure you could say that about a lot of teachers. Uh-huh. But how many of those teachers lost their last job for having inappropriate contact with one of those same missing students? Do you have proof? HR records at a college he taught at in Connecticut show that he was disciplined but allowed to resign. Was he a suspect in her disappearance? The Hartford police questioned him, but they had nothing concrete, so they had to let him go. How did you get access to this? Don't worry about that. I don't know if this is admissible or enough to get a warrant, but at least-- Don't worry about that. All right, I'll send you everything I got. You should get it now. Thank you. Good luck. ? I can't stand the pain? ? That feeling of losing again? ? Am I starting to see? ? All of my destiny?? ? 'Cause no mater what I try...? Isn't it a little late for a visitor? I'll be right back. Would you leave it on? I'd like to watch you. Oh! Hello! Hi, sorry to bother you so late, but I have a few more questions about Jessica. I don't know what I can tell you that I haven't already. Do you mind if we talk inside? Please! You've got a lot of space for somebody who lives on their own. Well, I appreciate the room after so many years of living in cramped apartments. Do you mind if I look around? Be my guest. Evan's lucky to have a friend like you on the police force who's willing to go above and beyond to help him out. I just wanna find out exactly what happened to Jessica. It was my understanding that she chased off with some other fellow. That's a theory. Well, then I'm not exactly sure what that has to do with me. Well, like you said, just going above and beyond. Are you still seeing the same girl? Your student? No, no, no. We broke that off. I thought it would be smart to end it before anybody found us out. Unlike, say, what happened at Hartford. I assume that you're referring to Robin Simmons. You didn't think it was worth mentioning that you'd been questioned in a woman's disappearance before? When you stopped by, Jessica had been missing for less than a day. I didn't see the point in dredging up an embarrassing chapter of my own history over what I assumed was nothing. Tell me what happened in Hartford. I was just one of her professors. Just one of her professors who was sleeping with her. I was cleared of any wrongdoing. So, did they ever find Robin? No. Well, that's tragic. Yes, it is. Oh, you've got quite the collection! Thank you! Yes, I do like to collect fine things. Please don't touch those bottles. They're very rare. I'm sorry to rush you, officer, but I have an early class in the morning, so unless you have any further questions... Yeah, do you know a woman named Megan Carswell? Who? She used to be a student of yours a few years ago. Now, I don't if you slept with her, too, but I do know she went missing. That name doesn't ring a bell. And why does that not surprise me? You know, the thing with guys like you is that you think you're.. I'm sorry. Did you kill him? It's OK. It's OK. You did what you had to do. Do you really believe that? I do. But he came here looking for you. I don't wanna be found. I wanna stay here with you. You aren't just saying that? Nobody would ever do for me what you did, not even Evan. I know that now. I wanna believe you, but I don't know if I can. What can I do to show you? I'm not sure. Your house sold quickly. I'm pretty much giving the keys back to the bank, anyway. Movers are coming tomorrow. Hmm! You must be keen to put all of this behind you. Oh, hey! Did they find anything out about your friend's murder? No, nothing at all. They said it could've been a robbery, but they don't know for sure. Yeah. You've had a tough couple months. I'll be sorry to see you go. But getting some distance will probably be the best thing for you. I hope so. Thanks for everything, Simon. Will you come with me, please? Where are we going? There's something I want to show you. Upstairs? Stop there. And now to your right. What are we doing? Shhh! Keep going. Keep going. Stop. I want you to come stand right here. Hmm! Evan sold his house, and he's moving back to the city. How does that make you feel? I feel bad for him. He must be sad. He was confused, but he'll eventually move on. I just wish there was something we could do for him, a gesture. I do still have a bottle of wine that he likes. It's not much, but.. It's perfect. I'll bring it by tonight. Thank you. Well, I'll let you get back to your packing. Uh, thanks again for the wine. I really appreciate it. It's my pleasure! Ah! And, uh... stay in touch. For sure! Hey! And if you hear from Jess... You'll be the first to know. Good morning! Wow! I really passed out. Yes, you did. I'd like to bake you something special. What? How do you feel about rhubarb pie? I love it. Tell me what you need, and I'll pick it up. Hello? Hi, Evan! This is Oscar, Jessica's friend. If you're wondering, I haven't heard from her. I'm calling about your friend, Officer Haynes. I've been out of town, and I just heard about his murder. What about him? Thing is, I'd spoken to Officer Haynes earlier that night. You did? What about? Your neighbour. I hope you're hungry. Oh, that smells delicious! Um, would you mind grabbing me a fork? Well, we're having a picnic. You have to eat with your hands. You should try it while it's still warm. Oh! All right, all right! Sorry, the crust is a little oily. It's perfect! I'm glad you like it. What do we do? We wait him out. Jess! Jess, you here? Rhubarb pie. Jess! I know you're here! You lying bitch! You did this on purpose. - What do you mean? - I'll deal with you later. What are you gonna do to him? You should worry about what I'm gonna do to you. Yes! OK, OK! You're gonna have to kill me, 'cause I'm done. No, I'm just gonna make you wish you were dead. Jess, don't! Don't! Don't do it. So, you sure you wanna do this? I don't want to, but I need to. I really think I should come along. Thanks, but this is something I have to do by myself, OK? I love you. Bye. I love you. What are you doing here? I wanted to see you locked up. I appreciate you speaking for my not receiving the death penalty. You think I did that to help you? I want you to spend the rest of your life living like a prisoner. Is that why you're here, to torture me? No. Just an added bonus. Then why? I wanted you to know that you never broke me. I only made you think you did so you'd let your guard down. I don't care what you think about women. I'm smarter than you. Oh, that reminds me! I brought you something. You, uh, inspired me to write my book after all. And I hope you like it. It has a happy ending... for me, anyway.
