 

                        1 Police. Stop. Fuck off! - He's got me! - Fuck, we gotta get across my end. Next time, we need a getaway driver. Why did you park the car so fucking far away? Shit! He's right on our ass, mate. Put your foot down. Keep it running. Oh, watch out! Sometimes life deals you a bad hand. This game we all play turns ugly and people get hurt. Fifteen years ago, people got hurt. And it was down to us, down to me. When you're the wrong side of 45, and you've done time, life's not easy. You don't live, you survive. But survival is not enough for me. When you've felt the highs and tasted the rewards, everything else just feels like treading water. I may not have ever earned an honest living and money isn't the key to happiness. But when you've got nothing, you crave like a junkie craves a hit. Scrabbling for enough to live is the only incentive anyone needs to think outside of the law. It just takes guts and an opportunity. Mitchell was my right-hand man. My partner in crime, literally. We grew up on the same estate, went to the same school, stole our first car together. Mitchell, to the register, please. Mitchell, to the register. I haven't seen him since we went down. From what I've heard, he's as fucked as I am. We haven't got a hope and hope is all we need. Pint, please, mate. Make that two, please, mate. I'll get these. Floyd. What the fuck are you doing here? I came to find you, dickhead. How are you? Yeah, fine. Yeah. Why are you really here? We haven't spoken in what... 10 years? It's 15. Look... Are you happy? Are you comfortable? You're having a laugh. I work in a fucking pound shop. I've got fuck all. I did seven years for what happened. I only did four. Yeah, well, you showed a bit of remorse, didn't you? I was young and stupid. Mitch, it wasn't our fault. We may have caused it, but we didn't plan it. You've done your time, it's over. Yeah, maybe. Look, now more than ever, I wish I lived a normal life. But we've burnt our bridges. There's no turning back, Mitch. Look at us two, scraping by on nothing. I want more. Yeah, I want more and all. But it ain't gonna happen. We can't just start again. We can't pull any jobs anymore 'cause we don't know how. You need a computer degree to understand shit these days. Banks are the only places who got cash. And the security systems are so sophisticated, I would not know where to start. What if I've found somewhere? Somewhere that we can do. Where? It's in town. It's a shit load of cash and very little in the way of security. What? Guns and masks? Exactly, an old school blag. We can do it. Well? We don't do this anymore. We don't even know each other anymore. I get up every... Every morning. I spend half an hour just cursing my back. I'm popping more pills now than I did in the '90s. Fine. Then spend the next 10 years at the pound shop. It's your call. It's not my call. It's all there is. I don't want to live like this. Then help me. We can do this together. One more job. Then we can just get the fuck out of here. Spain, Florida, you name it. What, you're off? We'd have to. I've got no one to stay here for. Have you? No. No one. How much? - What, the take? - Yeah. Half a mil. 500 grand. 250 each? We're gonna have to pay a driver. I'm not cutting anyone else in. You know someone? I do know a guy who'll do it for 10 grand. He doesn't want to know any details. He just drives. Where'd you find him? He was recommended. Plus, he's got a place where we can lay low overnight. He's good. I'd have to check him out. Oh, fuck it. I've gotta get back to work. Don't worry about it. Look, I'll meet you later. Uh, well, I finish at 6:00. All right? This company deal in cash loans. You've probably seen them on TV. Yeah. Yeah. 4,000% assholes. That's the ones. Now, most of it happens online but the poorest people, the ones who really need these loans, they haven't got the Internet. And if they have, it's probably been cut off. They go into the stores and collect the cash. This is the head office. It all comes here - into a float. - Hmm. What, a vault or something? It's a small vault. A simple double key lock. Now, they have got a time delay. How did you know that? I've been watching the place for weeks. Every Monday afternoon, 4:00 p.m. one or two blokes turn up with cases and go inside to deliver the cash. Now, the cases are strapped to their wrists, but they're not using security. They're only moving small amounts of cash at a time, just topping up the float. I've been asking around about this driver geezer. No one's got a clue about him. How did you find him? Right, I'll be honest with you, Mitch. He found me. But he checks out. Right? And the fact that he hasn't got a reputation just means that he's careful. I mean, who wants a reputation as a crim? All right. Assuming I'm in, - when? - Two weeks. You need to quit your job. Right, if you don't turn up on the day, it'll just look bad. In fact, get fired. Start fucking things up, it'll look much better. Yeah, that's easy enough. We got to get it right. No... - No fucks ups. - No fuck ups. No fuck ups. Big one, Mitch. You ready for this? Fucking ready. Let's have it. Let's fucking have it. No fucking about. Shut up, you fucker! Put it down. Stay where you are. Stay nice and calm. Right, who's in charge? It's him, in there. You! - Oi! Oi! You! - Armory. Armory. Out here. Right, come on. You're taking me down. Go that way. You watch them. Right, everyone, stay calm. Get your hands off that. Be back, first thing. Thank you. Sit down. Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up! You! Oi! Keep moving. Keep moving! Do not even think about touching the phone. All right, stop looking at me, just move. Come on. You know we all wanna go. Get it open. Look down, shall we? Cunt. You're the robbing bastards, not us. Thank you very much for your cooperation, ladies and gentlemen. Have a pleasant day. Come on. - Half a million. - Half a million. Oh, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, oh, yeah! Nice one, mate. Thanks, mate. Good work. You're welcome. Look, I stuck some bedding in there. I think there's everything you need. If there's any problems, give me a shout. But you two need to be gone by the morning, all right? - We'll be gone by then. - All right. What is this place? Why has he got it? He's done well for himself, I guess. This come with the house. Yeah. I suppose. We can trust him though, yeah? He's not gonna fuck us over, no? He's just got 10 grand. Why would he wanna fuck us over now? Stop worrying. What did you do when you got out? Of prison, I mean. Where did you go? I had nowhere to go. I went back to robbery. How long before your next job? Fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes? You fucking nutter. Eighty quid they gave me. Eighty quid to start your life over again. What are you supposed to do with that? I did a post office. Were you armed? I had a cucumber. A fucking cucumber. Couldn't you find... Find a banana? I had a banana but the cucumber was much more intimidating. Semi-automatic cucumber. Where's the fucking money? Where's the fucking money? Where's the money? Wake up. Where's the fucking money gone? What the fuck's going on? Fuck! Ah. What have you done with it? Was about to ask you the same fucking thing! I told you not to trust him. It'll be that fucking driver! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck it! A long time ago, you ruined my life. Finally, I have the chance to make you feel what I felt then. I have your money and if you want it back, you're going to have to pay for it. There's seven cases. Each of the cases is being looked after by someone you know. Each of these people has an explosive attached to them. The explosive will detonate if you don't get to them by the time I allow you. To defuse the bomb is easy. Just get to the location and the timer will stop. There's no tricks, on that I promise. But each of your acquaintances also has another problem, which is the real dilemma for you. You will need to decide what is more important, your friends or the money. I'm going to make it easy. The phone I've left for you has the first location programmed into the sat nav. I'll know as soon as you leave the clock starts then, but don't leave it too long. This is fucked up. Who was he, on the tape? It's Lawson, it must be. I didn't recognize him. It's been 15 years. What do we do now? We gotta get that money back. We play along, see where it goes. Yeah, all right. Get hold of that driver again. We could use him. He'll want paying again. It doesn't matter. He's got a motor. We don't. He's quick. Here, use this phone. There's an address in the sat nav. We need to get there. The key is speed. The faster we get there, the better. Fast ain't a problem. Same rules as before, chaps. I don't wanna know anything. I just need to know where we're going. Just get us there as quick as you can. What happens when we get there? What do you think? I've no fucking idea. What I do know is that we have to be careful. Fuck! That's Richie. He's... He's dead. He's showing us who's boss. Look, the bomb. It stopped. How does he know we're here? I don't know. But if he's clever enough to set this up, he's gonna be one step ahead. The case. Well, open it. "Well done. "You've got the first of the seven cases. "This one wasn't entirely fair. I know. "I had to show you that I mean what I say. "People you know and care about will die "if you don't follow the rules to the letter. "Put these coordinates into the sat nav. "You have 17 minutes from now "to get to the second case. "As with all the cases, "you can walk away at any time, "but if you don't get to the location in time, "the bomb goes off. "Good luck." This is just the beginning, Mitch. It's gonna get worse. Okay, here's the new sat nav coordinates. All right? How long we got? About 14 minutes now. Don't hang about. Yeah. Yeah, the sat nav says that too. Right, we should be able to do it in 12. That's cutting a bit fucking fine, innit? Relax. We'll get there. We'll be there. Fuckin' relax? You're fuckin' have a laugh. See what we just fucking done to Richie? Fuck. Psych. Just take it easy, Mitch. Easy. Fuck! If he's tracked down Richie, who's gonna be next? There isn't any one. All the old crew are either inside or dead. I think he might be smarter than that. Look, when you said you could leave it all behind, did you mean there's no one to leave, or did you mean there's no one that you'll miss? Because there's quite a difference. No. There's no one. Fuck. I hope not, 'cause if there is, I think he might know. You're going to dance all day to my tune, you fucking pieces of shit. What are you doing? There's gotta be someone. Someone who can help us. Ed, it's Floyd. Ed, I need a big favor. Ta, mate. Speak soon. He's gonna help then? Hopefully. We'll get on top of this fucker real soon. All right, we're here. All right, same as before. Keep the car running. We'll be back as soon as we can. Go on. "Only another five more to go. "How soon before it's someone you do care about? "You have 26 minutes to get to the next location." Here's the next one. We've got 26 minutes, probably less by now. Fuck. Come on, man, put your foot on the gas. Do you fucking know her? She's staring at you, mate. I don't know you. Fuck! Floyd, get me out of here! Fucking help me! It's me, Kelly. Kelly? I don't know you. Let me go! You're... You're little Kelly? - No, no! - She's your niece. Now stop fucking around, you two and get me out of here! That sick fucker's watching us. That's how I know. I'm watching you. We've got to go and we have to take this case. - I'm sorry! - Floyd, over here. Now. Floyd! Are you just going to take it? You'll fucking kill her! She might be my niece, now I think we've just got to do this. Are you kidding? You're kidding. We can't. We can't do it. I'm out of ideas, Mitch. This is the best thing I've seen in years. Look, I barely even know her. I don't even know my brother anymore. We never got on. We've just got to do it, man. Fuck it. You do it. I'm off to the fucking car. Where the fuck are you going? Floyd, what's going on? I've got no choice. No! No! Floyd, get me out of here. Fucking help me! It's me. Kelly. How much do we need? We should think of a figure. Anything less than half a mil is not enough. Don't be daft. 100 grand would fucking set us up. No, Mitch, it's not enough. Haven't you seen the economy lately? Funny enough, I don't keep up with the FT index, you know. I work in a fucking pound shop, mate. You've always were a man of small ambition, Mitch. You need to think big. Yeah. Look at the fucking good it's done you. I've got plans, mate. A little place out in Florida, with a fishing lake out in the back, with the sea... The sea a couple of miles down the road. I've got a little fishing boat and a pick-up. And I'll spend all day long fishing or eating Italian food or at night eating seafood. Maybe even bag myself a nice woman. Sounds good. What about you, Mitch? You got plans? You must have plans. You can't just go home, you know. I haven't really fucking thought about it. - Typical. - Yeah. Fucking... All right, then, what, drive to France. Spend a few weeks fucking about there. Explore a bit. Ah. Just take it from there, I don't know. France isn't going to be far enough, Mitch. With today's developments, they will track us down, pin all this shit on us in no time at all. Let's just get through today, eh? Yeah. Yeah. Let's do that. Do you know how unlucky we were that day, Mitch? What day? The day we hit the car, after the job in Enfield. I try not to think about it. It wasn't our fault. Even the judge said so. There was a fault with the car. It really shouldn't have gone up like that. Yeah. But it did. Because we hit the fucker and we hit it hard. Yeah, I know. There's no point trying to avoid it, mate. If we hadn't lost control of the car on that corner, they'd still be alive. We hit it 'cause we were running from the old bill. It was our fault, Floyd. It fucking was. And you fucking know it, you know. Yeah. I know. Yes, it fucking was your fault! Okay, let's get... Okay, let's get on with it. Same again. Just hang in the car. Just get ready to go. - How long have we got? - You got three minutes. - Shit! Let's go! - Let's go. Oh, no. Ed. Ed. Fuck. What's happening? He's nailed to the fucking floor, mate. Oh, man. Oh, Ed. I'm so sorry, mate. How the fuck? How could this be happening, mate? Oh, shit. It'll be all right. I don't understand. Who's this? It's Ed. I just called him to help us. Your mate? I mean, from the car, you called him in the car, your mate? Yeah. Oh, that's right. Who knew that you knew him? No one. No one. I've only known him for a few weeks, we barely know each other. What's in those cylinders? Well, whatever it is, it don't fucking matter. He's still gonna... He can't breathe that shit, can he? No. It's not just water. He's been drugged. He doesn't know what's going on. Look, there. - Cameras. - Fuck. Fucking hell. I'm sorry, Ed. I am so sorry you got involved. Look, we've been through this before. If we try and get you out of here, this trap goes off and it's gonna kill you, Ed. I wish I could do something. I wish I could just walk away. I can't. - I can't walk away. - Look, we're sorry. All right? We're sorry. We're really fucking sorry. But it's too late for you now. It's harsh, I know. It's really fucking harsh, but we're gonna take this case, and we're going to leave. We're sorry. You just broke the rules, Floyd. You can't help him. Yesterday, I couldn't afford enough food to eat. Today... Today, we've seen some fuckin' nasty shit. Let's hope it don't get any worse. It will. It's so easy. You're so predictable. How far can we take this? I mean, what's next? He's done his research. I'm fucking scared, and I fucking don't mind telling you. All right, this next location is out east. If the traffic don't get any worse, we'll be there in about 30 minutes. Right. Let's just not get pulled, okay? We need to go fast, but not go mental. Just keep it under control. All right, don't worry about it. Just relax. We'll be there. - Relax. - Fuck, yeah. Fucking relax. Course. No fucking problem. Cunt. Fucking relax. Oh! Oh, you're so funny. Oh, you're so very good. Look at you, you heap of squashed fucking imbecilic ponce. Have you had any, um... Have you had any women in your life recently? What? Women. Has there been anyone recently? Yeah, one. Go on then. She was great. She had class, she was beautiful. We got on. What was her name? Rachel. She shacked up with me for a couple of years, but it didn't work out. What went wrong then? I got itchy feet. She got sick of my stupid shit. Upped and left me. Do you think there's any way he'd know about her? I hope not. Do you think he'd find out? Well, that's what... That's what I've been thinking. Yes. Go on. Oh, go on. Show me how clever you are. He could have spent years planning this. What about Karen? I was just thinking that. Phone her. After what happened to Ed? I don't think so. I stopped caring a long time ago. If he's done his research properly, he'll know that. Oh, shut up! Get on with this. Come on. Karen... I'm sorry. - Calm down, Mitch. - I can't fucking calm down! Mitch, why am I here? Please, get me out. Please. Karen, we can't. There... There's a bomb behind you. And up there is a TV camera. The guy who set all this up will detonate that bomb if we try and get you out of this shit. So call someone. Call the police! Call someone, I don't know! No, it's not easy as that, love. Look, this isn't easy, especially not for him. See, this case is full of money. Our money. And we need it back. It's wired into this though, isn't it? Yes. If we try to take this case, whatever's in that pump is going into you. And there's nothing we can do about it. Oh, fuck it. Mitch. Where's Gary? I don't know. We separated. He left. Mitchell, just get me out of here, please. Please. Please! We've got to go. No! No, don't go, please. Hang on, Floyd. Fuck. We haven't got time. Sort the bomb out. Disconnect the fucking bomb. I don't know anything about bombs! It could just blow us all up. Please. Help me. Please. Hey, that's not allowed. Cheating scumbag. - - Mitch, the bomb's started again. Eat shit! - I'm fucked, aren't I? - Yeah. Mitchell, I'm sorry. We tried, but it was over. We tried, Mitchell, we tried. I know. Yeah, I know. But Gary? Fuck. You could have had anyone in the world. Anyone. Look at you. But my brother? You're a fuckin' felon, Mitch. Yeah, I am. Mitch. Mitch. No! No! No! Mitch! Mitch, please. Please, Mitch. Please. Please. Floyd. Help me. She had that coming. She deserved it. You fucking did this. Not me. - Are you okay, Mitch? - No. Not really. Ahhh! We're nearly done. Fucking you really believe that? Look, if this doesn't finish today, we're gonna find him and we're gonna kill him! We might be getting our money back but... ...he's making us... He's making us pay. You're keeping very quiet, Floyd. Time to get you more involved. Hello. Yes? That's me. I know. Yes, I know. I need it just a little more time. I need another 24 hours and I'll have it. Yeah. Absolutely. Of course. Okay. I'll be in touch. What are you looking for? I don't know. I feel like we're walking into the Dragon's Den every time we get to one of these sicko fests. There must be something we can do to give us an edge. We tried that. So you're Rachel? Shit. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't know what else I can say. What the fuck's going on? What's this fucking thing on my head? I don't know. Just get me out of this now, Floyd. It's not as simple as that. We can't. He's telling the truth. It's not that simple. We're not running this thing. Fuck. I don't understand. See that case? It's full of money. Someone wants us to take it. If we do, you die. What? Who wants that? Rach, it's my fault. He's picking on you because he's trying to get to me. But you're gonna help me, right? If... If we try and get you out, this bomb goes off. That sick fucker's watching us. You're doing a good job. Remember, after the next one, that's when we make the move. I'm ready. Are we all set up? Of course. All right. I'll see you soon. - You okay, mate? - No. We've gotta do this, haven't we? You can't do this. You can't kill me. Rach... Floyd, look, I didn't leave you because I didn't love you. I left you because I couldn't watch you anymore. You were always on self-destruct. You always fucked up even when you were being sweet. No! No! No! Mate. Mate! It's shit. I know. We've seen some bad stuff today. Mitchell... When we're done... When this is all finished, if we're still alive, we track down Lawson and we kill him. Goes without saying, brother. It goes without saying. We'll fucking... He dies. Is this the last one? This is the sixth case. He said there was seven. I can't go through that again, Mitch. - I can't do it. - We've seen worse, mate. You've done worse, and for less than half a million! That was then. Then? Now? Who gives a fuck. You're a nasty fucker when you want to be. Now is the time you can fucking remember that. I ain't enjoying this one bit... But I've come this far, and I'm seeing it through and so are fucking you! Let's get on with it. Doors closing. Fucking who's left? Who could this be? That's my brother. I didn't want to say anything. Look, I'm sure it isn't. I'm sure it's not... Oh, fuck. I can't, I couldn't deal with that. I couldn't handle that. When was the last time you spoke? No, well when he stole Karen. I don't even know where he is. Well, that's probably good. Oh, fuck. Twelfth floor. Doors opening. Fuck, I'm sorry, Gary. Fucking psycho! "I'm sorry?" Fucking sorry? This isn't me. I'm not doing this to you. He's telling you the truth. I'm not gonna tell you it's not my fault, but I'm not the one doing this to you. Why should I believe you? You said you'd kill me. Do you think I'm capable of this? Me? You're my brother! I am, Mitch. I'm your brother. We grew up together. You can't do this. Listen to him, Gary. This isn't us, we're here to help. What's in the case? It's money. It's a lot of money. I don't get it. We were robbed. That's our money. If we want it back, we got to sacrifice you. Says who? Who's doing this? It's revenge. Fucking revenge. What about Karen? Where's Karen? Look, we need to get on. Where's Karen? She's dead. She's fucking dead. He found her. No, no. No. That's not fucking fair. You always bring this kind of shit on everyone, Mitchell! I know. Listen. We got to get the fuck out of here. We need to decide what we're gonna do. Look, the deal is, if we take the case, your head gets screwed. If we try to dismantle this shit, bomb goes off, we're fucked. We all die. The only unknown quantity is if we just leave you here, and walk off. We don't seem to have many options. I'm screwed. What's that camera for? He's watching us. Then cover the camera up. He'll blow the bomb. He won't fuck about. He might hesitate enough to give me time to get out of this fucking thing. He might. But he might not. Well, we don't seem to have much choice. We're out of options. Fuck. I can't deal with this. This isn't right. It's not fucking right. I'm not watching my brother die. We're getting out of here. Together. No dismantling my toys, Mitchell. Two minutes, Mitch. We got two minutes! Fucking... It's down to less than a minute! We have to go, Mitch! We go or we die. Oh, fuck, no. I'm fucking sorry. Please, Mitch! Help me, Mitch! Please. Please. - Go on, go on. - Run, you fucker. You fucking cunt. Now you see how it feels? Now you understand, Mitchell. Shit! Fucking driver. It was you! Shit. Come back here. That wasn't very fucking clever, was it? Floyd. Floyd. Floyd, wake up. Floyd, Floyd, wake up. Fuck. Shit. What the fuck? Where are we? It looks like the place we stayed last night. Yeah, it does. It's the fucking driver. He was in on it. Yeah, it's coming back to me now. He shot us... Tranquilizer. We've been properly fucking done over, mate. What's with the TV? Good evening. The pain of knowing my family burnt to death because two incompetent criminals thought they could take what didn't belong to them is not made any less painful by knowing you have had the worst day of your lives today. I have enjoyed watching it all. As with everything in life, all actions have reactions. And now, you are at the end of your day. And one of you is about to be at the end of your life. In front of you is a chessboard. You each have 10 minutes on your clocks. And you must play until one of you wins. You each have a case with a gun inside it. The winner's case will open. As you can see, there is another bomb right here. As soon as the game is finished, it will start counting down from two minutes. If more than one of you is still alive at the end of the time, it will explode. If not, the survivor will be released. You are not playing for money, of course. That's mine. You are playing for your life. Oh, and if you think you're coming after me, I wouldn't bother. I have CCTV footage of you killing your friends, and I've got enough money to make sure you never find me. One more thing. If you make an illegal move in the game, you lose 20 seconds from the two minutes on the bomb's timer. Sorry, I can't be there in person, but I'm on my way to the airport with your fucking money. Fucking bomb... What a cunt. We're fucked. Yeah, well, one of us definitely is. No, I mean, I can't play chess. What's the clock all about? You start the clock at the beginning of the game, and after each move you just hit the button. Well, so we've only got 10 minutes thinking time? Yeah. Look. Before we do this, are we really going to go through with it? I really think if I win, I can't shoot you, Mitch. Well, I'm gonna fucking shoot you. Yeah. You know what I mean, mate. This, this thing was never going to end well, was it? Mitch, I'm so sorry I asked you to get into this. I am sorry. We couldn't ignore what happened. I enjoyed the job. Just like the old days. Yeah. It was fun. Let's just get on with it. Illegal move, you brain-dead punks. What the fuck? Oh. I think the pawns move forward, not diagonal. I forgot. Sorry. Sorry? Your go. So, two moves... Two spaces, yeah? Yeah. Can any of these jump over the pawns? The knights, and the bishops. The bishops are these ones. They go diagonally. Oh, fuck. Fuck! Fuck! We lost another 20 seconds. We can't carry on like this, mate. We're both gonna get blown to shit. Sorry, mate. No! One space forward, mate. It's only two on the first go. All right. What the fuck? Mate. We're fucking toast. This ain't gonna work. I know. Your move. The clock's ticking. Fuck! That was never gonna happen, was it? No point in both of us dying. It's okay. Kill him! Kill him! Do it! Do it! Sometimes, life deals you a bad hand. This game we all play turns ugly and people get hurt. Life's not easy. You don't live, you survive. But survival is not enough for me. When you've felt the highs and tasted the rewards, everything else just feels like treading water.
