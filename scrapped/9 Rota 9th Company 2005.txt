Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, 1988, Day 1 Please, don't cry. It's only for two years. A mere two years. - Chougainov! - Yes. I must go now. - Is Ryabokon here? - There he is, getting a ride! Sleep tight, people! The enemy won't pass! Mama! Well, time to say goodbye. This is for you. Brothers! The border is on a lock and the key is in my pocket! Go! Quickly! Put your stuff on the table! Now! Put your bags here! Beer, vodka, moonshine - on the table! Is she your girlfriend? Did you screw her for one last time? What? She didn't let you? Easy, everyone! C'mon, it'll be all right. Don't sweat it. Lots of nice guys out there who'll take care of her. - What's this? - Paint. Whattcha you gonna draw there, warrior? Tank tracks? Why didn't you drag the easel along, painter? Gioconda. Next! You think she'd wait for you? She'll have it in both holes while you write her love letters. What do you want from me? Oh, you can talk! C'mon, wanna punch me in the face? Come on! Come here, jerk! Relax, son. I'm gonna make you a real soldier. You know the first rule in the army? Soldiers must endure all hardships and adversities of the army life. Why are you wearing a suit? You think this is some kind of party? I have no other clothes. Let's switch, huh? I'll give you mine, plus cigarettes. You won't need it any longer. But I could really use it - nightclubs, girls... - You know what I mean? - Yeah. You're all set here. You bet. It's like a sweet dream you don't wanna wake up from. So, deal? - Of course. - That's my boy! - Take the cover off, will ya? - Sure. - Sweet dream, you say? - Yeah. - Hey you! What the... - Don't move, you mother... I said don't move! - Relax, son. - Let go of me! What did you say about enduring hardships, huh? Got it? Got it? Finish your haircut yourself now. Guys, is this the 6th Unit? Where you think you're going, Rambo? Piss off! - Chill out, Chougoun! - What? Nothing! What's your name? Volodya Vorobyov. Lyutayev, Oleg. Lyuty (Eng. "Fierce"), for short. - This is Ruslan the Gioconda. - Volodya. Stas, "Sery" (Eng. "Gray"). - Hi. - Volodya. Ryaba (Eng. "Pocky"). Chougoun (Eng. "Pig-iron"). That's all for now. Move, mate. Sit down, Vorobey (Eng. "Sparrow"). Continue, Ryaba. So, I wake up in the morning. My head is exploding. Unzip my eyes open with my fingers. Take a squint-around. What the heck is this house? Hell knows how I got here. Now, there's this girl right next to me. Smiling. - Naked. - Woo-hoo. And her father, standing right over me. Says: "You're screwed, boy." "The girl is underage. Now you either marry her..." "or I'm reporting you to the police". And the slut just sits there with her tits covered, with downcast eyes... like she's got nothing to do with it. And ugly... like a bulldog. So I say: "No way, dear father..." "I'd rather lie under a tank than with her." Next second I grab my feet and start running... hoping I get here first before he gets to the police. And I got married yesterday. The wedding and the send-off all at once. What? Congratulations. Pretty boy. "All right", she says. "Now I am your wife, you can have me". She thinks I'm stupid. Like she's not gonna cheat on me while I'm away? She wept all night long. "Married and he didn't even touch me." So I tell her: "When I get back, I will check it down there..." "and if you ain't a virgin no more, I'll kill you, bitch!" That's how I left her! It's him! That one! Wearing the suit! Who are you pointing your finger at, sucker? Take it easy! I'll crop your dumb head myself now. They're the Afghan unit, dickhead. Come here, asshole! The 9th Company Fergana, Uzbekistan, Day 3 Hey, where are you from? - From Grozny (Chechnya). - Where? - Grozny. - From Grozny. So you'll be called Pinochet from now on. - What? - Pinochet. - Why Pinochet? - I don't know. Why not Pinochet? Is he coming for us? What an ugly mug! - Where are you from, clowns? - From Siberia, Comrade Commander. - I am First Lieutenant Dygalo. - What? Are you hard of hearing? Get up! Get up quickly! Fall in! Now! Put your hats on in formation! Dress right! Ready front! I believe none of you is blind here. Over there is our mountain. Beyond it is Afghanistan. And for you not to get killed the first day you get there... I will drill you for 3 months without pulling out, 24/7. From this minute on. Any questions? No questions. Right face! Follow me to the camp. Double-time it. Bend your arms at the elbows. March! - Name? - Private Ryabokon. - Name? - Private Chougainov. This belt is not for holding the balls, Soldier. - Name? - Private Bekbulatov. - N... - Private Stasenko. Private Petrovsky. - It's you, our painter? - Yes, Comrade First Lieutenant. What are you doing here, son? Should've stayed home... to draw them naked women and garden flowers. You see, Comrade First Lieutenant, according to Dr. Freud... any painting is a sublimation of subconscious human instincts... including the instinct of violence. But you can disagree with this... because Soviet science does not recognize the bourgeois doctrine of Dr. Freud. Very clever, huh? Sorry, Comrade First Lieutenant. I'll fix it. With your help. Rule number one! A paratrooper must always be ready for a sudden attack. - Very good. Name? - Private Lyutayev! Rule number two! Brighter than a Lieutenant is only a First Lieutenant! Forget who you were and what you knew! Remember, clowns! Here, you're neither good nor bad... nor bright, nor stupid. Not even painters. Here, you are nothing! You are not even humans. Here, you are shit! And I'm the one who will make humans of you with these very hands! - Clear? - Yes, sir. - I couldn't hear it! - Yes, sir! - Louder! - Yes, sir! Fill it up! Comrade Lieutenant, why does the first unit run with light equipment? With light equipment, you can run with your girlfriend to the bushes. Here, the more ammo you bring, the more chances you have to survive. Here's your mission. Dislodge the enemy from the hilltop. Secure your position. Readiness report? Comrade First Lieutenant. The second unit is ready for the mission! Stand up! Forward, march! Charge! You've failed the mission. You are all corpses. You, you, and you! Cargo 200 in the Black Tulip. A piece of shit in a zinc casket. The convoy that will pass here will get ambushed. You know what a single machine-gun means? Up there, on that hilltop? Do you have any idea? Get up, you dead men! Put your helmets on! Run downhill! I said run! Now! I wish we were in Afghanistan already. - Sparrow. - What do you want? Take my dick for a piss. I'm so tired I can't get up. Him? Nah... He'll overstrain himself. Look. Snow White! Come over here! Snow White! Come on sit with us! Come over here! Don't be afraid! Dammit, now I'll have the hard-on till morning. - Who's she? - Were you born yesterday? She is Snow White, the paramedic's daughter. All the draftees have slept with her. She's fucked half of Afghanistan. They say she's hot. You don't fuck her, she fucks you. There's this disease - whattcha you call it? Get lost, smart-ass. Ryaba, could you arrange it with her? Why arrange? She's dependable like an AK-47. Just grab her and go. The question is how to get her through two sentinels. No, guys. Forget it. The previous draft leaves for war in 2 days. No punishment worse than that for them. But we will have to linger here for another three months. We get caught -- we're in deep shit. Listen, Lyuty. You'd sleep with her, after 40 men? No. Me neither. Rather starve than eat from the garbage. Yeah? But I ate. I ate. Ever starved so bad that you couldn't sleep? Shut the fuck up! You got no clue what it's like... to have carpenter's glue for dinner, to have to dig through trash for food... to watch you rich bastard dining your bitch in the restaurant... waiting for leftovers from your plates. Get it? And the bitches I had were all like her. And I won't have any other, fuckface. - Guys, that's enough. - Shut up, feather boy! Smell a woman first, then you can talk. - Calm down! - Calm down? Don't you even touch what's mine! And I won't touch yours! Got it? "Eating from the garbage..." She may be better than all of your rich sluts! Utter one more word, bastard, and you'll eat shit. Understood? What is a Soviet Paratrooper? A Soviet Paratrooper is the glory, power, and pride of the armed forces! What is a Soviet Paratrooper? A Soviet Paratrooper is the example and envy of all other units! And what the hell are you? We are a disgrace of all units and you personally! Listen. Listen, he is an idiot. Nah, all is not that bad. I just don't get one thing. Why does the first unit always get a slack? Light equipment, an hour for a smoke. While we work our butts off. It's a piece of cake for them to throw us off the hilltop. We should take turns. One time for them, one time for us. It is because their Lieutenant is sane. And us, we have this idiot Dygalo. The bastard is making rank on us. No, he's got combat stress disorder. Got hit in the head. He lost all his men in Afghanistan... was the only one left. That's why they reassigned him here. He keeps writing to the minister, wants to go back. But with his head injury, who needs him there? That's why he's going mad on us. So, guys, we are in deep shit. Company, get up! On a count of 40, fall in! What are you? Pregnant women? I don't get it! Ten... What's taking you so long? You are not Soldiers, but pregnant cockroaches! Fifteen... What's the matter, girls? Too hard? Got trapped in your skirts? What's the holdup? Company, dismissed! C'mon, help your bulimic comrades! Company, get up! What are you gonna do, warrior? Get back, clowns! Ten... Help Chougainov up! Move it! Fifteen... Go! Company, dismissed! Lower, lower! Keep your ass down, dammit! Company, get up! Keep your head down, dammit! Ten... Raising your head like this is a gift for the sniper! A death notice in your mother's mailbox! I said faster! Faster! Fifteen... Company, dismissed! About face! You're screwed, Soldier. In my office, after the midnight clear. Company, get up! Stay in formation! Don't break up! Keep your weapons up! Faster! Second squad! Get back! Lyutayev, Ryabokon, pick up the Soldier! Remember once and for all, never leave your comrades behind! Move forward! I said move! Ten minute rest. Take it! Asshole! Tell me, Sparrow, do I need to carry you like this every time? I got enough shit of my own. So, kill me! C'mon, kill me! Sod off! I can't stand it anymore! Go back if you can't. Step forward and say so tomorrow at the ceremony. I will! What? You despise me? I don't give a shit! I spit on you! Olya's waiting there for you, she can't wait anymore. Tomorrow I quit too, guys. Got a letter from my mom. It's been a while already. She is very ill. If I die, she'll have no one left. I didn't want to be the first to quit. Ok, guys. Anyone else who wants to quit? The guys from the other call-up say that... in Afghanistan, one week you're on a combat mission in the mountains... then two weeks enjoying yourself at the base. But here, with Dygalo, you won't survive till war, you'll perish sooner. So what, Ryaba? So, Sparrow, agreed then? Tomorrow we quit together, ok? Dress right dress! Ready... front! Comrade Colonel, the regiment is ready as ordered. - Good day, Comrades Paratroopers! - Salut, Comrade Colonel! At ease! Each one of you, voluntarily... made the decision to serve in Afghanistan. Now I must ask you one question. Is there anyone who changed their mind? I will not ask why. You will be merely reassigned to another division back home. Who doesn't want to go to Afghanistan? - I thank you for your service! - For the Soviet Union! Harder! Faster! It ain't no girl but a machine gun! Harder! Kill him! Don't fear! Kill! You only have one strike to save your ass! Crush the ribs, rip the guts! Give it to me, son. Look. Do it like this! Like this, kill him! Take it, Soldier, kill him! - Vorobyov! - Yes. - Come here! - Yes sir. Stasenko. Come here. Take off your backpacks, put your weapons down. Quickly! Warriors! Move their stuff away! Hit him! Punch him in the face! You are going to war, son, do it! You will caress your girlfriend like this back home! Hit him, in the mug! Come on, full contact, both of you! Go! Quick! Hit first, Sparrow! Come on! Hit him in the face! - Go on! - Come on, Sparrow! Don't be spooked, come on! Hit him! - Get up! Get up! - Get up, Warrior! Come on Sparrow! Hit him! - Come on, come on! Hit him! - Come on, Sparrow! Finish it! - Get up Soldier, come on, Sparrow! - Get up! - Come on, come on! - I said, get the fuck up! Come on, come on! - Don't fear! Come on! - Finish him, Stas! Get up, Warrior! When he falls down, finish him! Only a dead man won't shoot you in the back! Got it? Sorry Sparrow, forgive me. Forgive me, Sparrow. Let's continue. It looks like modeling clay. Go ahead and squeeze it, everyone. Touch it, feel it. There you go. See how soft it is? It can take any shape and form... like a harmless toy each of you used to play with in boyhood. Every one of you used to mold little squirrels, little rabbits... Yet, in fact, you're holding a very powerful and effective weapon! A plastic explosive! - Or, plastique, for short. - Stas! It has its own chemical formula but you do not need to know this. Plastique is an irreplaceable thing. Therefore it is an important piece of ammo of every paratrooper. The question is why? First, when it's not in the active state... it is absolutely safe, easy to store, and always handy. As they say, it doesn't stretch your pocket. But in action, it is extremely effective and exerts enormous destructive power. But you got to have skills to properly use it. Specifically... Warrior. There are two simple rules you must know... First, the harder you squeeze it, the bigger the explosion. Rule number two. Don't stick it everywhere! But by itself this thing won't work... - For it to blow we need what? - A detonator. Exactly. We need to insert a detonator. - Your name, Soldier? - Private Petrovsky! You're screwed, Soldier. I'll have to report this to your Commander. Yes. - Comrade Lieutenant, Private Petrovsky. - Come on in. Well molded, very true to life. - You can paint, right? - I did study painting. - A portrait, this big? - I could. I... I got a letter from this girl... We met before the war... She wants my picture... Should I send her this? Can you, like... without... the scar? Sure, but with paint, it won't be quick. Will need more than one day. Of course, I won't go to see her after the war... Just want her to keep writing... Attention! Go! Them tractors, dammit. Eat this! Look! He pissed his pants! It's funny to you? My bed is under his! What, Sparrow, do I have to sleep with an umbrella now? I don't get it, Soldier. Did you see anything? - Nothing, Comrade First Lieutenant. - And you? My mistake, Comrade First Lieutenant. Then tell me what's so funny? I also want to share your joy. You can swallow your snots, call your mother, piss you pants... ...but you must accomplish your mission! Die but get it done! And he did. About, face. March. Some basic knowledge on how to communicate with the locals... you'll get from this handbook. But... the main thing you should remember when you cross the border... is that you are in a Muslim country. Islam is not merely another religion. It's a different world with its own laws. It's a different notion of life and death. A true Muslim isn't afraid to die in battle. And when he dies fighting the infidel, that is... us... he instantly gets in paradise... where all he was missing in this life awaits him... water... gardens full of fruit... and full-breasted virgins - "houri". How Muslims treat women is quite another topic. The most sacred object for a Muslim is his house... or "haram". Which is also the root of the word "harem". The other meaning of the word: "forbidden". Looking at a Muslim woman - "haram". Anything that has to do with sex - "haram". It's "haram" to show a Muslim indecent gestures... those you are all so used to... You can get a bullet for that even from a common peasant. On the other hand, a Muslim will never desecrate his house with blood. That means once you enter their village, you are their guest. To kill a guest, even if he's an infidel, is "haram". Therefore, remember... as long as you're in the village, you are safe. But once you exit over the village's border... the very host who drank tea with you 5 minutes ago... may shoot you in the back just as well. Because to kill an infidel is an act of glory. It is the stairway to heaven. I'm telling this for you, Soldier. So... Afghanistan is a multinational country. Over 20 different nations live there. Tajiks, Turkmen, Uzbeks. Pushtuns along the Pakistani border. Along the west border... Khazars - the Mongoloids, who have settled here since the Mongol invasions. In fact, the word "Khazar" in Turkic languages means "thousand". Am I boring you, Soldier? Comrade Captain, does it matter who you shoot? Over the entire course of history... no one ever succeeded to conquer Afghanistan... No one, ever. Squad, stand up! What are we doing in Afghanistan? Fulfilling our international duty to help our Afghan brothers... fight the aggression of imperialism! Fire! (All shouting "Done!") Too low to the right. You pull on the trigger too sharp. Closely-grouped, but still too high. Breathe more slowly. That'll do. - You ever shoot before? - No, Comrade Lieutenant. It's occupational. I've got an accurate eye. - Get me a sniper rifle! - Yes sir! Give it to him. - Private Vorobyov! - Yes. - Leave the gun at the point. Come here! - Yes sir! - Here. Set it at the target. - Yes sir. Move it! - Beautiful, Gioconda! - Way to go, Gioconda! Look, Gioconda. Honestly. Why'd you wanna come to Afghanistan? You could just stay at the headquarters and draw. - You won't understand. - Explain plainly then. Plainly? Over there, can you see that tank? Beautiful, isn't it? So powerful. And nothing superfluous, not a single unnecessary line. Weapons are the most beautiful things mankind has ever created. So? In the Renaissance, there lived an artist named Michelangelo. Someone asked him once how he creates his sculptures. He simply said: "I just take a rock and cut off the superfluous". You see? Beauty has only the essential. Nothing superfluous. War is where there's only life and death. And nothing superfluous. War is beauty in itself. Look, Gioconda, I don't get you. Are you stupid or just mocking at us? What's so beautiful? When tank tracks are greased with your guts? You wanna play war out of boredom? - I knew you wouldn't understand. - Get lost, you freak! Guys, mail! - Easy. Easy. - Give it to me! - Stasenko! - Here! - What day is today? - Wednesday. The third. - Sparrow. - Yes! - Lyutayev. - Here! - Suvorov. - Here! Ryabokon. - That's it. - What do you mean "That's it"? - Give it back! - "My friends asked me out but I said no..." - "...because I love you." - Give it back. But then I picked up two cool guys... - Did you guys see that? - Get up, Chougoun! What the fuck do you think you're doing, you jerk... - Come on, Sparrow! - Come on! Come on, Sparrow! Finish him! Break off, soldiers! Stand up! You're screwed, soldiers! Both of you in my office, after the clear. - Well done, Sparrow! - That's a real man! Dress right! Ready, front! About face! Forward, march! Listen, guys. Hold the line. Disperse right up the top. Sparrow, Stas, Ryaba. Grab their legs and pull them down. I don't give a fuck how. Bite if you have to. Pinochet, Chougoun, Gioconda. You come with me. - I said, move! - All right, guys, let's go. Hold the line! Steady! Hooray! Company, get up! I said, get up! Come out! Down on the floor! Crawl! That's an order! Move it! What did you say? Stand up! All of you stand up! Who just spoke? Who? You? Who? Was it you? What the...? Who? Who said it? Who? Come here, you! You wanna say something? Say it! Whisper it in my ear! I'm asking you! Come on, all of you! I'm alone! C'mon, you and me! No one will ever know! Are you normal people or just fucking freaks? Did he just have a bad dream? It sure looks like it. - He must be having a relapse again. - Wait a sec... I overheard today at the headquarters... he had resubmitted his request... wanted to come with us to Afghanistan... It just got rejected today... - Halt. Who's there? - Don't ask, don't tell. Keep moving. Quiet. Quiet. Hold it. Come on, faster. - Is there any pot left? - Quiet. - Listen. She's moaning again. - That a girl, comes like a machine gun. Guys, won't Dygalo be looking for us? Nope, he won't! Why? Because... Lyuty! Some nice large-caliber fireworks you had going there. - Got anything of that thing left? - Here. I've fucked so hard, this boy will keep quiet for a whole year. - Guys, let's smoke another one? - Ah, Sparrow, you birdy! You know how we used to smoke in the orphanage? - Like Gypsies, one joint for all. Wanna see? - Show me. Look at what they're doing! Guys, you are all right. I love you all so much. You've no idea how cool you are. For you, I'd do anything. Birdy's had enough! Don't give him any more. Or, we'll have to haul him back again. Here I come. Tell me, Vova, are you a man? No, really, tell me, are you a man or what? Don't, Oleg. Quit talking about it. - Why? - I got my girl, Olya. Know what she's like? So, keep loving your Olya. It's not the point. Everyone has an Olya. Me, him - ask anyone. Everyone has an Olya. Remember what you used to be, Birdy? Now you've become a real man, and only one last test to pass. You must do it, Birdy. You must. We are not going to a resort, maybe it's your last chance. You can't go to the war as a virgin. It's every man's thing, understand? - Come on, Sparrow! - Go for it, come on! Maybe she doesn't want me. Are you a fool? Of all, she likes you the most! - You kidding me! - I swear, ask the guys! She always asks about you. C'mon, c'mon, go! She looks at you all the time and you keep ignoring her, she feels hurt! - No, I can't, like this, in front of you all. - Hold it. Have a drink, I'll be right back. What the... Is he so special? Better than others? I don't get it! Shut up! We'll sort it out later. Sparrow, maybe you need help? Want me to hold her legs? - Sod off. Sparrow, just go! - I'm going. - VDV! (Eng. Russian Airborne Troops) - Bear for action! Swords out! If I don't come back, write home: "He died a noble courageous death." VDV, forward! - Stas? - What? - What's the matter? - Just miss my family... Give me one. It's a bit scary, isn't it, guys? Honestly, without any of this bravado? It is scary. Not everyone gets killed. If it happens quickly, it's not that scary. Worst thing is if you get crippled. When I was in the Tashkent hospital, I saw these guys, a whole ward. Each on half the bed as that was all that was left of them. I knew a guy who'd come back from the war. He had all the limbs but... his bladder got busted by shrapnel. He's got a tube sticking out his belly... and a container tied to his leg. They call him "The Moonshiner". What's up with your Sparrow? Fell asleep? Or reading a book to her? Wait, I'll check them out. You are all brutes! Get it? Animals! You are like animals, don't care with whom and where! I'm not like you! I can't, like this! Animals! You are all animals! I thought it'd make you some good... What are you staring at? Did anyone ever tell you that you are very beautiful? Are you in love with me? Marry me then. And they all will pay us visits. You must know it. You are very beautiful. Are you an idiot or what? I'm an artist. Aphrodite, born from the sea... Aphrodite! Born from the sea! Goddess of beauty! The sea washes away all the sins! Eternal pure temptress! Goddess! Everyone worship her! On your knees, you ugly creatures! Guys, I love you! Formation! - Comrade First Lieut... - As you were. Try... Left face. Board the plane. Go! Bagram, Afghanistan, Day 153 . . Hey, young people! Krasnoyarsk? Anyone from Krasnoyarsk? Krasnoyarsk! - I am! - You? What part? - KrAZ! - And I am from Yershovka! Homeboy! - Just stay cool. Don't sweat it. - Yes sir! I'm flying back, and you'll fly back too! Look, take this amulet. Take it! And not a scratch. - Wear this and never take it off, will you? - Yes. - Wear it and never take it off, homeboy! - Understood. Pass it on to others from Yenisei! Only those from Yenisei! Will do. - What's your name? - Oleg. And you? What? Can't hear you. Never mind. Take care! Look, guys. Commander! Starboard! C'mon on, guys, quickly! - Quickly! Move it! - Go! - Pitch, 46 by 49. - Switching to manual. Apply emergency brakes! Got it! Steady, steady! - Melkumov. - Yes. - Stroilov. - Yes. - Ryabokon. - Yes. - Vanifatiev. - Yes. - Demtchenko. - Yes. - Bekbulatov. - Yes. You've been assigned to the 4th company. Follow me. - Bye, guys. - Take care. See you, guys! So long. And you, junkies, alcoholics, and sex maniacs... ...you are the 9th Company. Follow me. Look, the brutes are here. Hang yourselves, Ghosts (a Russian nickname for Mujahideen). Formation! Atten-hut! Warriors, congratulations and welcome to the Valiant 9th Company! I don't get it, Warriors. Congratulations and welcome to the Valiant 9th Company! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Sod off, Khokhol (pejorative for Ukrainians)! Go wank 'em outside at the drill square. I am Lieutenant Pogrebniak. Forget who you were and what you knew. Here you're neither bad nor good. You are nothing here. - You're nobody. - We've heard this elsewhere before, bros. I will drill you day and night until you become real Soldiers. - Got it? - Yes, Comrade Lieutenant. - Huh? - Yes, Comrade Lieutenant! That's better. Private Chougainov. Why is it such junk? This machine gun belonged to Samylin. He died a heroic death. He killed 8 Ghosts with this gun. Got a medal for it. Yeah, it has some scratches because he died of a grenade. It's not such a big deal. Just glue it together. The barrel is all bent. How am I gonna shoot? I'm doing you a great honor, butthead. This gun is special. You should feel proud instead of bitching about it. - Comrade... - Soldier! Sign here! Left face. March! - Who was your bootcamp officer? - First Lieutenant Dygalo. Sashka? I thought they'd written him off. He used to sleep right over there. Gritting his teeth all night, dreaming combat. None of us could sleep. Then he was taken to hospital, in Tashkent, right? He was a good guy, cheerful, always smiling. He had this illness. - Hey, Doc? - What? It's called contusion. I thought you'd say something clever. You churka! (derogative for Central Asians) Shut up! Is Snow White still there? Snow White is still there. Good girl. - Tell me, painter. Look like her? - Close. A guy I knew made it from memory. Listen, Khokhol. That son of a bitch, Tomato, gave this guy the junked gun of Samylin's. The new gun - he must have written it off and then sold it. What? He trades weapons? In war, some get killed, others get rich. Comrade Lieutenant, is it true that we go into combat in 3 days? Not combat, just a combat patrol. Our objectve is to secure a defensive position on a ridge, protect our convoys. Is that all? That's all. You thought it was Stalingrad here? Convoy, go! What a monumental dude! He should be cast in bronze. - Kagraman! - What? Kag-ra-man! That's what the Mujahideen call him. Means "wicked giant". Our commander is one of a kind in the whole Afghanistan. Was up 3 times for decoration as Hero of the Soviet Union. But each time he'd get drunk and beat some brass hat back home. So, they can neither court-martial him nor award him his stars now. - Afanasy, what are they? - The green. The Afghan army. Fucking allies. Nothing's worse than working with them. They run away as soon as it gets hot. You think they're covering your flank, but you find them 3 kilometers behind. Once we got encircled by the enemy because of these assholes. - Where is the Mujahid territory? - Right behind this checkpoint. There they are. They say "Shuravi (Afghan name for Soviets) is our friend and brother." But at nightfall, they dig out their guns. Then Allahu Akbar and all that other shit. So don't be in a hurry to get into action. You'll get it anyway. I'm sure you already made a bet who'd be the first to kill a Ghost. Yes, we did. - What's the prize? - A pack of Marlboro. Make that two! And who won the bet in your unit, Comrade Lieutenant? Samylin was the first to kill a Ghost. Also was the first to fly back in a coffin. Whatever pieces were left of him, that is. Outpost at Anava, Day 164. There are the savages. . . The Frontier Garrison. We'll just drop off some ammo and food, then move on. - Is it gonna tag along? - Of course. - And when it grows big? - I'll take it back home. - And eat it? - I'm not them Koreans. - Bite him. - Will this work? It'll work. Misha. Fermented yet? C'mon, Seryoga, with this sun, it's like Crimean wine. Let's get 5 liters.

I don't get it. - Are you trying to insult me? - No one's had any, Comrade Lieutenant. - This is all that is left. - You know when the next supply'll get here? In a day? Two? In a week? How long are we gonna stick around here? You've one hour to get 2 full match boxes. (writing "5 Rubles") - Where am I supposed to get them? - I don't give a shit! Find, steal, give birth to it.

Halt. Ah, Sparrow. Where's your machine-gun, cut-throat? Pull back. They're already back in the village. Khokhol, you take the center. I'll go around on the right. Got it. Let's move. Chougoun, Kurbashy. Check the house on the right. Stas, Lyuty. The house straight ahead. Where was that? Stas. Where the hell did you go? What were you thinking? Hold you fire! Hold your fire! Let's go. Easy. I know, it hurts. Of course, it hurts. Easy. Easy. Khokhol, we're pulling back! They're gonna shell this place! Where the hell did you go, kid? Hang in there. Kurbashy! Kurbashy!

A box of canned meat can get you killed by friendlies, 6 months before discharge. Your discharge is as far as walking to China backwards. - It's me and Kurbashy who'll pack soon. - Guys, we shouldn't have. It's not good. They may be hauling it for the Frontier Garrison. He wants to teach us how we should live. Guys, do you know what our Sparrow is? Tell us, Birdy! Why should I be embarrassed? Yes, I studied education and philology. Ha! Our Sparrow is a teacher. - What is so funny? - Teachers like you were scared of us in school. - How many guys studied with you? - Three. And how many girls? You must have dated all of them. Or, did you save them for later? C'mon, guys. He's got his Olya. I swear I'll come visit Sparrow just to meet his wonderful Olya. So, Sparrow will stand by the classboard with a pointer like some woodpecker. As for Gioconda, we know what he'll be. - Kurbashy will be slicing people. - No, I won't. Had enough of that crap. Rather be a vet. Horses, sheep, and such. What about you, Khokhol? What will you do after Afghanistan? Drink. It's a given. You'll drink one week, and then what? Drink again. - And then what? - Drink again. Until I forget all of this. Then I'll wake up... wash my face... and start a new life... If I'm able to... Province Khost, Height 3234, New Year of 1989, Day 267. . . Move it, Birdy! . . We missed the New Year by Kransoyarsk time because of you. Thank God. Look at the Vladivostok. Stone drunk since the afternoon. - Hey, Chougoun! - Ah? I don't get it. Where did you squirrel away the fruit compote? - What makes you think I did? - Where is it then? - I simply forgot. - Yeah right. You forgot. You just wanted to drink it all alone under the blanket. Brothers. - Brothers! - Pinochet! - Pinochet! - Pinochet! Bro! Hey man! - How's it going? - Just put it right here. - How did you get here? - They re-deployed me here. - What for? - Just crushed one SOB's teeth. Says "You chomp like a pig". To us, Muslims, a pig's a dirty animal. We kill for such insulting words. Lemme have a drink. It's 100 percent alcohol! Go ahead. Let me introduce Afanasy... the Dreadful... Kurbashy the Doc... And this... is Khokhol... For some, it's Khokhol... - For others, it's Comrade Lieutenant. - C'mon, Seryoga. It's one of us. Dygalo's. Hey man. So, guys. Let's sit. - Pour it. - Guys, Gorby's speaking. Crank it up! Let's drink to this passing year. To the passing year! - Hear, hear. - Let all the bad stay behind. - Pour the second one right away. - Here. To the coming discharge. - Hooray! - Hooray! This is the discharge year, guys. Pour it. Brothers. The third toast. To our fallen comrades. To Samyla... to Nikita Balashev... To Potap. - To Ryaba. - To Lysy. To Kostyan. For all those who've not lived to see this moment. To Stas. To Stas. - VDV... - Forward! Don't sleep. Or you'll turn into a goat. Guys! Ghosts! - Company, engage! - Guys, engage! - Company, engage! - Guys, engage! Pinochet, come here! Come on! - Get Falcon on the hook, fast! - Get the ammo here, Chougoun! We're in deep shit, guys! These bastards will fight to the death! Come on, assholes! Eat this! Don't let them close! Get down! - Keep firing! - Casualty report! We've got two! All the sentries are down! Gioconda is down! - Assholes! - Hold your positions! They are retreating, guys! Mortar shells! Get down! Take cover, guys! Falcon! Falcon! Falcon! Where is the Captain? Sparrow! - Sparrow! - Aye! Check the Captain in the dugout! Get the mortar ready! - In the gully between the rocks, 150! - Aye, 150! Fire! Well done, fellas! We got 'em! - Get the wounded here! - We got no radio contact! - They killed the Captain! - Any of the officers alive? Any one? Company! Attention! Engag... Allahu Akbar! - Approaching! - Company! Bear for action! Come here! Sparrow! Chougoun! Target the center! The center! - Don't let them get any closer! - Allahu Akbar! How many of you bastards are there? Listen, guys! Time for hand-to-hand! Allahu Akbar! It's no use. There's nobody. Don't waste the flairs. We might need them later. Sooner or later they should come, since we haven't contacted them all day. - Seryoga. - Ah? Why are they using machine-guns now? They must have run out of mortar. But they've got plenty of RPG's. They're saving it for our convoy. They don't wanna waste it on us... yet... Hey, Russians! Come out. We let you live! I'm cold... cold... Hang in there for a little while... It won't take long... Our troops will come soon... The choppers will come here... They'll take you... to Tashkent... It's safe there... warm... and a nurse in a gown... - How long have we been sitting here? - Three hours. They'll start it again soon. Get down! - They're throwing grenades! - Khokhol! Kurbashy! Kurbashy, over here! They shot Khokhol! Kurbashy! Allahu Akbar! Sparrow! Crawl over here! Crawl over here, Sparrow! Go! Vova, go! Vorobyev, go! Chougoun! Get back! Chougoun. Easy. Easy. Sparrow! - Anyone alive? - Here! Guys, any Ghosts left? - None on this side! - All clear here! You bastards! Bastards! I hate you! Enough! It's over! Enough already! Are there any officers left? - Are there? - No! Attention everyone! Count off from the far end! In order! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six. Seven. Gather whatever ammo is left. I've got two grenades. I got half the magazine and two hand grenades. We're finished. It's barely enough to fight off one attack. - They're getting restless. - They'll be coming soon, we're done. Company, bear for action. Attention. VDV... Forward! Our choppers! Comrade Colonel... ...the 9th Company has accomplished the mission. The convoy may pass now. There will be no convoy. We're leaving. Comrade Colonel. The height is ours. The convoy may now pass. Can you hear me, son? Why have you been off the air? Why was there no radio contact? Can you hear? Afghanistan, Chaugani, February 9, 1989 . . We were leaving Afghanistan. . . We, the 9th Company, won our war. Back then, we didn't know many things yet to come. We didn't know that, two years later, the country we'd fought for would vanish. That wearing medals of a non-existent country would become unfashionable. We didn't know that Lieutenant Dygalo would stay on in active service... and his bootcamp would be re-deployed somewhere under Tula... ...that he would die of a stroke a year later during a night forced march. We didn't know that Snow White and her mother, along with other families... would stay in the abandoned military camp on the Afghan border... and vanish... We didn't know that the new life would ruthlessly toss us around... some to the very top... and some to the very bottom... Back then, we didn't yet know any of those things... We didn't even know that... in the rush of withdrawing the huge army, they'd simply forgotten us... on that far height... We were leaving Afghanistan. The 9th Company. We... We won. Based on real events that took place on January 8, 1988, in the Khost Province, on Height 3234 In memory of my Father.
