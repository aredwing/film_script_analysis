He can kill him without blinking an eye. Muraad. A new recruit. Ghani's distant relative's son. who is he? Long time ago there was a shootout in Lester.

Please don't take otherwise That's why l am personally here to meet you. So, Ghani bhai, what have you decided? Everyone will benefit from this friendship. Your decision. Our money. we'll split the profit. lt's business so it's better if we resolve it in business terms. Anyway, bullets have become very expensive these days. whether you use them or we.. Not so expensive that we can't get rid of trash. Mr. Smith, next time you come to me directly. Usually l am more hospitable than this. why don't you come home for dinner tonight, with your family. we can always discuss business later. ''You are our support, Oh Lord.'' ''Guide us in dark nights, Oh Lord.'' ''Oh. Lord.'' Life... ...is not fair. what else will you call the fire that.. ..that burnt down the houses adjoining the Bandra railway lines? Afew lives were lost. But people also lost their houses, homes and businesses. Everything was ruined. Everything. ls it ill-fate or a bad phase?

A hundred thousand? Thousand? Not even 100? Dad.. You don't know how to deliver a speech. lf it would've been me, people would've given bags full of money. They wouldn't run away. Oh yes, with that money you would've got her married. ln Dubai. And Alice, in an engineering college.. l don't want to get into engineering. l don't want to marry. You don't! Fine. with that money, l would've got married in Dubai. And l would've done engineering. David.. To give with a hope of return is meaningless. l feel happy when l help. And you, when you taunt. Hello, Father. - Hello, Father. Come in. Join us for dinner. Come in. Yes, please do come in. Join us for dinner. There's a lot to eat. Come in. - David.. Finish your dinner. what will be left for them if l eat? Dad, it's going fine. what? My music. You enquire about it everyday, but today you forgot. David... Stay with me till my ride comes. No. Come on. l want to talk to you. Shall l.. Fine. Come with me. l don't have a cigarette. Cigarette? who smokes? Oh, really? So you are not here to ask for a cigarette? why don't you just tell me that you don't want to talk to me? why lie unnecessarily? well, there are two cigarettes lying with dad. Shall l get them? Mr. Pandey paid me a visit in the office yesterday. For money. Then? Then what? He created a scene and left. This has happened for the second time this month. l've an offer to do a devotional album next month. l'll get enough money from it. l'll make hymns and return his money. You'll keep such hair and sing hymns? ''Hail Krishna! Hail Rama!'' Hey, music knows no religion. Okay? what, uncle? An upset stomach? Dad will be very happy to hear your hymns. Yeah. Let him think what he wants to. lt makes no difference to me. what do you gain by getting angry on dad so often? He's fine the way he is. Everything's not fine. And to make things fine, l'll have to get out of here. l'll also have to leave. My ride is here. See you. Hey, Suzie, l'll become a famous musician. l'll get you married in Dubai. And will send donation to Father Noel every month. why do you insist on getting me married in Dubai? Sheikhs there really like beauties like you. l got lucky today! l've hit the jackpot! Damn man! ''Here comes Peter!'' Hey, Roderick! Just a minute. Just a minute. Excuse me. Just a minute. Just a minute. How much? You want the first catch? Then go to the vegetable market. You shouldn't come to Peter. Here you go. Be happy. How much? This won't suffice. Everyday.. For 100 bucks all you'll get is its photo. You can fry it. want some? David! Merry Christmas, David! David! David! Christmas comes once a year. Today is my Christmas! Then l'm Santa Clause today. Now you just wait and watch, from the next month.. Quantity will double and profit, triple. How? Look, whatever we make we give 80% of it as boat rent. So what are we left with? Nada. Now we'll have our own boat, David. How? l'm getting married. How? with whom? You know the guy in our village? Almeda. You are getting married to him? No. His daughter. Oh yes. But she is dumb and deaf. And your wife is characterless. Have l ever objected it? what? She is mute. lt's perfect for me. what do l do everyday? l get drunk and get into a fight everyday. A normal girl will nag me to death. Yes, of course. - She won't say a word. She is mute. lf she won't say anything, l won't hear anything. lf l won't hear anything, l won't get irritated. lf l don't get irritated then my health and mood will stay sexy! But both, her incoming and outgoing are not working. Half-blind aunt, talk sense into your son. Asshole, l'll kill you right away! Bloody talking nonsense! You know what you are doing, right? l'm getting a boat in dowry. Peter, better keep your wife in check. Otherwise, she, too, will run away like David's wife did. Briganza, want some general knowledge? Your sister has 12 moles on her body. Eight have been seen by the entire village, even your friends. There are three which only she can see. And there is one which only l can see, exclusively. Do you want me to tell you where it is, you scoundrel? Peter! Forget it. Forget it. Peter, you're getting married, right? Better keep your wife tied down. Otherwise, looking at this ill-omened chap, she, too, will run away. Briganza.. All this has happened because of you. Shut up. what did you just say? l said, Peter, you're getting married.. Hey, you hit my mother! ''Maria's father is a cheater..'' Mom! what is it, mom? How many times have l told you not to fight with those rascals! Yes? Hey, come on now, let's go home. Bloody pig. Aunt, l told him not to fight. Get lost, you dog! Get lost! Mom! - Come on. You will find it much tastier if you eat with your hands. Your wife might disagree, but you should try it. No, thank you. Try it. My house, my rules. Hello. Good evening, folks. we have...guests. what's for dinner? So you found the time to have dinner with us? Mr. Smith, this is my son. He doesn't have any traits of his father. But my wife assures me that he is mine. Eat your food quietly. Don't force me to slap you in front of everyone. And tidy yourself up. Please. Fatima Bi (lady), some flatbreads please. what is it? why do you look so upset? Nothing. - l'll tell you. She is not saying anything because she is scared. we've got a marriage proposal for Noor from a very nice family in Lahore. She wants to accept it right away. But Noor.. Only you can talk some sense into her. Noor, my child, come here. what do you say? Should we send you to Lahore? No. Fatima Bi, you've been with our family for 20 years. l respect you. lt's justified that you are worried about your young daughter. But if she isn't willing, you shouldn't force her. But she says that she doesn't want to get married! what's wrong in starting things off if the family is good? ''what's wrong in starting things off, huh?'' You were acting smart in front of everyone. Are you scared of a bad name or your deed, asshole? Should l marry a stupid Pathan? Should l go to Pakistan, huh? what is wrong with Pakistan? what is good about it? Their cricketers. Their...poets. But what do l like? Do you know? what? l like.. Agangster! This is groovy, man. Groovy. David, coming? You alright? You alright? Don't go out. Your father will get angry. How will he know? Jehanzeb.. lf l know something, he knows it too. David.. You have better things to do. Let's go.. Party! Hey. what's your name? David. what's your name? My name's Mariyam.

But will you call the girl, please? Two flats in Panjim. My third blessing.. For the couple. - For the couple. At least call for the girl. Blessie! And she has even done a beauty course. She is very good in waxing. Have a look. Have a look. She has done everyone's waxing in this house. This house is also on her name. My fourth blessing...for the couple. Today she made me meet a baldy. ln future she will make me meet a dumb, deaf, lame girl. l don't want to get married! l know for sure. Mom is seeing someone. She's having an affair. She wants me to get married and get rid off me, so that she herself can settled down with someone Bonehead, your mother was young when your father passed away. She didn't do anything back then. And now, when she wants you to settle down so that she can die in peace.. You are accusing her. But l can't get married, Frenny. l don't get along with women. So do you get along with me? Yes, l do. Because when Annie left me at the altar.. Everyone laughed at me. You were the only one who cried with me. How many times do l have to tell you, David? Annie stole money from the till and ran away. That's the reason l cried. But...you cried with me, right? Come on, uncle. - But.. Come on, time's up, enough of massage. Come on. You were the only one, right? That's when l promised myself.. That l'll involve you in every aspect of my life. what mess has Annie got me into! Darn her! Come on.. Let me share a secret with you. lt should be top-class, got it? Have you heard about Screwy-Santa? That's me. Screwy-Santa. Mom.. Yeah? Hey! Come on! Get lost! Never come back to my massage parlor. what is this? l'm trying to make things better for you.. And you are yapping about Screwy-Santa all across the village. ldiot. But, dad, Frenny won't tell anyone about it. She is my friend. what kind of a friend is she? She's not your friend. when Annie left you, you became the butt of everyone's joke, right? when these people will find out about your Screwy-Santa act.. ..they will fry you like a fish and eat you up. Okay. Fine. But you tell mom not to get me married. Oh, man. She never listened to me when l was alive. why will she after l'm dead? You miss mom, don't you? Shut up. But there's one thing.. - Yes? Had l been alive, l would've repaired.. ..the short-circuit between you and women. But it's still not too late. Come on, let's get drunk and discuss women. No. Hey! No. l don't want to drink. Are you or aren't you my son? Hey, come on, man. Come on. Let's go. Come, let's get drunk. Sorry. l'm David. Aguitarist. l was here yesterday as well, sir. You were here yesterday. You are here today. You'll be here tomorrow and the day after as well. So what do l do? Sir, if l could meet Mr. Trilok.. Andy, get me a cup of coffee, please. Sit. Thank you. l've been his manager for many years. l know, sir. That's why l've come to you. Sir, if you want.. To want.. lt's important to have something.. Sir, l don't have something.. But, sir, l have a gift for you. what's this? - lt's imported, sir. Made in Hong Kong. - Oh! And this is made in Bandra. And what is this? - My demo tape, sir. For Mr. Trilok. Please. Bitch! Bull.. Mummy! Hi! Hi! Mamma's rock star! School's over? Hey, man. How was school? Good? Fine? - Fine. Are you hungry? - Yes. Yeah? Hi, dad. Hi, uncle. Okay. Go inside. Mamma is coming in two minutes. Ma'am, this is the first song which you've picked up so quickly. l'm impressed. l wanted to learn it quickly so that l can teach it to Shaurya. This song?! - Yup. why this song? This song is so old. Mr. A.K. Hangal used to listen to it when he was just a kid. we'll teach him some nice, rocking song. Actually, Shreedhar and my first car was an old second hand ambassador. One cassette was stuck in its tape recorder. we had to listen to this song time and again, whenever we used to go out. After selling the car, we used to miss this song more than the car. l heard this song again on radio yesterday afternoon. Sometimes l feel as if Shreedhar is.. ..looking for new ways to make me think of him. Okay. So this song, too, has a flashback. This is the problem with memories. They show up anytime, without a reason and tickle you. Tickle? Tickle. Aguitarist and a philosopher. Oh. Jesus took his time while creating me. Oh, really? l'm late. Bye, Neelam ma'am. Got to run. Bye. - Tomorrow at 4:00pm, okay? See you. - Bye. we can't wait any longer. Can he wait? what did you say? No? lf he can't then we can't either. He was getting married next month. Shakeel was my only nephew. You want Ghani, right? l, too, want him. whatever help you need, l'll give it to you. But Ghani will have to die. Ali Akbar mounted on the horse. And fought such a battle at the battlefield.. ..that in Ali Akbar's battle people saw a glimpse of Hazrat Ali. Oh Hussain! - Oh Hussain! Oh Hussain! - Oh Hussain! Oh Hussain! - Oh Hussain! Oh, Sakeena, where are you going? Give him back to me! Hussain! Hussain! Hussain! Hussain Shah! Hussain! Hussain! Hussain Shah! Hussain! Hussain! Hussain Shah! Hussain! Hussain! Hussain Shah! Let's go. Let's go. Sir! Let's go! Let's go! Hurry up! Let's go! Ready? - Ready. One, two, three, four. ''lt's an amazing day.'' ''Just think about it.'' ''lt's just crazy.'' ''Just look around.'' ''You're alone, so am l..'' ''we're having so much fun together..'' How was it? Superb, right? Thanks, David. l've never seen Shaurya so happy. He was looking so cute, wasn't he? He or me? Both of you. Sorry, ma'am. l'll just make a phone call and be right back. Yes, sir? lt's me, David, the guitarist. who? The one with lots of hair? You're the one who gave me that watch, right? Yes, sir. Tell me. what can l do for you? Do you have some work with me? Forget work. Do you have a passport? Yes, sir. l do. And do you have another watch? The watch that you gave me isn't working properly. lt's running backwards. Yes, sir. Of course. l'll get you a new watch. Sir, you were saying something about the passport.. where do l have to go? - To a place where they sell watches. You'll get another watch for me. And you'll give it to me. Got it? Now listen to me very carefully. Mr. Trilok heard your demo tape. He has selected you for a music festival. You have to go to US. Come here with your passport, tomorrow. Hello? Hello? Yes, sir. Thank you so much, sir. So, l'll come there right away. Not today. Come to the office tomorrow with your passport. And don't forget to get a new watch. Forget the watch, l'll get you an alarm clock. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. My rock star! You were so good! Ma'am. Ma'am. Come. Come. Come. what? what? Just come, come, come. Please come. - David. l'm going! l'm going. Didn't l tell you that l'll make it big? l've got a job, ma'am. - wow! Music director Mr. Trilok has personally selected me for his world tour. You know, Neelam ma'am, other than Suzie.. ..you are the only one who believed in me. l have to go home and inform Suzie, Alice, Father Noel.. Father Noel will be the happiest because l'm going. Thank you, Neelam ma'am. You really are my lucky charm. Hey, keep your passport ready. Bye, ma'am. what happened? Your girl won't be coming? No. l mean what if you don't like her? That's what l'm worried about. So what? You won't marry her? You just say it once, brother. Just say it. l'll cancel the wedding right away. But we'll lose the boat as well. Don't blame me later. tuka zai zai ..tuka zai zai bareek bareek wakol tuka zai Hey, she's coming. where were you yesterday? You didn't come to meet me. Oh, church. l thought your father thrashed you.

Scoundrel! Rascal! Son of a bitch! what are you doing?! - You swine! Get off my way. Move! No.. Let go of him. - Let go of me. what...what.. - Let go of me. Let go.. - Father.. Let go of him. Let go of him. Move! Enough! Enough! Enough is enough! Do you want to kill him! lf l want, l can kill you right away. But we want Ghani, not you. we're the same, David. The only difference is, l'm loyal to my country, and you.. To that deceitful Ghani. He has been cheating people for years. First, he killed your father. Then he kept your mother as his keep till she died. All this is a lie. - No, it's not! And now...now he has made you his pet dog. You are ashamed to call him your son? The truth is you are ashamed of yourself. Because you've been an unsuccessful father! lf you would've shown concern for our son.. ..as you showed for David then you wouldn't have to feel embarrassed! All he knows is how to use people. we were here to punish him for the sins he committed in the name of religion. But you have a better reason to punish him. And if you feel that l'm lying, here.. Kill us whenever you want. But if it is true then you'll help us kill Ghani. Come on.. what? David! David! - Yes. Yes. Yes. You are my brother, David! Yes. - Hey, when did you come? maje rani, mazhe moga .. tujhe dolyat sodhata thav .. fulafullak pushit aayalo .. fulafullak pushit.. Love you. He's asleep. Go home. Goodnight. Yes. Bye-bye. what?

Now l know, dad, that you must be feeling sad.. That your son is leaving this house. He's going on a world tour. - But the thing is, dad.. Really? - ..when a bird gets its wings.. lt should fly away. But don't you worry, dear sisters! Very soon, l'll free you two birdies, too, from here. So get ready! Father Noel! Come outside! Father Noel, come outside! Long live Malti 'Tai' (sister)!

Hit him!' 'Hit him! Hit him!' 'This isn't an ordinary battle, this is a battle for religion.' Everything happened so quickly that we didn't get a chance to react. lf you have the courage.. Even a minute is enough. Hey, l know him. He's a real estate agent. The one in black jacket. You know where l can find him? lqbal, get a grip. This isn't the time to shatter. l won't let you shatter. Think sensibly. How will l face the society if anyone comes to know about it? l'll lose the respect l've earned over the years. l've a solution. with Mr. Shah Hussain.. A bride gift of 1.25 hundred thousand pounds on this date. And give it to you for the wedding. Do you accept this marriage? Do you accept this marriage? l do. l do. Sign here. Congratulations. - Congratulations. Congratulations. Sometimes, wrong is right. Especially when it's about your honor. You are family. You understand. Perhaps l am your culprit. But this was necessary. You knew everything. Yet you acted ignorant. This is a temporary wedding. Only on paper. So that we can tell the world nothing's wrong with Jehanzeb. And that he is a decent family man. lt can be nullified in a year. Then you.. You and Noor.. My mother was Ghani's keep. True.. ..or untrue? what are you staring at? l've tolerated enough. l can handle another truth. Did Ghani kill my father? lqbal was madly in love with your mother. But your father was also his good friend. why did he hide this from me? He didn't have the courage. He feared losing you. He still does. David.. A lot of pain and despair lies in your eyes. l want to give you some advice. Don't do anything such in rage which would destroy everything. l'm leaving. Come with me. Did you hear me? Come with me! Leave. You scoundrel! You son of a bitch! Am l only a body?! Don't l have a soul?! You don't want to leave, right? Fine. l'll stay here. with you. ln this house. ln your bed. You grew up without your father, right? But my child will grow up with his father. Did you hear me! Anyone can do anything they want. Dad, l need to talk. Go away. l am busy. Dad, l need to talk. Come.. You should have told me earlier. why are you making a double omelet of a single egg Dad, she kissed me! Kiss! Look at the mark. Oh, come on! A peck on the cheek is not a kiss! Foreigners keep pecking each other on the cheek.. ..all day for no reason . But, dad.. Of all the women in the world, you could only find her? So what if she is deaf and dumb. She is still human! You donkey, she is Peter's fiance. She is your 'Bhabhi' (sister-in-law). Not Savita 'Bhabhi' (slutty sister-in-law). But, dad, l love her.. Oh, my thickheaded son.. l realize you are going to inaugurate at the age of 40.. But know this before you move those scissors. You'll be the one cutting and you'll be the one cut too. Because Peter is your friend. Understand this! You son of a bitch! How dare you make my son drink! Come, let's go. where did she kiss you? Here. Have a look. Here or here? There's a lot of difference. Here somewhere. Plus one. were the eyes open or shut? Hers or mine? Hers! Open. Minus one. what? - Make it rough. Don't go soft. Okay, where were her hands? On your hair.. On your shoulder.. On your back.. Or your.. l don't remember. Another minus point. Okay, for how long did the kiss last? Just a minute. - One full minute! Hey! Come on, man! You are absolutely amazing! Not even heroines kiss for that long. Oh man. l meant give me a minute.. To recall.. Mosquito. Yes. lt lasted for about two seconds. Two seconds. Now you are talking. Look, she is interested in you. That's for sure. Now whether the bank named Roma.. ..gives you 2% interest or 81/2 % interest.. Or whether she gives you full 100% festival bumper.. You should meet her and find that out. Okay. Look, David, in this world there is only one emotion, called love. the rest of them are loose motions. So what do l do now? Get on your ride. Hey! Hey! Hey! l need to talk to you. Not bath. Talk to you. l need to talk to you. Then my marriage got fixed with Annie. Annie.. Annie ran away with her boyfriend on the day of the wedding. My luck is all...bad luck, Roma. And...people in the village consider me as bad luck. l don't get invited to any weddings here. Roma.. Hey. Roma.. Did you feel the same? Did you feel the same way l did...last night.. You, l.. Muah. Yeah. Yeah. The mark. Look at the mark.. You and me.. Did you feel it? l need to talk to him. Stay away. Have you lost your mind? what is wrong with you? You'll get hold of anyone and thrash him? l'm talking to you, David! You think you'll handle everything on your own! You didn't even think about us! l too am angry, David. And we won't stay mum. we'll go to the cops. Look, l'll lodge the compliant. But let me forewarn you of its consequences. You'll lodge a complaint. Her workers will come. Earlier they blackened your father's face. Now they will go for your face. Right? So, why get into this mess? Shall l lodge the complaint? l have a pen. How can they do this? How can they misbehave with your father? How can they blacken his face? How? The law gives the power to the common man. The common man can go to the court and say.. ''Your Honor, give me justice.'' ''l am a common man. Give me justice.'' l can speak to the chairman.. ..and fix a meeting for you with the police commissioner. But l have just one question for you. Are you sure you want to do this? People who can enter into your house in broad daylight and do this.. ..will hardly take any time to gather false evidence against your father. So? what should we do? Forget everything? Truth is not taken seriously in our country. So don't bother. l hate my father, Neelam. l just hate him. But that's between us. l can tell him whatever l want to. l can taunt him, abuse him. He is my dad. l have a right. what relationship does that politician have with my dad? Yes? what relationship? lt's okay. lt's okay. lt's okay. How can she do this to him? lt's okay. - No one did anything for him. Nothing.. David. The house in Birmingham, the hotel in Southall.. And the parking lot in Crompton.. l've spoken to the lawyer and transferred them to you. Don't think that l want to thank you. l am doing so because.. l should do this. lf l knew about Noor and you.. Don't hate me, David. Did l do anything wrong? You can never do anything wrong. who is he? where did you get this? From our place. Once upon a time he was Ghani's Man Friday. l feel you still don't believe that Ghani killed your father. were you there when my father died? But if he was there.. ..then l want to hear it from him about what happened there. l have two conditions if you want me to kill Ghani. You're in no position to keep conditions. My first condition. l want this man. And the second condition? Sir, how did you manage to pull David on your side? David must've made a huge demand to kill Ghani. You've been called here to fulfill a demand of his. what do you mean? where are you going? To my room. Noor.. Now this is your room. No, this isn't my room. David's room is mine. lt would be better if you and others get this straight. But what l'm doing with Peter isn't right. Oh, man. You are once again getting Peter into the picture. l'm feeling sorry for him. Anyway Peter is getting married to Roma for the boat. Right? - Right. And you because you love her, right? Right. Now.. what should l do next? Okay, tell me, who really wants you to get married? That will be me. Oh, no. No. Your mom. Mom. Mom will accept it? - Of course, she will. Tell her, ''Mom..'' - Mom.. ''l was thinking..'' l was thinking.. what's going to happen to me once you pass away? You figure that out after l pass away. l want to get married. Really? - Really? Thank God. l'm so happy, David. l am so thrilled, my son. l am very happy. Really. l am happy. who is the girl? Tell me, who is the girl? lt's Roma. which Roma? Peter's Roma? Yes, Peter's Roma. You stupid swine.. when will ever get some sense into yourself? She is getting married in another 10 days. You know if the village gets to know about this.. ..then they will cut you in pieces. You'll die. Go. Get out of here. Go. what is this, David? Stop it. Untie me. Untie me! - tie me! going to talk to Roma's dad or not? No. God will never forgive me. lt's a sin, David. Please. Please understand, my son. Understand, my son. Now tell me. David. David. No, no, David. will you talk to them or not? No, David. David, no. No. will you do it or not? No. David, no. David. No. No.. l can't live without you. Even l can't live without you. But l want Roma too. Please, mom, talk to them. Please. - Okay. Go. - No. Please. Excuse me.. Mr. Almeda.. Mom! Mom! Mom.. She's going to be under medication for two weeks. And complete bedrest for three weeks. She will not be able to talk for atleast a month. Mom.. l told you.. - Dad! This was not right. That was no coconut. That was a message from God. what message? lt was not a coconut. lt was a warning from Jesus. And what broke was not your mother's head.. ..but a good morning in Jesus's style. That, son, wake up, you have slept long enough. Good morning? 'Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!' ln Kabaddi safety comes first, otherwise.. Ranade 'Bhau' (brother)! l want answers! Ranade 'Bhau'.. l want answers! what do you want? why are you getting yourself hurt everyday? Tell me. why did you hurt my father? Are you repetitively coming here to ask this? ''why did you hurt my father?'' Do you have a death wish? we have no enmity with your father. we thrashed your father for money. Got it? For money? who gave you the money? Malti 'Tai'. why? Business. Your father was thrashed for business purposes. Do you wear underpants? which brand? Jockey? why not Rupa? The material is the same, so is the fit. Even the elastic. Yet you don't. Jockey means cool. Similarly.. Religion, too, is.. Like underpants. God, Lord, Allah, Jesus. Same material, same fitting. But the brokers of religion, the marketing guys.. Try to prove others as bad. This causes riots, fights and such fuck ups. we thrashed your father because his brand is Jesus. And theirs is different. Now quietly go home and take care of your father. what will you do now? Now l'll go and meet Malti 'Tai'. David. l'm Thomas Louis's son. Did you know him? No! Yes! l know him. l know him. Did Ghani kill him? That was an accident. l don't remember anything. You were with Ghani. Tell me, did Ghani kill him? That was a shootout! l don't remember anything.. whose bullet struck whom? Did Ghani kill my father? l'm telling the truth! l don't remember anything! l'm telling the truth! l don't remember anything! Do you even know who your father is? where are you going? why? Jehanzeb, why? Because there's nothing left for me here. l have a wife.. who openly sleeps with you. l have a father.. who is more like a father to you than to me. why should l stay here? why? l know you're angry with him. But the truth is, he loves you a lot. He loves me? He either loves himself, or you. lsn't it, mother? Don't go. Don't go, my son. Don't go. The coconut that fell on your head, mom.. lt was not a coconut. lt was a message from God. Do you also feel so? Then what! lt was a message from God, stating.. ''Boss, the covering of the coconut..'' what is it called? Coconut! Na! The shell.. - Yeah, yeah. The shell is always hard. But if you wish to eat the fresh coconut inside.. ..you will have to break the shell, right? - Yes. You'll have to work hard. Now take me for example. How did the coconut fall on me? How? This is my third time in prison, right? Yes. Right? - Yes. But has that stopped me? No, right? - Yes, you haven't. Right? l'll go and open another parlor. Right? - Yes. Similarly, if you want Roma.. A lot of such coconuts will fall in the future, David. But boss, you shouldn't give up. what should l do now? Asshole.. You take a bribe and yet you raid my parlor. Should l tell your wife.. - No.. Don't.. - About your affairs.. lt's not so, madam. - Then what is it? we've got a new boss. - Okay. lt's his fresh orders. He'll release you by tonight. Listen.. Has my husband come with lunch? Sorry. Look.. l feel, you should involve a senior. who? Everyone hates me. Even the pain in the neck Father Albert. why don't you get Albert sentimental? Look.. Roma loves you. And if Father Albert is forcefully getting her married to Peter.. ..then he is committing a sin. Right, isn't it? And.. And priests aren't allowed to sin. Priests are not allowed to sin. what? Roma and l want to get married. l know Roma is getting married. But whom are you getting married to? To Roma. And Peter? To Roma. So you and Peter both want to get married to Roma. Then how many people does roma want to get married to? No. Peter is going to get married to Roma. But Roma wants to marry me. who do you want to get married to? To Roma. Then Peter? How do l know! l am telling you that l and peter want to get married. Peter and Roma.. Roma and l want to marry. Peter, Roma, Peter, Roma. Peter, Roma. Are you married? Almost. Just got saved. That's why l am a priest. l can see why! Look, David, l don't know what your scene with Roma is. But both the families will have to come and sign an agreement. l can not do all this. l am a priest! But not God! Go, man. Hey. Hey! God has his hands and legs all crucified. Crucified! So he has a reason to not do anything. But what is your reason, man? Bearded priest. Hello - Hello! Hi, baby. Hello. Priests are allowed to sin? Na. He will not do anything for you. You are wrong. He's a man of God. But you are not a man of God. what do you mean? You will have to help me. what? l will not help you. Aren't you my father? Cookie.. Come. Come. Your mummy and daddy are home? Very good. Very good. David is a very good boy. Peter is also a very good boy. Very good. Both of them will keep you very happy. But the question is who do you want to be with? David or Peter or both? Hey, what? Dad.. He's going to be under medication for two weeks. And complete bedrest for three weeks. He will not be able to talk for atleast a month. This was God's second message. You didn't read the first one properly. So he sent another. Follow up. l'm telling you. lt's not too late. Forget Roma. Everything will be taken care of. See you. Goodbye. See you downstairs. - Yeah. See you. See you downstairs. Ma'am, we have a meeting at three in Gowandi. Mr. Roy will also be there. - Okay. Have you informed the driver? - l have. who are you? Move! Ranade 'Bhau'! Ranade.. l want answers! why did you blacken my father's face? who are you? l'm Father Noel's son. Look, son.. - Don't address me as son! Don't.. l forced a relationship on you and you got hyper. You should think about how we feel.. ..when your father forces his God on someone. He has done no such thing. what l did was right. lf your father is guilty then it is good. lf he isn't then too what l did was right. Because this has made your father an example. ln politics you either make your enemy guilty or an example. You are still a kid. You won't understand. Open the lift's door. Otherwise my men will kill you. Open it! Open the door! what harm had my father done to you? Open it! - what had he done! we won't spare you! Move! Move! Open the door! Malti 'Tai', l want answers! - Open the door.. You.. - l want answers, Malti 'Tai'! Take him away! Answer me! - Let's go. l'll answer your questions. - Take him away! Get lost! - Move! - Son of a bitch! - Get lost! Go and ask Malti 'Tai'! what wrong has my father done to you! Yes? Get lost! You come here! Come here! Son of a bitch! Ask your Malti 'Tai' to come here! Long live Malti 'Tai', my ass! Done? Go on! Are you done? Go on! l'll screw Malti 'Tai's' mother! l'll screw Malti 'Tai's' maid! Did you gain anything? who are you? Another of her dogs? Dog? Neither am l her dog nor are they. You are a dog. A dog that barks. But when this barking dog bites, he makes everyone shit. So stop barking and start biting. Bite. Bite! Good luck! See boss this is a war. And in this war the question is of killing or getting killed. And the one who will pick up the weapon to kill first, the victory will be his. Take care, good luck, bark. Stop right there. You don't need to come here any more. You'll get your dues. Leave. Sir, l want to meet Neelam ma'am. l said, leave. Sir, let Neelam ma'am say so, l'll leave. Hey.. - Okay? You are bullish! Hey! Hey! Let go of my hand! - Hey! Let her come, l'll leave. Get out! - Let her come, l'll leave. - Get out! Let go of him. You leave. Dad go inside. Please, dad. David.. - Ma'am.. Please leave. And never come back. Please leave. l can't do this anymore. You are like over here and dad over there.. Even l am angry over these things. Before whom should l cry and scream? Enough is enough! we belong to the lower middle class. we shouldn't expect justice from the system. David.. Forget everything. David! Dad isn't at home! l've looked for him everywhere! l don't know where he has gone! Listen children. Happiness and sadness are a part of everyone's life. ln this world.. lt's not possible that everything in this world goes in our favor. we should try to accept all situations and move ahead in life. That's why it is important for us to understand that.. ..God doesn't give the power to everyone to accept pain. Let's go Let's go. Okay. God is testing you, David. How many tests will He take? Now l'm a double graduate. This is the final test of God. Take Rodriguez for example. He proposed me 17 times. l accepted it when he proposed the 18th time. lf he would've given up the ..then how would this drama company come into existence? Hey, you are the best man tomorrow, right? Yes. So? So it's simple, David. You know how the wedding ceremony takes place, right? Yes. Priest will ask.. Does anyone in the village or family object to this wedding? Yeah. During my wedding my wife objected and ran away! why do you keep looking at that pillar? Listen up. So when the priest will ask does anyone object it.. You object it. The wedding will stop. Yeah. But.. David, are you sure that Roma loves you? Yes. - Then she's unwillingly getting married to Peter. Only you can save it. lt is your duty. lt is my duty. l have to.. Save her. Do you think David will bring Ghani tomorrow? And what will we do about David once we kill Ghani? Once Ghani is dead.. we don't need David. David.. Peter? l lied to you, David. About what? That l'm getting married to Roma for the boat. l don't want any boat, David. The thing is when l saw her for the first time in church.. lt was love at first sight. what happened? why did they stop? what relationship did you and my mother share? Tell me, father. Let's go. Let's go. lt's been my privilege and honor working with you. Here is to my friend and colleague General Pramod Bhatt. Cheers! - Cheers! So what do you plan to do next? Nothing immediately. My daughter is in America. l'm thinking of paying her a visit. well, have a good trip. Thank you. Hello? Hi. Hi. lmam sahib? Yes. Just a minute. lmam sahib, it's lqbal. l hope.. l'm about to do the job l came here for. l'm going to be back home soon. Have patience. who is that? who's on the line? Hello? lqbal, is that you? ls that you? lqbal, talk to me. Don't do what you've gone there to do. lt's wrong. lt's not wrong, mother. lt's not wrong. This revenge is necessary. A lot of blood has been lost. lt's enough. There's some left. Father! A lot of blood has been lost. lt's enough. There's some left. Amen. Rings, please. Please exchange the rings. ln the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit. l now pronounce you man and wife. Let go, man. Hey, l am okay. what's your problem, huh? Just, just, just relax okay. Just relax, okay? Beautiful. She is so beautiful. Lucky guy. Not him, you. what? Only a selected few are destined this pain. This pain gives a strange pleasure. Right? You are very lucky, mister... David. My name is David. All the problem lies in this name. David! lf l would've been Peter.. l would've been with Roma. But l am not Peter, l am David. why am l David? You are David because you can't be Peter. The thing which David did today.. ..Peter perhaps could've never done it. You'll find many people in this world who are like Peter. But David.. But people like David are very rare. Thanks, Father.. David. My name is Father David. - Dav.. l hope you remember the name. Yes. David? Father David.
