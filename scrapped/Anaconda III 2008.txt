 

                        Take it easy, Peter. Not the kind of research you expected, huh? Relax. Sit back and enjoy the ride. Take a shot in his head! Lord, have mercy. My arm! So, what do you think? Glad you came, right? You said you wanted to be rich. Well, this is what it looks like. Glad you made yourself comfortable. God! God help us. So, what you're stating is that wexel Hall Pharmaceuticals... have denied knowledge of genetic testing... on animals at their secret labs in Eastern Europe. The fact that CEO J.D. Murdoch personally contacted Peter... to deny these claims, we feel gave total credence... to the leak that testing was more inhumane than we have ever seen. Can you be more specific without divulging your informants? Our sources reported and I quote: "The testing we witnessed is more cruel, more grotesquely evil... than the American people could ever imagine. " Good morning, Mr. Murdoch. Good morning, Mr. Murdoch. Good morning, Mr. Murdoch. Stay. Good morning, Mr. Murdoch. Handshake says a lot about a man, Pinkus. Yes, sir. Can I get you a cup of coffee, sir? Cut the pleasantries. There's been a leak. A leak? PETA. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals... have launched an enquiry with public relations. Where exactly is our facility and what exactly are we doing there? Now I'm asking myself, "How did they find out about us?" Well, I can assure you, Mr. Murdoch. I will find out. I am the public face of Wexel Hall. When that face is damaged... - I am damaged. - I understand, sir. Not to mention that every drug company in the world... is crawling up our ass, trying to beat us to the finish line. I could double security but until we've identified the source... - it would be pointless. - It is your job! And you will do your job. Or the only thing you'll be supervising is a proctologist... removing my boot from your rectum. Do you understand? Yes, sir. What is the status of the project? We've hit some delays. You've hit some delays. Now why is it I'm not surprised? What sort of delays? Kane will answer all your questions. Where is Kane? Just this way, sir. This is a live feed of the queen anaconda's tank. Completely motionless. Just like my first wife. Don't let her slumber fool you. She's 1200 pounds of pure crushing power. As I said, just like my first wife. Good to see you, Mr. Murdoch. I wasn't expecting you until next week. Professor, as you know, I'm a man in a hurry. Our staff's been working around the clock... and I'm fully aware of your schedule. Good. Because I'm paying you for results. As you know, we have successfully synthesised and produced... a blood- orchid extract. Our patient tolerates the serum just like snakes in the wild do... with zero negative side effects. And no signs of aging. The synthetic serum is fully efficacious. Yes, at present only in snakes. But there is something you must see. Please? This is more like it. But tell me, what is it that snakes have that we don't have? We still have not determined why the extract is non- toxic in the snake... but lethal in humans. But you told me you had made some progress. There has been. We've reduced but not eliminated the toxicity. - In dogs and in chimpanzees. - Even mice. Mice administered a steady dose of the serum... show signs of a reduced rate of aging. But ultimately, they die... from some mechanism we don't fully understand. Mr. Murdoch, this is Darryl. Hello, Darryl. Nice to meet you, sir. - This way, sir. - Impressive. Very impressive. Well, the bottom line, Mr. Murdoch... is that we've developed a second- generation serum... by producing a new strain of the orchid. We hope to solve the problem at the source. Behold the miracle of modern science. Behold the miracle? I can't see anything. We keep it dark to create an artificial sleep cycle for the creature. Ugly son of a bitch, isn't it? What is that? It was a typical anaconda. It certainly isn't typical now. - How's my baby doing today? - He's hungry again. - What's the ambient temp of the cage? - Sixty- five. Let's cosy it up five degrees. And increase the cynanol mix by 20 cc's. Okay. Are you telling me a regular dosage of serum is what's produced this? For the most part, we wanted to see... Amazing. Four months ago, he could fit in a shoebox. That's probably how he feels right now. Suits are here. Yeah, I know. And I intend to find out why. In fact, quite the opposite. It's bigger, faster, stronger. And a hell of a lot meaner. We're making progress but we need larger tanks and additional security. - I was getting to that. - Were you? Mr. Murdoch, our herpetologist, Dr. Amanda Hayes. I've submitted four requests to Pinkus. And every time his answer is, "It's not my call. " So whose call is it? Yours, Mr. Murdoch? Please excuse Dr. Hayes. She's not familiar with the protocol. I'm very familiar with the protocol. I'm doing what you pay me for. Minding the well- being of our reptiles and watching our asses. Dr. Hayes. You give me a marketable product... and I will buy you the biggest animal park this side of the equator. We need larger facilities now. I'll see what I can do. You have to do better than that. You're not handling 60- foot snakes... with massive appetites. We are understaffed and in way over our heads. What does she mean by that? If you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I have some cultures to examine. Pinkus. - It's nothing. - Nothing? I'm paying you an obscene amount of money to keep this research on track. It is clearly not on track. And my very expensive expert there is concerned. Money is not the problem. If we stopped every time we needed to expand or upgrade... we'd be months behind. Everything here is custom- made. It takes time. And time is what I do not have. - Amanda? Excuse us. - Sir? Sure. What is the matter with you? I didn't go to med school to serve a life sentence. It's just a means to an end. Whose end? For what? So some sick billionaire can defeat death? - What do you mean he's sick? - Come on, Eric. You didn't see it? Pupils dilated, pale skin, coughing? Not to mention his severe weight loss? It looks to me like he's got cancer, which means he's dying. Amanda. We're at the brink of saving millions of lives. Can you imagine a drug, that could revitalise cancer patients... and reverse Alzheimer's? Do you really still believe that? Don't you? I don't know. For something that's supposed to be so good, why does it feel wrong? You knew what we were doing when we started the research. Yeah, but I expected it to be handled with more responsibility. We're tampering with evolution, Eric. Come on. It's just a big snake. Yeah, well, that's definitely an understatement. - All right, I'll talk to you later, okay? - Okay. Bigger, tougher, meaner, eh? I could use a bit of that. That's not a good idea, sir. You're telling me the serum is responsible for this? Sir? Sir, turn that light off. Turn that light off. What the hell happened there? Pinkus? The warning lights in the tank are starting to go crazy. - What's going on? - I told you not to do that. - Hit the gas. - What's going on? - What's going on? - More lights are flashing. There's a lot of movement. - Don't you touch that gas! - Darryl, hit the goddamn gas! - You're gonna kill it. - No, we're not killing- - Don't put the gas on. - Please, Darryl! - Hit the goddamn gas. Sir. Sir. - I won't let you kill it! Calm down. It will only sedate the snake. Don't you tell me what- - Darryl! Darryl? - What's happening? - What's happening? - Darryl- Look, look. Don't worry, Mr. Murdoch. That's three- inch polycarbonate glass. Well, it's not enough. - What's it doing? - Everybody, just stay calm. - The gas will sedate it. - Are you sure? He'll settle down, I'm sure. Everybody calm down. It's fine. Finally. Now let's just leave him be. Darryl, call Kane. Let him know what happened. I'll call the technicians to get this repaired. - Darryl. Hit the alarm. Lock us down. - Hit the alarm! Hit the alarm! Loading results- Everyone outside. Stay calm. Everyone outside. Let's go. - We're safe. - We gotta help him. - What? Screw him. - He's my friend. - There's a monster out there! - I've got to help him! If the snake doesn't get you, the gas will! Now, shut up! Oh, my God. - What happened? - What do you think? What the hell did you do? Where's Darryl? Darryl didn't make it. We've gotta go. Let's go. - You said the gas would knock it out. - He's looking for a way out. We have to contain him. Security, lockdown. - Full lockdown. - Yes, sir. I'm locking down right now. Amanda, get the guns. Hey, hey, hey. Where do you think you're going? - I'm getting Murdoch out of here. - Nobody's going anywhere. Grab a gun! - No way. I'm getting out of here. - Pinkus. Take the gun! This is not a drill. All personnel should exit immediately to your designated safety zone. This is not a drill. - The sedatives must have taken effect. - Are you sure? Yeah. That stuff would knock out 10 rhinos. It's a stun gas. It will only last for five minutes. We don't have time. Get the masks. Pinkus? Escort Mr. Murdoch out of here. Yeah. Yeah. Sir? This is not a drill. All personnel should exit immediately to your designated safety zone. - Get out. - This is not a drill. All personnel should exit immediately to your designated safety zone. - Have you seen Janet? Is she outside? - She's already gone. This is not a drill. All personnel should exit immediately to your designated safety zone. This is not a drill. All personnel should exit immediately to your designated safety zone. This is not a drill. All personnel should exit immediately to your designated safety zone. This is not a drill. All personnel... This is not a drill. All personnel should exit immediately to your designated safety zone. Okay. Oh, God. - It's Darryl. - All personnel should exit... to your designated safety zone. - Are you okay? - Come on. - Let's get through this. - This is not a drill. All personnel should exit to your designated safety zone. Where is it? Over here? This is not a drill. - All personnel should exit... - Where is it? to your designated safety zone. Oh, God. He's not in here. - Where would he go? - I don't know. But we better find it fast. He's gone after the queen. - Let's go. - Come on. This is not a drill. All personnel- How are we gonna explain that one, huh, Pinkus? Don't tell me you haven't got a backup lighting system. Please don't tell me. It should come on in a minute. Let's get out of here quickly. Quickly. Oh, God. Oh, God. I hate when you're right. So do I. Susan. Oh, no. She's gone. He broke her out. This is all my fault. Run! Have you any idea what this is gonna cost to cover up? Yes. No. I mean, yes. I know exactly... I want this place cleaned! I want it cleaned properly. Sir? Might I advise that we can still salvage this situation? On- site security team is here. We have a team of professional trackers on their way. You'll do whatever you have to do. But you will be with them 24 hours a day. - What do you mean, sir? - You're a supervisor, Pinkus. Supervise. Otherwise, I will have them test that serum on you. But, sir, I don't do field work. I want news, Pinkus. - Good news. - Pinkus. Name's Grozny. Until I hear good news, you will report to me hourly. Yes, sir. Grozny. Follow me. I'll brief you on the situation. Come on, guys. It took five shots to bring them down. We'll give you 20 at market rate. Look, guys. I don't care what kinky plans you're into. But these are 5- pound Java rhino horns. So I suggest you go to an ATM teller. One that dispenses some respect. Thirty thousand or nothing. Deal. Always a pleasure. Pleasure. Give us the envelope. Okay. I got $30,000 in crisp American bills. Now, if you want euros you'll have to go to Greece or a bank. I get them confused. I'm- Hang on. Yeah? Pinkus? I'm a little busy right now. What? Oh, let me guess. You didn't reinforce the cages and the snakes got out. This is serious. We are prepared to pay and I need you here to lead the team. Yeah. I'll be there as soon as I can. What? What? - What's your name? - Florin. Florin? - It's for you. - What? Always know the animal before the hunt. These creatures are one of a kind. - Growing to become 60 feet long. - Sixty- foot snakes? - I've got one of those. - Dreamer. Please! They are fast and very strong. Having never dealt with anything like this, I urge you to use extreme caution. We must bring them down. It is imperative. - And they are more than 60 feet- - Thank you, Dr. Hayes. I will handle this briefing. My team know these woods like our own backyard. It's easier than that. We also know their location. We try and keep a short leash on our investments. In case of emergencies. We're moving out in 10. Hammett's on his way. We should wait. We're not waiting. Not when we know where the snakes are. We need to strike fast. Like I said, we move out in 10. - Man, he wants all the glory. - You're right. You know how he feels about Hammett. - Yep. - You heard the man. Ten minutes. I need to speak with you privately. Why haven't you called the government? The company is handling this matter privately. Company has no idea what we're dealing with. Do I need to remind you that you signed a strict confidentiality contract? There are innocent people that need to be warned. Our professionals will resolve this matter swiftly and efficiently. And as for you, take this as a friendly warning. Do not interfere. I am responsible for those animals. Nobody knows their behaviour better than me. Those snakes aren't gonna bask in the sun and roll over for you. I'm coming with you. You're not the one handling 60- foot snakes with massive appetites. we are understaffed and in way over our heads. Can you imagine a drug that could revitalise cancer patients... and reverse Alzheimer's? Do you really believe that? Don't you? Please excuse Dr. Hayes. She's not familiar with the protocol. Miss Hayes? Yeah? You like travelling light? I don't think I'd feel really comfortable with that. It would make you comfortable... if you came face to face with a 60- foot snake. I already have, remember? I helped create them. Besides, that's why you guys are here. I'm giving you the best chance to survive. It's no problem, Amanda. Just stick with Nick. Nick? Introduce her to the bazooka. The bazooka. Twenty- four knockouts, regional city champ. Can I see that gun again? Oh, sorry. You know, Dragosh... they say you should never look them in the eyes. And? What else? They have the powers of mesmerising. - That's bull. - No, no, no, it's true. I heard a story of a hunter who stared in the eyes of the anaconda too long. Suddenly, he was hypnotised. It swallowed him alive. You want me to stuff this rifle down your throat? Don't be an ass, Andrei. You know he's afraid of snakes. I'm not afraid of snakes. I just don't like them. You don't have to like them. You just have to like killing them. I'm fine with that. Damn wolves! We're close. - Got it. - Follow them. Well, the signal's coming from around here. It could be anywhere within 100 yards. These bastards detect heat, so you're always prone to attack. Don't forget that. Nick? Andrei? See who's home. - Dragosh, check the barn. - All right. - You two, around the back. - Let's go. Come on. Let's go. - What about us? - Mr. Pinkus. Miss Hayes. Stay put. - If they were here, you'd see evidence. - Yeah, you're absolutely right. That's why we're looking around. Grozny. You may need this. Thanks. Hello? Anybody home? - Hello? - Try the door. It's not locked. Why would it be? It's like Little House on the Prairie. Let's check around the back. I'm... sorry about the professor. He was a good man. Yeah, thanks. Dragosh, it's reading. We're close. Keep your eyes peeled. All clear. Listen, I'm going in. I can't wait anymore. You go around back, I'll take front. Okay. Go check over there. Hey, better safe than sorry, huh? Be vigilant, guys. We know it's nearby. Come on, guys. It's 60 feet long. The place is deserted, maybe they went out for supplies. That's slightly disturbing. What happened to it? When they don't like a meal they spit it back up. I'd eat it. Come on, guys. It's just a goat. If these beasts only eat things that look good... if I were you Miss Hayes, I'd be very careful. Excuse me? I hate to interrupt, but we got a job to do. Over here. Dragosh, Victor, stay here. Andrei, hang back. That makes things a little more difficult. - Tight leash, isn't that what you said? - Let's put Plan B into effect. And what might that be? I don't know yet. I don't understand how it sheds so quickly. Ecdysis. It only happens when the snake grows too large for its skin. Which means it's growing pretty damn fast. All right. Victor, I want you to start putting the supplies in order. Dragosh, set up a lookout around here. Andrei, around the back. Nick? Oh, God! No! Get him! Go! Go! Get it! Over there! Outside! Go! Go! Take that, you son of a bitch. Go! Go! Go! - Come on. Come on. - Go. Go. - Get something. Check the jeep. - There it is. Quick! Get my bag. Get it! How is he? Dragosh! Cease fire! Cease fire! Amanda, help Grozny. Pinkus, in Grozny's jeep there's a fire extinguisher. The rest of you follow me. We end this now. Come on. - Let's go. Come on. - Right. Fire extinguisher. Hurry up! Stop! - What? - Sofia. Andrei. Victor. Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on! - Get my bag! - Where is it? - Hurry up! - What? - Come on! - Just a sec- I'm coming. Open it up. Quick. - Hurry! - Okay. Hold on. - I don't know which- - Hold him down. Give me the elastic. - There. - No, the elastic. I don't know. I don't know. - Give me the elastic. - There, there. Now hold him down. Hold him down. - Pinch this artery. - I don't know what I'm doing. Pinch off his artery. Hang in there! I don't know what I'm doing, Amanda. I don't know. Just put pressure and don't let go. - Right here. Don't let go. - Okay. - Okay? - It's okay, Grozny. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Where are you? Where are you hiding, huh? Come on. - I see it. - Where? Where? Twelve o'clock. Got it. There. - Damn, it's big. - Let's go! Sofia! Come on. Got something for you. That's not good. - Put pressure! - I don't feel a pulse! - He doesn't have a pulse. It's over! - Shut the hell up! Amanda, he is gone! - Shut the hell up. Just put- - Amanda, it's over! No. Come on. Come on. Amanda, he's dead. Come on. Victor. Come on. Don't move. You take the cake for leaving without me. It wasn't my idea. - We have to kill it. - Take it easy! What do you wanna do? Grab it by the tail? - We're gonna find this thing. Relax. - It's about time, Hammett. Good to see you too, Nick. Come on. Gather around. - We gotta make a plan. - Hammett. - Hammett. - Andrei, get the steel case... in the back of my car. All right. Listen up, guys. We've all worked together before. Simple rules, okay? Once you see this thing, you unload everything until it stops moving. And you shoot only for the head. Nothing else will bring this thing down. Follow my lead, I'll take you up this snake's ass. Let's go. What's that? It's a tracking device. Victor, you, Sofie, Amanda in the jeep. Nick, Pinkus, you're with me and Andrei. - I think I'll stay here. - Suit yourself. But you're gonna miss all the excitement. We're getting close. The signal is becoming stronger. There! Come on! Don't lose it. We're almost there. - Stay with them. - I am! Come on! This way. Quick. We got it. I repeat, we got it. Stay on it! - I am trying. - Try harder. Andrei, lose the tracker. We're onto him now. It's the end of the line for these bastards. Damn it, try to keep this car steady. - You okay? - Thanks. Don't mention it. How is that possible? It's burning! - It just spit on my face. - You okay? - Cover your eye. Go! - Where is he? Drive, quick. - Where is he? - Go left. Go. It's burning. I think my leg is broken. My leg. Victor? Victor. Oh, God. Sofia? Sofia. - Amanda? - Do you see him? Amanda, I think my leg is broken. Okay. Okay. I'm coming. My leg. Amanda. Amanda. You all right? - Amanda. - Hammett. Hammett. Hammett. Oh, my God. No, no, no. Oh, God, just get me out of here. Please. No. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay. He didn't see me. It must be the mud. - He couldn't sense me. - Where are the others? - They're dead. - All right. Let's catch up with Nick and Andrei. You'll be all right. What have I done? I don't know what's going on. Murdoch called and said I should be here. - I have no idea why he didn't call. - Do you think it's possible? Is what possible? - Amanda- - What's going on? - Nothing. - Oh, really. Like you guys are here discussing the weather. You wanna give us a moment. Gladly. What? We were discussing the possibilities of bringing this creature down. Oh, really? How come I don't believe you? You don't even know me. I've worked with Pinkus enough to know he's always got an agenda. When I see someone I don't trust talking to another I don't trust... I don't get all warm and fuzzy inside. That's where the whisky comes in, darling. You two vipers can talk business all you want. I'm gonna go call the Army. Damn, you sure are hot when you're making threats. I'm not making any threats. I'm gonna go call the Army. She's hiding something big. - Yeah, the Army. - What do you mean? I'm not sure but she knows something. - Your fault. - My fault? I don't think so. - I got a bad feeling about her. - Let's find out what it is. I may not have a fancy Ph. D., but I know one thing. There ain't a snake on this planet that can skewer people with its tail. We weren't expecting this much trouble. - Really? - What are you two discussing? Yeah, Amanda, why don't you tell them. What were we discussing? A serum. Okay. We gave it a serum. Sort of a DNA tune- up. Transgenics. Snakes are the only animals that can tolerate the new serum. We had to find out why. So we altered its DNA... in an attempt to isolate the gene that makes it immune to toxicity. And the enormous size of the spike in the tail is because of the drugs? - We believe the serum is responsible. - Well done, doctor. Do you think I intended this? We were developing a drug... - that would save lives. - I think you failed there. No, no. We didn't fail. We were on the cusp of a breakthrough. But there's a reason why I came along. I don't like where this is going. I don't know how it could get any worse. She's pregnant. I was wrong. - The female is about to give birth. - When? In less than 24 hours, if not sooner. Normal little snakes, right? Like the black one. Why the hell would you allow something like that? For research. The offspring would put us closer to perfecting the serum. Serum. And just what was this serum supposed to do besides wreak havoc? A giant step towards the cure for cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Giant's the operative word here. We can sit and argue about this or we can do something. In less than 24 hours this country's gonna be overrun. - Give me the SAT phone. - What? - Calling the military. - Good call. - You wanna do that? - What else is there? - Hold on. Let's hear Hammett out. - Our mission is based on secrecy. Call the military, we're kissing our paycheques goodbye. There are thousands- No, millions of lives at stake here. - Make that call. - Wanna go to jail? - I heard transgenics were illegal. - Better 10- by- 10 than 6 feet under. She's right. We're not equipped to deal with this, no way to find them. I disagree. Our chances are excellent. I know where the snakes are. - How? - I shot one with a tracker. One that can't be shed. Besides... wanna call in the military? They won't be here in time. You better be right. - Coffee? - Sure. Thanks. Look... maybe we got off on the wrong foot. Oh, I see. You've come here to apologise, have you? No. Actually, I came here to offer you a job. Well, then, I'd have to question your intelligence. Why is that? Because you're the great white hunter and I'm with the Ph. D., remember? Oh... Wow... I just hope that you're as good as everybody says you are. No. I'm better. Got it. - The old industrial park. - Okay, let's go. - You don't have to go. - One of us needs to stay. - You good with that? - Sure. Be our eyes. If anything changes, let us know immediately. Got it. Straight ahead. - Pinkus? - Yeah. Stay back and cover us, huh? Okay. You're almost right on top of it. Okay... It's gotta be in here. Now. I go high. - Low left. - Low right. One, two, three. Oh, no. Sofia. Pinkus. Pinkus, hold on. They're coming this way. I need backup. Amanda's spotted the snakes. We'll be right there. Leave him. There's nothing we can do. Leave him. Sorry. I saw them go this way. Let me guess. They swim. Unfortunately, very well. This is where they went in. - What's the temperature of that water? - Forty, maybe 50 degrees. Well, they're cold- blooded, so they can only last, like, 20 or 30 minutes. Thirty minutes. Seven miles an hour. Puts them on that side of the lake. They would swim until they found a food source. Which means... What? - She's about to give birth. - What are you saying? The anaconda lays their young next to an abundant food supply. The city. - What can we do? - Find out where they went. - And we keep tracking. - Keep tracking? Are you nuts? Half our crew is dead. If we had called this in like Amanda... Nobody wanted this, man. Let me tell you a bit about the military. They're as reliable as a bottle of Jack at an AA meeting. You are full of it. You've done nothing but get us killed. Let me paint you a clearer picture. In about 12 hours, this entire country is gonna be overrun... with baby snakes that will eat you and everything in their paths. Now, we can either find them and stop them or we can call in the military. - Call them. - Andrei, give me the SAT phone. Yeah, it's Hammett. Put me through to Major Reysner. Major, a situation has arisen that requires your urgent assistance. A 100- foot mutated anaconda... has escaped a confined facility near Baiton. We've been tracking it for two days. We lost five men. Now our concern is for the local citizens. We need backup ASAP. Thank you. I'll alert my team. I'll keep the SAT phone on and triangulate our position. Andrei, keep it on. Everyone happy? Now, you got two choices. You go home with a great snake story or you go with me. I intend on getting a nice new pair... of anaconda snakeskin boots in the morning. Five more minutes, honey. Your father will be home soon. I got you. - What do you see? - Unnatural patterns in the bushes. Patterns in the dirt. Every animal's got his stamp. You just gotta know how to find them. Call the others. Hammett's found the trail. We're heading northwest. Our coordinates are 64982 by 450938. Over. We're heading west now. We should intersect Fairago Road... about 2.1 kilometres from your location. Assuming that you stay on that heading. Sounds right. Out. Okay. Turn here. What? We're less than a quarter mile from our rendezvous? - Right. - We have 20 minutes till they get here. What're you getting at? That factory is everything a giant snake would want in a home. We have weapons and the time. Let's go. Yeah, I'm with you. What is it? Trail just disappeared. - It can't just disappear. - Yeah, I know. It's gotta be here somewhere. The trees. Look out! - You okay? - Yeah. But I think God wants us to fail. Not just yet, pal. Not just yet. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Well, at least we've established a rendezvous. Let's get the hell out of here. Take a look at this. Well, if there's blood, there's more blood. Let's find it. Bingo. This snake just made our job a hell of a lot easier. Let's go. - Did you see that? - Yeah. We got a visual on the snake, 20 degrees west of your location. - Old abandoned power plant. - Try him again. Andrei, do you copy? - I guess we're on our own. - Give me the biggest gun you have. - How cute. - Just kidding. - This big enough for you. - It'll have to do for now. We're clear. You ready for this? Not even remotely. Attagirl. Nice apartment. We saw it come in here, right? It would've been hard to miss. - This must be the guestroom. - Yeah. I say we go over there. Okay. - The blood, here's the snake's blood. - Yeah. That makes me feel a lot better. There's more right here. Hold on. Hold on. Clear. You got my back? I got your back. - They're playing hide and seek? - Watch out! It's just rats. It's only rats. Just snake snacks. Hammett. That's it. All right, keep up. Where'd he go? No! Wait! Stop! No! Shoot me. Damn it, Amanda! Take me out! What are you doing? Nick, no! What are you doing? No! No! Don't do it! What do I do? Run! Hurry! - Give me the SAT phone. - We have to help them. You go on ahead. I'm gonna check back. Four miles northeast of location. The old power plant. You can't miss it. Murdoch residence. It's Mr. Reysner. Please, put me through to Murdoch. Just a second, sir. Mr. Murdoch, Mr. Reysner on line for you. Tell him, I'll call him back on the other line. Yes, sir. I told you not to call me on any line but this one. Sorry. It won't happen again. I wanted to let you know that everything is going as planned. We're right on schedule. Good. No one must know anything about this. That won't be a problem. Just make sure our money's in place. Oh, God. Oh, my God, I thought you guys were dead. - Our radio was broken. - Where's Nick? - He's dead and so is the black one. - The queen? - I think it's down that hall. - What's this? - It's a slug. - A what? - An infertile membrane, a dead egg. - What? - She's about to start laying. - Then let's finish this and get out! Sixty seconds will give us enough time. We'll blow this whole place. What the hell? Hammett? Quite a sight, isn't it? The miracle of birth. I can't believe you wanna destroy something so beautiful. Toss the gun down, soldier girl. What? You don't think I'd shoot you? Good girl. You have no idea what you're doing. I think I do. Ten million dollars for just one baby snake. You're working with Murdoch? You are not a doctor for nothing. There's no special forces unit, is there? Two for two. Why don't you just shoot me? Well, you could be a meal. Or you could take a bullet and be a meal. Or you could work for a brand- new employer... who could use your expertise in continuing the research. You cut me in on the 10 million? Negotiable. Okay. Okay. Not! So you wanna play. I'm trying to be nice to you. Let me go. Happy trails, slimy bitch. Your 10 mil's about to go up in flames, Hammett. I hope that's not the only thing. Good knowing you. Reysner, you have a package for me? Yes, Mr. Murdoch, I have one. I will begin research immediately. You show me proof... the money will be wired direct to your account.
