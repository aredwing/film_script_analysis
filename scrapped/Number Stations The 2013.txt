Agents on the ground wearing a as a one-time pad, as well as fall. Each page is a new code. When you send something, agent compared with the first set of numbers those on the page in the notebook. That means that the benefits the site, and only there, to decipher the message. When ends, destroying the page. So should we make other transfer to cancel this. Each key is a one-off. Totally random. Absolutely it is impossible to break the code, Unless you have original code. It changes with each shift. So we need a code? Yes, we should. matter how seems that we are here you hurt, kill, I assure you, assure both that's the worst case scenario. They must have left computer is switched on. Do not scare me. -Shut up!
