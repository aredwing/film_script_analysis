Oh, looks like there's someone for everyone. Ah, yes. Too bad there's only one of me to go around, eh? Ha! One is plenty. Believe me. Ah, thanks. Hey! - Was that a shot? - Maybe. - Take that back! - No! Take that-- Back. Are you guys gonna fight all day or help me get ready for the festival? There he is in his triumphant return. Dashing gadabout town, eh? Come on. Let's get the marble out, huh? We have to polish La Fidele. - And what's the festival-- - Without the bell? Or the bell-ringer! Toro! Toro! - Toro! Toro! - Charge! Zephyr, you need to slow down. Okay... Mom. - Listen to your mother, young man. - Yes, Papa. Look at her. La Fidele, you are magnificent. Are you gonna ring it once for my mom, Quasi? You bet he is, and your mother's gonna be down in the square... screaming loudly into the night... "I love my husband Phoebus." Oh, really? And what makes you think that I'm gonna shout so loudly? You'll have to to be heard over me yelling... "I love Esmeralda!" - Yuck. - Yeah. Yuck. Whose name are you gonna yell tomorrow, Quasi? - No one, I guess. - Then who's gonna scream your name? I don't think anyone ever will, Zephyr. Well-- Well, why not? Quasi. Takes more than looking to really see. Someday you'll be ready. And when you are, you'll find her. Someday. Nah. What could possibly ever change? Oh, boy! Wow! It's the circus! - A giraffe! - Look how tall he is! - Look! - Oh, look at the monkey. Come, mes amis! As part of the Festival D'Amour... a circus has come to Paris! Come one, come all... to Cirque de Sarousch! See juggling clowns... fire-breathers and magic. And now, may I present the prettiest ornament on the midway... I can't see! my assistant, Mad-- Well, my assistant, Made-- - It's empty! - There's no one there. Well-- Well, of course not! You have to come to the circus to see her. Where is Madellaine? And pull! Mesdames and messieurs... kindly direct your attention high above... as the magnificent Madellaine... is about to perform her daring high-wire act... without a net. Oops. And the crowd goes wild. A hush comes over the crowd as Madellaine begins her graceful trek. Madellaine catches her breath having nearly plummeted to her death. And the crowd bursts into applause! As they scream for more! Encore! Thank you. You're too kind. Where were you, my little trinket? Oh, well, I-I-I was, um-- I-I was standing. Well, of-of course I was standing. I mean, I haven't always been sitting. That would be stupid, I guess. I'm sorry. I-I-I just want to contribute more to the circus. Your job is to stand there and look pretty. Hello. Oh, lovely. - I wanna do more. - And so you shall, my little clair. I have the perfect job for a girl like you. Up in the tower of Notre Dame... is a bell of extraordinary value. I want you to go up there and find out which is the bell called La Fidele. - Why? - Because I mean to steal it, silly. I'll be rich. I can travel the world in style and comfort. No. Why must we always steal? I-I was thinking-- Thinking? Not your strong suit, is it, my little bonbon? No, it's mine. - And where would you be without me? - On the streets. Precisely. For it's a cold world out there-- For a girl like me. What do I do? Oh. Lovely. There's a bell-ringer that lives in the tower. Smile at him. Wile and beguile him... and he'll tell you exactly what I want to know. Uh, hello. - Damsel alert. - And a lovely vision at that. What am l, chopped liver? I-l'm looking for the bell-ringer. She wants you, big guy. Is anyone here? - Get out there, sweetie. - I-I-I can't. What would I say? Open your mouth. Something will come out. - I-I-I-- - Nothing came out. My name is Madellaine. I-l'm with the circus... and, oh, I just love bells. Which one is La Fidele? The bells, you ding-dong. She likes the bells. Talk shop. Are-Are you hiding from me? No. What's so funny? Nothing. It's just-- It looks like you're wearing a really big hat. Oh. That-- That sounds silly, doesn't it? No. I just never looked at it that way before. Yes, it's a-- It's a brass beret. A-A 2-ton topper. A-A chapeau in C-sharp! - The gargoyles! - Gargoyles? Well, they were-- they were alive! But that's dumb, isn't it? No. You must think I'm stupid. Not at all. That just means you have an imagination. - Do you really think so? - I do. - What's your name? - Quasimodo. Well, Quasimodo... wouldn't you like to come where I can see you? I h-h-have to go. I'm sorry. Oh, poor kid. Are you okay? No. You saw the way she looked at me. Well, then, get her to look again, honey. - Do you believe in miracles? - Miracles? What kind of miracles? Oh, you know, just ordinary miracles. I'm not following you, kid. Well, I see people together, couples... and it looks so nice being with someone who loves you. I guess I'm just wondering if... maybe someone could love me. Imagine someone to love who loves you Imagine To look in her eyes and see Imagine how miraculous it seems to be But it's not so very rare You can find it anywhere It's an ordinary miracle The kind you find around you every single day Or maybe it's just seasonal Like spring and May They're so many The ordinary miracle A common kind of miracle that runs right by Or maybe it's too gradual to catch your eye So you miss it A sudden bolt of distant lightning Cathedrals rising out of stone A baby starts to walk or talk one day Then shockingly he's grown And in love That volcano of emotion Not 10, 000 gypsy potions Can undo Yes, it's love well, of course my view is slanted But people do take love for granted Sad but true Of all the many miracles Mysterious and marvellous and big and small when people fall in love it really beats them all Oh, to see it To feel it To know it Imagine someone to love who loves you Imagine to look in her eyes And see Imagine how extraordinary It would be If an ordinary miracle Happened to Me Go to the circus! Make a good impression! Hmm, what does one wear to a carnival event? - Nothing. - Daring! Oh! Maybe a bit pushy for a first date. Quasi, you can stay here and hope for a miracle... or you can get out there and make a miracle of your own. You're right. I'm off to the circus! - Oh, but what am I gonna wear? - I got the perfect thing, kid. Well, how do I look? Uh, too much? - No, no. I mean-- - Of course not. - Wow! Great hat, Quasi. - It's a new you. Quasi, don't worry. You look dashing. Welcome, welcome to the Cirque de Sarousch! Magic! Magic! Tricks that you cannot ever dream of! Look at the juggler! Come one, come all! Oh, wow! - Wow! - Zephyr, stay close. I don't want to lose you. I don't trust these people. - What does that mean? - Well, just look at them. I mean, they travel from town to town like-like-like-like-- - Gypsies? - Yes! No! I mean-- I mean-- Uh-- Uh, uh, so, Quasi, um... where's this Madellaine of yours? I don't know, but I-I'm sure she'll be out soon. You don't understand. You didn't see him. I don't want to be a part of this anymore. You should have thought of that before you stole from me. - But I was only six years old. - And you were starving... and it was only a few coins. Oh, you cretin, not so tight! - I made a mistake. - Yes. And did I turn you over to the authorities? No. - Or the workhouse? - No. And who took you in? - Looked after you like a true friend? - You did. Oh, yes. All you need to do is to look pretty for him... and he'll tell you what I need to know. Mirrors! I could kiss me... but I'd fall in love. Come, trinket. We're on. Boys and girls! Voila! A treat for your senses. A delight for your soul. Wow! Yeah! Welcome to Cirque de Sarousch! - Hubba hubba! - May I present my assistant-- the lovely Madellaine. And now, I will astound you with a feat of magic... unparalleled in modern times. Behold La Petit! Do not look away from the beast... for I shall make it vanish before your very eyes. Keep a sharp watch. See the creature disappear into thin air. Yeah! Wow! Wow, wow, wow! Sarousch is incredible! I wish I could join the circus. Hey, hey, maybe I could join a circus. Yeah! I could be a juggler. What do you think, Quasi? I'd juggle and I'd-- Quasi? Uh, uh, uh, uh, Quasi? - Hello? - What are you doing? Nothing. You were making goo-goo eyes at your girlfriend. Oh, she-- she's not my-- Who said she was my-- That's a-- Zephyr. And where do you think you're going? Get out there. I mean to have that bell. - I thought you forgot about me. - That will never happen. - I'll always be here for you. - Always? Always. You mean if ever I'm in any kind of great big mess or trouble I'd be right there we'd be a pair You mean you'll never leave me all alone we'll always be a double, we two That's the arithmetic I'd stick with you Just say we're hanging by a rope above an evil witch's brew pot It's bubbling blue with sticky goo Our rope gives way and then we crash and make a splash Inside her stew pot of glue Even if you're sticky slick I'd stick with you - I'm sticking to you. - Hey, no fair. Can't help that. We're stuck together. - Best friends. - And we always will be. Always. Through all the thin and thick Closer than frack and frick we two will do the trick I'd stick with you F ast as the clock can tick I'd be there just as quick No one I'd rather pick I'd stick with you Zephyr. - You have a way with kids. - Hi. M-Madellaine, hi. I-I-I-I-I-I was just-- Hi. He's lucky to have a good friend like you. Oh. - Hey, you were really great up there. - Ah, me? Nothing to it. I just have to stand there and look pretty, you know? - No big deal. - No, no, i-it is a big deal. You-You have to make the audience look where they're supposed to, not give away the trick. Hmm. You mean... hocus their pocus? Delusion their illusion? Abra their cadabra? Actually, I would really like to walk the tightrope. Oh. But I'm not really very good at it. Oh, I don't believe that. I'm sure you can do anything. Paris is r-really pretty. I-I mean, you-- you've probably seen it already, but then, maybe you haven't. A-And if you haven't, then-then maybe we could-- I could, y-you know, show you. I'd really like that. Oh, lovely. I love you, love you, love you, and you. You're a genius. Captain of the Guard, I insist you do something. They took my silver! All my coins to pay my landlord! They'll throw us out! - My bracelet is gone! - Bracelet. Can you describe the bracelet? - My life savings is gone! - All right, all right, have no worry. The king's guard is on the case. We'll find the culprits. Where we'll find them, I don't know. Wait a minute. A string of robberies begins the moment the circus comes to town? Coincidence? I don't think so. How many times have I ever been wrong? Achilles, that was a rhetorical question. You know, the Festival D'Amour is tomorrow. - Would you, uh, like to go? - Oh, I don't know. Oh, but please. We shall have a good time. Well, uh, I'd love to. Try my famous souffl, huh? - Oh. It's ruined. - No, no. Taste. I-l think those are weeds. Oh, no. Smell. Oh, they smell so flowery. They're wonderful. It's rosemary. Come on. This is one of my favourite spots in all of Paris. Isn't it beautiful? But I-- I can't see anything. Close your eyes. Listen to Paris. Oh. Quasi, it's wonderful. Oh, come on, show me more! It's all too sudden Our boy has grown - There's nothing more to do - It's true He's on his own we've tried to teach him we've tried to show The things a gargoyle And a gar-guy ought to know - He's gone - He's left And do we feel bereft No, he's fa-la-la-la fallen in love He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love Sing a rousing rollicking roundelay For our rip-roaring rhapsody He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love why should we be blue His love is true, so bid the kid adieu Oh, wow Just across the square Look at Quasi there Love has nailed him Oh, wow Sighing when he talks Flying when he walks Love's derailed him - He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love - Oh, wow - He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love -Just across the square - Sing a merry madrigal melody - Look at Quasi there - For his marvellous malady - Love's derailed him - He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love - Oh, wow - He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love - Sighing when he talks He's fa-la-la-la la-la-la fallen F a-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la la-la-la fallen F a-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la la-la-la fallen F a-la-la-la Oh, wow Quasimodo's fallen in love Oh, oh, they're coming. They're coming. Come on. Go, go, go, go, go. Spread out. Spread out. You can dry off in here. Put'er there, mon frre! - So, what's the plan? - Plan? Uh-- - A little soft music? - A little candlelight? A cosy t^ete--t^ete by the fire? - Gesundheit! - Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Hey! - Shh! - Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. Yes, you are. I-I mean, yes, she is. La Fidele, that is. That's her name. La Fidele-- "The F aithful One." But she's even more beautiful on the inside. I-l'll show you. Whoa. This must be worth a fortune. You should get warm. Here, put this on. You're very kind. Do you really think there's more to me than what you see? That I have something else to give? I do. I know I'm not much to look at. I've never met anyone like you, Quasimodo. I mean, you understand the world... better than anyone I've ever known. Do you really think so? I do. I made this for you. Now you can always see yourself... through my eyes. Well, I should-- I-I mean, I-I'd better-- I-It's late and, well-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm babbling again. Stupid me. No. No, maybe I'm not. Thank you. I-I-I'll see you tomorrow? Oh. It does my heart good to see our boy like that. Yes. He does seem to have a certain savoir faire. I hope it's not contagious. Come see the lovely Esmeralda... in her dance d'amour. Careful, or you may lose your heart. - Esmeralda! - Me! I want to play! - I want to play too! - Can I dance? Esmeralda. Esmeralda! You've gotta help me. Quasi, wh-what is it? What's wrong? I think I'm sick. I feel awful... and then wonderful! And then wonderfully awful and-and-and awfully wonderful. - Euphoria. - I can't eat. I can't sleep. I see, and-and-and it hurts to breathe, but you don't care? Yes! Yes! Exactly. What do I do? - Well, you have to tell her how you feel. - Uh, how can l? - What would she say? - Sorry. I can't help you with this one. - You'll have to find out yourself. - But I-- Hey, you're ready. That circus is responsible for a string of robberies. - What? - I like the circus, Papa. - I want to join and-and-- - Absolutely not! - Those people-- - "Those people"? How can you lump people together like that? But the gypsies weren't guilty of crimes like these circus people. Madellaine's not. She's different. Well, maybe... and maybe she's just using you to get something else. You don't think she could be interested in me just for me? Oh, of course she cou-- Yes, anyone could, but look at the facts. Find some, and I will. Achilles, do you believe this? Everybody is mad at me. How often does that happen? Rhetorical! What are you doing now, my little cabbage? - Practicing. - Why strain yourself? Oh, did you find out where the monster keeps his bell, trinket? He is not a monster, and I am not your trinket. I mean to have that bell. I want nothing more to do with your thefts. Oh, really? And how will you survive out there, hmm? On your looks? - Quasimodo sees something you don't. - Oh, does he? Well, what if he were to have an unfortunate accident? If I have to go up there with my men... and do it the hard way, the hunchback may get hurt. No! You can't! You-- You wouldn't. If you want him alive, then lure the bell-ringer away... while I steal La Fidele. Lead him out of harm's way. Oh, lovely. - Captain! - I'm here about a rash of robberies. A rash? Oh. I find a little soothing lotion does wonders for the complexion. - I'm talking about thefts in town. - Portraits! Well, we've had nothing go missing... except some of my hair! Are you clever enough to retrieve that? Oh, no, I suppose not. My investigation leads me here. Oh, it's true, Captain. And it's my fault! You're-- You're confessing? Absolutely. She's my responsibility. See, she's been a thief since she was six. I thought I could break her of it if I gave her a job... a place to call home. Oh, Madellaine. - Oh, Madellaine. - Madellaine? - Madellaine. - Where is she? Gone. She and the hunchback... are-are strolling about the town. - Thank you. - No, thank you, Captain. I'll let you get back to your self. Perfect. I make the heist of the century... while the girl leads the monster and the captain away. - Madellaine! I-- I-I-I want to talk with you. - Oh, um-- Let's-- Let's go for a walk. - I got it! - Whoa! - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - Whoa! Oh, oh, oh! Mr. Sarousch! Can I join your circus? - Ah, the price you pay. - Hey, wait! I can join the circus if I want to. Hey, where you guys going? - Have you seen this woman? - No. Do you know where I might find her? - What are you doing there? - Uh, nothing. Hey, who are these clowns? Madellaine says La Fidele is... this one! I smell something rotten in Denmark. Oh, Madellaine. The fool! Look at this ugly thing. Oh. What-- Oh, lovely. I'm rich, rich! I wonder if they make diamond underwear. Oh! They're stealin' La Fidele! Here, hold this. What part of"hold this" was too complex? - There's something I need to tell you. - There's something I need to know. Madellaine, you know, the festival's tomorrow... and-and-and I thought that-- I-l mean, we could... you know, go? Quasi, I'm not the person you think I am. But I want to be, more than anything. Madellaine, tell me the truth. Hey! What happened to La Fidele? They stole it! Dad was right. Come on! We gotta find out where they're taking the bell. All right. I've had enough! Something's wrong. - We have to hurry! - But-- But, Quasimodo, I-- La Fidele! It's gone! The bell has been stolen! We must find her, or the festival will be ruined! Sarousch! How could I have been such a fool? - Sarousch? - Seal off the city-- every street, every river, every alley! They won't get far with a bell that size. Did you know about this? I-I wanted to tell you. I tried. - You used me! - No! - "Which one is La Fidele?" - Please! "Let's-- Let's go for a walk." You never cared about me. - No! That is not true! - You were right. Quasi, I'm sorry. Take her away. No! No! Quasi, please, just-- just let me explain. Look at me! Quasimodo, just look at me! Quasi! Yo, Quasi! - Quasi, is that you? - I say, old chap, bit of assistance? Hey, get us out of here! - We gotta hurry. - Speed is essential. - It wasn't my fault. - One at a time. - It's Zephyr. He's gone after them. What happened to the circus? Halt! Okay. Come on. Won't be long now till we're home free. Wha-- Come here! Come back! Come back here! You won't get away with this! My dad's captain of the guard! Captain of the guard, eh? Really? Captain, the city is secured, but there is no sign of Sarousch. - Then we have to look further! - Phoebus! Zephyr has gone after Sarousch! - I've looked everywhere. - I've got men all over the city. -We'll find him. -You're looking in all the wrong places. Sarousch has made a living from illusion, but I can outthink him. It's the same as the disappearing elephant. Th-There was always a tunnel under the stage. He's taken the bell underground. The catacombs. He could be using the catacombs. And she could be saying exactly what Sarousch wants her to. We go underground, and he slips right out of town. Can't you see? Listen to me. Your son's life is at stake. Maybe you should look again like you did with me. All right! But she's coming along as a prisoner. Djali! Where's Zephyr? Hurry, Djali, take us to him! Which will go better with my eyes-- diamonds or sapphires? Sarousch! Surrender now! - You've got no way out! - Oh, really? I see things a bit differently. Mama! Papa! Let him go! Let him go? I think not, Captain. He's my ticket out of here. You're not going anywhere, Sarousch. Now release the boy! Let me pass safely, and you may see... your precious little boy again. Quasimodo, he means it. He'll hurt Zephyr, but I know how we can save him. - Please untie me. - Why, so you can escape with Sarousch? Don't test me, Captain! Papa! Lovely. Quasi, listen to me. I know I hurt you. I'm sorry, but I am someone you can trust. How can l? I've already made that mistake. Quasimodo, there's more to me. Well done, mon capitaine. Mama! Papa! You hold the rope. I'll do the rest. A hush comes over the crowd as Madellaine begins her graceful trek. I can do this. I can do this. I know you can. What-- What are you doing here? Just standing here looking pretty. Seize him! No, no, no! Not the face! Watch the face! Oh, Mom, Dad. - Let's go. - Fools! I am Sarousch! - This is not the ending I had in mind. - Get in there! No prison can hold me! Wait, we can work this out. Did I mention I do birthday parties? And now while Quasimodo rings La Fidele... come and proclaim your love... for all of Paris to hear! I love Josette! I love Jean Paul! I was wrong about all of it. - I know. - There's only one thing I can say. I love Esmeralda! I love Phoebus! - Huh? Huh. - Huh? Huh. - Wait a minute. - Huh? Hmm. - What is it? Quasimodo, you've shown me... that the world is full of miracles. Just ordinary miracles. They happen every day. Yuck. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yuck. - Yuck. I'm so happy, I could just mildew. Aw, lighten up! Take your heart for granite... Iike me! Aw. She'd better take good care of our boy. Don't worry. I will. - Wha-- - Huh? I love Madellaine! And I love Quasimodo! Angel in disguise Stories in his eyes Love for every true heart That he sees was it just a lucky day That he turned and looked my way Or is it heaven right before My very eyes He's shown me all new things The shimmer of moonbeams I was blind But now he's helped me see I was lost, but now I'm found His happiness surrounds And now I find that my dreams Can come true 'Cause I'm gonna love you For the rest of my life I'm holding you safe here In this heart of mine I can't live without you 'Cause my soul would die You know I'm tellin' the truth I'll spend the rest of my life Loving you It didn't start this way It happened just one day You smiled at me And I saw you differently Now I would tremble just to be A part of you as we Begin a life That's sure to never end 'Cause I'm gonna love you For the rest of my life I'm holding you safe here In this heart of mine I can't live without you 'Cause my soul would die You know I'm tellin' the truth I'll spend the rest of my life Loving you The rest of my life, baby Loving you
