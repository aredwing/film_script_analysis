 

                        - When I was a little girl, my mother used to tell me story about a princess who lived on a beautiful island surrounded by turquoise waters where the sky kissed the sea. When the princess met her prince, their love grew stronger than the waves crashing against the shore. So when I met Jack one day on the beach, he was everything I had been searching for. I thought it was fate. But I had forgotten something very important. Every fairy tale has a monster. In my life story, the monster's name was Gan Cerrancurie. A man whom I later found out was a ruthless crime lord. Little did I know, our path's were destined to collide. - Now, a little Birdy told me you're very bitter about land deals that happened between our families. Where supposedly my family got land that belongs to you. You have to understand, that wasn't me. - I should have squashed you a long time ago, when I had a chance. - Let's bury the hatchet. - No. In Cambodia, there is not enough room for the both of us. - That means one of us has to die. - We will leave it to fate. - You were always a cheat. - In matters of life and death, there is no cheating. Just living and dying. - Who's choice of weapons. - High sword. Winner take all. - Well that puts me at a disadvantage because you're a master of the knives and the swords. Maybe I'll survive. Maybe I will get lucky. Maybe not. You're out of practice, my old friend. I expected more from you. Gentlemen, mysteriously our competitors are gone. You all have done a great job. I just want to say that violence is the last resort because it attracts a lot of attention, but when we have no choice, we're pretty good at it. Good job. Celebrate. - Ok, Sam. Bank's around the corner, man, are you ready? - I know what time it is, Jack. - Just try not to shoot me with that thing, ok pal? Jesus Christ. - Hold on. - Can we go now? - Let's go. - Everybody freeze. If you don't speak English. - Don't even think about it. Down. - Cooperate with us and nobody gets hurt. You, manager. Open, open, open, out, out, out. - One minute. - Come on, man. Go, go, go, go. - Keep down. Move. - Ok, we're good, get out of here. - A minute forty five, go. You - Come on, man. - Holy shit. What do they do with all this US currency? I mean, this is like a crazy amount of money. - How much money do you think that is? - I haven't got a clue, I've been busy. - What would a small bank in Cambodia have this much cash, man? - Stop complaining, we scored, mate. We scored. - I'm not complaining, what if they check the bags on the border? - Trust me, they won't. - Good thing, I brought this. - Great. You expect us to tape this amount of cash to our bodies? - Tough guy like you scared of some tape? - It's not the taping I'm worried about. It's taking it off, my son. Taking it off. - You're a harry bastard, man. It'll do you some good. - Jesus Christ. You're always trying to call that chick. You need to get a life, mate. - She is my life, man. - You're so whipped. Is that why you're doing this? - Maybe. What's it to you? - It just makes me nervous working with such a pussy. - Whatever, man. Let's get you taped up. - No, no, no, after you, mate. Turn around and bend over. - Get off of me, you fucker. This is serious. Just fucking tape me. Thank you. - Thank you kindly. - Hey, baby. - Hey you. - Want to do me a favor and ditch that thing? - I just started work. - You just finished work. Believe me. - My mother died when I was young but she taught me not to take shortcuts in life. When I got older, I didn't go for the quick cash in go-go bars like some other girls I knew. Jack and I were working towards our dream so that some day we can live on a beautiful island together. Can I open my eyes yet? - No, not yet. I'll tell you when it's ok. Ok. Open them. - It's the one that I saw from the store window last week. I love it. Really, I do. But honey, we can't afford this. - That's the surprise part. Come here. Let me show you something. Come on, baby. Come on. Look. - Oh my god. What is that? - That is why you don't have to work at the club anymore, Avalon. And it's all yours. - I don't understand. Where did you get it? - Don't ask me where or how or why. I'll tell you why. It's because I love you. I want you to stick around. - I'm not going anywhere. I love you. Don't you know that? You have to tell me where you got all this money. - Avalon, honey, I'm serious. It's better that you just don't know. - So, how do I explain where I got it? - You can't explain this to anybody, ok? Now, honey, I'm not telling you what to do, but we can't spend this money right now, ok? Maybe we can have a little fun, but I'm going to put most of it away somewhere safe. - You're crazy, you know that? - I'm crazy for you. - You know what we should do? - What? - We should go on holiday. To an island. Like where we met. - Anything you want, baby doll. I'm going to go clean up, ok? I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere. - I think you've been naughty, Jack. - Oh yeah? Is it naughty time? Woah, woah, baby that's not a toy. - You didn't tell me you had a gun, Jack. - It slipped my mind. Don't point that. - Don't worry so much. The safety is on. Come here. Why don't you... Do me on all of this cash. Don't me ask you twice, Jack. - Yes, ma'am. - What kind of flower is that? - This is called a , it's known as the rose of compassion. It's a climbing tea rose, kind of common but I've always loved it. My momma used to grow these in America. - Do you miss America? - This is my home. I came to Asia quite a while back and fell in love with this place. Just something I believe in here. - The bank with your money was robbed. They got away with about 200,000 US dollars. Most of it was yours. - Can I ask you a question? Aren't you the mother fucker that told me that that's the safest place to put my money? - Yes, sir. - You said it would be safe. You know, I took your advice. So if I were you, I would get my money back. - It shouldn't be difficult. It was marked. - I don't want to hear any stories about how easy it's going to be. I want to hear that we got it back. I want results or I'll take these fucking rose clippers and bury them into somebody's mother fucking eye. - Yes, sir. - Yeah, yeah. Seriously, next time you can't come in shooting the place up like that, man. No need, it's too much. - You're thinking about doing it again? - Thinking about it. - I'm up for another run across the border. - Yeah. We were good right? - Fuck yeah. - I guess all those video games finally paid off. - I'm all about the money, baby. - Big time. Especially after taking so much shit for so long. It's nice to have some real cash. - I'm going to buy myself a new set of wheels. - Woah, woah, woah. Don't do anything crazy, Sam. We've got to let that money cool off for a little while. - A man's got to have some fun you know. - I'm just saying, don't be stupid. - Be careful who you're calling stupid. - Just looking out for both of us, man. All right, go have some fun. Just don't go crazy. All right? I've got lunch. I've got to split, see you, pal. - See you later. - Yeah. Sam told me about this place. It's not too bad, right? - Oh my gosh, this place is amazing. - You deserve nothing less, babe. - Thank you. - Thank you. Cheers. - Cheers. - Oh wow. Baby, some of the cash we're going to have to start putting in your bank account. No more than a few thousand dollars at a time. Ok? - Well, honey, what about you? I want you to have some of this money too. - Don't worry about me. I took a little off the top for expenses. Now if you want to take me out to dinner a few times, or go on vacation, I won't stop you. - Jack? We're not in any danger because of this are we? - No, babe. Avalon, you're safe with me, ok? Swear to God, I'll do anything I have to to make sure you're taken care of. I promise. - I know that Jack only wanted the best for me, but there are always consequences for our actions. - Hello, Jack. One of my two. - Who the fuck are you? - My name is Neeron Mortima. I'm your new best friend. - That's ok, pal. I don't like the friends I have. I don't need another one. - Really? That's funny. Because the way I see it, you could use one right about now. - What are you, a cop? - There you go, calling me names. Hold on to that. That was a lot of money you took from the bank in Cambodia. Especially for such a small town. And all of that US currency. - I don't know what you're talking about. - The butter. Is it helping? - Yeah, actually it does help a little. - I am getting really mad now with this bullshit. The money, asshole. I found it in the closet. - How'd you find me? - It's all marked and you were so eager to exchange it that it showed up on my radar real quick. Now... This is how it's going to work. I'm going to give you the names of the banks in Cambodia that you are going to rob. You're going to do exactly as I tell you. - Come again? - The banks will be guaranteed to have just as much if not more than what you took from the first heist. For my service, I get 50 percent of everything. And unfortunately for you today, you and your partner have already split the money. And while you were out, I took my 50 percent. That kind of wipes you out. - I'm not doing this. - Of course. I knew you were going to say that. So here's the other option. You played a dangerous game and the rules have changed. - Wait, wait, ok wait. - No, you know what? I think I'll just talk to your boyfriend and maybe he will recognize the generosity of my terms. What? I'm sorry, you want to say something? - I'll do it. I'll do it. - See Jack? Best friends. I have a little something for you. Keep it close. I'll be calling. But just in case. Your girlfriend, well I am sure that she's going to be somebody that I will be meeting quite intimately if you fuck with me. Take care, buddy. - Jack. - Hey baby. Can you untie me? - Hold on, hold still. What the fuck, Jack. What happened? - Looks like I stole from some bad guys, babe. - Are you ok? - Avalon, they took all your money, doll. They took all the money. But it's ok, I've got it worked out. All right, we got a deal and I'm going to get your money back and I'm going to get you more money. - No, no, no, no, no. Listen to me. Ok? It's only money, Jack. I'm worried about you. Are you ok? - Yeah, I'm ok. - Good. - I'm ok. Let's go to the bathroom. I'm sorry, baby. I'm so fucking sorry. - So you're pissed? - I think it was crazy and stupid. But... I also think it was kind of romantic that you robbed a bank just for me. - I'm glad you feel that way, babe. Because I'm going to do it again. - You sure about that, Jack? - I don't have a real job. If I don't do what this guy says, I'm going to be in deep... - Shhh. Money's not important. Now, let's straighten out the bedroom, so that I can take care of you. - Yeah? - You ready? - Yeah, we're ready. - Listen carefully. There's a bank in the town of Sesopoung. Next Wednesday, exactly 2 o'clock. Not before. Not a minute later. Do you understand? - Yeah, 2 pm. Highway six. - On your way back to the border, there's an old petrol depot. Just off of the highway. You'll see a black BMW. Go there immediately after the job. Jack. I know exactly how much money is in the bank. So don't try and be wise with me. - Don't worry about it. - Yeah? - Yo, I got to talk to greedy Greg. Tell him it's Jack. - Shut up, Ewy. There's a courier without a goddamn box. - Thanks for seeing me like this, greedy. Sorry I haven't been around. - Save that shit, man. What you want? - Well this may seem kind of strange, but over the last few years making runs for you, I've noticed that well, the packages, sometimes, sometimes inside of them there's... - Yo, nigga get to the point. You see I'm doing some shit right? I don't have time for this bullshit. - I wanted to pick something up. - Pick something up like what? - I want to buy some heat. - Heat? - Guns, man. - I know what mother fucking heat is. What I don't know is who sent your 1989 talking ass here for guns. - The packages, greedy. I've got to open them sometimes. Look man, you know I've never taken anything off the top on a job. I'm only here tonight because some of your bags, they got gun parts in them, man. Rifle rounds, large magazines. Machine gun shit. Now I've been doing some new work lately. Some work that requires more than a pistol and I don't know where to get that kind of shit this side of the world. I thought maybe you could help. Look, man, maybe this is a bad idea. I can just leave. - No, no, no you ain't just leaving. You ain't going nowhere. You understand me? What you going to do is you going to lift that shirt. I'm serious, man. I ain't playing with you. - I ain't wearing a wire, greedy. I just got no where else to go. - All right, all right. I'm not one to turn away business, you understand? Let's see what paper you've got. - American. - Now we talking. So what kind of heat you looking for this evening? - AR 15. Beretta M9. AK, sub machine guns, shot guns, anything heavy. - All right. Let's take him upstairs, fellas. Bam. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, this will do. Maybe this. Definitely that. - Ok. Good choice. You know, I like you, Jack. I hope you're not getting in over your head. - Then the guard went for his gun, and I looked at him real mean. He knew if he touched his pistol, I'd take him out just like that. Nobody moved after that. Until we were leaving, and I shot the fucking shit. All right, Jack. What happened to you? - You've got a voice that carries, you know that, pal? - I was telling Tracy or Sharon, or whatever her fucking name is about some TV show, that's all, mate. - Can I talk to my friend? - What'd you do that for? I was about to tap her fucking ass. - Let me talk to you outside. - What's up, Jack? - What the hell is wrong with you? Talking about our business in a fucking bar. Are you stupid? - Don't call me stupid. I let you get away with it once. Don't fucking test me, ok? That was Cambodia. The place can't touch us here. - We don't know that, Sam. Maybe they can. Maybe somebody wants their money back. Did you ever think about that? - What're you trying to say? - I'm just saying, use your head. I'm serious, man. Because we're doing it again. - Ok. - Everybody down. Get down. Everybody down. This is a robbery, nobody fucking move. On the floor now. Dammit, Sam. Fuck. You, get up, manager, go. You open the safe. Open the safe. Go, go, go. - Keep your mouth shut. Keep down, mother fuckers. - Out, out, out. Shit. - Shut up. - All right, we're out. - Good job, Jack. You saved 15 seconds of our time. Good man. - God damn it. - Tell them it was the two. - Stop saying that. A little trigger happy back there, don't you think, Sam? - That's the way it goes down. No room, no time for nothing else. I only shot him in the fucking leg. - That was a cell phone. - What if it wasn't? Who reaches inside their jacket during a robbery? You told me to cover your ass, Jack and as normal, I'm covering your ass, and mine at the same time. - Sam, cover us, don't shoot a mother fucker just because he moves. Do you want to kill somebody? Is that your gig? Because that's not mine. All right, we rob banks. That's it. - All right. - Now follow me. We've got to make a stop. - What're we doing here, Jack? - God damn it, Sam. Not another word till we get back to Bangkok. All right, you're getting paid. Stay put. - Who's that in that car? - Your boyfriend. He know about us? - He knows what he needs to know. - Nice feeling right? Taking what you want. Being in control. - I don't feel much in control right now, Neeron. - No? All that money. And Avalon. How is she? Is she at that silly Thai aerobics class of hers? - I swear to God. You stay the fuck away from her. - It must feel good to have enough money to take care of this young, hot, beautiful and sexy... Be slow, errand boy. Now ease off that. There we go. We're buddies, right? Ok. You guys were lucky last time crossing the border. Now that I have an interest in you not being caught, I'm going to show you an old tunnel that we used to run shipments through. Come on. Follow me. A guard was killed. Was that necessary? - What are you getting soft, Neeron? What's it matter to you? - You're not a killer, Jack. You tell your partner there to watch his trigger finger or he's going to lose it. Understood? - Who you giving up, Neeron? For these jobs. Moving up in the world, huh? And that's all you need to know. - No I need to know when we're going to be square. - Square? Square has nothing to do with it, Jack. You'll know when I'm through with you. Later, buddy. - The way I look at it, it's like this fish. People saying well I shouldn't eat the fish because the fish is you know, an important sentient being and that's true. - Excuse me, sir. I have some news. - Is it important? - Please, sir. - Excuse me. - I found them already. I'll take care of it right now. - Then take care of it. - I will, sir. - But you know I'm just thinking that I'm not really feeling confident. - So what's this surprise you've been telling me about? - What do you think? - This is yours? - Fucking A it is. - God damn it, Sam. You are taking this back, man. - No way. - You don't even have a job. How are you going to explain this? - You're spending all of your money on Avalon. No offense, Avalon. - That is not the same thing, man. - Fucking sure it is. I can spend my money on what I like. Now piss off. - Fuck. - You were kind of rough on him, Jack. - Just stay out of it, Avalon. - Fuck you, Jack. Take me home now. - Baby, I'm sorry. - Now. - Jack and Sam fought sometimes like a married couple. The stress was affecting us all in different ways. Or maybe it was guilt. Clearly we were taking shortcuts to try and make our dreams come true. And everything was getting too real. The fairy tale started to crack apart. - You ready? - Whatever. Everybody down. This is a robbery, you down. - You're making a big mistake. This is the Cerrancurie's money. - You, big guy, get down. Down on the ground. Last chance. - You're both dead men. - He said get down. - All right, manager, you, keys, keys. Let's go, let's go. You and your men still near point bed? Yeah. Yeah, the are making a move right now. Go do what I would do. - Sam, I got to go to the bikes. Cover me. Who the fuck are these guys? - How the hell should I know? - Come on, man. Sam, we have got to get to the bikes, man. Move, move, move. Go. Fixed & Synced! :) aLDEN - Over half a million dollars. Somebody just came into my banks and took that fucking money. They took the money because someone told them it was there. Waiting for them. These two are dead men. We can find them and we can kill them. But what's more important is to find out who the fucking rat is. On the inside. Because I think we know this is an inside job. Don't we? - Looking at the banks, I'd say these guys are coming from Thailand. They cross the border, they do the job, and they go back. - Well... I'll get the money back but at this point, I'm not as concerned about the money as my feelings. I would really hate to kill you, you know. It would break my heart to kill you. - If you think I turned on you, you do what you've got to. I have nothing to be scared of. - Unfortunately... I'm going to have to wait to do what I do. Just a little bit longer. Because I want to be sure I don't kill anybody innocent. A quarter of a million dollars to any one of my brothers who finds me this rat. I want his head put in this fucking tray. By tomorrow. - I don't know what happened. These jobs are suppose to always be easy pickings. - Maybe your secret connection ain't that connected after all. What'd you think of that crazy bastard man? This hairy Carry's brother's money. - These guys are bad news, man. They're drug lords. I heard about them on the news. It's probably their guys who shot the shit out of us. - And that crazy monkey running son of a bitch. This guy you're meeting after every job. Bro, you need to tell me who he is. - I really don't know, Sam. He might be from a rival gang, he might be an inside guy. I just don't know. - Look, this shit's running deep and I need to know who's out to kill my ass. - What do you suggest man? I'm lost here. - Let me have a think about it. - Hey, Sam. That was good shooting. - Cheers. - Yeah, Neeron. What do you got for me? - Another bank score. Biggest one yet. Next week. A bank in Siem Reap. - That's good news. Because it's the last one. - I'll tell you when it's the last score. - Hey fuck face. The commute is not working for me anymore. All right, and if you don't like it maybe I'll tell the Cerrancurie brothers that you're the one that's been feeding me these jobs. Did that get your attention, asshole? - And how are you going to do that, Jack? You're just going to waltz into their compound, introduce yourself? What, I'm the American that's been jacking your banks? You have no fucking idea who these men are. - That may be the case. But you really should listen to this. Yeah, Neeron, what do you got for me? - Another bank score. Biggest one yet. Next week. A bank in Siem Reap. - Think they'll recognize that voice, Neeron? How long you think you're going to be alive after they hear that? - Ok, cowboy. We'll play your way. One last score. You give me my cut, you make some money, then we'll go happily ever after into the sunset. And then we'll be, what did you say? Square. - Square? Yeah, fuck you square. I'm not going to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder, Neeron. And I am not every going to let you hurt Avalon. - Until next time. - Sam, there's something I want to talk to you about, man. After tomorrow's job, Avalon and I are going to skip town. - Where are you going to go? - Don't know yet. - Don't know or don't trust me? - Don't know. What're we doing? - Do me a favor, get me another drink. I'll be back in ten minutes. - That yabba shit is going to kill you one day, man. - You've got your vices, I've got mine. - Oh, yeah, what's mine? - Avalon's snatch. - Get the fuck out of here, man. Hey man. Cigarettes, do you sell cigarettes? Ok, cool. Whiskey? And water. - Sick ride you got, Sammy. - I want to get wasted, you know? - Ok, cool, thanks man. - Get the fuck out of the car, mother fucker. Put your hands down. - Hey, hey you. Sam? Sam? Sam, god damn it, Sam. Oh fuck, man. Hey, buddy. - I don't think I'm going to make the next job. - Don't worry about that, man, ok, we're going to get you some help. We're going to get you the fuck out of here, ok? - You were right. You said this shit would kill me. - Sam? Sam, no, no, no, no don't. No, don't, man. Sam, don't fucking do this, man. Fuck. Sam? Sam? Sam? Fuck. Fuck. God damn it. Sam, mother fucker. Oh fuck. Oh, Sam. Yeah. Yeah, I'll bet you're real torn up. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got it. Fuck that was fast. - What? - That was my connection. The guy heard about Sam. Says I still got to go through with this next job or all bets are off. - Well, what does that mean? - It's not good. - Well, you can't pull it off alone, right? - No. No way. I got to find a new partner. Somebody I can trust. - Well... You're looking at her. - Honey, I wasn't saying that for you. - Who better to watch your back, huh? Sam was your first choice, I get it. He was your best friend. But now that he got himself killed... - No, Avalon, there's no fucking way. - Come on, I'm perfect. I've listened to every detail of your other jobs. I know what to do. - Yeah, I know you're perfect. But there's a bit fucking difference between hearing about a bank robbery and actually robbing a bank. - Yeah, so how did you start? - That's not important. - Why, Jack? Why won't you let me do this with you? - I don't have to tell you why. - Yes, you do. ... No! - Because I don't want you to get hurt. Now that's it, end of story. - Check this. I can handle this gun with my eyes closed, Jack. When I was growing up, my father taught me how to shoot the snot off any predator on earth. - That may be so, but it's different. - And with a body like this, you better believe I know how to protect myself. - What if you've got to shoot somebody? Because on this job we might have to. You ready for that, Avalon? You ready to kill somebody? Without hesitation? Look him right in the eye? Because that's going to happen. - I'll do what it takes to protect you out there. Just like how you've been protecting me since the first day we met. I don't want to kill anyone, Jack. But if it means you'd be safe I'd do it. - This is crazy. You're crazy. - So... - Ok. Let's go through it. Yeah, let's do it, here we go. - Didn't think I'd find a car this fast, did you? - You got all the moves, baby. Now let's go over it again. - Ok, but I know what to do. - Hey, Lucky, how are you? - Mr. Cerrancurie. - Looks like your man doesn't play by the rules. - It's just a little practice before the fight tonight. - You got any big money on the fight? - That's right. You know it takes big money to make big money. - Where you got that kind of money? I can afford that, how you can afford that? - You insinuating I had something to do with that shit? - I'm just asking you a question to see what you had to say. - I can't stand up to you. You want to think that of me? I'm loyal till death. You've got no right to accuse me of anything. - We heard about the bank. You just let those two get away with our money. - Hey, they almost split my fucking head open. I spent the night in the hospital. - He's all right, man. - Look, ever since you guys took over, I play by your rules. Giving you your share of the gambling. I got nothing to hide. - Let him go. - Big money on the fight tonight, huh? Good luck with that. - Babe, what are you doing? - What? It's not like I'm ever going to get a chance to do this again, ok? I've got to look good. - Babe, do you remember, we wear these? A little extra protection. It covers our face. - Fine. Well, just in case, I want to look good for the mug shot. - You're ridiculous. Everybody down. This is a robbery. You, you, you, , open the fucking door. Hey get out, get the fuck out. You over there, there, there. Told you open that fucking door. Avalon, go. - Jack, start the car. - You know, I must be a dumb mother fucker or something because I keep putting my money in these banks. And the only reason why I did that is because one of my most trusted employees told me that was the safe place to put my mother fucking money. You know, I'm having trouble believing this shit. Two got away with 500,000 dollars US currency. Neeron. You think I'm stupid? - No, Mr. Cerrancurie. You're the master mind and I wouldn't have gotten this far without your leadership, sir. - To add insult to injury, they're telling me that one of the is a girl. I don't whether to fucking kill them or hire them. - What do you think, Neeron? - I don't think anything of it. I'm not amused. Not at all. - I want these two dead. And I want them dead today. - Can you take the wheel, baby? - Yeah, ok. - Ok, you got it? - Yep. - Oh my god, Jack. You've been shot. - Ok, I've got it. - We have to go to a hospital. - Are you fucking crazy? - Jack. - Look at us. Do you want to spend the rest of our lives in Cambodian prison? - Ok, ok, fine. The next town we get to, we're going to a pharmacy and we're going to get some supplies to patch you up, ok? - Ok, that we can do. Fuck. Answer it. - Hello? - Avalon. Is this you, my love? - Who is this? - Where's Jack? - I said who the fuck is this? - It's Neeron. You know, his connection. Now let me fucking talk to him. - Who's Neeron? - Give me the phone. Yeah? Avalon. She's quite spicy. - What do you want? - I want my share of the money, you cock sucker. What do you think? Now in an hour meet me... - No can do. Maybe a little while later. Maybe tomorrow. - If you try to run across the border with my money I swear to God, there will be nothing better for me to do than hunt you down and kill you and that loud mouth bitch. - Hey calm down, mother fucker. I got shot. I'm not going anywhere. I've got to patch up. - Don't you die before paying me, Jack. Or you know what will happen to that sweetheart of yours. - You know what, that's enough of the threats, man. We've got some settling up to do. Just stay close to your fucking phone. - Fuck you, Jack. - Honey. I got everything. - Did you get the sling. - Mhhmm. - Good girl. - Hello, sir. No one's seen any sign of them. I'll wait here at the border till it closes at midnight. I'll call you if anything happens. - Ok. You're going to have to go take care of this. Be careful. - He's at the border. Contact all of our hotel connections. Let me know when you've got something. - You ready? - Yeah. - Just like we talked about, all right? - Ok. - Put some of that vodka on the key. Yeah. Now pour some right on that wound. Ok. - You ready? One. Two. Three. - Avalon, come on, do it. You can do it. You can do it. Do it again. Come on. - Ok, one. Two. I can't do it. - Baby, you got to do it. You got to do it, Avalon. Just stick it in there and pull that bullet out. - Ok, ok. - One more time, come on. You can do it. You can do it. - Ok. - Ok. One. Two. - I'm sorry, I can't do it, I can't do it. - That's ok. That's ok. - Baby, you have to see a doctor. - Ok. Yeah, ok. We'll find a vet in Thailand. Somebody we can buy off. - Well it has to be soon, you've lost so much blood. - It's not that much blood, hey, hey. We're going to be ok. I'm going to be ok, all right? You're going to bandage me up and I'm going to be just fine, all right? Ok. - Jack, Jack. - Fucking amateur. - My brother was right. A rat's got no balls. I always knew it was you, you fucking snake. Look at me, Neeron. I want you to see this coming. - I bet you didn't see that coming. - Babe, wake up. Jack. Jack, wake up. Jack. Jack. Are you ok? - I feel like shit. Babe, we've got to go. You drive, ok? I'll load the guns. - Why do you need to load the guns? We're going home, right? - Yeah, we'll go home. I just got to take care of my connection first. Hey. Baby, it's ok. I promise. - Hello? Jack? - There's an old temple off the highway, ten kilometers west of Siem Reap. Be there at one o'clock. Not one minute before. Not one minute after. Do you understand? - I'll be there. - Son of a bitch. - Yeah? - Mr. Cerrancurie. I just saw Neeron. - Don't let him out of your sight. Tell me exactly where he goes. And don't fuck it up. - Yes, sir. - What now? - We wait. - Mr. Cerrancurie. - Where's he headed? - Siem Reap temple. - I'll take it from here. - Be right back. - Be careful. - Hey Jack, you look like shit. I want my money. Give me that duffel bag or I'll shoot that little bitch. - Are you ok? - I'm ok. He'll never hurt you, baby. - He'll never hurt us. Jack, we need to switch cars. - Ok, let's go. - Jack? - What, doll? Oh, shit. - That's them in Neeron's car. Turn around. - Just keep driving, baby. Faster. - We're after that BMW, don't let them get away. - Shit. Avalon, you give this bitch all she's got, ok? Keep your eyes on the road and don't look back. - Got it. - Faster, baby. Just keep driving. Can't you go any faster? - This is it. - Fuck you, assholes. - Oh my god. What now? - I don't know. Slow down. - What? - Baby, slow down a little more. - God damn it. - Did we lose them? - For now. We should put some distance between us though. I think the border's a few miles up. We'll figure it out there. Ok, baby. We're going to ditch the car. We can grab a boat up the river here. - Who were those guys, Jack? - It's a long story, babe. - I thought you were only hitting banks. - Me too. Turns out these gangsters launder their money through the banks. Hey, it's ok. It looks like we're home free now, huh? - Jack, they're here. - Fuck. Oh, fuck. - Ok, so what's the plan? - Ok, the plan is you're going to get out of here and I'm going to hold them off as long as I can. - No. - Baby. - No. - Look, Avalon, I've had a life, ok? And I spent the best parts of it with you. Baby, back at the safe there's almost a million dollars, ok? - Jack, it was never about the money. Can we just give it back to them? - It's past that, babe. Ok? You got to get on a boat... .. and you're going to take that money and you're going to get out of here... You're going to disappear and get a house on an island like we talked about. - No, Jack, please don't do this. - Ok, you're going to buy a house. - Please don't do this. Please don't do this to me. Please, Jack. - Baby, I love you. In this life and the next, ok? Ok? - I love you too. I know. - You've got to go. Baby, you got to go right now. You got to go right now, go, go, go, go. - Fuck. Baby, go. - Jack. No. - Are you who killed Neeron? - Didn't I do you a favor? - Yeah, I'm so grateful for that. - Please don't hurt her. - You don't come into people's yards, steal their money and shoot at them. There's people like me who might get lucky and kill you first. - Just don't hurt her, man. - Jack. No. Jack, please don't leave me. Please. Please, don't leave me. - Hey, baby. - Jack. Jack? Jack? Jack? - You. Leave the money, take your life and go. Now. - I love you. I don't know why Gan Cerrancurie spared my life that day. I guess even monsters have a soft spot. Maybe I reminded him of someone in his life. Compassion still lived in him somewhere. I'm grateful I lived a fairy tale with Jack. If only for a short time. But the price was too high, and I would give all the money in the world to see Jack again. Now, Jack lives on. But only in my heart.
