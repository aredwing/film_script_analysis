 

                        It's so nice and warm! It sure is. Hey, Toku... Toku? It's nice coming back... each year... to a hot spring in the mountains. Especially when the leaves are out. Isn't this a great view? It's almost as if we could see! We've been making very good time. How many sighted people have we passed today? It's a great feeling... ...when you pass a sighted person walking ahead of you... ...and they go 'huh?! It's a feeling the sighted will never understand. Yes, but I keep running into dogs and horses' bottoms. That's because you're off in your own little world. No, they're in their own little world when they don't notice us! These days the sighted are all like that. Don't pick fights with the sighted these days. If you're not careful they'll grab your arm... ...and throw you down in the mud! Oh yeah? You can't depend on other people or your cane any more. You've got to develop the ability to sense things. Your instincts! Oh. Fuku! Use your instincts and guess how many kids there are coming. There's eight of them. No. Eight and a half. A half? There's a baby. A baby? I never noticed the baby! That's right. It looks like eight and half. Wait! What?! Oh! Toku, let's slow down a bit. I'm beat! But I'd like to get there while the sun's still up. What do we care if the sun's up or not? For us it's night all year round. That's true... ...but I want to catch up to those students who hiked past us... ...and pass them. Impossible! No, it's not. They've got two legs, and so do we. We'll never do it. Why not? Why not? Because it's impossible. Why? Why? It doesn't stand to reason that we could. Logic flees before the illogical. Say what you like, it'll never happen. I will be unreasonable and prevail! My behind! What's wrong? Hurts! What?! There was a pretty woman in there. There was? A Tokyo woman. A Tokyo woman? She carried the scent of Tokyo. Those masseurs are famous around here. They pass everyone they can on the road... ...then boast about how many sighted people they went by. Every year, like the swallows, they come north from the seaside spas... ...then head back when the weather turns cold. MY DARLING OF THE MOUNTAINS Fuku... Which inn are you at tonight? Me? The Kannonya. What about you? The Kujiraya. Fuku... Yours is that way. Oh yeah, you're right. Kujiraya Inn Good evening. Toku! How have you been? Yes. I'm back. I'm placing myself in your care again. Fine. Is all well at the Kujiraya? Yes, thank you. How was business at the seaside hot springs? Not very good. Terrible, in fact. It was? Yes. Times are tough all over. I brought you this. It's just a token... You shouldn't have. Every year you bring gifts... Always the same thing. Then I'll avail myself of your generosity. Oh, Toku! Is that Kiku? I'm in your care again. Room 3. Then the students in Room 5. Room 3, then Room 5? I'll get to work. You know the way? Yes. Oh, Toku! Is that Aki? I'm in your care again. I was just saving it was time you came back. Kiku was waiting. Don't tease. I might believe you. Give me my gift later. Hello. Thank you for your patronage. Come in. Lightly, please. My shoulders. I'm told you delight in passing sighted people on the road. Well, I wouldn't go that far... How many today? Today? Today it was about 20. But it's a shame those students managed to overtake us. Some people do? Yes. Today was a real shame. Sorry to hear that. Might you be from Tokyo, Mam? Do I seem married? Excuse me. You're a 'miss'? 'Miss'? It's a long trip for a woman to make alone. Is it for your health? Not really... For a short stay? Hmm... A long one? Hmm... Are you returning from somewhere? Or heading on somewhere? Well... Don't leave that there! I'm sorry! You're very stiff, aren't you. Yes. That means you've been using your head too much. Is there something that's been bothering you? You can tell? Yes. And what is it that's bothering me? That I can't say. But it's unusual for a young person to be so stiff. And for a young woman to summon a masseur? Not anymore. These days I'm often called upon by young lady hikers. Women students and so on. Yes... women students these days are very bold. They most certainly are. That's right! It's your fault! Yes! My fault? Yes! I'm exhausted! And it's all your fault! Yes! My fault? We had to walk so fast because you kept pushing us! It was like a training march trying to beat you! Wasn't it! Yes! Is that so? As if you didn't know! Even then you passed us! My legs are all swollen! You owe us one. A discount?! Darn right! Don't look so surprised! Sorry to keep you waiting. Oh... I'll go first. Just my legs. I'm next. And then me. Then you can take your time with me. You were hot on our tail today, weren't you. I was amazed. Oh, you're the gentlemen who passed us... I see... That was a shame. What was? Oh, it's just... ...you have very strong legs. It was a shame. Our legs aren't all that strong. You were just so... into it, it started to feel a bit strange. We were running from you. Is that so? What a shame! Those girls made a lot of noise. Yes, they did. Modern young ladies are quite shocking. So... ...where are you from? From? I'm from... ...well... Between the seaside springs... ...and the mountain ones... ...I've forgotten where I come from. You have? I've come back here to visit my ancestors' graves... ...but there's a new temple priest, and I don't know anyone in the village. It's like my home town is gone. You don't say... Yeah. So now relaxing at a place like this is where I feel most at home. Indeed. I fell asleep... I'm sorry! No, no... Ow! Ow ow ow! Hey, Masseur! Just a light massage, OK? No, you all seem very tired. You'll get the full treatment. Guvs... Hey! That masseur last night must've had a grudge against us. It hurts to walk! We'll never get over the pass like this. Shall we go back? We can't go back to that inn now! Forget about appearances. I'm in pain! Let's go back and stay another night. What do you think? Right. Let's go back. Here come those girls. Oh, the ones we passed yesterday. Are you sure? So they're going over the pass, too? Looks that way. What do we do now? This is no time to worry about how it looks! Yeah! I can't put up a front now! Yeah! That's right! Is that those students? Looks like them. Is it? It is! Really? Yes! Isn't it! Did they forget something? Forget something? We don't care... ...how it looks! Is that so? Sorry to hear that! It's going to rain later. Be careful! Into every man's life... ...a little rain must fall! Is that true? They aren't up here yet, are they, Toku. Not up here vet, but they're in Tokyo. Is that true? Yes. We don't want them here! Yeah! Are you sure? Stop yapping and get to the bath! Your soup's boiling away! So that's how it is? Masseuses are taking over at the seaside spas? That's a problem. It's not just in massage. In Tokyo there's a lot of these 'working women'... ...and the men are out of work. I guess it won't be long before a lot of masseurs... ...are out of work, too. That worries me. Toku! The lady from last night wants you. She called for me? By name. Thank you. Make it quick. Right. Ah, Kiku... What? Wait... This is camellia oil... ...from down at Izu. For me? Keep it a secret from everyone else. Thank you! Hurry up, all right? 'A secret from everyone'... 'A secret from everyone'... 'Secret, secret, secret... 'Secret, secret, secret..., Here we are again! Here we are again! Twice as tired as we were when we left! Let's go to the bath. Let's go. Welcome! You must be very tired! Bath! The bath? This way. Aki! Bring some robes! Bring them to the bath. They're coming now. You must be worn out. You've had a hard walk. Get me a hand towel, will you? Oh, I'm sorry. Aki, bring these gentlemen some hand towels! Quickly! Does anyone else need one? You're all right? Then I'll leave you to relax. He's on his way. Oh. 'Scuse me! 'It's a secret'... 'Secret, secret, secret... 'Secret, secret, secret..., Does anyone have toothpaste? I've got some Club. That's fine. Is that you, Toku? Why are you wandering around here? I'm looking for that Tokyo woman. I'm sure she was here, but then it's like she ran away. She's a strange one. It's strange she'd run away after calling for you. She's strange. A very strange woman. Little boy... All alone? Where's your dad? Don't have one. Your brother, then. Don't have one. Then who was the man in the cart with you? My uncle. Your uncle? What a nice uncle to have. He's not nice. What's he doing? Sleeping. Still sleeping? That's not very productive. The best medicine, he says. Oh? What's wrong, Fuku? That woman was very strange. Calling a masseur first thing in the morning, then leaving... That's just strange! Hey, lady! Want a fish? Oh, thank you. Very strange indeed! We're the ones who are hit the worst! We're the ones who are hit the worst! Right! We didn't do anything! That's right! It's very strange. No one else came in. That lady from Tokyo was the only one there. She was? Where did she get to? This wouldn't have happened if you'd all been more careful. Pay attention! Go! Yes, sir! Toku... are you still waiting? Yes. I wonder where she went... I'm sure it was her over there a while ago... Would you care for a rub while I wait? Hmm... Don't mind if I do. Thank you. Don't mention it. The morning's been quite eventful. Has something happened? 'Something' certainly did. While those students who came back were gone to the bath... ...their money was stolen. Only theirs. The easiest thing would be to call the police... ...but if word gets out... ...people lose confidence in us. I understand. I'll have to give them their rooms for free... ...and pay their train fare back to Tokyo. That's too bad. You've no idea who did it? How could I have any idea? I'm sure the only one upstairs at that time... ...was that lady from Tokyo. Is that so? It couldn't be her... Oh, she's back. Come in. Toku, she's back. Welcome. He'll have lunch with me. Yes, ma'am. Hello. The lady's back! I'm truly sorry. The maids have searched everywhere. I'm very sorry. Oh, hello. I'm back. Hello. Fry these up for me, please? Caught some big ones, didn't you. Not as big as your fibs! Excuse me... Look out! Are you not the students who were hiking yesterday? Thank you for your patronage. 'Thank you'? Look what you did! My legs hurt too much to walk! We meant to go over the pass, but we had to come back! I'm sorry to hear that. Perhaps another massage later? You've got to be kidding! One more massage and we'll never make it home! That's not all. We got robbed while we were in the bath. We're broke! That's a true calamity, isn't it. Well, if you'll excuse me... She has massages in the morning? Looks that way. I wanted to see you overtake someone, but you noticed me. Your senses are very sharp. So that was you... Yes, it was me. You noticed so fast that I ran away. You moved so swiftly you made me sweat. I'm sorry. I'll take a quick bath. How about you? A bath? Yes. Together?! Of course not! Oh. Let us go, too! Again? Now! Hurry! Come on! Boy! Don't cry! Don't cry! Don't cry! How often does the carriage go? Every two hours. The next is at 11. So we'd make the train at... Will you be leaving today? Yes. What's wrong? That masseur's mean. You were teasing him. He scared me for no reason. He wouldn't have scared you just like that. We're going. Get ready. I'm staying. And why? The lady invited me for lunch. The lady? The one in the carriage yesterday. We're having fish I caught. I don't care what you're having. Get ready. No! That would be rude. It doesn't matter. Take a bath and get ready. You said you wanted to stay. Yeah, but now we're going. Hurry or I'll leave you. Tsk! What? Nothing. I'm staying! It'll just be me for lunch today. Oh? Tell me my fortune. Lady... Then I'll sleep, too. Hey... Sing something. Yeah. Shall we all sing? Hey, kid! What's your sister doing? She's not my sister. She can't be his mother. She's not my mother. No? Then who is she? Just some lady. Yeah? She's pretty, isn't she. She sure is! Say hello for me. No! No? What's wrong, little boy? Why are you crying? You shouldn't cry. Go on back to your room. Then my uncle will make me go back to Tokyo. I don't want to! You're going home? Your uncle will be worried. I don't want to go! Come on. I'll walk back to your room with you. Enjoy your tea. I'll apologize for you. Don't worry. He's really tough. He is? He's got a black belt. He's that tough? Yep. Well! Where did you get to? I'm sorry I kept him so long just when you were leaving. Not at all. He said you'd invited him to lunch... ...but I didn't know which inn you were at. I apologize. Not at all. Did he cause you any trouble? No. I understand you're leaving... Well, I'd meant to... ...but that means the night train now, so I think we'll stay. That train's no place for a child. I kept you from leaving... No. That means another night to relax. Boy, since the lady had you to lunch... ...let's have her to dinner tonight. Yeah! I'll go catch some fish! Fuku, knock it off, will you? You've been trying that tune for years. Trying? It takes three years just to get a sound out of it. Good evening. I'm from the Kannonya. Could you come right away? Yes, ma'am. Toku, it's your turn. The Kannonya... You take my turn. What? I'd be happy to... ...but you're giving away all your turns tonight. Why is that? Well, you know... I'll bet you're waiting for a certain someone... Shut up and get going. Toku... ...there's no point waiting for that Tokyo lady. She's gone to visit a guest in the Kannonya. Is that so? Would I lie to you? Oh... I'm on my way. Fuku! I'll go. Ow! Hey! Watch where you're going! You bumped into me! Watch it! I can't see! You watch it! What?! Oh yeah?! Hey... There's one here! One what? Toku, do you know about what happened last night? I sure do. Those guys were tough! What are you talking about? The fight, of course. Fight? I meant the theft at the Kannonya. Theft?! Yeah. What a scene! Another guest... ...was robbed while he was off at the bath. Is that right? Yes! They even questioned us. What a nuisance! I wouldn't have taken your turn if I'd known. At the Kannonya... I got in a fight, so I wasn't there. Hey, Sawa... You're sure that lady from Tokyo was over visiting... ...at the Kannonya last night? Yeah, she was there. Is that still bothering you? I see... That's strange. What is? Very strange. Really? Yes. It's been hard for him. His mother died when he was born, and last year his father died, too. So in the end I had to take him in. I see... The poor boy! And you, too. I can't even take care of myself, let alone a child! What about your wife? That would make things easier. So you're still single? I have neither the wife nor the means for one. That can't be true. I see... Is that so... I'm going. This is no fun! You're leaving today... I was thinking I would. And you? Well... ...I don't know when I'll go back. Oh? I envy you, taking life easy here. I'm not taking life easy. I'm quite worried. About what? Oh, nothing. Hello. Welcome... ...back. Kiku, could you arrange some souvenirs? What would you like? What's this area known for? Hmm... Oh! What are you doing here? You spent all the time talking to my uncle! I'm sorry. It's no fun. You're going home to Tokyo. Your uncle will be worried again. So you get back to your room and get ready. I'll bring you a souvenir... ...so off you go, all right? Are we going? I don't know... Let's go. Should we? Yeah, let's go. It's no fun here. No fun, huh? One more night? Boy? Yeah. Where's the Tokyo lady? I'm not playing with her. Why not? All she does is talk to my uncle. It's no fun. I see... Then play with me. Let's take a walk. A walk? Can a masseur take walks? I go for walks, and I even go hiking. Wow! That's amazing. That's right! So you're going home tomorrow? Yes, we are. Tomorrow I really must get back. We'll see each other in Ginza and you'll pretend not to know me. I'd never do that. But I might not be going back to Tokyo. Where will you go? Where? That I don't know. I don't understand... It doesn't matter. Let's change the subject. Are we leaving? I don't know... what should we do? Let's go home. Shall we stay one more night? Watch out! You don't own the whole road! Is that you, boy? What is it? We're staying another day. Oh? Shall we go swimming? Can you swim? Sure! I can even dive! That's great! That's right. All right, boy, watch this. I'm going swimming. She's here. She is?! Boy! My kimono! My kimono! Are you alone? Yes. What are you doing? Swimming with the masseur. Oh, dear! That's dangerous if you can't see. He says he can even dive. You're inside-out. Oh, no! Thank you. You shouldn't be swimming. This river's dangerous. I'm sorry. You're hopeless! You didn't seem to notice me on the bridge last night. You of all people. No, I realized. I know. Why didn't you say something? I don't like getting bitten. I bump into dogs all the time, and I keep getting bitten. Oh, dear! Don't get the wrong idea. That man's nothing to me. It's just nice to meet someone from Tokyo way out here. That's all. You meet people traveling, then you never see them again. Uncle, let's go home. Why? I'm bored. I was swimming with the masseur, then that lady came... He shouldn't be swimming. Then who should I play with? I'm bored. Come on, Uncle. Let's go home! Let's go! Come on! Uncle! Shall we? Yes! OK, call the maid. Maid! We're checking out! Uncle... Shouldn't we say goodbye to that lady? Hmm... You go, boy. Lady! We're going home! I'll write when I get home to Tokyo! Write back, OK? Goodbye! Kujiraya Hey! Watch out! Watch out! Oh, it's you, Fuku. Oh, it's you, Toku. You don't often bump into people. Yeah... I was thinking about something. Well, I was in a bit of a hurry. What for? That's a bad habit. You're always hurrying. Tonight's different. You know all the trouble there's been... Yeah. The Kamiya got robbed, too. They can't keep the police out of it any more. They're checking everyone with a fine-tooth comb. They think it's a guest somewhere who's been doing it. Is that true?! True or not... ...there's so many police here a flea couldn't get by them. Yeah? What's that about hurrying? That's a bad habit. Ow! Sorry! Is the Tokyo lady here?! Yes... What's the hurry? What's the matter? Quick! Get away! They're looking for you! For me?! Yes! Everywhere! Oh, no! There's no time to waste! Quick! Quick! Out the back way! This way! You'll be all right here. Wait here a while. I'll bring your things. Masseur... Stay here! I know everything. Ma'am... ...you may fool the sighted... ...but a masseur... ...is not deceived. My unseeing eves have been watching you. It's been hard for me. So quickly, get away from here. To somewhere I can't see you. When those students lost their money at the Kujiraya... ...and then the Kannonya was robbed... ...I suffered, wishing to trust you! Believe in her. The more I try... ...the more you are burned into my unseeing eyes. So... ...go away... ...somewhere far... ...where my eyes can't reach! Masseur... ...you're wrong, you know. No. My eves don't deceive me. If they do... ...why are you always brooding and fretting... Why does every footstep, every sound... ...frighten you so? I've had my eves on you all the time. This is too funny for words. But since you're so concerned about me... ...I'll tell you everything. Yes, I've run away from Tokyo. Of all the hot springs there are, I chose this one. But it wasn't for anything as silly as you think. Then why? What for? I was sick of being a man's kept woman. More than that... ...I felt guilty towards his wife and daughter. But he'll come looking for me. He'll do whatever it takes to find me. That's what he's like. That's why I'm frightened by the carriage horn, or footsteps. Your instincts, your unseeing eves... ...see even what isn't there. I'm sorry! I bear you no ill-will for trying to help me get far, far away. Masseur... ...it's the eves of that beast that I'll run from, not yours. I'll run, and run... ...and keep on running. Take care! Kiku, if the boy writes, tell him to become a fine man! I will!
