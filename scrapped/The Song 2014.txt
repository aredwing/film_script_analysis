I cannot hear I have no sight Dark is near And your blinding light Can you hear me When I cry? Catch me when I fall But I can't hold on Take it away, boys. The words of the Teacher, son of David. Killer job, man. Killer job. Great show, baby. This teaching is a light. Yeah, man, now you're talking. Good show. Correction and instruction are the way to life, keeping you away from your neighbor's wife. Go. Do not go near her door. Where you going, boy? Keep to a path far from her. Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or be captivated by her eyes. Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned? Can a man stand on hot coals without his feet being scorched? Another man's wife preys on your very life. Hey, baby, you okay in there? No one who touches her will go unpunished. I looked and saw all the evil that was taking place under the sun. I declared that the dead are happier than the living. But better than both is the one who has never been born, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun. Hello. Jealousy arouses a husband's fury. He will not accept any compensation, however great it is. - No! No! No! - Daddy. Don't leave! A man who commits adultery has no sense. His shame will never be wiped away. But And do you, David, take Bethany... the one who confesses and renounces sin finds mercy. ...to love and to cherish for better or for worse from this day forward? I do. As you do not know the path of the wind or how the body is formed in a mother's womb, you cannot understand the work of God, Watch his head. The maker of all things. Hi, Jed. Who knows what is good for a person during the few meaningless days that they pass through like a shadow? Give me a hammer, Jed. Who can tell them what will happen under the sun after they are gone? Hold on a second. Right there. Move that finger up there. I've been doing that every time. No one knows when their hour will come. - You all right? - Yeah. Generations come... generations go... but the earth remains forever. What has been will be again and what has been done will be done again. There is nothing new under the sun. I have seen all things done under the sun. All of them are meaningless, a chasing after wind. I was born the son of a king Princes die Over petty things Yeah, our families They're about war You'd think that we could Settle the score But the consequences stay Yeah, the consequences stay Yeah, I was born The son of a king You don't know what that means Do you? No Yeah, you might say It's living a dream Somehow dreams have a way Of coming true Like you don't want them to And to the God in heaven Give me the wisdom To see this through Love is a choice We're making But even if it's not What we choose I'm still the son of a king You can say it was love I don't know What I think of that Stan, we will sell more albums if you get me playing bigger venues. This place sells out at like 18 people. People come to see you for one reason. They loved your dad, okay? Now, until you find heart or inspiration or something to sing about, you're just gonna be David King's kid. A little parting gift from old Stanager, okay? There's a vineyard over in Sharon, all right? They do a festival every fall. They need a musician. Pays pretty well. It's only 30 minutes away from here. You don't have to pay me. - Are you serious? - Yeah, I'm serious. I'm a bridge. I'm on fire. You are brilliant. - Appreciate that. - Just go, Stan. I'm happy to leave. In his heart, a man plans his course, but the Lord directs his steps. It comes right out Of the mountains Down to the valley below Sweeps out across The bluegrass It gets down in your soul It might come as a whisper That cuts right through The north Jed? Are you Jed King? - Yes. - I'm Rose Jordan. Um, we spoke on the phone. Right, right. Yeah. - It's nice to meet you. - This is your place then? My dad's. It's beautiful. Well, he'll wanna know you're here, so... - Come on. There we go. - Old piece of junk. - Daddy? - Yeah. - Jed King is here. - Who? The singer. I'm sorry to interrupt. I'm Jed. Sheppard Jordan. - It's great to meet you. - This is a beautiful place. - You David King's kid? - Yes, sir. Uh-huh. Hon, show him to the stage. I got work to do. Nice to meet you. - Okay. - All right. - Good to meet you. - Uh-huh. Dad's really sweet. He's just a little stressed. No, it's fine. Who did he say your father was? David King. So he's a singer too? You don't know who he is? Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know anything about music. Please, don't apologize. It's a good thing, believe me. Hey, Rosie. Eddie. - What are you doing here? - Tasting wine. It's free wine tasting, right? It's what the paper said. - Right. - This is Kristen. Yeah, I remember. How are you? The wine is really good. Thank you. I'm glad you like it. Who'd have thunk? I mean, Kentucky? Heh. Right? Heh. So are you two...? - No, we... This is, uh... - Yes. Don't be shy. Don't be shy. - Jed King. - Jed King, as in David King? See? Yes. You're hotter than your dad. - Thank you. - Well, there you go. Better than your dad at something. How's your dad? I don't know. Why don't you go ask him? He looks busy. No, no, I'm sure he'd love to talk to you. No, maybe later. Excuse me. It was nice meeting you again. - Sorry. It's this way. - He's a winner. Here you are. Just make yourself at home. Thanks. And sorry about Eddie. He's a jerk. You deserve better. Better than a guy who'll dump me for not sleeping with him. I just don't know if "better" exists anymore. Wow. - I just said that, didn't I? - No, it's okay. When I get done playing, and you get done with whatever you have to do, you wanna hang out? Look, you seem like a really nice guy. - A nice... Ow. That hurts. - Heh. Look, it's only that I just met you. Right. I don't even like him, but it still kind of kills to see him with her. Well, I'd hate to see you die. Sorry. - Uh, good luck, Jed. - Thank you. "I'd hate to see you die"? Thank you, everyone. You're in for a real treat tonight. Give a warm round of applause for Louisville's Jed King. Nice banjo, Jed. Kentucky. Ha, ha. Right? Let me cut right To the chase Rose When I see your beautiful face I can't help but ask myself Why? And if I didn't need This gig I swear I'd flip my lid And already Eddie Would be nursing a black eye - Ha-ha-ha. - Oh, yeah? - Ha-ha-ha. - It seems like such a waste To let him in the way Of what you and I might have - One day - Ha-ha-ha. I don't want to quit you Baby I ain't gonna split you Baby Whoo! I'd rather give you up Than watch you die I don't want to Yeah, I know loss hurts More than a little But he splits you down The middle It's time to give good love A try Hey! Yeah, it would be such a pity Just to split you fifty-fifty Especially some guy Who makes fun of my banjo Shows up at a thing With another girl When he knows You're gonna be here Is scared of your dad And breaks up With the most beautiful girl For the dumbest reason In the world kind of guy Hey, Rose You and I will bloom In no time - Thank you for coming. - Thanks. That was an awesome show. Thanks, appreciate it. God bless. Hi. Wow. That's really nice actually. Here, I have something for you too. Oh. Yeah, this is great. Thanks. Really? I think so. But like I said, I don't know anything about music. Everybody knows something about music. Very little, in my case. What's your favorite Beatles song? Everybody has a favorite. "Strawberry Fields Forever," "Hey Jude." Well, I've always really liked "Turn! Turn! Turn!" To everything Turn, turn, turn - What? I love that song. - I love that song too. It's just not the Beatles. - Yeah, it is. - No, it's the Byrds. - You're thinking of the Byrds. - No. - Agree to disagree. - No, you'd still be wrong. The lyrics are in the Bible. Can we agree that God wrote them? Absolutely. Too bad my song isn't on here. Heh. Never had my own song before. You're probably gonna ask me out again then, huh? You know what? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you out like that. No, that's all right. Not without talking to your dad first. - What? - He seems like the kind of guy that would appreciate being asked. For my hand in marriage maybe, but one date? We're gonna have more than one date. How do you know? I know. He's busy with clean-up. Monday? - Monday. - Good. You're gonna need a day to prepare. Mr. King, I don't know you. That's true, sir. And you can call me Jed, if you like. So, what makes you think I should let you date my daughter? At the very least, Mr. Jordan, you know that I'm the kind of guy that's willing to ask a very intimidating man if I could date his daughter. No, that says more about me than it does you. I just want you to know that I respect you and that I respect Rose. You sing about God in your songs, don't you? I sing about things that I'm passionate about. - Like Rose? - You heard that, I guess. I love Rose a lot. And I have always tried to protect her from certain kinds of men out there. Just to be honest, men like your daddy. He sang about God too, didn't he? I know he made mistakes, Mr. Jordan, but he learned from them. So did I. I won't repeat them. So I'm not gonna lie, your dad freaked me out just a little bit. Well, you're gonna have to tell me all about it, because I wasn't listening. - Oh, no? - Nope. Okay. Uh... Well, since you weren't listening, I'll give you the highlights. He loves you a lot, and he has quite the collection going on in that room. Ha, ha. Yeah. - It wasn't great. - Heh, heh. So, yeah, I was basically raised by my father and two brothers. But they weren't cut out for wine making, so they bailed. You think you'll ever bail? No. No, I love it. Yours skipped like 10 times. - Well... - How do you do that? My dad, he was legendary at slinging these things. Lethal, some would say. I don't know. I mean, I guess I can find a career to help me pay for all the stuff I'll eventually throw away, or leave to someone else, but family's forever. Right? Agree to disagree. And side-arm it, right? And flick your wrist at the end. Whoo! Ha-ha-ha! There you go. I did it. You did it. You have stolen my heart. You have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes. Oh, my goodness. I don't think ice cream was such a good idea. I'm freezing. You done? - Here, I got it. - Brr! - Okay. - Wait right there. You made me love you And I did not wanna do it - Come here. - What? - Let's dance. - Oh. Ha-ha-ha. Come on. Come on, it'll warm you up. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. You are such a schemer. Heh. Give me, give me What I cry for You got the kind of kisses I would die for Show me your face. Let me hear your voice. For your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely. Ice cream was a good idea. You made me love you How delightful is your love? How much more pleasing is your love than wine? Remember when we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for. This one's my favorite. I've always loved it. I love you truly Truly, dear You know, I don't normally do this, but here's one you might know. I cannot hear I have no sight Dark is near Blinding light Can you hear me When I crawl? Catch me when I fall 'Cause I can't hold on You were really great tonight. I'm glad you think so. - Everyone thought so. - Well... That last song, well, people really liked that one. - Oh, yeah. - What? That was my dad's song. Oh... Oh, I'm sorry. Don't be, it's fine. It's a good song. You know, sometimes... I think about letting it go. Music. I look at you... tonight... under the stars. I mean, look. I see God here. If you could ask God for anything, and you know he'd say yes... I'd want to be wise. That way I can live right... and really live. And if I did sing, it'd only be because I had something to say. You should just ask for that. I won't listen. Go ahead. God, I wanna be wise. Please. You feel any different? You think your dad would let me build a chapel here at the vineyard? Like the one in your book with the sticky note thing. Why would you want to? So I could marry you. I'll ask your dad. Build the chapel. Marry me. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah! Let me do this. Let me build you a chapel. How long will it take? - A year. - Oh. Uh-uh. I can't wait that long. I love you truly Truly, dear Life with its sorrows Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the young women. Fades into dreams When I feel you near I am my beloved's. Oh, I love you truly And my beloved is mine. Truly, dear How beautiful you are, my love. How beautiful. Your eyes are doves. You are altogether beautiful, my darling. There is no flaw in you. You're so beautiful. I want you to know that. Oh, I love you truly Truly, dear I've been waiting on you To come along Seeing notes on a page But not the song Had a hole in my... - Hey. - Hey. You're up early. I had a dream. - A dream? - Yeah. About what? Your new song. - My new song? - Mm-hm. - Mm. - It's good. - You wanna hear it? - Mm... - I feel you should hear it. - Maybe later. Did you have something else in mind? Mm-hm. Yeah. Something. Me too. You know what? "Something" is gonna be incredible after you hear this song. Trust me, it'll take two seconds. All right. Sit down. I've been waiting on you To come along Seeing notes on a page But not the song Had a hole in my heart A pain so strong Only a woman like you Could take me on There's a plan for us A hand divine The waiting was worth it Now you're my wife We've been taking our time Doing this right Tonight I'm not gonna Just kiss you good night Play the rest. You, the song my heart sings Awake, love I want you to know We're making love Deeper than our bodies You are written on my soul Your eyes like the dawn You are beauty The touch of your skin Consumes me You shine like the sun Pure and lovely One, two, three! Set me as a seal Upon your heart Our love stronger than death Come on. Flashes of fire With purest desire The waters will never quench Awaken love, awaken love No riches or power appeal All will find You are truly alive In love as it was Meant to be This is love as it was Meant to be Come on, sing it out! One, two, three, four! Oh Oh Come on. Oh Love is the power that heals Oh Oh You know it. Oh Love is the power that heals - Hey, Daddy. - Hey. Hey. - Hey. - How did it go? It was great. - Welcome home, Jed. - Sir. - Good to see you. - Thank you. Yes, sir. - How'd he do? - Oh, he's fine. He's fine. He's up there asleep. We had a blast. Oh, good. I'm gonna go. Hey, Jed, don't wake him up. I won't. - Thank you again. - Yeah. Yes, sir. Anytime. All right, I better be going. All right. Good night, Ray. I wish my dad could be here to see all this. He'd be proud of you. I'm proud of you. Thank you. So now what? Jed. Enjoy it. All this I tested by wisdom, and I said, "I am determined to be wise." Shut the door. But this was beyond me. What more can the king's successor do than what has already been done? Okay, I'm gonna do it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. All right. Hey. Can I help you? Well, you actually already have, Jed. I just, uh... I don't smoke. And I definitely don't sleep with groupies, so just... Actually, I heard you were really religious, and so... - I take it you're not. - I'm spiritual. Isn't everybody? You just have no idea, do you? About what? You know, normally, I would be really, really offended, but you are just so cute. And now I get to have a secret, and that's always fun, isn't it? Okay. It's good to meet you, whatever your name is. This whole thing is great. No, I know. I just thought I'd introduce... Come on! Whoo! Whoo! Take your words and overtures Your jokes, so green, those Let them sink into your drink Tonight I want to close Underneath my overcoat Yes, underneath my chest A hurricane is shaking And I'm faking To get undressed Take me, shake me And break me into two A million little pieces I'll spread all over you I wanna fly up to the roof And come down when I'm ready I want my head down to my toes To feel like confetti Whoo! Have you heard of Shelby Bale? I've heard of her but never seen her. Well, you're gonna be doing a lot more of both. She's your new opener. She'll make your worries Run away They're going up in flames Let yourself do what you want Without an ounce of shame 'Cause when the morning Sun comes You'll have to say goodbye So come and claim your throne Be king tonight Take me, shake me And break me into two A million little pieces I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare. You're welcome. Whose heart is a trap, whose hands are chains. To feel like confetti, yeah I'm just out of control Whoo - Hey. - Hey. Hey, buddy. - Oh. How are you? - Good. - Good. - This is a nice surprise. - Did the show get canceled? - I wish. I fly out tomorrow morning actually. I just had to come home, you know? - Do you wanna be in my band? - That's what I wanna do. That's why I came home. Go upstairs and get that ready, all right? Thank you. Yeah, I just wanted to be with my wife, you know? Don't start what you can't finish. Nap time? No, I'm afraid we've outgrown nap time. I miss it. I'm exhausted. - Tonight, I promise. - Tonight. I'm gonna hold you to that. Couldn't hold out for another couple weeks, huh? - How long this time? - Three months. Stan added Shelby Bale to the tour. - Who? - She's just this singer with a cult following, and I get her fans, she gets my fans, and we book a lot more shows and make more money. Do you need more money, or fans? - It's not just that, Rose. - Then what? I'm helping people. I know it sounds stupid, but in my own way, I am. Look, I get e-mails and people coming up to me saying that they... I'm helping their life make sense. They were about to give up and they heard my songs. People are looking for stuff, Rose. Meaning, hope, God. I don't tell them, they're not gonna hear. Jed. Your biggest fan is upstairs and he needs you more than God does. Bring him and come with me. So he can sleep on buses and jets? Getting dragged from hotel to hotel? What kind of life is that? It's not a life, Rose. I'm talking about three months. Which will become a year. You won't have a reason to tell Stan no. You'll have me to play groupie. What is that supposed to mean? Feels like you don't come home for me anymore. It's like you come home for... Let me fix that. Please, I'm trying to fix that. If you come with me, I'll see you every day. I'll see Ray. We'll spend time together. - Please. - It's not just Ray, Jed. What? Your dad has a dead bear in his living room. I'm sure he's gonna be fine. - Please. - No, no. He's not doing well, Jed. Daddy, do you wanna be in my band now? Sorry. Yeah, buddy. Yeah, come on. All right, let's go. Drum solo! I got blisters on my fingers. All right, Ringo. It sounds good. Rose. Rose. Ray's asleep. I fell asleep. Yeah, you did. Okay. Rose. Rose. When are you gonna stop being so rude? I'm Shelby. I know. You know now. Why didn't you just tell me who you were? Kindness. I was being nice. How is that being nice? For a moment, you felt wanted and... It's a good feeling, isn't it? Okay, unless turning me down was unpleasant. If it was, I'm really sorry. You can let me know how to make it up to you. Hello, you've reached Rose. Please leave me a message. Hey, babe, it's me. I just wanted to call and say that I love you, and that I miss you and I'm thinking about you. I'll talk to you later. Bye. And all I wanna be Is with you All I wanna be is with you There is nothing that's new Under the sun I ain't doing nothing That hasn't been done All the lies be truth to me When all I want to be Is with you All I wanna be is with you All I wanna be is with you I want your love I want your touch All I wanna be is with you All I wanna be is with you I miss you more With every mile I go to bed just to dream Of your smile You're a garden bloom In a thousand hues All I wanna be is with you And with every goodbye It gets harder to try When all hope seems lost The heart just dies But there's life If we see this through And all I want to be Is with you All I wanna be is with you All I wanna be is with you I want your love I want your touch Yeah, all I wanna be Is with you All I wanna be is with you All I wanna be is with you All I wanna be is with you I want your love I want your touch All I wanna be is with you All I wanna be is with you See the fire in your eyes Light in your smile All I wanna be is with you All I wanna be is with you Good job. - That was awesome. So good. - Oh, thank you. I knew you were good but that was ridiculous. - Thank you. - Guys, that was magic. - That's what I was telling her. - That was wizardry. I need three more months of that. Okay? - You got it. You can do it. - All right. All right. Perfect. Perfect. Do you know any more of my songs? Okay, I always thought this song needed a little ladies' touch. How about y'all? That may be true, but I don't see a lady up here right now. Ooh... Jed, you just try to sing the song, and I'll see what I can do. I've been waiting for you To come along Seeing notes on a page But not the song Had a hole in my heart A pain so strong Only a woman like you Could take me on There's a plan for us A hand divine The waiting was worth it Now you're my wife Welcome home. Thank you. Where's Ray? He's asleep. Good. Hi. I'm really tired, Jed. Me too. I'm exhausted. I've been gone a long time. How long are you home this time? The tour was great, Rose. Thanks for asking. Had a great time. I know how the tour was. I have the Internet. It's how I get to know my husband. You have the money too, right? You think that's what I care about? I think you care about your dad and I can feel it every time I'm laying in bed by myself. Thinking about all you care about. Rose, if that was all I cared about, I could get it. I wouldn't have to come home. Can we at least talk first? "Hi, honey, how was your day? How was your year?" Don't exaggerate. Don't act like I haven't seen you and we haven't had the same fight every two weeks. I was trying to get you to do something romantic. I was trying to do something romantic. Ask you to do something besides just grab me. How awful for you. To feel desired by your spouse. - It's a terrible thing. - Leave me alone, Jed. Forgive my insensitivity, but I don't have a lot of experience in that. Maybe you can tell me what that's like. Leave me alone! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. - Hey, come here. - Hey. Hey, buddy. - What's wrong, Mom? - Hey. Oh, nothing, baby. Everything's fine. It's okay. I just miss your daddy. That's all. Let's go to bed. Come, my beloved. Let us go to the countryside. You old buzzard. Oh! What a big boy. Ha-ha-ha. - Unh! Let Pop-Pop put you down. - Ha, ha. Hey, Daddy. Let us go early to the vineyards to see if the vines have budded. - Hey. - Shep. How you doing? Welcome. Ha, ha. Hey, you little rascal. What are you doing, buddy? Come back here. - Daddy? You all right? - Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm all right. That little rascal. I'm gonna go over here and work this other row, hon. All right. Oh, come on, buddy. Come on. Oh! Oh, you got me. You got me. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. You got me. I'm done. You gonna help me? All right. - Jed. - It's all right. I found this. - Oh, okay. All right. - What are you doing, buddy? - I'm making them grow faster. - Ha, ha. No. You're making them grow faster, huh? Oh, buddy that's not how it works. If you force them, you'll get bad grapes. - You want bad grapes? - Yes. No. No, you don't want bad grapes. - Yes, I do. - Ha, ha. - Treat them right. - Okay. - Give them time. - Okay. And when they're ready, they'll let you know. Okay. Okay. I undertook great projects. I built houses and planted vineyards. In all this, my wisdom stayed with me. Have fun with your grandpa, okay? We'll be back in a couple hours, hon. All right, Daddy. Bye. Come to Europe with me. Please. I'm hoping we can come visit soon. No, Rose, not visit. Come with me. I can't, Jed. You've seen him lately. I can't leave him. Not now. Okay. I understand. And when I surveyed all my hands had done, what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless. A chasing after the wind. Nothing was gained under the sun. There was a man all alone. There was no end to his toil. Yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. Hey, you're growing, buddy. "For who am I toiling?" he asked. "And why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?" Whoever loves money never has enough. Oh Oh Oh Love is the power That heals Thank you, Glasgow! Thank you, Dublin! Thank you, London! - I love you! I love you! - Ha-ha-ha. This too is meaningless. Ow! Ha-ha-ha. Okay, all right. All right, shut up, people. Uh, Mr. King, your turn. Uh-oh. - I'm good. I'm good. - Oh, yeah. So I think he's adding drinking to the list of things he's only done with his wife. Ooh... You guys, he has got a vineyard back home. A vineyard. Because he knows, as soon as he gets home and walks through his big front door, he can have all the wine he wants. Am I right? No. Heh, are you serious? Okay. I'm sorry, I didn't know. I just... I hate seeing you like this and I wanted you to have a good time. Enjoy it. Are there not shots on the bar? I think there's shots on the bar. Right? Jed! Jed! Jed! All I'm saying is, you've earned it. Jed! Jed! Jed! - Come on, man! - Let's do this! Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen, I think we all owe it to Miss Shelby Bale. Give it up. This one's for my boys, ladies and gentlemen. Ah! - He can't even walk. - Ha-ha-ha. - That's your band. Ha-ha-ha. - I know. - It's your room. - Oh. Okay. So did you have a good time? I really did. Thank you. Thank you. Now I get to scratch "Visit England" off my to-do list. Was that right after "Get a whole lot of tattoos"? I've been noticing. You have one or two. Uh, yeah, no. Uh-uh. It was after "Meet Jed King." - Oh. - Mm. Seriously. What's the story with these? Hm? Just my way of preserving memories, I guess. - You should try scrap-booking. - Scrap-booking. Heh. Ha-ha-ha. It's just... It seems more prudent. Yeah, it kills memories. - It kills memories? - It's a fact. I don't know. It's just that a photo replaces a memory in your mind. Mm. I see these and the memories just come flooding back, you know? So you don't regret any of them? Feeling regret and guilt is like punching yourself in the face. Sure, it hurts, but it's self-inflicted, so don't do it. That's how I feel about tattoos. Well, all I'm saying is do what you want... and don't feel guilty about it. Good night, Jed. I said to myself, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good." But that also proved to be meaningless. Deep, dark sky So black, so bright All curtains back tonight I'm obsessed, I must confess I don't care If it's wrong or right - Hey. - Oh, hey. - Good morning. Um... - What time is it? It is 1:15. You okay? - Yeah, you? - Mm-hm. - You can take that if you want. - Uh, what? The phone. Actually, it's you. I'm sorry. I, uh... I grabbed it for you because you left it at the bar and obviously forgot to give it back to you, so, yeah. Whoa. Jed, I'm sorry. - It's okay. - I feel terrible. It's not your fault. I should call her back though. Yeah. - See you later, okay? - Mm. - Jed. - Hey. Where were you? I've been trying to get a hold of you all night. There's a time for everything, and a season for every purpose under heaven. The wise have eyes in their heads while the fool walks in darkness. But I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both. So then I said to myself, "Like the fool, the wise too must die." What then do I gain by being wise? No, no. I'm sorry, sir. No! - Hello? - Oh, buddy, man, I woke you up. - What time is it over there? - It's 6 a.m. Wow, man. Do you want me to call you back? No, it's fine. Listen, are you anxious to get back out here? - Yeah. - Because we are certainly anxious and excited about having you back out here. Friday is Amsterdam. Everything is a go. Stan, listen. Brother, we have lost six shows. Now, I know that was an emergency. But we have an emergency here, okay? We are hemorrhaging money. Hemorrhaging money, man. - People are getting upset. - Stan, this is my life. This is my life. And this is how you pay for your life. If you were a nobody, still just David King's kid, I wouldn't care what you did. No one would. But I don't think that's who you wanna be, or is it? Because you can always just walk away. I have to go back. - Please. - I don't have a choice. - I don't have a choice. - Yes, you do. Please just stay. If I stay, we're gonna owe a lot of money. Take me with you then. I can't... I can't do that, Rose. Why? All the reasons you said. I can't do that to Ray. I should've gone with you then. I'm so sorry, Jed. - I'm so sorry. - It's all right. I should've gone with you. You have a lot to do. You have a lot to do here. Okay? Help me get through these next eight weeks. Then I have a show in Cinci, and then I have a break. How long? We'll start with a year. Okay? Okay. Amsterdam! Can I just tell you what a great time we've had in your city tonight? Ha, ha. Well, there's more fun to be had. - Hey, Jed. - Aah. What is it? What's wrong? I can't breathe. - Slow down. - He's having a panic attack. Listen to me. - I can't feel my hands. - You're not gonna die. Jed. To help you relax, okay? I'm just trying to help you. - I can't sing that song, Shel. - Yes, you can, Jedediah. It's her song. No, it's your song. Do you ever feel like you don't write your own songs? Hm? - Like they were given to you? - By who? God? - What if he takes them away? - Why? Because he doesn't like what you're doing? Look at the world. You like what he's doing? The first time I heard your music, I thought, "This is it. This guy really gets it. This is what I need." But I also thought, you know, "If only he weren't so... Married. ...narrow. But think of the music he could write if he just let go and lived without all of these rules." And then I realized, "I can help him let go. He needs me to." I thought I was going to die out there. I don't ever wanna feel like that again. You won't. Thank you. Appreciate it. I tried cheering myself with wine and embracing folly. Laughter is madness. And what does pleasure accomplish? This is what's happening now. The heart of fools is in the house of pleasure. The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning because a sad face is good for the heart. What do you think? You're the expert. What do you think? Well done. Under this moon I denied myself nothing my eyes desired. I refused my heart no pleasure. Under this moon We are falling Under this moon You belong To me Under this moon We are falling Like stars Like stars Everything was meaningless. Chasing after the wind. - Daddy! - Hey, buddy. - Unh. Did you have fun? - Uh-huh. Look at Mom's belly. Wow. Wow. Look at Mom's belly. - Hi. - Hi. Oh... Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to tell you in person. Hi, Shelby. I'll be right there. I'll be right there. Yup. - Shelby. - Yeah. This is my wife, Rose. Yeah. It's really nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Great show tonight. You're very talented. Thank you. - This is my son, Ray. - Ray. You are so handsome. I've heard so much about you. I feel like I know you guys. But I did not know that you were expecting. - Neither did he. - Oh. No? I'm gonna go drink with the guys. We were headed out. - So I'll just catch you tomorrow? - Yes. Okay. It was nice to meet you. You too. Ready to go? - Yeah. - Okay. I missed you. I missed you. When did you get this? Amsterdam. Why? I don't know. It seemed like a good idea at the time. Oh. Everything okay? Yeah, just... Just give me a second. Jed, please don't do this to me. Please. Let's just go back out there. No, no, no. I'll sing it myself. No, no, no, you won't sing that, no. You will never sing that song. You will never sing that song! Play it. Just play the song. I've been waiting for you To... Stop it! No! You think you're better than me? You think she's better than me? - What was that? - You broke it! You broke it! - Shelby! Get off. - You think you're better? - Get off me! - Stop! Stop! No! I'm gonna tell her! Let me go! I'm gonna tell her! I'm gonna... - Are you threatening me? - Jed! You don't threaten me! I love you. I love you. I love you. Yeah, Stan, this is Matt. I'm over at will call. I'm gonna call you back. Thank you. Don't hang up. Look, I don't care what you do. I don't care who you do it with. When you bring your problems on stage, they become my problems. My very expensive problems. Now, if you can't keep your baggage off stage, I will. Shelby, you are done. Done! I was hoping to bring Ray to your Nashville show also. That be all right? Jed? Yes. That would be fine. Why is Shelby off the tour? I read that she was off the tour. She punched Stan in the face. Good for her. - Why? - I don't know. Look, I don't wanna talk about work right now. Rose. What? Do you not want me here? You're not here. We have to say your name five times before you even answer. - Something is wrong. - I'm just tired. Why aren't you singing my song? Do you...? - Do you not love me anymore? - Rose, of course I do. - Why would you ask me that? - Sing it. I want you to sing it right now. Rose, that song is special to me. All right, it holds a special place, and I'm just tired of being demanded to sing it like some sort of performance monkey. What is that? - What? - Shh. Try it. High five. You still didn't get it. You spit, but you didn't get it. - But you can try... - Shelby? Hey, Jed. Hey, babe, come here. What are you doing here? Why didn't you answer your phone? I'm having dinner with my family. What do you want? Okay, can you just tell Stan to bring me back? Shelby, don't come to my house... What? Are you done with me, is that it? Please. - Ray, go inside, please. - Okay. Because of me? Honey, he's the druggie. - He's the one that takes all my... - Get out. Seriously, dinner on the porch, how cute. Okay. Got it. You too. Get out. - Rose. - Get out! - Get out of the car. - That wine was terrible. Get out of the car. - Jed, stop. - Stop talking! Ray, where's your mom? Rose. You were with her! While I was here carrying our child. - You think this is what I wanted? - Yes! It's what you did. This was your choice! I wanted you! But you made me beg. Girls are begging me and I had to beg my wife. Don't blame this on me, Jed. You did this. Don't blame this on me! I did this, and I'm glad I did this. I'm glad I didn't have to jump through 15,000 hoops or build a chapel, Rose, to do it. She wants me. Me! Because she doesn't know you, Jed. - She does. - No, she doesn't! - She does! - She thinks she does. She thinks she matters. I used to think that. You used to think you mattered so much you could treat me however you wanted. How dare I ask to be treated like an actual human being before I give it up? How cruel, right? You'd tell me over and over you didn't want me. - I never said that. I never... - You did! And now that somebody actually wants me, now you wanna act like a wife. - It's a little late. - You didn't want a wife. - I did! - You didn't. You wanted a whore. - That's not true! - Someone who would lay there. It is true. It clearly is 'cause that's what showed up at our house today! You don't even know her! You don't even know her! Right. Right. Because she's the wife you always wanted. She's gonna raise your children? She's gonna grow old with you? And then, with her sleazy saggy tattoos, that skank will always be in the mood, right? You're a fool, Jed. You are such a fool! You're right! You're right! I am a fool! You're right! You're right! I'm a fool because I married you. But I'm done. So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? All their days, their work is grief and pain. Even at night, their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless. Jed. Stop, stop, stop. What are you doing? Stop. - I want it off. - Stop it. - Stop! - I want it off. Did you flush them? No, no, no. Please say something. Jed. Jed. Jed, please. Jed, please. Jed. Please, come on. Please. Please wake up. Please wake up. Wake up. Please. Please. Will you please talk to me? - Please say something. - Rose. Jed! Jed! - No! No! No! - Jed! Jed. Stop running. What would have happened if you would've died, Jed? You would've been better off. You would've had everything. Jed, what did we have when we first got married? I had everything I needed. But you didn't. You still don't. I made mistakes. With us, there's things that I wish I could do over. But I can't give you whatever it is you're looking for. No one can. When Dad died, I realized there's nothing in this world that won't go away eventually. My only hope is that there's something bigger than this world. What if that's a fool's hope? Then I'll take it. I'll take it. If I'm gonna raise a son and a daughter on my own, I need to believe there's a point. A girl? Found out I'm having a girl. You wanna raise them on your own? That wasn't my plan, Jed. I want a man who believes in something bigger than all this. Someone greater than himself. And that's not you anymore. That man died a long time ago. Goodbye, Jed. There's a valley of sorrow In my soul Where every night I hear The thunder roll And the shadows Filling up this land Are the ones I built With my own hand Here you are, Mr. King. In this valley of sorrow In my soul And the rock of ages I have known Is a weariness Down in the bone I used to ride it Like a rolling stone Now I just carry it alone Hello? Hey, buddy. What are you up to? Working. The grapes will be ready soon. I take it you're working with your mom. Is she there? Can I talk to her? She's busy right now. That's fine. I just wanted to call and see how you guys were doing, okay? Do you wanna come home? - Are you coming to the festival? - When is it? When is it? - October 12th. - October 12th. All right, count me in. Hey, listen. I'm gonna let you get back to work, okay? - I love you. - I love you too. Bye. Bye, buddy. Why should we be If no one's there to see All of our deeds That's good. New song? Hey, hey. What's happening, brother? Very nice. Beautiful place. I'm serious. What do you want, Stan? Maybe I wanna come see you. See how you're doing. Do you? Okay. I do wanna show you something. Here, just look at this. Why would you show that to me? Not the video. Don't look at the video. Look at the view counts. I don't care about the view count. There's something here. There's something here we can build on. It's a story of redemption. This isn't redemption, this is exploitation. Just listen. American Roots Music Awards. You and Shelby, if you can put your junk aside for just one second, let the world see your healthy, redeemed, rehabbed faces on TV, ready for a comeback. - When? - October 12th. I can't do it. Can't do it. I have plans. I promised Ray. - Ray? Who is Ray? - Stan. Ray is your son, of course. Come on, man, you know I love Ray. Hey, you know what? Ray wants to go to college one day. Ray wants his dad to shave and sing, be a rock star. Do you understand that this is a second chance? This is a chance for you to put everything behind you. Rehab, Rose, your dad. Are you in? I thought that I was strong I thought things Would be different this time I guess that I was wrong As wrong As you You call me beautiful You ready to do this? I guess we'll see. It wasn't me You look really good. Thank you. You too. - You look healthy. - Thank you. How ugly I can be Jed, um... I knew you were eaten up with guilt, and I just thought if she knew... then it would be over and you and I could be together without all this guilt... and you'd be at peace. You call me beautiful But you Must've seen the light We have a chance to start over. For things to be the way they should be, you know? Don't call me beautiful You don't know how ugly I can be - Here we go. - Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jed King and Shelby Bale. Why have everything? You're leaving here With nothing Can't take anything 'Cause you have to move on You were the wise one Putting your disguise on Lying to protect You're chasing after wind Why should you be If no one's there to see? All of your deeds Are raindrops in the sea What do we mean If nothing has meaning? If in the end We're chasing after wind I had everything That don't leave me anything I had my plans Crumble in the sand Now I understand I was born a natural man Racing through the end And chasing after wind Why should I be If nothing has made me? All that I've done Will flame out with the sun Why should I sing If nothing has meaning? You know, when you're always under bright lights... you can't see the stars. You forget things. You forget that somebody put the stars there... and that they love you enough to die for you. And it's that kind of love that makes songs worth singing and life worth living. I had that love. I threw it away. Because I am a fool. I'm sorry. You're right. We have a chance to do things right. You really think she'll take you back? Either way, this is goodbye. Jed, stop! You can't do this. I can. You're watching it happen. You realize what you are walking away from? - Nothing that matters. - Let me tell you something. You walk out that door, I will sue you for every show you canceled. I know. Go ahead. It's only money, Stan. I've lost much worse. - Ray. - Dad. Hey. Unh! - I missed you. - You're late. I know. I'm sorry I'm a little late, - but I'm here, right? - Uh-huh. Where's your mom? She's over there by the wine people. Heh. By the wine people? Okay. I'm gonna go talk to her, all right? - Okay. - I love you. - Okay. - You know that? Ow. I'll see you in a little bit, okay? - Okay. - All right. I'm glad you could make it. Excuse me. Rose. What are you doing here? I thought you had a show. I love you. - I love you. - Jed, stop. Just stop. I did it. I quit it. Everything. Tonight. I was on stage and I just walked away, because it's not what I want. I want you. - You had your chance, Jed. - Rose. - It's really good, Rose. - Oh, good, good. Thank you. That's our Syrah. It's from '95. '95 was one of our best years, so... Is that who I think it is? Jed, get off the stage. Rose, I wanna play you a song. All right? I've wanted to play it so much. I never can. It makes me think of you. I've heard it. Everyone has. Not like this. Please. No. To everything Turn, turn, turn There is a season Turn, turn, turn And a time to every purpose Under heaven A time to be born A time to die A time to plant A time to reap A time to kill A time to heal A time to laugh A time to weep To everything Turn, turn, turn There is a season Turn, turn, turn And a time for every purpose Under heaven A time to build up A time to break down A time to dance A time to mourn A time to cast away stones A time to gather Stones together To everything Turn, turn, turn There is a season Turn, turn, turn And a time for every purpose Under heaven A time to gain A time to lose A time to rend A time to sew A time to love A time to hate A time of peace Rose, know it's not too late I'm so sorry. Marrying you is the only smart thing I ever did. You're enough. You're a gift from God. All I want is to be your husband. I wanna raise our children. I will never leave you again. I'll never sing another note if you're not there to hear it. Please forgive me. It'll take a really long time. I just cleared my schedule for forever. And if it takes forever, I'll be here forever. Remember your creator in the days of your youth. Before the pitcher is shattered at the spring and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to the God who gave it. You who are young, be happy while you are young and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Goodbye, Dad. I love you. Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun. For in the realm of the dead where you are going, there is neither working, nor planning, nor knowledge, nor wisdom. Now all has been heard, here is the end of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind, for God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil. To everything Turn, turn, turn There is a season Turn, turn, turn And a time to every purpose Under heaven A time to be born A time to die A time to plant A time to reap A time to kill A time to heal A time to laugh A time to weep To everything Turn, turn, turn There is a season Turn, turn, turn And a time to every purpose Under heaven A time to build up A time to break down A time to dance A time to mourn A time to cast away stones A time to gather Stones together To everything Turn, turn, turn There is a season Turn, turn, turn And a time to every purpose Under heaven A time of love A time of hate A time of war A time of peace A time you may embrace A time to refrain From embracing To everything Turn, turn, turn There is a season Turn, turn, turn And a time to every purpose Under heaven A time to gain A time to lose A time to rend A time to sew A time for love A time for hate A time for peace I swear it's not too late One, two. I think you'll know this one. Oh, yeah. Oh, it's a beautiful voice That made it. Your arrows have pierced me I'm bleeding I'm shaking You have overwhelmed me And made my heart grow I cried all these tears With fears I was forsaken After I've begged you To leave me alone I cannot hear I have no sight Dark is near And your blinding light Can you hear me when I cry? Catch me when I fall 'Cause I can't hold on Take it away, boys. Ha, ha. Oh, I love that. Now here is the end Of the matter Why you should live A good life Days dawn in the shadow Of the darkness He's gonna bring To the light So cherish the gifts Of your maker Delight in the wife Of your youth Remember God's your creator Whose help leads To the truth Whose help leads To the truth So here is the end Of the matter While you're searching for The truth my friend He carved his mark In our hearts But we're never gonna Comprehend Just how he caused The beginning How he's gonna bring it All to an end The only hope that we have Is the only son That he did send Is the only son That he did send So at the end of the matter His will be done, not mine He breaks the seals Fulfills the signs And makes everything So beautiful It's all gonna be So beautiful In his Time Hi, guys. Hi. Come to see me? How are you so big? Let's go.
