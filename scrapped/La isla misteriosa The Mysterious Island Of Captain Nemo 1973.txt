Furthermore the country was exposed to a hurricane which devastated great parts of the country. ln this inferno some brave men dared to escape in a balloon. Their escape started in Richmond the headquarters of the Confederates which was surrounded by the North. Mr. Gideon Spilett belongs to that kind of American journalists who don't shy away from anything to get all the information to report to their newspaper as soon as possible. An honorable man - who can put through - a cosmopolitan. That is a very good reputation Mr. Spilett. lt is a bit exaggerated Colonel. A friend of mine wrote this. He wrote it when l became war correspondent. You must not believe what the papers say. Bravo! l'm glad that you say that. Mr. Spilett do you really think you can make us believe that it was necessary for your reportage for your readers to go to the front line making sketches? From which anyone can instantly see where our defensive lines are located at? As well as our artillery? Believe it or not. But it doesn't change my mission. l haven't come here to become part of the war. My mission is to report objectively. As you wish. We will see how objective you are... ... when you are executed! l'll do my very best. Forward march! Left - left - left Cyrus Jebedias Smith - engineer. l'm under the command of General Grant. l have already heard of you Mr. Smith. You are known as the inventor of the hospital trains. An admirable humane idea. Astonishing. Especially for a member of the North! - lndeed. You know that we are expecting very much of you Mr. Smith. We hope that you will supply us with information of General Grant's headquarters. l'm afraid. But you are mistaken. Are you really sure about that? - Absolutely. Are these civil clothes or is it a uniform you are wearing? l can't tell at first sight. lf l knew l would see you l would of course have put on my uniform Colonel. My servant keeps it ready at all times. With polished buttons. You did not answer my question. - You know that l am the chief of the railway service. And in this job l am a civilian. But l still am a Major in the Union's Army. According to this report you used a revolver to murder one of my men. l regret this incident. But he attacked me with his bayonet. You refuse to answer my questions? Yes. Mr. Smith we have a big problem here. lsn't that so gentlemen? Everything would be very simple if Major Smith was here. He would be prisoner of war with all privileges of his rank. But for the civilian Mr. Smith things could become very unpleasant. You will be executed. lf l answer your questions l am Major Smith a prisoner of war? But when l refuse to talk l am Mr. Smith - a civilan who has killed one of your men? You understand me quite right. You already know my answer. Don't be too convinced Mr. Smith. l will give you a couple of days to think it over. Bring him to his cell. May my servant come with me? Of course if you own the nigger. Nobody owns him. He is my servant. A runaway slave. We'll sell him with the others! l am no slave. l am a free man! Stop it Nab. lt is useless. lf you should try to escape remember: Richmond is surrounded. There is neither a way in nor out. Top! Top my buddy! Get away from the dog! You are not allowed to speak! Move it! l will find you! Here it is! Lift me up! Hey sailor! - Yes. Give it to me. A small box for one dollar? lf you don't want it... - No no. l'll take it. . - Your bad habits will ruin you Pencroff! - Speak for yourself! Hey where's my dollar? Wait! What about matches? - We are not allowed to have any. Because of the gun powder. But that was part of the deal! lf they catch me l'll be shot. - What am l supposed to do with tobbacco without matches? Careful somebody's coming! Get me matches and l'll give you another dollar! Pencroff! Why don't you rub wood? Gentlemen may l introduce myself: l am Cyrus Smith engineer. - Cyrus Smith? l know you. l have published several of your articles in my newspaper. Shortly before this stupid war began. Which newspaper? l am Gideon Spilett from the New York Herald. l know you too. l am one of your trustiest readers. Mr. Pencroff and Harbert Brown. Bonaventura Pencroff boatswain on board the Silver Fox. Whale hunter from Nintucket. Under the command of the dead Jonathan Brown. My dad Sir. Currently imprisoned in this jail where we are going mad thanks to Colonel Larochette. Everybody has already had the pleasure? l wouldn't call it pleasure. What was l supposed to do? l am civilan. Captain Brown told me: Pencroff bring Habert to his uncle in San Francisco. So l did. And then we got captured by pirates who brought us to City Points. Then Richmond was surrounded and Colonel Larochette nails us in here. Every day he threatens to shoot us. Just because Nintucket is in the north and this is south. They have plundered Larochette's properties and killed his family. lt is not so suprising that he is seeking revenge. But what have Harbert and l got to do with it? The battle you landlubbers are fighting is non of my concern. lf you ask me this war is against the law of war. My dear Pencroff the laws of war are only valid in times of peace. Alert! Run if you don't want to die! Cover! Get up you bastards! - What are you trying to accomplish? - This is our last chance! Once they have put us in chains it's over! Run! Run you bastards! Next! Get in line! The niggers are revolting! Open the gate! Where did he go? l don't know. But he's not going to get far. Are we going to follow him? No. l don't want to die. l have seen a balloon outside. Do you know what they use it for? They use it to transmit news to General Lee. They keep him informed about the situation in the city. They are waiting that the wind blows in the right direction. You are pretty good informed. Thanks to Mr. Pencroff's secret treasure. l have got the savings of the last five years hidden in my belt. A piece of gold once in a while and the guards talk. But regarding the balloon: if we can manage to escape who is going to handle it? l can do it. But how are we going to get out of this cell? l think that our only hope is my trusty servant Nab. What is this supposed to be? - l don't know. All l know is that l don't like it. They say it is Polenta. Polenta! No way! There is not a single corn in Richmond for over a month! Hey Williams! - Yes. - Come here. Here take this. - What is this? Oat of the officer's horses. l have taken some when there was nobody around. At least we know now what we eat. You don't happen to have some oil? Unfortunately not. Unless you want some gun lube. Look! - lt's probably the last dog alive in Richmond. lt looks pretty good. Come here doggy. Hold the dog! l got him! Get lost! Top! Top! That's my boy! Where is Mr. Smith? Listen to the song of the Nautilus. lt defies even the worst storms even if it has to dive. The phantom of the Nautilus is Captain Nemo's ship. Oh hey it's the ship of Captain Nemo. - Doesn't our friend Pencroff have a beautiful voice Mr. Smith? But l have never heard him sing the second verse of this song. - That's your fault. You always interrupt me at the same spot. lt is my favorite song. l know it line by line. Hey sailor! Do you have the matches? What's wrong with him? Don't worry about him. Shut up! - Give me the matches! - You'll get a whole bag unopened! - Give it to me! - The money first! Nab! l knew it! Hurry! The guards won't get up. We'll bring them inside. Help me! We'll go to the balloon. But one after the other! That way we won't attract so much attention. Come with me Harbert! l'll take the matches. Hide! Pencroff don't! - That's our only chance! Harbert come here! The wind has calmed. Not a breeze! lt's going to be a comfortable flight. l guess so. What are you doing? Hold it! What are you doing here during curfew? - We have a secret mission. - password? - Secret mission by the direct order of Colonel Larochette. Read it to him. Read it yourself! And now tell your friends to put down their rifles. And be quiet or l'll blow off your brains! Do as he says. Move it! A patrol! Move it! Hold it! Who are you? Balloon control. What's the password? Tell him! - The balloon has a different password. l don't know it. Step forward! - But... - Go! Hold it! The password! You are too far away. You can only whipser it to him. Do you want me to yell it so that anybody can hear it? Come closer and l'll tell you. Forgive me Sergeant. Now run! They take the balloon! Only shoot at the refugees and the basket. Farewell Richmond! We've made it! l only hope that they didn't damage the balloon. - Where did they hit you Pencroff? You are not bleading! They didn't hurt me. They have hit my new pipe. That's a bad sign. Listen to me Pencroff smoking is dangerous to your health. You are looking worried Mr Smith. Everything went fine until now. l've just checked the barometer. lt is not only a simple storm but a hurricane. A really big one. ln 1865 the civil war was raging in the United States. Furthermore the country was exposed to a hurricane which devastated great parts of the country. ln this inferno some brave men dared to escape in a balloon. They escaped from Richmond the headquarters of the Confederates. lt's now been 4 days that the hurricane blows us around. Where is it taking us? Who knows? Our compass is broke. What time is it? Something between 6 and 8. l can't tell any better because of the fog. lt is midnight in Richmond. - Really? That's a difference of at least 4 hours. That means that we have travelled round about... - 5000 miles. And nobody knows where to. Don't you feel well Harbert? Everything is fine Mr. Spilett. The governor should have given us provisions. No the food was uneatable anyway. lt is always uneatable in a besieged city. Not even Top ate it. Hey careful! Thanks Mr. Pencroff. Mr. Smith the barometer! We're loosing height. We are above the ocean! We have no ballast anymore. We'll have to loose weight! Throw out anything unused! The water barrel! l don't mind right now. The box can go as well! What's inside? Gold! - Are you mad? - The gold will kill us! Calm down! Don't fight! Good. That should do it. We are keeping altitude. No we still are loosing altitude not that fast though. The balloon has probably been damaged. lt has become more and more limp since we started. lf we don't hit land in the next 45 minutes it's over! Mr. Smith we still could throw out the weapons and our coats! - Good idea Harbert! That'll give us additional 15 minutes. Don't forget your belt Mr. Pencroff. With all my money? - Of course. What kind of belt is that? But that are my savings of the last five years! - What's more valuable to you right now: your live or your savings? You can't even see the barometer anymore! lt's no use anyway. lf the balloon hits the water it's over! We can't do anything! Let's climb up the ropes and cut off the basket! Give Top to me Mr. Smith! Here you go. Does it work? Help! l've got you! Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you Mr. Spilett. To be honest Mr. Pencroff it was purely a reflex movement. Are you trying to say that if you had thought about it... Try to put yourself into my position! You weigh about 200 pounds. You know the problem with you is that l never know when you are joking. Don't worry about that. l don't know it either. Mr. Smith if a flash hits the balloon is it going to explode? Hopefully not. What's wrong with you? Listen! Don't you hear that? l can hear the surf! And wherever there is surf there is land! Land in sight! Mr. Smith land in sight! Hold on tight! Mr. Smith! Top! Mr. Spilett! Are we save? - Yes we are. How is Harbert? - He'll be alright. Everything will be fine. Mr. Smith! - ls he okay? He's going to be alright. Like a fish in the water. Where is he going? You are wasting your time dear black friend. He's dead. And we aren't much better off. Who are you? The next morning. How did you like the hotel Mr. Spilett? The beds were a bit hard. You would have slept better on the ocean floor. But it would have been forever. We'll have to find water as soon as possible. Otherwise the birds will eat us alive. Maybe Nab already found some. Or the sea has taken him. What about Mr. Smith? Mr. Spilett l know the sea since l was a child. We have been too far away from the coast when we crashed. Not even the lord himself could swim that far. Here. Tell me Pencroff have you ever been wrecked? - Yes two times. The first time at the Chinese coast and the second time at Newfoundland. You are experienced then. Yes but you can't compare that. We had guns tools and provisions. And now we have none of this. Honestly speaking this is a real bad start. You could as well say: hopeless. ln the bars at the harbor they say that cast away people ate themselves. Let's hope that it doesn't get this far. No offense intended Pencroff but l'm convinced that you wouldn't be such a good lrish Stew. Hey Harbert is awake. Come here! - Come on boy coffee's getting cold. Good morning Mr. Spilett good morning Pencroff. Good morning Harbert. Where is Nab? l hope he is alright? - Of course he is. And Mr. Smith? Mr. Smith? Nab is looking for him. Do you really think that he'll find him? Come boy you've got to eat something. We only have shells today but once we are organized l'll promise you the best dainties. Thank you Mr. Spilett. But that are no shells. That are lithodorms. Litho what? Lithodorms or sea-dates. But they are eatable? - Of course. They are similar to shells. They have a different chalk structure. You know pretty much! Don't forget he's going to school in Boston. You learn a lot there. No doubt about that. Nab's coming back! Nab! What did you find Nab? lt's hopeless. Nothing. Does this boulder never stop? You shouldn't be so pessimistic Pencroff. lt already stopped. Yes. But l'm still hungry. You are not alone my friend. Last christmas we had roasted turkey. Delicious! Turkey filled with stuffing. lt was melting in my mouth. Do you think that's funny? - lt's impossible Mr. Spilett. l'm convinced that Mr. Smith is still alive. Top is with him. He would have brought him to the shore. You have seen it how he jumped after him. lt's okay Nab. Water! A river! Potable water! Delicious! And now a steak. That wouldn't be a problem if we had a rifle. Harbert take a look for something to eat. Mr. Spilett we should split up. You and Nab take the other side of the river. Splendid idea. Nab you go first. We'll meet at the estuary. Mr. Spilett can l ask you something? - Sure go ahead. - Can't l go back to the beach? Maybe l can find Mr. Smith? - Yes go Nab if you still believe that you can find him. l'll have to try. Harbert walk over there! This one is ours! Don't let him get away! Just a small snack. We'll find a bigger one. You have scared us to death Mr. Spilett! Why are you running around here all by yourself? lf l only knew what has happened to me. There was some sort of bright lightray. And it felt like my body was exploding. That's probably just the heat. Besides we haven't had anything to eat for two days. Where is Nab Mr. Spilett? Nab? He wanted to go to the beach. He still hopes to find Mr. Smith. But how did you find me? - When we didn't meet at the estuary we came back to look for you. lt was not easy to follow your traces on the stones. Can you walk? l think so. - You can lean on me. Do you think l can't make it by myself? This is just like made for us! There is even a well. We could go back to the river? - Of course. But there is the swamp. We'll stay here. lt's not too far away. Nab will find us. He'll see the smoke from our fire. The smoke from our fire... That reminds me of something. We don't have matches. - Wrong. lt looks like our fire is going to burn pretty soon. And how are you going to do that? l 've got a full bag of dry matches! Don't you remember? l have bought them from the guard. He wanted to cheat me. - lf l remember correctly it was you who cheated him? Am l supposed to have bad feelings? - Of course not. - All we need now is some wood. And maybe we can find something like a cooking pot. He was gruesome and very tricky... ... he was always on guard... Pencroff! - What have you got Mr. Spilett? Lithodorms. And this here. - What is that Mr. Spilett? - Wild Yam. The favourite dish of the Seminols in Florida. How does it taste? You want us to eat this? You have to cook it first. Otherwise it is too bitter. Right once they are cooked they are a delicacy? And now Sir the big moment! This is the sensation! What's wrong? Dirty trick! What's wrong? The matches are used! Used? That's the reason why they were laughing. They expected me to pay one dollar for a bag full of used matches! They are probably still laughing. - They would laugh even louder if they knew how good the joke really is. l really would like to be there when Richmond is taken over. l really would like to explain my feelings to them! But that doesn't start a fire right now. What's the matter? l'll tell you: we don't have matches so we are going to eat your lithodorms. For god's sake... That way you won't ever get a fire Pencroff. The natives can do it. But they know it better than we do. Besides they would use different wood. That won't ever work! Wait and see. There is no reason why it shouldn't burn. You are wasting your energy Pencroff. But we must have fire Mr. Spilett. lf we don't get something to eat pretty soon we don't need it anymore. Nab! Did you find anything? - No nothing. lf you want something warm to eat here you go Nab. What am l supposed to do with it? Make fire! l've had it. You always do what you want. You have left Mr. Spilett behind. He nearly got killed! lf he had died it would have been your fault. But when we ask a small favour of you you don't even bother to listen. ls this what you told him? l've told Nab to leave me alone. l can take care of myself. Besides itjust concerns me Mr. Pencroff. That's a big mistake Mister! Whatever happens here concerns us all. Your business is our business. This whole situation is due to him. Me? - Yes you! Everything: the arrestment the escape ... that we got here is only because we have war isn't it so? And who started this war? Some mad niggers. lsn't that so? You would be a good writer Pencroff. Tell me nigger! Tell me what you think. Alright maybe you are no nigger. Maybe you are like us and the sun just plays a trick on us. You are a little darker that's all. That would be possible. What do you say nigger? lf you call me niggerjust one more time l'll beat the devil out of you. Did l understand you right nigger? Try it. That's enough! There! lsn't that... That's Top! Top! - Top! Come on here! Where do you come from? Top where is Mr. Smith? Show me where is Mr. Smith? Run! - Run! l know this bay. l've been here before. Footprints! Mr. Smith! He's alive! l knew it! Top that was really good! lt looks like he is simply sleeping. Nothing more. Mr. Smith! Mr. Smith wake up! Wake up Mr. Smith! What's wrong Harbert? Why are you leaving? l'm scared Mr. Spilett. What if he is sick after all? l have never seen sombody sleeping like this. Neither have l. l didn't notice anything unsual but l must admit... l have a restricted medical knowledge. This is odd. lt makes me nervous is that he is not injured. How can someone survive such a fall? l have been here yesterday. The cave was empty! Maybe you simply didn't notice him? - No l know it for sure. Besides l have slept over there. - But where are your footprints? We've only seen the ones from Mr. Smith. They were washed away with the flood. And what about Mr. Smith's? - l've been in this cave yesterday. And l walked along the bay two times. - But that's impossible Nab. You should have seen him. - Listen Mr. Spilett. When we got here we walked straight to the Cave right? Yes. At the bottom of the cliff... ... just about sea level... ... there is a big shell with a whole in it. l don't know why l noticed it. But it is there. Harbert where are you going? l'll be right back. Listen Nab if your footprints have been washed away and his are not that means he must have come out of the water when you were already gone. Much later. Your footprints have vanished in less than 24 hours. And his are still fresh. That would mean that he was in the water for over 30 hours. That's absurd. - You are probably right Mr. Spilett. lt must have been the wrong bay. But still... Harbert! Exactly like Nab said. He's moving! But it is daylight. l was asleep. But l have fallen into the sea? Or is it... lsland or mainland? - Good question. How did you survive? lf l only knew... l fell into the water... l don't know what happened afterwards. Do you feel alright? Much better. Strange l feel much better but... l feel like l'm drugged. l feel paralysed. l don't know if it is just a dream or if l'm awake. l think it's getting better now. Everything was just a dream. You didn't answer my question. - What question? lsland or mainland? That's our smallest problem. The question is extremely important! Maybe you are right. But we don't know. lf it is an island than it is the biggest l have seen. An island is an island. You need a boat in order to get away from it. Mr. Smith will build one for us. Just a lousy boat? Why not a steamboat? lf he thinks that would be the right way. l must admit we are pretty helpless. Since we don't have any provisions we've only had some shells. And we had to eat them raw since we have no fire. lt is hard to say but our situation is hopelesss. lf nothing happens we're going to starve. Sarcasm. Somebody thinks he is going to die and winds up his clock very carefully. That's silly. lt's a bad habit. lt still has got Richmond time. Don't change it! lt could proove valuable some day. Mine is probably still in my pocket. But l bet it doesn't work anymore. Just as l said. - Right now it is not so important to know the right time anyway. Would you borrow me your clock Mr. Spilett? Of course. May l open you some shells? l really like shells. But only boiled. Do you have matches? - No Pencroff. - A lighter? - No Pencroff! - And still you are going to make fire? Yes Pencroff. But why do you need clocks for starting a fire? But of course you need clocks! Can l help you Mr. Smith? No thank you Harbert. l'm my old self again. - Well since Mr. Smith doesn't need our help we could as well look for something to eat. We'll find something. l think l will go with the others. Have good sport. Well then good bye. Good bye. Hope is something wonderful. lt replaces a princely meal. We'll start up there. l have crossed the seven seas! l have been cast away two times! But starting a fire with a clock? Mr. Smith can do it. The damn jungle! Are these thorns poisonous? No. lt's just acace roots. Over there! What a feast! But how are we going to catch them? l've got an idea. Come! That'll work. Try to get some worms. Worms? - Yes. Do you want to bait them like fish? Something like that. Quiet! We've got them in a second! l've already attached the hooks. The hooks are made of thorns. We just have to put on the bait. Nab! What is that? Salt? - No. Salt tastes differently. Mr. Smith will know what it is. Hooray we've got them! Top stop it! That was a masterpiece! That's going to be a feast! Look! Well done! Look over there! Let me tell you something Harbert: Mr. Smith is a genious. The luck seems to be turning. lf it stays like that we can make it for quite some time. Even without pipe and tobacco. Yes. As long as we can find something to eat. That's the department of Mr. Smith. l'm neither a hunter nor a fisherman. And l haven't got a clue of botany. - Whoever can make a fire with 2 clocks and water can do anything! But that's simple. You simply take two glasses and water to form a convex lens. That's an amusing physician joke. Harbert has probably learned that already in school. Of course Sir but l didn't think of it. And l wouldn't have thought to catch ducks with fishhooks. On the ship we used to catch mermaids. Hold it. - But still. l'm convinced that sooner or later we will get out of this situation. Each one of us has its special talent which will help us to survive. As far as l am concerned l must say that all of my talents are useless here. All l can is to waste 300 words on a story which isn't worth 3. There you have it: there are always situations where the reporter is inferior to a scientist or a craftsman. - That's not true. l still remember your travelogues about the indians. You are the only one who has got what we need: personal experience with the primitive life. And that's priceless. But ''primitive'' is a relative term. Of course l know how they make bow and arrow but don't forget the indians were way better off than we are. They had tools we don't even have a knife. - l used to work at a blacksmiths. lf l had iron ore l could make one. But we do have iron! Top's collar! Good Top! Give us your collar. That'll be a good knife. Actually l have never thought about it. But a knife is a useful thing. You can built a new world with it. What are you doing Mr. Smith? That's Pencroff's hankerchief. l have torn it apart and soak it in sulfur. By the way: what Spilett found was saltpeter. When it has dried it makes a real good firestarter. That means we will have fire at any time. And if you put little sticks in it you even got matches. But what if we run out of sulfur? We've got sulfur for the next 100000 years. Hurry up Mr. Spilett. We're waiting for you. Do you still want to find out whether this is an island? - l'm not an expert as you are. l really had to tamper with this little sucker. l forgot to fix the trap. So he ran away with it. l think l need to learn a lot before l become a good trapper. - Stop cheapen yourself! l think everybody does a good job here. A boar has to hang. - Our pantry is filled up. - Let's go. But to be honest l'm missing tobacco. Listen to the song of the Nautilus. lt defies even the worst storms even if it has to dive. Well Nab? What are you thinking Mr. Smith? Wouldn't it be better to let us know? Probably Spilett. l'm asking myself how l could survive. l've been thinking it over and over but l can't find an answer. l wonder if somebody helped me. But that makes it even more mysterious. Mine were the only footprints in the bay. l've been to the same places where Nab was. l'm convinced that he was in that cave but you weren't there at that time. The only explanation would be that l was somewhere in the rocks. Somehow l must have climbed down. Without knowing. - No. Nobody would have survived an impact on the rocks. l know. - But let's assume you survived. Where are your wounds? And your clothes must have been torn apart. Yes of course. l'm completely baffled. That's a pretty steep hill. Yes. Don't lag behind! There! There are those lights l've told you about. What could that be? Perhaps it's just molten lava. lt could reflect the sunlight. But they are moving! Yes l see. But it could be a deception. l admit l have no explanation for that. lt's funny but these lights are always at the back of a mountain. Doesn't it look men-made? We should take a closer look. Just to be on the safe side. There! lsn't that sulfur Mr. Smith? Yes that's sulfur where l made the matches from. The sea is everywhere you look. lt's the first time in my life that it bothers me being in the middle of the ocean. At least it's good to know that nobody can damp our spirits. A big advantage of an empty island. All we have to find out now is where we are. What is that good for? Our lives could depend on it. l know how to do it but l need a sextant for that. No. l don't. But we'll have to wait until the 16th of April. That's one of the 4 days where the subjective matches the objective time. Then we can locate our position. Without sextant and tables. You'll see it's a piece of cake. lf you say so. - But in order to work you must wind up your clock every morning. Of course. By the way it's a wonderful clock. lt is only 1 minute ahead per month. - And l want to take a closer look at those flashing stones. lf you ask me there are more important things. l don't agree to that. l don't know how l was rescued and now those lights. That's too much for me. - For me too Pencroff. That's the reason l want to find out. lf this island happens to be along a ship route it's just a matter of time when they will find us. - lf that would be the case we should have seen buoys. But so far we only know part f the coast. lf this island belongs to several islands there must be others. We would have to build a boat. Sooner or later we will meet people. Depends on who we'll meet. lf we meet Papuas... But Mr. Pencroff not all humans are Papuas. On the opposite. There are a lot of Europeans here. And even more Malaysian pirates. And one of them is worse then 10 Papuas. A boat that's easily said. Built with two knifes of a dog's collar. No l think we'd better build something like a canoe. Just to try. And if we get past the breakers we can build one big enough for all of us. lf the lord has mercy on us. - l think we should build two boats. A bigger and a smaller one. Either we can get off the island or we can use them to explore the island. For my part l like to sleep long. Good night everybody. This is our calendar. We must keep track of time. We must not miss April 16th. That would be a catastrophe. Pass me the counter. What's this going to be? This old gentleman is father time with his scythe. Calendars are always ornamented. That's what l did. Well done Pencroff! We shouldn't forget that art. Not even here. Tell me Smith: Do you know what those reflecting lights are? Do you really want to know? Of course. Me too. l can't sleep anymore. l've got to know it. l think we have other troubles than reflecting stones. My dear Pencroff scientist don't think like you. They'll have to find out. Whether it makes sense or not. That's why they are not so popular. But they can start a fire with 2 clock glasses. Missed another one. The last time they were up there Mr. Spilett. l know exactly that l came from over there. That's where we found you. But Pencroff is right Mr. Spilett. lt's amazing what distances one can travel on this island. What has happened? - The flash struck you. A flash? Yes and the same has probably happened to me. At exactly the same place. lt looked like a ray of light. - From one of those light points. Like a firecracker. That's not possible. l should have been dead! Even half of that would have vaporized me. Deadly flashes out of the blue sky. How would you explain that? Maybe l find an answer to that question. Right now l'm more interested in those light points. l haven't seen something like this before. No one has. That's interesting. What is that? - Well that is highly concentrated iron ore. Very rare like the one you can find in Sweden. Really. Highly concentrated iron ore. Take a look at it Nab. - Do you think we could use it? - Yes. We make iron of it and from the iron tools. - lt's really heavy. But how are we going to get the ore out of the mountain? We have saltpeter sulfur and we can make coal. That gives blackpowder with which we can blow up the mountain. Mr. Spilett we all should be scientists! Maybe. But right now we rediscover the iron-age. lf those darn flashes don't come in our way that is. How many do we have Pencroff? Good we need more charcoal then. Are we trying to make iron or trade charcoal? l don't understand him anymore. l don't understand the difference between the objective and subjective time as well. For me there is only one sun. At the highest point it is noon. But if Mr. Smith has his own opinion... Good that you're here Spilett. Why? l want to show you something. That's where the shadow is shortest. Noon. ... right now it is half past two. What's the time on your clock? Exactly 7:31. Let's say 7:30. That means a time shift of 5 hours. The sun travels 15 per hour this time of the year. Which equates to 75 degrees. And that's the distance between Washington and this island. We know that Washington is located off the zero meridian at Greenwich. Let's say 77 degrees. That means that we are between 150 and 155 longitude west. And what's the lattitude? Wait. Why are you so impatient Pencroff? l'll know it tonight. Provided that l can see the stars. Alpha in the Southern Cross is exactly at its nadir. A knife Nab! The bowstring is no good. Are you ready Harbert? l hope l did everything right. The location depends on the angle of the Polar star and the star Alpha in the Southern Cross. ln our case it's 10 degrees. The angle to the horizon amounts to 27 degrees that means a total of 37 degrees. That means that we are approximately at 37 latitude south. Taking into account that our tools are not very accurate l would say that we are anywhere between 35 to 55 latitude. Simple. lf you know how it works. - lf we are at 35 latitude and 152 longitude where are we then? lf l remember right l would say with a tolerance of about 100 miles we are somewhere between New Zealand and the archipelagic of Pomotu. - l know the sea between Australia and New Zealand by heart. l also know Pomotu and Tahiti. But taking your coordinates there is nothing but water on the nautical charts. Here won't pass a ship in our whole lives. We're going to need a lot of iron to build a seagoing ship in order to get away from here. Why don't we build a balloon? Top! Top! Calm down! He has stopped. Top go on! What do you see? Top! Top come back! Harbert! Where are you going? Harbert be careful! Come back Top! Harbert l've told you to... Harbert come back! Get out there! l can't follow you. The opening is not big enough. Harbert! There's a cave in here! A real house Mr. Spilett! We could live here. lt was a good idea to blast a second entry in the cave. Not even the President of the United States has got a palace like this! l would love to trade this palace... ... with the cabin in Washington. Top's on the scent! l've told Harbert not to go far away. Who knows. Maybe he was after an animal. Come on! l think that he came up here. Take a look. He was here. He must be down there. Careful Pencroff! This steam could be poisonous. Wait! - But he is right. Harbert could be down there! - And that's why we wait here. Maybe we have to help Pencroff. Carbon monoxide. Pencroff get out of there! The steam is highly poisonous! Harbert! Pencroff! Get out! Harbert is not here! What are we doing here? Harbert is probably waiting at home for us. l would really like to believe you. But Top has never lost a trace. He has brought us straight here. Harbert's body must be here! Maybe it was an animal trace Top was following? No. Not Top. What else could it be? - l can't tell you. Look at that! The lights are getting more. You'll see. He's up there sleeping! lf he was attacked by an animal we would have found traces of a fight. l can't explain it. Or an eagle took him? Are there answers to our questions? lt must have something to do with those lights. That's the riddle we have to solve. And we will solve it. Do you think that Harbert is dead? No. l think we should go back to the cave. We haven't slept nor eaten for 3 days. lt has really been 3 days that Harbert disappeared? l'm going to find him. l'll find him. Dead or alive. Even if l have to look under every rock on this island. lt's mad what you are trying to do. You've already said that Nab. Nevertheless l think it's a reasonable possibility. - l don't blame you for trying to get behind the secret of the mysterious lights. All l'm saying is that l think it's much too dangerous. Yes. But it's the only way. Hopefully Mr. Spilett will make you change your mind. You've promised me not to tell him. Yes because it is so dangerous. But you must not keep it to yourself. Besides the others won't let you go. That's why l will have to find an excuse. l'm going to tell them that l need some time for myself. Nobody will refuse me that. Okay but l will come along. No. You won't. Excuse me Sir but l will join you. No you won't. You know that's impossible for the two of us. Come on Pencroff. You must eat something. l've promised his father to bring Harbert save to San Francisco. And now he is dead. We can't even bury him. But what makes you think that Harbert is dead? Never mind Mr. Smith. He is gone for over a week. He must have been wounded or killed far away from the place where his arrow was. Don't you try to make me believe in miracles. l'll look for his body and bury him. - Pencroff believe me... - Believe you what? You don't believe yourself in the things you say. Otherwise you would have joined us today looking for him. lnstead you prefered it to stay here. l apologize Mr. Smith. What you are doing here is invaluable to all of us. Do you really think that Harbert is still alive? The more time passes by... But one thing is for sure: Top has never failed. Suddenly the trace stopped. Quiet Top quiet! Think! Try to remember! l can't remember anything. Doesn't this sound familiar? - l've heard of sailors loosing their memory. But they have been hit on the head. We call it amnesia. But Harbert doesn't have a dent? Except for this scratch at my hand. And this cube. An alloy no doubt. Top seems to be afraid of it. Are we ever going to find out from which mysterious ghost town this cube originates? There are indian tribes who believe that their ancestors were beings with wings. Who came from other worlds and who who let's say performed strange things with them. That's nonsense! That's not as stupid as it sounds Pencroff. Archeologists have found strange objects during an excavation in New England. And there are scientists who believe that those beings could possibly live in unexplored areas of our planet. Maybe on this island? Good night everybody. Do you think something like that could be possible Mr. Smith? You know... in our situation any theses is as good as the other. What do you want to do with the cube Mr. Smith? l'll hide it. Otherwise Top won't let us sleep tonight. What if... the owner tries to get it back? l don't understand Sir. Harbert is back. Why do you still want to carry out your plan? lt makes sense especially now. His reappearing is as mysterious as his disappearing. - But you've said yourself that the loss of memory could explain a lot. And you have said that it is nearly impossible that humans are living on this island. Yes of course. But l also know that the presence of humans would be the simplest explanation for all the mysterious things. The only place we don't know so far is the platform. Please allow me this single time to do what l want. Without logical and scientifical necessity. l cannot rest until l know what is going on up there. Careful Mr. Spilett is coming. Quick! Work something Nab! Don'tjust stand there! Hit it! Did you catch that all by yourself? You're going to be a chief hunter! He already is. Didn't Top join you? Yes but he ran away. lt looked like he was on a scent. - So far we didn't come across a beast of prey or anything else that could harm him. And he's even better when it comes to snakes. l've got to take care of this sheep. Come here! That's a boy! What happened to the Nautilus the ghost of the oceans? She was buried by a wave during a storm. The ship was filled with treasures... Pencroff! - What's the matter? A bottle post! Cast away... Tabor island... Cyrus do you know the position of our island? Yes approximately. l have located the position again and again. That means that the Tabor island is only 50 to 60 miles away. That's quite a distance to swim. Our boat is nearly finished. You've said that the Papuas have traveled greater distances than that. Yes. But they are uncivilized. We could try a trip around the island. But that's about it. lf l had real sails we could of course go to Tabor. lt takes about 10 hours. - But whoever threw this bottle into the sea could already be dead. - The bottle has been in the water for 3 months at the most. How do you know? The shells and the seagrass for example. They are pretty loose. When they get bigger they hold on tight and drag the bottle to the sea floor. That makes sense. The paper isn't wet either. lt could be quite possible that he is still alive. When l come to think of it that a human is at need not far from here... Now! Hurry up! l'm going to work on the stallage. l'll finish it today. Call me when the crabs are done! Pencroff just a second! My dear Pencroff the dull thoughts which have come to our minds because of the bottle post must not make us forget the small happy things in our little community. Gentlemen! Ready? 1. . 2. . 3. . Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear Pencroff happy birthday to you! Friends that's right today l'm turning 53. You forget how normal people live on this island. And you are the one who told them! Thank you my friends! That's not all! Make yourself comfortable. Now you'll get your birthday present. We all would like to give you this pipe. A pipe! But l don't have tobacco? Well it's just a start. l get it! This is one of Spilett's jokes! But today l won't let you spoof me. Up and away! - That was a little hasty Pencroff! - Why? You mean this is... - Take a look inside. Tobacco! You are wonderful! - Harbert has found the leaves and Mr. Smith dried them. l've made the bag and Mr. Spilett the pipe. And l didn't notice a thing! We are living in a house full of secrets. - But the pipe! lt's probably broke! - lt's just a pipe! No need to panic! l've broken the pipe! - Sit down sit down! - Unfortunately they are so fragile l've made several in advance. Wonderful! l finally have a pipe and... You prepare it Harbert! This is wonderful! Thank you so much! Did you know smoking is antiscorbutic? No. Top has got something. Good boy! Come here! lt's okay Top. lsn't that a piece of our balloon? Yes it is. That means we can sail to the other island. Somebody tell me there is no destiny. Do you think that the entire coating is lying around somewhere? Come on Top. Show us the way. He was gruesome and very tricky... ... he was always on guard... ... but no one could threaten him... ... he simply laughed at them. The grave is loneliness... ... who likes to go inside... ... who likes to go inside. Does this song have more verses? Well we won't get bored then. Captain Nemo is allowed to go to the mainland for one night every 7 years. His covenant with the devil is repealed should he happen to find a girl that wants to marry him. But that's the story of the flying dutchman. No. The Nautilus does exist. And she must be driven by the devil himself. She doesn't have sails nor a steam engine. l've learned this song from a Canadian whale hunter who has learned it from the composer. And the composer was a prisoner on board the Nautilus. l think you are telling us fairy tales Pencroff. People are telling crazy things about the Nautilus. Engines which are running by themselves. A hall more pompous than a palace. And in the middle there is an organ. Like in a church. An organ? - Yes. And every time when Captain Nemo has sunk a ship he played eerie music which made your soul shiver. And you could see the ship sinking through big windows and how the sailors were eaten up by sharks. A submarine a ship that can dive. lmpossible! Believe or not. This prisoner on board the Nautilus has traveled under the ice of the southpole. They have fought octopuses bigger than a ship! That is a fact. There also was a French scientist on board. True or not. The story is incredible! We'll ask Mr. Smith what he thinks about it. But scientist are not always right. They are telling you that there are no white whales! But l've seen it with my own eyes! Keep on laughing! Captain Nemo does exist! That's the gospel truth! Why are we going up that mountain instead of sailing with the others to Tabor island? First of all the boat wouldn't carry all of us and secondly it's better if someone stays here. That reminds me that l didn't allow you to come with me. That's right Sir. That's what l thought. Top you stay here on guard! Both of you stay here! l want that you stay here until l return. Mr. Smith! Wait for me! This path hasn't been walked on for years. lt seems to end here. l think it continues behind that big tree. Listen! What? l can hear branches rustling. l should have heard it as well. Did you hear anything Mr. Spilett? No nothing. Pencroff did you hear it now? Yes. ls anybody there? We are friends! We want to help you! - We've found the bottle post you have thrown into the sea! Look here! March 18th 1857. There is something carved in too. lt's still readable. Captain Harry Grant November the 23rd lf the poor guy is still alive he spent l think he is already dead. A bell! From the Brtiannia. That's brass. We'll take it with us. Maybe we'll find other useful things before we return. - But first we'll have to find out if Captain Grant is still alive. l'd say we'll wait until the evening. lf we don't find him by then we'll go. Aye aye Sir. But we'll take the bell and the old rifle. Look the path continues over there! Why do you have such a device? - l have built it after yours. - You are a son of a gun. But who knows if it works. lt's working it's working! You can't harm us! Try it! Try it! We are invincible! l think that's it. We should be in our boat before night breaks. lf you say so. But l wouldn't mind a small nap. Hey where are your arrows Harbert? l must have left them where we stopped. Wait Harbert we're coming with you. What for? lt's just a few steps. No! Help! Harbert! What happened? The cast away. He's somewhere over there. He fled. Captain Grant! He didn't take a minute to gnaw off the bone. All these years alone on an island. That can turn a human into a wild animal. We must have been mistaken Sir. - No. Somebody tried to attack us and gave up. But that would mean that humans live here. They have tried to kill us. But thanks to your lightning rod... You are making a mistake. Why should they live here? They live down there. At this place was a light. Exactly in front of us. And this light has only one direction to hide. Down in the rocks. But that's not possible Sir! Only god can send flashes. Only god. Even with the knowledge science has aquired over the past... not one human would survive those lightnings. And this is a very pitiable finding. There is on live at all. Do you see that? A trace! lt looks like the trace of an animal. Or from a human. Could be. Sir! l think something is moving! Where? Where? There are humans. He's got leprosy. No. Doesn't look like it. He's alive. But his heart is weak. We'll take him with us Sir. Of course. We're lucky that the roof has got holes. The vines can drop in any time. They'll be burnt if l don't take them off the fire. - l just hope that Captain Grant is not as picky as we are. He's still there. He's hungry. He'll come. Don't step in the trap! Pencroff stop it. Gotcha! Captain we are friends. We just want to help you. Help me Harbert! The wind brings us right back to our island. Take a look above. What do you mean? - The small black ribbon at the horizon will get bigger and bigger. But is it that bad? l'm afraid yes. And we can't go back as well. What can we do? Hoping that our boat won't break apart. Do you still believe that they'll come after their man? l hope so. Without help we won't ever get away from this island. That's what we needed. A storm. Luckily Pencroff is a good sailor. You don't need to worry. Of course not. l think he is dead Sir. What do you think how long will this storm last? lt's just starting! Captain Grant! What are you doing? Spilett! Are you mad? lf we capsize he's going to be shark bait! lf we capsize we all are going to be shark bait! Don't worry about me! Bail water out of the boat! Take care of yourselves! Thank you Captain! Some day somebody will land here and stand in front of our graves. Unless somebody is still alive. Have you any idea how far we have drifted? - We are shortly before hell! There's nothing going to save us! Pencroff a fire! That was the best idea Mr. Smith ever had! Spilett we've been sailing like the flying Dutchman! Do you think we can still make it Pencroff? - For sure Sir! Don't forget: you've got Pencroff as your helmsman! We've made it! Catch me again! Welcome home! Grant! Where are you going? We are friends! Captain Grant! l'll never forget that lesson! - We were worried about you. - lt probably wasn't a joyride. No l've spent more joyful nights. - lf you didn't light the fire on top of the cliff who knows where we would be now. Fire? What fire? On top of the cliff! We didn't start a fire. But we have seen it! We have seen it from far away. What is that supposed to mean? We are not alone. The light came from here. Here is a lamp. Come on Top. Get him! Search him! Search! He's got to be here somewhere. Why do you stop? We'll get him! No! This man saved our lives. That's what l've been thinking. We're leaving Sir! Don't be afraid! Can you tell us how we get away of this island? Alright he saved our lives. But people who hide in the underground of an island there must be something wrong! - One thing is for sure. There must be more people on this island than we think. You need a lot of people to run these machines. And there is this mad man we've brought along. - l think that Captain Grant will going to be reasonable. Remember what he went through! - l do remember. But nevertheless l will pull up the ladder at night. We'll let him rest. l think we go to bed as well. Shouldn't somebody keep watch? - Yes. l don't want that he escapes prior to talking to him. He's not going to escape. And his friends won't be able to get him once l've pulled up the ladder. l'll take the first shift. With a good pipe. Good. l'll take second shift. And l'll take third. And when is my turn? You're going to bed. But... - Harbert! You'll sleep! When it's stormy and ships are sinking... ... it's time for Nemo's Nautilus to look for booties. Sirens are whispering... ... who is he going to catch? Who is he going to catch? He was gruesome and full of tricks... ... he was always on guard... ... but no one could threaten him he simply laughed at them. The grave is the loneliness... ... who wants to go inside? Pencroff! - Yes? Who wants to go inside? Mr. Smith! - Yes Spilett? Something is swimming in the water. l've just discovered it. lt's drifting towards the beach. - What do you think it is? - l don't know. Let's take a look. Nab you'll stay in the cave and keep watch at our friend. Yes Sir. Come along Top. You'll rather stay with me. Hey Pencroff! That should be a piece of cake to get this thing out. That's probably from a ship which got caught in the storm. Ships must be passing here! Harbert! Come over here! That's not possible that flotsam will drift that fast to the beach. Especially notjust one single piece. Besides they must have had a lot of time to build such a box. Swim over there and hold on tight. Quiet! Pull! Quiet! Good boy. You're a good boy. Don't run away! We won't harm you! Come back! Pretty heavy. What would you say Pencroff if the box was filled with gold? Mr. Smith would know what we could do with it. Doesn't look like it was in the water for long. - Yes l agree. Otherwise there were traces of shells and accretion. lt looks like it was packed yesterday. Maybe there was a ship that sunk during the storm. . l don't want to harm you! Don'tjump! That'll be your death! Mr. Smith! The man has killed himself! What? How could that happen? He jumped into the water lode. l ran after him. He didn't surface. But the water lode leads to the sea. Yes and the ebb-tide will drag him on to the sea. Don't worry Nab. He didn't kill himself. He escaped. The most sophisticated l have seen. A pair of binoculars. A compass. Here! A small compass... ... several nautical charts ... and 3 sheets of ship construction plans. Everything is there. Everything we need to build a boat and get away. Whoever packed this box was a farsighted man. Would you be so kind and put down the rifle Pencroff? l know it's not loaded. But it makes me nervous. Once you've got something like this in your hands you are a hero. The greatest men in history never had a gun in their hands. They didn't have to cope with Papuas or Malaysian pirates. Well what do you think of all this Gideon? - l've got the notion that the owner of this island wants to get rid of us. - Do you think the people who were shooting those flashes have sent us this box? l'm convinced about that. Where ever it comes from. lt's heaven sent! Come on Harbert. We've got work to do. lt's as sharp as a razorblade. May l? l think he's becoming reasonable. He's eating the food Harbert has given to him. lt's not going to take long and he will put on the clothes we've given to him. He's coming! No don't react! l would like to talk to you. Come over here! How long am l on this island? About 1 and a half months. We've found your message in that bottle. So we went to the Tabor island and picked you up. Message in a bottle? l have never thrown a bottle into the sea. Are you sure? l don't know. l can't remember. l have never had a bottle. l have lived like an animal. Like a wild animal. For years. You wanted to talk to us. Talk to you? Yes. l wanted to tell you who l am. We know who you are. You are Captain Grant. No l'm not Captain Grant. l am not Captain Grant! His children wanted to know what happened to her father. He was on the Duncan under the command of Lord Glenawan and he told me: Ayrton that's my name do you know where Grant's ship has sunk? And l said yes. He hired me to show him the way. But this was simply a mere pretence. ln reality l am Ben Joyce. l have never said that l was Captain Grant! l am the infamous Ben Joyce! l have never heard that name before. Why should we know you? Enlighten us! l am Ben Joyce! You should be afraid of my name! Ben Joyce! l have no idea who this Ben Joyce is supposed to be. But l won't leave the cave without my rifle anymore. Strange guy. - What a day! l'm going to sleep. But dinner's ready Mr. Spilett. lf we built the body higher we will have much more space. Do we really need such a big ship Pencroff? We may have to go several thousand miles. That's right. We must have enough space for the provisions. But it's all gone! My tobacco too! A rifle is missing as well! All weapons were complete this morning. Maybe it was the others? After they have given them to us? They've got more than enough! They wouldn't steel my pipe and my tobacco. - And what about the ammunition? - Who knows? Nobody counted it. This mad man! lt was him! l'm going to pull up the ladder! That won't help. He climbs like a monkey! But Harbert! That's what l'm trying to explain. He didn't steel the rifle for hunting! But why is only one rifle missing? Who knows what's going on in his head. Besides we have caught him like a wild animal. Maybe he was happy on this island? That would be possible. And if that's the case he's got any reason to believe that we are his enemies. Gentlemen! Don't go! lt could be a trap! l'll find out. Just a second Cyrus! l'll go. Without you and Pencroff the boat cannot be build. Gentlemen! Please! l want to talk to you! Go on! Come over here! Come on Ayrton! l'm not Ayrton. l'm Ben Joyce. Alright Ben Joyce. Sit down. Sit! Go ahead Ben Joyce! l'm not Ben Joyce. - Make up your mind! Ben Joyce was the leader of some prisoners who managed to escape. He was infamous because of his cruelty. l wanted to take over the Duncan and make a pirate ship of it. l held the children of Captain Grant as hostages. But they found Captain Grant at Tabor island. And since they knew my plan... ... they left me behind on this island. Lord Glenawan said l should be hung. But he also said: Ayrton l will give you one last chance. ln the human society you've become an animal. You must try to become a human being again. ln the presence of wild animals. And then he said: One day l'll return. And if you are worth it l will take you back to civilization. That was... March the 18th 1857. l think l am a human being again. - But what about the rifle? - And my pipe and tobacco? l don't understand. What are you talking about? We have been stolen a rifle and Mr. Pencroff's tobacco and his pipe. You are the only one who could have done it. You'll give us back those things - escpecially the rifle - and the case is dismissed. Otherwise taking into account your dark past we are forced to take precautions. l didn't steel anything! - That's a lie! - No that's the truth! - We'll have to arrest you. - No! l swear l did not steal anything! No! Are you surprised Top? Come here good boy. Gentlemen l think we must apologize to Ayrton. Oh no Jupiter! Give me back my pipe! Pencroff! What's the matter? Come over here for a second. lnstead of imitating me you should be taking Mr. Smith as your idol! You could learn a lot from him. You are a cheeky monkey. - You can't do anything against it. He thinks that you are his father. Ahoy! A ship! A ship ahead! A ship! Over here! Ayrton! ls that the Duncan? No the Duncan is a steamboat. The rifles! Get the rifles! We're going to shoot a salute! He's mad! What's wrong with you? Pull down the sails! What are they doing? They've set up a flag. What's the matter with you Finch? What's this shooting all about? There are white men on the island. And they are armed. White men? How many? Yes cast aways. There must be more judging by the ship they build. All we wanted was an island where we can hide and now this. Enough! l want to talk to the carpenter. Get the carpenter up here. Coming. How much ammunition have we got left Spilett? Nearly none. l'll take a look in the cave. No Pencroff! They'll shoot you! Captain! Over there! Fire! That's no use. We won't get them that way. How long do you need that nobody recognizes the ship? About 15 days. Do you think you could do that? l'm very fast. Different paint another mast 15 days. Where are we going to stay for 15 days? That's none of your concern. We'll take the rowboat. - But Captain. We are a pretty good target on that boat. We won't come as pirates but as friends. Get me a white flag. They push off a boat. The boat is ready Captain. Good. This time you better watch it! - Don't worry Captain. Whatever happens. No one will be left. Take off! Tell me Ayrton. You know the habits of these people. What would they do if we shot at them? They would slaughter us. Anybody who has seen them must not survive. We could testify against them. Do you know the man who holds the flag? That's Bob Harvey. Don't Ayrton! That's a personal matter Mr. Smith! There'll be no shooting! As you say. But you're going to regret that. And the rest of us too. We are not armed. We are coming as friends! We are not armed! We are coming as friends! We are not armed! We are coming as friends! You can trust us! Alright. You've asked for it! Fire! Come on boys! Kill them! The cliff! Fire! Our cave! Get your head down! We're running out of ammunition. - We've got some more in the cave. l'm going to get it. Or we're finished. Harbert Nab and Pencroff! Try to get them from the side. Ready? Now! We're coming later on. They are trying to escape! Get them! Get in the boat! Hurry up! Home sweet home! We're out of water. - Doesn't matter. There are enough wells in the forest. Why don't we stay here? That's a fortress! Or a death trap. One of them at each entrance and we're stuck. All they have to do is to wait until we starve. We'll take the arrows with us. They kill silently. Why don't we ask the strangers for help? How do you want to get in touch with them? - l'm afraid Harbert but we've got to make that without them. Besides we don't know if they would help us. This way! - Move it! The coast seems to be clear. There must be some black powder in the cave. l'll take a look! No. Take this. l'll take care of that. Now we are trapped. l'm going to pay you back! We shouldn't stay here. We have no chance in here. Do you hear that? They are climbing the cliff. Go on! Nice to meet you. Finch how is it? They are trapped in the hole. Let's go. Don't shoot! Come on friends! lt was a misunderstanding! You've got my word! l know what your word is worth. l don't believe it! Somebody knows me for over 10 years! lt really is a small world. Are you Ben Joyce? Answer me! lf it is you Ben Joyce then come out there! We are the best friends! l'll give you a cut from the bounty! lt's over with Ben Joyce! l'm not a pirate anymore and l'm going to finish you! Alright. lf it really is Ben Joyce then without me Captain. And what about you Garcia? l am offering you 25. - For what? To spend the rest of my life with remorses? l've thought it over. l'm in no hurry. lt's not going to take long and you and your friends will come crawling to me whining for some water. You are going to regret that Ben! What's the matter? Nothing. l just wanted to look after you. What are they doing? l don't know. Once in a while l see a shadow. Are you crazy? Harbert come back! No. l'll go and get some help. Harbert! Come back Harbert! l've got him! What happened? Harbert ran away! He wants to get help. Jupiter is hurt. Help me. l want to give you back your cube! l want to give you back your cube! l'm a friend l just want to give it back to you! See they are not mad at us Top. Come we'll look for the entrance. Be a good boy. lt looks like the poor boy is going to die. What do you want? That's it. - Hopefully we will have a chance to tell Harbert that Jupiter has died to save him. Harbert has managed to get through to the others! They are on our side! Maybe it was just an accident? No. Look! Harvey tries to escape! But what if he runs into Harbert?! Quick! l think Bob Harvey has got enough. Possible. But maybe he's only trying to ambush us. We've got to keep close together. - Let's go. That's what their weapons look like. l've assumed something like this but l couldn't believe it. We are already that close they could easily kill us. Why don't they shoot at us? - l think we'll soon find out. - Yes. lt's completely unbelievable that humans are able to control lightning. - And they did well. - l just hope that they are not dead. And Harbert too. Over here Sir! lt looks like a vulcanic grotto. The roof came down because of the volcanic eruption. There's a path over there. Maybe it leads to our mysterious saviors. Music! Do you hear it? Yes. A woman is singing. And there's a light over there. That's where they live. But the music? What does it mean? What do they sing? lt's italian. Quiet. Let me listen! How did you get in here? - Please excuse our intrusion. But we're looking for Harbert. - lf Top is here... - Harbert is well. But please answer my question. We've discovered a secret passage. - l think one of the pirates is still alive. - Yes. Bob Harvey. lf you were able to get here he will do as well. Don't move or l'll shoot! What's the matter with you Pencroff? - Wait a minute. These are the big underwater windows. The organ! Exactly like in the song. We are on board the Nautilus and this is Captain Nemo! That is correct. And you are a pirate! A bandit! That's said in the song! Put down your rifle Pencroff! Do l have to remind you that Captain Nemo has saved our lives? But didn't you notice that he has alarmed his men? There they are. What did you tell him? l have sent him to the bridge to keep watch. l have put a deadly protective barrier around the Nautilus. But most of it has been destroyed. And l have to save energy. Pencroff! - l don't believe a word you say! You have sent him to get your crew. This one is my entire crew Pencroff. Five men were left. Three died when they blew up the pirate ship. The one who was with me at the beach bleeded to death. When l arrived at this island 10 years ago my crew consisted of 30 men. Most of them died at the volcanic eruption six years ago. The others one of which you have found Mr. Smith became victims of an apidemic. Where is Harbert? Come with me. Harbert! Don't worry he's just sleeping. He has drunk the drink of oblivion. But since you are all here he should wake up. Turn him up Pencroff. The drink of oblivion. Now l understand. But it's unbelievable! - You drank it as well Mr. Smith when we have rescued you. - l apologize for my behaviour. lt was all the fault of this stupid canadian sailor. - Mr. Pencroff. Ned Land was a good man. A bit simple minded though. - Does it mean that the author of this masterpiece served on board your ship? - Yes. And l was relieved when l heard that he survived his escape with Prof. Aronnax and his servant Conseil. Did you hear me singing? Often enough Pencroff. Give him some time. ln a few minutes he will wake up. l have never seen anything like this before. - Neither have l. And it really runs? - The top speed under water is 50 knots. That's unbelievable! - What kind of engine does it have? And what are those machines on the hill? l'd like to keep some secrets to myself. There you have it Pencroff. There is no devil involved! - You laughed at me. But see for yourself. The Nautilus exists! - l imagine that the crew of such a ship is quite different of the one we know. l have trained the officers myself. They were present when the ship was built. Of the Nautilus. And now l am the only one who can manoeuver it. You will understand that l cannot leave the ship until l know exactly what happened to Bob Harvey. Maybe even one of his accomplices is still alive. Therefore l would like to ask a favour of you: The first eruption has torn open a gap in the rocks which could only be closed due to the braveness of my men. Had they failed this island wouldn't exist anymore. lt is of utmost importance to find out if the recent eruption didn't have the same effect. Mr. Smith and you Nab... ... would you put on this diver's suit? That sounds promising. Would you please help me Pencroff? Do you want to send us to the sea floor? - lt's not dangerous Nab. You won't be very deep. Come on Nab put it on! l'd really like to go along Sir. Right now we don't have the time Mr. Spilett. l need you for something else. What is this case for? This is a rescue device which we use when we are hunting dangerous animals. Drink this Harbert. Did you use it to rescue Mr. Smith? Yes. but the sea floor here is harmless. l beg you pardon but could you explain to me how this weapon works? - lt is highly compressed air which makes it dangerous under water and on the surface. Our aqua lungs work the same way. - But how do you do that? Water has got a higher density than air. About 850 times as much right Captain? He's going to school in Boston. l don't need high penetrating power. The arrows head carry a poisonous liquid which causes catalepsis. lt was this kind of projectile that exploded on Harbert's hand when he fell in the cave. Catelepsis reduces the metabolism. This way we could save him from death. l owe you a lot. Excellent. Help me please. Please open that lock. The helmets. You can close the lock now. They have already adapted to the water pressure. l have acquired this devices several years ago in Triest. l have developed his idea. Now it even shows moving pictures. Like the singer when we arrived. Yes. And other things. l would like to show you a few pictures. Maybe some day you will write about it? All l ask of you is to write an objective article about my real life. l have always tried that. Nemo is not my real name. l have adopted it when l saved the lives of this Frenchman and his servant and this canadian sailor. l am Prince Dakkar. A Hindu. My father was the Raja of Bundelkunth. When l was 10 he sent me for education to Europe. Hoping that l would fight some day the oppressors of my country. l've met the most famous scientist and was almost as smart as they were. When my father died l ascend the throne. l have admired your civilization. Without loosing my mentality. l have dreamed of a peaceful side by side of our cultures. But soon l've had to learn that our invasors had no interest in that. They wanted to dominate us. And therfore we had to dispel them. lt was the beginning of the Si - Poi rebellion. l have fought in first line. My wife and my daughter were murdered. l was seeking revenge. Driven by despair full of hatred of human beings l've started to build the Nautilus at a secret place. Years before l've worked out the plans. The Nautilus should become a symbol of the human mind and a symbol of piece. But then l've made it the most dangerous weapon of the new age. Our rebellion was overpowered before l could finish my work. l fled to the sea floor. l was hoping to find my peace. But then a subterranean current brought us to this island. The eruption has broken the iron clamps with which you have sealed the gap in the earth. Then everything is lost. The gap will become bigger and bigger the water will penetrate the volcano and the island is going to explode. Leave the island. A raft is build quickly. - But Captain we have the Nautilus! We could be in Tahiti in less than a week. Why don't we go together? - The exit of this cavern has been slopped during the volcanic eruption 6 years ago. Part of my men were killed due to this landslide. Mr. Smith could blow up the exit. - Even if Mr. Smith would be making black powder for a hundred years it wouldn't be enough. l wouldn't make black powder but nitroglycerin. You have got the machines and the necessary material is easily found on the island. All l need is two weeks. That's too long. - Why don't we split: two are building the raft and the others help Mr. Smith. The Nautilus won't ever leave this island. - But Captain Nemo... - Don't you understand? lt was a war which has brought you here. What do you think what your fellow countrymen will do if they get a hold of the Nautilus? And the eletrical waepons on the mountain? Do you think they would put those weapons in a museum? ls that the reason why you are hiding? l didn't want that you die. But l also didn't want to reveal my secrets. But there is more: We have found some unknown rocks on this island. Which radiates some sort of rays like a lamp emits light. But they are invisible. l've discovered them when l put a stone besides a photographic plate. Does the cube contain the same material? Yes. l didn't notice that it was missing. l use it as some sort of key. lts rays are recepted from sensitive receivers. You can control devices and open doors over a great distance. But that's another secret which must not be published. Why not? l didn't realize that those rays have been the reason for the death of my men. And it'll be the reason for my death. Are you serious? Enough of that! We'll arrest him. You can manoeuver the ship Mr. Smith as well! Somebody has entered the ship. Stay where you are! The Nautilus is booby trapped. Hands up! Step over to the wall. One false move and you are dead! You have destroyed my ship. But yours' much better! Order to leave right away! l'm in a hurry! lt's impossible. l have nothing to loose. Neither have l. Stop! He is shot in the stomach. He's going to die painfully. Our conversation has come to an end. Perhaps it is better that way. Harbert open the crystal closet. Take the bottle with the red liquid. Put a few drops in a cup. And give it to me. - You shouldn't drink Captain Nemo! ltjust makes it more painful. No. lt will ease the pain. lt's an extract of certain water plants. The sea is wonderful Harbert. lt is an own universe. You are never alone there. Wherever you look you see a vibrant life. Only the sea gives you a supernatural extraordinary life. The sea is movement and love. lt is the infinite in the finite. ln the sea there is no domination. My soul will find freedom and peace only here. The volcano erupts again. The island and l will pass away. The Nautilus will be my grave. This my dear friends is where l will rest in peace. ln the deep sea. You must leave now. Each second makes it more dangerous. Nobody can help me. Go! Farewell Captain Nemo. Farewell. Live long and prosper. l think they will rescue us. They have seen us! They change course! They are heading right at us! - That's the Duncan! - What's the matter Spilett? This is where our adventure ends. We're going back to civilization.
