Let God, who has enlightened every heart teach you to know your sins and trust in his mercy. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been one day since my last confession. What sins troubles you so much that you must return after one day? Just business as usual at our monastery. The nuns carried the dope. Our cousin priests were counting the money. I just did not know that death was about to make an appeareance in this house of God. Stranger killed the priest? Patience, padre, I'm getting to the good part. The stranger leaned in and whispered into his ear. This must have put the fear of God into him, because all he could say was, Carlitos. And that's all the stranger needed to hear. The stranger pushed the priest into his chair.. ..turned and walked away. But the priest had one more hail near the officery He reached for a gun... Bang ! Bang, Bang ! - Priest killed the stranger? - No. Stranger killed the priest? What happened to the priest? Four shots. Forehead ... sternum ... shoulder ... shoulder. Sign of the Cross.

Ther's a goddamned vigilante running around wacking priests... ...and all they can tell me is they'll take care of it? Take care of it how? like they took care of Father Bernardo? Where is the world coming to when a man of the clerck can't even do God's work? It's a God dammned shame. Bernardo was a good earner. May God have mercy on his soul. - Hello. How are you? - There's something wrong. You can look at it, please? - What a shit hole! - Penny, watch your mouth !. - But it is. - Come here. What? - That's for the attitude, young missy. - Dad! I can fit my finger in your radiator. It's rusted. Hey man, let's take a little bit of this. They won't miss it. That's how people get killed. Just kidding, anyway. I'm going to see what guys doin. You do that. Just miss my friends, you know. I could be on the beach, at the ocean ... - Look at all you ... - Dude! What?

But ... we do have a problem when people come to our establishment and they dont want to pay respect. I do pay respect. Do I look a puta? - No! - You called me puta, no? Are you trying to pay me with puta money? Want to see the puta? Here she is. Show him a puta guys. You good, took it... with courage. Be a man. Go ahead and save her from the bankin. I'll stop. I promise. Come on, you can do it. Go! Be a man. Go! Save her! Hello. I'm sorry about your daddy. I think I'll have to be play the role of Papa. You're cute. - Chavo on the phone. - Who? - It's him. - Damn! What does he want? He wants to talk to you. - How does he sound? - He sounds serious. I come back for you, Momy. Chavez's repair. You're welcome, we don't give a shit. Father Bernardo is dead. And so are Lobo and Chinaco. It was a godamned massacre. They took nothing. No money, no drugs. It was strictly personal. Fucking. Round up your men and get the word out. Ole Cheffe, we have a surprise for you. Isn't she sweet?You check. Isn't that right Kick Stand? Sure No. - Do you like to pop her cherry? - Yes. But I can't. We have work to do. Muchachos ... We are in the middle of a holy war. In fact, my maman did say to me: "If you want a sweet nice ripe peach, you have to wait a while, fallin under the tree. " I like it ripe and nice and juicy this way. Here Ramon. My papa said: "Acre or sweet, we need to chew." That's what he said. Hey. Chavo? Where are you going? You're talking about my mamma to say and how much about your dirty stinking fucking father? I said nothing. If we talk of mother gonna fly eggs. - Chavo! - Let's not talk about my mother. If anybody else wants to talk about my mama, be prepared to get a few punches. - Rigo! - Yes. - Do you like this one? - Yes. Do you want me to give her to you? - Yes. - Okay. Give her to him. Not now. Go away. Leave me alone. Shit! Hello, Chavo. You done a great job taking care of my place. I am I made you a lot of money. Listen up. There's a vigilante on the streets. going around and killing the bad guys. In case you guys forgot, we are the bad guys. alright. Anybody comes through that door,I want to know about it. Understand? Go! Go! alright alright, I'm on it ! My hat. In witness pleasuring one another in God's house. That kind of blasphemy will not be tolerated in my church. - Fr Carlitos there. And he is scared. - Okay. Why don't we just call the police and let's them take care of it? Jews have called for help. When Moses came down from the mountain, did not ask who is on their side. They responded by taking arms the name of the Lord slay all who oppose the Lord. Spared noone. Are you ready for this? Are you ready going with xxx bleeding and shooting of a short and killing more priests? I am not ready for this. You know what they did to us? you know they will continue to do to all like us. They must be punished, Angelina. be punished on behalf of true believers. Look at me. How am i supposed to be the hand of God, If i can't even hold my own hands still? All I can think is going back at the monastery, in my filthy cell, Where they can stick needles in my arm and I can forget. Mother Magda told me to die. deep die. I was there. When I was in his arms Lord spoke to me. giving me his calling. One, I was agreeing for . One I'll have to prepare for. - What did the Lord say? - It wasn't words. It was intense emotion of being alive one that spoke to me. How did you escape them? Lord sent an angel to guide me back to his kingdom to protect me. - like doing your protecting me now? - Yes. Now that we found each other, We will be whole again. Ther is no easy road to become a nun. It is not a life of refuge from the outside world, It is a life of sacrifice. When times become unbearable, we take comfort in knowing... ...that the sacrifice that we make is the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. When you pass through those doors, you will be born into a new life. You'll enter with nothing and you will be absolved of sins without questions. We do not ask nor do we speak of our past lifes upon entry. To make a closer union with the crucified Lord, You will be submitted to... ... exercises in tasks and humility. If you question this trial, you do not belong with us. To be obedient in all things until death with the love of God. Is to be perfect nun. You want me to take care of it? No. I am in the mood for a good jerk-off story. - I'm on it. - It Could be the priests's killer. The Good Book is all the protection I need. May God who has enlightened every soul.. ..teach you to know your sins and trust in his mercy. Forgive me, Lord, for I'm about to sin. I'm not the Lord, he only works through me. Now tell me what is so heavy on your heart.. ..you must come to confession at this unearthy hour? I'm not here to confess any sins. I'm here to commit them. You must have Balls in steel to come to my house. Do you know who your dealing with? How much money comes through this church? Kiilling a couple of thugs and a priest is not going to stop anything. - You have no idea what you're out against fuck. - Just tell me who you work for. and you won't have to suffer the same fate as your brothers. I work for the Lord. He is my sheperd. Make yourself comfortable. Fuck. Is always the same. Fuck. Passing. There is nothing sacred any more. Dont coverup. It's alright. Its a minute. - I need a room. - By the hour or by the night? - By the night. - That will be 30 dollars, cash. Lucky Room number seven. Halfbreed. These guys, they're yours. - You good? - Yah. How can you get to count everybody's money, including your own? What's your problem? You want to count my money? - I'd like to see them. - Count me. - Count me. - No, that's alright. It's good. Rigo. Go ahead to your business, man. - Chavo's workshop, Rigo. - Get me Chavo on the phone. Now! OK. Ok. - Carlitos, who? - The one bastards killed him in his own church. - He should have prayed harder. - You need to put an end to this, right now. OK. You want us to track down this little eraser its going to be double the regular price. - I don't have that kind of money. - Hey , Padre, don't fuck with me. We've already lost two men in your holy war. In fact, I know Jesus has deep pockets for this kind of shit. If you won't double the pay, Then I won't all this done in half the time. Meet Mother Magda at Carlitos his church. She is expecting you. Carlitos ... It sounds good. This way. You guys stay here and make sure we don't have any unwanted visitors. - What do you think? - I'm dead alright. You can stop them. Make them pay. You know, you're not exactly the forgiving type, Magda. You know, turn the other cheek, love thy enemy ... ..and All the bullshit you preach. Listen, They called me up from my monastery to fix this. And I expect it to be resolved as soon as possible. I heard you the first time,OK ? I know, Iknow you want it fast. You want a miracle. That's your business. But by the looks of things, Your businesss not doing very well. Now. Are here any witnesses? Sister Mary was the first one to alert us of the situation. - Then get her ass in here. - This won't do any good. Sister Marytook a vow of silence 20 years ago. I keep her around just because she knows how to keep a big mouth shut. We'll see about that . Bring her. Who did this? Who killed these men? OK. I am going to ask you one more time nicely. If you do not want to talk, I'm going to let Kick Stand take over the questioning. Who killed these men? OK. It's your choice. I'll be right back. Mary, tell me what you saw now. Mary what did you see? It's alright. You can talk. I won't tell anyone. Just between us. Mary, they are going to come back here.. .. then I can not stop them. What did you see? Kick Stand, get your dick over here. Now! Who killed them, Mary? You know who it was, don't you? You've seen them before,Haven't you? What did they look like? Kick Stand, go to work. I'll nail your arse as they nailed Jesus to the cross. Kick Stand, enough. It was a nun. - It was God's hands. - A nun? It's like one of your penguins is to recoup , Magda. - What kind of gun did she have? - Big guns. I looked into her eyes and saw the devil in them. - What to do now, boss? - First, w're going to handle the troops and then ... we are going nun-hunting . Halfbreed quit fucking around, get up here. We're looking for a nun. A nun with big guns. You mean, "big guns" like in "Big Tits"? I said guns. I'm surrounded by idiots. Pull yourself together, or you'll end up here in a pine box. Spread the rumor on the streets. Fix that. Go check that out. What about her? She is a nun. Yes she is. Are you a killer? No, no, no. Not this one, hey. Ouhh. I don't think she can even hold a gun much less shoot one. Let's go. back for you later. S back errant daughter. When they didn't find your body in Valambrosa I thought even it was you causing all this trouble. And now that you sit before me I know Iknow my words are true. The only thing worse is resting in your arms. I know you would not last a week outside of here. Are you looking for someone? Well, take a good look at him. God punishes those Why I serve Satan. Let me go. - A delivery from Magda. - What should I do with her? I thought w're done with this nun bullshit. Magda said to give her to Chavo and when he is finished with her just throw out the rest of the trash. - Put it in that booth. - Alright. Nice rack. - Hi, Chavo. - Hello, love. Go Tell Beverly to bring me some beer, please. Come with me. Just like I remember heyy. - Dance for me, Mamasicu? - Of course. Come on, come here. Thanks, Beverly. Listen, if you see a crazy chick like that youshoot first and ask questions later That's Chavo's orders. - Halfbreed, would you like a beer? - What the fuck you think, bitch? Yeah.
