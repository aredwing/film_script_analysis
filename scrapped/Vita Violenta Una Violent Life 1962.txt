 

                        A VIOLENT LIFE Tommaso? Anyone home? Can I come in? - Where's Tommaso? - How should I know? Where can I find Tommaso? He went out early. He didn't say where he was going. - Mario, seen Tommaso? - No. He'll be at the dance. ITALIAN COMMUNIST PARTY Tommaso! God damn you! When's he going to move his butt? Cagone, go and get him. It's late! - It's not even four o'clock. - Yeah, sure... it's night time! Get your eyes checked! - So, you're an athlete too? - Idiot. You're disgusting! - Get back in your cage! - Are you any better? Let me see. Guys, take a look at these he-men! Where are they? - Is that a photo of your sister? - If only! She's hot! Fascist swine! Spy! What does that little prick stand for? This guy was a real man. Where's that blockhead Tommaso? Damn fool! Let go! Lello! Wait, I want to come with you. Hold on, the money's coming! Watch your heart! You want to dump me? I've not turned communist. One, two... three, four and five. - Are they all for the Novocine? - Still not got it? Here's the stuff. Give it here, I'll hold it. The rules haven't changed. I'm nothing to do with this. I've never even met you. Everyone looks out for themselves. Okay, "Camerata", but what about the dough? Cough up! I want my tram fare too. What heroes! Our brothers crossed the desert barefoot... That's why I want to go by tram. We've got to do it all by ourselves? Who are those losers? Bye, Augusto. See you tomorrow. Come on, lads. We're "The Californians"! Handling Germans requires different reasoning. Maybe we won't reason. Did he bring up the youngsters, Excellency? They killed the Party Secretary! My God! What'll happen to us? They killed the Party Secretary in Milan! "Camerata" Gaetano... - "Camerati", show yourselves! Present! Down with traitor movies! Ready. Here, drink this. - This wine's good. - What about me? Fill it up. You want me to die of thirst? Lello, I think these "camerati" are still hungry. - Why, only your lot have to eat? - Who was talking to you? I just thought the "Duce" had already eaten for everyone. I had faith in that man. He did what he did for the good of all of us. Didn't they tell you he was a tyrant? At least we've been tyrants, you couldn't manage it. Because we're not bastards like you. Your comrades were bastards. They killed my father and my brother. The less said, the better. You drink your wine and we'll drink ours, and that's the end of it. Here's the wine. I could eat my heart out seeing him out on bail. I'd eat their hearts out. If I had my way, they'd be lined up against the wall. Lello, I'll buy you some wine if you come over to my side. Things were much better before you lot came along! Look at all the stuff Mussolini said he'd do and then actually did it! You betrayed him. I'd resurrect him to spit in your faces! Murderers! I'm on top form tonight, lads. I'd like to pull off a big job. Let's have some fun. Let's go. What about stealing those sacks of flour from Alduccio's bakery? What for? We'd be better off stealing that copper from Magliana. I've got my eye on a tobacconist. How about it? - Okay, let's start with a car. - What's the problem? Let's go, we'll have some fun tonight! - So, where are we going? - To live it up! It just needs a good thump, see? I'm a god! Zucabbo, we've got to give it a go. Let's make a hit, you never know what might happen. Come on, guys! All eyes are on us! "We want to win, so we'll win!" You want to have a go? Lots of dough or straight to jail. - What do you want to do? - Everything. - But where? - The nearest gas station. As long as we get plenty of dough. Even if we don't, it's better than nothing. Let's check this one out. Cut it out, it could be your sister in there. No, my sister works from home. Leave them alone, let them have their fun. "Gertrude", go find a husband! - Good evening. - What do you want? - Can we join in too? - Who are you? He's necking, the dirty bugger! - So? - It's not allowed. You can't do that here. You think you're at home? - Why, are you the vice squad? - No, the death squad. Can't you tell? - Get out. - What do you want? - Get him by the arm. - Let me go! What do you do to women? Hold him like that! What's your name? Come here! Look, I don't kid around! Behave! She's not interested in your looks, she just wants your money! Nice dress! Are you getting confirmed? Let's have a look at you! Come here, you won't be better off in Paris! Stop or I'll shoot! Come to daddy! Make way for Cagone! What a star! She's classy! And what about us? Come on, dance! - Dance for us! - Drive us wild! Aren't we good enough for you? You think you're too good? You'd spit in our faces? Dance! Twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine and thirty. - Thirty thousand and a blonde. - Our little lord had it all. Let's go spend it. No, I feel lucky tonight. I want to have fun! Let's rob a gas station. But don't go running off like you did last night. Good evening. How much? Fill her up and check the oil. Tommaso, check the tyres. - Let go of me! - Get him. Let go of me! Hold his legs! Someone's coming! What do you want? I'm an honest worker! Keep still! Where's the money? - How much is it? - It's bugger all, you sod! We nearly got nabbed for 8,000 liras! Let me go! What do you want? What have I done? - Watch out. - You want to kill me? Where's your money, you swine? - He's got his best outfit on. - Chuck him down there. We're handsome, good and we can move! We nicked this obelisk from the Russians! We can do that because we're powerful! Greetings, glories of Rome. Eternal city, your end has come! You can buy bread anywhere but you must fight tooth and nail for it, in this city of swines and murderers. Why don't you leave and go back to Lungotevere to live it up? Rome, bring me your actresses, I want to have a word in their ears. Ears? No, in their faces! Three thumps on the foreheads of your actresses, there! Lello... You know what I think? That you and I will never starve to death. Of course, I'd eat anything I found. Damn, we're good! We've always lived with what the world gave us. You don't even know why you're in this world. Since I was a kid, I've known the evils of the world. Lello, remember when we were kids, we robbed that idiot who sold pigs of all his money? It was a load of money! And we rented some bikes with our mates and went to the Madonna del Divino Amore. Then we found those two hookers working on the bridge and we paid for everyone. That was fun! Don't you think? Let me sleep! Let's go, it's morning. I'm bushed! Come on, let's walk the rest of the way. Aren't you tired of walking? If you're not happy, take a taxi and bugger off. Wait. What are you rushing for? Let's see what's on today. Look at her! Let's take her with us. Here's the tram, let's go! My darling! Call for help. Just look at this silly pair. - Hi, Celeste. - Hi, Irene. Can I have a kiss, Celeste? They were so cruel to that dog! It's hers, It's Irene's. You felt sorry for it? I don't like seeing the weak get picked on. - But he had mange. - How did he get it? I don't know, my brother walked him all the time. He must've got it from another dog. - I'm off. - You're going? I've got things to do at home. See you later. You can love a dog like it's one of the family. When I was a kid, I had a dog. He grew up and my mom gave it away. I cried that day. And dogs are clever too. They can understand more than people. I know, you're right. If I hadn't come here to Garbatella to see a friend, if I hadn't stopped to look at those kids playing football, and if it weren't for the dog, we wouldn't have met. Why? It's fate. - You know what's on at the movies? - "Hercules". Why don't we go see it? I can't. - Do you work? - No, only at home. There's plenty of work there! So you're a proper lady of the house. Right. - So you won't come tomorrow? - I don't think so. We'll meet at the tram stop and go to the movies. How about it? - It depends. - On what? Listen, you can wait for me at the stop on the corner, tomorrow, around four. If my dad goes out and my friend visits her cousin, I can make up an excuse to my mom and maybe come. I'll wait two hours, as long as you show up. I'll come, if I can. It's late, I have to go. Goodbye. Bye. Hello. I have to go. Bye, Irene. Bye. Shall we go? If my dad sees me... He won't, old guys always go to bars. To have a drink and a game of cards. Yes, but my dad comes to these bars. He's got friends here. Oh. If we meet up, at least we'll get our introductions over with. - Yes... - Yes. - Your friend's very pretty. - Yes, she is. - What's her name? - Diasira. She's got a fianc. Lucky her. With a guy from Tormarancia, but he's not a nice guy. He works for a week then stays home a month. - He doesn't want to work. - Well, what do you expect? Not all girls get lucky. Not nowadays... Handsome, isn't he? He's a great actor. He's a real muscle man. Oh, God! It's not a real story, it's just a film! Right, so Hercules didn't really exist! He may have existed, but when? A thousand years ago! And so? Stop it! Cut it out, Tommaso! - Why? - Because I said so. We're not doing anything wrong. I won't come to the movies with you again! Don't go all serious on me now. If I'd known you were like this, I'd never have come! What's the big deal? We're not doing anything... Keep quiet! Will you be quiet? I want to see the film! Have some manners! Go on, just a little bit... I swear on my mom's life, just a little bit. I want to watch the film! You're so beautiful! I like you, you know that? - You got that? - Yes. Carletto, I need to talk to you. I got myself a pretty girl down in Garbatella A real stunner, top of the range. Tommaso gives it his all, for the woman he loves. Go sing at the bar! Listen, she won't see me now. I don't know why. So we have to serenade her, you're good at that. I've got to impress her. Damn you... - Well? - I have to see. What? My guitar's at the pawn shop and I'm broke. - I need some cash. - How much? - A couple of thousand liras. - Two thousand? Where will you get that? - It's the truth. - What's so funny? Two thousand liras. - Let go of me! - Give me your bag or I'll kill you! - No! Let me go! - Give me your bag or I'll kill you! You swine! My bag! The moon is reflected In the windows of your balcony And you are hiding Behind your curtains I'm here to sing a song To say, "I love you" Look out To listen to my song Madonna, my love At night time If your heart will allow me, I've come To sing you the night song My heart is beating fast You can't imagine how I capture these passionate words in seven notes To make you fall in love But why Won't you look out again? I'm good, aren't I? - Don't stop! - All right. Madonna, my love It's no time to sleep You're the most beautiful of all... This song makes me feel sick. - Angel of paradise! - My scarlet flower! For you, I'd pray night and day! I'd beg to make you queen! She liked it. Look at them! They're serenading that girl! Go for it, "Modugno"! Let's end this night on a happy note. We've got a passion for music. - Play us a nice song. - Sorry, but we're tired. Won't you do us this favour? My friend asked you something. We don't live round the corner, you know. - Let's go. - No way! Don't be such a kid! You're a grown man. Come on, sing him a song. He's got talent, he's got a great voice. You're just going to go? And leave us like this? We're not pilgrims, you know. - Let's go, Carletto. - You're a nasty piece of work! Look who we've ended up with. Yet they look so kind. Look at this guitar. How many hearts have you broken? Damn you! Son of a bitch! I'll smash your head in! You've got no right to damn me! - Run! - Let's go! - Puzzilli, you're coming with us! - What for? - Move it! - I didn't kill anyone! - He'll get a couple of years. - That guy died. Get hold of his legs. Get out of the way, move it! Where are you taking him? Puzzilli, get ready. You'll get you out soon. Puzzilli, it's two hours till dawn. Puzzilli, your time's up! You're restless! You can't wait to get out. I got out loads of times, but here I am. This prison may as well close down. Too bad for the prisoners! They won't see me again. You've just got here and you want to leave? I've been rotting in here for 18 months over something stupid! - Things'll be different now. - Why, are you getting married? Could be, there's someone waiting for me. Didn't you see her letters? I've got a new house too, in a modern eight-storey building. Lady Luck's tired of punishing me! A modern building? So you'll have a bidet too! Of course. You think Puzzilli would live in a dump? Tommaso Puzzilli, come out with all your stuff. I'm coming. Zaraffa, get up. I'm going. You want a farewell party? - I'll send you some lice powder. - No, save it for your sister. Say hello to freedom for me. - Where's Via dei Crispolti? - Via dei Crispolti? Down there. Can you tell me where the third building lot is? Over there. - Who are you looking for? - Puzzilli. First floor, flat number 2, but there's no one there. - No one? - Who are you? Tommaso, their son. Ah, the convict? Wait. Your mother left me the key. What a great place! How did they get this? The priest got it assigned to you. He put in the application. So priests perform miracles too? If they're stupid, then I'm going back to prison. They have no worries, they have fun and enjoy themselves... and they get it on with the girls. Where's the priest? Come in. Can I come in? Come on in. - I'm Tommaso Puzzilli. - Oh, yes. Tommaso. Your mother's told me a lot about you. How can I help you? I have an important matter to discuss. - What's it about? - Well... I don't know where to start. May I? I know, it's a nasty habit. - But it's not a sin, right? - Go ahead. You already know my life story. - First of all, thanks for the house. - Thank the Lord. Yes, but I thank you too. You see, I want to get married. I need your advice. Only you can help me. Tell me what I have to do. - How old are you? - I'm almost twenty. Are you serious about it? You know what it means? Of course. You're young, you could have a nice family. How old is your fiance? When I left her to go to the can, she was eighteen. The "can"? Of course, you were in prison. Do your parents know? Do they object? Yes, two years ago, when her father found us... ...he beat her and that's why I got in trouble. - I'll talk to her parents. - Many thanks. Watch out, her dad's a nasty man. I'll tell him you've changed and that you've got a job. - But I haven't! - I'll find you a job. Tommaso! Mom, why are you crying? Is that how you greet me? I get out of jail and you cry? I'm not the prodigal son! - Don't cry, get my bath ready. - I'll warm some water up. Everything will be different now, you'll see. I've met all the right people who want to help me. Life's looking up now, mom. Tommaso. Irene, I need to talk to you, but I don't know where to start. What about? Seeing you again has made me want to settle down. I used to be a bit reckless. I didn't tell you much because I cared about you. I couldn't tell you I never worked. If I'd told you the truth, I wasn't sure what you'd think. So? I care about you, that's why I want to change. I don't want to be Tommaso anymore. I know you've got good principals. And you've never hurt me. I'm going to speak to your parents. We'll do things properly. If you really care about me... I spoke to the priest about my intention. - About the paperwork? - Yes, it's no big deal. Birth, baptism and confirmation certificates and unmarried status. It costs 1,000 or 2,000 liras. - Any spare change? - I've got nothing. Let's go this way. It's so posh here! People are different here. From the way they dress to the way they blow their noses! - They're different! - These people were born rich. When they have kids, they get called, "daddy", "mommy"... They look after their kids and make them finish their studies. They belong to the Democracy, that's why. They work for their living and everyone respects them. Maybe one day, if we work hard, we'll do well for ourselves too. I know, I'll speak to the priest and join the Democratic Party. That's not a bad idea. Maybe, if you're a member, you might get a job or some help one day. And the Church offers support too. Come on. Let's stop here. - Are you okay? - Yes. Come closer. Don't keep your eyes open! Close them! If you keep your eyes open, you're thinking of someone else. Relax! It's all damp here, I'll get dirty. Why don't we stand up? No, let's stay like this. Wait here. What's wrong with you today? No, Tommaso. Open this, it's getting in the way! No, Tommaso, not like this. Get off. Tommaso, no. Stop! - Tommaso... - I won't do anything... Don't be scared, I won't touch you. I'll get dirty, it's wet here. It's no big deal, you'll get dry. No... not there. I found your weak spot, eh? What's wrong? Are you all right? You're burning up! Your hands are freezing! You've got a fever. Let's go home, or you'll get bronchitis. There's nothing wrong with me! You're the one that's changed, that's why I won't touch you! Me? I haven't changed. This is how I am, remember? No, you can't fool me. You've changed. Why? I lead the same life. The only difference is that I work now. - How did you get your job? - I told you. The nephew of a family I know sells medicines. He spoke to the doctor about me. So you did no favours? Let's go home. I don't know what you've been doing for the past 18 months. You want me to believe that for one year you acted like a saint and didn't talk to anyone? Yes, I've talked to others. I'm a woman. And I hardly knew you. How did I know you'd come back? So you did do something! Well... a guy tried to chat me up. - And you went along with it. - Yes. You're crying? Good. - You got money for the bus? - Yes. You know what I'm like. If I've got something to say, I say it. I don't want to torture myself over you. I can't stand the thought of you cheating on me. When I fall in love, I fall in love properly, not just for a couple of days. I'm telling you because I really care about you, otherwise I'd be happy with what we have. But you know I love you and that I waited for you. - Leave me alone! - You tramp! - Come here! - Let go of my coat! - What a smart jacket! - Going dancing? You filthy tramp! Round we go! You spy! You're going to die! - Leave me alone! - Did you escape from Caracalla? You used to have servants and now you're a beggar! Fish. - Give us your coat! - You swines! - Give me my coat back! - Let's go! - My coat, you swines! - Run! - Give it back! - Get it yourself! Here's your fish. - What are you doing? - Let me try them on! - My coat! My trousers! - Who made these, Schubert? - Burn these too! - Damn you! Watch them burn! My trousers! Give me back my trousers! Why are you crying? The doctors are exaggerating, I'm fine. It lasts from Christmas Day to Boxing Day. I've never had tuberculosis and I never will! What must I do with this? Go to reception and then to register. Well, you may as well go home. Well, goodbye then. Take care. Make sure you tell my mom it's nothing. Don't worry. Just get better and stay out of trouble. - Bye. - Bye, Tommaso. Just look at this place! Everyone's flea-ridden! How will I cope? I'll end up killing someone. - Where's the reception? - At the end of the corridor. Great start! Touch wood. Damn! They'll kill me off too. What are you afraid of? What do you want? Have you been here long? - Six months. - Six? I'm going to break out! They can't stop Puzzilli! You'd be the first, we fight to stay here. You were worse off on the outside. What do you do on the outside? We're sick, no one wants us! You know how much you get to live on? 300 liras a day. What do I care? I don't want charity. I'll go back to thieving. They'll hear us! We have rights too! As soon as we recover, they have to let us work. Things have to change in here. The guy who was in charge here died. He was a real man all right. When he stood up, he stood tall. When he moved, he really moved. One day, he sent back two trucks full of stuff because it wasn't good enough for us. No arguing, off they went! What did he get out of it? What did he get? If only more men were like him! If he hadn't died, he'd have become a MP or a minister. Right, he'd have become the mayor of Rome! Sister, where do I go? This way. Come this way. Here, that's your locker. You have drawers and a cupboard. Give me your form. Attention. Attention, please. We inform all our patients that the corridors must remain empty. It is the duty of our staff to enforce hospital regulations and report any violations. Nurses Cocco and Negri must report immediately to Professor Perrotta. The first lunch serving is suspended. That way. Sit down! Go back, listen to me! We don't want to hurt you, go back. Has everyone gone crazy? They'll be sorry. And I thought I came here to repent... with these idlers! They're worse than drunks. Can't I even eat in peace? Now what do we do? We can't negotiate, but the strike must go on. They're serious, we'll get battered! If any of us dies, they'll get into trouble. Listen, I came here to get better. - Not to play games. - Who's bothering you? - They'll shoot us. - It's not a war, you know! It's the police, run! Look on the terrace. You go up! - Why are you here? - I'm not involved. - What's your name? - Tommaso Puzzilli. - What are you doing? - I'm eating, can't you see? Brigadier, they're here! Come out! Move it, come on! - Come on! - Move it! Come on! Hey, come up here! I can tell you've not done this before. I'll show you how it's done. This way! Go down this way. Walk on all fours or you'll slip. Where did you get your courage? I've been on the run since I was born, I like what I do. As you like. You want to have a revolution, but you can't even climb a roof! Thanks. I'm a good sport. You and you, come here. Take them away. Go. Hold on! What are you doing? - You can't do this! - I didn't do anything! Take these two. - You, come on! - Get out of bed! - What have I done? Let go! - Calm down! Keep your hands off! - He can't be moved. - All right. Puzzilli never left his bed. - Take him. - Yes, sir. - Come on. - What do you want? - I was sleeping! - Come on, move it. - I want to sleep! - Come on, less talk! - Have they gone? - Yes, but with seven of us. They'll go to other hospitals. As long as they don't take Bernardini or Ochetto. Who'll take them their swill? I'm already being watched. Oh, I was forgetting him. Hey, you can go. They're in the cellar, where the coal is stored. What do you want? Didn't you hear me? - Where is it? - I'll give it to you later. - Where's fatso? - The boss called her. These communists should all be shot! Hey, buddy. Your friend wants you. Who wants me? Are you crazy? This has gone on too long, I've had it with you. Look who it is! This is all I could get, they're watching me. They're looking all over for you, you can't stay here long. Are the others still on strike? No, they've all been caught. - Is the garden exit clear? - They're out front. - There's no one at the back. - Really? All right, let's go. This way. Here. What are you doing? Where are you going? You have to stay here and recover. Your time's not up yet. They need you here. You know what? You're right! I have to get better and I want my money. - Goodbye, Puzzilli. Good luck. - Bye. Come visit when you get out. Good luck, don't take any crap. - Take care. - Goodbye. I was rich and I didn't know it. Won't you wait for it to stop raining? What if it doesn't stop? No, I'm going now. Take things easy now. You're well now but still fragile. You could wish me luck instead. - Don't worry. - Goodbye, Puzzilli. You won't be seeing me again. Goodbye. No, Irene. I can't. How about seven o'clock? All right, six-thirty. I have to go to Pietralata. Bye. That's hot! Well, fakirs eat fire! - Hi, Tommaso. - Hi. Good morning. - Hi, Lanzetti. - Hi, Tommaso. Zucabbo, how's it going? How do you think? I'm beating the lads. The good times are over, there's nothing happening now. Right, you're loaded... Look at his smart outfit! I'm completely broke. Can you lend me some cash? What a son of a bitch! Bring me a cappuccino! The holiday's over, it's time you start working. What's so funny? What's there to laugh about? You losers! - Not another power cut! - Did they forget to pay the bill? Why don't we go to the lake? Not me, I'm scared of water. - Where's the lake? - Near Pietralata, there's a flood. They'll turn it into a lido soon where ladies can go swimming. - Maybe we'll get lucky. - With some asshole who can't swim! Wait, Puzzilli wants in on this too! You're late, Noah's set sail! - Jump! - Show us a dive! I'll rescue you! What are you doing? Hurry! Come on, quick! Watch out! It's slippery! I'll show you how to do it. Wait. Let me get my clothes as well. Let me get a blanket at least. Don't go! I should've come with my truck. - Leave that garbage. - No, it's my stuff! - I want to take it. - I'll leave you here, come on! - No, I'm scared! - Come on! No, I'm scared! I'm going to drown! Watch out, there's a hole. Watch out for the barbed wire! Stop it! You'll never do it! Help me! Why did you do that? It'll take my mom a week to iron these rags. Roberto, you're lanky all right! There's no point ironing those rags! Carletto, sing us a song. You know who she was? Miss Japan, that hooker from Monte Sacro. Right, she's married now! She went down the Aniene to the airport! Irene, come here. Hi, Tommaso. You want some punch? No, I don't like it. Do you know this lot? No. Why are you dressed like that? The barman lent me this. Mine got soaked. It's getting late, don't you think? Well, Irene? - See you, guys. - Bye. Goodbye. What a pair of nutcases! Will you walk me home and come up for a while? Yes, I'll tell your dad I'll join the Communist Party like him. Didn't you want to join the Democratic Party? I've changed my mind. I'll have a hard time with you like my mom had with my dad, always sick with worry. We'll never be assigned a house. So you just care about the house? Is that it? Don't you think it's important? I'll sleep anywhere, under a tree. Love isn't about embroidered bed sheets. I'll sleep wherever, even on the tram tracks. - Right, in your state... - Irene, I'm a poor man. - Don't get your hopes up. - You think I don't know? I'm saying this because I love you. Well, we can't live on kisses alone. Let's go home, it's late. You don't get anything free nowadays, you have to kill yourself to survive. Anyway, I don't want to talk about our plans tonight. - Will you come by tomorrow? - Yes, I'll call you. Call me any time, I'll be at home. Take care. Dad, bring me some wine. Maybe I won't get married. I don't want to anymore. Do what you like, only you can decide. There's no point in us both suffering, right? So this is the end of me. Nonsense. Why did you bring fruit? You should've brought flowers. Shut up, I've had enough of you! Why are you crying? If anyone should cry, it's me. You're not dying! Beat it! Who asked you to keep me company? Go outside, it's Sunday! You're not going to say anything? What's there to say? At least say, "Bye, Tommaso". Bye, Tommaso. Mom... - Mom! - What do you want, Tommaso? Nothing, mom... What could I want? Laser S. Film - Rome
