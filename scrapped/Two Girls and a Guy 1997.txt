 

                        You got a problem? Me? No, I ain't got no problem. Take a good look. Does it look like I got a problem? ## Yeah. It looks to me like you got about 350 problems. You better get your eyes checked, 'cause I ain't got no problems. Matter offact, around here, I'm the one that makes the problems. Oh, I'm scared. I'm just standing here checkin' you babes out. Why don't you go down to the supermarket and checkyourselfout first? You're a tough little cookie. I like that. But you know what? A little smack will straighten you right out. How about that? Who's gonna do the smacking... you and what militia? Listen, you stuck-up little bitch... No, you listen, dick face. My boyfriend's gonna be here any second. Lfyou're still here when he comes, you're gonna want to run as fast as you can. Only then it'll be too late. You're such a tiger. I love that. Fuckyou and your pink shirt and your pathetic suit. Hey, asshole! Carol! What are you doing here? I thought you were going to the tanning salon. I am. I am. I was. I wasjust. You were. You are. You just. I wasjust giving these tourists directions. Come on, baby. You know I love you. Directions for tourists, my ass. You think those girls mean anything to me? Goddamn weasel. Fuckin' asshole. Men. Am I right or wrong? - They serve their purpose. - I'm not complaining. I've got the greatest boyfriend in the whole world. But the way I look at it, most guys are like thatjerk than they are like my boyfriend. By the way, my name's Lou. It's short for Louise. My father wanted a boy, so he made everyone call me Lou. The namejust kind ofstuck. What's yours? Carla. Are you kidding? No. My best friend in third grade was named Carla... Carla Naksenhoff. What's your last name? Bennett. - Bennett... great name. Bennett. - It's English. I've been to London before. Twice actually. Once to dance and once with my boyfriend for two days. He was giving a concert. That's why I'm here. My boyfriend lives in this building. Do you got a boyfriend? Sort of. - What does he do? - He's an actor. - Get out! Like mine! - I thought that yours was a musician. - You said he gave a concert in London or something. - Not that kind ofconcert. More like mixed-media. He sings, he dances, he acts, he does stand-up. He's a real entertainer... like Liza Minnelli. - So what do you do? - Design. - Female Calvin Klein, huh? - We're in the same field, but I'm not... You're not nearly as famous. I'm going to be famous one day. I just know it. My boyfriend promised me that as soon as he makes it, he's going to cast me as his costar because we're so good together. But you never know. I may make it first. Then I'll have to cast him as my costar... if I'm in the mood. Just kidding. He's actually really talented. I'm notjust saying that. He has a way with words. He could talkyou into buying a house without a roof. Sounds irresistible. That's what he is. He's irresistible. People cannot resist him. I bet you've seen him on TV. He's had guest spots on NYPD Blue and Homicide. And he did The Garry Shandling Show twice. He was totally hilarious. He's read personally for Barry Levinson and Don Simpson. Simpson was gonna give him a lead in this romantic comedy... that his new production company was gonna do, but then he died and... Are you okay? Blake Allen. Yeah. Th-That's... That's his name. - Who are you? - His girlfriend. I'm his girlfriend. American Airlines, Flight 11. Right. So, you mean that you came here to surprise him too? Oh, my God. Looks like he's gonna get a lot bigger surprise... than either one of us was planning on giving him. Just one minute. I'll buzz you in! # You give your hand to me # # And then you say hello # # And I can hardly speak # # My heart is beating so # # And anyone can tell # # You think you know me well # # Mmm, you don't know me # # No, you don't know the one # # Who dreams ofyou at night # # And longs to kiss your lips # # And longs to hold you tight # # To you I'm just a friend # Welcome home. # That's all I've ever been # # Mmm, you don't know me # "You Don't Know Me" No wonder it's his favorite song. It should be his anthem. Notice anything different? That's where my picture used to be. It still is. It is? When? When you're here. Did he ever tell you this was the first time... he put anyone's picture on his piano besides his mother? Yes. He said it made him feel that I was physically with him. In front of him and inside him at the same time. Maybe we should just wreck his whole fucking apartment right now. I'd ratherwreck him. That's a really good idea. But how? Should we... Should we stab him? Too quick. Asshole. Creep. Scumbag. Did you really love him? Yeah, I did. Did you? I told him I did, and I thought I meant it. Who knows? I felt something. Emotional? More. More? More than I felt for anyone else. Different. Which is what he said. That you were different. That he never experienced real love before he met me. Before me, love was... Just another four-letterword... Beginning with "L." No more significant than "like" or "lust". Then he would shake his head like this. Show how helpless he was in the grips of his overwhelming passion. And when he would go inside you, it was like... Returning home to his sanity, his refuge. Perfect rhythm. Perfect rhythmic harmony. Atomic union or something. The union ofatomic matter. Matter returning to its purest state of unison... after a temporary separation in time and space. ## How do you remember all that? Easily. He said it about a hundred times, as if it were a mantra. ## Did he ever askyou to marry him? No. Why, did he askyou? No. Why do you ask? Just curious. Just trying to understand his twisted mind. I think his thing for me was more sexual. Although he did say he felt romantic towards me. He told you he loved you? Yeah. He would say, "I love you, and you love me"... because he couldn't stand it if he said "I love you" and I didn't say it back. It's crazy. Even now, when I shouldn't care what he said or did, it still It still hurts. I know. It hurts me too. I feel like this is some weird dream I'm gonna wake up from. So do I. How long have you known him? Ten months. What about you? February 15. I don't remember the date, but it was definitely snowing, so it must have been February. And everything started off real slow. Then he got really intense all ofa sudden, and he told me... That he was yours and you were his, and neither one ofyou was ever gonna be with anyone else. That was in March. Yeah. March, right. Because he said it to me at halftime at the NCAA semifinals. Un-fucking-believable. He knew it from the beginning. Knew what? Knew what he wanted? He knew what he was up to. It's not like he knew one of us foryears or months, then met the other one, and his life became more complicated. He decided consciously to take a shot with two girls at the same time. He wanted a girlfriend. He wanted to fill the void. So he figured ifone of us didn't work out, then the other might. What he didn't count on was that both of us would work out. But we did. Until now. When it's gonna be neither. But you don't think he was looking to have two permanently, do you, like those-those what-do-you-call-its? Bigamists? No, no, no. Those ones in Utah. Mormons? Yes. Mormons. Do you think he's a Mormon? He's no Mormon. Well, he sure is a cocksucker. No, I think that was our function. Oh, you did that with him? What? You gave him head? Why? Does that shockyou? No. It'sjust that... You know what he used to tell me? What do I mean, "used to"? He said it on the phone last night. He said he couldn't even get a hard-on for any other girl besides me... no matter how good she was or what she did. And you believed him. I believed him. Isn't that pathetic? I'm as pathetic as that asshole on the street. Would you have believed him? Not "would have". Did. He said the same things to you? Word for word. And that that was why he was being faithful to you. It wasn't that it was a matter ofchoice... It was phallic incapacity. He knew he would be impotent with anybody except you. Because I owned his dick. It didn't belong to him. It was attached to him... But it belonged to me. Huge and hard and thick and long and perpendicular to the earth. Not to the floor, but to the earth, and filled with oceans ofcome. Oceans ofcome. Oh, my God, I am gonna fucking cut it off. I am gonna slice it off, sliver by sliver, with an electric meat slicer. That's what I'm gonna do. That motherfucker. You said it. What? That's what he is... a motherfucker. You think he did it with his mother? Not literally. I just think his relationship with his mother is more complicated than he admits to. Definitely. Who else has framed photographs oftheir mother all over their apartment? The way that he used her. The stories he would tell. Like when he was little. No father around. "Mother and I went to Florida" "Mother and I went to Atlantic City" "Mom and I had this argument over me having a ponytail" Right. And the way that he used herwith us. No, not with me. I never met her. I never met her either. The way that he used her... saying he was spending the night at her house... because she was sick. You don't think she was sick? Who knows? All we knew was not to call because the ringing sound would frighten her. Exactly. Just leave a message on the voice mail ifanything urgent came up. Four nights a week. Those are the nights he must've been with you. No. I was always three. Never four. You must've been four. No, I was three also. Well, do you think there's a third? Or one night ofcruising... recruitment for the future. Can you believe we fell for this? You only suspect it when you're doing it yourself. Interesting. But you weren't fucking around on him, were you? No. No, neither was I, but... but I could have. I had plenty ofchances. Like that guy in the street in the white suit? Oh, much better than him. I know that. I wasjust... I was being facetious. Right. But you must've had a million chances. I mean, you're beautiful, Carla. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. Let me askyou something. Oh, wait. He's here. Okay. # Cum Sancto Spiritu # # In gloria Dei Patris # # Dei Patris Amen # # Cum Sancto Spiritu # # In gloria Dei... # Ooh. # Cum Sancto Spiritu # # In gloria Dei Patri # # Dei Patri Amen # # Cum Sancto Spiritu # # Cum Sancto Spiritu # # Cum Sancto Spiritu # # In gloria Dei Patri # # Dei Patri Amen # Mommy, it's me.

God, you know, I know a lot of- No, actually, I don't know anyone who's made it in the Catskills. What's... What are they paying me? Wow. Yeah, that'll cover the dry cleaning. What about, like, a TV spot or something... I can't even believe we're discussing thisjob. This is ridiculous. It's like you don't know who you're dealing with here. And... Have you been drinking quite a bit again? I'm sor... I'm just kidding. I'm just a little... Hold on.

Huh. What a surprising way to see you. I wasjust... 'Cause... My God, I wasjust thinking, "When am I gonna see her?" And, uh, here you are. How did you get in? Magic. Huh. What did you, uh... Super let you in? You look great. That's, uh... Fuck. Okay. You know what's so great? I mean, I could not have orchestrated this any better. This is a rare opportunity. You get to see how I'm behaving when you're not here. What did I do? I came in. I call you. First thing I do is I tell you I love you, I miss you, I wanna lick you, I can't wait to see you. I get up. I'm inspired. I'm thinking I know I'm gonna see you. I sit down, I... I play, I sing. How the fuck did you get in here? Wow. You've never looked this phenomenal. Did I give you a key? I did, right? Okay. I'm just so happy to see you. I really am. I mean, these two weeks, I'd forgotten... I'd forgotten how beautiful you are. And I missed you. Did you miss me as much as I missed you? How much did you miss me? I missed you pretty madly, like a psychotic. Why do you think I was calling you? I was calling you 40 times a day. I don't know. To check up on me? What? What kind of crazy statement is that? Why do I need to check up on you? To see what I was up to. What would you have been up to? What are you talking about? What would you suspect that I would be up to? Ho. Whoa. This conversation's getting real strange, okay? What's going on? What's going on? Nothing. Nothing? Then why are you using a word like "suspect" with me? Like I would suspect you ofsomething. And you don't? No. Suspect you ofwhat? Anything. No. Nothing. Why? Why would I? That would imply that you'd done something wrong. I don't think you've done anything wrong. You don't think that? No. Why would I? I don't think you've done anything wrong. What you might think is wrong for me, I might think is right, and vice versa. - What are you trying to tell me? - About what? - About you. - Nothing. Did you fuck anybody? - When? - When? - Ever. - Ever? Well, yes. I mean, I seem to recall you and I having shared a little fucking. Making love. Come on. "Making love" Is that what you wanna call it? That's what I call it. That's what it is to me when I'm with you. That's what we've called it together. As opposed to what? As opposed to nothing. What are you driving at? Come on. How many girls did you fuck while you were in L. A? When I was in L.A. That's the last 2 weeks. None. None, 'cause I haven't been with any other women since I was with you. That's the last 10 months. You don't have to say that. I know I don't have to. I'm saying that because it's true. We're not married. You're a free man. You can do whateveryou want. It's okay ifyou have. I don't want to. Do you? No. Well... With anyone, you don't want to? With anyone but you. Okay, whateveryou say. Whatever. Whatever. This has got to be the most bizarre exchange... I've ever experienced in my life. Did you take acid? Did you? Are you... I mean, are you... This is... I... I'm sorry. I'm just trying to figure out some explanation... for this Jekyll and Hyde behavior that you're exhibiting. I'm scared. I don't... My. What's this? This here. Look. What's this? It looks like a broken window and a plant. Yeah, I know. It is a plant and a broken window. The question is, how did the window get broken? It looks like the plant might have done it. Yeah, but I don't think the plantjust came through the window on its own. Did... Did you throw the plant through the window? Did you throw this through the window? Maybe. Maybe? Maybe? Maybe. Have you gone completely and utterly out ofyour mind? I just... Are you glad I came by to surprise you? Yeah. I'd have been gladder ifyou met me at the airport or outside on the street. I can't believe that you just threw this plant through the window. I can't believe you're getting so upset about this window! You're more upset about this window than you are... Than I am about what? Than about your protestations offidelity! They are not protestations. They are outright denials. It's beyond desire. It's beyond choice. It's phallic incapacity. It's an inoperative shaft. Lfyou were to put a gun to my head and say, "Fuck her. She's gorgeous. She needs you. It's easy. No one will know. " I'd say, "Pull it. Pull the trigger. Empty the chamber into my head". Because that's where it's at with me. It's not even my dick anymore. It's attached to me, yeah, but it belongs to you. I'll take it a step further. Not only at this point... because I'm so attached to you... is every other girl on earth not exciting to me in the slightest, every other girl on earth, to me... It's like a salaman... It's like something that came from under a fucking rock! It's disgusting to me. It's like smelling cheese. It's like... It makes me fucking sick. It disgusts me! It's like smelling vomit. Including me? Wow. Whoa. This is a shock. This is a surprise. Surprise. Okay, this is a massive, shattering shock. But as difficult as it's going to be for either ofyou to believe me, there's an absolutely legitimate explanation. What is it? He doesn't have an explanation. Just answer me one question. In what way am I physically disgusting to you? In no way. You just said I was. When? When? Thirty seconds ago! You said every single person except for Carla... was physically disgusting to you! - It was a figure ofspeech. Hyperbole. - Stop lying, you asshole. I'm not lying. You're not lying? - I'm not lying. - Everything you've said to both of us... - for the past 10 months has been a total, utter fucking lie! - Can I say one thing? This is not self-servingjargon or an attempt to give myself an out for the moment. I may have been hiding parts of my life from both ofyou to avoid causing pain. - Fuck you! - I've never said anything to either one of you... - Fuck you! - That I did not wholeheartedly mean. - Fuck you. - Lfyou actually believe what you just said, - it's worse than ifyou don't. - I don't follow that at all. Oh, big surprise. Huge, huge surprise. - You know what shejust meant by that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I understood perfectly what she meant. - Go ahead. Explain it to me. I don't have to tell you anything. You'rejust lucky... you don't have a kitchen knife sticking through your Adam's apple right now! - Carla. Carla, she's- - I preferyou not use my name. - You want me to call you Timmy? - I don't wanna hearyour voice at all right now. Oh, absolutely. Excuse me. I gotta get that. Hi, Mom. Mom. Hi. Uh... Yeah, it was pretty- It was good. I didn't get it, but I got this other... this thing in the Catskills that's gonna be real... Can I call you back in 10 minutes? Thanks. Ten minutes. Okay. Okay, bye. Bye, Ma. So there is a third. Third what? Third girlfriend. That's absurd. You used your mother with me to get free with Carla. You used your mother with Carla to get free with me. Now you're using your mother with both of us to get free... - with whoever it is you plan on going out with tonight. - What? No, you don't understand. No, no, no. Actually, we didn't understand. Now we do understand. We understand everything. Everything except why. It would be better ifyou stopped lying. You were caught. Wait. - Stop. And try to explain. - He can't. - Let him try. - Go ahead. - My mom is... Your mother is your excuse, ifshe even exists. Who knows? You know what this is? Um, this is really, um... - This is horrendous. This is... I'm... I'm devastated by this. - No, you're not. - You'rejust exposed. - What do you have to be devastated about? You didn't find out that someone you trusted had betrayed you. I know, but... I'm just saying... No, you know what? Nothing you say means fucking shit anyways. Because you're a lying, cheating, manipulating motherfucker! You know what I think? That's really abusive. I don't think you understand how it causes me pain to hurt people that I care about. Care about? Yes, care about. I'd like to cause pain to people I hate, but... Care about? What happened to love? I thought you loved me. I really did. And Carla thought you loved her. I did. L... And I do. I really... I do. Me or her? Both ofyou. Both. "Both" is very convenient. "Both" is really convenient. What about only? You said only. Look, I... I... I fucked up here. Horrendously, okay? I was... - You were greedy, and you were selfish. - I was, well, wrong. - A coward. - A greedy, selfish coward. You know what? Um, I'm gonna... And don't - Please stop, like, pursuing me and follow... 'Cause I can't... I can't... 'Cause I think that I understand where you're coming from. And I was there, and I have been straight with you the whole... This whole entire... If this was the forum that would've been appropriate foryou to, you know... If you have to confront me... And yet, at this... I don't think that there's anything for me now to... I can't. I just- I can't. Because ifthis was, uh... No, this isn't, you know? And both ofyou at the same time. And the word... What you just - That wasn't nice. That wasn't right. I was, uh... No way. No, 'cause I know if I... if I... I know what I... I think it's abusive. I don't think- Yeah. I know... I know what I... It'sjust... I gotta... I gotta... I gotta do it, uh, for-for me. For me, you know? It's not like ifthere was, uh, another... 'Cause this wasn't, uh... It's not supposed to have been... This is affecting me. It's mis-misery. This, to me, is misery. Oh, my God! Oh, my... Oh! Oh, my... Oh! Okay. Okay, fine. He's about as dead as we are. Listen, I'm trying to teach a little something here. You fucking... Oh, my God! You fucking asshole! How could you do that? You know what that feels like, you fucker? Pretending like you're dead! That's sadistic! I had a point to make. I had a valid point. I'm not interested in your fucking stupid point! I'm interested in whyyou are such a sick, compulsive liar! You are caught in a sewer of lies and deception, and your response is to lie and deceive! You're right. This is kinda fucked up. But I am an actor, and actors lie. Itjust gets worse and worse. I'm not trying to excuse it. I think I learned something. It's not even a valid point. A lot ofactors don't lie. Just as a lot ofactors who play killers... do not kill people when they are not acting. Not good actors. Name one good actor who doesn't lie. This is beyond belief, even foryou. Okay. Denzel Washington. He doesn't lie. - How do you know that? - Because I just do. - He oozes honesty and integrity. - See? Denzel Washington is a good actor, and a good actor persuades you ofone reality and lives out another. Blake, are you gonna tell me that Denzel Washington isn't the most coolest person around? - I don't know. Do you know Denzel Washington personally? - No. Do you? Yeah. I've seen him around. I've seen him at parties, auditions. Really? You and Denzel Washington. Did you guys audition together? - Yeah. - Like the two ofyou for a big director? I mean, I don't think Denzel fucking Washington auditions, do you? He's a huge, fucking movie star, unlike yourself. I saw him at Gray's Papaya, like, two weeks ago, okay? I think I got a pretty fair indication ofwhat he's like. I'm not even talking about Denzel Washington as an individual. I'm talking generically. I'm talking about the art ofacting. The nature, the life, the experience for me as an actor, okay? Your point is it's okay foryou to lie and lead a double life because you're an actor. I'm saying that the two are connected, okay? If I was a Supreme Courtjustice, you would expect a literal, on-the-nose, literal-minded answer, a straight-ahead answer like that. But as an actor, I think that I'm granted a little leeway. So this makes it our fault. We should knowyou're a liar and double-dealer- Clarence Thompson. Who the fuck is Clarence Thompson? The Supreme Courtjustice who lied about Anita Hill. Duh! - Thomas. - Thomas who? Thomas. Clarence Thomas. Clarence Thomas is... And there's no proofthat he lied about anything. Oh, really? You think that Anita Hill made up the whole coke can-pubic hair thing? Are you intentionally missing my point? That's the feeling I'm getting. No, I am not. You said you're not a Supreme Courtjustice. And I said that Clarence Thompson is exactly the same lying, cheating, pathetic fucking fool as you are! Okay, stop it, both ofyou. You are letting him sidetrack us... from finding out why he is such a liar, which is the only reason I am still here. That's a very, very good point, Carla. Why am I still here? I'm fuckin' outta here. Why would you treat two people that you claim to love with such contempt? It wasn't contempt. That's the last thing it was. It was love. It was love. Fuck you, Blake. I mean fuckyou up and down, in and out, front and rear. Fuck you till you bleed and pus pours out ofyour asshole. You're a lying, mugging, misogynistic, unemployable, short, loft-inheriting, piece-of-shit fraud. And love? You have the audacity to use the word "love"? You don't even know the meaning ofthe word "love". Fuckyou. I'm short now too, huh? I'm, like, 5'10". I'm short... and a fraud. Loft-inheriting. I mean, what, did you want me to sell it when he died? It was supposed to go to me. It's mine. You enjoy it. You lived... What is wrong with you? Why-Why are you doing this? Is this what you want? Is this howyou wanna live the rest ofyour life... just damaging people around you, damaging yourself? Just... Is it? Really? Is it? 'Cause if it is, why don't you just really fucking blow your brains out? Really. Right now. That's not what you wanna do. You should make a commitment to really shape your ass up. Stop bullshitting everyone. Stop deceiving everyone. Stop doing this... And yourselftoo. You should promise me this right now. Like, the real promise. The real deal now, or... All right, I'm gonna... See, I can't even fucking believe you. I can't believe shit that you say. Your word is worth shit. But I'm going to give you a chance, and I think this is really- This is your last, your last chance... to fuckingjust get your shit together. You've gotta get it together. Gotta get it together. You've got to get it together. Got to get it together. Got to get it... # And you give your hand to me # # And then you say # # And I can hardly speak # # My heart is beating so ## Mmm. ## I come in, and-and the second I walk in the door... The-The ground floor, the door's open. And I look in there, and there's - There's a body in there. I don't know. No, it's not them. It's, like, the artist guy, Rex. I don't know if it's him. I don't know if it's... I don't know who it is. I call the police. They come over. And within 25 seconds offinding this body - They call the coroner or whatever. They come upstairs and they're grilling me, these two detectives. That's- Yeah, when you called me. They were, like, relentless, like I did it or something. And then maybe 'cause, like, the time ofdeath ofthe body or something, it was obvious that I couldn't have 'cause I just got back. So they- So then... Stop. You're smoking right now. I can hear it. You want some more? I've had too much already. Pour me a little ofyours. Good. Yeah, I know you're smoking. You don't have to tell... You can't. Yeah, but I know. It's not even like, "I can sometimes" or whatever. Because you have no idea. I'm the one. I tookyou to hospital. That's enough. One more. We'll finish the bottle. Mom? # In gloria Dei Patris Dei Patris # # Amen ## Mmm! Did you throw away the cigarettes? Know what you should do with your hair? Mom, you are destroying your voice. No, I'm serious. What... Why are you talking so loud? That'd be good. Mom, you are... You... You're wrecking your circulation. It's a very elegant look. I'm serious. You're strangling your circulation. Mom, each cigarette is like a nail in your... You just gotta stop. Do you want me to come over there? I'll come over there. What about, um... Do you think that I could ever braid your hair? Lfyou want to, you can. Because I used to like to braid my hair, but now I have short hair. Okay. Okay, well, call me ifyou need me, okay? Okay. I love you. Bye. Wow. Hey, Blake, you wanna braid Carla's hair with me? It could be fun. We could braid her hair. - You want the truth? - No. We want another lie. No, seriously. The truth. The truth, um... The truth is... Look at him. I mean, the very words "the truth is" make him draw a blank. The truth is that I meant everything that I said to each of you... ...at the time I was saying it. - Bullshit. - No, it was new to me. - Oh, it was new to you. The first time I'd ever felt love was simultaneously with both ofyou... for the first time ever in my life... and I was... I was baffled. It was very unnerving to me. It was very unsettling. Pooryou. Poor fucking you. I'm not suggesting sympathy. I think that would be grotesque. I'm just trying to do what I think we all want done here, which is to make sense ofthis fiasco that I've created. So you've made your point. It was confusing and unsettling when you discovered, as you put it, that you were in love with two women at the same time. Yes. And? And it was... it was exciting, ifyou wanna know the truth. It never occurred to me at any point to give up either one ofyou. Because both ofyou made me feel phenomenal when I was with you, and I was under the impression that I was not totally uninspiring to both ofyou. So as long as we didn't know about each other, then it was okay? No, I'm not saying it was okay. I knew that it was wrong. But the rightness of it that I felt gave me a way ofjustifying it, a way ofseeing it the way that I wanted to see it so that I could continue. - You are such a manipulator. - Manipulation? No, it's not manipulation. 'Cause manipulation implies concealment. I'm concealing nothing. - Since when? - Since now. I absolutely thinkyou're lying. You're definitely concealing something. It's too easy. Yeah, it's too fucking easy. - It's too fast. - What am I concealing? You may not even be aware of it. Lying comes like breathing to you. Mom, hi. It's me. Listen, I'm sorry I'm calling back, but yourvoice sounds weird. It's- It's really low. See, why are you talking like that, Mom? 'Cause I'm getting scared. I need to call you right back. If it's the connection, then I can... I'm calling you right back. Hold on. Why is this funny to you? I'm concerned. Hi. Are you sure you're okay? Look, I'm sorry. I just... I just... I just - I don't understand whyyou're... I know, butjust let me... Okay, well, I'm here, and I am worried about you. And I'm gonna... If I don't- Okay. Okay. Sorry. She gets upset if I'm too solicitous. There's something wrong with her though. Her voice... she sounds really strange. Blake, hasn't your mother been sick for, like, 10 months? - I mean... - Mm-hmm. That's what you have been saying, right? Yeah. Lfthere's a real change in her voice, you should call a doctor. I know. I am going to call the doctor. All right. Sorry. Hi. Dr. Cutler, please. Can you tell him Blake Allen called and it's very important he calls me at home? He has the number. Thankyou. What? So will you ever believe anything I say again? I would be pretty stupid to, wouldn't I? Haven't you ever lied to anyone and-and... and known... what it'd done and felt horrible about it... and-and... and known you could never do it again? Known and then not done it or known and then gone ahead and done it anyway? I guess what I'm asking is-is- is can you forgive me? So explain something to me. Did it excite you to know that you were always in danger of being caught? It must have. It excited you. It had to. No. Oh, yes, it did. You were exciting yourself by leading a double life. You were risking disaster. Ofcourse it excited you. If it did, I wasn't aware of it. You were aware. Mmm. Mmm. Yeah. Oh, God. Oh, fuck. Where the fuck are you going? Huh? Ohh! Ohh! Mmm. I have to make a call. What? I have a phone right here. It's private. Why don't you run after her? She doesn't want me to. But you would ifshe did. It's okay. You can admit it. I understand perfectly whyyou're attracted to her. She's great. She's beautiful. She's clever. She's a good person. And she knows how to take care of herself. I mean, what more could somebody want? Nothing. But you have all those qualities too. No, I don't, and you know it. I'm not... I'm not beautiful. I'm cute. And I'm... No. I'm not clever. I'm streetwise. And I'm not a very good person. I mean, the only thing I am is self-sufficient. I do know how to take care of myself. And you are a good person. Don't say that about yourself. No, I'm not. How can you say that? How do you know? You don't even know me. I thought I knewyou better than anyone who had ever known you. I thought I knew you better than you knew yourself. That's what you said. No, that's what you said. Maybe I did. Maybe I said it because I knew that was what you wanted to hear. The way everything you said to me was what you thought I wanted to hear. Right up until just now when you did it again. Speaking ofwhich, I noticed that you didn't correct me... when I said that I was cute instead of beautiful... and streetwise instead ofclever. You're thinking about Carla. See? Lfyou had been honest from the beginning, things might have worked out a lot better for all three of us... and much more interestingly, hmm. How so? Sometimes you underestimate people. What? Meaning I underestimated you? No. Meaning that I might have been ready for certain things. - Such as? - Such as... a lot ofthings. Such as? Different things. And Carla might have been ready too. For what? You know what I'm talking about. Yeah, I know. I just want to hearyou say it. - Yeah, I'm sure you do. - So? - Use your imagination. - So what you're saying is... What I'm saying is that you blew it. You didn't have the confidence in yourselfto believe... that you could get what you wanted with the truth. What did I want that I didn't get? Halfofwhat you just got in there. - You mean double? - Yeah, right. Double. Like what? Like I've... To have been with both ofyou together? That that was my secret desire, and I was too timid to admit it? Well, no. I mean, I'm not sayingjust sex, and I'm not saying sex once. What do you mean? I am referring to... Mormonism. - Mormonism? - Mormonism. - I thinkyou mean bigamy. - Yes, bigamy, right. But not about the whole "getting married" thing. Just more about us all hanging out together, you know, and doing things together... and just being together all the time, you know? More like a triple instead ofa couple. So that's howyou would have wanted it? No. That's how you would've wanted it. You didn't have the... whatever to admit it. You think that's what Carla would want? Maybe. I think- I think she would be open to it. I think that we... we could convince her. Uh... Excuse me. Hello. Hi, Dr. Cutler. Thanks for calling me back. Listen, I've talked to my mom, like, three, four... a bunch oftimes today, and there's something in the level of hervoice that has got me, like, frightened. And I just want to know ifyou... Will you just call her... and-and then call me back and tell me what I should do? No, I'm telling you that I know something is wrong. I just want you to call her, call me back and tell me what is to be done. This is turning out to be a very strange day. After starting out rather innocently. Okay. Everything is changing so fast. Thanks. Everything seems to be going from one extreme to another and back again. Almost as if love and hate were interchangeable. No, I don't mean interchangeable. I mean inverted. You know, especially now for us with him. I mean, there's a part of me that feels like we could just tell him to fuck off... and never see him again. But I was also thinking that we could try something else. You know, something new and modern and kind ofstrange. Like this famous poet. Do you know what I'm talking about? Excuse me. Am I right in assuming that I'm not wanted for the moment? Yes. Or for longer than a moment. Then I'll vanish. Which famous poet? Um, well, I can't remember his name, but there was a biography on him the other night that I watched on cable. And he had a wife and a mistress, and they did everything together. And the women really got along. They were attracted to each other. They respected each other, and there was nojealousy or possessiveness. I mean, it was really very cool. And I just can't remember his fucking name. D.H. Lawrence? No. Wasn't he the Lawrence ofArabia guy? Wasn't he gay? No. That was T.E. Lawrence. T.E. Lawrence. No. This guy had a weird name. It was like... It sounded like a "Zzz," like Ezard or... Ezra Pound. Pound. Yes! Ezra Pound. That's it! I thought you vanished. I don't think - What... What are you doing? I mean, really. What are you doing? Are you trying to figure out how to make us forget? Are you searching for a new role to slip into because this old one doesn't work? Are you lost? Are you nervous? You look nervous. Are you practicing your act? I'm a practicing actor. You're trying hard. I'm a good actor. Right. I'm not a hack. Oh, really? Obviously, you've never seen my Hamlet, oryou wouldn't be berating me in this fashion. You'd have respect for me. You would. See, that's me in that picture over there. I am the Melancholy Dane. Did Hamlet lead a double life? I have to layyou on to a little of it, I think. So you want center stage? Yep. Always trying to be loved. Okay. Hamlet is upset with his mother for... amongst many things... co-conspiring to kill his father and also for owning his dick. Oh, well, you can relate to that one, right? No, but I can relate to how angry he is. And to how she controls his dick. Okay. Shh. It's coming. It's coming. Ecstasy. My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time, and makes as healthful music. It is not madness that I have uttered. Bring me to the test. And I the matter will re-word which madness would gambol from. Mother! For love of grace, lay not that flattering unction to your soul, that not your trespass, but my madness speaks: It will but skin and film the ulcerous place, whilst rank and corruption, mining all within, infects... unseen. Confess yourselfto heaven; repent what's past; avoid what is to come; and do not spread the compost on the weeds... to make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue; for in the fatness ofthese pursy times... virtue itselfofvice must pardon beg. Yeah, curb and woo... for leave to do him good. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in two. Oh, throw away the worser part of it and live the purer with the other half. Good night, but do not go to my uncle's bed; assume a virtue, ifyou have it not. You're gonna tell me that I'm not a great actor? I like your singing better. You do? Where did you grab that line? I didn't know that you knew Shakespeare. There's a lot you don't know about me. Yeah, I know, like who did you just go outside to call? - My mother. - Really? See, by the way that you're looking when you say that... No, you didn't call your mom. Who did you call? My mother. Why is it so hard foryou to believe that I'm calling my mother? Aren't you calling your mother all the time? Yeah, but my mom is not well. My mom hasn't been well. I would never lie about whether or not my mom was well. Well, who knows? You've lied about everything else. I have lied about nothing except sexual fidelity. That's really nothing, isn't it? It's hardly worth mentioning. It's one tiny, little, infinitesimal glitch on the radar screen. Yeah, and what do you mean about sexual fidelity? Do you mean that it wasjust the two of us for the last year? - That I was lying to, yeah. - Oh, that you were lying to. But what about casual acquaintances that you didn't have to lie to... because they didn't care what you did or who you did it with? - There was a few. Very few. - How few is very few? I thought that we were beyond... this-this stage... What made you think we were beyond it? Because it's unpleasant for you to be put on the spot 'cause you'd like to be beyond it? Because we had a little moment? Moment? Yes, a little moment, which changed nothing. Just as when I went outside, you and Lou had a little moment, which changed nothing either. - We didn't touch each other. - He's actually telling the truth this time. - It didn't even come up. - Why not? Why not? Well, I wouldn't have let him. Just the thought never crossed my mind. Nice. Thankyou very much. Well, no. You said you wouldn't have anyway. Well... How few is few? Five. Seven. I'm sorry. It was seven. It was sev... - It was less than 10. - Less than 10? Less than 10? Do I hear- Do I hear 20? Hey! Thirty? Fifty? Hey, come on. Who do you think I am? Nero? I'm not Wilt Chamberlain. No, but you're desperate and you're obsessed and you're totally out ofcontrol. Don't deny it, Blake, you are. Well, all right, maybe I am out ofcontrol often, usually. Do you really want to do this? 'Cause we're at the door of utter, uninhibited disclosure. Do you really want to hear names, dates, places? Who wanted to be licked where? Who wanted to be fucked how? Who had to be told what? Or in my estimation, what I think your personal defects are? Or what you're ready to hear? Or what you don't want to hear secretly? Or what if I told you what I thought about you but would devastate you to hear? Oh, so you're saying that the reason that we're in this situation... is because of our personal defects? What kind of girl gets involved with a guy like me knowing... But we didn't know. You never even let us get to knowyou. That's the thing. Because why? I don't know. You thought that ifwe would get to know you, then we would see who you really are and we wouldn't want to be with you. Why weren't you honest from the beginning? I never told you... You could've said, "Look, I just cannot be faithful. Let's get to know each other". Why did you have to make it into some fucking romance that you didn't believe in? I thinkyou've been avoiding us this whole time by calling your mother. It's like you're obsessed with your mother. We can't even talk to you for two seconds. But you're on the phone talking to your mother. You're substituting her for having a real relationship in your life. Stop talking about my mom. This is not right. This is about us. Everything is from your point ofview, and you're not fucking interested in us, because you're so fucking into your own head and how fucking charming and funny- And you're an actor, and everything. You just fucking avoid it. And you don't care about us and our problems at all. All you care about is convincing yourself that you're so desirable... by getting lots ofwomen to fuckyou, right? You don't even know how to be, like, just a person, just a clear, simple person. And this is probably the most truthful moment ofyour life right now. Am I right? I cannot believe that you are just dumping all this shit on me right now. This is really toxic. This is really fucked up. I would never get off on just sitting down and just railing into someone... and telling them all their character defects. This is twisted. - You thinkyou really know me? - Yeah. And you thinkyou just have me down and you know all my faults and all that. - Pretty well. - Okay, well, how many guys do you think I fucked? None. You've always said none. Well, that's right, but you've said none, too, haven't you? Not only is that what you've told me, but I just know that you're probably incapable of it, because you're so... you're so... You think I don't even know what sexual temptation is, like I couldn't understand on your higher plane ofsexual aliveness. I could never understand that? How many guys do you think I've fucked since I've been with you? None. More. - One. - More. - Two. You're lying, so... - More. Three. I know what you're doing. You'rejust trying to be... I don't know. More. Four? Fuck you. Four? Yes, four, but maybe it was three because one was Victorio, and he was a repeat. Now do you want to hear what these guys liked? How they liked to be degraded or deified... or how they liked to be licked or touched or fucked? Or do you want a comparative description ofdick size, including your own? I don't like this. Do you still love me? Am I still your one, your one and only one that you love? Are you incapable of getting excited by anyone except me? I can't... I can't even look at you. I mean, do you? Do you still love me? Okay, I know what you're trying to do. I kind of understand it even though it's twisted and really, like, psychotic ofyou to do it, but I will forgive you. Just-Just stop, 'cause it's not working. You can call him at the Soho Grand. He's staying there at Penthouse 5. He threatened to tell you if I didn't go see him tonight when I talked to him on the phone. I know that you would never do it, because you would never have reacted with such anger... to what I did ifyou had been doing it yourself. Because ifyou have, then you are so much more fucked up than I am. At least I'm fucking finally telling you the truth. You don't need to pull it out of me. When I did this to you, I wasn't trying to hurt you. Nowyou're doing it to me, like, with the intention of being hurtful. I'm not trying to hurt you. I'm only trying to get on some honest ground... where I feel like the rug isn't going to be pulled out from under me. You fucked Victorio? Victorio? That Chippendale'sjerk? Speaking of honest ground. I want to be on honest ground too. I understand completely what Carla's saying. Right. Three girls. Three girls. I'm so glad I said it. This is... You know what? This isn't even, like, going well, this little thing that you guys set up to fuck with me. No. We have not discussed this. I had no idea that she was gonna say this, - and I'm sure she had no idea that I was gonna say... - Jesus Christ! And thisjust proves to both of us... that we were both sort of unsatisfied with you. Girls? Girls? - So you are essentially a carpet-muncher then? - No. I find that term offensive. I'm sorry. I find that term offensive. - Clam-bumper. - No. I am an evolved woman... that realizes that you can get a lot out ofa relationship from a woman... like sensitivity, trust, nurturing... that you cannot get out ofa man. There's, like, a gray area... I can't fucking believe that you came here... and have driven my ass into the ground for 45 minutes, holding on to this information ofwhat you two have been up to. - This is fucking nuts! - Because you are not open with us. You're not who you are. You have fucked four other guys, and you've been with three women? Yeah. This is pathetic. Oh, you're so shocked. You said we should know... Shut up! Just fucking lash out! You guys have been railing into me about this bullshit! You're eating pussy! You're fucking three other guys and Victorio! Fuck both ofyou! You should have known that we were doing this ifyou're telling us... We didn't love those people. What does it matter ifyou loved them or not? This is fucking ridiculous. Oh, yeah? Well, have you loved anyone? You thinkyou really love me? Did you really love Lou? How do you love two people? Have you ever really loved anyone? Can you spare it in between all the times you're fucking all these different people? Do you have time to, like, have a feeling? And it doesn't feel very good, does it? Do you ever have any real feelings? Or do you just, like, uh, play Hamlet all the time and pretend to have real feelings? Look, I made my suggestion, and I thought it was a good one... Two girls and a guy. But it seems like you guys are a little too conventional for that. And that's okay. Hello. Hi, Dr. Cutler. Thanks for calling me back. So you talked to her? Yeah. No. I think there was a very significant drop in her voice. Fifty percent at least. Well, no offense, but maybe you don't know. I talk to her three times a day, and I know that there is something different. Do you think that it's possible that-that... Yes, she's still smoking. I don't know what she told you, but that's the truth. Well, when you tell me not to worry... Don't worry? I am worried. Your professional opinion? L... Listen, I know my mother. I'm telling you there's something wrong with her, and I think that she should probably be admitted today. Well, I don't think that's acceptable. All right, so ifyou're not going to be in the office, then-then give me... What good is having your service number? When I call you, they're gonna track you down to the ninth hole? I'm telling you I need your help, and you're telling me not to worry, and I am worried. Well, then refer me to someone else. I'm telling you that something's wrong. I've got to bring her in. No... I am relaxed. I am relaxed. But I don't understand whyyou're-you're... Well, what do you suggest? Is that all you have to say? You're a fucking quack. I'll just do it myself. This fucking helps a lot with this bullshit. I'm gonna go upstairs and make a phone call. Okay. Okay. I apologize if I was derogatory about your bisexuality. It's okay. I'm gonna have to go see my mom in a couple of minutes, 'cause there's something, uh... This guy's inept. He's a quack, and I just... For five minutes, I gotta... I feel bad about everything. I do. I'm sorry that I reacted the way I did in there. And-And I just... Words are, uh, not serving me at all. I think that language is always lies, no matter... That's why I like playing the piano, because then there's no words, and-and... What's your point? What do you want to do? I don't know. I'm very reluctant tojust say good-bye. I think that there's something exceptional that could come of us, notjust ditching our relationship right now, don't you? Even if I think that, I think it would... The cycle would just still continue. Finally, it would just come down to chemistry. Hormones. Yeah, or the only thing to do when you're just overcome with overwhelming desire... Isjust submit to it. I mean, even if it's only rarely or once. Right. It's still... I don't know. A violation. Yeah. Well, even if it was admitted to, if it was owned up to... Bragged about? What? Don't you think that's what it would feel like? "Hi, how was your day?" "It was great. I fucked this guy. How was yours?" What are you saying? That after everything, it's better to lie? I'm just saying that maybe we'rejust not capable of monogamy. I mean, maybe to some people it's second nature. Maybe we'rejust... Fucked up? Maybe monogamy violates some essential part ofour being and desire makes us feel alive. We need to feel desired and to say no is like a self-mutilation. Some people, maybe they're so desperate they need to feel they're not alone... so theyjust pretend that they can love one person exclusively. "They" being you and I? Well, would you argue with that? I'd like to, but I don't think I could make a valid argument for it. But I think that regardless ofwhether or not you can trust me 100% ofthe time, or I can trust you when I'm not with you, or we trust ourselves, that doesn't mean that we should just can it right now. I think we should continue and see what happens. Stick it out. I gotta go see my mom. I'll be right back, okay? Don't leave, okay? I'm gonna go. But here's my number. Lfyou ever have the beer, I'll always have the time. And I don't mean just sexually. Not just sexually anyway. Hi. Manhattan on, uh, Madison Avenue. It's Frank E. Campbell. It's a business. Uh, Cam... uh, "E," the letter "E." And then Campbell. C A M P B E L L. Uh, it's a funeral home. Hi. I'm call... uh... I'm sorry. Hi. Hello... Hello? Hi. My- Hello? Hi, yeah, um, I'm calling to make funeral arrangements... for my friend's mother. Dorothy Allen. Okay. Yeah, we'll be there then. Okay. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I'm really sorry. Oh, goddamn. I'm sorry. We should go. Okay.
