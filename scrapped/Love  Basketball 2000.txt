 

                        Swish! That's "horse." - You can't make that. - Watch me. You guys are too easy. Just wait till I get big like Kareem. You want to be like Kareem? All his big butt do is stand by the basket. - I be blocking your stuff. - Yeah, right. Hey, look. Q. I thought you said only girls were moving in. That's what my mom said. Hope he can ball. - Bet he's a scrub like Kelvin. - Shut up. - Can I play? - No. - You nice? - Yeah, I'm nice. All right. You and Kelvin against me and Jamal. - Oh, man! - He is a girl! - Girls can't play no ball. - Better than you. - What a dog. - She heard you. She can only hear dog whistles. - Check. - Check. Damn! She dogged you, man. - Shut up! - One-zip. Lucky. Damn! I got her. Told you I was nice. I'm gonna be the first girl in the NBA. I'll be in the NBA. You'll be my cheerleader. Oh, God. Be quiet. How you feeling, munchkin? You tough. She needs to stop running around like a boy. - She's all right. - Looking the way she does? Camille, she'll be fine. Let me find you some gauze. Girl, who you trying to fool? Alley-oop, dad. Boy. New neighbors. Really? See, Quincy, this is how your moms caught me. With the old fake and bake. Thought I was catching a sister who could burn. I can't do this shit. Boy, what did I tell you about using that word? "Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary. And why not? 'Cause when you say "can't", you ain't a man. - That's right. - Zeke. What? Oh, yeah. Don't say shit. Come on. We should head on over. Just you and Quincy, baby. I got a meeting. - With who? - Some business folks. You just got back from a four-game road trip. Nona, please don't start bitching. I got maybe two years left to play. I'm trying to put some things together for us. See you later, man. Be good. I love you. I love you, Dad. So how long have y'all been here? We moved back here when Quince was about five... after Zeke was traded again. The neighborhood was a little more mixed then. Before the black people down the street... became the black people next-door. OK? Thank you so much again. This was terribly nice of you, Nona. Girl, don't worry about it. It's the least I could do. I love to cook. You do? I cook for my friends' parties back in Atlanta. You're a caterer? No. Once Nathan gets settled in, though... and the girls are a little older... that's certainly something Mom would like to try. Do you know as long as I have lived next-door... I have never seen the inside of this house? Let's just have a look. Honey, put that on the table for mom. Quince, help her. So how come you can play basketball? I just can. I never knew a girl that can play. Momma says she doesn't know why I act different. - Your dad play? - He works at a bank. My dad plays for the Clippers. He says I'm gonna be a doctor or a lawyer... but I'm gonna play for them. Same number and everything. I'm gonna be number 32, like Magic. He's all right. My dad can take him. What was the most points you daddy ever got? I don't know. A lot. Well, one game, Magic scored 48 points... they only had six-minute quarters... and he sat out the whole fourth quarter. - You do act different. - I don't care. If anybody messes with you... just let me know, 'cause I run this street. I'll tell my sister Lena. She don't know how to box. My dad taught me how to fight like Ali. I know karate from Almighty Isis. Bet you can't do this, though. How about this? Monica. Sit still. And don't sit on your knees, sweetie. You're gonna turn them black. You are lucky I found it. Someone had put your box of dresses... underneath a pile of rags in the garage. - You OK? - Yeah. I need to lay down. I've been running around all day. Honey, which one of these for tomorrow? - Blue stripe. - You sure? You want to iron them both? Just in case. - Sure. - Thanks, sweetie. That boy next-door will ride to school with you tomorrow. You'll know somebody. Hurry up. I'll come back up for good nights. Make it look nice, OK? You want to be my girl? What do I have to do? I guess we can play ball and ride to school together. When you get mad at me, I got to give you flowers. But I don't like flowers. How about Twinkies? My mom won't ever buy them. I think we ought to kiss now. For how long? Five seconds? Not out here. Over there, then. Ready? Wait. 'Cause you my girl, you got to ride on my bike. I want to ride my own bike. - My dad always drives my mom. - So? That means I have to ride you. Come on. I don't have to do what you say. Forget you, then, stupid. You stupid, and your dad plays for the worst team in the NBA. What? Last time they won, Dr. J was a nurse. Shut up! I don't want to be your boyfriend, you ugly dog. I don't want to be your girlfriend, big head. Get off me! Big head. Hey, Q. Play some "D"! Technical foul. For what? Damn! Come on, get in. Let it go. Unsportsmanlike conduct, white. - For what? - Technical foul. - Man, you suck! - Two shots. Sit down and shut up. Let it go. She feels better. Oh, please. She's behaving horribly. I'm out. I need a sub. Karinda, sub, sub, sub. Dad, you got to talk to coach for me. What am I supposed to say to the man? Tell him to keep me on the floor. The coach from UCLA was there. He has me riding the bench. - You lost your head. - I was showing emotion. So it's all right for you to act like that? Whatever. - What did you do? - Nothing. I don't know why I keep hoping... you'll grow out of this tomboy thing. I won't. I'm a lesbian. That's not funny. That's what you think... 'cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron? Please. Monica, I think what your mother is saying is... Maybe it's time you start thinking about other things beside basketball. What? One game left and you haven't been recruited. Munchkin, I wanted this as bad as you did... but we have to face reality. The coach from USC will be at the championship. I know, but chances are... Chances are there's still a chance. If you would just listen to someone for a change... you'd realize you have a lot going for yourself. You're smart. You would be pretty if you'd do something with your hair. I don't know why you run around with your hair looking like... "Who shot John and forgot to kill him." You'd be real pleasant-looking if you'd smile. My mom's about to be home. I'm not good enough to meet your moms? Now, girl. If my moms knew I had a hottie like you up in the crib... she would beat the black off of me. That's a lot of beatin'. Hey, girl. Your hair looks really cute like that. Thanks. So, do you know who Q is asking to the spring dance? Nope. Come on, girl. You live right next-door. Just tell me who's been creeping. There's just so many, I can't keep track. Can you give him this for me? Please? Give it yourself. I'm not trying to look all fast. Thanks, girl. Good lord, look at that booty. I want to lick the sweat off. Quincy, so help me out. Where's it gonna be? I'll see you at the press conference, baby. Four years, I've been writing about your son. Did that cover story on you two in "Sunday Magazine." You'd love for him to play at USC like you, right? No, I'd love for him to get a good education. See you at the press conference. Fine. Blow me off. Never like that, baby. We should have another talk with Coach Carile of Princeton. Come on, Pop. There's no way an lvy League team will go all the way. I don't care about the team, Quincy. I care about the school. Didn't we have this conversation already? Right. You played a good game today. I was proud of you. Thanks, man. You up for a game later? I don't want to hurt your feelings now. You don't want to hurt that back. I gotta bend down low to guard you. Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting... so tell your mom I'm gonna be late. Don't work too hard. Let's hope I can say the same about you someday. I love you, bro. - I love you, too. - Be cool. Hey, what's up, man? Thank you. Hey, Mr. M. Hey, Miss Baller. Excuse me, ladies. - Way to hoop. - I know this. - What you want? - A ride home. Your legs don't look broke. Look, big head, I'll be at your car. I guess "Please" would be a stretch? Please. Don't touch the radio, all right? Just appreciate the ride home. Have a little respect for a man's car. Put something on. No, I like going home in silence after the game. Thinking about how good I look shootin' that three. Don't flatter yourself. What's that? Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give you. Shawnee Easton. With the bigass titties? Hey, give it here! Give it here! "Q, you are so fine. "I've been wanting to get with you. "Let me take you to the spring dance... and I promise I'll leave you satisfied." What a ho. Why she gotta be a ho 'cause she wanna get with me? She's a ho because she's sends her coochie through the mail. And? She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy... and I want to get to know you better." She's saying, "I wanna bone." She's honest. An honest, tramp-ass ho. But then I guess you'll stick your thing in anything. My thing? I didn't know you cared so much. I don't. So, who you going to the dance with, anyway? Spalding? Who's Spalding? - See? - Stupid! That's why you ain't getting recruited. Who said I'm not getting recruited? Your hot-ass temper, that's who. I'm not the one who put this scar here... when we were 11-years-old 'cause he was about to lose. You know what? Give me your best shot. Give me your best shot. I'm sick of... Would you watch the damn road? I am. I'm sick of you hanging this over my head. Give me your best shot. Don't tempt me. I'm warning you. I'm warning you. You don't store that attitude, no one will recruit you. Please. You jump in some guy's face, you talk smack... and you get a pat on your ass. But because I'm a female... I get told to calm down and act like a lady. I'm a ballplayer. With a jacked-up attitude. Didn't know you cared so much. I really don't. Good. I'm home! What's up, Mom? What is this? That's your earring. I look like some hoochie to you? I found it on your bed. What you doing in my room? I have told you about these fast-ass girls. We were just studying. Boy, I'm not playing with you. These girls are looking to get you caught. They see you, and they see dollar signs. I know. Are you hearing me? I'm hearing you. No. Are you hearing me? I've been hearing you, Mom. How was your game? 27 points, 11 assists, still undefeated. Still the man. You know that. Where's your dad? He said he'd be home later. Later when? I don't know. He had a meeting. At 1:00 in the morning? I'm not getting anywhere by punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude. I came second to the NBA. I'm not about to come second to no bullshit scouting job. I didn't mean it like that. Zeke, all I'm saying is that it would be nice... if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy. If you don't talk to him... I have. You said you'd think about going back to get your degree. You said I should get my degree. I like my bullshit job. And it's gonna lead to a front-office position. Until then, don't worry. We got just enough savings... to keep your fine ass in Gucci and gold. How many nights does my fine ass get... Damn you! What about now? Do I get a week yet? - Keep your voice down! - Keep your ass home! Coming to my game? You know that, but I got finals tomorrow... so I gotta leave at halftime. You can't leave at halftime. It's the championship. I know, but I got a cutie coming over to help me study. What's going on with you and the spring dance? You got a date yet? Yeah. Brothers are lined up at my locker. I found you someone. Found? I'm not some charity case. Ma tell you to do that? - No, she did not. - Damn, Lena. Who is he? This brother from my college. He's in college? And he is fine, girl. How'd you get him to say yes? I told him you looked like me. Great. - Monica, you do. - Yeah, right. If you were tore up, I would not be claiming you. Trust. We're gonna do something cute with your hair... get you in a nice, sexy dress, some heels. I don't know how to walk in heels. You just worry about playing your heart out... for that recruiter tonight. You let your big sister worry about your date. You ever been in love? Too many times. They ever love you back? Once I cut 'em off. Why? I don't have to tell you girls how big this game is. We worked too damn hard not to take the championship with us. So we're gonna play smart and with control... and we're gonna kick some butt. Captain! - Whose house? - C-house! - C... - House! Lady Cougars on three. One, two, three, Lady Cougars! Come on, now. Come on! Crenshaw Cougars! Crenshaw! Crenshaw! Green! White! 44 spread, 44. Down 4, you got this. What you got, baby? Don't get tight. She's laying off. Pull up. Down one, down one. Come on, D-up, Mon. Watch the ball. Watch the ball. Now. Bonus. Toss up. Take it right. Watch your left! All right, watch your left! Up one. D-up, Mon. Come on. Play smart. Up one. Play smart. You got this. Play smart. Play smart. I got this. Play smart. Don't put that out there. - What? - Reaching in. No! Come on, ref. White, 3-2... reaching in. One and one. Bull! Let it go. It's all right. Just get it back. One shot. Let's go, Monica. Take this all the way. It's all you, Mon. Let's go. Come on, come on, Mon. Get there. You just need to get there. Come on, you need this. Please. Foul, foul, foul! Holding. That's five. That's OK. You played hard. It's all right, Monica. It might help if you didn't look so evil. I don't even want to go. Talk to me. Go look in my top drawer and bring Grandmother's pearls. Tonight... don't worry about yesterday's game... or the recruiters or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that? Here you go, Ma. Thanks, sweetie. Do you really think I'm beautiful? Honey, hush. Can I take your coat? You're cold? No. I mean, I can check it for you. Sorry. Your sister wasn't lying. Damn. Hold up. Well, I see you made it. You don't look half bad. You, either. What's up, black? Jason. Damn, girl. I didn't know Nike made dresses. Guess we'll see you later. So, you like school? High school was cool. I don't remember the sisters being as find as you, though. Girl, how come you're so stressed? Sorry. No. I'm having a good time with you. So what I do have to do to make you have a good time? My mouth is kind of dry. Then I'll get you some punch. Don't jet while I'm gone and leave a glass slipper behind. There we go. Oh, man. You having fun? Damn d.j. Is fresh. Who is this clown? He ain't Spalding. Guess not. So, you took Shawnee, huh? It was late. She asked. You want to dance? Sure. What? Early night for you, isn't it? Should be asking you the same... after your big date with college boy and all. Where'd y'all go after? - Mulholland Drive. - Figures. So, what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit? None of your business. I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied. That's what you think, huh? After you left, I told Shawnee it was time to go... drove her ass straight home. After she told me... I was the dumbest brother in the world, I took off. I was sitting in Jason's ride with him... And he was kissing on me and feeling on me and... It was really bugging me, 'cause I couldn't remember how many offensive boards I had in the championship. And then I guess he got sort of tired of me... "accidentally" Kneeing him in the balls. - Four. - What? You had four offensive rebounds. Hold up a second. What's up? USC. It was on my desk when I came home. What you waiting for? Can you...? You sure? All right. What? Damn, girl. They want you. And guess what. Guess what. What? I'm going, too. They're announcing it tomorrow. I knew it. Congratulations. What was that about? I don't know, all right? Come on. Wait a minute. Want me to stop? Let's go, freshman. You're getting spanked! Point guards lead from the front, not the back. Come on, girl. You took her out. Girl, you need your mama? Do you need a hug? Are you telling me you can't take a little charge? I can take it. Get your feet set this time. Go. Next. Let's go. Move it! Way to work it. Good job. Lower, Monica, move your feet! I said lower! Monica, this is low. This is low. You got it? Offense sells tickets. Defense wins games. Back to the line, everybody. Let's go! Hustle up! Move it! Come on, get a move on. You got it. Come on, lift. That's it. Coach hates me, doesn't she? She hates all freshman. What is up with that? Don't take it personally. Don't think just because we play the same position... we have to compete with each other. We're teammates, OK? Thanks, Sidra. Besides, I've been starting point the last two years. Ain't no way some soft-ass freshman is taking my spot. Damn, Sid. You're all right, fresh. Come on. You finish your reading for Econ? What it say? Basically, it broke down... how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA... being I'm such a limited commodity. Whatever, big head. Q-man, you gonna take us to the final 4? We'll see. - I'll be watching. - Hope so. What? You do see me standing here, right? I can't be nice to a fan? Fine, Quincy. I can't help it if girls come up to me. I said fine. Oh, little baby. What you doing? Quit. Daddy's here. You're such a punk. All these girls... you're the only one I know who's for real. I love you, too. All right now. Hustle back! Hustle back! Get that, Shay! Nice shot! Stay with her. Monica, get up on her. Stay on her. That's it. You got it. Ball! All right, now. Push it up! You got help. Be active, Sidra. Don't reach. Cut, Mon, cut! Shot! Yeah, girl! Sidra, feel like playing any "D"? Let's get back. Stay balanced. Move your feet. Nice steal. You're by yourself! Heads up! Whose net? Yeah, girl. While you're so busy posing, your man just scored. - Show me again. - What? You like to pose so much, let's see it again. You think I'm funny? Stand like that for the rest of practice. I want you to stand like that so you get sick of it... because I don't want to see it again. Do you hear me? That's right. Dora, take her place. Better step off the court. Nice pass. What was up with practice today? She tried to kill us. Can you hook me up with some socks, please. I need my socks back. What am I, the sock lady or something? That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman. I was just playing ball. You were trying to make me look bad. I didn't have to try very hard. Girl, don't you know you just sloppy seconds? Sidra, let it go. The only reason you here... is Tanya Randall got pregnant and decided not to come. They were done recruiting. That's cold, Sid. Just thought the girl should know. Don't even trip, Mon. She's just mad 'cause she's bowlegged. Forget Tanya Randall. Coach wishes she was here instead of me. So prove her wrong. I don't have it easy like you, all right? There's no red carpet laid out for me. So you're gonna act salty all night? Yo, dog, about to order some wings. No, thanks, man. No, we're fine. Don't worry about proving everybody wrong. If you can't handle the pressure... I'll understand. That is so weak. No. I'm serious. Who cares if you're never the first girl to be in the NBA? You're gonna get more play being Quincy McCall's girl. That's what you get. I got you. So, how about a little one on one? What we playing for? - Clothes. - What? I score, you strip. You score, I drop something. Give me the ball. Home court advantage, baby. All right. Hold up a second. Let's see what you got. Don't reach. I ain't reaching. Strip. All right, George Jefferson. Take it off, yeah. It's all right. First try, lucky try. What? Feel the butt. Where's the "D"? Kiss my black ass. I plan to. Hold up. All's fair in love and basketball, baby. All right. Strip. Come on. You trying to clown? Too bad you got your mama's height. Take it off. - Come on. Do it. - You can't hold me. You're going down. What? What? My bad. Where's the "D"? It's right here. I won. I wanted you to. It's about emotion. It's about determination. It's about heart. It's college basketball. And I'm like a kid in a candy store. Are you kidding me? I get so excited about it. There are too many great teams to choose from. I mean, we're talking about... the Dukes, the Kentuckys, Arkansases. But my surprise treat this season... Is the probable emergence of USC as a basketball powerhouse. On the men's side... the heavily recruited freshman phenom Quincy McCall. One of my real diaper dandies, a genuine PTPer... a prime time player, baby. And for the women... while not boasting one of the top recruiting classes... they are returning four starters from last year's squad... which made it to the sweet 16. And Coach Ellie Davis feels that if just... one of her freshman has a breakout season... It's gonna be awesome, baby, with a capital "A"! And at guard... player number 22... Quincy McCall! Here, now! A break! Go, go, go, go! What else do I have to do? I mean, up and under between 2 defenders with the left? That's got to make "Sports Center." Zeke and Q. How you doing, Terry? What can I get you? Genuine draft for me. Orange juice for my son. Hey, Pop. The numbers I'm putting up this year... are better than any other freshman. People saying I'm a definite lottery pick. What people? Just people, you know. Tell them to mind their own damn business. Here you go, fellas. Thanks, Terry. Quincy, give yourself time to develop. Get an education. The NBA ain't going nowhere. You're right. Besides, the sooner you go pro... the sooner you got to deal with the mess I'm dealing with. What mess? There's this thing out there, this paternity suit. What? Some girl that's been hanging on at every party. Now I'm supposed to be her baby's daddy. I told your mom I wanted to be the one to tell you. Tell me what? I just told you. I mean, it's... it's not true, is it? You got the balls to ask me that? I'm sorry, Pop. No. If you need to hear me say it... I'll say it. It's not true. Yo, Q-man. Awesome game. Thanks, man. - Can I get your autograph? - Sure. To Paul. Thank you. Take it easy. Let's go, let's go. Let's go, USC. Time! You all right, Sid? It's gonna be all right. Just hang on. Stay calm. It's all right. Mom? I'm late. What's up, Ma? Hey, you scared me, baby. Oh, I'm sorry. You OK? Mm-hmm. I'm fine. You know, Ma, last time my mother be drinking... Marvin Gaye died. Is it about dad? I guess he talked to you. Don't sweat it. The truth's bound to come out sooner or later, right? And whose truth are you talking about? We can't let something like this break up the family. You do believe him, right? Don't you? Quincy, just let it go. Ma, this ain't nothing but about money. Quincy, please. How many times you told me to watch these hos out there? I should have been telling your father that. So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop? What's this? I hired somebody. Ain't that pathetic? After all his late nights and his meetings... and I still needed proof. I used to think that I was lucky being married to Zeke McCall. I am too tired. I am tired. Mama, don't cry. Put your hands in your pockets. Keep your head up. Always look a man in the eye. All the time, I'm hanging on his every word... like he's God or something. Q, I know he messed up... but that doesn't change what he's been to you. What has he been to me? The man looked me in my eye... and he lied to me like it was nothing. Like... Like it was easy. I know some guys dog their wives, you know, but... man, I didn't... I never thought my pop would do something like that. What? Nothing. Why don't we walk to my dorm? I don't feel like running into anybody. Let's just kick it here. I can't. Why not? Coach has us on 11:00 curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up. I could stay a few more minutes. Don't sweat it. Quincy, I'm sorry. All right, for real, I should be alone right now, OK? Give me a call, maybe, when you get in? I'll stay up. Gimme the ball! Hustle up! Let's play. Play smart. Hold it! Get back, get back! No shot! Offensive foul! Good job! Yeah, baby! We won! You see that crowd? Oh, damn, mon, I think old girl... took out your chi-chis with that shot. Yo, T, why you so quiet? Just thinking about next year. I thought you were hyped about playing overseas. I was, but it's never gonna be like this... playing in front of my family, hanging out with my homegirls. Probably don't even have a McDonald's over there. Girl, please, there's always a McDonald's. Is she pregnant? Better be Q. You could have given up after you threw that ball away. But you kept your head, and you showed real heart. Thanks, Coach. Our final games are against Oregon and Oregon State... and I want to shake things up a bit, so... I'm starting you at point again. But l... I thought Sidra's ankle was OKfor next game. You want the job or not? What? It just... It just seems like you're always riding me. You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential? When I ignore you, then you worry. Q in the house! I missed you all day. Really? I came by your crib. Darren said you'd be here. When was this? A little after my game. Look, we went to celebrate after, all right? But I came right after that. Sorry about your game. Hey, it happens, right? What's up, superstar? Did you hear about your girl? She won the starting spot. Oh. Hey, where the keg at? It's in the back room. What's up? Just wanted to say good game. But? No buts. Thanks. Just one word of advice for next season. What's that? Never let a freshman take your spot. All right, Q-man. I'll see you. Who was that? Nobody. Who's nobody? Look, this party's wack. You ready to go? Do you want to go talk? Not really. We can finish what we were talking about last night. Q, quit! What's wrong? You know what? I'm gonna go crash. Fine. Maybe I'll come by later. Nah, I got curfew. What are you doing here? The door was unlocked. It still is. You can let yourself out. I messed up, OK? I know that. But I ain't that kid's father. Lucky kid. I ain't saying it's right, just sometimes, things happen. Some things should never fucking happen! Look, boy, you so perfect you can look down on me? I'm not a liar. Your mama's real quick to show you those pictures, huh? She was 19 when she got pregnant. Don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life. But she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage. You're trying to say my mother trapped you? I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man. Now when you're in the NBA, and you roll into a city... there's a hundred girls waiting down in that lobby. Listen to me. There's twenty more that make it past security onto your floor... and the boldest one is there at your front door. After a while, it just becomes part of the game. I'm sorry I lied to you when I shouldn't have... but I only did it because I didn't want to see... that look on your face that you got right now. Well, since we're being so honest... Since we're being so honest... I figured that I'd tell you... I decided to drop out of school and turn pro. Oh, boy. Damn it! Look, man, I know you're mad at me, OK? But I cannot let you do this. I always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary. Hey, what's up? Downtown. Hey, what's up, girl? Where's your boy? Oh, in back. - Oh, man! - Here you go. Hey, baby. You weren't at my game. I'm sorry. I had this meeting with this guy. You win? Yeah, I hit four 3s. The man again, huh? No, the woman. What's up? Monica, this is Kerry. Kerry, this is Monica. What's going on? I was about to go get some food. You want to come? Maybe I should come back. No, you stay. I'll leave. Ready? What are you doing here? I didn't know I needed a reason to come home. Don't be so defensive. I'm surprised to see you. Dad around? No. He's still at the bank. Is everything OK? Good. I'm going to the market to get things for dinner. Will you join us? I don't know. It's just a game. What? Every time you lose, you get this attitude... but it is just a game. Got your key? Can we talk? Talk to your new girlfriend. I took the ho to Burger King. - Cheap date. - She had time for me. You messed around to prove a point? You got your head so far up your ass... it took a cheap date for you to notice me. Did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else? You forgot to be there. You wanted to talk about your dad, I had curfew. - What was I supposed to do? - Stay! If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting. At least you got your priorities straight. I'd never ask you to choose. You'd never have to. I'm a ballplayer. If anybody knows what that means it should be you. If basketball is all you care about, why bone me? Why don't you bone Dick Vitale? Wait a minute. Hold on. How do I know the next time you're feeling neglected... you're not gonna just run around on me? If we're going to be together... I have to be able to trust you. I'm not asking for us to be together. What? I'm going through a lot of shit right now. It's obviously more then you got time for. How can you tell me what I have time for? Whatever I did, we can fix this. I don't think so. You don't think so? I'm entering the draft. You're what? I'm going pro. Who knows where I'm gonna end up, you know? When did you decide all this? A few days ago. So that's it? Just... Just forget about you and me? I'd still like to be friends. Friends. I'll see you around. Luisa, what did he say? He say to give the ball to you. What's up? What's up, Sidra? What do you know? I'll love winning this championship in your house. How do you say, "You're dreaming," in Italian? This ain't college, and I ain't on crutches. Can you take that damn thing off the table? You mean my championship trophy? My bad. You are still a cocky bitch. Look at you. So what are these Spanish guys like? I wouldn't know. What? You've been here seven months and ain't tapped nothing? Just not my type, I guess. Shit. Them Italian boys? They love them some black women. They can't get enough of me. Do you ever think about going back? Sometimes, but what's the alternative? Not playing? Do you remember Big Toni? She quit last year and works at some bookstore. Look at us. They treat us like Hollywood stars over here. We just played in the championship game. It doesn't get much sweeter than this. 7 straight points in this run. Worthy for 3. Stu, this game is in the refrigerator. The door is closed. The lights are out. The eggs are cooling. Butter gettin' hard, and the Jell-O's jigglin'. And here come the subs. It's nice to see the subs get a chance to play. - The fans love it. - They really do. Quincy McCall is in for Nick Van Exel. Quincy has got the ball over in the corner. Puts up a 3-pointer. That's no good. The former Trojan came out after his freshman year... and as they go down the floor the other way... I can tell you he has moved around quite a bit... but now he's trying to find a home with these Lakers. Quincy makes a steal. He's on his way. Open court. Look out, folks. It's showtime! - How is he? - Not great. What is "Not great"? He tore his a.c.I. Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that. How you been? Happy... and he won't want to see you. Hey, son. You made "Sports Center." What do you want? Just came by to check on you. After five years? Don't remember that being all my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom. Look... I know things look kind of bleak right now... but don't get down on yourself. I stopped taking your advice a long time ago... or did you forget? You want me to step off? Fine, but not until I say something. You're a better ballplayer than I ever was. But that ain't the only thing you got going for you. You're smart, Quincy. I always knew you could do anything you wanted to. You want to play ball, son? Then play ball. Just know you're not like everybody else on that court. You're not like I was. You got options. That's all I ever wanted to show you. How come you couldn't be the man you tried to make me? I just couldn't, son. Good morning! And I thought this was gonna be awkward. I got these. Not that you need any more. So how're you doing? I'm doing all right. I heard you were in Spain. I was. I see your peach fuzz finally grew in. Just something new I'm trying. No, it looks good. It's cool. Thank you. Shouldn't you be lying down? No, I'm cool. Have a seat. No, I'm fine. Still trying to be the first girl in the NBA? I tried sneaking in after college... but they found breasts during my physical. That's funny. I never did. Kiss my ass. I can't believe it's been five years. I tried calling you a couple of times. Oh, yeah? I wanted to give you props on making first team All-American. Then, when Magic retired, I tried again. Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine. It was always messing up. I figured something like that. So when you going back? Actually... l'm not. What do you mean? I'm tired of playing overseas. I'm over there by myself, no family, no friends. My phone bill is ridiculous. Thinking about giving it a rest for a while. A rest? Basketball just isn't fun for me anymore. You know? Hey, babe. Baby. Nobody would switch flights with me. Baby, what are you doing out of bed? What are you doing? Baby, this is Monica. You guys grew up together, right? Quincy's told me all about you. Monica, this is Kyra, my fiancee, Fiancee? Wow. Congratulations. Thank you. I didn't know. That's great. Well, I should go. Monica, I really appreciate you coming by. We really appreciate it. Quincy, good luck with your knee and everything. Your sister's bringing the baby by later, so... be nice to be around. I can't wait to see her. Need any help? No, I can manage, thank you. I just saw Quincy. How's he? Engaged. To that stewardess? You met her? His mother had a barbecue a few weeks back. He could do a lot better, if you ask me. So what do I do? Find out where they're registered and send a gift. Whatever. Is that still your answer to everything? When you come at me with bullshit like that. Are they cursing their mamas in Spain? You didn't want my opinion, why did you ask? I asked, but why does it have to be so damn prissy? What do you want me to say, Monica? Go over there and beat up the girl? Go have sex with him? 'Cause I'm not gonna do it. Yes, I think decorum is important... and yes, I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a jump-up shot. If that makes me too prissy for you, too damn bad. So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a stupid jump shot? You always turn your nose up at me. No, I don't. Oh, yes. Female superstar athlete... whose mother is nothing but a housewife. That's not it. Don't tell me you're not ashamed of me. I know. I remember when I was eight years old. You spent four hours cooking up this big, fancy meal... and I guess you and dad got your wires crossed. In he walks with a couple of pizzas... and you didn't say anything. You never stood up for yourself. Ever. If I was ashamed, it was because of that. That is ridiculous. What's ridiculous is not being a caterer... so your husband can feel like a man... knowing his woman's cooking and ironing his drawers. Damn it. I'm sorry. Is that really all you think about me? When your daddy and I got married, I had dreams. But I happen to have gotten pregnant with Lena... and then I had you... so I had to put my dreams on hold. You know what day I remember? In high school, your spring dance... and I put my mother's pearls around your neck... and I told you you were beautiful... because you were. That day, I was happy I didn't have... a catering business to run off to. My family had three meals a day. They had somebody to pick up after them... and when my daughters went to a dance... I could help them get ready. That is what I came to care about. That's all you cared about. I must have played in a thousand games... and I can only remember you being at two. You had your coaches and your daddy for that stuff. It never mattered to you whether I was at them games. It mattered, Mama. It mattered. Save pulls up the original account. Shift F8 pulls up the open account. Oh, hello, Mr. Wright. - Could you excuse me? - Sure. Thank you. How's it going? - Fine. - Fine? Damn, girl. I remember your mom had to beat you into a dress. Very funny. Visitin'? Kyra's out of town for a couple of days. Figured I'd keep my mom company. So how's the knee? It's getting there. Strong enough to get you down the aisle? Two weeks. I didn't get to send you an invitation, but... Oh, it's OK. It's OK. I'm probably... you know. Can I ask you something? You never told me why ball wasn't fun anymore. It just isn't. Cause I'm kinda feelin' that way, too. We had a rough couple a years. That's all. I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months. I may miss the attention, but besides that... You're serious. Seems like I needed ball when I was trying to be like my pop. No. I was tryin' to be better than my pop. Now it's time I tried something different. Like what? Well, I'm thinkin' about goin' back to school. What? Wow. Yeah. Kyra hasn't heard about the school thing yet. She'll probably say it's the painkillers talkin'. It's a trip, you know? When you're a kid, you... You see the life you want... and it never crosses your mind... that it's not gonna turn out that way. So why did you give up ball? Why do you keep sweatin' me on that? Because I don't get it. Man, I never knew a girl... I never knew anyone who loved ball as much as you. Now all of a sudden, you're gonna trade in your Nikes... for a pair of shoes you can't even walk in. What's up? Just leave it alone, all right? All right. You need to put a sweater on him. It's a little chilly, sweetie. She's fine, ma. Yes. Her little icicle arms are so sweet. All right, ma. Come on, Lorraina. Your grandma says it's too cold. Oh, grandma. You know, Monica... one of the things that always drove me crazy about you... and I have to admit it made me jealous... I always admired was the fight in you. What are you talking about? Well... I might be a little more prissy in this situation that you... but remember when I said Quincy could do better? I was talkin' about you. What's goin' on? We need to talk. Please? You asked me what was missing. - What? - From basketball. You woke me up to tell me that? It's not fun for me anymore, because you're missing. What I'm trying to say is... I've loved you since I was eleven. It sure won't go away. We haven't talked since college. You wait two weeks before my wedding... to tell me something like that? I know. I probably should have said it two weeks ago. You haven't changed. You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass. Guess what? It doesn't. Then why are you so upset? Because you don't pull this on someone about to get married. Better late than never, right? Wrong. I'll play you. What? One game, one-on-one. For what? Your heart. You're out of your mind. So, what, you gonna bitch up? Huh. What's that supposed to be, some psychology? Look, I know why you broke up with me in college... and not that it wasn't messed up... but I should have been there for you. I just didn't know how to do that and be all about ball. Monica, after that stuff with my dad... I couldn't trust anybody, OK? I was lost. That was five years ago. I've moved on. Prove it. What will this prove? You once said the reason I beat you... was because you wanted me to. - So? - So... if I win... it's because deep down you know you're about to make... the biggest mistake of your life. And deep down, you want me to stop you. And what happens when you lose? If I lose... I'll buy you a wedding present. First to ten. To five. You scared? I have better things to do. Check! One-zip. Check. Why don't you D-up this time? Two-zip. Three-zip. Where's the D? Sleepy? Your knee hurt? Come to play? So now you wanna play? Now you're takin' off your brace, huh? Think that's gonna make you play better? Check. Two. Three. Three up. I don't hear you talkin'. I don't hear you. Point. All's fair in love and basketball, right? Double or nothin'. All right, ladies and gentlemen... let's stand and welcome your Los Angeles Sparks! Fifteen and six on the year, five in a row. Let's meet tonight's starters. At one forward, 6'1", from the University of Florida... number eight, Dalisha Milton! At guard, 5'7", USC, number thirty-two... Monica Wright-McCall!
