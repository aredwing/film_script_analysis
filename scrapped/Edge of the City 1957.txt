 

                        Excuse me. - Are you in charge here? - Yeah. I'm looking for a guy named Charlie Malik. He ain't here. He works the day shift. - Excuse me. - Yeah? Thing is, I'm looking for work. Nothing I can do for you, kid. You'll have to come back in the morning. Long-distance. Long-distance, what's the night rate to Gary, Indiana, please? - Person-to-person. - One moment, please. One dollar and 80 cents, sir. I want to call Gary, 2860. And I wanna talk to Mrs. George Nordmann. That's Nordmann. N- O-R-D-M-A-N-N. - Hello. Is this Gary, 2860? Yeah, that's right. Mrs. George Nordmann there? Yeah, she's here, but I wanna know who's calling. One dollar and 80 cents, sir. George, who is it? - It's him again. Operator... - Please, George, let me. Now, listen, Katherine, there's no point in your talking to him. Find out where the call is coming from. Tell him to knock this business off or I'll break his neck. Please. Hello? Axel, is it you? Hello. Hello, Mom. Hello. Axel? Is anyone there? I'm here, Mom. I miss you. - Operator? Operator? Yes? - No one answers. No one is there. - But the line is open, madam. But nobody answers. Where is this coming from? - New York. - Three times... San Francisco, Denver and St. Louis, and no one ever answers. Axel, please say something. I'm here, Mom. Mama, I want to talk to you. You quit this now, do you hear me? Haven't you done enough? You're killing your mother. Do you understand what I'm saying? You're killing your mother. The party disconnected, sir. Operator, I want to know exactly where this call came from. I'll check and call you, sir. Come on, Katherine. Come on. What did we do to him? What did we do to make him like this? We didn't do anything. It isn't our fault. What did we do? Hey, man, wake up. Hey, wake up. I don't know if you left a call with the desk, but it's about that time. - It's morning? - It is. Gendarmes are about, don't wanna get pulled in as a vag. Thanks. I didn't mean to fall asleep, I was waiting for the morning shift. Well, you're looking at a cat that's exactly seven minutes late for that shift. - You looking for a job? - Yeah. Listen, who do I ask for in the front office? Guy named Davis. You shouldn't have any trouble. If you do, ask for me. My name's Tyler. Should be okay, I got a contact inside named Malik. - Charlie Malik. Do you know him? - Yeah, I know him. And you don't need my help, good friend. Adios. Mr. Davis, he's been out four weeks with appendicitis. Here's a doctor's certificate. - You feel okay? - Oh, yes, sir. There's a lot of work to do out there. I don't want you to work unless you feel okay. - Oh, I'm okay. - All right, then. Get to work. Thanks. - Mr. Davis? - That's right. I'm a friend of Charlie Malik's. I was told I could get a job here. - Wallace, send Malik in here, will you? - Right away. - Pull up a chair, kid. Sit down. - Yes, sir. - You want coffee? - No, just a job. Here, take a look at this application. - Can you read and write? - Yes, sir. Well, you'd be surprised. We got some guys can't read and write. Well, they can read and write numbers, that's all. We can use them for truckers, but not for stevedores. Hey, you wanted to see me, Ray? I mean, a lot of work out there. Don't yell at me if it ain't done, you know what I mean? Friend of yours here, looking for work. Some friend of mine? Yeah. We met through Ed Fabre. Remember? Oh, yeah. - How is Ed? - Fine, fine, last time I saw him. - Where was that? - Frisco. - What's your name? - North. Axel North. Yeah. Yeah, this guy's all right. Yeah, he's a good man. You can start him off as a stevedore. You can put him in my gang, huh? - Okay. - Thanks. Don't let them send you anyplace else. You come right to me, huh? You gotta fill the application out in front of me. Sixty-day probationary, and then you have to join the union. Wallace. Wallace. - Put this man on with Malik's gang. - Okay, Ray. Thanks. Hey, Malik. Hey, Brother. Check that stuff, huh? Give me the clipboard. - I got the clipboard. Get out of here. Hold it, Pop, hold it. Let the gentleman through. All right. This guy will work for you. You do like he says. - Come on, you work on the trucks. - Wait a second. What? Well, I'd like to thank you for helping me get the job. This job pays you 1.71 an hour. For every hour you work, you pay me a quarter. - That's how you thank me. - Oh, I see. All right? Come on. Do I work here? - No, you work over there. - Charlie, you know, I don't understand. How do you get all these guys to work in your gang? You know, I could use some help too. I thought you could do everything yourself, hotshot. Touch. You don't know how lucky you are. I mean, it ain't everybody that can work in Charlie Malik's gang. I can remember when they didn't let guys like you work around here. You know that, hotshot? What kind of guy am I exactly, Charlie? A wise guy. Well, we sneak through every now and then, you know. Take that Williams' automotive lot over there. Six pieces. - Where do I get it from? - Over there, by the truck. Where do I take it to? First get it, then I'll tell you where, stupid. - Now, wait a second. - Wait a second what? Just because you got me this lousy job doesn't mean you own me, understand? You want this lousy job or don't you? You don't have to get rough about it, that's all. All right, I'll be real nice. Now, you get the Williams' automotive lot. Six pieces. Then find a hand truck and put it on the hand truck and you move. Okay, stupid? Okay, knock off. Let's play some rummy, huh? - Hey, Arab, you got the cards? - You okay? - Yeah. - You look beat. - Yeah, well, I'm all right. Why don't you come down to the waterfront and get some salt air? - It'll rejuvenate you. - I'll stay here for a while. - So who's dealing the cards? - I am, Charlie. So deal them, will you? We get a lousy 45 minutes for a lousy lunch. You still got those crummy cards too, haven't you? - I thought I told you to get new cards. - Tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow, tomorrow. Everything's tomorrow with this guy. Hey, North. - Wanna play some rummy? Uh, no, thanks. Exclusive. So deal them. - Hi. - Hi. - Join me. - Is it okay? This is Freedomsville, man. The guy who usually reserves this spot is out on the links today. Boy, you look beat. Have some soup, it's hot. Give you that strength. No, I think if I ate anything, I'd get sick. Well, a couple or three days, you'll be over that. - Hey, we never introduced ourselves. - My name is Tyler. Tommy Tyler. Everybody calls me Tee Tee. Tommy Tyler, Tee Tee, you dig? What's your name? Axel North. Axel. Axle grease. Ha-ha-ha. Grease job. Anybody ever call you grease job? Hey, where are you from? - Man, I ask a lot of questions, don't I? - Yeah. And you don't answer them, do you? - No. - Well, I'll keep asking them. You know why? I'll tell you. You'd think I was a guy just trying to make a living, wouldn't you? Well, it ain't so. Actually, I'm a rich millionaire doing this for kicks. I mean, really, I own from 23rd Street all the way down to Canal. I just do this to spy on the help. You see, last year, I only made $4 billion profit. And I got this gimmick figured to pay me 6 billion. So I gotta find out who's stealing from me, you know what I mean? Hey, you can laugh, can't you? Six billion bucks. That's... - That's funny. - Isn't that something for you? I tell you, boy, the funniest thing. Now, you take that Charlie, you gotta laugh. With a guy like him, you gotta laugh at him or beat his brains in. - Why? - Because. - That's the lowest form of animal life. - Yeah, maybe. No maybes. The thing is, a man's gotta make a choice. You know, I mean, there are the men, and then there are the lower forms. And a guy's gotta make a choice. You go with the men and you're 10 feet tall. You go with the lower forms and you are down in the slime. Well, what happens if you don't want to go with anybody? Then you are alone, man, and that's the worst. Hey, this is getting morbid. Let me buy you a piece of pie. - Come on. - No. No, I insist. You may not know it, but you are with the last of the big spenders. - No, I can buy my own pie. - Huckleberry or apple? Now, come on, huh? Hey, listen. - Thanks. - Thanks for what? Thanks for letting me in on your secret... ...that you own all the way from 23rd Street down to Canal. Well, just don't let it get around. Hey, kid, what are you doing? Can't you see this stuff is piled too high? Go to the ramp, get another truck and put that stuff on. - Where do I get it? - Out by the ramp. What do I have to do, follow you around? You know, we knock off here at 4:00. Go right out there. Charlie, why don't you take it easy with that kid? Well, why don't you mind your own business, huh? Charlie, in spite of your miserable, unpleasant exterior... ...I think there beats beneath the blackest heart in town. Oh, now that is funny. - So I got a black heart, huh? - Yeah, but I forgive you. Well, don't forgive me nothing, hear? - Yours. - Thanks. Look, you don't do nothing for that guy, you understand? Look, what difference does it make? Difference is I said so, that's the difference. - Listen, I mean... - Did you hear what I said? - Now look, I... - Did you hear what I said? You report here tomorrow morning, Now, I'd say he's a hard man to get along with, now, wouldn't you? I mean, of all the lower forms, he gets down under everybody. You gonna be here...? - Can I give you a lift? - No, no, thanks. I'm not quite sure I know where I'm going. - There's a Y up around the block there. - No, thanks. Hey, why don't you try up around my way? Lots of rooms for rent up there. All kinds of people live up there. Hey, what's with you, anyway? What do you want? I don't want nothing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. On second thought, I think I'd like it up around your way. Hi. Hi. You wanna see the masterpiece? - Hey, huh? - It's good. This is my boy. Picasso, say hello to Axel. - Hi. - Hi, how are you? Hey, you ever see anything like this, huh? Talent. I mean real talent, huh? - Yeah, fine. - Well, I gotta stick around a while... ...he wants to play some more. Okay, go ahead. Why don't you hang around? I'll drive around the neighborhood. No, that's all right, I can find a place. I live over there on the fourth floor, the front. You know. You should try around here, it's handy to the subway and stuff. Okay. - See you. - All right. - Hi. Hi. I didn't think you were gonna make it. The way my back ached, I didn't think I was gonna either. A couple or three days, you'll be over that. Here. - What's this? - An old one I had. Haven't used it since I got to be checker. You can have it. - It's a nice one. - They're all alike, man. I don't have the money, but I wanna pay you for it. Don't worry about it. Listen, I did something else too, I hope you don't mind. - What? - You know, this foreman, Wallace... ...he owes me a couple of favors, and I was talking to him this morning. Well... ...you can work in my gang if you want. Hey, North. Come on, knock it off and get to work, huh? Get that unclaimed stuff out of the cage. Thing is, Charlie, I was just telling Axel here he can work in my gang if he wants. - What are you talking about now? - Ask Wallace, it's okay with him. He's working for me. Let's give Axel the choice. How about that? I said he's working for me. You know what I mean? You're working for me. And I told you to stay away from this guy too. If you don't like working around here, you get out. But you work in this yard, you work for me, you understand? What difference does it make who I work for? Oh, it makes a lot of difference to Charlie here. I mean, he's of the opinion nobody should work for me. Yeah. Yeah, that's my opinion. Now, you get in that cage and get that stuff out like I told you. You still got a choice, Axel. I'm working for him. Axel. Hey, Tommy, pick up my lunch, will you? Hey, Linda. Will you bring Axel's lunch for me? - Move it over, Tee. - No, no, no. I've been chauffeuring you for three weeks. It's about time you earn your own keep. Now, come on. Yes, sir, sir. - Do you want your lunch, huh? - Please. - Oh, come on. - Come on? No. Hey, Mac. You ever play Slew Jay, Mac? Oh, man, come on. Hey, Mac. Come on. - That's it. Come on. Come on, throw it. Well, do you want a ride uptown tonight? No, thanks. What do you do with yourself nights, anyway? - Oh, I find lots of stuff to do. - This is a great town for a ball, huh? I mean, if you're a bachelor on the town, you could have a ball. It's great, huh? You know, I might ask my old lady for a night out once. You and I gonna pitch one. Yeah? No matter how good you're married, you always miss that freedom a little bit. - It's the greatest. - Oh, man. What stupid idiot writes this? Who can read this, anyway? I can read it, Charlie. - Oh, you can read it? - Yeah. Well, go ahead and read it. When Brother gets through with it, I'll tell you what it really says, Charlie. You gonna be a wise guy too, huh? Yeah, the two wise guys. The two wise buddies. Daddy-o and Pops. - Hey, Charlie, is this a T-H or a W? - I thought you could read it. Go ahead, get it on the truck, huh? You know, I can't understand how Ed Fabre sent a peculiar guy like you. Ed never sent a peculiar guy before. Maybe Mr. Fabre's a better judge of character than you, Charlie. Ask your buddy who Ed Fabre is, Tyler. - Go ahead, ask him who he is. - We got work to do. Ask him why he kicks back a quarter an hour, huh? - I said we got work to do. - Yeah. You know, Tee, I'm from Gary, Indiana. Yeah? Hear it's a nice town. Yeah, it's all right, I guess. And my name isn't really North, it's Nordmann. - Nordmann? - Axel Nordmann, yeah. I like North better. It's more American. And these days, it pays to be 110 percent American. Yeah, well, I just wanted you to know. I didn't want you to invite me over to dinner... ...and introduce me to your wife, you know? - You should know my name, you know? - Sure, I dig. So in my whole life, I loved only one person. My brother, Andy. Andy. Andy, well... Oh, Andy was the kind of a guy... Andy was the kind of a guy that everybody loved. But I was never, you know, jealous of anybody. Because with Andy... With Andy I was different. He treated me special. Like, sometimes, we didn't even have to talk to each other. I mean, we knew what each of us was thinking. - Did you ever have that with anyone? - Yeah, man. - Me and Lucy, boy. - Yeah. I mean, like... I didn't even mind when my mom and my pop favored Andy more than me. I mean, that was to be expected, you know? He was everything I wasn't, you know? Well, see, he had this great sense of humor, you know? He laughed all the time. And you know, whenever my old man got sore at me... ...Andy would come right by, boom, he'd joke him right out of it. Oh, man, he was great. Anyway, he died. I killed him. It was an accident. Andy got this car Pop got him for his 21 st birthday. I was only 17, I didn't have a license, but Andy wanted me to drive the car. I didn't ask him. He wanted me to, you understand? He told me it could do 95 on a straightaway. He kept on saying: "Go faster, Axel, go faster. Stand on it, baby, stand on it." He was wrong about it doing 95. I had it up to 98. Anyway, the tire blew, you know. I wasn't even scratched, you know. I had a bump on the head, that's all, and some sore ribs. My old man came over to the hospital. He grabbed ahold of me, and he said: "You killed him," and he hit me right across the mouth. It's funny, because that hurt me more than anything else when he hit me. I don't know, I don't know. I could never talk to my old man. In my whole life... In my whole my life, we maybe said three things to each other. Good morning, good night, and go to hell. I mean, it was all right while Andy was alive. The thing is, Tee... I don't know. He was the only person I ever loved. - Hey, come on, while I pick up my boy. - No, no, I'll wait here for a while. I want you to meet somebody. Ellen. - Ellen? Who's that? - Ellen Wilson. - That's her standing over there. - No, no. Yeah, she's a good friend of Lucy's. And they study a lot together. - Come on. - No, I'll wait around. We have a very important game going. Do you mind waiting? - You play ball. - Okay. Come on, I gotta hang around for a little while anyhow. You ever tried to break up a game of Red Rover? No. - Here. - Thanks. Ellen, this is Axel. Axel North. This is Ellen Wilson. - We just met over a basketball. - Yeah. Now you got it. Come on, let's make this one, me and you. Let's make this one you and me. Look, I made my penance for staying out all night. Besides, a handsome cat like me asks an old ugly chick like you to dance... ...you can't afford to turn him down. Come on. Hey, Axel, would you believe it? This old ugly chick and me used to win contests up at The Track. - What's The Track? The Track? What's...? - The Savoy Ballroom, man. Every Sunday and Thursday night. "What's that?" Didn't I tell you he was a square? A natural born. I bet if he had a girl, he'd show you a thing or two, wouldn't you? I'd cut you right down to size, Tee. I mean, I really would. You move pretty bad, you know. Well, I mean, put down by my wife, and slandered by my best friend. I'll get the door. - Axel, come help me move the table. - Oh, sure. - I'm glad you came tonight, Axel. - Oh, so am I. You know, Tommy doesn't have many real friends. I'm just glad. Even when I keep him out almost all night? Talking. - Oh, hi. Something's spilling over. - Hi. - You two know each other, don't you? - Yes, yes. - Hello, Axel. - Hi, how are you? Fine, thank you. Where are the kids, Tommy? Oh, you noticed how quiet it was, huh? They're downstairs with their grandma. - See, it's her Thursday night to suffer. - Tommy. Help me carry things in. I'll do it. Dinner will be ready in a minute. Hey. You didn't tell me she was staying for dinner. Maybe I didn't know, Jack. Would it kill you if she stayed to dinner? - You should've told me, that's all. - Why don't you relax? I mean, this is just a girl... ...just an ordinary girl with the usual equipment. About 5'5", like any normal American girl. With nine college degrees. - Ha-ha-ha-ha! - I'll belt you. Well, would you do me a favor for once, I mean? - If I can. - All right, just for kicks. I know you're a genius. I thought maybe you could like him a little. - I mean, give it a chance. - Lucy. Just be casual. - Casual? - Casual and a little sexy. - You know what I mean? - Not really. All right. Just as a special favor to you. There's my mother when she was younger. That's a nice shot. Yeah, that's my aunt. She's out in the west end of town. Hey, dig this one. Guess who. - That's you? - Yeah. I guess dinner's served. Then this so-called expert from the commission had the nerve to say: "If the Puerto Ricans are so concerned about sub-level housing... ...and lack of employment, they should show more constraint in emigrating." I know that idiot. Remember, we heard him speak at the settlement house? - I wanted to throw something at him. - Axel. Have you ever heard such a long, dull, drawn-out discussion? It's been going on for a half an hour. I don't know, it was very complicated. - I was very interested. - Thank you, Axel. The trouble with your friend Tommy... ...is that he's suffering from a deep guilt complex. Guilt? Who, me? What for? For cutting off my brilliant career just as it was about to come into full flower. Look, let's get out of here, if we're going someplace. Come on, Ellen. As two members of the submerged class of women, we'll do the dishes. But under protest. Now, us men will retire to the drawing room... ...for brandy and cigars. Now, these are important, good friend. I mean, these are the good things of life. Now, if I want to make-believe this is 20-year-old brandy... ...instead of 98-cent blueberry wine, who gets hurt, right? Twenty-year-old brandy? If you miss those 42nd Street movies, I can always turn on the television. - No, thanks, these cigars are bad enough. - Ah, ah, ah! Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. I love this perfecto perfecto. Perfecto. Three perfectos. - Perfecto perfecto perfecto. - Perfecto perfecto. What are you looking at? Oh, just measuring you. You're about at ...with two-and-a-half to go. - It's that easy? - Didn't I tell you? It's just making-believe. No, man, you are. Sure I am. Hey, come on, dance, will you? Come on, it's easy. - Boy, this is a crazy place. - I've been here before, though. It's fun. Yeah, but it's a crazy place, though. - You want another drink? - No, thanks, this is fine. I'm drinking rum, you know. I never drank rum before. I was in Puerto Rico last summer. That's what everybody drinks there. Yeah, well, it figures, I suppose. I mean, rum in Puerto Rico... Yeah, I'm sorry I can't dance like that. Well, it's fun to watch too. Can you dance like that? Well, living and teaching up here, you learn. I'm sorry I can't dance like that. - Do you want to try? - Are you kidding me? No, really. Come on, try. - Well, what do I do? - Well, it's easy. I'll show you. Okay. Hey, this is okay. Hey, Tee, watch this one. Pretty good. Pretty good. Watch this. Hey. - Killer, huh? Hey, that's great. Come here. Hey. Hey, Mac. Hey, don't we...? No. - Yeah, sure, sure. Aren't you...? - No. I'm sure of it. Hey, aren't you...? Frank Bennett. Bennett, huh? Look, I know, I know... - Bennett? Frank Bennett? - Look, Mac, I don't know you. At Frisco. - Hey, what's the matter? - I gotta get out of here. Axel. - I know the guy. But I know the guy. Well, good night. It was a lot of fun. - I'll talk to you tomorrow, Ellie. Night. Walk her to the door. - Go ahead, walk her to the door. - I'm listening. And ask her for another date. - You didn't have to come up. - Yeah. Axel, I had a wonderful time. Thank you. Yeah, it was a lot of fun. Hey, listen, I'm sorry about that guy tonight. I'm sorry it happened at the ballroom. I mean, I just hate guys walking up to you like that. - You know, he must have been drunk. - Well, I understand. Axel, will I see you again? Yeah, yeah, I suppose so. I mean, yeah, I'll see you around. Good night. Axel, you are murder. I mean, you are really murder. - Tommy, let him alone. - You should be on my side. Do you know he didn't want to walk her up to the door? Now, what's such a big deal? It's only a few steps from the car. - Oh, man. Oh, boy. - Will you quit it? I bet you didn't even ask her for another date. Listen, I didn't even ask her for this date. Axel, you depress me. Will you please shut up and leave me alone? - Ohh. - Tommy. Will you just leave me alone? I mean, I can handle my own affairs. Oh, Jack, you handle them great. You're gonna go down in history as the greatest lover there ever was. - Listen, now. - Whoo. Hey, North. - I think Davis is looking for you. - What for? Something about your questionnaire. I told him to take a look at it. Now, you get off my back. Make me. Hey, fight. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Come on. - Charlie! Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello. Hello, Ellen? - It's Axel. - Oh, hello. If you're not doing anything tonight... ...would you like to go bowling with Tommy, Lucy and I... Me? But, Axel, I'm a terrible bowler. Wait a minute, if you don't mind my not being good, I'd love to come along. - She says she'd love to come along. - So tell her you'll pick her up at 8. Hello, Ellen? Ellen? - Yes? - It's Axel again. - Listen, 8:00 okay? - That's fine. - Fine. - All right, then, 8:00. Eight o'clock. - Okay. - Okay. - Well, goodbye. - Well, goodbye. There now, that wasn't too difficult, was it? No, that wasn't too difficult. Hey, Wild Bill, which way did he go? - That way. - That way, here we go. How are you doing? Hi. I'm sorry I kept you waiting. - Hello. Hello. Listen, I hope you brought the deeds to the house and the land, honey... ...because we are going to ruin you tonight. - You will, you will. - Ten cents a game. Yeah, 10 cents of mine. Ten cents of mine. I'm gonna bet... Now, wait a minute. - Wait. - We got beat by amateurs. - You're telling me. - Forty cents, 40 cents you owe us. We want the money now or we're gonna take you to court. You mean they didn't pay up? No, no, sporty here mumbled something about being broke. - We want the money. - We want the money. - We want the money. - We want the money. - Shh! Quiet. - We want the money. The money. Somebody else lives in the house besides us, you know. - I'm thinking of my reputation. - Some reputation. Say, tell me again how great you bowl when you're out with the fellas. How many times have I tried to teach you to spin the ball? I'll spin you the next time you keep getting in my way. You'd better give us the money. - The baby coughed during Sid Caesar. - She must be getting a cold. - She wouldn't if you took care of her. - I think I'd better take a look at the baby. I almost missed Sid Caesar. Ma, this is Axel North. Axel, this is Mrs. Price, Lucy's mama. - How do you do? - Hello. I don't like it when I miss Sid Caesar. And from now on, Monday night sitting is out, Tommy. Well, this one time was a little unusual, Ma. You don't have to look at the set anymore. - I mean, the movie's over. - It's a comfort. Well, it's getting a little late, Mama. I could hear the audience laughing while I was attending the baby. If you wanna stay for coffee with us, you're welcome to. You know that I don't drink coffee. And Lucy don't keep chicory around anymore. - She's cute. - I think I'll make some coffee. How come you don't keep chicory around anymore? - Take your coat? - Oh, yes, thank you. Thank you. Wambo! Right in that one-three pocket. Boy, I got that double when we really needed it, huh? - Pretty good, huh? - You were wonderful. And I wasn't too bad, now, was I? Bad? You were great, you were just great. If I could get that approach, so it's smooth... ...then get the twist of the wrist. - It's easy. Look, just do what I told you. You just... Come over here, over here. Put your feet together, get relaxed. Now, you bring the ball back. You bring the ball back, like... I... Anyway, I had fun, you know. - I really, I mean, I had a lot of fun. - Oh, Axel, so did I. I don't remember when I've laughed so much. Yeah, well, I haven't bowled in years, but it's a lot of fun, though. We should do it again sometime. I'd love to any night but Friday. I have classes on Friday nights. Swell, then we'll do it. - Okay. - Okay. Hey, Tee, will you stop lurking back there? Who's lurking? Man, it's too early in the morning to feel that good. You know, I mean, it was 3:00 before I got to bed. Look, I feel great. Yeah, laughing and singing coming down in the car. You know, a cat could get arrested for feeling so good so early in the morning? Oh, get that Johnson stuff off first, because we missed it yesterday. Right, right. Hey, Nordmann. - Nordmann? - How did you find out about me? How did you know my name? I wrote to Ed Fabre. - Well, Ed wrote back. - So? So from now on, things are gonna be a little different around here. Number one, I take 50 cents an hour. Two, you're coming back to work on my gang. No, I'm not. That whistle goes in five minutes. You report to me, huh? Hey. - Hey, what did he want? - Nothing. Don't tell me "nothing," now, what did he want? Tee, what's it matter? It's all up now, it's all over. Hey, where are you going? I gotta get out of here. Either that or I gotta go work for him. - You're not gonna do either. - Don't. - Listen, listen to me. - Now, let me go. You're not gonna get out of here, you're not gonna work for him. Enough of this. All right? Now, what's the matter? - Maybe it's none of your business. - Well, I'm making it my business. Now, listen to me. Look, man, if you can't tell me, what good is the whole thing? You can't be scared of Charlie. You can't run away from... - Boy, if you are scared, you're dead. - Just get out of my way. You have to lay me out first. - All right. - Go ahead. Go ahead and hit. Go on. Make-believe I'm Charlie, huh? Make-believe I'm your father. What's the matter with you? Just get away from me. Wait, stop. Man, don't you know that you gotta have faith? Just a little faith. Charlie, he's nothing. I mean, he can't hurt you. He can't hurt you. Like, in my life, Charlie ain't that much. Well, that's the difference between us, Tee. Because in my life, it's all Charlie. Look, Tee, I'm in trouble. I can go to jail for 20 years. Now, let your faith buy me out of that. - Oh, hi, Axel. - Hi, Tommy home? - Sure, come on in. - No, thanks. - I think I'll wait here for a while. - Okay. Tommy? Yeah? - Tommy, Axel's here. Hi. Tommy, you wanna go for a walk? Sure. I'll get my coat. The thing is, Tee, about a year ago... About a year ago, I went into the Army. I enlisted, you know. I wanted to do something good. I figured, in the Army, well... I figured, in the Army, I could do something. If I made sergeant, I could go home. The thing is, Tee... ...a guy has gotta do something before somebody can love him. Where did you get a crazy idea like that? I'm telling you, that's the way it is. My old man, boy, he was a cop, boy. And he was rough. And if I learned nothing else, I learned that. A guy has gotta prove himself first. You're wrong, you're so wrong. I'm not wrong, Tee. Now, look, why else would I be this way? Why else would I be chasing around looking for something? I don't know. Now, why are you? In the Army, it was like everything else. There was a guy. He was my sergeant. He was always pushing me. He's like Charlie, you know? Always riding me. I couldn't take it any longer, Tee. So I... Tee, I busted out. Do you hear me? Don't you understand what I'm saying? Sure, I do. That you deserted from the Army. Look, I can go to jail. The police are after me, the Army's after me. So, what's the difference if I work for Charlie or not? You're in trouble, but you got a couple of things mixed up. Yeah. First of all, it's important to me what happens to you. Don't you understand that? Man, I'm your friend. Axel. - Look, I know this is a crazy time. - Well, come in. - I hate to bust in on you like this... - Oh, come on in. - May I take your coat? - No, no. - First, I wanna tell you something. - Let me take your coat. First I wanna tell you something. My name isn't really North, it's Nordmann. Axel Nordmann. And six months ago, I deserted from the Army. I just wanted you to know that. Now may I take your coat? Hey, Charlie. Charlie, look, I wanna tell you something. Yeah, you do. No, Charlie, see, I just want to tell you I don't care anymore, that's all. Well, I don't care whether you care anymore. - You just get that load out, huh? - Okay, what's next? Frank Brill and Company. Ten pieces. Hey, then get the Village Five and Dime. - Seven pieces. - Yeah, okay. Hey, North. That's it, keep smiling. I like to see my workers happy. - Hey, Brother. Yeah? - Here's a truck for you. - That's my truck. - Take a walk. - Yeah, get another truck, North. I said that's my truck, get out of my way. Wait a minute, Charlie, wait. - I've had about enough out of you. - Well, come on, Charlie, come on. - Yeah, come on. Come on. - Come on. Yeah, come on. Come on. Cut it out, he'll kill you with that thing. Hey. Isn't this crazy? On a nice day like this, you want to fight? Charlie, I thought I dug you, but I guess I was wrong, huh? You don't want to get blood all over this nice, clean shed, huh? And you simmer down now. You don't wanna hurt Charlie. Tyler. Tyler, you're the blackest ape I ever saw. - It's me you really want, isn't it? - Yeah, black. Now, Charlie, I don't want to fight you. - You're black. - Tommy. Blackie. Tommy. Tommy. Charlie. Charlie... ...this doesn't make sense. Tommy. Tommy. Tommy. - Tommy? - I'm all right, I'm all right. Tommy. You keep your mouth shut, Nordmann. You just keep your mouth shut. - Why didn't you let me...? - No, it was my fight. No, it was my fight. - It was my fight. - No, it was my fight. What are you scared of, Pop? You didn't see anything? Okay, go on. What are we gonna do with these guys? What could I say? It was a fair fight. Got a light? - Yeah. - So you say you didn't see anything? - How can I see anything? You work 20 feet away from where it happened. - How could you miss it? - I don't know. I must have been off sneaking a smoke, washing my hands or something. - You wash your hands often? - Yeah, about 10 to 15 times a day. - I'm very clean. - So you don't know anything? I told you, he must have tripped and fell. - That's what I figure. Sure. Okay, beat it. But we're not through with you, understand? Look, officer, I'm a law-abiding citizen. - I like to see justice done too, you know. - Sure, sure you do. All right, next. - All right, what's your name? - Stern, Harry Stern. - Did you see the fight? - No, I didn't see nothing. I suppose you were washing your hands too. No, I think I was sneaking a smoke. I really don't know nothing, officer. - Get out of here. - Yes, sir. How about you? Like the guy said, he must have tripped and fell. So you don't know anything either, huh? Get out of here. All of you, get out. Don't you guys understand that by keeping your mouths shut... ...looking at me like I'm an enemy... ...you can only fall down like that guy did this morning and die? Don't you know that? Okay, we'll find out other ways. Let's get out of here. Like Pop said, it was a fair fight. Long-distance. - Long-distance? I want to call person-to-person to Gary, Indiana. I want to speak to Mrs. George Nordmann. Hello? Mrs. George Nordmann? - Yes. One moment, please. New York is calling. New York? Go ahead, sir. Hello? Who's there? Mom? Axel. Axel, it's you. Mom, are you all right? Of course I'm all right. Axel, why did you call all those other times and not say anything? Mom... Mom, I wanna come home. Yes. Yes, please come home. You father... George. Yes, Katherine? George. George, he wants to come home. Axel? Axel, are you there? Listen, you've got to talk to me. Your mom says that you wanna come home. Well, we want you to. Do you understand me? We want you to. I don't care what you've done. I don't care what kind of trouble you're in. I don't care anything about whatever's happened before. It's from now on that counts. Do you understand me? Listen, you've got to talk to me. The thing is, Axel, that we miss you. You're all we've got, and we miss you. Please, son, will you talk to me? Just say something. You can curse me or yell at me if you want to. I don't care, just please say something. Pop. You really want me? Ha-ha-ha. Axel, my son, have I ever lied to you? I mean, just forget whatever else might have happened. Did I ever lie to you? No, Pop, you never did. Well, then listen to me now. We want you to come home. I'm in trouble, Papa. I'm a deserter from the Army, I'm a bad guy. I'm in trouble, Pop. Well, we don't care. We'll work something out. Just please, will you come on home? Okay, Pop. Okay, Papa. I'm coming home. Tell Mama I'm coming home. - Yes? - Mrs. Price. We met the other night. I'm Axel North. - Is Lucy here? - Yes, she's here. Well, do you remember me? I was a friend of Tommy's. I'd like to see her, please. Yes, you can see her. She'll be right out. Axel. Oh, Axel. All I know is that the policeman came, and he said he didn't know anything. Look, Lucy, it happened, that's all. All right. It wouldn't help Tommy any, he's dead. That's the end. - Hello. - Hello. You going somewhere? I was, I was planning to leave. I'm going home. - Where have you been? - My room. We tried to phone you, but we didn't know your number. We wondered what happened to you. - We were worried. - Look, Lucy, what can I tell you? - He was my friend. - I understand. You don't have to say anything. Well, look, the reason I came up, I have some money. It isn't much, $50, $55. - I want you to have it... - No, no, no, we're not in bad shape. There's the insurance and the union welfare. - All in all, we'll be all right. - Well, what are you gonna do? I'll go to work. Tommy and I... We used to joke about my busted-up career. Actually, it wasn't a joke, really. Now I have the chance to prove whether I can do it or not. Well, look, I wanted you to have this money anyway. Axel, I wanna know. - Look, it wouldn't help to know. - Tell me. - No, it wouldn't do any good to know. - Tell me, tell me! - It was a fight. - A fight? The police said... - With whom? - What's the difference with whom? It was a fight with a guy. You mean Tommy wasn't killed... ...he was murdered? No, it was a fight. Now, Tommy could have killed him... No, no, no, Tommy would never fight. Well, what did this man do to him? - How did he get Tommy to fight? - You're making it worse, it doesn't help. Why don't the police know? Why don't they arrest the man? Ellen, tell her it doesn't help to know these things? - Why don't they arrest him? - They don't know who it is. - Do you know? Of course I know. I know. You know who murdered him? You know, and you're not telling the police? You're running away without telling the police? Look, Lucy. Lucy, you just don't understand. I understand. You let them kill Tommy. You're supposed to be his friend, but you're not. You never were. You're just like the rest of them. You're just like everybody else. Get out! Get out of here! You want me to have your money? What does that buy you? Take your white man's money and get out. Get out of here. Get out! What's gonna happen? Oh, Ma. Axel. Axel, please. Axel. Axel, please. Please. Please, don't run away. - Please, not from me. - She doesn't understand. - Then tell me! Tell me so I understand! - What could I do? It started, that's all! - You couldn't help Tommy? - No, I couldn't help him. Come here. - Mr. Davis. North. - Mr. Davis, I wanna talk to you. - Sure, sit down. No, thanks. I want you to do me a favor. Call that detective that was here this morning. - Detective? - That's right. Now, I know you know his name and I know you know his precinct. Okay. Charlie. - What? - I'm gonna take you in to the cops. - What are you talking about? - I said I'm gonna take you in to the cops. You know what you're doing, Nordmann? Yeah, Charlie, I know what I'm doing. Hey, Charlie.
