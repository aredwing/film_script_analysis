The judge asked the priest to bring the parrot to his house. He had two male parrots who were very pious. They sang praises of Allah all day long. Good company would make all the difference. The priest brought the parrot to the judge's house. The judge put the female parrot in the cage with the other parrots As soon as she went in, the parrots stopped reciting the prayers One smiled and turned to the other.. ..and whispered in his ear.. May l whisper in your ear? What did he say? "Stop chanting the Lord's name. Our prayers have been answered." Bury him. This is unfair, Mushtaq bhai. Why punish me for Khalu's treachery? l could have fled too but l didn't. l came back to you. Look Mushtaq bhai, believe me. Why are you guys in such a hurry? At least hear my last wish. Anotherjoke? No. A story! 1000 rupees a day. What's this? Does the Nawab come free with this? The suit belongs to the Nawab of Chandpur. He's on a Haj. That's why these are available. Shall l pack them both? - No. Just one. And a cheap tunic for him. Why bro? lf there's a Nawab there has to be his butler. You? A Nawab? - Yes. Great, Khalu. - No matter what you wear.. ..you will always look like a butler. Since when do you have these tremors? lt's just...few days. His hands have been shaking for a long time. And, it's noon now. You should watch him in the morning. lt's like an earthquake! Do you know what l do? l break 4 eggs in a bowl, and hand him the spoon. And a well-beaten, frothy omelet's ready. Come with me. - Yes? Come with me. Come. l was just joking. Where are you taking me? My grandfather. He's a well known physician. Would you like to consult him? l can't see it. - What's wrong, sir? Sir is saying that, these necklaces are terrible. So ugly they stink. What are you saying, sir? Sir, take a look at this. This. l'll call for the car. Pervez, get the car. And switch the AC on. Sir cannot tolerate the heat. Come, sir. - Sir... ..please feast your eyes on this. Actually, we cannot sell this officially. Why? This was stolen from the Nawab.. ..of Hyderabad, the one in Pakistan. lt's a priceless necklace, sir. But 100% cash payment. Yes. You'll get that. How much? - 5 million. Advance? - 500 thousand. Where's your toilet? Toilet? His majesty hides his cash.. ..in his undergarment. Jumman, kindly escort sir to the toilet? Have a look sir. How much can one carry in the underwear?

Okay? Khalu. Hey! Stop! Don't run. l'll shoot. Time to decide. lt's 4:30 already. What? Do l cut off your head or little one? What are you saying brother? lf l had a hint about Khalu's betrayal.. ..l wouldn't come here to die. Head or the little one? You are a fair person. We're related after all. Have pity on me. Head or the little one? What kind of an option is this? Japanese Gangsters cut off the fingers. You can take this one. Take both. Spare my little one. That's Japan. This is lndia! Toss a coin. lf its heads, then cut off his head. lf its tail, then cut off his organ. What is it? Tails! - Mushtaq bhai! Best of 3! Okay. lts tails on both sides! This is cheating. Why are you after my little one? What are you doing? Mushtaq bhai! Don't do this please! We're related. What are you doing? Take his pants off. Pull the string. Hey! - Hey! What are you doing Babban? l swear l will blow my brains out. This is wrong son. Hand me the gun. Hand me the car keys. - First the gun. Fine, don't. You'll be responsible for my death.

Where are you running to? There's nothing l didn't do for you. No, l.. - l did everything! Hello, Khalu. - Hello. Tired. - Totally out of breath. Run! - What? Run! - No, son. lf l run anymore, my heart will explode. Do you have a heart? Do you? - Babban! l said run. - No, no. l will die, son. l will die. Have mercy. - Mercy? Did you have mercy? You left me alone to die. - l didn't leave you. l was just protecting myself. Where is it? - What? Where is it? Necklace? - Necklace. Necklace? - Necklace? Necklace? - You hit really hard. Did it hurt, Khalu? - Yes. lt fell from my hands that day. Remember, when we fled that day.. He was firing at us? l fell in the gutter.. ..and dropped the necklace. l thought you noticed. - l didn't, Khalu. That's the problem with you.. You don't pay attention. l thought you'd pick up the necklace. And l ran to save my life. Why didn't you come to the graveyard to meet Mushtaq? Why would l? To have my little one chopped? ls yours intact? You think this is funny? l will call Mushtaq. He'll take care of you. No, no. Babban. You won't call Mushtaq. - Why? Because my imbecile nephew.. Look there. What do you think? Nice. Nawab Saheb you.. - Yes. Allah! Are you okay? - Yes, of course. Your nose is bleeding. Oh, l think.. Actually, l was running. What for? All those praises, l couldn't handle it. And l ran away. And anyway, your hospitality has been wonderful. l've been eating so much, that.. ..my system couldn't handle it. Let me see. Come inside. l'll apply something. - l.. No need to worry. lt's just a nosebleed. He'll be fine. There. And you are? - He's my butler. Name? Babban, introduce yourself. Babban. lmpudent. Come. - After you. The servants' quarters are behind the mansion. Bring your blanket and pillow after dinner. lf you stay there, then l swear.. ..l'll settle down permanently. ls it okay now? Yes. Thank you. - Give it. Thank you. Show me your palm. The right palm. What? What did you see? Let me show you. This is the love-line. There are too many cuts on it. You've been hurt in love, haven't you? You're an astrologer.. lt's just a hobby. But she's better than the professionals. Shush.. Really! Every word she says always comes true. l see. Don't believe her. She's a big liar. - Liar. Me? Tell me something else about me. Okay. You're about to enter the best phase of your life. All your illnesses will find a cure. You're hiding... something valuable. Babban! Click my picture with Begum please. My phone's battery is dead. My phone's charged. l'll click a picture. Give it here. l phone 2? How much did it cost? lf there's any chance.. ..of meeting after the evening.. You mean at night.. l mean.. And these days my nights depend on Yad-al-Jauza. Yad-al-Jauza? lt's a star, close to the moon. lt shines really bright. When l phone 5 is available in the market.. ..no one will buy this one even for free. Here, take a picture. lt'll be a bad one. l phone 5 is better. Can l click this? lt's got an 8 megapixel camera. Go ahead. Come a little closer. lt's cloudy these days. lf you see the star in the sky tomorrow night.. ..then feel free to watch it from the terrace. Smile please. And this.. Where did you steal this car from? No, no. l bought it. Really? - Yes. Why? - Why why? Because l'm no longer a thief. l see. Not a thief. What then.. l'm the.. ..thief's uncle. What the.. Can't you see the car? Khalu, get out! Sir, that's a tasty sandwich. Sorry, sir. What's this? You're bleeding. Get up. Sorry, the car lost control.. ..just like your heart. You have damaged my car. Better than the condition of my heart. Last few days, you've battered my heart without mercy. And you didn't even say sorry. Who's going to pay? - For what? For fixing it.. The fixing hasn't even begun yet, you son of a... Look at me. Stand straight. l must admit. You've got a romantic nature. Trying to win over the Begum. FYl She's mine. Only mine. Shatabdi Express. Train to Delhi, in 6 hours. Two seats in the AC compartment. The train leaves in the morning. Goodbye. Let's go. These tickets are waitlisted. So? You see... l wait for no one. That's not a problem. ls it? No, no. There's no problem. l booked it myself. Their seats will be confirmed by morning. lt'll get confirmed, l promise. "lf l said l lived by your word... that would be a lie." "For, if l had faith in you..." "...would not ofjoy l would die?" Wonderful. "lt's only my faith, nothing more.." "l can even swallow bitter poison.." "The only condition is.." "..that someone hold me in her arms when l pass on.." Why are you laughing? The word is 'liquor' not faith. Liquor as in booze. Sir, you want your faith with soda or on the rocks? How about you give us a peg too! Don't shoot off words when you can shoot bullets. lf anyone fires you will be shot too, Jaan Mohammad. lf l don't get you, Babban will. lf Khalu shoots, you'll die. lf l shoot, you'll wish you were dead. Nobody shoots! Ask your boys to throw their weapons. You first. - No. You first. That's not possible. - Fine. Let's all just stand here. l'm sitting. Brother. Jaan sir. l have to go. Just stand there. No, sir. l can't wait another minute. Or else... Put the gun down and go. Shall l? - Go on. Can l? Anyone else? "Give us inner strength, O Lord!" "To fight the evil inside." "Before we bow down to evil.." "We stand up for the good." Brother? Try to understand. Let them go. Stop here. Mister. ls this Salim tea stall? And you are? - Anarkali. The stage should be close to the main gate. Here. But this.. Okay. Kidnapping from such a big gathering is not an easy job. We have to get our target out through the crowd. Once the big door closes.. ..the police won't be able to follow us. And the police outside the door? We'll neutralise them before coming in. Where is the hideout? - Where is the advance? l. Yes.. l mean, in a day or two. Am l here for an interview? Qais! Brother.. The banks were shut today. Day after tomorrow, as soon as the bank reopens. "lf only life was simpler these days.." Tell me. Target's photograph. Scatter, you darn clouds. You fool clouds. lt's moving. Come on. Yad-al-Jauza! You wanted a girl, didn't you? This time you're sure to have one. Let your hand be! Tell your husband to stop hoping for that land. You will lose the court case. l tried explaining, but she doesn't listen. Where's Muniya gone off to? What's this? A small gift. Please accept. l can't take it. lt's too expensive. Fine, then l'll ask for something in return. Go ahead. Allow me to watch you while you rehearse. lt's been decades since l last saw you dance. What? Yes. l'm an ardent admirer of your dance. The Para you want to give this gift to.. ..has been dead a long time. And Mr. Deobandi hits bull's eye! He moves on to the next round. And now the last year's champion.. ..Mr. Jaan Mohammad Khan. Ready to fire. What a shot! Mr. Khan is an expert. Good one, Jaan sir. Now it's the Nawab of... from where? From Chandpur.. Mr. lftekhar Hussain. Taking his own sweet time. Probably nervous. Three. Two. One. Wow! Ace shot. lt's a fluke. lt was a fluke. - l'm sure. Hello. l phone 5. Which one? Chinese or American? Routes to the called station are busy! l'm holding the line. This facility is not available on your number. Press star to copy this song, then press 9! "My nights are restless." "l've to tell you what's in my heart." "And l say it today." "l love you!" What are you doing tonight? What are your intentions? Not good. Tell me something l don't know. l'll take you out for dinner. What cuisine? Your kind of stuff. And, what's my kind of stuff? Chinese. Really? - Yes. l know these things. Girls love poodles and are crazy about noodles. lt's true. l'll go to Shanghai if l want Chinese. To New York for burger. To Naples for pizza and.. ..creme brulee in Paris. Until then l'm rather happy with the mutton dal at home. Correct. - Get it? A little. And Mr. Jaan Mohammad does it again! This guy seems unbeatable! And only one man stands in his way to victory. The Nawab of Chandpur. He really has a weird style. Looks around, scratches his head. Looks like he's ready now. Ladies and gentlemen, hold your breath! Congratulations. Click a picture. Come on. Save some for yourself too sir. You never know when times change. Even if time changes, desires won't. My heart and it's little desires.. Don't forget. You will never let me forget. Everywhere l look in the mansion.. ..l see is your ledger books. How many times do l tell you? Last two years, l've been kneeling at your threshold. You think it's for money or property? No. The reason is love. With you. Allah knows l don't seek money or property. All l seek is freedom to breathe. Jaan means life, Para. Just as l can lay down my life for you.. ..l can take somebody else's. Enough! Enough, Begum! Enough! Calm down. "The peace that existed between us." "Whether you still remember or not." "The peace that existed between us." Who gave you permission to come in here? My heart. Leave. No. You come back. - What? Come back! To dance. You're mistaken, l.. Why are you being so cruel to yourself? "From whom, sweetheart, for whom?" "They keep me awake." "My wretched eyes, they steal my peace." Remember? Come on. - Begum! Come on. - Begum please. Get out. - Begum! Fine. Now let me show you how stubborn l am. l won't leave without knowing the reason. Why did you kill that Para? Every breath of her's would dance. Where is that Para l saw 25 years ago? At the town-hall, in Bhopal. On the auditorium stage. Your guru, Birju Maharaj was with you. That day, while dancing.. ..you became one with the dance. Where is that Para? "Keep me awake all night." "My wretched eyes.." "My eyes steal my peace." "Keep me awake all night." "Keep me awake.." "Keep me awake all night." "My wretched eyes.." "Keep me awake all night." "Jasmine earrings dangling from my ears." "And pearls.." "And pearls adorned around my wrists." "Pearls adorned around my wrists." "For whom, my beloved?" "For whom do l wear these, my beloved?" "Keep me awake all night." Begum? Begum! Khalu! You think l can't catch up with you? You're really think you can get away? l swear, wait till l get my hands on you. l will shred you to pieces.. ..and feed you to the crows. Can you here me? Hello Babban here, who's speaking? Flaunting your English, are you? Have you forgotten your manners? Look up. Why are you talking on the phone? lncoming calls are free. l'm the one being charged for it. l am a Nawab. l follow etiquette even in war. l'll stick your etiquettes up your behind. Why did you lie to me? - l didn't lie to you. l just didn't tell you the truth. Don't confuse me. You said you fell in the gutter.. ..and the necklace fell in the gutter too. True. l fell in the gutter, and the necklace fell there too. Then l climbed out of the gutter and picked it up. Come down, and l will kick you all the way to heaven. l'm better off here. You can come up if you like. - Fine, l'm coming up. Throw down the ladder. - You throw the knife first. Enough of this! Throw down the ladder. The breeze is really nice up here. Come up if you can, otherwise goodbye. Why did you hang up? Hello! l'll stay here all night, l mean it. Look...look.. Babban. Don't get angry. Listen to me. Let me explain. Look at my decency. l could've killed you in your sleep. But you are like my son.. Son.. - What son? You left me to die. l was about to get circumcised again! Mushtaq came after me with such a big knife! Left me! Left me! Stop repeating that. Listen to me. The day we stole the necklace... Khalu! Run! At the graveyard at 3:30. Stop. l'll shoot. (lNAAM ALl DRY CLEANERS) lt's been half an hour. l hope he hasn't kicked the bucket? Your affliction lies in the region of your heart. Okay. You're burdened with sorrows. A wound in the past? A regret or remorse? Stay cheerful and happy! That's your cure. Drink from the vial of love! Find yourself a girl. And you will rid yourself of these tremors. God willing! l've always lived for others. First my father, then your aunt. Then Mushtaq bhai. Then sister and then you. Never got the chance to think for myself. So l finally decided.. ..l want to live for myself once before l die. lf l can't keep myself happy.. ..then how can l keep anyone else happy? But what about our little ones? That necklace was a gift. Now, if someone steals that necklace.. ..then, that's not my responsibility. l've heard that Begum's vault.. ..is filled with 10 necklaces, and 1000 gold coins. Khalu, you're going to steal in your own house. Not my house. My future in-law's home. Now l'll be spending the rest of my life here. l love you, Khalu. l love you too, Babban. Your mansion looks like a haunted house. Yes. l've grown used to it now. When you come after l'm married.. ..you'll get a separate room. Send some girls along, l won't mind. Mr. ltalvi. What do you say? Do l look like a Nawab? You do. But? - You are not. But l am not one. l wear the jewels of Begum's late husband. His turban. And his sword too. Touch it. ls this the color of your blood too? Red! So what is it that.. l don't have with me.. ..to become the Nawab of Majidabad? DNA! - What? All the people born in this world.. ..have completely different and unique.. ..sets of DNA, and they always will. How wonderful! You solved an old mystery of my life. What? There's a canal at the heart of this city. On one side of the canal is the mansion. Belonging to the Nawab. And on the other side, the rest of Majidabad. On the other side, whenever l would set out.. ..the people would lower their eyes. Out of fear. And when the Nawab stepped out.. ..people bowed down. Out of respect. Ask why? - Why? NDA. - DNA. Whatever. Now, how do we change it? Everyone's born with it. lt can't be changed. What are you saying? These days you can.. ..change your nose, ears, kidney.. - You can't change this! You're angry with me, that's why you're lying. l have a lot of money. l'll give you anything you want. Promise? - Promise. ln ltaly. We can try out there. Might find it. Fine. We'll both go and get it changed. - When? As soon as Begum chooses me as her husband. We'll catch a flight, first-class tickets. What if she doesn't? Then you will go alone. ln a casket. You fool. Get up! Come on! How dare you? Load them in! Walk, get in. Evening tea will be served in jail. Aladdin's lamp? Books everywhere! Greetings. Nawab Saheb... had stepped out.. ..for his evening stroll. He didn't return for a long time. So l was looking for him. l was just passing by when.. ..l saw that your vase was unsteady. So l caught it. Otherwise it would've shattered. l think its porcelain. Oh, it's you? What if it had shattered? lt would've crashed loudly. And everybody would've woken up, crazy girl. And you would've been caught. Red-handed. You're fortunate... that everyone's asleep. Except for me. How about l put you to sleep? Forever? Keep this to yourself. Otherwise l will cut your tongue out. l'm warning you. Cut. Cut me. For the first time in my life l can't decide. What? Whether l got some or gave some? Get up. lt's morning. Don't you have to go? l do. Where? From Honolulu to Timbuktu to Paris.. ..to New York to Moscow to Tokyo. With you. With me? Yes, with you. There's still time for that. What will you do until then? Whatever you say. Will you graze goats? Yes, l will graze goats. Will you swat the pigeons? Yes, l'll do that too. Drive a jeep? - Drive a jeep too. Kidnap someone? Do what? l won't make that mistake again. l won't do that. You won't be able to do it anyway. Come on. Hey! Police from 5 states are after me. There's a big reward on my head. On your head? - Yes. And on your little one? Are you okay? Go and take a shower. Go on. Khalu! Wake up! The night is over, forever. Wake up. - Let me sleep, you imbecile. Have been awake all night. Just shut my eyes. Get up Khalu. Where were you all night? Getting screwed. That happens often, tell me something new. What happened? l went to steal the necklace. But l swear, l got my hands on a diamond. What did you do? Nothing yet, but l got to. - What? lt's a fantastic plan. - What? Ask how much. We'll get 50 million atleast. You're up to no good again. Just tell me if you're in on the plan. Otherwise l am not discussing this. Listen to me very carefully. lf you harm Begum, l will kill you. Last warning! l've seen you losing it in love before. But for the first time l'm watching you all screwed up. Thank you. - What for? For telling me, that l am close to my destination. l am on the sixth stage of love. There are seven stages in love. Attraction. lnfatuation. Romance. Reverence. Worship. And Obsession! Obsession means snafu! When she finds out the truth.. ..she'll shove these stages up your behind. That won't happen. Why not? Because this time.. ..it's true love. Mine...and hers too. Fine. Then tell her the truth. Fine, l am going. - Okay, go. l am going. Where are you going? - Let me take a bath first. Then l will go tell her. - l see. The bathroom's this way. l'm switching on the geyser. l see. Now? - Let the water heat up! Greetings. Just a few days left for the celebrations to end.

Look... l am in love with you. True love. Really. That... That's the problem. With you boys these days. You can't tell the difference between love and sex. lsn't it?

But don't try to scare me with love. So, please stay away. What.. What are you doing? So, you duped me to get your job done? Look...you will get your share of the money. Leave me. - You think l'm a whore? Wham-bam thank you ma'am! - Let go. You think l did it for money? l did it for you, you wretch. Get that. Now l don't want the money either. l will show the world who you really are. The ugly truth behind this pretty face! Let go. Muniya! Are you okay? (Local Radio Announcement) We're now at the seventh stage of love. What's that? Death. Here you go. Once more.. lt's cold down here. Lets ask them for some heat. Careful! You promised, Jaan Mohammad! You will let me go once the Begum chooses you. You're going back on your word, fool. Face me if you can. Bloody hell! Hello, Boss. - Yes. Rafiq. This is the vegetable market. These guys are professionals. l'm sure they have Begum somewhere secure. l am from ltaly. My mother and Sonia Gandhi studied together in school. lf my mother finds out, you'll be dead. Should l come back brother? - Okay. You.. Another word and l blow your brains out. l see. Do it. Blow my brains out if you can. Shoot! Look, ltalvi. l'm warning you. You fraud Nawab! Hello Superintendent sir. Make special tea for sir. Greetings, Liyaqat bhai. Qais, you? You're still in jail? l'll escape from court today. l've bribed these scoundrels. - What? Sir. lftekhar Hussain aka Khalujaan. And Razaq Hussan aka Babban. They work for Mushtaq Qureshi in Bhopal. Put the money back in the bank. Begum Para is our responsibility. l think l told you not to do anything. Sir, it's our duty. Can't you understand the language? Sir. l can arrest you for misbehaving.. ..with a police officer on duty. Why you.. you will arrest me! Sir. Sir. Sir. - You will arrest me? Sir. Sir. Sir. - Me. Jaan Mohammad. You scoundrel. Wait a sec, sir. - You Mother.. Look who is here to see you. Greetings, brother. Just a few hours more. Once we get the money... ..you are free to go, with your share. l regret that you got involved in this mess. lf you really love me then please eat it. lftekhar. Love is not for me anymore lftekhar. l can be someone's well-wisher. Someone's confidant, friend.. But not a lover. But you can be an imposter. A cheat! l wish l could tell you why. Well... you could try explaining. l will try my best to understand. Really? - Yes. Really. My husband, Nawab Mir Khan Sahab.. ..had no interest in women. He would spend his days drinking, gambling.. ..and in the company of young boys. l tried to separate from him. But no one supported me. Neither my family nor anyone else. l fell ill. Doctor's advice or medication.. ..would not have an effect on me. My life is indebted to Muniya. She's my friend, sister and my soulmate. Then, one day. The Nawab passed away. His death set me free. But made me a pauper. He had mortgaged his entire property with the bank. All his life, he squandered borrowed money. Jaan Mohammad extended his hand to save me. But on the condition of marriage. He had just one dream. To be the Nawab of Majidabad. Life served so many blows.. ..that l had to give a fitting reply. So, what now? Where will you go with all the money? Where the past can't catch up with me. Far. Far away. Shall l send you right away? Will you go alone, or take that girl with you? Muniya! She isn't here. - No. Muniya! Bhai. Bhai. - What? Bhai. Phone. lt's him. Hello? - ls the money ready? Yes. Where do l deliver it? Come to the bookstall.. ..at the railway station. By 12pm. Okay. - And, listen. l'm speaking from Ghanta ghar area. Don't waste time sending your men around. Come on time. l don't like people turning up late. Muniya! - Stay there. Don't move. Babban. Look, Babban! Things have gone terribly wrong. Jaan Mohammad knows about our entire plan. What? Khalu, we won't get the money now. He will kill us. - Yes. We should run away. Yes you are right. What do you think? Please. Believe me. l'm telling the truth. Muniya! Your charade won't work with me anymore. Try your luck in Bollywood. You'll be a big star. (Railway Announcements) Boys get in. Get in the car. Jaan sir. Someone left this note for you. Go to the water faucet no.2 on platform no.1 . Pick up the trash can close to it. (Majidabad to Bareilly.) Rafiq. - Yes, Jaan sir. Nainital Express. To Bareilly. Okay, Jaan bhai. We'll be there. Tea. Hot tea! Tea! Sir, tea? lt's only a hundred bucks sir. Have a cup. l said l don't want it. 100 rupees, please. Read it. Tea. Hot tea. Get down at Bap station, after Lakhimpur. Even if no one gets off, you will. A goods train arrives in an hour. Board that and get out of here. Where is Para? She's inside. Bag. Here. What's the number on the lock? 9 2 1 1 . Welcome Nawab Sahab. ls it all there? Your problem is with me. They are innocent. Let them go. Okay. lf you say so.. Stop. - Stop it boys. Bring that Nawab here. Come madam. Come on. Begum Para is suggesting that l let you go. That you are innocent. Are you? lt seems to you that l'm the only bad guy around. Everyone else is innocent, just like these two. l chased you with all my money, pride and my heart. And you danced to the tune of this imposter's stolen poetry. My poetry is not stolen. lt's original. l see. And your dance? l never saw it. Come, let's see you guys jam together. Move aside, make some space. Move back. - They're going to dance. Well, your goods train is arriving. The plan was to throw you two in front of it. But, if you manage to pull off the performance.. ..then the next train leaves at night. What time? - 7:30. Lets begin. Begin! - Jaan bhai. l'm sick of this poetic stuff. Let's make them dance to a film song. l don't know any film songs. You're joking, right? l'm sure you know that.. "Anarkali's off to the disco?" l think this one's better. "Let's go to a disco." Jaan bhai.. "All my lovers.." "Shiela's youth.." Don't move! lf you move l'll blow your brains out! Tell your men to let these three go. What? Let these three go. Let them go. - Jaan bhai. Here. Stop the train and you two leave. Babban. You go. l'm not going. You go. l cannot leave without her. Khalu, l can't leave without her either. We'll miss the train, try to understand. You're repeating the same thing. l won't leave Muniya, l mean it. Okay, how about.. Fine, fine. - Stay back. Hand me the gun, you two leave. This is our matter. You two leave. l have an idea. Khalu, you leave with Begum Para. Muniya and l will handle them. l cannot leave without Muniya. And, l won't without you. l am holding the pistol. You three leave. - No. At this rate nobody will leave! Decide who's going! The train's arrived. "The peace that existed between us." "You may remember, you may not." "The peace that existed between us." "You may remember, you may not." "The promise of being together." "You may remember, you may not." Babban. "Those little complaints, those new regrets." "Those enjoyable stories we made up and told." "That show of anger over every little thing." "You may remember, you may not." Stop. Run! Jaan Muhammad? You wanna be Nawab! (One and a half months later) - Freedom is the most beautiful.. ..and valuable gift of life. And any price paid for it is less. l attained freedom, but you paid the price for it. l thought lovers like you can only be found in the movies. l pray to Allah to give me.. ..the strength to love with such intensity. Love? l wasn't worthy of your love. You will find a better girlfriend than me. But if you're unfortunate.. ..then we'll run into each other again. Between Honolulu to Paris. Somewhere. Your gift didn't buy the skies for me. But it was enough to make our own small world. We don't have all we wanted but we have all we need. Life stands still in our little world. Visit us sometime. We'll sit like statues. Good news, you've been granted bail. Who bailed us out? - Your wife did, get lost now. Khalu, didn't l tell you? They love us. Your wife.. Khalu, get me married. We'll go to Honolulu for honeymoon. Any last wish? We want to sing a 'Thumri'. "l sit adorned. " "Completely out of breath." "Where's my beloved?" "l've kindled the lamps on the roof. " "But, my beloved hasn't turned up yet." "Which other woman... is trying to entice him?" "Come to my roof, O beloved." "So l can steal a glimpse of you." "Come to my roof, O beloved."
