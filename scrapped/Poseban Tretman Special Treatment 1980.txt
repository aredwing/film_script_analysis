Somebody could have saved you. No one even tried when I wanted to kill myself. The train simply stopped. - Yes, in real life. The sound of a train draws me to the tracks, and... If she misses her cue, that's all right. But why are you throwing out so much smoke! We are choking. - The valve's broken. We'll rehearse the show after dinner. This was our therapeutic psychodrama. But we must help other alcoholics. This outing is your test in the real world, full of temptations. I hope you won't let me down and that there won't be any incidents. I want us to part as friends at the end of this treatment. Sorry to disturb you. We have an emergency. Wait for me. I'll be right back. Who is on duty? - The doctor on duty went out. What happened? - Alcohol, smuggled in. Starring: Ljuba Tadic SPECIAL TREATMEN Featuring: What happened to you? - I got drunk, Doctor. What's the blood pressure? - 90 over 60. Very, very low. Like that... stretch. Screenplay by: Director of Photography: Also appearing: Where are you off to? - Off to get drunk. He was only joking. - Don't make such jokes. I don't want my treatment prolonged. We are taking our show on the road. We are spreading the G-g-g-gospel. Produced by: Directed by: Your colleagues are all against you. Professor, I'll prove them wrong. My patients will not fail me, regardless of the temptations. They know that this tour is the end of their cure and that their release depends on it. I understand, but... - Our patients will aid society, and won't be outcasts. They won't feel rejected. One day, they'll lead others along the right path. You know best what harm alcohol brings. Alright, I'm not against you. I backed you up at the meeting. Do you want a policeman to come along? - No way! Let them get used to freedom. - Please be very careful. We can't afford bad publicity. This hospital is for compulsory treatment. He's dragging his son along again. Don't you like kids? - Only boiled or fried. The child is motherless. - Hush! Be quiet. Farewell and please take care. Where are your things? - In the bus. Are you ready? - Yes. Get in. Can the boy sit with me? - Yes. Miss Jelena, read me Red Riding Hood. Of course, Dejan. Thirty years gone by Thirty years of folly I don't give a damn My future will be jolly. Not those saloon songs. This scenery deserves something glorious. Snack time! Marko, pass the apples. Apples are therapeutic. Steve, stop here. Now, walk. Now, jog. Now, fly like a bird, like a bird. Let's order. Mila? - Mineral water. Mineral water. - Mineral water. Mineral water. - S-s-same. I'll settle for anything. - Be serious. Juice for my son and a beer for me. Let's have a little chat. Alright, I ordered beer, and you didn't. Tell me why? Because we are alcoholics... ex-alcoholics. Without the will-power to resist alcohol. What do you think, Mila? - Well, I think... well... If we ordered one beer, then we would want a 2nd and a 3rd. And many more. Marko? B-b-basically we have no will-power. Why do we always refer to the concept of will? Rade? You taught us that a backbone is... is... That a strong will is the backbone of man's character. That's what you taught us. Daddy, I have to poo poo. Waiter, come here. Bring us the pig from the spit and don't carve it. Bring it in one peace. As you ordered. O.K. Let's make a wager. If I don't eat the whole pig, I'll lose the bet. But, if I do, you'll lose the bet and carry me home on your hands. - O.K. Folks, I could eat half the pig. - Don't be silly. Wanna bet? - You're pigs! Use your own mind. Don't be the Doctor's parrot. Suckling pig's are a delicacy, you fucking driver. Don't insult me or I'll kill you. - Just try. You think you're better than us? - Just look at yourselves. Railway whore, failed actor, whorehouse musician. And you lottery hustler. Compared to you I'm a gentleman. Funny, we never noticed. - I was and will be a chauffeur. Do you want this beer here as well? - Take it to the table. In this heat, nothing's better than mineral water. - True! Excuse me, may I go to the toilet? - Yes. Bill, please. You haven't touched your beer. Enjoy yourselves. And always remember: Everything that's beautiful was created by nature. Mountains, rivers and forests? - Yes, everything. Birds too? - Birds too. But you taught me we originate from monkeys. Yes I did and it's the truth. Move it closer. Doctor, do you want to be in the picture? But, I do. Closer please. Let me drink to drown my sorrow. My heart aches, it longs to break. Inhale deeply. Inhale... Don't hesitate! Shout! Come on... Now, all together. Man must let himself go. In France, every year alcohol kills over 30 thousand people. They drink twice as much as the Germans, three times more than the English or Americans and four times more than the Swedes and Danes. How do we rank? - They didn't mention us. Because they can't beat us. - Yes, especially you. Who are you looking for? - Cultural deputy. - Katya? They rang from the hospital to say that you are on your way. Many lecturers don't keep their word. We set things up and they don't show. You often organize lectures? - At least once a month. Your treatment would be useful here. Unfortunately, the boss can't see you yet. He's very busy. He's got a lot of problems. But he does expect you for dinner. Dr. Ilich, I'll show you the brewery. In these tanks... the beer is stored before bottling. All that beer! Please pour us a glass. Is this beer? - Yes, unpasteurized. It's much better than processed. It's produced under high pressure. Who'd like to try? - No, thank you. I'd like to. - Behave, son. This is the best beer. You want some? Thanks, I don't drink. In our country we consume 100 bottles of beer per head. This year only half of that amount because the old c-c-crow is on the wagon. How long can you keep that up? - For the rest of my life. Lucky you. Why do you have to wash the filter now? We're preparing for filtration. Sorry for passing through like this. What is this? - The largest beer mug in the world. We called the press. Photos of this will circulate the world. Maybe the Guinness Book of Records. That was my idea. Well done. C-c-congratulations. Thank you. Let's take a souvenir photo. Rade, please take a picture. You'll be comfortable in our villa. Daddy, I'm starving. - Be patient, you'll eat soon. Come on, hurry up! Thank God, we've arrived. You say "God" all the time. - And why shouldn't I? Smart people know that there is no God. We where taught that God exists. After the II World War there is no God. Did they kill Him during the war? Welcome. Please come in. Enjoy your meal, boss. How is the soup? - Delicious. It's my recipe. I didn't know whether to order game or fish. We could use a specialist in your field. No more, thank you. Not even one glass? - Not even one. Our basic problem is: We planned to open a whiskey distillery. The demand is very high. We bought the newest machinery, but our productivity is low. Our workers drink. If that was not the case, wages would go up. The town would prosper. I have to chase my workers home after the working hours. They laugh at me and say: Why change bars? Why do you serve beer on the streets? It's an old tradition. - Some tradition! You used to win Olympic medals. What happened to that tradition? They've been selling it like that for years. If I abolish it I might as well leave town. Forgive me, I must have more soup. Here, boss. You'd better watch it. - Watch what? It's bad for you to eat so much. But I love to eat, my friend. I don't drink much, I don't chase women and I don't smoke. Listen to my song and then you'll understand better. I wrote the lyrics and they the music. Come on, my song! What am I to do mother when I like to eat? I don't just eat a lot, I eat with pleasure. I shall go on a diet in Heaven, I shall go on a diet in Hell. "Are you h-h-honest? Are you f-f-fair? G-g-get thee to a N-n-nunnery. Why woulds't thou b-breed sinners?" That's very funny. Is there any more? "What is a m-m-man when his main goal "is to d-d-drink..." No, n-n-not to drink, but to "sleep and eat". "He is a l-l-livestock and nothing more." Bedtime. I'm switching off the lights. Wait, what's the hurry? W-w-we are n-n-not in hospital. It's past 10 p.m. Bedtime. Ha! Curfew! - Get out, or I'll call the Doctor. Regular Gestapo. - Ass kisser. It's for the child... and for you. He's asleep. You like children? - A lot. That's why I feel sorry for him for not having a mother. He needs her at this tender age. I don't understand how a woman could abandon her son and such a man. I've heard he was really rotten to her and that's why she ran away. - If it was his fault... ...he wouldn't have custody over his son. Only a stupid woman would do a thing like that. It wasn't my fault either and yet the took away my kids. Who did she run away with? With some artist, they say. - Do I hate artists! Where to? - You scared me! Go back to your room. - We're having a little bedtime snack. I must go now. - Stay a bit longer. First I must return the fish into the river. Come on, don't be shy. Don't worry, that's my son. We have visitors. Two incurable cases. My honorable father and his best friend. I didn't come on a social visit, I came for some money... I gave you money three days ago. We are celebrating his birthday. - Three whole days? Explain to him why! - I had a rough birth. It lasted for three days. Just give me the money. Don't nag your old man. When will you pay me back? - When will I pay back? I always keep my word. I'll pay you back on the 1st. Oh, you've got a job? - God forbid... I'll pay when you give me my allowance. No more money. Here. Oh, no! Is this a loan? - It's a gift. Don't do that. You don't know him. I know him. You are an alcoholic. - You mean me? Him, an alcoholic? - You sure are. You're destroying yourself and degrading your son in this town. You asked for money but he turned you down, so you took from me, a total stranger. Next you'll steal from someone. - Me steal? Or you'll rob a liquor store... - He's right. You're talking rubbish! Are you crazy? Are you calling me a thief, you idiot?! Let's calm down. Stuff your money you know were. Shame on you. Who is this idiot anyway? - He is the expert on alcoholism. Let's not bother them, let's go. Shame on you! Accusing an old man... ...of being an alcoholic and a thief. Nice friends you've got, my son. I have to go. Katya, give the Doctor a lift. - No, I'll walk. - It's far. Candied apples. Want one, Boss? - Leave me alone. The Martians are about to land. I can't wait to greet them. Delicious apples. I'll save the seeds. The Americans faked the moon landing. They know how to make movies. Don't you watch T.V.? - Yes, I do. But, they can't fool me. They built movie sets in California. Lunar surfaces and space ships. Then they filmed it all for TV. But the real Martians will come and spread a large steel net. They'll scoop us up and take us to their planet and turn us into... little tin men. On a night like this, I feel like playing. Rade, let's be partners when we get out. I could be your singer. - But, you sing out of tune. I'll form an orchestra and play classical music. You, play classical music? - Don't tease him, he's good. When I'm in the mood. It's hard to fight for one's ideas in such a small town. Especially, for a woman. The brewery is my life. Public relations, sales, entertainment, and the brewery's image. If only you knew how happy I am to be able to talk to you knowing that you'll understand me. Doctor! We'll see each other tomorrow. Good night. One, two, three, four. Flutter, like birds. Good morning, Doctor. Just keep exercising. Where's my boy? - He went for a walk with Jelena. One, two, three, four. Flutter, three, four. Jelena!! Dejan! Reach for the apples! One, two, three... Where did Red Riding Hood go wrong? She went off the path while Granny waited. To pick flowers. Man must stay on the right path. Temptation leads him astray. Like flowers led Red Riding Hood. Miss Jelena is so nice. - Yes, she is. Daddy, don't be mean to her. Will the show be a comedy? No, we are playing ourselves before treatment. Sounds heavy! Who is that girl? - Mila. Why, you like her? What tits! - I screwed her for a couple of lottery tickets. You? - Yes, me. Why don't you wipe your nose. Is there a shower we can use? - For you, anything. Sit down. Would you like a cigarette? Doctor, everything's ready. - Well done, Steve. If you've finished, lunch is ready. That's what we need! - Take the guests to the canteen. Can I go with Miss Jelena? - Yes, you can, but behave. Let me show you our library. Look! "The Drunkard." "King Alcohol." "The Old Man of the Sea." I'll purge the library with every book about alcohol. But, "The Old Man of the Sea" is about fishing. Yes, but the author was a drunk. You want to throw all these away? - Yes. You've inspired me to do it. - I'm glad. Do you want a soft drink? - Thank you. Oh, how I love soft drinks. Here. Eat Dejan. - I can't. Jelena, I'd like to talk to you. - Yes, Steve. The informer has left. How about some beer now? Honey, do you approve? G-g-good idea. - Why not? Go on. Hurry up. This is our P.A. System. We have music to motivate our workers. That was my idea. - Brilliant. Would you put this one on? It's my favorite. Of course. What's wrong? Don't worry, beer is not alcohol. Tell that to our doctor. He wouldn't give us an empty bottle. - Nor, f-f-full. Cheers, honey. Cheers! I've been collecting them for years. I have an impressive collection. Brandy, "Champion", "Royal Salut", fantastic. You're a real expert. - I know a little. This is our secret weapon. A sample of a drink which we shall produce under the slogan "Apricot Brandy in Every Cupboard". Beer is our main product, but this will really put our factory on the map. Ten years and ten trees, will produce... ...just five bottles of this brandy. More expensive than whiskey and much higher quality. I don't know if you drink but I'd love you to try some. What do you mean, do I drink? Let me try. Cheers. - Cheers. Jelena. I have something important to ask you. Will you marry me? - Go and play, Dejan. No. - No? - I'm honored that you have asked me. I know what a fine man you are but I'll never marry again. I come from a good family and I'm the only child. The Doctor will help me find a job as a chauffeur. I know, Steve. But I can't. Please understand... My marriage was real hell. That's how I started drinking. I just want to finish with this treatment so that I can regain custody over my children. Don't worry about them. I would treat them as if they were mine. As if I were a real father. Jelena... Let's drop the subject, please. I must warn you! If you ever remarry, I'll kill you! 30 years gone by, 30 years of folly. I don't give a damn, my future will be jolly. Silence, please. And now you'll se the great Hamlet. Gentlemen, you are misinformed. You'll se Pirandello's "Henry IV"! Who's that guy Henry? - I've no idea. He's the only real actor here. From the theatre, you know. They pretend to be so compassionate, trying hard not to enrage a poor soul. A man already lost to the world, lost to time, lost to life. He must have been crazy permitting such tyranny over him. Every day, every moment of the day, they want us all to dance to their tune, and for them that's no persecution. No way! That's only their way of thinking, their point of view, that's what they feel. Each one of us has his own point of view. You got yours, no doubt. Only, you think like a flock of sheep. Paltry, ephemeral, hesitant sheep. And they take advantage of that, and they take advantage of that... Oh, no! What counts is that you didn't stutter. Oh, gentlemen, that is how I failed as an actor. I never dared go on stage sober because I stuttered. When I got drunk I didn't stutter, but I forgot my lines. Here comes Steve! Steve who? Imagine that! One day she simply disappeared after ten years of marriage. Later on, I found out that she ran off with some scoundrel. She asked for a divorce. I agreed. She said revolting things about me. The judge did not believe her. You can't slander a man with my reputation. I got custody over the child but she said she'll get him back. Where is she now? - Somewhere in France. She wrote to me saying that she'll abduct Dejan. That's why he's always with me. Never on his own. She could really do it. She's completely unstable. I didn't sleep all night. Since we became acquainted I realized that nobody here is worthwhile. Life is a perpetual struggle. I really admire you. The way you put the boss's father in his place. No one here has the guts to speak out. I must tell you something. - What? You drink too much. - Me? - Yes, you. I noticed you manifest all the classic symptoms of an alcoholic. - Me? - Yes, you. You're nervous and confused. You're shy to speak unless you're a little tipsy. You grab a glass the minute you lay your eyes on it. I am telling the truth. I'm weak, I have no will power. You must fight it. Doctor! - What? Lock the door! I'm freezing! We're flying, flying high. Come on flap your wings. What wings? - Your wings. We're flying, we're flying. Don't worry, we are safe here. Can you fly? - How... We are flying. You stretch your arms and wave. We're flying. Like birds. What's wrong? Come here. Sit down. What's the matter? - I can't. Don't you like me? - I like you a lot. That's why I can't. I'd like to know you better. But, you are leaving after the show. If you want me, you'll find me. I'll be free soon. Come on, fly! Higher, higher! Flutter, flutter! Everybody out! Turn the water off. Stop screaming. Open up, do you hear me? Open up! Old bastard! I'll kill you! Our boss is busy, he won't make it. Alright, we'll begin. Shall I switch on the P.A. System? The whole brewery will hear. - Good idea. Switch it on. Go to your father. Oh God, you're all drunk. The Doctor will punish us all. How could you do this to me? Don't rat on us. He'll never notice. You sit with Miss Katya. Dr. Ilich is coming. Are you ready? Everyone except Steve. - Where is he? He got drunk and ran away. He even punched me. When he gets drunk he goes berserk. Why didn't you call me? - I was looking for you. I searched for you all over the brewery. O.K. I'll take over and make the smoke. Dr. Ilich, I'm to blame. He proposed to me. I refused and he went mad. - O.K. The show must go on. The evil of alcohol... - The Doctor! ... rules the world for thousands of years. Many a tyranny have quickly come to an end, but this one is everlasting, and growing worse from day to day. What is it in a human being that makes him drink? We shall talk about man and freedom. About man and health, about man and anxiety. About courage and will power. Did you ever ask yourselves what is a really free man? Only a free man can control his passions, thoughts, desires and emotions. And that is the very aim over every man. To become his own master and to fulfill his destiny. Some may think that freedom means to live were you like, or to do what you like. However, even behind bars men have reached their goals, although the have been... ... deprived of their freedom. Therefore we reached the essence of this matter. A free man is only the one that can... ...think, fantasize and make the impossible come true. Let's ask ourselves is an alcoholic a free man? The answer is: No and he cannot be free! An alcoholic is a psychopath and psychopaths can't choose. His thoughts are chaotic and thus he cannot reach his goals, if he has any. Such a person will always choose alcohol over his family, and he will choose alcohol over his freedom. My honorable audience, I will now present to you the people who have defeated this evil, and gained back their freedom and health. Jelena. - Cheda. - Rade. Marko. - Mila Pavlovic. As we know, alcohol attacks all the vital human organs. It ravages them slowly but surely. The brain... the lungs... the liver, which together with the stomach, is most vulnerable. And now I will show you what happens to these vital organs in the body of an alcoholic. Excesses of alcohol in the blood puts strain on the heart, which soon deteriorates and ceases to function. This is of particular interest to you: A beer drinker's heart. In order to see the difference, I'll first show you the heart of a healthy man! Lottery, lottery... No more screwing for lottery tickets. Lottery! This is not fiction. Each confession relates a true event. My patients have lived through all this. During treatment, from day to day, from hour to hour, they relived their tragedies and thus liberated themselves from addiction. We'll first hear Jelena's case. My name is Jelena Rajkovich. I am 32 years old, although I look much older. Alcohol is the cause. I lost custody over my children. A son of ten, and a daughter of four. I became an irresponsible mother. I began to drink because of my husband. He didn't drink but, he was a tyrant. Worse than any alcoholic. - Jelena! I am here because I tried to steal back my kids. I'll read you my son's letter written to me last summer. After I have read it I tried to kill myself. "Dear Mommy, this picture was taken at the seaside. I learned to swim, but Lila didn't. She's too small. Lila wets her bed all the time. Our stepmother says that she does that because you are a drunk and because you have ruined our lives. I told her that you love us, but she says that you don't, and that we'd be better off with you dead. Daddy tells us to call her mommy and to forget you. Dear mommy, we love you and miss you so much. At night, when we're alone, we cry and pray for you to come back. Our stepmother..." - Jelena, that's enough. And you came to see how we've been cured, and to enjoy in our show. The show is over. I don't want to be cured. I don't want to! Don't spoil the show! Carry on, carry on. Folks, a woman on the tracks! Miss Jelena! Carry on! Carry on! Don't leave, don't! The show must go on. Wait! Continue with your performance! Wait! Should you become a drunk because someone has left you, because your family has split apart, because your life is a small dirty war which you cannot win? If you experience a tragedy you've got to be strong. Use your will power to survive! Only we can help ourselves. No one else! Steve, Steve! Run, run! He'll kill us. Steve... Don't blame me Doctor, it's not my fault! Turn off the tape recorder. I trusted you, but you betrayed me. But, I'll cure you! If not this year, then the following. I'll make of you decent citizens even if it takes me a lifetime! Stop! I said stop! You stay... - With the boy? - Yes, with the boy? Stop! Lie down! Get up! Lie down! Get up!
