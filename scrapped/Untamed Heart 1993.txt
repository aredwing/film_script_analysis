(voices outside) - Goodbye, dear. - Say thank you to Sister. - (Joey) Thank you, Sister. - Let me get one more shot. - Bye-bye. - Goodbye, dear. (nun) One day the great king of the silver baboons came down from a peak high on a mountaintop on Kilimanjaro and caught your father stealing his treasure from a deep, dark cave from which enchanted rubies spilled out down the mountainside. After a great battle with the baboon king, your father was very badly wounded and left to die. But when the baboon king found out that your father wanted the enchanted rubies to cure his son... - Sister! Adam's not breathing! ... he took his own heart... (nun) Children, children, move to the side. Adam! Adam! (child) Is he dead? Did he hurt his head? I don't know. They just said he wasn't breathing. Well, he's breathing now. Call Sister Catherine. - I will. - Adam. Adam. Adam. Don't give up on us. Don't you give up, child. Don't you break our hearts. Oh, Adam. I've tried so hard with you. That poor little heart of yours. I don't know what else to do. Oh, Adam. (# "Tom's Diner" by DNA featuring Suzanne Vega) (woman) Caroline. Caroline? Yeah? What do you want? I can't do anything right now. - Aren't you gonna get something to eat? - Later. # I am sitting in the morning # At the diner on the corner # I am waiting at the counter # For the man to pour the coffee # And he fills it only halfway # And before I even argue # He is looking out the window # At somebody coming in # "It is always nice to see you" # Says the man behind the counter # To the woman who has come in # She is shaking her umbrella # And I look the other way # As they are kissing their hellos # And I'm pretending not to see them # And instead I pour the milk (car horn) - Hi. - Hi. - I missed you. - You missed me. Since what, yesterday? Yeah. Why not? Aren't we goin'? Yeah. - Is anything wrong? - No. - What do you wanna do? - I thought we were goin' to the game. What's the matter? Steven? Do you wanna just go some other time? You don't wanna see me any more. No, I didn't say that. It's just... I don't know. Maybe we should just start seeing other people. This always happens to me. Why does this always happen to me? I let myself get involved, I wind up getting hurt. - Caroline. - What did I do that was so wrong? Caroline, don't say that. You didn't do anything wrong. It's me. I just... I don't know. It's... - Come here. - No! Caroline, come here. Come on. - Don't cry. - Don't leave me. I'm going inside. - Why don't I call you later? - No, don't. Just leave me alone. Caroline, I didn't mean to hurt you. Yeah... Well, you did. (girl) Did he tell you why? (Caroline) No, he just said we should start seeing other people. He's a jerk. He could've at least told you why. Forget it. I don't feel like talking about it any more. - Talk about what? - Steven broke up with Caroline today. Which one was Steve? The one with the fig tree in his yard? No, that was Jackie. Steven had the sick mother. No, that was Bob. And his mother got better, and that's when he dumped me. - So, Jackie's the one with the fig tree? - No, that was Mike. Mike? - I'm gonna call him. - Caroline, don't you dare! My God, the guy broke up with you. You gotta let him call you. Caroline, this guy is a jerk, OK? You watch. I'll bet you he's gonna come crawlin' back on his knees, saying "Oh, Caroline, I miss you! I want you back!" - Yeah, like they all do. - You're too good to these jerks. You gotta learn to put your foot down. You got too good a heart. If you let 'em walk all over you, that's what they do. What scares me is when someone as screwed up as these guys are - doesn't want me. - (man whistles) Come on, ladies, we're getting busy now. You're taking too many breaks. Let's go. What, is he whistling at us like we're dogs? Does he ever go home? All right. I'm going. I'm going! I'll see you tomorrow night. - Working tomorrow night, hon? - Yeah. I'll be here. OK. Well, you know what? Walk safely home, OK? There's a lot of crazies out there. I'll see you later. Caroline... He's a jerk. (girl) Adam! Table seven. Adam. Adam! (man) Here they come, you guys.

You're gonna have to work a little harder. This guy's having a heart attack. You think you could send Adam over to table five? Thank you. OK. - Oh, great. - No, wait. That's Cindy's tuna melt. It's all right. - Hello. - (man) Finally. Here you are. - Caroline. - Here you are. Yes? - Where's Adam? - I don't know. Tell him to get his butt out here. I need him. Don't cut the cake yet. Let me get a picture. - Hey, Caroline. - Not now. Oh. Adam, you cut yourself. Let me see. Oh, my God. This is pretty deep. You might need stitches. Hold it like this. I'll put a bandage on it. Keep it up, because... You know what? Let me wash it out first. Come with me. I'm gonna rinse it off. If it doesn't stop bleeding, then maybe Jim can take you over to the hospital. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. What do you have all over your hands? Is that syrup or? It's sap. You work over in that Christmas-tree lot during the day, don't you? Yeah, yeah, I've seen you there... hauling trees once or twice. You smell like a pine tree. Like a Christmas tree. Maybe I'll stick a star on your head, huh? Just kidding. I used to love the way our Christmas tree smelt when we were little. Brings back memories, you know. When life was simple. Now my parents put up this stupid artificial tree. It's all fake. Just not the same, you know? You just don't talk much, do ya? Don't worry, I'm not gonna make you talk to me. (Jim) Could I have a waitress out here, please? You'll live. I gotta get back to work. (softly) Thanks. Why don't you go over there and handle it? - You can do it. - (man) Give me the quarter. Hey! Hey! How would you like to pay for that machine? It just stole my damn quarter, sweetheart. That's cos guys like you pound on it all the time. What's the matter with you? It ain't your machine. As a matter of fact, it is, so don't hit it any more. - Thank you. - This your diner? No, just my machine. Just wait. It happens to be a very good investment. Once it's all paid off. - Now what brand? - Marlboro. Lights. 100s, please. - Here. - That's great. If you have a problem with it, come to me next time. How'd you like to feel that, huh? She'd make a meal outta ya. - You know her? - Don't you remember who that is? - No. Who is she? - Well, just wait. You'll see. Hello. Do you fellas know what you want? Yes, we do. We would like to have Caroline wait on us - if you don't mind - because, well, we're gonna tip you both. Yeah. Thank you. Switch with me. Those two guys in there, they're asking for Caroline. Great. For Bill. - Ready to order? - Yeah. Hi. So, have you been to any parties lately, Caroline? - Do I know you? - Well, I tell you, I know you. Dean Albanese's Fourth of July party in the basement. Sloe-gin fizzes? Oh. Yeah. How's it going? Well, you know. It's going. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Now I remember. God, that was embarrassing. - Good memory. - It's my pleasure. You must have been barfin' up stuff your grandmother ate that night. I'm not an ogre that lives under the cigarette machine. Forget it, all right? Because we all are just people here, hm, you know? OK. We're not so bad. My name's Howard. You know, in case you've forgotten. This is Patsy. Hi. - Cigarette? - No. Oh, yeah. OK. I'm gonna have a cheeseburger deluxe, and I'll get that medium rare. (Cindy) And she's yelling at the top of her lungs "You mother-effing lousy, filthy pig!" "Your mother's a slut and your father's a ho!" All of this right in front of the Sons of Italy Hall. This girl, no class. You got a light? I mean, he met her at a stoplight, you know? She looks like Pete Rose. You gonna commiserate all night again, ladies? You are like wet sand in my underwear. Ouch. Anyways... did you call him? No. Really? That's good. That's real good. Here. Finish my cig for me. I gotta grab this guy before he stiffs me. I'll talk to you later. Why don't you just pay me now? Then you don't have to worry about it later.

Hey, Caroline! - God, you scared the shit outta me. - Sorry. Do you always drive like that? I'm really sorry. No more tables? Got any burgers? Is this what you guys do at four in the morning? - Here. Warm you up. - Come on, Caroline. Get inside the car. - No, thanks. - (Patsy) Hang out with us. We can be kicked out of every damn bar in Minneapolis. - No, I'm goin' home. - Home? - Yeah, I'm goin' home. It's late. - Late? Jesus, this is early for us! Be careful. Whoo-hoo! (Howard) Hey, Caroline, hang on a second. D'you mind if we walk with you? - I'm all right. - It's late out. A pretty girl like you... No, really, I'm all right. Good night. Hey, listen, I got a question I wanna ask you. How much can we get one of those cigarette machines for? Because Patsy and me, we was thinking, you know, of getting one. Yeah. I think you can get one for about 1500, used. That's what we paid. Oh, yeah? Really? 1500, huh? - Come on, take a shot. - No, I'm really tired. - I worked all night. I gotta get home. - Come on, we ain't gonna bite ya. Hey, you ain't scared of us, are you? No, I'm just tired. Yeah, that's right. Because you worked all night, right? Hey, Caroline?

Maybe she wants to share your brandy. Caroline! Go up that way. Go that way. Go find her. Caroline, honey! Come on. Hey! Come on. It's OK, it's OK. Calm down. Oh, God! Jesus! My nose! Jesus! Where you goin'? Trying to get away from Howard? How, man, look what I found. I think you broke my nose. (muffled) I'm sorry. What? Good. Good? Huh? I'll show you good. Hey... Caroline, tell me something. Did you really think that you were better than me? Did you? OK? You OK? Huh? - How, man, what are you doing? - Patsy, quiet her down. Here, give me her hand. Wow. See, Caroline? See that? I hurt. Quiet. Patsy, get her to be quiet. She bit me! Goddamn! - Shut up. - No! No! - No. - Yeah. (screams) - Shut up! - (Patsy) Take it easy, Howard. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up, Caroline! Hell, man. Jesus, Howard. What the hell are we doing? (sobbing) See, what I like to do is take a little pork rind and smear that on my lure. Sure. You know, I would recommend the rat-lipped jig. Well, the problem with a rat-lipped jig is that it catches on underwater growth. Well, I know, but... (man) Come on. Hey, Cindy, where's Caroline again today? - She called in sick. - Called in sick? That's every day this week. Is she OK? She called in sick. She's sick, she's sick. What can I tell you? - Anything serious? - Yeah, she's sick of work. Wasn't this a private conversation between you and me, Bill? Don't worry about it. I think she got the flu or somethin', you know? She'll be in tomorrow. Hey. Here you go now. Merry Christmas. - And what would you like for Christmas? - A dollhouse. We'll see you Christmas Day. Merry Christmas. What would you like? OK, I'll see you later. Michael, don't forget. Pick me up at two. - Two? AM? - Yeah. I have to get up for school in the morning. You wanted the car tonight. Don't make me wake up Daddy, because I'll kill you! (tyres screech) Hey, Caroline. - Welcome back. - Thanks. Hi, Caroline. Where you been? Been all over. Hey, you missed all the action in here last night. What did I miss? Well, you remember Bobby Las Vegas, don't you? - With the motorcycle? - He don't ride the motorcycle no more. Yeah? What happened? He slid on a dead squirrel goin' around a turn over by Frogtown. - Demolished the bike. - Jesus! - He was in here last night. - He got drunk as a dog down the street. He tried to run through the Lowry Hill Tunnel, but passed out cos of the fumes. So they brought him in here. He was in the bathroom throwin' up all night. - Gee, I'm really sorry I missed that. - Yeah, only Bobby, huh? So, Caroline, those two guys, you know, the ones that were bothering with the machine the other night last week? - Yeah? - Jim seen one of 'em over at St Vincent's. I went down there to see my cousin Lucy. She had that thing with her wrist. Yeah, they had to operate. Anyway, I see him out in the hallway. Man, was he worked! His face was a mess. Black eyes, bumps, bruises. Looked like he was hit by a dump truck. I gotta pick up Lucy on Tuesday. Come here. You've been following me home? How do you know where I live? Huh? Have you? Well? Have you? How's your hand? Thank you. I know. That's the scaredest I've ever been in my whole life. I just get squirrels in my stomach thinking about it. I guess I don't have to worry about you telling anybody, huh? It's kind of a real awkward thing for a girl. Well... Don't take this the wrong way, but thank you. I follow you home. You follow me home? I... What? I wasn't finished. Finish. I follow you home when you walk to... make sure you're... safe. I've never seen you. Well, I stay pretty far behind. - I'm sorry. - Well... I mean, don't be sorry. I just... I wasn't finished. Finish. I'm sorry that... I was late... that night. I don't think I ever heard you speak, and when you do, you apologise to me for saving me against... God knows what could have happened. Why should I be surprised? My life is like watching the Three Stooges in Spanish. - Either I'm being dumped or attacked. - (banging) Don't hit the machine! I'm sorry. I don't even know what I'm saying any more. I'll talk to you about this later. And I brought your coat back.

I wonder what he thinks about. I don't think Adam actually thinks. We're talkin' about a man who hasn't spoken. - So? - So? You don't find that a little weird? Look at him. He looks like a tumour sitting over there. And his hair. Oh, God! It just bothers me so much. You know, Lottie says that he has ape parts in him, or somethin' like that, I don't know. Oh, my God.

Did you finish beauty school? We got our practical exam in two weeks. Yeah, and what about the flower shop? What happened to the opening? - Mm-hm. - Mm-hm. You know what, Caroline?

It's Caroline. # This time of the year I brought you some cookies. I made them. Did you have a nice Christmas yesterday? Can I come in? - Great weather. What do you think? - Would you like some ice cream? Big on the ice cream, aren't you? No, thanks. Well, I guess the cookies are a little on the sugary side. So, you were all alone for Christmas. I should have stopped over yesterday. I should have invited you over. But... I guess you were already there. Thank you for the tree. It's so beautiful. It really made my day that you remembered. Did I come at a bad time? Do you want me to go? - No. - OK, then I'll stay. I'm not even gonna ask how you got into our house. - Do you like music, Caroline? - Mm-hm. I never heard you say my name before. It sounded nice. Would you like to see my records, Caroline? Caroline? Sure. Wow. They look really old. They're magic. They're not magic! What kind of magic do they do? In the orphanage Mother Camilla used to play them for me. I used to sit in the sunlight near the window in her office, and I'd fall asleep to them. She gave them to me when I left. Whenever my life doesn't agree with me, I lie down and I play these records and... the rain stops falling. Would you like to hear one? Mm-hm. (# piano music) You must have loved her a lot... Mother Camilla. She... She's the one who told me about my heart. What about your heart? I was... I was a very sick baby. My heart was very weak. My mother, she died when I was born. She died in the jungle, where she and my father were living. In the jungle? My father was a great adventurer. One day the great king of the silver baboons came down from his peak high on the mountaintops of Kilimanjaro and caught my father stealing his treasure from a deep, dark cave at the very bottom, where magic rubies trickled down from the top of the mountain. After a terrible battle with the baboon king, my father was wounded and left to die. When the great king later learned that my father needed the enchanted rubies to heal his son with the dying heart, he was so overwhelmed with guilt and shame at what he had done that he took his own beating heart right from his mighty baboon chest and placed it in mine. Mother Camilla told you all this? You believe her? And you tell this to people? Oh, no. It's a nice story. It's stopped raining. Magic records and a baboon heart. You almost got me believin' in it. How'd you like me to cut your hair? It's OK. No one's home. Mind if I ask who cuts this thing? - I do. - I see. - Mind if I ask something else? - Ouch. Sorry. Did you ever think of doing anything else with your life besides bus boy? I mean, you must have had an education at the orphanage. I'm not very good with people. Don't let people stand in your way. They're only people, just like you and me. Well, maybe not like you. I don't know if I've ever met anyone like you. The first I can remember, I was four years old. And? I wasn't allowed any physical contact or... even allowed to go out in public. Why? My health was still poor. Cos of the risk of infection. People were so used to staying away from me that they always stayed away. I never got close to people. Jeez. That's gotta be hard on a kid. Not being held or being allowed to hold anyone. What does your father do? Uh... Actually, my stepdad. Step to the rear. He's a bus driver. MTC between Minneapolis and St Paul. He's a real good guy. You should meet him sometime. He was on Candid Camera. They locked him in a closet. He was great about it. My real dad is like oil and vinegar with everybody. He just don't mix. Cindy says screw him. Well, first guy to walk out of my life, certainly not the last. Weird, huh? You're always stayin' away from love, I'm always chasin' love. Weird. Come on. Here. (sobs) Are you crying? OK. It's OK. I'm gonna fall in love with you. You don't have to love me back. I'm gonna give you my heart. (Caroline) OK, OK. My parents are having a New Year's Eve party. My brother'll be there, with whoever might be his girlfriend at that moment. Do you wanna come? You don't have to come as my boyfriend or anything like that. Though I'd like you to. - Is that yes? - Yes. Yes? - Say yes again. - Yes. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Nice kitty. Nice kitty. It's OK. Adam. What are you doin' out here? When did you get here? Ten. Ten? That was almost two hours ago. You'd rather be out here with my cat than inside with... with a room full of strangers and relatives? Adam. Oh, oh. Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have this wish I wish tonight. That's Mars. What? That's Mars. You just wished on a planet. Figures. (party guests) Happy New Year! (party guests sing "Auld Lang Syne") You can kiss me. More. You know Nick's friend - Ronnie? He's a cop? - No. - Yes, you do. He has the sister that bought the house down by North Shore. I never met him though. Anyway, look. I want you to double with us, OK? We're gonna go to The Fountain. Go dancin', have fun. You should come. I don't think I can. Why not? Well, I'm sort of seein' somebody. Yeah? You are? Who? Come on, you little shit! Tell me who. Forget it. It's Adam. - Adam who? - Adam from work. Adam Adam? And you're just telling me this shit now? You freakin' liar! I'm not lying. It's Adam. Uh-uh. Why? Cos... I got to know him. - And we make sense. - What do you mean, you make sense? He doesn't make sense, I don't make sense. Together we make sense. So... Tell me what he's like. I mean, does he actually speak? Did you meet his family yet? I mean, what's up with this? Yeah, he speaks. No, I haven't met his family. - He's an orphan. - Really? No shit. I never met a real orphan before. Yeah. He's a lot smarter than people think. He reads a lot. Got a lot of books. He's really into his music. Really? He's really sweet. He's like a kid, but it's nice. He's got... He thinks he's got... He thinks he's got a baboon's heart. You see, Caroline? You see? I told you this man had ape parts in him. - I told you! - He doesn't have ape parts in him. It's just a story a nun at that orphanage told a scared little boy who didn't know why he was so... He's got some kind of heart problem. But Adam? You know, you don't have to sell yourself short either, you know. - Well, there's something you don't know. - What? You know when I was out sick? Yeah. (sobs) On the way home in the park one night, two guys tried to rape me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Caroline, are you OK? Yeah. Someone stopped them. It was Adam. He saved me. Why didn't you tell me this? Why didn't you come to me? I didn't tell anybody. Jesus, you poor thing. Are you all right? I mean, seriously, are you OK? Yeah? God, I don't believe this. Holy shit. - Shit, shit, shit. - What? What? You're gonna be so mad at me. Why? Well, I kind of told Nick that you would double with Ronnie. I... Great. Thanks a lot. Look, you don't have to go, OK? I mean, you could just forget the whole thing, OK? Just forget it, OK? Well... Well, go anyway, OK? Just go, Caroline. I mean, you'll have a good time. He's really nice. His father owns a hardware store downtown, you know? When was the last time we went dancing, huh? And, look, if you don't like him, he doesn't turn out to be the glass-slipper man, you don't have to see him any more, all right? (# loud music) - My dad owns a hardware store. - What? My dad, he owns a hardware store. - If you ever need anything... - What? If you ever need anything, just let me know, or let Cindy know, and I'll take care of it. - We don't have to wait for a seat. - Cindy. - What? - Can I talk to you? - Nick, go find us a table. - OK. OK. What is up with you? I didn't wanna go out with him. I didn't know we'd come here. This isn't right being here. This is terrible. Let's just go. Let's just go. Why? Why don't you just go tell Adam that you're with friends? I mean, you and me went out dancin' and that's all. What? He's got that much hold on you already? No, that isn't it. He's very sensitive. I don't know how he's gonna react to seeing me with this guy. Look, why don't you just go find Adam and tell him that you and Ronnie are just friends? All right? Well, go ahead. Jim, where's Adam? I don't know. Look in back. - John, is Adam back here? - No, I haven't seen him. Adam? Adam? - Just coffee. - Are you sure? - OK. Have fun. - Here's Caroline. Here. Sit. I ain't gonna bite you. (Patsy) How's that? Oh, man. Come on, get up. (Howard) Take this, tough guy. All right! Loser. (tyres screech) Whoo-hoo! Oh, my God! Jim! Jim! Oh, my God! Adam. - Cindy! - I'm right here. I'm right here. - Call an ambulance! - Call an ambulance! - Is he breathing? - Yeah, no... Yeah, yeah. - Has he been shot? - I don't know. I don't know. Sweetie. Sweetheart. I'm right here. Right here. You're gonna be OK. (doctor) It's not the knife wound that we're worried about. It's his heart. - (Caroline) His heart? - Yes. It's not the normal heart of a 26-year-old man. Excuse me? What did you say? We know he has a congenital defect. And we do favour, at some point, a transplant. It's been left untreated for far too long. He should remain stable until a proper donor is available. And how long can that take? That we don't know. He's sedated now, but he became very upset before, when we were talking about going in to relieve the pressure on his heart. It took two orderlies, two nurses and myself just to hold him down. We were surprised that didn't kill him right there, what with all the trauma he's experienced. However, that's also a very good sign of hope, that he's more than strong enough and he can go on living for quite some time with treatment for what he's got. Good evening. Are you with the lady in there? - Yes. Yes, she's my best friend. - OK. - Number five and number seven. - You positive? - Number five and number seven. - Thank you. Just step over here and we'll get the paperwork out of the way. You're not taking off too much, are you? No. I only want a trim. Did you hear me, young lady? Yeah, I heard you. You told me. I can't believe I gotta do this today. I can't take this freakin' lady. I know. Just try to calm down. You can't work a miracle, so just do what you can. Hang tough. I know you're being tested today. I hope you're not trying to impress anybody. All I want is a trim. It's too cold out yet for short hair. Mm-hm. Just keep your head still. Should we maybe involve your instructor in this, and she could make sure you don't make a disaster area out of my hair, hm? Why'd you stop? You're not butchering it, are you? I wouldn't like to have you butcher my hair. I'm not butchering your hair. It's a free haircut. So stop your bitchin' before I cut it all off, you fat cow! Thanks! (phone rings) - (Cindy) What? - Can you drive me over to the hospital? I don't have a car, nobody's home, and I really wanna see Adam. When do they open? I don't know. Never mind. He's here. Adam! What are you doin' here? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you, Caroline. I was so scared. Are you OK? Are you OK? You wanna come inside? You want me to get you something to eat? You want some breakfast? The stitches, your stitches. I bet you're sore. I'm supposed to be giving you flowers. They're beautiful. What'd the doctor say? I'm not allowed to stick knives in my stomach. Very funny. You could have been killed. They caught the guys who did it to you. Do the police know what they did to you? Yeah. I told them. We'll probably both have to go to court. Did you have your beauty exam today? Yeah, but... it just... Forget it. It was just a stupid licence. I was no good at it anyway. Don't say that. So... the doctor told you you're gonna have to have a transplant? - Adam. - No. They're wrong. Adam, the heart you have is diseased. No one is taking away my heart. You were just a kid. It was just a story. You're gonna die someday if you don't do something about it. But this is my heart. I don't want you to die. I love you. I was... I was wondering if you think about me. Of course I think about you. I wasn't finished. Finish. I was wondering if you think about me... half as much as I think about you. I, uh... have to tell you something. It might make you angry. Look at me. I watch you sleep sometimes. The tree - it wasn't the first time I was in your room. Or the last. You come into my room? The basement under the porch. To watch me sleep? Why? You have peace. I don't. My sleep, it's always the same dream. The jungle. Dreary, twisted limbs. Strangling vines. And rain. Always the rain. I feel suffocated. Despair. Despair of just trying to survive. Despair and no peace. I'm... afraid if they take away my heart, I won't be able to love you the same. You are my peace. Oh, my God. You love with your mind and your soul, not actually with your heart. It's just a saying. Why does it hurt so much here when... you're not with me? - # Try me - # Try me - # Try me - # Try me # Darling, tell me # I need you - # Try me - # Try me - # Try me - # Try me # And your love # Will always be true # Oh, I need you # I need you - # Hold me - # Hold me - # Hold me - # Hold me # I want you right here # By my side - # Hold me - # Hold me - # Hold me - # Hold me # And your love # We won't hide # Oh, I need you # I need you # Need you # Need you # Need you # Need you # Oh, I need you # I need you # Oh, walk with me # Walk with me - # Talk with me - # Talk with me # I want you to stop my heart from crying - # Walk with me - # Walk with me - # Talk with me - # Talk with me # And your love # Stops my heart from dying # Oh, I need you # I need you (knock at door) Happy... happy birthday! Come here. You're so beautiful. You get this. You get this. And you get this. Go get your coat. - Where are we going? - It's a surprise. - What's that? - It's a present for you. - For me? - Don't open it. It's a surprise. We can open it later together. You got... you got me a present on your birthday? - I have fallen... - Did you hurt yourself? I wasn't finished. I have fallen so in love with you. So much more than I told you I would. All right. OK. Come on. Clear it out! Clear it out! Clear it out! - Yeah! - Oh! North Stars! North Stars! Yeah! I can't believe you caught a puck. That's, like... It's, like, never happened. Amazing. You're amazing. Thank you for taking me, Caroline. I didn't know if you'd like it. You know what I like. I'm glad you like it as much as me. - I love hockey. - (laughs) You didn't even know what a power play was. I know, but the next time we go you can tell me, and I'll catch another one of these for you. It was a good game, huh? Yeah. A good game. Hey. Baby. Wake up. We're home. Hey. Wake up. Wake up. Sweetie. We're home. Hey! Hey. (dog barks) (sobs) (priest) If I give away all my possessions, if I hand over my body so I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing. Love is patient, love is kind. Love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way. It is not irritable or resentful. It does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end. As for tongues, they will cease. As for knowledge, it will come to an end. For we only know in part, and we prophecy only in part. But when the complete comes, the partial will come to an end. I love you. You're family. Good. You're lucky. I love you too. Luck has nothing to do with it. He was like an angel, you know? I never knew life could be like that. He was the one thing I followed through with, the one thing I didn't give up on. And I was good at loving him. (# piano instrumental: "Nature Boy") (Adam) Dear Caroline. I don't need these any more because all my wishes came true - I found you. So play them and think of me, and I'll wish on Mars and think of you. I carry your heart with me... I'm not finished. I carry it in my heart. # There was a boy # A very strange, enchanted boy # They say he wandered very far, very far # Over land and sea # A little shy # And sad of eye # But very wise was he # And then one day # A magic day he passed my way # And while we spoke of many things # Fools and kings # This he said to me # The greatest thing # You'll ever learn # Is just to love # And be loved in return # A little shy # And sad of eye # But very wise was he # And then one day # A magic day he passed my way # And while we spoke of many things # Fools and kings # This he said to me # The greatest thing # You'll ever learn # Is just to love # And be loved in return # The greatest thing # You'll ever learn # Is just to love # And be loved in return
