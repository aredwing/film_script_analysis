[ Announcer Over Radio ] The Atlanta fans extremely disappointed. This was supposed to be an easy victory over the New York Knicks. The Hawks' foul trouble has created a real opportunity for the Knicks... but I have to wonder if the Knicks are doing enough to exploit it. - [ Dispatcher ] Well, Marv, I'd say the answer is no. - No! With a halfway decent coach, they'd probably be ahead by now. [ Announcer ] Stacy Patton shoots! Air ball! - Why didn't he hit the open man? - Damn it, Knicks, you suck! [ Dispatcher ] Because Stacy Patton is a showboater... - who only averages 0.2 assists per game, that's why. - [ Announcer ] Duncan steals! - Stacy Patton and Drew Hastings. Yes! - Yeah! Yeah! The Knicks take a two-point lead for the first time in the game. [ Dispatcher ] The Knicks take the lead with 20 seconds to go. - It doesn't get any better than this. - [ Phone Ringing ] Hold on, sports fans. We're experiencing technical difficulties. [ Announcer ] Spud Webb to Doc Rivers. Mike's Limo. Oh, Achmed, it's you. Oh-- [ Giggles ] I need you to come in and get the white-- Spud Webb shoots a three! It's good! Come get the white stretch. Knicks coach John Bailey calling for a time out. Thank God. Bailey takes a 20-second time out with 12 long seconds to play. - [ Announcer Continues ] - After you make the Plaza drop... drive through the wings, make the fast break down the F.D.R. to the Long Island Expressway. - The Atlanta crowd is greatly upset-- - We're back, sports fans. - Mischa! - I say no more basketball! No! Do you want to drive limo again? You can fire me, take every cent I have, but don't fool around with the basketball game. - No! - Move your hand. - No! No, no, no! - Move your-- I pay you work, not watch T-- No! No, no! - Aaah! - [ Announcer ] Spud Webb to Doc Rivers. Back to Webb. For the three! - Yes! The Hawks regain the lead... - Okay, sports fans. with six seconds left. Coach John Bailey is disgusted as his star hands the Hawks the lead in this game. - The Knicks still have a chance. - Come on, Hastings, you can do this. There's your play. Pass to Duncan! [ Announcer ] Hastings on the hop to D-- Ohh! Patton collides with Duncan, and at the buzzer it's the Atlanta Hawks by two... - [ Buzzer Sounds ] - over the New York Knicks. - What a heartbreaker tonight as once again the Knicks... - We blew it. We blew it. - have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. - Ohh, God! You drive-- You drive a limo tomorrow! [ Jingle ] Sports radio 66 - The fan! - WFAN welcoming you back to WFAN, Fan Radio. The sell rumors have heated up again. The Knicks, who at 14-39 have sunk to new lows this season... have announced a press conference in one hour... so we won't be in suspense much longer. Well, I don't give a shit how much it costs. I want it. Oh, my driver's here at last. - Are you the guy going to the Plaza? - Yes, I am. - I'm really sorry. Traffic was abominable. - We'd better get goin'. - Let me take this bag. - No, I got it. - Ma'am, it's a very heavy bag-- - I have it. Get in the car. You know, I got an appointment in New York. We'll maybe you oughta get in the car and we'll get there faster. Sure. [ Grunting ] - Excuse me, ma'am. - Sorry. Sorry. - You know there's wheels on them things, hon. - Gee, thanks. And don't call me "hon." [ Jingle ] Sports radio ESPN Chris Berman back with you live on ESPN Radio. Remember the man that brought us all those pay-per-view spectaculars... like "The Fracas in Caracas"... "The Brawl in Nepal"? And who could ever forget "The Feud in the Nude"? He's sports entrepreneur Wild Bill Burgess... and it's official, he's the new owner of the New York Knicks. Knicks' coach John Bailey didn't exactly roll out the ol' welcome mat. [ Bailey On Tape ] Look, I'm sure we'll get along fine, okay? As long as he lets me coach my team my way, my style. Yeah, right. Well, we'll see, because live with us now is Wild Bill Burgess himself. Bill, congratulations. But how do you expect to turn around this ball club? [ On Phone ] Well, Chris, you're gonna see more entertainment... you're gonna see better marketing, cuter cheerleaders. - You know, the Knicks don't even have a mascot. - Bill, so what? - What about changes on the team? - ESPN. - Put me on with this putz. - We've got a hot one on line four. - Eddie from Manhattan. - Eddie from Manhattan. You're on live with Wild Bill Burgess. Billy, you really want a mascot, baby? You need to put a saddle on Bailey and ride his ass around Central Park all night. - That's what you need. - [ Bill Laughs ] Well, you know, if that'd sell tickets I might consider it, hon. [ Laughs ] Yeah, right. And don't call me "hon." [ Berman On Radio ] Uh, Wild Bill, you still with us? Eddie. Eddie, you there? Steve from Hartford, you're live with us on ESPN Radio. What can we do for you? - [ Tires Screeching ] - [ Horns Honking ] [ Eddie ] I'm tellin' you, Wild Bill, these guys are really good. They have the potential to be a fabulous team, but they don't have any leadership. No, you know what it is-- the Russians only care about shooting. That's why Ivan doesn't know anything about defense. But you got a couple of rookies who are pretty good... and then you got Patton, who's a fabulous player but knows he's a fabulous player. He has no assists because he won't pass the ball. - You've inherited a mess. Is there anything else I can tell you? - Yes, a lot more. But I'm afraid I don't have the time. Thanks for the advice. - Let me give you a little somethin'. - Oh, no, really-- Come on. I've always heard New Yorkers weren't kind people. - You've been very kind. - Gee, Ben looks good. It's been so long since I've seen him. Thank you. [ Phone Rings, Machine Picks Up ] [ Eddie On Machine ] Okay, it's an easy one today. He was N.B.A. Rookie of the Year in 1968. - What was Earl Monroe's nickname? - [ Machine Beeps ] [ Woman ] Eddie, it's me. Pick up. Eddie? Okay, listen, sweetheart, I don't know if you noticed... but men go to basketball games so, Eddie, please, please wear something sexy. By the way, thank God you put an easy question on your machine... 'cause I met this cute guy and I gave him your number. - See you tonight. Bye. [ Dial Tone ] - Hello? Ah. Goddamn it. Oh, I wish you'd stop giving out my phone number, Claudine. How many consecutive games did Dolph Schayes play when he was with the Syracuse Nets? - Answer that, and magic can happen. - [ Beeps ] Right. Ah! What's a "goil" to wear? [ Chuckles ] Monroe. I know you're comfortable and I'm glad, but what are you doing to me, huh? Do you know how long it takes me to get this gorgeous? Two hours! You take ten seconds to throw on a jersey, you look like a bag lady. As opposed to a $50 hooker? Hello! Eddie, please. A hundred dollars at least, huh? - Excuse me. - Hey, Odell. - Hello, beautiful. How are you tonight? - Good. They warming up? - Leave him alone, please. - What? He's cute. "He's cu--" Everybody is cute to you. I don't understand why every time we come to a basketball game you dress up. [ Marv Albert ] We'll see whether the Knicks... at home tonight with new owner Bill Burgess attending his first game... can beat the Los Angeles Lakers... who are on a six-game winning streak. - What about Van Exel? - Play him tight. - But Vlade's the problem. Always has been. - No, no, no, no. You double up on Van Exel... and play Vlade with Ivan, or "Ee-van" or whatever, tight, man-to-man-- Oh, uh, Coach Bailey, I wonder if I could have a moment, sir. - Well, of course you can. It's your team now. - No, sir, it's our team. Listen, I was watchin' the game on TV last night. Our boys are movin' awful slow, don't you think? Why don't you fire 'em up a bit? Give the folks a good show. Hmm? - Look, um, Mr. Burgess-- - Oh, Bill, Bill. You can call me Bill. Mr. Burgess, I am the head coach of the New York Knicks. Now, if you're looking for a cheerleader... those are the girls that run around in those short little skirts. [ P.A. Announcer, Indistinct ] - Look, there's Bailey right there. - Eddie, wait. Bailey! - Bailey! - [ Man ] Yo, Eddie! You gonna try something new tonight, like tryin' to coach? [ Laughs ] It is the N.B.A., buddy: "No Buttheads Allowed." - But you keep comin' back. I don't understand it. - [ Fans Laughing ] You looking good, though, babe. Don't look at me like that. You see that sign that says "John 3:16"? That is not a biblical quote, baby. That's your sorry road record, 'cause you the anticoach! [ Eddie, Fans Laughing ] All right, hey, let's go. Do your job and get her out of here. - Come on. - Okay, ladies, please. - Do you have "666" on your head? - Yeah, yeah. Bye-bye.

At guard, six feet, one inch, Nick Van Exel. - [ Claudine ] Don't start on my chest. - That chest got us thrown out. Your mouth got us thrown out. The chest almost kept us in the good seats. You know what pisses me off? I hate people that buy those $8,000 seats, then don't come 'til we start winning. [ P.A. Announcer ] Introducing the starting lineup for your New York Knicks!

The Knicks do not stink. They're just a man short. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clark Kent. - That's your comeback line? - Get a life! - Don't start with her. She's had a bad day. You couldn't be funny if your life depended on it. One phone call to Staten Island-- ba-da-bing! Know what I'm talkin' about? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome your new Knicks City Dancers! - [ Fanfare ] - [ Dancers ] Whoo! [ Continues ] - Hey, Eddie. - Hey, girls. Claudine.

We'll see if it helps. [ Scattered Groans, Applause ] [ Eddie ] Bailey! What's the matter with you? Hey, Bailey! Open up your eyes! If Duncan can't make his free throws and won't get back on defense, sit him down! Putz! [ Fans Groaning, Hooting ] She gets louder every year. Let's stack the deck a little, shall we? - Say "freaky girl" - Freaky girl - Say "sexy girl" - Sexy girl - [ Continues ] - Well, the first half has mercifully ended... for Coach John Bailey's New York Knicks.

Excuse us for a second. Listen, don't ever come up on me like that again in front of children. - What's the matter with you? - Nothing's the matter with me. - He's been sittin' there for the entire game. - The boy got a "D" in English. - What's that got to do with him playin' ball? - A lot. But your first question should've been, "Why'd he get the 'D' in English?" You need to start paying attention to him in school... or you're gonna be watching him in court instead of on the court. - Okay? - Okay. I understand. All right. Let's get something straight: I am not here to clean up your horse shit... or to play second fiddle to some circus freak that you created. Price of showmanship, Mr. Bailey. To you, maybe.

Another loss seems imminent for the struggling New York Knicks who don't seem to listen to their replacement coach any more than their former coach John Bailey Stacy, what are your thoughts on the game tonight? Stacy Patton don't do interviews [ Players Murmuring ] It just didn't seem like the team was playing as a cohesive unit Was there just lack of focus? You got a guy takin' 38 shots and makin' eight? No wonder the coach quit And we got a Rasta runnin' along the sidelines acting like a coach now - It's a circus - Howdy, folks - [ Burgess ] I brought you a little present - Eddie Eddie - Eddie, I'm from People Magazine - [ Reporters Chattering ] What is your previous coaching experience?
