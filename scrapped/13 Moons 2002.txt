It is helsjukt. The wife will and what do you say then? - I said, "Hello. " - "Hello"? I had said: "It was you who married you clown. I just fuck him. " Talk not so much! Lily? Don't talk to the dancers. The woman is working and toiling away. Should you not give her some money? - You, then? Fucking dick. - I heard it. I is a dick. - But you have never had a taste. - A little disappointment in my life. "Small" is the right word. We are ready, Owen. - Stop the car. - What? - Owen, what are you doing? - Planet is at. 6 in the morning. - What are you doing? - I have to think through some things. - What is it, Owen? - See you maybe at the airport. Owen. You do not know what God wants! - The church does not either. - Owen! Up with the notes! The ladies wear course. This is the last and then it's you. She does not bite... very hard. I am not afraid. I just wonder how I can get her to dance for me. You can throw up some money. It is her livelihood. - Now, then? - Wag with the money away at the door. It is someone who pays. They go into the champagne room. Do you not men? She is death leaking. She just trying to earn some money. Come on! Go from there. You guys in penguin suits... Sit at the bar and wait. You, Buddy Holly... To the bar. - The perverse first business. - The is business. This is Rick from "Bare It". We have three guys who are dressed for priests. The usual... They are full and squabbling. Now is the time! "We are priests! - Are you okay, blind? - No. Asshole scribbled! - I did not mean... "I wait outside. - It is a misunderstanding. - Get away! - Let us go in peace. Is this cool enough? What do you say now? It is not just a collar. This is my church. In here it is I who am God. Lily, take the back door! - There he is. - Pretend to be a priest...! "Then you are a pervert. I'm a priest! - Are you priests for real? - Yes. Has been. What should we do with Robert? We will flight tomorrow. You can call your boss... But a creditor is perhaps better. If you can set up with security will we probably get him out. Are you trying to kill Santa Claus? It could have been worse. You do not know what the problem is. You could have been a Santa Claus wreck. If you can set up with security , so good. - Has he hurt himself? - I realized that it would happen. Anything can happen. We are fortunate. Do you put handcuffs on pregnant women and throw them in jail? That girl is my fiancee. She will feed my son. If that happens her something so true i am! I suggest that you and your fiancee is in therapy - - so you learn to resolve your conflicts in the future. I go around with a suggestion box around your neck? No! I lose ten thousand per hour. Do you have any solution for it? - I'm talking about what you have inside you. - I'm talking about money! - Lenny... - What are you, Mo? - What really happened? - I have been told. There was shooting and my girl was locked up! - Was anyone hurt? - She is not aimed at anyone. "It said nothing about you. - Now you know it. This is a school friend. He taught me to plug toilets. Throw it I'll tell him to withdraw. He who speaks with the creditor is a storfrsare in the music. - Do you know who I mean? Yes, maybe. It is he. Lenny something... - Sanandra! - Where are my things? I hope fucking that you have not ruined anything. - Hey, Sanandra. - Hey, Mo. - Are you happy now? - Kiss my ass, Lenny! Sanandra, wait! I'm not going back to the studio. And not back to the cell. - What are you talking about? - What are you doing? Take it easy, the police officer. It is nothing. I have the best producers in L.A. What is wrong? Open your ears, dammit. I can not sing! Cash-back? - Mo Potter. What? Wait a minute. - Have you approached a priest? - Yes, one who claims that he is a priest. I am on Almeida police, behind the court building. - Of course you can sing. - The musicians laughed at me. - Who laughed at you? - Why? So you can kick them? - It must be one p. m. moons. - What? It always said my mother when she was waiting for trouble. "Perhaps it is the 13 mnarnas night. " I am not God anymore. It must be great to hear a voice and know that it is God. For me it was reality. I had a guide within me. - What are you gonna do now? - Wait until I hear him again. We must return to the studio and a DAT tape, so... Stay! - Why you playing on the street? - Sorry. I saw him not. I drove almost to him. Where is your mom? - At work. - What is your name? - Timmy. - Where is your father, Timmy? Is he a cop? Lenny, go in and find his father. Are you okay? Are you cold? Is it yours? Please. Hold hard in it. Hold hard so it does not fly away again. Bananas. Your wife must sit for twelve hours. They released a married woman once. She shot her husband, twelve times in the groin. It must not happen again. What an idiot is what allows his son play out in the parking lot? - Lenny, good to see you again. - Is it not amazing? He was about to be hit. - That's my boy. - Come with me! - Did I not that you would wait? - Is it your son? You should be ashamed that let him walk around here alone. What is she doing here? - Are they good? - Ask him. Are you okay? Women are weird. The longing after what they want. - Fan. He looked this way. - Should I talk to him? It does not help. He is a clown. - And what does that mean? - It is getting worse. What is he doing now? I never know really what Bananas do. Lily, can I come in and talk to you? Can we switch places? Bananas, stop now! Come on, Lil. There are two sides of this. You are attracted to me, but I can not touch you. Why must it be so? You do not do this again, huh? Well, Timmy. Lenny... Sign here, then you can go. You can have fun with the kid and I can go and work. Turn around. Bend your forward. Mr. Potter? I am Father Thaddeus Phaelan. It applies to a colleague who have been innocently imprisoned. Let me finish this first then we can talk business later. Whose pager is it? Wait a minute, you little gangster. What are you hiding? It is my mother. Call the boy Potter again. Give him a dose of adrenaline. We have a donor. boy was going to St. Noel's. - Lenny, drive us to the hospital. - No, Satan! - I'm calling to his mother. - It is always wrong. Ask mom. We will not ask anybody. He will to the hospital. - Let Mo take care of his son. - He do not even know that he is sick! Her father will never get in... She is on a cruise. I call her boss. She will not until tomorrow. - The boy needs to the hospital. Jump-in. Lenny... I never got the opportunity to introduce myself. Binky silver. I am a producer for a cable television program. - Which hospital would they? - St. Noel's. How can you know so little if your son? We have been divorced for five years. I barely know him. I pay maintenance on time each month. My dearest wish is Sanandra will give birth to my son. And you do not even know how your son doing? Should not you also criticize me? Len, I can drive. So I can tell you more on the road. Come on, Mo. You sit in front. If you wait for a man will always be too late. From now on, I never too late, Lily. - It is too late, Bananas. - His name is Mr Bananas! Was it not you who was fired from TV? It was fucking fun. Whose friend is she? And what do we do in the hospital? What? Listen to this. Do you know how fucking stupid this is? Sorry, Father. I thought how stupid it is. I have known Mo long and do not know a thing about him. My private life includes my job. Are you listening? It is Sanandra. Is she not good? People think she will get the opportunity just because she is my child. They give her a chance. Do you understand? Yes. She is great... Shut up! I work with guys I like. My friends, my family, my girl. That is how I work. Take it! - What happened? - What the hell am I doing here? - I will die. - But it is not me. Can I drink this? I am a small cat. Meow, meow. You are a dumb dog... Everything will be fine. Owen... We can not do more for the boy. - We should help Robert. - He should probably stay where he is. - A sexklubb, huh? - It was a mistake. I hate sex. But I do it anyway. - Stop it. - She goes nowhere without... - I have to go to the bathroom. - Soon, darling. Have you murdered your child? It has already received fingers. - I just want your number. - You kill a child! I will give birth. A renkalv. Can you check? Ouch, it hurt. I feel much better now. Take care of renkalven. I will tell the good news for Rudolf! It is arranged. I have money. Listen... Uncle Lenny accompany you to the bathroom. I am in there with the doctor and your dad. We will shortly. - Here. Follow him to the bathroom. - Then we talk about the studio, huh? - Have you a cigarette? - It must not smoke here. I work in God's secret police. The devil hit me. - You know what I mean, right? - Excuse us. Humor is over return. We must do something new. We out of here. We can not help the boy. We have enough problems. The show is stopped and Laurie are in jail. Laurie does not want to sleep with me. What does she want me to do? - What is the problem? - She lacks enthusiasm. So what, then? Does she not I have done it without enthusiasm? - Is it your car? - How so? - You can not park here. - Who says that? I do. I am a security guard at the hospital. But if you are bidding on a cigarette you can let it stand. We do not smoke. Help! He rapes me! Can we go now? Need something? Call me if you want something. I lose a fortune. Does this long? I have people waiting on me. - What do you know about your son? - Very little. What is it? Operation Paper. Your son kidney has a capacity of 25%. - He is therefore red blood cells. - Wait until his mother will. Moreover, his blood very unusual. Is all well there? - Timmy? - I feel good.

No? Lenny Keyes was the bowler in Major League. He won thirty games. You think Perhaps it is a lie, but it is true. You see this little scar? Lenny Keyes finger was too far. And the center was too short - - so we went to the hospital and changed. And then I played much better. - It is not true. - Jo. I had the record for juniors. He won twenty-nine matches. He had the record in Major League. - How do they do? - It is fantastic with the hospital. They can make everything possible. The doctor is a kind of magician. Mo... Are you okay? Yes. - Who are you? - Lily. Lily... What should I do, Lily? The doctor, the donor has disappeared. - What? - How could he disappear? I gave him adrenaline. I was away for a while and then... Do you mean that it was a false alarm? There is no donor? - Unfortunately not. - What? It is very unfortunate. Stay with Tim, so we are calling you. - Tell me one thing for me. "We must find the donor! Ask when he left. - You heard what she said. - For five minutes ago. Sanandra! What is going on, Mo? - I do not know, Lenny. - What do you mean? It was a misunderstanding, Monsignore. You got that right in. Are you sure that it was a strippklubb? - Yes, it was. - Was there any sign? - Yes, that was it. - Did you see it? - No, it was very small. - What was it? "Bare It". He may not have got far. Damn! - Timmy donor must be here somewhere. Is that him? - Where are you going? - Thaddeus! Now she is together with the priest again. What is happening? Lily does not want to talk to you, understand you do not it? Well, you... What would you do? "We can do whatever you want. - It does not matter, Dad. I'm expecting mom. You do not stay. Shall we go to the zoo? - You used to love the zoo. - You promised that we would see monkeys. "But we did not. - Would you like to do it? - Want to see the monkeys? - It is not possible. It is closed. What idiots! They do not respond when you threaten them. - See you. - Where are you? - I go to the zoo with my son. - Monsignore, it was a... - Is it the car keys? - Yes. It is Lily. Thank you. - Hello! Where are you? I'm right back. Wait! Mo! - Where are they? - To the zoo, I think. - Have you seen Sanandra? - She went with Owen and the stripper. - They went that way. - I must find her. - I must find her Owen. - I need to find Lily. - I will go with you, Len. - You sit in front. Since he can walk he can not be so close to death. There is something there. Closed. Damn! Imagine that you are a stupid, alcoholic drug addict - - with mental health problems and internal bleeding. - Where would you go? - That I dare not even guess. I need a drink. Where the hell are they then? You hear that, Bananas? Look! I saw something down there. - Are you sure? - Enough. - Come on, come on... - Watch your page! - What the hell? - Binky are funny. - When you're used to his humor. - I'm not laughing! Lenny... I go out and pushes you. I know who you mean. He was here before. - I do not know his name. - When was he here? Before he was hit. I had to ask him to leave. Come on... to the left. - I do indeed! - Left! What are you doing? Are you going to destroy his family fortune? Instead of criticizing me so think when Lenny says something. You can at least pretend as if you are listening. All rich guys are the same. They have forgotten you tomorrow. Fucking cripple! If you CRASH my car and you'll replace it! Did you hear? "Fucking cripple"? Your new friend talking to you, Binky! This with Lily wants to leave Bananas... Everyone understands it but he. Will you and Mr Bananas not at all on the kid? No, not really. I got my own problems. The show is stopped, and my partner believe that humor is superfluous. - Here are just drug addicts. - Slovo is the drug addict. Since he is a damn poor, small pundarjvel. Do you? - Owen, the fuck with you. - I know Slovo. The asshole. - He has whores on Market Street. - It may be he. He is a lefty. I remember that very well - - for he holds his balls so when he piss on you. So disgusting! - He threw water on me. - Look at Sunset Boulevard. - Check it out here, shit boot! Or this! Can I help you? - We would like to see the monkeys. - Unfortunately, the zoo is closed. I have promised the kid that we would see monkeys. He is sick, so it is important. It is a full moon... Can you not help a sick boy having a bad father? Zoo is closed! Open the gate. I earn $ 380 a week. I also have kids. Are you a better dad if you shoot me? "I risk my job. - We know that. Not true? We are just like Indiana Jones. Let's look at the worms... I mean monkeys. Ask them there. Hello... I'm looking for some women. - What women? - Two beautiful women and a priest. - Stick! - Come here. I want to talk to you. - Do you know anything about women? - Everything is so chaotic. Men and women and what the hell... Who are you and what are they? He is a pound key. I saw him at the hospital. "I almost beat him up. - What do you know about the women? I know maybe something, but I want money. - I have money. Come on! - Hit them. - Here. - I love you! - Do you know where they went? - Sure. That way. Come back when you have found them so we partying. My treat. But that idiot like I did not. And you, you little shit... I will kick your ass! - Want to fight? Yes, come on. If you are Binky strikes me you apart and together! Take it easy. I need to find my girl. She is pregnant. - Goddamn it! - Keep looking. - Slovo is perhaps on the roof. - Shut up! This is hopeless. What are we doing? - What is it? - Nothing. Here. Give me that. Lenny think I expect his children. I had an abortion two weeks ago. But I dare not tell for him. Not so fast! Look over there at the container. Is it not they? - What are they doing? "We can save this child. Timmy living, Lily. - It is something completely different. - I know. - We continue to look, huh? - Yes. - Are they lesbians? - Think you! She is my child. But your problem with these women - - may have a different cause. And Lenny says: "Think about what you say. " Owen? Where the hell are they now? Take care, my friend. It is not him. - Did you hear what I said to Lily? - Yes. I love you, Lily! I sacrifice my life for you! What about him? Why does he scream? - He has it hard. - He must realize the truth. - What are you doing? - Looking for Timmy donor. And so you just run around without saying anything to me? - Don't you see that I get worried? - Calm down and help us. Honey, there are thousands of pounds on the streets. His name Slovo Zasto... or something. He left the hospital on foot and have no money. - Can we talk? - You paid someone. Was it him? Are you my personal nightmare, huh? Wait... What guy? Be somewhere? I have a pocket full of clover. - Do you know what you have? - No. What do I have? Not shit. - Your crazy bastard. - It hurts! Damn. I bleed... Waste-not bleed. They rot. - Come. I buy you a drink. - Why did you have no money before? Do you want them, you come here and give me a kiss. - Stop it. - I kill you! - I think he is in love with you. - Do not go. What the hell is this? You have my suit. It is fucking my suit! See what I mean? It is difficult to know quite certainly who does what with whom. Come with something constructive, Binky. Otherwise, stomach ache again. Thank you, Father. I invite all to a round! Priests do not drink, huh? We have to kill people for to earn money. How much did you get? Lily! What are you doing here? Are you tired of paying the booze? We are looking for a guy who is hurt bad. - Have you seen him? - No. No, we do not. You do not stay. We shall probably find him. - What do you say, Owen? - I will stay. That is a good thing, but you are actually a little in the way. Lenny and I have problems with women. You do not improve matters. - Should we not help the boy? - Yes, yes. But women also. It is a little complicated. Why not help your fellow who is in prison? - Did you to their problems, Owen? "This is what I mean. You do not really understand it with women, right? You understand, perhaps one third, but of three thirds. I go nowhere until the boy is safe. - What about him? - He hears voices. Voices? - Have you seen anything? - The guy has blood on it. - Why are you doing? - I cut myself when I shaved me. The great lover has not had enough. Is not it amazing? Idioten come back. A dry Chianti. Omrrd, not shaken. With olive and... - Is he? - Yes. What can I offer two beautiful women? What the hell? Am I at Roscoe's? Give me the waffles and chicken. And some wine with it. Third round? - Final Round. I just wanted to let the odd evenly. There is no problem. - Come. You going to the hospital. - I feel good. Give me something to drink. - You walked before you had been helped. The doctors wanted to pick out my body before I was dead. - There is nobody who wants to kill you. - Who the hell are you talking to? Do you think I listen to you, bitch? - You are corrupt. It is true. - Is it really ass donor? Give me a drink. - His kidney is similar certainly a taco. I would like to propose a toast. - For you, sockerpullor. I like to donate my favorite body to you. Should we not get drunk and naked and stick in our bodies i... Owen! - Owen, release him! - She has the right, Owen. - Take it easy. - Make him about it, Father? It will conclude that we are arrested for murder. He hears voices. We must take him to the hospital. - Do you want to see them close up, Timmy? - Want that? - Is it close enough? - Yes. He just wants to health. - Is it fun? - Yes. He is a true fighter, huh? - Mo Potter. "We have found the donor. He is unconscious. Come to the hospital with Timmy. Yes. Hello. Just because I'm unconscious I agree not to die. - Close the fucking music! - Take your filthy hands! - Keep your fingers, bitch! - Now it fucking be enough. Move it! Concerned he you? I kill him. - Lenny, do not do it! How is it, Lenny? If you want my kidney so you must kill me! Do you bad! There is no one wants to kill you! Look, Dad! Is there nothing you want?

Alcohol, women and all things are going well. But a television, I can not arrange until Tuesday. I got all the rest. Only you will help the boy. You are priests. Go up and talk to him. Maybe it's my last night. HERE GOES. - Come on home to me. - Oh my God... I fall down! Come now. Stay there, old boy. - Are you okay? - My dad took me to the zoo. - What is happening? I had to negotiate to get him down. Whores, alcohol and drugs, mr creditors. Lenny pay. - Know how sick he is Lenny? - Better than you, old man! Keep the boy and the clown situated away from me. - Are you all right, Lenny? - I have no choice. Mr Bananas? Mr. Bananas, you that gorillas can swim?

I just came on what nice mother you could have been. How are you? I am a businessman. I know how the tours going. Why are you so happy save little Timmy? - If you kill me, he is finished. - There is nobody who wants to kill you. Except me. But I hate prison too much. Lenny, this is fun! I love it.

As long as he sings We know at least where he is. What is it with Timmy? - He is up there and sleep. - You idiot... What are you doing? - What is he doing? - You do not impress anybody. "I sacrifice my life for Lily. - You can not make it so. - How long? - Two minutes, maybe. - Fuck you! At least three. Viewership she here? Did she do it? What to see? A clown with skull in the pool?

I used to hear funny things inside the head. - I do not anymore. - You are a good clown, Bananas. But you care not about the kids more. Lily says that I left be fun for... Nonsense, I think. Not to be shitty, Lily - - but Bananas was funny before he met you - and that you are lesbian has nothing to do with it. It does absolutely nothing if you are a lesbian. - Binky... Yes, Lily. Wearing say it. I'm not a lesbian. - It does not matter. I think just on the track. I love him. - Binky, now go. - She has ruined your sex life. Stop it! It was not what was the problem. Well, maybe for her. This is what I say. You fucked her. That was why she became a lesbian! Children have a natural strength. My neighbor has a boy who like that I will. When I am with him I ignore everything else. I need a pinch of air. Watch him. I will shortly. Owen. Owen, wait! - How is Mo? - Good. Just great. What is it? What are you seeing? - What is it? - No! Listen... I have decided. So let me be in peace. - Are you gonna shoot him? - Time is running out. I must ensure that this success. Do you know if the gun is secured? - Lily... - No. Owen is right. I may look at the gun. - Forget it, Owen. It does not work. - Lily... Listen! Slovo do not play anymore. He has left! Owen, come! Slovo has disappeared. It is only Peewee. He does not litter. Where are you? The party is down here. - Where are Slovo? - Don't think about him. Why are you so wet? Where are you? - Wait a minute... - Let me go. You do not own me! Now I understand. You let the stripper take... - Turn your child's father? - There are no children, Lenny. - Stop it. - There is no children. - I did the abortion. - It is... Bullshit, Sanandra. - You can not do that to me. - On you? What the hell is wrong with you? "In you"? I, then? And Timmy? What the hell are you looking at? Get out of here, everybody. Right away! Remove that monster. Lion wants to eat me up. He will squash your balls if I ask him. - Lenny said nothing about lions! - Go to the hospital. - If I plug the lion in you. - Fuck you, bitch! Give me the bottle. - And take off my clothes, bitch! - I do not understand what is happening. - Timmy is gone. There is someone in the pool! - Oh my God... - Timmy! - You are destroying our number! - What kind of numbers? - He terrified the people with cold feet. - Man must overcome his fear. - Shit in the pool, only. - Or piss. All pee in the pool. Do never away from the edge, just. - There should be meaningful, Lil. - There should be meaningful, Lily. - What? - Timmy. Bananas, take him up before he is cold! Sanandra, let the kid be. He is playing of course. Course teaches me to swim! - Yes, but... Sanandra. Let him be. What the hell are you, Lenny? You can not swim. I am exhausted. I have given away all my energy. Now there is nothing left. I can not anymore. I am tired. I am tired. - Teach me to swim, Bananas! - Lenny! - Lenny, you big idiot! - Bananas to the rescue! All down in the pool! - And God created woman. - Yes! Come! I live. I live! I have decided to donate my kidney. It does not matter which. I wish only to be reborn. What is he doing? Oh God... Lenny, help me! He has seizures! I think he was shocked. Get some towels! He needs to the hospital. Listen... Timmy may be just what he wants. Say it was a Christmas present from Santa Claus. Yes... Santa Claus... It is Slovo Zastopil. The boy should have his kidney. - Take him away from the table. "This time we do not. Come on! One at a time. One moment. You with the medallion... Complete this. The man is dead. The boy is in a coma. Make sure to do something! Doctor... We found the donor. - He is dead. - When did he die? Approximately 10 minutes later. Mr. Potter, we did everything we could - - but the donor organ was destroyed. I do not how he could live so long. But Timmy, then? Are they good? He gets dialysis and... - I can not hear God anymore. - What will you do now? Wait until I hear him again. Doctor... I would like to talk to you between four eyes. When understood Owen that he had the same blood? He tested two weeks ago. But it was something that Timmy said. - I want to be with him. - Wait a minute, honey. Let him be together with Owen and his father. - Sanandra, we take a torch. - Yes, do it. I will stay here if Mo needs me. Thanks, Owen. "I look at Timmy. - Good. My name is Vincent. I will make you ready for the operation. I will make sure You will not feel anything. Thank you, Vincent. Are you sure you know what you are doing? You are a better priest than me, Thaddeus. Maybe. But you are a better person. Please feel free to kiss him. I tell it to anyone. Where are you going? I would like to speak with you. Bananas... You taught me to swim. Forget about the one where the cable shit. We are doing something else together. - Are you willing to discuss percentages? - Exactly. Sorry... Is this the dialysis department? - I'm looking for a little boy... - Timmy is in preparation. Timmy feel good? Mo, I have received your information. I tried to call... - How is my little boy? - Timmy's fine. What are the people? The two women and... They have helped Timmy. Why? They know not him. I do not know. I do not know.
