He was a big fan huge pools. Why it is empty? My mother wanted tiles handmade of Mallorca, or something like that, I think she does not even asked. A lot of things in this house were not finished. In the meantime, you could swim. No not me. I do not know how to swim. What? Because? I guess I never taught me. Do not mention it. I'll teach you. It is very tasty. I eat my dinner, now. Please advise if you need something. She should eat with us. She likes to eat there. Is weird. IT IS? She likes eating alone. She read the TV guide. Sometimes watches "Telemundo".

I think I'm a little tired of the Cello. Maybe you need a break. Yes. Maybe I'll. I will take a break from Cello. I was suggesting only a week, or something. And then resume. No. You're right. Anyone under 75 years cares more this music dusty and antiquated. Your time has come and has passed. Is not true. I did not say a long pause. I do not suggest this. No. I think a break will be good. This is old-fashioned and obsolete. Anyway, I do not want to talk about it. Where are you from? Oneida, New York. Town near Syracuse. Of course, I have heard. I researched in the newspapers about the pre-war architecture. which involved reading enough on this particular area. It was nice growing up there? It was cool, when I was little.

Yup. Do not be a smartass. Outsmart? I'm not being smart. I'm sitting here solving crossword puzzles. I'll go out. I do not know any of that. It seems to me, the instructions left by my mother They were not as specific, because you do not know where or when I must go. You go to the camp. It does not seem so bad. This will not happen. What's so bad about that? You are going camping. In the field, in a lake, by God. I wish I could go. Really? Camp songs, banal debates and useless conversations Sports, heroes and action movies. All this still on the bus. Not to mention canoeing, obstacle race, campfire and Teen camaraderie. Teen camaraderie is good. You are a teenager. This is a bad idea my mother, not mine.

Nobody cares. - I do not care where I am. - Is not true. I do not think that way, it's a fact. The operation continues, is in camp or at home, reading.

And what happened with Juilliard? I was invited to study there. But they could not give me a full scholarship. I could not afford. Terrible. Not so much. I was not sure He was what he wanted. What did you do then? I got a job as a waitress. I started playing in the subway. I can not believe. Yup. He played old Beatles and ... He is earning a few bucks. There met Dennis. - In the subway? - Yup. He saw me and He began to appear forever. On the platform, trains came and went and I was there, sitting. He gave her money? Yup. Soon after, she brought me coffee and other things. Once again, he gave chocolate instead of coins. It was cute. Then finally I said: Hey, you will say "hi"? What he said? Said that I did not want to bother me. Who loved the sound my trumpet. What did you say? I said... "is not a trumpet, idiot, is a horn. " It's him? I do not remember. It took me to a restaurant Korean barbecue. It was very tasty. And we began to leave. Like lovers? No. That was after. He had a band. Invited me to play with them. He plays guitar. I do not play anymore. You threw it out the window. Yeah, but I'm not proud of it. I let my emotions control me. Where's your horn? I have no more. Why not? It's a long story. I had some financial problems. You sold? I sold, yes. And a good Horn also. It was beautiful. My father gave me when I graduated from school. It was a good surprise. Not even know he was there. I had long not seen. Once ended the ceremony, he ... was waiting in the parking holding a box with a big red bow. Good evening. Good evening. What is the name of the piece Composed for the recital? "A Sunday rain." Is beautiful. I will compose a track for horn. - Hi, Shelly. - Hello, Eleanor. This is Reggie. She dyed her hair. I knew they were going to sleep here last night. Sorry the mess. I could take a cleaned. It's kind of hard working 40 hours per week. And why are you working there? There are many places to work beyond there. Want to know? The place I work is my problem. You will pay my bills? Come on. Yeah, I thought not. Right. Banque the good girl in front of his friend. Where to stay? Do not say you were in "Days inn". You can delete the cigarette because of the child? - Where's Dale? - Sleeping. Like cereal? We cereals. He is fine. Here are the keys. I'll call a cab. Where are you going now? Road. Road? I thought I had come to see his father. Yes I went. And you? It was in the hospital? Bother going there? Do not scream. He is mad since coming here. I want a taxi in Penvik street, 59. Yes, to the bus station. Thanks. What is this uproar? He is in a coma, Dale. Yes I know. They said you They called and never returned! You know the coverage military covenant? Almost anything. That's why we called. Just do not understand why? It would have been so hard for you go and sit next to him? He's your brother! And he is alone. I have not seen you around here, when he was bedridden. So do not come with sermon. Let's hope the corner. Come back here, Eleanor. Go to hell! Hey, Eleanor, calm. Can be? I never come back here. From here, Eleanor? Eleanor? I'm sorry, just had it in the cafeteria. Okay thank you. Tasty. Never go back there, for real? - At where? - Your home. He said he was never going back. Who knows? Maybe one day, if my brother back. Who knows? I worry about my sister, but sometimes I want to strangle her. She could come with you in New York. Of course. I'm thinking to go to the west. To the west? I have a friend in Idaho. Earn good money on the ski slopes. Always says you can I get a job there. - Looks cool. - Is very beautiful. I saw some pictures. It is not always so cold. So that's what going to do? Yes, I think so. - And the horn? - What have? Someday I come back to play. Back yes. Why not read your book? I'm done. "Grapes of Wrath". A story joyful for you. You have a gift and the obligation to use it. What you mean? You do not even know if I am the worst Songwriter the world. I think not. It would not have been chosen for the band of the best, if so. And it would not have been invited to Juilliard. It is a crime to deprive the world of his art. I did not say that art is dead? Yes. And still dead if the great artists leave the horn and move to Idaho. Promise me I will return to play. Promise me you'll come back for your music. I come back, if you go back. Combined. I think I dozed off. His breathing is deep when sleeping. I was dreaming. We were in a lake I went when I was little. Dennis was there. Did you love him? I think so. Or at least I thought. He loved you? He said yes. He said he loved her, but who knows? At first it was cool, but then began to mistreat me and lie a lot. I think We never know. Think will marry and have children? Many questions. Excuse me. I am curious. I think not. I think these things have not the importance they say. - Never seen it work. - I do not agree. - Is sentimental. - It might work. If a surrender to another. As if they were one, can function. The problem is finding someone who delivered to you, and that deserves its delivery. Think that You will see him again? Do not. If someone does not treat you as it deserves, then you do not deserve to have you. My father always said that. And I? You what? I will see you? I'm right here. After it leaves. You're leaving, right? So back to see you again? If you want to. We can write and so on. Contact. Something tells me that a year from now will not even remember my name. Is not true. I wonder if someone will love me. Chances are pretty good. - How old is he? - Twelve. He's great, you will love it. Hello, Reg. Come to Korina. Hey, Reggie. Pleasure. She has a beautiful home. Thank you.
