You act like some real blue blood, a royalty. I wasn't aware of that. Thank you. - Noticed, that you're class too, baby. - All right. I gotta tell you something. If a man came by with a fifth of whiskey, I'm afraid I'd go with him. I could get a lot of booze out of Willbur. I'm giving up too much. - I don't know about the next. - Hey, I'm the next. - I'll suply the booze. - How? I'll get a job. (laughter) What happened to you along the way? You're weird. By the way. The first thing I noticed about you, were your legs. Really? I guess I got lucky with legs. It's the brain I was shorter though. Oh, yeah. Hey. I could look at a woman's legs for hours. I've got nothin', but time. - ? ?crazy. - That's crazy. I dunno. We're all in some kind of hell. And the madhouse is the only place, where people know they're in hell.

But I wanna make myself look good. Hey Jim, can you hold this stuff for me for a while? Yeah, sure. Last time I saw you, you've got nothing neither a woman nor a radio. Hey, Jim. I'm used to radios. Wanda, this is Jim. Jim, this is Wanda. - Hi. - Hi. Me beer. Yeah, likewise. Hey Jim, can you cash this check for me? I signed him. Hey, what's this? You're not gonna believe this, but that's an income tax refund. I found it in the mailbox of the old place. You mean, you worked last year? Six month in a toy factory. You don't know how men suffer for children. Hey, Henry. You're gonna buy one or be one. Hey, I'm gonna be one. Give her a beer. - Yes, sir? - Shot of bark whiskey, please. - Hey, old timer. This one's on the house. - I thank you. Thanx, Jim. ? ?Take this.This covers the rent, I'll keep the rest. You trust me? Why not? It's easier that way. Oh, look at this. Schifern Incorporated - labourer, no experience. Oh, look at this. Shifrin Incorporated - labourer, no experience. Hey, that's me. I'm gonna run down there, I'm gonna hop on the pass. Henry, are you losing what's left of your goddamned mind? You mean, you gonna leave me here all alone? All alone? Hey baby, there's Jim, there is Lilly. Come on. What are you doing with a woman, Henry? Lilly, sometimes I think you could use one too. Four whiskeys. Look Hank, why don't you go tomorrow. We just met. When you ran off like this, I feel you're trying to get away from me. Hey, baby. I'm doing this for us. We're be able to drink with class. We don't have to be barflies, returned from the grave. - Thank you, bartender. - Ok, oldtimer. Hey, he didn't pay. He already paid. Oh, god, I will get a job. Yeah, hey. To the working class. Right. - To us. - To us. With gods help. No chance. Even the devil wouldn't have you. Hey, what's your problem? Hey, you got any of those little mints for breath? Oh yeah. Baby. Excuse me, who are you? Hmm, the eternal question. The eternal answer: I don't know. - How do you explain this recent unemployment record? - Hey, anybody didn't get a job. - Takes some man to make you a hard worker. - Excuse me? Hey, I was just joking. Everything here seems to read 'none'. Hobbies none, religion none, education none. Even where they'd ask you sex you put none. Hardly none. Yeah, you can put down now. So, how did the job go? Oh, they gave me a hard on. They couldn't use a hard on. This is a world where everybody's gotta do something. You know somebody laid down this rule, that everybody's gotta do something. They've gotta be something You know, a dentist, a pilot, an arc, a janitor, a preacher, all that. Sometimes, I just get tired of thinking of all the things that I don't wanna do. All things that I don't wanna be. All places that I don't wanna go, like India, like get my teeth cleaned. Save the whale, all that. I don't understand that. You're not supposed to think about it. I think the whole trick is not to think about it. Oh, I guess Wanda went home, huh? - Henry. - Yeah? Eddie came in with a fifth of burbon. Tonight's his night of, Ben's working his shift. I won't miss Eddie tonight. Henry, Wanda left with Eddie. Huh? What? - Jim? - Yeah? Scotch and water. Humanity, you never had it from the beginning. Hello. I paid the rent. Did you get the job? Yeah, I start tomorrow. Matred D Musso at Frank's. Listen, I told you not to leave me alone. - Don't hit me! - Hit you? I'm not your goddamned pimp. Stop acting like one. Why it had to be Eddie?!?! - He symbolizes everything that disgusts me! - What? Obviousness, unoriginal macho energy. Ladies man. You're right. He's not much. I made an error, an unhappy error, but I'll drink. When I drink, I'm moving in a wrong direction. You know, every time I get with a woman, something happens. Sometimes it happens sooner, sometimes it happens later. - This time it happened pretty fast. - ? ? you don't own me. Hey, that's right. Nobody owns anybody. I just thought, that we are something special. Because we're just green corn. Hey, what are we? Just people that pass in hallways? I guess I expect too much. Hey, I can't handle this scene, you know. I ought to be a fucking monk. Yeah. (phone rings) Hello? Natali Sorensen. I know this sound like I'm a lunetic or something, but I have this reason why I wish to talk to you. - Well, what you wanna do? - Well, what can man do with a third rate chipi. - You keep talking like that and I'm leaving. - I'll open the door for you.

Oh yes, I'm allright. If I wanna see you? Well, you know what Tolstoy said. Tolstoy! Tolstoy said: "Regard the society of women as a necessary unpleasentness of life and avoided as much as possible. What? Why? Yes, I know. Hey. I know that I'm in your apartment, but I paid this month's rent. Yes. Sure, I can always use a drink. What you've said you're calling from? Oh, allright. I'll see you in a minute. How's your head? Oh, my head needs a beer. The booze is on Willbur Evans. It's probably the last time, I won't be able to run on him. I guess it's not fair on Willbur, but he's got nothing but money. Ooh, poor Willbur. What did you do when I was gone? Where the hell are my panties? Where the hell is anything? Did an earthquake hit this place? Oh, well, I was looking for a lottery ticket. You don't play the lottery. Oh, well, I. hahaha Is your head really allright? It's just fine. - What did you say? - Oh, it's hatred. It's the only thing that lasts. That guy beats his old lady and I hear he killed two guys. Oh, shit. What the fuck's he doing out? I don't know. He killed one man, they put him in, and he got out, killed that oher guy and now he's out again. He killed one man, they put him in, and he got out, killed that other guy and now he's out again. Maybe it was selfdefence or maybe it's our penal system. Anyhow, he's out on parole. He must jack off his parole officer, when he comes around. - I'm getting out. - Oh, I'm sorry. = Get up you whore! Maybe this guy had a reason for killing. Hey, most people think they do. ? What we're gonna do ? Well, us? Us is gonna drink, I hope. Pour me one then. Thanks. I feel kind of sleepy. I don't know what it is. The booze or what, but ... - I need a nap. - Hey, you'll go ahead, I'll watch things. By the way, I didn't get that job. Tomorrow is lighter. I've been a waitress, a typist. I can do it again. Hey, you don't have to do anything. I'll work something out. This thing upon me, like a flower and a feast. This thing upon me, crawling like a snake. It's not death, but dying will solve it's power. And as my hands drop the last desperate pen. It's an cheap room. They will find me there. I never know my name, my meaning. I know the treasure of my escape. Henry? Yes, what is it? - Are you there? - Yes, I'm right here. Henry, I'm going to die. What? I'm gonna die. I just saw this angel. He came to take me.

Did you hear what that son of a bitch said? - He said you're allright. - That son of a bitch said I was too fat. He had no right to say that. Do you think I'm too fat, Henry? - Oh, no, no. You're just right, you're perfect. - I thought so. Thank you. Look, if you're going after a job in the morning, you better get some sleep. All right. I really saw that angel. His wings were moving. Well, I'm glad he had the wrong address. I would have missed you badly. You're lying as a baby. Hey walk, you're hung over, why don't you go another day? Huh? When you're feeling better go look for a job. What do you want me to do? Go back to my drunken bable? Yes. The angel came. That was a warning to get straight. Hey.

You can't doubt it ? ? I don't think so. - Why did you send your stuff to us? - Well, I like the title of the mag. Why don't you stop drinking? Anybody can be a drunk. Anybody can be a nondrunk. It takes a special talent to be a drunk. It takes endurance. Endurance is more important than truth. Anyhow, you've had some luck. We've decided to accept your last story. And we pay upon acceptance. You've changed you're address quite a bit, don't you? I had to hire a private detective to find you. Oooh, the guy in the hat, right? Hey, hahaha. Oh, hey, wait. I can't cash this fucking thing.

A man is dying. No I tell ya it's for real this time. There a guy on the floor, gutted. Ok, hurry. Hey, baby, we've got to get out of here. I tell you it was an accident, that sucker tried to kill me. It was like God intervened. - What happened? - Wasn't my fault, he fell on his knife. Shouldn't we tell the police? I don't want to make a new discovery in jail; Hey, they've got the wrong kind of bars in those places. Give me the cheque, I'll go in and get it cashed for ya. Hey, what's up? Hey, baby. Hmm, you know, for 75$, I'll suck you till your asshole rumbles like a volcano. - Oh, I can alway tell a class lady when I see one. - Faggot! Five hundred dollars. Oh, thanks much, really.

This ? ?. She doesn't know a damn thing about me. - But I know something about you. - Really? You've been jailed twelve times. You like Mahler and Mozart, ? ?. You hate movies. You like avocados and Schopenheimer. Sound's like your man did his homework, baby. When I read your stories, I had to find out. They made me feel. And they made me curious, very curious. You've been really right. Why do you live like a bum? I am a bum. What do you want me to do? You want me to write about the sufferings of the upper classes? This is maybe news to you, but they suffer too. Heey. Hey, baby. Nobody suffers like the poor. Little worried about that guy, who've got knifed. Think he got it in the side. If he'd get in the stomach, that's bad. Fuck you! Maybe, they're in love. Aah, you call that love? I call it unoriginal exhibition. Maybe, it's only that you want to be that one who's kissing her. Maybe. I don't put it down on parade. Why can't you be more romantic? Think of love as being, say on a rollercoaster. Look at these vain idiots. What they really need is a little dent. That's the way they like it. - Are you crazy? - Yes. Stop it! That whole thinh was dumb, childish, the desperate act of a spoiled asshole. So you hired a dick to find an asshole. Take the left to this black gate with no one out. Hey, open sesamy. What do you want to be, when you grow up. Hey Talia, I'm not pretending to be anything. That's the point. I'm glad this' the point. That's the guesthouse. - Do you need a drink? - Yeah, like a spider needs a fly. I'll get the drinks. - You're the bartender. - Ok. How does it feel to be on the other end? Oh, either way is greatest, when the bottle pours. It seems to be a limited world. Is there anything else to it? No, it's a selfsufficient illusion. One of my editors left those here. You know. In the guesthouse you could write in peace. Hey, tell me baby, nobody who could write worth a damn could ever write in peace. I take it, you don't care for my world. Baby, look around it's a cage with golden bars. You better go now. I'm sorry for all of this, I'm not used to drink. Hey, Tally. - I'd better sleep now. - Where's the bedroom? There you go. I can't sleep with my clothes on. Hey, wait a moment. Tally. Tally, baby. - Hey, Tally baby. - What is it? I've gotta go. What is it? What went wrong? Look, baby. I belong on the streets. I don't feel right here. - I feel like I can't breath. - You're just not used to easiness. You can grow into it. Hey, baby. Grow's for plants. I hate roots. You had all this feeling in your stories. I thought maybe it came from you. - I'm sorry, I've gotta go. - No I'm not gonna cry. You fooled me, that's all, it's been done before. - Hey, Tally. I didn't mean to do anything ugly. - Get out. Hey, Wanda. Wanda. Hey, Wanda. - Where the hell have you been? - Fetch you a little drink. Where've you been? I smell it. Parfume. Get away from me, you pig! Hey, you're crazy. Look, what I've found. That's frightening. - What have you done? Did you kill somebody? - Yeah. That's for you, before the angel comes and takes you away. You crazy ass. How about a refill? Ooh. Hey, what're you doin'? Dressing. I know, but why? I just can't stand lying under that cover of money. I feel so dumb. Hey, money isn't dumb. They say it talks, you know. By the way, cops came by. - Came by where? Here? - No, not here. It was next door 308, two ambulance guys carried him out. He've been knifed. Was he alive? He must have been,he smoked on his cigarette. Oh, great. Henry, I didn't get the job. That's ok. We're gonna take that money and we're gonna go to the bar. - And we're gonna celebrate. Ok? - All right. Hey, Henry! Yeah? - Scotch on the rocks. - Oh, the same and I'm buying for the house. Look, your credit's no good here. You've got to have the green. This can't be true. Start ? ?, my friends are thirsty. - ? ? Henry. - Friday night. Eddie's gonna jab you tonight. ? ? It's too late for that. Eddie would think I was ? running ?. You care what he thinks? Huh? Hey, if Eddie whips me, you're goin' home with him tonight? One mistake is enough for me. It's you and me. But, I'll tell you something. If I find that one you went to bed with, I'll rip all her parts of. Oh, honey it wasn't me. Hello my friends! Eddie, you're in too. Pour youself a drink. Listen, you owe me forty bucks.

Oh, all my friends. - What is this, take out service now? - Yeah. - Oh, shit. - What? I mean, drink up. Come on in boys. Henry, I want to talk to you. hey. I told you, I didnt want that cage with the golden bars. Who is this? Wanda, this is Tally. Tally, this is Wanda. Henry, I'm gonna scurry on over there for a few minutes. Hey, Eddie. Drink for the lady. Vodka, Eddie. - Tally is a publisher, she took one of my short stories. - Yeah? What else did she take? Excuse me, I don't want to be rude, but haven't I seen you before? - Are you a friend of Henry's? - Yeah, I'm a real good friend of Henry's. How about you? Well. Henry and I are quite... I'll say you are. That's the parfume. Hey. Look girls, there's realy nothing to get upset about. Let's have a few drinks and listen to some jukebox music. Who's gonna pay for that drink? - I'm gonna separate you from your parts you westside bitch! - You get away from me! I just want to talk to Henry for a minute. I asked, who's gonna pay for that goddamned drink? - Here. - Thank you. Now look girls. Be realistic. None of us hardly know one another. Basically, strangers to each other. Heh, we've passed one night and Wanda and me met in a bar. Be realistic, there's no way, there's no reality to any of this. Another round of the drinks. If you don't get out of here, I'm gonna peel you away from your parfume. - I have a drink and I attempt to sit here and drink it. - Really? Just get out of here now, before I finish you off. All right. I know you need this. Good luck. Goodbye. To all my friends! Come on my friends. Let's drink up! You're gonna fight him again? Hahaha, that's a laugh!
