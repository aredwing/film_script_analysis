 

                        Hey Nisso, what's up? - Everything's cool. Cool. -What's new? - It's all bullshit, I tell you. There's no beginning and no end! It's all bullshit. The British Empire is passing by. Salute, Shimon Yosef, Salute. Didn't I tell you It was all bullshit? The House on Shlush Street Are you sure this is the house? Yes, mom brought me here plenty of times. Come on, don't be scared. Mom, I brought Sami. He couldn't believe I knew how to get here. He wanted to see you. - See me? What's to see? Why didn't you tell me? What did you think I was doing? Go on, go home. Mrs. Goldfein is coming, and I don't want her to see you here. Sami, dear, take your brother with you. Come on. Take your brother. Sami. Hello, Clara. These are your kids, aren't they? Such a big boy! He's a young man! And you are so young, Clara. OK, let's go. -Clara, are you not done in the living room yet? In a minute. -What about the laundry? -Already done. -Good. Look how low we've sunk, Sultana. Stop that, Mazal. Such is life. Life? What life? In Egypt we lived in a palace. We had servants and maids. And here in Israel, my daughter Clara is a maid, cleaning other people's houses! You call this a life in Israel? There's no doubt, Mazal, everything here is different. We have to adjust. - Woman, life is like a pie. Some have it baked, and some have it unbaked. You win some, you lose some, Mrs. Mazal. That's how it goes. How's everything in the carpentry shop, Halfon? Just fine, man. - Mom, you're hurting me! Sit quietly. Stop fidgeting. Wow, hot mama, ain't she, Sami? Jacko, stop, get off your mother. I'm not a horse! Get off... Leave your sister alone. Sami, take him away. Mazal, did you hear about the butcher's wife? Her husband caught her with his brother, and killed him in that bath house on Pinnes street. Just like Cane and Abel. Oh my God! It's her fault, driving them both crazy. She's got worms down there. Women are the source of all evil. - No, Mazal, men are! Men are the source of all evil. Right, Clara? - What are you asking me for, Nisso? Ask your girlfriends. What's that, mom? Too much talking... So? We're just taking a break. Mazal, Mazal. Life is like an onion. If you try to peel it, you end up in tears. That's enough, Rafael. Life is a pie, life is an onion... When are we going to play some poker? We will, don't worry. -This one thinks of poker day and night. That's what kids are like these days. Clara, my sweet. My beloved. You sit in the corner all day long, lighting up this yard. Why don't you make me a cup of coffee, my sweet? Geez, Nisso, you are so spoiled. Better you should get a wife to make coffee for you. Don't rub it in. Where will I find someone as good as you? Don't worry, I'll get you your coffee. -You're a sweetheart. Such a womanizer! Sultana, the world is like a cucumber. Sometimes you have it in your hand... If you want to touch it, than only above the shirt. Ziona, where are you? - I'm here, mom. What are you doing over there? Come home now. It's late. Coming, mom. Sami? Is that you? Life is hard, isn't it, Sami? Stop reading. The light... I can't sleep like that. Turn away then. Mom, the light. Sami, Sami, enough with the books. You'll ruin your eyes. In a minute, mom. Let me just finish this page. Jacko, you poor thing. I hope you don't have an attack tonight. Sami. The light. Sami, you need to get up early tomorrow. You can't be late for work on your first day. Baby, It's not for long. Maybe next year you could go back to school. -Yeah. I'll go back to school and you'll go back to mopping floors. "Clara, are you not done in the living room yet? " Why are you talking to me like that? You don't get it. I do get it. You're ashamed of your mother. That's not it. What's "not it"? Are you embarrassed by my cleaning other people's homes? Well, yes. But I agreed to go out and work, didn't I? I did. Yes, you did. But that's how it goes, Sami. You're my first born and head of this family, because dad is gone. Sami, baby. Mr. Goldfein? Yes, boy. What do you want? My mom... I... I'm Sami. Clara is my mother. Sami! You're Clara's boy. How could I forget? Your mom is a great lady. Good worker. Come in, come in. Grossman! Grossman, come here! Grossman. - What? -This is Sami. He'll be working for us. Make sure you train him well. Teach him things. Have you ever had a job, kid? No. That's all we needed here. What are we going to do with the dirty little Frenk? Stop that. Come over here. Come here. See this guy? This is Max. He's top notch. Would you like to be as good as he is? Don't worry, Mr. Goldfein. He'll do just fine. Kid! Kid! Come here. Come look at your son, Clara. He's as black as an Arab! How was it? - Fine. Did Mr. Goldfein see you? - Yes, he did. Did he talk to you? - Yes, he did. -What did he say? He didn't say anything. Jacko. Why does he get meat? -He works hard. He needs his strength. I work hard too. Eat. Two. Three. How many, Halfon? What's the rush, man? One card. One special one. I'll see that. One cent. - Son, they'll clean you out! Don't worry, mom... Pass. His majesty's police... - Leave him alone. One cent... and a penny to call. Did you hear that, Clara? A cent and a penny. The great Halfon puts in a penny. Halfon, what do you do with your money? Where do you get all your money from? Jerk. Where do I get all my money from? From the governor. I get a monthly salary. Go on, get out of here. For the kids, You're a big hero, Nisso. What do you say, Clara? How do you like me now? I'm a hero only for the kids? Leave me alone, Nisso. What do you want from me? You know what I want, right, Sami? Some mother you've got there. Say, Sami, am I a hero or what? T ell the truth. Tell him, Sami. Tell him what a mouse he is. People on death row keep singing the national anthem. And he's sitting at home. Slacker! Slacker. That's what you are! You see this guy from Beirut? Sasson. He's better than you are! No shit, Halfon... If you weren't my best friend... I would... Go play with the kids. If I was on death row... I would tell them: "Stop! "I have one final request. "I want to see Clara. " And I'll be standing there handcuffed, ready to die. And they'll be bringing my honey in. My sweetheart. And I'll be looking into her eyes and she'll be standing up, all honest and whole. Look at her, guys. Look how she's standing there, proud like a mare. And then... I'll sing to her, very softly... Stop it, Nisso. Stop. Stop the bullshit. Clara, he's really crazy about you. That's all I need, at my age... Stop it, Nisso. Enough! Why stop, Clara? You can give me a kiss, can't you? After all, you're not a virgin. - Stop that, Nisso. Enough. Get back to the table, jackass. The game is here. Come on, Halfon. Put your money where your mouth is. Cough it up. Here's a dime. Here's my salary. See that? Watch and learn, cub scout. Sit down. Sit down. Here's your dime. And your salary! Full house. Full house, man! Is your hand better? Cheater! Wait, Nisso... Mine's better. Four jacks. Say, mom, do you like Nisso? - Nisso? Nisso, the king of show-off. Just like your dad. My dad? - Your dad. Who would drive everyone in Alexandria crazy. But the horses would drive him crazy. He would bet all his wages on the horses. But he loved you. - Of course he did. He loved me so much... He was crazy about me. He would get so jealous... You know, I used to love dancing. The foxtrot, the Charleston. After our wedding, he saw me dancing once... He didn't talk to me for three days after that. After that time, I never danced again. I never even went to the movies after that. He was worried I would be looked at and pinched in the dark. You know, the first time I saw him he was wearing a cap. He'd stand at Blordi's window for hours. That's where I worked, waiting for me to come out. You have his eyes. My mother would tell me: "Why are you going with him? "He's broke. He doesn't have two cents to rub together. " When we got married, he didn't even have a change of underwear. You loved him. It's been six years since he died. It's been six years since I let a man touch me. Aren't you...? Don't you think...? Don't you want to? - Get remarried? -Yes. No. I've had enough. I've got you kids. I have you. But you're still young. You... It's your life. - My life? Do you know how old I was when I married your dad? Eighteen. A month later, I was pregnant. You. And then it was your sister Esti, before I could even flinch. And I... I know, a mother shouldn't speak like that to her son. But Sami, you read books, you know what life is like. I withheld your father from touching me for four years. How he must have agonized... After that... came Helena, and then Jacko. And then... Me, Sami... I haven't had any other joys in my life. You are my only joy. Olives, onions. Just like an Arab. With your money, you can eat Caviar. With his money, he eats olives and onions. Max, how are things in Russia? Frenk, you know why I don't like Arabs? Everybody knows. You can skip the rest of your speech. Besides, it's not funny any more. Sami, how much do Grossman and Goldfein pay you? Already you're teaching him capital issues? The little Frenk? That's it, Sonya. We're closing. Can you close without me today? - Fine. -Thanks. See you. - See you. Jackass! You know, I also... I also used to read books on the street until one day an electric pole ran into me. That man was probably softer, right? OK, you got me. - I got you back at the store. So why did you let me take it? - So why did you take it? I wanted to read it. I would have returned it. This was the first time. - That you would have returned it? Gorky... It's French. - And in Hebrew? When... while... earning my keep. In Russian: Velogech. OK, look. You got the book. Can I go now? Well... I was curious to find out which book you took. Now I'm even more curious. How about a cup of tea? You don't like tea. Maybe...? Is this how they drink it in Russia? Do you approve? - Not bad. Were you born there? -I was born here. My parents came from there, and we used to speak Russian at home. How about you? Egypt. And you spoke French at home? - Ladino. -Not Arabic? We only spoke Arabic outside. So where is your French from? - We also spoke French. And in school. - Hebrew, Ladino, French, Arabic... And a little English. - English? And some Italian. Some Greek. And I also speak Armenian. - No way! I picked up English from movies. Italian from the neighbors, Greek from my dad, and Armenian from my best friend who was from Armenia. Do all Egyptian Jews speak that many languages? Most of them do. You know, this is the first time I've... had a cup of tea with... A "frenk". Is that how you pronounce it? I didn't know this word until I came to Israel. I used to think a "frenk" was a German tribe that conquered France. That's not what I was going to say. What were you going to say? - I wanted to say that... This is the first time I'm having a cup of tea with a Sephardic guy, who... speaks 25 languages, reads Gorky, and... How old are you? - I'm 15. No, Older. You can take a book home if you want. Just let me know when you do. I can't read at home. - Why not? Well, you can read here any time you want. I'll leave you a key under the doormat. You wouldn't mind? - I don't think so. If I mind, I'll tell you. I have to go. Wait a minute. What's your name? - Sami. -Sami. You forgot something, Sami. This is yours. Thanks. What's your name? - Sonya. -Sonya. Sami! Sami! Hold on. Good evening, Rafael. - Good evening, buddy. Are you just coming home from work? No. Way to go. You're becoming a man... Great. Listen. Sami, do you remember what I told you about the thing? Oh, that! - It's... It's... I don't know. -What do you mean? Where else would you go? Join the Hagana? With all those people? Forget about it. look, come around sometime. If you like it, great. If you don't, you don't. Have we got a deal? Deal. - Give me your hand. OK, now go wash up. Clara, my sweet. I don't know what I would do without you. Nisso, I don't know what you would do without me either, but... You asked me to sew, I sewed. But I won't have this. Won't have what, Clara? - Don't pretend you don't know. I don't know what's in this mattress. You didn't tell me. I don't want to know. No, don't tell me. Nothing to tell, Clara. It's better you don't know what it is. The more you know, the more you worry. But what I have in my heart, my sweet, my life, is an entire ocean. English soap. - English what? That's what we used to say back in Egypt. That's what you are. English soap. You make a lot of foam. - You're right, Clara. I make a lot of foam. You don't want any of that. Stop it, Nisso. Nisso, stop it. Why, Clara? You're here, I'm here. The mattress is here. The night is young and you are young. No moon, but who needs it when you're here, Clara. My moon. Nisso, stop it. I'll scream. - Why scream, Clara? Do you want to wake the neighbors up? Tell me why not. Quietly. Nisso, I'm not your sweetheart or your moon. I'm not your love. I'm a widow with four kids. Don't I have enough trouble? You are all I need now. -Yes, Clara. I'm what you need. You've got kids and problems, but no love. I'm through with love. - Are you, Clara? -Yes. Really? - Really really. I've been a widow for six years. Many called, I never answered. Why? Because I need a ring on my finger first. And you are not one to marry. Clara, my love, a ring? A thousand rings. I would give you a ring for each finger. I would give you my life. But I don't own my life. And I don't know what will happen to me tomorrow. You're right. You shouldn't. You have enough trouble. Nisso, trust me. Come on. Your wish is my command. You don't want to? Fine. I'll try again tomorrow. What is it, Sami? I think the drill is broken. It's bent. Hold on, OK? How is everything, Sami? Shit. - No change? Yes, there's a change. In the hole. - Which hole? The drill hole. Sami, if you don't fight them, they'll shit all over you. They'll end you. Do you hear me? I can see you here, sitting by the same drill, making holes. What's with that chanting over there, max? Sorry, sir? -Stop playing your games. Do you hear me? Grossman... -Shut up! I don't want to hear another word from you! I'm sick and tired of your jokes. You're affecting my workers here. I don't know what you want from him either. And you, if you don't go back to your job, you can go home, and don't bother coming back! Come on! - Stop yelling, Grossman. You're not scaring anyone. Stay there. Stay where you are, I said! Don't yell, Grossman. This is not a sweatshop. Shut up and get back to work. This isn't the workers' union, either. Not the union? We'll make it the union. Max, Are you organizing a strike? I'll kick you out, Max. I'll kick you out like... like a dog! What are you doing, Asher? Get back to your grinder. Now! This will not end well, people. Get back to the grinder, I said. I'll call the police! The police? What are you doing in there? Get out! Join your friends! Sami, are you coming with us? Where to? -We're going to the union building. The Brener House. Do I have to go? Only if you want to. Should I stay? - You don't have to, Sami. Hello. - Hello. Am I interrupting? No. Come on in. You told me I could come here if I wanted to. Sit down. Are you not working today? We're striking. - Striking? I'm going to have lunch. Want some? -I already ate. Thanks. And then? - And then I left the Kibbutz. And your husband? -Stayed there, growing corn and his own belly. Do you ever see him? - Not for a long time now. I thought of moving to a Kibbutz once. -Maybe. Why not? But you left after 10 years. - I did, yes. The sense of camaraderie. - Huh? -A sense of camaraderie. Sonya doesn't have a sense of camaraderie. She's a loner. I didn't love them enough, so they didn't love me. And you prefer being alone? - I don't know. Right now, I do. I can do what I please, and not what the members' assembly decides. Alone. No family of 200, no husband. And they all know what's best for me, how I should live. Who I should love, who I should talk to. Our back yard is just like a Kibbutz. A family of 50, and a mother. And you can't read at night, or have even one moment to yourself. There's no where to run. And everyone's giving you advice. Yes, but I don't know. - What's that? What I want to do with my life. - I don't know yet, either. And I'm 25. When I was little, I wanted to play the piano, But there wasn't one in the Kibbutz, so I played the violin. I played it for 10 years, and... When it's time, you'll know. Maybe. And if you don't, that's fine, too. For instance, I know now that I have to go to work. Finally... it's over. What time is it? - Six o'clock, I think. It's late. I thought I'd be able to finish the book. Finish it tomorrow. Did you like it? Not so much. Why not? I didn't get it, I think. How can she sell herself to all those old geezers for money? She'd be better off working in a book store. No, I mean, I get the money part, but... How could she, without loving them? How could they, without loving her? It's not the same thing. If it were me, I couldn't do that. - Couldn't do what? Have you ever been in love? I don't know. Do you have a girlfriend? I used to, but now I'm abstaining. Abstaining? I don't care about that anymore. I mean... Going out, watching a movie, walking on the beach, and then all that... I'm not interested in the girls I know. Well, I would stay, but I have to go. My mom will be worried. She... Yeah, you'd better go home. "Warning: A Jewish soldier imprisoned by the enemy "was sentenced by the British conqueror to a flogging. "If the punishment is executed, British officers will suffer. "Signed: The Nationalist Army Organization. " Sami. What are you doing here? Think of your mother! Running around in the dead of the night. Jackass! Camel! Sasson, where are you? I'm here, Abu Jaber. Through there, quick! Run home! Who were these people, Sasson? What do I know? Nobody. Let's go. Go to the pharmacy tomorrow and get everything on my list. Don't worry, Clara. Jacko will be fine. - I hope so, Doctor. I hope so. He's such a good boy. How's he doing, mom? - How's he doing? If you were here, you would know. But mom, I... No buts. I know where you were, and I don't want any of this! I don't want that. Leave that for others. All I need now is for you to get caught. Where are you going? Come on, sit down. I want to talk to you. Mr. Goldfein said you haven't been to work for two days. That's right. And you didn't tell me anything? Where do you go every morning with your backpack? What do you do all day? I go to the workshop. - You go to the workshop. And you don't work? We're on strike. - On strike? What strike? Do you want Goldfein to fire me too? But everybody else... -You're not everybody! Don't be like them! But how can I not? - You can, Sami. You can. If I can, you can also stand it. Think about your mother. - But what do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? You told me to get a job, I did. I didn't decide on this strike. - Don't yell at me. I can't do this anymore, Sami. I don't have the energy for this. You're not helping me, Sami. What's going to become of us, max? -I truly don't know. This strike has gone on too long. That can't be good. You don't think we'll win this? Look, we want Goldfein to sign an agreement with the union. That much would be an accomplishment. Winning... look, even if Goldfein gives us a raise of a dime a week, you'll keep drilling holes, Asher will forever cut metal and me... No, Sami. At least you can leave and get a high school diploma. You can go to night school or learn a profession. But what will I do for bills? There's plenty of Goldfeins out there. You'll find something... The face! Punch him in the face! In the face, in the face! - Communist! Go back to Russia! You want more? No. Take off your shirt. Go get cleaned up. That's what you look like. Are you sure I can stay here? - I'm sure. Unless you'd rather go out on the street during curfew, and be thrown in jail for the night. With a mug like yours... the Brits will never let you go. Sami. Sami. Sami. Mom? Where were you? I asked where you were. That's for keeping me up all night worried. That's the last time you slap me, mom. Do you hear me? The last time! Don't touch me. Your sandwich is in the kitchen. Go, go ahead. Go have a strike in the workshop. I'm not going back to Goldfein's. I don't want his charity. - Don't want it? Fine. Do as you please. I don't want it either. You hear me? I don't want it either. I'm done. From now on, you take care of your brother and sisters. I did my share. Do you hear me? I've sacrificed enough. I won't do it any more. If you're a man, you don't need your mother any more. A man should take care of his mother, not the other way around. A man... See for yourself. What's to lose? He's got a heart of gold. A real, educated man. Did you tell him I have four kids? - Sure I did. I don't know about this, Madam Koka. -What's to know? Go out with him a few times, maybe you'll get lucky. -Maybe. At least take your feet off of the bed. Today it's not for you, Nisso. - When will it be for me, Clara? Here you go. Jab out my eyes so I don't have to watch this. Madam Koka, When is he coming here? He should be here any minute now. He is a punctual person. Mazal, Mazal. What's going to become of you, Mazal? What's going to become of me, Clara? Your old mother. Will you throw me out on the street? I'm not getting married yet, mom. Not yet. Koka, where did you find this guy? Does he have any money? Do you think I would bring a beggar to meet you? He has a house, a land, some chickens. May God give him whatever he is lacking. God help us. What will you do now, go work in the fields? Stop it, mama. Be a farmer? Hello. Hello, Mr. Haim. Clara, Mr. Haim Zinger. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Please, sit down. - Thank you. Here you go. - Thanks. -You're welcome. I'm Rafael. I'm Clara's cousin. Nice to meet you. And this is Sasson, my cousin. - Nice to meet you. This is Mazal, Clara's mother. - Nice to meet you. -Likewise. And this is Sultana, my wife. Won't you drink some Arak? - No, no. Thanks you. Have an olive. A cucumber. It's nice here. What's nice? Nice... It's a dump. It used to be nice. What did he say? What's his name? Zinger. - What does Zinger mean? -Singer. Singer? Have him sing something, so we can hear... Why didn't you say he was like that? - Like what? He's a man! I looked for him high and low. How will I get rid of him now? - He's just right for you, Clara. Meshulam. - What's up? -Nothing. What's going on here? - A celebration. See you later. For that? You're leaving me for that? I was nine when I arrived in Jerusalem. I studied in the Heder. And when I was 16 I joined the Jewish regiment. Did you hear that, Clara? He's from Russia. A friend of Ben Gurion's... Where are your kids? Out walking. They'll come home soon. Sami, come here. This is Sami, my eldest. Some coffee, Mr. Zinger? You don't have to call me Mr. Zinger. Haim is fine. Just Haim. - Sorry, I'm not used to this. And he's Ashkenazi. So? We're all Jewish. Thanks to our forefathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He's too old. He's my husband's age. Enough, mom! How old was your husband, may he rest in peace? Old age, Mrs. Mazal, isn't measured in years. Nissim Hudara. Well said. What did I say? No, really. If they hadn't told me you were... Clara's mother, I would say you were her big sister. God forgive me. - Don't worry about it. To your health. Cheers. Sephardics and Arak always go together... Sami! How are you holding your drill? Move over. Sami, when's the wedding? Halfon! -What? - Where's the key to the chainsaw? In that box. How many times do I have to tell you? In the box. Here, put your hand here, clutch the handle and turn it. You see? Here you go. Say, Sami, can I count on you tonight? Halfon. -What? -The glue is spilling into your coffee. Oh my God! There goes my coffee. "Halfon" Go to sleep. Sleep... All of you, get up! You! Get up! Me no good. No good. Sick. No, no. My husband! Father! Four children! Four children. sick... Leave me alone! Me, No good... - Jacko! Get up, you bloody jew! Me, no shoot. Me sick. Me English. No shoot... Take those two bastards. - No! No! Children! Me mama! Shoot here! Shoot here! Me! Mama! My children! Damn them. Are they planning to kill us? It's been three days! I'm going out. I don't have any medication for Jacko, no food. I'm off. My God, Clara, where are you going? They're shooting people! Shooting? Fine. You only die once. It's okay. Stop! Go back. Go back home! Food! Children... food. I want food. No eat children. Stop or I'll shoot. Shoot shmoot. I go doctor. Children sick. Children sick, I go doctor. Burn in hell... Come with me to the police. - OK, police. OK. Bastard... Clara, are you nuts? What are you doing here? Sasson, quit annoying me. I need food and medication for Jacko. Let me go now. Clara, you're a hero. Going out on a day like this? Even on a day like this we need to eat. I need food and medication. Let me see if I can arrange a "pass" for you. Wait here. - A pass? What's a pass? What is it? I know this woman. Her son is very ill. She has to see a doctor. She needs food, medicine. Thank you. Here you go. You could have gotten me in a lot of trouble. Go home, quickly. Here, look. A pass! Idiot. I was so scared... To hell with all of them. Sit down. -Mom... - Your mom was so worried. We have some food, mom. Thank God you're back safely! - We have eggs, some oil... weren't you scared? - I was frightened. No fear. - There was fear. Lots of fear. Hello. Sami! What a surprise. Where were you all this time? I was busy. I was looking for a job, and then there was the curfew. How are you? - I'm good. I'm real good. And you? I was worried about you, you know? You used to come every day, and then you vanish for two months. I didn't even know where to look for you. I thought you'd understand. - Understand? Why I didn't come. - I don't. I wasn't exactly busy. I mean, I was busy, but... that's not why. You know why. - No. Why? After what happened. - What happened? You know, I really missed you. - I missed you too, but... after what happened, I didn't know... I didn't see how we could... How we could have a future. - A future? Yeah, after that night. - A future? After that night? I don't understand. That night, like you call it, I enjoyed myself. Didn't you? - Yes. I did, but after what happened later... I realized we had no future together. We're not the same age, and I thought you might... - Look, Sami, we were friends, right? We had fun together. We were glad to see each other. At least I was. No, I was too. I... You know our friendship was very special to me. I could talk to you... about things I never told anyone else, ever. But after it... after what happened, I don't know. OK, fine. Goodbye. But I came here to... - You came to return the book. No, I... I don't know why I came. Look, it was nice. Past tense. Now it's over. Too bad. That's how it goes. Like an engine. He had a store. When? - In 1925. Where did they live? On "Shaarei Shamaim" St. In shelters, in the Ashkenazi lot. How much is that? - Two pennies. Hello. How many are two plus two? Four pennies. - Good. Where is it? - Here. -Are you sure? Yeah? Count to three. One, two, three. Here. -No. - Yes. -I'm telling you it's here. See that? - I saw you put it in your pocket. He's a little devil. What have you got there? - Here? Nothing. If you don't resemble your family, you're a bastard. Going out? - yes. The food is in the kitchen. You just have to heat it up. Like Abed-El-Wahab wrote in his poem: "What's written in the sky the eye must see" This dress looks good on you. - Yeah? It makes me look younger, don't you think? Yes. Younger. Haim would like it. Sami. Excuse me. - Of course. Sami! Sami! Come here, Sami. Sami, why are you running away? I'm trying to talk to you. Are you mad at me? No, I'm not mad. You know, I look at you, and it reminds me of when I first arrived here. I was about your age. Those were different times. It was during the Ottoman Empire. I took every job I could get my hands on. But what's interesting is that I always wanted to get married. To have a family. A wife, kids. I almost got married once. She was a nice girl... good family. But it didn't work out. Never mind. Sami, your mom is a great lady. I don't have to tell you that. You know her better than I do. Besides, she's giving me a great gift. My mother? - Yes. A gift? She's giving me you. You see, Sami, I don't know if I'll ever have kids of my own. And even if I do, they'll never be like you. My father gave me this watch. That's the only thing I have of his. His father gave it to him. I'd like you to have it. - Haim! Take it and take good care of it, like I did. Hello. - Yes, Hello. May I have one, please? - Yes. Some pepper? - Thank you. -You're welcome. Sami! - Thank you. Sit down. Would you like a drink? That's right. You don't drink or smoke. You're an all around good kid. Sit down. Maybe I will have a drink. - Macho man. The first time always hurts. How's life, Sami? Life? What do I know about life? Are you still not speaking to your mom? I don't know what's going on anymore. Who's not talking to whom. How's Haim? That Ashkenazi screwed us over, didn't he? Screwed you over, maybe. He gave me this. On account of my mother giving him a gift. A gift? Never mind. He's not right for her. Sami, right, not right, let her live her own life. And you start living yours. It's about time, Sami. ...from nothing. Look at me. Why do I have a bike? Because it's a big world, Sami, and life is short. What? Baby, what's the matter with you? Wait a minute. I asked Haim not to come here again. Why? - I don't know. It didn't feel right. He would open doors and hold them for me. He would take me to the cinema and out to restaurants. Once, while we were walking, he even bought me a flower. He wanted to kiss me, but I couldn't. Besides, Sami, you're not that crazy about him either. If you had loved him, maybe I would have, too. I know that, Sami. Sami. Sami. Go see who it is. Is Nissim Hadera home? Nissim Hudara doesn't live here. - What is it? Who's there? Where's Nissim Hadera? Nissom Hudara's not here. He doesn't live here. We won't bother you, lady. We just want to look around. Sorry, lady. You can go back to sleep. Sleep. Nisso, run! Sami, the bike. Take care of the bike. It's a shame about the workshop. What are you going to do if they burn it? -If they do, so be it. This is just plywood, isn't it? We'll finish this thing, and lock up. We need a few hours of sleep. This shooting. They're crapping all over us! What do they want? They got their state! Man, Jabotinsky was right. OK, Halfon, enough with the speeches. They got, we got, They shoot, we shoot... you're leaving this neighborhood, just like everyone else. What do you want us to do? Get killed? What do you want? And you were teasing Nisso. "People on death row keep singing the national anthem". You're flapping your gums here, and he's on death row. Halfon, you're a good carpenter, but if you'd just shut up... if you only knew how to shut up. Are you going to stay here, Sami? - Where else can we go? What about Haim? - Hasn't been around for months. Since before the UN proclamation. Too bad. So he didn't want Clara after all? Enough, Halfon. Enough. Albert, watch your manners! God, Albertico, get up! What's wrong? -The Arabs are taking over Tel Aviv. Get up! I heard them on the street, speaking Arabic. -What's wrong? They will kill us all! - Are you nuts? I can't hear a thing. Alberto, get up. - Go to bed. Go to bed. I hear nothing. - Oh God. I'm going to Clara's. They were speaking Arabic. Yelling: "slaughter the Jews!" They left us here to die. - Mom, stop it. Go to sleep. Go to bed. I'll go check it out. I don't like this silence. - Stay here. I'll take a look. No, I have to see for myself. Who's there? Why are you shouting, Shimon Yosef? Shitrit, I saw someone over there. You must be delirious. I see nothing. I swear to you on my kids I saw someone go through there. If you don't trust me, go. I'll cover you. You're crazy. What's the matter with you? You saw it, you go. I'll cover you. We'll go together. If we both go, who's going to cover us? Shimon Yosef? - Who's there? Sami. Sami, what are you doing here in the middle of the night? What's with the entourage? You scared the daylights out of me. What's going on? - What's that? God! It's a quiet night, thank God. There's nothing going on. Look, this silence... Clara, come on, don't worry. Our boys are all over this place. If, God forbid, something happens, we're here. Right, Shimon Yosef? - Right, Shitrit. No fear. The kids. The kids! Mom... Are you all right? Wait a minute. we can't stay here, mom. Where am I going to go? Where? Where everyone else goes. They'll take care of us, like with all the other refugees. I don't want to be a refugee. This is my home. I want to stay here. I'm... I've had enough of strangers' homes. So go get Haim. Go get him. - He doesn't want to see me. He will. He loves you. He will. I can't make a laughing stock of him, Sami. Don't you see? Yes, I do. Go get him. Clara. Clara. Don't tease me. You will not throw me out of here again? Do you know what you want? Are you sure? A wedding? Immediately. "Enlist!" Plaster stains on the right ventricle. Have you ever heard of such a thing? That's what he told me. I said: "Doctor, what is that? " He said: "It's OK. Many people have lesions on their lungs". I thought "I have TB. I'll never be drafted. " Do you think they'll let us join the Palmach? I don't know. First let's make sure we are drafted, and take it from there. Go. Sami, remember to tell them you're 17, otherwise... Ziona, clean over here. Faster. Sami, do you hear that? Yes. Don't worry, Clara. There was no alarm. Those are probably ours. I don't know. I sent Jacko to school. Maybe those are ours. I just hope they don't draft you both. It's bad enough Haim was drafted. What does he write? - He writes... He's... He's a good man, Sami. A really good man. Jacko! Mom! Jacko! Jacko, my baby! No! Jacko is in there! Jacko! I saw... Where's my baby? - No, hold her. My boy, my boy... Your brother. Your brother... Give me my baby. My boy... Let's go home, Sami. There's nothing left to do here. Leave me alone. Jacko, Jacko... - Patience, my dear. Patience. Sami! Patience, my love, Patience. Sami, come to me. - You don't need to cry so much. Sami, come to me. Sami! You're leaving too, Sami. My baby. Don't forget me. From now on, nothing will ever be the same again. They say the world is big and wide, and has... beautiful things in it. I never saw them. Maybe you will. Go now. Just go now. How are you, Shimon Yosef? - Hey, Sami. What's new? -I already told you. It's all bullshit. Take care now. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Translation: Shaily Giveon
