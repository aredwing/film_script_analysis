 

                        1 You're on WMPW Bard College radio. Guys, why don't you introduce yourselves to our listeners? My name's Travis, I play guitar. I'm Barry, I play the drums. My name is Anna and I sing. So tell me. How did the band meet? I closed my eyes and I imagined this ray of light. Shut up. Well, believe it or not, we were all born in the same week. So Travis and I were really drunk celebrating our birthday. And we run... we run into Anna really drunk celebrating her birthday. So wasted. Improvising song after song. Yes. So, um, where do you see yourselves down the road? Where do you see yourselves 10 years from now? Uh, I really think we keep doing what we're doing. Working hard, making the right choices, and we'll be doing huge things in 10 years. I feel like we're on a path. If it has some twists and turns or whatever, we're gonna make it happen. Wait, I got your crystal ball right here. It says the road we're on continues. We'll either be famous or dead. It'd been six years since any of us had seen one another. Me and Travis and Anna. We all went our separate ways, but I promised Travis we'd spend our 30th birthdays together. For the last week my wife been asking why I travelled halfway across the country to see this guy that I hated. The truth is, I've never loved anyone more. For whatever reason our band really meant something to people. I mean, we had fans. But in the end it didn't work out, and I always felt a little bit guilty about that. If I had known Anna was gonna be here this weekend, I never would have come. Are you guys, uh, rekindling your thing? We never had a thing, man. So let me guess. She knows I'm coming? Yeah. Who cares? Brilliant. Let it go. Be here. You look good here. She'd gone on to make something of herself. She was a star in Europe and in Asia. But to me, she was just the one who got away. Anyway. Wow. So why did I come back? Maybe I just needed to prove to myself I could. Maybe it's because I made a promise. Or maybe I was hoping to get a glimpse of the magic again. You look good. You look damn good. You uh, you lost some weight. Yeah. Yeah, Julie and I made this plan. We do a five mile jog before breakfast every day. Well I'm glad you came out. I know it's hard to get away. OK, ready? Oh my god. This is so cool. Oh, eh. At least one of us made it, right? I haven't exactly made it, but... Ah, I think there's a half a million YouTube viewers that would disagree. People will come up to her in the streets singing her songs. Well how do you leave all your adoring fans? It was time. See that? That's where I'm taking you tonight. What's over there? You'll see. He's still limping. You did all you could. Yeah. I really missed you guys, Yes, indeed. Well said, brother. Hear, hear. Man, I haven't had food-food in forever. What do you mean food-food? I mean, last year I decided no more sauces. Come on, you're from Kansas. You can't betray your roots. A man needs steak sauce. I figure, why dump liquid all over your food? Hm. Taste? Taste. Taste. Gonna go with that. There's a taste, would be another reason. Oh, in Cambodia they've got this fish sauce that they put on everything. It's amazing. Very hot and it makes your tongue feel like it's disintegrating. Wow. Yeah. God, you've been everywhere. Mm-hmm. The only traveling I do is for work or a wedding. At least I'm building up frequent flyer miles. Mm! Me too. Yeah. What's yours? Um, a little thing called Premier. Mm, Premier Exec. I should have known that. You gotta earn the unlimited domestic upgrades. I can see that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, this is great. The best is the story of when I got it. I was this close, and I realized it at work. And all of a sudden I just got up from my desk and flew to Seattle for lunch and back just to earn my status. The fuck am I sitting here with? Barry, that was fucking great, man. You liked when I softened up at the end of the verse? Yes! That was genius. All right. Hold on, hold on. I gotta write this down. No, let's just do it again. Don't write the fucker down. Let's do it again, come on. Give me the ball. I've been in the grip of love. Intimately acquainted with T-Rex. So dive into a deed. I've been fed up. I mean, I've had enough terrors in my sleep. You're the only one I need. BARRY AND ANNA (ON Then that soft wind hits me from the south. Oh, how I... So I was going across camps. I see this guy with his piercing blue eyes. He's got the frosted tips. OK. He's got a lot of gel in it. It's looking like a real, you know, a douche bag. Aw. And I said to myself, Anna, you must know this man. He was the scholarship kid. He was dropping $50 on a hair stylist. That's a tool. Every girl wanted to be with you and every guy wanted to be you. And we got high just being around you. Yeah, that's because I gave you drugs. That's true. Speaking of which, um, hello? No. We met that day too. You weren't there. I guess my first impressions don't set rivers on fire, but I'm a slow boil. Come on, I was sexy, right? Say yes. Yes. Tonight is all about you, dude. Happy birthday. It's you're night. Hehe. Tomorrow Anna. What about you? No, I'm good. You guys coming out here is plenty for me. Oh, that is some regal shit. Cheers. I'm here. All right, check this out. What is it? No way. Oh, man. Looks like you're about to tell him a secret to the universe. I'm still waiting for that one. Yeah. That's later. So I'm 5, maybe 6, and I go into the school bathroom. And I see a perfect pile of clothing. There's Velcro shoes at the bottom with these socks tucked neatly inside. There were sweat pants folded on top, military style. And on top of it all? A t-shirt. And then I realized, this kid takes shits completely naked. So I got... I figured I got to get to know this kid. This kid... this is an interesting kid. A couple days later, I see him out in the playground and he's being chased by the asshole kid. What'd call himself? Skeletor? Harassing him with this plastic crossbow. And I wait for the right time, and they come around. I go whack! Whoa. Knock him on his ass. I stand over him, I point to Barry, and I say, that's my best friend. OK? I didn't even know your name. Wait just one second. This is great. We go on this school trip to DC, right? And everybody knows Bareman. He's like the horniest guy in school, right? So he whacks it 4 times, 5 times a day, something like that? And we're all staying together. And so, you know, he's got to hold off. And he's just getting angrier and angrier the whole trip. I was like, Barry, what are you so... why are you so upset? He's like, oh man, I'm just so horny. When I get home, I could whack it to anything. And I'm like, anything? You could whack to anything, Bareman? Like anything? Yeah, I could whack it anything. I... I could what it to a... and I don't even know where he got this... I could whack it to a golden fucking Gold... a golden cube. A golden cube. A what? Can I please take over the story here? A golden cube because it's floating in space and it's It's devoid of any sexuality. It's a competitive challenge. Yeah. He didn't make that clear. Wow. So I get home, I lay on my bed, and I focus. And I'm picturing this gold cube floating in space. And then I think of Stacy Carter. Or some other hot chick. And I stop. I become fully flaccid. Start from scratch, and I do it again. And I did it. You did. We don't know if you did it. Nobody knows if you did it. How do you prove that? How do you prove that... I guess you just have to trust my word. Hey, here's to being pathologically honest. Pathologically honest Barry. Shh, you be quiet. Shut up. Get in my mouth. Uh, happy birthday to us, right? To you. Me. Ha... happy birthday. That's my terrible birthday song. Yeah, you killed it. Look, I need more booze. This is giving me anxiety. Shh, make a wish. Nice. It's almost time. For what? I forget how many there are. Come on, brown eyes. OK. This cave, it's not just a cave. Shh. People have been coming here for centuries. I saw a pack of coyotes standing where you are. Staring in. You go into the cave, your deepest desire comes true. Does that mean there's like a genie that's in a bottle in there? No, no. None of that genie shit. See, genies, they give you what you want. This cave knows what you need. I think I'd rather have the genie in the bottle. I think you'd just like anything that's in a bottle. Shut up. You. Go in. Oh, come on, Travis. Please. Come on. We see it. Go in. You scared? Yes. Going in. No. OK, all right. It's so narrow. Have you been in there? What's that dripping sound? OK. Are you OK? Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Bet that's good for the property value, huh? Magical cave. You should go in, Barry. It's fun. OK. That's uh, pretty cool. Yeah? Cool. Should we, uh? You're not going in? No, no. Travis. You're doing better than I thought. He took us to this magical cave. No, we didn't do drugs. I promise. It was my monster. Mm. Good night. Got everything you need? Um, heh. Yeah. Um. I love you, Bareman. Hm? I love you, Bareman. Uh. Good night, dude. I said I love you. I love you, Bareman. I love you, Bareman. I love you too, man. All right. All right. Anna? Hey. You OK? Sorry, it was just a bad dream. You just got startled. What's going on? Just a bad dream. Just, screaming. What kind of dream? It's nothing. Yeah? Yeah. Good night. Oh. Hey! No! I'm just checking out the latest from the new world. Travis. Oh. Ah, you even sleep with this thing? It's not funny. You must be hooked. Don't stay up too late. Shit. Look, I'm figuring it out. Yes. Soon, OK? OK. I love you too. Be nice to me now. I'm a cripple. Got it? Got it! Yeah! Still got it! See that? Yeah? You uh, you just check out his patented I mean business mode. He pushes his glasses back up the bridge of his nose when he's about to kick it into another gear. Ready, Bareman? Ready! Yeah. Another friend decided to come. She's got the bedroom. Anna. It's a surprise for me too. OK. Yes, I took my jog. It was gorgeous. Come on. You know, I pictured you out here. Oh, yeah? Is that what you imagined? You know, we need a guitarist. You're playing with some good musicians. Ah, yes. They're good. We need a wild man. It'd be like old times. Except now you're a silver fox. Can you believe Bareman's jogging? Ooh. Yeah. Ooh. You've got the numbers all colored in your head. You can't resist because my love's got a half a life. One by one is seven, seven times. And the dealer whispers into your ear, you better bet it all. Ooh. You do the long division in your head. You can't resist because my love's got a half a life. And you have carried the ones who remained too long. And the sphere whispers in your ear, you better bet it all, you better bet it all. Ooh. Shit, what's the bridge? We never found it. Really? Yeah. Shit. I know. I know we said no gifts, but I really couldn't help myself. Ah, yes! Cool. Nice, thank you. Try it on. I think I got the right size. Dude, you look great. It's jogging, dude. Yeah, you look good. Feels good. It fits. I love it. Open yours. Yeah. Yeah. I couldn't stand the idea of you having all these songs stuck in your head. So... wanted you to be able to record them. Thanks. Mm-hmm. When I was out there on the road, everything felt like a dream. It's just felt so unreal. And then when I got back, it was like everything was too real. I feel... I feel like I have to choose a path. And even if I don't choose a path, you know, that's... that's like choosing a path. So no matter what... Exactly. It's kind of startling how similar it is to what I've been thinking about the last few years. Yeah. Yeah. You were saying? Oh. I'm... I'm just saying that I feel the... the pressure of choosing a path, you know? But I want it to be the right one. I know we're all, you know, we're super busy. And we really screwed each other over a lot, but... fuck, I miss you guys. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I want to know what Barry's thinking. What are you thinking, Barry? Uh, I don't know. Uh, we've got to stay friends for sure. Nah, I mean in general. What are you hoping for? Uh, I don't know. I feel lucky. Really, that's all? It's not... nothing else? Well, I mean, I guess there's things that I will want. But right now, basically, I've got it. And honestly what's cool is this stability. Ah. And the best part about it is this sense of independence. Being a tax attorney gives you a sense of independence? OK, sure. I have partners looking over my shoulder and I'm super busy. But I get my work done, I put in my hours, and everything's... Everything's under control. It's, um... to me that's independence. Look, there are a lot of paths out there, and that can be paralyzing. And I'm just happy I found the right one. You are impressive, you know that? I get needing to make a living. I do, I get it. It's just the way you embrace the whole thing as the one and only path. I didn't say that. Yeah, you kind of said that. Nah, it's really... t's impressive. It really is. OK. Here's how I see it. You got a bag of marbles in front of you and you reach into the bag. And you're thinking, man, I'd like a blue marble. A blue marble would be great. I really want blue. You reach in that bag and you pull it out. Bam, red. And you're like, well that's red. That's not blue, I really wanted blue. But you know what? Red's OK. Yeah, no, red's good, red's good. Red's just fine. I reach into that bag. I'm looking for the shiny marble, man. I'm looking for the shiniest marble in there. If I miss it, I reach for it again, and I reach for it again, because I'm going to get that fucker. Maybe you just passed up a bunch of perfectly good models because it's not exactly what you pictured. OK. Now we're talking, all right. Whatever. I didn't mean that. No, I think it's the first thing you met all weekend. Hey, maybe you're right. Maybe if we went with the jackass manager, it would have been our ticket. That jackass manager? He's worked with some serious bands. Have you... have you seen what he's done for Marvin Taylor's band? Or the Resistance? You mean the Connecticut suburbanites who, uh, think they're Che Guevara. Well, they're still together. They do suck. They do suck. They suck. They sit there signing about le revolution with a wink, and a smile, and their cocks in their hand. Well, they put out another album, so. Good for those clowns. I'm happy for them. It makes me feel like anything's possible. I'm just saying they make a living. And I'm just saying I don't want to hear about it. No... do you... Can... Don't. Do you know how hard Anna worked to get us hooked up? Do you have any idea? Yeah, she pounded the pavement. No, no you don't get it, OK? She worked her ass off because we had a chance. A chance? Yes. What? The guy would have watered down our sound before we even knew what our sound was. You... you don't have a sound if you can't pay your rent. You compromise one thing, you compromise everything, man. The great bands? The really great bands? They struggle. But I don't think you have that in your DNA. What is with your mixed metaphors and your... your... your evolutionary bullshit? What... what's so bad about being a decent working band? I didn't go through all like shit to make something decent. Look, none of us we're ever going to be John effing Lennon, OK? And maybe you're still holding on to that. And... and while there's something to... to be said about dreams and... and what we're told is children that we can do and achieve anything. It's also kind of a huge goddamn lie. So what? You've moved on? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we gave it a few years, OK? I had to find a real profession. Music's a... Thats... Real profession. Look man, if you would have just told us that you were applying to law school. You would have talked me out of it. Oh, I'm that convincing? Maybe I should have been the fucking lawyer. It was shitty when you left. It was. Excuse me? Excuse me for once that I made a decision that was for the benefit of myself. Barry. Soaking up the good times. Thanks for having us, Travis. You need to do something good, man. Something real. Me? Me do something real? That's actually very funny coming from you. I'm a productive member of society. What do you do? I'm not some loner losing his mind out in the fucking desert. I need to tell you something. Come with me. My uncle liked to look up at the sky, even then he couldn't take much sun. He wasn't an easy man. We understood each other. When I left New York I... I knew I was coming here. And when I arrived, he'd been expecting me. He loved listening to me play and I loved watching him listen. One afternoon I was playing and looked over at him. And uh, he was just staring up. Quiet. Never seen quiet like that before. I went outside and I burned all my song books and my lyrics. All that. I finally had a purpose. So maybe you're right. What I've done. I can't pay my mortgage with it. It won't get me on any magazine covers. But helping a man die, what is that worth? Is it like a thousand? A hundred thousand? It's like our jam outside. You can't put a dollar sign on it. This place has so much spirit. It has his blessing. We start our album here. Our songs are going to break people wide open, man. Listen. I know it's what you want. You brought the recorder. Yeah, I mean... Well... I've definitely written some new songs while I've been here. Yeah. Yeah, that'd be cool. I'd be down to try it out. I was... I was thinking we'd do something together. Or we could start with what we have. Nah, I was thinking we should start with something new, right? New, right? What? It's always on your terms. Forget it. What? Whoa, what? All of us, together. This is too much for me. Too much? Too much is a good thing. I live for too much. All of us, we're here right now. The band's together. This is the band. No, there's no band. There's no band, man. It's not going to be a band again. Look, I have a home, I have a career, a wife. This is a fantasy. This is a fantasy. Travis. Travis. Fuck. You know what? This is my fault. I said some dumb shit to him. I... by saying I got him the recorder, and this morning I asked him to play guitar in my band. Bet that would work out real well. It would be good for him. For him, exactly. You know what, Barry? I was in the hospital when he was recovering. You stopped returning his phone calls. You left too. You left the country. He wouldn't talk to me. And I need to start my life. You know something? You never even given me a fraction of this concern. Don't. What? Don't what? Barry, you're happy. You're well adjusted now. And what's wrong with that? Do you know what your problem is, Anna? You don't want what's good for you. And if you were single for longer than a nanosecond, you'd have a little bit of perspective. You don't really think, do you? What about hedge fund guy? Oh, Barry. That guy was a rebound. How am I supposed to feel about some rich dude tossing you around before you have Olympic sex? Who said that? You did. Fuck. For your information, I've become a pretty good lover. Nobody's doubting you. Sing Driftwood for me. Please. Sing my song for me. My only. Know him a little now. But it only takes a little for him to break down. And she's really wanting him more. Now she can't remember what all these drugs are for. She only wants sanity. I think that song's about Travis. Travis? Barry. Are you good? Screw good. Good doesn't work for you. Only an asshole can hold your attention longer than two weeks. It was a mistake. And then you thought, you know what? Maybe I'll start screwing Travis again. You and him in a bathroom stall while I was waiting for you at Stella's. Barry, come on. Even then, I thought, you know what? Maybe she's just working something out. Maybe she just needs the time. Hey. Hey, you were like my brother. I know. You just want me to grab you like this, right? Is this what you wanted? I should have grabbed you like this. Stop fucking laughing at me! Stop! Because this is what you respond to, right? This is what you want? You know what I'm going to do. I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna fuck you like a psychopath. I'm gonna fuck you so that you forget his name. I'm gonna fuck you so that... You make song about me. I'm gonna fuck you so you remember. Barry, don't. Barry. Barry! Ah. You're fucking drunk! You go into the cave, your deepest desire comes true. Ah! Hey, Barry. Are you OK? Hello? Yeah. Listen, you're drunk and confused. I get that, OK? OK? Night, Barry. I'm sorry. It's just a bad dream. I'm sorry. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Don't go. No, don't come in. Don't come in. Just stay. S... stay. What's the dream? Am I doing something awful in it? Or is it about him? It's... it's about me. Do you think that Travis went to the cave? Do you think it works? Everything's going to be OK. I'll make you eggs in the morning. Just the way you like them. Then we'll go home. Yeah. Get some sleep. What are you doing? Oh no. Come here. Come here. Right here. Just... just... I'd ruin you. RADIO INTERVIEWER On WMPM Bard College radio. Guys, why don't you introduce yourselves to us? My name's Travis. I'm Barry. I play the drums. And, uh... My name's Anna, and I sing. RADIO INTERVIEWER (ON So tell me, how did the band meet? I closed my eyes and I imagined this ray of light. Shut up. Well, believe or not, we were all born in the same week. So Travis and I were really drunk, celebrating our birthday. And we... We run into Anna, really drunk, celebrating her birthday. So wasted. I think you... Just improvising song and just... Yes. You killed it. Amazing. So good. RADIO INTERVIEWER So um, where do you see yourselves down the road? Where do you see yourselves 10 years from now? Uh, I... I really think if we keep doing what we're doing, working hard, making the right choices, and we'll be doing huge things in 10 years. I feel like we're on a path. If it has some twists and turns or whatever, we're gonna make it happen. Wait, I got your crystal ball right here. It says the road we're on, in 10 years, we'll either be famous or dead. Hey. Have you, uh... have you seen my keys anywhere? I can't seem to find them. Can't find my cellphone. Yeah. Some night, huh? They've gotta be somewhere. Yo. Yo, yo, yo. Did you enjoy your night in the desert? Yeah. It was real nice. How about your night? Barry? Yeah. It was fine. You got nicked up good there, partner. How'd it happen? An encounter with the uh, counter. What else you guys do last night? We hung out, OK? Something wrong, brother? I guess the night didn't go as planned. Things not going according to plan for Barry. Wow, tell me more. I thought we came here to hang out. Hm. I thought we were being truthful. Is this what you wanted? I should have grabbed you like this. Stop fucking laughing at me! Stop! I know what I'm going to do. Fuck you like a psychopath. Travis. Travis, give me that. Give it to me! Enough. I'd cooled down. Thought I'd see if you two were getting along. Oh, you asshole. You should have told me if you wanted to write the first song together. Just stop. Please, stop. Which one of you is doing that? Would you please stop? That psychopath line? I'm gonna have to use that. You're fucking drunk! You're staying here tonight. We're making that album. Jesus Christ. Where you going? Travis. Travis. Listen, man. Look, we're all exhausted. Let's not be idiots. Just give me the rest of my shit back. Stay. I've got a flight. I can't just change my flight. Use your miles. Oh, come on, man. I've got work tomorrow. Julie's expecting me. She's expecting me to call now. We talk every morning. Well, you're going to have to give her the latest update. Or I can. Stop! Is this your new method of seduction? Come on, take a shot, but be careful. You know who wins a fight, don't you? Not the strongest or the tallest. The craziest. I got ya beat there. Although, uh, I think you're catching up pretty quick. Should I punch him in the other eye or do you think it's just going to turn him on? Oof! Yeah. Yeah! Woo! Barry, that's pure, man. That is honest, animal rage. You feel that, Right? The three of us, when we're apart, we're just children. We're making a mess of things. But together we're like a 90-year-old desert guru. Nah, fuck that. It multiplies. We're 30 times 30 times 30. What is that, Barry? Who cares, man? Count it up. That's 2,700. It's 27,000. 2,700 year-old-man. We're older than Christ. We're older than Socrates. We're older than fucking Buddha. Let's take that right here. Let's make the album. Three nights in the desert. I don't even play anymore, man. That's great. That's great. The nameless is the eternally real. You... you're making artistic choices, and you don't even know it, man! Look, Travis. Listen, give us our stuff back. I'll go home. We'll chalk this whole up thing up to desert fever. Come on. And when I get back, I'll call you. And we'll talk about the idea for the tour. I... I know it's nuts, but the offer still stands. I don't need a sympathy job. It's not a sympathy job. It's a real gig for money. Anna, I can't. Wh... why not? I don't want to get into it. Come on, Travis. Say it. I don't like you music. I don't. You took the stuff we were working on and you... you popped it up. You put a syncopated dance beat to it. You sugar coated it. Digestible. Not you. Hey, but it was your big break. I get it. You know what? You think you're a genius. You're just talented. I might not be reinventing the form, but at least I've done something. You asked me. This is what you do to your friends? What does it take to get your approval, man? She nursed you in the hospital for three months after your doped up ass wrapped a car around a tree. OK. Her whole album is about you. I know that. I'm done. I want to go home. Why are you screaming in the night? Come on, Travis. Please, I just want to go home. I know how powerful it is. I gave my uncle everything and he showed me that place in return. Please, I just want to get out of here. There's plenty of time before your flight, so go back in the cave. Figure things out. You know what you need to do. OK. OK. So uh, there's one thing you should know before you go in. I used your phone to e-mail Julie the recording. Julie, right? No, you didn't. I'm not joking. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. I am? He is. I think I am. Confusion, uncertainty. That's what you need when you go in there. You got what you wanted the first time. It's stupid. What did you see when you went in there? Happy? Are you? I'm swell, partner. Oh, yeah? Then I want you, the pathologically honest, to look us in the eye and tell us that you're completely happy with your life. OK. Look at us. All right, guys. Listen, I'm happy. Are you happy? Huh? Are you happy? I'm happy. Happy, happy, happy. I'm not happy, but I want you to say that I'm completely happy with my life. I'm completely happy with my life. I'm completely happy with my life. All right, rock wall. Hi, rock wall. I'm completely happy with my life. How are you today? Are you happy with your life? That's not going to cut it, man. I'm completely happy with my life. Better now? No? This is fucking ridiculous. You think I don't love Julie. Are you telling me you never had a doubt? What do you know about choices? What do you know about marriage or commitment to anything that's actually attainable? What about you, man? I mean, you could train yourself to want anything. A golden fucking cube. That was a joke. You know what wasn't a joke? What happened last night. OK, I screwed up. I'm disgusting. I... and that's something I got to work out within myself. Barry, I'm judging you, man. Do you know why I didn't invite you to my wedding? It wasn't because I was afraid you'd make a scene or steal Julie, no. I was afraid you'd say she's boring because you're so judgmental. Or you'd say, she's nice. Or you wouldn't say anything at all. Because you're so fucking judgmental. Barry. I saw the world through your eyes for way too long. And I made a choice. I wanted something different for my life. Man, I get it, you know. It's biological, I think. You know, you're... certain point you're supposed to stop hanging out with friends. Yeah, you're supposed to become a functioning member of society. You're supposed to churn out babies and punch fucking numbers and ride the train and cash in. Yeah, baby! I get it. You have no place to go, do you? I'm completely happy with you not in my life. Yeah. You're an asshole. Yeah, I'm a fucking asshole. Anna? The world needs fucking assholes! Anna, wait. Anna. Anna. Wait, Anna! Travis? Travis? Let me see. Oh, I'm good. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm good. It was just what I dreamed. A cave. I wanted you to hurt. I wanted you to hurt like I've hurt. This is what I wanted. No. It is. No. It is. I made it up, OK? I made up the whole cave thing. I thought it'd be cool and mysterious. I thought it would... I thought it would make us miss each other. Yeah. I don't care about the cave. I don't care. This is what's real. Anna. When you were in the hospital recovering, those were the best moments of our relationship. You looked at me like you needed me. I need to tell you something. Both of you. I tried writing, calling, you were gonna move half way across the country, and uh... I was losing it. Yeah, I was hopped up on pills. And yeah, it was dark. But I saw that tree. I saw it. It was telling me to hit it. Hit it and I'd be redeemed. We'd- we'd all be redeemed. It was music. I was listening. I went for it. I went for the shiny fucking marble. I went into it. I'm sorry. Back in the day, I thought I was a Jaguar doing 100 down the freeway. And you, you were a beat up old Toyota not exactly sure where you were heading. But I had the feeling that when you got there, you'd stay. And now? Shit. You got somewhere. Man, you could trade it for a whole fleet. You should see my bills. You're good. You went back to school and put in the time. And now you're set to reap the rewards. Maybe in my next life I'll come back as a hardworking Jew. There are some people that might find that offensive. Yeah. I'm just glad you found what's right for you. You remember the way back, right? It's just one road. You want to know why I never went in that cave? I was afraid to find out what I needed. Thought you made it up. Yeah. When Travis said he'd hitch a ride and pick up the truck in a few days. I knew that look. He was deep back in it. I kept thinking about the cave. Maybe we did get what we needed that weekend. We finally let go. Travis used to say it's all a song. We never did find that bridge. Maybe one day we will.
