 

                        Vinod. Shekhar. Lukesh. It's been four days, but he has still got high fever. What is wrong with my son? You'll be fine, son. Son... Are you blind? His entire body turned black. No one takes any notice. I think... Palaram. Palaram. Pass me a cigarette. It's been 1O days. I am nauseous, feel like throwing up. Please Palaram, give me a cigarette. Baba, you will die and the blame will come on me. There is hardly any breath left in you. And you want to smoke a cigarette! Here! Mr.Dhiman. Mr.Dhiman, it's a boy. But you could've fed your wife properly. There is barely any blood in her body. Only 5 hb She will need 2 units. And hurry up. There is an outbreak of Dengue so, there's a shortage of blood. Take this sample. Oh! Hold it. It's only blood. You don't realize the importance of the other's blood... ...until one of your own doesn't need it. "This red tinge... Stole it from my heart." "And coloured the hands in it." "This red tinge... Got so addicted to it." "That I coloured my lips with it." "This red colour...is colouring desires." "It demands love." "This red tinge... stole it from the tears." "That coluored the eyes in it." "This red tinge... Got so fond of it." "That it coloured millions." "This red colour...is colouring hatred." "It's spreading carnage." "It flows, runs and bleeds in the veins..." "It gets lit, heated, "...and listens to no one." "This red colour...made me young." "It beats and brightens intensely in every veins" "Gets restless, makes waves..." "...and can't be controlled." "This red colour...ruined me." Oh! Brother Rajesh. It's me, Suraj. Dracula. How are you brother? Seeing you after a long time. What brings you here? Just like that. - No one comes here without a reason. How many units do you need? Two. Only Two? You should've told me. I would've supplied all you needed. We're old friends. No, I... I'll manage. Your wish. By the way, I met Shankar yesterday. He is back. I am sure you know. You don't. It's been 5 years, brother Rajesh. Where have you been? What are you doing these days? - Nothing. I have put up a small ice-cream factory. - Great, brother. Would you like to talk to Shankar? Shankar once told me... We humans are dummies... ...filled with 5 liters of blood. Kept fresh by a 250 gram heart. And this story... is of that same bloody heart. Listen, tell your uncle Fool Singh... ...to check whether your name is on the list. Fine. Give me money. Such a grown up boy. Don't you feel ashamed to ask money from your father! I was getting you a good government job! Two peons in one family. Isn't that thought humiliating, father? This peon is the one that raised you into a man. Oh father! I feel so blessed. You forgot again... ...to take the offerings, Rajesh. Let him finish sucking his father's blood first. Mom...how does it feel to be married to a peon? You... It's a government department after all. Any amount of work you do is never enough. Hello. - Hello. I wanted to meet Phool Singh. Then meet him. That's me. I am Shakti Dhiman's son, Rajesh Dhiman. I see... Son...you've grown into a man now. How is Shakti? I hardly see him. Thats just like him. - I see.. Son, how about some tea...or cigarette? No, just the list. List? I see... The Lab Diploma List. I see... Did you apply for it as well? - Yes. I see...sit. l'll go check the list. Palaram, get him some tea or something. I am his uncle. I'll be right back. Baba...Palaram has been waiting for you. Go on. Praise the Lord! Just go Baba! why do you turn up this early in the morning! I guess you couldn't take a dump yet, Palaram! Did you eat the medicinal ashes I gave you? What did you give me? Earlier I couldn't do it and now I can't stop it. It's his Karma. Will you take some medicinal ashes too? - No I don't. At least tell me my blood group, Palaram. I need to fill the form for the government orphanage. After all... I am an orphan Baba (Godly man). AB -ve Now just leave Baba! AB -ve What a cute kid. Do you want to be a Baba (godly man) like me? You are too arrogant. You will see a downfall one day. You are destined to be ruined by me. Ramphad, throw this rascal out. My bucket! My bucket! My bucket! My bucket! My bucket! Praise the Lord! I have seen the list. Your name... is there on the list. Congratulations, you have been granted admission. Excuse me; brother...do you know when will the list be out? Where are you from? Saharanpur. What is your score? - 75% Go back to Saharanpur. The cut off here is 95% What brother, you don't need 95% to appear for PIVIT also. I have given that test. Then go to PIVIT. - You are so rude brother! One doesn't address a rude person as 'brother'. 75 percent! Means... Administration? Can I come in, madam? You have already come in. I thought I should ask anyway. If I had refused, you wouldn't have come in, is it? Making fun of me! What do you want? Well. I wanted to see the Diploma list, madam. What "madam", "madam" you are addressing me as My name is Neelam. It is a beautiful name, just like you. Stop buttering me. What were you whispering in Mr.Pushpendra's ears? I was watching everything from here. I was praising you. Liar. I have never lied till date Ms.Neelam. Swear on my mom. What do I benefit from all this? I have already handed your share to Pushpendra. What is your name? - Shankar Malik. I'll read it out for you. - No... I'll read it myself. Your name won't disappear if I look at the list! I feel very shy...when a girl reads out my name in my presence. Your looks will surely slay me today madam! Thank you, Ms.Neelam. Don't forget to tell Mr.Pushpendra. I did his job. You have done my job too! How do I look? Get lost, rascal. Madam - I'll show you! Fantastic - Stupid, fool. Hey...mister...you are arrogant and a liar. There is no 95% cut off. I just enquired. I am not your brother either, didn't you inquire that? Such a Dog! That's 40,000, buddy. You're sure I'll get in right? Bro, my luck says that 101% your name will be there on the list Your luck? Didn't I say your admission will be done! Now go. Go eat an ice-cream. OK. Hurry UP- Only an hour left for the list to go up. Subhash, Sanjog, Yogesh. Our 1,00,000 rupees are roaming around in this crowd itself. Go on. What is your name? Rajesh Dhiman. Do you want admission too? I have already seen the list. You should've told me earlier brother. Unnecessarily I walked all the way up here... I am from Saharanpur, where are you from? Karnal itself I really liked this place. - Really? Have you seen the entire place? - Yes. Sorry. Me too. What happened? I called him a 'Dog'. - And he is the one saying sorry? That's how it works. That one... Let me see. Take it easy! Mamma... Mamma... stay away. Move aside. Come on. What are you doing? For how long are you going to see the list? Go stuff your face in it. Madam, let me take a look. You're done, now go. Oh, I got it! I got it! Look...he is coming. Mr.Dhiman! Hey girls... Beaming a little too much Bloody cheapster. You have many connections, know many lists. Huh! Are you jealous? That's a very filmy dialogue, lad! Want to go for a ride? Why? Why? Should I say it in plain English? I am jealous, that's why! There's no point in just knowing the list... ...you must learn to share it too. Sharing creates stronger bonds brother! ls this yours? That's mine. RX 100! Stop staring at it.. You jinx. Come on, sit. Keys? Just giving you a lolly... pop. I have them with me. Let's go. Before that day, I only sat on the RX 100 in my dreams. There was a "saying" that... If a guy even says that he owns an RX 100 to a girl... "Then the girl will surely become his." No, sir. Don't be silly. Keep it. Sir, the guy is here. He is already here? - Yes. Well brother, I have something important to do Your ride is over for today. See you later. Fine. Wait. Auto! Where are you heading? Shiv Colony. Get on that Harnaam's auto. OK. Shiv Colony, how much? It's Shankar sir's command. I won't charge you a dime. ls he a Don or something? Don? No, he's a God. And what does this God do? Eventually he himself will tell you everything. Take a seat. Where are you from? District Chapra, and my name is Harnaam. What are you doing here? You see, mister, my 'need' to satiate my hunger got me here. I was very happy seeing the Diploma Admission Slip. And the other joy was of meeting Shankar. Shankar who owned an RX 100. There was something about him. On Day One, Dr.Sabarval... ...gave us an orientation of the entire Diploma. Fortunately, Shankar and I were sitting together. And by greater fortune Poonam Sharma was also sitting next to me. By now, she had stopped addressing boys as "brothers". The Diploma in Medical Lab Technology was a one year course. And as Dr.Sabarval told us... ...there were seven departments in the lab. Urine, Stool, Bio-chemistry, haematology... micro-biology, pathology. And the seventh and most important one was "the blood bank". Which was in the hospital's new building. Dr. Sabarval also said... ...that a group of 3 students each, will work in every department for a week. Through his sources, Shankar found out... ...that our first duty would be in the Urine department. That put Poonam under a shock. But when you have a friend like Shankar... ...there wasn't going to be any problem. Urine is no fun, we want blood. Please give. OK, given! Poonam had gotten along with Shankar and me. We had started going to the canteen together. Whoever is giving the replacement blood... ...his name will go in the Donor register And the blood that we give to the patient. Hey hero, pay attention Sorry. That entry will go in the Issue register. Do not touch the "Master Register"... That is my job. Welcome, welcome, your highness, welcome. No, no, the Blood Bank's Lab assistant is the real king. I am just the Commander-in-chief. What were you teaching the kids? - Nothing. Just giving them the orientation. After all, Blood Bank is a big responsibility. Right? That's true. Kids, there is only one thumb rule. Anyone who comes seeking blood... ...shold get its replacement too. Without replacement, no one gets the blood. Right, sir. - Yeah Will you come to the terrace for a minute? What is the problem! It's our anniversary. Savita is making my life hell. She is asking me to cook today. Will you handle the blood bank for tonight? ls that all. How about I handle it permanently? And then what should I do, open a confectionery? You anyways do look like a confectioner, brother! Shut up! Praise the Lord! Child, your fate is about to change. What else? But there is a problem. There is a mole on your private part. Give me all the money you have. And all your problems will be solved. Have you forgotten that day Baba! That day too you were trying to sweet-talk me by calling me a "child" I must atleast be 2 years elder to you. Hey...don't be fooled by Baba's physical appearance. Baba has meditated for years in the mountains. Baba has been young since 100 years. Don't laugh. Don't laugh. Your youth surely is clouded under a black mole's shadow. What mole are you talking about? Child. There is a black mole on your friend's private part. Tell me Baba, where else does he have moles. What! Why do you need to know? Are you going to marry me? Why should I marry any boy, who has a mole on his private part? Get lost... Get lost, baba. Learn to tame your anger, son. How about I tame you Baba! Only time will tell who will tame whom, lad! Get lost. I'll Sting you! Hello. Yes, Shankar? Blood Bank Duty? Now? Who will donate the replacement blood? You see, mister, I have got a vasectomy done. I am physically weak. My brother has just recuperated from Tuberculosis. If the wife doesn't get the blood, she'll definitely die. Look man, you have permanently severed your connections. Why do you need a wife now? Let her go. Brother, she is my wife. I see. 2 units, AB +ve. Rare group! That Will be 5000. Brother Look, either choose your wife, or the money. Brother Here Uncle, Vasectomy doesn't make you weak. The weakness is in your mind. See, eventually who benefitted from all this? Bro, you didn't take replacement blood. Vampire. Vampire? They only come out at night, to suck blood. Naresh, I'll need two dummies. I didn't understand anything that night. Without replacement, 2 units of blood was given out in exchange of money. Shankar broke his own thumb rule. Hey vampire!...why are you hanging on a tree? Were the dogs chasing you? Not dogs brother, the Police. Right there, behind you. Hello. - Hello. You dog, get down now. I know you haven't give them their commission. Hello, brother. There is barely any blood in your body, it's all smoke. What will you give... Bruce Lee? When did you last drink? It's been five days, brother. Just day before yesterday you drank with me rascal! Gradually I was understanding everything. Harnam and Mithuniya were PDs Means, Professional Donors. When was the last time you donated blood. It's been 15 days brother. Rascals, don't you say my name on your death bed! Show me both your arms. Are those needle marks? - No brother, they are mosquito bites. Do you have a pipeline of blood supply coming... ...that all the mosquitoes come and stick only to you! I'll see you both in the blood bank's storeroom. Yes, sir. Start it up. Spirit. Blood bag.. and IV kit. Understood. Hold his arm now... hold it tight. Bruce Lee has got lot of blood. Huh! Tighten it. Next, you take this. Put your head down! This is how you put it. You should learn it too. Huh! Hold this. See, brother. Shaking it like this, prevents the blood from coagulating... ...so that there is no problem while transferring it to the patient Hey Bruce Lee...think about your own problems first. Your haemoglobin count is 3... ...I am sure even the patients count is at least 6-7. Want to give blood again! Stop sighing, you won't die. stop Dumping your fist. I know you have been in this line of business since a long time! Fool! Hey compounder, why are you sitting there like an otter. Trying to increase your blood count by laughing. Go make the entry in the donor register. Yes, brother. First at least ask what entry? Yes, tell me. Enter two fake names in the donor register... ...against the two units of blood we gave tonight. And write Puspendra's name in front of the entry. And then? Then get some chickpeas for them mister! After all you have sucked their blood. Brother, get me the spicy ones. Oh, patient! Keep shaking the blood bag! Don't try to take advantage. Move the hand! They are nice... Brother, the salt is a bit less Oh Mithunuya! The sodium levels in your body are low. Now listen carefully. Don't be seen here for 3 months from now. Run away. Run! Open it. Keep it. It's Poonam's birthday tomorrow. Great. Take her out on a date. On the RX 100. Even I have been in love, lad. Have you gone crazy? You are praying to your own photograph? Shut up! You are crazy. Haven't you ever heard that there is God in every child? Bye, sweety-pie. What does this mean? Why are we suddenly going out like this? Because it's your birthday today. Happy birthday, Poonam. Thank you. And my gift? - You will get it. OK. What are you doing? Sitting. Like this. - This is how one sits. Well... | never had a lady sitting at the back like this before. "What else will I think of... other than you." "You tell me." "What else can I wish for...except for you." "You're my only wish." "You're my only wish." "My heart has fallen for you." "Your intoxication spreads with every heartbeat." "My heart has fallen for you." "Your intoxication spreads with every heartbeat." "My heart has fallen for you." "My heart..." "My heart has fallen for you." "My heart has fallen for you." "Your intoxication spreads with every heartbeat." "My heart has fallen for you." "Your intoxication spreads with every heartbeat." Why are you crying? The hostel gates must have closed up at 9pm. Where will I go now? Why didn't you tell me before? I was having so much fun, that I forgot. One minute...can I try? You know bikes? - Yes, my brother had an RX 100. He would often say something about the choke. Yes, this one. Here. How will I climb up? I will give you a push you from behind, how else? Look, don't try to act fresh. Just climb! Oh no! I am stuck. Mummy. Move your hand from there! Come on. on, God! Thank you. Good night. - Wait. I have something for you. Why didn't you give it earlier? I was having so much fun, that I forgot. I Love You! Its written with blood. Where did you cut yourself? - Forget that. Come closer. I want to say something in your ears. Shit. Mummy! "You are the beloved daughter of the King" Shankar! " | am just a monk wrapped in a loin loth.." " | crush bhang and drink, I own only a mortar and a pestle." " | crush bhang and drink, I own only a mortar and a pestle." " | crush bhang and drink, I own only a mortar and a pestle." Brother, So many nails? Ghosts and vampires live here, the iron is to ward them off.. Don't be scared. Take a seat. So, how was the birthday? - It was amazing. I proposed to her. - What? You did? - Yes. What did she say? I forgot to ask. Bro, you forgot to ask the main thing. Haw! now what? First of all, stop saying "haw!" like girls... ...and the next time you meet, ask her the answer! Come in. It's open. Hello, sir. Oh my, my, my...Delhi's Dracula. No need to take off your shoes, come in. Brother Suraj, this is Brother Rajesh, my class fellow! And Rajesh, this is Brother Suraj, aka, Dracula. Government servant, at the government hospital in Delhi. So what is the news about Delhi? Don't ask brother, huge chaos! Delhi is in panic. Dracula, sometimes get good news too! What's happened now? Brother, Monkey Man! 20 incidents in 4 days. Oh, God. Tell me what happened? Yesterday at midnight, the Monkey ivian barged into the Blood bank of All India. The peon was peeing, and Monkey Man suddenly emerged out of nowhere! He is still in the ICU. - Who? Monkey Man? The peon, brother. It was good that you couldn't lay your hands on the Monkey man, you leech! Otherwise, you would have laid him there itself, and sucked all the blood out of him! What brother! What do you mean by "what brother"? You wouldn't spare your father in the matter of blood. And there, he was The Monkey Man... Liters full of blood. Oh, forget that. How many did you get? 200! Oh my! This time Delhi's Dracula has got a big heist. ls it fresh? Consider its still in the body, it's that fresh. Take it out. You call this fresh! I swear on the blood brother, it's from last night. Why is there an overdose of B +ve! It's available everywhere. Get a rare group too sometimes brother! Oh! Just keep it brother. You will finish it in a jiffy. As if I don't sell, but drink it! What, brother? Now quickly transfer the blood to your bags. I have to go to Arora as well. Rajesh, just get the bags from that box there. Get the Cigarettes too. Now go out and have a smoke. Bro, give me your mobile as well. You can keep the mobile... ...but this time don't forget to ask Neelam for her answer Brother, its Poonam, not Neelam. Yes, her. Don't forget to ask. Go have fun. Hello. Who? It's me. Rajesh. So? I forgot to ask you that day. What? Your answer. I couldn't sleep all night. Why? You are a little crazy! Only for you. I am too, a little bit. I see, so what do you like the most about me? Your hair. Your smile. And your eyes. OK, now tell me, what do you like about me? Do you have to think that hard? According to what I have seen, I really like your neck. And your eyes too. Only? That's all. You haven't shown me the rest. Shut up. Don't forget your limits Rajesh. I am hanging up. Bye. It was like a Blood Factory running in front of my eyes! Shankar told me, that the blood which comes to us from outside... ...has to be transferred into our blood bags. So that the theft is not caught. Next, fake stickers are to be put on the blood bags, which are then sold ahead. Brother.. there must be a huge margin in this work? Yeah. Brother... I want to do this work. You got the taste of blood too! But how will you finish your diploma lad, and attendance? Just like you are doing it, without attendance. By the way, Why do you need a Diploma at this age? You already know how to do the job. I want a permanent job in the Government blood bank. For which I require a Government stamped Diploma degree But please take care of my attendance brother. It will be taken care of, don't worry. Come, let's do your ribbon cutting today itself. There is 2 units of Blood in there. Deliver it to this address. You will get 8000Rs, bring them. I guess the RX 100 has fallen in love with you? What are you waiting for? Go on. Oh! You will kill me! Hello! Your attendance was getting registered. Did you get the money? Here. Your share. Do you drink? Hello, Vikas. You have started thinking of yourself as a Chief Minister huh! Yes, come on. You said you will sing a song for me. Come over, we will find a cure for your cold Bro, You dress really well. These are the ones which are showered upon the poor as relief material. Clothes of the dead white men. One of my boys has the contract with them Brother.. Why dint you meet me before There is a right time for everything. You were a kid before this. Today you sold blood, Had liquor for the first time, And you also fell in love Lad, you became a man now. Just keep guiding me this way brother.. One day, this kid will make you proud. But I fear one thing What is that? Your love should not ruin you, that's all --- How will it? Rashi, she is a Punjabi girl My childhood love. I quit my studies for her. Why? Because I wanted to make money. And when I did make money through blood, she said "I don't want to get married now." "I want to study more, become a doctor." Go ahead. She left me with a wounded heart We meet when she wants to, otherwise, she is studying to be a doctor. Bloody, as if it's not Love, but a light bulb On-off. ..On-off. .. Bro, this is not done I regret making one mistake, though I never touched her Always loved her from a distance After all my blood group is O -ve. How does that matter? Everybody only takes from O -ve lad; no one gives back Then I realised, that this world doesn't understand love. What the. Get it. A little. A well is dug only once. then the water stays trapped in the well itself. It does not go anywhere else. The 'thirst' keeps getting quenched. Bro I have an idea, if you don't feel bad. My boy, the idea can be bad too. No, no, no You, and sister-in-law Rashi go on a picnic together. That is not a bad idea at all! Oh Vikas! You! Sir, sir Salutations to you, sir. I see, trying to use my tricks on me. Bro you are the only one like yourself! "l have earned all this money for you." "Test me all you want." "Don't give me attitude" "l can squander millions on you." "l can squander millions on you." "l can squander millions on you." "What Radha saw in Shyam." "What Sita saw in Ram." "You won't find anyone like me in this village..." "...when l'll walk clown that aisle." "l can squander millions on you." "l can squander millions on you." "l can squander millions on you." That night never came again. Shankar, with his quivering hands finally called up Rashi. Wow...everything is so beautiful. Beautiful. And the smell. Even I don't have a perfume like this. ls it new? Weren't you going to keep me here after our marriage? It must be quite expensive. ls this why you were saving up? You must be feeling very nice. Stop making fun out of me! Will you have some tea? - Tea my foot! You are a human being, not some animal. So stop living like animals, Shankar! What a mess Let it be, I'll do it. "Says my stupid heart." "Holding her hands silky-silky." "Says my stupid heart." "Holding her hands silky-silky." "The wise have said, thoughtfully that..." "fruit tastes sweet only after it's ripe." "Let love simmer on a low flame..." "..if you over cook it, it will be ruined." "Open the knot in your mind." "Speak whatever is in your heart." "Let two hearts converge into one." "These are not the days to be wasted.." "Put a thoughtful foot forward" "Let your paths be one." "Says my stupid heart." "Holding her hands silky-silky." "Says my stupid heart." "Holding her hands silky-silky." "Sugar lumps are sweetest of all." "But love is sweeter. "Sugar lumps are sweetest of all." "But love is sweeter than that "Use your eyes. "...to feel this sweet sight of union." "Store it forever." "Says my stupid heart." "Holding her hands silky-silky." "Says my stupid heart." "Holding her hands silky-silky." Prahlad. The jalebis are over. Bring some lmartis. Latoo, serve some lmartis to them. How about a cigarette? But I won't go to get it. You are getting smarter by the day. Make an FD out of it; it will come handy for your marriage. Prahlad, where is Shankar? Ask him. This seat is occupied. We'll get up when he comes. So...you are Shankar's new admission, huh! Were you the one who delivered the blood to Arora? Why? - That is our area. Blood has no area. The one who supplies the blood, it's his area. I see. The one whose area it is, is the only one who supplies the blood kid! Good afternoon. How does it feel? That was just a touch. Now watch this shot! I won't get it. Huh? Here. Say sorry to Rajesh sir. Sorry. Say it with some respect, Vishnu. Sorry, Rajesh sir. Sorry. Now make a clear note of what Sir said. The one who supplies the blood... ...it is his area. Prahlad, where are your Imartis. Coming. Coming. The Imartis are coming Sir. I am Shankar, you are Vishnu. How about a partnership? I swear I will turn you into men. Get up. Bro, when you were thrashing them, It felt as if Lord Shiva's third eye has opened in anger. I never get angry. I even beat people with love. Get that? Mithunia! Go see what is wrong? Sir, Mithunia was my friend. He had parked his rickshaw, and was having a smoke sir then suddenly he fell down with a thud and died No one just falls down with a thud and dies. Something is definitely wrong. Tell me what, or else I will arrest you too. I'm telling you the truth sir... He was having a smoke sir... ...then suddenly he fell down with a thud and died. Swaraj, take him in. He won't open his mouth easily. It's not my fault. - Come on. Sir, No, I haven't done anything. Please let me go. - Wait, wait Didn't I ask you to speak up... ...now I'll turn you into a "Bat-man". Take the body. No, sir no I haven't done anything wrong. Let me go. I have small kids. Let me go. I haven't done anything. Brother, Mithunia is dead. How? Harnam said he fell down with a thud and died. I haven't done anything, sir. Let me go. Mithunia must have again given blood without a break I think someone has put a jinx on us! Come on lad, now let's get underground! Underground? Shankar, back then joined hands with you because I was scared of you. But now, I want to be your friend from the bottom of my heart. Now you sound like a friend. Brother, me too. Prakash, you are from my village buddy You better give me a hug! Brother, we are related now. - Blood brothers! Let's go, Prakash. See you. Praise the Lord. Atleast you should have told me... ...that you bleed Mithunia as well. I had to pay my son's fees. I double-bled him. How much load could he take... At last his body gave up! Brother, you became too greedy! He was a human being, not a buffalo after all! I asked him, "When was the last time you gave blood?" he said "15 days ago." I asked him again, when I saw needle marks on his arms. He said "they are mosquito bites". Then his death was certain! Forget Mithunia. There is a blood donation camp day after tomorrow at Jeend And after Mithunia's incident, SP Gajraj Singh has been patrolling the hospital area thoroughly I myself haven't gone to work since five days. So tell me, are we going to heist the camp? What if we get caught? My boy, there is a rule in this business. Don't talk until you actually get caught. Volunteers will be the Diploma students? - Yeah. Five students and four lab technicians. Fine then, homage to Mithunia. Let's do it. Bro, how many units will we get from the camp? At least 25,000 units. Blood banks from all over Haryana will pour in for the blood. We will have to appoint Poonam on the counting job. Otherwise, we'll have no chance Listen Tomorrow is the first trial of your love. What do I have to do brother? You will be earning 1,00,000 rupees. Do I still need to tell you what you have to do? You handle Sabarval. - Don't worry about the doctor. He is under heavy debt. He won't go anywhere. Madam, this is the discarded one. - Put it in there. Poonam, these are the B +ves. Where have you been these days? You don't even attend class. Don't you want to finish your Diploma? You are there, doing my share as well. Please, help me now. You have been working for so long. Take a break. And who will see the entry? Shankar. Can you fill in brother? Yes, of course. You go. I missed you a lot in the past few days. Liar - No, really Then how come you are meeting me after so long, since the birthday? I was held up with something important. You say, did you miss me? Look, Rajesh. I likes you. But I want to study ahead. Getting caught up in such things will be detrimental for studies. This world doesn't understand love. I was thinking the same thing. Afterall, we are too young to fall in love I don't want to hurt you. Try to understand, please. Where, did you learn English from? Rapidex. Friends! No. Either we are girlfriend-boyfriend, or nothing. This is not right. Why aren't you understanding? - I am understanding everything! Don't you get those feelings? Which feelings? Like these. - Leave my hand. Move or I'll scream. - Go ahead. I will really scream. Sorry. Did that hurt? Are you crazy? ls the box full? What were you saying? ls the box full? Get another box... Prakash, have you got more boxes for the discarded blood? Check these. How many units? I haven't counted them, but there are approximately 250. 5O of those are mine, brother - Quiet! Then Sabarvais share is your responsibility. Fine, you handle Vishnu then. Brother, before the love surge cools down outside, we have to collect 70-80 units more. Here you go, discard. Here, is this the discarded one. Put it in the box. Shit! You're bleeding. What are you two up to? What filthy business is going on here! Get out you shameless girl! Get lost from here Shameless. A blood donation camp is in process here, not a blue film! Sorry, sir. - Don't be seen here again. See what I had to hear. Don't try to get fresh with me again. Was I doing it alone? - You provoked me. You will leave me once you have had your fun. Leave you? Are you crazy, Poonam? Be honest. Honestly... I swear, I love you. We must tell papa. But you don't earn a dime. How will we get married? Marriage? Why? Won't you marry me? Let's do it now. You are one crazy man! Only for you. Where were you? Weren't you posted here? Sorry sir. - Come and sit here. "Sorry sir." Look at your entry. We have got 350 units. - 350! I had Prakash take them home. What's this? Poonam bit me. You two are getting pretty wild, huh! Mr.Sabarval, there is definitely some scam going on in the blood bank. Scam? What scam? Did you receive any complaint? Well, the complaint died 10 clays ago. Mithunia. According to the post-modem report... There was almost no blood in the body. Only needle marks. As if everybody just sucked. ..all the blood out of him, like the juice from a sugarcane stick. Who are they? These are the diploma students. There was a blood donation camp in Jeend. That is where they are returning from. You have quite elderly students here. Sir... there is no right age to educate oneself. But there is one to speak son! Doctor, I have already posted four constables at the hospital gate. The CID is also patrolling the place in civilian clothes... ...and I am sure, so is Mithunia's ghost. If anybody is caught... ...then I swear on the constitution of India... ... | will turn him into a bat. Bat? Batman By hanging him upside down on a rod in the jail. Okay, sir. Sir... I will personally tell you if I find anything out. What is your name? - Rajesh Dhiman. He is a good boy sir.. I will find that out myself. Sorry... You were trying to act too brave in front of that SP. Someone had to brother, or else he would have grown suspicious. Boy.. now you have spoken like a true smuggler Brother... My 1,00,000 Rs. They are lying right in front of you.. First at least, let them get sold my boy! Brother, I am tensed! Poonam is talking about marriage. She is going to tell her family. If I don't earn some money soon... Lad, I told you before... Love her... like an adult. Then, whether you make money or not, she won't go anywhere... Guaranteed. Your parents won't come back home right? I told you, they are visiting my grandpa. They will come only after two days. OK. Would you like a beer or vodka? I don't know. Fine. Enjoy both. It tastes so bitter. That's okay. Gradually... it will get sweeter. Why are you showing me this? You like English, don't you? This is a very popular English film. It's so vulgar. - So what? Have a look ...it's so nice. Come on, let's lie down. - No. Come on, I'll help you lie. - No, Rajesh. I love you. Not like this, Rajesh. No. . .just a little. Rajesh, slowly. Slowly, please. Mummy! I can never forget you now. I love you Rajesh. "Love her.. like an adult" Yes, Shankar. - Boy.. you can get married now! The first case of dengue has arrived. It's the start of our season! How? How? There is only one thing in demand in dengue. Blood! And that too, in tons Brother, I have heard that dengue is pretty dangerous. It's a farm son! That God has sown, for us to harvest Come, let's start with the harvest! Just like Shankar said... ...Dengue came like Diwali for us. Due to this disease, the platelet count in the blood reduces considerably. And then the patient is in the need of fresh blood. Not one...not two... ...but we started getting demands for around 10 units a day. And that too, from various places. There was no date on the blood bags... ...that we stole from the blood donation camp. We started putting in dates... ...of the days on which the demands would come in. This made the blood fresh again. Shankar and I had distributed the areas. We were giving a cut to every lab technician of the hospital which is why the demands were coming only to us. I had 10-15 hospitals were under my responsibility. And Shankar had around 30. We didn't have the fear of SP Gajraj Singh... As the vvhole game was being played out of Karnal When the demand started coming in for the platelets instead of blood ...our margin increased four times. I really thought that... ...God had sent dengue to fulfil our needs. Even the police were readily at service. Like it always is during any crises. The only difference was that... ...this time they were getting an apt reward in exchange of their service. In form of 500 rupees a Parle-G biscuit pack. Until the dengue season was over... ...Shankar had made around 1.5 to 2 million rupees. I only got 4 lakh as my share. I don't know why, but I thought it was too less... ...compared to my hard work. I could never say it to Shankar... ...nor did he ever understand. Ha! So much. This is just the beginning. You can tell your family now. I don't want to. You go marry your Shankar! Why? I don't like it. You are always spending time with him. I spend time with him... But I get dreams only of you What dreams? Of that day... when we were at my home... Naughty donkey- Mummy- Papa are going out again...for two days. I don't care... We won't do it before our marriage now. Why? Because It's dirty. But that's how love is There is verbal love also. - Come on, Poonam. First learn it properly... ...then speak in English. Will you tutor me...at my home? You want everything at your home. Who is calling? Shankar. See, the Teacher calls again! Why don't you ask him to tutor you... at your home! Want one? You too have deserted me! You don't answer my calls too. - What's wrong brother? Oh Dracula! Want to die, eating so much? Take him out for a walk. Come on...stop eating. Come on. Go on. Come on. Come on, let's go out. You want to eat the utensils too! Brother... what's wrong? She's gone. Who? Rashi. Today we had a final break-up How? Through a text message. What did she write? "My parents will never be happy with you." "And I can't see them sad." "Hope you understand." What will you do now brother? - Understand. She's a girl... ...will do whatever she says. Come here. A prophet used to visit my village. He used to say "whatever you do for love, it is never enough" I now understand what he meant. A job has come. I can't. Will you do it? How much is it for? I see, so now you have started asking this too. 5 units. Ah, God! Okay, brother. Close the door. Hello. Ms.Rashi. I have reached Rohtak. He loves you a lot. I do too. Then what is the problem? Look, Rajesh. No matter how modern we become... But in India, marriage is a union of two families... ...and not just two individuals. You know that right. So run away with him. Would you have said the same thing to your sister? Sorry. Just meet him once, please. Uncle, one double-filter. Here. Get down Blood Express...Shankar is waiting for you. - Come on. How did you get that bruise? I took 8 blood bags from Safdarjung and was about to leave Just then, the crowd caught hold of me They thrashed the hell out of me, brother! Dracula, you are going through a bad time bro! Get on. Run. It's the police. Run! Stop. Stop Sant Lal. Gajraj made a batman out of Dracula on the road itself. Oh no... Shankar. Say something. Don't go. Please don't make me cry. You are the one who is breaking up, and you only are crying. Leave something for me too. How about some tea? We are breaking up and all you can think of is tea. Because even after you leave me, my tea won't. No one can win an argument with you. I will miss you...always! Let it be. After you leave from this room... ...your 'Always' will fade away gradually Have you sworn to hurt me today? That your parents have. It's not their fault, Shankar. You say, why would anyone willingly. marry their daughter to a blood thief? Then why have you come to meet this blood thief? Your friend begged me to come here. Rajesh! I had come to meet him. Thank you Are you my mom or my dad? when I dint shed a single tear in front of her, why did you! I was only trying to do it for good! Dracula was arrested...on the highway! Hello sir, I am fine. Sir, one of my men was arrested. His name is Suraj. He is also called Dracula. Fine. Thank...thank you very much Sir. Good...goodbye. Did you do the job? Money. 25,000. Keep this. Bro... only this much? Since when did you start counting? But I did the entire job myself. I gave you.. what I always used to. Stop nagging me. Get going. We are equal partners on this job. If you had asked politely, I would have given you all of it. This is what you get for holding my collar. Partners my foot! And if that isn't enough, you can keep this too. Stop. Stop- You are that boy... who works at the blood bank right? I don't work there... I am a diploma student. Student with a 30,000RS RXG? Great style kid! Live like a good citizen, it's a Policeman's advice I hail from Rohtak too. I worked hard... And now I am an IPS officer. You also can do something productive with your life Let's go. Hello. Yes, lrfan. Why will I know where Shankar is! Just tell me the job. AB -ve. Two units. Give me two hours. You will get it. "l have earned all this money for you" "Girl, try me out" "l earned all that money for you." "Try me out girl" "Don't give me attitude" "l can squander millions on you." "l can squander millions on you." "l can squander millions on you." "What Radha saw in Shyam." "What Sita saw in Ram." "You won't find anyone like me in the whole village..." "...when l'll walk clown that aisle." "l can squander millions on you." "l can squander millions on you." "l can squander millions on you." Baba is this new look. It's Friday. I can see omen on you. Let me neutralise it. Please go away. Hey kid, better be careful. Get lost! AB -ve is a very rare group. Tell Shankar. Where is he? Stop talking about Shankar. I have brought this demand by myself Oh... So there is a new company in the market now Please don't forget about me. That is the reason I am sitting here with my first personal demand. If we fulfil Arora's demand now.. We will have to dig wells of blood in future. and it will still get difficult to fulfil the number demands. What do you ask for, boy? You are back again you cheat. - Hey, better be careful. Don't say that Rajesh. He is a young Baba (godlyman) afterall He might just curse you. At this we don't need any curse.. we need the Blood! At least tell me my blood group Palaram. AB -ve. Now just leave Babel. Sir... check Baba's blood group. Quickly. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Lower your legs. Shut up! Quiet. We got your AB -ve.. Baba is God sent for us today! Open. Wider Baba, will you give? Blood. No, I won't. You will get 200 rupees. Take it son, it's your blood. Then why did you create such a fuss at the beginning! You also cou | d've said that I will get 200 rupees. Let's go, Baba. To the donor room. No Rajesh. Not here. - Then? Come on. Pushpendra, what place have you got me to? You want your money, don't you? Come on, lie on the grave. Lie here. I'll go keep a watch. You bleed him. Quiet, Baba. How much will you cry! Fear God, son. You are my God today Baba. Brother. We need another unit. Rajesh...Mithunia's case has still not cooled down. And moreover Baba is underage He'll surely die. This one has meditated in the mountains. He has been young since 100 years. Nothing will go wrong! See...it will be your responsibility. - Fine. Listen... ...but we haven't run the tests on him. You go get your piles tested Pushpendra. Baba is fit and healthy. You... What are you doing? - Move aside. What are you doing? - I said move aside. I Will kill him. Put it down! Put it down. Yes, I have piles! So will he make a public announcement of it! OK. Hold on. How does he know? I too took his medicinal ashes once! I wonder what more this sickness will make me do. Give your bleed and get lost. Baba...the second bag will fill up soon. That's 400 rupees for two bags. - Shut up. Sip your Frooti. Along with the 400 Rs, you will get some strength too. This is what my great India is.. Here the man donates blood as he is lies on a grave. Rajesh. Piles, piles.. What is he saying? Oh Baba, oh Baba! Baba... Get up, Baba. Oh no... He too fell down with a Thud! Baba! Baba! Baba! Get up. Baba! O Lord.. - Quiet. Give him some more Frooti. I think his sugar levels have dropped. I had decided... If he hadn't opened his eyes... ...I would've buried him here itself with the Britishers. Take your time and drink. You guys have done a great job. Balvinder Singh urgently needed blood. You keep sending the demands... ...and we will keep making the supplies. By the way, where is Shankar? I don't know.. Money? Poonam told her family about us. And soon, the engagement day arrived. I can never forget Balvvinder Singh's name. My first independent demand. Mithunia's case had gone cold too... ...and the CID was called off from the hospital. The world was returning to normalcy again. Everything was going well. So I thought I should take mom and dad.. ...on a trip to Haridwar. They had toiled hard to raise me. And now it was my turn. Mom and dad never asked where I got the money from. Nor did I ever tell them. Poor parents never ask the source from where the money is coming. Thinking that it might upset goddess Laxmi, the keeper of possessions. I was thinking that by taking my parents to a pilgrimage... I had reserved a place in heaven for myself. But life was yet to unfold... "Here comes the postman with the message." "My beloved does not like the distant land." "My heart is..." Shani. Shani! What happened here? Its Baba's blessings, son. But I am off to take a dump now. Hold on. Where are Pushpendra, Harnam and others. I can't reach anyone's phones My antennas are saying...all of them are hiding in their homes. Pushpendra too. Give Baba 10 rupees and you will find them all. Keep it. Savita, check whether it's the police. Take a look. Who is it? Tell me. - Shut up. Who are you? - Rajesh. It's Rajesh! - Send him back. CID is keeping a watch. Send him back. Send him away. What happened brother? Why did you come here? But brother. It's all over! Nothing's left now. Tell me what happened? Just like a new born gets a tonsure. Consider, it's my rebirth too. What? Remember Balwinder? AB -ve. Yes, my first independent demand. And that...underage godly man! Yes, I just met him outside Arora. You haven't got him along right! - No. On the contrary, I gave 10 rupees and shooed him away. Oh! you should have touched his feet too. What nonsense are you talking brother? I was telling you that day in the graveyard. Let's run tests on Baba's blood. Let's run tests on Baba's blood. He is not a Baba (godly man)... He is a walking-talking HIV shop! Then? - Then what? Balwinder got Baba's blood. And Balwinder got HIV. When the doctors informed him... ...he hung himself from the ceiling fan of his own ward. His family got furious. They destroyed the whole Arora Nursing Home. Police took Irfan in custody. He asked for 10,000 Rs to not spill my name... ...and 50 for yours. I could only give 10 brother. My niece was getting married. He gave your name to Gajraj. I tried calling you. Where were you? Haridwar. Taking a holy dip in the Gangas? But you left your biggest sin here in Karnal itself. Look at me. I had ten years before my retirement. I even quit my government job. Run if you can. There is a warrant issued in your name. Gajraj is looking for you like a hunting dog. Got it? Be careful. You are arrogant! You will see a downfall one day. You are destined to be ruined by me. Only time will tell who will tame whom! It's off, it's off.. Look where you are hitting. Don't tear the skin, even if the bone slips its place. Hello. Enough! Stop! Look Rajesh, Harnam and Irfan have already admitted... ...that you are the chief of this blood racket. But I know...you are not capable of it. You are a decent man. Look at your Father. No, uncle, don't cry. Don't cry for such a son. Look brother, Rajesh. I know...and so do you... ...that the chief is someone else. If it was only for the records... Then your name was enough to close the investigation. But I want to finish this blood racket from its foundation. See for yourself... you have two days. Think hard and clear, and tell me the name of your boss. Then I will let you go. Just tell right now! No, uncle. Let him think through. He has two days time. Here. Take him home for now. Swear on me... and say that you are not the one behind this scandal. I swear I am not. Shankar got me involoved into this scandal. Then what are you thinking about. Go and give Shankar's name to Gajraj. - No. He is my friend. Shankar is no one's friend. I always found him to be shady! The dog like laughter of his... ...and being naive, you got influenced by him What do I do now? Oh, my king of innocence, put a "the end" to Shankar! What if he gets me trapped instead. He has got high connections. You will be fine.. hasn't Gajraj told you so.. Now will you tell the SP or should l? - No, l'll go. On the way to make me proud? Harnam said you have made a deal with the SP. What option did I have brother? Don't think so much. Lad, if I make one phone call... Even Gajraj's senior won't be able to save you. Brother... please don't do that. I am soon to get married. "What Radha saw in Shyam.." "What Sita saw in Ram" "You will not find anybody like me in this village" "When I walk down the aisle." Let's go for a ride. Where? Your first ride is still pending, Let's finish that. Come on. My bike is a tad smaller than yours. She doesn't say a word.. But, she misses you a lot. Come on. "You will not find anybody like me in this village" I made one mistake brother. I let Pushpendra talk me into it. Lad...all jobs, good or bad... ...should be done with honesty. Meaning? Why did Harnam take your name, and not mine? You must have paid him. Harnam was a tested PD. Professional Donor. Every three weeks. .. ...I would personally get all of Naresh's donors tested. You learnt how to hold the collar... ...but not this trade secret. Brother...are you not my friend Save me, brother. I messed up everything in order to marry Poonam. Save me, Shankar. You have many high connections. l'll leave Karnal, l'll leave Poonam, l'll leave everything. I swear. Lad, my name is Shankar... ...but I am not God. Would you like to eat? It's a family wedding. My hunger has died brother. Then let's go. "O Lord... | set out to surrender myself to You." "l set out carrying all my pain on my shoulder." "Here I go...come with me." " | am standing...on your path." "O Lord...I set out to surrender myself to You." "I am dragging myself back to you." "Here I go...come with me." "Seeking for your | ove." "Take me...in Your arms." "Either You show Yourself." "Or You destroy me." "Or just abandon me" "Either You punish me." "Or reward me" "Or pardon me... O Lord." "You set out towards Me lost in my | ove." "Why do you forget... that I know it all!" "Your life...belongs to me." "Your soul too belongs to me." "You began from me... and you will end in me." "You originated from me." "Ask your benefactor... and your prophets..." ...for My refuge." " | can either make you...or destroy you." "Let me shower my love on you." " | can either set you ab | aze...or douse you." "Come, let me kill you." "I am God!" You keep it. You will need it tonight. Thanks. If you go to Gajraj now... ... | will get you in trouble for a long haul! Then, you will have no one to call for help, not you... ...nor your family.. Then what do I do brother? Pay for it. My marriage? Poonam? It's time for the nuptial rounds. The place where I took you today... ...was the venue for Rash's wedding. Did you give his name to Gajraj? I couldn't meet him today. I will go back tomorrow. Rajesh, someone is at the door. No one listens! I will only have to get up. Coming. Coming. Rajesh, someone is here to see you. Brother! What happened? Vishnu, lrfan, Harnam, Suraj you, me... We are all safe. Completely clean. How? Shankar saved us all. Look. He surrendered to Gajraj last night. With one condition... ...that no one will lay a finger on you. And it also states that... ...Shankar has admitted to giving blood to Balwinder Singh. Without testing it. I couldn't stop my tears after reading this. The entire fault was ours. We have become such rascals. But why? He said...if I don't surrender... ...you will all be arrested, and I will get helpless. So it's rather better that one man gets arrested. Here...he has left this for you. Take a look. "Lad, if I wasn't a lover myself... then you would've been the one in jail." No more thrashing. Just give them a warning and let them go. I will surrender in two days. You did me a big favour by calling Rashi that day. It was my fault. But I am repaying that debt now. Leave this job...Leave Karnal. But don't ever leave Poonam. It is very hurtful. Last night was good enough to open your eyes. Now you stay out and repent for your sins... ...and I will have some fun and return What have I done! Hovv will I face Shankar now? You are right. Calm down. Everything will be fine. Congratulations, Mr.Dhiman. ls it a boy or a girl? Boy. Great! You have made your mark brother! ls this your house? What do you do? I have setup a small ice-cream factory. I was the one who went to jail, and you are the one who got reformed. I am truely jealous of you today. You didn't come visit me in jail. I was repenting for my sins out here brother! If I had come to see you... .. then you would have pardoned me of this repentance too. I can't even say sorry, brother. But you can make me meet your son. Wow.... Oh... Give him to me. What a cute kid. What's his name? Shankar Dhiman. You have named him after me... ...but I hope he doesn't get my qualities. That is the reason we have named him after you. Let that be! Here. Thank you, Shankar. Mention not. Even I learnt English from Rapidex in the jail! By God. How about a hug? Shankar. Give me some salvation brother. Balwinder's son wants to become a doctor. I gave him all I had. You too give him whatever you can. OK. That's more like it. You left doing the job? I quit tea... cigarette too. But this red colour doesn't leave me. I have started an NGO with Harnam. Now I give it for free...b | ood. You must donate too. But...on | y once in three months. Otherwise... you will also fall down with a Thud... ...and visit my dreams to suck my blood! "This red tinge.. Seeped it from my pains." "And filled my wounds with it." "This red tinge... snatched it from strangers." "And colored my own people with it." "This red colour...is colouring generations." "It is living in the blood stream." "It beats and brightens intensely in every vein" "Gets restless, makes waves and can't be controlled." "This red colour... ruined me."
