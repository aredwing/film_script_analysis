What is going to happen to me? l was full of fright and despair. l could not think straight. But faintly... l remember thinking "l am going to die''. lt's great that the ''yokozuna'' won despite all of the bashing. He's a hero in Mongolia. Winning isn't everything. What's wrong with a winner? You like winners, don't you? Like our President... By the way, where is he? Not here yet... Good morning, sir. Yes, l'm on my way. Oh, Ms. Kameda. Hello, manager. lt seems he's not well. l'll take this. Everyone has a bad day. But he's like a skyscraper that stands even if a plane crashes into it. That kind of skyscraper doesn't exist. Excuse me, sir. A problem with the merger? l couldn't sleep, so l was just emailing l was told many rumors, about other companies... people related to the China merger. interested in the China merger. lt can't be... We finally got the approval from the board of directors. These type of rumors pop up around this time. lt was so boring to hear, so l was finally able to yawn. l will do some research on this. You should get some sleep, sir. A bit too daring, don't you think? l'm surprised myself. Should we not do it? President's office. Many matters are pending so Please don't disturb him. Let's discuss that later. No...over there. Oh, l'm gonna come. Come here. You are the best partner. Not a thing to say to a woman you haven't slept with in over a year. lf the Beijing deal comes through, we can travel together again. l will keep that dream locked away. Hope l can unlock the dream someday. l guess l was too daring. My daughter is missing since yesterday. She hasn't returned from prep class. Call the police. l don't want the police near during such sensitive times. Am l a bad parent? l feel sorry for your daughter. l have a feeling she'll come home tonight. As if nothing had happened. l need some sleep. Help, someone! Excuse me, sir. Mr. Takanashi is here. l heard a bad rumor. This is bad. Really bad. l heard that other companies are interested in the Beijing merger. Many are opposed to begin with. And if Beijing is given other choices... The Chinese are so greedy. We will be at a disadvantage. lt's time to reconsider this deal. lt's most definitely a false rumor. And the merger guarantees your family to remain in the same position. lncluding your very bright nephew. You can't tell if l'm bright, since you don't give me the chance. Have you forgotten that big mistake you made in the Malaysia office? l'm bad under hot weather. You're no good anywhere in the world. Hey, there's three more days until the board meeting. Can't you reconsider? You are the one who made this company big. l want to respect your decision. But we have love for this company... You are afraid of losing your current powers. The domestic market has no room for gromh. lf we don't build the path to China now... The major companies will crush us. You need to study the market more. l hope you are not driven to resignation at the board meeting. No good is born when you are nervous. l should learn from my mistakes. You are wonderful when you're angry. You should do this more often. l want to continue where we left off this morning. Make more noise! Let those fools hear you! Sorry to come before you. Too much excitement brings no good. This morning was more than enough for me. l hope so... You're so mean. You found out now? Water...please. l can't drink something filthy like that! Some people drink it everyday...Piss. You want to drink mine? You are crazy. l think it's a wonderful idea. No...Stop it! Don't look...please... Pervert! How can you enjoy this? lf your father is dying in the desert, he would drink his piss, right? This is not the desert! My father? He would never pay money for me. Then you are no use to me. "The number you have reached is unavailable.'' "The number you have reached is unavailable.'' "lt may be outside the senrice area or turned off.'' Kimika? Are you ok? Hello? Listen to me. l've been a bad father. You must have frustrations. l have no right to be angry with you. Just come home. We can talk about this. Such convincing words. It's a quality needed in a President. Please stop. Will you excuse yourself? Sorry about that. And who might you be? So wonderful. Negotiations are unsuccessful when you lose your coolness. ln any case, l'm not answering your question. l see... lf you want ransom, show proof of the kidnapping. Here are my terms. Stop the ongoing merger plans with the Chinese corporation. Or l kill your daughter. Are you happy, l'm not asking for ransom? What do you mean? Your daughter was saying... you would not pay money for her. You're lying. There is a reason for a lie. What's the problem with you two? How can you guarantee her safety? No guarantee. You have to believe me. Can't accept your terms, then. l'm a Christian. So this is not a negotiation, but a hardship for you. lt is a hardship given from God, and you must overcome it. You must decide, to be or not to be. l want to take on the hardship myself. Why don't l trade places with my daughter? A wonderful idea, but l can't accept that. We've met before, haven't we? l feel we are closely related. Announce the annulment of the merger during the board meeting. Or l kill your daughter. No! Ow! lt hurts... You were right. He was having second thoughts about paying the ransom. No, please, no! No! Your father can't love anyone. Right? Go away! Please go! To have a child, and lose the wife at the same time is quite devastating. There was no guarantee of the mother surviving the childbirth. But she insisted on having the baby. Unbearable. lf you had to, which would you choose? The child or the wife? l don't need either of them now. Mother died for me. That's why you hate me! l knew it. l've felt it all along. You despise me! President, you have arrived home. Pardon me, sir! Kameda is absent due to wedding rehearsals. The manager is busy with researching, so l am here. Here you go. When is Kameda getting married? Do you want to attend? lf l am up for it. Why don't you have some too? Thank you, sir. lt's tough to have a teenaged daughter, right? Yes, how did you know that? l know a lot of things. Like, you might not be able to sit in that chair for that long. l see. lt's not the right timing for a merger. ls that all your uncle has to say? l'm making my own decision. Nothing to do with uncle. So it's just one kidnapper... No, you can't be that bold. Watch your mouth. You'll regret it! You don't have the balls! Excuse me, sir. There is no certainty about the rumor. Maybe it's a foreign company... No, the traitor is in the company. Spreading rumors, kidnapping my daughter. The kidnapper called last night. What were the demands? Kidnapping is a serious crime. lsn't it going a bit too far? They know the police can't be involved in it. l might do it if that's the case. Don't worry. She's ok. But... l told you she is safe. You are ok with her getting killed. l am Kimika's father. Yes, you are. But you can only love a dead person living inside your shell. Excuse me, sir. Do it to me. What? No! Don't! No! Don't! Take me back to that room. Please... Please... No... Don't kill me... Please. Ow! Ouch! Ow! No! Don't! No! No! No! No! You're too fat. Too much in costume. Show me your face. l'm sorry. l won't say it again! l don't mind dying. l want to die. l knew it. ''l don't mind dying.'' ''l want to die.'' How amful! So amful! l want to hear your voice. What a wonderful sound. Maintenance is not my specialty, but l can relax with this. And sometimes l come up with new ideas. l think the human mind becomes more versatile with body movement. Can l try? Does it hurt? Make it hurt more. lt was wonderful. There is no future with me. That's not my intention. Thank you. Feel guilt towards your wife? Please don't worry, l'm not interested in that. l have no wife. And l will never marry again. That was the beginning of hell. lt was painful. There is hope in being jealous of a living person. But l was jealous of your mother. Who was eternally living inside your father. She remains beautiful forever. Remains inside him in the form when she was most loved. lt's so difficult to hide myjealousy... This is the most recent attempt. People would be surprised to see. The executive secretary in this state... l had great experiences with him too. We traveled to many countries together. We saw sumo in front row seats. l see... Ow! Tell me your name. Shigemi Ichinose. Shigemi Ichinose. My first ''man.'' l like you. You can't meet your father like this. l'll bring some change. Don't want to see him. l'll be right back. Wait! l was thinking about a different thing. And realized something. You say ''wonderful'' often, don't you? You used it several times during the ransom call. Kimika is safe! Ms. Ichinose, are you really a Christian? ''Ms. Ichinose'' ''Hey, you.'' You have never called me by my first name. lf you had once called me by my first name. l would not have done this. l got your name wrong the first time. You said, ''Shigemi, not Narumi.'' People remember strange things. You can live even if you forget. But many are hard to forget. lt starts to fill up with things that are hard to forget. l had sex with Kimika. l put on a penis band that l bought at a sex shop. She was a virgin. She was crying. You are crying too. What do you mean by ''shell?'' You don't understand? You have a hard shell in your heart. lnside that shell your wife lives on'. You cannot love another and you won't try to love. You can only love your dead wife. Living inside your shell. After l killed my wife... l could not love anyone anymore. lncluding my wife. l really wanted a son. l practically threatened her to have the baby. And l practically killed her. Though people thought the complete opposite. l didn't deny it. ln any case, my wife died. And an unwanted daughter was born. How can such an irony occur? God does not exist ever since then. Love does not exist. What's stuffed in my shell is not the love for my wife. lt is my guilt! l was worried. You left me behind. What's wrong? Where's Dad? l don't know? Let's stay together forever. l will do you. You suck. Stop, stop it! No! Don't! No! He'll die! Your father died too. He jumped... And splattered all over. Two weeks later Restricted Area Excuse me. Everyone has left. l would like to leave too... l will tell the guards then. lt was a tiring day for you. Please cheer up. What happened with the merger? Dunno... lchinose manager and Mr. Takanashi, both are missing. l was wondering who will take her place. l think l am well qualified. What is going to happen to us? So full of happiness and ecstasy, couldn't think straight. But l faintly remember. While we were here. We could escape from that shell of death, we all have inside. Even just for a brief moment... lt felt that way to me...
