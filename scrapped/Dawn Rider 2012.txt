 

                        Ah! Careful. I did not tell you to use your weapons. I was to get a $500 bonus for bringing him in alive. And now you've killed him. The bed. Look under there. He blew the tunnel. It's blocked with rocks. Son of a bitch! We have no idea which way he's headed. Well, the man can't run forever. We'll go west. I wouldn't do that if I were you. What the fuck is this? What? You got some kind of problem with the mail service? This is the third goddamn time. We lost two men and there's no fucking money! Three kings. BEN: Hmm. Handle first. And the other one. Nice and slow. Gentlemen! Shall we bring this to the magistrate? Absolutely. No way! The cattleman is cheating. I have three aces! I'm sure you do. If I were cheating, wouldn't I win? Well, you can't always cheat luck. If you look under the table, you'll find two cards on the floor. You better run. No, I think I'll just shoot. JOHN: You shoot, they'll lock you up. They'll call the marshal. It might take a week. Well, that's a fuckin' ordeal. Yeah. That is a fuckin' ordeal. CATTLE JACK: If I'm not mistaken, that gentleman fixin' to end our days? That's Cincinnati John Mason. I ain't never been to Cincinnati. I don't think I have to tell you boys. You both are gonna wanna leave town. Three fuckin' aces. That's far enough. Hey, it's Mr. Three Aces! Hey. Hey. You're more than welcome to join me. Thank you. I, uh... BEN: And they just attacked you with no provoking? It was time to get up anyway. Well, still. So where you headed? East. Everything is east of here. Promise. Promise, Wyoming? You've been there? I been there. My name is McClure. Ben McClure. John Mason. Cincinnati John Mason? I ain't never been to Cincinnati. I work for the Express in Promise with a fellow by the name of Dad Mason. Is he any relation? Some. Holy shit. Dad Mason's son is Cincinnati John Mason. I'm gonna show you something here. Well, that's nice. Yeah, that's, uh... Well, that's real nice. That's for my girl. Well, you know, hopefully. Yeah? Yeah. It ain't a proper engagement ring or nothin', but it's all I can afford. You know, that cost me over a month's pay. Mmm. It's got a half-moon on it 'cause that's on account of her middle name is Luna. Mmm. So you going to Promise to visit your father? I wasn't planning on it, no. Well, I'm sure he'd be happy to see you. You think so? I'd wager. I would take that bet. Well, a man's got to be happy to see his own son. Yeah. DAD MASON: I told you I'd shoot you on sight. You're lookin' right at me. Yeah. Well, my eyes ain't what they used to be. Oh! I hate it when you talk Mexican! Spanish. Whatever. Supper's at 6:00. Bring some whiskey. I'll be right back. Whoa! Hey, you all finished with birthdays? John Mason? Alice Gordon? You're all, uh... You're all done growin'. Yeah, well, you too. So, what brings you back? Is it true that you shot that Pinkerton Agent, Big Earl Smith? How long are you stayin'? Do you need a place? 'Cause you can stay with me and Rudd. I've got... I made some delicious stew on the stove. It's delicious. I, really... I put... I'm not sure which question to answer first. John Mason! $300! No questions asked! Okay, okay. What I wanna know... Is it true you shot those horse thieves before they even had a chance to draw? I told you. I ain't never been to Cincinnati. I warned you! I don't like Mexican! Sorry to interrupt your supper. Charlie got himself arrested again and Jessie's still up in Denver. Express is fixin' to leave tomorrow without an escort. Just thought you should know. All right. Where's that bottle? Coffee's on the stove. You comin'? I make it a habit not to get involved in government affairs. What is it? CURLY: Railway workers' pay is comin' up this month. It'll mean some good money. We don't rob the Express. We might make an exception. All right, I'll be with you in a minute. Unless you got a problem with that? I'm hoping you gentlemen might put down those weapons and make me rich. We're deliverin' the mail. You don't mind if we take a look? There's nothing valuable here. Well, you'll forgive me if I don't take your word for it, won't you? Don't do it! Shit! Son of a bitch! Let's get out of here. Fuck! Hey. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! DAD MASON: Ben? Yeah, he's... He's okay. What? What? What? No, no Spanish, Dad. Come on, no Spanish. Not Spanish! English! Oh, shit. Oh, Dad! Let's see what we got, boys! A good man is dead! Do you remember when we got these? I saw an opportunity. Different kind of outlaw. Yeah. Pick it up. You'll draw? I'll draw. Hardly seems fair. Anytime. You don't have to do this. We plan everything in great fuckin' detail. No unnecessary violence. Any questions? Hell, what are we gonna do with him? Feed him to the pigs. Whose? What? Well, almost all of us here got hogs and no offense, but he'd make some good eatin' for 'em. We'll figure it. Well, that'd be great. Slow down now. They did you a good one there. It's just a scratch. Real sorry about Dad. Me, too. Maybe they did get me pretty good. John Mason. Rudd Gordon. I'm really sorry to hear about Dad. Thanks. Not half as sorry as those masked assholes are gonna be. It's good to see you, John. You remember Alice? Been tendin' to you for three days. Mmm. I'm gonna keep tendin'. He needs to rest. Just a couple hours. Come on. All right. You mind if I keep this for mendin'? Ah. Thanks, I don't think it'll be necessary. Oh, it's not necessary? Well, how about I be the one to decide what's necessary around here when it comes to textiles and you just say, "Thank you. Thank you very much." Thank you. Very much. ALICE: But you don't know for certain. RUDD: Well, I suppose not for certain. Well, they've always granted extensions in the past. RUDD: Yeah, well, not anymore. Standard Rail says they want it all. ALICE: I just sent a telegram asking for another six months. Alice. No, where are we gonna get $5,000? I'll figure it out. Hey. Oh, look who's finally up! Good morning. Mason. It smells great! Be my guest. Well... What's going on, boss? He don't know nothin'. No? It's fine. Can I speak with you for a moment? In private? Come on in, man. Phew! Well? Do you know what happened between John Mason and his father? His mother. Dad Mason lost his wife, John's mother. A few years later he met a woman. Oh. And John didn't approve. He was still broken up over his mother, yeah. Hmm. The new woman, was she Spanish? She was Mexican. "She was Mexican"? She died of consumption a few years later. Oh, bad luck. Yeah, bad luck. What's this? Oh, that's the rail workers' salary comin' in. We gotta get that money up to Canada, so... The money's here now? Well, no, I mean, they don't tell us when it's comin' in exactly because, you know, that's for our own protection they say because, you know, road agents and bandits they'd do just about anything to get their hands on that kinda money. So... I would like to ask for your sister's hand in marriage. Well, no kidding! No, I'm not kidding. Did you think I was kidding? No, Ben, I just can't believe it took you this long. Oh, well? Well, if she'll have you, you're all right with me. I'm just glad I haven't killed you. Thank you. Okay. All right, well, I gotta go pick somethin' up from the depot at Grey Falls! Good luck! Yeah. Hey. So, why did you come all the way back here to Promise? What's the story with you and Ben? Ben McClure is a friend. Now he's my friend, too. I like to think that you are my friend, we're just, uh, different kind of friends, so. Oh, shit. It helps me sleep. Yup. Alice told me I'd find you here. Well, that's not bad for shootin' leaves. Let's see how you do with a moving target. Well, a little slower than I remember, but that's probably on account of the whiskey. Dad was tryin' to tell me somethin' as he was dying. I know you're losing the ranch. I overheard you and Alice. Well... I think that's what Dad was trying to tell me. Oh? I wanna help. Well, John, unless you got $5,000 squirreled away, I'm afraid we're movin'. That's a lot of money, Rudd. Ain't no way to come by it honestly, I'm afraid. I don't do that anymore. Yeah, I know. I am due a few hundred on account of Dad's passing. You are more than welcome to that. I appreciate that. You got any more apples? Ah! That was me. That was me. That was all me. That was all me. Well, obviously you're still drunk because that was me. You are still so full of shit. Let's go get another bottle. That's a whole lot of money. I ain't after the money. Hello, friend! Be careful. There are explosives back there. I'll be comin' for that. This could get real messy. Move along now. I said, move along! Move out! You okay? Yeah. I should start chargin' for medical attention. I'd pay for it. Hey, where you off to? A loose end I gotta tie up. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! COCHRANE: Are you from around these parts? Born not five minutes from here. I can't stand this god-forsaken place. I can't wait till I get back east. It's civilized back there. Money, medicine, a man can get a decent bottle of Scotch. I'm lookin' for someone. Anyone in particular? Of course, someone in particular. A fellow named John Mason. I got three dead in Missouri on account of him. A man's gotta answer for his crimes. I mean, even if the victims were devoid of any semblance of moral rectitude, the law is the law. Well, spoken like a real concerned citizen. I imagine that kind of concern comes with a nice reward. Yeah, I know John Mason. He came through Promise not two days back lookin' for supplies for a long trip. Any idea which way he was headed? Sure could use myself a drink. He mentioned Nevada. He said he had business in Carson City. Nevada. Well, that there ain't Scotch. It's Bourbon. From Kentucky! Well, that's where Bourbon comes from, doesn't it? Well, you'd be surprised on what passes for Bourbon around these parts. Mind if I be keepin' that? Not at all. Thank you. Gentlemen. The next time I tell you to get movin', you fuckin' move. Easy, boss. Yeah, easy, boss. I'm gonna take my share. Good afternoon, Sheriff! You're Dad Mason's son. John. The name is Hayden. I ought to arrest you where you stand. You and Alice Gordon used to steal my daddy's crab apples. I'll give you this, you were fast as hell. You still run like that? Only when I have to. Well, your father was a good man. Thank you, Sheriff. Still lookin' to get the men that did him. The masked road agents started up last year, small time robbin'. They usually work over the border in Montana. Never killed no one before Dad. Well, I'd appreciate you keepin' me informed. Thanks again. Take it off. Please. I was thinkin' I'd meet McClure at the station. Oh, that's your trouble. Too much thinkin'. No, no, he's all right, boys. He's a friend. Come on in. Hey, what kept you? Oh... Yeah, never mind. Look at this. We got the money. Who else knows about this? Nobody. What about those two gorillas? Oh, yeah, I trust them like I trust you, John, with my life. That's the rail workers' pay, huh? Yeah. It's a lot of money. Yep. So, you comin' to the Double Cross for supper tonight? I'll be there. Atta boy. So, what do you think of Alice? She's pretty swell, huh? Oh, yeah, no, she's... She's real swell. Yeah. Yeah. Alice Gordon? And from the sound of that, I would say that that is a peacemaker. Well, if you know this weapon then, uh, I'm guessing you have some understanding of the mischief it could cause with a man's features. May I come in? He's supposed to have killed a fellow in Tulsa over a box of cigars. A box of cigars. Can you believe that? No, John ain't like that. Look, Miss Gordon, you have no idea what Dodge City can do to a man. John Mason was sheriff there for a while, a good one. Until things went bad. And then really bad as things sometimes do in Dodge City. May I offer you a drink? What do you want with John? What do I want with John? Did you ever hear the story about him winning his freedom from this hellhole of a prison in Mexico? About cutting cards with this rich kid? This kid who was a piece of uneducated, loathsome... I can't use the word in the presence of a lady. I love being in the presence of a smart, beautiful woman. What genius! What a wonder that God would take Adam's rib and create Eve. Brilliant. Just brilliant. Anyway, apparently the prison was overcrowded and they had just brought in the Gaston Gang and they needed room to lock them up. Have you not heard of the Gaston Gang? No, I have not. Ah, nasty, very nasty. Anyway, to make a long story short, the rich kid and John were forced to cut cards to see who would be set free and who would rot in hell. Then John pulled the big spade. Lucky, huh? What are the odds of him doing that? One in fifty-two. Yes. Yes, one in fifty-two. I had the opportunity to speak to two of the Gaston Gang who had been there and they said that John didn't touch the cards, that the guards cut the deck for them. But the kid's family back east doesn't believe that. They think John cheated and because the kid died in prison, they want their pound of flesh and that's why they hired me, to go find him. And that's why I want John Mason. Because when I bring him in, or bring in what's left of him, that'll settle all my debts, give me a little money to... The aroma of you is exquisite. You are a magnificent woman. You know, I think you should get the fuck out of my house. You're not only magnificent, you are very, very persuasive. COCHRANE: Hello, John. I missed ya at the ranch. It's a little nicer than your other place, but that shack had its charms. To be honest with ya, I miss it. I'm sure you do. You know, I had a nice, little garden there. That was a garden? You have to be gentle with a garden. Did I tell you I nearly got hold of you up in Medicine Hat a year ago? That would have been real nice to catch up. Alice is a very impressive woman. Very. John. They made me a marshal. How's it feel? It's interesting. The reward is dead or alive, but I get a $500 bonus if I bring you in alive. You give me your word that you won't run, I'll give you a little time. I appreciate it. I hear tell there's an establishment up at Great Falls. Madam Kara's? Madam Kara's. Now would that still be open for business? Excellent. Excellent. Two days from now, huh? A fork in the road just outside the town at dusk. You come alone. I know I don't need to mention this, but if you did decide not to appear, I would kill everyone. Absolutely everyone. Trouble? Just a man lookin' for a quiet place to retire. He could do a fuck of a lot better than Promise, Wyoming. Eh, I dunno. I might have some word on one of the masked assholes that done in Dad. Pretty good, huh? It's great. Oh, you're late. ALICE: What's that, Rudd? Me and the Dixie Boys were on our way to pick up them new hogs. Then we came upon them. They're all dead. You sure? Undertaker has them at the church. Let's go take a look. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense. They all had masks on 'em. And two of 'em swore up and down they were the ones who done it. These are Cochrane's boys. What are they doing robbin' the Express? The money? I don't see Cochrane. No? No. I killed 'em all pretty near. Pretty near might not do it. JOHN: Pour the Kentucky's finest. Yes. ALICE: No. Good job! Did Mason tell you about the plan that he had to catch the outlaws? Before you killed them, I mean. Mason wanted to use the rail workers' money as a lure, flush 'em out. Well, John and I do know a little bit about outlawin'. That was a long time ago. BEN: You did some outlawin'? Oh, we did some. And then we did some more. Yeah, I think maybe you should slow down. I think I would like to hear about this. JOHN: Like I said, that was a long time ago. It wasn't that long ago, John. And you're my sister, not my mother. Oh, there, you happy now? Hey. Come on in. You ready? Yeah. Good morning, Sheriff. Alice. Where you off to? Sheriff said they caught someone with one of those masks in the other county. It's only a 10 minute ride from here. You think them ones Rudd handled ain't all of 'em? It can't hurt to ask, get some more facts. Let's go. Where they goin'? Sheriff said they found one who had a mask on him. Still alive. Come on, let's go! Where are you taking me? Promise, eventually. I ain't done nothin'. Get up, get up! You sure about that, huh? Yeah. JOHN: What's this? Fuck you. Sheriff, mind giving me a minute here? I'll be around the corner. Don't leave me here with him! You killed my father. Who was in on it, huh? It wasn't personal. Who? Who was in on it? It was... What the fuck? He was going for your other gun, John. Rudd! I swear, Sheriff. He was going for Mason's other gun. Fuck! He's got the double X brand. This man look familiar to you? Huh? He looks like a cowhand that maybe we had a couple months back, but, I mean, John, they come and go! You doing okay? I'm okay. Okay. I don't think we should keep doing this. I agree. It's very irresponsible. What are you thinkin'? I don't think Rudd got the right guys. BEN: What are we lookin' for? Fresh graves. Shouldn't we get permission first? Or some assistance? Hey! Here! Here! You take the upside. That's one. You know, Dad talked a lot about you. Did he? Yeah. He said you were workin' in Texas as a marshal? Ranger. What? Nothing. Well, Dad says... Well, he said that you could shoot the button off a man's coat at 100 yards. Well, he was prone to exaggeration. Yeah, I suppose he was. Oh! I think I just hit one of 'em. They dig some shallow graves around here. No brands. Not a one. If it wasn't these ones who did it, who was it? We gotta put 'em back. Great. ALICE: That was the last extension. There's still time. They're coming to take possession in a week. Telegram says that we can pay upon arrival. Sure, Rudd, how are we gonna get $5,000 in a week? I'll figure it out. Thirty years I've been savin' myself for you, pretty lady... That was good! ...and I love you. And I want you to make babies with me. Hey! RUDD: John Mason! McClure here is tryin' to figure out a way to ask my little sister to marry him. What do you think about that? I mean, there's always room on the bride's side if you wanna give her away. She's been givin' a little bit away, my sister. Hasn't she? What are you talkin' about? I come in peace. Are you takin' over for Dad? Nah. I'm just straightening up a few things. I'm leaving care of the Express to McClure. Oh. John, I'm... Hey, I know. You really gonna turn yourself in to that bounty hunter? I gave the man my word. Well, things have a way of workin' out. Hey, I don't think I've ever seen that safe closed before. The railway workers' money came in. Oh. When's it headin' out? But I guess you wanna keep them details a secret. No, I put the word out. It leaves tomorrow morning. You put the word out? I'm trying to attract a certain element. They're all dead. Maybe. So you escortin' that money yourself? Yeah. You wanna ride with me? No, I try to stay out of... Government affairs. I remember. You still sore about them horses? Nah, there's no reason for both of us to get the lash. John, you didn't even run. Never been much of a runner. Oh, I think we're way past you takin' your fuckin' hat off. I understand you're going to be escortin' the Express with the rail workers' money. That's right. You know, somebody might actually take it upon himself to rob that Express. I'm countin' on it. You know, I'm gonna be really pissed if you go and get yourself killed. I'll keep that in mind. I just have this feeling that something terrible is gonna happen. We can't. Ben is gonna ask for your hand in marriage. Ah, well, he doesn't know where my hands have been. Shit. Huh! You're wearin' McClure's ring. McClure? Where did you get this? Rudd. ALICE: Where you off to? I'm gonna help Greyson move some ponies. You need the Winchester for that? John Mason's a killer, you know. Worked for the Pinkertons out in New York City. Killed for money. Yeah. You wouldn't know anything about that, right? Killing for money? Where'd you get this ring? Show me your shoulder. I'm comin' with you. No, I need you to stay here and mind the office. Dad worked for the Express, he didn't own it. And I ain't askin'. Hey! Whoa, whoa! Don't move and lower your weapons. We just want the money. Hand it over and nobody gets hurt. I'm afraid this ain't our money to give. Come on. You don't wanna do this. Fuck. Come on! What happened? I couldn't shoot him. It's okay. No, it's not okay. You promise you'll come back to me. I promise. Come on! Where's the money? I know you took it, John. Yeah, I took the money. I also know you killed my father. Deputy, take Mr. Mason into custody. Sheriff's department just got a little smaller. We had to let a few of 'em go. Don't do it, John. Shut the fuck up, Greyson. Are you gonna put the money back? It doesn't seem to be the safest place for it. CURLY: John Mason, you're under arrest for stealing federal money and assaulting a peace officer. You weren't a peace officer when I assaulted you, you sure as shit ain't a peace officer now. No! Don't! You get your hands off him! You son of a bitch! ALICE: Let me go! RUDD: It was an accident. Sure. The marshal's comin' up day after tomorrow. Gonna be askin' a whole lot of questions. Yeah, well, if two of those questions are, "Where's the money?" And "Who killed Dad Mason?" I might be able to help him out. You're gonna wanna get me that money. Dad saw your brand. I ain't losin' the Double Cross, John. I never really cared for that name. I can see how it's fitting though. I love my sister, Mason. But look into my eyes so you know that I'm telling you the truth. I will sacrifice her to save the ranch that my daddy worked so hard to build. Now get me my money. I'm gonna give you an hour to get out of town. How is it that you're the one threatening me, yet you're the one behind bars? Maybe you didn't hear me. Alice's life is in your hands. JOHN: Fifty-nine minutes. Jesus Christ, Rudd! What the hell are you doin'? Now's not a good time, Ben. Okay. Is there somethin' going on between John Mason and Alice? I don't know if it's anything serious, but, um, it's goin' on. Okay. Those bullets meant for John? They're in case we need to talk. Talk. I want you to stay here. Curly will keep an eye on you. JOHN: They're gonna hang you, you know. Shut up. Hey, it's true. You know, they say a hanging man shits himself Shut the fuck up! You're the one going to hang for killing them Pinkertons. What? I said Pinkertons. What? Pinkertons. I'm sorry, I can't understand a word you are saying. You mumble, you know that? Open your ears, Cincinnati John Mason. I said Pinkertons. Oh. Yeah. JOHN: I told you! I ain't never been to Cincinnati. You're not gonna give me any trouble, are you? Your brother did what he had to. For you. I could do something for you. Okay. What? You hard of hearin'? Well, what exactly you sayin'? Do I gotta spell it out for you? No, ma'am. Nice and slow. Uh-uh. Everyone knows you keep a Derringer under your pillow, darlin'. I had to switch hidin' places. And it ain't no fuckin' Derringer. Now how's about you keep that little hand cannon of yours inside its holster so that I don't have to shoot you again and get your blood dirtying up my pretty dress. You boys got your stories straight for when the marshal comes? We get Mason to get the money for us, then his word against ours, Mason gets arrested. You got it? And no killin'. Would you mind giving me a hand? Oh, looks like you almost got it. We're gonna need McClure. McClure, you in here? What? Great. What's the plan? Great coffee. Oh, thank you. Can I have a word? All right. You care about Alice. So do I. I need you to do somethin' for me. Get her out of town, wait it out. I'll come for you when it's over. All right. ALICE: Goddamn you, Ben McClure! You know, I really wish you didn't make me do this. Goddamn it, if you don't let me go, I swear to God I'll kill you myself! Oh, come on now, Alice! Look, all right, get set down right here. Stop it! Just stop, all right? I will let you go soon enough. Look, John needs our help. Yeah, I'll say he does. Ben McClure, did you do somethin'? Greyson and Curly are dead. Mason and Alice are gone. He took the money. He ain't goin' nowhere. Time's up. I just want my money. You're under arrest. Where'd you get the tin? Off the chest of a good man. A man you murdered. Well, that's your word against all of ours and with your history of violent behavior... Hand over your weapons. Don't give 'em the money. That ain't gonna help you. It can't hurt. McClure here got himself all drunk and jealous and took the bullets out of your guns. I'm sorry, John. I wasn't using my head. Just give me the money now. It's all yours. Boys? You know, they ain't gonna do you much good without bullets. You know, it's a funny thing when you take the bullets out of a man's gun. It changes the weight. That's enough. Put 'em down, Mason. It's over, Rudd. Come on. Put down the gun. There's no more money left. You son of a bitch! BEN: Hey, John? Hey. Oh, shit. Yep. It's all good. I'm okay. You're gonna be okay. Rudd's boys took the ring. We'll talk about it later. Is he okay? Yeah, he's gonna live. Come on. Okay, I got you. I got you. Dad wasn't supposed to be at the Express. We all got some place we gotta be. Eloquently put. You die first. No, Alice... Hey, put down your gun. Now, looks like your luck's finally run out, John Mason. You got a badge. Your gardening got boring for you, did it? Gentlemen? You're here for Mason. No, I'm not here for Mason. It was Mason that found me bleedin' like a stuck pig in the bushes near where you left me for dead, you son of a bitch! You killed four good men. Take him away. Now, don't lose these. Make sure he doesn't lose these. This paper sets you free and clear as far as Missouri is concerned and this is a telegram from the people back east saying that they accept my conclusion that you are not responsible for what transpired in Mexico. Sorry I couldn't do anything about Ohio. Hey... I know. You've never been in Cincinnati. John. I got a train takin' me east. I'm never comin' back here. I always thought I was gonna bid farewell to you and you'd be dead. But you're not. Congratulations. Goodbye, John. Goodbye, Miss Gordon. COCHRANE: I hate the west! I don't suppose you'll help me explain to the railway company what happened to that extra money, huh? What extra money? Let's just say I left a little out of those bags that just exploded. How much is a little? Eh, I dunno. Roughly. Somewhere in the neighborhood of $5,000. JOHN: You ever been to Cincinnati? ALICE: No.
