 

                        My boys. Oh, shoot. Shoot. You're not real. You... You're not real. One. Two. Three. No. Go away! Go away, leave! No, go away. Mom? I can't. No baby, no, stay up there, Aiden! Stay up there. Don't you come down here, you stay with your brother. No, no, no, no, you stay right there. Don't you go, you leave them alone. Take me! I'll go. I'll go if you leave them alone. I swear. I deserve it. I deserve it. An American doctor, living in Haiti, has vanished, and with him, thousands of dollars of earthquake relief money that he was in charge of. Dr. Cody Chase, who ran a mental health hospital outside of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, has been missing for three weeks. Local authorities have suspended their investigation. After the earthquake that rocked Haiti, in 2010, Dr. Cody Chase was put in charge of hundreds of thousands of dollars of earthquake relief money, and became a bit of a local hero. But "Hardline Investigates" discovered a checkered past, involving drug dealing, assault, and accusations of embezzlement. This raises even more questions about what really happened. Did Cody Chase revert back to his old ways and abscond with the money? Or did the darker forces of Haiti, filled with corruption, violence and gangs, get the best of a man just trying to turn his life around? Only Haiti knows. I'm looking at your records, Mr. Chase, and you did previously request an extension. Unfortunately, we can't do that, since we have some past due payments. I- I understand, I- I just, you would really be doing me a favor if you could just help me out and extend my prescription. I haven't been late on my payments until recently. But why do you need an extension? Because my prescription is only good for three months, and, please, you would really be helping me out. I'm sorry, sir, that's the best I can do. Okay, look. I am trying to make ends meet, okay? I lost my job, I lost my benefits, I am moving out of my condo, as we speak. I don't have time to keep going back and forth to the doctor's office. I'm sorry, sir, that's the best I can do. Oh, my God. Ah! Dammit, you suck. No need to be rude, sir. Thank you for calling. No! No, no, no, no! No, hello, hello, hello? Oh, what next? Moving? Again. So much for sentimentality. I gave at the office. Nice to see you, too. Pack your bags. HI wants us to go to Haiti for a longer segment about Cody's disappearance. Us? You're the tabloid TV reporter. Dirty laundry is your gig, not mine. Oh, come on, Aiden. You know what I do, so I had to twist things around a bit, that's part of the job, and it worked. And I got you a spot on the crew, which wasn't easy. I was expecting a "thank you". Got it all figured out, as usual, huh? Everything except why you're so goddamn stubborn. Cody and I lost each other a long time ago. You should know that. You were there. And I put that behind me. You should, too. Behind me? Yes. My entire life has fallen apart since then and I don't know why. I was on track to be Vice President, now I can barely hold a job. I have been popping Benizone for the last five years just to keep myself from jumping off a bridge in my sleep! That's how much that fucked me up five years ago. And you want me just to put that behind me? And on top of that my benefits just ran out. We're dead to each other. Why should I help him now? Because he's your brother. Despite all your rivalry bullshit he wouldn't give up on you. So don't you dare give up on him. Again. No. He gave up on me first. I don't know why, and it doesn't matter. But we're in different worlds now. And wherever we end up... ...that's where we should stay. You know the past can only haunt you if you let it. Take care of your brother. I abandoned him. Aiden. Aiden, wake up. Again. Yeah. They're getting worse. More real each time. I came by to give you these. Guess I was a little late. Where did you get this? Being a B-list celebrity has its perks. I need something stronger than this. Let's go find my brother. Haiti is a nation in recovery. Since the 2010 earthquake, Haiti has struggled to get back on its feet. But if anyone has the spirit in them, to fight back from tough times, it's the Haitians. This is where Cody Chase decided to try and make a difference. Perhaps in a land full of people trying to start their lives over, he could as well. He found this vacant building in a remote village thirty minutes outside of the Haitian capitol of Port-au-Prince. Here he took his patients in an effort to build again. This is the last place Dr. Cody Chase was seen alive. This is where Hardline Investigates begins our search for a man in turmoil, a man shrouded in mystery, a man gone missing. That's a bit overly dramatic, isn't it? Do you mind? We're still filming. That's good, thanks. Don't you think we should at least meet our host before you try to win your Emmy? We might as well get some work done while we're waiting for the welcome wagon. Bonjour. Dr. Yveline Montase, hospital director. I apologize for my tardiness, but we had a patient emergency. Nice to finally meet all of you in person. This is Duane, my cameraman. - Hi. - Bonjour. And Peanut, my associate producer. Hi. Bonjour. Welcome to Haiti. And you are? Oh, hi. This is Aiden Konstipovan. Aiden Konstipovan my assistant. Bonjour. Welcome. Please, come. Let me show you around. I am so grateful that you can do this story. It's important that the world know how far we've come. And yes, how far we've yet to go. This place is massive. Oh, yes, it is. Most of it is abandoned and boarded up. Not touched in years. But we fixed up a small area that we can use. Still a work in progress, as you can see. If this place doesn't have hot water, I'm out. Who cares? It's badass. Think of it as urban camping. You mean the ghetto. Something only hipsters think is cool. Um, "Konstipovan"? We don't want them to know that you're his brother. Could be dangerous. Yeah, but, "Konstipovan"? It's Croatian for "constipated". Thought it fit. Dude, this place is freakin' amazeballs. Amazeballs. Wow, is that what they're saying these days? I am getting old. Stick with me, Pops, I got your back. I'll make you relevant again. What made you think I was ever relevant to begin with? Doctor, when did you first start working here? I started shortly after our last hospital director, Dr. Chase, went missing. He did a very good thing founding this hospital. Mental illness is highly stigmatized in our culture. It's a shame what's happened. Was there ever any investigation? Any police that we can speak to? The local police were of little assistance and no one else here cares to talk. This village doesn't exactly embrace western beliefs and medicine. And the things that they do believe in are not to be talked about. You'll find this village has many secrets. Is there a secret Starbucks around somewhere? 'Cause I'd love a Frappuccino. Jeez, pussy. Please, let's continue. Aaahh! Maybe I should get your back. What was that about? My apologies. We are in a mental hospital with very few staff. Some patients we allow to roam freely, but others we must restrain. We've had to move this one a few times already. Please. Let's get you settled, huh? Feel free to use our lobby as your workplace. It is much more comfortable here. Oh, hello. It's great. Welcome home. This is really great. Ewenso, desann bou ou ak pran yo nan chanm yo! Hey, Boss. We're American news crew, right? Yeah. Well, I was gonna go on that Starbucks run, just fuckin' with you, there's no Starbucks, but when I came back this was on the doorstep. Has Bree seen this? No, you're the first. "I heard you're investigating the hospital disappearances. "My friend worked at the hospital, "he sent me this before he vanished. "I am not in a position to help, but maybe you Americans can. Sincerely, a friend of Emmanuel. " Shall we? Yeah. Yes, indeed. All right, so these files are huge so they're taking forever to load so we're just gonna watch them, one by one, okay? Is the camera on now? It's on? Cody. Okay, here we go. Entry number seven, in Project Resurrection, exploring voodoo's role in seizures associated with autoscopy of temporal lobe epilepsy. I'm Dr. Cody Chase. This is hospital administrator, Billy Kross. Behind the camera is our assistant, Emmanuel. And this is our newest patient, dubbed by the orderlies as, Ke Kontan Nonm, or Happy Man. So, what's this guy's story? School principal. Post traumatic stress disorder after the earthquake killed a bunch of his students. Probably couldn't handle the guilt. Looks like he had time for art classes. Yeah, he's been drawing these voodoo symbols the last few days. We're gonna need a real voodoo priest to analyze this. Have to call Papa J. Doc, the voodoo in this place is off the deep end, even for Haiti. I don't like swimmin' in the deep end. The fact that the village is, is a magnet for Haitian black magic, could be a godsend. I mean, we have all these resources at our fingertips to help us. Help us? They think this place is cursed. They say these patients aren't crazy. They're possessed by voodoo spirits. You- you sound like you're starting to believe it. All I know is, patients have been disappearing. - I've heard rumors. - Yeah. Or, or they could have just wandered off. We don't have the resources to watch every patient 24/7. I'm saying there's some strange stuff going on in this village. Stuff that we will never even begin to understand. Alright, well, what do you want me to do? We've done everything known to western medicine at our disposal, it is time to try something else. It's easy to fear the things we don't understand. We just need to understand it. I need you to document some research on this for me. I'll review it when I get back. Back? Where are you going? Gonna go to the village. I'm gonna find Papa J. We need our voodoo priest back. Entry 12 in Project Resurrection. Today's class: Voodoo 101. "Voodoo is an ancient religion "that worships a supreme, silent god. "This silent god works through countless lesser spirits "who interact with the human world. " Okay, now can you get some shots of this stuff, you know, and edit it in? "Each spirit has their own aspect of life "they rule over. "Such as Erzulie Dantor, the goddess of romance "and jealousy. "Baron Samedi, the god of death. "Kalfu, black magic, "guardian of the entrance to the spirit world, "the crossroads. " Boy, this stuff is really creepin' me out. Here. This is about the drawing we found in Happy Man's room. "Voodoo has symbols representing "various voodoo spirits. "Each spirit has his or her own symbol "which can vary from region to region "and serves as a beacon for the spirit world. "During voodoo rituals the symbols are usually drawn "on the floor and call the spirit "to descend towards earth. " Holy... Every house of voodoo worships differently. Papa J's house believes that the demons are in the deepest, darkest corners of the spirit world. Papa J gives this place a name, lanfe' vodou. This is where they keep their possessed souls. Here, Cody, check this out. "The bizango "are a black magic secret society of sorcerers "who use voodoo to serve the more evil "and violent spirits. " See, this is what I was talking about. I been hearing rumors about the bizango kidnapping patients. People say they take them deep into the abandoned areas of the building for human sacrifices. I been hearing things at night, and I know you have, too. This place is cursed. And if we don't leave, so are we. Check this out. No... No, no, no, no. It froze, this video's corrupt or something. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Can you fix it? Y... Yeah, I think so, it's just, last time this happened it took, like, a whole day to debug, so... Come on, man. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Hello? Yes, I am looking for Papa J. My name is Aiden, I'm with a television company from the United States and I was wondering if I could just ask you a few questions... Well, yes, I am staying at the Saint Dymphna. Um, is there any way that I could just as... Hello? Hi, yes, uh, my name is Aiden and I'm working with an American television company. I was wondering if I could just ask you a few questions regarding the disappearance... Hello? Hey. Coffee? How's it going? Something's wrong with the phones in this country, they keep dropping my calls. Maybe they didn't like my brother, either. Yeah, you hate your brother so much you flew all the way over here to save him. You have a lump of coal for a heart. I have a heart? Maybe I should get one these witch doctors to operate on me to find it, huh? Hm. Maybe. Actually, we prefer houngan. Jean Drouillard, assistant to Papa J, at your service. Witch doctor. I assisted Papa J when he consulted Dr. Cody on voodoo treatments for the patients. I was not here when he disappeared. Well, we do appreciate your help. The best way to help you, and your stupid American reality TV, is to ask you to leave this village. You trying to scare us stupid Americans away with your voodoo bullshit? Ah, stupid Americans. Voodoo is a world religion. Over 400 years old. It's a melange of African traditions and European Christianity. You should not reject what you do not understand. You should not fear the people of Haiti, you should fear its spirits. What happens to all of us in life is the will of the spirits. They must be honored in ceremony and ritual. If the spirits are satisfied with our offerings they will bring good fortune. And if they're not satisfied? What do they bring? Punishment. By whom? The spirits? Or the bizango? I should go. Wait. Cody is my brother. I have to find him. If someone was kidnapping the patients then maybe Cody was trying to stop them. Maybe he... Maybe he took the money and ran, hm? I don't believe he did. I found this video with their experiments on the patients. He was exploring the effects of voodoo on them. Where did you get that? It's complicated. Us stupid Americans are like that. Now. Where is Papa J? I need to talk to him. Papa J disappeared with the rest of them. I've been looking for that old man ever since without a clue. Until now. We still have a couple videos we've yet to view. You wanna find out what happened to them? Let's find out together. The last few days we've been experiencing some oddities. These bloody handprints appeared out of nowhere. Reminds me, when my brother and I were little, we used to paint our hands and put 'em on the wall. God. Mom was pissed. Got this? This viscous fluid emanating from the walls has yet to be thoroughly tested, but it appears to be blood. Is this really necessary, Kross? Unfortunately, yes, Doctor. This place has gotten weird ever since we admitted him. He makes the other patients go bonkers. Okay, look, I just don't like to restrict him if we don't have to. Look. It's my job to keep this place safe. Let me do my job. See? See? That's what I mean. Look, fine, fine. You do your job your way and let me handle this mess mine. Voodoo is not the answer, Doc. I am trying to use it to save them. They believe their curse. They have to confront that curse in their own minds. What do you know about being cursed? Everything. We all have our demons, Kross. Even you. What would you give to be rid of that thing that haunts you the most? Anything. So would I. So would they. I'm scared, Aiden. I'm really scared. You gotta get out of here. You were protected, but he's coming for you, too. He's coming for you, too. Who, who? Who's coming for me? The Tormentor. Holy shit. I was just in my childhood basement with Cody. It was so, it was so real. The Tormentor was there. Who? The Tormentor. It's what we used to call a night terror that Cody would have when we were younger. I didn't start havin' 'em until a few years ago. I was standing on that thing. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That is Kalfu. The dark guardian of the crossroads, who allows access in and out of the spirit world. Aiden. Aiden! You traveled into the spirit world. How? The spirits must be using your memories to draw you and Cody together. For what? I do not know. Happy Man was there. He knows something, we need to talk to him, he knows something, now. Happy Man is possessed. He cannot respond because he's not of this earth. We should ask the spirit who possesses him. How do we do that? The last staff member has left and the patients are locked down. Ewenso, mwen te panse mwen te di nou ranje sa yo limye. For the record, I do not agree with this. But out of respect for Dr. Chase's work, I will allow this to proceed. Let's get this over with. Before a spirit helps us we must satisfy them with offerings. Usually food, drink, and blood. The fresher and warmer the blood, the more life power for the spirit. Sometimes the spirit possesses people to continue its quest for blood. Don't be afraid. When an angry spirit possesses a person, the spirit must be appeased. If the spirit is satisfied, he, in turn, releases the body and blesses us with rain, crops, good luck. If he's not satisfied, he will be angry! Duane, wait, don't go! Lespri, tanpri pale ak nou. Ou te rele m', Linglesou, lespri a krwaze semen yo. He said, "You have summoned me, Linglesou, spirit of vengeance, to assist you in finding the spirit lost in the darkness. " Peanut, why? Yon ansorseleur majik nwa reklamasyon domen sou kote sa a nan mond ou. "A black magic sorcerer has claimed domain over this place in your world. " Jwenn sa a ansorseleur epi w ap jwenn nanm pedi ou bloke nan kacho I 'yo. "Find this sorcerer and you will find your soul trapped in his dungeon. " Help, Aiden, help! Si ou sove I 'soti nan prizon an mwen pral pemet ou ale ak ke poze. Si ou pa fe sa, ou pral peye omaj a m 'pou letenite ak san ou! "If you rescue him from the dungeon, I will let you go in peace. But if you do not, you will pay homage to me for eternity... ...with your blood!" No! No, no, no! No, no! Aaahh! Aaahh! Aaahh! Nan san yo nan lespri mwen! Where'd they go? It's... it's Happy Man. He has taken her into the spirit world to escape us. But he will be back. Wait, wait, wait, what? He's going to sacrifice them. He'll be back for our blood, too. Oh, ding-ding-ding-ding-ding, I'm sorry, this is where I get off. Wait, Duane, wait! What about Bree? I'm sorry. I can't do this. You selfish prick! Whoa. What the fuck just happened? Really? That is enough! You tell us exactly what in the world is going on! Of course. But we are no longer in our world. I will try to explain. We were in the real world, where only humans dwell. For the spirit to come here they need to possess a human. The ceremony pushed us into the crossroads where we are now trapped. We are still part of the physical world, but the spirits have much more power here. We cannot leave until we appease them. Happy Man has taken Bree and the others into the spirit world to escape us. But blood that is sacrificed to the spirits must come from the physical plane of existence. So, Happy Man will emerge, no doubt, back to the crossroads to take Bree to the sorcerer as a sacrifice to the spirits. Well, then we don't have much time. We need to find this black magic sorcerer and get Bree back. Is Happy Man the sorcerer? Maybe someone from the village? I don't know. It could be one of the patients as well. What about Papa J? Oh, my lad, it could not be him. Are you sure? Then who? Kross. Like, well, how can we trust you, Jack? Duane, come on. No, man, I'm having trouble processing all this crazy shit. People are dying and disappearin' and reappearin' out of thin air. Bree and Happy Man and my ex. Who? Who did you see? For a minute there I thought I saw my ex fiancee. Wh... what happened with her? I got her pregnant. And I told her I would take care of her and the baby, but I thought she was cheating on me so, as a huge "fuck you" I left them both. And she tried to kill herself because of it. Anyone else have a vision from their past? I uh... I thought I saw my big brother. Please, tell us. Ricky was your basic, overprotective big brother and got mad at my asshole boyfriend at the time, Puck. I told Ricky I'd break up with Puck, but I lied. I saw Puck about to jump Ricky, but I was so mad at Ricky I didn't warn him. He broke Ricky's jaw. He's my big brother, I should have had his back. Of course. During the ceremony Happy Man revealed that this place was cursed by the spirit Linglesou. Is that bad? Linglesou. Linglesou is the evil spirit who punishes those who go back on their word. Tears the flesh of humans. Craves fresh, warm blood. Oh, that sounds bad. He's punishing us for our broken promises. Wait. Our broken promises? What did you do? I assisted Papa J and Cody. But, I ran. I'm here now to keep my word to Cody and find him. What about Bree? Look, we gotta save her from crazy guy who can teleport people through space. God, I wish we could do that. Then we could just follow 'em. If Happy Man can take passengers, can I? It's worth a try. So? Who do we rescue first? Bree or Cody? Bree. The spirit world is composed of our memories. Aiden's memories of Cody trigger his descent into the spirit world. So we will start our search for Bree in Aiden's memories of Cody. I don't understand. This line is Cody's memories. He is here, we hope. This line is Bree's memories. This is where she will be. This line is your memory, Aiden. We need to follow your memory to a time you, Bree, and Cody shared together. From this moment we can go down Bree's line of memories. Those will lead us to the whereabouts of where she is now. Did you share a moment like that together? Aiden! Did you? Yes. Yes, we did. Then we must find this moment. Duane. Is that last video ready yet? Find something specific that triggers a memory you both share. Kross. Kross. You want blood? Take mine! Take mine! Kross, what happened? He said in order to free my grandson I needed to provide a sacrifice of blood. So I did. Who said that? The spirit. Kross, your grandson has been dead for five years. The chicken wasn't enough. He needs more blood. Help us. Help us all! Hey, help yourself. We'll go into the crossroads, hey. And we'll find our demons together. No! No! We need to leave this place! It's cursed! We gotta get out of here... We make our stand now! Look, I've learned enough voodoo to take the fight to our demons in the spirit world. G... God be with you, Cody. 'Cause I can't. Kross, Kross! If I don't come back, tell my brother, tell my brother I um... Tell him he didn't bring me into this. I brought it to him. And I'm sorry. Go Crocs. It's a poster. It's my brother's old apartment. We are in your memories. Oh, your memories stink. What's with the plastic? I have no idea. But this is definitely my brother's old apartment. How could you do this to me? I took care of you after Mom died! It's your fault she died. I didn't wanna do it, but you made me. You brought me into this! Into what? You've lost it, man. Aiden. Holy shit. What's happening to me? Aiden, you must remember, this isn't now. This is a memory. Don't get lost in it. No. But I've been here before. I am seeing things, I'm hearing things, I'm feeling things that I have felt before. It's like I'm reliving this and I don't know... You're not. This is five years ago. What, why can't they see us? They're in their own reality. We have to breech it to make contact. Do not talk to them. And if we do? We may be pulled in by their reality and lose ourselves. I stuck my neck out to get you that job interview and you blow it off to get drunk? Look at you! You're a goddamn waste of space. Damn you, Cody. How many more second chances can I hand you to fuck up? How many you got? This was a few months before our fight. We're moving backward through your memories. Oh, Jesus Christ! Many believe that voodoo spirits are ghosts of ancestors past. A person's special talent or skill in life comes from a spirit. When the person dies, the spirit must be transferred to a living person. If it's not, then the dead person will return to plague their living relatives. Hey, where's Cody? Where's my buddy? There's my favorite guy. Oh, don't cry. Aiden, go play. Come on. Come on, now. You just do as I say, everything will be all right. What are you doing? Stop it! No, stop it! No! Stop it! Help, Aiden, help! Whoa, easy. Dude, we lost ya there for a second. Yeah, I'm fine. But, what is this? Damn you, Cody. How many more second chances can I hand you to fuck up? How many you got? We can't all be perfect like you, Aiden. Your perfect suit and your perfect job and your perfect girlfriend. Oh, yeah, right, Bree perfect. You just don't know what you got. If only you could see it. I've seen enough to know that she's not the one. Asshole. Bree! No. Wait, no! Don't stop her. We'll follow her memory back to the present. Up a level to the crossroads. Aiden! Aiden. Bree! Cody! No! No! No! Peanut! It's my fault. I brought her here. At least we know what happened to Dr. Yveline and Papa J. I stopped Cody's bleeding, for now. I should have foreseen it. Foreseen what? Me and Papa J helped train Dr. Cody in just enough voodoo to care for the patients. But he always wanted more. Pompous American fool, I thought. I never believed he would call upon Linglesou to achieve that power we denied him. The power to fight the Tormentor. But he lost. So Linglesou claimed Cody's body as his own and became the black magic sorcerer. Can we get him out of here? His soul is lost somewhere. His body will not survive unless we find his soul. Oh, good Lord! What the... Is that...? Duane. This is the same image from the videos. Jean, what does this mean? This is a message from Dr. Cody. He is trapped in lanfe' vodou. Voodoo hell. So all we have to do is go down there and get him, then. Go down there, evade demons who swallow your soul, defeat the Tormentor, who imprisons Dr. Cody, and bring his soul back alive. Is that all? But you said if we don't mess with the memories, they won't mess with us. This place is different. In voodoo hell everything and everyone can hurt each other. And they will try. If your soul dies down there, your body dies up here and vice versa. The body cannot live without the soul. Well, what are we waiting for? We're not getting any younger. No, no. He is my brother, my battle, I go alone. A long time ago when we were together I told you I'd follow you to hell and back no matter what. Well, here we are. Make room. This whole thing is making me see things clearly now. My whole damn life I've been living for myself. But no more. I gotta get my daughter back and if this is gonna help me do it, then I'm in. Okay. That makes four of us. No. Three. I must remain here and send you deep into the spirit world. It's the only way. Besides, I know what's down there. I will stay with Dr. Cody. You Americans may be simple, but you are braver than I. So how do we know when we get to voodoo hell? Does it look like the DMV? These will be Aiden's memories. He will know where to find it. Are you scared? I'm terrified. Just wait. This is officially the worst shoot I've ever been on! Who's that in the picture? Hey, where's Cody? Where's my buddy? Our stepfather, Bob. Aiden, go play. Cody was frightened. Didn't want the monster to hurt him anymore. Monster? Is Bob your Tormentor? I totally blocked... I totally blocked it out of my mind. We were just kids. I promised Cody from then on I'd protect him. I remember poisoning Bob's scotch. He wanted a nightcap. So we gave it to him. Oh... No. He had it coming! You knew and you didn't do anything! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll make it up to you. I'll make it up to you! Cody blamed it on me. He said he didn't want to do it, but I made him. Why did you do that to Bob? For you! I did that for you! Boss. Come on back now, Boss. I got your back. I remember now. I remember all of it. After we killed Bob, Mom covered up the evidence. She buried his body parts in the hole in the basement. But she couldn't bury her guilt. I'm sorry. This is when Cody's night terrors started. When the Tormentor came. She had us all hypnotized that we would bury the memories deep within us. So that they wouldn't haunt us. But I don't think it worked on Cody. Or my mom. I deserve this. I deserve this. Cody blamed me for Mom's suicide. I never wanted to do it, but... I didn't want to do it, but you made me! You brought me into it! But it was really all... But it was really all my fault. Wait a minute. Who... who's coming for me? The Tormentor. I'll make it up to you. I'll make it up to you. Aiden. I know what it is. The Tormentor wasn't Bob. It was our guilt. It always lurked there like a creature in the darkness until... until it finally became one. Drove Mom mad. Cody tried to fight it, but he lost. And now... now it's my turn. We have to rescue Cody. Where is he? He would have taken Cody to the place where he was most afraid of. Where Mom buried Bob. The hole. Shit. Okay, we got a problem. Happy Man's guarding Cody. Tortured souls are in there. God, of all the crazy people in this place I definitely hate him the most. Okay, we need to get him out of there. One of us needs to be bait. Not it. You stay. You need to find Cody. We'll create a diversion. A diversion? How? Introduce him to Bob, the pedophile? Yeah, sure, they can have a "Hey, we're all crazy" party. That's not a bad idea. No, no, no, it's a bad idea because I was joking. Look, I know where to hide in Aiden's memories. We could lead Happy Man back up there, buy Aiden some time. Well, how will we know that the Tormentor didn't get you? Because if I fail we all end up rotting in there for the rest of eternity. I was hoping for a text message. Well. This is it. When I said "hell and back" I should have kept my big mouth shut. Well, we made it to hell. Now we just gotta make it back. Don't quit on me now. I never have. Okay. Let's go get your brother. All right. - Go, go, go, go! - Go, go, go, go, go! Under the bed, under the bed. That's the worst place to hide! Do you have a better idea? Go! Shit, shit, shit, shit. This is a really fucking bad idea. Sh, sh. Come on, come on. Stop it! Come on. Stop! You are such a goof. What am I gonna do with you? We shouldn't do this. Happened once, let's just leave it at that, okay? Aiden's acting weird. Yeah, but he deserves it. Treating us both like shit. You deserve better. Oh, gosh. Oh, shit, it's Aiden! Ohhh, shit. Hide under the bed. That's a terrible idea. Oh, shit. Just be quiet. Where is she? What the hell are you talking about? I know she's in here. Tell me where she is. Don't ever tell me what to do again. Oh, so you're gonna be a man now? Yeah. Because you weren't man enough. You motherfucker! Get off of me! How could you do this to me? I took care of you after Mom died! It's your fault she died. I didn't wanna do it, but you made me! You brought me into this! Into what? You've lost it, man! Bree! Bree get out here, I know you're in here. Bree! Why? You know why. 'Cause I was never good enough for you. Why him? Because he sees me. You don't see anything, Aiden. I mean, you used to be so full of life, but it's been replaced by this darkness. And there's this part of you that, that's missing. The part of you that loved. It's gone. But I still have the part that hurts. And the part that hates. Why have you become like this? You did this to me. I've tried our whole lives to protect you from yourself. Drugs, jail. But your demons won't let you go, and now they're trying to take me with you. You're right. It's him. Who? It worked on you. You were protected. How could I have not seen this the whole time? Seen what? He can't get to you. So he's pulling you into his darkness through me. Who? I hope you never know, Aiden. I hope you never know. I go... I gotta go somewhere where he can't reach you from. And I gotta... I gotta find a way to stop this. I'm sorry. Wait. I'm sorry. Cody? Cody, it's me, Aiden. Aiden? Yeah! Cody, Cody, it's me, it's me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What are you doing here? I'm saving you. I am so sorry. I... I understand it all now. You, Mom, the Tormentor. Why didn't you protect me, Aiden? Like you said you would. I'm here now. I'm gonna get you out of here. It's locked. No, no, no! Hold on. Okay. Step away from the ledge. It won't break! Let's go, let's go, right now! Okay, let's go, right now! Holy shit, your leg! Oh, my God, oh, my God. Shit, shit! The Tormentor. He's been with me this whole time. I can't kill my guilt. He'll always be with me. I promised Mom I'd take care of him, but I failed. I failed. You can't hurt us any more. It is too late. Get out of my head! We're both his now. No! There's no use for you any more. We did what we had to do! He was supposed to protect me. No! He did all he could! He kept his word. He came back to save me. He hasn't saved you yet. It doesn't matter. I forgive him. I just hope he can forgive me. Nooo. Noooo. We got him, bro. We got him. You saved my ass again, huh? No, Cody. No. This time, you saved mine. I'm so sorry. No, no, no, no. No more guilt. No more guilt. All our lives I've been trying to protect you. You were trying to protect me from him. Thank you. Don't say "thank you". I just, I just wanted to be like you. I miss Mom. Take me home, Aiden. Take me home. One, two, three. Hey. Cody, wake up. Hey, we did it, we did it! We killed the Tormentor, it's over. It's over. Cody. But... I'm sorry, Aiden. I tried, but the bleeding never stopped. He just passed a moment ago. We lost Duane, too. No. Nooo! My brother! I wish you had a chance to talk to him before he passed into the next world. I did. I did. He's with Mom now. And they're both safe. He made his big brother proud.
