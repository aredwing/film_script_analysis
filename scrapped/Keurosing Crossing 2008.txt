Stop talking in the hall, just do the cleaning. Don't talk in class. Get your act straight. Hey. What are you doing, all spaced out on your own? It's nothing. Hey, this looks news but it's sort of an old model. Hey, it passed out. You should feed it. Aren't you going to clean? I hate cleaning. It's such a bore! Oh yeah, about Ju-go... What about him? Next Saturday's his birthday. - Really? - Yeah. Wanna go together? I'm busy. You're busy on a Saturday? I'm usually busier on the weekends. You're kind of a snob. What? You, you snob. Hey, don't be like that. Let's go together, please? Is it such a big deal if you skip your tutoring class? He didn 't exactly say to come together, - but still how can you... - I'm late. See you later. Hey, Yul-lin! Hey! Where are you going? You're so rotten. Big sister Sis! Sis! Sis! I must've fallen asleep. I'm bored. All the kids left. I sleep so well. Hey! What's all this? What were you playing, to get this dirty? Wipe your nose... You've been a bad girl. - What did I tell you before? - I don't know. Bad kids are eaten by space monsters. I'm going to turn into one and eat you. Hey kid, you're dead if I catch you. Hey kid, rub harder. Like this? Like this? Does it feel good? Yeah, it feels good. It's a mohawk. Here, horns. Yeah, all you need is horns. - Beckham. - Beckham. A goblin. A princess. You look pretty. Very pretty. Sixteen years old, heart pounding Why haven't you changed yet? Mom, I'm not a kid anymore. Knock before you come in. That's a love letter, isn't it? No, it's not. Wash up and come eat. We've got some delicious strawberries. Alright. Do you want me to cook you something nice later? I told you I'm fine! Okay, don't stay up too late. Okay. You skipped gym class. So this is where you were hiding. You look carefree. You must have gotten good grades. So-so. My report card is a total joke. All I can do is laugh. If they threaten to cut my allowance or any shit like that, I'm gonna run away. Again? If you're gonna do it, do it for real. The weather's great.. Have you decided on a volunteer activity? Volunteer? I don't really want to. You think everyone else is doing it for fun? You need to do it to get the grades. Let's volunteer together. You don't want to swarm around in group either, do you? So the two of us... What are you doing? You're crazy! What if you fall? That crazy jerk! Any other ailments? No. It's not good for you to keep taking them. I don't take them often, but nowadays I can't get to sleep even with them. It's all psychosomatic. Exercise like I told you to before. That will help much more. Don't get too stressed over things. After this, I'm not writing you any more prescriptions. Exercise? Where shall we go? I don't know, wherever you want. Want to go see a movie? Is there anything you want to see? What about you? Probably not. Do we have to go somewhere? Do you know where we are? No. I thought you would. It wouldn't be any fun then. Really? You can get off if it's no fun. That's fine. Who says it's no fun? I'm having a good time. I might go around like this by myself later. You don't look like the type. What? You know you were really funny? Why? Why did you suddenly say we should all pair up? Everyone had agreed not to do that. And you hadn't said a thing before suggesting it. Well, it's something I really wanted to do. Come on, it's fun. How about a commemorative photo? No. Sorry. So you carry one of these around, too. Yeah, you know. Can I take a look at your pictures? Photos on digital cameras are always the same. - I guess. - They're boring. Are you mad? No. I was just thinking I guess you could look at it that way. Still, I like looking at them anyway. It's like you 're happy. Can I call you? Input your number. Here. What about me? I'll call you. Don't call me, even if you get my number on caller ID. I'll call you, alright? Who ever heard of such a thing! You have, just now. Never mind if you don't want to. You're a model student, you should be good at keeping rules. I'll see you later. Hey, I thought you said you were taking the bus here! I changed my mind. I'm taking the subway. See you. I'm not a model student. I love you I put the pictures I took on your birthday on my site so check them out. They're awesome. You look great. - Su-jin I actually called you back after we hung up that day. Did you? Anyway, how'd you know where I live? Huh? By magic. Guess. Su-jin must have told you. Want to come in for a minute? With your mom and dad at home? Would that be weird? Ju-go. Take this. I'm off. Hey. I always sleep on my stomach... ...How do you sleep? You don't even get mad at me. You don't even ask about when I stood you up. You're a really nice guy. Thanks. For keeping the rules so well, too. Thank you. Horror flick Da- rin! Da- rin! Da- rin! Da-rin, wake up. Da-rin, let's get up now! Hurry, let's eat. Try it. Good, isn 't it? How come it's hard to swallow food in the morning? You know I told you you still have to eat. I know. Shall we try some kimchee now? Kimchee is so delicious. Here. Kimchi's hot. I rinsed it in water. You have to eat kimchee to grow up healthy and strong. Go ahead and eat. Do you have a boyfriend at the nursery? Nope. All the boys must be blind. No, they're just all pranksters. Da-rin, don't ever give in if a boy chases after you. Why not? You have to get permission from me first, alright? Alright. Have fun playing at the nursery and listen to your teacher. And eat well. Okay! Shall we yell our motto today? Begin! Kentucky fried, chewy yum yum, bang bang. You're so adorable. - Hello. - Hello. - See you later. - See you! Want to meet? Thur. 7pm in front of Shinchon playground - Yul-lin Welcome. Looking for a camera? Let's see. This is the most popular model. It's the latest model out now. Has 1 million pixels, triple optical zoom and ten times digital zoom. This one. This one? This model has been out for a while. Compared to its price, it doesn't have many functions. Also, it's quite heavy. Dad, does this feel good? It feels good, doesn't it? Dad. Da-rin, what are you drawing? Mom, dad, you, and me. - That's me? - Yeah. My face is green. Da-rin, go see who's at the door. Who is it? Hi Da-rin, it's uncle. Uncle's here. - Tada! - Wow! You've gotten big, Da-rin. Haven't had dinner yet, right? Nope. Shall I treat you to something nice? Yahoo! Uncle's treating us to dinner. That's great. Da-rin, you must be thrilled. Quick, let's change. How have you been? Fine. Da-rin, does it taste good? Yup. That's not polite. You should say "Yes, sir." Yes, sir. - Good, eat plenty. - Yes. Help yourself, Yul-lin. Go ahead and eat a lot. You've lost weight lately. So, nothing wrong these days? No. I kept meaning to visit, but couldn't get around to it. No, we're already indebted to you. Hey, don't say that. Ms. Ji-young comes once in a while, too. Well, that's her job. Da-rin, eat plenty. Okay. You eat this, too. Oh, goodness. You should be careful. You're all wet. It'd be better to leave her with someone at least until she goes to school. Alright, I'll stop. I'm just saying that because you're having a hard time. I'm going to school next year. Right, sis? That's right. Time for Da- rin to go to school. Da-rin is a big girl now. All ready to go to school. Manager Kim... Yes? Can I take a picture? Sure. Da-rin, I'll take a picture of you. Okay. Come over here. I told you not to call me Manager... It makes us feel distant. I'm sorry. I'm taking the picture now. Say "kimchi" One, two, three. How well she sleeps, my Yul-lin! She sleeps so well, my Yul-lin. You look so pretty even in your sleep. Whose daughter could be so pretty? Who are you? Mom. Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim. Yes? You need to resolve this somehow. She's been like that for a month now. This isn't some motel, you know. This is driving me crazy. We can't do anything. You know the circumstances she's in. I took that into consideration which is why I waited a month. Do you know how much this is costing us? I could get fired for this. If I get fired, will you be responsible for my family? What about the police any progress? It's driving us crazy, too. It's not like the hit-and-run culprit will turn himself in. Plus, no one's around there at that hour. Can't do anything without a witness. What does the insurance company say about the kids? Seems they're backed up a few months. They say it'll be tough because of regulations. Bastards. Regulations! Mr. Kim, is it alright to do this? Dad, do you remember this place? Remember what you said when we came here? You said you wanted to live in a place like this later. They said we couldn't bury you because we don't have money. They said to just scatter your ashes. But I said no. I did a good job, huh? Dad. They said mom needs to stay in the hospital a little longer. It might get dull by yourself, but just be a little patient. I'll bring mom here soon. Are you having a good time? Why, do you think I'm a jerk? Because I didn't go when you invited me and just called instead? I just felt like calling. You know what? Never mind. Sorry to bother you. I'll hang up now. Blood temperature Cool or Hot School records I told you to drop by freely, but you only come when I call you. So how's it going lately? With what? Are you having a hard time? I'm okay. What about your sister? Are you still keeping her with you? No, she's at a nursery. It's been a while now. Is that so? Good, that's probably best. It's not like you two are totally separated. Your grades have gone down a bit. They're pretty good at this rate, but try harder. Yes, ma'am. It might be tough and hard right now... But the future's much more important than the present. Understand? And lots of kids don't have parents. Don't let it get you down. Yes, ma'am. Is there anything you'd like to say? Any worries on your mind? No. Alright. Any pain or illnesses? None. Okay, then you can go. Come see me whenever you need to. The door is always open. I lied. But I don't feel sorry about it. Let's do a group blind date tomorrow, OK? Don't want to. Don't want to. Why not?! Why not?! Judt because. Shut up. Quit the games. We're going! I said no. Stop text messaging! Come on, why not?? I won't go if you don't. Please?? If I catch anyone text messaging, you're dead. This is Da- rin's and this is mine. All right! That's good. Da- rin. Huh? You can play by yourself, right? I'll be right back so don't cry and fuss like last time. I won't cry. But can I have some ice cream? Sure. Ready to order? One ice cream, please. One ice cream? Da-rin, I'll be right back. So don't go anywhere. Wait here. Okay, sis. Jae-won! Da-rin. Da-rin. Poor Da-rin, did you wait long? Get up, let's go home. I played by myself like a good girl. And I didn't cry. Really? Such a good girl! Let's go home now. Are you sleepy? Let's go home and sleep tight. Powerful shot, Ju-go. Great. What's gotten into you today? You alright? I don't know. I just feel like... There's something inside me. There she is. Yul-lin! Yes, three years is the limit. But there's no releasing a body early. I know about the regulations, too. But it's been two years, and she really wants this. Please help her. But her body has been donated. We have to use it for a detailed tissue autopsy and take samples. If it's because of the hospital bills... I told you the outstanding bills would be paid in full. Mr. Kim, this isn't a pawnshop. We have regulations for a reason. Young lady. I thought everything was settled, and you held the funeral. Yes, but... I'm sorry but I have nothing more to say. It's out of my hands. I'm sorry, but please understand and go home. Sorry. What shall we do? Looks like it'll be tough. Hello? Hello? Hi, Yul-lin! I see you called. What are you talking about? That's not what I meant. Yeah, good job. What did you say? Sorry, I couldn't hear you. Wait, don't hang up. Hello? Hello? Baek Ju-go Wow, he's cute. His name's Baek Ju-go. Funny name. Yul-lin Yul-lin Hello? It's me, Baek Ju-go. Oh, hi. What are you doing? Know where I am right now? Well, I think it'd be better for you not to be there. I'm not breaking the rules. You didn't say I couldn't come see you. Fool. What are you talking about? I'm the one who called. Is that so? Doesn't your school have after-school classes? Of course we do. You're a slacker. Why does that sound like a compliment to me? Of course it does. Because you're stupid. You've changed cell phones. Huh? Yeah. Not too tired? I'm fine. Are you really okay? Yes. I'll carry your bag for you. That's okay. Let me carry your bag. Hey, you had a camera, too, all along. Stop it! What's with you? Don't. How pretty! Want me to take a picture of you? No don't. Why not? I don't know, just do it later. You know what? Huh? If you really want to take a picture, take one for me when I'm sleeping. When you're sleeping? Yeah, when I'm in a deep sleep. I think I'd like that a lot. You shouldn't say things like that so easily. Hey, what are you referring to? You wanna die? Never mind. Mr. Kim. You're late. Yes, a little. Do you come home this late every day? Da-rin got hurt. What? Where? How bad is it? It's not that serious so don't worry. Yul-lin. What happened to you? You suddenly leave Da-rin with me, and I can't reach you all day. Know how much she cried for you? It's not too late for you to send her to an orphanage. Know how awkward a position this puts Mr. Kim and me in? What is it? I'm sleepy, so hurry up and talk. Okay, I'm trying to... Hey, do you like him? Who? Who else? Your stupid partner, who doesn't have a freakin' clue. Sorry. I'm not talking about you. That group date that we had. Damn it, that's not what was supposed to happen. Then what was? You see... This is so humiliating. To be honest, I liked Ju-go. And? It was too embarrassing to just approach him... So I arranged the group date to try to get with him. This is so frustrating. He freaking said we should all pair up and you two end up together. He probably doesn't like me much. Huh? So don't worry. Then he's available? Stop getting on my nerves and move. I want to lie down. Comfortable? Want me to sing you a lullaby? I'll ring that up for you. The total is 8,600 won. You couldn't stay still before. So happy now that your sister's here, aren't you? Yes, ma'am! You're so peppy! Actually, she cried after fighting with some kids today. What happened? When she's with the other kids, we can't always take care of her. It's hard to do much about what kids say at that age. I hope this doesn't cause a problem with the parents. Sis, my legs hurt. Carry me on your back. You carry me, too. How can I carry you? Why can't you? Oh, silly! Hop on. I'll carry you. You have a message. I waited a long time, last time. Saturday's my birthday, can you come? I hope you can come. Please do. - Ju-go Things that are there but might as well not be. Since no one would know that they're gone. Scissors So where are we going? Just somewhere for some fresh air. I was going to go alone, but then I thought of you. I thought you might like to come along. Ji-young said she'd look after Da-rin so don't worry. You can sleep or listen to music. Do whatever you feel like. Hey! Feel good? The weather's a bit strange. I like it. It's like dreaming. Dreaming... Interesting. Hey! Hey! Is it that pretty? Yes. You like this, you're prettier. / Why do I feel so good when I see you happy? It makes me feel alive. Eat. We've come far, you should eat a lot. Here. And one for me. When are we going back home? Right, home. Please stop drinking. You have to drive. You're right. By the way, Yul-lin... I keep worrying about you and I'm always thinking of you. If you say that I'm out of place, I have nothing to say. Actually, I've seen many kids like you because of my work. I don't feel so sorry for them anymore. But you're strange. You know... You don't seem pitiful, and then sometimes you do. I feel sorry for you. And you're pretty. Like all the others... Ji-hae, Sang-hee... Sang-hee from class three. They graduate, get married, and call to thank me. Yul-lin, maybe you, too... No, never mind. Let's go. I don't know what I'm saying. Waitress! I'm going to the bathroom... Mr. Kim. Why do I feel so dizzy? Waitress... Mr. Kim, are you okay? Mr. Kim. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry, very sorry, Yul-lin. Sit down. I'm sorry. You! I know all about what you've been doing. What can I do? But I can't help my feelings for you. Yul-lin, stay still. Just stay... Don't meet those bastards, just meet me instead. Is it because of money? I'll give you a lot. If it's because of money, I'll give you more. Yul- lin. Yul- lin. Yul- lin Yul- lin... Yul- lin Hello? No, I was just lying down. Why did you choose me that day? At the group date? Yes. Can I tell you the truth? Yeah. Your eyes were like mine. Eyes that sleep well. Does that offend you? No. I was actually just sitting in. What does that mean? I have a favor. Yeah, go ahead. Don't be nice to me. Don't smile, don't text me nor call me. Don't ever come looking for me again. Yul-lin. Good night. Hey. You dummy, get up! I'm hungry! Darn it. What's wrong? I hate you. You're lazy. What time is it? It was ten a long time ago. Really? How'd that happen? Why are you laughing? Huh? It's nothing. Da-rin, are you full now? Yeah, I'm full. I'm sorry I made you go hungry. But Da-rin... Yeah? From now on, when I'm fast asleep, please wait, and let me sleep. Why? Because I'm happiest when I'm sleeping. Happy? Never mind, go ahead and eat. Somebody's here. Who is it? Lee Yul-lin, open the door. How'd you find out where I live? You're always busy, so I came crawling to you instead, okay? Are you drunk? What's wrong with you? It's morning. What are you here making a fuss for? I'm sorry. Hey, I'm really sorry. Are you out of your mind? You make me crazy. You rotten bitch. What have I done? Where did you go with Ju-go? Shit, you acted as if you weren't interested in him. Did you go flirt with him? What did you do? You call yourself a friend? Do you like Ju-go that much? Yeah, I do. So much that I feel like dying. Why? You moron, you sure do work hard at it. Didn't I tell you not to worry? I don't like him. I think he's a jerk. So stop acting like that. You're being a jerk, too. You have your camera, right? Why? What for? What are you doing, you wacko? Now, smile. I said to smile, you moron. You're good at it. You like that, friend? Now go. I have no one. I always end up like this. I don't have anyone who really likes me. Not even my mom and dad. I was more upset because I like you. If you had just told me you liked him from the start... I wouldn't have suffered this much. How long have you lived like this? I thought your family was rich. It doesn't matter. I like you more like this. So you won't meet Ju-go anymore, right? NICE DREAM What's cold and sad on the window shimmers. Standing close without any heat, steaming up with breath... As if tamed, the frozen wings flutter. Rub away and look, rub away and look, but... The pitch dark night ebbs away and pushes back to crash. Water-soaked stars glimmer, studded like gems. Wiping the glass alone at night is a lonely and rapturous feeling. Fine vessels of the lungs torn apart... Ah, you flew away like a mountain bird. That was a good reading. - Bye! - Bye! Have a good time, princess? - Yes. - What did you play? - We played house. - You played house? Bye Good-bye! Bye Da-rin Bye - See you tomorrow. - Bye. Let's go home now. Okay. Ma'am! How much are the cucumbers? What? What? Take out your earphones if you want to hear. Baek Ju-go... Don't text me nor call me, Don't ever come looking for me again. Don't be nice to me. Don't smile. I have a favor to ask. Why did you choose me that day? Yul-lin. Yul-lin. There's something I didn't tell you. I saw you. It was a few hours before we met that day.
