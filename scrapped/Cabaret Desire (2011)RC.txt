payment m this Yes Ok Thanks m tired of having to define myself Sweet or savory black or white friend or lover man or woman dominating or submissive saint or whore Fuck everything having to be labeled and classified It all started last spring when Alex and Alex showed up a few days apart at my bar dont usually get involved with clients but as fate would have it really liked both of them opposite sexes but with the same name Perhaps that is precisely what turned me on After eavesdropping for a while introduced myself and between one drink and another served up my infallible specialty the Kalashnikov Call it plain mischief or just playing the game but the truth is that little shot of vodka with lemon coffee and sugar got them more than a little bit excited It was incredible how well we got on and what great conversations we had It was getting late but wanted to make sure the night would go on further Finally it ended with an exchange of phone numbers emails facebook we were getting it on no doubt Obviously we made another date but this time during daylight hours a sure sign that things were getting serious loved the simultaneous relationship with my two Alexes so easy to repeat scenarios and moments One thing led to another and as you can imagine we ended up having an affair And it was good damn good Two lovers two flavors two smells This intensity lasted for months But all good things must come to an end At least thats what they say Jealousy reared its ugly head And the fact that they both had the same name only made matters worse They both started to ask me uncomfortable questions and began to stop by unannounced at the bar or at my other regular spots Spontaneity They said Controlling thought In the end what had to happen happened One afternoon there we were the three of us nothing to say one another If instead of real life this was a French indie film the three of us would have ended up fucking and living happily ever after as a trio And though that proposal did cross my mind finally decided that it was far better to keep my mouth shut The fight if you can call it that was very civilized Both Alexes were in agreement about one thing Neither wanted things to continue as is So had to choose between them Are you gay or straight they asked me Make up your damn mind Sofia They gave me a few days to think it over how generous Meanwhile they both decided without consulting me that couldnt meet up with either of them Time to reflect they called it So did just that What they failed to understand is that if you put too much pressure on Sofia shes out You lose Now my new love is this beauty Which by the way have named Alex Hello Hello Will you tell us a story d love to How much will that cost Two chips Thank you whats your name My name is Tania Tennessee Pleasure Mine And you m Juan Nice to meet you Juan Are you ready No one man or woman ever fucked with my mother She was the most progressive refined libertine and sensual woman any one had ever seen Her family left her a small inheritance and she used it to become the youngest and most brilliant art historian in the country She was a real revolutionary everything about her from the way she dressed to her paintings and her decision to become a single mother went against the grain and she knew it Her decision to have me alone showed her conviction to the counter culture Everything know came from her my extensive knowledge of modern art my love of chamber music my ability to tell a true Faberge Egg from a forgery in about seconds the writing of Anais Nin and Lawrence to name a few And the simple fact that was regularly eating savoring really fine beluga caviar before my tenth birthday owe it all to her Having her as a mother was fascinating almost delirious at times My life was nothing like my friends For one thing never knew my father There were never any men around She was so discrete almost secretive She was the kind of person who rarely spoke She always used to say You have two ears but just one mouth for a reason You should speak half as much as you listen Her penchant for silence was far from accidental It wasnt just that she was a private person My mother had a lot to keep quiet about In fact her livelihood depended on our ability to keep our mouths shut Few people ever knew about it but my mother was a thief Not a common burglar though she didnt knock off banks or pick pockets or break into rich peoples houses She was an art thief She stole oneofakind pieces from deco jewelry to paintings from the Renaissance and the Modernists And she especially loved incredibly old first editions from her favorite authors There was nothing she couldnt find and acquire Her intelligence and her training in art history made her the best there ever was If she wanted something it was hers There was one thing that made her a legend She never spoke of it but its said that Interpol nearly had her once but the detective handling the case fell in love and they had an affair before she vanished There were always rumors about important men the Director of the Louvre a famous art restorer at the Prado private collectors Curiously enough they all ended with something incredibly valuable missing And more often than not it wasnt even reported to the police But of all her adventures there was one that she considered her masterpiece One story that she told with more vigor pride and excitement than all the others She called it her best work And it was funny because it was never clear just what she had stolen or what made it so special All really know about that particular and in her words ambitious caper is the mark Karl Razmann The famous novelist and playwright who revolutionized the entire world with his experimental works on sexuality seduction and equality of the sexes She had all of his work It comprised almost onefourth of her extensive library She often spoke of him in fact And always with the most sincere and profound intellectual admiration would listen intently trying so hard not to ask questions But always asking too many and causing her to snap out of it and change the subject was always suspicious that it was more than just a simple robbery Especially after Razmann wrote a bestselling novel whose protagonist mysteriously resembled my mother But neither the novel nor my mother ever revealed exactly what precious object she stole from him that day Of course in the end figured it out After years of stalking around the house looking for some hidden object it finally came to me There wasnt any mysterious treasure hiding around the corner As it turned out the thing she stole her greatest work was me Hello m so pleased to introduce you to Simone One of our most exciting poets Please sit down Please Three always thought that when turned d be an adult living the life d always fantasized about The one that was created when we were little girls beautiful home two kids a dog a fulfilling career a handsome and adoring husband Its funny how life plays its course Our white picket fantasies that seem so clear as little girls change and transform as we become more who we truly are As the years pass by my best friends and have lived through many things together Made little pacts to support and pique our every desire Every birthday has become a sort of showcase of sexual playthings few days ago turned And have to confess was intensely curious to know what mischief my friends had dreamed up for me this year Amongst giggles and champagne and that perfect easiness you have with best friends And now the present they pulled out an envelope Inside was a card with a phone number on it Thats it Call this number at pm on Friday was all they said Lips were sealed However after a few glasses of champagne Patrick did let it slip that the other end of this phone line was not completely unknown that by we should all finally get over ourselves and become more ballsy Friday was a mushy mess of excitement and nervousness But called male voice said ll pick you up at in an hour Be ready Dont make me wait Who was that Damn he had a sexy voice But the main question was What the hell was supposed to wear if didnt know where was going or with whom Six outfit changes later and opt for sexy When in doubt heels leather but with a tinge of femininity was just about to lose myself in a little fantasy when the doorbell rang jolting me into reality and causing me to go all weakkneed and school girlish again black motorcycle a blindfold a hard bodied man And oh yes my friends know me oh too well tried to conceal the fact that was so wet practically was sliding off the seat But the bikes vibration wasnt helping this think the driver could feel my legs trembling pressed against his hips The ride could have been minutes or couldnt gauge But by the time we arrived and he told me to go inside was practically dizzy with anticipation This has to be some sort of elaborate ruse ll go in and all my friends will be there for my surprise party hope they invited the guy on the motorcycle If he looks half as good as he felt d be happy Ok surprise party with scantily clad angels or what My friends do know that ve always been curious about that And Patrick did say that needed to become more daring bed in the clouds Ok where are the angels This is strange Did go into the wrong room Am early for my own party Or am just imagining that m seeing the silhouette of a gorgeous man or what Matisse Please tell me this is not a dream How did they manage to convince him ve been on to him for months The only man sexy enough to paralyze me Literally And as if all this wasnt wild enough he actually leans in and whispers to me now we can finally sweat together Now can finally taste that sweat of yours know youve been watching me sweat Now want to make you sweat God he tastes better than could ever imagine Did those bastards pay for him Or how in the world did they lure him here Anyway lucky me yes Heres to being m going to tell you a story But first After minutes of walking in high heels that were too high and too new her feet were killing her God am so uncomfortable And this dress is too short These shoes are ridiculous dont feel right Do really have to try so hard to impress Couldnt just have worn something more me teenage Thats what look like Someone who is dumb enough to go on a date riding
