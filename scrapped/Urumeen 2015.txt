Behave yourself and get on the bike behind you. Hop on. Get down! Come. Go. What's with the look? Go on. Get going. Who spoke to me on the phone? John. John Christopher. On this cold night, my motor bike that was burnt, the phone call that followed, his name, and this room. I'm sure none of this is related to me. My name is Selva. I'm from Madurai. The only thing I lacked back then. A job. JOB Just One Break. The education that has left me unemployed is B.E (Bachelor in Engineering). I completed that useless course and couldn't find the right job. So I came to Chennai. My first identity in Chennai is this Tea stall. Hey, can I get some water? Hey! Can I get some water?! Why are you asking him? Here. One tea. In a glass. Do you want tea? Coffee. One strong coffee. I prefer it light. Did you hear that? Sir, coffee. Sir, your name? Name? Bill Gates. Selva. Hey, Sudha. - Greetings. - How are you? This is our room. The man you saw downstairs is the landlord. A good man. Come in. We have no troubles. Kids in the neighbourhood play cricket and it gets in. I keep it, so that we can play too. May I come in? Just get in. I've told you about him, he's Selva. - Schoolmate. - Hello. - He has done B.E. He's here for an interview. This is Venkat. He's a medical rep. - Okay. - We're in the same field. Can we share it? Don't irritate me. All this drinking will make you impotent. In such a short time I couldn't get the right job here. Can we have tea? We have work, you go drink. Are you trying to say I'm jobless? B.E. A job that matches your education right? I only completed school. They called me a driver. After I joined the Ambulance service they call me a Pilot. My life changed in a day. Go out in the street and scream. Ask people if they studied B.E. Half of them would have. So many advises and hobbies, so many faces and so many experiences. Despite all this, finally in an interview, I reached the final round. - Do you want some tea? - Boost. Boost. A boost as well. So? What is the headline? The value of the Indian Rupee has dropped. Economical graph down. Here's the boost. Sir can drink boost only I suppose. Give it. Sir, boost. Sir, what do you do for lunch? I have two more idiots like you. They take care of it. Sarcastic much. Hey I'll drop you. We need to go to Velachery, quick. Bye sir. - Okay bro, good luck. - Bye. Get going. Another American slave. I knew, that they would do this. It was the same last time. They promised a job and took 60,000 as fees for the course. And then they gave 5,000 every month from that money and ran away. This is how they fool the people from rural areas. This is just to get our attention. They said they needed 47 people. They selected only 3 of them. And they happened to be women, are we fools? That damn bald HR! If I get a hold of him I'll thrash him! So when are you joining? Hey! Damn! I'm good. It's just about a girl. I'll handle it. Yeah, sure. Okay. How much? Make sure you give it to the driver. Sir, do you need to go to the hospital? God! I'll never drink again. Who asked you to? Watch yourself! If you break the heads of HRs there won't be one to recruit you. Thank you sir. You didn't drink? You finished it all. We're just about to start. The entire building got burnt? Didn't you watch the news? The entire building! The media was there as well. It was full of papers. Hence it caught fire quickly. I'm selling whatever was left from that building. What's in the bucket? Oh that! I was told that it was an old book. It was on fire. I didn't want the other books to burn. Hence I put it in water. And the cover is made of leather. So I just put it in water. Including that take 2,000 rupees. Here. Sir, you're paying me less. That itself is a lot. Keep it. Do visit again. That's why I've reduced the price. White phosphorous. Interesting. I'm talking to you. What's with you and books? I wonder what you made out of this lending library. I guess it's my fate. My name is John Christopher. A few years back, in Chennai, My only identity was unimaginably a tea stall. Tea. TEA Total Earth Addiction. For an ordinary Indian, Tea is like blood. In short it's the blood of the low class. In the history of our country, a recurring object, is this tea. The tea I served from that tea stall introduced me to Mr. Rajagopal. Rajagopal. He's the senior manager in the loan section of a private bank. I was often in his line of sight. He needed an agent to collect the loans. I became that agent. Madam, Suresh? Who is this? I resigned my job. I'll settle it in 2 months. The coffee is really hot. The baby.. is in my hands. John! You have 30 minutes. - You settle the entire loan. - How can I setttle all of a sudden? She has a lot of jewels. Go to the pawn broker and get the money. - Okay John. - Go! - With these small jobs.. I somehow managed to start a full fledged agency. The loans that the bank deem are impossible to retrieve is our target. Apart from that, many loans that the bank rejects were influenced by our agency for approval. Our job is to not just to collect loans. If it isn't paid back, the first to be at your doorstep will be us. This growth of mine is not just because of me. My friend in the police force Sasi. My brother Solomon as my right hand. And along with lawyer Seeni, it was a formidable team. I can't forget 2 things in this whole world. One is money. And the other one is tea. These 2 things.. turned my mind as their unquestioning slave. Son Yes Ma'am. Sir is not feeling well. We're going to Mysore for 3 months for his treatment. This was the last book that he so fondly bought. There's no space at home or at the shop. It would be nice if you could keep them all in your house. It is his request. Sure ma'am why not, we'll take it upstairs. Take care of him. - Okay son. - Convey my regards. Take it. I have been repeatedly telling you that I don't have. Please go. Let's go. - You're going to be alone, take care - I will. What a city! There are the frauds. There are the helpful ones too. My life has changed in one day. You still have much to see. Go. Bye. If there's a day that I wouldn't forget. It was that day. I remember well. It was a full moon day. Congratulations for all the selected ones. Listen carefully. These ten 'sevens' are going to be life changing ones. Repeat my words. Seven. - Seven.. Seven. - Seven.. Seven - Seven.. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Good morning. Hello, is Reddy here? He's waiting. 5 minutes. Reddy. Let's go. Sir, tea. John No matter how big you are You don't seem to let go of tea. Sir You must not forget the past. You must always remember it. In some way. Alright What's up with that Reddy? The bank audit is coming up. I have to close the file. Try to conclude it before that. And the Press. They're writing gossips about us. He's here. I'll let you know. - Please wait. - Sure. What's up bro? It must have been boring without us. And bro, a good news. I almost forgot. I met a friend's friend. Her name is Jennifer. Their company is recruiting. She'll let me know. I'll give you her number. Call her after 10. Okay? Hey, take down the number. Is this the age for origami? All the best bro. Don't fret over it. It's okay to do whatever job you get. Hey Hey Hey! Just Ask Which floor is Just Ask in? 2nd block? 3rd floor? Thanks man. Thanks again. - Hello. - It's okay, sit. All set for the interview. - Okay. - Just attend the interview. I'll take care of the rest. - Thanks. - Adi.. You will guide Selva. We'll meet in the evening. - All the best. - Thank you. Damn these people and the 'target'! Hello sir. Thank you sir. My name is Selvakumar. I studied B.E in Coimbatore. I'm from Madurai, I'm staying here in R.A. Puram. I knew about the interview through Jennifer.. Thank you sir. You're wondering why he was mute right? It's nothing. It's the effect of what you did to that HR. He's been silent ever since. He hasn't uttered a word. Good morning everybody. I'm going to be your team leader.. Good morning sir. God! What happened? He's my college senior, Selva. An insult! My junior! And she's.. the team leader! How can I..? He's a hothead. But he was everyone's favourite senior. Especially the girls'. But he can't face girls. He's quite silent. So much that you can only hear him breathe. You said it was your treat and asked me to get here quickly. But I don't have any money with me. You are my everything. - Why did you not take this batch? - I just can't. I'll train another batch. No. No chance. Dear Lord I will face my enemies. Save me from friends like this. Save me. Sudha I do like her. No, no. I don't bro. I don't. Bro, I tell you now. I swear on this alcohol. I won't go that job again. I won't. I don't care even if I starve. I won't go. I won't. I won't go. Hey! Get me another drink! Today's fasting is done. How come you're here? I thought you swore yesterday. That you would never come back here. I was drunk. How do I eat today? I have a doubt. She changed her batch because of him. And he is scared of her. What's going on? Complete the training and get to work. A good job. Umayal again. And friends. My life was on a good note. Bro I don't think she's right for you. She's just fine. It's not that. For your looks.. He literally gets scared. It will come. Else we will get loan. Sir Someone is here with Shanmuganathan to meet you. Do I ask them to come in? - Yes. He's a good friend. He's in the granite business. In order to apply a loan we met Rajagopal sir at the bank. There's some problem with the papers. He asked me to meet you. It's very simple. I'll get you the loan. My commission is 15% from the total amount. plus The land you pledge, will be mine. After you settle the loan, it's your's. That's it. If that's okay with you, I can move for it tomorrow. The commission is a bit high. - Shut up. - And we're pledging the land to the bank. Shanmuganathan. You have 1000 rupees. All in coins. And when you give it in a hotel.. you get a 100 rupee commission. And for 1 lakh? 10, 000 rupees. 10% interest. - Which bank will give you? - No one. What Shanmuganathan? Retired bus conductor. You're doing that business right? - Yes. Tell him. How many holes? Have we filled? - I'll talk later. - Sir, please.. - Shanmuganathan! - Sorry we'll come later. - Thank you sir. Bro, shall we drink brandy or whiskey? Damn! Madam. He's calling you. No he's just kidding, you carry on. I'm sure he called you. No, he's just kidding. Hey! - He will call you. - No, please go. You are totally unfit. A boy can have a thousand reasons to like a girl. But I have only one reason. Her name. Umayal. Hey Umayal.. Don't let me go. The sight of you kills my heart. Hey Umayal.. Don't let me go. The sight of you kills my heart. A sweet coincidence is all it took. Your lightning struck me. You make me suffer like those dreaded rains. Hey Umayal.. Don't let me go. The sight of you kills my heart. Hey Umayal.. Don't let me go. The sight of you kills my heart. My heart melts. My days are dark. Even the scintillating music sounds otherwise. I've no track of time. I've had no sleep. All this in just a short span. I walk yearning for your touch. What have you done to me? A pinch of love, a pinch of silence, I'm dissolved in. Hey Umayal.. Don't let me go. The sight of you kills my heart. Hey Umayal.. Don't let me go. The sight of you kills my heart. Reddy Sir! Have you filed a police complaint? Good. I hear that the evidence is strong. What did I ask for? No, no. What did you ask for? For business, a loan of 5 crore rupees. Did I get you that? Most of the documents were improper. But I did it because the property was genuine. Alright You took the loan. Did you do business? That is.. You didn't Alright. That is your problem. When asked to return the loan.. You said there was a business loss. Even that is fine. Now, the bank has sent your file to my agency. We're only asking for half the money. Use your property to settle it. In this normal process, Why did you involve the police? Police! Tell him. Reddy sir The police are your friend. But you've misunderstood it. You gave this evidence at the commissioner's office right? Make sure if it's the same. We've managed to get a hold of you. We have a network too. Why do you need this unnecessary trouble? We know that you had the evidence. And that you bought one of us. You even tried to sell your property to someone. Keep your forward thinking aside and just sign the papers. Sir I'm a bad guy. But I have my ethics. It has always stimulated my growth. Everyone here knows that. They should. Those who don't.. John! You gave him the footage? Die! Water. Kill him. Why are you thinking? He may be your friend. He betrayed me. Kill him. Kill him! - Shanmuganathan. - Sir? Do you have change? No. Welcome to JustAsk.com This is Selva. How may I help you today? Sir, Dileepan reporting from Triplicane. Just one. - Hello? Gun shoot, sir. Bike No. TN-22.. BA- 5173.. - Hello? 5173, sir. As per my enquiry, the guy isn't from this locality. Sir, public has already called the ambulance. I'm following the ambulance. TN-22.. BA- 5173.. That's all, sir. Hello? Good morning! Sir The cab is out of service. You have to take your own cab. Okay, bye. Hello? Where? I can't hear you. Say it again. Triplicane Nagathamman Temple street? Okay I'll come. I'm on my way, wait. Hey I'm going to the same area. There's no bus for now, can you drop me? - Okay, sit. - Thank you. I'm going this side. You? That's okay, my room is nearby. Thank you. Hey! Come on. - Come one. - Quick. A traitor! Who is it? - I don't know. Sir, Dileepan reporting from Triplicane. Just one. Bike No. TN-22.. BA- 5173.. I'm following the ambulance. TN-22.. BA- 5173.. That's all, sir. Wake up! That's enough, wake up. Are you gonna wake up or not? Wake up! Am I stupid or what? Dude, overtake him. Don't let him go. He's nothing, corner him. Catch up to him. Catch up. Overtake him! Sasi. Slow down. Let's see if he goes away. Be normal, Sasi. Sasi, hit the brakes and pull over to the left. Hey, wait! Who are you? Why can't he let go of it? In big libraries to protect precious books from theft, they use white phosphorous on it for safety. In case of any mishap, the moisture in phosphorous reduces. So it either catches fire or emits smoke. That's the reason Selva. Given the incidents you've encountered, I have two conclusions. One It could be your imagination. We call it an illusion. Two It could be the work of a soul that is related to you. It must be a lovable soul. Sir, maybe this is a ghost? A ghost? We call it "The travel of a soul without a vessel." Selva, we are alive and we're interacting with each other. Just like this those without a body have a purpose. But at midnight, exactly at 12:15 for 29 seconds this book provides you everything you need. So There's something that is in sync with your brain's wavelengths in this book. Listen carefully. Repeat my words. Seven. - Seven.. Sir.. Bike No. TN-22.. BA- 5173.. 5173, sir. I'm not scared of this. In fact, it has helped me. It isn't normal. Just a doubt. I wanted to know the reason. If you need an exact definition, this is something that has a strong connection to you. According to me this is a book. Bundle of papers. That's all. How could this call me through the phone? I just don't get it. The elements of nature has an unspoken power. These souls use a medium to function. Like water, land, fire and air. Good or bad. These 29 seconds are your greatest gift. Someone dies every hour. Next will be either of you. We should decide our enemy and our death. Only then we can survive. That day suddenly, Umayal.. wanted to meet all of us. What is it? I had taken a personal loan 4 months back. When taking my signatures in the form, they deceived me and kept some credit card papers inside. They took a card in my name and used 1.5 lakhs. When I asked the bank they said he quit his job. And now, a private agency has been calling me for the credit card payment for 10 days. I went to ask permission to make EMI payments. I can understand your problem Umayal. What's your full name? Umayal Nandhini Nandhini? Good. Umayal is very hard to use. I just took your case. I'll talk to the bank. - Okay, thank you. - Anyway - Nice meeting you. - Thank you sir. 2 days later He came to visit me. Nandhini, I spoke to the bank. You can return it when you can. Your comfortable date and time. Thanks sir, but the amount is ready. I'll give it tomorrow. Oh, good. Nandhini, Can I ask you something? Sorry sir, but I'm already committed. Please. Despite that he keeps calling and sending messages. I have my UPSC exam next week in Bangalore. It's been my life's ambition. With his trouble, I'm not able to concentrate. I could have gone to the police. But I don't have the courage. I couldn't hide it from you guys anymore. That's why.. Give me his number. Come on.. Start the car. Who is it?! Holiday tomorrow? Sir? 7 days before they tried to kill me. Now They've killed my brother. It could be you next. Someone's messing with us. If it was 1 or 2 we could investigate. We're handling 30-40 cases. We have no clue who the enemy could be. John. Reddy was our last case. Maybe it was him? I traced 30 numbers in Solomon's call history. 4 of those numbers are still not reachable. I've been able to communicate with the rest. The footage from the camera we put up in the car after the accident is here. Let's see if we get something from it. Sir. After verifying the footage it is clear that for the past 2-3 days 2 characters are recurring. A white Omni van registration number TN-23-2235 And an Enfield Bullet TSA 5559 But face recognition was not possible. But this has been planned and executed. The fear is gone! For us. Everything was fine until we had fear. We have intensely messed up someone. Kill everyone. Whoever you get, kill them slowly and savour it. Only then whoever did it will reveal himself. Why did they bring you here? Someone killed his brother. Damn womaniser! On suspicion I've been brought here. I killed his brother. I'm from Tirunelveli. My father, mom and my sister. We were a beautiful family. I was a cab driver in Chennai. My sister was doing her 12th grade. She wanted to study in Chennai. We got a seat through counselling. Some bio-medical. First year we somehow managed to pay the fees. But not the 2nd year. With some help from close friends I took a loan. The bank told me we could settle it after she finished the course. She said she would pay it herself. I was very proud of my sister. Everything was fine. Suddenly one day I was notified from her hostel that she had committed suicide. We were devastated. We were devastated. My sister is not a coward who commits suicide. I investigated it. That damn bastard. The one I burnt. Him. He met her regarding the loan several times. He seduced her and spoiled her life. With these rich people justice isn't an option. That's why I decided to kill them separately. In the highway I had it all planned out. Had he died that day, I would have paid a fine for brake failure and got away. The bastard, he escaped. Then his brother was caught alone. I burnt him. He was burnt to death. It felt so good. They found out somehow and caught me. We must escape from here. First let's figure out how to untie ourselves. Wish you merry Christmas. God bless you my child. Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way. Wish you merry Christmas. - Thank you. Jingle all the way. Hello Hello? Hello Hello? What happened? Hello Hello? What happened John? Hello. - Aadhi, this is Selva. Where are you? Your number is not reachable since yesterday. None knows about your whereabouts. Don't ask me any questios now. Just listen to me. I had an old diary resembling a book. Can you look in to it, please? Hello. - Where are you? - On the way to hostel. Pack everything and be ready. A small surprise. I'm on the way. - Okay. Hello. - Jenni, this is Selva. Don't leave the office till I ask you to leave. Okay? Don't leave the office till I ask you. - Okay.. One tea.- In the case of ISBC Bank's Industrial credit.. ..It's manger, Mr. Rajagopal was arrested in the noon by Central Anti-Corruption Bureau. He has been alleged for misusing the unpaid loan... by hacking the software since 6 months and mishandling about 10 crores Rupees. In this same case.. - No money.. Cancel the order. It's okay. Have it. Police are refraining to clarify. Since the bank is not giving any...- Thanks. Who is this? Hello! Hello, Sudha.. - Hello... Tell me, dude. - Hello.. Sudha, this is Selva.

Come, get it. - Check if everyone has their phone. - Okay, sir. - Did you get everyone's phone? - Yes. One phone is missing. - Whose? - The blue shirt. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Tell me, John. Are you feeling great that you escaped? What do you think? Heroism? I'm not sure if you are connected to this or not. You killed my men, didn't you? I will avenge you. It will be a brutal death. Hey!! You are no God to decide my death. I'm not the person to die to clarify your doubt. Im not sure whether it's a long lasting feud. But I'm getting furious listening to you. Yes, I'm feeling the same way. Your voice is getting me enraged. You should not dictate the terms. I will. The moment I see you will be your last moment. No matter where you are. You will be dead before dawn. - Let's see. - Let's see. He has to pass this route to reach his room. Today is his end. Come soon. We have reached. Yes it's him. Wait! Our boys are on the way. Give me a water bottle. He is running away. He must die this time. If I get to catch you.. - Come on.. - Catch him. - Don't let him escape. - Kill him. Move.. - Hello. - I got the book. Hello.. - You moron. - Selva! - Are you on the line? - You are caught. Did you think of escaping? You are trapped. You are dead. Dude, call him. What is he doing here? - Hello. - Sir. He is caught. Give me 10 minutes. I will bring his head. He must not escape at any cost. He can't escape. You come here. Move faster. - Move aside. - Get lost. Hey, you.. What are you doing at this hour? That too with these guys? Park the vehicle aside. - What happened? - Park the vehicle aside. Tell me. Abuse them badly. Let's settle the dispute amicably. - Why abuse? - Start. - I mean... - Abuse.. - Okay, let me deal. - Okay. Please forgive me, Jesus. You moron. Senseless idiots. Dare to touch him. Is it okay, dude? - Why aren't you saying anything? - Hey, fatso. - Don't move. - Did he get me into trouble? - Come soon. - I'm dead. All towns are one. All men our kin. Man's pains and pain's relief are from within. Death's no new thing... nor do our blossoms thrill. When joyous life seems like a luscious drought... When grieved, we patient suffer; for, we deem. Tho' storms with lightning's flash from darkened skies... Borne down the waters of some mountain stream... That o'er huge boulders roaring seeks the plain. Borne down the waters of some mountain stream... That o'er huge boulders roaring seeks the plain.. Descend, the raft goes on as fates ordain. Thus have we seen in visions of the wise! We marvel not at the greatness of the great... Still less despise we men of low estate. All towns are one. All men our kin. Man's pains and pain's relief are from within. Death's no new thing... nor do our blossoms thrill. Borne down the waters of some mountain stream.. that o'er huge boulders roaring seeks the plain.

All men our kin. 'Man's pains and pain's relief are from within.' Go to hell. Hang the phone. I will deal it myself. Did you track his number, Sasi? John, he is traveling in the same path as you. He is on the Mount road area. We can catch him nearby. Can we catch him there for sure? - No.. We will definitely get a spot. We can plan it over there. When are you coming? - John, you keep moving. I'll track his number and I will catch you later. Based on the incidents that are happening around me.. One thing is clear. Something is unsettled. Ancestors.. Past life.. Does it have any such connections? May be. May be you are the one. Some incident. Based on this incident... This incident and.. 1400 gms of brain have a close connection. So.. This book has the power of traveling with your thoughts. Once the heart beat stops.. time taken by blood to.. coagulate is.. 29 seconds. It's an interesting connectivity. Greetings, sir. - Greetings. Sir. - Pass it. Next.. Next.. - You got a letter from the company. So, I hurried down here. Hey, come here. - Sir. - Lord Robert is coming. - Okay, sir. I guess he is coming to rest. Take the key and clean the bungalow. - Definitely. - Hey. Sir. - Take one more fellow with you.- Okay. Why are you scratching your head? My younger daughter has attained puberty. If you can get me a loan of Rs.50.. I'll pay it back in 6 months. Meet me tomorrow. I have things to work. You can leave. Next.. It's company's money. Why is he refraining as if it's his. Greetings, my Lord. Stop there.- Run.. Play somewhere else. Welcome.. - Then, Kangaani. - Yes. I need to go for hunting. - Make the arrangements. - Yes.. I will. I need a guide who knows the forest well. A servant. And most importantly, a translator. Okay, sir. Make the arrangements. Be fast. Bring it fast. Greetings. Why are you worried? He wants a translator. I'm a bit confused. The one who visits the bungalow. His name is Chezhiyan. He is tough to manage. Kumarasamy's son, Krishnan. They are thick friends. He will never say no to him. Krishnan or Chezhiyan? I'm not sure. I'm confused. The 50 Rs. I asked for? Mom, I'm hungry. Can I get some food? As if you are getting late for the job. Can't you pluck the leaves in the estate instead being idle? It's better to stay here than doing that. Do want me to die sick? We grew up in this forest. Now it belongs to them. Stop quoting. Look at our condition. Your father has joined the freedom movement. But you are just gaining weight. Nothing else. They are destroying the forest. I'm not getting involved in it. I grew up eating the natural food. Do you want to me to suffer eating free bread? I can't take medicine. Food is medicine. Healthy body is a sound body. You have good oratory skill. Do I? Then give me 2 annas. Mom! Kangaani is calling. What? Why is he calling me? Might be to get his money back. Come, Nair. Is your dad, good? - He is okay. The estate's inventory is unchecked because of his absence. He will resume his work in 2 days. The reason I called you is.. - Sir.. Lord Robert has come from Madras. He wants to go for hunting. Only you and Vidudhalai have a good knowledge about forest. Chezhiyan will come only if you request. He is a bit unpredictable. Take care. Okay, sir. If you can send me to the Kozhikode Tea estate auction I'll learn the business tricks. I will get some contacts. My family can't survive on dad's income alone. I gave a little prideful speech. But I'm feeling hungry. Can't you come soon? For which Congress movement is your father gathering people? He will be thrashed to death. English appointed you to maintain the accounts. But you have dishonored the women and the country. - Did I question about it? - What are you murmuring about? I was thinking about your stature. Tomorrow, be at the bungalow. - Okay, sir. I have passed the information to Chezhiyan's mother. - Advise him. - Okay, sir. - Leave. - Bye, sir. Greetings. - Greetings. Next one has come to plead. Kangaani. The money... Ragu, mom passed me the message. Should I come for sure? - Actually.. I studied law. I'm not known for my patience. My mom has taken loan. That puts me in the state of dilemma. - We are in the same state as well. - Hey. I couldn't say no. I will just mind my business. I can't address him like my boss. I can't fall on his feet. Got it? Dominating us in our very own place? White pigs! Good times are approaching. Think about mom. Your ancestors lead a wealthy life. We can just regret. We are like an animal attacked by a snake. It's we who gets into trouble. It's because of this dividedness we are in this position. When we stand united then comes the good fortune. Greetings, sir. - Greetings! He is a short tempered guy.

Son of all purpose flour. Edible food must sink in water. It's floating like a boat. It's too bad for digestion. - Pass it. Enough. Nair, tea is awesome. Is it? Then give me 2 annas. Can you get it? You are smart. - Hey, go and take that. - Yes. Why are you laughing? Come on.. - I thought it was a tiger(Puli). - What? I thought it is a tiger. - But you shot a rabbit. - Hey mind it. Last trip, I shot around 7 tigers. You know that? For your information. I guess it's about to rain. Shall we make a move? Everyone. Move. I'll make sure that I will shoot a tiger within 24 hours. Just, you watch. Since the last 25 years.. they dwindled the number of tigers from 48,000 to 14,000. You can kill the tigers. But you can't destroy it as a whole. Which tiger are you referring to? We have to travel a fair distance. Let's move. Hey, man. Come. - Lord! - Let's have a play. No.. Then call your friend. Chezhiya! Sir wishes to play a game. It's we who invented it.

Sasi, I'm in the place that you mentioned. John, that's the spot. Is Metro work under progress there? - Yes. His number is stable there since a long time. Go and look in the subway. There are more chances of meeting him there. For safety purpose, I have sent his photo. Try to identify. Okay. - I will reach the spot in 5 minutes. Okay, Sasi. - Also it's an one way closed subway.
