Pull over! [###] [CRYING] We have had a healthy baby boy. [###] [BABY CRYING] [###] [BABY CRYING] MAN: Let Ray's life be a lesson. The fever still threatens but will not harm us if we live according to God's law. ALL: Solidarity and steadfastness. We are the union of the divine and shall cherish equilibrium and peace. Let us pray. [GIRL CRYING] Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. GIRL: I want him back. PRIEST: Thou preparest a table before me Amanda. This didn't have to happen! Can't you see? It's all a lie. Poor girl. You're ill. You need help. I'm not sick! Amanda. She'll be fine. The doctor will take care of her. All right. That's all right. It's all right. It's gonna be okay. [ROB WRIGLEY'S "ANGELS SO BEAUTIFUL" PLAYS] [GIGGLING] [ROB WRIGLEY'S "ANGELS SO BEAUTIFUL" PLAYS ON RADIO] MAN [ON RADIO]: Just before the Civil War, there was a mission of... [BLUEGRASS MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO] [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO] [###] Get you some gas? Uh, no, thanks, but maybe you can help me. I'm a little lost. I'm looking for Rockwell Falls. I know I'm close. I must've missed a turn. Huh. According to my map... Well, Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore. [###] [WHINNYING] [TIRE BURSTS] Damn. [COURTNEY GROANING] You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Looks like you're not. You got a couple flats. Yeah. No reception. I think I could use some help. I can't help you. I suggest heading back to Bromine. It's the last town that you passed. That's 50 miles back. If I was you, I'd start walking. [###] Afternoon. Howdy. Looks like I need some help. I have a couple of flat tires. That's quite a pothole back there. No problem. I'll call you a tow truck from Bromine. No, actually, I need to get to Rockwell Falls. I'm with the Census Bureau on assignment. Steve Kady. Hold on a second. Let me see what I can do. [###] Sheriff, we got a guy with a couple flats inside the line. MAN: You know what to do, deputy. Yeah, well, he's with the Census Bureau. We'll meet you at the mayor's. Come on, deputy. So put on your happy face. We'll go join the welcome wagon. Mr. Kady, Deputy Bobby Caine. Sorry, we don't get too many visitors around here. When we do, it's like the Second Coming. Come on, I'll give you a lift. Grab your suitcase. Is my car gonna be all right? Tow truck will be by here in a bit. Don't worry about your things. We're real honest around here. There's never any crime in Rockwell Falls. Must be nice. [###] You ever worry about a collision? CAINE: Except for a few delivery trucks, no one goes in the other direction. No reason to. Everything we need is right here. [###] [LAUGHING] STEVE: Where are we headed? CAINE: To meet the mayor. There's no motel in town, but he'll know where to put you up. [###] [BARKING] What's with the dogs? Man's best friend. You can never have too many friends in this town. Welcome. Welcome. Mayor Gus Grateman. Sheriff Jim Calcutt and Deputy Christian Hecker. Steve Kady. Nice to meet you. What brings you to town, Mr. Kady? Surveys for the Census Bureau. Updating our computers in Washington. Shouldn't be more than a few days. I hope it's not too much trouble. No. No trouble at all. Stay as long as you like. Enjoy everything our little town has to offer. And if you need anything, you just ask. It would help to have access to the old census surveys. Well, Harmony Evans keeps track of the records. I'll arrange it for you to drop by any time. Bobby, why don't we take Mr. Kady here over to Belma's. She's sure to take good care of you. All right. OBIE: Sheriff. It's Wanda Syde. Woke up with marks on her. She's real sick. We're headed that way. Just a slight detour, Mr. Kady. Only be a few minutes. [###] GRATEMAN: We'll be right back, Mr. Kady. [###] MAN: This ain't no coincidence. [###] Mr. Kady. Mrs. Syde just came down with a bad set of boils. She'll be fine soon enough. Deputy Caine will take you up to Belma's now. Oh, Mr. Kady, one more thing. Our traditions are very important in the community. Do your best to mind them. Of course. [###] Belma's got a daughter, mind you. I'm gonna marry her one day. Congratulations. And it's not true what they say about the mother-daughter thing either. Bobby. You must be Mr. Kady. Nice to meet you. News travels fast in this town. It doesn't have far to go. Come in, come in. It's not fancy, but it's filled with TLC. It's beautiful. BELMA: Wait till you see the garden. Hey. I thought I told you to keep walking. CAINE: Courtney, this is Mr. Kady from Chicago. He's in town for some overnight business. I know. We've met. Sort of. [###] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Gentlemen. I take it you know that we have a friend from the Census Bureau staying at the Lovett's till we can find something more permanent. He's very nice, so do your best to make him feel at home. [###] Henry, it's your wife, Ruby. [CLAPPING] All right, it's done. Ruby is our new festival host. And if you haven't done so already, remember to stop your clocks. [###] ALL: Solidarity and steadfastness. We are the union of the divine, and we shall cherish equilibrium and peace. Thank you, gentlemen. BELMA: Smile. That's a good one. I don't know how anyone can look at numbers all day. Well, if you look at them as just numbers, I guess it can get pretty dry. But the numbers I work with, they represent people. They reveal the world they live in, and what their community has, what it needs. You'd be surprised how much you can learn from numbers. I mean, they are the only thing in life that always make sense. Like Pythagoras says, "Numbers rule the universe." BELMA: You speak the truth, Mr. Kady. I'm just surprised such a smart man like yourself is still without a family. But that will change soon, I'm sure. There is nothing more important around here. Gosh, it's been 12 summers since our Lyle passed. I'm just sorry that Courtney didn't get to spend more time with him. Died from the fever. And he was as strong as an ox. And no one saw it coming. Thank you. [###] [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to surprise you. I couldn't sleep. Yeah, I couldn't either. Let me make you something. I was sorry to hear about your father. Were you close? Yes. Very. What about you? You lost someone. I saw it in your eyes at dinnertime. Mm. My wife and daughter. They died in an accident two years ago. Oh, my God. You must miss them very much. Sorry. Well, um... This is gonna help you sleep tonight. Thank you. You know, it could use a little more garlic. [###] Good morning, Mr. Kady. Morning. Careful, Mr. Kady! Morning, Mr. Kady. [###] Wow, that's the low-cal special? [CHUCKLING] What's the fuss? Ruby Flynn was picked last night to be festival host. It's, like, the biggest honor anyone can have. You ever been chosen? No. Someday maybe, but hopefully I won't be around. What's Chicago like, Steve? You've never been? No. I've never been anywhere. The weather's rough. The four seasons are winter, winter, winter and the Fourth of July. But when the snow is blowing horizontally across the Michigan Avenue Bridge, you can slip into these little bars, Courtney? Hear the most amazing jazz... I'm really sorry. I have to get back to work. [###] How's it going, Mr. Kady? All right. You know, my office thought there was an error. I still have a lot to go, but the first two list the population at exactly 436. Does that sound right to you? Everything tends to stay the same around here. Like Pythagoras said, "Numbers rule the universe." I ran into Belma. She told me what you said at dinner. And I thought it was pretty. Uh, Harmony. One more question. In this final survey I have the Hillenbock family of four. Do you know where they live? That poor family. They fell ill, but they're doing much better now. Oh. That's great. Do you know where I can find them? You'll have to ask the mayor. So you don't know? A family can't go missing in a town this size, can it? You'll have to ask the mayor. I'll have to ask the mayor. Ah... Ah... Wonderful. Why won't anyone give me a straight answer? Well, where they're staying really isn't fit for a family. And knowing Mac, he wouldn't take kindly to visitors. Matter of pride. You understand that, don't you? You understand, mayor, I'm gonna have to interview these people. Well, you can interview them after the festival. Very sweet people. And the missus, she makes the best blueberry muffins this side of the Mississippi. Relax, Mr. Kady. Have some apple pie. You have plenty of time for working. People, you'd think this was the first festival we ever had. [###] CAINE: So, how'd it go today? STEVE: Good. Yeah, everyone was really friendly. CAINE: You know what they say. Welcome all newcomers as family and they become family. They don't say that in Chicago. [###] [CROWD SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [###] To Steve-O. Our new friend. And to Rockwell Falls. The most perfect place on earth. ALL: All right. Aames and his brother Kip make this fine whiskey themselves. Smooth. [STEVE CLEARING THROAT] Attaboy. [###] I'll get rid of them boils. [###] [GASPS] GREAVER: We're gonna help you through this, Amanda. No. I just had a bad dream. That's how the fever always starts. You're coming face to face with your own death. Our treatment is the only way No! No, please! Stop it! To keep you from getting worse. No! Please, no! What was that? This old town's got some electrical problems. Don't worry about it. Just something we live with. [###] SYDE: Out of the way, deputy. I can't do that. What's on your mind, Farmer? We were fine, just fine, until he came along. Come on, now. We welcome all newcomers like family, remember? It's the prophecy. Don't take another step. I'll kill you. I swear. You're not gonna do that. Hand me the gun. Go on home. I'll hold on to this for you. I thought there wasn't ever any crime in Rockwell Falls. He wasn't gonna shoot. His wife's sick and he's temporarily lost his senses. Besides, he's a lousy shot. Well, he didn't have to be great. He was 10 feet away. What was all that about anyway? What prophecy? Just some local superstition. Trust me, Steve, he wasn't gonna shoot. There's never been a murder in Rockwell Falls. Never. Well, statistically speaking, you're due. [WHIRRING] [###] I'm 51, born here like most, never married and no children. That is about it. Ever skinned an apple, Mr. Kady? No, I can't say that I have. Take this and, gently, with your thumb near the blade, in a circular motion... I have a listing for your neighbor, Ray Jacobs, and his daughter Amanda. Do you know where I can reach them? Oh, dear. I'm afraid Ray is not coming back. He passed away a couple of days ago. Terrible car accident. Was his daughter in the accident? No, thank the Lord. But that doesn't mean she isn't hurting. Though the good doctor is doing everything he can. Well, it's not quite as good as yours but... Very nice. All right. Please, take one for the road. Oh, thank you very much. And thanks for your cooperation. If everyone's as quick as you, I'll be out of here in a couple days. Oh, I doubt it, Mr. Kady. Have a nice day. [###] CHILDREN: Solidarity and steadfastness. We are the union of the divine, and we shall cherish equilibrium and peace. WOMAN: Very good. And who would like to lead us in the holy words as they were passed down? [###] [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGU AGE] [###] Easy, Steve-O, it's just me. I didn't mean to scare you. Just came to give you the good news. Farmer's wife is fine. She just had some spoiled milk and he wanted me to pass on his apologies. Well, that's good news. Thanks. So where you headed? Oh, the Greaver residence. I'll give you a ride. Oh, no. Ms. Dresden was just teaching the kids a little local history as it was laid down by Seymour Grateman. Well, it's no wonder people grow up with crazy thoughts around here. Easy, Steve-O. I was raised the same way and it didn't screw me up, did it? It's a little early to tell. Dr. Greaver? Inside. Thank you. Mr. Kady, of course. Nice to meet you. Please come in. Ernie, she'll be right with you. ERNIE: Thank you. Now, just give me a moment. You rest easy, Betsy. Call me if you need anything. Thank you, doctor. [###] There. What happened to her? Oh, doctor-patient privilege, Mr. Kady. I'm sure you understand. Please follow me. My name is Dr. Harold James Greaver. I'm 64 years old. Married to Mildred, my wife, who acts also as my nurse. She's 63. And Amanda Jacobs, is she here? I heard you've been treating her. Yeah, well, technically she doesn't live here, but, yes, she is under our care as a patient. Her mother died years ago. After her father died recently she started to exhibit symptoms of schizophrenia, paranoia and depression. An emotional fever of sorts. [PHONE RINGING] Excuse me. Hello? I'll be right over. My apologies, Mr. Kady. I have urgent business to attend to. If you need more from me, well, my wife will be happy to arrange an appointment. She'll be down in a moment. Thank you. [###] [AMANDA SCREAMING] AMANDA: Help me. Help! Help me! [###] I assure you, Mr. Kady, she's perfectly fine. She knows you're here. And she did it because she likes to make a first impression. Well, tell her she made one. I understand. It can be a little unsettling. Please see yourself out. [###] STEVE: It was strange, like she was trying to get my attention. CALCUTT: Well, of course she was. I mean, that poor girl, she's suffering from schizophrenia, paranoia, thinking everyone is out to get her. And that's why she's in the hospital. What? You mean, Dr. Greaver's? Yeah. All I saw on his wall were "good doctor" certificates from the town. Where did he go to medical school? He's a good doctor, Mr. Kady. Greaver family's been taking care of us for over 100 years. The knowledge passed down generations to generations, much like it has across the world for centuries. If he didn't go to medical school, it's against the law. You know, around here, the law is my business. And before you judge, you should know it's always worked for us. Just because we do things different than in the city, it doesn't mean that it's wrong. And those outside laws. They don't apply to us. We're better off for it. And that's the way it's always been. Now, you two, you have a good afternoon. Steve-O, don't let this bother you. It's not right, Bobby. Lord knows what kind of mistakes a guy like that can make. I don't care how long his family's been practicing. It's not the 1800s. To some around here, it still is. Well, that's not good enough. Come on, I know what will take your mind off this stuff. [GUNSHOT] Well, this goes without saying, but I'm gonna say it anyway. Don't point it at your face. This here is your aim. Just step up, take a good look, and squeeze. Don't pull the trigger. Squeeze it. [STEVE CLEARS THROAT] Try it again, but this time aim for the bottles. Whoa! So you're not married, huh? I was. She passed away. I'm so sorry. I bet she was amazing. Yeah, she was. That's how I feel about Courtney. We were meant to be together. I know it more than I know anything. But sometimes she looks at me as that dopey kid she grew up with. Just makes it hard sometimes, you know, to ask her to marry me. Just be yourself, Bobby. If it's meant to be, it will be. Thanks for listening. You're a good friend. You too. What do you say we go shooting again tomorrow evening? Sure thing. Now that's the spirit that beat the Germans. And when we get back to the Lovett's, check the barn. I bet your ride's done. [###] [LIGHT BULB POPS] What are you doing? You look like you've seen a ghost. There was somebody standing in here, just staring. You must be talking about Curly. He takes walks like everyone else. Just ends up in stranger places. What's wrong with him? He had the fever, but he's one of the lucky ones. It passed, and thanks to Dr. Greaver, he lost only a little spunk. It looks like you have a short here. I'm gonna fix that for you, okay? [###] [WOOD CREAKING] [GIRL SCREAMING] [###] DRESDEN: Now let us repeat God's law. CHILDREN: Solidarity and steadfastness. Solidarity and steadfastness. We are the union of the divine. We are the union of the divine. And we shall cherish equilibrium and peace. And we shall cherish equilibrium and peace. Learn to love it here. [###] Maybe you can help me. I'm a little lost. I'm looking for Rockwell Falls. Excuse me. Hello? Sir. Hey, wait! Hello, sir, wait a minute. Please. MAN: There you go, fellas. Take it easy, don't work too hard. Howdy! Mr. Kady. Edgar Smalls. Well, what can I do for you? Um, I need a new fuse for Belma's barn. Let's see what I got. By the way, that delivery guy that just left. Yeah. Red? Yeah, when I was outside town, I asked to find Rockwell Falls. And he didn't help me. Strange fellow. Comes in a few times a week, depending. The delivery guys come in and out and mind their own business. But that's how we like it. Where are your manners, Curly? Can't you see we have a new friend? Say hello to Mr. Kady. He's moved here from Chicago. Actually, I'm just passing through. Oh, sure, my apologies. [BABBLING] We've already met, Curly. You were in Belma's barn. You remember? He's not 100 percent, Mr. Kady. He probably won't remember. Hasn't been the same since his brush with the fever. [BUZZING] [###] Run! Run! Curly! I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Kady. He's never acted up like this. I'm terribly, terribly sorry. It's okay. It's fine. [COUGHING] You all right, mister? Yeah. Obie... You know Amanda Jacobs? I guess. As much as anybody. Why is she at Dr. Greaver's? Because she has the fever. That's the only reason anyone goes there. Watch. She'll be different when she gets out. How will she be different? She'll be happy. What's the fever? Obie, what's the fever? I don't know. But they all look the same when they get it. What do they look like? Like you. [###] Never any crime, huh? [###] STEVE: Hello, Amanda. My name is Steve. I saw you in the window. I wanted to talk to you. You talk to everybody, don't you? That's right. I work with the Census Bureau. Not anymore. What do you mean? They'll find you a new job. And if you want to leave, you're sick and they'll save you, just like they're trying to save me. They're watching you. Who is? Who's watching? Everyone. Can't you see it? Okay, Amanda. Do you know what happened to your father? He tried to leave. And they killed him? They say God did. What happened here? I'm just gonna look, okay? Did Dr. Greaver do this to you? I'm scared. I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? Come on. Here we go. AMANDA: We should go back. It's all right. Help! Help, he's taking me. Help! It's all right. Okay? Please. Mr. Kady, let go of the child. Sheriff, they're abusing her. She's got marks on her face. Mr. Kady, let go of the child. She's been through enough, and she's unstable. You can see that for yourself. Help me! Help me. There, there, child. It's all right now. Help me. STEVE: Sheriff, you can't let this happen. I'm not. Take the child inside, Mildred. I have to speak with Mr. Kady. [SOBBING] Mr. Kady, Amanda Jacobs may only be 12 years old, but she has the fever. What fever? The only kind that matters. Like I said before: Talking crazy, thinking everyone's out to get you. And that our little town isn't as perfect as it is. GREAVER: No one knows exactly why it happens, but it's easy to spot. It's a look in the eye, like an animal backed into a corner. Eventually they try to run, but we try to stop them before God does. What are you talking about? As long as we can remember, Mr. Kady, God punishes those that try to leave. Are you saying that everyone that wants to leave Rockwell Falls has this fever? It's a sickness, Mr. Kady, born from a lack of faith, and my methods are the only successful means to bring them back into the population. We have to try to help. That's insane. CALCUTT: What's insane is why anyone would want to leave Rockwell Falls in the first place. Well, if there is something wrong going on here, I'm gonna have to report it. Oh, jeez, I'm sorry to hear that, but we've got nothing to hide. How are you feeling, Mr. Kady? [###] You look a little peaked. Why don't you get the sheriff to give you a lift. You look like you could use some rest. [###] That's okay. I'll walk. MAN 1: Hello, Mr. Kady. Beautiful day, Mr. Kady. MAN 2: Hello, Mr. Kady. WOMAN: How do you do, Mr. Kady? MAN 3: Good day, Mr. Kady. Hi there, Mr. Kady. [###] WOMAN: Hello, Mr. Kady. What can I do for you? Hmm. It doesn't look like your friend is gonna make it today. You sure he knows where we are? Yeah, I told him. Maybe he found something better to do, huh? Maybe he just forgot. Yeah, that could be it. [###] STEVE: You know what's going on with Amanda Jacobs, don't you? You don't know what it's like here. Then tell me. Please. They think that I'm dangerous because I don't like it here. But not to them. To myself. They've tried to kill my spirit. But I keep my thoughts close, where they can't find them, all the while just hoping for a chance to leave. Like Amanda. I've gotta find her. No, don't. Steve, it's too dangerous. Bobby, you know, some people are starting to whisper about them two. Stop it, Christian. He wouldn't do that. He's my friend. Still, I wouldn't wait too much longer to ask Courtney to marry you. Tomorrow, everyone will be at the festival. Now, you just... You go there, you let everyone see that you're okay. And then you just slip away. I can't just sit here and wait and do nothing. But if you go now, you'll only put her in more danger. If they figure out what you're doing, they'll just take her somewhere else. Steve, stay with me. I don't belong here. This isn't... This isn't right. Just promise me that you will take me with you. I promise. [###] [MOANING] [CHILDREN LAUGHING] [BANJO PLAYING] Hey, Steve-O. What happened to you yesterday? Thought we were going shooting. Oh. Oh, yeah, that's right. You know, I completely forgot, Bobby. I'm sorry. Hey, Steve. Come on, let's dance. HECKER: Boy, that's some friend you got there, Bobby. Shut up, Christian. What was that all about? I really need to talk to you, but everybody's watching us. Past the woods behind our barn there's a cabin about a half mile in. And if you're in trouble, you find it. What? BELMA: Courtney. Come stand with your mama. Find it. Gather around, everyone. Gather around. Is everyone here? Minus the notable exceptions: Amanda, the Sydes, the Hillenbocks? Well, that should be everybody, then. We give you thanks, almighty Father, for bringing new friends to the community. We give you thanks, O Lord our God. ALL: Solidarity and steadfastness. We are the union of the divine, and we shall cherish equilibrium and peace. All right, enjoy yourself, everyone. I can't believe this is the second one this year. Would have had a third if Ray Jacobs hadn't done what he did. How often do you have these festivals? It depends. STEVE: On what? The population, of course. Why, we're having this one because of you. Didn't you know? You make 437. I'm so happy and blessed. Thank you for this. GRATEMAN: Don't forget to restart your clocks until next time. Now, let's try to finish off Sadie's pies there. She's put a lot of love in them. Are you out of your minds? Doc, looks like we've got a live one. Are you all out of your fucking minds?! CALCUTT: How you doing there, Steve? Why don't you come along with us. It's okay, Steve-O. The doctor can help. Run! Run! No! No! No! Keep him still. COURTNEY: No. Don't hurt him, please! CALCUTT: Why would we hurt him, Courtney? We're concerned about his health. Can't you see, he's got the fever. He wants to run, just like you wanted to before. He's not sick! You are! All of you! CAINE: What are you saying? Take it back. I won't. It's evil! CALCUTT: Come on. Help her. Take her to Doc Greaver. COURTNEY: No! No! No! MAN: Very good. How are you feeling, son? Don't be embarrassed, Mr. Kady. We've seen it all before. STEVE: You killed her. You killed that poor woman. Her name was Ruby Flynn. And Ruby was honored to sacrifice herself for the good of the community. [GRUNTING] We can't help you understand until you lie still. Back in 1860, the population of Rockwell Falls was 436. And the town was happy and prosperous. But then a wicked man came to town, and his wickedness spread amongst the community until God wiped the cancer clear out by fire. Seymour Grateman, my great-grandfather, he rebuilt the town. And he established a moratorium on the population: 436. And that number obviously pleased our Father because, well, we guard it to this very day. It's God's law. But I didn't move here. I'm going home to Chicago. I have a home. We believe in our ways, Mr. Kady. But we don't suppose the outside world would understand. We know we've been chosen, just as you were. That's what your fever is. You give subversion a name and then you cure it? GREAVER: Mr. Kady, we did not create the fever. You're having a spell now. Can you feel all of that rage and that anger? That's not what God intended. We must save you from yourself. Believe us, Mr. Kady, everyone who tries running ends up dying. Not by our hands, but by God's. People will be looking for me. That's all right. We have taken care of that. What does that mean? You'll learn to love it here, Mr. Kady, just like everyone else. I'm not staying here! Do you hear me? GRATEMAN: Doc. I am not staying here! God! No, don't! No! Don't! Please! Now, it's for your own good, Mr. Kady. No, don't! Please! Don't! GREAVER: You'll see a bright light, and it feels like you're dying, but don't worry, it passes. No! No. No. [###] [MACHINE BUZZES] ALL: Solidarity and steadfastness. We are the union of the divine. We shall cherish equilibrium and peace. STEVE: Dear Frank: My life has changed here. I've found a new home. Send regards to everyone and arrange to take what you want from my place and my office. Tell the boss I'll send the reports soon. Thanks. Steve. [ON ANSWERING MACHINE] Hi, you've reached Steve. Leave me a message. [GASPS] Easy, honey. You're fine. You were having a nightmare, but those will go away soon. Oh, you're running a little hot, but you'll be fine. Don't worry. Mr. Kady. Stop. Get me the sheriff. [###] [DOGS BARKING] MAN: Thattaboy. That's it. Watch yourself. Hey, boy! Where you going? Why didn't you go, Steve? [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [###] Get out of the car. Now. It doesn't run. They parted it years ago. Even if it did, you can't get away. Who are you? My name is John Green. I came here eight years ago. I also thought I was just passing through. [DOGS BARKING] You do what I say. You have to be one of them. Do you understand? You have to be one of them. MAN: Come here, boy. Hey. You guys looking for Mr. Kady? Yeah, he's not doing so good. We need to get him some help. You got it all wrong. I invited him up a few days ago. If you don't believe me, sheriff, come on. CALCUTT: Steve! I'd like to have a word with you. What seems to be the trouble? About to ask you the same. Belma called. She said you ran from her place. My God, I am so sorry. I didn't mean to cause any trouble. I had a strange feeling... He's lying. EDGAR: Give him a chance. He's been nothing but a straight arrow. Even forgave my son, Curly. Steve. Do you understand how things work around here? I sure do, sheriff. I understand how important God's laws are. That's why everything is so... So peaceful. It's what God intended. Temperature's running high, but he seems fine. May have been a spell. Well, you just be a little more careful next time, son. I mean, you don't want us getting the wrong impression. It won't happen again. I promise. Thattaboy. So why don't you come back with us? It's almost lunch. I'm sure Belma's cooking up something. Give us a minute. I want him to say bye to the kids. They took a liking to him. There must be a way out. And what are you so afraid of? That they're right. Strange things happen to anyone who tries to leave. I can't explain. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy, Jack. If you think something's gonna happen, it will. What about the delivery trucks that come in? Nothing happens to them. They don't stay the night. That's the difference, I swear it. Would you listen to yourself? If you buy into this, you are as crazy as they are. Look, I am getting out of here, with or without your help. Have you had the nightmares? Maybe you can close your eyes to all this, but I can't. MAN 1: He's gonna help me with my boat. LIONEL: We knew you'd come around. MAN 2: Help me with the crops on Saturday. [LAUGHING] HECKER: Harmony's gonna have the baby real soon. That will put us back at 437. And some don't want another drawing, so here's your chance. Get rid of him. Everyone will look the other way. Then you do it. I can't hurt nobody, Christian. CALCUTT [ON RADIO]: Deputy Hecker, Mr. Kady just left Belma's. I want you to keep an eye on him. I'm on it, sheriff. You know, you always were stupid, Bobby. And look where it's gotten you. [###] STEVE: Belma said you called the house. What do you want? There's a secret road past the old sinkhole. It's how the delivery trucks get in and out. That kid Obie follows them down the road. Turn right just past the bridge. There's a delivery today at 4. [###] CALCUTT [ON RADIO]: Deputy Hecker, he's walking up Main, heading toward the hardware store. HECKER [ON RADIO]: I got him. [###] How you feeling, Mr. Kady? Just a spell, you know how it is. Hey, listen, do you have any kerosene? Belma could use some for her burner. Uh-huh. Just a sec. [###] Welcome to Rockwell Falls. No, Curly, that was a few days ago. Great. You mind if I head out the back? Go ahead. Thanks again. [###] I've been thinking about what you said. About being my friend and all. I'm confused, Steve-O. Stopped by the house the other night to finally ask Courtney to marry me, and I stumbled up next to the barn. You and Courtney were already together. I'm sorry. Do you think I'm dumb? Is that it? You think I'm some stupid country boy and you can just take her right out from under my nose, huh? No. I don't. God, it hurts so bad. Bobby, listen to me... You can't imagine how it hurts. If you ever loved her, you will help me get her out of here. You don't know what you're dealing with. Please, give her a chance. I just want this to go away. I just want it to go away. I just want it to go away. Bobby, you don't mean that. You don't mean that. Put the gun down. Put the gun down. [###] It's okay. It's okay. Please. Come on. I'm just all messed up inside. This beer gets to my head sometimes. I'm sorry, Bobby. [###] Where's Mr. Kady? I saw him come in. Yeah, he left out back a while ago. [###] MAN 1: It's a fire! MAN 2: Get down! It's our garage! Relax everyone, relax. Jack? Jack, get a bucket brigade going from that tower. Bobby? [LAUGHING] Bobby. Bobby, you all right? Bobby. Greaver's. He's going after Courtney. I knew it. Come on. ALL: We are the union of divine. We are the union of divine. We cherish equilibrium and peace. We cherish equilibrium and peace. [###] Mr. Kady, you do not know what you are doing. Okay, up against the wall, both of you. Handcuff yourself to the radiator. All right, where's Courtney? She went home this morning, doctor's orders. Don't lie to me. Where is she? Has anyone lied to you? It's you who won't face the truth. Where's Amanda? Tell me. You can't help her. Where is she? Downstairs. [GREG RUSSELL'S "THIS OLD HOUSE" PLAYS ON RECORD] Oh, hello. We weren't expecting company. I'm getting you out of here. We don't have much time. But this is our home. They haven't found anything permanent for us, but we're ready. We're doing much better now. [AMANDA COUGHING] Amanda. Amanda. It's okay. Dear, would you like another fresh blueberry muffin? Come on. [###] This way. [###] Oh, my God. HECKER: There they are. Over there. He's going for the tow truck. Get in there. Now, get down. Keys? AMANDA: Under the seat. [###] STEVE: Wait here. There you are. I'm so glad you're okay. It's gonna be all right. I'm gonna get you out of here. Why? What? I'm sorry you missed lunch. It was lovely. Oh, my God, no. AMANDA: Come on, we gotta go. Please, Steve. Steve. It's too late. She's been cured. [###] Get out of the car, Steve. Stay down. Don't do this, Bobby. What are you waiting for? Shoot him! Shut up, Christian. It's different now, Bobby. He's got your gun. Shoot him! Goddamn it, Bobby, if you won't do it, I will. [###] STEVE: Jesus. [###] [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [THUNDER CRASHES] [RADIO STUTTERING] [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO] [HONKING] [CRASHING] [###] [###] Hi there. Hey. Seems I got a little tire trouble here. Oh, yeah? Probably from the huge crater in the road. Listen, I'm on my way to Rockwell Falls. Looking for a friend of mine. You must be Frank. Mr. Kady mentioned you. Nothing but nice things to say. I'm afraid you just missed him. No longer with us, as of two days ago. You're kidding me. What a jerk. He made it seem like he was gonna be out here for a while. You know, I thought I'd check in on him, see what the good life's all about. Well, you're welcome to come into town and have some of the world's best apple pie if you like. We're having a little celebration in a couple of hours. Plenty to eat and drink. What's the occasion? Rain, sent from heaven. Put out a bad fire a couple of days ago. And Harmony Evans, local girl, just delivered twins. Oh, and Bobby, my deputy, just got engaged to the love of his life. Sounds good. I'm hungry. All right. Yeah, grab a couple of things. I'll give you a ride. That tow truck will be back to pick up your car in just a bit. What about the rest of my stuff? We're real honest around here. Never any crime in Rockwell Falls. FRANK: Sounds nice. CALCUTT: You'll love it. [###]
