Report an all people without documents to me personally.. He don't have a chance to escape. What's this? It is a psycho-panorama. It's an entertainment strip. They are recording ravings of some madmans. And then showing it. Where do they do it? At a TV centre. Possibly. They turn off lights again. Provocation at Pondej border.. Today in 5 AM.. a frontier duty detail was fire at.. when they patrol.. northern-most border of our.. country. Four soldiers were wounded, and.. one of them, corporal Roshe Musait.. seriously injured. Mobile brigade Otpor came to the place of incident.. Under the direction of the brigadier Kolus Helsh.. In accordance to the Justifiable Vengeance in Peacetime law.. there were raid to a frontier territory of Hon. facility had been destroyed. Aggressors learned severe lesson.. and our border guards... Mak. Mak.. What's wrong? Sit down. This is the World Sphere.. Yes it is. It's rigid. Yes it is. And this is the World's Light and it's one in the universe.. Yes it is. And you are living inside a bubble.. With heads up to it's centre? I think so. Rada. You've got it all wrong. It's opposite. Look, this is a planet.. This is a star.. where it is rotating around.. And in the universe a lot of.. stars You are living not on the inner surface of sphere.. but on the outer. You can flight here.. And you can flight out from here. Possibly.. Have you understood? No, I haven't.. Mak.. Have a look around.. The horizon arks up.. It's an optical illusion.. Do you as well think that I am crazy? No You do.. - You do.. N - No! Mak.. Please, say me what's going on with you? I will understand, honestly. It's nothing. Just that was not the contact. I was considered as.. funny madman.. I was tested.. The ship destroyed.. And without the ship no one will find me. And I won't get out of here. And I lost.. .. everything. You know, it's impossible to lose all. You know, I am aware.. when mama.. my and Gai's papa was a doctor.. And once he find himself in a plague contaminated vicinity.. In the plagued vicinity.. And everyone was evacuated, but he remained. He said that he won't leave because he is a doctor, you know. And after that, because there were no time to cure plague, they just dropped a bomb. Who was it? Don't know. We didn't yield, Mak. We have survived. I have always knew that all going to be all right. It's true. And then you came. Your Excellency, I have a dispatch on that savage whom Nomad have lost. Yes? All efforts to find him were failed. It seems the savage died in the city. What a pity! What a pity that I couldn't see Nomad's face when it was reported to him. Thank you. Dismiss an action. For a three years I was serve at the south border. There were radioactive jungle, and a people turned to mutants. Just a walking joints of meat. That only know how to eat and shoot. Mak, our country is in the circle.. There is a island empire at the oversea archipelago.. It's said that they worser than degenerates.. But worser than degenerates.. there are no one. Why? Yeah, you saw it yourself. That tower installation.. When I was a child, I already worked hard on construction site. We all worked hard to build protection system. And the towers.. And the towers stopped the war, Mak. That is Unknown Fathers stopped war with the towers, when they come to power. If they'll be absent Hot and Pade.. will bombard us in two minutes.. and a mutants will come and eat remains. And degenerates.. they are destroying towers for a money.. For a dirty Hon's papers. They are corrupt scum.. And who are those Unknown Fathers? They taken us from a pitfall.. They muster willpower to curtail that.. extremist scumbags who.. jump anything conveniently portable after the empire fall and thought that the country was their belonging. But why are they anonymous? Because they are official at the service. They aren't ruling, Mak. Thy are working. Do you know how difficult it is, when always risk of a war. There are always bombs under apartment houses, kindergartens and eventually under the towers. Gai.. That's why I enlisted to the guard. It wasn't a factory or a field. It was the battle guard. We are responsible for all now. For anyone.. For them.. I don't like small-talk and scribbles, corporal. Either you recommend Maxim... or not recommend. Yes, recommend, sir! So how can I understand this two papers? Here I am recommending Maxim for approval to private candidate for the battle guards. And here.. It is necessary to carefully check Mak-sim's background. Massarakhsh.. So what do yo need eventually, corporal. Mr. captain I believe he is suitable for the guard. He is like a brother to me. But I don't know his past. He has no documents at all. And he don't remember anything. I am ineligible to hide it. Two thirds of our territory wallow in anarchy. There are starvation and epidemic. People running away from there. And no one have documents. The department of Public Health let him through! - hBuththehdepar.. N - But me no buts.. We are in the guard. And not at a philosophical faculty. Either you recommend.. or not, choose one. You did well! The guardsman is to trust the friend.. entirely. Don't worry. I am myself.. look after him. They are saying some random patriotic guard's motto. After me.. At the double.. Go on. Go after me.. Unit, take aim. Advance for two figures. Unit Fire Advance for three.. three figures. Unit Advance for three figures. Fire Don't ever do this again Everyone make a mistakes. I am your officer, you here to obey, not to correct. An what if you are wrong? Listen to me.. For the benefit of discipline don't try to be knowledgeable. What is specific demographic pressure? It's a measure of aggression. What is SDP at the border with Hon state. It means that there is always war readiness. What about mouth of Blue Snake? Gai, you lose an argument. He memorized the book in half an hour. Wait a sec. I don't know why.. Why what.. Why do Hon and Pandei hate you so? Because befor the war.. We were single nation.. Because they are our former provinces. And they hate us just because they and us.. have the same history. They want desert similar to southern here. Gai, you lose an argument. And dress yourself, please. What is cereals harvest.. in north-west regions? They don't cultivate cereals in north-west regions. It's over, Gai. Go under the table and sing. Gai, stop it already. Go under the table. You are big bloke. Gai! Here yo go, breadwinner.. You can feed you family with bare hands. You can't eat it, it's too polluted. We mustn't fish here at all. But we still fished with father. It was long ago.. Take it. There were somehow different in the past. Maybe the world were kinder. A people were smiling. Like you.. And we have clean rivers We have a seas and lakes. This color I like the most. My mom told me similar story about magic mountain country Zarta. It's sort of happy country. There are only kind people. Maybe you are from that magic country. In fact, I am from Moscow. But no one believe me here. Are you feel homesick? I do. But above all my poor parents.. It had been told to them that I died. But wait.. Maybe you will make this.. yours.. null-transfererer with a.. spira -.. you know what I mean. Well. Because we are..

You have commanded not to shoot. Mr. captain.. Yes sir. You commanded not to shoot, Mr. captain. So.. If I have commanded to shut up, then you'll bite off your tongue? Yes, sir. Mr. captain. Allow me to report. Operation is conducting successfully. Residents are rendering feasible assistance. As always.. All right. Deal with those half-dead. And they are people too.. They have wives, they have children.. They were loved. They loved someone. Yes Mr. captain, it appears they are people too. Hell of a note. Yes, Mr. captain. I didn't expect it. I thought it was a real degenerates. Like a bare dotted monkeys. Bare dotted fool. They are like people.. Good, pleasant people which have a headache after an agitation. And you, do you have a headache after an agitation? No, sir. I am never feel pain. Do you? Wha-a-at? You have been very shirty so I thought.. Mr. captain.. Allow me to report.

She is my wife. Why did you decide to do anti-state activities? Because in a world's history there has never been a more abominable state. Because I loved my wife and my children. Because you killed my friends. And defiled my nation. Because I had always hated you. Is it enough? More than enough. Whom else can you name from your organization? No one. Are.. you sure? Gal Catcher. 50 y. o. Dentist. Sentence to termination. Time of execution is 48 hours. I hate you. I ha-a-ate you! How are you standing, candidate. Where are you looking at? Stand at attention!

For you information I am good at it. Do you want a demonstration? Don't bother. It'll come in handy. Mr. Tik Fesku, called.. Aper. Ha, haa! Massarakhsh What a horrible threat. Look at my left arm.. It was sawed off from me. In that old and good.. Prewar secret politpolice.. Sawed off in three stages.. Executioners came to work in the morning.. And sawed.. Then came to dinner, had returned and sawed again.. They sawed and sawed my lovely left arm.. And they were bored. They talked about theirs low income, theirs family troubles.. And from that I was terrified.. And now I don't afraid. Do you hear? I don't afraid! Tut-tut! What a petty people. Enough. I don't afraid. I don't afraid... Enough! The accused, number 7313.. Tik Fesku, called Aper Sentenced to indefinite work stay with an upbringing. Is your name Ordy Tader? Is your husband Gal Catcher? You have a child and your live in house 8 on Trubachi street. Think a little, maybe it's better to answer the questions? And then we can try to find your child. Blockhead.. What? I said blockhead. You are stupid blockheaded blockhead. Can't you hear me? Can you hear me, gray mouse, can you? You all will die, before we explode your lousy towers. Ordy Tader Sentenced to termination in 48 hours. You know, they are flipping out. From anger, from hatred, from nervous tension. They have degenerative, unnatural organism. And why do they released Noliry Nadu? The houskeeper. Isn't he the degenerate? He is the degenerate.. But he is cowardly, there are lot of such. He is hating us but afraid. And you can't bribe him, he is rich. You know, I think they are not after a money. For a money one can't hate as them. So what, they are degenerates! What are you trying to say?! I saw them! That doctor.. he is a good and brave man. The degenerate! All right.. All right.. He is a good and brave degenerate. And literate person at that. I saw his library. And his wife.. They are terrorists and killers. If you saw what were they doing to our guys. If you saw what I saw. What are you shouting for. Everyone looking at you.. That's all right. As always, all get out of hand because of you, Mak. Listen to me, Gai. All is allowed.. Even torture is probably allowed. You are the doctor. But to torture women.. Don't know.. Don't know, Gai.. Don't know.. Nomad, I have found him. You don't believe where. I'll believe. Where is he? He is in the guard. This is a bit troublesome. No problems. When do you bring him? To the car! Mr. corporal.. Allow me to speak. Speak.. Captain Chacho commanded you and candidate Sim to be at company's chancery. Wait till we get down. Yes, sir. Massarakhsh. Candidate Sim you are shown yourself as a good fighter and fellow-soldier. I am intercede for him to apply for actual private of the guard. You passed exam of a fire. And remains last exam.. of a blood. Corporal Gaal.. Go to guardhouse and bring the prisoners. Yes, sir! Don't worry candidate. Don't be frightened. It's frightening only at first. Take them by path and you see where you should put them. Do act, candidate. You'll return as actual private. As the guard. If amongst you there is a one human.. tell my mother. She is living in Utkin Dom settlement, house 2. She is called Elle. Don't stoop. Here it is, candidate. Or to Tadern, settlement, house 2. It is near.. Please, have you remembered? Let's wait and see. Yes, sir. Mr. captain. Do you afraid to be disappointed in your friend? No, sir. But, if your excuse me, I feel sorry that.. he caught a woman. He is a highlander.. He is as much a highlander as we are. And it is not a matter of woman. We'll see, though. That's all.. corporal Gaal.. I think it's futile to look forward for your buddy. I am afraid that it's a last time I call you a corporal. Massarakhsh. Here is your weapon, Mr. captain. I had let them go, and will go away by myself. You were deceived Gai, you were all deceived. You are living not on inner side of the sphere, but on outer. And there are billions of such spheres. Candidate Sim you are under arrest. Go into the car. I am going away and Gai too. He is gone mad. Don't do it mr. captain! Let's go Gai. No-o-o-o.. Mak! Mak! Mak.. Okay, you'll still be a corporal, but not in the guard. You'll write a report about transfer to the army. This is it. It's a thermal barrier up to 1000 degrees. When will it go to conveyor? It's already.. 10 machines.. per day. With your machinery we'll be left without a shirt. It's better without a shirt than without a slippers. As you was a colonel, you still remain a colonel. Whadda you.. playing with tanks.. I have aching tooth. Nomad.. Is it so difficult to develop painless way to cure a tooth? It may be considered. You'll better consider this, papa. Pandeas moved one more division to Hon's border. I weighed up an option. If they meddle in Hotian mess and quickly put there a man they will have joint front of 50 mln people against ours 40 mln's. I had like to gave a lot of money for them to meddle in Hontian mess. Who'll touch a Hon.. surly lose. It's depends on how to touch.. If it's delicate with small forces and not to deep.. Touch and bounce off when they stop quarreling. And why are you so silent? Clever man. When the Fathers talk.. for judicious children.. are better to be silent. So speak, speak. Bless you. You know the thing, I am not a politician. No-o.. Indeed, there is nothing funny about it, I am very narrow specialist. And as the same.. Must say that it's a very advantageous time to invade. Rearmament of army almost finished. Do you want to make war? And how long will we last out. How long we'll last out, Nomad? It's around ten days. The deep invasion plan can provide Hon's defeat in eight days. It's a good plan. That's how it'll go. Nomad.. Are you against it, it seems? I don't care. Well, let you be against it. So, brother-in-law, will we support majority? Do as you please. Ave, I knew that you'll be with us. Where should I go without you. Hey, smart man.. You must prepare public opinion. I hope you have think of something.. Some attempted murder or attack on the tower. Sure. It is fully ready. Doctor.. Doctor don't dawdle, it's session soon. Handsome guy. A had a son.. too. Anyone want to drink? Dole out a drain. What do you say, doctor? I stake my life that someone shot this youngster.. from an army pistol.. But a long time ago. At least half year ago. Where are the bullets? They are come out and I throw them away. Hmm.. come out you say. I think you are lying. Please, confess how did you do that. I am not lying. I's just our wounds heal fast. Cut me a hand. If it's not too deep it will close very fast. Husband told me about ancient highlanders medicine. They know how to heal a wounds. Highlander's medicine.. Sit down. In this youngster 7 holes and if it's real bullet holes at least 4 of them were fatal. What will you say to it? It's not a fatal wounds to us. If the captain shoot me in the head.. But he didn't. Yeah. It's very little time before the session. It'll seize us soon. He can bring the guards. Decide the issue faster. Do whatever you want, but I'll shoot him before the session. In the head. I believe in him. His tales doesn't fit together, but it's because he is different. He is too much different from us. He is not a provoker. General, I am for him. Why did you came to us? Who are these Unknown Fathers? Unknown Fathers are.. anonymous group of intriguers who capture the power. Some of them sincerely think that they are saving country, but most of them are embezzlers, sybarite and sadists. Are you satisfied? No I don't. You want too much from us. We are.. not theorists. We are practitioners.. we struggle for our lives. What do you seek except saving your lives? We don't have a common political program. We are killing because they killing us. Why are they killing you? Because we are considered as degenerates. To Unknown Fathers there is much to gain from our persecution. It distracts people from internal problems. From corrupted financiers who coin money with military orders, With towers building. What does it have to do with anti-ballistic defense towers? It's not an anti-ballistic defense towers.. They are transmitters of special radiation. Most people, you for example, don't notice it. And minority, because of some organism deviation, feel extreme pain. And they are called degenerates. Transmitters are powered two times a day at 10 AM and 10 PM. Plus they have local-range devices on patrol cars. We have nowhere to hide. We are going mad, shooting, dieing out. It goes nowhere. He is not one to know. How can he understand how it fees to wait for the next session every day of every year?! We are short on time you must decide. He don't know, we don't talk. We must set this clear. Doctor? Don't know Mama? Hm.. Forester? Ehh.. Wait, he is able to reduce pain. You.. are able.. to reduce pain? Yes I am. He is beyond price. So, Forester, you are for him. If anyone touch him.. I will.. tear them myself. Very well. You are handsome guy, Mak. It'll be a waste to kill you. And now.. Mak will have to show his talent to us. State-Prosecutor Your excellency.. Agent 771 reported that operation is had been fixed for today. It's perfect, colonel. Perfect But don't scare them off before the time. Are you afraid? No Why? It may come in handy later. Take it Take it It's degenerates. Fire. Brigade take the cars.. Faster.. Under attack Leave me Leave Leave.. Sorry.. General.. It was I who leaked out. Employee 771. Agent. Yes? I am happy with your work. Smart man Thank you papa. You can depend on me. The target is at home. Good. You've been done perfectly! Maybe there were only single of such tower.. Bad guys are no exception even in municipality. Listen, Mak.. What you have said is not possible. You are idiot! Have you ever imagined how many towers in this country? How many of them being build per year, per day. This is a billions costs, Mak. And for whom? For the miserable knot of degenerates. I don't know! You don't know anything.. anything. And you believe it all. Sorry, Mak. If you weren't you.. We all are too gullible. Background broadcast is about filth of degenerates. Forget about this foolishness. You don't need to think about such a matters. It's not yours, Mak. Go back to your mountains. Find your friends.. If you can't remember by head, be guided by your heart. - Where is my homeland.. N - Mak! You will settle there. Then return, take Rada with you, all will be ok. You will find your happiness. And by that time we'll finish Hontians and it'll be peace at last. Ma-a-ak! Stand still. On the floor! Move! Hands! Stay still. Don't move. Sit down! Don't shoot take them alive. Stay still. You move I'll shoot. Handcuffs to him. Degenerates.. Degenerates...

Massarakhsh He won't live till dawn. Don't be hurry. Hey, drudgerer. Ordy died in that operation. Only doctor lived through. And the general. And after that.. After that.. interesting.. My name is Zef. Maxim Yo don't believe me. It's a good question. We believe.. only in a can of meat. Lights-out, your death-rows. Your Excellency.. Nomad have came to see you. Yes, of course. Ask him in. Nomad.. Hello to you. And where did you go so often. You vanished into thin air, couldn't find you. Is it mountains? Hello. I was at health resort for recondition. Massarakhsh Always forgetting about that device of yours. When will you stop to taunt your visitors. The visitors has to be in discomfort. Visitor must be laughable. Or..

You know him? No. I want him. I am not on the case. I can't possibly remember every prisoner. I thought it was your man. There were my people.. one of them.. the rest were real. How had you called him? Mak-sim Ahh.. yes-yes-yes.. I have begin to remember.. It's a highlander's spy. Why do you need him? He is a mutant I need him for the work. Will you anatomize him?! Surely. Knacker.. How do you do at all? When will have I get him? What can you offer in exchange? First one of protection helmets. And a World's Light to top it off. Is it true that you had been assigned to develop directional transmitter? No.. As for.. Can you slow down those works? You are afraid. I do afraid. And don't you afraid? Or you think that papa will love you forever. He will use that transmitter.. on you at first. You are smart. It is a deal. After five.. seven days you can have him. After a five. There are so much metal after the war. Running amok, shooting. Do you thought if they gave you a gun then your free? It's no use. You can't escape through perimeter. There were once who tried. And if you want us to eat help me to clean up this shit. That is our work. Bring down those metals, before they bring us down. Strike ground! Massarakhsh And this is the work. Get accustomed to it. For the life I don't offer to anyone.. I am finished man.. and you have a bright future. Looks like it die out a little. I think so.. So what now.. stand up.. death-row inmates. Get to work if we want to eat today. Mak-sim So what? Massarakhsh Something rings a bell.. Something have been overlooked.. Able to see in the dark. South border. Reaction to the Aizu. Stop. Zero reaction to the A-radiation in both contexts. Mr. adviser, urgently come to my office. Before the war there lived a smart animals. Smart just like you.. I was pleasure to tame them. And people began to teach them a disgusting things. To bring the mines under a tanks. To bring contagion in enemy camps. And other rubbish like this. When war was at serious point they were forgotten. Many things were forgotten. And here they are. Golovans. So are they the mutants? Yes. But there are human's mutants, and those are animal's. We are a snack for them. They are in their holes and never sticks their necks out. Know why? That's because we have a.. GUNS! Zef! Where are you? Are you alive, Zef? I'll come down. Are you gone mad? Wait for us here. Must we really go there? We need to look over. Maybe this is a fortress. Immediately prepare special courier with guards. Single coach to the south. No, my articulated lorry to the south. And write down the two telegrams. First one: To the General-commandant of Distinct South Area. At once hand over the care of educate Mak-sim to the bearer of this. From now on you must consider convicted Mak-sim to be listed as missing. For which you must have an appropriate papers. State-Prosecutor And the secon one: Dear Nomad There was a stupid business.. Unfortunately material that you requested was listed as missing. As is the way on southern borders. Yours, smart man. That's all. There is someone out there. Yeah. If it is the stronghold there must be a nest of Golovans. Golovans. I don't care. When we have this. All the metal in the forest were controlled from this fortress. The control panel is somewhere nearby. Did you see? Did you see? True, it looks like a dog. I am sure this is the stronghold. Is this the control panel? Panel Wish we somehow manage to sort it out. Then all land will be ours. I don't think we can control anything from here. Wow it's a desert a wind walking on the sands. Go away. Let's get out of here while still can. Don't soot! Did you see? Are you an idiot? Idiot? This is a can of food. And to a commandant's office. You shoudn't get it to a commandant's office. He is not an animal. This is an animal. Masarakhsh.. You are the animal. You are immune to radiation. You don't afraid of transmitters. So now you'll be a liaison. And when I'll command.. I won't be a liaison. I don't want to obey you. I was ordered to destroy tower, but no one bother to said why. I saw that it was stupid and they'll kill all. But I adhere to order. And then I run straight into the trap. So I am saying: enough. I don't adhere to any more stupid orders. Snotnose The towers is just a retranslators so there have to be a center. And we must strike here! And don't bother with every one of them. Stop. How did yo know that there is one? It's evident to every more or less skillful engineer. So the main task is to find them. And not to send people die from machineguns. Massarakhsh To every more or less skillful engineer, you snotnose, evident, that while we destroy some towers we are disturbing retranslation of a whole distinct. And if you ever, ever again, Masarakhsh, will say that we are ordered to adhere to stupid orders and our people died in vain.. - Get off your hand. N - Zef.. I'll tell him.. Try to understand, Mak.. Those tillages.. They are not for us.. The radiation is act upon nervous system of every human. And they are turned in not a two times per day. But they are always turned on. As affected with this radiation human's brain lose ability to analyse, to think. But he began to believe, to believe everything. to a magazines, a radio, a choolteachers, an advertisements, a preachers. Information system is in indissoluble connection with a retranslation system. They can suggest any thought and people accept it as sole truth. And then they can do anything with people. Want an admiration, they'll give an admiration. Want a rage, they'll give a rage. If depression, everyone will lay down and began to die slowly. They can provoke suicide. They can provoke parents to kill their children. It is possible! Everything is possible. The ones who can understand are degenerates, they are immune to the radiation and a strikes are just painful. All of the ruling elite are degenerates. And anyone who isn't in the ruling elite - are the enemies of humankind. Is there any nation with at least few thousands people like me? Don't think so. Maybe amongst the mutants. Please, don't take it personally, Max, but you are evidently a mutant. The mutant from the edge of desert? Yeah Did you see one? I saw some. But they were already dead. They are all thugs and half-animals. Sometimes they catch some and hang near the barracks to ginger us up. How do they? They do it by the necks. How far from here is the desert? It's a tank. A tank. This is an upper square. Quiet. Down! From the left! Do it! Where are you going? I am going south. That is.. It's not an easy task, Mak.. Further there is 18 square.. Solid minefields. There are even no more animals. More power to your elbow! Wait Mak, are you want to die so badly?! Why did you hide true purpose of towers from ordinary underground workers? Because headquarters believe that they use towers for their own reason afterwards. For what own reasons? Try not to die. What do you mean blown up? Massarakhsh. I'll rot you away! Stop Stop Go I said go. Stop Who are you? Who is there? Mak Is it you? Yes, it's me, me! It's me, relax. Sit down. We are going to leave, Gai. Where are we going? To the south. You are crazy! They had granted you a life. Who has? My life is mine and no one else's. I must bring you back! And I must take you away from here. Are you nuts? They'll eat us alive at the south. And you will be executed if you came back. Drat! Wait a little! Wait a little, you. He was an outsider, the guard, a terrorist, a convict. The first circle closed up. There are the mutants, white submarine, nuclear war ahead. He wants to turn the world inside out.
