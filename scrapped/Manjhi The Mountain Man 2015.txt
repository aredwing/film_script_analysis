Son of a pig... I'm your father! Where are you going? Shuklaji, This is the most backward region of Independent India. Nothing has changed here for centuries. It's 13 years since independence but not a whiff of it here. No school, no hospital, no road either here. Do you see this mountain? It has enslaved Gehlore village. Nearest town Wazirgunj, is just 4 miles across the mountain. But one has to go 4O miles around the mountain to reach there... So many have died... trying to cross this mountain. What is this? So you want to wear shoes & feel like a lord? I made a mistake, Sir It won't happen again. L-low can we believe you'? I swear on my mother. Make him wear such shoes that he doesn't need them ever again. Forgive me Sir. Nail a horse shoe onto him. Get lost. Forgive me Sir. L-low are you Mukhiyaji'? We are honoured sir... l-low are you'? What is going on here? Just some minor repairs. Your first visit here ...since winning the election! What do I say Ivlukhiyaji? Politicsl... It just sucks you in.
