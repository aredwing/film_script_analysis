Then it forgets everything. That's why it's always happy. By the time it realizes it's in a fishbowl... it's already forgotten it. Same with my friend, Alekos. Except for a couple of years... We've been best friends since we were six. A hell of a long time. We want hair here and now! We want hair here and now! We want hair here and now! - What's going on? - Bald men. They've blocked the road. - Why? - They want hair here and now. - Are they filming a commercial? - And advertise what? Their reflection, I don't know. What'd ya say? I've got you on wide-angle. - Lf I miss my plane!... - Don't shout. Just trying to make up the distance. While we're waiting, would you like a bergamot? - Bergamot? - European! My company gave me this 3-day trip to Paris. And I'm not missing it because of any bald guy. - Can't eat anymore. - I'll eat it. I don't see us movin'... - You'll make it. - So long. You won't make it. - Tell me I made it. - Unfortunately... "Unfortunately." You say it so beautifully. It's all your fault! Don't you "Was?" me! Where's your hair? Oh, God! I ripped it out! - You're the boss. - I'm the boss. - You're the king. - I'm the king. - You're a horse. - I'm a horse. - No, I'm a horse. - And I'm your black rider... galloping into your dark little forest. I'll stuff this little pussy. - He's here, Mom. - I'm here. - Where are the others? - He's my only friend. What's it to you? I cooked all this food! Who's going to eat it! We will. - Can I eat the candle? - Sure! Our song! I'll need a by-pass! I'll blow up this pussy. Now, the 2nd round of talks... I'm Onan Afnan and you're the Middle East. - I'm Africa. - What do you see in the desert? - Cactus. - How many? - What're you thinking? - What time do the shops close? Count! Count! Am I disturbing you? Am I disturbing you? - Constantine? - So you remember my name? I was drunk. I didn't know what I was doing. - Me, too. - So you fuck your pal's wife? - You know how it is... - I'm learning. Where's my shirt, dammit? I should've let you leave. Your residence permit's expiring. Cut it out, you jerk! - Alekos... - What? - Beat it. Some other time. - Listen. I love this woman. I love him too. I'm crazy about him. He screws me like you never have. He screws me like you never have. He screws me... Okay, I get it! He screws you like I never have. Never! - What's that? - A knife. - What're you going to do? - This has got to end! Take one, baby. Thursday's our 6th wedding anniversary. I'll be a Greek citizen... I don't need you anymore. He went to Paris and I never heard from him again. Constantine was my whole life. He was my best friend. If something's happened to him, I won't be able to bear it! That's all. I think we're missing a leg. The left one's here. Must be the right. - The mountain's big. - And the leg's small. Good evening. - May they always be remembered. - I found it! Size 42. Right. That's it. We don't want a leg from another murder. Bring the head, I want him intact. He shouldn't feel that something's missing. Why didn't we just throw him in the sea? This is his favorite mountain, the one with the antennas. He said you could speak to the whole world from here. So, speak! Goodbye, pal. Have you seen the damn lighter? Where the hell...? Where could that lighter be? Don't know. I left it here. I stepped on some gum. Constantine throws it everywhere. The only time he doesn't chew is when he's not well. I'm out of here. A woman? I can tell. You're in bad shape! Don't go stay with your mother. Mothers are the worst after a breakup. "I told you so!" Not in the state you're in. How about a nail clipper? Sure... as long as it cuts. My fucking cement shares! Climb, dammit! Are you going to use the whole bottle. I told you to change cologne. I can't hide the smell. Why am I so sexy? Unlimited mileage. That's how far I want to go. Our phone numbers. Your keys. If you need anything, anytime... I'll manage. - Th... the signal light. - Th... th... the key. You'd think I'd been fucked by Dracula! What now? OK, Dora, bye. - Good afternoon, Alekos. - My damn mobile battery's dead. It's your mobile battery, not a pacemaker's. This chair relaxes me. - Now I feel calm. - Are you sure? Any food? My feet hurt. I've got to take up tennis again. - Did Constantine call? - Not while I was here. My damn back. I hurt it trying to open a window. - Was the view worth it? - You know my office view. - You were at work? - Where else? Do I win a prize for the right answer? - What's for dinner? - Yesterday's leftovers. Nothing from the day before yesterday? Don't touch me, don't touch me. I stink. I have to shower. Am I wrong or have you changed your cologne? You mean there's none of that spinach pie left? Why hasn't he called? And you're wrong. She's got a nose like Cyrano de Bergerac! Why does that cologne remind me of something? You say something, dear? I can't hear you. You're so cute today, Pinocchio. Yes, you're right. Divorce him. The kids can't go on living in this kind of situation. The usual. I've saved a little money. No! I definitely want to open a gym. Definitely! When I get my citizenship everything will be different. I'm really interested in this work. Not Constantine. The phone's ringing. It must be my husband calling from Paris. Hi, darling. Have you arrived? Yes, darling, I just left the hotel. - The weather? - The weather's fine. - How's Paris? - Wonderful. I'm at the Champs Elysees. I can see the Arc de Triomphe. - Don't forget my perfume. - Yes. - Who's there? - Some French people. You haven't found a French woman have you? Are you kidding? I'm not like that, darling. The battery's running out. I'II... I'II... fuck you! Did she fall for it? Yes, thanks. I really appreciate this. - Dumb women. - Dumb men. - A double hotdog. - With everything? Yes, just hold the onion. - It won't fit two. - Oh, it will. - This particular roll will. - You know something I don't. You know, I did ballet in my youth. I'm thinking of taking it up now... otherwise I don't see myself making it. This reminds me of something. Let's go. Look towards the light, over there. Good! Lift the ice-cream higher. That's great. Now towards the light. - You first. - No, you. We've been here for hours. I'm freezing. The others have been in and out already. - What if I get stuck? - What d'you mean? I saw two dogs doing it yesterday and they got stuck... and everyone laughed. What if I get stuck? - Want to hear my theory? - Want to hear mine? - Lf I get stuck... - First of all, you don't bark. And second, I'll come and unstick you. - Ready? - Yes. Charge! When I come, what do I shout? "Charge," I don't know, or "I'm coming, I'm coming!" Why shout it, if I'm doing it? They'll think I'm an idiot. Well, boys, what's it gonna be? - Where's the girl? - I'm the girl. You? - Where are you going? - Mom! Get back! You're useless! You've made a fool of me! Your friend will ruin you! Get back! - Hello? - Hello, who is it? Is that you, Panayotis? No, I'm not Panayotis. I just wanted to talk to someone. I dialed this number at random. I just wanted to say that I'm an idiot - an accomplished idiot... and that my best friend is screwing my wife. I just had to tell someone. Get some sleep, dear. It's been ten years. Forget the slut! Hey pal, you a pilot? If you're not, can you do me a favor? Can you give me your phone number? Asshole! - Move it! I'll explain later. - Where are we going? Get back here! I forgot my keys, but I won't go back anyway. - Will I go back? - Got a light? Just a minute! - Do we know each other? - A light! Where are you going? Are you married? D'you have a job? - Did it light OK? - It's fine. I'm not well. Let's walk. My nerves are on edge. I'm shaking - but I won't cry. If I don't walk right now... Can I lock the car? Shall I drive you somewhere? I can't sit still right now! - Venia. - Constantine. - We've made a deal, right? - With...? - The asshole, who else! - Calm down. - I'm calm. - Lf you say so. I'll tell you the whole story. Tell me if I'm unreasonable. You're killing me! Go ahead, take my fucking stripes, too! That's all you have to say? Why're you pressuring me? You're choking me! I don't know which way to turn. What did I do wrong? I took care of all of you! Even that bum your brother! You think I'm made of money? - Don't you come near me! - I oughta belt you one! You leaving? You wanna leave? Shut up! Didn't I tell you, not more than 6? Didn't I? I did. - 6,8, it's all the same. - 8, 12, 20. Why not an army? What army? We said we were gonna maintain certain standards. Not more than 6. Didn't we agree? We agreed. Where are you going? I got my dignity - my fucking dignity. You're not going to walk all over it. Didn't you know my problem with the pilot? You knew it, but you brought him anyway. I swear I didn't know. Don't go! You're not gonna blow this marriage. - I'll blow it sky high! - My love... - Asshole! - My love... See, I have no problem with group sex, but... - Not more than 6. - Yes, us and 4 others. It doesn't matter whether they're men or women... As long as there are 4... and no pilots. I feel I'm suffocating on planes. When someone's doing it to you, and says he's a pilot... I just can't take it. I lose it. Like the plane door's closing on me and I can't function. - I shouldn't ask, you say... - But you ask. He's screwing you. Shouldn't you know his line of work? - It's... - Just curiousity. Pilot. It's like he's saying: "Our relationship is over." Tell me if I'm being unreasonable. I didn't say I'm a pilot. I said I wanted to be one. You believe all these years, I've only been with my wife? Let me see. I believe you. - What's your sign again? - Leo. - What did you say? - Group sex is like Marxism. All for one and one for all. You meet different people, scientists. You learn things. I learnt the term "bioclimatic home" during group sex. - Is that so? - Would you... And what did you do when you saw them? I'll tell you. First of all, I'm afraid of heights. Excuse me, sir. You can have 'em. It's me. I jumped over to the next balcony. I wanted to think. What's there to think about? They were fucking. See, you avoid that with group sex. You don't worry about your friend, because everyone does it together. Good point. - What're you doing tomorrow? - You scare me. I'm supposed to be in Paris for the next 2 days. Great. Tomorrow you're coming with me. I'm not good with groups. Forget it. - No silly, don't you trust me? - Frankly, no. You'll come. Let's go to a hotel and get some sleep. My feet are killing me. You'll pay the bill. Okay, but let's get my car. Can you imitate an elephant? I can. I can't. So the black guy undresses and his "hose" pops out, I'm spread out like this, the Chinaman sees it and is blown away. It was endless, like the Great Wall of China. Have a nice stay. I'm talkin' to you. - Was that in New York City? - Zuberi City last year. Great! - I'm worn out. - A real slut! The asshole will be looking for me. - Do you like your life? - I hadn't thought about it. Looks like you've put everything on hold. I love the asshole. We met at a demonstration. They were leaving Iran, going into Irak, I can't remember... He was a cop and I enjoyed being beaten up. - In Iran? - No, silly. I felt so guilty. I was leftist with a communist father. - It takes a while to get over. - You're telling me! Where are we going tomorrow? All of Athens spread out before us. I'm hungry. - I'll get something. - Forget it. All dressed up for the office move? No, we're moving offices on Saturday. I've got an appointment... it's business. Big business... Company insurance. It's a transport company. They move animals. Animals. Well, that's something new. Why? There are all kinds of companies. This one moves an animal from here to there. Sure, they can't leave it in the same place. Are you hiding something, Alekos? I don't have a girlfriend. I swear on the coffee... I'm about to drink. - Where are we going? - Hope it's the right roof. Are we gonna hang clothes? - Wait! - For what? We can only understand ourselves by speaking up... Constantine, this is Stella. Meet the members of the group therapy. Christos, are you still here? I've left, got away, escaped... Tonight I feel like Cuba with my cigars, my convertibles... But you know you can't live in a country without souvlaki. I'll tell you a great joke... Christ is playing tennis with Naomi Campbell... - Give me a break. - Coming to my cousin's bar? Tonight's an anniversary... ...of the first time you jerked off? - Such talk! - Oops! I'm off. Theoni, any e-mails from the apostle Paul? How are you, Mr. Alekos? When you got the truck waiting outside... and Belgium's expecting its apricots at 8:13 on the dot... you can't have an affair with the woman you met... when you stopped for a quick snack. I like to take my time with women. Let's get back to Harry... My Mom didn't like any of the 63 women I took home... only Nina, who wanted to marry me. But Mom said a winter wedding was unheard of. "What mother would wear a coat to her son's wedding?" I want to get married, but I can't. You call that an accident? I've got 8 stitches in my ear! Because your wife hit you over the head. Insure me against my wife then. - Fire, accident and wife. - It's... life. Your phone's always busy, I've lost you. When I came here, I was convinced... I was the reincarnation of King Jugurtha. I'd go to the toilet and wonder... how would King Jugartha sit? Like this? Like this... like this. Have you closed "shop" downstairs? I'm closing now... Hold on. Hi, Daphne. I'll call you back. I've got time to "shop" at 10. Now I've got to go shopping with your wife. I'm walking on a tighrope here. Tonight, I'm exterminating your little "shop." - All-night shopping? - Something's bothering her. - Did you like it? - The roof therapy? Fine. In the US, everyone's being psychoanalyzed on rooftops. You know, roof therapy... I'm not ashamed to shout out my problem. - I have to shout now? - Give him some time. - On tomorrow's roof. - Okay. I've got premature ejaculation! - Just the two of you? No kids? - No. - Only married? - Only. Times have changed. Here today, there tomorrow. - The kitchen? - Let's see the bedroom... The bathroom is rather cramped. I don't have a permanent relationship right now. - The garden is large. - Yes, large. Sign here, please. Your husband doesn't need to see it, you said. - No, he doesn't. - OK. You've got my cell number. Let's see something else. You're not helping me help you. - I can imagine it, but can't... - Express it? That's it. - The fuchsia does things. - Great things. Brightens things up, I'd say. Matches our puppies, too. - You've got fuchsia puppies? - The design on my underpants. Wrap them up real fancy with ribbons... and do that thing with the scissors... And give me 50 of those cheap panties. - To be torn off! - That's it! - Stella's great, isn't she? - Yes, she's got something. And she's a straight talker. - See you at the hotel! - What's up? - Boys! - It's Venia! - Hey, weren't you sailors? - No, you've mixed us up again. Here you are again! Easy women, cheap booze and and wild sex in the forest... - Snap out of it. - I can't take it anymore. I was with my babe and guess who I saw... coming out of a house with a guy... Our Constantine's wife. They're all getting laid, man. - I'll tell you a great joke... - You just did. I'm laughin'. I'm off. - Don't think about it. - He ruled it out completely. There are millions of other doctors. People have gone all over the world to have a child and they did it. I know how much you wanted one. It'll happen when it's meant to. - I love you so much. - How much? A lot. Was my baby quiet while I was away? Were you quiet while I was out? We have visitors this afternoon. A man. Now don't be jealous. He looked handsome. No, not handsome... Charming? THODOROS AN AMOURLIDES PRIVATE IN VESTIG ATOR Our life revolves around details. I don't want my friend to worry. - Constantine? - Yes. - And the Rumanian woman? - I want evidence. I want to show him photographs. Photographs. Front, profile. I tell it like it is. I'm not tactful. If she's got him inside her, I'll tell you. I won't beat around the bush. Manly stuff. I'm not tactful. Don't start tonight though. We'll all be together tonight. Constantine too. Oh boy. - Bye. - Bye. - Constantine! - Constantine, who? I found him after all these years. I looked him straight in the eye but he didn't recognize me. It says "Alekos Zaharopoulos" here. He's the one who left. I'm talking about Constantine. I told you about him. We were classmates. Then we lost touch. My first love! I need a drink. I wanted to cry. And I'm impersonating Thodoros! Why? Why? Because Thodoros died... and just as well! - Calm down. - Why am I impersonating him? We had to keep this office. Everyone trusted him. Yes, but why am I impersonating him? You've got two fat children. I could live my life watching him from afar. Even if I don't marry him, I'll tail him. Thodoros, you're not Thodoros! You're Lisa. I'm Lisa. - Where's Thodoros? - I'm Thodoros. And I'm Yolanda. A lot depends on you. - Good evening. - Good evening. - It's been a while. - Come in. - Do you li e it? - It's fine. It's my friend Katy's apartment. I guess she paints in her spare time. I can't draw a thing. Sure are a lot of paintings. - Freud. He likes you. - He smells problems. A whisky. If it doesn't work, we'll use pills. I like it that you take me seriously. So, go on. I'm all ears. If there is a beginning... it began 6 years and She's crazy about you. Crazy, I tell you. "Who's that gorgeous hunk?" She said. - She called me gorgeous hunk? - I swear. May I never clinch another insurance contract! - A Rumanian goddess. - Rumanian? So what? She's a goddess. Did she really say that, Daphne? Daphne found her a job at the restaurant. She used to work with me. But then she had problems with her residence permit. - She's very nice. - So where did she see me? Listen, as we're talking... she says she'd stay here, if she met a Greek man. So I grab the opportunity and I say... I have a friend... unmarried. But she wants to see you, so I show her that holiday snapshot, - the one of us on the donkey. - You showed her that? All you can see is you and the donkey. No, you're in the background, looking at the camera. "I want to see him," she tells me. Maybe she'd like me to come with the donkey? Do you think this will work out? I had a dream about it, I tell you. I saw a snowy-white ox and that only means one thing. - Marriage. - Marriage. - How did I look on the donkey? - Neat. Now eat your fish. Go in. The next day, the ox and his pal went to a restaurant, which was anything but a restaurant. Come here! Come back here. - Where are you going? - I forgot to put on cologne. Fuck, is that such a problem? Here. And what's more you didn't say where we're going. I'm dressed like a catholic priest... about to bless the outrageous. Look at me! We've got big ones. We're not worried. - Thank you. - You're welcome. In a week, we were married. Her residence permit was expiring. And for six years the marriage was fine? Sexually, it was fine. At least, I thought so... You didn't notice anything in the corner of her eye? I didn't look, but there was nothing in the middle. I haven't been to a sexologist, but isn't 4 times a week okay? - What if she wanted 10 times? - She never said so. I'm not saying she went to him for the extra 6. The reasons are always much deeper. It never occurred to you that Andrea and Alekos...? No... no... Yes. You don't know when to stop! You ate your brother's burgers and mine! You ate 8 servings of french fries! And you had to top it off with the last of the spaghetti! - Thank God, we have no kids. - I'd like one. - What does Andrea say? - No problem. We haven't taken it seriously yet. She'd like one very much. Where are they? Please bring me the shampoo. Darling. Where's Alekos? Who knows? Probably chasing an octopus. - What's this? - What? Here, here. I... um... sat on a rock... I felt something. A little crab must have been there and it bit me. Give me a kiss, come on. A crab with a set of human teeth. If you're in love, crabs have teeth... and porcupines don't have quills. - A falling star. - Where? Well I made a wish. I don't know if the star heard it. Are you going to be like this all night? You haven't eaten a thing. Eat your fish. So that's why you wanted me to start tomorrow? He's always been like that. He once hit on me behind Constantine's back. Why today? It's our anniversary. This has been brewing a long time. What's more I don't feel the same passion, the same love. This is new. You don't feel the same passion, the same love? I've decided to talk to Constantine. - "My friend," I'll say... - Friend, huh? "I'm screwing your wife." He could be screwing mine. I don't like that! You're not screwing me! I'm not a fence, I'm a person! Why're you shouting? In bed... This is a table. Knives, forks, plates. I'm dressed, I'm made-up. - Am I made-up? - Yes. I love Constantine. Let's go. Now. I loathe you... ...so much. - How much? As the squere block. Now! - Little umbrellas. - I hate them. I love them. I shouldn't feel bad that I'm keeping you. Do I look like I mind? - You didn't finish about... - The love affair? It was great. I was a student in Germany... and was vacationing in Greece. He left along with the summer and I never saw him again. - His name was Alekos too. - It seems to go with the name. - What should I do? - Give it time... What does time know, that I don't? You'll look back on this one day and laugh. If I strangled them now, I'd laugh today. DRIVE IN THE PERVERTED FISHBO WL What're they doing? Tell me. Don't I give you a good screw? That's all you can think of! Didn't we say I'd be the brutal exterminator today? Today we'll play another film. "Run, Lola Run." Where are you going? Get back in here! Come back, people are looking at us! They can see us. Come here! Come here! Come here! I can't see a thing. Where are you? What do you want? - You've got someone else. - I want to break up. Alright, fine. I'll hear arguements. What're you staring at? I've never opened up to a woman before. I'm impressed with myself. I've always said everything to Alekos. It's different talking to a man. You're not ashamed of telling him that you're a jerk. You have to tell a man, while a woman knows it. Why do I do this so well, dammit? I need an expert to tell me why? You swore you wouldn't tell Constantine anything. I'll insure this pussy. Forward, soldier, on to victory! Go girls before it starts getting kinky. - Hey, that's my Vivian! - Bye, Lilian. What's the matter? How can you sleep in your helmet? Wake up! What's happening? Is the enemy here? You're such a jerk making me strap myself up here. I told you I'm afraid of heights. You take the top bunk. Have you been with my Vivian? Are you kidding? Before I fuck her, I always ask first: "Are you Lilian or Vivian?" - What does she answer? - No. Then why did she ask me where's the mole on my dick? - So where did it go? - Where do you think? You're the one with the mole. Haven't you heard about the twin syndrome? Whatever one feels, the other feels too. Mine called me Constantine in bed. Then she explained it to me scientifically. Sometimes she asks me how the mole got on my dick. Those twins will drive us crazy with that mole. This will really blow you away... Last time, mine had an orgasm without me even touching her. Obviously yours was having an orgasm and she felt it. - On Saturday? - Yes. Go to sleep. - Sorry, Alekos. - That's okay. You needed to believe him. You're not so naive. I'm not, huh? Just pretending? You come, we screw, you leave. That's no relationship. Don't we smoke and talk too? Do we have to talk about saving the seals? Not only seals, Alekos, not only seals... There's the sea turtle too. You only know 50 words: "Baby, you turn me on, you drive me crazy, you kill me, take it..." Our relationship can be summed up in 50 words. That's it. You don't know basic things about me. I care about saving the seal, the orangutango. - Damn that pronunciation! - Saving, in general. Are you ready to face that they may be madly in love? Are you kidding? And you're a psychologist! I care about even the tiniest bug in the Amazon! But when I see you, I don't think about saving the penguins dammit! I don't! Why did God create man before woman? First experiments, then miracles. Why haven't women learned how to park? Why do men honk their car horn for no reason? We're not going to get along. Good one. Did my boy buy panties wholesale? A gift of 900 panties? D'you think I'm a whore? The car has become an embassy, but I don't know of what country. I forgot to mention... that was the last time we made love. - Just so you know. - What did she say? What did you say? Don't you dare slam the door on me! - I've depressed you. - We'll talk tomorrow. - Good night. - Good night. What? The paper shredder... It sucked and chewed it and almost... What can I swear on? Tell me. I wish I could help but you've used everything up. Graves, souls, there's nothing left, dear. I won't stoop to your level. What can I say? What can I say? What can I say? I M ADE UP WITH THE ASSHOLE. LET'S GO TO AM USEM ENT PARK. VENIA. LOOK AT THINGS WITH HUMOR. Having a fuck, eh? Having a fuck, eh? Having a fuck, eh? - Take your time. - I would've told you. So I'm finding out quicker this way? Don't take it personally. It happens to everyone. It's the initial shock, you know. - What were you saying? - Don't stop... please. - I'll cook some eggs. - Will you eat with us, Alekos? Oh, alright. - Put some clothes on. - He's talking to you. I'll make some french fries, too. - You'll eat some, won't you? - Fuck the fries. I'll fuck them, because you've already... Hey, she didn't go with a stranger. - I'm starving. - It makes you hungry. You're caressing my leg. Play with me, too. I don't know. I don't think so. Was it the last time? Will it be the last time? Your coffee, Mr. Alekos. Take it away! - What's in the coffee? - Coffee. - Apart from coffee? - Your problem... that it's not pleasant when you drink it. I want us to talk! You know. It's not my fault that I can't get it up. It might be due to stress, or pollution... it could be hereditary, or due to age. - There's so much. - Where are you going? - Don't be surprised if... - I get it up? Heavy stuff so early in the morning! I'll drink tea. Hirohito... Nagasaki... fuck me. rip me apart. Constantine? Should I write it on a neon sign? "This is the last screw." You're not a man. You don't understand. - Right? - Right. If I'd known, I'd have given it my all. But then what would you be left with? Are you sure I had an orgasm with you? I'm not gonna drink coffee today. I can't believe you didn't have an orgasm. - What about all that screaming? - Special effects. I can do it for you now... - I'm kidding. - Why? I'm dying and you're playing 8-ball. Go away, I'm losing. - You used me. - It's over for me. We'll be on the news, Andrea, I warn you. - Don't push me! - Beat it, you jerk! It was absurd for Odysseus to expect Penelope to wait. She was probably screwing. Probably. - It's Odysseus' problem. - It's Constantine's problem. But why did Odysseus have to go through so much? Only to leave Troy and find his wife on all fours...? If he knew, he'd have gone somewhere else. He wouldn't have gone to Ithaca, but to... Vourvourou. - Yannis? - Yes. I don't think the point is Penelope and Odysseus. I think it's Abbott and Costello, Bolek and Lolek. Let's not psychoanalyze it anymore. It's an asshole's ego trip and it just happened to be me. I know what I have to do... I'm an asshole! You're not the only one! See if you like them. They're beautiful. Beautiful and large. Faces Northeast, eh? Rooftop therapy's not really my goal in life. It's fine but I took over because Katy got ill. Things will be better for me in Germany. What if I say that I'll miss you? I've heard that before. Venia's disappeared again? No, she left a message. She's gone back to... You can stay the night with me, if Freud doesn't bother you, or I for that matter. On the contrary. This wasn't something I'd planned. I've got to go to bed. I have to pack tomorrow. I told you. There nothing to keep me here. You could be right. I just want to thank you. Thank Venia. I'd like to go with you tomorrow... and not be at my wedding anniversary. Don't rush things. There's still fog up ahead. Am I in danger? You, inside! I hope you'll be fine on the sofa. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Not a word. You have to tell him, he's your friend. He should know about his wife. If you tell him, we're through. I'll say it in my own way, without really telling him. - Do you change bandages? - As soon as Mr. Alekos gives... Good morning. - How was Paris? - Just great. Is the Eiffel Tower still high? - There's a reason I'm asking. - Really? - Theoni! - Was it nice? Yes. How was the love affair while I was gone? It's no joke. He won't even insure my brother. - What happened to the priest? - His cassock caught fire again. We'll insure him against the holocaust. - Goldfish! - You're such an asshole. Couldn't you call to say you were okay? Important thing is you had a good time, right? It was beyond perfect. It was fantastic. They say Frenchwomen use perfume, so they don't stink. - Any luck? - You know that's not my style. If you don't screw around now, when will you? Are you screwing around these days? No, but the thought does cross my mind. But it doesn't stay there? If it did, you'd tell me, wouldn't you? You'd be the first to know. - Want to hear a joke? - No. A guy goes to the Eiffel Tower and says... "My God, I'm so short." "Don't worry," says the Eiffel Tower, "with your cuckold's horns, you're as tall as I am." It's a joke! Thanks for everything. You have my number... Have a good trip... And when the fog clears, see me. Constantine. Don't make it raven black. Just enough to hide the grey. Raven black! Don't you be afraid and let's keep it serious. So go on, tell me... I thought as much. OK, something almost happened, but it didn't work out. - Near the Seine? - At the cathedral. - Quasimodo's sister? - No, we're talking goddess! But if your wife's okay, you can't. It's psychological. If she fucks around, however, with this guy and that guy... One's enough. But in my case my wife's beyond reproach. - Lf she wasn't... - lf she wasn't? I'd kill them both. - You'd kill her? - And him. - Of course... and him. - Of course. Don't forget about tonight. No, no... What's tonight? Our 6th wedding anniversary. You were my best man. - Is it hot in here or is it me? - It's you. It's coming out raven black! - From Paris to Kozani? - Yes, Kozani. I'm leaving at dawn... and coming back on Sunday. It's an important job. D'you want to come? No. If it was Thessaloniki... - You'd come to Thessaloniki? - Absolutely. But Kozani... holds you back. - Know who I dreamt about? - My wife. - Don't be an asshole. - I'm kidding. - That's not funny. - I laughed. - I dreamt about Stella. - Who? My 8-month love affair? Daphne's great, but she doesn't do it for me. Of course, Stella wouldn't have waited for me. She has kids by now... but it turns me on to think about it. - How do I look? - You look fine. How would I look... with a kid? - What kid? - A kid. A real kid? Andrea asked me not to tell you. She said especially not you. But if I don't tell you, who do I tell? No way. Of course the dates don't quite match... But the father could hardly be someone else, right? Nowadays they can find out through the DN A. No way, man. The chicken. With lemon sauce, rosemary, thyme, fennel... - Budapest olives... - Prague prunes... Is there anything it doesn't have? I'll have duck with goose sauce. Duck with orange goose sauce. It's as if it were yesterday. It feels the same... a burning sensation. - Steak. - After studying the whole menu? Is that a problem? I'll have whatever my friend has. The friend's steak... So, how was Paris? Your first time, right? No. Wonderful! I'll tell you a joke I heard there. A Spanish guy sees his best friend fucking his wife. "Buenos dias," he says, "Buenas tardes," she says. And from the closet, you hear, "Ooooooo..." Tarzan? Come on, it's a great restaurant. - Let's go now! - Why? - I'll tell you later. - Hey, wait! What a shame. You're so rude. ...and the Spanish guy yells, "Let's get organized!" - Are you on coke? - I just feel incredibly high. I've got a terrible headache. - It must be a migraine. - I read in Paris... When half of your head thinks something, and the other half something else, then... - You get a migraine. - Yes. Come on, I'm just kidding. - To our love. - To our passion. - To your passion. - To your love. To the heir! What's wrong? You've got no imagination when it comes to lovemaking. And if you haven't, some other guy will screw her. If he's a prince... then I'm a bullfighter. No. Emperor Nero... I'll make it sizzle... completely! PLEASE HOLD IT'S CONSTANTINE I WANT US TO H AVE CELL PHONE SEX - ASK M E AN YTHING TAKE OFF YOUR BRA I'M COM ING DO WN IT'S NICE DO WN HERE LICK M E ALL O VER YOU'RE HORN Y I FEEL I I C AN'T TAKE IT AN YMORE DEEPER Open the door! I'm off to Kozani. Back on Sunday. I adore you. It was wonderful. Constantine. Hi. Have you parked? Come on up. The fucking paper came! My fucking citizenship. - You must be happy now. - I am. - I'll call you. - I'll be at the gym. It finally came. You're flying high. Alekos, I'm calling you from Kozani. Please drop by the house and talk to Andrea. Don't tell her I called you. She wants to have an abortion. - Please speak to her. - Okay, bye. You haven't called me with any information. I'll tell you up close. - Can't you tell me from afar? - I've got evidence. - Is she at home? - No, she's at the gym. I'm on my way. - Where are you going? - To Miami. Did you book a hotel? It's a joke. - Hello? - You don't know me. - Lf you say so. - I'm a woman who loves you. Because I love you, I want you to know that... your wife is sleeping with your best friend Alekos. Right now, she's at the "Jump & Jump" gym. - Everyone's jumping. - Jump & Jump. When you find out who I am... Everyone knows she's screwing around. You're crazy. What're you doing here? I can't believe our relationship's over. Well, believe it and scram. How did you find me? I ran around and found you. I'm going to tell Constantine and Daphne, but I've got something to tell you. I can't talk while I'm running. It's impossible. - Stop. - How does it stop? I won't let you get rid of this baby. The baby's mine... unless it's his. - What're you doing? - You're a fool. Don't increase the speed! Don't do that to me. How does it stop? It's like a motorway - no traffic lights. If it's a boy... How does this thing stop? Hey, pal! Hey... mercy! This is killing me! What do I press? Have I done something? What have I done? Excuse me... - It's for women only. - What have I done? I know there's someone else. I've got proof, but I don't care about that. I want to know whose baby it is. - Is it his? Mine? Whose? - It's his. - I'm sweating. - You're in a sauna. Okay, okay we'll talk, we won't just fuck. I'm to blame, I know. We can talk about anything you like... world poverty... photosynthesis... the Ionely distance between main arteries. What're you talking about? How do those fucking camels stand the heat? We can talk about the negative aspects of this topic, too. - Alekos? Hi. - Constantine? Any excuses or are we discussing this in 10 years? I wake up this morning and what do I decide? Or rather I don't decide... how life turns out... How does life turn out? How does it turn out, Alekos? You talk, Alekos, I feel terrible. You're not the only one. - This isn't a good place. - Were we looking for one? Are the two of us going to talk about it, or the three of us... or is the slut going to stay? - Should the slut leave? - Yes! Well, spit on me, go on! Don't beg me, it's top of my list of priorities. Just move over a bit, so I don't miss. Asshole, what we had was more important than her. You prick! I've known you since we were six. How could you look me in the eyes all these years? - You think it was easy? - It wasn't? No! Pass me the shampoo. Each day, I tried to find the courage to tell you. And you still haven't. Of course nothing really earthshaking happened. - We didn't... - I saw you. The water's freezing. We shouldn't have gone in. You're unbelievable. I'm serious. I was a black stud in my past life. Well, in this life, you haven't slowed down much. I've always envied you, except for one thing... that you can forget everything in a few seconds. - I don't remember that. - How could you? I was proud I had the memory of an elephant. But now I envy your goldfish memory. Everything would have been different. What are you saying? Speak clearly. Only if I make marriage... not real marriage... - then I stay. - All right. I've got a friend - friend - He'll marry you and we'll still be together. - Constantine? - You know him? I don't. Daphne say Constantine... I not understand. This friend say okay? Oh, mama! He'll fall in love with you right away. What? My mama? I fell in love with her. What could I do? I was losing her. I kept saying that I'd find the courage... and the right moment to tell you. - You'd remember, then forgot. - That's it. Congratulations! We'll never speak to each other again. - You're bitter. - How else should I be? Let's go to the bumper cars. After all that, I can't look you in the eyes. But it was true that I loved you. It's inhuman for a woman to be wanted only for her money. Find a woman who really deserves you. It's tough to find out that her husband is having an affair with her best friend. One thing I'll swear to you. I'll never see Alekos again. I loved you, Alekos. You never realized that. Here are the tapes from Thodoros, and this is from me. - What is it? - You'll need it. - What is it? - Grass. I can't even roll over... how can I roll a joint? As soon as you hear the tapes, it'll come naturally. You've got to beam yourself over here right now. I'm coming, but there's no way... You might change your mind when you hear this. - I don't think so. - Listen and see. It's so great to lie in bed without a jerk on top of you! What did they say at the ministry? The paperwork's finished. - When I get those papers... - She means the citizenship. They're such morons, especially my husband. How did I keep from laughing all these years? I know, and you had to do it with him too. Thank God, mine stopped touching me ages ago. I used to stress him out so he couldn't get it up. There's no more pathetic sight than that! Constantine's different. - He's... - More of a sensitive idiot... I don't know. The last time I felt something... You'll get over it. Men never understand when a woman has an orgasm. All they care about is how many times. They'll boast they did it five times and they might all stink. At some point, I screamed so much, it was so fake... that I was sure he'd realize it, but no. They'll be sorry. You should've seen mine... whenever I pretended to be suspicious. So funny. Make a man feel guilty and sit back and enjoy. If Alekos ever finds out about the will, he'II... He won't. The lawyer's a friend of mine. If Alekos knew I married him because according to the will... I get the inheritance after five years of marriage, he'd not only stick around, he'd probably even get it up. - Maybe. - Very likely. If only there was a camera, so we could see them crying. - Where are you going? - To the bathroom. We need a big, fat joint for this one. - Unbelievable! - Unbelievable. - Are we two assholes or what? - Yes, we are. I was wondering why that waiter at the restaurant went nuts, gaping like that. They were doing touchy-feely under the table. And we were beaming like jerks. - Friends again? - Kismet. - Do you recall? - No, I'm not sleepy at all. I said recall... you know like remember...? - Stella. - Stella! - Which Stella? - The one I met. No, the one I left. This time we'll each have our own Stella. - What's the deal? - I don't know... I'm on another planet. Someone's gotta stay and lock the door. I like this inexplicable joy that I feel. Want to let her rip and talk about some social issue? I sounded like that singer Dalaras there. I feel like a fly on the ceiling looking down. Isn't this a social experience? - What? - This... whole fucking thing. This is great stuff. From Elbasan in Albania, like the poet says. - Which poet? - Engonopoulos. How'd you say that? Elbasan? - What's in it? - Whatever the courier put in. I want to turn myself in to the police. I can be a witness for the prosecution. I'll take a nap. We are in my home, right? - I can't tell. - The ceiling's grey. Grey, eh? I must be laughing like a jerk. - One brandy and we're off. - Where to? There's something keeping me here. Call me. Stella. - Stella! - Stella! Stella and I got together that very same night. I must remember to tell... ...Alekos.
