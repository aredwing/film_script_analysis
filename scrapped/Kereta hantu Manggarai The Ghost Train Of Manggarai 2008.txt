It happened 2 or 3 years ago. I heard the train was operating without anyone inside it and it was between 2 to 4 AM. Heard about it, but never saw it. We are now near the Depok railroad to meet Pak Memet, a guard at the railroad crossing. We want to find out about the Ghost Train. It was 11:30 PM, I saw that he looked disoriented. He told me that he got off the train. But he was in the middle of the tracks. When I boarded the train, everything seemed normal. There were many passengers. Vendors selling food and cigarettes. Nothing unusual. I sat next to an old man reading a newspaper. I borrowed the paper. Here it is. The newspaper was a 1953 edition. -Yes. That's ancient. I'm surprised myself. The paper was fragile, filled with old print, it is not like our papers now. After I explained to the student that there was no train operating at that hour, he fainted. So it was the Ghost Train? Looks like that. Believe it or not, it's up to you. Alright, Pak Memet, thank you so much. How was it? Is it enough? Yes. Hello. Not yet mom. Mom, please don't force me like that. Emily always does this. She switches off her phone. Please stay calm. I will let you know. Stay calm, okay! That girl is so stubborn! Did you call your aunt in Bogor? Emily never reached Bogor. It's been a week and nobody knows where she is. Ros, have you heard about the Ghost Train? Ghost Train? Why? What do you mean? I told my friend about your sister's disappearance. He is into the mystical world. His name is Bobby. He thinks that Emily might have gone missing because of the Ghost Train. What does that mean? I knew you wouldn't believe it. However, there is no harm in opening your mind to it. This is nonsense. I'm just trying to help you. Come in. It's okay. Come! Bob, this is Rossa, my friend. Rossa, this is Bobby. He has a website about the mystical world and occult. What kind of a website is this? I've never heard of it. Like the name of the website itself we collect data about the supernatural, vampires, ghosts, haunted houses, deadly tunnels and others. What's wrong? Why did you bring me here? It is a waste of time. Who knows, Bobby might be able to help you. I'm better off with the police. You have not heard anything from the police, right? My sister is missing not because of any ghost. It's true but I am almost certain that she is missing because she boarded the Ghost Train. One minute, Dod. One more. Bob, there are no pictures. Ki Anom said that the place was clean. Maybe he's with the shrouded ghost. In fact, Ki Anom recited the mantra to our camera. Yes. Dod, Peg, this is my friend Rossa. Hi. -Hi. You have the interviews and testimonies from the witnesses right? Yes, we got them. What about Mamet's interview? Got it all here. But we have the 1953 newspaper. How? That's alright. Write that. Let's draw the picture of the ghosts from Ki Anom's description and put it on the website. Bob, can you help my friend? I can't promise. Okay then, I'll go first. You are very stubborn. Stop interfering in my life. Let me do what I want. I don't like you hanging out with Alex until morning. How do you know this? What's wrong? Why are you fighting? I came here to visit both of you and have a good time. It's Rossa's fault. I Just reached home and she starts with her lecture. She's impossible. She's out of control. I was just trying to remind her... Rossa, give her some space. She just started college. She has to make new friends. I am sure she will be able to take care of herself. You don't know what she's been doing this semester. What do you mean? Can you take care of yourself? Give me that. Mom, you should not pamper her too much. She will feel that she can do anything she wants. Ros, I had a hard time giving birth to Emily. And you know after she was born she was very weak and thin. It was difficult. Poor Emily. But you should not let her have her way all the time. You were always jealous of her. If she goes the wrong way, you just let her be? Keep quiet! Good job. -It's great. Nice title. Ghost Under The Bridge. Yes. You want to see something new? -What? This is the evidence from the people who have actually seen the Ghost Train. Looks like an ordinary train. Four compartments, just like Ki Anom said. He said that initially, everything seems normal. Nothing weird. But when the train moved, he realised that he was trapped. This must be the picture of the ghost. When the train did not stop at any station, he saw that all the passengers were ghosts. How did he escape? He kept running and running until he realised he was running on the tracks. He fainted after that. Do you know where he was after he woke up? He was in Bandung and he wanted to go to Bogor. After that incident, for three days, he was confused and ill. He kept seeing ghosts everywhere. Just like Ririn. And then, she died. Bob, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. You're so bad! I was thinking, from all the Ghost Trains we have compiled, most of them begin from Manggarai station. a train left from Bogor to Jakarta. I heard the train moved without any electricity. No engineer, no passengers. I remember the train number, 469. And this train stopped at Manggarai station. Oh! I see Ki Anom offered me to board the Ghost Train. He has a way of calling the train. Are you interested? I don't think so. Same here. Come on, we need this. This will be good for our site. Ki Anom promised to protect us as long as we follow his instructions. Miss, one cappuchino, please. Sorry, I'm late. I have to go back home. I had a bad dream. I saw this creepy looking girl inside the Ghost Train. That is weird. Of course it's weird. You just had a bad dream. It's not like that. I don't feel comfortable. What is happening to my sister? Why did I dream of the train? I think your sister wants you to look for her. Even though she's not around, I'm still sick of her. Why do you hate her so much? Thank you. Bobby called me. Tonight they will start the ritual at Manggarai station. Ki Anom will be there. We are invited. Can you come? Your friends have gone crazy. Sick! Bobby wants you to see the paranormal. No. You go ahead. I want to look for my sister, not the Ghost Train. Alright. I wanted to help you out but I am scared. Don't fool me. Peggy is coming? I will inform you later. Mom, what are you doing here in Jakarta? What's wrong? You are not happy to see me? You're not well. You should have called me to come and pick you up from the station. That's okay. I took a taxi. Any news about your sister? I don't know where to look for her. Don't stop. Keep looking. I have looked everywhere. Nobody knows where she is. Even Aunt Maya is confused. You can't stop looking for her. Can't you take care of your sister? I am tired. I want to rest. Take my bag inside. Mom. Mom, eat your dinner. I prepared it for you. Should I make you some tea? It's after 10. Let's begin now. According to my vision, the Ghost Train that has gripped the public for the past 2 years, is the same train that was in a terrifying accident five years ago. The train fell into a ravine. There were no survivors. A prankster had placed a steel plate in the middle of the track. The train was derailed and it fell down a cliff 30 meters down. We are here not to look for the extraordinary, but just to look into the mystical world beyond our realm. Once again, we can only try. I need your blood. Why do you need our blood? No argument! A drop of your blood. So how, Ki? The train will come from the north. That's the train you are waiting for. When you are inside the train, do not speak, do not whisper. No loud screams. Don't do any of that. See what is inside your mind. Understand? Remember my words and you will be alright. If you see something that you should not see, close your eyes tightly. Understand? What are you doing? Stop, stop, stop. The ghost in not there. Bob, let's leave now. Why did you sceam? Me? Tari screamed. The ghost was behind me. Ki Anom told us not to scream. What should we do now? We're safe. Enough. It's not easy dealing with the spirits, right? You got out just in time. No more, Ki. Right Ki, I'm not married yet. Bob, what do you think about the Ghost Train? You are crazy. How can you do that? This is my first and my last. That happens when you hang out with the wrong crowd. According to Ki Anom, the train we boarded is the same train that your sister took. Did you see my sister in there? Stop joking around. You have to seek Ki Anom for advice. He's nice. Bring something that belongs to your sister, like an earring, necklace, anything. Bullshit. I would rather believe in the missing person section of the newspaper. Are you coming home? I still have some work to do with Bobby. How about you? You should be okay, right? Alright. See you. -Bye What's up, Bob? Bob, Bob, I saw the ghost from the train. Are you kidding? I am not sure if it was a dream or real. What's wrong with you, Dod? What is this? Your tears. It's blood, Bob. It's coming from my eyes. Don't panic! What's happening to me? Maybe your tearducts tore. Stop panicing. Let me wash my face. Dod, can you stop here? I need to get some medicine for my headache. Wait for a second. What a waste! Why is the tape empty? Hello. What's wrong Peg. What? Doddy died? How did it happen? Okay, okay, I'll go there now. Emily. Find me Rossa, find me. Where are you? I hate you, I really hate you. Emily. Emily. I just came back from the hospital. They are going to bury Doddy today. You know Ros, something is not right about the way Doddy died. It was an accident. It looks like that but I have been thinking. Let him go in peace, I'm really sorry. What were you saying? Forget it. What's wrong? Last night, I heard the sound of a train passing in my room. The whole room began shaking. But your house is not near the tracks. I received a call from Emily. Is she alright? I hope so. I don't know her condition as of now. Dead or alive. Whatever it is, you have to find her. I don't want to be part of this anymore. I saw it myself. What's going on, Bob? Peggy wants to leave. The ghost I saw in the compartment, she caused Doddy's death. I thought Ki Anom opened our sixth sense that night. I'm confused. How can he see the spirits? This has something to do with the Ghost Train. I regret listening to you. This is all because of you. Peg. Peggy. Peg. What do you intend to get from all this? I just wanted people to know more about ghosts. Feel the sensation. There are so many sites like this. And I'm not that ambitious. Are you sure? Why would you force all your friends to board the Ghost Train? Six months ago, I lost my girlfriend in the Ghost Train. What's wrong? Where are you? I'm getting down at the next station. Why? The train is empty. The train did not stop at any station. It's late. Maybe it's the last train. I'm all alone. There should be other passengers here. Bob, I'm getting off at the next station. Wait for me there. She was found in Surabaya. She took the train from Manggarai to another area. Another city? How did she end up there? She started acting crazy. Three days later, she committed suicide. How's Peggy? She is still traumatised. Let her be. Thank you for dropping me off. You want to come in? Next time maybe. I have work to do. I will go first. -Okay. You made a cake? I made this for Emily. We'll eat together when she comes. How do you know Emily is coming back? She called me. She wants me to make some tarts. She's on her way here now. What? The number you have reached is inactive or outside the coverage area. Hello. -I need to talk to you. Sure. -Can you take me to the paranormal guy? Ki Anom? Whatever his name is. He's out of town. He'll be back late tonight. That's okay. Alright. Do you want me to come and pick you up? If that's alright with you. Okay. I'll call you before coming. Okay, thanks. From what you have told me, your mother is traumatised. And, she loves Emily more. I think she loves you. Ros, however bad your relationship was with Emily, she is still your sister. Bob, I can't lie to myself. I feel jealous, sick and hatred towards her. A lot of hatred. I feel ingored among my family. Time can change anything, Ros. Thanks Bob for listening. Ki Anom should be home now. Your sister Emily is in a small house in a village. Where is it? I'm not sure of the exact location. But her condition is critical. Her heart is beating but her soul is wandering elsewhere. What? Medically, she is in a coma. Coma. But is she alright? We have to go and find her Bob. Sure, don't panic. Are you sure your sister took the train from Manggarai? Yes. Her friend told me that she was going to her aunt's house. She dropped Emily at the station. Before Emily left, we had a big argument. Leave me alone. I'm never going to ask help from you again. Listen to me. I want you to leave that guy. He's a drug addict. I don't care. I want you to stop seeing him and I'm sure mom does too. Mom will believe me. You know who is her favorite right? You are the oldest but she always prefers me. I accept you in this house only because of mom. Where are you going? -None of your business. Alright, go. I really hate you. If I knew this would happen, I wouldn't have fought with her. Yes. I'm concerned too. But I'm sorry, this is as far as I can help you. You too. You should be careful. That lady ghost is very violent. You and your friends have entered their world. I will protect you. Which lady ghost is he talking about? Peggy saw the same ghost before Doddy died. That is the ghost from the train. But why? We were not supposed to come out alive from the Ghost Train. So, she is after you now. It looks like that. When she was alive, she worshipped the dark side. How did she die? She died together with the other passengers when the train fell off the cliff. Weird. I am not getting any signal today. Hello. Hello. Where are you, Peg? I am near my house. Can you come to my place now? Can we do it tomorrow? What's wrong? You want to leave our website? Can we talk about this tomorrow when we meet? Bye. What's wrong with your car? I don't know. This is the first time. Bob, we are in the middle of the tracks. I know. Bob, a train is coming. Get out, get out. Open the door, open the door. Ghost Train. Look at this. What is it? -Read the back page. How is she? She's improving. But I'm not sure. Call them now. -Alright Hello. Yes, I put the ad in the paper. Where is my sister? What is the address? And your name? Thank you very much, Arif. I received a call from the person who found Emily. She was found in the Bejong area. What? You want to take me there? Thanks. Arif? -Yes. Can I help you? -They are from the city. They are looking for the missing girl. I am her sister. May I see her? Come to my house. Come. Come in. Emily. Emily. She is conscious but she is still very dazed. Emily, sweetie. You came right on time. What happened? We found her unconscious in the middle of the tracks. Nevertheless, she is willing to drink some of the herbs I have been giving her. People here believe that she was taken by the Ghost Train. Excuse me. We have to take her to the hospital immediately. Hello. Mom, it's Rossa. I have found Emily. I'll bring Emily home as soon as possible. Bob, what's wrong? Peggy died last night. It's only me an Tari now. Emily, what's wrong? Calm down, I'm here now. I feel the evil spirit around your sister. It has spiritual contact with her. Hope you are okay. Thank you. Here. -What is it? A good luck charm to protect you. Sorry, but I don't believe in these things. Just keep it. Thank you. Come. Emily. What's wrong? What's wrong with her? Ros, what's wrong with her? -I don't know, Bob. Emily. Emily. Emily. Emily. Emily. -Emily. Emily. -Emily. Emily. -Emily where are you? Emily. Emily. Emily. Emily. -Emily, where are you? -Emily. -Emily, where are you? Emily. Emily. -Emily. Emily, where are you? Yes, I understand. What's wrong? Just a warning. What warning? The ghost is after those who escaped from the train. And you believe it? Doddy, Peggy, Tari and myself. We made it out of the train because of Ki Anom. But after that... Emily. Bob, you go that way, I will go this way. Emily. Emily, where are you? Emily. Emily. Emily. Emily. Emily. Emily, where are you? Rossa. Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Bobby! Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. I promise to come back with help. Hold on Bob. Emily, let's go. Quickly, Emily. Quickly. Emily. Emily. Hold on to this.
