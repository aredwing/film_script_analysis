Woman: The laid-off factory worker and prime suspect in the Walled In Massacre, Thomas Sullivan, remains at large. Sullivan has shown a violent history including a prior rape conviction. The building's architect Joseph Malestrazza is included among the victims. Currently there are no further leads in the case of the Walled In Massacre. - Woman: Happy birthday! - Man: Happy birthday! Man: All right! I call corner piece! So, Professor, how effective do you think your classes were? Well, I thought I taught Sam how to build things, but whatever makes her happy. Should have known she's not an architect. Sam's a Walczak and we blow shit up. Sam, come here. Incredible... to be the first Walczak to graduate from college. Think fast. There's a gift in both, but you only get to choose one. Dad, come on. That's not fair. Nobody said life was fair. You're 25 now. I'm offering you a deal. Your first demolition project on your own. And if you succeed, you are longer my employee. You'll be my partner. Dad, this is really important for me. Don't you wanna see what's in the blue one? For those, well, I got a little help from Peter. Three weeks touring the architectural wonders of Europe. It's always been your dream, right? And they're for two. Sam: I have a friend who hunts. He'll track a deer for miles, totally quiet, waiting for the right shot. And if his aim is dead on and the deer goes down, he says he gets the biggest rush of his life. That's how I feel when taking down a building... studying blueprints, exploring structure, drawing up demo plans, placing the ammunition. That's all foreplay to me. Pete, are you jealous? Pete: Well, lucky for me, Malestrazza's not alive or I would be jealous. Sam: Okay, I've passed the sign. - Pete: It should be right there. - No, I don't see it yet. People still live there, huh? Yeah, according to your father. Here it is. - Hello. - Sam, I can't hear you. - Hello. - Hello. Can I help you? Hi, I'm from Walczak, the demolition company. I wasn't expecting you so soon. Are you alone? Yeah, for now. Jimmy! I'm Mary Sutter. I take care of the building. Did Mr. Collins tell you the nearest hotel is 50 miles away? Yeah, but it might be easier if I just stay here. Oh, good. Where were you? Just playing with the dog, Mom. Don't worry. This is the lady we were expecting. Already? So why don't you show her around, explain the rules and set her up in room 208? And be polite. Do you smoke? - Well, sometimes. - No smoking in the building. Those are the rules. So this place is in pretty good shape, considering. Yeah, Mom likes to keep everything spotless. She's kind of crazy. Can we... can we get the lights back on? The lights go off every six minutes, you know, to save electricity and stuff. If you spend a day in the halls, you have to hit the switch 240 times. Oh, and never go on the eighth floor. - That's Malestrazza's floor. - The architect lived here? That's the only floor Mom doesn't clean. It's in the rules. Oh, and another rule... don't go on the roof. It's too dangerous. Here it is. Home sweet home. What do you think he'll say? - Sorry. - Malestrazza. When he finds out you've come to blow up his building. Hello, Peter. Yeah, it's insane. I mean, imagine something from Gotham City in the middle of a freakin' marshland. Malestrazza was definitely a genius. This building's amazing. It's like the Bates Motel, only bigger. You know, the kid who still lives here, he talks about Malestrazza like he's still... hey, hello? Samantha! Hello? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were here. Do you like red wine? I also brought some bread and some pasta, some tea. It's not much, but it should do for tonight. Thanks, Miss Sutter. No, please, call me Mary. So how many people still live here? Only four. And this apartment? I'd offer to move you to another, but this is the only vacant one - that hasn't been emptied. - No, it's okay. It's just the last tenants, why did they leave all their stuff? Because no one came to collect it. Do you know the history of this building? No, why? Perhaps it's best you just do your job then. Good night. Sam: November 12, 2008, demolition report number 2893. Originally designed and constructed by one Joseph Malestrazza, the building contains eight individual levels housing 120 residential units. # Silent night # # Holy night # # All is calm # # All is bright # # Round yon virgin # # Mother and child # # Holy infant # # So tender and mild # # Sleep in # # Heavenly peace # # Sleep in # # Heavenly peace # - Morning. - Morning. Sleep well? Yeah, it was very peaceful. You're a very pretty girl. Strange job you've chosen. So I hear constantly. And will you blow up our building on your own? No, I'm an engineer. I analyze the structure, examine the blueprints, determine the best rupture points, type of explosives, then I pass on instructions to the detonation team. Wow, that's quite a big job - for a young engineer. - Family business. Oh, dear. Oh, dear! Howard won't stop fighting with his brother. Denise, I need to introduce you to someone. He's dead set on eating earthworms. Imagine, nothing but earthworms. Listen to me. You remember the eviction notice? What eviction notice? We all have to leave. They're gonna tear down the building. Oh, and who are you, miss? This is what I was trying to tell you. She's in charge of the demolition. Not the most graceful girl, is she? Sam: To bring down a building, you weaken the structure, and gravity will do the rest. People are shocked to learn how little explosive is needed if you understand the building. Sometimes you'll get a structure in perfect shape, beautifully designed, could last forever, and you know when you're destroying it that you're taking along the memories of people who have lived there. Well, buddy, we got a problem here. The wall's 16 feet closer than on the blueprints. That's huge. Shit! Jimmy's voice: "November 12th. Her name is Sam. She's finally here, and she's so pretty. I watch her work, and I wonder if she knows I'm there. Her job is to blow things up. I'd love for her to show me how to take down a building. And I could tell her the whole story about this place. At least what I want her to know. She'd believe whatever I said. " Sorry, no credit cards. Machine's broken. Do you have internet? Sam: You gotta be kidding me. That little liar. Jimmy: Look who's here. - Hey, what's up? - I don't know. Just hanging out. Why? Shouldn't you be in school? No, I do correspondence courses. Mom says it's better that way. Don't you have any friends? Yeah, I've got one and the dog. There used to be a lot more houses like this before, but most of them were torn down. When the factory closed, everyone just took off. This is all that's left. Well, you really know how to impress a girl. You know, I know about Malestrazza, Jimmy. You don't know anything. I know Malestrazza was killed. And I know about the other murders. And you told me he was living on the eighth floor? Why did you lie to me? I tell stories. I don't lie. You lied when you said it was dangerous to go on the roof. Why? Did you go? Listen, tonight, I'll take my mom's passkey. We can visit the eighth floor. We'll see if I'm a liar or not. Okay, we'll see. - It's funny. - What? You dress like a guy and do a job usually... Guys do? You're a dyke, aren't you? Well, you get straight to the point. I'm just curious. Why are you in the closet? Ashamed? No, and I'm not a dyke. Well, that's a relief. - What did you tell her? - Nothing. I said, what did you tell her? Just don't go anywhere near her, Jimmy, please. I love you, you know? She can never take care of you the way I do. What's wrong? Y'all need any help? It'll go faster this way. For you it's a job. For us it's our lives. Never forget that. Did somebody knock? Howard Carter, say hello to our guest. Sit, please. I'll make some tea. And make yourself at home. So how are you enjoying your stay with us? It's lively. You must really love reading. There are exactly 2,301 books on those shelves. They belong to Mr. Malestrazza. Here we are. Sugar? One, please. Yes... he was a very distinguished person. I've heard. But the murders... weren't you scared, too? Well, at the time of the disappearances, I lived here alone and nothing ever happened to me. Do you want to know why? Because I'm a good person. Are you a good person, Miss Walczak? "It was believed that human energy and emotions could be imprinted in the foundations of a structure. Fear and death were considered to be the most powerful elements to increase a building's longevity. The Egyptians practiced this by immuring sacrificial humans. " Ready for our little trip? Malestrazza was a sort of crazy genius. He didn't work for money. He worked out of passion. Really secretive too. Never let anyone take his picture or anything. How do you know so much? - I was born here. - Come on. I read things, and I stole some books from Denise. Oh, yeah? Me too. Which ones? "Primitive Beliefs in Architecture. " Interesting. I know. You know, genius or not, he could have built a damn elevator. Around the time of the murders, there used to be a tenant named Tom Sullivan who worked at the factory. One day he got fired because the bosses found out about a prior rape conviction. That was enough to make him a suspect. So the tenants called the cops, but when they came to question him he was gone and they found nothing. No blood, no signs of struggle, nothing. Rumors were going around that Sullivan was using secret passages, that the mirrors in the apartments were double-sided. The tenants were terrified, and the disappearances continued. Always mysterious. This is it. Malestrazza's... where they found a few of the bodies, even his and maybe even where his ghost still hides today. No one could ever accuse you of subtlety. And they wouldn't have found anything if Sullivan hadn't made his one mistake. Oh, yeah, and what was that? He kidnapped that little girl. Julie. Wait. Not the little girl from my apartment. Jimmy: What he didn't know is that Julie's father just got her a puppy. Smart little dog. Your dog? Yep, and when the cops entered Malestrazza's place... The dog ran in ahead of them. And? And we follow the dog. Stay close if you don't wanna get lost. It's a real maze in here. Malestrazza didn't have any furniture, only books. He lived like a monk. Watch your step. This is where they found Julie. Sam: My God. That's where they found Malestrazza. His face was almost ripped off because of the cement. My mom was the one to identify him. Mary? Why? She knew him well, I guess. The cops found 16 bodies in the building, but I'm sure there was more. Has to be. That's where they found my dad. Mom was there when they dug his body up. She was pregnant with me at the time. They say she hasn't been the same since. Shut up! Wait outside! Go! Jimmy, I'm sorry. Why? 'Cause I lost my mom when I was a baby. I know how it feels. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. So what did Malestrazza look like? - You'll see. - Right. - Shit! - What? No, nothing. It's a drawing. Told you you'd meet him. It's Malestrazza. Maybe his spirit never left, and he's hiding behind this wall. Very funny. Hey, come here! Jimmy! Cut it out. Who is it? Jimmy! Who are you? No, no, come on. Don't do this. No, come on. Don't do this. Shit! Jimmy: Sam, where are you? Jimmy! Where are you? Jimmy? Jimmy! Jimmy! - Girl: Samantha! - Who are you? Jimmy, where are you? Girl: #One, two # # He's coming for you # # Three, four, cement will pour... # - Jimmy! - # Five, six, it fills up quick # # Seven, eight # # You're too late... # - What do you want? - # Nine, ten # # He'll wall you in. # Sam, it's me. Where were you? Calm down. Follow me. Come on, hurry up. Come on. It's okay. It's over now. I'm losing my mind, Jimmy. I'm hearing voices. Show me your knee. I'm fine. Come on. It's my fault you fell. Is that better? You look even prettier that way. You should keep your hair down more often. Jimmy. What are you doing? What do you want from me? Poor girl. Girl: You're the one, Samantha. You're our savior. Help! Help! Help! Help me! Somebody, help! Help! Let me out of here! - Hey. - Hey. You didn't think you could get away that easily, did you? - Did you do that? - What? That? No. Look, you shouldn't leave your door unlocked. Mr. Burnett, open up. Listen, there's no use pretending you're not in there. How can I help you? Did you have fun last night in Malestrazza's apartment? Trying to scare Jimmy and me won't change anything. Burnett: Jimmy... interesting kid. You think I scare Jimmy? The government ordered this building to be destroyed. There's nothing anyone can do about it. There's no point in harassing me. He gave that to you? Burnett: Little souvenir. He offered me this apartment the day he learned how shitty my disability pension was. So did you live here when the murders happened? The cops thought I was the killer. I did two months' time because of my good looks. I was the perfect suspect. Leave me alone. Why's he still here? Maybe he doesn't have anywhere else to go. Huh. Well, let's go check out Malestrazza's place. - You a fan of his? - I don't know. I haven't decided. He's growing up so fast, reads everything he gets his hands on. So full of stories. He gets his temper from me, but I understand. He's lonely. But soon he'll be free of this. We all will. Then you'll have peace... just like I promised. - That was close. - Mm-hmm. Oh, shit! Mary! Mary, can you hear me? So you're the legend. Sam: Find anything? Like a secret passage? You gotta be kidding me. Sam: Jesus, this was definitely not in the blueprints. Pete: Should we climb down? Sam: Beats spending the night up here. Be careful, Sam. Sam: I can't believe it. The little shit. He's been watching me in my bathroom. You all right? - Look. - What is it? Okay, let's get out of here. Is going through other people's garbage also part of your job description? It was the dog's fault. I threw him his ball in the garbage room and he hit the switch on the wall. That's how I found the passage. I didn't do anything. You were watching me from there, weren't you? And you were in on it with Burnett the other night to scare me. We'll deal with this later. Go to your room. Sam: This your husband? Yes. He was a writer. Malestrazza offered us this place so he could finish his novel. He said there's nowhere like it on earth. He was right. Sam: Forgive me for being so direct, but why did you stay? Most tenants left. A few stayed 'cause they had nowhere else to go. It's better here for us. We're close to him. Close to your husband? But part of me doesn't believe he's gone, and it's better for Jimmy. The spirit of his father is helpful to him. I took the caretaker's job just to be around him. Malestrazza thought it would last forever, this building. Probably would have. You're our savior, Sam. In a few days, there will be nothing here but dirt. Not even a headstone. Pete: Look, I do know that you're overwhelmed and things are really crazy, but there's one way to make it better. Let's take the trip. Now we could go tomorrow. You need to get out of here, Sam. We'll leave in the morning. Sweetheart. - Okay? - Mm-hmm. What? Nothing. Shh. It's probably Jimmy. - Why would he do that? - I don't know, but who else? Knew him my whole life. He was the best friend I had. Jimmy, did you do this? - Do you really mean that? - Well, who else did it? What difference does it make now? My only friend is dead, and my house is gonna be destroyed. You're just gonna leave with that guy and forget all about us. It's okay. We're used to being forgotten here. Listen, I'm not gonna forget about you. You don't give a shit about me. I'm just a crazy little boy. No, you're not. Prove it. Sam: " The building is vulnerable to precision implosion. Suggested volume of detonation... spread equally at the preset rupture points. Your very truly, Walczak & Sons. Finished? I don't know. This place is still hiding something. The blueprints are wrong. I mean, nothing corresponds. Okay, look, I find this place as fascinating as you do, but waking up with a dead dog as a houseguest makes me think perhaps it's time to go. - Hey. - Hey. I wanted to apologize for before and all the other stuff I did. Don't worry about it. Pete: Hi, Jimmy. Sorry about your dog. For you. I stole it from Denise's place. To tell you the truth, I found the secret passage from this. Thought you'd might want it. Is this what I think it is? Handwritten by the man himself. There's everything about the building... his theories, philosophies also. Check out the drawings. No wonder the blueprints were off. There's so much space in the center of the building. Of course. Of course. Malestrazza was inspired by the Egyptian pyramids. His apartment on the eighth floor must be the summit, and the basement the foundation. Do you think we'll find any more bodies? 'Cause if it's like the pyramids, then there has to be a tomb somewhere. Which would make sense if it's behind this wall. The Egyptians would always make sure that sunlight could shine down into a pharaoh's tomb. So there's gotta be some sort of access to it from the roof if it exists. I'll go look. Look, I don't trust that kid. Jimmy. Jimmy! Sure he came up here? He knew about it all along. Okay, come on. Let's get out of here, come on. Jimmy: Help, I'm down here! Jimmy. - Jimmy! - Sam, help! - Shit - I fell down. I think I broke my leg. Hold on, we're coming. Okay, I'm gonna go down. Grab the other end. - Okay. - Jimmy: Sam, help! - I'm bleeding. - We're coming! - Good? - Yeah. No no, wait. I'm not gonna be able to lift both of you back up. Shit. - I'll go down. - No no. - Jimmy: Sam. - We're coming! Come on, it's the only way. - Good? - Yeah. You okay? No! No! No! Peter? Who are you? Man: I think you know very well who I am. Sam: Malestrazza? But you're supposed to be dead. Man: Really? Then I guess hell just got a little bit nicer. Sam: Where's Jimmy and Peter? Answer me! Jimmy: Help, Sam, I'm hurt! Jimmy: Help, Sam, I'm hurt! Sam: Where's Peter? Sam: Don't come near me! Jimmy: " Dear Sam, I love you and I can't let you leave me. You'll have to live with your genius for a while, but don't worry, I'm watching over you. He won't hurt you as long as you obey me. If not, I'll kill you, just like my best friend. I'll teach you how to love me. I'll always love you. " Jimmy! No. What are you doing?! Jimmy, come back! Jimmy! Mary: Happy anniversary, darling. He will suffer. I promise. Where's Peter? Please tell me where Peter is. One for every soul. Do you really think a simple factory worker could have orchestrated those deaths? Jimmy! Jimmy, get me out of here! Now! This can't be real. This can't be real. It's really quite simple. The boy gives us an order and we obey him. If not, he'll make sure we suffer. Trust me. He has a lot of imagination. I want you to dance, both of you. - Now kiss! - What? - I wanna see how you kiss, Sam. - No way! Stop. Enough. Nice show, but don't touch her again if you know what's good for you. Jimmy, Jimmy, listen to me. You can't leave me down here. Of course I can. I can do whatever I want. I'll leave the trapdoor open so that when you look at the sky, you'll think of me. Keep the walkie on so at least we can be close that way. I'll check in on you soon. How do I get out of here? Wait, is the garbage room behind here? - Mom. - Yes, dear. Can I talk to you about something? Sure. What? How do you know when someone really loves you? That girl really had an effect on you, didn't she? Tell me. When you're willing to sacrifice everything for someone. There's no great love without it. Do you love me? Of course. Then why did you sacrifice me for a dead man? Jimmy, can you hear me? Sam: Talk to me. I know you're listening. I'm hurt, Jimmy. My ankle's really swollen. I need a doctor or at least medicine. Please. I know there's some ether and rubbing alcohol in my medicine cabinet. Please, Jimmy, I'm in pain. Remember the other night when you bandaged my knee? That was great. I loved it. You took really good care of me then. You know, if we could be together, I could give you so much more. Do you wanna know what you're missing? Okay. Jimmy, this is for you, okay? Do you feel guilty? He came here for you. Your wall has finished drying. I've been trapped here since the day the police arrived and everything was ruined. Three weeks after hiding here I discovered my only means of escape was sealed up. It was Mary. She found me out. Mary fooled everybody. She got to Sullivan's body and exchanged his dental records; Put my ring on him so the silly police believed he had escaped and I was dead... case closed. But here I am, forever a prisoner. That won't work. When you finally accept you're trapped here indefinitely, we can progress to a solution. Come on! What was that? Sounds like the pipes. No, it sounded more like an explosion. It's the pipes. They're falling apart. Jimmy. Help. The Lighthouse of Alexandria, the Temple of Artemis destroyed; Gardens of Babylon, the Colossus of Rhodes destroyed; The Seven Wonders of the World demolished, burned, all except the Great Pyramids and my buildings. Because both the Egyptians and myself immured human beings in our foundations. - Jimmy? - All that counts is energy. The world found its light only through the birth pains of agony and murder. Suffering is a journey to purity, and death is the midwife to eternal existence. You're completely insane. Would you like to be eternal, Samantha? Eternal. You've made a big mistake trying to escape, a big one. I'm gonna punish you real bad. No more water, no more food, no more light. You can think better about your mistakes in the dark. Jimmy, what's going on? Mary, Mary, get me out of here! Mary! Please. No! Please. Mary, please! Do you realize what you've done, Jimmy? What were you thinking putting her in there? Do you want me to go to jail or some asylum and you in an orphanage? Is that what you want? Jimmy! What were you thinking? All those lives. All those lives. This was for them. Not you. Jimmy. I know you're there. Talk to me. Jimmy: Would you sacrifice everything for me? Sam: Yes, of course I would. Jimmy: I'm not stupid. Sam: No, believe me. I'll sacrifice everything... everything except my life. Because if I die, then we'll never get to be together. I'll be gone forever. I'll just be a ghost, a ghost that'll haunt every minute of your life, every single dream you have. When you wake up, you'll realized that I'm not there next to you because you didn't let me live. The one who'll suffer most out of anyone is you, Jimmy. If I'm gonna learn to love you, you have to let me live. It's too late. The explosives people are here. Trust me. They already think it's by chance you're here, that it was only the boy's idea. It's your choice, Jimmy. Sam, Sam! Can you hear me? If you wanna keep any of this, take it now. Well, what about Sam? You should have thought about that before, young man. We can't just leave her. Oh, yes, we absolutely can. We can't let her out now. That girl doesn't care about you and you know that. I hope you know what you're doing. This building's alive. It has its own arteries, its own blood supply. Just like you. All that's missing is a soul. Mary: I don't know. She seemed fine. She left in quite a hurry with her friend. Man: Peter was gonna surprise her and take her straight on the trip she got from Dad. Still, you think she would have called or something. Too bad she's gonna miss her first demo. We'll be fine, ma'am. You can go now. Help! Save your energy, Samantha. I still need you. Help! Patrick, Vincent! One must always bury people alive. - No! - It is essential for the victim to suffer. Flesh and foundation must make one. The creator must fuse with his creation. I won't let you kill me! No, child, this is my tomb. You're supposed to kill me in it. Now what are you waiting for? Do it yourself. You don't understand what we need you to sacrifice, not some... worker's suicide. You're the one I chose to kill me. - I've waited so long. - No. - Kill me. - No. Listen to the anger, the rage in you. Killing me is the only way to free yourself. - Kill me, Samantha. - No! - Come, child, do it. - Do it for us. - Kill me. Go free. - Do it, Samantha! - Go free. - Girl: Free us all, do it, do it. Thank you, Samantha. Please, where are you taking me? My boys. - Ma'am, calm down. - What about my boys? Building is evacuated. All entrances are sealed. Detonation begins in three minutes. Jimmy. Jimmy, it's all right. Please. Please. - Sam. - Jimmy, Jimmy, no! Stop everything. Sam! Jimmy! Sam? Stop the countdown! Jimmy! No! No! Jimmy. I'm sorry. What's happening here? Oh my God! Sam! What did you do to her? Call the paramedics. Sam, Sam! What did you do to her? Man: Sam! I'm sorry. Jimmy: You're free now, Sam. I'm sorry. Jimmy: I love you. Sam: In his lifetime, Malestrazza designed 27 buildings, all of which are still standing. This one he called his masterpiece. There are no current plans to demolish it.
