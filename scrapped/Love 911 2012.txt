 

                        Banchangkko [Bandage/Band-aid] Kang-il, calm down Get out of my way. Kang-il ah! I said get out my way, you bastard! What are you doing? You can't do this. Doctor Kim. Ji-young ah. Get up, let's go home, huh? Ji-young ah... He collapsed again? Argh my head. .. Shouldn't you go for a check-up? No thanks If word about me going for a check-up on my head spreads, my career as a doctor would be over, Don't you know? Just let me take a look! [Distressed screaming in the background] [Distressed screaming in the background] Why is she like this, huh?! Why is she like this, huh?! Youngjoo ah What's going on? She underwent MVR using a Mechanical Valve two years ago, and started complaining of a severe headache a few hours ago. Have you checked her medical records? That... because she just arrived not too long ago... You haven't even checked that yet? Oh that... It's better to wait till after the test results come out and let the neurosurgeon confirm Why should we hand over a MVR patient to a neurosurgeon? Do you think I'm not as good as Dr. Jang? I'll do it. Sure. What now? What 'what now'? I gotta use this chance to impress the Director. Hey! Bastard, do you think you're the Head? Coming so late? How's the injury? Ah, that bastard. Not like it's been only a day or two, and he still acts like that. These are from a beating, aren't they? Obviously. Oh, please just help me call! Shouldn't we report this? We have to give statements and stand as witness, it's complex. From long ago, lawsuits are best to be avoided. Guardian, Mr. Kim Soo-hyun? Yes? How is it now? When did these symptoms begin? Err... since a few days ago, persistently... It doesn't seem like too serious a problem, just take the medicine as prescribed. Ah, I see. Since she's already like that Will the medicine be able to cure her? There were no anomalies in the check-up. In such cases, a temporary shock or Stress-induced seizures could have caused a relapse. But still, a mental checkup - If you're not going to listen to the doctor, why come to the hospital in the first place? What? I'm saying she can be discharged after she wakes up. Hey, Doctor. You gotta at least give me a proper explanation, don't you? If you're so worried, go and find a Taoist priest or whatever to practice on her! Where the hell - Let's just let her take the prescribed medicine first. In some cases, the patient will get better after a few days' rest. It was him... He was the one the one who started it... Ah, for real... Why do we have to get called for emergency rescue? If we've to go, let's just go. Ah, damn it. What's this? This asshole, why are you always walking around half-naked? We have a demure woman here. Demure woman? Where? You mean her? Hyung, if you're feeling tired, take some vitamins or something. A demure woman without an 'S' line is a disaster. Disaster... This year even boilers come in 'S' line. What's bad about our Hyun-kyung? She's kind-hearted... She's kind-hearted, you asshole. That's it? Yeah .. Please be alert. We still gotta work. I'm not someone you can deal with so easily. Uh ...? Aish. Come on, let's go! What great weather to save people! Excuse me. Get out of the way. Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you. Please help me! What's the matter? I went to the emergency room for awhile, when I returned, she was like that... How long has she been like this? Not long... Please, save her! Yes. Please let her go first. Put her down. How is it? I said, how is she?? Seems like an aneurysm rupture. To reach such an extent, there must have been symptoms quite some time ago. Why didn't you bring her to the hospital earlier? Hey, Jung Kang-il! Follow him. Excuse me, can you please take a look. It's chaos in there! Let go of me! What's up with this person? Stop it! Ah, damn it! Get over here! Please calm down! Okay? Let go. Let go, asshole! Sir, Doing this will not benefit yourself at all. Are you on their side too? What? Seems like you're all on the same team, you son of a bitch! Stop trying to stop me, you son of a bitch! Are you all crazy?! Her brain was full of blood and you just sent her away? Because there were signs that she'd been assualted... Are you a fucking cop?! If you're a doctor, then act like one! Just treat illnesses! Why pass judgements on your own? I'll suspend you two first, both of you turn in your namecards. Lie low for the time being. So we ... The surgery next week... Is the surgery the problem now? Right now the Ethics Committee is kicking up a big fuss and asking me to sack the both of you! To keep it short, just prepare for the trial. Trial? What do you mean? What do you think will happen to us? Worst case you'll be handed a warning, and pay a fine. As for Mi-Soo, it'll be a bit more problematic. Me? What's wrong with me? Your doctor's license could be suspended for about three years. Three years?! If it's three years, I can't carry out surgeries... My career in the surgical department will be over, Unni! Misdiagnosis, ignoring the guardian's opinions, as well as forcefully advising a patient's discharge from hospital. If the patient's condition deteriorates, you may even lose your license for good. He's a freaking thug, okay? A thug like him, who knows what he'd done to her outside? What do we know? What's more, he came back to the hospital, intimidating and threatening us with a knife He even broke the nose of the firefighter who was trying to negotiate! Hey, you think you can find that firefighter? Find him for? To make him sue his attacker. Sue? If he's judged to have a violence tendency, the trial could favour us. How's that so? You said there were signs that his wife had been physically abused, didn't you? Those marks were a result of taking some medicines. It has nothing to do with violence... The possibility alone that he could have assaulted his wife is enough to put the plaintiff in a disadvantageous position. What do you think? Are you confident in being able to get the firefighter to sue him? Say, things like fate, it's SO amazing. Isn't it? What do you you want? Oh, actually. I'm someone like that (a doctor). Hmph, so what? I mean... I am an emergency room director, can't get away with it... By the way, that facial injury looks pretty bad. It's the wound from that day .. So, how ... Have you sued the attacker? Sue? Yes, sue! We will give you a medical certificate, a very spruced up one, how about that? No, thanks. Look. Since you've been assaulted, you should of course, sue him. Don't you think so? I don't have any thoughts of doing that, so you can go back. Don't be like this. Just make a complaint, please. Thugs like that bastard, they should be isolated from society! Look. You really don't know why that man did what he did? Huh? You really think I don't know what you're trying to do? Aish... But he should at least pay the price for his violence, right?! Hey! His wife's life is hanging on the balance, who the hell in his shoes wouldn't go mad? Aish. Tsk. You try and push the blame on him, and see what'll happen. I won't do nothing. Aish, really. By closing an eye to this, it's not following the law of society anymore..! And what's more, you're a civil servant... Come and try me again, you... That's it. What? Seduction. What? The way I see it, That method won't work. You know how Yang Gwibi (one of the four ancient beauties of Ancient China) and Cleopatra unnie changed history? Crazy bitch .. Let's see. That weird? Yang Gwibi? Even passing dogs will laugh. Oh .. That's odd. Says here it's the trend this spring. Wipe it away. Let's go! Those bastards are here. They're here, they're here. Give it your best shot... Check on the chicks and the drivers first! What the hell is this .. Gather, gather, gather! Oh, thanks. Where did you come from? Oh, what a coincidence! Why are you always lurking around? What do you mean 'lurking'? I was just on the way home but saw the road blocked and wanted to help you guys out. Anyway, this is also considered a type of fate. Let's get along well. I'm Go Mi-soo. Hmph. It doesn't have to be so distant between us, does it? Huh? It does. Not speaking formally and being so rude, is this your concept?! Aigoo... What I meant was, isn't it your job to help others? Right now, I need need your help desperately. I'm not gonna sue. Thought I'd already made myself clear? I'm not talking about that. Please don't misunderstand me just because I pestered you about something like that. It's not something too difficult. I believe you can help me with this. What is it? I know asking for such a favour may be a little rude. And a little embarrassing as well... What's going on? With me... Let's date? (Caw caw sound) (raven) Fuck! I'd just- Aigoo. Ouch! Really annoying son of a bitch Come here, come here. What's the next plan? History has shown, if seduction doesn't work, use intimidation. Say, what in the world is she doing? Hey, look. Hey, she looks pretty, just go and take a look. Don't think she's pretty? Go closer and take a look! Stop fooling around, get down quickly! Does she have a hearing problem or what? HEY! Still not stepping down?! Oh! Hey, hey, hey catch her! Catch her! She's not gonna die. Oh Oh, Mom! MOM!!! Aish. Don't look, don't look! Hey. This is a life and death situation, you think that's so important a problem?! This is a problem for me, a big problem! Don't look! How am I gonna help you if I don't look? Even so, don't look! Oh..! Ugh. DON'T LOOK, YOU SON OF A BITCH! So You weren't thinking of committing suicide? Are you crazy? Suicide? This lady... are you dissing us? Then why were you causing trouble there? Is climbing over the bridge a sin? Who said that climbing the bridge is wrong? Giving false report. So what happens now? What else? You've to pay the fine. How much is it? Not much. About 2 million won? What ... What type of a fine is 2 million won?! If you feel wronged, you can file a lawsuit against us. But Oppa, can't you just give me a discount for the fine? This young lady here, you think you're buying clothes in Dongdaemun? What the hell do you mean by 'discount'? Please~? [in cutesy voice] Can't you give a teeny-weeny bit of discount? Aish. Hey, why did you hand her over to the police? Yeah, hyung you're too much. Hey, enough! This type of crazy bitch should be isolated from the community. Look at this temper of yours... Ah, it feels refreshing! [laughs] Aigoo ya. Looks good? Eat, eat, eat. I'm not telling you this because of blind dating, I'm not telling you this because of blind dating, but because I see you as my younger sister. Me too, Oppa. You're like a real brother to me! But what are we going to do now? Since a long time ago, in dating relationships, you have to learn to play hard to get. Play hard to get? Yes! Sometimes you give, sometimes you take. Give and take. That way, the men will feel anxious and restless. What's important is, If you give two, you can only take one. If you take back both, he'll run away! Exactly! Wow, she learns fast! No matter what, a woman should still be slightly reserved, so that men would be attracted to her, get it? But how am I supposed to get close to him again? He... HATES me! Attack him directly, so that he can't escape! Legally. So, how?! That, I do not know. 'Year 2012: Recruiting civil service officers.' Oppa, about that fine... Can I perhaps replace it with community service~? Of course! To the honoured civil service officers of the Republic of Korea, for taking the first steps, We offer our warmest congratulations. (Your volunteerary spirit to the society...) Say, why the hell did you drag me into this?? Anyway, it's not like you can return to the hospital. As soon as I've gotten him aboard, we can leave the scene. So what now? You got another plan? What 'plan'? Look closely. Omo! He's completely 'menbong'! (mental breakdown) Saw that? You saw that? It's over! Now, GAME OVER! That crazy woman, how can they accept someone like that to be a civil servant?! As if I'd know! Our captain, once he heard that she's got a doctor's license, he nearly freaked out of joy. Keep quiet, will you? Hey, look at the one next to her. That one with the 'S' line next to her. Who is that? Look, dude! Where? The third, the third. Give it a try. I said, give it a try! Eh? You said you're a doctor, right? Like this? Wider. You've not learned CPR? Hey~! You're really... Aish. What can you teach using a piece of doll like this?! Take that away! Yes, Sir. Okay, don't be nervous, try it calmly. Since you're a doctor, we should do it educationally and realistically. Go on. Starting from the chest compressions... What are you talking about? Should check the airway first before doing CPR! But still, between men and women... There's life hanging in the balance and you- Do you think this training is a fucking child's play?! Please Please, go on, do it! You dare to not do it... Hey, Rescue team! Hurry, prepare for dispatch. Why of all times... HEY! Give me my money back, you son of a bitch! What's that all about? I said bring me my money! He said he's being owed four months' worth of salary. And he won't move an inch from there till he gets the money. So? Just give him his money! It was given! So, what the hell is the matter? Whenever he drinks, once a month, he causes trouble. That son of a bitch. Jung Kang-il! Go up and take a look. Shh This motherfucker... You wanna die? Hey, you can't use that to hit! Ajussi! Even if you jump from there, it will not kill you. [Drunk singing] Ajussi! What the hell?! This motherfucker... It's still bright and early, why did you drink so much? Money, money, money's rolling. Up your fucking arse! This fucker. [sighs] Let's go down! Before I get my money, I won't even get down if I die! Let's not tire everyone else, and get down quickly. Don't come near me. I'll jump! Oh! I'm jumping! Really jumping! [gasps] Aish, son of a bitch. Gave me a scare. Heol! (Bullshit) Are you always like that? What? Putting you life on the line every time? This job, it's always been like that. I meant, I know that it's the nature of this job. But earlier, wasn't that a little exaggerated? Fucking exaggerated, this crazy bastard. Ey... Really. Hurry and wash up, let's go! Captain! For the new recruits here, isn't there any welcoming party of sorts? Yeah! Let's do it this way, Captain! Since we have no shifts tomorrow. Company dinner! Company dinner! Do whatever you guys want. I'm getting off work first. Looks like the team isn't very united? Son of a bitch... Have some meat. Aren't doctors a busy bunch? Er yeah, we're quite busy. Then why be a civil officer? There are not many benefits. So why?? No, I mean... Wanting to do some community service of sorts... Our hospital has some partnership with the Red Cross. So there are voluntary roles we have to fulfil. And since we have to do it, we decided to grit our teeth and suffer a little, and applied to Africa and Cambodia. But there were no more available slots. So, inevitably, we ended up volunteering domestically. Wow... Looks like our lucky stars fell from the skies! Right. She seems great at spewing bullshit. Ah! Toilet. Here, soju! Huh? Now! Have a glass with the lucky star? What the hell are you guys up to? What the hell are you talking about? There's nothing like that. So why are you following me around like a leech? Following you around? Me?! On you? Yeah, is it not? Look. It seems that you're mistaken about something. The reason I'm following you around is because I like you! [claps] Bravo! Bravo!!! [applause and cheers] Hongjae-dong! Let's go, let's go! Uh ... Cab fare Cab fare Don't you live in the Hongjae-dong area too? No. YES, you do!. Yeah... Oh. Bravo! We can go together. Let's go! Me too! Me too! What are you talking about now. You live in Jamsil! I'm going to a friend's house! Friend's house! We're leaving! Dong-bu, second street. Aish. Where do you live? I'm from Hongjae-dong too~ Aish. Then you should have taken the cab just now! But I just feel like I haven't drank enough. Feel like having another drink. Wanna go for another round? Hmph. Why must I drink with you? For a young man and woman to drink, what good reason is needed? I have no reason to drink with you at all. Oh, forget it! Forget it! Forget it if you don't wanna drink. Makes my blood boil. Think you're so great? To reject someone like me? Makes me speechless! Don't get it at all... Excuse me... I'm already awake. [panting] Do you have some type of illness? No. Then why did you faint? Beats me. But where were you planning to go? What do you mean where... Of course we were going to the emergency centre! What ER... Pulse is slow... It's Syncope. (temporary loss of consciousness and posture) What? What 'copy'? It means 'fainting'. 'Fainting'. When people are stressed, their blood pressure may drop suddenly, causing them to pass out sometimes. No matter what, how can someone pass out like that just due to stress? Hey, I'm a doctor. And a professional in stuff like this. Touch me. I said you can touch me. No fever. Of course, it has nothing to do with having a fever or not. It's got to do with the heart. Is it? Come on. Let's go grab a drink. This woman, Hey! What are you, crazy? In such a situation, and you still want to drink? Don't you know that after fainting, we need to eat something to replenish the sugar level in our blood? I feel that you pretended to faint so that you can have another drink. Why doesn't this man seem to believe others? It's not like that. Are you serious? Aish, fuck. I'm getting stressed again. Aish. -Are you okay? -Ah! Aish! -Are you okay? -Ah! Let go! Let go! Oh ... Oh .. Oh Oh Yes! Done! Drink! Drink! All the way! One shot! You did good! Team member Jung Kang-il. Awoo.. Can't even hit you. But, what the fuck are you wearing? It doesn't go with your looks at all. Is this avant-garde? Ignorant? You dare say I'm ignorant? I'd just- Who dresses like that these days? [laughing] Just stay here... Just have a bowl of ramyun before going, huh? I don't think it's as simple as just having a bowl of ramyun? No matter how hard you try, you're wasting your effort. A 'no' means 'no'... Why not? Do you think love can be successful just from trying hard? Of course! That's why it's a 'no', you idiot! So, I'm asking you, why not?! (Dogs barking) Our idiot here has woken up all the dogs in the neighborhood! (Dogs barking) Aigoo! Trouble! (Dogs barking) Asshole! What a spectacle! Oh... Why is he like that? No idea. What the hell is this? I say, Ahjussi! Is that your wife? What are you staring at? You wanna fight?! What? What did you say! Motherfucker. Aish... Son of a bitch, behave properly after you drink! You wanna die, huh? What are doing to a drunken man? Who the hell are you? Ouch! Catch hold of her! Really, where did this bitch come from? Where do you think you're going? Move! Ah, this bitch. I said move out of my way! This crazy bitch! Oh? Huh? Hey, get up. Get up! YAAAA! You! You! You're really! You're dead meat! Let go! Let go, let go, let go... Aish Just- Put it down, quickly. Put it down. Why do you keep holding it? Let go! You should be the one letting go! Put it down, quick! Where are those bitches? That bastard, son of a bitch... There! Ah... There she is! Stay. Hyung-nim! You've worked hard. Worked hard your ass. Where's the report? A medical report? Here it is. These crazy assholes... This bitch... I'd just-! Aigo, this retard... What joke are you saying? You can take you time to reflect on yourself in prison! Prison? Prison? This son of a bitch! Do you need 18 weeks to recover from this? Who do you think you're trying to bluff? This motherfucker. Hyung-nim, can't you see this? I saw it, I saw it.But still, 18 weeks?! Sir, please just put it down. Huh? Ah! Wait... Ow... These faggots... Don't be so soft on him, just subdue him! Ouch! Take that hand away! Who the hell are you? Who is this? I'm his friend. Aigoo... what's going on? I don't know, I don't know... What the fuck are you doing! What the hell is going on you motherfuckers? Hello. That bastard, what's he up to these days? That's what I'm asking too. I don't wanna see him like that, take him home, quick. What are you doing? Take him here, quickly! Let's go, Kang-il ah. Come on, get up! Get up! Not that woman! She can't leave before an agreement is reached. Agreement? She bit off that bastard's ear. What does she do? Why's she so cruel? Based on looks, that bastard's more like a dog, but he's the one who got bitten! Unbelievable... Ya, put this down. Let it go! This is mine, you motherfucker! This kid has gone crazy, huh? What the hell is this? I don't know. He's always obsessed with weird things... Aargh! You fell down again? Aigoo... Damn machine I ought to throw it away, huh? Should I buy you another hole(?) chair? Hole chair? Yes You know those huge stores that sell chairs with a hole in the center? It'd be more comfortable when you sit on it, right? That's right. Why didn't I think of it? But that said, you can get pregnant if you sit on that? You have gatherings everyday and have night shifts all the time. And you always come home drunk. How can I get pregnant? Should we try and make one today? Huh? Won't you be late? It's okay even if I'm late. Damn! why are you so surprised? Oh, the smell... Aish. How much did you actually drink? I don't know. I remember drinking a couple of bomb shots. I thought you hated that woman? Then why did you drink with her? I know, right. Hmm suspicious... Suspicious. But... what's that? Aish, fuck You don't remember? Aigoo, that Go Mi-soo... What are you going to do about her now? She's gonna have a criminal record at such a young age. Don't even talk about continue being a doctor. Perhaps she can even forget about marriage? Why are you here? Oh, hello. I'm looking for someone. Yesterday there was a woman who came in the wee hours of the morning. Height's about... Oh! Last night! Why are you here only now? Quite fine looking! Hey! Go Mi-soo! OH! UFO! Idiot. Does one usually fall for something like that? Give it back! Watch the road! The road! Who is this? So what if you know? Don't tell me it's... A lover?? No. What do you mean 'no'? Then perhaps your wife? What's up with this mood... She's really your wife? It's none of your business. Then why didn't you say that you're a married man? Why should I? 'Why should I'?! Wow, this ajussi is really funny! Woah! Are you divorced? What? It's weird! If you had a wife, you would have told someone like me who's pestering you since the beginning! And, if you had such a pretty wife, Why would you want to work yourself to death? No, that's weird too. If you're divorced, you wouldn't carry your ex-wife's photo around, would you? Stop with the wild guesses, and just go home quietly. Perhaps She's dead? Damn, you're really going all the way huh? Brake! What? Brake! Are you okay? It's bleeding! It's bleeding! What's the safety belt for... What the fuck is this? Can this be considered a 'safety belt' at all? Stop driving this piece of trash! Excuse me, is Detective Bang Je-soo in? Right? It's bereavement, isn't it? Now, finally the picture is clear. Since you know it now, please stop bothering me, okay? Nowadays, it's not a disadvantage to be married before. I mean... You're young, pretty, and have a bright future ahead of you. Why would you want someone like me? I mean... I'm young, pretty, and have a bright future, and I said want to start a relationship with you. Why do you reject me? Aish! For fuck's sake! Anyway, I see you're the innocent type. You must have loved her alot. So much that you still hang her photo up even now. There isn't a man like that these days? Actually, I was like this before. I was 9 years old when I lost my mom. Suddenly losing someone you trust and rely on, and feeling as though something as important as your own life has disappeared into nothingness. Whether it's night or day, my heart remains unsettled and I was lost for several years But eventually, I managed to forget. As time passed, the memories gradually faded. I miss you, my mother... You should let it go, too. The person has left... But those who're alive still have to live! (Cell phone ringing) Oh, Mom! Stepmom! I'll call you back later, Stepmom! -You're not getting off?! Get off!! -My wrist! Wrist! It's gonna dislocate! -You crazy bitch! -My wrist!!! Ah, this son of a bitch, really! I'll give it to you too. This asshole. Do you know how embarassed I was at the police station because of you? Come here. Put that down. Put that down first then we'll talk. All the happiness. It's not far away. If you live with me, you wouldn't have to worry about the crooks, right? Bereavement? Yeah. I knew it. I always found him a little gloomy. So what are you going to do now? What can I do? I just have to get on with it. How do you seduce that type of man? It's nothing too difficult. If I'm sincere with my feelings, how can he resist not falling for me? Can you really do that so easily as you wish? You can't? Oh! Wow! Did you really make this on your own? Then do you think I bought it from somewhere? Hey hey hey! This fella, really. This son of a bitch for real Can't you spare a thought for those who have nothing to eat? How dare you discard food as you wish?! Would you like a bite? Why not? I'm only eating because I've no choice, really. Hey wait a minute. Hey you motherfuckers! Emergency rescue team, Dispatch! Gas leak accident in Jinkwang-dong warehouse. Emergency rescue team, Dispatch! Emergency rescue team, Dispatch! Where's the mechanic? He said he may be a little late. We've to at least shut the electricity power first before we can open the warehouse door. Let's move one as directed first. Yes Sir. Hey, what are you doing there? Oh Hyung, my head kind of hurts... Bastard, you wanna die?! Feels like I'm catching a cold. Hey, hurry up! Let's go! Guk-jin ah, have you gone up? Yes! I've arrived! Then cut off the power in the basement! Yes, sir! Damn! Hey, Yong-soo ah, come and take a look. Move it move it. Ey, Hyung! You can't use something like that! Hey, be careful. Ah! Yong-soo! Come here quickly! I'm already coming as quickly as I can! How? Stop with the crying now .. Aww... fuck! Hyung, can you still hold for awhile more? I'm dying here, you son of a bitch. Quick come and do something about it! Breaking the exterior valve can lower the pressure inside. Hurry up! Hey! Are you going to keep standing there? [gasps] His arteries have escaped (the stab)... But it seems it will be difficult for him to go out like that. So what to do now? We've to stitch it up! Stitch? Captain, are you okay? This son of a bitch... Have you finished? Yes Let's go. Give that to me if you're tired. Hey, hurry up! Go, just go... Oh... Hey Guk-jin ah, who's on your vehicle? Ji-won, Suk-young, Young-bae, and me. Four of us. Oh? Headquarters, The situation here hasn't seemed to be fixed? The hell you talking about? This thing is rotting soon... Stop talking nonsense. Just switch the power back on! Hey, wake up. Get a grip! Where is this? Where else can this be? Fuck. No signal? Be quiet. I'm boiling with rage now. What's that? What do you think? I don't know. But the atmosphere's kinda great, isn't it? Get up and move your feet if you don't wanna freeze to death. Jump on your own. At least give it a try! No thanks. Hurry and get up. Stop bothering me! You're a really strange person! Oh, you really want to die?! Hurry up! Dont't be jumping so carelessly. Move your arms along too. One, two, one, two, like this. Ow... Anything else is wrong? Omo! The stitching is done really well! After cleansing the wound, you will be fit enough for soccer! I guess that bitch is really a doctor, huh? Ah ah ah ah Ouch! Almost wanted to hit the doctor. Fucking hurts. Doctor. Please let me have some sedation pills. What sedation? A couple of band-aids should be enough. Hey wait. Wat wait wait! Excuse me! We can't find Kang-il and Mi-soo. I heard the returning team left halfway. But we can't reach them by phone or nor wireless. What are you doing? You cannot move about now. Didn't you say I can even play soccer now? Excuse me, excuse me! What are you looking for? Band-aid. Get a grip. If you fall asleep. you'll die. I don't want to die... Yeah... That's why we have to survive... So cold..! I... Have something to ask you... What is it? You... You like me right? No... Li- Like you. Like... I said I like you. I knew it. What the fuck do you know. Wake up... Wake up! Aww, so cold! Hey. Say there's this guy who always appears to save you whenever you're in trouble. But this guy... He's very cranky, Stubborn and ill-mannered, and very inflexible. Looks-wise? Of course he's handsome. Then it's an unconditional 'GO'! Right? Of course. Do well. Do what well? You've had physical contact with her, so you ought to take responsibility like a man should! Oh, look at this son of a bitch. Didn't you strip her, touch her and maybe even rubbed a little? Crazy bastard. You afraid now? That you're attracted to a girl like her. Huh? Ah, fuck. (Music) How's the Stenosis? There isn't anything out of the ordinary. Hey, I think this young lady was right? Really? If something's wrong, won't the person herself know better? Right? Of course! You live in Hongjae-dong, right? You're planning to go home? Why? Is there some place you wanna go? Yes Where? Sea. Are you kidding me? (Snoring) Damn it. (Snoring) Ya-hoo!!! This is great! Oh right, I heard that most of the Rescue Team is made up of soldiers? Hmm... Yep. -You too? - Yes. When you were a kid, What was your dream? Soldier. Then you should have just stayed in the military. Why be a fireman? I was sick of the soldier stuff, so sick of it... So, what about you? What made you want to become a doctor? Me? Well... Why did I want to be a doctor? [sigh] Think it was when I entered middle school. My father was diagnosed with the latter stages of pancreatic cancer. After being told how long more he has to live, he just lived day-to-day in the hospital. He looked like he was in alot of pain. But the hospital would not give him painkillers, because we didn't have the money. Eventually, he passed away alone. Perhaps he didn't want us to see him in pain. When my mother was at work, and when I was in school, he just passed away alone like that. That was when I decided to try to become a doctor. How do I put it... I don't want any more patients to feel like my father? Aigoo! Can't believe I told you all this. Aren't you hungry? Raw fish! Buy me raw fish! Fish! Fish! So what happened? So I waited in front of her company, and just got her into the car. Then I took her to the rooftop, grasped both her hands tightly, and told her this. Over there... See that high-rise apartment? Huh? That one is mine. Wow... Even though it's less than 30-pyeong (about 100 square meters), and it's a really small apartment, but I used up my entire savings and funds, and suffered quite abit to buy that. So, just accept! Even though, I may not be able to give you happiness all the time, I will never let you suffer. Huh? So, just marry me? What happened then? (The apartment's)"Too small!" She said. It IS a little small... Then what do you think will do? The house should at least be 40-pyeong! (about 132 square meters) So she said to build a veranda! Veranda? After building the veranda, we married two months later. When did you get here? Just now. Don't you miss me? Of course I do! How much? Since I met you today... I don't care even if I die tomorrow... That much? Then why are you crying like a fool? I don't know. I don't know, just... My tears keep falling... Is she gone? Ji-young... Ji-young ah... I'm sorry... What are you thinking of? Wow... The sunrise is damn beautiful. How about you? Ya... We're gonna go back like that without even a kiss. You wanna kiss? Tch. Headquarters? Headquarters? What great weather to be dating! Motherfucker! What about this? Got pierced by its teeth while chasing after a wild boar. Eww... This? Hmm... From a fire scene, I got caught under the falling pipes. This one? This? Promise me one thing. What promise? Don't overwork your body when you're working. When you're scared, run. If it's too dangerous, then avoid. Don't be like a moth and just keep going forward. Isn't that like asking me to quit being a fireman? Sounds good too. What do we live on then? You can be the housekeeper! Cook, do the laundry, and change diapers for the kids. I... Make lots of money. Aigoo. That's great. Appointment Promise. (Buzzer sounds) Kang-il ah! Let's go get spring water! This crazy bastard. Quick, hide! Why must I hide? We didn't do anything wrong. Okay, okay. Just go and hide, quick! Nope~! Hey, Jung Kang-il! What the hell are you doing? Do I really have to hide? Hurry up! Just hide! Why? Get up, dude! Let's go and get spring water! (Mobile phone vibration) [Attorney Park] We've tried our best, but we're unable to prevent brain death. This is your wife's organ donation confirmation. She applied for this June of last year. It may be hard to accept, But if you're able to make the decision, there will be many people who can have a new lease of life. I'll give a few days' time. Use them to make a decision. You've got to get a move on. If that person doesn't get sued, there will only be one verdict regardless. Apart from this, isn't there any other way? Like an agreement between both parties? The other party wishes for you to receive punishment, so that's out of the question. Currently, the only way is to get the other party into trouble. Are you aware that the situation has worsened? What do you mean 'worsened'? One day... Can't you just give me one more day? It's meaningless to keep dragging this on. Tomorrow is her birthday. Up till now, we haven't even had a marriage ceremony. Even that most common ring, I haven't put it on for her. Though I return home everyday to a nagging wife, she's still someone who spent over ten years of her life, with someone as worthless as me. I can't just send her off like that... With nothing... I can't let her leave like that... Back then I only focused on studying. Thought that I would relax and enjoy life after college. But before I could enjoy life, I started working. Everyone around me kept praising me, saying I was smart and capable. And I wasted my precious time. What's going on? The person who injured your face... His wife. She's now in a coma. It's my fault. I made a mistake. Anytime now, they could be taking her off the respirator... Come on. Come on. Where? It's too late now. Yes, I know that it's too late. But you can't just sit here and whine, right? That person has filed a lawsuit against me. The trial's a few days. The trial that will affect the rest of my life. Then what about the life that you ruined? [sigh] It was a mistake. A mistake, I said! Mistake, mistake! When that person dies, what are you gonna do? If this matter is resolved well, In the future, this pair of hands will be able to save tens of lives, even hundreds of lives! I'll promise you that, okay? Then it's settled. Do you think you can set your mind at ease by doing this? You'll leave with this burden in your heart for the rest of your life. Can't you just give me a little consolation? I also want to be apologise to him, to be forgiven. But if I do that, I'll be admitting to everything, and I can't be a doctor anymore! Then do just that. And if I can't do it? Such a person .. I don't want her to stay beside me. Just bear with it for awhile. I'll get you out soon. (Cell phone ringing) Oh, Ji-young ah. Oppa's busy right now, so later- Oppa...[distressed voice] Why? What's wrong? Oppa, can't you come over right now? Just hang in there for awhile. I'm nearby, I'll be there soon. I think you're pressing on her carteroid artery now. What about it? If you let go now, she'll die. Call for an ambulance and send it to my house. All the ambulance around the area are now here. How do I send one to your house? I don't care if it's from a private hospital or not, just send one over you bastard! Not sure if this is the right thing to do... The janitor with the keys is still not here? We've tried everything, but the door still won't open. What do we do now? Jin-joo, what's going on? Yes, got it. Yes. Ajussi! Doing this will not change anything, okay? Open the damn door! Aish! What's going on? What are you doing here? If he finds out that you're here- I'm asking what happened? Aish. Not sure what he used to lock the door, it won't budge at all! Fuck! No heartbeat. Get out of the way! Don't die. You can't die. Clear. Shock. Clear. Shock. Clear. Shock. Are you crazy? Hands off. I said hands off! Go Mi-soo! Let go! Stop it! Let's try it again. Just once. Shock. It's a railway accident. Hey, this is a big accident, so be alert and do it properly, let's go! Yes sir! Two vehicles were involved in a collision. One of them has been confirmed to be lying on the railway tracks. Contact the train station, and check if there are any incoming trains. And ask them to stop the trains first. Yong-soo and the rest, get the equipment for the fire. Let's go! Hyun-kyung, check on the railway situation. Yes sir. Two of you, follow me. Those in front, get out! Check on her status. What do you think? It's pierced through her abdomen, she can't just be pulled out. Her pulse is very weak. Damn it. Let me take a look. Hold it well. Captain! What? We have to evacuate! What are you talking about? The connection has been cut due to the fire, we're unable to contact the trains. What? I'm saying, we do not know when the train will be coming! What are her chances of survival? Because she is bleeding so badly... The chances of survival! Chances! There's not much hope. Wake up, you motherfuckers! Quick! Suppress the fire and evacuate the people! Hurry up and open the valves, you bastards! Aish. Captain! Hyung! Get over here! Hey, what are you still doing there? Get over here! Ajussi... Hey, are you okay? Save me... Please... Hold on tight! Done. Quickly tow the the car away now. Hey, let's move! (train sounds) Jung Kang-il, can't you see that the train is approaching? Quick, get away! She's alive. She's still alive! Jung Kang-il! Get out of there you son of a bitch! Aish, this motherfucker for real. What are you guys doing? Get over here! Lift on three! One, two, three! Aw, fuck. Again! One, two, three! Use your strength, you bastards! One, two, three! One, two, three! A little more. One, two, three! (train sounds) It's coming, it's coming! One, two, three! It's coming! Everybody get out of the way! She'll live, right? What are you doing? I've to save her. How are you gonna save a dead person? Go Mi-soo! She has already stopped breathing. Even if you save her, she would be brain-dead. It's not your fault. It was inevitable. Till when are you gonna be like this? Stop it. Even without you being like that, I'm already tired enough. You think you're the only one who's tired? I'm tired too. Me too... I'm so tired that it's driving me crazy! Then let's end it. So there's no need to feel tired anymore. Let's end it here and now. Yeah, let's break up. From the start I knew it would be hard. But since we have already started, I thought we should see if it works out. Eventually it still came to this. Let's end this. Kang-il ah. Still remember that Mr. Jang, the one who died in the nightclub fire? A fortnight before he died, he asked me out for fishing. That time, he suddenly asked me this: If your mom and dad both fell in the water, who will you save first? So I told him this: My mom is a diver. That time we laughed about it, but... What about you? If your parents both fell in the water who would you save? I don't know... What do you you don't know, you bastard... Can't believe I trust a jerk like you. Jumping into the inferno, I must be crazy. Hey, Ki-man ah! Yes? If your mom and dad both fell into the water, who would you save first? Of course the one nearer to me. Right? Of course. I'm saying, to save the one that's closer to you first. Forget it all. Of course I have to. But I can't seem to do just that. Tsk. What a poor little thing... Let's go. What's wrong this time? At the contrasting portion here, do you see that little bump? If the intracranial pressure is too great, the bump will press on the nerves. That's why she faints from time to time. Is it a tumor? Yeah, but, Don't worry. It's of benign nature. There shouldn't be a problem once we remove it. She needs to undergo surgery. Arrange for one. Ha-yoon ah. Huh? I have a favour to ask of you. I've heard. You saved my life. After coming back from the dead, I finally realize. Being able to live is happiness by itself. If she had the chance to know this, she would have been happier. Even until I die, I will not forgive you. Whenever I think of her, I resent you. I guess it's time now to let her go... Since you started it, be the one to end it too. Would you please turn the switch off? I'm sorry... Sorry... I'm sorry... Captain, can I leave first today? Why? I have a matchmaking session today. I'll leave first. Eh? Yeah, yeah. What? Wow. You're really going on a matchmake? Yep. What about Yong-soo? He said he doesn't like me. I was the one who chased after him for three years. I've done what I can. He does that on purpose. You know that too. He's not good at expressing his feelings. Oppa, I don't think you have the rights to tell me that. Hey. Don't go. Why not? Let's go to VIPS (an expensive restaurant). With everyone? Just the two of us, you idiot. He said we're going to VIPS. Oh, there's someone looking for you outside? How're you doing? The same old. Soccer, and catching wild dogs sometimes. How about you? Just day by day, like that. I came because I had something to say. Aigoo, but thinking of what I'm about to say now, it's slightly embarassing. Turn around. Turn around! From when I was a kid, people kept saying I was clever, to the point where I really thought I was indeed clever. But then I found out I was stupid. I finally realize it now. Upon realizing it, I feel as if I could give up everything I have now. Including you. But come to think of it again, I have never really had you before. So I felt I should at least tell you this, that I love you. No matter what you say, or what you think... I still love you. If I come looking for you again, Please hide. Hide from me. Because I have no confidence in myself. I'm leaving now. Goodbye. Hey, where the hell is that Kang-il? That son of a bitch still hasn't appeared? Stop the car! It's time for work now where the hell do you think you're going? Hurry and get on! It's gonna collapse soon! Evacuate the crowds! What's the current situation? It's serious. All the workers have evacuated. But there is one... Then why haven't you gone in? These bastards, really... Hey, you guys go in and take a look. Hurry! Let's go. Ajussi. Ajussi, wake up! Ajussi! He's still alive. So it's way down to the basement? Hyung, the retaining wall that reinforced ceiling has fallen apart. I'm afraid we're going to have to use the airbag. No. If we use that now, it could cause the ground to collapse. Give me that. Hey, how long do you think he can hold? Ten minutes tops. Nothing more. Is there any other way? By sawing or something? He's buried up to the thigh. Can't afford to lose more blood. Then try something by force, think of something! Bear with it a little. One, two, three! [screaming] One, two, [screaming] Aish. Hyung, it's not working. Can't pull him out. Hyun-kyung ah, you go down with the hydraulic equipment! What for? We'll temporarily put up the hydraulic equipment first. The cement weighs over 20 tons! How can it support the weight?! No go for the equipment, and no go to pull him out, you bastard! Do you wish to be buried? Motherfucker, what are you saying now? You're gonna let him be buried alive? Let her put up the equipment, then get out of there. Let the Heavens decide on the rest. Hey. At least explain to me... Tell me what's going on? It's gonna collapse soon. Currently you can't be lifted nor extricated. If it collapses The equipment will support it. So, You're telling me to stay here alone? This is the only way left. I'm really sorry. Hey. Please, let me make a phone call. Really not a great weather to be saving lives in, fuck it. Oh Dear, it's me. What are you doing? Something came up suddenly. I think I'm going to be quite late. Uh. What about Ji-woo and Jae-hee? Oh, nothing. No, no need to wake them. Don't wait for me. Go to bed early. We'll definitely come back to save you. If we lift the block, the whole basement may collapse. But do you still wanna give it a try? Yes... What the fuck are you doing? Are you crazy? It's his decision. That's not the problem now! Sunbae, even if it collapses, there's still a chance to save him. But this is not it! What are the odds of that? I can do this by myself. You two can leave. You crazy son of a bitch. Once it collapses, you two will die! Don't kick up a fuss, okay? I'll just lift it slightly. There's a possibility. You wanna die that badly? I don't have much time. I've to get him out quickly. I said I don't have time for that, you bastard! Get Hyun-kyung out, quickly. Get up, you asshole. Motherfucker. Stop it, you guys! What the hell do you think you are doing? Look. Please reconsider your decision. I wanna live. Please save me. Kang-il ah .. I'll make it quick. And bring him out. Let's get out of here. Captain, look. How did it go? Where is Kang-il? You crazy motherfuckers, really... Let go, you bastard! I said let me go, you bastard! Fuck it, Yong-soo ah! I have always been someone like this. One to say "Sleep early", something like that. (cough) Do you have your 'other half'? Promise me one thing. Don't overwork your body when you're working. When you're scared, run. If it's too dangerous, then avoid. Don't be like a moth and just keep going forward. Promise. Quick. Fuck... I miss you... If it fails, it should be hard to get out of this alive right. I won't fail. Absolutely not. I'm going to begin. A little. A little more. Bear with it a little more. Are you okay? It's- It's okay. Fuck! Don't even know if we can can make it on time for the surgery. Right? (Radio) The next song .. Uh ... We're bringing you latest news of an accident. Early this morning at the construction site of Eunpyeong-gu, the structure collapsed in the site. A firefighter by the last name of 'Jung' has been trapped in the debris. That's really sad to hear... Hopefully, he can be rescued successfully. Now, let's listen to the next song. Hey you bastards! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! You bastards! Stop! I called them in. We should start using the cranes. If we only do it manually, we won't be able to find them even in three days! You crazy motherfucker. Don't you know that if we use equipments we won't be able to recover even the bodies in one piece?! Captain! We found him! We found him!. Where? Here, right here. Are you okay? I'm fine. But this man... He's alive! We're on the way to the hospital right now. But I'm not sure what will happen. Kang-il ah... His pulse is normal... (Piano melody) Tch. No fun at all... Please. Please Kang-il ah, please... Please...Please live... AH!!! Fuck, you scared me! Fuck, he scared me too. I need water... Water? Water! Water! Water, Water! Son of a bitch... [burps] Hey, Yong-soo. Where are we headed to now? Where are we going? To where? Where else?! The hospital, of course! But why aren't we moving? It's the peak hours now. We're stuck in traffic. What about that person? He's alive. His leg is fine too. This son of a bitch. where are you going? To see Mi-soo. Crazy bastard... Think of a way, quick! Kang-il? Hey, Kang-il! Where are you going? Going... I'll see you in a bit! This asshole. He's alive! (song) We're almost there, where are you going? Oh my god. I'm looking for Doctor Go Mi-soo. Doctor Go Mi-soo... Didn't she resign a few days ago? Yes. Re-resign? Did you say resigned? Mi-soo! Go Mi-soo!! What's wrong? Why are you crying? I thought you were dead! Are you hurt? But where were you headed to? To see you. What were you planning to do after meeting me? (Song) Right. I heard you quit working at the hospital? Yeah. Sigh, what do we live on now? Housekeeping! Cook, do the laundry. And change diapers for the kids. Housekeeping with who? With the firefighter? (Laughs) Oh! Hey! Put your hand down. Why must I? I'm not afraid of anything! Fine, do whatever you want. What's going on? Can't believe they said Bukhan Mountain has bears... Really have no idea what they're talking about. Hey, so is it a false report? We still have to go check it out regardless. Ah, really... Does it state if they're male or female? Let's go catch bears... What the hell is that? Thought you said we were catching bears. You think a bear can fit in this, you asshole? No, right? Are you free later? You'll get a beating later, I'm not kidding. Ey... Who'll hit me? I will! Oppa, he keeps hitting on me. Love you. Me too. But, why does this person keep sleeping all day long like a sick kitten? Hurry and wake her up! Come on, let's go! What GREAT weather... To save lives! [END. Thanks for downloading the subs~!^^]
