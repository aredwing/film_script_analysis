 

                        I couldn't remember Germany. I only knew there's snow and 4 seasons. And that our family was there. | Everyone, not just mum and dad. Everyone. And that I liked that. But I know as well that I was | always afraid of something. Of the other children, of the people on | the streets. I was even afraid of dogs. Oh come on, I'll help you. Germany is a dark place for me. | Not so light and hot as Kenia. A place with big buildings | and gloomy rooms. Dad says that Germany is our home. | I guess he misses his own father. My grandfather. He's allergic to nuts | And was not allowed to eat nut cookies. He liked Heinrich Heines poems. | Especially those about Germany. I had two aunts there too, | I really like them Aunt Kthe was my mothers sister. | Dads sister was called Liesel. Sometimes they helped out in grandfathers | hotel Eagle.. But that was before the Nazis came. May I help you? No, thank you! We have to leave now. The Nazis didnt allow my father | to work as lawyer. And they took grandfathers hotel. | So the whole family had no job. I always got the same answer | If I asked my mother why: Because we are Jews, Regina. | Thats the only reason. Bwana! Bwana! Bwana! Bwana! Bwana! Bwana! - Whats up? | - An urgent message. Walter. Walter! Wake up! | This is Chinin! It's good. Bring me the coffee. Hurry! God damn it, Walter, wake up! Walter, open your mouth! Excuse me, I have to open | the door. Hold on! Aunt Jettel, is there still some apple | juice left? Anna! Im glad that you came. | Rudolf come in. Good evening, Miss Redlich. | You shouldnt talk to them! Anna, hello. | Hi, Ina. Hubert, Jrgen! Stop playing with fire! | You will light up the whole building. Sure, Klara. Here. Bite this | You will have to get used to this The negros eat everything burned. | Or raw and bloody! But they eat dogs! | I know that from my geography book. They eat grasshoppers too. Hold him! | What do you want in Africa? You dont even dare to touch | a dog. Does this food contain nuts? This was the only thing I | could get, Mister Redlich! But, Klara. | There are not that many nuts in it! Because you have to sneeze, right? Every god damn time. I loved the green. Walter bought | it on New Years Eve. But actually it doesnt suit me anymore. Then take it. Youre an angel, Jettel. Thank you. Kthchen. No tears, ok? Stay to your ass, Liesel. | Thats how men like it. - A letter for you. | - For me? Some glitter is good for you. Thank you very much! Its from Africa. Rongai, Kenia, December 2nd 1937. Dear Jettel. I can imagine how excited | you are because of this letter but I beg you to be strong. | The Jewish community in Nairobi will pay the fees for your immigration. | Time has come now In 6 months I can afford | letting Regina and you Come here. Dont hesitate any longer! | Go to Karl Silbermann immediately. He can I help you with the schedule. | Tell him which ferry to take It doesnt matter how | long he will be traveling Its most important that you both go. We definitely need a fridge. | If it doesnt fit in our boxes, get rid of the Rosenthal-dishes. | That doesnt count there. And please get some gas lamps, | mosquito nets and sturdy shoes! for you and Regina. Dont try to take | cash or jewels! You know the Nazis. Talk as little | as possible about your plans. You cant trust anybody, | even those people, who were our best friends. | Ive heart-rending feelings when I think you both being in my arms. Its hard to imagine how painful | this letter will be to you mother. Walter? Listen to me! You have malaria. You have to take this! | You understand? Thats very important! I have to go back to the ranch. | Owuor will take care of you. He needs Chinin 3 times a day, Three times 40 drips. Understood? Understood Max, whats up? We have to go! I dont like railway stations In one or two years this | will be over anyway. You guys stay close eachother, ok? Promise that you make it out together. Theres always the one who | loves more than the other one. Thats why its so difficult. The one who loves more can be hurt easily. My son loves you very much! Ill be missing you so much, Max. Mum! Say goodbye please! Eat this. This will get the bad | things out of your body. Very good! Do you know Schlesisches Himmelreich? | (Silesian Heaven) Meat, potatos, bacon, dried fruits, | mixed up together. Mmmh! I don't understand a single word! You know? In my first life | I was a lawyer. Kikombe. | Kikombe! Kikombe. Kiyo la dirisha. | Kiyo la dirisha. Kiko la di... Dirisha la Kiyo. Dirisha la Kiyo. Owuor? This is for you. You give me your coat? That's not a coat. It's a robe. I was sick and you took care of me. Thank you Owuor. I used to wear this robe at home. When I was not yet a Bwana but | used my brain And you don't wear it here? For that robe you have to be smart. Here in Rongai you are smart. Not me. "Robe" I'll need to say | those words very often so that i can say them as well as you. Thanks a lot. 6 weeks we spent together on this steamship | and circumnavigated Africa. On April 201938, Hitlers birthday | We arrived in Nairobi. Regina, hold that for me please. Mr. Morrison, the owner of the farm | where my father worked gave us a ride. I had to think about chocolate | But mum explained me that | from this point on we were poor And theres no chocolate for | for poor kids. I promised to be brave. Hey, come here. How did that cow die? We don't have enough water. Shit! Always the same! You have to dig a well. A well! A car is coming! Where? Over there. Now everything is fine. Welcome. Welcome, little Memsaab! Come to me. Welcome to Rongai! Regina, my darling! Come here! And we were in England and Marocco, | everywhere at the harbour. I saw dolphins! Mum danced too the other night! Bwana, he means water. Explain him what he has to do. Yes, Bwana. Theres little water for the battle The fee to leave the | country was expemsive. We had luck. They just | opened 1 box at the border filled with clothes. | Max gave me this for you. The books were in the other box. | Thanks God! I know that this is not what you expected. Its beautiful. But we cant live here. Everything except those over there. We wont stay long here anyway. Memsaab. Plate. One plate. You have to learn German if you | want to talk to me. Plate! Attention! Plate! Jettel? My name is Skind. Walter as well. | Everybody calls me Skind. Alright. Walter shows Regina the farm. | They will be right back. You want to have dinner with us? Ive had a 4 hours ride. | I cant go back tonight. I brought onions, sugar | and cigarettes. Praising God... Chinin every day makes you blind. You can still fight against it | if you get it. Owuor! Lets drink on the arrival of Jettel | and Regina. On our second life. Cheers. How long have you been away | from home? Sweetie was smart enough to | leave Germany in 33. The departure was much easier. You could | take all you money with you right? Especially your books. And your wife? Weren't you married? No I wasnt. And why not? Jettel! I never had luck because I always | fell in love with married women My mother always says that the | Nazis wont survive long. Germany is a nation of culture, | the country of Goethe and Schiller. Dad! I think I heard lions! Those were monkies You start talking like a black! The air is muggy and dusk is breaking, Smooth is flowing the Rhein. The summit of the mountain is | glimmering. The most beautiful virgin is up there. Shes combing her blond hair and is singing a song with a beautiful melody The sailors heart has been ached He doesnt look at the rocks, | He just looks into the sky. I think the waves will eat | the sailor and his boat. And all that time hes singing... Have a good night honey. You didnt bring the refrigerator right? Jettel? No I didnt. There was no space left in the boxes. | You know, we were allowed to have just 2... But there was space left for this crap! What did you do with all the money? I just bought this. It wasnt expensive, just 4 Mark. You bought a grown? Yes I did. (Goebbels)... in his name. | And the stamp of his peronality [going on and on... ] Damn, I never thought I would | enjoy his voice Ill leave the radio here. We can take this gift. But know I have a reason to come back to recharge the batteries. Do you have a rifle? Since Jettel and Regina are here now... Good luck with the well! Come on little Memsaab! Do you see the holy mouontain? That's Mount Kenya. It is holy. Mount Kenya Little Memsaab, let's go! I cant go any further. | Mum told me to stop here! Could you help me out? Help! I am a cook A cook doesn't dig holes. The fields are thirsty You need more water. Come with me! Water. No men? No, men don't carry water. Women only. Help me! It's so heavy. please help me too! The water is so heavy... Help us too! Please give me the shovel! I lost my heart in Heidelberg... Fire. Yes. Fire. There is no water, Bwana. Didn't I tell you. You were right, Chepoi I'm sorry. Go home! Thank you. Thanks a lot! 6 months later Why doesnt Owour slaugter chicken? Thats how it is arranged with Morrison. | Just the eggs. I cant stand this garbage. | From time to time I need meat! Thanks, Owuor. Fire. You have to look at the fire, if it has been quiet a while. Dont be afraid. | Its just a normal bush fire. It wont reach the house... Where do you wanna go? | Come on, thats stupid. I cant stand it anymore. | Thats what you always say. But I want to live with people, | whose language I can understand! You dont earn a single cent here. Every day | we eat eggs and semi-solid food! How could Regina go to school? Yeah we are alive! And why? All day long were hoping for rain so that | the battle doesnt die which dont even belong to us? | Im feeling pretty rotten! And sometimes I wish I were. We just could escape in time! Yesterday the Nazis burned down | All the synagogues in Germany and pillaged all the Jewish shops. | They smashed everything to pieces. People, houses, shops, everything. Who should have informed you about | this on this goddamn farm? In the morning I could | receive the Swiss radio. For the Nazis were no longer human | beings for Christs sake. I saw it coming. | I always saw it coming! Do you get it now? It doesnt | matter if Regina doesnt study? And mum, Kthe and your dad? I dont know! I always said they | should leave Germany. November 10th 1938. Dear dad, Im very worried about the news we hear from Germany. What do you say? Id love to know that you guys | are alright! If I earned money we could afford that you leave the country! | Isnt there any way? Do you really think its too late? Oh dad I tell you that Im looking forward to see you. Here in this foreign country I realize | how lucky we were back home and how i appreciate everything | you did for me. Dont think that the money you | spent is lost. Im grateful that you let me | study so long. One day I will be again the lawyer | you were so proud of. Little Memsaab, come here! It needs you It's a kid (Toto) like you. Hold it carefully. Toto! Eww thats cold! I dont care. There are a lot of other kids here. | But be careful! They all have malaria. I dont want you to be ill. You cant change it! A white kid | isnt a black kid. Never eat anything they give you! | Never enter their homes! So. Swallow this! That tastes so nasty. | You get blind too! Bullshit! Open your mouth! Hey mum? Tonight they want to | celebrate for their ancestors. They want to slaughter a lamb to | pray to God Hnai to ask for rain. He lives on Mount Kenia. | And in the trees as well. Thats going to be a huge party. They pray for rain. Thats important. The negros do it like this as well? Says who? What shall I do with you? You know, grandma used to say? Dont worry about Regina. | She knows what she does! Exactly. She knows what she does.. | Thats what grandma used to say. So, dont worry ma! Im so scared that something | happens to you. Toto? Toto! Memsaab, Bwana is on killing spree... with the big gun! Shoot it to death! I cant! | You see that I cant! I just wanted you to have meat. You don't want anything of it? No. You say you are not hungry Good night. | I dont mind if you read. I already read this book 3 times. | It doesnt make any difference if I read it the 4th time I didnt expect that you | can hunt, Walter. I couldnt do it. | Youve never killed an animal. I want be able to do it! I didnt ask you to hunt. You treat me like I'm an asshole! As lawyer Im you favourite panty | remover! And now? Sweat-stained and unshaved | I dont exist for you! How come princess! Im your husband! | I can say what I think! You dont have the right for a privileged | life! Untill now we just had luck! So stop playing the daughter of | a middle class famlily. you need to understand whats | going on here! One last thing. The way you treat Owur remembers me of some people | back home in Germany. I guess you dont want to be | compared to those people! That's pretty warm. Yes, warm. Habari, little dog. | Where did you coming from? Chepoi, whos dog is this? This dog doesn't have a home. It's a wild dog. He is homeless. Dad, this dog is homeless! | Could I keep him? Please! But you are afraid of dogs! But I like this one. Well keep him. We call him Rummler! Rummler is a nice name! Toto! Toto! Owuor! Owuor! The trucks are going fast. We will all be interned! Nobody can stay on his farm! Kids and women will come to Nairobi. Everything is going to be alright! | I promise! I won't go away! Walter! Owuor! Take care of them! Yes, Bwana. I will. Regina! Can I take this too? Asante. Let me help you. | Dont forget your ID! Do you speak German? No tears little Memsaab! I'll find you everywhere, and follow you soon. You promise? I promise I'll follow you and get you a new Toto. No. I dont want a new Toto. I didn't protect it good enough. Its mother would have taken more care of it. I am not a good mother... ...for an antelope. You are smart little Memsaab. Take care of our stuff! Good bye, Owuor! Good bye, Rummler! Suddenly we were no longer | refugees but enemies We didnt even know why the | British were locking us up. We were Germans and Germany | was in war with Great Britain. But we were Jews as well and | obviously not on Hitlers side Get off miladies Thats a nice prison! Can you understand that? Maybe they didnt know | where to keep us Whats that? Don't know. Something British. Excuse me. Still free? This remembers me of better times. The chef de la cuisine used to | cook on a luxury cruise. Im very hungry! | This is lobster. Fish, nice fish! | No thanks. Thank you. | What"s wrong with it, ladies? I Breslau we were never alone. | There was always something to do. What a life! Oh yeah, before immigation! Are you done? Thanks. No message for your husband? Its the feeling of being alone. | The feeling that you have anything to say. | That you own anything Some children maybe. | Realizing this is very painful! You know what I am talking about? Loneliness is a thing I can talk about. With a wife like Jettel? | Such a beautiful woman! Shes happy and full of life. Maybe you dont give her | a real chance. Back home everything was fine. | Everyone played his part... Now you can see. I dont want to see reality. | But I want a grown up wife, who I can talk to! I have to put it past me. My dad, Liesel... Shut the fuck up! Oi! Sometimes I think we are 2 parcels. Wrapped up together in a train with unknown destination. Nobody knows what the other one contains. You think too much. Hey! Soon we started to get used to the hotel. | Every day our mothers and us took a walk in he shadow and thought | what we were going to get for lunch. If we could just spend a couple | of hours outside. Inside you get insane. Mum, Im hungry! | You are all Jews, arent you. Why dont you just write a letter | To your community in Nairobi! They still have something to say | in this country. Soon the government figured out that | not all the Germans are with Hitler. 2 weeks later we could visit the | husbands in the camp. With the brown uniforms it was hard to see who was British and who was German. Dad, got a real friend! Shes called Inge. She | already kows how to read! And mum wrote a letter! A real letter, so that we could visit you! You wrote to the British? Perhaps we can go to Rongai soon! You were very unhappy in Rongai right? | You guys want to drink something? We all want to get back to the farms! We cant go back to Rongai. I was made redundant. Because of the war. | Morrison doesnt want to hire Enemy Alien So I have no work and we have no home. No matter what we have to do to | get our stuff from the farm. Maybe he is still waiting for us. | Because he thinks that we may come back. Then grandpa will maybe meet Owuor. Yeah of course! May I help you? I need a special permission. | I have to visit Mr. Edward Rubens, the mayor of the Jewish community. | Its very important that I talk to him. Here we are. | Please help yourself, Mrs. Redlich. My husband and I we have been at | the Olymmpics in Berlin! My first time in Germany. | My God, we were naiv. Until the end we thought our | civilized friends will help us and stop Hitler. Where are you now? | Where have you been in 38? Hitler didnt invent anti-Semitism! | I dont think, Mrs Redlich came here to discuss politics with you! Right? | How can we help you my dear? Mr. Morrison, the owner of our farm | doesnt want Enemmy Aliens anymore. But without work Walter cant leave the farm and we dont know how to find new work. | Thats why I beg you for help. Wed do anything. Do you think you are the only one | who suffers from war? Or do you think we are responsible? You are alive! | By God, make the best out of it! Eddie! Im sorry, I cant help you! | Excuse me. We have relatives in Poland. For ages my husband hasnt heard | anything from them. Sorry about that. Well, good luck, my dear. Please take | these Biscuits for your little girl. Thanks. Bye. What are you doing here? Why, what do you mean? You are looking for a job for your husband. | On a farm I got a friend here at the army. He needs somebody. I could talk to him. That would be great. ...6... 7... 8... Youre very beautiful, Mrs. Redlich. Where were you? You have mail. Looks pretty important. Yesterday... today... what | the fuck means morgen? Tomorrow! | Maybe you can remember this finally! Tomorrow, there will be rain in Kenia. Pussycat, pussycat, where have you been? Pussycat, pussycat, what did you there? Oh God, Regina! Walter! What did I do? Here we are, Owuor! Dad! The holy mountain! | Looks like a Chinese hat Hey! Come down here? | Youll brake your neck! Thats the most beautiful place on Earth! Thanks. I am scared. This place is much further away | from your farm than Rongai. We wont see you often. You promise? We will see each other | more often than you like! The damn cattle is out again. Very good. Im your Bwana and I... want you to undress yourself! You will get grilled chicken if you do. And now on the way down there. | Like a African woman. Did you miss me in your hotel? Good morning. My name is Walter. You will need my help. I live here for 40 years. I appreciate your offer! Did Bwana Gibson die? No. He doesn't have time to be here. He is in the Royal Army He wants me to take care of his farm. You have to show me everything. You are not a British Bwana right? No. I didn't come to | become rich in this country. I came because I was | driven out of my country. Which is your country? Germany - It's far away. It is at war. Somebody steals you an ox, it will be killed, cooked and eaten. You will forget that soon. But if somebody steals your land, then it's always there. You can visit it. It will always be there. You can't forget that. Daji Jiwan is Indian. He's a good Fundi. He can help you build the house. As long as you work for | me you'll get your corn. Firewood, 2 liters milk per | day and 12 Schillings per month. 12 Schillings is not much. I don't make deals. If you don't want | to work for me someone else will do it. These men can't build a house for you. I'll teach them how to do it. Bwana, Kania is my brother. He can tidy up the rooms. Can he cook as well? We need a cook! No, Kania isn't a cook, | he can tidy up the rooms. Kamau can cook for the dog. For whose dog? We don't have a dog. Yes or No? It's very expensive. I have to pick up the mail. Letters with those | stamps always bring tears. I'll be the one who | gives Bwana the letter. Good idea. You are his friend. Sohrau, October 2nd 1940. My dear son, Its nice to hear, that you had luck with your 2nd farm. Emigrating has become | impossible. Pretty soon Hitler will close the borders. | Theres nothing left we could sell. People say that the Jews | will be banned in ghettos. In this case Greschek will | send you our new address. Walter, for the first time | in my life I am worried! Worried... especially about Liesel | but as well about my own life In Germany we feel | like on a lonely island. Nobody dares talking. Its horrible. My son. I send you this letter | and the rose seeds you wanted. May these seeds grow | in the African earth to bring Jettl Regina | and you a lot of joy. I always think of you! Your father. They have made a big journey. Yes, a big journey. I want to enrol Regina at | school as soon as possible. Owuor? Bwana! Did you learn how to cook? Owuor! You found us! Memsaab doesn't have | a cook in Ol Joro Orok? No, we don't have a cook. How do you know all | that? How did you find us? Rummler has a good nose. A bit of flour. Thanks! It's a young male and a young female. They walked into the woods. They are lost. It's dangerous during the night. That's an angel. He lives in heaven. And what's that? Those are wings. He needs those to fly in heaven. Have you ever seen an angel? No. You can't see angels. You can't see your | dead relatives either. Yes. Angels protect us too, if we are in danger. I'm an angel... and scare off the bad ghosts! Come here! No! Hmmm, kids. Come over here! Go away! Go away! When you come back I | wont be a child anymore. Bullshit. i'll be back | soon. Every vacation. Next harvest I'll be back already. Swear that you come back. I swear. I think that's him. Study hard my dear! Mum, Ill be back on vacation! Memmsaab dogo! When I come back, I will | tell you everything, Owuor. Come, let's go home. We are Jewish. He said | that we should get out! Quickly I realized what | it means to be an outsider. I was happy to have Inge. She didnt like the | British games either. I wonder how simple words | lose their meaning here. For example tax return Or rrrailway Sometimes I wonder why I still | get dressed in the morning I could just use a bag. | People wouldnt care. I do care! Do you still think I am attractive? Yes ofcourse I do. Did you meet someone in the hotel? Do you think people should | stay together their whole lives? Probably not. Maybe we are just | unstable because of the situation... Why? Do you want to leave? Sometimes I think my | life could be happier. I want to make it with you! You are my wife. I love you! I miss them all so much! My mother, Kthe... It hurts so much! Owuor! And? Isnt't that beautiful Jogona? You can't speak with the night. You are right. You can't speak with the night. But the woman who wrote this poem | imagined that the night has ears. It's beautiful to make music with words. Your father is a smart man. He speaks with thunder | and lightning too. He speaks with ancestors. | That's something different. You have to undress yourslef. | You clothes are getting dirty. No I won't undress myself. I'm not a little child anymore. You are stupid if you | dirten your school clothes. I'm not a child anymore. You must not see my breast. Your breasts arenn't different | to other women's breasts. Of course. A Mzungus breast is | different than black women's breasts. You must not show them. Mzungus' schools teach strange stuff. Are you even allowed to climb trees? Yes. But only if their | clothes dont get dirty. Wait Jogona! Dad! Ma! My dears. We are very excited. Tomorrow we have to go to | work in Poland Dont forget us. Mother and Kthe. They are not allowed to | write more. 20 words only... They used 19. These aren't good days, when the little Memsaab | has to go to school. Perhaps they want to try | to escape through Poland. Maybe they found a way. Say something, Walter, | finally! Please talk to me! Your mother wanted you to know it. | She wouldnt have written if not. Poland means death Shall I tell you something? Sometimes | I envy you because of this letter! Now you can be sure! I have | to ask myself every day, if my father is fine. Where he is. Where my sister is. Every day the German army looses | more And more territory in the east. A lot of people died. Since the Russian winter | offensive began the amount of killed, wounded | and German prisoners increased over 400.000. What's this? This woman doesn't need your | help. She wants to die today. And her family leaves her out here? The coyotes will pick up | her corps during the night. Kimani, I can't allow that. I'm the Memsaab on this farm. I want you guys to | carry her into the house. If she dies in the house | it isn't clean anymore. The family would have to make many | sacrifies to get it clean again. That's very expensive. But still. I order it! As soon as she's in the house those | people will carry her out again! This woman wants to die out here. That's how tradition demands it. It's ok Memsaab. My mother won't die alone. We're all with her. She isn't afraid. From now on you can count your | days. They call it Operation J.. The reorganization of the African forces They really take Germans? They have a good Chance to get in. Just dont tell them that you | are bored and need something else. They want to hear that you cant | wait to fight for the right side. And Jettel? I cant believe that I get | another chance in this war. Whats up with you? Its not my war. I dont | give a shit about Germany! I wont go to Nairobi with you. I stay here with Owuor. | Thats my final decision. For you alone its too dangerous. You wanted to go to | Germany and Rongai! But you never wanted to be there | where we actually were. And now you dont want to leave. But youd meet a lot of peolple. I dont want this anymore! If something happens to you... They are sending men to Burma! I cant hang out here | anymore. Im feeling useless. I understand that. I stay here with Owuor. Thank you! Sometimes I don't see you a day... and a night. Where are you then? I'm visiting my wife and my children. At the lake. Near Kisumu. They dont see you often. They understand that I | can't leave Memsaab alone. But your wife is always alone. That's something different. White women are helpless, | black women aren't How many kids do you have? I have 6 kids and 3 wives. 3 wives? That's a lot of work if you visit them! I give them money. | - 12 Schillings is not much. It's enough. They have their Schambas, With corn and beens. | And fishes from the lake. Do they respect you? They respect me. I'm working in the house of a Bwana. I respect you too Owour. Without you we would | be lost in this country. Could you help me out? I'm a cook not a barber. Please! I can't do it alone. How are your corn fields? Are they fine? Yes they are Do you want to do an excursion? Ill wait outside then Nice that youre here! This country is beautiful! The allies landed with | more than 300.000 men in Normandy. Bad for Hitler, so Id say: good. You dont care whats | going on in Germany? And you? What? What do I do? Are you already there? I was worried about you. Regina. I showed your | mother Lake Bagoria. We were pretty close to your school. What do you accuse me of? | That I wasnt here once? Why didnt you go with dad? You are the one who doesn't | want to leave the farm. Bullshit. You dont love him anymore. Skind made an excursion | with me. Thats it. The other day in the hotel... In NORFOLK. | Do you think I didnt realize that? You started an affair with that soldier. He arranged this farm We were homeless! And what can Skind do for | you if you sleep with him? Regina! Regina! Did you see my child? The Mzungu-Kid? Over there in the house. Regina? Regina? Ill be right there mum. I often slept at Jogonas place. You didnt realize it because | I was always back at dawn. My wild girl. You cant just disappear! Its beautiful! I can understand | why you wanted to have it Because of this my dad almost | sent me Back to Germany. You didnt wear it a single time? We bought it at Wertheimm | in Breslau. For 44 Mark. And then we ate a piece | of cake at Cafe Monheim. I cant even remember Germany. Only if I eat nuts. | Then I think of grandpa. Mamma... why are the Jews so hated? You and dad, you are not | really Jewish. You eat meat. And you dont pray right? In school they told us that | the Jews killed Gods son. For me and dad Jewish | played an important role. We thought we were as | much German as possible. The German culture, the | language. That was our home. Maybe we Jews are really different? Aunt Ruth and uncle | Salommon are different. They obey the Jewish rules Tolerance doesnt mean | that we are all equal. If I learned something here, it's | how important differences are. Differences are good, Regina. Smart people wont bother you | Just because you are different. Mum? Tonight we will celebrate Pokot They slaughtered a lamb | under the holy tree. There will be beer and | they will be singing. You have to see that. | Its pretty different! The war in Germany is over. A couple of days ago I received a | letter from a German teacher in Tarnopol. From whom? I dont know this guy. He | was a teacher before the war. He knew my father and Liesel. Father gave him my adress. | One week before he died. Father and Liesel hid | in a schools cellar. 2 SS-men beat father to death | in the middle of the street. One month later Liesel came to | Belsec. With the 3rd transport. No one returned from that one. She married during | the escape. A Tscheque Erwin Schweiger. He was a truck driver. Wiesbaden, November 4th | 1946. Dear Mr. Redlich! We are glad to let you know that we can offer you a job. You will be used as judge in | Frankfurt later on maybe as lawyer. You will help building up the | new judicial machinery in Germany. We wish you and your family | good luck for the future... Dad! How did you manage this? You want me to show you my | place? I am here and here is Inge. There is the supervision, | a girl from 9th grade. Priscilla. A British bitch. Whats going on, anything with mum? Nah, dont worry Everythings alright. I need your help! I want to go back to Germany! I know. You want to and mum doesnt. I thought about it very carefully. | I want and I have to go back! Please dont make it so hard. I could never forgive | myself if I make you unhappy. Why do we have to go back? Other | people dont have to go either! Inges dad is going to be British | next week. You could do that as well. You are in the army. You could! Maybe he gets a British passport. Even though he is far away | from being British. Tell me: Can you imagine that your | Headmaster will invite him? No. Sure he wont. A British passport isnt enough for me! | I dont want to be a man who has a name, which doesnt belong to him. Here | in Kenya Ill always be an outsider. Do you know what this means | to me? I know that very well. My brave girl. Promise me that you wont be | disappointed if we go back to Germany. Promise me that youll trust me. If we have to go back... can Owuor join us? Not this time. Hello my friend. Very good. Where is Memsaab? Out on the field with Bwana Skind. Was Bwana Skind often here? And then a corn cob | drops out of his trousers. Corn grew pretty good this year. The | rain came exactly at the right time! Gibson can be satisfied. And I give a fuck about this corn! Asante, Owuor. I requested to get sent back home. The army is obliged to discharge | its men when the war is over. For us this would be Germany. They pay for our tickets. So only you decided this? | Maybe Regina and I want something totally different! Why do you do this? Why dont you | talk to me about things like these? How can you think about | going back to Germany... Stay away! You are not | going to destroy my family! Do you know what your problem | is? You dont know who you are! We are Jews, Walter! Even if | it doesnt mean anything to you. Jettel. I say this only once. You know, if you want | to stay with me you can. That would make me very happy. These are going to be the | best "Knigsberger Klopse" you've ever eaten. But you don't have Kapern and you still don't | know, what Kapern are! I don't know what Kapern are, but I do know, that | Kapern aren't needed! Happy new year, Rummler! This have been the best | "Knigsberger Klopse" I've ever eaten. Thanks a lot! I think she prefers your Ugali. Happy new year, Jettel. We need more guards for the fields. A lot | of corn is being stolen during the night. Maybe you can talk to the guys. Walter? I need to make my decision. The | government is waiting for my response. I wont go back to Germany. You want to give up our family? -I don't understand why | still believe in that country. I am a lawyer! I love my job! | And I have the feeling that I could be useful in this new Germany Damn idealist! You think there | are no more Nazis around there? They are the murderers of our parents! Thats not just bad language. That | stands for the faith in mankind Maybe thats naive but everything | else leads to death and destruction. This country saved our lives. | But it isnt our country. Can't you sleep? No. In Germany there's a lot of | snow in the winter, do you see? A lot of snow is very cold? Yes. I hate snow. You do all the work for Owuor, girl! Mum needs your help. | Tomorrow harvest will begin! The last couple of years she | made it pretty good without me. Sometimes I prefer to be | in school than being here. How come dad? I dont know. Grasshoppers! The grasshoppers are coming! If they land on the fields | they'll eat everything! Theyre flying away, | theyre flying away mum! Do you want some? Its | good for your voice! Thanks for coming back. You have to be careful. I am pregnant. And I am the father? Jettel, honey, I dont want to lose you. Cant we sit like this all the night? Women and men in the village | never kiss each other. They dont even know what a kiss is. What a pitty! Everything I love is lying in this bed. The songs of the women went | deeper into my heart than usual. In the morning dad told me that | mum Is going to get another baby. I felt Owuor right behind me and I knew that this news was good as well as bad. The letter. Im going to destroy it. Which letter? I cant go without you. My parents have made | their trip to Frankfurt. The first night my dad was pretty drunk. And my mother was upset. I am so afraid of these | people, arent you? Yes I am. Do you love me? If you let me. Then decide for us. Owuor? What are you doing here? I am waiting for the sun. And why? Do you want to sell | the dog at the market? I didn't want you to see me. Rummler and I will do a long safari. Where this safari | leads to, no one knows. A man has to do a safari | if his time has come. Say goodbye to little Memsaab! Shall I tell my little daughter: "Owour is gone and didn't | want to see you one more time?" Shall I tell her | "Rummler is gone forever?" This dog is part of my child. You were there, when Rummler | and Regina became friends. Little Memsaab will understand. She always understands everything. She has eyes and a heart like we do. Please Owour! Say goodbye! Dad. Owuor has to go. Or do | you want his heart to dry? He doesnt want to die. If so he would have died long time ago! Here is my black coat. You forgot it. I didn't forget anything. That coat doesn't belong to me anymore. But I gave it to you as a gift as you saved my life! You said: "I don't need this coat anymore... it's from a past life that I've lost. " Now you've found life again. The life with the coat. Please Owour, take it with you! Without this coat you'll forget me. I'll never forget you Bwana I learned so many words from you. Owour, you have to lift me up one last | time. Like in Rongai on my first day. You must not go. You don't even want to do that safari. Take care of Bwana. | He's still like a kid! You are smart. You have | to show him the way! Good luck! You too! Thank you. I hope youll be happy. Take care. Why are we stopping now? I have no idea. Bananas, bananas,  I can't buy anything, | I'm poor like a monkey. For the monkey! Thank you. My brother was born on July 6th 1947. | Thanks to God Ngai the birth went well, he was totally ok. | He was tall and strong My parents called him | Max. Like grandfather!
