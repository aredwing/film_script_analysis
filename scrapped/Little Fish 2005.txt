It's very good. You've obviously done a lot of research. It's very impressive. And this address where you live, is this rented property? That's my mom's house. It's rented, yeah. I n the last four years there's steady employment, but there's no savings, no capital. You don't own a car? No, I've had some debts to pay off. We do a credit check on all loan applications and it is quite colorful your file, Tracy. This isn't really really safe estimate. Did you, did you see these? We get people coming in to the shop all the time asking if we've got internet, 'cause we're so close to the station. The nearest place is... It's... Tracy, this is not a personal decision. This is the bank's policy. I cannot approve an unsecured line against someone with your history. Sorry. Look, if you can come back with some collateral we might be able to talk again. But the way it's currently structured I can't approve that loan. Okay? What? What? No, no, I won't do it. No, Ray, I said no. Hey, Trace. The manager said the plan was, uhm, What did he say? It's impressive. I mpressive? So, we'll sign off our new shop on Monday. That gives you a week. Will the bank be able to transfer the money by then? By Monday? Yeah! Oh! Did you tell your mom? Trace... did you call you mom? Yeah, on the mobile. Net one plan. Do they have any computers can we actually fit in there? Some shoes for your brother.

That'd be 12. Sorry? Computers. Next door. Cool. I'll see ya. See ya. Girls! Wait up. Hello. Ray Heart speaking. This is where I work. You get down here and get the shit out of my shop.

Is it alright if I bring a friend over for dinner? Friend? Yeah, I do have him. Good. It's okay. See you tonight. Hi, Trace. Don't hang up on me, Ray. You get down here and get this fucking shit out of my shop or I'll throw it in the bin. Just get here. I have to get a bus. I've only got ten bucks to last me 'till Friday and it's Tuesday. Can you hold on to it 'till tonight for me, Trace? It'd be a birthday present. Last time, Ray. Sorry. Your password? Oh, Jesus Christ. I suppose a cup of tea is out of the question. How's Ray? He's good. It's his birthday today. There's milk if you... No, still have it black. Tracy's doing well? Yes, she is. Lionel, what are you doing here? Just came round to say hello, that's all. Say hello. Haven't been to a show in years. You and the kids and me. Had some times, ey? Mainly in club and races. Beach. I miss you. Lionel, you gave my daughter heroin. Yeah. She's clean now. She's good. This is for you. I don't want anything from you. You can call a cab. It's Ray's birthday. I'm cooking his favorite dinner. Tracy will be home soon. And you were never here. Tran, I don't mind you singing on the ship, but you got to get the work done, too. Remember we got that special? Two D VDs and you get a pack of that crap popcorn. Give it away, Tran. Want me to pick him up later? No, mate. I'll put him in a taxi. U nless you want to stay and watch the cable. I gotta get home. G'day, mate. Over there. Ray Heart? Yeah. Thanks for coming out here. Yeah. I got you a beer. No, thanks. So... is there a problem? I got some money together with a friend of mine. We're looking for opportunities to... How much money? About 30 grand. No bullshit. Why would I do that, mate? We're good for it. Fair enough. Give us a call tomorrow and I'll see what we can do. Thanks. Well, he said a friend. Isn't that what a friend means? Could be someone he talked to at the bus stop. Look, it's his birthday. Trace, get the door, will ya? Why is he at the front... You know where the key is. Use it! Shit! Ray's not here yet? I'll let you in the front. Is that Ray? It's Jonny. Isn't he in Vancouver? Not anymore. Shit. Janelle? Oh, well, what have we got here? Come in. Trace. Duty free. Do you still smoke? Ray told you I was coming here? When did you get back? A couple of days ago. Thanks. Here. This is for you. Not real ones. Why are you wearing a suit? Why I am wearing a suit? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey! How are you going, Ray? Shit. So, you know, in Vancouver people are making money 24-7 and that's all they do. They work and sleep. I don't suppose they sleep much. That sounds like shit. You've been there, Janelle? No. Overseas I've been in New Zealand, Fiji, and Bali. How long are you back for? For good. Yeah. I've got a job offer here, so... What sort of a job? A trader with a stockbroker. I worked with my uncle in Canada in his company. They do the Asian market. It'd be pretty good money, wouldn't it? Yeah. It's alright. I'm also thinking about importing those flowers I gave you. Thanks. How are you going? Good. She's doing great. She's opening her own shop. Mom, I'm going into partnership with Ming in my work at the video shop. We're expanding into internet on-line gaming. And the bank. Yeah. The bank approved my loan today. That's great! That's amazing. No, no, really! That is amazing. Don't just drop them in a plate. How many times have I done this? Happy birthday. Thanks. Don't drink it all. Anything but alcohol. A speech, Ray. Get fucked. I want a big bit. I'd like to say a few words. Just a few, mom? Ray's 30. My baby's 30. Five years ago on this night, I stayed in a hospital emergency room not knowing if you were gonna live. I never wanna go through another night like that in my life. It was a bad night. Bad night. And three years of rehab for Ray and me. People from the past knocking at the door. I suppose you think about it. The accident. Every day, Janelle. So, when do you start work? Friday. I n the city. So I suppose now you'll be moving out to Stratfield, somewhere. I don't know. I'm just staying with Kim and June for now. You probably have noticed this but people have been running from this place. Almost everyone. All the houses have changed hands. Or kicking themselves. Prices around here have gone up. People just want the best they can for their families. Oh, right, and I don't! That's not what I meant. Five years ago one's nearly killed in a car crash. Other one is about to become a fully blind junkie or find himself in jail. Or maybe bloody both! So, what do I do? Can I send them off to a rich family overseas? No. Can I get Tracy into the clinics to get her clean? No! Mom, sit down. It'll be alright. No matter what you do, always someone's there to smooth it over. Need it? Get it, sign the check. That would be alright. Maybe you shouldn't have married such a loser asshole then. You gonna blame your dad for the rest of your life? Probably yeah. Janelle, you would have done the same things if you had the money. But I don't. I didn't, I never did. You say you don't understand these people. They're doing what you would do if you could. Oh, I've had enough. Happy fucking birthday, Ray. Should I take it? So you can be all in. Yes, thank you. That will be very nice. I'm fine, thank you. Okay, there you go. Darling. It's alright now. Ray. Thanks for the shoot. Good night. Good night. Ray. I'm gonna bed. Trace, are we gonna fit 12 computers in here? Yeah, easily. Yeah, good. This is cool. Fix the place up. Make a bit of money. And you can refinance and buy me out. What would you do? Oh, I'll be up at businesses. Other things I wanna do. No, no, no. C'mon, Trace! Why not? You've been doing it for four years. You're a bloody great manager. You know, it's bad luck for tears to fall in the ground of a new business. Bullshit. Just think about it, ey? Yeah, right. Thanks. The whales aren't believed to be in any danger. But National Parks will stand in guard to ensure proper traffic as well as whale watchers give the mammals plenty of room to move. You know, you should have told your mom I was coming last night, prick. Stay in memory. Yeah, absolutely. Give us a look at that fun, will you? This is weird. What? I don't know. I just feel... Seeing you again we'll be more together. What about this? Did you speak to that guy? Moss? I told him we had 30 grand, mate, and his eyes went like this. C'mon, let's get out of here. I want you to take me somewhere, will you? Ray, I can't drive like this. What's wrong? You're worried you might have a crash? Sorry. Thanks, mate. No worries. Change those prices for me. No worries. You're alright? Yeah. I've just got a bit of a cold. I'll drop in, uh, later in the way. I'll give you a ring. Hello? Tracy, it's me. Jonny. How did you get my number? Ray. Ray gave it to me. It's hard. It's hard being back. It's harder than I thought. Tracy, you're there? I gotta go. See ya. Yeah. Yeah, sure. You're okay? Yeah. You're okay? Yeah, just wanna get home. And Jonny wouldn't speak. He had just lost his parents. A feeling I will never forget. As time goes on... But Jonny has been in Vancouver for four years. He has been working very hard. And he has a new job here in Sydney. A stockbroker. Today is 20 years since I married June. June, thank you. I don't know, Lionel. You've got to do something. Never had to pay for it. A straight price? I never had to find it. No, I won't stand up in front of a bunch of people and say that I was wrong, that my life was wrong, because it wasn't. It isn't. I gotta strip for this Salbutan and just wait. Really? Yeah, I'll be fine. One week and I'm clean. One week? Yeah, right. Mmmmm. How good is that? Yummy. Aren't you having any? No. Jonny's back. Eh? How is he? He's great. He's clean. He's a stockbroker. Let him on the phone in the morning. Most stupid. No. No boyfriend causes such a commotion. What does that say? It's okay. Yeah. Is it? Yeah, it is. It's great. The look on your face after you spoke to him. And now it's beyond that. I'd kill for that feeling. You got your stuff? Trace... I haven't been to the beach for years and what is all. Like I'm on public. I'll take you to the beach. You're my darling. Eat something. Bye-bye. See you, darling. Do you like trading? Yeah. Yeah, I do. It's fun playing with other people's money, you know. I'm impressed. A car. Mr. Cool C. The car's me uncle's. Tracy. How you're going? I'm good. What are you doing? Now? Yes. Nothing. Do you... Do you wanna meet up? Yeah, we could meet on the corner, you know. I don't have a car. I can, I can pick you up. At 7: 00? I'll take you to the city. This is a really cool restaurant. Yeah, right. Alright. Okay. Bye. Hey. Hi. You wanna drive? Okay. I've got to know if this is the real sea How are you going? Good. You look great. You really changed since I left. Tracy, You know l... I didn't have a choice. My uncle sent me away and my bags were packed. I had no time to see anyone. Four years. Yeah. Anyway, look at you. You look great. Yeah, 32. Living home with my mom and work in a video shop. Do you think if I'd stayed, you'd be clean now? Fuck knows where we'd be. Scarlet for me and scarlet for you What do you wanna eat? I bet the food is pretty good here. Is that what you heard? Like you read restaurant reviews. Certain times I do, yeah. Are you ready to order? What'd you like? Take your time. I'll come back. You're okay? I don't wanna be here. I'm wanna go. Tracy. No, I just wanna go home, okay? This is a bad idea. Where are you going? I'm going home. Let me drive. No, no, no. Don't grab me! Don't think you can fucking... grab me. Tracy, c'mon. What am I doing here? This is so easy for you! Is it easy? What do you reckon, huh? I want to drive you home, okay? Mr. Bush spoke to Mr. Howard Mr. Bush spoke to Mr. Howard about getting at least the understanding Whoa, whoa, whoa. What? Is that loaded? Nah, it's my farewell present when I sold the bar in the Philippines. Some bastard tried to impress me. I never used it. It's beautifully handcrafted. Why don't you keep it? I'm retiring. Oh, no. No, I want you to have it. I'm not a collector, mate. Do you want a beer? I poured you one. No, I might keep going. There's some white wine in the fridge. Jenny's getting a bit jacked up at me showing up late. So, if there's nothing else, I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, alright. At 10: 00? Sure. Hey, what ever happened to that Barky couple who ran the speed factory for us? Merv and Eileen. Where did they go? Kangaroo Valley, I think. They've got some goats up there. Goats. Goats. I just wanna get things finalized. Lawyer's on the case. You understand? Yeah, yeah, sure. Steven, just sit down for a minute, will you? I know you wanna get back to your family. Come. I know some things about me that you found... difficult. I wanna say this. I know what sort of man you are, and your thoughts about such matters won't make things... I'm not one to judge, mate. I just wanna... thank you for your trust and discretion. Okay. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, alright. Right. Okay. Bradly's got no idea. He hasn't been down to the speed factory in years. He just wants to fuck boys and play golf. What if he goes down there? Well, then he does. Merv and Eileen can deal with it. Honestly, Stevy. I hurt my nose! Is there any blood? Is she alright? Just a little bit. My bunny, my bunny. Oh, that's alright 'cause we've got him now! We silly duffers. These toys are shit. Bloody dangerous, too. You know, Tiny and Jean have got a new floor. You can just lay straight over the slab. Yeah? Good. Here we go. It's okay, it's okay, honey. There you go. Sh, sh, sh, There. There we go. So, this is what we're doing.

Second is Camel. Tracy, you're brother's here. C'mon, please. He's not here. Having a good perv? You're losing your touch. Why didn't you wake me? I missed my swim.

Yeah. Okay. Hey, mom? Give us a kiss. Oh, no, no, no! Naughty girl! Like the lesbians? You have a good day. Could you not clap lesbian... Doesn't it go in the Ts? No. I'll look for it Ivonne as a customer. Would you? When do you find out about the bank? This afternoon. You told Janelle you got the loan approved already. Yeah. Did you tell her anything different? No! The party's right here. It's right here! Are you alright? Yeah. Just I didn't sleep much last night. You're racing or you just watching some TV? I went out with Jonny. Are you alright? It's a change. Didn't you and Janelle have a chitty chat about that? Tracy. Lionel Dawson. Okay, I can buy that. He's an old friend. Do you think this is okay? He's straight. Straighter than you. Do you feel okay about being around him? I can handle it. You don't know him! No, I don't. He's a stockbroker. Went to this really nice restaurant in the city. What? You look scared. I haven't seen that look for a while. There's this big fucking empty space. Tracy, it's okay. I'm fucking fine. Take it easy. Brad, it's Lionel. If you're there, mate, please pick up. I really need to talk to you. Brad, it's Lionel again. Please, call me, mate. Okay? It's the third time today. Your wife's outside. She's got a key. Look at these fucking boxes. There are people waiting. Can I stay today? Please? If you want to arrange this, you talk to me. 'Cause I fucking live here, not her. I co-owned, Bradley. C'mon, Steven. You fucking prick. Do you know whose house is this? Bradley Thompson's. What? Don't you want to have a look inside? Ray! It's open for inspection, mom! Look, anyone can go in. How did you find out about it? I just ready it in the paper. C'mon. Hi, my name is Tracy Heart. I had an appointment with Donna Suvani. It's just that I need to secure the loan as soon as possible. No. Okay. No, that's great. Yeah, yeah. I'll be there. Thank you. Excuse me. I've gotta close the shop. Do you want anything? I'm gonna get change. I'll be two minutes. It's Trace. Oh, honey, I forgot how painful this is. It's fucking horrible. I'll be back in a couple of hours, alright? I call Brad so many times but he hasn't called back. I don't understand. Sorry, Lionel, but I gotta go. I'll be back really soon, alright? Okay. Hi. I'm here to see Donna Suvani. Mh-hm. Take a seat. Yeah, it's alright. It's about half an hour trip. Hi, Jonny. Steven Moss. Steven, this is Jonny Nguyen. How are ya? Good, good, good. I'm sorry, excuse me. Hi. Hi. Where are you? With some friends at the club. Where are you? I'm just sorting out some... Finishing up the bank stuff. It's kind of hard for me to talk right now. Sure, sorry. No, that's fine. It's great you called. I missed you. I just, I wanted to say that last night... Tracy, listen, I'll call you. Okay? I have to finish here. Excuse me. You can go in now. I've gotta go. G'day, Tracy. How are you? Sit down. Wait me a second. Bloody computers. He's cute. You want kids? Don't know. I've got a friend who's having a second baby. Really? He's nice. A lot of work. Have you got a boyfriend? Would it help the loan if I did? Maybe. Okay. Now, the business loan. I'm really sorry, Tracy, but there's no way I can approve this loan for you today. I think you probably know why. Okay. But what if I reduce the amount a little bit? I nstead of making it 40 thousand I made it 25. The business is great but it's a lease premises. There's no real capital. If the bank did have to come in, there'll be nothing to recoup on it. The capital'll be built into the new shop. The computers, the stock, the customer base. Tracy, is there someone you can get to help you out with it? Maybe get your dad to go guarantor. That's not gonna happen. I'm not asking for a gift here. I'll be paying it back. Tracy, we did a credit check on you. I'm paying it off. I've organized it. Di... di... I'm paying it off! Look here. "Have you been refused credits in the last ten years?" You ticked the box No when you should've ticked yes. No one ticks Yes. It just meant fucking no! You think by ticking No when you should've ticked Yes is not gonna count against you? We do check these things here, Tracy. We know that you've been charged with credit card fraud. So this bank has never lent money to criminals? Okay, this is impolite. I think we should just take a deep breath. Yeah. Well, sorry to be taking up your precious fucking time! Is it good? Good. Okay. Alright. Good to meet you. Hey, Ray. What were you doing this morning? I saw you on the street, idiot. Open for inspection, mate. We're good. We're good. Any reason you're useful is you're a fucking speck a thousand miles from anyone. If by accident we do meet, you look straight through me and I'll do likewise. Yeh? Yeh, yeh, sure. Whatever. We're still home. I'll get you a cup of tea. I can't do this. It's so fucking ugly. I'm calling an ambulance. No, I don't want an ambulance, Tracy. What do you want? The paid stuff. I n there! I'm sorry, Trace. It's alright. I fucking stink. Don't worry about it. How many times do you do this? Four. Four. Fuck! Is it worth it? In reality bull fucking shit. Lionel, if you can't get it for free anymore, your life is gonna get fucked up really fast. Just gotta be strong. Tracy, shush. Sorry. No, Trace. I went saw Janelle. She hates me. She still hates me. I'm no good, you know. Turned everything to shit. Janelle, you. You've no fucking idea. Mom's life was up to shit before she met you. We were going out to Chinese restaurants with Lionel Dawson. Going down the beach with fucking Lionel fucking Dawson! Then when we went out, we came home in taxis! So we were famous, too. Mom! Mom went, we went fucking mad. We didn't know anyone. This was like a fucking game. No, no. God! It's 'cause you loved us. Alright? You fucking loved us and you didn't have to. I loved both of them. You know I loved them both and they're both fucking gone for me. Your mum and Brad. I really thought that I'd get a happy-ever-after. I didn't... Honestly, Trace, l... I never thought this... Trace, I'm fucking scared. I can't go through another air of this, you know, please. Darling, there's money in the wardrobe, ey? Please, darling, ey? Look, I'm sorry. You know, you know! I can't school for you, Lionel. Fuck! How could you even ask me to? 'Cause there's no one else that fucking has. There's fucking no one. There's fucking no one! Tracy, what the fuck you've been doing? It's not for me. So, how much do you want? Three Gs. Yeah, I can do it. You call this number in ten minutes. You have the correct money? Yeah. Alright? Excuse me. Is there a toilet in there? Yeah, in that door. There's no change, there's no pace Everything within its place Just makes it harder to believe she won't be around And I'm wondering if he'll go or if he'll stay Do you remember nothing stopped us on the field in our day Oh the flame trees will blind the weary driver And there's nothing else could set fire to this town There's no change, there's no pace Everything within its place Just ringing. Trace, it's me. Hey, where are you? At your place. I mean, I thought you might be here. And your mom, she's... Trace, you're alright? What's happened? Did you shut the shop? No. Ming rang here looking for you because the shop was shut up, so you did shut the shop. Yeah, I had to do something. What's that noise? Where are you? She's at the train station. Trace? Trace are you there? What? Do you want a lift? Got me car here. Yeah. I'm on my way. Just wait. Okay? Yeah, alright. I'm gonna go get her. Why is she there? She's getting a train. Oh, funny! You've got no fucking idea what you're dealing with here, have you? You come swanning in here like Lord Prince fucking up himself and Tracy's at the train station, Jonny, where people fucking buy drugs, where they score. Where I have to scrape off and kick her up off the fucking pavement. I'm gonna go get her. Don't you hurt her! Like I hurt Ray. Just bring her home. I'll take her where she wants to go. Lionel? Yeah. It's alright, Trace. Just have to ask him. Can't you see what it costs? You can't keep it up. I own this place and I have the business. Look, I've got things there. I have Jerseys, fine ones. Some of them are priceless, you know. From a priceless past. You go right now, ey? You're so beautiful. Go, hon, you go away. I won't do it again, Lionel. Don't ask me. No, yeah, I understand. Thank you. You know what I think about when I think about you? I think about kissing you. When we used to... just spend the whole afternoon just lying in bed. Kissing. I don't think I've kissed you when I wasn't out of it. Give it a go. That was okay. A bit more. What's wrong? You used to love this. Yeah, I do. I just... I just fall away with it, you know. I just fall away. I told mom I had the loan. And I don't. Now the bank will take me on. Ming thinks I'm turning up to the restaurant on Monday with $40,000. I've done everything I can and I just can't get it. How much have you got? Me? Have you got any money? Yeah. $2,000. How much can you... How much can you borrow from the shop? We've got what, Friday? Saturday, Sunday. You might be able to get near if you had like ten or more. I could put it into some sure markets. I make more than this in a shorter time. People make thousands and millions all over the world this way every day. It's not easy but it can be done. What day is it today? Today is Monday. It's been a week since you crashed. I cannot remember crashing. But I did have this... this terrible nightmare. Sorry. Hello, stranger. Thanks. This is, uh, this is all you can get? Yeh. How many shops you've got now? Just one. They used to be everywhere. Yeah. This is a good sport, ey? How long ago did your mom die? Three years ago now. M ust be worth a bit. Yeah, maybe. So, I don't know. You can make it here say twice a week or so. I mean, this is not going to last long. I put myself out enough getting you there, alright? Yeah, sure. N ice way. Why the fuck did you call? You've got friends in all places. What about your boyfriend? Your business parter. He'd be better placed to help you. A business man, huh? What are you on about? I didn't know who Bradley "the junkie" Thompson is. Yeah, he can't help me. Are you kidding? No. He's closed up. He's retired. He can't help me. Lionel, you've been talking to him? Who have you been talking to, ey? Steven Moss. Ray, what are you doing with Moss? Little Ray. I won't ask you to do this again. I gotta go. Can I help you? Is Jonny Nguyen here? Jonny... N-g-u-y-e-n.

Trace. Yes, I can. - Trace! - Don't grab me! Trace. Fuck off! Tracy! Fuck off. Trace! Tracy! Okay. Okay, alright! Look, this is... Tracy, this is... Tracy, I had to convince my uncle that I had this career. That, that I was okay. I didn't send you away. So, you made a shit, too? I didn't know anything was going to happen between us! It doesn't matter! This is all crap, all of this! Trace... will you fucking look at me? What was this about making $40,000? What was that? Ray and I have a trip to do this weekend. I'll still get you your money. Ray? I can get it for you by Monday. You can have what you want. Ray? You and Ray? So, you're not a stockbroker. You're still a drug dealer. Fuck! I'm sorry, Trace. I thought I could do this for you and you wouldn't be involved. I am fucked! It's just this one time for me. Look at me. We do this with Ray together. We can get what we want. I can't get the loan, mom. Does it mean no? Is it so bad? I mean, you still got your job. You're the manager. That's quite an achievement. I don't want to just have a job! Four years I've been working in that place! Turning up on time. Spending hours chained up in there. What do you want, Tracy? I wanna turn up on Monday with enough cash to be an owner of that business. What else? When Jonny was here the other night, shit, I gave him a hard time. And I thought to myself afterwards, "Where did that come from?" I haven't seen you these last few days since he's been back. Mom! I see a bit of my little girl back. Yeah. Well, it's not that easy, mom. I mean, you know. No, it's not. You would've done something different if you could've, wouldn't you? You would've changed thing for you? Of course. Trace, it's your life. Darling, it's no one else's. Got your card? Yeah. You've got $15 in overdue. Do you want to fix it a month? Would you pay a couple of dollars off it today? Alright. This guy will fix it. Thanks for this. No worries I need the money. How much is here? Eight. So, do you bring it back? Yeah, we got a buyer. How far out is it? A couple of hours. South. Okay, I'm coming with you. No, she's not. I go where that money goes. Fuck! Okay, Tania, it's discussed if we don't reach the reserve. You talk to him. You have law in negotiations. I can't go there today. Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, this is very exciting. U h! What did you do that for? 'Cause you're here and you fucking shouldn't be. Fucking hurt my head. Is it bleeding? Why are you in my house? It was a fucking shit week. I've heard from credible sources that you aren't retiring. That makes you a full blind prick, you know. Say it again. You heard me. Lionel, who told you I wasn't retiring? You should talk to Steven. Alright. Let's have a look at that. That's alright. I kind of liked it. Come with me. I'll sort you out. Steven, If I drive down to my place at M ilton, what am I gonna find there? Don't know. I haven't been there in years. Well, they asked me. Hey, hello! Long time. Hi, Jenny. Meet you at mom's? Yeah, it'll be alright. Hello, darling. I'll brush your hair. Good to see you, Brad. Lionel. That stuff alone? Yeah, four, please. See ya. I own that place. It's in my name. I know that.

Steven, c'mon! Fuck. You can't smoke in here, mate. This is nice, ey. Yes, it's very nice. Steven... I know how much you earn. I know how much your fucking mortgage is. You tell me everything, you bloody idiot. This is all new! Lionel, wait in the car, will you? Just tell me the truth. What have you been doing under my name behind my fucking back? One final call. I'll find out. You are in such... shit. He's the one you have to worry about, Bradley. This feeling you've got now, this worry, this terror, I never had that. You're in trouble now. I can smell it coming off you. Will you drive, Lionel? Alright. Drive the car. Yeah, sure. I'm gonna fucking sort this out. I need some information. Lionel, are you there? These are okay? Ey? Thanks. What's going on there? C'mon, Trace. You know how to love someone. Just fucking dive in. What put you down with the place, Brad? Steven fucking Moss. That fuck. I fucking warned him. Come on. A cup of tea, ey? I'd like just to clear that quickly. We passed him on the road. What's wrong with you? Nothing. What about that shit I got you? I'm not gonna get on. Maybe when I'm clean we can build a house here, ey? Lionel is a fuck physique. Yeah, but you know what you said to Steven. Like you said I've been in situations. You know, you said I was great. I love you, Brad. I miss you. Anything you ever loved is this. That's not the fucking true. Listen to me, Lionel, it's this Ray Heart. Do you know him? No, no. How much is the truth?

This is Lionel here. Tracy, I'm sorry about this week about asking you that and fuck up this for sure. The last thing I ever wanna do is put you in any danger of sliding back, you know. I understand you can't see me for a while, but smile. Just wanted to say thank you for everything you've done, you know. Let you know that I'm really good. Gonna really sort out this time and next time I see you, it'll be really good, ey? So, my shiny, shiny girl, take good care of yourself and, yeah... Alright, love. Bye, love. Kids out driving Saturday afternoon just pass me by I'm just savouring familiar sights We share some history this town and I And I can't stop that long forgotten feeling of her Try to book a room to stay tonight N umber one is to find some friends to say, "You're doing well After all this time you boys look just the same" N umber two is the happy hour at one of two hotels Settle into play "Do you remember so and so" N umber three is never say her name Oh the flame trees will blind the weary driver and there's nothing else could set fire to this town There's no change, there's no pace Everything within its place Just makes it harder to believe she won't be around And I'm wondering if he'll go or if he'll stay Do you remember nothing stopped us on the field in our days Oh the flame trees will blind the weary driver and there's nothing else could set fire to this town There's no change, there's no pace Everything within its place Just makes it harder to believe she won't be around There's no change, there's no pace Everything within its place Just makes it harder to believe she won't be around
