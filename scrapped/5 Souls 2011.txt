TV REPORTER: Several deaths and multiple injuries have been reported in a building collapse in Dallas early this morning. Now, we're told construction on the building was recently completed by Bickman International. No statement has been released as of yet from company president David Bickman. Now, the number of casualties are still uncertain, but we do know that there were people inside this building at the time of the collapse. # [HARD ROCK] Shit. [MUSIC STOPS] [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] [VIBRATING CONTINUES] Hey, Jenn. - You're late. - I know. I got held up at work. I'm sorry. How's Brangelina? Same old, same old. Another tabloid, another settlement. How do you turn the volume up on this thing? Sorry about your wedding. You have no idea. I don't know what I did to deserve her. Lucky bitch. That's not very nice. You can go on back. Dr. Michaels will see you now. How are you feeling? Any wedding jitters? No! No, no, no. No cold feet here, Doc. True love. Lucky girl. Lucky boy. I tell ya, I've been waiting my entire life for this girl. So Africa, huh? Yeah, I've always wanted to go on safari, and she's never left the country, so... dream come true. Roll your sleeve up. So, uh, what are you giving me? Hep-A, typhoid, yellow fever, polio and cholera. I should've given you these vaccines about four weeks ago. And not all at one time. It's all right, Doc. Don't worry about it. I'm tough. Did I ever tell you my uncle was the first actor to be picked to play Spartacus. [GRUNTS] Jesus! Nope. Just Dr. Michael. Are you hallucinating already? Number of casualties are still uncertain, but we do know that there were people inside this building at the time of the collapse. Are you okay? My Lord. Those poor families. Jenn, let the woman in. For Christ's sake. There's nobody else here. It's embarrassing. What? Seriously, how long are you gonna make her wait? What are you talking about? Several deaths and multiple injuries have been reported in a building collapse in Dallas early this morning. Now, the number of casualties are still uncertain, but we do know that there were people inside this building at the time of the collapse. What building is that? Quorum Drive. - Turn it up. - Excuse me? - Volume! Volume! Turn it up! - Okay! Okay! We are also confirmed that Bickman Development Corporation were the contractors. We hope to know more, and we expect a statement from president and CEO David Bickman within the hour. I need a phone. I believe you left it in the car, Noah. [HEART BEATING] What did you say? I said, I left mine in the car, young man. - I need a phone. - Noah, are you all right? - Give me a goddamn phone. - Just calm down. Dr. Michaels? Noah! Noah, look at me. Noah! Noah, are you all right? Can you hear me? Noah! Noah! Excuse me. This is a restricted area. I'm with the National Institute of Standards and Technology. I'm gonna need to see some credentials, Mr. NIST. We're all fighting the same fight, Miss... Detective. Ms. Detective. This wasn't a federal building. We investigate all building failures in the U.S. Well, I don't care if you singlehandedly solve every single one of them. I'm still gonna need to see your credentials. Or I can escort you off the property. Seriously? You're gonna bust my balls and make me go get my I.D. from the car, instead of letting me do my job? All right, just wear it next time. Thank you, Detective. Walters. Sarah. Detective Walters. Reynolds. Damn. Goddamn, man. What's up, partner? [CHUCKLES] You know this kind of thing brings out all the crazies. You know you're not allowed around here, right? Detective Walters was just escorting me out. That's all right. I'll escort you. No, I'm good. Thank you. [MONITOR BEEPING] [WHIMPERING] [BEEPING CONTINUES] [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [BREATHING] Where am I? You're in the hospital. What happened to me? Procrastination. Nasty reaction to the vaccine cocktail the good doctor served you. Where's Miranda? Thank God I'm okay. You're very presumptuous, though. I like that. You know exactly the state of things. Who are you? I'm just a resident. What the hell does that mean? You want the good news or the bad news first? Good news. I'm here to kill you. Oh. Okay. I think you need to be getting back to the mental ward now. Fine. We'll start with the bad news then. Do me a favor and stop talking. The bad news... or the truth. Whatever you want to call it. It does have to be given at some point before the end, and I truly do hate that I have to give way to it. I'd much rather just get on with the good news portion... and kill you. I think it's time for you to leave now. It'd be nice to continue with your reality, but I gots me a job to do. Probably doesn't make any difference to you because you're clearly insane, but I'm not following you, man, so if you could just... But you have been following. What the fuck? Stop. Bit by bit, step by step, every day, every week. Perfectly, in fact. And now it's time to pay the piper. Oh, shit! And I'm the piper. # [ROCK] That's bullshit. I drank three last time. I completely beat you. - You want to rack it? - I can't party all night. Alison's busting his balls again. Speaking of, you want to hit a few? Yeah, let's do it. I'll be right back. [MUMBLES] Hi. Sam, right? Right. Sarah. Right. Hey, thanks for not making me not look like a idiot out there today in front of my crew. You know, for believing your whole story. Not a problem. Yeah, right. I wouldn't have believed me. Okay, are you socially retarded? You know, you mind if I have a seat? This has been hell on the workers, you know. There was this young mother today. She was waiting. She wouldn't leave. She kept praying that her kid's gonna come out of there okay. She should go home. It's called hope. It's where people go to avoid reality. How could you say that? Because I'm very familiar with reality. Her time would be better spent planning a funeral. What are you having? Uh, nothing. So... Sarah, are you always so eager to engage strangers both on and off duty? No. I just... I don't know, you seem... What do I seem? You seem lost. What makes you think I want to be found? # [BLUES] # Tell me what did I do # To bring on this bad juju # The omens, they never lie # All this, on this I can rely # Are you sure? Do I sound unsure? # Dreams untrue, I see Psych-a-boo! Please? Pretty please? Well, since you put it that way... So what's the verdict? Hallucination or reality? - Help! - [SCREAMS] [BOTH SCREAMING] [CHUCKLING] I like the screaming. Makes me homesick. Noah... You realize no one can hear you. Murder! [SCREAMS] So I am dead. Not yet. Are you the devil? No! Angel? Once upon a time. [BED FRAME RATTLING] Fuck you, dude. No, fuck this! No! Who the fuck are you? Why me? Why me? I can't tell you how many times I've heard that, and it never gets old. Stop! Just listen. I love my life. I love my life. Yeah, see that right there is the reason I get to kill you. Even want to take you soul. Let me give you the quick truth, Noah, as it is in on earth, so it is in heaven. Or in your case, hell. No! You are mine, you disgusting, self-absorbed, putrid little fucker. I love my life. All right! I'm convinced! You want to live. So here's what I'm gonna do for you, Noah. Think of it as a test. You're gonna kill for me so I don't have to. No. No, I can't do that. There's gotta be another way. There's gotta be like a loophole. Oh! I like your style, Noah. I like the way you think. I believe we are now on the same page 'cause I love cutting corners for the sake of convenience. I understand. I do. I'd probably hesitate, too. Count my costs, weigh my options, if I was in your condition. Well, listen, Noah, the soul I've chosen for you, he's sick. Barely hanging on by a thread. Shit, you're almost doing him a favor. So what do you say? Kill for me, Noah. Show me what you're really made of, and you can live. Room 223. [BEEPING] What did you do to yourself? Please come back to me. Room 223. [MONITOR BEEPING] [BEEPING CONTINUES] [RAPID BEEPING] [SUSTAINED BEEP] [GASPING] [SUSTAINED BEEP] [SOBBING] Who's there? I know you're there. Say something. You're just going to leave? Uh... I'm sorry. I'm in the wrong room. I made... It's my mistake. Oh. Do you need me to help you? How can you help me? Back to your bed. No. I know exactly where I am. But you? You don't know where you are... or where you're going. Did you like it? What? Well... my ass. How did it look? It's flattering, actually. Makes me think you might listen, if only for the view. You're blind, and you know that I'm here. The doctors and the nurses, they're not blind, but they can't see me. No one can see you like I can, Noah. I can smell your fear, you know. I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do. Do you want my help? How can you help me? Tell me who you are. You don't want to know. Are you scared to find out? I'm sorry that I disturbed you. Noah! He who lays down his life for the truth... can save it. Jesus God, help me. Hah! Ah, my Noah... it's a little late to be calling on the Savior now. I haven't been close to anyone for a long time. Yeah. Matt said you lost your family. My daughter Dani, she was... she was the only good thing in my life. What happened? I was late. I was supposed to pick up Dani, but I was always fucking late. She must of thought she saw me walk into this building. The building collapsed. It was like some fucking Greek tragedy. What caused the collapse? Greed. What the hell are you doing here? Investigating. You're a long way from Houston, boy. And as I recall, you ain't a cop anymore. Just a couple seconds, guys. I'm just a concerned citizen. Say what... what this make it? Is that two for Bickman International? Now what are the chances of that? It's a horrible tragedy. Tragedy seems to follow you around. Reynolds, my office is in compliance with every federal, state, and local ordinance. You know, we did all we could after the accident. Motherfuck! You killed my family! Are you sure you want to go here again, boy? Get this piece of shit off my property. [RINGING] Hello? Hey, Miranda. Hi, David. How you holding up? [SIGHS] I just can't believe this is happening. How's Noah? They can't tell me what's going on. The doctors don't know, and, um... he's unresponsive. Well, I just want to make sure that you and Noah can continue on with your lives together when he does wake up. What do you mean? Well, people are starting to ask a lot of questions. I want to make sure we got nothing to worry about. I understand. [MONITOR BEEPING] I'm wasting my mercy on you. Wake the fuck up, bitch. And stop lying there visible. Cunt. She can't help you. This is about saving yourself. Why are you still here? I did what you asked. Yeah, you did, and you did it splendidly. You passed your first test, Noah, with flying colors. Leave me alone. I want my life back. I will... just as soon as you fulfill my quota for me. What? That's not what you said. I came here for five souls, and you will take them all for me. Just think, only four more, and you'll be free. No. The next is a woman. All alone. I can't. No. It's your choice. Death... [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING SUBSIDES] Or life. Remember, Noah, it's my will be done. [MACHINE WHIRRING] [WHIRRING] [WHIRRING] Goddamn it, Sam. You think this is a joke? - You were fucking lucky. - What? The history that you and Bickman have, and you used to... You are lucky that you are not behind bars. He's a goddamn soul merchant, Sarah, scarifying innocent people for a few fucking dollars. You know, he's right. You are goddamn insane. You forget about a little thing called judicial procedure or, I don't know, admissible evidence. I tried that! It didn't work! Okay, so what are you gonna do, beat him up? Two whiskeys, please. What do you really know about Bickman? Meaning? Meaning has your two-year obsession left you with anything other than a hangover. Why? Are you gonna help me? Hmph. No. You're gonna help me. Your knowledge of Bickman is going to be used as part of an investigation, not a vendetta, and you are going to do things my way, or we can call it a night. Is that gonna work for you? Yeah. Fuck you. These are both for me. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us... So what am I supposed to say? Nothing. Wait here. Hi, guys. We're here to see David Bickman. And I'm gonna need a guest pass as well. Great. Thank you. Put this on. [DING] Mr. Reynolds, do I need to alert security and have them waiting for you when you get upstairs? Mr. Bickman, Detective Walters. We spoke on the phone earlier. Mr. Reynolds is part of the investigation as well. Well, you just see to it that you keep a good eye on him. [DING] This is our conference room. I'm gonna set up a workspace for you to use. The file room is upstairs. User name is "Bickman." Password is "Bickman Guest." In addition to the hard copies of every document surrounding the Quorum building, you'll be able to have access to our company files downstairs on the computer. Got it? [MONITOR BEEPING] Jesus Christ. He made me do it. He made me do it. He made me do it. He made me do it. [BEEPING CONTINUES] [RAPID BEEPING] Nurse! [RAPID BEEPING CONTINUES] He's dreaming. He must be having a nightmare. [PANTING] What the fuck! Goddamn it! The old man is trying to kill me, and the woman, she had me. This is an unfortunate side effect of our business. Miranda came in, and they disappeared. Thank God. You must thank him. You say all this bullshit, I don't even know what the fuck that means. I'm not doing this anymore. You need to take more pride in your work, Noah. Fuck you! Forget remorse, guilt, all that religious swill. It's useless here. It's too late. I found that there are two lies that maximize human suffering. You'll need to understand this. My job is to ensure that everyone believes these lies are true. On the one hand, I help people believe that this world is a hopeless place. Focusing only on their tragedies, their lives become a prison of guilt and shame. And then there are those like you, with your intellect and manipulations. You take what you want from others. You believe the lie that you're entitled and invincible. I'm sorry. I was wrong. Please. I'm sorry Don't apologize! You work hard to get what you want. You work hard to get what you want, and this is the only way you'll be allowed to keep it. Stop pretending you have any morality or conscience. Now you know the truth. And the truth will set you free. Is that really your Captain's card you're gonna give to Bickman? This manifest says the steel is of Philippine origin. You're not gonna answer my question, are you? No. But the cost report references a Taiwanese manufacturer. - Type A National Steelworks? - Yeah. Do think that means something? Do you think they were using cheap Philippine steel and trying to cover up the evidence? Oh. Philippine National's a subsidiary... Of Type A Steel. And somebody approved as a supplier. It was a lie. Kind of like police work, huh? Just a little less fuzzy with you around. It's still a dead end. No. No, it's not. They fuck up somewhere. They always fuck up somewhere, and we're gonna find it. Hey, Sarah. Yeah? Thanks. For what? For being here. Means a lot to me. You're welcome. So what's your story? What do you mean? Well... there's gotta be a reason why someone like you would be attracted to someone so damaged. Are you asking me this 'cause I'm easy? Did your dad leave you when you were a little girl? You're an ass. Shit. Fuck. Uh... I'm sorry. Don't go. If I wanted to be insulted, I would've worked the graveyard shift at the precinct tonight. Yeah, my dad did leave when I was five, and my mom had to support us all on her own. She had to work two jobs just to put enough food on the table, and I retaliated by treating her like shit, and then she died. That's fucked up. Yeah, well, I dealt with it, and I moved on. It's what you should be doing. You see me? Do I know you? I'm Noah. - I'm... - I don't wanna know your name. What do you want? I'm here to kill you. No! No, please, no! Help me, someone! Please don't! Please! It's you or me. And I choose me. - Hey. - Hmm? You think it's something? I do. It has the same titles as one of these. Look. Right? I knew you'd come back. Talk to me. You have to talk to me. You need to talk to me. Why me? Why is this happening to me? Do you mean why do you make the choices that you make? There's no other way. There was no other choice. You came here to find answers. To find redemption. Don't lie to yourself. I'm passed redemption. God won't forgive me. Don't believe the lies. It's too late. Look at me. What do you see? Beauty... and innocence... and hope... trapped inside of a blind body. Yet I'm free. Free to imagine what you look like... and free to chose to roam in a prison of darkness. No more lies. Noah... Yes? Do you know what lives in the darkness? Monsters. I am the monster. We're not made for the darkness Maybe you're right. About what? I'm crazy. Well, step one is realizing that you have a problem. Seriously, I've been chasing this asshole for two years. He's way too good at covering things up. I never got anyone to turn on him. Don't doubt yourself, Sam. You're a good cop. Now check this out. There was an empty folder on the server desktop, so I checked the registry. Last person to log in, other than us, was Miranda Hawkins two nights ago at 11:38 pm. It appears that Ms. Hawkins deleted over 180 files. But with the right software, I might recover some of them. I have a better idea. Why don't we find her and see what she knows? [DISTANT CRYING] [CRYING CONTINUES] [CRYING CONTINUES] Oh, fuck me. [HISSING] Why? Why did you take me away from my son? Mateo. I have to find Mateo. You should never kill a girl without kissing her first. Please make them leave me alone. What? What? So now you're the victim? You're the victim? You murder them and then begrudge them a little bit of payback. I think you're starting to get this now, how this works, how we work. I can't do this anymore. No, no, no, no, no. Let's not confuse what's going on here, huh? Your Jesus deceived your life, not me, not me. I can't. Don't make me do this. Don't make me, don't make me. What, kill? [CHUCKLES] Kill... I'm killing... You've killed definitely not for God's sake. For mine, you fucking ingrate! For me! Because I want it. Now bring me number four. - What's this? - Huh? - Jesus Christ, Sam. - Huh? Christ, that's just, um... That's Bickman trying to get to us. Does that mean it's not true? No. Jesus Christ, Sam, a sealed grand jury? Captain said stay away. I couldn't do that So you put him in the hospital? I figured Matt would've told you. That is bullshit. I am one phone call away from running mall security for the rest of my career. - It's gonna be okay. - No, it is not gonna be okay. I'm not following you down some fucking rabbit hole. Sarah, listen, this is exactly what Bickman wants. He wants us to fight. We got this. You got this. We gotta get to Miranda. This one's easy. He won't miss the life he's never had. [GASPING] [BEEPING] [RAPID BEEPING] [SUSTAINED BEEP] Can I help you? Miranda Hawkins? Who are you? Detective Walters, DPD. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions? Regarding? The Bickman construction collapse on Quorum Drive. I work for Bickman, but I don't get to go to his tower and glass headquarters. We're in a warehouse down at the port. So you haven't been there lately. No. Why do you ask? What is it that your department does exactly, Miranda? We purchase construction materials. How long have you worked there? Just since we moved to Dallas. Before that I worked at an office that specialized in importing building materials. Is Bickman one of your clients? Yes. That's how I got the job. Do you plan on leaving town anytime soon, Ms. Hawkins? We're not made for the darkness. What have you done, Noah? I'm here for you, Noah. I didn't want to lose you. Then come with me. Remember how it use to be. It's never too late to turn back, Noah. What if you're wrong? What if I'm right? And that, gentlemen, is why we are down 50% in profit. Morning, David. Excuse me, Mr. Bickman, sir, I tried to stop him. Give me a coffee. Everybody get out. What do you want? Miranda Hawkins. Miranda's head of the purchasing department. Lovely girl. It is a shame, though. What? Well, that her fianc Noah's in a coma. Why do I give a fuck? He's an architect here. He was head of the Quorum project. Oh, you didn't know that. I am afraid he's not gonna make it. Not this time, uh-uh. I've figured it out, what you did in Houston. You used Miranda's company to bring in materials, then you sold and resold through local companies so that the origin would not become an issue. I sincerely hope that Miranda's not trying to implicate me in anything that she or her fianc got tangled up in. Funny thing is the paper trail leads right back to your door. This time I can prove it. Innocent people died, you fuck. And you're gonna be held accountable. Don't you threaten me, Reynolds. If you got proof, then you lay it on the table right now, otherwise you get the fuck out of my office. You know what, David? First time was negligent homicide. This time it's murder. Too bad it wasn't another member of your family in there. [MONITOR BEEPING] What are you doing here? I'm praying for you. I'm passed that. He's not listening. You can come out of this, Noah. You can beat them. I can't. Stop waiting for me! I have to. It's your soul. You're beautiful, the soul that you're going to give away. Don't you love yourself more than that? I love myself enough to do whatever it takes. I want to live. I want to go on, and that is my antidote. Don't you fucking judge me. We can't all be as perfect as you. Do I look perfect to you, Noah? You made us this way. You didn't have to do this to us. To me. He's coming. And he's stronger than me now. Don't forget me. Twice. Only this time, it's not trespassing, is it? What do you want from me, Sarah? How about what you promised? That you were gonna do it right, no crazy psycho bullshit. - I had to find out. - Oh, and now you did. You found out that in 10 days you're gonna be arranged on felony assault charges, that the city of Dallas issued an official apology to Bickman, and that I'm suspended without pay. Are you happy now? And you just ensured he's gonna get away with it. Get out of the car. [MONITOR BEEPING] [CHUCKLES] You look like hell. Listen, my boy. Just think about this. One more soul. One more soul, and you'll have crossed through your own personal hell. I may even indulge myself and help you over the final threshold. Who is it? You're so close to finishing your masterpiece. You only have one more soul. In your heart, Noah, you knew. You knew you didn't deserve the life you planned. And now, my friend, you'll make the right decision again. Bickman told me that Miranda's fianc's in a coma, so I followed her here. If I can get Miranda to talk, I can get her turn on Bickman. Oh, come on, Sam, really? You want me to arrest her while I'm on suspension? For what? I don't care. Bickman's about to pin this on the fianc. - We questioned her already. - Not in front of him. We can't let him walk. By the book. Noah. Are you awake, or am I dreaming? I'm awake. I'm gonna go get the nurse. No. Stay. Stay for a minute. I just wanna hold you. I didn't think you were coming back to me. - I'm back. - [CHUCKLES] I came back for you. I missed you. I dreamt about you. There's so much I have to tell you. There's so much I have to say. Shh. I love you. I love you, too. Everything's gonna be perfect. We have enough money. And I'm gonna stop everything. I already have. We just... We have to go away and not come back, okay? He was the architect, she was the buyer. Bickman was the boss. It was a chain. They're all accessories to murder. I am so sorry that I made you do those things. I know you didn't want to, but... it was for us. It is for us, and I took care of everything. The bodies. What? They haunt me. Shh. No. I took care of everything, the evidence. It's all gone. Nobody needs to know. But you're gonna haunt me, too. Babe. Baby, stop. You're scaring... It's okay. Noah, stop. No. Hi. I'm looking for Noah Benedict's room. Through the double doors, 214 on the left. Great. Thank you. Noah, you're hurting me. Stop. Noah, sto... [SCREAMS] No! [RAPID BEEPING] Oh, my God. Hey! Oh, jeez... Sam! Sam! Help! - [GRUNTS] - [SUSTAINED BEEP] Oh, Jesus Christ. Code blue, 214. I love you, Dad. SARAH: Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam, Sam. Are you okay? I'm fine. Hey, did I ever show you a picture of my daughter? She's beautiful. Yeah, she is. Now what? [SUSTAINED BEEP] You made it. You delivered. Am I alive? More than you know. What does that mean? You really don't give much thought about things, do you, Noah? I mean, other than what you can get out of it. Don't get me wrong. You passed. With perfect marks. Passed what? You killed, never asked questions. You just followed orders. Just like in life. You made deal after deal with Bickman. You made your fiance happy and rich. Your greed and manipulations began at an early age. But they blossomed... into profit and opportunity with Bickman. And it all led to this building. You remember the building, don't you? You helped build it, you and Miranda. Yes. Inside the rubble... are the four people you, Miranda and Bickman killed. So the question is, as per usual: If a person knew... that his choices would lead to someone else's death, would his choices have been different if he knew? And you killed them again... in person this time, with your own hands. To survive, you will kill anyone. Absolutely anyone. And that is what makes you perfect. What's next? It's your job now, Noah. You know what you need to do. # [ROCK] # If there's a will # We'll find a way # I can't bear to wait until this day # # I run like a murderer # Fear, don't let me fear # Don't let me fear # Don't let me stop # Fear, don't let me fear # Don't let me fear # Don't let me stop # If there's a light # We'll find the day # I pick up remains # I'll turn the other way # You run like a murderer # Fear, don't let me fear # Don't let me fear # Don't let me
