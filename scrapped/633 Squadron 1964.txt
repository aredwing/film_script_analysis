 

                        Come on! Hardly touched us. Bring my gloves, Evans? Right you are, man. Greiner, make a note of that flak tower. Well done, Digger. Yeah, it's not bad, is it? - Got a light, old boy? - There you go. That Jerry ammunition truck made a pretty tempting target. So did you when you broke formation. How did I know I'd run into a flak tower? Know what I'm gonna do, Gillibrand? No, sir. I'll recommend you for a medal. Thanks very much, Skipper. I appreciate that. When it comes, I'll pin it right on your tail. Roy, what are you doing on your leave? Sleep for three days. Who with? I'm heading right for Hyde Park. Why Hyde Park? I thought ducks were out of season. Not the kind of birds I'm after. How about you, Scott? Anywhere I don't have to look at aircraft. Group Captain Barratt wants to see you. He says it's urgent. Scott, take care of the debriefing. - Right, Skipper. - What's up? Thank you. Hello, Roy. Don, what's happening? We've got visitors. - Sir. - Come in, Barratt. This is Wing Commander Grant and Squadron Leader Adams. Air Vice Marshal Davis and Lieutenant Bergman. Glad to meet you, Grant. - How do you do? - How are you? Sit down, gentlemen. Congratulations, Grant. I hear today's operation was a great success. We all got back, sir. Good. There'll be no more operations... for your squadron for the next 17 days. You mean we're on leave, sir? No, I don't. All leave is cancelled until further orders. 633 Squadron are assigned an urgent secret operation. Your men are going into training for it. That's all they need know. Mind if I ask a question? - Yes? - Why our squadron? What do you mean? Some men have been on 12 strikes in two weeks. They're tired and looking forward to leave. They'll have to wait. All leave is cancelled. Since you took over... your squadron has attained a high degree of efficiency. Look upon this assignment as a reward. I'll try to, sir. Now, for the operation. The Germans have been building mysterious concrete blocks... up and down France and Belgium. Intelligence have come up with the answer to what they are. They're rocket launching pads. The Huns have got a new operational rocket. D-Day is imminent. These rockets could smash the invasion... and they're ready by the thousands. Why don't they use them? Fuel. Without special fuel, these rockets are so much scrap. Now we come to why Lieutenant Bergman is here. He's one of the leaders of the Norwegian Linge... the resistance. They have discovered the location... of the only factory the Nazis have at present... which can make fuel for these rockets. It's at a fjord just north of Bergen. Bergen. Here's the fjord. It's called the Swartsfjord... the Black Water fjord. As to the exact location of the factory... I'll let Lieutenant Bergman tell you. First, I must explain that the factory itself... is not the target. It's not the target? The factory is bomb-proof and sheltered by a huge cliff. Then what do we bomb? The mountain. You'll blow away the whole overhanging cliff... so that it buries the factory. I should explain why you cannot bomb from above. We brought in geologists to study this mountain. There is a fissure underneath the overhang. If you explode from below, the overhanging cliff... will come down, we hope. The only way to get into position... is to fly up the fjord at about 200 feet. The Huns have flak posts at the mouth of the fjord. At 200 feet, you'll be blown to hell... which brings me back to Bergman. At an exact hour on M-Day, the day of our mission... Bergman and his men will neutralize the flak posts. If all goes well... you should have a clear run up the fjord. If all goes well. The factory will be shipping fuel in 18 days. Your special bombs will be ready in 17. Today is "M" minus 17. Your orders are to obliterate the target at whatever cost. Any questions? Lieutenant Bergman will be working closely with you. He knows the target well. What are we practicing on? We've found a valley in Scotland. It's not nearly as tough as the fjord... but it's the best we can do. - Barratt? - Sir? This gives you exact schedules and routes... to the training site. Training to commence immediately. That's all, gentlemen. Will you find Lieutenant Bergman suitable quarters? I certainly will, sir. Nice to have you with us, Lieutenant. Thank you very much. Wing Commander! I wanted to tell you how pleased I am... they chose you for this operation. I'm glad you are, Lieutenant. Wish I felt the same. You give me the impression of doing difficult things. I do what they tell me to do. This is terribly important. That's what they always say. You sound so cynical. Do I? You have not seen the Nazis at close range. - Close enough. - In the air, yes. But I have seen them in my own country... torturing and killing innocent people. So you want to bury them under that mountain? Yes, if it will help win the war. Look, as long as we're working together... we might as well understand each other. We'll do the best job we can... but it's a job, not the Holy Grail, OK? I will try to remember that. You do that. Climb in, Lieutenant. I'll drive you to your quarters. Thank you. "X" marks the spot. Our climb was slow. We'll have to increase our approach speed to 290. How are we going to bomb the target... even if we get the right approach speed? That's what we're here to find out. Made eight passes already, and each one's a bust. Skipper, let's sit this one out. Don't you trust me, Hoppy? Like my dear old mum... but this one's a bit dicey. I thought you wanted to see Scotland. Yeah, but not upside down. You had a good day, Grant. Not good enough. I'll try again tomorrow. That's yesterday, today, tomorrow. Three days out of your 17, Roy. Perhaps you'd better take the squadron. All right. I wish there was some way to see that target. I could describe it to you, every detail. Wasn't Bissel an artist? The center peak is higher. This one? Yes. And the cliff hangs over more. Fine. What's this all about, Skipper? You'll find out soon enough. I see. Sort of hush-hush? You sure that's the way it is? As you remember it? Yes. That's as good as a photograph. Good. Thanks, Bissel. Sir. Bissel, how you making out with Mary what's-her-name? - Mary Blake? - Yeah. It's sort of hush-hush... but we're getting married. He's out of his head. Don't you approve of war marriages? No. Not for me. You don't want any attachments? That's right. How wide is that fjord? Not over 200 yards. What's on the other side of the fjord? A lake. A large lake. What's that? A sail boat. My sister Hilde and I used to go sailing there. She's in England now. How'd she get out of Norway? We smuggled her out in a fishing boat... just after our parents were killed. And your parents, Roy, where are they? My mother's dead. I haven't seen my father since I was a kid. I have been more fortunate. My memories before the war were happy ones. What did you do before the war? I was studying to become a doctor... until the Nazis came. Instead of learning how to cure... we learned how to kill. I will send word! With all these reinforcements... do you think they'll call off the attack? Not if Erik can help it. There are many more Germans. We'll spread ourselves thinner and start 24-hour patrols. Thanks. Stand easy, gentlemen. I've called you here... because I've just had a message from Intelligence. The Germans have moved in another entire regiment... and a string of Ack-Ack vehicles a mile long... right into our target area. Our underground cannot knock out another German regiment. We have not enough men. Get some more. If we can, they will need training. What about a parachute attack? It would not work. There is no place to land or group. Commandos. They can work their way into the fjord. We have discarded that idea a dozen times. We have to send in more men, trained or not. Could we have more time? There is no more time. M-Day stands. In that case, we will do the best we can. Well, Grant? I didn't say anything, sir. No, but I could hear you thinking. Under the new circumstances, are you willing to go in? Are you asking me to volunteer? No, damn it, I'm not. I'm giving you an order. In that case, I volunteer. How'd we do? Perfect. Wish it'd been the Germans down there. Try and match that. Speed... 295, dead on. Altitude... 200 feet, and keep it low. Peel off in this order... Scott... Gillibrand... Singh. I don't know why you ever left that coal mine. That's what I could do with right now... a nice, deep, cozy coal mine. If I make a mess of this... you'll be deeper than any coal mine. Scott, peel! Gillibrand, peel! Stand by, Singh. Peel! Now! You fool! You bloody Australian fool! I'm getting married. Try and remember that. How could I forget it? I was figuring on getting the widow. I love your raw colonial humor. Bloody aborigine! Too close, Gillibrand. Pull up sooner. OK, Skipper! Do you think they'll ever get it? Give them a week. They'll get it. Look! This way! - Thanks. - What? - You saved my neck. - Why shouldn't I? You're damn lucky they didn't get you. Look out! Listen, there I was... with this Messerschmitt coming in at twelve o'clock. I was out of ammunition. What did you do then? I opened the escape hatch, reached up... grabbed him by the tail and pulled him down. Now there's a really beautiful sight. Haven't you seen a pair of legs before, you big ape? Not like yours, sweetheart. What's the matter with you, Aussie? Don't they let you see girls till you're over 40? They don't have girls Down Under. Down under what? - Here comes Rosie! - Stand back, lads! Stop it. Come on. - Come here! - Let her go. I'll ask you to step aside, sir. I'll step aside, if you step outside with me. Don't listen to him. We'll live in Australia and raise kangaroos. - Marry me. - Belt him one. You wouldn't hit a lad with one hand? Depends what he's doing with it. Break it up, boys. I will see you through. A gentleman at last. Here we are. Keep you hale and hearty till you're ninety. That's our aim, Rosie. Hale and hearty till we're ninety. What do you suppose those special bombs are for? Not what, who. I got it straight from the Adjutant's WAAF. They're for the paper-hanger. Berchtesgarten? Wow! One of these bullets clipped me right on the hand. This medic came up and said... "Shall I take you to the infirmary, sir?" I said, "No, but drop this off at the garage." That's for me. Just my type. What makes you think you'll get first crack? Rank, old boy. Excuse me. I wonder if I might entice you... into joining me for a drink, my love? - Erik! - Hilde! It's been such a long time. Three years. Sometimes I was so afraid I might never see you again. You know me better than that. Of course. Let me have a look at you. What a fine uniform. The navy, isn't it? Yes. Unfortunately a navy without ships. I don't care. As long as you're safe and not in Norway... I think we've broken up the party. Let's go into the parlor. I have so many questions to ask... I don't know where to start. Some chaps have all the luck. Don't be silly. That's Lieutenant Bergman's sister. I've got a sister. Would you like to see a photograph? What use is a photograph? Anyway, she probably looks like you. Same again, Mr. Kearns. This round's on my sister. Rosie! How about some music? Who's next? Let's get another pint of that going. Welcome aboard, Skipper! Come in, girls! Don't be shy! There you are! Sit right here, darling! Well played! - What are you drinking, Skipper? - What do you got? - Whiskey? - That's what we're drinking. Hey, girls, girls? How'd you break out of the barracks? Roy brought a ladder, didn't you? - A little second story work. - Here you are, Skipper. You've arrived just in time to make the party complete! - Here's to girls! - All of 'em! Haven't met all of them. You haven't met Bergman's sister. She's in the other room. Here's to the one I haven't met. Go on. That's all. That is how I got to England. And now you work for the English? Yes, with the RAF squadron as liaison officer... but that is all I'm permitted to tell you. Enough about me. What have you been doing? I have been working in the country... with children who have been sent out of the bombed areas. Roy, come in. I'd like you to meet my sister Hilde. - Wing Commander Grant. - How do you do? I was just drinking a toast to you. Thank you. My brother has been telling me about you. You're the girl in the sail boat, aren't you? Sail boat? I was telling Roy about the times... we went sailing on our lake. Yes, I remember, but I felt much younger then. The last three years seem more like three hundred. You're a mighty pretty old lady. Thank you, again... but you don't have to pay me compliments. Just take care of my brother. We take care of each other. Mutual Aid Society. Roy? Your drink's getting warm. Excuse me. I was just looking for you. I bet you were. Is that his fiance? He would be amused to hear you say that. No, I don't think he takes her too seriously. I feel he doesn't take anything seriously. But they are all like that, different from us. The more they feel something, the less they show it. Today some of their friends were killed... and tonight they are drinking, very gay. And you feel that he is dependable... for whatever it is you're doing? Yes. Completely. Good morning. Good hit, Gillibrand. Roger. Out, Skip. Now! Blue Leader to Jones, you're up. Clobber it. OK, Skipper! What went wrong? Their luck ran out. Blue Leader to squadron. Form on Scott, return to station. Come in. Sorry to disturb you. I wanted to speak to you. Come on in. What's up? I've come to say good-bye. Good-bye? Yes. Davis had word from the underground. They have not been able to raise enough men. They're dropping me in tonight. How are you going to get more men? There is a unit operating in the mountains... just north of the fjord. I might be able to bring them down. If you can get by the German lines. Yes. Hello. This is Grant. Get me Operations. Hold on. I'll fly you in. They've already assigned a Mitchell. The hell with the Mitchell. I'll fly the drop. Hello, Jerry? Get my ship on the line. I'm making a drop tonight. Right. You should not take unnecessary risks. Look who's talking. I would like to see Hilde before I go. All right. We'll pick her up after I talk to Davis. We'd planned on going to the party tonight. The one for Bissel and Mary. They're getting married, aren't they? It's funny. Two die, two get married. Kind of evens things up. I thought you were against marriage. I'm also against death... but it happens anyway. I'd feel better if I could fly him myself, sir. I've ordered a Mitchell to fly him in... and make an arms drop at the same time. Could I fly the Mitchell? You're grounded until M-Day. Grounded? When did that happen? I've just made the decision. Scott can lead the remainder of the practice flights. What kind of a decision is that? You're too important to risk. Yes, sir. Is it all right if I drive him to the airplane... or is that too great a risk? We'll take a chance on it. Thank you, sir. When the war is over, we can take Roy sailing on our lake. Will you come, Roy? Sure, I'll come. And we can go fishing like before. You like to fish? Yeah, I like to fish. Good. That will be something to look forward to, huh? Hilde? Take good care of her, Roy. Good luck when you hit that ground. And to you in the air. All right. Are you angry with me? No. Why should I be angry? You don't seem to be friendly. Hell, I'm friendly. I got a lot on my mind. Now you've got me besides. Is that what you were thinking of? No. I promise I won't be a bother... but one favor I have to ask you. Let me know if there is some news about Erik. Sure. Give me your address and I'll let you know. I'm staying here until I know he's safe. No. I don't think that's a good idea. Why not? There are a lot of hungry characters around here. I think you do not understand. Erik is all that's left for me in the world... and now he's gone. Yeah, I understand. I'm sorry. Pardon me! Happy days, old boy. And nights. Rosie! Rosie! I'm coming! Come on! All the bubbly will be gone! How about these? Is that all you could get? There is a war on, you know. You could have fooled me. I'll get some more tin cans. Sounds like quite a party. You want to join them? No. I'm not in a party mood. I'll just go up to my room. All right. You don't have to see me in. I promised Erik I'd take care of you. I know what it is. You don't want to throw me to those hungry characters. That's right. Here comes the bride! Skipper! Care to kiss the bride? You bet. Just a minute! That's enough! Good luck, Bissel. I brought my luck with me. Come on, guys! Don't worry. It's not contagious. You sure? Yes, I'm sure. Good night, and thank you. Good night. Hilde? Yes? I've been grounded. Grounded? I won't be flying for a couple of days... and I was wondering... if tomorrow you were free, maybe... If you're inviting me, the answer is yes. Good night. Good night. Erik! It's good to have you back. Are you all right? - I'm fine. - Down! They haven't patrolled here before. It happened three days ago. They're all over the place. Twenty hostages were shot yesterday... for a bridge Goth blew up. You had orders. No attacks. His sister was raped. We must bury the chute. With all the German patrols... it would be better to wait till dark. We can't. The weapons must get through to the other units. Easy. Slow down at the barricade. Go! Over the bridge! I'll cover you! Go on! Over the bridge! What did you do before the war, Roy? I was a barnstormer. Barnstormer? Aerial circuses, aerobatics, things like that. Now you fly in the war. Do you hate the Germans? I never met any. The only ones I've ever seen have been through a gun sight. Not the best way to get acquainted. Why did you enter the war so early? I had to do something. The air circus folded, so I joined the Eagle Squadron. It was different with me. Where I grew up, everything was very safe. I got one. Bring him in before he gets away! No, he might throw the hook. The idea is to give him a little bit of play. It's a sardine! It's a Norwegian sardine. How'd he get over here? All right, little sardine, back to your fjord. Now, you want to take that over there? Straighten the line out? That's it. Get it straight now. You're very good. I used to do it for the fishermen. Sometimes they took me out on the boat with them. Don, you're up late. Roy... they've captured Erik. The Gestapo's got him... and they've had him since 8:00 this morning. You know what that means. They'll work on him... and they'll break him down and make him talk. This whole operation's in danger unless we can stop it. How? We know the building they've got him in... Gestapo headquarters in Bergen. This building must be bombed. We believe that a single Mosquito... might get through tonight and stop him. You want a killer, right? We need a man to do a job. You want a killer. Listen, Roy... do you remember Charlie, that collie I had? Remember how we nursed him when he was run over? But it was no good. He was in pain, so I had to shoot him. I don't care about your canine love stories. We're talking about a man's life. We are talking about many men's lives! I'm grounded, remember? That order can be rescinded in the circumstances. What circumstances? If you should volunteer. Is there a choice? Yes. It's a hell of choice. Who'll be my navigator? Bissel's volunteered. Tell him to get my plane ready. I'll be out in half an hour. We'll be waiting for you. Get me The Black Swan. How are you feeling, Lieutenant? Very sociable. Listen to me, Lieutenant. I'm going to ask you some questions. You will have to answer them sooner or later. You will save yourself much pain by answering now. What were you doing in England, and whom did you see? I was not in England. Come, Lieutenant... those canisters and weapons we found. I know nothing about them. You are insulting our intelligence. We will try something nearer home. What is the location of your underground headquarters? I have nothing to say. Surely you would not deny you are a member? I have nothing to say. I'm afraid we shall have to persuade you. Take off his clothes. Advise Intelligence one aircraft dispatched... en route to pre-designated Norwegian target. Yes. I can be reached here at Sutton Craddock Operations. We'll wait. He should be crossing the coast now. If Bergman talks... He won't talk. We'll know soon enough. Go on, Lieutenant. What else? Well, Lieutenant? There's the building. Blue Leader to Control. Blue Leader... Control. Wheels down but one light's showing. I don't think it's locked. All crash crews. All crash crews stand by for emergency landing. Hang on, Bissel, this might be a little rough. Oh, my God. Bissel! Hold it, son! Get him out of here! You're quite sure it was Gestapo headquarters? Yes, sir. Then we can assume that Bergman is dead. Yes, sir. Grant, it may seem ironic to you... but I'm going to recommend you for an award... for what you did today. You may have saved the whole operation. Shall I break the news to Bergman's sister, Roy? I shan't mention your part, of course. No, I'll tell her. Gentleman, I can't take a chance... on anything else going wrong. I'm moving up the operation. Take off 0330 hours tomorrow morning. But, sir, what about the bombs? They'll be here tonight. Adams, get in touch with the Linge. Tell them to plan their attack for tomorrow. Yes, sir. At what time? Daybreak. Grant, you'd better get that wound seen to. Sir? How's a man going to be without a face and blind? Awful, isn't it, sir? I killed him, Hilde. He was in the building. And I knew it. You knew they were torturing him. You stopped it. Erik cannot thank you, Roy. So I thank you for him. Good-bye, Hilde. Good-bye? Another mission? I will wait for you. I'm glad. Please come back. Please do come back. We've got a date. The bombs you'll be using are earthquake bombs... and that is literally their purpose... to cause an earthquake... which will bring down... the overhanging section and bury that factory... the Germans have built under that cliff. Gentlemen, you may return to your seats. Squadron Leader Adams will continue with the briefing. This is the flight plan from Sutton Craddock. By following this dogleg, the chances of losing... the surprise element over the sea are reduced. If you are detected... this route will lead the enemy to believe... that you're on a coastal shipping strike. Wing Commander Grant, anything to add? I would just like to remind the men... we will drop the bombs within 50 yards of each other... at ten-second intervals. The geologists calculate that 12 bombs of this size... exploding in this pattern, will break loose the overhang. Skipper, excuse me, I'd like to ask a question. Go ahead. Isn't it likely that each plane could be blown apart... by the explosion of the bomb in front of it? Not if our calculations are correct. I hope you've got a good calculator. With all those gun emplacements... the flak's going to be murderous, isn't it? The Norwegian underground will attack at exactly 0630. Which means you should be entering the fjord... not earlier than 0655 and not later than 0705. Squadron Leader Adams. Time check your watches. It's coming up 2:47 in... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, check. Your call sign is Everest. The code for the successful completion... of the operation is Vesuvius. Sounds like that mountain... could turn into a bloody big volcano. Yes, and we hope the Germans will be under it. Any further questions? Yes, sir, I've got a question. Just a bit of curiosity, really... but what does that factory make? You'll be told when you get back. This much I can tell you, though. No squadron has ever been sent out... on a more critically important operation. That's all, gentleman. Except... good luck. Thank you, sir. Well, Roy... What's that? I've got Davis' permission and Medical's to come along. Without a command, of course. You're a little late, aren't you? What do you mean? You haven't been on any practice missions. We take off in half an hour. I've studied every detail of this strike. I know I can follow you in. Why do you want to risk your neck? I'm damned if I know, Roy. OK, Don. You can take Jones' place. You'll lead Red Section. Thanks. How do you feel now? Scared. And you? Scared. Johansen! Johansen! They have moved up M-Day. They want us to attack at 0630 hours. It is time to send "Matterhorn." We are starting the attack. Ambush! Ambush! Landfall nine minutes, Skipper. Dead on 0703. Right. ETA 0703, sir. 633 Operation Control. It's for you, sir. Davis here. Yes. What? I see. Thank you. Intelligence reports Germans ambushed the Linge... trailed some of the survivors to their hideout... destroyed everything. Arms, communications, men... the lot. - When's their landfall? - 0703. Send this message to Wing Commander Grant. "Linge destroyed." "Enemy anti-aircraft intact. "You have permission to abort." - Hoppy? - Abort. Blue Leader to all sections. Enemy anti-aircraft intact. Keep your eyes open. We're going in. Skipper, I'm gonna recommend you for a medal... and when it comes, I'll pin it right on your... - What? - On your tail. There's Norway. And you can have it. We got bandits up ahead, boys. Bandits up above. Keep down low. - You all right? - Yeah. Throw an extinguisher, Reynolds. Reynolds! Skipper. Blue Leader to White Section. I'm coming back in to cover your run. Roger, Blue Leader! Hit it! Four hits. Three aircraft lost. Two crews ditched in fjord. You've got bandits at seven o'clock, Clark. Dive, Clark! Green Section, you're way behind. Come on, Green Section. Bomb release! Bomb release! Put it out! Put the bloody thing out! Break for the fjord. Gillibrand, break for the fjord. - How many hits? - Six. Send it. - Won't that mountain ever go? - Send it! Six... direct... hits. Nine... aircraft... lost. One... bomb... left. I'm coming in on target now with an engine dead. Now! Skipper! It's going! It's going! Vesuvius, sir. Vesuvius! All right, Scott, let's get the hell out of here. You lead, and I'll cover. Roger, Skipper. Skipper. Skipper! You OK? Yes, Skipper. Can you move? Where does it hurt? All over. I can't reach them, sir. Keep trying! Yes. He's coming on the line now, sir. Davis, here, sir. Vesuvius, sir. Complete success. Thank you, sir. At least the rockets won't happen. Of course they'll happen. But they won't start tomorrow or this month or on D-Day... and that's important. what's it all add up to? All their sacrifice? A successful operation. But they're probably all dead... all 633 Squadron. You can't kill a squadron.
