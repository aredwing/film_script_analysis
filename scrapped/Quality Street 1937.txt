I PASSED HIM ON THE STREET YESTERDAY. HE CLOSED ONE OF HIS EYES AT ME, THEN QUICKLY OPENED I AGAIN. I KNEW WHAT HE MEANT. RESUME, FANNIE, DEAR. "SUDDENLY, OUT OF THE DARKNESS, THERE EMERGED A MAN"... "THE UNHAPPY CAPTAIN OF A STANDING LOST IN REVELING, "WHEN, WITHOUT PAUSING TO ADVERTISE HER MISINTENTIONS, "HE TOOK BOTH HER HANDS IN HIS. "SLOWLY HE GATHERED HER IN HIS ARMS AND RAINED HOT, BURNING KISSES-" SISTER! MISS SUSAN, I AM INDEED SURPRISED YOU SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT SUCH AN AMAZING INDELICATE TALE FROM THE LIBRARY. I DEEPLY REGRET, MISS WILLOUGHBY. OH, FANNIE... IF YOU PLEASE. I THANK YOU. MISS SUSAN IS LOOKING AT THE END. FORGIVE MY PARTIALITY FOR ROMANCE. IT IS, I FEAR, THE MARK OF AN OLD MAID. OH, SUSAN, THAT WORD. IT'S WHAT I AM, MARY. AND YOU, TOO, MY DEAR. I'M HAPPY PHOEBE WILL NOT BE AN OLD MAID. OH, PHOEBE. I BEG YOUR PARDON. WITH YOUR PERMISSION, MISS SUSAN, I SHALL PUT ON MY WRAPS.

PATTY, THERE IS A MAN IN THE HOUSE. TO THE DOOR WITH HIM. AND IF HE REFUSES? OH, DEAR. IF HE REFUSES, SEND HIM HERE TO ME. LIONHEARTED PHOEBE. SERGEANT, I'M WISHFUL TO SCOLD YOU, BUT WOULD YOU BE SO OBLIGING AS TO STAND ON THAT PAPER WHILE I DO IT? WITH ALL THE PLEASURE IN LIFE. A SHUDDER GOES THROUGH ME WHEN I SEE YOU IN THE STREETS ENTICING THOSE POOR YOUNG MEN. I TELL THEM WHAT THEY'RE WISHFUL TO HEAR, MUM. THERE HAVE BEEN 5 OF THEM ALL THIS WEEK LISTENING TO ME AND SHOWING ME THEIR HEELS, BUT BY A GRAND STROKE OF LUCK, I HAVE THEM AT LAST. LUCK? THE LUCKIEST, MUM, FOR A GENTLEMAN OF THIS TOWN HAS ENLISTED. THAT GAVE THEM THE PUSH FORWARD. A GENTLEMAN OF THIS TOWN IS ENLISTED? YES. SERGEANT, WHO? THAT'D BE A SECRET, MUM. BE SO OBLIGING. THAT I CANNOT DO. OH, BUT YOU MUST. YOU MUST. UM, SERGEANT, I'VE NO BEEN SAYING THE THINGS I MEANT TO SAY TO YOU. WOULD YOU PLEASE EXCUSE MY TURNING YOU OUT OF THIS HOUSE SOMEWHAT VIOLENTLY? OH, BLESS YOUR HEART, MUM, I'M USED TO IT. I WON'T REALLY HURT YOU. THANK YOU KINDLY. BE GONE, SIR! I FORGET, SIR, I SHALL PERMIT NO FOLLOWERS IN MY HOUSE. SHOULD I DISCOVER YOU IN MY KITCHEN AGAIN, I SHALL PITCH YOU OU NECK AND CLASP! BE GONE! GO. HOW SWEET. PHOEBE, WE COULD NO BUT ADMIRE YOU. YES-I MEAN, COULDN'T YOU? COME, HENRIETTA. CONGRATULATIONS, PHOEBE. PHOEBE, DEAR, I WISH YOU VERY HAPPY. MISS PHOEBE, I GIVE YOU JOY. SUSAN, YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO THEM ABOUT MR. B. I COULDN'T HELP IT. OH, SUSAN! PHOEBE, WHAT IS IT? YOU HAVE TO TELL ME. WELL, AS YOU KNOW, I WAS SITTING WITH AN UNHAPPY WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND WAS KILLED IN THE WAR, AND AS I CAME OU OF THE COTTAGE, HE WAS PASSING. AND... HE OFFERED ME HIS ESCORT. AT FIRST HE WAS VERY SILEN AS HE HAS OFTEN BEEN OF LATE. WE KNOW WHY. PLEASE NOT TO SAY THAT I KNOW WHY. SUDDENLY, HE STOPPED AND SWUNG HIS CANE. YOU KNOW HOW GALLANTLY HE SWINGS HIS CANE? YES INDEED. HE SAID, "I HAVE SOMETHING "I'M WISHFUL TO TELL YOU, MISS PHOEBE. PERHAPS YOU CAN GUESS WHAT IT IS." TO SAY I COULD GUESS IS TO WOULD HAVE BEEN UNLADYLIKE. I SAID, "PLEASE NOT TO TELL ME IN THE PUBLIC THOROUGHFARE," TO WHICH HE INSTANTLY REPLIED, "THEN I SHALL CALL AND TELL YOU THIS AFTERNOON." PHOEBE. SUSAN, TO THINK THA IT HAS ALL HAPPENED IN A SINGLE YEAR. SUCH A GENTILE COMPETENCY AS HE CAN OFFER. A PHYSICIAN. AND SO DASHING. AND, SUSAN, HOW AMUSING HE IS. YES, ISN'T HE? THE DAY HE FIRS DRANK TEA IN THIS HOUSE. HE SMOKED HIS PIPE IN THIS ROOM. SMOKING IS INDEED A DREADFUL HABIT. BUT THERE'S - THERE'S SOMETHING SO DASHING ABOUT IT. PHOEBE, I HAVE A WEDDING GIFT FOR YOU. SUSAN, NOT YET. IT'S BEEN READY FOR A LONG TIME. I MEANT IT FOR MYSELF. IT WAS YEARS AGO. I HAD HOPED THAT HE- HIS NAME WAS WILLIAM. BUT I'M AFRAID I WAS TOO UNATTRACTIVE, MY LOVE. SWEETEST, DEAREST. HE WAS A NAVAL OFFICER. BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED- A MISS CECILY PEMBELTON. AND THEY'RE QUITE BIG BOYS NOW. SUSAN, WHAT IS IT? A WEDDING GOWN, MY DEAR. EVEN PLAYING WITH IT... WE CAN'T HELP IT, PHOEBE. WHEN WE ARE YOUNG, WE HAVE ROMANTIC IDEAS JUST AS IF WE WERE PRETTY. LONG BEFORE IT WAS FINISHED, I KNEW HE WOULD NOT OFFER... BUT I FINISHED IT. AND THEN I PUT IT AWAY. BUT OF LATE, I'VE TAKEN IT OUT, ALTERED IT. SUSAN, I COULDN'T WEAR IT. OH, HOW SWEET. HOW BEAUTIFUL. YOU WILL WEAR IT, MY LOVE, WON'T YOU? THE ROAST BEEF OF OLD ENGLAND AND ALL THE OLD IT IS HE. THAT KNOCK. SO DASHING. SO IMPERIOUS. SUSAN, I THINK HE KISSED ME ONCE. YOU THINK? I KNOW HE DID. THAT EVENING A WEEK AGO WHEN HE WAS SQUIRING ME HOME FROM THE CONCERT. IT WAS RAINING, AND MY FACE WAS WET. HE SAID THAT WAS WHY HE DID IT. BECAUSE YOUR FACE WAS WET? DOESN'T SEEM A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE NOW. OH, PHOEBE, BEFORE HE OFFERED. I FEAR ME IT WAS MOST UNLADYLIKE. DR. BROWN! MISS SUSAN. HOW DO YOU DO, MA'AM? MISS PHOEBE, THOUGH WE MET TODAY ALREADY, I INSIST ON SHAKING HANDS WITH YOU AGAIN. ALWAYS SO DASHING. WILL YOU TAKE TEA, SIR? THANK YOU. HOW MANY LUMPS, SIR, 2? 5, IF I MAY. UM... MAY I SIT ON THIS CHAIR, MISS PHOEBE? I KNOW MISS SUSAN LIKES ME TO BREAK HER CHAIRS. INDEED I DO NOT, SIR. PHOEBE, HOW STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD THINK SO. HOW YOU SEE THROUGH ME, MISS PHOEBE. SO YOU THINK ME DASHING, MISS SUSAN? AM I DASHING, MISS PHOEBE? A LITTLE, I THINK. I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU TODAY THAT I THINK IS RATHER DASHING. BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING, MA'AM, BEFORE YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? AYE. INDEED, SIR. TO BE SURE. I KNOW WHAT IT IS, MR. BROWN. SUSAN. I MEAN, I DO NOT KNOW. I MEAN... I CAN GUESS. OH, WHY DON'T YOU STROLL IN THE GARDEN? SHALL WE? YES, INDEED. YOU KNOW, MISS PHOEBE... YES, MR. BROWN-BROWN? TO ME YOU'LL ALWAYS BE LIKE THIS QUIE OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN FULL OF THE FLOWERS I LOVE BES BECAUSE I'VE KNOWN THEM LONGEST: THE DAISY THAT STANDS FOR INNOCENCE, THE HYACINTH FOR CONSTANCY, THE MODEST VIOLET... AND THE ROSE. IT'S A PRETTY SPEECH, SIR. AND FROM MY HEART... MISS SUSAN'S ANTICS JUST NOW ARE MOST UNEXPECTED. HOW COULD SHE KNOW MY SECRET? WELL... YOU MEAN YOU'D FORESEEN IT, TOO? SIR, YOU MUSTN' ASK THAT. IN ANY CASE, I THINK IT WAS YOU WHO FIRST PUT I IN MY MIND. OH, I HOPE NOT. YOUR EYES FLASHED EVERY TIME THE WAR WAS MENTIONED. MR. BROWN... WHAT IS IT THA YOU HAVE TO TELL US? THAT I'VE ENLISTED, MISS PHOEBE. DID YOU SURMISE IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE? GOING TO THE WAR, MR. BROWN? IS IT A JEST? IT WOULD BE A SORRY JEST, MA'AM. I THOUGHT YOU KNEW. I CONCLUDED THE RECRUITING SERGEANT HAD TALKED. RECRUITING SERGEANT? I SEE. IN THESE STIRRING TIMES, A MAN CAN'T STAY AT HOME. YESTERDAY I FOUND THERE WERE 5 WAVERERS. I ASKED THEM WOULD THEY JOINED THE COLORS IF I DID, AND THEY ASSENTED. MISS PHOEBE, IT'S NOT ONE MAN I GIVE TO THE KING, BUT 6. I THINK YOU'VE DONE BRAVELY, MR. BROWN. WE LEAVE IMMEDIATELY FOR THE PETERBOROUGH BARRACKS. SO THIS IS GOOD-BYE. I SHALL PRAY THAT YOU MAY BE PRESERVED IN BATTLE, MR. BROWN. WILL YOU AND MISS SUSAN WRITE TO ME IF AN OCCASION OFFERS? IF YOU WISH IT. WITH ALL THE STIRRING NEWS OF DEAR QUALITY STREET. IT SEEMS STIRRING TO US. IT MUST HAVE BEEN MERELY LAUGHABLE TO YOU. I'VE MADE FRIENDS HERE- 2 VERY SWEET LADIES. AND DID I AMUSE YOU ALSO? ENORMOUSLY. THOSE OTHER LADIES WERE ALWAYS SCOLDING, AND YOUR YOUTHFULNESS SHOCKED THEM. I BELIEVE THEY THOUGH YOU DASHING. I SOMETIMES FEEL THAT I WAS PERHAPS TOO DASHING. TELL ME, IS IT- SUSAN. YOU SEEM SO CALM, PHOEBE. SUSAN, HE IS A GENTLEMAN WHO HAS ENLISTED, AND HE CAME TO TELL US THAT AND SAY GOOD-BYE. GOING AWAY? YES, DEAR. WELL, AM I NO THE IDEAL RECRUIT, MA'AM? A MAN WITHOUT A WIFE, A MOTHER, OR A SWEETHEART. NO SWEETHEART? HAVE YOU ONE FOR ME, MISS SUSAN? SUSAN, WE SHALL HAVE TO TELL HIM NOW. YOU WILL LAUGH, SIR, AND SAY THAT IT IS JUS LIKE QUALITY STREET. WELL, INDEED, SINCE I MET YOU TODAY AND YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU HAD SOMETHING TO COMMUNICATE, WE'VE BEEN PUZZLING AS TO WHAT IT COULD BE, AND WE CONCLUDED THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE... MARRIED. OH, WAS THAT IT? SO LIKE WOMEN, YOU KNOW. WE THOUGHT PERHAPS WE KNEW HER. WE WERE EVEN DISCUSSING WHA WE SHOULD WEAR AT THE WEDDING. WELL, I WONDER WHO'D HAVE ME, MISS SUSAN. I MUST LEAVE NOW. GOD BLESS YOU BOTH. YOU ARE GOING? NO MORE MUD ON YOUR CARPETS, MISS SUSAN. NO MORE BREAKING YOUR CHAIRS. A GOOD RIDDANCE. MISS PHOEBE, A LAST LOOK AT THE GARDEN. GOOD-BYE. A MISUNDERSTANDING. JUST A MISTAKE. WE CAN LET IT DOWN. OTHER GENTLEMEN HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED BY YOU, PHOEBE. I DIDN'T WANT THEM. THEY WILL COME AGAIN. AND OTHERS. NO. NEVER SPEAK OF THA TO ME ANYMORE. I LET HIM KISS ME. YOU COULD NOT PREVENT HIM. YES, I COULD. I KNOW I COULD NOW. I WANTED HIM TO DO IT. OH, NEVER SPEAK TO ME OF OTHERS AFTER THAT. PERHAPS HE SAW I WANTED HIM TO DO I AND DID IT TO PLEASE ME. BUT I MEANT IT. INDEED I DID, AND I GAVE IT TO HIM WILL ALL MY LOVE. SISTER, I COULD BEAR ALL THE REST... BUT I'VE BEEN UNLADYLIKE. LEFT! LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT! LEFT! LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT! DON'T BREAK YOUR MOTHER'S HEART, AND YOU WON'T BREAK MINE! PHOEBE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT WILL DO. YOU MAY BE SEATED. PHOEBE, HOW MUCH ARE 14 AND 17? THANK YOU. HOW CLEVER YOU ARE. MASTER DOUGLAS, RISE. NOT DOUGLAS MAJOR, DOUGLAS MINOR. HOW MUCH ARE 14 AND 17? COME ON! COME ON! PERHAPS HE REMAINS IN LONDON. COME, CHILDREN. CHILDREN. CHILDREN, YOU WILL ALL RETURN TO YOUR DESKS, IF YOU PLEASE. GO ON. GO. PHOEBE, IF A HERRING AND A HALF COSTS 3 HALFPENCE, HOW MANY FOR 11 PENCE? WILLIAM SMITH SAYS IT'S 15, AND HE'S SUCH A BIG BOY. DO YOU THINK I OUGHT TO CONTRADICT HIM? MAY I SUGGES THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ABOUT IT? ONE CAN'T BE REALLY SURE, PHOEBE. IT IS 11. I ONCE WORKED IT OU WITH REAL HERRINGS. SUSAN, WE MUSTN'T LET THE BIG BOYS KNOW THAT WE'RE AFRAID OF THEM. TO AWE THEM, STAMP WITH THE FOOT, SPEAK IN A FEROCIOUS VOICE, AND LOOK THEM UNFLINCHINGLY IN THE FACE. WILLIAM SMITH, PLEASE RISE. PHOEBE, WILLIAM SMITH PUT HIS TONGUE OUT AT ME. CHILDREN, YOU ARE DISMISSED. PHOEBE! HE'S MUCH TOO BIG. LET IT PASS. AND BE A STUMBLING BLOCK IN THE WAY OF TRUE EDUCATION? SUSAN, STAND ASIDE. PATTY. DR. BROWN. IT'S DR. BROWN. CAPTAIN BROWN. REPORTS HIMSELF AT HOME AGAIN. YOU CALL THIS HOME? MISS SUSAN, I'M DELIGHTED TO FIND SO LITTLE CHANGE IN YOU. AND MISS PHOEBE, WHERE'S MISS PHOEBE OF THE RINGLETS? PHOEBE OF THE RINGLETS? OH, CAPTAIN BROWN, YOU DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE HER. SHE'S NOT HERE? THAT SPOILS MY HOMECOMING. PHOEBE, DID YOU SEE WHO IT IS? SUSAN, I'VE LOS ALL MY LOOKS. A YOUNG REPROBATE, MA'AM, BUT I DEPOSITED HIM ON THE STREET. WHY, MISS PHOEBE. IT'S YOU. YES. I'VE, UM, CHANGED VERY MUCH. I HAVE NOT WORN WELL, CAPTAIN BROWN. WE'RE BOTH OLDER, MISS PHOEBE. YES. I'M DISMISSING THE CHILDREN. GENTLEMEN, SALUTE, LADIES, CURTSY TO THE BRAVE CAPTAIN BROWN. A TERRIBLE ORDEAL, MA'AM. MISS PHOEBE, WHY DIDN' YOU SAY IN YOUR LETTERS YOU HAD SUCH A YOUNG BLACKGUARD AS THAT TO TERRIFY YOU? WELL, HE IS THE ONLY ONE. MOST OF THEM ARE DEAR CHILDREN AND THIS IS THE LAST DAY OF THE TERM. THAT'S FORTUNATE. YOU LOOK SO - SO TIRED. OH, I HAVE A HEADACHE TODAY. I WAS IN HOPES YOU AND MISS SUSAN WOULD BE GOING TO THE BALL. I BROUGHT CARDS FOR YOU TO MAKE SURE. BUT- NOW YOU SAY MY DANCING DAYS ARE DONE? OH, NO. YOU WILL FIND MANY CHARMING PARTNERS. I WISH YOU A HAPPY TIME AT THE BALL. WELL, I'LL SEE YOU ALL AGAIN SOON. THE-THE DASHING MR. BROWN DROPPED IN AS BEFORE TO HAVE TEA WITH MISS SUSAN AND MISS PHOEBE. MISS PHOEBE. PHOEBE OF THE RINGLETS? SHE- SHE- SHE DOESN'T- WHAT A SHAME IT IS, MISS SUSAN. YES, IT IS A SHAME. A BRAVE CAPTAIN BROWN. GOOD AFTERNOON, MISS SUSAN. TELL ME, WAS WATERLOO FUN? FUN, MA'AM? NOT FOR NAPOLEON. LA, SIR. HOW WITTY YOU ARE. LA, CAPTAIN BROWN, HOW BRAVE YOU ARE. HE'LL BE DANCING WITH CHARLOTTE PERRET. MISS CHARLOTTE, YOU ARE SELFISH AND SILLY, BUT YOU ARE SWEET 18. SUSAN, I HATE HIM. OH, SUSAN, I COULD HATE HIM IF- MY DEAR. HE THOUGHT I WAS OLD BECAUSE I'M WEARY. AND HOW'S MISS PHOEBE? ALL YOUR CHARM IS GONE IF YOU HAVE THE HEADACHE AND YOUR EYES ARE TIRED. BUT HE SHOULDN' HAVE FORGOTTEN. I'M ONLY 30. SUSAN, WHY DOES 30 SEEM SO MUCH MORE THAN 29? HE WOULD NOT DANCE WITH HER. CHARLOTTE PERRE IS A SILLY GOOSE. 'TIS WHAT GENTLEMEN PREFER. IF THERE WERE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF GEESE TO GO AROUND, SUSAN, NO WOMAN OF SENSE WOULD EVER GET A HUSBAND. IF TO BE LADY-LIKE- I'M TIRED OF BEING LADY-LIKE. I WANT TO BE BRIGHT AND THOUGHTLESS AND THE MERRY. I WANT TO BE PETTED AND ADMIRED. ARE THESE 4 WALLS THE WORLD, SUSAN, OR IS THERE ANYTHING BEYOND THEM? 10 YEARS AGO, I WEN TO BED A YOUNG GIRL, AND I AWOKE WITH THIS CAP ON MY HEAD. IT'S NOT FAIR. PHOEBE, PHOEBE, YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO PATIENT. OH, NO. NOT ALWAYS. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I'VE REBELLED AT TIMES. SUSAN, I HAVE A PICTURE OF MYSELF AS I USED TO BE. I SOMETIMES LOOK AT IT. I SOMETIMES KISS I AND SAY, "POOR GIRL, THEY'VE ALL FORGOTTEN YOU, BUT I REMEMBER." I DO NOT RECALL IT. I KEEP IT LOCKED AWAY IN MY ROOM. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT? I SHALL BRING I DOWN TO YOU. YOU STAND GAZING AT THE FOOLISH CREATURES WHO CROWD TO A BALL. I'M NOT, MUM. I'M GAZING AT MY SWEETHEART. YOUR SWEETHEART? I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD ONE. NOT EVER, AYE, MUM, AS YET. BUT AT ANY MOMENT, HE MAY TURN THE CORNER. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR HIM TO OBLIGE THESE 15 YEARS. 15 YEARS AND YOU'RE STILL HOPEFUL? THERE'S NOT A MORE HOPEFUL WOMAN IN ALL THE KINGS' DOMINIONS. YOU ARE SO MUCH OLDER THAN MISS PHOEBE. YES, MA'AM. I HAVE THE ADVANTAGE BY 10 YEARS. IT WOULD BE IDLE TO PRETEND THAT YOU ARE ESPECIALLY HANDSOME. WELL, THAT MAY BE, MUM, BUT MY FACE IS MY OWN. THE MORE I SEE IT IN THE GLASS, THE MORE IT PLEASES ME. I NEVER LOOK AT IT, BUT I SAY TO MYSELF, "WHO'S TO BE THE LUCKY MAN?" 'TIS WONDERFUL. OH, THIS WILL BE A GREA YEAR FOR FEMALES, MUM. THINK HOW MANY OF THE MEN WHO MARCH STRUTTING OFF TO THE WAR TO HAVE COME BACK LIMPING. WHO'S TO TAKE OFF THEIR WOODEN LEGS EVERY EVENING, MISS SUSAN? YOU, MUM OR ME? PATTY! OR MISS PHOEBE, MUM? THE PRETTY THING THA SHE WAS, MISS SUSAN. DO YOU REMEMBER, PATTY? AM I AS CHANGED AS HE SAYS I AM? YOU ALMOST FRIGHTEN ME. ONE DANCE FOR PHOEBE OF THE RINGLETS THEN I SHALL PUT HER AWAY IN A BOX AND NEVER LOOK AT HER AGAIN. WILL YOU CELEBRATE WATERLOO, MUM? MISS PHOEBE! NOT MISS PHOEBE, PATTY. I'M NOT MYSELF TONIGHT. I AM, LET ME SEE, I AM MY NIECE. MISS SUSAN, IT'S CAPTAIN BROWN. HE'S AT THE DOOR. PATTY, WAIT! STOP! IT'S CAPTAIN BROWN. I VENTURED TO COME BACK BECAUSE I- I BEG YOUR PARDON, MA'AM. I THOUGH IT WAS MISS SUSAN OR MISS PHOEBE. 'TIS MY MISTRESS' NIECE, SIR. SHE'S ON A VISI HERE. OH, PATTY, I OBTAINED THIS AT THE APOTHECARY FOR MISS PHOEBE'S HEADACHE. IT SHOULD BE TAKEN AT ONCE. MISS PHOEBE'S LIED DOWN, SIR. PATTY, TAKE I TO AUNT PHOEBE AT ONCE. YES, MA'AM. PERHAPS I MAY VENTURE TO INTRODUCE MYSELF, MISS, UH? MISS, UH, LIVVY, SIR. I'M CAPTAIN BROWN, MISS LIVVY. AN OLD FRIEND OF BOTH YOUR AUNTS. OH! I HEARD THEM SPEAK OF A DASHING MR. BROWN, BUT I THINK I CANNOT BE THE SAME. WHY NOT, MA'AM? I BEG YOUR PARDON. I WAS SURE YOU MUST BE RELATED. FOR A MOMENT, THE LIKENESS- LA, SIR. YOU MEAN I'M LIKE AUNT PHOEBE? EVERYONE SAYS SO, AND INDEED, THERE'S NO COMPLIMENT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A COMPLIMENT ONCE. MISS LIVVY, ARE YOU GOING TO THE BALL? ALAS, SIR, I HAVE NO CARD. I HAVE 2 CARDS FOR YOUR AUNTS. AND SINCE MISS PHOEBE HAS A HEADACHE, MISS SUSAN MUS TAKE YOU TO THE BALL. OH, DO YOU THINK, SIR, THAT SOME HANDSOME GENTLEMAN MIGHT BE PARTIAL TO ME AT THE BALL? IF THAT'S YOUR WISH. I SHOULD LOVE, SIR, TO INSPIRE FRENZY IN THE REST OF THE MALE. OH, I DARE NOT GO. I CANNOT GO. LOOK, MISS LIVVY. OH, MISS SUSAN. I VENTURED TO INTRODUCE MYSELF TO YOUR CHARMING NIECE. AUNT SUSAN, DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOUR LIVVY. YOUR LIVVY, AUNT SUSAN.

AUNT PHOEBE WANTS ME TO GO. IF I SAY SHE DOES, YOU KNOW SHE DOES. I SHALL SEE TO IT, MISS SUSAN, THAT YOUR NIECE HAS A CHARMING EVENING. HE MEANS THAT HE WILL FIND ME CHARMING PARTNERS. NO, MA'AM. I MEAN I'LL BE YOUR PARTNER. AUNT SUSAN, HE STILL DANCES. STILL, MA'AM? PRAY NOT TO SCOWL. I COULD NOT AVOID NOTICING THEM. NOTICING WHAT, MISS LIVVY? THE, UM, GRAY HAIRS, SIR. COME ON, SUSAN.

MARY, SURELY IT ISN' THE GALLANT CAPTAIN BROWN. OH, HOW DO YOU DO, MY DEAR LADIES. WELCOME BACK, SIR. WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU AGAIN, SIR. AND HAVE YOU SEEN MISS PHOEBE? I'VE HAD THE HONOR. I REGRET TO SAY THAT MISS PHOEBE IS LYING DOWN NOW WITH A HEADACHE. A HEADACHE? HMM. MORE LIKELY HEARTACHE. YOU DON'T FAVOR THE BALL TONIGHT? WE NEVER ATTEND THEM, SIR. WE SHOULD PROBABLY SPEND THE EVENING HERE WITH MISS SUSAN AT THE CARD TABLE. MISS SUSAN'S GOING TO THE BALL WITH ME. OH, I HOPE THERE'S NO IMPROPRIETY. MISS LIVVY WILL ACCOMPANY HER. MISS LIVVY? THEIR VERY CHARMING NIECE. NIECE? THEY HAD NOT TOLD US THAT THEY HAD A VISITOR. WE'RE GOING TO THE BALL. OH, I SEE. I, UH, CANNOT REMEMBER, SUSAN, THAT YOUR ESTIMABLE BROTHER HAD A DAUGHTER.

OH, AUNTIE, I SHOULD SO ENJOY DANCING WITH AN ENSIGN. HOW MUCH MORE THAN DANCING WITH A LIEUTENANT? WHY DON'T YOU TWO OLD FRIENDS PLAY A HAND OF CRIBBAGE? AND WE'LL GO OVER TO MAKE MERRY AND WHEN WE'RE THERE, WE'LL DRINK THE SHERRY WHEN TOGETHER WE'RE SO GAY ABOARD THE BOAT, ACROSS THE PRAIRIE WHEN TOGETHER WE'RE SO... BEAUTIFULLY DONE!

EXCUSE ME. YES, MR. BROWN? MISS LIVVIE, NO DOUBT THESE VARYING FLIRTATIONS AMUSE YOU. HAS IT NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU THAT THEY MAY HURT OTHERS? REALLY, SIR? WHOM?

I SPEAK IN THE INTERESTS OF THE MAN TO WHOM I HOPE TO SEE YOU BETROTHED. AND WHO IS THIS HAPPY MAN? AS TO WHO HE IS, I HAVE NO IDEA. NOR, I AM SURE, HAVE YOU. OTHERWISE YOU'D BE MORE GUARDED IN YOUR CONDUCT. BUT SOMEDAY, MISS LIVVIE, THE RIGHT MAN WILL COME. AND HOW WILL YOU EXPLAIN AWAY YOUR PRESENT BEHAVIOR? HIS FACE WOULD CHANGE AS YOU TOLD HIM OF IT. AND YOURS WOULD BE A FALSE FACE UNTIL IT WAS TOLD. I SEE. YOU WILL SEE... WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT LOVE REALLY IS. LOVE. WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF LOVE? WHY, I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT. I'M IN LOVE, MISS LIVVIE. I WISH YOU HAPPY. THE LADY WAS ONCE VERY MUCH LIKE YOU. NOT... OH, NO. YES, MISS LIVVIE, IT'S YOUR AUNT PHOEBE WHOM I LOVE. YOU REALLY MEAN PHOEBE? TIRED, UNATTRACTIVE PHOEBE? PHOEBE WHO WAS ONCE MORE FASCINATING THAN YOU, MA'AM. OH, YOU BEWITCHED ME, YOU WHO SO RESEMBLED HER AS SHE WAS. BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR AN HOUR. HOW LIKE I THOUGHT AT FIRST, BUT SOON IT WAS HOW UNLIKE. I REMEMBER I ONCE COMPARED HER TO A GARDEN. I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT OF THAT. OH, MISS LIVVIE, DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY HOPE FOR ME? THERE WAS A MAN WHO MISS PHOEBE LOVED... BUT THAT WAS LONG AGO. HE DIDN'T LOVE HER. NOW, THERE WAS A FOOL. IT WAS YOU. YOU KISSED HER ONCE. IT WAS RAINING, AND HER FACE WAS WET. YOU SAID YOU DID I BECAUSE HER FACE WAS WET. I HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN. NOW I'M LAUGHING AT BOTH OF YOU. PHOEBE-THAT OLD THING. MISS LIVVIE... HA HA. I HATE HER AND DESPISE HER. IF YOU KNEW WHAT SHE IS- I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE. THAT GARDEN- SILENCE! YOUR GARDEN HAS BEEN DESTROYED, SIR. THE WEEDS HAVE ENTERED IT, AND ALL THE FLOWERS ARE CHOKED. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I CANNOT TELL YOU. IT IS TOO HORRIBLE. YOU'RE TOO HORRIBLE. ISN'T THAT IT? YES, THAT'S IT. WHAT IS TOO HORRIBLE? MA'AM, I'LL LEAVE THE TELLING OF IT TO HER IF SHE DARE. BUT I DEVOUTLY HOPE THOSE ARE THE LAST WORDS I SHALL EVER ADDRESS TO THIS LADY. MY LOVE, MY DEAR, WHAT TERRIBLE THING HAS HE SAID TO YOU? NOT-NOT TERRIBLE... GLORIOUS! SUSAN, 'TIS PHOEBE HE LOVES, NOT LIVVIE. HE LOVES ME-PHOEBE! OHH, SUSAN, HE LOVES ME. OH, LOVELY RAMBLIN' ROSES THE GARDEN WALL ATOP YOUR FRAGRANCE RARE CANNOT COMPARE TO A FRYING... MUTTON CHOP AHH! FOR YOU, VIDEL. IT MAY INVOLVE A DETOUR, BUT IT'S STILL THE BEST ROUTE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE WAY TO A MAN'S HEAR IS THROUGH HIS STOMACH. AND, TO MAKE A PERSONAL OBSERVATION OF MY OWN, THE WAY TO A MAN'S STOMACH IS THROUGH- NOT FOR YOU. THAT'S FOR MISS SUSAN AND MISS PHOEBE. YEAH, BUT YOU TOLD ME THERE AIN'T NO MISS PHOEBE. ONCE AND FOR ALL AND FOR THE LAST TIME, THERE AIN' NO MISS LIVVIE. GOOD MORNING, PHOEBE, MY LOVE. YOU DID NOT SLEEP? NOT A WINK. IF YOU HAVE SUCH REMORSE, YOU WILL WEEP YOURSELF TO DEATH. AFTER WHAT HE SAID TO ME LAST NIGHT... WHAT ELSE CAN I DO? YOU MUST GET RID OF LIVVIE. THAT IS CERTAIN. WHEN OUR FRIENDS CALL THIS AFTERNOON, I'LL SAY THA SHE'S RETURNED HOME. YES. GOOD MORNING, SUSAN. YOU WILL PARDON MY INTRUSION SO EARLY IN THE DAY, BUT, UH, BEING AWARE OF MISS LIVVIE'S EXTREME POPULARITY, I THOUGHT TO CALL ON HER BEFORE SHE WENT OUT. OH. POOR LIVVIE IS ILL. YES. ILL? HOW SUDDEN. QUITE. SHE WAS AWAKE ALL NIGHT... TREMBLINGS, FLUTTERINGS, SPASMS. INDEED? THE EXCITEMENT, UH, THE BALL. HMM. MAY I GO IN AND SEE HER? I'M AFRAID NOT. YOU KNOW, LIVVIE MUST BE ALMOST ASLEEP AT LAST. THAT'S FOR MISS LIVVIE. LIE STILL, LIVVIE, MY LOVE. LIE STILL. BREAKFAST. MISS LIVVIE'S BREAKFAST. YOURS IS GETTING COLD, MA'AM. GOOD MORNING, LADIES. I SHALL BE AT HOME ALL DAY. DO LET ME KNOW WHEN MISS LIVVIE IS IMPROVED ENOUGH TO RECEIVE ME. WHAT'S TO BE DONE? SHE WILL NEVER LE LIVVIE ESCAPE. PHOEBE, I FEEL AS IF MISS LIVVIE REALLY EXISTED. WE SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO ESTEEM OURSELVES AGAIN. IF HE PROPOSES, WHY NOT MARRY HIM? IF WE CAN MAKE HIM THINK THAT SHE'S GONE HOME, HE NEED NEVER KNOW. SUSAN... YOU PAIN ME. SHE WHO MARRIES WITHOUT TELLING ALL, HERS MUST EVER BE A FALSE FACE. THEY WERE HIS OWN WORDS. PATTY, 'TIS CAPTAIN BROWN. TELL HIM I'VE GONE OUT. GOOD MORNING, PATTY. IS MISS PHOEBE IN? NO, SIR. SHE'S GONE OUT. INTO THE GARDEN. AHA. MISS PHOEBE? WHAT IS IT, SIR? SURELY YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF ME? NO. NO. WHY SHOULD I BE? NO REASON THAT I KNOW. MISS PHOEBE, YOU TOLD MISS LIVVIE THAT YOU LOVED ME ONCE. YOU KEPT IT CAREFULLY HIDDEN FROM ME. A WOMAN MUST NEVER TELL, SIR. YOU WEN TO THE GREAT BATTLES. I WAS LEFT TO FIGH IN A LITTLE ONE. WOMEN HAVE A FLAG TO FLY AS WELL AS MEN, MR. BROWN. AND... OLD MAIDS HAVE A FLAG AS WELL AS WOMEN. I... TRIED TO KEEP MINE FLYING. I DARE NOT ASK YOU TO LOVE, BUT I DO ASK YOU TO PU YOURSELF IN MY KEEPING. LET ME TAKE CARE OF YOU. IT CANNOT BE. IF NOT FOR YOUR SAKE, DO IT FOR MINE. THEY SAY A LADY CAN NEVER QUITE FORGE THE MAN WHO'S USED HER ILL. DO IT FOR ME BECAUSE I USED YOU ILL. PLEASE TO SAY NO MORE. GOOD MORNING, PATTY. PATTY. WELL, WHERE'S MISS MARY? SHE HAS NOT BEEN TO SEE US FOR 5 MINUTES. HOW DO YOU DO, SIR? AND HOW DO YOU FIND MISS LIVVIE TODAY, SIR? I HAVEN'T SEEN HER, MA'AM. INDEED? WHY SURELY, PHOEBE, WHEN SHE'S ILL, THERE'S DOUBLE REASON FOR- ILL? I HADN'T HEARD. LADIES, HAVE PITY ON A DULL MALE AND EXPLAIN. I UNDERSTAND, SIR, THAT THERE IS A BELIEF THAT I KEEP MISS LIVVIE IN CONFINEMEN BECAUSE OF YOUR PASSION FOR HER. MY PASSION FOR MISS LIVVIE? WHY, I CAN'T ABIDE HER OR SHE ME. FURTHERMORE, I'M PROUD TO TELL YOU THAT THIS IS THE LADY I LOVE. WHAT? PHOEBE? YES, MA'AM. OH... PHOEBE... I'M SO HAPPY IT'S YOU. OH, PHOEBE, DEAR, I WISH YOU JOY. AND YOU ALSO, SIR. BUT, SUSAN, I, UH... WELL, REALLY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IS IT THAT MISS LIVVIE IS AN OBSTACLE? MISS LIVVIE AN OBSTACLE? IS THERE SOME MYSTERY ABOUT THE YOUNG LADY? SO MUCH SO, SIR, THAT WE AT ONE TIME THOUGHT THAT SHE AND MISS PHOEBE WERE THE SAME PERSON. WE'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN HER FACE. INDEED? HOW DO YOU FIND YOURSELF, DEAR MISS LIVVIE? IF YOU MUST KNOW, LADIES... SHE FINDS HERSELF TOO ILL TO SEE VISITORS. TOO ILL TO SEE ANYONE. IN THAT CASE, PATTY, I THINK SHE SHOULD SEE A PHYSICIAN. IS SHE VERY POORLY, SIR? WE DID NOT HEAR YOU ADDRESS HER. SHE'S NOT AWAKE, MA'AM. IT'S NOT A VERY SERIOUS ILLNESS, I THINK. WE MUSTN'T TALK, LEST WE DISTURB HER. IN FACT, I THINK YOU'D ALL BETTER GO. PATTY, HAVE THEY GONE YET?! SHH! NO, SUSAN, BUT WE ARE GOING. OH... MISS PHOEBE, I DESIRE TO SEE MISS LIVVIE. IMPOSSIBLE. WHY IMPOSSIBLE? THEY TELL ME STRANGE TALES OF NO ONE SEEING HER. GO AT ONCE AND TELL MISS LIVVIE THAT I MUST SEE HER. YES, SIR. PATTY... OH, HOW DO YOU DO, SIR? WELL, IT CERTAINLY IS A PLEAS - GOOD MORNING, SERGEANT. AT EASE. PATTY, WHY IS THIS TRICK BEING PLAYED UPON ME? UPON YOU, TOO, SIR? HA HA. WELL, I NEVER. AT EASE, SERGEANT. EXPLAIN, PATTY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, SIR. PATTY, I KNOW THERE'S NO MISS LIVVIE. BUT MISS PHOEBE HAS BEEN IMPERSONATING HER. AND IF SHE HAS? WHY HAS SHE DONE THIS? IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT, SIR. MY FAULT? IT WAS YOU WHO STARTED IT, ALL BY NOT KNOWING HER WHEN YOU FIRST RETURNED. INDEED? EVERYTHING'S YOUR FAULT, SIR, AND IT'S TIME YOU KNEW IT. TELL ME, WHY DON'T THEY SAY MISS LIVVIE'S GONE HOME? IT WOULD SAVE THEM A WORLD OF TROUBLE. THE WILLOUGHBYS WATCH THE HOUSE ALL THE TIME. THEY WOULD SAY, "SHE CANNOT HAVE GONE, FOR WE HAVE NO SEEN HER GO." I SEE. MISS LIVVIE IS GREATLY IMPROVED, SIR, AND HAS CONSENTED TO COME IN TO SEE YOU. YOUR SERVANT, MISS LIVVIE. HOW DO YOU DO, SIR? AND, UH, ISN'T MISS PHOEBE TO JOIN US? UH, SHE-SHE... SHE'S TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY OF AIRING THE ROOM. AHH! OF COURSE. CAPTAIN BROWN WILL EXCUSE YOU, PHOEBE. CERTAINLY, MISS SUSAN. ALLOW ME. SHE'LL RECOVER. IN FACT, MA'AM, I THINK I COULD CURE MISS LIVVIE... IF SHE'S PUT UNRESERVEDLY IN MY HANDS.
