I'm here to see Mr Hamre. Okay. Open your ears wide and Iisten. We have nothing new. The girI's been missing for four days. The rest you'II simpIy have to make up. Save your breath, the press won't Iisten. AII they see is a poIitician. - Not a mother who's Iost a chiId... - AII right. What's the Iast update? - You can go through. - Thanks. CouId I get some soup? None of the neighbours. No one has seen anything. She's been taken far off. Not much more we can do here then. - You know Isaksen? - OnIy from reputation. HeIIo. What's your approach? Kidnapped because her mother's a poIitician, she got Iost - or she ran away? Take a seat. You had a case when you were in chiId weIfare. KjetiI VestIi, a paedophiIe. TeII me about him. I onIy know what's in the news. He grew up here, that's why I'm asking. - Aren't weIfare fiIes confidentiaI? - Not aIways. We have everything but the fiIe on VestIi. Do you have it? Who, me? You didn't happen to take some papers with you when you quit? It's the way things go. Things get Iost, peopIe overIooked. - You don't say. - Did you question the famiIy? - The famiIy is not behind this. - In most cases, it's the famiIy. I start regretting I asked you to come. I got you out here because you worked in chiId weIfare. The investigation we can handIe ourseIves. You made me come aII this way just to ask about some oId chiId weIfare fiIes? You know how we operate. - We have a job to do. - You don't have to do it Iike a cop. - What? - You don't have to do it Iike a cop. My, my. Criticizing the cops... Tough to take from you! You Iost that job because you beat up a drug deaIer? That's right. The onIy thing they understand. Eye to an eye. For. Eye foran eye. I'II borrow this. We can't openIy contradict our own programme. I've canceIIed aII appointments this week. - Any news about CamiIIa? - No. It's the County CounciI. Can you take it? Vibeke Farangs teIephone, how may I heIp? She cannot come to the phone. There's been an accident. We'II issue a press reIease Iater today. Thanks. Sorry to troubIe you now, but we need you to sign this. Where is it? - Right here. - Your job's going weII? I'm out searching for CamiIIa. Hamre! Can you take constructive criticism? - What kind, did you say? - Four days, and you've found nothing! We've checked everywhere and InterpoI is onto the case. You need a new approach! Can't I give you some ideas? - We work from facts. - You're fumbIing! We have compass... - You know I can deIiver! - InfideIity cases is your domain! Isaksen! Show Veum to the door, wiII you. It's aII right. HeIIo there! What can I do for you? - You know who I am? - Vibeke Farang. Mother to CamiIIa and party Ieader. What do you want? I noticed you outside our house. Do you work for the poIice? No, I'm independent. I'II heIp you with your daughter. A friend of mine... I want you to find him. Karsten AsIaksen. He works at NorrIon, the PVC pIant at HiIIeren. Okay... Brd, my husband, is away a Iot, and Karsten... - He visits me... - You don't know where your Iover is? That's right. ShouIdn't you rather focus on your daughter? You want me to find AsIaksen and make him get in touch. Karsten was at my house the night CamiIIa disappeared. And now you're afraid that... ...his siIence in some way is reIated to her disappearance? I'm actuaIIy trying to find CamiIIa. - Did you teII this to the poIice? - No. When did he Ieave your house that night? Sometime around midnight. - He took my car. - Why so? He came by taxi and waIked the Iast bit. I aIso ask him not to caII taxis from my address. - So he borrows my car. - Where is it now? It was returned the next morning. I can see you're a pro. You understand why I want to be discreet? HeIIo, Line. Give this to my dad. This man over there, he was asking for Karsten. - Can I heIp you? - I'm Iooking for Karsten AsIaksen. Yes, I know him. What is it about? I'm Varg Veum. His next of kin asked me to find him. Trygve Schrder OIsen. - How do you know him? - I'm a private investigator. - A detective! - Hang on! - What's this? - A detective Iooking for Karsten. - Has something happened to him? - I'm just trying to Iocate him. I'II deaI with this. You can open the meeting. HeIIo. Odin Schrder OIsen. Varg Veum. PIease... So, right... We've not seen Karsten for a few days. Nothing unusuaI. He has a radicaI definition of working hours. He works very hard. Then he conks out. Did you try his mobiIe? - No repIy. - That's not so unusuaI. When was he here Iast? Perhaps a week ago. How about your pIant... Perhaps he's there? NormaIIy, yes. But not now. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm quite sure. Right... Now, if you'II excuse me, I have an important meeting. Anyone home...? Karsten? Hi, PeIIe. I have a card number here. CouId you check where it was used Iast? Kvamskogen Cabin RentaI? Ok, thanks. HeIIo... HeIIo there... AsIaksen? Karsten! Karsten? Damn it... - What was his name again? - Karsten AsIaksen. Did he... - Come on, taIk to me. - I puIIed him out to give him air. - You did hoId your breath, I hope. - Why smash in aII the windows? - This a crime scene. - Ask your boss. He feIt a funny smeII and got nervous. He actuaIIy has a point. - Hope you don't Iike the guy. - The body is moved and gIass broken. - It does kind of compIicate things. - Gee, I'm reaIIy sorry! Hydrocyanide. Count yourseIf Iucky. It's a terribIe way to die. But the site is cIeared, we can go in. And where are you going? Won't you Iet me go in? I found the body! Are you working here, or did you just happen to stop by? Is AsIaksen aII of a sudden a good friend of yours? AsIaksen's empIoyer hired me. NorrIon, a PVC pIant. Hi. Come on, Iet me in. I risked my neck in there! Good morning, it's NorrIon. Ok, thanks. NorrIon did not hire you. And you've paid them a visit, too. CouId you pIease teII me why you are here? - Car keys, pIease. - Are you serious? Hamre... Cut it out. You know you can't question me. Your car was parked on a site where we found a dead body. So how am I supposed to get home? You know we couId do this quite differentIy. - Give me a reason for heIping you. - It's soIved. He did it himseIf. - You don't beIieve that! - He had a PhD in chemistry. Hamre, you know what? One day... ...I'II surprise you. And hand you the soIution on a siIver pIatter. - They pay you weII, huh? - WeII enough. - Enjoy the waIk... - Thank you. I want to report a car theft. Yes, my own car. Right in front of me, coming down from Kvamskogen. Who found the body? This private investigator guy. - Do we have any of those in Bergen? - ApparentIy we do. Did the poIice say anything more? No. The poIice seems to think it was suicide. I reaIIy don't know. But as this happens just after CamiIIa... You reaIize of course that it rises new questions? Just teII me everything you remember from that night. She was asIeep. She had kicked the covers off, she aIways gets so hot... I tucked her back in, set the window ajar... - You don't think anyone entered...? - ProbabIy not. Karsten arrived as I checked on the kids. They were both asIeep. I foIIowed him out when he Ieft... Around midnight. I saw him drive off. I went back in to check on the kids again. And then CamiIIa was gone. Oh, Brd, hi... What is it? Has something happened? - Nothing new? - No. - Varg Veum. He's assisting the poIice. - I came to see about your son Henrik. I'm a sociaI worker. Wanted to see how he's coping. Great. HeIIo. Hi, buddy. Are you going for a spin? Can I come aIong? Great! - Going far? - Kind of. Hi. - My name is Varg. - Hi. And you're Henrik, right? - Do you go driving often, then? - Yeah. - Do you Iet CamiIIa drive aIso? - No! GirIs can't drive, you know. OnIy boys can drive, right? So she sits here, in this seat? Or she Iies in the back. But then she aIways faIIs asIeep. Do you miss your sister? Henrik! Henrik! Vibeke! He's in here! Henrik... What were you thinking? - Never go out without teIIing me! - But I did. Did you? I'm sorry... Go in before you catch a coId. - Vibeke... - What? Didn't you say that Karsten borrowed the car? What if CamiIIa was in the back, and feII asIeep? Oh no... They Iook good on you. So, is there anything you'd Iike to teII me? AsIaksen may be invoIved in CamiIIa Farang's disappearance. - A bit far-fetched? - Perhaps. But have a good Iook around. The post-mortem showed he was aII rotten inside. From abusing various substances. He had onIy three months Ieft. But stiII, it was murder. Why exactIy are you here? This is a murder case and you're hoIding back reIevant information. Hey! Is it so bIoody difficuIt to open your mouth? Easy, easy now... I couId take you downstairs and knock it out of you. Then reaIIy you wouId amaze me. Yeah... That makes two of us. - Why do you think it's murder, then? - I couIdn't be bothered to teII you. Try again. You just turn it that way. That's it, Johan Fredrik! - I couIdn't stop him. - HaraId Schrder OIsen! - Great pIace this. - Johan Fredrik, Iisten... FoIIow Stine back up, wiII you. We can continue Iater. WiII granddad Iet me fish Iater? My name is Veum. I'm a private investigator. What can you teII me about Karsten AsIaksen? Karsten, poor Iad... I hired him. He was a cIose friend of my sons, Odin and Trygve. His mother died young. An aIcohoIic. But he managed weII. He was the survivor type. - Up untiI now. - But things were going downhiII. He was restIess, couId never settIe. Hanging out with shady characters. UnfaithfuI women, rejected husbands, prostitutes, drug deaIers... - And what not! - Anyone in particuIar? I don't know these kind of peopIe. StiII, you seem weII informed. You know, Veum... I'm a good observer of peopIe. Many underestimate me. I think you understand what I mean. Can you see any reason for him being kiIIed Iiked that? - I thought it was suicide. - Who knows... If anyone toId me Karsten took his own Iife in this way... ...I wouId've beIieved it. Chemists know how to handIe substances. - I just can't see any motive. - Haven't you taIked to Brd? The guy who was on the news and had Iost his IittIe girI. - You mean Brd Farang? - Right, that's him. - AsIaksen and Farang knew each other? - They were cIose friends. Went to schooI together, traveIIed the worId, and now worked at the pIant. If anyone knows who kept a grudge against Karsten, then it's Brd. CamiIIa! HeIIo. StiII no trace of her? - You may heIp, if you Iike. - Did you hear Karsten has been kiIIed? I can't deaI with that right now. I have other things on my mind. You don't seem very upset. What are you trying to say? The same thing the poIice wiII ask when they find out what I know. Are you of a jeaIous nature, Brd? You think I kiII peopIe just because my wife cheated on me? - That's what you think. - I onIy asked if you were jeaIous. So you suspected that your wife was cheating on you? You prying bastard! I'm trying to find my daughter. Hi! We're making buns. CamiIIa Ioved that! Can I have a word with you, in private? - I'II go. - No, stay. You know everything. I can't keep your reIationship secret anymore. I have to teII the poIice. What?! We had a deaI, Varg. Why didn't you teII me Karsten and Brd were friends? - That's no secret. - Brd knew about you and Karsten. - A cIassic motive. - Brd wouId never... If CamiIIa disappeared in the vicinity of Karsten's house... ...then the poIice has to be informed. I'm sorry. In Bergen, another tragedy has hit Vibeke Farang, the party Ieader. Her husband Brd Farang was today arrested on suspicion of the murder of his friend and coIIeague, Karsten AsIaksen. According to the poIice the motive for the murder was probabIy... ...jeaIousy. Vibeke Farang did not wish to make any statement. NO TRACE OF 7 YEAR OLD CAMILLA - Has Brd Farang confessed? - You know I can't answer that. - Then he hasn't. - Take the car before I change my mind. A RenauIt Spider! Is it your's? - It beIonged to Karsten AsIaksen. - AsIaksen? - He had a Defender up at the cabin. - I guess he had severaI cars. See you Iater then, Varg. Odin... CIose the door, wiII you. I've... I've changed my mind... ...I prefer Trygve as GeneraI Manager. What? - CongratuIations. - Thank you. GentIemen... A very speciaI person is not amongst us today. Karsten AsIaksen was a highIy regarded... Hi. Odin... DonaIdson we'II be here soon. ShouIdn't you attend the meeting? You know how important this deaI is. - Yes, I... - Excuse me. There's a visitor here for you. A Varg Veum. - HeIIo... - I don't have the time. Hi. Odin Schrder OIsen doesn't have the time to see you. - I can see that. - Can I heIp you? - Perhaps you couId... - Anna KeiIhaug. - Chief LegaI Adviser. - Wow. Anna KeiIhaug, I have a visitor with me. - What's the purpose of the visit? - Espionage! I'm going to show him around. In these we have ammonia, and over there chIoride. The new compound is then poIymerized into poIymethyI methacryIate. - Right. - From which we make hydrogen acid. From that again we make...pIexigIass. Our most important product. Many dangerous substances! Quite a pIant. Thought you had financiaI probIems. - Who says? - The press. Those are just temporary probIems. The saIes are picking up. We have a five year pIan for going on the stock market... Trygve Schrder OIsen. And Odin, too. Am I disturbing? HeIIo. We're actuaIIy very busy. - Get him inside, Trygve. Did I come at a bad time? I'm investigating the AsIaksen murder. CouId you heIp me? - Did he come with you? - He died from some substances... - The kind of stuff you have here. - We don't have time for your games. Get him out of here. You faiIed the PoIice Academy entry test and pIay buIIies instead? What's going on? Never taIk to him again before seeing me. - We don't know who he's working for. - Odin asked me to... Odin doesn't make decisions. I do. Anna, wouId you excuse us? Take care of DonaIdson. Fucking heII, Trygve... - How can you be so stupid? - Right. I am stupid? - You Iet this detective snoop around. - He was with Anna! Now what wiII he think? What the heII are you thinking? Start yeIIing at me Iike this? I'm your boss, Odin. Father appointed me. What have you done for the company IateIy? Take a Iook at this. It's a suicide note. What of it? Karsten's suicide note. He was going to teII everything. So...? I... I couIdn't Iet him do it. What are you teIIing me? Odin..! - He was one of my best friends. - Odin! Does father know? Why do you think you are manager now, and not me? What exactIy have you done for the company IateIy? Can you handIe Varg Veum? Fuck... Bastards! - Yes, Karsten. - ...a friend of mine. He started to hang out with shady characters. Prostitutes and drug deaIers, and what not! A RenauIt Spider, is it yours? It beIonged to Karsten AsIaksen. - Yes? - Can I come in? We're cIosed. Karsten AsIaksen gave you his warmest recommendation. AsIaksen recommended a girI. Is that... Birgit, wiII you go get Tanja? Right, Tanja. That's it. It's 800 for haIf an hour massage. If you have other wishes, you sort it out with the girIs. You said 800? - Thanks. - Thank you. - What did he want? - He asked for Karsten's girI. - I see... - ShouIdn't I have Iet him in? No, no. That's fine. I'm sending someone over. We performed an impromptu inspection at NorrIon Iast week on the 12th. In conjunction with the NationaI PoIIution Authority. And what did you find? Nothing. Everything was conform to the reguIations. to get hoId of this guy. And now you don't know where he is? What do you get paid for? Go sit down. - He can't just vanish. - Of course he can. What wouId you have done? You'd taken the hint and gone away. Taken the hint? I can't Iive with suppositions. I must know where he is. He couId toppIe our whoIe operation. Hi, Anna. No, no, come. I found the DonaIdson contract on my desk, signed and aII. It says here he's paying 135 miIIion, not the 1 40 that was agreed in the deaI. Yes... There were some deIays, Anna. So we made a price cut in order not to Iose the contract. Part of the point of my job is that I get to Iook at contracts before they've been signed. I negotiated this one myseIf. I didn't need your services this time. That's your copy according to procedure. - Anything eIse? - No. AII is fine. - Oh..! - I didn't mean to scare you. - Security! - Give me 5 minutes. Then you can caII them back, just for show. Right... An inspection was performed at the pIant on the 12th, the day after CamiIIa Farang disappeared. Four days Iater AsIaksen is kiIIed. These events must be connected. Is this some kind of chaos theory? - ButterfIies turning into tornados? - No, there's a direct connection. The inspection found nothing wrong. - Yeah? I'd check, if I were you. - Why shouId I beIieve you? - Something fishy is going on. - According to you. Prove me wrong, by aII means. PIease prove me wrong. Come on in! That wasn't 5 minutes. HeIIo! Long time no see. Look at these cIassy wheeIs! Your father shouId've seen you now. - Have you quit raIIy driving, then? - No, no. But it's an expensive hobby. Are these the cars I've seen out at NorrIon? They are our biggest customer. Important guys, you know. They caII, and out we rush to pick up peopIe. MostIy at HoteI Norge, or the pIant. HoteI Norge? - No thanks. - Have you quit? Right, NorrIon... Who was that? This...American guy. PracticaIIy baId. The one with aII the body guards. Gave huge tips. He went out a bit earIier. - So he's stiII staying here? - Think so. - When did he come? - I'm not sure. The reception tried to move him. But he wanted to stay another week. Made a huge fuss about it. PeopIe with money, you know. So he was supposed to Ieave, but insisted on staying another week? That's right. Is that of any heIp? Kim. I want you to do me yet another favour. No, Varg. I just can't. HeIIo? Kim, what did you say...? WeII, Iook here..! Isaksen, perhaps you can go and have a Iook at the view. - This is getting reaIIy embarrassing. - What are you referring to? Like why you are bothering the peopIe at NorrIon? There's something fishy going on. CIients who avoid dayIight. AsIaksen was kiIIed because he found something. - You have evidence, of course. - I'm working on it. I can hardIy wait. They don't Iike you much at NorrIon, you know. They've fiIed a compIaint for break-in and threats. You'II be fined and restrained. BuIIshit. I haven't threatened anyone. TaIk to their Iawyer, Anna KeiIhaug. We did. She's the one who fiIed the compIaint. Don't catch a coId now. Here's the fiIe from the inspection at the pIant on the 12th. - HeIIo. - Hi, Odin. - What are you doing? - I checked the inspection report. According to the Iog there was some activity at the pIant on the night before the inspection. UnusuaI with cars Iogged in so Iate. - Let me see. - Like yours and Trygve's. Just a maIfunctioning computer. ShouId've been soIved ages ago! Don't worry about it. I'II sort it out. Hi, it's Anna KeiIhaug from the head office. I'd Iike a copy of the visitors Iog from the 12th. Perhaps you couId send it by fax? HeIIo again... Why a compIaint for threats? You have no right prying around Iike this. Did you check the inspection report? Can you Ieave me aIone? This is making me uncomfortabIe. A girI is missing, a man was kiIIed and someone tried to kiII me aIso! When the press gets hoId of this, do you want to be in it? Get your picture in the papers as accompIice. WouId you Iike that? WouId you Iike that?! Come inside. And stop shouting. As a Iawyer I'm bound to secrecy. I cannot discuss anything confidentiaI reIated to... Why are you speaking Iike a textbook? What is reaIIy aII this about? - A mother who has Iost her chiId. - I can't heIp you. If you want information from me, you'II have to steaI it. In that case, make sure I don't see it happen. - Want something to drink? - PIease. - Beer, wine, soda? - A beer sounds good. Thank you. Who at NorrIon is most infIuentiaI? Trygve, Odin or... - I don't want to taIk about NorrIon. - Okay. Why onIy pictures of you as a young girI? Don't you Iike the one you are now? I had photos of me and my fianc. But... - They wouId destroy my mood, so I... - Took them down? And you? TeII me. Much of the same. Thanks for the beer. The night before October 12th... At haIf past midnight... There's Trygve... Trygve arrives... Then Odin. What the heII are you doing there the night before the inspection? What the fuck... There are three cars. So who are you then? DonaIdson? I'm sure I've seen that number before. Try to think! What do you want here? Karsten, he... He didn't drive home that night. He went to NorrIon's pIant. In your car. They must have known they wouId be checked up on. So they went there to cIean up. I beIieve... I beIieve something happened to CamiIIa at the site. You beIieve something happened? You can't come here and say this... I need to know what happened to her! I need to know! Hi, it's Anna! It's me. - What do you want? - CamiIIa disappeared at the pIant, and I must find her. I need your heIp. - Where do you take this from? - The Iog you gave me... - I gave you nothing. - This is important. It shows Karsten went straight there after Ieaving Vibeke Farang. With CamiIIa sIeeping in the back. Something happened to her and your empIoyers are trying to cover it up. Your ship is going down, Anna. Want to get onto a Iifeboat? What do I have to do? - In a hurry? - No. - No? - WeII, kind of. CouId you heIp Trygve revise some contracts? - You mean now? - I can foIIow you to him. AII right. NorrIon are invoIved in industriaI crime, some bIack market scheme. They were tipped off the night before the inspection, went in and removed aII evidence. Veum, be kind to me, wiII you. Hang on. Hamre, wait! I'II try once more. This is Anna KeiIhaug at NorrIon, pIease Ieave a message... She must have gotten stuck in traffic on her way here. She can confirm this is authentic. It shows AsIaksen was there that night. - It's not iIIegaI to work Iate. - AII right... DonaIdson, their customer. His hoteI room was booked untiI the day of the inspection. Then he wants to stay one more week. Why? And he had Ioads of sea charts. - Are you pIaying by the ruIes now? - The inspection fucked up the deaI. What I'm giving you, is that this guy's stiII in town. Is it so very unIikeIy that CamiIIa was the victim of an accident in a pIant fuII of poison? If they kept toxic waste there iIIegaIIy and she becomes exposed to it, then... Then it's mansIaughter. Isn't that serious enough? Have you dreamt this up or is it a hunch? It's aII here in this fiIe! The mobiIe phone has been switched off... Come on, Hamre. Hamre! WiII you pIease Iisten! You can at Ieast check it, I'm not making this up. Brd Farang is innocent. AsIaksen was kiIIed by Trygve or Odin to stop him from taIking. You're not aIone in cIaiming that. Vibeke Farang was down at the station and made a big scene. Screaming NorrIon had kiIIed her daughter. She even broke a window. So you mentioned this to a woman who's Iike an open wound? What's the matter with you? You behave Iike a chiId. You're pIaying detective, without reaIizing the consequences. Do everyone a big favour and... Go stay in your room. - Aren't you staying for dinner? - We have a shipment. - The customer wanted us present. - We'II be back in time for coffee. Ok. Bye then. Understand now why I want to retire? Imagine, work on a Friday night! It's time the young took over! HaraId Schrder OIsen! What's going on? Have you seen this girI before? Is your conscience cIear? What did you do to her? The chief of the County Inspectorate! Are you here, you corrupt bastard? - And the mayor! - Now we can aII caIm down... I'd Iove to discuss this, but I have no idea what you are referring to. And this happens to be my house. - Great pIace you've got. - We're having a party... - What a fucking nice pIace! - Now you've gone way too far. You wiII Iive to regret this. SeriousIy regret it. - Come on. - This is Varg Veum. He's investigating the disappearance of that IittIe girI, CamiIIa Farang. - But now he's Ieaving. - You crooked swine! You fucking... Come on then, come on! Come on, then. We'II go for a ride... Trygve! Wait. Get in the car. Trygve! Come on, now! - What exactIy are we doing, Odin? - I have no time to expIain now. We're seIIing chemicaI weapons! ChemicaI weapons? What use the customer make of our product is not our business. Do you reaIize how much money we'II make? Didn't you want us to go on the market? Monrad! Oh, fuck... BIoody heII... HeIp me! HeIp! Somebody heIp me! HeIIo there! Let her go. - Who's he? - I've got CamiIIa. What are you taIking about? - You're bIuffing. - Look in the barreI. Come on, then! Where is CamiIIa! - You're not getting away with this. - Are you going to stop me? Where is the gas shipped, you wicked bastard? Trygve! Do you sIeep weII at nights? Anna! Varg! No, keep them separate. Put her in the other container. Monrad! Find that damn body. Start around the main buiIding. - Odin, this is way out of Iine. - Just shut up and do as I teII you. Where's Anna? Where is she? She's the Ieast probIem you've got right now. You know what this is? This mix is caIIed hydrocyanide. Or hydrogen acid. It works so that... It stops your ceIIs from absorbing oxygen. If you breath this, aII the ceIIs in your body wiII suffocate. How Iong can you keep your breath, Varg? In one minute you're unconscious. In five you're dead. Certain you won't teII me where CamiIIa is? Any sign of Monrad? Put the suit on. Hurry up! Varg, are you ready for some more? The first mix was not so strong. You'd better hurry. Say where she is. Think, Varg. Where the heII is she? Monrad! Quiet. It's me. But where is Odin? Odin is dead. Take it easy. Mummy... What the heII is this, Hamre? I'm arresting HaraId Schrder OIsen for saIe of chemicaI weapons and the mansIaughter of CamiIIa Farang. The Coast Guard intercepted a ship with a very interesting cargo. Where do you take aII this from? A tip-off from the pubIic. This is Varg Veum. He's... He's kind of a distant reIative. WeII then... - PoIice commissioner Hansen. - Did you have a good party? Where shouId I take you? - No one is waiting for you either? - No. I'm not known for being such good company. I have a coupIe of bottIes of Chteau Latour at home. I've saved them for a speciaI occasion. So Iet's stop by your pIace first and pick them up. SubtitIes: Martin BjorIo
