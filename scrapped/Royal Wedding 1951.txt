I never notice if it's dark or clear. What people say to me I hardly hear. The passing hours are an endless year until at last I'm alone with you. Every night at seven you walk in as fresh as clover and I begin to sigh all over again. Every night at seven you come by like May returning and me, o my I start in yearning again. You seem to bring far away spring near me. I'm always in full bloom when you're in the room. For every night at seven, every time the same thing happens. I fall once again in love but only with you. (Chorus) Every night at seven, every time the same thing happens. I fall once again in love, but only with you. May I say your performance was a bit ragged. You were so slow going around the throne I almost caught you. Well the audience seemed to like it. It's so hot in New York in the summer. I'm glad we're closing tomorrow night. I wonder what happened to the air conditioning. Mr. Hiller probably turned it off to save money. Oh, would you blot my face too. Up here it's dripping. Who's Mr. Hiller? The house manager. You ought to know that. You've been playing his theatre for the past year and a half. Is that that evil little man who comes around and pinches? That's your department sister dear. All I can say is let Mr. Hiller keep his air conditioning. He can't take it with him, and where's he's going, he'll need it. Boy, it's hot! If I ever play a king again, I'll be one of those Asiatic boys who just wears earrings and a sheet. Hey! What's your hurry? Pete. Hi Ellen honey. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. You know my brother Tom, don't you? No I don't believe I've had the pleasure. How are you? I'm fine Sir, and thank you for asking. I'll be out in five. Oh, my peach you look so nice and cool. Make yourself at home. Sit down, anywhere. - Oh, how was it sir? - Hot. Oh, Um your agent stopped by to see you sir. Irving. What brought him out this clammy night? (Chesley) He didn't say. He just told me to tell you it was imperative that you and Miss Ellen meet him at McGuffie's bar, next door, right after the performance. Oh Ellen. (Ellen) Yeah. Irving wants us to meet him at Mcguffies. Okay. How do you like Pete? Isn't he cute. He's from the south. Why Ellen honey, I never would have guessed it. He owns miles and miles of tobacco land in Virginia. And you ought to hear him chant. I met him two days ago at Hilda's Barn sales. And I'm simply mad about him. Is that all. That's all. Roger. Miss Ellen seems quite taken. Doesn't she? This will probably be one of those long affairs that drags on a whole evening. (Radio) News overseas concerns the Royal Wedding in London. The British capital is already festive and happy in anticipation of the wedding, which is still several weeks off. - Towel. - Ssh. Please Sir. (Radio Broadcast contd.) As for the Princess, the most guarded secret in England since radar is her wedding gown. The Princess herself will see it for the first time this weekend. - Just give me... - Please Sir. (Radio Broadcast cont.) Other news. In Miami Florida, a new tropical hurricane seems to be approaching. Can I talk now? Yes Sir, You know Mr. Bowen I danced in Trafalgar Square the day her grandfather was married. I'd give anything to be there again this fall, wouldn't you? Yes. I like weddings provided, of course, they're not mine. Oh, marriages are very healthy sir. They say married men live much longer that bachelors. If that's true, they're only trying to outlive their wives so they can be bachelors again. Haven't you ever thought of getting married Sir? Once, as a matter of fact I did. The young lady changed her mind at the last moment. I've been indebted to her ever since. Goodnight Chesley. Gee, I wonder what Irving wants? I hope it's something that... My gosh what a muscle, It's like cement. Oh, it's nothing. All us tobacco men get kinda strong. - What from? - Lifting money. (Loud laughter) Come now it wasn't that good. - Good night Eddie. - Goodnight. - Good night Eddie. - Goodnight. He's the only stage door man I know that isn't called pop. Hello Bill. Hi Irv. I couldn't wait for you backstage tonight. What's it with that heat? Who needs it? So how was the show? - The first act was a little... - Dollboat, how are you baby? Fine. How are you? - Oh, you look so sweet tonight. - I do, don't I? Okay. Come on, order. I got new, big news. Can I present Pete Cumberley? How do you do, Mr. Cumberley. It's a great pleasure. Thank you Sir. That's very nice. - Who's this square? - A friend. - A Tom Collins please. - Nothing for me, thanks. Hit me with a rye. Shall I give it to you? What is it? This'll kill you. My brother Edgar called tonight from England. He's the boss of our London Office, been there for years. The Mayfair Theatre people want your whole show for London. No! But quick they want you there during the wedding season. - England during the wedding. - I like that. Oh, Tommy. Ellen honey, does this mean you'll be leaving me? Yes Pete. Isn't it wonderful? When do we open? As soon as possible. Of course you gotta rehearse the English cast first. Hit me son. What about transportation? There's some French boat leaving a week from next Monday. Which one? Who knows what's the name, it's in French. Don't worry I'll get you on it. Ellen, this means we'll be saying good-bye in ten days. Oh yes Pete I'm so happy. - Ellen. - Oh, hello Dick. I was waiting for you backstage. That's why I'm late. I'm sorry. - Ellen, who is this fella? - Finish your drink Pete. Did you hear the good news? We're going to England and we'll be there during the wedding! What are you doing here, Sir? - What do you mean? Who's he? - A friend. What are you doing here Sir? I demand an answer. Go peddle your papers! When do you leave? - That's an insult. - What's an insult? (Argument in background) This is terribly embarrassing. I forgot all about Dick. I hope they don't hit each other. We ought to start packing. I have to buy all my new clothes before I go. You'll have time. I'll send the rest of the Company the week after you leave. - I wonder what they'll be wearing? - I don't know. - Pay the man, will you? - Sure. How much do we owe you? - May I? - Yes you may. And keep the change. I have a little business to take care of, I'll meet you on deck. Okay sister dear. Hello Billy. This is good-bye. Thanks for coming down to see me off. It's hard saying good-bye after all we've been to each other. I know, it's been a lovely three days. But I'll be back soon. Oh, dear. I must go now. May I walk you up the gangplank? Well, I'd rather you wouldn't, you understand. No. Well, it's just better that way Write to me Billy. I will. Goodbye Ellen. (English male voice) I'll miss you very much Linda. Knowing you these past few weeks has been one of the most exciting things that's ever happened to me. To me too, John. Pete! Ellen honey. I thought I went to the wrong gate. We haven't much time. Really? And I have so much to say. - What? - Well, you gonna be away. Yes I know Pete, but what? Suddenly knowing you're gonna be away makes me realise my feelings for you. So I thought I'd. I mean, Ellen honey. Visitors ashore please! Oh dear Pete, you'll have to go now. But Ellen honey. Better hurry. Write me what you had to say, huh? Bye. (English male voice) Barbara, knowing you these past few weeks has been one of the most exciting things that's ever happened to me. I'll miss you John. - Good-bye baby. - Goodbye Irv. I know you'll be a smash. Now if you want anything you ask my brother Edgar. He's gonna meet you at the hotel. - So long Irv. - Bye. So long Ellen. So long. Bye honey! See you soon. So long, see ya! Hey. Who are you waiving up there? My girl, right there, see. That's my girl. Oh, don't give me that. That's my girl. I bet against five on Dixie boy. What a beautiful, beautiful day. Isn't it wonderful. We don't know a soul on the boat, and we can have fun together for a change. Yeah. - Good day. - Good day. I don't know him, Tom. Honest I don't. I want to write a letter. Okay baby. Don't forget we've got to rehearse. What time should I meet you? Two o'clock sharp, in the gym. - I won't keep you long. - I'll be there don't worry. - Now don't be late. - Okay. - Good day. - Good day. There's carbon paper in the middle drawer, if you want to make duplicates. I'm not writing a letter, I was just doodling, waiting for an opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Brindale. Lord John Brindale, and what's yours? Bowen. Duchess Agatha Bowen. Oh, no really. What is it? Oh, let's see now. E. B. E, is that Ethel? Wait a minute. Bowen, why of course - you're Ellen Bowen aren't you? You're doing fine. It's very stupid of me, I should have known. I only saw your show a few weeks ago. Please forgive me. Oh, that's alright, I know you have a lot on your mind. Oh, I can explain those two little episodes that you witnessed yesterday. - Oh, you can? - Yes. Then go ahead. Well, you see, they're both terribly nice girls, and they're so fond of me, that I couldn't bear depriving either one of them. You know how it is. To be kind to people, one has to be a very good liar. Tell me, why were you following me? Following you? I was doing no such thing. I was only saying goodbye to a couple of... - The same? - Yeah. Does this sort of thing happen to you very often? Oh, all the time. And you? Constantly. I guess we're both two kind people. I have to get a stamp. Do you live in New York? No, I've been there on business, but I'm just going home for the wedding. - The Royal Wedding? - Yeah. You're going to the wedding? Well I'm escorting someone, yes. You really are a Lord aren't you? I'm afraid so. My, my! Haven't you met anyone who held a title before? Only Joe Louis. - I'm very glad you're Ellen Bowen. - Why? It means that the chap you're with is your brother, not your husband. Do you know what I did last night? No, what? I surveyed this whole boat, and I discovered that you were the most attractive girl on board. Well, thank you. And I kept thinking that, what a pity she's married, because that's going to make things terribly awkward. But it isn't going to be awkward at all now. - Thanks for the use of the hall, purser. - Not at all. If you see my sister on deck, tell her I'm waiting for her please. I will. - I like your boat. - Thank you Monsieur. Monsieur Bowen. I have a favour to ask. On every crossing, we have a gala benefit for the disabled seamen. I was wondering if you and your sister would dance for us on that night. Oh, we'd love to. Just tell us when. One number would be sufficient. No trouble at all. I know it's an imposition to ask you two. But I would feel so... We'd love to. Don't worry we'll do it. There's a fella that won't take yes for an answer. Oh, fine. Thanks for showing up for rehearsals. Oh... Er John, this is my brother Tom. Tom this is John. - How do you do? - Glad to know you. I just picked up John in the writing room. - So I gather. - He's a real Lord. Oh, it's nothing at all. - Miss Bowen. - Yes. - A cable. - Oh, thank you. Excuse me please. Oh, Tom. That was from Pete. He says he's very blue except for his eye which is black. Let's forget Pete for this trip, shall we? Excuse us. Oh dear. It looks a little dim out there, doesn't it? Yeah. Monsieur Bowen, I'm wondering if you and your sister would dance right away instead of waiting until 10:30. We're a little afraid of the weather. - You mean it might be a little rocky? - Yes. That won't bother us, we can handle it. - Thank you, Monsieur. - Any time you say. I'd better change my dress. Open your eyes, there's a sapphire sky above us. High above us. Made for you. When you open your eyes. Open your eyes, there's a carpet of jade around us. Laid around us. All for you. When you open your eyes. Let me show you the sight. Take you on a tour of this great, new fabulous world. We own. We alone. So open you eyes and you'll see how this momentary, ordinary night can seem. More unreal than a dream. We can handle it alright. What do we do now? - Keep your balance. - Oh, sure. So sorry. - Oh, it's nothing. - Pardon us. (Applause) What? - Isn't it wonderful Tommy? - It sure is. (Phone rings) Hello. Yes. Oh, sure. Yes, yes. Do come on up. Room two hundred & eleven, twelve and fourteen. OK. Who was that? Edgar Klinger, Irving's brother, he's coming up. I'm so happy Tommy. I wonder what the Princess is doing this morning? Why don't you call her and ask her? I know what I'd be doing a month before my wedding. Probably trying to figure a way to get out of it. Do you really think so? You know you would, and so would I. (Door bell) How do you do? I'm Edgar Klinger. Oh, we didn't know... - That Irving and I were twins. - No, we didn't. I must say. He should have told you, you know. After all this is a pretty box of pickles. May I come in? Of course, I'm sorry. How do you do? So happy to meet you at long last. - My, it's amazing. - It is rather, isn't it? I do hope the rooms are satisfactory. Oh, they're fine. It's a miracle you could get them. Yes quite. The wedding has backed things up a bit. But, er, then there are ways. How's everything in the theatre? Oh, seems to be humming. The dancers are coming to audition this afternoon. The singers tomorrow. (Phone rings) Excuse me please. Hello. Oh, hello Johnny, how are you? Ellen's boat romance. John Brindale. You know him? Know the family, very old. They do say that young John's a bit of a chaser. Didn't have to chase very hard after Ellen. She stood still and waited. This afternoon, no they're auditioning all day. Just a minute. Tom you don't need me this afternoon, do you? John wants me to drive down and see his old country house with him. I suppose it's alright. But I thought you'd want to come and see who you're working with. Oh, I never notice anyone but you. - John. - I want you home for dinner. And no dates at night until after we open. You come strolling in at four in the morning, and be tired out next day. Yes Poppa. It's all set. What time will you pick me up? Ok. I'll be ready. Bye Johnny. Shall we? Yeah. I'll see you at seven and be back. - Oh, I will. I will. - Cheerio. Goodbye Edgar. Oh, and if there's anything you need, do call. Thank you. After you... Tell me old boy, how are things in the Colonies, these day? Oh, fine, fine. These English clothes are terrific. Frankly amusing tie. Yeah. Got a match? Thanks. I hear that shaving lotion's great stuff, do you ever use it? Oh, every day. Sorry. I thought you were him. How odd. Thank you. I must get back to the office. You know where the theatre is, don't you? Sure. Well I'll see you later. Cheerio. Okay. Well hello again. I wish you'd stop following me. Following you? I'm not a bit flattered. Mr. Bowen. I'm Charles Gordon your stage manager. Oh, it's nice to see you. - Everything's ready Sir. - Oh good. See that girl in the green dress, near the end changing her shoes. Yes Sir. Let's begin with her. They can each show me a few steps. Very good Sir. - You name please? - Anne Ashmond. Thank you. Will you begin please? Why, yes. Miss Anne Ashman. Will you try a few steps with me please? Oh, dear. Can't you dance with a partner? I could until a moment ago. Well try. We'll take something easy to start. May I have a pick-up please? You should have seen the expression on your face, when you saw me. - How did I look? - As if I were a dentist. - You dance very well. - Thank you. - I think you'll do fine. - Will I really? Sure. It's very nice of you not to hold what happened against me. I do a little bit. Well, what can I do? You can have dinner with me some night. - Well, I should love to. - How about tonight? Well, I don't really know. She'll do fine. Pick you up at eight. Thank you. Who's next? Is it much further? No, we're almost there My, you look pretty. I know. What do you have to do at the house? Get the wedding present. We sold almost everything at auction, except for one set of china plates. I was supposed to get those when I got married. Since there's little chance of that, we decided to hand them to the Prince & Princess. - Why is there precious little chance? - Oh, I don't know. You have to enjoy living with yourself, before you have the nerve to ask anyone else to. Besides, you know how I am. Oh, here we are. John, it's beautiful! Yes it was. I think they're in here. What a wonderful floor to dance on. How long since anyone's lived here, John? About five years. No one could afford places like this today. - I imagine you miss it terribly. - I don't think I do anymore. I just don't have anything to replace it with. - What time do you have to be back? - Seven sharp. Oh, I wish you could have dinner with me. I don't know when I'll get another free evening. There's some sort of party every night from now on. Can't you? I don't know. You know how Tom is? Will you try? - Yes I'll try. - Good. Hello. Hi. Back on time. How was the afternoon? It was wonderful. How were your dancers? Dancers. What do you want to do tonight? I'm kinda tired Ellie. I thought I'd just skip dinner and go straight to bed. Would you mind? Oh, no. It's a good idea. That country air really knocks me out. - Yeah. Sure you don't mind? - Oh, gosh no. Matter of fact, I think I'll turn in right now if it's alright with you. It's a good idea. It's been a kind of a rough day. Yeah. - Goodnight honey. - Goodnight Tommy. Sweet dreams. Taxi, please. Thank you! Taxi! Thank you. - More coffee? - Thank you. Yes. Ellie and I have done quite a few shows together. Do you like to dance? Yes, yes. It's hard work but it's fun. What made you decide to dance? Oh, a very silly reason. How silly? When I was eleven I fell in love for the first time with a boy much older. - Twelve? - No thirteen. His name was Alonzo, and I was so happy that suddenly all I wanted to do was dance. So I figured that if I danced when I was happy, I should be happy if I dance. Is that silly enough? I think so. I felt so good about Alonzo I used to close my eyes and pretend I could dance all over the floor, walls, even the ceilings. If you ever learn to do that, I could get you a very good booking. Want anything else? No. Let's go. - You'd better not take me home. - Why not? Well it's a long way, and besides this is Friday. Friday I have to stop and see my Father. - Oh, I'd like to meet him. Cabby! - Alright. - What's the address? - 150, Mitchell Street. Cabby, could you take us to 150, Mitchell Street? Love to Guvnor. Love to. - Wait will you please, driver? - Love to Guvnor, love to. - That's my father he's the proprietor. - Oh. Oh dear. I hope he won't offend you. He's quite impossible really. He and my mother have been separated for three years, and I have to stop here every Friday and get her money. - Why doesn't your mother do it? - They're not speaking to each other. So I says to him. McBride, every time you get four drinks under that belt o' yours, you become a bloomin' nuisance. And what's more, every time you fall down, you chip a piece out of the bar with your chin. So I says from now on... Annie! Well my little girl, how are you dear? Hello Jamie. Tom, this is my father. Father, this Tom Bowen. Glad to know you, Mr. Ashmond - Please to meet you Sir. To the Royal couple. Bowen eh? I used to know a Willie Bowen. Good old Willie. Married a girl we used to know named Gladys Hawksley. I don't think you knew Gladys, Annie. Very happy they were for years. Then one night good old Willie threw her out of the window. Nobody knows why. But I always figured they must have had an argument. - I don't suppose you'd be any relation? - Why no. I don't believe I have any relations over here. Over here? You see I'm from America. America! America! Get out of my pub. Leave the premises. I'm not on speaking terms with the United States. Jamie! How dare you bring another yank to my tavern. Out, do you hear? Out! What's the matter with the United States? Matter! You owe me money, you do. Where is it? Look at this, two pounds, ten shillings, run up by your bloomin' soldiers. And what did they do? Hopped it. Walked out without paying. I'll not serve you a drink Sir. Now stop it Jamie. To the Royal Couple. Well, I can't allow Anglo-American relations to be threatened like this. I'd like to square that bill. - Tom you shouldn't. - Oh, sure. How much is that? Two pounds ten, let me see. There you are Sir. Now there's a gentleman for you. Not like the other Yank you're so fond of. Well, you can just add ten bob and give it to me for mother. Has she found out when we go to the Palace yet? Or is she keeping it from me? Three pounds Jamie. You see we sent a little token to the Royal Highnesses for the wedding. According to the papers, anybody who did are allowed to see the wedding presents. It's a nice custom. Three pounds Jamie. Oh alright. Here. What you counting for? Don't you trust me? Just like her mother, no faith. You're five shillings short. Oh, that's what you might call a typographical error. Here. Thank you. We'd better go. Goodnight Jamie. Goodnight dearie. Goodnight pal. Goodnight buddy. To the Royal Couple. Thanks. Looks like Mother is still up. Since she and Jamie separated, she can never get to sleep till I get home. Let's walk a minute and get some nice fresh fog... Who, er, who's the yank you're so fond of? Hal Rayton. He's my fianc. You don't sound very happy about it. Oh I am really. Is it a secret? No. Oh, this is ridiculous. He's in Chicago. Illinois? He lives there. - And you live here? - Yes. If you keep that arrangement after you're married, you'll be very happy. How long since you've seen him? About two years. Two years! And you're still in love with him. I've never thought of not being. - Do you hear from him very often? - Every few days as a rule. Oh? Actually, I haven't heard from him for two months now. But he's probably been busy. I wrote to him tonight and told him I was in your show, and asked him to call me opening night. I assume you have some plans about getting together in the future? Oh yes. Are you going over there? Is he coming over here? Or are you going to meet in the middle? He works in Ogilvies department store in Chicago. Oh, well? Well, as soon as he makes enough to send for me or I make enough to go over there, we're going to be married. That's fine. - You... You don't mind do you? - Mind what? My getting married. I should love to go out with you again, I had an awfully good time. So did I. Of course I don't mind. Actually I'm kinda glad you're all tied up, now we can go out and have fun without any pressure. Can't we? Yes I guess so. Goodnight Anne. Goodnight Tom. Mr. Irving Klinger. We're ready with Mr. Edgar Klinger in London. Go ahead please. Hello! Hello! Ed this is Irv, how are you twinsie? Buzzing old boy. Simply buzzing. I got a fast note by airmail from Tombo this morning. He says everything is terrif. Well, that is good news. Tell me have you heard from Tom? No. How are things? Absolutely superb. We should have a fantastic opening night tomorrow night. Fantastic. What about Ellen? Tom having trouble keeping her caged up at night? Oh no. Quite the contrary, she's been frightfully conscientious. Goes straight home from the theatre each night. Tom's the one who's been romping about. Tom? No kidding. What did he do, catch himself a chick? No. No. No. Tom's quite well. He's taken a fancy to some girl in the show. Pretty little thing she is too. Hey Eddie, call me after the opening, will you? The light in the window's gonna be me sitting and waiting. I will do old boy. Don't give it a second thought. By the by, how's the Mater? Oh, Mom's fine. Oh splendid. Do give her a peck on the cheek for me. I gotcha. Dig you tomorrow night. Pip now. Pip Now? Dig you? (Crowds cheering) What's all the commotion about? Some regiment that hasn't paraded its finery in years. You can just feel the excitement growing! The wedding's only a week off! I wonder what the groom is doing this morning? Well why don't you call him and ask him? Very funny. Well I thought it was. What time did you get in last night, lover boy? Around eleven I guess. I don't know, I didn't pay much attention. Well I did. It was around two. My! You're a busy little man these p. M's, aren't you? We were just having a few laughs. Just a few laughs? That's all. Ha. (Door buzzer) Come in! Morning. Johnny! What a pleasant surprise? - How are you? - Fine. - Hi John. - Hello Tom. I thought this was a good place to see the parade. We have a sensational view. Before I forget: Your ticket for the opening. Second row right on the aisle. Wonderful, thanks very much. What time is the parade? Should pass here any minute. Ellen, wonderful seeing you again, how's the show going? Just fine. Gee, it's been a long time. I know four days. (Noise of bagpipes) Tomorrow after the opening, Edgar's giving a party. You're going with me, OK. - OK. It'll take a little doing though. - Why? There's a huge affair being given, and I'm supposed to take someone. But you can get out of it, can't you? This is my opening night. Besides, if you don't take me, nobody will. (Sound of bagpipes, getting increasingly loud) I'll get out of it. You're looking so well these days. Thank you. I think about you so much. I think about you Ellen. What? I said I think about you. It's so different from anything I ever felt before. How? First of all, I'm not interested in anybody or anything I do. And that's completely new for me. Huh? (Shouting) I said that's completely new for me. Ellen, I think this is getting very serious. (Sounds of bagpipes fading) What a parade. I've never seen anything like it in my life. Parade? Oh it's over. Wait. I'll tell them to come back. Oh ignore him Johnny I'm so excited about tomorrow night. Come on girl we're due at the theatre, five minutes ago. Um. In a minute. Do you realise we've only Been out at night together, about three times since I've been here. Well. Come on, come on. Oh, Just a minute. What's that your playing Tom? The song she's supposed be rehearsing at the theatre, now. Oh why don't you rehearse it here? Oh, that's a good idea. Is that alright with you Tommy? Alright. I wake up and sigh each morning. Happy the night's gone by. I wake up and pray each morning. Pray that the day will fly. And then, I sit back and smile... and dream of that day... when I'll be standing by your side, my love. The happiest day of my life. How my heart will swell with pride, my love. The happiest day in a lifetime. Then, as the last words are spoken, the bells in the steeple will chime. And I will love you so, and you will see. It will be for a lifetime. Hold it. Hold it, please. Charlie what time is it? It's four a.m, Sir. Oh that's enough. Alright everybody that will be all for tonight. I'm sorry to keep you working so late. What about our last two numbers, Tom? We don't have to rehearse those. You were fine this afternoon. I thought so too. The show looks pretty good, doesn't it? Not bad. Anne! Yes? Don't forget tomorrow night. The opening, how could I? Oh yes, do try to make that we'd love to have you. I meant afterwards. Edgar's giving a party, we'll go together. Oh Tom I can't. You can't. Why not? Hal is calling. Oh that's right. I forgot all about him. Well it doesn't matter. I wouldn't bother, except I haven't heard from him for such a long time now, and I do have to talk to him. Taking the bus home tonight Anne? I'll be right with you. Sorry Tom. Oh, that's alright. (Male voice) What time tomorrow Sir? Three o'clock for the company. Eleven for Miss Bowen and me. Eleven?! What for, Tom? I want to take those two numbers we didn't do tonight. I thought you were satisfied with them. There's still a few rough spots. What happened to you? Did you get stood up? What are you talking about? My! What a manic depressive life you lead. It's going to be a marvellous party tomorrow night. I'm going with John. Who are you taking? (Humming) Every night at seven... Dum dum dum. Da de di dum de dum dem. - Where's the key? - Well you have it. I have not. I gave it to you. I'll suppose I'll have to go all the way down to the desk and... See, if you think nice things, all doors open to you. Is that your message for the day? Flowers! For me. I wonder who they're from. Not from me. Oh, well that I know. Who? It's from John. Can't make the opening. He can't? My! What a shame! I had a feeling this morning he wouldn't be able to make it, but he just didn't know how to tell me. Isn't that terrible? Now isn't that terrible? He's weak and I just hate weak people. Yes dear, I know you do. Up one minute, down the next. What a manic-depressive life you lead. Alright, alright, so we're even. Who are you going with tomorrow night? I don't know. Why don't you take me? I think we should go together anyway. After all, we're the stars of the show. Yes I think we should... Miss Bowen may I escort you to Klinger's clambake tomorrow night? Why, I'd be delighted, and what a surprise you're asking me. Oh Tommy, let's be terrific tomorrow night. - We'll be cosmic. - Stupendous. A smash! We hope. And Ellen, don't forget that's still the most important thing. Yes Tommy, I know it is. Goodnight. Goodnight. (Overlapping dialogue) - Oh yeah, yeah. - You listen to me just once. - Oh sure. - I've told you a million times. You never want to listen to me. Yeah. So I said it. So you heard it. So what? So this. It's the last time I'll ever go to a party with you. Will you put that in writing? Well you're always making cracks. Like what? Well you're always humiliating me. Didn't your mother never teach you no manners? I never had no mother, we was too poor. Say what's the matter with you lately? You used to tell me you loved me. You used to treat me like a high-class dame. Well, usedn't you? - So I used. - So there you admit it. I ain't admitting nothing. I'll give you one more chance. Do you love me or don't you? No I don't. Quit stalling. I want a direct answer. There's one thing about you I can't understand. (Starts singing) How could you believe me when I said I love ya? When you know I've been a liar all my life. You've had that reputation since you was a youth. You must have been insane to think I'd tell you the truth. How could I believe you when ya said we'd marry? Well, you know I'd rather hang than have a wife. I know I said I'd make you mine. Now wouldn't you's know that I would go for that old line. How could you believe me when I said I love you? When you know I've been a liar. You sure have been a liar. A double-crossing liar. A double-crossing liar. All my doggone cheating life. You said you would love me long. So what? And never would do me wrong. Stop bending the suit. Faithful you'd always be. Me? Why baby you must be loony to trust a lower than low two-timer like me. You said I'd have everything. Get her. A beautiful diamond ring. Ha. Ha. Ha. A bungalow by the sea. A bungalow yet. You're really naive to ever believe a full of baloney phony like me. Why, I should have just lost my head. You ain't lost nothing you never had. What about the time you went to Indiana? I was lying I was down in Ala-bam. You said you had some business you had to complete. What I was doing I would be a cad to repeat. What about the evening's you was with your mother? I was romping with another honey-lamb. To think you swore our love was real. Baby leave us not forget that I am a heal. How could I believe you when you said you loved me? Why, you know I've been a liar? A good for nothing liar. All my good for nothing life. (Music goes mad) You know you've been a liar. I know I've been a liar. A double-crossing liar. A double-crossing liar. All your good-for-nothing life. (Applause) Johnny! Darling I just had to come. I just had to. - Who's that with Ellen? - Who? - The chap with the accent. - Him? - Yes. - Brindale. Aah. They've become very good friends. Oh yes. Don't you think we should be getting over to Edgar's? Later Johnny. Tonight's my night and tonight I want to be alone with you. When you didn't show up at the opening, I didn't even feel like going on. How'd you get away from your party? Oh I just walked out. I couldn't stand not being with you tonight. Ellen, Ellen, I think we're in love. Yes darling I know. Well what are we going to do about it? Nothing. Well we can't go on in this indefinite state. Well aren't you happy? Oh you know I am. So am I, let's not kill it with improvement now. But something might happen. Like what? Well, some day, you might look over my shoulder and see someone else. Someone else? Yes. (Starts singing) Too late now to forget your smile. The way we cling when we dance awhile. Too late now to forget and go on to someone new. Too late now to forget your voice. The way one word makes my heart rejoice. Too late now to imagine myself away from you. All the things we've done together. I relive when we're apart. All the tender fun together stays on in my heart. How could I ever close the door and be the same as I was before. Darling. No, no I can't anymore. It's too late now. (Johnny whistling the tune) - Does Tom know how you feel? - Oh goodness no. Do you think he'd mind? Well, I imagine if he ever found out he'd get us a booking some place in South Africa, just to get me away from you. Would you forget about me in South Africa? Well how could I? (Starts singing) All the things we've done together, I relive when we're apart. All the tender fun together stays on in my heart. How could I ever close the door? And be the same as I was before. Darling no, no I can't anymore. It's too late now. (Rattle on door) Who is it? It's me Jamie, Tom. Tommy me boy, come in. You all closed up for the night? Well, it's after two. But I never close for you Tommy boy. Thanks. The show went well? Fine! I didn't feel like going home straight after the party so I thought I'd stop by and say hello. Well you're just in time. It was announced we go to see the presents on Monday. Thanks. I was just about to try on me suit for the Palace. I'll slip into it. You have a look, then you can tell me what you think? Sure. Oh by the way, isn't this Anne's night to visit you? Yes, she was by about an hour ago. Picked up her money and stole away like a pickpocket. Did her call come through from Chicago? Naw! The bloomin' blighter never called. She must be upset? Well I couldn't say. I don't know how Anne feels about anything. She's not an easy one to get to know. Very quiet she is, but deep. At least I hope she is deep, or else she's wasting a lot of her time being quiet. Well, brace yourself. What do you think? Do I look like a gentleman? Jamie, you look like a banker. - But do I look like a gentleman? - It's written all over you. I got it this afternoon from Percy Munro. Last year, when he got pneumonia, they bought it for him to be buried in. But he recovered. My only advice is, if you meet the Royal Family, I wouldn't bow too low. Remember this is a wedding, not a coming out party. I see what you mean. I'll watch it. Are you excited? Excited. No, I'm just scared. Nervous and scared. Why? It's meeting the old crow again. I haven't clapped eyes on her in three years. I know. It's funny, if it wasn't for this Royal Wedding, probably I'd never cross her path again. I tell you what. On Monday, I'll call for you and take you down to meet her. I'll give you moral support. That's nice of you, Tommy. Unusually nice of you. You're a good man you are. I don't know what Annie's doing waiting for this knucklehead in Chicago when she knows a fellow like you here in town. That's love Jamie. What about you? Do I look like the settling down kind? Come on let me out. Oops. I'll do the bending, I'm dressed for it. Thank you Tommy. Goodnight pal. Goodnight buddy. (Tommy voice-over in song) Everywhere that beauty glows you are. Everywhere an orchid grows you are. Everything that's young and gay. Brighter than a holiday. Everywhere the angels play you are. You're like Paris in April and May. You're New York on a silvery day. A Swiss Alp as the sun grows fainter. You're Loch Lomond when autumn is the painter. You're moonlight on a night in Capri. And Cape Cod looking out at the sea. You're all places that leave me breathless. And no wonder, you're all the world to me. (Singing) Every night at seven. Dum de Dem. (Ellen) Come in! - Morning. - Oh hello Edgar. Absolutely fantastic notices, everyone. You could stay on for years. Have you seen the dailies? - Rather! - Oh, we're so thrilled. There's been an eight-week call at the libraries. There's been a what? At the what? The libraries, old boy. That's what we call our ticket brokers. They want block of seats eight weeks in advance. Why didn't you say so? Oh Tom, did you see the one where they say we're brilliant? Where? Oh Edgar have you called Irving yet? - I'm off to the office now. (Phone rings) I'll take it in my room. Edgar, sit down a sec, will you? I want you to do a favour for me. At your command old boy. When you call Irving, ask him to find out what happened to a boy who used to work at Ogilvies Department Store in Chicago. His name is, er, Hal Rayton. I've written it all down. - Oh, right you are. - Will you do that? And don't say anything to anybody about it. Will ya? It shall be graveyard old boy. Graveyard. - Thanks. - Cheerio! This is New York. We're ready in London. Mr. Irving Klinger is on the line. Hello. Hello. Irving there. Edgar here. - Hey Eddie, so how are things? - Buzzin' right along. Smash huh. So how are the notices? Wizard old boy, wizard! - That bad, huh? - No. No. No. Wizard, wizard. Oh! Wizard. Yes. Now look, Tom wants you to follow up on a chap named Hal Rayton. Hal Rayton, huh. What does he do a single? Mr. Rayton is not in the theatrical profession. He ain't in the theatre, so who needs him? It's a personal matter of Tom's. When last heard from, Mr. Rayton was employed at Ogilvies department store in Chicago. Ogilvies. Dig ya. I'll throw the hassle to our Chicago branch. Have the whole mess in your lap in a fast two days. No, no, that won't be necessary. Just follow up on the Rayton matter and let us know. Nadge. I just said: Pip now! Oh. Oh yes, er er... Dig you! Oh, there's Jamie for you. Wouldn't you know he'd be late? Even to the Palace. Now take it easy, Mother, maybe the traffic was heavy. It's not the traffic, it's Jamie. Ever since I told him I don't like to be kept waiting, he's been keeping me waiting. You know Mother, there's an old Spanish proverb which goes: He who doesn't love the faults of his loved one doesn't love at all. That may be well and good for the Spanish, but I'm English. - Do you know what I think? - No dearie. I think he's excited about seeing you. - Do you think so? - Mm... - How do I look? - As elegant as can be. Tommy, tell him he's going too fast. - Driver, could you slow down a little? - Yes Sir. What if we stopped to have a quick one, to the health of the Royal Couple? Sit back Jamie, we're not stopping anywhere. - Tell him to go a little slower. - He can't. Don't be so nervous. When you see her, be sure you act like the gentleman you look like. I will. But if she says one word of criticism, I'll hit her on the head with this cap. You'll do nothing of the kind. Here we are, stop here driver. Walk the rest of the way. Go on now, don't lose your nerve. Get in there. Go on. Hello Jamie. Good-day Sarah. Jamie, your suit's handsome, handsome. Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late. The traffic was heavy today. I told the cabby to go as fast as he could. - Shall we go? - Allow me. Jamie don't. I knew the code. There are some days when you can do nothing wrong. - Do you think they'll stay together? - Sure. I hope so. For them as well as for me. I could never have left Mother alone. Now you can get married and forget about it. Yes... (Knock on door) Yeah. - Good evening. - Edgar! I have the information you require regarding Mr. Rayton. Oh, what? Oh it's nothing terribly exciting. Mr. Rayton still works at Ogilvies. He's still in the luggage department. He used to live in Chicago proper, but not long ago, he and his wife moved to Evanston. His wife? Why yes, he was married several months ago. My, my, my! I say, who is this chap anyway? He was engaged to a girl in the show. I was just finding out about him for her. - Oh I say that's frightful. - Yes isn't it. Well, what are you so pleased about? I always smile when I'm heartbroken. I'd better tell her. Oh no, not now. Don't you think you should wait until after the performance? It would seem kinder. Maybe you're right. Edgar, you're a real pal. I'd stick up for you anytime. Thanks old chap, that's frightfully decent of you to say. Well, if you'll excuse me. Oh, I shall be around to pick you up early tomorrow morning. - What's tomorrow? - Why the Royal Wedding. And I shall take you some place where you'll see all the pageantry. Great. (Male voice) Second act Mr. Bowen! I left my hat in Haiti. In some forgotten flat in Haiti. I couldn't tell you how I got there. I only know it was so hot there. She took my hat politely. And wound her arms around me tightly. But I remember nothing clearly. Except the flame when she came near me. Her eyes had the fire of surrender. And her touch, it was tender. And I guess in the moment as that, you'd forget about your hat. So if you go to Haiti, there is a girl I know in Haiti. If you can find her you'll adore her. Just look around till you find someone who has a blue grey fedora. I think of that gorgeous creature when I'm all alone. Whenever I do, from down inside there comes a groan. That son of a gun in Haiti has got the prettiest hat I own. When it's bleak and chilly and life is flat. I think of that Haitian dilly. And think I'd better go get my hat. I left my hat in Haiti. In some forgotten flat in Haiti. I couldn't tell you how I got there. I only know it was so hot there. But I remember nothing clearly. Except the flame when she came near me. (Chorus) Her eyes had the fire of surrender. And her touch, it was tender. And I guess in a moment as that. You'd forget about your hat. So if you go to Haiti. There is a girl I know in Haiti. If you can find her you'll adore her. Just look around and you'll find someone who has a blue-grey fedora. (Applause) Ellen! Ellen, got anybody to take you home? Good. - Goodnight Mr. Bowen. - Goodnight. Anne, I've something to tell you. Yes. I hope you won't think I've butted in where I shouldn't have. But Jamie told me your friend didn't call. Oh? I didn't ask. He told me. I don't quite know why I did it but I decided to try and find out what happened to him. Did you? Yes I did. Well? Anne, he's married. Married? I'm sorry. How wonderful, how simply wonderful. Oh Tom, thank you. Oh it was nothing... Anne... I've been worrying myself to death over him on account of you and he's been married all the time. Isn't it wonderful? What do you mean on account of me? On account of me being in love with you and you being in love with me. I'm in love with you? Well aren't you? Yeah. What a mess. The next thing that happens, we'll be thinking about getting married. I'm thinking about it right now. There you see. Well, don't you want to marry me? Yes I do. Anne, it isn't you it's marriage. I'm afraid I couldn't be married and make a go of it. I've been living one way too long. For me it's always been work. Everything else has just been a side issue. It isn't because I don't want to, it's just that I... I don't know if I could change. Anne, I'll know I'll be an awful flop as a husband. Do you understand? I think I do Tom. What'll we do? Perhaps you'd better take me home. Tom, I only disagree with one thing. What's that? I think you'll make a marvellous husband. You do? Yes I do Tom. Hi. Hi. You're back early. It isn't early. I thought it was. Well it isn't. It's late. Is it? Hm? I didn't say anything. Tom, John wants to marry me. He does? That's funny. It might be to you, but it's terribly serious to him. He's very much in love with me. He says he's found a new faith, and everything. All on account of me. How do you feel? Well, very constructive. I never thought I'd see the day you'd inspire anybody to do anything but slug it out. Alright, go ahead make fun of me. I'm sorry Ellie. You really are involved this time, aren't you? Up to here. - What are you going to do? - I don't know. I was hoping you'd make up my mind for me, like you usually do. It sure is funny. Why do you keep saying that? When it isn't funny at all. It's very important. I know it is. I only meant it's funny because Anne wants me to marry her. She does? My gosh, it sure is funny, isn't it? Why? I don't know. It's just funny that's all. What's so funny about someone wanting to marry me? I have a few good points you know. Tommy, are you really in love with her? Up to here. I wonder what would happen if we just threw over all our principles and got married anyway. You'll stay here in England with John? Why would I stay here? You can't go traipsing all over the world and leave your husband at home. What kind of a marriage would that be? No, I suppose not. Well, what would you do? - I'd marry Anne and... - I mean who would you dance with? I never thought of that, I might try Anne, if she wants to, she loves to dance and shows a lot of promise. - Do you really think so? - Yeah. I thought she was a little awkward myself. So were you when you started. I know it but it takes years to build a good team. You've always said that. And there's a lot of excitement in doing it. - It just isn't fair Tommy. - What isn't? I'm getting the short end of the stick. What? You want me to settle back and get out of the way, while you go off with someone and have all of the fun. I think it's rotten of you, Tommy. I didn't ask you to... Everything's been so perfect, we've had a wonderful life together. We've been very successful. How can you even consider breaking it up? And for what, to get married? Oh no Tom, marriage is a tough business. You know what I've always thought of marriage. Responsibilities. Obligations. A home to take care of. Maybe children to look after. Imagine being married to someone you're dancing with. If either the marriage or the dancing doesn't work out both of them go kabooey. No, Thomas, it's a terrible chance to take. It is, isn't it? We mustn't do it. We've slaved too hard to get where we are. Why should we give it up? It does seem foolish, doesn't it? We're a team and a darn good one, we ought to stay that way. Maybe you're right. Of course I'm right. You do see it, don't you Tommy? Sure I see it. It's you and me just like it's always been. I'm sure we're doing the right thing. Thank you so much for deciding for me. Forget it. (Children singing) What a lovely day for a wedding. Happy are we to say. It's a lovely day for a wedding. Lovely in every way. The sun is out, the flower is out. To see what all the joy's about. For everywhere the world is merry and gay. What a lovely day for a wedding. Over again we say. It's a lovely lovely lovely wedding day. (Singing) What a lovely day for a wedding. Happy are we to say. It's a lovely day for a wedding. Lovely in every way. The Royal Guard is Scotland Yard. Big Ben the time of the day. What a lovely day for a wedding. Over again we say. - It's a lovely, lovely wedding. - A lovely, lovely wedding. - Lovely. - Lovely. - Lovely. - Lovely. Wedding day! - Hello. - Good morning old chappie. - Hello Edgar. - Good morning. I've come to take you to the wedding and what a wedding parade we shall see. - Are you ready? - As ready as I'll ever be. What's the matter with you two this morning? You all at sixes and sevens. Nothing's the matter. Let's go. - Tom... - Ellie I've got to have her. I lose. So do I. I want to get married today! Today? Yes, before I change my mind. Do you think we can do it? Edgar, we want to get married. I thought you two were related. Oh no, no... And we want to get married today. But it takes three weeks. Three weeks! Anything can happen in three weeks. - You can fix it for us Edgar. - Irving says you can do anything. I know, but one must have permission from the Archbishop's office. After all, he's busy today. You've got to swing it for us Edgar. I'll try. You two meet me at the Vicar General's in two hours. If it's at all possible to get a licence, you shall be married this afternoon. Where, where? Clyde Street Church. I believe I know the minister there. This is pretty box of pickles. I beg your pardon Sir. - Now what can we do? - We have to find Anne and John. In these crowds? I know what corner she's standing on. Where's John? Should be leaving the Abbey for the reception any minute now. You'd better find him. Ellen, I'm going to miss you a lot from now on. Tommy, you're a wonderful brother. Good luck, darling. Thanks, Tommy. Excuse me, excuse me. Will you excuse me. John! - Ellen, what's the matter? - John I want to marry you. - What? - I said I want to marry you. You do? Yes, meet me at Clyde Street church at four o'clock. Right. What do you think you're doing miss? Oh officer, I love you. Anne! Anne! Tom! - Will you marry me? - What? - Will you marry me? - Yes. They didn't have to go to all this trouble, a small wedding would've been alright.
