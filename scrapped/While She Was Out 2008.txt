What's the matter? What's the matter? Honey, you want to tell me what it is you do all day? - What do you mean? - Well... Honey, look at the goddamn place. There's kid-shit all over the place, wall to wall. We do the best we can. The best you can? Why don't you just do what I tell you to do? - Stop. - Tell me. What happened to you? - Stop. - You should put yourself together. What do you want me to say? We've got kids. I don't want you to say anything. Just to keep the house clean! God. - Terry got an "A" in math. - Goddamn it, Della! - Don't what? - That's her favorite doll. - What? - You'll have to fix her. I'll have to what? - You'll have to fix her. - I'll have to what? You'll have... That's all you worry about. The kids. I'll have to what? Would you look at me when I'm talking to you? Stop it! Why don't you stop it? Don't tell me what to do! - Stop it. - You understand me? You understand what I'm saying? Don't break my arm. Don't tell me what to do! Why do you make me do this every fucking time? What are we supposed to do now? I'm out... of wrapping paper. It's okay. Come on, it's okay. It's okay. How are you doing? I want a Nintendo Wii for Christmas, mom. It's only a few hours till Christmas. - Can I get an American Girl doll? - Guys. You wrote your letters to Santa. I don't think another letter will make it to the North Pole. - We're going to be okay? - We're always okay. We're always okay. - No matter what happens. - No matter what happens. - I'll be back in a while, okay? - Okay. Now, promise me one thing. Listen. You, you. You have to brush your teeth. And I want you in the bed after your treat, all right? I'll see you later. Mom! I made a secret drawing for you. - I love your drawings. - Don't look at it yet! Okay. I'll save it for later. How about that? Bye, sweetie. And you can kiss my ass, Kenneth. Cellular 411 connect. How may I direct your call? - Spring Street Learning Academy. - Hold, while I connect you. Thank you for using Learning Academy. Meghan speaking. Hi, Meghan. It's Della Myers. Hi. Are you calling about Spanish? It's been cancelled. I knew about that. It's about next week's mechanics class. Would you pass on to Mike that I won't be there this time? No problem. - I'll make sure he gets that. - Great. - Hi. Della? - What's up, Cassie? I'm over at the mall. What is it we need to get for Pilates? One of those rubber bands. I'm headed over there myself. Do yourself a favor. Turn around. It's hell over here. My cell's dying. You know... damn! I left the charger in the other car. Silly you. Let me pick you up something. Save you the trip. - I mean... - Are you sure? No, it's okay. Cassie, can we meet for a drink? You still there? Your phone is breaking up. Damn. You're kidding me. My God! Damn it! Damn! Come on. You think you're going to take my spot, think again! I've been waiting for 3o minutes! It's Christmas! Excuse me. Where can I find a parking space? This is ridiculous! Ma'am, there is absolutely nothing close by. Even the valet's backed up. - You should try further out. - Where? Over there? Now, please keep moving. Let's go. Go! Come on! Jerk! What a jerk! Over there. Smile. Good girl. Merry Christmas! - Would you like Chanel No. 5? - No, thank you. Can I help you with that? I was just looking. Thank you. Hi. Could I have a hot tea, please? And one chocolate biscotti. Milk or dark chocolate? No, just the tea. Name? Della. Two "L"s. US$2.65. Thank you. Della? Is that you? Lynn? Lynn Monroe. - Hi. - I haven't seen you since college! Right. You married that handsome jock and we never heard from you again. You live around here? We just bought this divine house in Pleasant Valley. You know it? Yes, I do. It's perfect for the kids. They practically walk to school. We've got a great backyard. We're thinking of putting a pool in it. They'll love that! Enough of me. How are you? Fine. I have two children, Terry and Tammi. Twins. We're celebrating tonight. David's been promoted. I had to buy this gorgeous black teddy. It is. It's gorgeous. - It's been nice talking to you. - You too. I've got to get my hair done. See you later. See you. Mitch! How are you? - Which one would you like? - That one. That one? This one? That's the one? - Thanks. - Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! Hello. US$21.69, please. - There you go. - Thank you. I'm sorry. It's been declined. Do you have another card? No, I don't. Seventeen... twenty-one... There. It's Christmas Eve, and the mall is now closed. Happy Holidays, everyone. This day is borne a Savior Of a pure, virgin bride To free all who trust in Him From Satan's power and might Oh, tidings of comfort and joy Oh, tidings Of comfort and joy Shit. Shit. What now? Excuse me? I've got a gun. How's about I aim it at your pussy? Why don't you back your car up? That's not going to happen. What are you doing? I don't know this game. Trust me, it's not a game. How about you shut up, and eat a dick? When you get done, we're going to staple your mouth shut. Right, Chuckie? "Chuckie"? Is that for real? At least your parents have a sense of humor. I don't have any parents. I named myself. Do you have a beef with us, honey? Because slipping a note underneath my wipers... is an invitation to war to me and my soldiers. If you hadn't have parked like an asshole... we wouldn't be standing here. - Watch your mouth! - Get away from me! You're just digging your grave deeper. - Where you going? - Fuck you! - Fuck you. - No, fuck you! Any trouble here, ma'am? Not if these punks move their car! What's the deal, Barney Fife? Okay, boys. Back your car up and let the lady out. How does that sound, squirt? We're not in the mood. In fact... mind your fucking business, and go direct some traffic. I'm going to make this my business. Now, why don't you pile back into your piece-of-shit car... and get the fuck out of my mall? Did you hear what I said? Did you hear me? Did you hear me, daddy? Get out of here! - Put the gun down. - Get out of here! - Put the gun down! - I said, get out of here! - Put the gun down! - You want me to put it down? Make me, bitch! I said... - Shit. - Motherfucker. She's getting away! Fuck, man! She's probably on the phone with 5-o already! - We're going to go down for this! - Don't worry about it, nigga. Don't call me "nigga". You ain't the right. None of you. Take it easy, Huey. Take it easy. We got this. The world is our bitch. Get in the car. Now. Move over, Tomas! Come on! - The cop went down hard. - Goddamn it, Tomas. Shut up! My God. Oh, God. Hell, no. - Damn! - What? My new Keds are all dirty! Get there and push! The car's got nowhere to go. The road ends there. There's nothing but houses and trees. Ditch the car, man. We've got a witness on the loose. Trust me. You won't hear a peep from her. She's going down, execution style. What if she's gone already? She's not gone. There's no place for her to go. Damn. She took out that barrier. It's going to be impossible to find her, even if she is around. Come on, guys. Maybe we can hotwire the truck. I'll find you now, cunt! We caught up in this like it's a soap opera. We need to blast out of town, act like we were never around. - Vingh, get over here. - How much "Kill" you been smoking? Come on, man. No one cares about a fucking Rent-A-Pig! He's just collateral damage to the people at the mall. She's the only witness! If we hit the road right now... w could be miles away before they find out. We could be swimming in the Atlantic, like you promised me. Huey, come here. Come here. Remember how I broke you out of that home? I was there for you, right? You trust me, right? Right? All we got to do is find her, and we're out of here. I promise. That's it. There's her Ford! Somebody tell her mom to lay out her black dress. Why? Is she dead? No, she went through her trunk. She's here. She's hiding somewhere. She left her purse. It's all in here. Her cell phone. Where are you? - Her battery gave out. - We're going to find you! There she is! Go that way! That way! Fuck! - You see her down there? - No, man. - She must have gone around. - She vanished. Check each one of these houses. Split up. Spread out! Della! We know who you are! You can't hide, honey. We're not going to give up till we find you. You're trapped, Della. We're going to find you! Where's Little Red Riding Hood? Where was that? Check the house next door! Move it! There she is! - We got you. - You're dead, bitch. Time to say goodbye. You hear that? Do you hear that? It's the sound of the waves! Sounds good, right? Yeah, Chuckie. It sounds great. Don't worry. When we're done with you, we'll send you back to mister... You want play nice? You want to play? Back off! Hold back! Give me a minute. I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry. You okay? Chill out. You all right? Settle down! Settle down! You all right? Settle down. You know how we know your name? You messed up, Della. You left your purse in the car. Give me that. Your photo doesn't do you justice. He is right. - You look better in person. - You do. You look good. You're not going to need it anymore. What's in that box, Della? What's in the box? What's in the box, girl? What's up? You think she's carrying some cash? Some jewelry or something? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe she cashed in her life savings. Plan on running away? Start a new life? That is it, Della? You got enough scratch to buy us off? Open the box. Open the box! - Open it! - Okay. Take the box. We're going to kill her anyway. I'll open the box. You know what? She ain't got nothing. Let's take that pussy and get going. I got her! Down there! Look out, Huey! - What the fuck, niggas? - Shut up! - Are you hurt? - I said, shut up! And don't use the N-word. You ain't representing. Huey? - What did you do? - What do you mean? Stop fucking around. Huey? - What's up, little brother? - Spare me, God. Quit fucking around. Huey? What's up? Fuck! Fuck! Come on, man. What the fuck did you do? Get off him! I didn't kill him. - You stepped on his face! - Don't touch me! - I didn't kill him! She did. - Get the fuck off! God! Huey! - I'm going to get that bitch! - You let her go! You piece of shit! Where the fuck is she? Fuck. Della! Della! Della! I guess you are right When we talked in the heat There's no room for the weak No room for the weak Where will it end? Where will it end? Where will it end? Where will it end? This is the room The start of it all They're talking to you I remember it all I've seen the night Filled with blood and pain And the bodies obtained And the bodies obtained And the bodies obtained What are you doing? It's a tribute. A gesture. Where will it end? That'll wake up every cop in Podunk county! It's for him. It's for Huey. I didn't mean it, Huey. What did you say? What? I didn't mean to kill him. Get away from him. Get the fuck away from him! Get the fuck away from him! Get away from him! Get away! Get away! - Get away! - Fuck you! I'm going to get you! Do you hear me, Della? I'm going to get you! God. MOMMY WE LOVE YOU Della! Della? Wait. It's "Bulgari". - What's "Bulgari"? - It's a perfume, dude. It smells more like that No. 5 shit. - "Chanel". - No, it's "Bulgari". My dad's bitch bathes in it. It's blood. It's her blood. Maybe she's hurt. This way. Go, go, go! Watch out, dude. Look out! Damn! - Shit! - What happened? I stepped in the stream! - That was raw. - Who cares, man? Nobody gives a shit if we live or die. Quit playing with the flashlight. We are stumbling in the dark! He who finds it, shines it. - Let's go! - Where the hell is she? - Shut up and move it! - Damn! Let's go, guys. There she is! Don't let her get away! Huey? Is that you, Huey? I saw him there in those trees! Sure you did. Son of a bitch! I'm going to get you, bitch! You will see! You fucking bitch! Son of a bitch! Time's up, you bitch. God! Tomas! Quiet. Tomas is gone. I can feel it. He's probably got her strung up by now. There's something over here. Looks like a body. It's a tree stump, you dumb wonton. Tomas... She's going to kill us too. We're all going to die here. No gun can kill a spirit gone bad. She's gone bad. She's gone bad. Gone bad. I'm going to get this girl. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Where are you, God? Where are you? All I want to do is see my babies! Where are you? Where are you? Fuck. Fuck, fuck! Over there, Chuckie! You're going down! Slow down, bitch. - Fuck. - Get of my way, Vingh! Get up! Get up! She's taking off! I don't feel good, Chuckie. I got hypothermia. You'll be fine. It ain't natural how she gets away every time. Let's get this over with. You go up there. I'll cover you. I ain't going there without the gun. End of story. I never pegged you for a pussy. Even when Tomas called it, I always defended you. No one ever called me a pussy. She couldn't weight more than 12o. You could break her in half - Tomas never called me a pussy! - Fine. You don't want to go? Don't go. I'm going to get this bitch for Tomas. For Huey. You go up. I'm going to go around the side. No limits on power. No limits on power! Vingh? Della? Della? It's just you and me left now. I saw a trail of your blood back there. You must be hurt. I'm hurting, too. You busted my collarbone. I know you can hear me. I can smell your sweat. I can smell your blood. I know you're close. After what went down tonight, we got a special bond. You may come out now. Want a cigarette? I'll save one for you, for when you decide to come out. You are one tough bitch! And that is hot. They are really cute. Twins, huh? A woman's purse can tell her whole life story. Are you sure you don't want a cigarette now? Della? Honey? Now I know where they live. Maybe I'll stop by and say hi. I figured that'd help to find your voice. Don't worry. I wouldn't hurt them. It's wrong to hurt kids, right? The game's over, Della. You won. You took him from me, Della. He was like my little brother. All he wanted to do was see the ocean. But he never got to see it. No, he never got to go. They're all gone now. Let's see here. Monday, Pilates. Tuesday, Spanish. Wednesday, Mechanics? Thursday, Friday... Face it, Della. You're no suburban housewife. You bought into the big lie. You even tried to live it. Husband... house... security... every woman's dream. But not yours. You know there's no such thing as security. I reckon I know what you've been dreaming about. What you've been aching for... all these lonely years. The wind in your hair. The dirt of life between your fingers. Taking what you want from life. Right, Della? Don't tell me you haven't thought about it. It's in your blood. I bet your husband doesn't treat you right. Takes you for granted. You can't go back to that. You don't want to go back to that. Let's go pick up your kids. Right now. And we'll get rid of him. You can do it. I can do it. It's okay. Come here. Hell of a night, huh? Close your eyes. Close your eyes. You're amazing, Della. So beautiful. You've been a bad girl. You're a bad girl. Fuck me. Fuck me. You can count on me Please have snow and mistletoe And presents under the tree Christmas Eve will find me Where the love light gleams I'll be home for Christmas If only in my Dreams You want to tell me where you've been all night, honey? Don't ever call me that again. What? You can't even take your shoes off at the door? The Japanese do it! I do it. I see you got the paper. What'd you get me? What did you get me at the mall? Nothing. In every dream home A heartache And every step I take Takes me further from heaven Is there a heaven? I'd like to think so Standards of living They're rising daily But home, oh, sweet home It's only a saying From bell-push to faucet In smart-town apartments The cottage is pretty The main house a palace Penthouse perfection But what goes on? What to do there? Better pray there Open-plan living Bungalow ranch-style All of its comforts Seem so essential I bought you mail order My plain-wrapper baby Your skin is like vinyl The perfect companion You float in my new pool Deluxe and delightful Inflatable doll My role is to serve you Disposable darling Can't throw you away now Immortal and life-size My breath is inside you I'll dress you up daily And keep you till death sighs Inflatable doll Lover ungrateful I blew up your body But you blew my mind Oh, honey Dream home heartaches Oh, honey Dream home heartaches Oh, honey Dream home heartaches
