Well, I thought you were away for seven years and it would be a nice change for you to be in a beautiful place in Moscow. Thank you. Seven years is such a long time for a small case you had there. I hope French prisons are not as bad I hear. I understand you appreciate fine art. Yes. The city is now a major creative center of the world. You make an excellent tour guide. I took over the department two years ago from Inspector Dassaiev. - He retired. - He was a good guy. - Send him my best regards. - I will. I would love for you to come and visit our facilities. The new Moscow Police is very high tech, new methods. I am, however, working on a very old case. You see, a major modern art painting was stolen 10 years ago from the Museum of Modern Art. It was never recovered. So I thought perhaps you could be of some assistance of helping us to find it. I am an old school kind of guy. So I'm afraid I won't be of much help... with your high tech investigation. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of that. Let's give it a try. Sure. Look... My son was killed a few months ago. He had a girlfriend. I just came to collect his things. I know... and I am sorry for your loss. Listen, you have my number. Call me tomorrow to set up the time. This old case needs closure. It was good talking to you. Souliman. What's happened? Your son, I raised him for seven years. He was great for years. Then two years ago, when he dropped from university... he changed, Viktor. Got the wrong friends. Started to get into trouble. What kind of trouble? Drugs. Drugs. I forced him into a rehab center. For a while he got better. So I took him back to Grozny. I wanted him to help me run the ballet company. You know, with bookings and stuff. He did very well for few months. But then a year ago, he moved back to Moscow. Met a girl. - What do you know about her? - Katerina. She's a good girl. She's an artist, a photographer. She came here a few times for dinner with him. Jeremie came to see to me the day before he was killed, Viktor. He was very upset because Katerina left him. I tried to talk to him but he's like you, Viktor. He doesn't say much. He kept everything to himself. And then... no one knows what happened. No one? No one, Viktor. No one. The police couldn't find anything. I am his father. And I wasn't here. Hello. - I am... - Yeah, I know. I know who you are. The police, they've already been here. They left your picture and asked me to call them if you contact me. May I... May I come in? - Sure. - Thank you. It's the day we met. It's a wonderful picture. Did you love my son? He had the same smile as when he was a baby. Why did you leave him? Because he lied to me. I know about your family. I know about you. Jeremie promised me that he would stay out of troubles. That he wouldn't touch drugs anymore. But then he became obsessed with making money. One day he came back to the house with a lot of cash. I knew he was involved with something illegal. I don't want that in my life. We argued and I left him. Listen, I haven't talked to anyone. I haven't talked to the police. So please. Go now. Who got him into drugs? Please. Tell me. A guy... named Vasily. Was his dealer. He's bartender at Takiv Circle. He's the one who got him into drugs. That's all I know. Please. I am Jeremie's father. You knew Jeremie. I understand you're the one that got my son into drugs. So... Listen to me. Explain to me... why my son is dead. And who killed him. And you are going to tell me the truth. And you know why? Because if you lie to me... I will kill your whole family. I don't know anything. I swear! Jeremie was like a brother to me. No. No! No. No. What were you thinking? What were you thinking, babe? And this? In your wallet. - What's this? - I don't touch coke anymore. Hurry up! - Please. - Who was Jeremie in business with? I don't want to die! No! Stop! No! - Who was Jeremie in business with? - Claudio Martelli. He's an Italian lawyer. He spends half of the year in Moscow. I know him because I gave him girls all the time. We became friends. Jeremie wanted to make some money. I introduced him to Martelli. He got him a job. Please... please. I'm sorry, kid. I'm not the boss. You are on your own. - Doing what? - Moving diamonds for one of his clients. - Which client? - I don't know. You can kill me but I swear, I don't know Jeremie wouldn't tell me. I swear. Please have pity. Please! - Pity. - Please. Clean up your mess. It is always a pity for me... to sell them. How was your trip, Mr. Hayak? Good, thank you. I was just a boy when I found my first... emerald back home in Ural. But it was... the most intense moment of my life. My client deposited the money in the trust account. Good. You know why I sell them? So I can get more of them. Did you bring the paperwork? I set up the trust in Zurich, per your instructions. Sign here, please. I'm sure I don't need to tell you... about the needs of complete discretion. I wouldn't want the government to find out about my operation. As your trustee, I am bound by total secrecy. Okay. Aren't you forgetting something? If you want your leg to be better... you have to be stronger than the pain. Put the cane on the table! Good. That's better! She's upset with me because... I broke her knee. You're nervous. Don't be. You still look good. - I will go and get your waitress. - Thank you. Hello, Viktor. Hello, Alexandra. Our song. Pure coincidence. Let's sit. Viktor Lambert is back. Chteau Margaux for Mr. Lambert. Thank you. So... the guy you asked me to check out. Martelli. He's an international attorney from Italy. He has several big clients in Moscow, especially in the diamond industry. He's a party animal and he loves the ladies. That's all I found out so far. But he's gonna be here in a few minutes, okay? Thank you. Come on, Souliman. Let's go and tell each other stories at the bar. Mr. Viktor? Pleasure to meet you. Please have a seat. Excellent choice. Please. It's my weakness. - Do you mind if I smoke? - Please. Is this your first visit to Moscow? I've been here before. But it has been a long time. A very long time. Good. I must say... your call intrigued me. I am told you have several clients in the diamond industry. That fake certificates from Los Angeles should interest some of your clients, hopefully. You know my clients are very cautious about who they do business with. I only want to deal with one of your clients. Only one of my clients. Now you really intrigue me. One client. My name is Viktor Lambert. Jeremie was my son. He contacted you six months ago. You had him working for one of your clients, moving diamonds. I don't know any Jeremie. And this meeting is over. Take my cell number. Talk to your client. Tell him to call me. I advise you to return to France, Mr. Lambert. Perhaps I will. But I will kill all of you. Now go. Viktor, we are being followed. Probably cops. Two cars behind. Drop me off when you can. Boss. Did he mention my name? - No. - Well... You do have a lot of clients. A lot of clients. That's all you have to say? This guy is crazy. You should have seen his eyes. Don't forget... that it's you... who introduced me to that kid. You were looking for a smuggler. I never would have imagined you were going to... Shut up! You could say something stupid. Dmitry? What do you know about this kid? You see? Dmitry, check it out and take care of it. This is nothing. Go back to your office and don't worry yourself, Claudio. We'll find out who that Viktor Lambert is and make him understand that he is out of his league. Good. One more thing... I received a necklace for your client from Dubai. Two point five million dollars. So don't get nervous on me and stay focused on business. Sure. I'll call him and tell him it's ready. I asked you to leave me alone. Thank you for coming. I have a... I have to talk to you. I need to ask you something. Did Jeremie mention... Stop. I don't want to know anything. You don't want to know? You don't want to know? My son is dead! All of this, it doesn't concern me anymore. Because I'm leaving Moscow. Why are you leaving Moscow? Why are you leaving Moscow? Why? You don't know what his death means to me. I'm leaving to forget, okay? - Wh-who was he working for? - Leave me alone, please! Katerina. Katerina. I waited seven years to see my son and he's killed three months before I get out of prison. He told you what I'm like. You know I won't stop! Please tell me everything you know and I promise, I promise, you will never hear from me again. He didn't tell me anything. One day he came back home with a million rubles in cash. I knew he was doing something wrong and I told him I was leaving. He promised to me that he would quit everything. Listen, that's all I know. - Please... - No, don't do this. - Please leave me alone. - No, come on. Tell me. Listen. I can't! I'm pregnant! Inspector Plutova. Always a pleasure. I heard the past has returned. The past always catches up with you, Anna. You know that. That's the last thing you need, Alexandra. If I were you... I would give him some sage advice. Advice? To Viktor Lambert? Why don't you go ahead and do it yourself? Oh, no, actually he just left. Don't play games with me. Make sure... you give him a message to call me. This is your concept of hiding? The police are looking for you. We may as well hide out in the best place. You grew up. I just know Moscow. So... Grandfather. Grandfather. - Life is crazy. - This is a second chance for you. Forget. They killed my son. I don't mean that. They'll kill you. You know me. I am what I am, Alexandra... and I'm not going to change now. I loved your son, too. He came to see me every month. I hate that I didn't see him going down. I didn't see the signs. I feel guilty. I think about it every night. In prison... the only thing that kept me strong was to think of you both. Him... and you. You never answered my letters. Plutova. She won't let you go. She's young, but she's a good cop. Please, give back that painting. You've got everything you need here. With me. Alexandra... I missed you. Souliman? What? I'm sorry. Somebody kept calling me at home. When I pick up, nobody was there. I panicked. I ran away. Okay. Come on. Bye. Go down, Katerina! Get down! Katerina, get down! Go down! Get down! Run. Run! Youri's my old bartender. I'm sorry, I... I need to be alone for a few minutes. Souliman... you have to stay here to protect her. And I let you go to war alone? Why do you even ask me to do such a thing? Don't worry. She's safe here. Nobody comes here. Maybe we should go home for a while, until things cool off. He's right. The cops are gonna be looking for you. I think this is time for you to go to Grozny to see your son's grave. I need to tell you something. My wife died... when Jeremie was born. The last time I saw my son he was 15 years old... and I was going into prison. I wish that... he could have lived another life than mine. But you see... we don't stop paying for our mistakes. I want you to stay here for a couple of days. I have to finish what I started. After that you can do what you want. Leave Moscow if you still want to. I will give you money so your baby never wants for anything. Please. In memory of Jeremie. I miss him so much. I told you... this guy is crazy. Call this Lambert. I want to all to him... before this fiasco really gets out of hand and... before we've got all the cops in Moscow on red alert... because of this fuck up! Dial number! Mr. Lambert... it's Martelli. I hope I am not disturbing you. I'm with my client. He wishes to speak to you. Mr. Lambert, I understand you asked my attorney to call you. I suggest we meet. I just wanted you to hear the voice of the man who's going to kill you. He hung up on me. You got 48 hours. Deliver me his head! And don't disappoint me again... Dmitry. Tell Katerina everything will be over soon. Viktor, you're sure you want me to go there? Oh, you have done enough, old friend. I've got to finish this alone. Take care of her. You don't have a choice, Viktor. You're wanted by the police and your fireworks are making the rounds of the city. We have to finish this thing within two days, and give back that painting. I know. Will you help me? Martelli. His weakness is girls. He spends a ton of money on call girls. He likes fantasy. He calls one practically every night. We need a girl with special talent. I know. I know people who can help. You know people? I had a hard time believing your call. The famous Alexandra. Thank you for receiving us, Vetrov. Thank you for receiving us. I have a hard time believing the sincerity of these words coming from a woman who always... refused to cooperate with me in the past. You are always welcome in my club. You are here to offer me a membership card? A special invitation maybe. Get to the point. Since you've come with a man wanted by all of Moscow's police. We need your help. My help? I'm retired. I am just a restaurant owner. So I hear. Viktor Lambert is a very dear friend of mine. Viktor. My son was killed by a diamond dealer, and I came here to kill him. Your son... I'm sorry to hear that. I... lost a son too. What is it I can do for you? You can draw most of the escort services in the city. Don't tell me you need a girl, Alexandra. That would be a first. It's a special order for one of your best clients. We need a girl with a very special talent. A special order for one of our best clients? I sense I risk losing this very good client. Oh, it's hot in here, Alexei. Do you mind if I take off my coat? Maybe this could compensate you. No... It's an old family jewel. A family jewel which resembles a piece of the collection stolen five years ago in Saint Petersburg. Really? One can never tell with family jewels. Dmitry... call the service. Tell them to send me someone in an hour. Wow, baby. Come to sit next to me. It's a nice club. Is it yours? No. A friend of mine owns it. I just use it for fun. He wants a vodka. Don't let me like that. Untie me, please. Oh, you woke up. Excuse me, but since I've been in jail, I haven't had the chance to cook. I love to cook. You see... I put candles... to create an ambiance... so we can get to know each other. I open a nice bottle of wine. Detach me. - Detach me. - Oh, shit, shit. I am hungry. By the way, it's a nice necklace, huh? In your briefcase. Look. Oh, I love this. Uncuff me! Before it's too late for you, Lambert. Too late? What did you say? I couldn't hear you. What did you say? What did you say? Uncuff me, otherwise my friend will come after you! Who killed my son?! I didn't kill your son. Perhaps not. Perhaps not. You're a dead man. A dead man. Perhaps not. But it was you... It was you... who got him the job. Who was he working for?! I can't hear you. I can't hear you. You're a dead man! I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man, huh? - Talk to me! Talk to me! - Belinskiy! Who had my son killed?! Anton Belinskiy. Anton Belinskiy. Not me. - Who killed my son? Tell me. - I told you! Belinskiy! Belinskiy, Belinskiy, Belinskiy, and... - Why? - Because your son was... a diamond delivery man for Belinskiy. He wanted out. And that's why he killed my son? Yes. Yes. Stop please. I beg you, stop. Listen. Is that why he killed my son? Listen to me. You say Belinskiy. So I ask you, where can I find that man? On my phone! His-his number is in there! Where? Where? On my phone! On your phone. Please stop. Stop. Claudio, how are you? Anton? Don't worry, Anton. I called you to tell you that your diamond necklace... is safe... and also your money. You are dead man. Hang on, Anton. Just a minute. Lambert! Lambert, you son of a bitch, answer! No. No! No! No! No, Lambert! No! No! This is for Jeremie. No! Oh, you look like you need a big hug. Come on. That was sweet. But you've changed. Seven years... without making love. How did you manage? I thought of you. Liar. Talk to me. Don't make me depressed after making love. I hate that. What? Talk to me. I wanna know where this is going. There it is. The marriage proposal. It begins. The pressure. I was madly in love with you for five years. Five wonderful years. But your silences... your absences... the way you keep everything to yourself. I don't want that anymore. I'm no longer a little girl that you're helping to discover the world. I know. What are you gonna do after? I don't know. There's gonna be a child in your life again. Jeremie's child. Don't mess up this chance. I know you. I know that deep down you're afraid. Katja died when my son was born. I truly tried to be the father she expected. I am empty. To lose what you love is hard. I have no more strength... - and then... - And then nothing. I know. I understand. But this child's gonna be born needing you. He's gonna need his grandfather. And a grandmother. Grandmother. That's a very romantic word to say to the woman you just made love to. There is one thing... that I truly know. I want some coffee and an enormous breakfast. Enormous. Okay. I'll call room service. And then I have to go to the club and do some business. Yes. For the Boroski's party we're creating a new concept. I just met with the wife. This is the proposal. I need you to prepare a budget. So... tell me where are they. I want my two hundred thousand dollars first. How long you worked for this Alexandra? - Three years. - Three years. - You like her? - Yes. And two hundred thousand dollars is the price of your loyalty. I need the money. Nice. You see, Ygor, everything has a price. Where are they? Stop. Please. Where are they? Youri Blochinovich. He used to work for Alexandra. They are there. Where?! Rybinsk. Good. You made the right decision. Now get them! - Hello. - Viktor? Souliman. They arrested Alexandra. They understood it was a self defense, but you need to bring them... you know what, Viktor. How is Katerina? She's resting. I'm going to get what we need to trade her... and bring it to the club. Alexandra Ivanova. Graduate from Oxford. Raised in London by an English mother and a Russian father. Married Anton Delov, a painter. Divorced in 1996. I met Viktor Lambert in 1998. And then your passion for the great works of art, say... takes another dimension. Each week I clean it like you asked. Everything is in order. You are coming back to Moscow? - Mr. Viktor, no. - Irina. No, no, Viktor. You don't have to be this generous with me. I have bought a little house in my village with the money you left me. I insist, Irina. God bless you, Mr. Viktor. Viktor Lambert is one the phone for you. You... and your friend had a lot of fun. Now it's my turn. Please stop! Where is Lambert?! Don't make me wait. Tomorrow, 3 p.m., my office. You, the girl, and your friend, Souliman. We take your deposition. If it matches our witnesses and was self defense, you're free to stay in Moscow. Thank you. - How are you? - Good. And regarding your son's death... make sure you're not creating any problems nowhere near Moscow. What's wrong? So... this is... Katerina. You caused all this drama. You failed to protect his son. And now... you will see his grandson die... before he is born. Okay, old man, where is your friend?! Okay. That was Vetrov. He knows where they are. Where is Lambert?! Go fuck yourself. Okay. I will. But first I want you to watch this. No, bastard, stop! This is your last shot, Souliman. Stop. I tell you everything you want to know. Where is Lambert?! Anton Belinskiy. Anton Belinskiy.
