 

                        [Owl hoots] [Connors:] What? Who might be interrupting me prayers? Oh, it's you patty. Well, why would you be talkin' to me? You know, i'm just a poor cobbler. What can i do? Ahh, i see. But, why me? Well, i'll do me best. Aye. Well, i've always had a lot of faith in you, too. [Music blaring from headphones] Knock it off! Excuse me, sir. How much farther? You're going to erinville, right? Yes, sir. Oh, not too much further, i'd say erinville is right at the end of that rainbow. Got a pot of gold waiting there for you, do you? Pot of gold? Well sure! Leprechauns hide their gold at the end of rainbows. What's a leprechaun? Why, i thought everybody knew about leprechauns. A leprechaun is an elf from ireland with special powers of his own. If you capture one he's got to take you to his pot of gold, and grant you three wishes. But be careful, if you let him out of your sight for one moment he's gone and owes you nothing. Do you think there's leprechauns in erinville? I recall a rumor that there's a leprechaun around erinville. But mind you, it was just a rumor. Where did it go? The rainbow? Don't be worryin' yourself none, laddie. I know where we're goin'. You don't think you're being a little too obvious, do you? No. As a matter of fact, i don't. It's part of the plan. Seems to me the last thing sam needs is a dreamer. Why don't you just help me with the ladder? Why don't you just ask her to marry you and get it over with? Cause she'll say no! You two boys need to have some faith. Learn to believe. She needs someone who has at least one foot on the ground. What she needs is me, and fortunately i'm available. Right on time. See ya, boys. [Whistles] Good morning, good morning! 'Morning. The usual? Yes, indeed. So Alex, what kind of scientist are we studying to be today? An epidemiologist. A what? An epidemiologist. Somebody who studies epidemics- you know, like the black plague? Sounds pretty serious to me. It is. Your niece and nephew coming today? Yeah. How long since the plane crash? Almost 6 months. Well, if anybody can help them face reality, you can. I hope so. Ta, ta! See ya. Come in. Getting settled okay? I'm glad you decided to come up here for the summer. Mom said being here was like being in heaven. So i figured maybe that will make it easier for him to find me. Hey, you're going to have a great time. And i'm sure you'll have all sorts of adventures. Adventures? Well sure. Hey, just look out there. Who knows what adventures are waiting for you out there. Why don't you come downstairs for a bite to eat? Okay. Are you coming? Be right there. [Loud music from headphones] Becky? Becky! We were just about to have some lunch. What? I said we were just about to have lunch. No thanks. Are you sure? I made some chicken... i'm not hungry. Okay... star gazing? Yeah. Did you ever see so many stars? There's the big dipper. See it? Yeah. And there's the north star, it's helped many a lost soul find their way home. Really? Alex has a telescope. Maybe tomorrow she can show you how to use it. Okay. Okay. Time for bed. Goodnight, aunt sam. Goodnight, honey. Goodnight, ace. I sure hope dad knows about the north star. Vrooommm... ready for landing? Ready! Okay, here we go! Again! Again! Sorry, Tommy. It's time for me to go. Tell me what it's like up there, again. It's beautiful. You feel like you're floating over and through the clouds and the earth's real small below. It's heaven! I wish i could go up with you. We'll see to it that you get your wish. When i get back, i'll fly you up there. Promise? With ace as my witness, i promise. [Pigeon coos] [Sam:] Guys, breakfast! Hey, you're late. The shop's open. Not to worry my dear friend, not to worry. All right, i'll bite. Why aren't you across the street? It's part of the plan. Today, i go in a little late. Each day a little later. Til she misses me and i won't go in at all. Yeah, so? That's the night i ask her to marry me. I'm telling you, it'll work. Ted, you missed a spot. Good morning. Good morning. The usual? Thank you very much. Hello. Don't i get a "good morning" out of you? Good morning! Who's your new friend? My cousin, Tommy. Hi, Tommy. Welcome to erinville. I'm rick callahan. Are you a policeman? No, close though. I'm a fireman. Ever see a real fire truck up close? Mine's across the street. Want to take a look at it? Yeah! Come on, i'll race you! Wait! We keep some of our emergency equipment in here. This ladder will get us up as high as 3 floors if we need to. More emergency equipment here. What's that thing? What, this? This is the main water hook up. You hook this up to the fire hydrant on the street with the hoses here. Jump up here and i'll show you the cab. [Meow] That's spot. We rescued her from the top of a tree. Found she had no owner, so we kept her. Haven't seen a mouse since. Never saw one before. That may be true, but... i see mr. Conners has caught your eye. Full of blarney he is, but he's loved by the whole town. He's a leprechaun if there ever was one. A leprechaun? There's no such thing as a leprechaun. No such thing? That's right. Fairies and all that stuff are just made up. They don't really exist. How can you be so sure? Because you can't scientifically prove it. That may be true, but there was once a time when scientists couldn't prove bacteria and viruses existed. They were laughed at 'til the microscope was invented, right? Yeah, you're right. That discovery led to vaccines and cures. That's exactly right. So don't be so quick to disbelieve because you can't see or prove something existed. You might miss some pretty neat stuff. Remember belief precedes the miracle. Rick, i believe in eating! Where's our food? Uh-oh, gotta go guys, i forgot! See you guys later. I still say there's no such thing as leprechauns. And i say there are and he is one. Is not. Is too. Is not. Is too. Is not. Mr. Conners is just a nice old man who tells stories down at the diner. He is one, and i can prove it. How? We'll capture him! Yeah, right. Then, we'll get our wish. I still say he's a leprechaun. Is not. Is too. Is not! Is too. Look it up. Leprechaun: An irish elf who works as a shoemaker. See! A shoemaker? He keeps a pot of gold. Upon capture, the leprechaun must disclose his location of gold and grant his captors three wishes. Told ya! Whoa! Stay down! Keep low! Hurry! Hurry! I see him. He's coming. Don't forget, if he gets away, he doesn't have to give us three wishes. I know, i know. That's if he's a leprechaun. Don't! He'll see you. But how are we supposed to see him? We should be hiding over there. That way we can watch him. Okay, but let's make it quick so he doesn't see us. The next time he stops, we'll run. What happened? I think he saw me! Are you sure? No, but he's still coming. Then he probably didn't see you. Let's go! Hoo hooo! Halt! You're captured! What's this? Miniature bandits? We're not bandits. But we know who you are! And who might that be? You're a leprechaun, and since we caught you, you have to take us to your pot of gold ...and grant us three wishes. A leprechaun is it? My, my Alex! I never realized you were a storyteller, too! Tommy thinks you're a leprechaun. Tommy is it? It's a pleasure to meet you. Liam patrick conners, at your service. What gives you this notion i'm a leprechaun? And don't think you can get away from me. I'm sure i couldn't, even if i were a leprechaun. I told you he isn't one! I didn't say that! Then you are one? And i didn't say that. So are you a leprechaun or not? What if i told you i was an angel? Angels have wings. Oh they do, do they? And what might a leprechaun look like? Like you. You two have got me in quite a spot here. If i tell you i'm not a leprechaun you'll think i'm lying so i can be on my way. Tommy, you can't judge a book by its cover. Especially an old one. Huh? It's not what a person looks like that makes them what they are. It's the intent of their hearts and the good they are willing to do for others that matters. He's trying to tell you he's not a leprechaun, Tommy. So you can't grant me three wishes? No, i can't. If only we could find the lost faeden... the what? The what? Surely you've heard the legend of the lost faeden? What's a faeden? The faeden is a small gold flute, the king of the fairies uses to play the song of the creator on. It helps all the other fairies see the glory and the wonder and the beauty of life. And Tommy, it's also what he uses to grant wishes. And it's lost? Aye. That's quite a story. You see, one day the king of the fairies comes to me with a special order... to make shoes for all the fairies. They've got this wonderful ball coming up. They're going to have funny fireflies hanging... but that's another story. But anyway, after he left i realized he'd left his faeden behind. I put it in me safe for safekeeping awaiting his return. But that night, as i was working late, a young man busts into me shop and demands all me money. And i give it to him, every cent. But that wasn't enough for him, he wanted the faeden as well. I told him, "it's no use to you" "since you don't know how to use it." But he took it anyway. I chased him as far as i could, but i lost him. He got away from me. But he didn't get away from the others. What others? What others? Why, the fairies, of course. He tried to make his get away through these fields and woods. But he never made it. What happened? Well, the police found his body in the river. Poor soul. They never knew for sure what happened to him, but i do. What? C'mere. The pooka. The pooka? The pooka? Shhh...! Aye, an odd fairy that one. Comes at night in the shape of a horse, and beckons you to ride him. But if you mount his back, he'll take you on a death ride that you'll never survive... unless you're one of the bravest at heart. Wait a minute. If they got the thief, then the king got his faeden back! No lass, seems that he lost it somewhere on the fairy ride. Then the fairies know where it is, right? No, according to the legend, this area is still filled with fairies all looking for the flute. Really? Aye lad, and they'll find it someday. But i kinda feel responsible for it and i'd like to find it first so i could give it back to the king meself. So i come here everyday looking for it. It's here somewhere, in these fields and woods. But alas, the going's slow because me eyes aren't what they used to be. We could help you look for it. It'll be like a treasure hunt. Aye, you could at that, and a fine treasure we might find. But i don't know... look, look, look there! What do you see? I don't see anything. Nothing? Trees. Trees. Only trees? And look, what's that over there? Clouds! Clouds. And that's all? What about the wind? Listen. Did you hear 'em? Ahh, never mind. I can see i've got me work cut out. You've got a lot to learn. This is not a task for the faint of heart, you know. I'm brave. Are you now? The fairies don't want anybody else to find the faeden. You'll have to be smart to avoid their traps. I'm very smart. Aye, i knew that about you. You'll have to learn to believe in many wondrous things. These fields and woods are full of things you've never seen or heard before. We'll learn. We'll learn. You will? You'll learn. Well, that's different! Why not, then? We'll meet back here tomorrow, and that's when our journey will begin! That is, if it's all right with your mother, Alex. Let's see what time it is here? Here, hold that. Ahh, it's getting late! She's going to be worried. Off with you, now. Go on, go on! I'll see you tomorrow. Leprechauns, is it? Well, why not? What? What do you mean you don't like the way i'm doing it? I am a storyteller, not a preacher. No, you can't put angels with leprechauns and fairies, it would ruin the story! Besides, you could play one of the fairies. Well, you've got the wings for it. Ah, patty, where's your sense of humor? So, how was everyone's day? Great! We caught a leprechaun. We snuck up behind a stump, jumped out and caught him. That's great, honey. Becky, how was your day? Fine. Tomorrow take a book and go down to the lake. I didn't bring any books. We can fix that. Mr. Conners said we could help him look for the lost faeden. Then maybe the fairy king could grant us three wishes. Could i be excused? The lost what? The lost faeden. A gold flute that was stolen from him. Could i be excused, please!? What is wrong? I've had enough! You're excused. Can we please help him find it, mom? Find what? The faeden. Look, i don't want you two bothering mr. Conners. I know he likes to tell stories, and they're nice to listen to but you can't... but, he needs our help. And besides it'll be like an adventure. Yeah! I'll talk to him. Yes! When did that happen? [Knocking] I'm on the phone. I need to talk to you. It's my aunt. I got to go. Bye. Come in. I'm sorry. Just sometimes i get so tired of hearing about what Tommy and the stuffed bird did. I see. I seem to recall a little girl who wouldn't go anywhere without sebastian. That was different. You're right. Sebastian wasn't the last gift your dad ever gave you. Do you know why he carries around that dumb bird? He thinks dad's coming back. If he doesn't have it, dad won't find him. Look, he's only seven. You sound just like my mom. Why don't you just make him understand that dad's never coming back. I know losing your dad still hurts, but i promise, in time the hurt will heal. You may feel like there's nothing left to believe in. Like there's a big empty place in your heart. What am i supposed to put in there? I wish i knew, becky. I wish i knew. Good morning to ya. And what have we here? A metal detector! A machine that... my, what a good idea! And that's not all. A map, so we know where we've searched. Aren't you the smart one? I'm glad you're on this hunt with us. Look! Here's where we are at the edge of the woods. We've got all this area here to cover. Whoa... that's a lot of area. Well, if you've got something better to do? No. Tommy, today you're the leader. Where we gonna go? That way. All right, then... onward! it's heard on the wind and the wings of summer.  softly it sings ta-loo ta-lee.  echoing sweetly as we once wondered  where can we find the answers we seek?  so sweetly its melody shows the secret  to all with a broken heart to heal.  it's found in the dreams of the child that seeks it  the end of the rainbow is always so near.  look to the sky when your heart feels like flying.  race with the clouds til the sun sets.  look deep inside when it's joy that ye seek.  it is easy when you but believe.  when looking through eyes of imagination  all that surrounds you blossoms anew.  from fields of clover to sweet carnation  the colors of life now burst into view.  so tarry awhile in this land enchanted  found in that place deep within.  there you'll find peace.  there you'll find joy.  it is waiting if you but believe.  open your eyes and believe.  we've covered a lot of ground. I think it's time for a rest. How about under this fine house? It's not a house. It's our tree. Your tree, is it? Looks like a fine solid house to me. Tommy? Looks like a tree to me. Let's take a seat under your tree. Come on, help the old man down here. Easy does it. Oh, my goodness. Well, i can see you two are going to need a little help. What are these? Training wheels for your imagination. Someday you won't need them, but for now put them on. All right now, both of you, close your eyes. Alex, you're no longer a little girl, but a sweet, gentle squirrel. And Tommy, you're a little bird, a beautiful blue bird. Now think. Both of you think. Now, squirrel, open your eyes, and what do you see? I see grass... really tall grass. And bluebird, open your eyes. Tell me what you see. I see brown, just brown. It can't be just brown, must be something, sometimes you have to stand back to see the truth. The tree! Aye, the tree! Squirrel, do you see the tree? Uh huh. Okay, both of you up the tree. What do you see? Explore the tree. Squirrel, you've come to a hole. Take a look inside. Tell me what you see. It's my house! Ahh, your house is it? Bluebird, can you find your house? Found it! All right, you can come down now. Now tell me, what are you sitting under? A house. A house. You can take your glasses off now. Alex, i'm sure if you imagined hard enough you could see things from a squirrel's point of view, but you didn't actually become one. Do you understand? I guess so. But how could it seem so real? I don't know. But there's always a logical, rational, explanation, even if i can't think of it right now. Okay? Bye, honey. Bye, mom. Bye, rick. Bye, Alex. Do you always tell her there's a rational explanation for everything? Oh, sure. It's disquieting to kids to give them all sorts of fantastical explanations and silly reasons for things. It makes them unsure. But what about the things you can't explain? We won't be too late. Take your time. I get paid by the hour. Yeah. Well? Look, nothing's come up, yet. Yeah, but it might. Then what are you gonna do? ll-de-di, ll-de-di, ll-de-di...  what are you humming? Oh... that's a tune the fairy king plays on the faeden. C'mere, c'mere. Listen, can you hear them? Who? The fairies, of course. I don't hear anything. Nothing? Just the birds. Aye, the birds and the wind through the trees and the animals rushing through the field. During the day, the fairies play along with the sounds of the meadow and at night to the crickets and the owls. If you listen very carefully, you can hear them. Well, come along now. But be careful! Don't let their music distract you. If you're not very careful, they could lure you into a fairy ring. A fairy ring? Aye, step in one of those and the fairies will have you dancing to their tune for seven years. [Clears throat] Hee, hee, hee! ll-de-dl-de- dl-de-di...  whoo! I think i'm caught in a fairy ring. Tommy, can you help me, please? Alex, do you think you can pull us out of here? You're kidding! Oh, i wish i was there. You're not going to believe what i'm looking at. My deranged brother and my misfit cousin are dancing around with, get this, a leprechaun they caught yesterday. Don't ask. I wish i was anywhere but here. What about the faeden? The what? The faeden. We were looking for the faeden. Oh, that's right! Look, we're safe now, and it's all because of you. What did i do? You reminded us of our goal and it broke the fairies' spell. Let's sit down. How come? You see, fairy rings only work on people who've forgotten what's important in their lives. Once they do that, the fairies have them chasing here and there after frivolous things, running around in circles and going nowhere. Why would they do that? Because fairies love to laugh. You must admit, we looked pretty silly. We outsmarted them that time, but i think we'd better mark the map so we don't venture into that ring again. We were right about there, don't you think? I think we've covered enough ground for one day, don't you? Tell me, do you still hear the music? Yes. ll-de-di...  la-la-la-la-la-la-la...  [humming] What are you humming, honey? I'm humming to the fairies' music. The what? The crickets and owls and the wind. Ohh. [Grinding garbage disposal] Darn. Maybe a fairy did it. Maybe a chicken bone fell in. See? A bone. No fairy. Maybe a fairy put it there. A fairy didn't put it there. I did. Probably because i wasn't paying attention. Maybe a fairy distracted you. A fairy had nothing to do with this. Alex, you know better. There are no such things as fairies. But how do you know that? Because, i say so. Now enough of this nonsense. Well, because... there's no scientific evidence they exist. Not yet, but where would we be if people didn't believe in creatures so small you couldn't see them with your eyes. They were laughed at. Gosh, i'm tired, Alex. And, who tells you the answer to your test when your mind goes blank, and all of the sudden it comes back to you as though somebody whispered it to you in your ear? Maybe you should study law. Oh, i see him. Yeah, and he's being chased by a caterpillar. Where's the legs? Oh, i see him, yes! Wait a minute, he's a tyrannosaurs. Well, hello there. Would you like to join us? I said, would you like to see the parade with us? Yeah, you just missed the catapilla-saurus. I think i'll pass. Aunt sam wants you guys. Oh, it's time to go, then. Oh, man... the parade will be back another day. Wanna race me home? Yeah! How about helping an old man to his feet? Up we go. Hello, i'm liam conners. The leprechaun. I guess you've been talking to Alex and Tommy. You must be Tommy's sister, becky. We were just looking at the clouds. There's so much to see up there. In the clouds? Aye, you have to know how to look. Look again. Do you see that little girl floating in the air? Yeah, i guess i do see her. Aye, but she looks sad and lonely as if she misses someone who was very special to her. My boyfriend never called yesterday to wish me happy birthday. Oh, but a lovely lass like that... she must have many friends. No, i think this is someone who's very special to her who she's angry at. Who might that be? My dad. If he hadn't died then i wouldn't be here, alone and forgotten on my birthday. I wish i was home. Now, don't be like that, always wishing you were somewhere else. You're missing out on what's here. Here? What's here! There's not even a mall. What good is a mall? A place to go out with my friends. Well tell me, what did you do at this mall? I dunno. Just hung out. Oh, i see. You did nothing at the mall. You could be doing the same thing here. What else? What do you mean what else? What else do you like to do? You know, i've learned everyone has a secret wish deep down in their hearts. Something they want to do more than anything else in the world, if only they had the courage to try. I guess i always wanted to learn how to ride a horse. Ahhh... what? Yes, i know. No, i... yes, no, no... i quite agree. Who are you talking to? Listen. I don't hear anything. Nothing? The wind? Aye. I frequently ask the wind for help when i have a problem. Does it ever answer? Aye, if you're patient and sincere in the asking. The wind always answers in its own way and its own time. Maybe i should try. Aye, lass, maybe you should. Did you hear it? I hear the breeze, but i don't hear any words. Aye, lass. It isn't easy, but this i know, when it's truly important for you to hear what the wind has to say, you'll hear it. But you won't hear it here, you'll hear it right here. And with practice it gets easier. Then you can ask it anything... what to do on a sunny day, the answers to your problems, how to fill the emptiness in your heart. How does the wind know? The wind is only the messenger. But how does... mr. Conners? Mr. Conners? I'm afraid of horses. You see it? Yeah. It's a bird. Hey, that looks like where my nest was. You guys, c'mon. Lunch is ready. Last one to the porch is a pooka! Go! That's not fair! No way! I won! You're the pooka. You got a head start. I'm not the pooka, you are. I won. That means i'm not the pooka. Yes, you are. I'm probably going to be sorry i asked, but what's a pooka? The pooka is a bad fairy that looks like a horse that takes you on a ride that you'll never survive unless you're very, very brave. Oh yeah? I'd say neither of you are pookas. Come on. Wait, i left ace in the tree. Get him later. No, we have to be ready to fly. What? Scott and cindy? I don't believe it! That's just great, lori. Yeah, thanks for calling. Now i know what kind of friends i have. One less question for the wind, i guess. Where to now? I'd say that way. Hold it! Hold it! What's wrong? I'm not sure, but i just got a funny feeling. Do you feel anything different? Sorta. Sorta. Aye, i thought so. We'd better put our jackets on backwards. Why are we doing this? Pixies! We don't want to get pixie-led in there. Pixie-led? Aye. Have you ever been on a trip and suddenly the trip was over you can't even remember the trip? Yeah, that happened to me on the way to grandma's last year. More than likely a pixie caught your attention. You were pixie-led, Tommy! That doesn't sound so bad. That's only the first step. Given enough time, a pixie will get you so confused that you'll start looking for happiness in all the wrong places. And once you get pixie-led, unless someone else helps, you could stay lost forever. So how does it help to put our coats on backwards? Don't you see, it confuses them. They can't tell whether we're coming or going. Bring the map. Ready for bed? You still miss him, don't you? Yeah, i wish he'd hurry and come back. Tommy, you know that he can't... i mean you do know where your dad really is? He's in... heaven. That's right. And when people go to heaven they don't come back. But he always comes back. He promised he'd come back. Ace was his witness. But what if he can't come back? Me and ace have figured it out. He's been pixie-led, we'll fix that as soon as we find the faeden. Good night, Tommy. Good night, ace. Boy, you're really dragging it out, today. I ain't going in today, boys. Part of the plan. Oh yeah, the plan. Take a look at this, tonight is the night! Good luck! We'll be standing by when you get blown out of the water. You think so? I don't think so. I'm a pretty lucky guy. A man with a plan. Nothing today, again. All this time i've been dreaming of finding it but still nothing. Aye, i've been dreaming about it as well. But maybe it was only meant to be a dream. What's the point of a dream if it doesn't come true? Now hold it, hold on, both of you. What was it that christopher columbus was dreaming of? I know, a new way to get to india. Aye, and it was that dream that gave him the courage to brave the unknown perils of the ocean. But, he didn't find what he was looking for. Exactly, instead he discovered a whole new world. But we didn't find anything. Ah, didn't you now? More often than not the search proves more valuable than the treasure. I promise you, you've both found far more than you realize and you're closer than you think. Come along, then. The faeden's waitin'. Don't run, you guys. Did you talk to mr. Conners today? Don't answer. It's a trap. Ahh, you two, hold on, hold on! You're wearing me out... an old man like me. It's time for a rest. No, not there. Follow me. Why out here? As a precaution, of course. The bad fairyies can't hurt you in moving water. Who's got the map? Let's see how we're doing. Look, only one section left. Darn, i wish we could find it. Shush, don't go throwing wishes around. Why not? Because they might come true. What's wrong with that? It might not be what you really need. I don't understand. I once heard of a woman who all of her life wanted to be very rich. One day, she caught a fairy and she got her wish. The next day, she got a big check from an insurance co. Because her poor husband had died in an accident. She got her wish, but became a lonely old widow for it. It's the nature of fairy magic. They can't give without taking. Well then, what should we wish for? If you must wish for something, wish for strength of heart, inspiration and courage. Always wish for things you're willing to work for. What if a fairy wish was the only way a wish could come true? Then you're wishing for things that shouldn't be. I still wish i could find the faeden. Well in that case, i'll just have to make sure you get your wish. Promise? With ace as my witness, i promise. The banshees! No, not yet, i tell you. I need more time! Mr. Conners, are you okay? I'm okay. I'm all right, dear. Just lost my breath for a moment. What's the banshee? The banshee? Well, it's a messenger of sorts. What did it say? It said i may be goin' away. Where will you be going? Where the wind lives. No. You promised. I didn't say it would be easy now, did i? Do you still want to find the faeden? You've learned to trust your hearts and believe in things you can't always see? What happens now is all up to you, don't you see? I was only your guide. You don't need me anymore. But we'll miss you. Aye, i'll miss you, too. But don't be sad. There's a purpose to everything. Close your eyes. Do you remember the morning when we danced to the fairies' music? Tell me what you see and hear. The birds. The fields and the woods... the forest. Anything else? I see Tommy... and you. Tommy, do you see me, too? Yeah. Whenever you need to see me, all you have to do is to close your eyes, listen for the music of the meadow and i'll be there. [Thunder] Storm's coming in. I cannot believe you took me to a drive-in. It was fun, though. It was okay. What was the name of the movie? I knew you were having a good time. A falling star! Make a wish... hurry! Oh no, not you, too! What? Oh, it's Alex. Seems like since she's started spending time with mr. Conners, she can't stop talking about fairies and magic. What's wrong with that? She's eight years old. She's got a great imagination. What's wrong with it? Yeah. The other day she takes one of her books and renames everything in it. She crosses out tree and writes "house." She calls the acorns "dinner"... because she thinks she's been changed into a squirrel. I must have missed something. I don't get the problem. The problem is what if she starts believing this stuff? Starts believing in fairies and magic and inanimate objects that are alive. She's having fun. Fun? I don't think it's fun. I don't want Alex believing in fairy tales, and men in shining armor and prince charming. Don't you think you're going a bit overboard with this? What's wrong with a girl believing in the dream that a wish will come true? What's wrong with it? Yeah. How about what's going to happen when some of those wishes don't come true, huh? I just think that we can do without the fairy tales in my house. Unless they're your fairy tales. What are you talking about? How about the one that everything in life can be explained rationally or scientifically? Oh, come on. How about why her dad never comes to visit her. Try those fairy tales, sam. That's enough. I think you'd better go. I'd never tell a little girl that prince charming is going to come into her life, kiss her and take all her troubles away. Come on. Maybe i do believe there's a... are you done? Just forget it, okay? Fine. Forget it! No, as a matter of fact, i'm not done. Just because you lost all your hopes and dreams doesn't give you the right to keep Alex from having any of hers. Now i'm done. Why'd i ever put you up there. No angel has ever listened to my prayers. Can i talk to you for a minute, mr. Conners? Yes, i'm always willing to listen and help. That's what i want to talk to you about. You're not helping anybody with all of your stories. Now why would you be saying a thing like that? Because i'm concerned about the effect you and your stories are having on the children's reality. Their reality? It's their reality that's been harming them, miss gayle. A little boy who waits for a father who can't return. A little girl who believes that science can answer all her questions. And a teen who's afraid to dream for fear of what her dreams may contain. You sound just like rick. Aye, and a fine man he is with both feet on the ground. Both feet! He's a dreamer. I don't think he even has one foot on the ground. Miss gayle... try to focus for a moment on the miracle of two words... "what if?" What if? Aye, "what if?" Isn't it those two words that lead the scientists to new discoveries, the dreamer to new worlds, the weary to hope. Where do your stories about leprechauns and fairies lead? I hope they lead to that place in the heart that reality can't touch. Do you remember? What if? Aye, what if. Go ahead. Try it. I'm sure there's dreams still living in your heart. Allow yourself to feel them, just one more time. Aye, i see you found the spot. Go ahead, miss gayle. Let your heart believe... believe even that there may be angels right here in erinville that do hear and answer your prayers. [Metal detector beeps] Something is wrong with mr. Conners. Like what? B-a-n-s-h-e-e... banshee: A spirit whose wailing foretells a coming death. Death? What are you doing? Listening to the wind. Is it sayin' anything? Yeah, that i pick lousy friends. Still upset about scott not calling on your birthday? I'm sure he was just... probably out. Yeah, out with my best friend, cindy. Lori called and told me. Honey, i'm sorry. Well, maybe this is for the best? What do you mean? I suggested to your mother that maybe you should all move up here. It might make all our lives a little easier. She didn't say anything to me about it. We were waiting. We figured once got here, you wouldn't want to leave. Yeah, right! It's just something to think about. I'll ask the wind. Think it could answer a few questions for me? Couldn't hurt to try. [Wind whistles] Hi, bill. Hold on a second. Kids, time for dinner. What brings you about tonight? I know the kids have been seeing a lot of mr. Conners, lately. So, i thought you should know. Liam's had a heart attack. Is he going to be okay? They're not sure. He's pretty bad. What am i going to tell the kids? If you want, i can tell them. Tell who what? Alex... Tommy... come sit by me. Tell us what? Mr. Conners is sick. Sick? What do you mean? He had a heart attack and is in the hospital. Is he going to die? He may. No! Honey, i'm sorry. Alex? Yeah? What are you doing? We have to find the faeden. We have to find it, tonight. We can't. It's dark. We'll look tomorrow. No, maybe it will be too late. We have to find it, tonight. Wait! I'm going with you. [Door slams] Alex, Alex? [Knocks] Tommy? The sooner we go, the sooner we get back. The woods look scary in the dark. Let's get ready. Ready? Ready! Let's go find it. Becky? Becky? Huh? Have you seen Tommy and Alex? No. I better call rick. Got any idea where they might be? Hi rick, it's me. The kids are gone. This way. Are you sure? Yeah. I think. Yeah, okay. C'mon. It's all right. I promise you we'll find them. They're good kids hiding somewhere. We just have to figure out where. I've called the firehouse, the hospital, and checked all the roads to get there. We're going to have to search the woods. All right, let's do it. You get the guys together and let's get moving on it. Hey, c'mon, it's going to be all right. We'll find them. I promise you, all right? Okay? Okay. Tommy, i think we'd better stop and check the map. Okay. Do you think you know where we are? No. I don't recognize anything. We might have been pixie-led. Now what? If we're lost, i think we should stay right where we are. [Mr. Conner:] But this i do know... when it's important enough for you to hear what the wind has to say, you'll hear it. Mr. Conners... okay, you know the drill. It's going to be tough to see because of this rain. Work your area thoroughly. Let's follow all standard procedure. Let's not forget that these 2 kids are cold and tired and probably huddled up somewhere. Keep your eyes peeled. God be with us all and good luck! [Wind howls eerily] What was that? Just the wind. We've got to get out of here. But which way do we go? Let's turn around and go back. But which wy is back? The banshees! They're after us! [Horse whinnies] The pooka! The one who got the robber! Let's go! Deputy, grab a couple of people. Check that ravine over there. [Dogs barking] What have you got? Nothing to the north. Make sure you get up on the south ridge. Look under rocks. There's a lot of holes they could be hiding in. Alex! What's that sound? It sounds like water. The stream! The bad fairies can't hurt us if we're in the water. Let's go! Tommy! We have to go across. But we don't know how deep it is. Do you think the pooka will get us? I don't know. Do you think we lost them? Maybe. I think we should wade. Stay close to the side and follow the stream? Okay? Okay. C'mon! Be careful! Look out! [Alex screams] Help! Help! Grab the log! Meg, what's that? Bill, i've got something. Yeah, meg, what is it? It looks like a metal detector and a couple pair of glasses. Help! Help! I need to see liam conners. Visiting hours aren't until 9:00 a.m. No, you don't understand. Is there a problem i can help you with? Yes, i need to see mr. Conners. My brother is lost and he may know where he is. Help! Help! Help! Help! Trail ends here! You sure? Yeah. Tommy! Take the dogs up there where it narrows. See if you can't pick up a scent over there. Bill and i will go down river. You know where this river goes? Help! Help somebody! Help! Help! Please! [Screaming] Tommy's? Yeah. I'm going to cross here and work my way down to the falls. Mr. Conners? Mr. Conners, it's becky. It's about Tommy and Alex. I think they went to search the last part of the woods. I was hoping you'd know where that was. Follow the rainbow. [Nurse:] Let him sleep. The medication makes him hallucinate. Where are we? Behind the waterfall. We were lucky the log caught onto the rock. What do we do now? We can't go forward and we can't go back the way we came. I guess we'll just have to wait. I hope ace is okay. [Mr. Conners:] Believe that there are angels right here in erinville. That do hear and answer your prayers. Dear god, please, please help them. The rainbow! I don't think anyone's gonna find us, here. If only we had the faeden, then we could wish our way out. Look, what's that? I don't know. Liam patrick conners... mr. Conners! Open it! That's it! The faeden, we found it. Just like mr. Conners promised. Now we can get our wishes. Go ahead, Alex, make your wish. I don't know how to use it, do you? No. Oh, that's right. Mr. Conners said the faeden was useless unless you know how to work it. Oh great! Tommy, why was it so important that you found the faeden anyway? I thought it was the only way i could get my wish. Great thinking. If i'd known this was going to happen, i wouldn't have wished for it. Sorry. It's all my fault. What did mr. Conners mean when he said we were close? We couldn't look in here. So if there's a purpose to everything, why here... ...behind the waterfall? There's got to be more. Look... Alex, look! What does it say? When you can't hear the music of cricket and owl, and the wind isn't telling you answer, when you look to the sky and see only cloud, to the forest and see only tree, play me. [Mr. Conners:] I'll open your eyes and your heart. Once again you will see all the wonder of the cricket, the owl, the cloud and the tree, and the wind-borne song of the maker. With hope you will see you are never alone... for someone who cares will always be there. One wish of the heart, a child's simple plea, each heard the same if you play... and believe. Tommy? Alex? You said, "follow the rainbow." I followed it. So, where are they? Believe in what? Magic? Fairies? Wishes? No. Tommy, think about it. None of those things are real. We have to believe in something bigger, like the power that made everything. That's what mr. Conners has been trying to tell us. Okay, but you go first. We wish for strength of heart and the courage to get out of here. No, stop! Those are the only things mr. Conners said we should wish for. That might count as two wishes. You might be right. We shouldn't take any chances. Go ahead, Tommy, make the last wish. Wish for your dad, that's what you've been waiting for. I wish... i wish... i wish that mr. Conners can have a good, long life. My dad's dead, Alex. Wishing can't change that. He's in a better place. Please be there. Please help us. [Flute plays] I don't understand. [Flute plays] They're behind the waterfall. Tommy! Alex! I'll go get help. [Horse whinnies] [Tommy:] The pooka is a bad fairy that looks like a horse, and will take you on a death ride that you'll never survive, unless you are very brave. [Mr. Conners:] Everyone has a secret wish deep down in their hearts. Something they want to do more than anything else in the world... if only they had the courage to try. I found them! Hold on! Calm down. Where are they? Behind the waterfall at the mountains. Hold on. Take it easy. Rick. This is ted. I think i've got something for you. Are they okay? I don't know, they're in the waterfall. Yeah, go ahead, ted. Yeah, becky is here, says she found the kids. Are they okay? I don't know, she says they're in a waterfall. Let me talk to her. Rick, they're at the waterfall. Becky, i was just there. Tell me where they are. They're behind the waterfall. Behind the waterfall or in the waterfall? They're behind the waterfall. Rick, crazy leo used to tell us about that secret cave behind the falls. Maybe it's true. That's where they are. The wind told me. Please, you've got to believe me. I believe you. Ted, call old man baker and have him get his crane up to miller falls, now. Miller falls? Are you crazy? They'd never survive. Let's hope you're wrong. Have a little faith, pal. Have a little faith. I'll meet you there. You are a very lucky young lady. I'd say your guardian angel was working overtime last night. So would i! Yeah, mom. We're fine. No, i know, don't worry. And mom, if you're still thinking about moving to erinville... it's okay with me. Well, then, who might you be looking for? Mr. Conners! It gave us the courage to get out from behind the waterfall. The courage didn't come from here. It came from what you believed, in here. Mr. Conners! Oh, Alex! Look, the three of us, together again. Oh, i love ya! dl-da-dl-de-dl-da-di...  hey, dan. 'Morning, rick. Giving your horse a tour of the town? Lightning hit my fence last night. He bolted. Strangest thing, you know? See you later. You had a visitor this morning. Left you something. Ted, you missed a spot! [Sam:] Rick, thank you for saving my princess and for helping me remember the dreams i'd forgotten. Dinner tonight? Sam. when clouds of darkness close in around you  look to that place hidden inside.  there you'll find love to wrap around you.  it's close to your heart if you've eyes to see.  look high to the trees and over the rainbow  to that secret place deep inside.  there you'll find peace  there you'll find joy  it is waiting if you but believe.
