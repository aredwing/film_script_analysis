 

                        Sometimes I pause to ponder upon the peculiar world of daughters, from homes they're born into, reared and raised, their ties they'll uproot, to transplant themselves elsewhere To a home she belongs, she will estrange herself and.. make a stranger's home, her own The little buds, before our eyes, will blossom into mothers of mankind Any daughter's father, be it some rich man in faraway lands, or some trader of fruit.. Iike myself here in Madhupur, all face similar fate Raising so lovingly, our daughter, so beloved.. blessing her every growing moment and then one day.. ..sending her away, forever All said and done.. daughters will always be daughters, like my Poonam I nicknamed her.. Bitto She's the only child of my late brother. My brother and his wife died, this unique gift, they left to me Poonam grew up with my daughter Chhoti The girls loved each other, more like siblings But my wife Rama, she never took kindly to Poonam, because in appearance, Poonam is prettier than Chhoti In Rama, Poonam always sought a mother.. but the motherless child would never find a mother's love I took Poonam under my wing Mr Accountant, let her finish counting, put it right back! All it took.. was only one loving glance to make her laugh And my poems, she would sing along We recorded our songs on tape For the little bridegroom, and his lovely bride.. a pretty palanquin is waiting outside A pretty palanquin, waiting outside But my little girl's always little to me.. ..never old enough to marry, you see She isn't old enough to marry, you see She's my bride, I'm taking her! He says She's my bride, I'm taking her now, Dauntless bridegroom has sworn a vow Now it's the daughter's turn to say, Daddy, why are you in a hurry to send me away? So what did the daughter have to say? Daddy, why are you sending me away? With so much love.. a daughter cares for her parents.. ..her siblings, everyone How dismal are some thoughts of men who think daughters are burdensome Both my daughters have come of age.. ..and it's time to think of Poonam's wedding Relax! You're in the world's narrowest lane, and in the middle of the world's slowest wedding procession. See you.. The world's dullest rocket, dull-est! Radhey - Radhey (blessed be the name of Holy Radha) Mr Accountant, Radhey Radhey Radhey Radhey.. Oh.. is that you, Mr Bhagat? It's been.. years! Is Mr Krishnakant at home? - Yes, welcome Madhupur remains untouched, it's just the way I left it, the same narrow lanes and slow wedding processions and.. pervasive fear, of shooting rockets. - So true Sir.. Yes? Mr Bhagat is here Mr Bhagat..! Bhagat, why did you take the trouble.. ..one call and I would've been in Delhi When you and your wife can travel to Delhi to place orders for jewelry, then why can't I come to Madhupur to deliver them? Of course.. thank you When I lived here, amongst you folks, the time of our lives we had.. you should remind him more often Sister-in-law, how's the knee? Improving A look at the design of these bangles will heal it And I know, you've a keen eye for jewelry Over years, bit by bit, jewelry must be bought.. ..for the day when daughters marry Giving daughters away in marriage, is said to be the most sacred act When a father sees his daughter standing before him.. ..resplendent in bridal finery, there is a sense of fulfillment Water Bless you Krishnakant, isn't she Poonam, your Bitto? Well, you've made her out, you saw her when she was so little It was intuition.. She's about to graduate in commerce, she takes care of my accounts But I've toiled in vain to craft such exquisite jewelry She is so beautiful.. who will look at my jewels! Chhoti.. Chhoti Aunty, I'll fetch her (Aunty.. Aunt) Sister, what a cool song.. please join me (Sister.. Sister) If Aunty comes to know, it's dancing and not studying, you know what's to happen? Nothing, you always save my skin Get dressed, we've a guest downstairs God! Guests come for Babuji and Maa makes me do the make-up drill.. and before I'm down, the guest is gone You're far better off Sister, Maa tells you nothing Sorry Sister.. Maa tells you nothing at all You chatter much too much to give anyone else even a say.. move Why weren't you ready? And no face pack even today? I disapprove of all this.. and stop showing your teeth In front of the guest, walk properly Madhupur's rabri, the world's best rabri! Krishnakant, I beg to be excused now Sister-in-law, may both your girls marry.. ..the world's best sons-in-law, soon You have my best wishes. - Thank you Uncle, for making Maa smile Rama, time for me to go to the temple The sermon is to begin Uncle (Uncle) He always forgets Uncle.. do visit us again She cares for the smallest of my needs, more like a mother Krishnakant, you wondered how I recognized Poonam. Fact is.. there's much talk in our social circles about.. ..her beauty and her beautiful nature You must have received several proposals for matrimony? Yes, but times are changing, even values are changing, good proposals are far too few For Poonam, I seek a home where her values will be respected Radha and Krishna's light divine bathes all there is in Universe Yet devotion inspires, this worshiper of Love.. to light this lamp in heartfelt prayer O'Krishna and Radha.. Krishna and Radha, O'divine come unto us, bless this home of mine Please accept our invitation, all we seek is Your love Krishnakant, I have in mind, a boy for Poonam.. a nice, handsome boy.. from an excellent family You've heard of Mr Harishchandra.. ..of Harishchandra group of industries, Delhi? Who does not know him? He's one of the luminaries in our society He has scaled peaks of prosperity, yet he is firmly rooted in simplicity He's a very open-minded person For Poonam.. I'm suggesting Prem, Mr Harishchandra's younger son I cannot even dream of an alliance with so high and mighty a family Are the sons of the high and mighty to go unmarried? Which family doesn't need a good daughter-in-law? But.. - No excuses Mr Harishchandra is searching for a good daughter-in-law A very good daughter-in-law, is what I'll suggest to him. Now, Poonam's photo Will you give me, or not? - I'll get it Look Maa, loads of face pack. Happy now? Sister, snap me a photo. I want to send it to the zoo Oh come on, Maa Babuji sends Sister's photo to Delhi, can't I send mine even to a zoo? Maa, can I tell Sister about the Delhi-wallah boy? I don't like these cheap antics Who's this guy from Delhi? Why should I tell? Babuji.. Babuji (Father) - Listen! Stop! Look..! Chhoti.. no sparing you! Babuji look! Sister is nagging me.. it's one question again and again When will the boy say yes, for marriage! What! Chhoti! Come here Bitto With much hope, Mr Bhagat has taken your photo to Delhi I was hearing the sermon today and.. I don't know why, but I got a feeling, this is the family you are destined to belong to Hurry up Grandpa, no time! - Yes, yes sir Harishchandra Good day. - Bhagat, welcome Marine life, is it? My grandson's homework project, what do you think of it? Very likely, the world's best project.. but why in the morning..? Getting his homework done, is my job We spent yesterday watching the cricket match, so now we suffer You paste that submarine. I'll fill in the color, your teacher will never know Grand-uncle.. what color's the sky? Blue Grandpa, what're you doing? Green.. sorry Grandpa, grow up My respects, Uncle God bless.. do you see the boss of 10,000 men.. ..being bossed over by a boy.. and how he obeys! Grandfather, after all Rahul, it is time for the bus. - Here uncle. Good morning Dad, good morning everybody My respects, Uncle. - Sunil, I wish you happiness Sorry, I'm late. Got talking to the lawyers No problem, join us Papa, reading newspapers at the table isn't allowed Papa, only business news, please. - For business, you've got all day Breakfast time is.. - Family time Thank you Here you are, son Bhavna, where's Prem? He left early, for a squash game. You forgot, Papa? Sorry Uncle, if Papa had it his way.. ..he'd have the whole family around him all day One minute! Are you taking off with Rahul to your mother's for a vacation? Papa, I'll be back soon Let ten gents leave home.. you won't know! But when women and kids are gone, the whole house sounds empty Bhavna, I'm sorry, no going to your mother's this time Papa. For this permanent problem of the world, I got a solution You get to go to your mother's and the house won't sound empty How..? Bring home a junior daughter-in-law I have.. found a bride for Prem Ya Prem, that's the shot Be right back Bali, looks like you'll lose again Now's your chance to escape. Run along. - Shut up Today I'll win Sorry guys. Papa wants me in office and it's urgent, so I'll have to go At least finish the game You win Good morning, sir I'll tell the marketing department to get in touch with you later.. Hey Aunt Maria, grab a bite? - No! I'm so very happy, I'm going to fast all day! Go.. go.. go.. Your daddy is waiting for you Come in, son That's okay. The rest is not so important. You talk to him. Talk to him. Papa, why is everyone beaming at me ? I didn't even win my game today It's all because there's a wedding proposal for you You mean, marriage? Your education is completed, now it's time.. ..for us to think about your marriage Mr Bhagat came home today He suggests there's a girl for you, her name is Poonam Poonam's parents are deceased, she was raised very lovingly by her uncle They live in Madhupur. Mr Bhagat says they are very decent, honest folks If I've your yes, then next Sunday.. ..we may go to Madhupur to meet the girl If there is someone else you like, you may speak openly, son No Papa, there's nothing of the sort Only thing is.. marrying, so early? Now is the right age, son. Even your brother married at your age Our scriptures say so, also from my experience.. it's easier to accept someone, easier to adapt to someone at an early age It makes for a relationship that grows more firm, takes deeper root Papa.. I haven't even started upon my career I'm just a trainee in the factory Prem, every man who aspires to achieve needs an inspiration She will come into your life like an inspiration.. to share every moment of your life, to bear half the burden of your sorrows And to double your joys You might think, why a girl from a small town.. Madhupur? Your mother was also from a small town near Bhopal Now who could have been a better mother to you? We lived life to the fullest, traveled the world, watched you boys grow up To this day, she is besides me Nowadays when I see youngsters losing faith in the institution of marriage, I feel so sorry Your mother always maintained.. the most vital components of a marriage are trust and honesty Children nowadays miss the significance Prem, I've always tried to be in step with you, your generation, to speak the language you speak, your kind of fashion, music, movies Now I want, you too should imbibe certain values from earlier generations Meet the girl, speak with her, find out if you can understand each other Then, take the decision And now, Poonam's photo Take a look I'll wait outside Guess what Prem, Bhagat Uncle told me.. when Papa spoke about marriage to him, he had blushed crimson Well? The wife's presence is always taken for granted, but for once at least, put that paper away and give your brother some advice The first time he came to see me, he came all prepared.. after memorizing a whole questionnaire Brother.. what was the first question you asked? - The first question? May I have a glass of water, please ? That was the first-and-last Uncle, she's the one you're marrying? Will she give you good-night kisses, like Mummy gives Papa? Naughty! - He's always talking his head off You got to be careful what you say in front of this guy Rahul, bedtime. - Good night You're becoming mischievous Papa.. paper.. It's yesterday's paper. Put it down! No, I was only.. Come More about Poonam? I'm told she likes to read In their house, girls never wear jeans, dresses, etc They never go to restaurants. Oh yes, you may have to speak in chaste Hindi I like Poonam When I meet her, what will I talk? Not to worry, the poor girl must be in the same quandary Unacquainted, as strangers, we try to find rapport, but there's a question in the heart Oh, what are we going to talk Oh, what are we going to talk New hopes, new joy, a strange fragrance fills the air.. with the coming of someone for whom I have waited with all my heart Oh, what are we going to talk! Oh, what are we going to talk Krishnakant basically belongs to Som Sarovar Som Sarovar, where grapes grow? - Exactly Sister-in-law hails from Bhopal. - My in-laws are also from near Bhopal Please.. have some. - You should sit here And talk to Prem Please sit. What's this restlessness.. I feel today? The way I feel today.. never was I in this state of mind before Eyes looking out.. for her alone This beauty is for him alone The one I pictured, I'm about to see The storm is turning into a tempest. Oh, what are we going to talk Oh, what are we going to talk Like an icon of beauty descended from skies, has she come only for me, in such splendor? I know he's hiding his looks.. stealing furtive glances only at me Unspoken words upon my frozen lips Did my heart miss a beat? Tomorrow's lovers, what are they going to talk today? Oh, what are we going to talk Meet Poonam, say hello Say hello to Aunt.. say hello! Hello Hello.. Krishnakant, we have met Poonam. Now with your permission.. Iet Prem and Poonam talk to each other to get to know each other's minds Bhavna, please Have we come to sit on the swing? - No! We've come to talk. - We couldn't talk downstairs? Your Uncle and aunt want to talk here. - Then what are we doing here? Rahul! No more questions Hi, I'm Prem. - My name's Rajni, you can call me Chhoti If the two of you get going, then I'm your sister-in-law Please.. Sit, Poonam. - Please sit Sister-in-law, sit. - You sit Why is no one sitting? Chhoti, we're being formal and crowding.. ..over the ones who want privacy So put down the tea tray and let's go Okay Prem, Poonam. All the best. - They got exams? I'm not too sure that I know what we should be talking right now We're meant to take a decision about the next step in our lives But before we have discussed our past, how can we think about our future? Schooling and college in Delhi ; then for about a year, I went abroad Studied journalism, literature.. basically, trying to discover myself My brother says, I'm too emotional .. in business matters He calls me Bholu, a Simple Simon In college, I took a liking for a girl.. my classmate.. used to sit on the desk in front of me Several times, I felt like making conversation, but I never had the guts And it was just as well, later I found out.. she had two boyfriends already I even tried smoking, with friends But when Sister-in-law caught me smoking.. ..I promised her never to smoke or drink I have never spoken of these things even with my Papa. But, I don't know why, I felt I had to tell you I'm told you like reading.. which books are your favorites? Saratchandra's Parineeta, Swami Rabindranath's Atithi, Samapti All in Hindi, right? Their English translations are excellent too Do you also read spiritual books? I mean.. The divine..? Yes.. you read them? Do you believe in prayer? I mean, you trust, He'll give what you seek?

I've all the answers If you wish, we can meet again, once or twice..? Well then, shall we..? So? Oh.. so.. Is that a yes? I think.. - It's on your face, Bholu, it's a yes Sister-in-law.. Listen.. one second! Listen.. I think we should meet again, once or twice, for her sake How chivalrous! Papa.. yes Really? Where's Prem? Congratulations! - Thanks Harishchandra, my compliments Please be seated Krishnakant, from our side, it's a yes Please ask Poonam as well and if she says yes, then at the earliest, I want her as my daughter-in-law Bitto, Chhoti.. from their side it's a yes Bitto, what's your decision? - Babuji, it's a yes You asked whatever you wanted to find out? You want to meet him again, once or twice?

Yes? They have come prepared, they want the engagement done today! Before committing an alliance with so rich a family, talk about dowry I won't let you squander all we have, our daughter is yet to marry Really Rama, sometimes you exceed the limits Krishnakant, may I come in? Harishchandra..? Come in, do come.. I beg your pardon for the intrusion, but now that two families are uniting.. ..I'd prefer we kept nothing from each other Please, have no doubts Give Prem a token of one rupee and a coconut.. ..and accept him into your family We want Poonam and nothing else The world's best couple Aunt, smile. - Not Aunt. Call her Aunty How did this Aunt become my Aunty? Your Uncle likes her so much, what to do? Kindly let it come.. that's it Papa, the cars are waiting.. - Sure..

You and I haven't even gotten talking Harishchandra, a little request If all of you may spare a few days to visit us in Som Sarovar, we have a little house there ; a few days together, would be very nice Whenever you wish, Krishnakant. We're looking for excuses to meet Poonam, what with the astrologer fixing a marriage date after six months Sister-in-law, give the astrologer a nice meal.. ..ask him to fix a nearer date Then.. Som Sarovar next month? - Hundred percent Good night. - Good night You aren't one of the brides people, you're coming with us Oh, I forgot! - You'll accompany the bridegroom Correct! - Bhagat will be here with us, to welcome the bridegroom. - That's also correct How can both be correct? The way it is, I've an invitation from either side.. ..so there's no stopping me Bridegroom arrives, I'm here to welcome him.

May I wear it after the wedding? In Madhupur, we live simply Wearing such an expensive gift there, I'd feel a little uncomfortable No, it's okay. I understand Poonam, you just spoke your heart and you said it so frankly, it felt wonderful Maybe it's this honesty, that's to be the cornerstone of our relationship With the same honesty, if I were to give you another gift, and if you think it's right.. ..will you wear it? Turning defeat into victory.. With great honesty.. Love has cast it's effect.. On the heart.. Today there is no question of.. Any denial.. if not diamonds, a simplicity of flowers has adorned her beauty So little said, so much remains ; a little shower, I wait for rains, to dance like a peacock in rain, my heart yearns.. to dance like a peacock in rain, my heart yearns.. a little wait.. that's it.. a little wait.. that's it So little said, so much remains ; a little shower, I wait for rains, Prem, spot Prem, hit her! Or, they'll win Hit Get her.. why don't you take her out? a little wait.. that's it a little wait.. that's it This is sheer bliss.

Chhoti knows, she told everyone that I've gone off to sleep If someone finds out you aren't there.. then? Chhoti has propped up pillows and thrown a blanket over them All this.. just because I asked you to come? I wanted to come Why did I take so long to realize this, Poonam? I even missed seeing.. you've worn that necklace for me tonight Do you know Poonam, since I came to Som Sarovar, I've been wanting to call you to the terrace But every time, I held back I wish I'd known that I had the right to call you anytime But what a time to come to know, when it's time.. to go Poonam, people spend lifetimes looking for love Today, I look in wonderment at this custom of marriage.. in which, that love has come to me, as a gift Suddenly I become so special to someone, what I eat, what I wear, suddenly is more important.. to somebody else than me, myself.

You just got over a nasty cold Not even cold water Anything else? Prem, hurry. We'll get late My love.. My love.. my heart calls out to you..

I've spoken about Chhoti to so many people But because she is dark, I find no suitors Worse now, if we can't provide for her dowry, then she's had it But why would you worry for that? To pay for Poonam's wedding you pawned off our Som Sarovar house Now, sell even this house if you will! Who is it? Bitto? What happened, my child? I don't want to marry Bitto.. what are you saying? Come and sit here Sit.. what's the matter? Uncle.. Uncle.. ..you built brick by brick.. the house in Som Sarovar And you have mortgaged it for this wedding? Chhoti is yet to marry! I'll never be able to forgive myself Chhoti will have just as fine a wedding.. I give you my word For every father, a daughter's wedding is.. .. a celebration of a great wish come true Will you not let my wish come true? Listen.. a letter from Harishchandra has arrived You want to hear it? One second He writes, With great pleasure, I remember staying with you at Som Sarovar In Madhupur, we became related. In Som Sarovar, we struck a friendship In terms of relationships, such a quick promotion All credit goes to your endearing nature Having known you, I can tell with conviction, that you have already embarked upon the preparations for the wedding A thousand responsibilities entail in a daughter's wedding Have no worries of any sort, we are one family Bitto, when you have such a fine father-in-law, what's my worry? Now, one little smile I have good news for you In today's mail, perhaps.. there's a letter for you Bitto, someone far away.. is waiting for you, weaving dreams Go on.. fill in the colors It's four in the morning and I've no sleep I reach the office before anyone else But it's another matter that I am not able to do any work But today, I put in lots of hard work,.. .. matching color schemes for each costume.. we'll wear for our wedding ceremonies the soiree, reception, dinners I had coffees after coffee to stay fresh But the only things that remain fresh, are memories of you Poonam, I can't tell the source of this enthusiasm, but I'm propelled to achieve in life,.. .. to prove myself worthy, for your sake Coming, coming Bitto, your phone Who is it? Perhaps.. a friend Birjoo. Hey, Birjoo Guess what happened, just guess Half an hour ago, we were in a meeting, me, my brother, the managers A Japanese multinational corporation has offered us a deal, a new line of business. It'll be a great thing for our organization They want us in Tokyo next week, with the project reports My brother is busy with the clients from Switzerland And Papa is out of station, so who is to be sent I'm going I'll go I'm off to Japan next week and there's lots of work, no time to talk. Bye Birjoo.. Birjoo What happened? At today's meeting.. Project report will be ready in 3 days. Let's book flight tickets for Monday I'm thinking, Ms Poonam.. I mean.. Ms Pooja, it would be nice if you and Mr Manohar.. can join me on this trip Brother, is it necessary to send the papers to our auditors.. in Madhupur.. I mean, Mumbai No.. it won't be necessary Yes, of course Excuse me You're laughing! I'll never talk to you again Sister, you've upset him Stop the rickshaw. - Go and call him now You drank chilled water again? Yes Why? I'm coming to see you What? Yes, right away Stop It's a big project, is that why you're afraid? Poonam, if I do not succeed.. will it affect your love for me? How can you not succeed? In legal matters, business, I never had an aptitude Everyone seems to be more experienced than I am.. more capable You'll surely succeed And you know, when you return a victor, everyone will be waiting with garlands at the airport, to welcome you How can you speak with such confidence? I know you It seems, you know me better than I know myself I'll pray for you Say it again I'll pray for you I'm leaving in 3 days For a month, no phone calls, no letters Be prepared I accept. Anything else? You are here? Everyone's waiting for you, for the meeting Go.. I love you dearly Awake.. at this hour? I have the right Waiting for someone gives such pleasure? That only a woman's heart would know Ready to leave? Yes Once I'm there, I think I'll grow a beard for.. .. folks to take me more seriously That won't be necessary Can I shout? Most welcome I love you Rama, Agra was the right place to go. We got the musicians, also confectioners The same confectioner, whom you favor too Everyone will land up two or three days before the wedding Imagine in less than two months, Bitto will be a bride Aunty, you asked for me? Yes.. sit Look, very soon you'll be married .. you'll enter another family That will be your home As we know, your Uncle is very attached to you Obviously, when you leave, he will miss you dearly So it's time you began to distance yourself from him When your Uncle goes out, Chhoti can also give him his shawl, no? Yes Aunty Why ask me to give the shawl to Babuji? Because I wish you would No, because Maa wishes it Sister, your getting married doesn't mean you must break all bonds It's your home no more, that's what Maa is implying? You'll be the one taking care of all these things, after I'm gone Yes, but after you're gone, Sister. Why from now itself? Because, while I'm still here, my Chhoti must pick up everything from me Take.. it's time for Uncle to visit the temple Babuji.. Chhoti.. how come you've brought my shawl? Sister is ironing clothes. - Okay.. Bitto usually wraps it around like this.. Poonam, books from your schooldays are.. .. still in the room you share with Chhoti Select the stuff you want to take along.. ..the rest we'll have to dispose off Chhoti needs more space in the room to herself Girls' College, Madhupur Here you are Poonam, transfer papers for your Delhi college Thank you Ma'am Sister, quick!

When did Poonam come in, when did you plan all this? It was his idea, to ask Poonam over. - What an idea, brother! Where are thy lotus feet? At thy lotus feet I shall bow and.. Exult? (ln chaste Hindi) - Exactly! Desist, first return to your place And with your fiance, engage in polite conversation (.. in chaste Hindi) Indeed Indeed.. Oh, I just love this language. - Joker Papa is throwing a party at home, to felicitate you.. and also because Poonam is here for the first time Welcome.. how are you? Prem's father-in-law Friends, I'm on cloud nine My son has achieved this on his own merit The glow you see on his face is nothing but the reflection of my heartfelt joy For his success, my joys, the credit goes to someone.. who is visiting us for the first time .. my new daughter-in-law In eating, our Krishnakant is the world's most bashful More pakodas for him. - Enough Krishnakant, we know, it's your favorite. Poonam, serve there You cannot refuse now.. my daughter-in-law is serving you Papa, how about giving Poonam a tour of the house before she leaves? Sure, take her Come, Poonam Poonam, after our wedding, this will be our room In Som Sarovar, I snapped the portraits of your uncle and aunt.. especially for this side-table. You know Poonam, sometimes I think.. What happened? Nothing So, what were you thinking? Must we speak always and only about what I think, what I feel? What you think, you feel, is also vital We're companions, Poonam Today, while serving Uncle, I got so emotional, I had to hold back my tears Poonam, I brought you here.. to show you my new cupboard, my writing table, my new computer.. without a thought, that your cupboard, writing table, even your surname.. you'll be leaving behind.. for my sake For our sakes Poonam, I've just decided! Every year we'll spend one month in Madhupur If anyone ridicules me for living with my in-laws, I don't care I hear.. in the countdown to the wedding date, girls go crazy about shedding weight? No crash diets for you. 10-15 kilos here or there, is no issue Can you imagine what will happen when you arrive riding a mare to wed me? What? The bread is likely to get burnt in the ovens of our neighbors' homes Why? Every girl will be on her terrace, vying to take a peek at the bridegroom Poonam, time to go Yes, Sister-in-law Sister-in-law, just two minutes.. please All right, make it quick How much will they talk? - Shh.. come on Poonam, my heart knows, l don't want to let you go I want to show you around Delhi, to take you places with me But we'll wait, as even you consider it proper And in a way, what's proper is so right The night, when you enter this room as my bride, will be so right.. that the Moon, the stars out there will come down, to witness our union And they will carry our legend to every couple who marry after us On our perfect night, let only the Moonlight shine.. upon the world's prettiest girl, who by then, would be mine.. for ever Is it true Poonam that you will always be so close to my heart? Am I really going to be the lucky one, you'll gift your days and nights to? A few things for you, a few things for the household Give it to Aunty, she'll understand. - Sure, Sister-in-law Bless you Return soon This household, all of us here.. are waiting for you Uncle Bhagat.. isn't there a custom to escort the lady? - Should be.. shall I ask your father-in-law?

Sister is looking so radiant Whose borders were from home to the street.. Is she the same girl.. Rama, I was listing the items we'll give to Poonam, the things she will need, clothes, jewelry. And listen.. half the jewelry I retrieved after I paid my.. .. brother's debts, goes with Poonam Give it to me, I got to get it polished There's no need to give away old jewelry Here's the jewelry that Mr Bhagat made for this wedding. This is enough What do you mean? Maybe you didn't notice that diamond set worth millions? Your darling niece was made to wear it by her in-laws for the party in Delhi If she doesn't wear your jewelry worth some.. .. thousands, her beauty won't be marred Leave the old jewelry for Chhoti Rama, do not forget.. that jewelry belonged to my brother Not mere ornaments, they're symbolic of his blessings for her What he pawned, was his. What we retrieved, belongs to us Is Poonam not one of us? I've said what I had to say You're going overboard with this wedding About the jewelry, if you force your whim,.. .. I'll have nothing to do with this wedding Rama, in this family we've two daughters.. .. and they have equal right to all we have And Poonam is my elder daughter, whether you like it or not Then so be it Here's the jewelry Here are the keys. Do what you want Rama! Sorry Aunty.. some gifts from Delhi, if you'll take a look.. I know! Your in-laws are filthy rich and you needn't show it off in my face Show it to the one who ought to know! I've nothing to do with this wedding The florist is arriving from Delhi by the ten o'clock train Get to the station to bring him here Welcome Bhagat I'm here now, what can I do to help? - Your presence is enough I've brought you Poonam's wedding dress from her in-laws Here you are.. Two days from now, as the clock strikes this hour, you'll be giving your daughter away Aunty, the keys to my cupboard There are so many things inside.. Chhoti, could use them Aunty, if I have ever done anything to hurt you.. please forgive me Poonam.. before you leave.. shut the door Take it easy, one at a time Tell them Sister-in-law, please. - Sure. Please, don't harass him Wait.. what's the purpose of this make up? To make you look worthy enough for your pretty wife-to-be Really?

I'll fetch her O Giver of every wish, Keep the bride happy always Hail Gauri Mother. Hail Gauri Mother.. What is it? Is it the pain in the knee again? Massage it with the balm Rama, you did not even look at Poonam's wedding dress ; I said nothing You didn't participate in any of the wedding rituals ; I said nothing But Rama tomorrow.. tomorrow, Bitto will be leaving this house forever Tomorrow, the bridegroom's party will come to our door, just like this, with a band playing songs of joy Give the bride a happy send-off, Rama Rama you know this, as I know If she is denied your blessings, it won't be a happy send-off for her For once, forget all else Rama, for the sake of Poonam's happiness, Iet her depart with the belief that her mother has blessed her way All her life, she has yearned for that one smile of yours It's for the child's joy ; even if we do something.. .. we dislike, we won't lose face But why such resentment, because she isn't your daughter? Better, you do not hear the reply Remember Rama..? Whenever your knee was in pain, it was Poonam giving you a massage Enough Today, you refuse to acknowledge her.
