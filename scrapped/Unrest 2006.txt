 

                        An Aztec temple. Aztecs this far south? Dr. Covas, we must stop. This is sacred ground. This could be the biggest archeological discovery of the 21st century. But the spirits-- they are at rest. Keep digging. I want my money's worth. Fine, leave. We'll just hire others to do what you won't. Then the curse will be in their hands. Keep digging, digging... Dr. Covas, we must stop. It's not worth it. The spirits-- they are at rest. Brazil? That's where she died. That's not where she's from. Hospital said she's a Jersey girl. Jersey girl? Freaky. Boxed up and shipped off to some medical school. It's a long way to go just to get hacked up, don't you think? I know that's right. Malcolm, you remember when you got your driver's license, There was a box you could check to be an organ donor? Yeah. Well, there's another box you can check to donate your body to science. Never check that box. You got extra cheese on yours, man? Uh... No. I think I got extra cheese on my sandwich, man. I think she might like me. She's using dairy products to flirt with you? All I'm saying is I got a little extra cheese on my sandwich. I think, you know, yeah, she might be trying to tell me something. What do you think? Oh-- huh-uh. Mmm, you got to be kidding me. Prep all these bodies in this stench? I don't think so. Dead bodies never smell good, Malcolm. I know that's right. Man, that smell just ain't right. See, that's why when I die I'd like to go out like a Viking. A Viking? Yeah. See, they build a funeral pyre, - float it out to sea... - Yeah. ...and just let the body burn. Vikings had a great sense of dignity. Bon voyage, man. Bon voyage. - All right, you ready? - Yeah. Whoa, we got a young one. She's been butchered. There's some sick people in this world. Yeah, well, sick people aside, What's she doing in a cadaver lab? She's too young not to have some kind of family to take care of her. I don't know and I don't need to know. Best thing about this job-- I don't need to know. Hey, Malcolm? Remember that girl... what was her name? Angie. - Angie? - Yeah yeah. 21, 22? - Oh, yeah. Blonde, right? - Uh-huh. - Brain aneurysm? - That's the one. Yep, boy, oh boy. What a shame. I mean, the tits on that girl. - Bodacious, right? - What a waste. Never see anything like her again. Now let's not be too pessimistic, Malcolm. There's always hope. Here we go. God damn, that's some ugly pussy. Malcolm, this might be somebody's mother. Not my mother. My mother is in Cleveland. Ivan, is that you? Ivan? Quit playing, man. Gowns and gloves, ladies and gentlemen. Gowns and gloves. Welcome, welcome to Gross Anatomy. Excuse me. Jesus Christ, it smells like my grandmother's house. Well, let's just hope she's not with us today, shall we? Formaldehyde and death. Now no doubt most of you have been having nightmares about this class since you got your acceptance letters. for your positions. You're the privileged few. So, don't abuse it. I would venture to suggest what you learn here-- not just about the human body, but about yourselves-- will probably be the most valuable lesson over the next four years. Right, you have access to the lab The code to enter is 6-6-6. Something... something easy for you to associate with this class. Let's begin. Groups of four. - I'm Brian. - Carlos. Hey, now. Why don't you come join us? You'll have the best body in the group. How are you doing? I'm Carlos. - Hi. Alison. - I'm Brian. Hi. Don't remember seeing you at orientation. - Oh, I just got here. - Oh, off the wait list? Uh-huh. When you pull back your sheets you may feel lightheaded. It's all right. It's quite normal. Just take a moment or sit down if you wish. But know this-- I will tolerate no disrespect for the dead. In lesser schools you may get away with a failing grade. Here you will find no such leniency. Right. You many begin your dissections with the thorax. Um, excuse me. It's Friday. I mean, the classes don't officially start until Monday. We're not properly dressed. You're no longer in college. Here everyone is responsible for themselves. The lab is open You may do your dissections whenever you and your group chooses. I'll be here during normal school hours. All right. Carry on. Thanks. All right, I need to go change. What do you say we meet back in an hour and we'll start slicing up. All right? Don't be a wuss, man. A chance to cut is a chance to cure. Spoken like a future surgeon. Oh my God. I would not want to wake up next to Norma. Norma? She looks like a "Norma" to me. Alison? Dr. Blanchard? Dr. Blanchard. You have any illnesses? You diabetic? Huh-uh. Whoa, take it easy. Easy now. Easy does it. Okay, up you go. It's nothing to be ashamed of, you know. I threw up half my lunch on the first day. Lot messier than that. You can never tell how it's going to affect you. Who is she? No idea. Jane Doe. Where did her body come from? I don't know. All cadavers have to come from at least 500 miles away in case somebody recognizes them. Dr. Blackwell, I felt something in there. Look, it's your first day, right? The mind plays funny tricks. Would you mind if I just stayed here until class was over today? I think it's better if you go back in. What do you think? I was this close to resuscitating you. Looks like somebody's feeling better. Perfect timing. Saved the best cut for you. Look, don't worry, I'm a little queasy myself. She's too young. Something's not right with her. Murder? I don't think so. Look at those wounds, guys. Norma was kinky. Submissive. - Submissive? What do you mean? - S&M-- bondage, flagellation, cutting. Come on, this is a human being. Yeah, and probably a prostitute-- homeless. They all are. How many people do you know donate their loved ones to an anatomy lab? Homeless maybe, but this woman had a child. Her nipples have dark pigmentation matured from breast-feeding. Okay, can we not personalize this? I'm having a hard enough time looking at her without knowing her history. Too much talking, not enough cutting. She won't feel it. All right, give me the blade back, I... don't want you passing out again. Just give me one minute. Good work. Now remove the breast tissue by blunt dissection. Pressure creates heat. Heat melts the fat, which exposes your plane. I don't know about you guys, but I'm diagnosing myself with a serious case of the jitters. Yep. All right, pass the formaldehyde. It's called "futbol", cabrn. No it's not, hombre. Football is football and soccer is soccer. Besides, nobody likes soccer. - I like soccer. - The whole world loves futbol. Thought this was a team activity. You need a cellphone. We couldn't reach you. Norma didn't want you vomiting on her again. Very funny. At least you didn't miss the best part. Ready? You all right? You got a major problem. This is just a body. What is it? It's just my mind playing tricks with me, okay? Oh, these facial cuts run vertically and then here they go horizontally. - So what? - So these wounds are self-Inflicted. Look, I thought we agreed not to personalize this. All right, can we just continue here? You know, wait. I can't take her watching me. One... two... Okay, pull it. I definitely saw that. Oh, that smells. Oh great, man. The dead fart too. Can you imagine being stuck in a coffin still smelling them? It's hydrogen sulfide from the bacteria decomposing food in her bowels. It's disgusting is what it is. What the hell was that? You don't play with a body. Are you kidding me? That was awesome, dude. That was funny, come on. - Carlos, take your skirt off. - You all right? - Yeah. - I'm just joking around. You don't play with the body, all right? Come here. Do you want a hug? Give me a hug. - You know, you're a jackass. - Just a little hug. Doesn't mean you're gay, dude. Just two men hugging. If you guys think I'm going in the girls' locker room alone you're crazy. I feel like those dead bodies are watching me. Well, they are-- their souls at least. Bodies and souls don't separate until they are properly buried. Forget the spirits, man. You-- you creep me out. - It's a proven fact. - Uh-huh. The spirit is a human invention to explain what we don't understand. Life is really just a series of chemical reactions that begin at ejaculation and end at death. Agnostic? Something like that. Enough with the philosophical crap, all right? Can we please just go get some beers? Please? Carlos, I'll get you water, milk-- whatever your mom lets you drink. You guys feel that? Feel what? Sense of doom. We all do. It's called medical school. - I just thought coming here... - What? Hey, don't worry about what happened. Maybe I should have stayed in law school. Maybe, huh? Maybe you should go to law school. I hate you, Carlos. Oh, very funny, jackasses. Oh man, nice. It wasn't me. I don't know anyone else here. Hi, is Rick O'Connor here? - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing here? I just thought I would come by and say hello. - How are you? - Good. Guys, this is my fiance Jennifer. - Jennifer, this is everybody. - Hi. Nice to meet you guys. - Oh, what is that smell? - Formaldehyde. That's our cadavers. Get used to it because it's not coming out of our clothes. The whole thing sounds totally gross to me. That's why they call it "Gross Anatomy." Well, I want to see. Show me. Some other time. You're kidding me, right? You can't just show her. You can't disrespect those people. - Dude... - Well, I just wanted to look. Spirits see everything. The dead aren't to be messed with. All right? You disrespect the body, you enrage the soul. - What's with this guy? - He's a clown. Okay, well, I smell like a foot, so... I'm going to go upstairs and take a shower. Upstairs? You mean, you're staying here in the hospital? Well, yeah, just until my financial aid comes through and not a second longer. You could stay with me. I'm in the Medical Towers. - Nice to meet you, Jennifer. - You too. She's over here. Oh my God. - You ready? - Yeah. - Sure? - Yeah. Ta-Da. Nice, right? Why is she cut up like that? Because this one here was a sadomasochist. Whoa... Okay, enough. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. Come on, Rick, you haven't shown me anything yet. Fine. All right. This is the liver, right here, and this is the diaphragm here, - and the stomach... - So is this her heart? No no, that's her lungs. And that's the other-- what are you doing? It feels kind of warm. That's impossible. It can't be warm. Holy shit. Oh my God! Jennifer... Jennifer. Jennifer, hey... Hey hey hey hey. Jesus Christ, Rick. She breathed! She didn't breath. You forced air out of her lungs. That is a dead body. Just because you're a med student - doesn't mean I want to see that. - You asked me to bring you. Okay, fine, you're right. I want to go now. Let's go. Okay, we'll leave. Come here, we'll leave. All right? Let me just go back in and put the body back together and we'll go. All right? Just wait here. Good night, Norma. Jennifer? Jen? Oh, Jesus Christ. Help me! Somebody please help me! - Hello? - Brian? You awake? What? Yeah. I can't stop thinking about her. Her? Norma. Leave it alone, Alison. It doesn't concern you. Is this your cell? No, my dungeon line. How can you stay there? That place creeps me out. It should. It's a hospital. So, I take it you don't want to help me find her? Well, as appealing as that sounds... Later, Brian. Hello? Yes. I need to track down a patient's records. That number doesn't mean anything. That's all I have. Well, then you're up the proverbial creek without a paddle. It's off my cadaver. Cadaver's are shipped across state lines-- No way to track them. Any number is meaningless without the internal code. Where can I get that? The morgue where the body was shipped from. Okay, thank you. What do you make of this? Where did you get this? Blackwell's filing cabinet. Alison, you could get kicked out of school for this. Yeah, I know. Stop. You can't personalize this. I mean, you're not going to be able to-- Have you tried Medical Records? Yeah. It's just an internal code at some morgue. You're not going to be able to do your dissections. Something's wrong. What? She's a missing person? Her family's looking for her? I don't know. I just-- I have to do this. Well, go Google it. What are you studying? - Nothing. - Oh, competitive, are we? "Ooh ooh ooh to touch and feel a girl's vagina and how..." Olfactory, optic, oculomotor, trochlear, trig-- look it's a mnemonic for the cranial nerves. - I get it. - yeah. Great, associating the vagina with dead body parts. This really is the end of my life. You know, not yet. You still have until Monday. You know, maybe we could go do something fun. Brian Cross, are you asking me out? I can't go out with you. I mean, you're an atheist. Oh. It's okay, though. We can still be friends. But we'll have to hide it. Oh Brian, I don't hide. I like everything out in the open. Well, that's easy to say if you don't believe in anything. I believe in me. Worship no false gods. Well, we are gods. I mean, at least, as doctors, we get to pretend. God, Buddha... whatever. It's all semantics. We had to come from somewhere. The human mind is too primitive to understand that "somewhere." So, you buying me dinner, Dr. Cross? Buying? Sure. I know a good cheap place. Brian, I'm not cheap. Professor Blackwell? - Yes? - The first block exams-- they're not really Friday, right? Yes, they really are on Friday, Carlos. Right. While you continue your dissection of the chest, I want you to pay particular attention to the origins And the insertions of the different muscles. For the body is ultimately reducible to this: pulleys... and cables. As far as the soul, that still remains as enigmatic as ever. Right, begin. I'm afraid Rick is no longer with your group. You three will have to manage the best you can. - He dropped out? That was quick. - Why? Personal reasons. Dr. Blackwell, why? His fiance died on Friday night. Carry on. Hello? Rick, are you here? Oh my God. I'm so sorry. You want to talk about it? She... she bled out. She just bled out. We were in the anatomy lab. I tried to help her. I couldn't do anything, though. Do you believe in spirits? It's not important what I believe in. Do you? No. Are you sure? Look, I... I sense things. Spirits? I have feelings... And I know. You know? I know. Alison, I don't understand what "I know" means. Something is wrong with my cadaver, and I can't get it out of my mind. Look, it doesn't make any sense, okay? Especially to me. Every once in a while I get a feeling in my gut, And when I do I'm always right. I look at her body and I feel something is wrong. Alison, what you're experiencing is normal. Normal? You're sensing spirits at unrest. It's common for med students. But there is no rational explanation for how I can know things. There doesn't always have to be. Well, doesn't it sound crazy? Fact is the human mind's too primitive to understand the answers to most of our questions. Alison, these are self-Inflicted wounds. I know. And you're sensing this spirit? - What is wrong? - Jesus! For a second I thought... Well, you're here awfully late, Dr. Blanchard. Do you know where this body came from? I have no idea. Can you trace the numbers on your Polaroids? What Polaroids? Please? No. It's all up here. Table number six-- South America. We import our cadavers from other countries? No. She was an American traveling abroad. I guess she didn't have any family so she got shipped here. - What's this all about? - I need paperwork. Not till you tell me what this is all about. It's about her knife wounds. This woman was either murdered or killed herself. Uh-huh. She's a cadaver. Is there anyone else who would know where this body came from? Just Malcolm. Where can I find him? You can't. He hasn't been here since we prepped the bodies. You know this really isn't your business, Dr. Blanchard. We never exchanged handles. Jumpy. I don't believe this. Alison, let it go. I can't. So what do you got? Thank you, but I don't want to get anybody else involved. I feel like somebody's going to get hurt. I want to be involved with you. - I got nothing. - Alison. No, really, I have nothing. The body came from South America. The airlines have to keep records. I checked already. It's like their cash cow. Every flight has at least three bodies in cargo. There's dead bodies on every flight? Yeah, that bother you? Yes. I'm not the one who doesn't believe in spirits. Multiply three times the number of flights per day and length of time Norma could have been kept and it's-- - It's too much. - Yeah. You think Rick did it? Killed his fiance? No way. Why would he? Why not? Why? Close your eyes. Come on. Just close your eyes. Try to feel the sensations in this room. I'm not liking this. Welcome to my world. What are you doing? Something's in this tank. Help me lock this down. - Oh God. - What is it? Oh. Can you hand me that? Ugh. Grody. It's a cadaver tank. - They keep the bodies in the lab? - Where else would they? Oh crap. What? What? - I think it's stuck. - No. Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on. Okay okay. Whoa, wait. What are you doing? We've got to get the pole out of the tank. No way. No flipping way. Just leave it. What, and run the risk of getting kicked out of school for multiple reasons? Yeah! We're so busted. Oh God, it's freezing. Oh... I still can't reach it. What are you doing? The way I see it, we have two options: one, we tell Blackwell; two, we get this pole out of this godforsaken tank and forget what a bad idea this was. I'm for number two. Oh, I think I got a head. I got a head. Oh, don't pull it out by the hair. - What else am I supposed to do? - Let it go. Brian, it's wearing clothes. - Huh? - Okay, we're going to Blackwell. No wait, I almost got it. I almost got it. Brian, a clothed body-- this just became a crime scene. Oh God, don't touch anything else. Hey, our prints are everywhere. Oh crap. Ugh, eww. Oh my God. I know him. He works for me. His name's Ivan Verbukh. They have to be connected. They? A classmate's fianc died here last Friday. - Is that true? - That is nonsense. That girl had a congenital birth defect. Nothing to do with this. Pure coincidence. - Who was the student? - Rick O'Connor. The main vessel coming out of the heart ripped open. She bled to death. No chance of a homicide. Still, pretty big coincidence. Take their prints. Then you can go. Yes, straight to my office. I want a word with you two. Just need your prints as well, doctor. My prints are in the record, officer. We're going to need them again. When do I get my lab back then? Prints will be processed by tomorrow. The rest-- be done when it's done. You know, I'd like to think I treat you people as intelligent, responsible human beings. And I was hoping that maybe you might reciprocate. We found the body, and that's it. I'm not worried about what you found. I'm concerned about why you were looking in the first place. I feel a strange presence in the lab. Look, I know something's wrong. I knew something was behind those doors, something it wanted me to find. "It"? - Her cadaver. - Oh, really? Yeah. You know, thousands of years ago doctors used to drill holes in people's heads to exorcise their demons. Kinda crazy, huh? I know it sounds absurd, but I know there are a number of people in danger. Enough is enough. We are scientists, not mediums. Got it? Look, I'm not asking you to understand. I don't even understand it myself. Where did you get this? You're not helping yourself. Nobody's going to buy an insanity plea. Your professor says you're a great kid. So, I have to wonder, are you really bright enough to make murder look like a natural death? Why'd you do it? Why'd you kill him, Rick? Did he see something he shouldn't have? Hey, the hospital only has so much hot water. Still not enough to get the smell off. Hold on. All right already. Nice abs. I can't believe you're staying in this place. I'm locking myself in until you come out. Five minutes. This place sucks. Oh, what now? Ugh. - Who is it? - The boogeyman. Hi. Okay. A penny for 'em. You're thinking, "will she let me hop into bed with her?" No, actually, I was thinking-- Well, I was thinking that she needs to go outside... - Oh. - ...so that I can change. - Oh. - Yeah. So, that's not what you want? Well, no I... No. That's so not fair. I'm not going into that hallway alone. You better change. Here? Uh-huh. - You're gonna see me. - I'm not gonna look. - Don't look. - Ooh. I'm not looking. No peeking. - What are you waiting for? - You. Nice. I think you planned this encounter, Dr. Cross. Yeah, well, I figured homicide would be the best way to get up to your hospital room. Oh, and the rubber in your pocket? If I plead guilty, can I throw myself on your mercy? Maybe. Come guard the bathroom. It's two feet away. Men... You get what you want and then you just kick us to the curb. Brian... Turn it off. I'm trying to pee. I can't concentrate. Brian. Brian? Brian? Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian, I can't get out! I can't get out, Brian. Help me! Help! What do you want? What do you want? Alison! Oh my God. It's all right. Hey, it's okay. Look at it. She's trying to send me a message. If she wanted me dead don't you think she would have killed me by now? I want to discuss this with Dr. Blackwell. Why? So he can think I'm crazy? Huh-uh, no way. He's not as understanding as you are. Give him more credit than that. A professor of anatomy, he's been around spirits all his life. Maybe he can offer us a rational explanation. I'll give you a rational explanation. My cadaver wants something from me and I better figure out what it is before she kills me too. Alison, I believe in spirits, but I do not believe in corporeal manifestations. Someone's responsible. Well, that someone is targeting their messages to me. I need your permission. Fine, but I'm coming with you. You have three bodies, all in your lab. I'd think you'd be open to any help you could get. Help, yes. Answers, yes. Not this supernatural mumbo jumbo that you're coming up with. Our cadaver's spirit is not at rest. Oh, please. Look, I'm not unsympathetic. It's just this is totally unacceptable behavior, Caroline. I know it's irrational, but its impact on Alison is real. Well, maybe she's just not suited to this kind of work. I'm not going along with your psychological whims any longer. There's a positive I.D. by the police of the murderer's fingerprints. One Alita Covas. She's an American citizen living in Brazil. Our cadaver came from Brazil. Oh God, here we go. Just get rid of it. Does anybody speak English? You don't have to do that. Medical Records can get it for you. Oh, I'm first year. No I.D. code. Oh, you can use mine. Great, 30 pages in Portuguese. You think Carlos speaks Portuguese? No. We need your help. Look, I already told you, I'm not going to be involved. You're already involved. Look, I can't look at these, all right? We've got a test on Friday. Look, three people who have touched our cadaver have died. If we don't figure this out, we might not be alive on Friday. Come on, you guys are going to be doctors. You know Brazilians don't speak Spanish. Well, your Spanish is more helpful than my German. I'll look at them later then, all right? I'm not going to promise anything though. All right. Thanks. Dr. Blanchard, you've got a new cadaver today. Let's get back to work, shall we? - Thank you. - Okay. We got a new body. Thank God. Alita Covas was a murderer on death row. What? She lures her victims by engaging them in oral sex. What does she have against Norma? She is Norma. Dr. Covas... Dr. Covas? Why do you keep cutting yourself? Why do you keep cutting yourself? So I won't cut others. What does the saying, "people that live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones" mean to you? - What does the saying, "people that... - She's pregnant. She's six months pregnant here. It means if you throw stones you'll break the windows. Does it have any other meaning? It means I'm going to kill you. Now this tape was before that. She was a prostitute who was caught killing her johns. What are your sins, detective? She claims she was eating their filth. This is not about me. This is not a game. You don't like games? And this tape-- this is where she was normal. Do you believe in spirits? It's not important what I believe in. Do you? No. But I sense things. They have feelings. And I know. You know? Yeah, I know. Her first visit she was just looking for help, and by the end she thought she was an Aztec god. In my 15 years of practice I have treated Jesus Christs, Abe Lincolns, George Washingtons, and countless Hitlers. That's what schizophrenia is. She sensed things... like I do. But she's not you. You know, I don't even believe this shit. And yet I'm trying to convince you she was possessed. How's he doing? Not as well as I am. Hey, get rid of the stethoscope and the lab jacket. Rick? - Rick, it's Alison. - Get away from me. What did you and Jennifer do to Norma? I need to know. Something happened that enraged her spirit and we are all in danger. Get him off of me! Don't you need a tetanus shot or something? You should go to the E.R. Just do it. It'll scar. It'll be something for me to remember you by. I'm not going anywhere. Do you know anything about exorcism? Oh, from non-believer to looking for an exorcism. You've come a long way. It was not Rick who did this. ...or you could move in with me. I need my privacy. Oh, really? - So, you want some more practice? - Yes, please. Brian, don't open the door. Brian, don't open it. Excuse me. Who's got their cellphone? Somebody call somebody. Oh my God. - Call 911. - Oh my God. There's so much blood. Ooh. "One year ago, Alita Covas uncovered a gravesite of 50,000 bodies, a sacrificial site to an Aztec god." Tlazolteotl, the god of fertility. And prostitution. Oh my God, she sacrificed her own child. She was crazy. You disturb the body, you enrage the spirit. She enraged 50,000 of them. Thank you. Wait. I want to thank you for protecting me. You're welcome. Come here. Closer. Come here. I want to give you something. Closer. Give this to Dr. Blanchard. Go now. Go. Your work here is done. Dr. Blanchard to psychiatry. - Oh my God. - Dr. Blanchard? - Yeah. - He told me to give this to you. Wait, you have to stay here with me. Dr. Blanchard, come back! Alison, calm down. Calm down. We gotta get out of here. We gotta to get away from her. Blackwell got rid of the body. The spirit stays with the body. Until it's put to rest. Alison! You said you got rid of the body. How? - I dealt with it. - Yes, but how? - I said I dealt with it. - Dr. Blackwell-- if you keep up this nonsense I'm going to have to suspend you. I've lost four people from this department-- two assistants, two students. These murders are real. She's still here, isn't she? You didn't get rid of her at all. Rubbish. If you're still an atheist, I recommend this as a moment to reconsider. Damn it. This will do it. Look out. Let me get it. Here, look out. Here, I got it. Guess there was another. What do we do about the detective? Right now, nothing. Stupid bastard. She's been in here the whole time. - Do you see her? - She's stuck. She's not coming up. Come on. What the hell? - Want to draw straws? - What? Wait, I'll go in. I'm the man. Okay. - Oh shit, it's in my eyes. - Okay. Brian, please hurry. Hurry up. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. Brian! Brian, Brian... Come on, come on. Come on, wake up... Wake up, wake up. Oh my God. Hey. Oh God. Oh my God. - Are you okay? - No. Come on, look at me. Look at me. You okay? Help me. Somebody help me. Help me! Jesus Christ, what's happened here? God damn it, just help me! Maybe you should tell me everything you know. I already have. I'm running for help. Help me. Help us! Please! Somebody help us! Help! Help us... Take him to the O.R. He's lost too much blood. Okay, go. Hurry. Dr. Blackwell. Dr. Blackwell. Rest in peace, bitch. - University Hospital. - Hello. How may I direct your call? Hello? - Hi. - Hi. How do you feel? I can't feel my face. Well, I brought you some flowers. - Yeah? - Yeah. What color are they? You know, your scars are kinda sexy. Okay, so you want the good news or the bad news first? Good. Well, I'm no longer a part of your medical school class. No, it was my choice. I thought if I could understand the body I could somehow understand everything else, but... What's the bad news? We're going to Brazil. We still have to put her body to rest. That's good news. I need a vacation. Ow. No way. We are not going in there. - I'll go. - No no no no. You're staying with me. Now what? I don't know. Is that it? All life ends when the body's put to rest and the soul can pass on. But you burned the body, so where did the soul go? Hopefully... here? Or it's in the lab... with the rest of the unclaimed spirits. Gowns and gloves, ladies and gentlemen. Gowns and gloves. Welcome to Gross Anatomy. Hurry along now. We haven't got all day. That's the ticket.
