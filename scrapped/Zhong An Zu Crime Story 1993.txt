You bastard! Watch how you drive! He strangled me from behind and then his car hit us. Son of a bitch! You're the one who stopped suddenly! If he stopped so suddenly, don't you know how to stop too! - Don't talk to my brother like that! - Or what? Are you two done fighting? With people like you, how are we supposed to kidnap Wong Yat-Fei? Do you think he's a corpse? He's bound to fight back! Shit... When we're in action, remember to switch off all pagers! If something unexpected happens, know what to do! Inspector Chan, Triad Bureau. Gun? Sign here. Go straight in. Thank you. Inspector Chan, it happened - What's the problem? - Tense? Not at all. Then please run through what happened. I'm in a lot of pain... Police! Don't move! Sorry. It's okay. You're still insisting that you're not tense? Fucker! The psychological pressure felt by our colleagues who've had to fire a gun can be divided into three different groups. The first group is worried about hurting the innocent. The second is worried about getting injured during the gunfight. You damn cop, show your face! Out of the way! The last group cannot handle the pressure of having killed someone after firing at the criminal. According to what you've said, your circumstances fit the profile of the last group. This means you cannot handle the pressure of having killed someone by gunshot. Even if you're right, if you were in my shoes, may I ask what you would you do? Me? I would suggest to my superior that I need a holiday and rest for a while. Thank you very much! I don't need to rest. You can write up the report however you want. That's all. Goodbye. I, Ng Kwok-Wah, from Haifeng, Guangzhou, currently head of Wo Lok Tong. I, Ng Kwok-Yan, assistant general manager of Golden Dragon Trading Company. I, Hung Ting-Bong, from Huiyang, Guangzhou, currently a detective in the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau. I, Simen Ting, from Jiayi, Taiwan, director of Xing Hua Brokerage. I, Yen Chi-sheng, from Sichuan, currently the CEO of Red Star Cooperative. We all swear today, March 11, 1990, to be bonded as brothers. We were born on different days, but we pledge to die on the same day. Today, we five brothers swear on our spilt blood to join forces to erase the corrupt businessman, Wong Yat-Fei. May good deeds be rewarded, and evil deeds punished. We act as emissaries of Heaven, to take away his ill-gotten gains. If anyone betrays a brother, then he will be struck by lightning. If anyone betrays our honour, then he will die without leaving a corpse. - Good morning. - Good morning. Superintendent Cheung is looking for you. He asked that you go to his office as soon as you arrive. Okay, thanks. I pay millions in tax every year. You police should do something about it. This is Inspector Chan. This is Mr. Yat-Fei Wong. Mr. Wong suspects someone wants to kidnap him. I want to listen to this. It's not suspicions, I have proof. I sent a staff member to take photos to see if someone was stealing materials from the construction site. We discovered this car has been parked for four consecutive days in front of the construction site gates. These people show up every day. Is this over-sensitivity a result of your being kidnapped last time? There is definitely not any over-sensitivity on my part, only my intuition alerting me to trouble. Your intuition? Correct. Inspector Chan, take a seat. Don't underestimate my intuition. my abilities and hard work. of the basis of my intuition. During the 1967 riots, I made the decision to buy a lot of land. In 1974, only I had the guts to bid for the Shatin Fotan factory area that everyone else thought was worthless. These decisions that made a lot of money were not a result of my foresight, but of my intuition. Mr. Wong, has possibly made you more anxious in the long run? It's possible. So will you do something about it or not? We will investigate. Inspector Chan, follow up this case. What's the matter with you? I've paged you for several weeks, but you haven't replied! I have to work, missy! Bull! What cop case are you working on that keeps you away for more than eight weeks? Don't tell me you got assigned as an undercover cop. What are you after, missy? To know everything about what's happening at the station? I don't know anything. I only know that you're a small time detective with only about HKD 20000 in salary. Why don't you quit? I'll support you. Hah! As if I needed you to support me financially! What about my lack of face then? Well? Are you all sweaty now? Get in the car. Come back and take a bath. I don't have time. I'll come up to your place later. What? What are you up to now? I'm in the middle of something. I'll look you up when I'm done. Work, work, work... Tell me what you're up to! You can't leave tonight if you don't tell me! Nag, nag, nag! Damn you! Get lost! You bastard! You dare to drop me! I'll just go and meet someone else! You think no-one would be interested if I'm willing to spread my legs? There would be a queue from Tsim Sha Tsui to Sha Tau Kok! Asshole! Everyone with money is fleeing as if it were 1997 again. The outlook for luxury flats will worsen for a long time yet. Stephen, I've decided to change the plans; instead of building 2000 sq. Ft. Flats, divide them into four 500 sq. Ft. Flats. I've worked it out. This type of small flat is best suited for small families. I'm sure that it will sell well. Boss, if we split one flat into four, with only 70% of the area being usable, then one can only fit a bed and no wardrobe in the bedroom. Nah, you get what you pay for. If I sell my flats at a low price, even a blue-collar worker can afford a mortgage. The Building Authority won't approve it in time if we make changes now. Don't worry about it. Just do as I say. Change the plans for all the other construction sites too. You can just make the changes while submitting the new plans to the BA. Contact the contractor to have the workers start working nights too. If we sell the flats earlier, we'll make the money back. - The sooner it's finished, the better. - Yes. CID! Don't move! CID! So what if you're CID? Don't move! Police! "Pay our wages"? PAY OUR WAGES - What? - Police. - Can't I collect the wages owed to me? - Move! So what if you're cops? Mr. Wong, it seems that they're not here to kidnap you. It's not that simple. - Work is available; wages aren't! - PAY OUR WAGES QUICK! Wong Yat-Fei, a heartless scoundrel! Work is available; wages aren't! Wong Yat-Fei, a... ...the wages aren't! Wong Yat-Fei, a heartless scoundrel! Work is available; wages aren't! Wong Yat-Fei, a heartless scoundrel! CID! Don't start any trouble! - Come on, guys! - Let's get him! - Stay calm! - Arrest them! Why are you arresting my colleagues! You think you cops can just arrest anyone! Arrest me! Arrest me! Put away your guns! Everyone back up! Back up! See here... Keep your cool, everyone! And if we don't? What the hell?! - Losing my cool doesn't kill me! - Arrest him! Let go! - Fight them! - Fight them! Step back! Step back! Step back! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Listen to me, everyone! Stay calm! Can't you stay calm? - Stay calm?! - How?! We're like you, salaried employees! - I've... - You understand then! ...never experienced the frustrations of not getting paid. But I haven't successfully negotiated a raise either! Nothing's come of all the talk about a stipend for dangerous duties! We want to protest at a rally too! You think we're your enemy?! Then why are you stopping us demonstrating?! As long as you follow the rules and petition to demonstrate, as police, we can even clear the streets for you! Hong Kong is supposedly governed by the law! - That's not true! - That's not true! Superficially, everyone is an equal. The duty of the police is to protect each citizen. I sympathise with you chasing your back wages. But if a rich man makes a call, we still have to show up. So my advice to you is to uphold the law! I don't want someone to take advantage of this situation to stir up trouble, damage private property and injure someone! If that happens, we have to make arrests! Do you understand?! Leave immediately! That makes sense... - Release the man. - Yes, sir. Wong Yat-Fei! You vampire! Making money off our sweat and blood! You will come to a bad end! May your sons be born deformed! This is a matter between the contractors and labourers. Right? Yes. Hey, Inspector Chan. They attacked the police. You're just going to arrest one man? Mr. Wong, this a labour dispute. It has nothing to do with the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau. Why don't I call the Labour Department for you? That would be unnecessary. We'll deal with it ourselves. If you paid wages, then everything would be all right. Release the man. Attention, troops patrolling above. We are now leaving the scene. Continue to monitor the situation. If the workers return, send them away. Don't add to their difficulties. This guy is a renowned cheapskate. - Ah Fei? - Yes? I don't feel well. Have you taken your medicine? I took it already. In that case, why don't you lower the seat and rest for a bit. Okay. Everyone, let's toast Peter, Michael, and David for getting promoted! Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! Wife, we're being tailed. Ah Fei, will you stop being so suspicious and nervous all the time? No, I have to call the cops. Don't call the police at the slightest provocation. We're tax-paying citizens. When there's trouble, we're entitled to police protection. Inspector Chan, this is Wong Yat-Fei. Someone's on my tail. Where are you? I'm on Peak Rd, driving home. I suspect that someone wants to kidnap me. Could it be the construction workers wanting to speak about their wages? Of course not! I've already settled things with the workers. Regardless, come here immediately! Hey, something's up! He's calling someone. Forget it! Let's get him! This is for real again! What's the problem? Kidnapping! Don't hit my husband! Don't hit my husband! Shut up, bitch! Stop! Don't hit my husband! - His wife's here too! - What? His wife's there?! - Help! Help! - Shut up! Why didn't you look before you leaped? What do you think you're doing?! Bro, what should we do? How should I know?! Okay, kidnap his wife too! Be careful! His wife has a weak heart! If she dies, who do we get the money from?! Organised Crime and Triad Bureau. - Superintendent Cheung. - Who's speaking? Eddie Chan of Special Ops. Inspector Chan, please verify your badge number and password. Can't I just report a crime?! We need the password to connect the call... The car coming up behind is a CID car. James, hold him off! Euro Boy, get the hostages away quickly! Don't let him get too close! Organised Crime and Triad Bureau. I'm Eddie Chan of Special Ops. I'm on Peak Road... Inspector Chan, please verify your badge number and password first. Hello, Police Station? I'm an ordinary citizen. I want to report a crime. Please clearly describe the situation. I'm on Peak Road. I saw criminals kidnap a man and drive away. They're going downhill now. Please send someone to catch them! We'll immediately send someone to investigate. Thank you! A citizen reported that he saw criminals kidnap someone on Peak Road. PC 48823 responding. I'm rushing to the scene now. PC 48262 responding. Still on our tail, huh? Quickly shake him off! If the cop catches us, we're fucking finished! There's a traffic cop, shake him off! Stop your car! We killed a traffic cop! Fuck! This is turning into a big mess! You morons! I might as well... Stop your car! Stop your car! Two policemen were injured on Peak Road. I'm taking one to the hospital now. The other one's still at the crime scene. Quickly send someone to deal with a medical emergency! PC 62129 responding. I'm now on the way to Peak Road. I'm here! We see our target. Buddy, help me clear the traffic to get to the Army Hospital. Attention all units! The injured policeman is bleeding heavily. Please notify off-duty policemen to rush to the Army Hospital to be ready for a blood transfusion at any time. Traffic is heavily congested between Central and Admiralty. From Happy Valley, get on the Eastern Corridor. Not much traffic. We're now at the scene of the injured policeman on Peak Road. Did something happen to Ah Wing? I don't know. I've only heard about Little Hak. Where is the emergency room? - That way, that way! - Quick! - This way! - Over there! Over there! Please get out of the way! Call for a doctor! Make way! Make way! - Make way! - Make way! Make way! - Call for a doctor! - Make way! - Doctor, please save him! - Save him! He's lost a lot of blood! - Let's stop his bleeding first. - All right. Sir, don't go in there! You're also bleeding! Don't worry about me! Save him! Stop his bleeding! That's my patient. Let me see what's happening. - Save him! - You can't go in there! Hey, calm down! You're bleeding! - No matter what, save him! - Okay, okay. - Someone's saving him now. - Save him! - Save him... - Calm down! Steady... Steady... Stop his bleeding first. - Alright. - Inspector Chan! Inspector Chan! Chi-Keung is on the way! - Please make way! - Please make way! - Excuse me! Excuse me! - Make way! Make way! Make way! Dr. Chan, what's his condition? A head wound. A few stitches and he'll be fine. Sir! How are my colleagues? They're in the operation rooms. They'll be fine. - I have to check on them. - Don't move around. - The wound will reopen. - Get out of my way! Hey, hey! - At least let me remove the needle. - Eddie! Let the doctor remove it first. Do you realise that you lost a lot of blood too? It's best if you rest a while. I go out and risk my life! Two of my colleagues still need emergency medical care! You're just deskbound, what do you know! With your current mental state, you're unfit for duty right now. You have to take a leave of absence, and let me monitor you for a while. To you, it's monitoring. To me, it's suspension of duty! Your superior wants a report about you. Look at how tense you are now! How do you expect me to write it up? Write whatever you want! You don't have to use my superior officer to lean on me! Chi-Keung! Chi-Keung... Chi-Kueng! Chi-Keung! - No! - Chi-Keung! Chi-Keung! Chi-Keung! Doctor, doctor! I'm Lau Hak-ming's wife! Where's my husband? - How is he? - He's still under emergency care. - We'll try our best. - Good. Good. Thank you very much, doctor. Move her to the front and get him on the boat. She isn't dead, is she? - Step on the pedal. - Okay. Anything? Let's set sail quickly! Clean up the surroundings, and push the car into the sea. Unless absolutely necessary, don't call me in the near future. Yesterday evening, April 16, at approximately 6:30pm, Hong Kong real estate developer Wong Yat-Fei and his wife were kidnapped on the Peak Road while on the way home. Before this occurred, Wong Yat-Fei called me, relating his suspicions of a possible kidnapping. After the call, I immediately drove to the scene. I ran into the criminals that kidnapped Wong Yat-Fei on Peak Road. They drove 4 different cars Mr. And Mrs. Wong Yat-Fei's car was a cream Mercedes Benz. I tried to stop them, but I failed in the end. In the process, two traffic policemen were hit by the criminals' cars and seriously injured, one of whom has already passed away. The criminals released Mrs. Wong by the seafront off Apleichau, and demanded that she ready a ransom in three days. The ransom demand is USD 60000000. - USD 60 million? - That's a lot... That's HKD 500 million. Listen up, everyone! The first step now is to have the Criminal Intelligence Bureau install bugs in Mrs. Wong's residence and her usual haunts to monitor all calls 24 hours a day, paying close attention to all criminal activities. Second step: Teams 1 and 2 of Operations will do a full coverage blanket search of all possible hideouts in Hong Kong, Kowloon, New Territories, and outlying islands. Third step: Find information on all the top Triad car racers in Hong Kong. The rest of you will go to hostess bars, gambling dens, drug houses, and love hotels to conduct surprise searches, and arrest every possible suspect for questioning. Do you understand? Master Hung. Hey, I haven't seen you in a while. Why are you working so late? Yeah, I can't believe I've been recalled at this late hour. All holidays have been cancelled. Please report back to your police station immediately. Yes. There's a case that requires immediate attention. These are the names and addresses of the shops that Mrs. Wong frequents. Master Hung. Hi, hi. Superintendent Cheung! Wow! You've gained weight since I last saw you a while ago. Hey! I can say the same for you. Hey, Inspector Chan! Let me introduce you to Master Hung. He's the guy who cracked Wong Yat-Fei's first kidnapping, so that's why I invited him to help us out. I hope I can learn a lot from you. I heard from the others that you were very brave today. I was just following your example, that's all. Superintendent Cheung. I'm going to step outside to answer this call. It may be a call from an informer. Okay. Hey, follow up on this for me, okay? Master Hung. We're in trouble. There's a mainland gunboat. It looks like it's approaching us. What should we do now? Try your best to evade it! We're in the middle of the sea. Where do you expect us to hide? If you can't evade them, jump overboard! Use your brain! Just don't let them see the kidnap victim. I'm in a meeting at the police station. Don't bother me any more. You won't deal with anything because you're in a meeting? Stop the vessel for an inspection! What are you doing here? I'm a fisherman, not a smuggler. I'm going back to Hong Kong early tomorrow morning. There's nothing in the hold. Don't make any more noise, or else I'll drown you! You've crossed the border already. - Once dawn comes, go back quickly. - Thank you. Troops, dismissed! The troops are dismissed. Let's go! Inspector Chan! Hello? I want to speak to Mrs. Wong. This is she. If you want to save your husband's life, then withdraw USD 60 million from the Wanchai branch of Chase Manhattan Bank at 10am tomorrow. Chase Manhattan Bank. I'll call you on your mobile then. Bring more batteries. Hello? Hello? Rewind it so I can listen to it. Keep two people here to listen to the calls. Notify the ground troops, the aerial troops, the wiretap team, - and Operations to deploy at the bank. - LA PRIME FACIAL SALON - Operations, copy. - Lower, okay? More towards me. Operations, team four and five. Monitor the streets around the bank. If the criminals call, immediately report to all units. Hello? - Is this Mrs. Wong? - This is she. This is the wiretap team calling HQ. I'm now transmitting to all units the dialogue between Mrs. Wong and the criminals. Have you prepared all that I requested last night? I've prepared everything. Now I'm following your instructions, and I'm on my way to the bank in Central. I'll be there in five minutes. Listen carefully, don't go to Central. Go to the Admiralty branch now. - They changed the meeting point! - Okay, I'll go there now. Man the original post in case they go back there. The rest, come with me. Calling HQ. Requesting additional support. Mobilise all backup personnel to the area around the Chase Manhattan Bank in Admiralty to monitor all activities. We're heading there now. Backup ground troops have now arrived at the Chase Manhattan in Admiralty. Mrs. Wong's car is now on the Wanchai bridge, going towards the Admiralty. Hello? Mrs. Wong, expect a call from me later. Do not wonder who I am. Why is he speaking Mandarin? We traced the first call. It wasn't from Hong Kong. Continue the trace. You trace the origin of the Mandarin call. Mrs. Wong has now arrived at the bank, but the target has not arrived. Go into the bank, and covert the USD 60 million into 50 cashier's cheques. Mrs. Wong entered the bank. I'll be in touch later. Good morning, Mrs. Wong. Please withdraw USD 60 million from my account. Once she withdraws the money, the criminal should show up. - What's the situation now? - There's another incoming call. Mrs. Wong's exiting from a side door. Go the United Chinese Bank three blocks away. Eddie, Mrs. Wong is now going to United Chinese Bank, the one that's three blocks away. I've done all that you've asked. I converted the cashier's cheques. You said to change banks, and I changed banks. I only want to speak briefly with my husband. Why won't you let him talk? Mrs. Wong's on the overpass, walking towards United Chinese Bank. Your husband is very safe right now. As soon as we get the money, we'll release the hostage. Don't try any tricks, or I won't be able to guarantee your husband's safety. I won't try anything. Please don't harm him. Don't alarm Mrs. Wong in any way. You're all tailing her too closely. Move back a few steps. Not all of you! Act more naturally when tailing her. I traced the first call to Shenzhen. Get me the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau. Yes. Hello. Superintendent, we have the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau on the phone. Hello, Commissioner Lai, we have to bother you again. Ah, you're too polite. We're happy to help in any way. Beetle, beetle. Mrs. Wong has already entered your monitoring area. Pay attention to all suspicious-Iooking people around Mrs. Wong. Hey, let me get it. Hello. Please tell Superintendent Cheng that call in Mandarin came from Taiwan. Okay, thank you. What's up? Have you traced the call in Mandarin yet? I haven't heard back from them yet. Now, I want you to deposit the cashier's cheques into United Chinese Bank, Taipei branch. - 3032... 377068... - Taipei branch? What account? - and 377-069... - Input what's she's saying. In case Mrs. Wong comes out the bank again, those whom she has seen must change their clothes. I'm now changing. Continue keeping an eye on Mrs. Wong. We've traced it. The money has been deposited in more than ten accounts in the Taipei branch of United Chinese Bank. Call Taiwan's National Police Administration. Hello. Commissioner Shen, please. Speaking. Is something the matter? Commissioner Shen. This is Hong Kong Police OCTB's Superintendent Cheung calling. Commissioner Shen, the ransom money of a kidnapping has been deposited into more than ten accounts in the United Chinese Bank in Taipei. Could you please look into it and freeze the money? Superintendent Cheung, as the kidnapping didn't happen in Taiwan, under our laws, we have no right to interfere in commercial transactions. Commissioner Shen, I suspect that these criminals are terrorists and will use this money to fund illegal activities in Taiwan. Please don't be so impatient. I'm transferring the funds now. - Yes, yes, yes... - We're remitted USD 30 million. - USD 30 million is already remitted. - Continue to transfer the funds. Don't fool around with your husband's life. Please don't worry. I'm already remitting the money to you now. Once you receive the money, remember to release my husband. The public phone on Meilin St. Thank you. Superintendent Chueng, we've traced the call from Shenzhen. - Superintendent Cheung - What's up? The accounts in Taiwan are listed under four people's names. They said they would fax the details of the accounts to us later. Eddie, listen up. Stop Mrs. Wong from remitting the money. I don't care what you have to do to stop her, but once all the money has been transferred, I'm afraid we'll lose our connection to the criminals. I've now arrived at the bank. - Sir, you can't enter this area. - OCTB! - OCTB. - Sir, you can't enter this area. - Here... - Excuse us. We're CID. - Excuse us. We're CID. - Hey! We're working on a case. Can't you call back later? My mobile's battery is dying. I'll be quick about changing the battery. Don't try anything. I'll call you in a minute. Hey, mister... - He's looking for me. - Mrs. Wong. The police need you to stop remitting the money. Mrs. Wong. Even after the criminals receive the money, they may kill the hostage at any time for safety's sake. I don't have any other option. What do you want me to do? First you tell me to pay the ransom, now you tell me not to pay. I don't care! I'll do anything as long as I can save my husband! Mrs. Wong. We're transferring the fourth remittance. The amount is USD14 million. Continue the transfer. Once all the money is remitted to Taiwan, we'll lose the criminals, and won't solve the case. I don't care. As long as my husband comes back. Solving the case is police business! Mrs. Wong. Over the years, there have been 15 cases where the hostages were killed even after the ransom was paid. I don't want your husband to be the 16th victim. Do you believe the criminals or the police? Stop the remittance. Mrs. Wong has stopped remitting the money. Wire tap team, continue monitoring the situation 24 hours a day. Ground troops, continue covertly protecting Mrs. Wong. Damn bitch! Playing tricks on me! - That way! - Go! Go! Halt! Stay still! Hello? Hello? Hello?! Superintendent Chueng, Taiwan has faxed the details of the account holders. Ah Fei, what will happen now? I don't even know if USD 30 million is going to save you or not. Ask them to help us. We have no diplomatic relations with them, and there aren't any extradition laws. The only solution is to send someone over. But who? Superintendent Cheung. I know Taiwan quite well. Why don't I go? Okay. I'll send someone to assist you. Hey! Do you have to be this nervous? I can never believe that such a big piece of metal can fly in the sky. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't afraid. Hey, why don't you treat this as an official expense? Once we arrive in Taipei, we'll find a nice hotel, then have a good meal. Look at the data. Any clues about who this man is? This man is called Simen Ting. Do you know him? No. I've never seen him. I wonder if the Taiwanese are willing to help or not. Who cares. As I said, let's enjoy ourselves for two nights and consider that mission accomplished. Sir, there's air turbulence. Please return to your seat. - I'm CID. I'm interrogating a suspect. - Okay. Do you always take things this lightly? What's the point of being so serious? I've given 30 years of my youth to the Royal Police force. Tell me, what have I received in return? - Then what do you want? - I don't know. I only know that every night I wake up from my dreams feeling that I've let myself down. When I first came out of the academy, energetic and gung ho, I was even braver than you are now. - When you're exchanged gunfire, - Attention, all passengers... - when you've shot someone... - please return to your seats - I bet it scared you! - and fasten your seatbelts. I dare you to say that you weren't afraid! Sir, it's dangerous if you don't return to your seat. I'm used to danger. If it isn't dangerous, I want my money back. Hey, take a seat and fasten your seatbelt. Don't be afraid. The air stewardesses often make a fuss over nothing! - Hey! Are you okay? - Thank you. - Captain Ko, the guns are in there. - Put them away. - How are you? I'm Eddie Chan. - How are you? - This is Inspector Hung. - Why don't you give me the papers. Please go ahead. We don't have diplomatic relations. We don't have official ties with Interpol, so this... - Please speak. - Start the car. - Please get in the car. - Captain. Okay. This is Captain Ko. Captain, a report. There's a group of people at a house on Huahsi St. One of them looks like Simen Ting. I understand. Attention Thunderbolt team, be at the scene to keep an eye on them. It's now 6:30. All teams, meet up at the HQ at seven. Please get in the car. - Copy. - Copy, Captain. Copy. Form a deployment plan immediately. You all, return to the HQ first. - What's the current situation? - Oh, nothing much. This is the key to your hotel room. Deliver the deployment plan to the Hsihua Hotel immediately. We can only help you in an unofficial capacity. You don't have jurisdiction here. Retire early tonight. Don't go out on the town. I'll contact you tomorrow. See you. - See you. - See you. Let's go. Could you please put them in our room? Hey, where are we going? Huahsi Street, didn't you hear them? When we get there, then what? We'll decide once we get there. We want to get to Huahsi Street. We've received the signal. Don't alert the criminals to our presence for now. Wait for orders. - Continue the surveillance. - When you're mobilised, - And don't alert them. - be especially careful, - I understand. - And don't harm innocent citizens. Captain. Everything is ready. Have I made myself clear?! Understood. Let's move! Stand guard. Same upstairs. I'm rich! I'm rich! Black Dragon, although the money is in our hands, what happens now determines whether we can spend it. Count carefully! Count carefully! Wow, that idiot was really easy! - Don't be alarmed. - Hush. - Hey, what's happening? - Don't be nervous, it's nothing. Damn, when you're womanising, you give 100%, but when you're working, you're dragging your feet! Simen Ting, you're too timid! We'd do better by playing it safe. We're ready, Thunderbolt team. Brother, there's loads of cops outside! Damn! Hide the money quick! Hurry up! Hurry up! - Police, halt! - Watch out, it's the cops! Go! There're cops! Damn! Let's go! Let's go! Halt! Police! - We're armed! - Halt! - Isn't that Simen Ting? - What? Hey! Go this way, let's go! What's happening up there? Brother, let's go this way! Is there any more left? Look around! This way! - There's two left. - Use them, quickly! Quick! I'll blow you to bits! - Brother, where shall we go? - That way! That way! Hey, take it slow. Don't leave, I'll cry! - Black Dog, kill him! - Okay! Let's go! You don't know the meaning of death! Get him! Hey! Why are you still standing there? Come and give chase! Okay! I'm coming! It's your turn! Go that way! Hurry up! It's all cops! Why didn't you tell me about all this earlier? I didn't know! Think of an idea or we're both done for! I'm thinking! If you don't help me, I'll spill everything! He almost dragged me down with him! You two, come down here! MINISTRY OF INTERIOR, CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION BUREAU I hope that you cooperate, and tell me the truth. Why did you chase him? Why did you have to kill him? Firstly, he was connected to a kidnapping in Hong Kong. Secondly, a good citizen can make a citizen's arrest of a criminal. It happened too quickly! - I just reacted! - Why were you chasing that person? I didn't want to chase him! My superior wanted me to chase him! I already told you. You don't have jurisdiction here! You've violated our laws! You have to write an apology! No! My superior has always been an impulsive kind of guy! Inspector Chan. I now formally charge you with violating our national security law. We were too rash in our zeal to crack the case. We've caused you a lot of trouble. I'm very sorry. We were wrong. Why were you chasing that man? Why did that man die in front of you? I request that you let me call Hong Kong. Master Hung, thank you for cooperating with us. That's what I should do. Why did you chase that person? Tell me. What's your relationship with that person? Tell me now! Was he working with both of you? You Hong Kong police have the most corrupt members, right? If you don't help me, then I'll spill everything! Hong Kong has corrupt police, so does Taiwan. What? What did you say? What? You dare to insult police in Taiwan? There are so many Hong Kong degenerates who break the law, then come to Taiwan to escape the heat! If you don't help me, then I'll spill everything! Thank you for releasing them. Don't worry, I'll punish them. Good, I will give you a reasonable account. Okay, Okay... thank you, Comissioner Shen. Bye. Immediately search Simen Ting's Hong Kong office. - Sir. - Thank you. Thanks. Despite the mess, at least we've achieved something. - Sir, who are you looking for? - CID, we're here to search the place. - Our boss isn't here. - Your boss is dead. Don't touch anything! Don't touch the computers! Sit! Sit! It's past visiting hours. I'm from OCTB, what number bed is Lau Hak-ming in, please? Bed number eight. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Manager, this is Inspector Chan, he wants to see you. - What is it? - I'm Eddie Chan from OCTB. This is a warrant. Inspector, do you want everything from no. 1 to 100? Hello? Master Hung. There's a Eddie Chan who's here to inspect the data of pagers no. 1-100. No. 1-100? That means that he's looking into mine too. What should we do? Erase all the data on me. Don't even leave a word. Hey, what's wrong with the computer? You're right. I don't know. Inspector, you can't mess with it. Why is this happening? Inspector Chan, I'm so sorry. The computers are going haywire again. Gaga, urgent, Hoi Saat Hostess Club. See you at 369. It's gone. It's always breaking down. I want to change them, but they're out of stock, so we're just using them for now. Once the computers are fixed, I might be able to retrieve the data for you. Inspector Chan, what are you looking for? You can tell me. Maybe I can help you. If I'm able to help you, I definitely will. Inspector Chan. Hello, Little Seh Ming. Do you know a wise guy called Euro Boy? I've never heard of him. Let me ask around. Let me know as soon as possible. Also, is there a code or slang called 369? 369? What 369? Never mind. How many Hostess Clubs are there in Hong Kong? There's only one in Tsim Sha Tsui. Okay. If you find out anything, call me immediately. That cop caused us to lose the money that was in front of us. Okay, let's make him lose everything then. He murdered Simen Ting. Let's chop up Wong Yat-Fei into bits, and feed him to the sharks. We don't have to be so righteous. Master Hung, why don't you say something? We can't let go of this affair. Earlier, you made two mistakes. Now that the hostage is at sea, there's no set position, no target. That cop isn't a superman. There's no way that he can just find him. Although Simen Ting is a goner, getting a ransom from Taiwan has proven to work. After overcoming these two difficulties, we shouldn't just give up. As long as the police can't find the hostage, we can still lean on the wife. If she is willing to pay once, she'll be willing to pay again. Just wait and see. Sir, we've found this photo at Simen Ting's office. The Criminal Intelligence Bureau says it's worth looking into. Why don't you say something nice to your wife? She says that she really misses you. Why don't we record you talking to prove that you're still alive? Get up! Hey, Gaga! You're early. I'm free, so I'm early. May I ask if you are Miss Gaga? Yes. Who's asking? I'm Inspector Chan of OCTB. It's about Detective Hung. We would like to ask you to cooperate on an investigation. What investigation? Why don't you just arrest that bastard? This is Amy. Master Hung, there's an Inspector Chan from OCTB here to see Gaga. That fatso, he's bad news! I know all about his shit! What do you want to know? You've come to the right girl! Gaga, why are you back here so early? I'm hitting on a guy, okay? I thought you had a guy already. That was a cop. That's right up your alley. I thought your favourites were cops. - Bad girls love cops. - We'll see. Gaga is very difficult to woo, Inspector. What have you got? I like to chase the difficult ones. I bought a dress yesterday that was so beautiful. Where's Gaga? Gaga's inside. You're his woman. You should know a lot about him. You think I'm his woman? Inspector, do you think you're my man, then? I heard that he's hanging out with some really influential people recently. Really? What do you want to know? I'll tell you everything - and that's a lot! Have you seen this person? Up this close? How am I supposed to see clearly? Bobo, lure that cop away. This guy is dead. If you pronounce his death this quickly, then you must know him. Gaga, mama-san is looking for you. I'll see you later, handsome. You've spilt my drink! How are you going to make up for it? You're wet. Let me help you dry yourself. Gaga, you have to help me this time. That kid out there wants to ruin me. Hey, listen to me! Whatever he asks about me, just say absolutely nothing. Why should I help you? Who am I to you? We're not married! All I did was sleep with you! You've slept with plenty of women! Is whatever is between us that simple? Really? Look at this! Read this before you say anything! I bought a house on the Gold Coast of Australia and I put your name on the deed too. What else do you want me to do? I don't care about this! I'm going to tell him everything! Gaga, if you tell on me, I'll be a dead man. I'm begging you for a favour, okay? You think you're a big man because you're a cop? Apologise. - Apologise! Apologise! - You want to run away? Are you okay? You, don't go! Inspector, how careless you are. You're falling short everywhere. Don't be mad. I'll buy you a drink to make it up to you. Inspector, I'm very sorry. Don't leave! Either compensate me or apologise! Get out of my way! You dare be so cocky with my superior! Am I invisible?! Inspector Chan. Gaga, Inspector Chan wants to talk to you. You think that we've made up, bastard! You don't have to pretend to be a good guy! Inspector, why don't I tell you all his secrets. This guy, he doesn't close the door when he goes to the toilet. And he doesn't wear underwear. I know a lot more dirt on him too. Why don't I tell you back at the station? I'm going to go get my handbag. - Say something nice to your wife! - I can't deal with this! Tell her to quickly pay up, then we'll release you! Do you hear me?! - Say it! - Okay. Sum-yue, I'm Ah Fei. We haven't been able to see each other in a long time, but... You have an ashtray. Why not put your butts in it? Inspector Chan, see if this is the person you're looking for. I heard that he quit two jobs. He'll be fleeing to the mainland tomorrow morning. From the Kowloon Railway Station. Thank you. Here. - Contact me if you have anything. - Okay. Bye. Wait for me here. The target has appeared. Get ready. CID! Come on! Come on! Hey! CID! Come with us back to the station. Let's go! Halt! Cops are beating me up! Cops are beating me up! Take him back! Let's go! Let me go! Who do you think you are? Police brutality! Let me go! Let's go! I won't walk! I won't walk! I won't go anywhere! Go help them! I'd rather die than move from here! Take him away first! Euro Boy, this is the OCTB! Don't try anything here! Get away from me! Get away from me! I have something to say! - Get away from me! - Let him talk! Get away from me! Get away from me! Inspector Chan, I'll spill everything! I'll be your prosecution witness! Bring the man and the machine to the big room! Back to the big room? You're joking?! What if you beat me to a pulp? If you have something to say, say it here. - This man looks like a scumbag. - Yeah. Give me the key! That's more like it! - Don't hit his face. - Yeah, or else we'll be in trouble. Let me deal with you! Attacking a policeman? - Are you okay? - Keep away! Don't think that cops are a big deal. Fight me one-on-one! I'll now charge you with one more offence. Seriously destroying government property without any reason. Bring him to the big room! Serves you right, asshole! You shouldn't play tricks on Inspector Chan! You scared of living? - Phoebe, where's Inspector Chan? - He's inside. Well, do you want to file a complaint? Let him sign it. Sign it. Sign it quickly! Inspector Chan, Euro Boy is my informant. What's his crime? I suspect that he had a hand in kidnapping Wong Yat-Fei. You bastard! So it was you who kidnapped Wong Yat-Fei! I didn't... Are you accusing the police of framing you?! Yes. Yes. - He even says "yes." - They even beat me up. You say that they even beat you up, huh? Do you want to file a complaint? Do you want a medical examination?! I'm asking if you need a medical examination?! Yes! I want to file a complaint that they beat me up! - Don't make things up! - You did beat me up! Don't! You want to kill the witness?! Bastard, if you were in my hands, you'd be a dead man! Why don't we take him to the hospital first? I still have to interrogate him. Inspector Chan, you know that he's my informant. I should be the one responsible for him. - Now that's he's badly injured... - No! Without my order, no-one may take this man out of this room! What are you two doing? Come with me now! Have someone protect him Without my order, no-one takes him anywhere! Get to your duties immediately! Go quickly! Listen up, you two! There's been a new development on the Wong Yat-Fei case. According to the Criminal Intelligence Bureau's report, we may know the whereabouts of the hostage. Get going! According to our investigation, it's a disused smuggling ship. People have been seen entering and exiting. Eddie and Master Hung, go on board and take a look. Teams one and two search the surrounding islands. Notify me immediately if you find anything. Start the operation immediately! Start the operation! - Inspector! That door's almost ready. - Okay. You two, take a look over there! What? - We're searching over there. - Over there? That way! - We're searched that way already. - Search again! Let's search again! Inspector Chan, we're going to take a look outside. Okay. I'll be just behind you. with Inspector Chan? Inspector Chan went up the chimney. - Find anything? - Nothing. Back to work. We haven't found anything yet. I'm now going to the surrounding islands to take a look. If anything happens, notify me immediately. Is anybody here? Is anybody here? Hey, is anybody here? MASTER HUNG KIDNAPPED WONG Don't try to erase it! I wrote those words! Don't move! It really was you! Take off your belt! That's right, I did it. I respected you. I have always thought of you as heroic. But you would rather be a criminal! Inspector Chan, don't get so worked up. We can take our time and talk it over. I've been a cop for years, I've seen it all. In this world, the good guy doesn't get rewarded. We as cops can be killed any minute. There's no guarantee for our lives! Why don't you pretend that you never saw anything? I'll give you half of my share of the money. You should be happy then. Don't move! I'll pretend I didn't hear that. I suspect that you're involved with the kidnapping of Wong Yat-Fei. You may remain silent, but anything you say may be used in a court of law against you. Come over here! Hold me! Hold me! - Stay firm on your feet! - Die! You bastard! You won't be able to escape! Is anybody here? Is anybody here? Calling Superintendent Cheung, over. - What happened? - He just shot me. Master Hung was shot by Inspector Chan. - I think he must be mad! - Yeah, yeah. What? Send him to the hospital first. Where's Inspector Chan? Inspector Chan is missing, over. Find him immediately! I have argued with him in the past, but he shouldn't shoot me over something like that! We found him! Inspector Chan is over here! They found Inspector Chan. Inspector Chan! Catch! There he is! Where is Inspector Chan? He's in the sea. The rescue unit is getting him. Call an ambulance and send him off for a check-up. Hey! Send someone to stop Master Hung immediately! Don't worry about me. Take care of your health, do you understand? Otherwise, I will worry. I dine well and lodge comfortably here. They have not tortured me either. That's Mr. Wong's voice. It's better if you follow his instructions. Once they get the money, they will naturally release the hostage. We'll then be able to catch them all in one go! Master Hung is involved in the kidnapping of Wong Yat-Fei. - Really? - Superintendent Cheung, arrest him! If we delay, Wong Yat-Fei's life will be in danger. Okay, I understand.

What are you doing? - Come to the ambulance. - Go with them. - I said I'm fine! Where's Master Hung? Master Hung's gone off somewhere. What? If it was me, I'd run away too. Why don't you believe me?

Hello. Master Hung, we found Inspector Chan. Superintendent Cheung wants you back at HQ immediately to write a report. I understand. Mrs. Wong, something needs my attention. Excuse me. Guard this room well. Don't let anyone else come in. Okay. Younger Twin, my role may have been revealed, but I'm not sure. For safety's sake, pack up everything and I'll see you in 369. That's all. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Wong. This is Eddie Chan from OCTB. Listen to me. You can't remit any more money to the criminals. I've already remitted everything. I don't care. Discuss it with Master Hung.

You don't understand the agony I go through as a cop! I risk my life at every turn! I work extremely hard, I get a pitiful salary. It's barely enough to get by!

Stop for an inspection, or else we'll fire! You're not answering the phone at such a critical moment? Master Hung, what's wrong with you? If they get on board, they'll see the hostage. What should we do? Kidnappers are executed in China. What shall we do? Don't fire, we're stopping the boat! Comrade, we're here to make the collection. - Okay. - Thank you. Come on!
