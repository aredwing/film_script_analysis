 

                        Alice. You're looking thin. In a bad way. In a bad way? I'm fine. I'm just a bit tired. That's all. The reason we're all a little off is because as a society, we don't live in villages and communities anymore. That's what Rufus, my guru, says. A modern pandemic. I spent some time in Mystique and Cottonwoods recently, You know, rolfing is kind of amazing. But others can't afford to go to-- Uh, apparently TM is gonna come back. TM? Uh, transcendental meditation. No? It's like, um... mantra-based... thing, you know? You can practice it anywhere, once you get the hang of it. But Rufus told me that one of he students was doing it on the tube. There he was, meditating. When he became enlightened on the Circle line. So he just went around and around and around and around Yeah, I remember that. God, it was awful. I think it's maybe just this whole Charlie thing, yeah. Maybe I should just go back to Heidelberg for a while. Ooh, why? What's happening there? Nothing. It's just where I'm from. Oh! Oh! I just can't rate Rufus. He carries his runes in a plastic bag. Heidelberg? That's crazy. # How do you preach the word # If you don't know how to read? # # When they hold your soul once you sign the deed # # Would the sun still rise if there was no one around? # # That I'll summon an eclipse on my way to the lord # # Let him go, let him go # Let him go from me # Let him go, let him go # Let him go from me # Jesus for the jugular # One at a time # Jesus for the jugular # One at a time # Ain't nobody ever gonna-- ever have to die # # Jesus for the jugular # One at a time # Ain't nobody ever gonna-- ever have to die # # Jesus for the jugular # One at a time # Ain't nobody ever gonna-- ever have to die # One for you... One for me. This stuff is gonna keep us young. It'll be just you and me left. Wouldn't that be nice? In theory. This stiff is gonna keep us firm, 'cause that's very important. This says it can turn back time. Wouldn't that be nice? We are gonna cover each other in this stuff tonight, and fall asleep in each others arms, and when we wake up, it will be the beginning again, and we can do everything differently. I could, anyway. I've already started. I went to a meeting this morning. That's wonderful. I get it, this time. The whole rehab thing didn't work, because you go away and it's fine being clean, in some hospital, in Switzerland, but then you get home, and you don't know what to do with yourself. So I think, for me, it's just better to do the 12 step stuff here. You look good. Look at my eyes. They look normal. See? What did you have for breakfast? Ice cream. Some habits are harder to break than others. But you didn't eat anything. Show me your teeth. If you stay tonight, and make me breakfast, I'll eat it. How kind of you. Anything for you. You see anyone? No. I miss you. Good. Lunch, Alice. Nice party. There's less people here today than there was yesterday. Listen, have you seen Alice? She left early. You didn't. She wouldn't. You surprised? Disappointed. To be honest, I don't know what you see in her anyway, apart from the obvious. The obvious is quite enough, thank you very much. Do you know who was here? Who? Orna. Orna? Yeah! Not looking bad, either. What happened? Nothing, why? Hi, Suzi. You said you were gonna cool. I thought Orna had a husband now. No mention of husbands. I expect it's past tense. Past tense. What? Who are we talking about? Orna. Orna's back. Where are you going? No one in my room, Betty. No one! Hello. So, I was thinking. I have a few auditions this week, but maybe we could go with the weekend, if your house is free. Well, my mother's on a rampage. She's redoing any parts of the house that my father ever set foot in, which is most of it. We could stay in a hotel, maybe. Um, you know... go for walks, swimming. I could drive. Yeah, we could take your car, if it's fixed. Charlie. Why did you even bother saying all that stuff to me? I'm just tired. Fuck's sake. We spent the whole morning, talking about a sponsor, and meetings, and it was all fucking bullshit. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. He's a junkie. Move on. Everyone does drugs. It's just a question of perspective. It just can't be a be-all and end-all. And what's your be-all and end-all, Bells? I'm curious. Well, I have my dreams, and I don't just mean when I'm asleep. Stop! Stop it! What are you doing? It's for you. It'd look cute on you. What is your problem? Everyone knows you're a total klepto. No I'm not! Whatever. It's just a bit of fun. as long as you do something nice for somebody else, just to balance it out. I mean, it's just a big shop we're stealing from. And what are you gonna do to balance that out? I was thinking maybe after this I could go and feed some ducks. Or I could put the bottles out for recycling. Oh, my god. I saw this on Orna's site. It was, like, twice the price. Rip-off. You're paying for all that lilac tissue it comes wrapped in. You're paying for her Restylane habit. Or her ex-husband's Restylane habit. Saw a picture of him on the internet. He looks ridiculous. Somebody told me he's dead. It's possible. There's about ten of us here. Okay. See you soon. Bye. You're so jealous. Look at them. They're more like wolves than women. That was Bella. She wants us over there as soon as possible. Suzi... Amazing. Come on! Just don't get it. She's so annoying. What's to get? She's beautiful. She's young. Young is the new beautiful. Do you really think so? No. Then why did you say that? Well, he said it. Why would you say that? I don't know. I just kind of felt like it. But he had three Asian wives. Complete Asiaphile. One from Thailand, one from Japan, one from China, and there I was, thinking it was like romantic love or some-- Hi. Hi! I didn't know you were back. You know Lulu. I heard you were back. Well, it's so good to be back. There you are! I've been looking all over for you! Orna, this is Suzi. Hi! Orna! Oh, my god! It's nice to meet you. You left before I think we got together, actually. How are you? Felix, I'm gonna get a drink. Do you want anything? No, I'm good. I'm good. I'll see you in a bit. What was all that about? All what? Her. What are you talking about? She was like my headmistress, just standing there, checking me out. You know, you're really whacko. I think we should go. Where? Aren't we going to your sister's? I just don't want to go if Orna's going. It's like having dinner with the fucking grim reaper. You weren't saying that when you were kissing her ass two minutes ago. Hi, Alice. Listen. You can hear it over here. Do you hear it? What are we doing? It's the resonant frequency. It's the tiles. I love sitting on bathroom floors with you. It's always my favourite part of the evening. You want some? No thanks. Where's my hat? It's gone. I didn't know you knew how to drive. Yeah, I'm getting my licence. I guess I should get around to doing that soon-- Whoa! What-- what's this? Matt Damon's shedding hair at the moment. Suzi made me buy this nasty little dog. You know how many animals we have? A lot. And they all live at my house, because-- My mom doesn't let me have pets. Picture. Way to go, Charlie. I think you might need a couple more driving lessons. Yeah, like 1,000. Relax. All under control. One always speeds-- Sorry, Felix. It's okay. Could've happened to anybody. I wouldn't mind. It's just I was actually going fast around the previous one. Yay, hello! Hello! Hi! Just go straight upstairs! Drinks, everything! Hello! Hi! You look amazing! Whoop! Oh! Hi, Bella. Hi! Orna! Oh, I didn't see you there. You just sprung out of nowhere. Um... How have you been? Good? Pretty good. Good. My daddy's always asking after you. I'll bet. Right. Whee! God, I'm so happy you're here. Does anyone want a line? Uh, no thanks. Sure. My agent says to me, "I've got the best comeback for you, ever." I say, "What is it?" "Celebrity wife." And I go-- I'm so glad you came. Alice, you're back together with Charlie! That's amazing! You two are gonna make each other so happy, aren't you? Um, well, we're not together, actually. Oh, what a shame. Oh, good. I've got something to show you. Come on. Come on! Quick, quick, quick! Sit here. And... drinks! Some of the good stuff. Thank you. Ah! Uh-oh! And music! because you can't really have a party without music, can you? Oh, my god! That's amazing. Thank you! Pretty good, yeah? Yeah. You see, my grandmother always said one should have a party piece, and this is mine! Wow! Woo-woo! Benedict! Oh, people are so great! I can always rely on them to come to a party, even at the last moment! I love us. All of us. Even you! I don't quite remember your name! Avi. See, some people are just much more difficult to remember than others. Aah! Felix. Saskia. I hear you're with Marlon these days. Yeah, well, it's all quite chilled. Is he here? No, he's home, painting. I was so sure he was gay. Nope. Good for you. # A hundred lovers # With the aim of making fun # There's just one weasel # He says he's far-est to the ground # # It's getting warmer # Candles melting and somehow # We'll run out They're so blue. I could just swim in them, you know? Please? Why do you always do this? Orna said that you won't leave me for a year after you should and that you're gonna keep breaking my heart till it's irreparable-- irreparable... And you believe her? That's just what she does. It's just badness and mischief. It doesn't mean anything. I want to go, Felix. Well, if you want to go, go! I know. You can feel the effects. It gets absorbed through the skin. Honestly. If the water is hot enough... How much vodka do you need? A lot. Vodka. More! More skin! More skin! You have to take off your clothes! More vodka! More, more, more, more, more, more, more! You have to take off your clothes! Alice? Alice. Alice, I've got to tell you something. Alice? Dammit! You all make me sick! Hi, Alice. You want to join us? No, that's okay. Stings a bit in the beginning, but not unpleasant. Just give it a try. You have to take off more clothes. The more skin, the better. I love skin. I have very strong feelings about this sort of thing. I don't think you should be screwing around on Marlon. Oh, fuck off, Lenny. Since when are you the moral high ground, hm? We're just having a little-- Ah! See? I told you you'd make me sick! # So glad that you could make it today # # Food is fine # And the weather is okay # We've made it so far # So why should we ever be lonely anymore # # Like this All right, bye. Hey, Alice. Hi. So, do you live around here? Um, yeah. Well, just recently, since Charlie and I broke up. I'm not really doing the whole fashion thing anymore. Yeah, Felix mentioned that. You're an actress now. Yeah, just getting my headshots together. Oh, great! Well, it's a shame you're not modelling. Got a catalogue coming up. It's a shoot that might've suited you. But if you've moved on to higher things... Well, I wouldn't say "higher." Oh, I would. Got time for coffee? Um, yeah, sure. Okay. So, how come you came back to London? Hello. What can I get for you? Um, soya cappuccino, please. Um, yeah, same. You know, Felix is besotted by you. Well, you know what he's like. You know, sometimes you want what you can't have. I thought he had had you. Like, a few times. No. We kissed once. Thanks. Thank you. It's nothing though. I think he's just trying to escape Suzi. So what about you? You're not with your husband anymore? Oh, no. I've moved on. I think I'm gonna reinvent myself as an old maid. Perhaps I'll start wearing black. More black? More black. Says he loves me, but that's a lie. 'Cause he ain't got the silver, and he ain't got the gold. And he got me no more. Woo! Oh, thank you. Cute. Baby, please. What? I wanna read. Come on. Baby, just read a book. What? Read a book? Okay, Marlon. Okay. Okay, fine. Fine. I'll read a book. Hm? Ooh. "All such cases are irrelevant, "because they presuppose the principle of universality, "and it is a central doctrine "of the intellectual and political culture that the moral truisms must be forcefully rejected." Shut up. So, what do you guys wanna do? Um, go see that show? What? Horace's? No, I saw it last week. It was awful. Do you think they're coming to the park? How would they find us? GPS? Has anyone seen Alice? I think she's with Charlie... or is he here? Did you see her last night? Alice? Yeah. Yeah, I liked her-- Would you call that a bolero? A short jacket. You wear it open. No? Hey, darling. When are you coming home? I miss you. But I was cooking you dinner, something I saw on Come Dine With Me. What? Well, why not? Felix... I've got to go. Felix! Is it? Bastard. "Purple's my favourite colour. I think it's slimming." Not anymore. Oh! Nice pockets, Felix. "Suzi, have you seen my pockets? They seem to have disappeared." Stop it! # He left you all alone # With the fires # Growing near me # At home with the lights out # Serenades you # Nearer I'm tweakin' it. Mad freakin' it. I'm all around the creek with it. I'm doing you. I'm spooning you. I'm all about harpooning you. Do I know you? How about a kiss? Not interested. You are so lovely. I'm just aching to kiss someone like you. Excuse me. Flush is broken. Nice. It's really important that the word in itself doesn't have, like, a romantic, or like a-- A neutral word. Yeah, like a neutral word. And you say the word, and that wipes the thought. Okay, like what? Give me an example. Like, "think." Think. Okay. Hi. Come on! Hi, guys. Happy carnival. It was never my idea to see other people. That was him. Well, you are seeing other people. Yeah. No, you're right. You're right. This is Alice! Hey! I was never with him because of his painting. Why were you with him? I love the flat. He's cute. You can't essentially go around making everybody happy. Rather than-- You know what happens before, which is that you-- You throw it-- and you're over it-- and you know you-- You let the pot boil, and-- You know, you just can't even keep it on the-- Look, I have to go, okay? --Check it out, and that first bit-- Charlie. I don't know if that's when you know that it's too much, or if you think you're too much. Sometimes you just have to kill it, you know? I do, but-- So after a point, you just-- you have to make a choice about making a lot of people happy, or keeping yourself... happy... and I-- What I mean-- No, no, no. You can make yourself unhappy just to keep one person happy. You know what I mean? No. No red. That lip needs to be darker. Can you put some more concealer under the eyes? How's Charlie? Um, yeah, pretty much the same. He's not as bad as everyone says he is. So are you serious about this acting thing? Yeah. A friend of mine's producing a film at the moment. I think you'd be perfect. Do you want me to get you an audition? Yeah! That would be amazing. This is not particularly modern. You just don't have to wear a waistcoat with everything. Plus mass? You think I'm fat? No! Everyone can look thinner, don't you think? She's a ballerina. She's not fat. She is fat. Don't say that to her. You know how insecure she is. Oh, you're all so sensitive! Let's get one made up in this, also. I don't wear linen. Alors, Felix. Dit moi. Are you still frequenting this unstable creature? You mean Suzi? Yes. I've got a shoot at 7:00. I've not even ordered the gear. Flushed the fucking keys. I'm sure she fucking ate them, the little toe rag. You don't know how lucky you are to not have to work. It's the ultimate inconvenience. Hey, Felix, how are you? I thought you were coming back. Around the corner at Gustav's. Oh, okay, I'll come down. But give me a second to bring Bambi. Oh, maybe he'll be scared. Okay, well, I'll see you in a minute. I'm gonna go. Really? Maybe see you at Saskia's party. Yeah. You got everything? Yeah. Felix, darling, please have something to eat before we go in. You haven't eaten all day. I don't want anything. But you'll get drunk, and then you'll be angry. You'll feel better. I promise. I don't want a sandwich. What's wrong with you? I made it for you. Please, just eat it. Felix, please. Happy? For you! Happy birthday. Thanks, Bella. Amazing. What is it? You have to open it. It's a money box, for spare change. Can we just get to the cake and sing happy birthday to the little bitch before I puke? Woo! # Happy birthday to me Who made the cake? We did! Great! Yeah, it took us all day. That for me? Um, yes. Great. Suzi and Felix are here. Oh, hi, guys! Present. Thanks. What is it? I got it to match your eyes. It's blue. Yeah. My eyes are brown. # I like your twisted point of view, Mike # # I like your questioning eyebrows # # You've made it pretty clear what you like # # It's only fair to tell you now # # That I leave early in the morning # # And I won't be back till next year # # I see that "kiss me" pucker forming # # Maybe you should plug it with a beer # # What are we doing here in this dive bar? # # How can you live in a place like this? # # Why don't you just get into my car? # # And I'll take you away # I'll take that kiss now, but # Papa was a rodeo # Mama was a rock 'n' roll band # # I could play guitar and rope a steer # # Before I learned to stand # Home was anywhere with diesel gas # # Love was a trucker's hand # Never stuck around long enough # # For a one night stand # Before you kiss me # You should know # Papa was a rodeo # And now it's 55 years later # We've had the romance of the century # # After all these years wrestling gators # # It still makes me cry # Each time I think of what you said to me # # Papa was a rodeo # Mama was a rock 'n' roll band # # I could play guitar and rope a steer # # Before I learned to stand # Home was anywhere with diesel gas # # Love was a trucker's hand # Never stuck around long enough # # For a one night stand # Before you kiss me # You should know # Papa was a rodeo It's just really sad. Yeah. Can I have a hug? Yeah. Marlon, thank you. It's okay. You're really nice. Uh, thank you. Thank you. It's gonna be all right. You'll forget about Felix, and the cats. Yeah. Well, this is awkward. Fucking-- No one gets treated this badly, Felix. God, do we have to do this? Ow! You can't do anything! You have no purpose, and what's worse, you accept it and flaunt it like some crappy badge of honour. Suzi. I'm not gonna be your punching bag anymore. Darling, I didn't mean what I said, really. Please? I'm a real person. No one will ever love you like I love you. Come on, Suzi. No, that's it! I can't do it, Felix! I'm done. Shame about the shoes. What? Your ankles look fat in wedges. My ankles? Well, not just yours. Everybody's. My ankles are one of the best things about me. If you say so. Who's in there? I don't know. It's probably Orna removing that giant stick. Right. Charlie? Charlie... Sometimes he... passes out like this. Is he okay? Alice? Alice. Hey, hey... Charlie? Someone call an ambulance. Fuck. Charlie. Charlie? Ready? Yeah. Okay, all set. So this is goodbye. Yes. I'm sorry. Me too. It doesn't have to be like this. Everything has a life. It lives. It dies. It's life. That's not life. That's death you're describing. I'll always love you. That's not the love I need. It's all I have. Please, I need you. I want you. I mean to have you. Uh, I can see what you're trying to do, and I like it, but maybe, just for a change, we could have it-- I mean, go crazy. Brazilian soap opera. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So this is goodbye. Yes. I'm sorry. Me too. It doesn't have to be like this. Everything has a life. It lives. It dies. It's life. That isn't life. That's death you're describing. I'll always love you! That's not the love I need. It's all I have. Please, I need you. I want you. I mean to have you. Oh, Greg! So, what have you been up to, recently? Um... oh... Well, uh, you know, doing a number of things. I'm gearing towards-- because I want to be an actress, really. And so just been trying to work towards focusing. Are you okay? Uh, yes. Yeah, of course. Maybe we should do it one more time for good luck. Okay. Sorry. Okay. So this is goodbye? Yes. I'm sorry. Me too. It doesn't have to be like this. Everything has a life. It lives. It dies. It's life. That isn't life. That's death you're describing. I'll always love you. That's not the love I need. It's all I have. She said I looked like Annie Lennox. I mean, that's really bizarre. And then they said to do it-- something like-- Do it like in Mexican-- or like Mexican soap-- I just found the whole thing-- It just-- It threw me-- Ugh, I don't know. It's hard to say. Maybe it's just all too soon. Being that late probably didn't help. True. Maybe you need a holiday. You just need to keep busy. Are you still going to Glastonbury? Um, I don't know. Maybe. I think it could be fun. You think? Yeah! Everyone off their heads on drugs, sloshing around in the mud. Sounds horrible. Well, it's better than staying here, moping. Moping? Oh, come on. Charlie was a drug addict. they don't have any room for anything else in their lives. We all knew it was gonna happen-- I didn't. Yeah, well... What is wrong with you? I didn't mean it like that. I was just saying-- He actually thought that you were his friend. Come on, I didn't-- I was only just saying... I didn't mean it like that. Oh, Felix... I didn't mean it like that. I was-- It's just obvious. Why's everybody so sensitive? What? We could've gone with Lulu. Why didn't you tell us before? I'm not telling you. I'm telling Felix. I'm kind of fond of hot and cold running water. Does your mother still have that place near Nice. Yeah, why? But everyone's gone to Glastonbury! I just thought it would be more appropriate. Fuck appropriate. That's very rock 'n' roll of you. Come on, Benny, we'll have fun. It's not going to be fun. Fucking Orna. Orna? Orna... Alice. Hey. Have you seen Saskia? No, I haven't seen anyone. Hey, uh, can I ask you something? Yes, yes, you can. Doesn't it bother you? You know, Saskia and other guys? I mean, you hear about these crimes of passion, where the guy goes crazy or whatever... I know it's not normal, but... Nothing. It just doesn't bother me. You in love? Yeah... Yeah. You know what? I think I am in love. But I think I just don't want to be alone, you know? I think I could love anyone. I fall in love every day. Anyway, whatever... What about you? Well, I loved Charlie. Which... is kind of sad. You've gotta be kidding. Relax. Just... enjoy it. # Wake up, sonny # School is cancelled for the day # # The disco box is good The disco box is good # # They found him at the tracks # Put a bullet in his head # The disco box is good The disco box is good # # Don't you know? # I guess you don't # Let's have # A party # A party to remember # The good times # And all those years of pleasure # # It's okay, they finally gone and did it # # A party # It never will come back # A party, a party to remember # # The good times # And all those years of pleasure # # It's okay, they finally gone and did it# # A party for everyone I mean, I think with a lot of this stuff, uh... you know, he was trying to create something that was slightly more singular, you know? That had more of a kind of voice-- like a clear voice. But... I don't know whether he did or not. What? I didn't know Alice was gonna be here. And? I haven't seen her since the whole Charlie thing was-- Come on... I'll see you at the other thing, okay? No, Felix! Really. Hey, you two. Oh, hello! Alice. Marlon, you feeling all right? Uh, yes. We had an embarrassing run-in this morning. Pharmacist got our prescriptions messed up. Do you want to maybe talk about this another time? Chlamydia's a bitch. I should know. My ex-husband gave it to me four times. All in the name of full disclosure. Sisters! Hey, you really have to make sure Saskia takes a huge dose of that. Otherwise you're just gonna keep passing it back and forth, and back and forth, and around. Um, I'm just gonna go and talk to someone over there. Okay. Alice, I'm leaving soon. I'm going to the the Placard party. Um, yeah, sure. Okay. Just give me a moment. So... Are you gonna come? Argh. Uh, no. I don't think I am. I mean, you kind of told everyone about my STDs, ruined my evening, so probably just gonna ham. Yeah. If you must. Hi. Thanks. You know, what I said about Charlie before, I really didn't mean anything. It's cool. Maybe I was being a bit over-sensitive. I really cared for him. Yeah. He was my friend. Yeah. I don't think he really wanted to... you know. Well... I don't think any of us ever really knew what he was thinking. Yeah. You been okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Okay. Wait, it's too important. There she is. Okay, well, come on. Sorry I'm late-- Shh! Come on, spill it. Okay, Orna just came round to my house, and you know, ordinarily, I thought she was, like, totally made of stone. Right, so she comes around, and she completely breaks down. What do you mean? She was crying. Orna? Yeah. You know how they all bailed on us and went to Cap Ferra. Well, it seems Benedict tried to rape Orna while they were there, like, wouldn't take no for an answer. Yeah, forced himself on her. She's a total mess. You know, I felt really, really bad for her. What about Felix? Where was he? Well, she hasn't said anything to him. I think she's in shock or something. He just said they had sex. Do you believe her? Oh, my god! What? Do you remember that weird soup/art party we all went to? Yeah. with his hands all over that ghastly Russian clotheshorse, and she seemed a bit freaked out at the time. I just thought, "Well, you know, that's Benedict." He had her pinned up against the wall. I don't know what would've happened if I hadn't been there. I slept with him. What?! What?! Gross! When?! You didn't tell me. Oh, it was about a month ago. I mean, it didn't really work. He couldn't... you know. Maybe he's a complete pervert, and can only get it up when it's by force. This is Benedict we're talking about. He's our friend. Weren't there rumours about his father and little boys? Oh, my god, I completely remember that. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I don't think Benedict could do that. As creepy as he may be. Did she call the police? We should just spread the word. We can't let him get away with this. Well, who knows? Nobody. I've just told Avi and Imma. Oh, and maybe Paula. Fuck! How did you get in? Come on. Get up. We're going. Where? What are you wearing? To Cranmore. Cran-- Am I supposed to know this place? I think... that you... need to get up. Hm? Miss him. I know you do. He was built to be missed. What are you wearing? A chicken. It's a nice chicken. Thanks. Put on your clothes. Everyone's waiting in the car. Oh, actually, before, will you just do me a huge favour, and give me my B12 shot. I mean, I'd do it myself, but I always faint. Seriously? Yeah, yeah, it's all ready. Just put it in. Um, okay, on the count of three. Yep. One, two, three. Ow. Are you done? Yeah. Thanks. What was that all about? I'm trying to get pregnant. Really? Does Marlon know? No. I'm just so bored. Come on! # We're leaving today # Your trouble and sorrow # Let love touch us now Do you know what time it is? Yeah. It's a bit see-through. Is it? I think you should wear just the dress. I know! Let me hold your jacket for you. They'll kick me out. We could leave. Alice, darling! Peter, Felix. Indira, darling, this is Alice. You two would like each other. I'm so bored I could die. Morris is learning to fly. A plane. Wow. I want to put my hand out the window and feel the air rush by. Fabulous party. Thank you, darling. How are you? Um, yeah, good. I signed back up to the agency. Trying to make some money. Probably too old now, though. How are you? I heard about France. How about you? Where have you been? Who have you been seeing? Who have you been doing? Norway. Norway? # I think it's time to take a look in your mind # # For some help # You better listen now # Let love touch us now, people # # Let love touch us now # Mmm, let love touch us # Let some love touch you now # While we still got a clear blue sky up above # Right, everybody! Charades in the drawing room. Ears. Doggy. Cop. Scissor-head. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof! Peter Pan! Cat on a Hot Tin Roof! Not everything is Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Barbara. You're all useless. Velveteen Rabbit. It's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof! Alice, your turn. Oh! A mystical tool which is seldom used these days. Chinese face reading. Nothing... Nothing. Right. Let's play hide-and-seek. Where are the candles? Back in a moment. Okay. What's wrong? Nothing. He's never going to make you happy. I could tell, the moment I saw you both. But... you've been pushing us together the whole time. But now I'm going to care about you. You don't care about me. Not really. I just don't get it. What is it you want? I've always gotten Felix what he wanted. Sure. Whatever. Alice? Felix! Darling! So happy for you. You look wonderful. You wouldn't happened to have seen Alice, would you? That's the game, isn't it? You have to find her. Alice? Alice was looking for you. Has anyone seen Alice? No. Hey, where are you? Have you heard? No, what? Is she there? Who? That fucking bitch! Orna! Put her on. I need to talk to her. It's Benny. She's, um-- She's not here. All right, I'm coming. I'm fucking coming. Tell her I'm coming. Felix. Marlon. Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to be falling in love? Yeah, right. I don't now. I'm so confused. I don't know if I'm doing it because it's what I want to do, or it's what Orna planned for me. Right. Right. Yeah... It's a tricky one. Yeah. She just enjoys manipulating people, I think. I don't know if it's a game, and I just-- I don't get it. No. What about Felix? He's around. He loves me. Really? Yeah. Aren't you, um... gonna miss things? Like, uh... kissing those people you've been inching towards, for years... Never too late for a first kiss. 'Cause, you see... I don't think you're that kind of person, that's all. I think you're the kind of person that everyone wants. But no one can have. I'll bore you to tears. Just-- nothing. Just playing... Don't you love this song? If I could dance to one song, the rest of my life, I think this might be it. If I could be a dancer... If people would come from miles around, just to see me dance. How fabulous would that be? In my spare time I could sew outfits for my dancing. Live in a peach tree. And eat peaches forever. Have a hundred men in love with me. Where you could make love to a song. Do you think this is what heaven is like? How awful that this night will end, and we'll all have to trip off to our own bedrooms. How fabulous if we could all sleep in one giant bed. The whole world just writhing and embracing each other. You have no idea how much I've missed you. # My love is selfish # And I bet that yours is too # What is this peculiar word called "truth"? # Shh... shh. Hey... Stupid bitch! Fuck you, Orna! # Will cut you out to satisfy its thirst # # For the meaning of a ritual # So habitual and cursed # My love is selfish # How it separates the Earth # It takes every shiny stone # But leaves the dirt # For the cowards in the corner # # Who just don't know what they're worth # # They've been twisted by a hollow kind of pain # # I can see it in their eyes # But I ignore it every day # 'Cause my love is selfish # And it remembers everything # But the first time it was moved enough to sing # # How it dangled on that stage # # Just like a puppet on a string # # I see you gently # I see you torn # I see our loch's saint mention a man of bones # # Can't find the reason # In an isle of stone # If the weather's blinding # Let me keep you warm # So warm # Cold hands, warm heart # Cold hands, warm heart # # Cold hands, warm heart # Cold hands, warm heart # # Are you dancing, Alice? # Are you of the world? # Do you need a friend? # Let me see you twirl # Charmed and waiting # Measured, gone # Have ever touched your face this long? # # So long # Cold hands, warm heart # Cold hands, warm heart # # Cold hands, warm heart # Cold hands, warm heart # # If you're walking # You can walk with me # And our feet can tap in an extra beat # # But that's not your way # No, you're too free # But your breeze can bother all my leaves # # Leaves # You're in a sonnet # You're in a prayer # You're in a magazine # You were never there # You're with the seasons # You're with the weed # You're with the cherry blossom at my feet # # On the street # Cold hands, warm heart # Cold hands, warm heart # # Cold hands, warm heart # Cold hands, warm heart #
