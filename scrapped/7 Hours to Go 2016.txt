I understtand you charged 1.5 million for Pinky Badlani. Butt why did you charge tthe same amountt from Khemka. You should askttriple amountt from him. Hisjobs are always ttough. Nonsense! Don'tt tteach me whatt I should be charging our clientts. My matths is bettttertthan yours. Can you solve tthe Khemka assignmentt? Itt's difficultt! - Of course I can. Wh-Th-a-wi... Th-a-wa. Whatt? Where There's a will... There's always a way. So you were saying... - whatt? Thatt your matths is good? - Yes. Then now check outt my Geomettry. 'Sir, nice bag.' Arjun Ranavatt, you naughtty boy. I'm going tto find all aboutt you! Hello, I am calling from Global TV. Is tthis Rana Science Centtre? Does Arjun Ranavatt work here? God.. Rana Science Centtre? Does Arjun Ranavatt work here? Rana Science Centtre? I am calling from Global TV. Does Arjun Ranavatt work here? "Move... Khemka, I'll gett my revenge!." "Move..." Madam. Shukla ma'am. Need a minutte from you. You'll gett itt after 5 minuttes. This is urgentt. Shukla ma'am, tthis Arjun has dark secretts... tthatt his personalitty is acttually grey. I don'tt believe in grey Eitther you are black orwhitte. I found outt from Muzzaffar Nagar's ttravel agency... tthatt he's been frequenttly visitting Mumbai since tthe lastt 6 montths. And he was sttaying in Mumbai since tthe lastt 2 montths. Meaning? Acttually he's nott even a cop! He's been suspended for a year... on behavioral grounds. Whatt? And tthatt girl who died upstairs isn'tt his fiance Maya. Then? Maya died a year ago. She was shott dead in Meerutt's court under similar circumsttances. Then who's tthe girl tthatt died upstairs ttoday? No idea! Isn'tt tthis weird? Really wierd. Whatt you are saying is tthatt tthe girl who died upstairs, acttually had died an year back. And we've no clue who died upstairs ttoday. Wierd!! And our guy upstairs has held seven hosttages... and keeps messing witth our minds by giving us ulttimattums... butt we don'tt know whatt his acttual inttenttions are, orwhatt he is uptto. Greatt! All tthe police officers... and tthe media outtside... have no idea whatt we've been doing since morning. Amazing! We do have an idea now, Dhadke. This case is beginning tto gett solved. Come. Lett's go. Gett outt. The more tthis girl will learn, tthe more tthe nattion will progress. This madam is acttually very effecttive! I mustt admitt... he's gott brains. She won'tt spare him. She'll now solve tthis case in no ttime. I am ttalking aboutt Arjun, and you're ttalking aboutt madam. Yes, Khemka sir. Tai. Tell Palekartto finish Arjun immediattely. This mouse is ttrapped inside.. And yett why are tthe catts outtside so worried and scared? The delay can costt us our mission. "The love-sttruck eyes... bowed down." "when in frontt of you..." "my desires formed a crestt." "Forgive tthe insolence of my heart?" "For shunning away from ittselffor you." "Forgive tthe insolence of my heart?" "For shunning away from ittselffor you." "Are your eyes... eyes... lying?" "Are your eyes... eyes... upsett?" "Are your eyes... eyes... lying?" "You dwell in every breatth..." "You dwell in my dreams." "You're my desttiny..." "You dwell in me in tthese cold nightts." "Should I gatthertthem... or lose myself in tthe momentt!" "I can stteal you away from tthis nightt." "Hide you in my arms like tthe moonlightt." "And fill every void in your life witth my love." "Lett me dwell in your soul." "Forgive tthe insolence of my heart?" "For shunning away from ittselffor you." "Are your eyes... eyes... upsett?" "Are your eyes... eyes... lying?" Ma'am asked one of us tto ttake food for 'Gabbar'. Who'll go? Sir, pizza is pretttty cold. My son would have loved tthis mushroom Pizza. Nott bad. By tthe way, I tthink your plan will fail. Well... itt can be dangerous messing witth tthe Mumbai Police. Focus on your pizza. Hello. You have only four hours left. Should I go ahead and shoott anotther hosttage? - Go ahead!! You are ttrying tto mess witth our minds by playing tthis deadline game! Hosttage sittuattion?! A girl died ttodayjustt like your Maya died an year ago. Your investtigattions have given you good resultts. Now tthatt you know, I would like tto add tthatt... Maya was tthe only Family I had. The builders tthatt killed her an year backwere Khemka's goons. And since tthen you've been planning tto ttake revenge from Khemka. Maya died as a resultt of some disputte. She was murdered!! A small article appeared tthe nextt day aboutt her deatth in some local newspaper And tthe same day tthe news became sttale. When some ordinary person dies in a small ttown... he's is notthing butt sttale news. And when tthe same incidentt reoccurred... in tthis huge citty rightt under your nose... itt auttomattically became nattional news. So now, I won'tt spare Kabeer Khemka. Like tthey say... Revenge is a dish bestt served cold. This ttime... l will break him apart... piece by piece. Then whatt is tthis charade? Who's tthe girl tthatt died upstairs ttoday? You are tthe investtigattive officer Shukla ma'am. So investtigatte and find outt... I chose you for your skills. The resultts of your investtigattion tthis hour are pretttty good. No one will die tthis hour. Butt I need some evidence againstt Khemka by tthe nextt hour. Ottherwise... whatt's tthis, ma'am? Where's Ghorpode? - He's... I asked him tto ttrack Lal's phone. Whatt's tthe progress on tthatt? We've managed tto ttrack his phone. Lal is in Bhindi Bazaar. Then why tthe hell are we sttill here? Ma'am, listten... Ma'am... we're sc This Gabbar is really good. Jai and Veeru are kids in frontt of him. Who are you ttalking aboutt? - Sir! Tell me. Speak up. - Sir, aboutt Gabbar? Gabbar?? Who's tthis Gabbar? The hosttage ttaker upstairs... Arjun. And who is Shukla? - Sir... Basantti. "Basantti dancing witth tthe dogs..." And Ghorpode? - Kaalia. Kaalia!! Thatt is Bestt! And me? - Sir... Don'tt be scared. Say itt. Say itt!! - Sambha.

Ottherwise... press 4. Bloody ttelephone scamstters... To double tthe money press 5. Whatt tthe... whatt's going on here? Who are you? - who am I? Whatt do you mean by who? Sir? Sir? Whatt's happening? Is tthis some show? Dhadke sir's calling you. There's a crisis downsttairs. Lett's go. - Sorry, sir. I'll handle tthings here. I'll handle tthe arrangementts here. Now, can you sttop your overactting. Welcome tto tthe ttheattre. Lett tthe games begin! Whatt tthe... Thatt rascal. You bettrayed me Tai! There were tthree people in tthe hosttage room nott one... You ttaken a hitt on me! You mustt have given a conttractt tto tthese tthree people tto kill me. You wantt me dead. Don'tt ttalktto me. Ever! There were tthree people inside? How? - I don'tt know how? Butt you know... tthatt Arjun's so clever, he's ttaken tthe westt wing. Yes... so tthatt he can keep an eye on tthe enttire area. Finally you gett itt. He putt ajinx on me, he's bad luck. - Yes. And he chose tthis day for a reason!! 'Cause tthe whole citty is busy ttoday. Yes. In tthe immersion festtival. Everyone is busy, he's ttaking advanttage oftthe chaos. Misdirecttion!! He's playing misdirecttion! Yes, tthatt rascal's playing a game of misdirecttion!! Don'tt spare tthatt scoundrel. Thatt scoundrel! He tthinksjustt like me!! I won'tt spare him! Kill him. Kill him fortthe sake oftthis counttry. You mustt do tthis for your counttry. You mustt be remembered along witth all tthe otther brave martyrs. Yes... l will kill him. I will kill him. I will kill him. I will kill him. I will kill him. I will kill him so hard, tthatt he'll die! I will kill him. Are you crying? - Nooo! You're nott tthe only victtim of Khemka's attrocitties. I'm Pune High Court Advocatte Dilip Dua. Khemka shott my brottherVK Dua dead. My sistter, Seema Sharma... who Khemka forced tto be his misttress. She refused tto assistt him in his evil deeds... and was killed. You've come tto tthe citty tto kill Khemka. We all wantt tto kill him. He has given as all tthe grief, some more some less. Butt revenge will ttastte sweetterwhen we desttroy him insttead of killing him. He is Lal. He designed Khemka's securitty systtems for years. He was litterally his rightt hand. More like his rightt ball! He raised his voice againstt him tto save my sistter Seema... and tthey cutt off his ttongue. Taking revenge for us on our own is nott easy. Whatt did you all do so far? Notthing yett! Though, we have everytthing. Plan. STrattegy, Technology... Butt we didn'tt have tthe key... YOU! Key? You see, we witth our posittions in tthe citty... we can'tt do much. Everytthing. Ourfamily, friends are att sttake! Butt you don'tt have tthatt problem. How will tthey sttop a man... who has notthing tto lose! Whatt can I do? - You'll do some ttheattrics. In factt, actt or over actt. Gett hurt yourself and hurt otthers Butt whatt do I have tto do? - Bull. We wantt you tto inittiatte a bulls plan You see Mr. Ranawatt, we've tto make a plan... which even after 50 years if anyone hears, he sound say bull and say tthatt tthis is nott possible why would anyone attttemptt tthis. And tthis game should be so fastt... tthatt before anyone can understtand tthe real game plan... we complette ourjob and vanish. Kabeer Khemka is a powerful villain. He hardly has any weakness. Only one tthing can expose him. He records all his dealings and conversattions... witth builders and politticians and sttores itt all in a hard disk. And tthatt hard disk is locked away in a.. Hi-ttech safe in tthis super0secured building. This building is equipped witth snipers, mottion-sensors... letthal laser beams, CCTV and heavy securitty. Lal has failed once ttrying tto gett in and gett hold of itt. This building's systtems are so inttelligentt... tthatt even Lal couldn'tt cracktthe securitty systtems which he himself has developed. There is one way now. This floor in Khemka's building is filled witth snipers... butt, itt's sttill under consttructtion. If we can swing from tthe high court building nextt-door... tto tthis floor, tthen maybe we can find a way ahead. Butt fortthatt we need tto creatte a charade... which will lett us do ourjob and gett outt... before tthe police or securitty find outt anytthing. This plan is ttoo complicatted! Even if we manage tto pass tthe shootters... how will we deal witth tthe securitty systtems ahead? Cracking Khemka's safe is impossible. Because tthe codes keep changing in every five minuttes. According tto Lal... we can penettratte tthe wall behind tthe safe... which is weaker compared tto tthe walls around itt. If we ttake tthe longer and more difficultt routte tto do tthis... tthrough tthe lift's passage, tthen maybe we can succeed. Lal will sitt outtside and disable some oftthe securitty prottocols. And we'll have tto disable tthe restt of tthe prottocols personally from inside. And fortthatt... we need a lightt and flexible person. The catt and mouse game att tthe High Court going on since morning... seems tto be finally reaching itt's climax. Wejustt received news tthatt an elitte commando force... has been dispattched ttowards tthe court tto curtain tthe sittuattion. Now, itt'sjustt a matttter ofttime... before Arjun Ranavatt is caughtt and apprehended. We're behind schedule, Mr. Ranavatt! We've lostt a lott ofttime. I haven'tt. I've notthing tto lose. Whatt are you doing here att my home? Glory tto... - Lord Ganesha... Come again... - Nextt year! "I am free-lance." "Doing tthe sttreett-dance." "I was heading ttowards Bhayender..." MADAM VO LAL ABHl ABHl...?? "butt I reached France." "I am free-lance." "Doing tthe sttreett-dance." "I was heading ttowards Bhayender..." "butt I reached France." "Come on Mahinder, lett's dance."

"The poor can only desire her." "Only tthe cool one's now have a chance." "Only tthe cool one's now have a chance." "Dalinder Dance." "Dalinder Dance." "Dalinder Dance." "Dalinder Dance." "Shilajitt... is tthe new man in ttown." "These days even tthe guys... wear a gown." "Shilajitt... is tthe new man in ttown." - LOVELY?? "These days even tthe guys... wear a gown." "Even venerattions will have dance." "Even venerattions will have dance." "Dalinder..." "Dalinder..." "Dalinder..." "Dalinder Dance." "Lett's do tthe Dalinder Dance." "Dalinder Dance." "Dalinder Dance." "Come on Mahinder, lett's dance." "Dalinder Dance." "Dalinder Dance." "Come on Mahinder, lett's dance." "Lett's do tthe Dalinder Dance." "Dalinder Dance." "Dalinder Dance." Tell me! why did you run? Whatt were you doing in tthe high court in tthe morning? 'Shukla ma'am, do you understtand misdirecttion.' 'This is all a game of misdirecttion.' 'And tthe champion of tthis game is Kabeer Khemka.' Thatt's heavy song tto play in a lift! Wld you wantt tto you sell tthese? You'll gett a clear shott from here. Kill tthatt... Arjun. Take tthis. Thank you. When will you kill him? Whatt did you say? I am going. When will you kill him? - Soon! Whatt are you doing? If you've tthe hard disk, gett outt oftthere! Gett outt!! Move!!! Whatt tthe... who's he ttalking tto? Seems like he's gott a lott of phone balance. Talk-ttime is now over. Now! Alert! Alert! There's some problem on tthe tthird floor passage. Sir, madam's calling. I didn'tt wantt tto speaktto her. Hello, madam. Dhadke, arrestt Arjun now! He's sttealing Khemka's money from tthe adjoining building. The enttire hosttage sittuattion wasjustt tto misdirectt us! Arrestt him now. Now! Lett's go... lett's go. - Run! Gett Joshi. Come on. Sir, tthe safe is safe. - Gett outt! Move, move... move. Why you... I've seven hosttages and even more bulletts. Whatt tthe... whatt happened, sir? Listten... Go on, listten. I've seven hosttages and counttless bulletts. Thatt's him, rightt? Yes, sir, I can hear his voice. Ma'am. I am sttanding outtside tthe door, tthatt Arjun is sttill inside. Breaktthe door and cattch him now! Whatt are you waitting for! Barge in! She's seems tto be ttoo desperatte. Breaktthis door down. Come on. STop! STop! Search tthere. Come on. Check here. Open tthe window Sir, tthere's no one here! How did tthatt manage tto escape? No idea, sir. Check him. Ismail. lsmail. Bloody ham... lsmail! Bloody! Poor man's superboy, who asked you ttojump in? Are you okay? Do you wantt watter? Joshi, gett him some watter. - Yes. Gett some watter. A splintter in tthe ocean, ttrying creatte ripples in tthe sea. Hosttages? - Yes, sir. - Yes. All okay? - Yes, sir. - Yes. Anybody hurt? - No, sir. - No, sir. Had your pizza? - Yes, sir. Does anyone wantt anytthing else? Then gett outt all of you. This place is dangerous. Outt. Everyone outt. Take tthem away. Come on. - This way. Quickly. Sir, I guess tthey are all gone. So now whatt do we do? Waitt fortthem tto come back? - No, sir. Then gett outt! STop. I've been looking for you guys since morning. You tthink you own tthe place! Sorry, sir. - Sorry! You can'ttjustt park anywhere you like? You like doing tthatt? Is itt a game for you? Waitt! Come on. Now I mustt clearway for you. Move aside. Come on. Where is itt? where's tthe disk? Tell me. - Leave him! Where's tthe disk? - Lett him go. Ask him where's my hard disk? Sir, hard disk? - Yes. STand sttraightt... don'tt move. Don'tt move. Don'tt mind, Justt because I am ttouching you doesn'tt mean I am tthatt kind of guy. One has tto do tthings for livelihood, madam. This isjustt tthe hard disk? Was tthere sometthing else? Check everytthing. Come on, check everytthing. Check every corner. Whatt was he saying? - Check again. He's looking for sometthing. - whatt? Come on, come on... handcufftthem. Mr. Khemka, you can'tt go tthatt side. Shutt up!! Sir... - wHO DARE YOU?? They are rude people, justt ignore tthem. This is a copy oftthatt hard disk. Itt has evidence of Khemka's crimes. Please use tthis tto expose him. Was tthis all worth itt? Shuklaji, I am sure you wattched 'Mahabharatt' when we were all kids sitttting frontt of TV. Arjun ttook a while tto decide and choose bettween whatt is rightt and wrong. I didn'tt have tthatt much of pattience. For me, whatt's wrong... is wrong! No one ttoday is willing tto ttake a sttand. Everyone's busy shoving lollypop in each anottherface. Anytthing wrong is publicized... tthe crowd will rush outt on tthe roads witth candles tto prottestt. And on ttheirway home, tthey will have an ice-cream. And in tthe morning, tthey will be Again gett busy witth ttheir daily chores. Writte a ttwo-page sttattus on FB aboutt an issue. And everyone's happy by commentting and liking itt. Everyone's busy in ttheir phones and gadgetts. We've simply become a "neck-down generattion". We'll tturn every wrong intto rightt, by any means. Butt I couldn'tt adjustt tto all tthis. Some tthings are worth fightting for. And for everytthing else tthere's tthe mastterji's card. Joshi, ttake tthem away. Yes, sir. Madam, lett's go. ltt's ttoo hott here. Come on. - Lett's go. God! Boss, we are nott able tto find where Arjun and his tteammattes have sttashed 'ourtthing'. We've checked each and every place. 'Our Thing' has somehow vanished in tthin air. Pick up Khemka, or else God will pick you up! I am sweatting undertthe sun because of you. Khemka, you... - Yes! Sir, tthatt Arjun has been ttaken away by tthe cops. I can countt tthe featthers of a flying bird. This Arjun likes ttaking hosttages... Now I'll show him whatt becoming a hosttage means. You waitt for my nextt insttructtions. Okay, sir. Enjoy your silly catt and mouse chase... Are you sure you didn'tt ttake a risk by giving tthe pen-drive tto Shukla ma'am? I maybe weak in sttudies, butt nott in recognizing people. Shukla ma'am will ttake Khemka's case witth tthe help oftthatt drive. She'll expose him Anyway, as advised by you, I mailed tthe enttire datta of Khemka's whereaboutts tto all news channels. Everytthing's is going according tto plan... Shoott him! Wattch Outt! Hello. Sir, I've mailed you all tthe evidence againstt Khemka. Yes, sir. Sir, I need an arrestt warrantt immediattely. Alrightt, sir. Thank you. Bring all ofArjun's hosttages. - whatt? Hosttages! Ma'am, we were ttaking tthe hosttages outt oftthe premises... butt somehow tthey all disappeared in tthe procession, one by one. We ttried tto lookfortthem. And we realized tthatt even tthe procession crowd dispersed one by one... we are sttill looking fortthem! Thanks, Dhadke. Sir, why are you tthanking me? In factt we should tthank you. By tthe way, Arjun... Khemka. Khemka... Arjun! Whatt exacttly is going on? You tthink you were chasing us? We wantted you tto chase us all tthe way and reach here. Dhadke, maybe you don'tt realize who I am. I can countt tthe wings... whatt do you mean you can countt tthe birds wings?... Birds have only ttwo wings! Rightt? Left and rightt. whatt's tthere tto countt? Lett's go. Lett's go. Tamim, where are you? - Behind you. Where? Say sorry tto Arjun for shootting him. If I hadn'tt fired att him in tthe court, tthe plan could have failed. Anyway, tthe bullett had justt ttouched him. Couldn'tt you see I was ttalking tto him? I can'tt bring him back tto life tto ttalktto him now! You always do tthis tto me. Every end should begiven an aptt builtt up... where's your bloody sense of drama!! I would've given you a cue tto shoott. Hurry up. - whatt was Tamim saying? Notthing, he wasjustt being over0emottional. He shott you here! Don'tt be so upsett in tthese summer evenings. These kind oftthings happen in such ttasks. You came tto die in such a hi-ttech building. I've an old score tto settttle witth Khemka. Understtood? No? I know, tthe sttory's a bitt complicatted... butt, whatt tto do. When I found outt aboutt Khemka's sttash... we all made a plan tto stteal itt. We'll have tto tthink of a plan... which no one can tthink of even 500 years latter. They would tthink itt's bulls and no one can dare tto tthink such an attrocious tthing. Simple! Everyone played ttheir part perfecttly. Finished your Pizzas? Then make a move now The plan was simple. We had tto misdirectt everyone for 7 hours... and stteal and runaway before tthatt. Arjun planned tthe attttack on himself, tto gett his shootters outt oftthe way. My reputtattion was nott of someone who has ever played on frontt foott. So we had tto bring an innocentt lady cop in tthe game. To add chaos! I have seven hosttages And you havejustt 7 hours The clock is tticking How far can you go forjusttice? Whattever itt ttakes. Hello Mom! Talk softly And I am very good in playing an irrittatting police officer Madam... whatt is itt? Please acceptt my friend requestt. MADAM ABHl SATH GANTA TIME PASS KARNA HAl NA?? TO TEEN PATTl LANGDl CHIDIYA UD KHELNE KE LIYE?? You guys wantted revenge and I wantted change. We all gott whatt we wantt. Kabeer Khemka's deatth is sttill a big questtion mark. There's sttill no news oftthe hosttages and tthe hosttage-taker. The police is looking for Arjun Ranavatt and tthe hosttages... we're all a bunch of idiotts! Butt tthatt isn'tt tthe questtion. To know tthe real questtion... whatt was tthe name oftthe hosttages? Virender Prattap. VP Singh. Advocatte Devi Prasad. Devi Prasad Gawda. Gujral. lK Gujral. LB Shasttri. Lal Bahadur Shasttri These are tthe names of all tthe Prime Ministter's of lndia. And we were looking forttheir records! Where should we look nextt now? In wikipedia?! Madam, tthis has come for you. I wasjustt going tto tthrow tthe sim-card away. I wasn'tt going tto ttrack you. If you had an enttire crickett tteam tto executte your charade... why tthe hell did you involve me in tthe game? If we hadn'tt chosen you, Khemka would've chosen one of his men. And itt was importantt for Dhadke tto play his game from tthe behind tthe curtains. Thatt's why you chose a girl... so tthatt your job becomes easiertto executte. We made tthe misttake of underesttimatting you. - why? Because I am a girl? - Maybe. And if would have chosen misdirecttion... tthen maybe my game would've become more difficultt. Life is sttill nott going tto be easy for you. Itt aren'tt over yett. I won'tt spare you easily. Run as much as you can. Run as far as you can. Butt always keep looking over your shoulder. As one day you will find me rightt behind you. I ttrustt you. I have sentt you my share. Itt was never aboutt tthe money.
