I want that wee boy of yours. My son? Aye. You see, I need a child for my Doris. She has a woman's thing, and I've... What the fuck am I telling you for? She needs a child. You have a child. I want that child. So you and that skinny girlfriend of yours, you can barely look after yourselves, never mind him. So you bring that child to me before the weekend's out, and I'll write off your debt. Otherwise, I'll bury the both of you, and I'll take him anyway. I'm not giving you my son. Is that right? He's my son. I can't give you my son. Aah! Mad Dog, stop! [Gasping] Let him down. Bring me that child. - JIMBO: Please. - MAN: Come on. Please, I'll get you the money. MAN: Ready for a sing-song?

No. He wants him for his girlfriend. She wants a child. What? W- Why doesn't he just fuck her, then? Do you want to go and ask him? Jesus, Jimbo. Look, you'd be better going on the run. I can't go on the run. How could I go on the run? I've no money to go on the run. I... You... You said that fish shop was easy? - Fucking right, it is. - And you have the gear? My grandda has it. Your grandda? JOE: [laughing] SOPHIE: Ohh. [Shivers] JOE: That was great. SOPHIE: It's so cold. Oh. Here. Thank you. [Laughs] Here. Here. [Sighs] There you go. I'm an African girl, you know. I miss the sun. You miss Africa? - Mm, every day. - Yeah. It's 11 years since I left Ethiopia after the war. I mean, I'm glad to have escaped so much sadness, but I miss it. Heh. Refugees in Belfast.

Indeed we are, sir. - I'll drive. - Uh, no. You're not on this operation. Why not? Well, I can't tell you that. - Security. - Oh. Right. Just under here. Whoa. It's ancient. Where did he get this? An IRA man hid it here during the Troubles. Then he got shot. No one else knows it's here. Okay. - Don't do that. - Why? It has a hair trigger. - A what? - It went off. Oh, fuck. Okay. Um... we're gonna need a car. We'll take my grandda's. Are we going for a drink? SOPHIE: You painted that? JOE: At first, I did some, uh, sketches, and then I switched to watercolors. In the end, I used acrylics. Much more dramatic. The woman looks very angry. Yeah. Could say that. But that's a whole 'nother story. Have another drink. Okay, I... I don't drink. I really never drink. We're in Ireland. Cheers.

He knocked the gun right out of her hand. Know what I mean? He was very smooth. I saw Matt Damon do the same thing in Bourne 3. And in 2. And in 1. Well, it was very smooth. He looked very professional to me. And then he, uh... he ran into the shop. No. Now, the next thing that happened was there was a big roaring.

His name is Joe, Joe Maguire. He's a cousin of the owner, Peter Maguire. Now, them Maguires, they're from Peter's Hill. they've been in that shop. But what can you tell us about this Joe Maguire? He showed up a lot of weeks ago. Not very talkative. Keeps himself to himself. Know what I mean? Is Peter in there with him? No, no, no. Peter's in Africa at the moment. Actually he's over there building one of them concern schools. Uh, it's actually in Malawi. Or is it Rwanda? Any one of them places needs a school. He's very good with his hands, Peter. Know what I mean? Okay, thanks. Thank you. Thank you very much. No worries. - We appreciate it. - Right. Jesus Christ. Tell headquarters to get on with the FBI and give us all they have on this Joe Maguire. Have them check into the Maguire family as well. What's a concern school? Fucked if I know. It's a Catholic thing, you know. Always concerned about something. Uh, I forgot to mention the young lad. What young lad? I saw a young lad getting into the shop, pushing a pram. No, he was walking up and down, I'd say, before, you know, with the pram, trying to get the child to sleep, I suppose. And he goes into the shop. Then the Yank Maguire goes in, and then... whuh... started. Know what I mean? Very professional. MAN: Boss. MAISIE: I'm sorry, Douglas. I'm not supposed to be involved in that place, Ma. I was there to get your cut. I hid it from him. Didn't recognize his voice or anything? No, Douglas. He was wearing a balaclava. He put on a bit of an accent. He nearly shit when he saw me. But I warned him. I told him not to take the brown bag. I told him he would die. What did you tell the cops, Ma? I told them nothing, son. You never, ever told anybody what was in that bag, did you, Ma? No, son. I swear. Are you sure about that, Ma? Yes, son. I'm sure. I have to get that bag back. - What's in it, M.D.? - What's in it?

All you have to do is lift the phone... - What do you want? - [Sighs] Give me a minute. Uh... Wait a minute. Why was he asking you what you wanted? - I... - What was all that shooting about when you came running in here? Were the police chasing you? [Telephone ringing] - Something's not right here. - You...

[Hangs up] - [Sighs] - Well, boss? He says there's six of 'em in there, and they're all armed. INSPECTOR: Six of them? Oh, boy. What do you really want? Never you mind. He wants me. How do you know? Because that woman would go to the ends of the Earth to get me. She's nuts. [Bullets fire] Aah! Jesus! Please don't shoot us, mister. Please, mister. Please. - [Crowd yelling] - What was that? JIMBO: What are you two doing in there? We were sleeping. I swear. I get it. It's a Trojan horse. No, mister. It's not a horse. This is me da's couch, honest. Get the two of them out of there. Get out, quickly. - Come here. - Get out. You're hiding in there, and you wait until I close so you can rob the place. No, mister, I swear. We was watching TV and fell asleep. Me da must have gone and sold the couch. We're going home, mister. Yeah, me ma will have the tea made. Jesus Christ, shut up. Sit down, the pair of you. You're not going anywhere. Go. Sit down. - [Telephone ringing] - Answer that. - What? - WELLER: Is anybody hurt in there? No, it's nothing. It was just an accident. [Hangs up] [Radio] Repeat. Shots fired in Scotch Street. [Southern American accent] What we have here is a failure to communicate. [Hangs up] Cool Hand Luke. Paul Newman. It's only one of the best films ever made. BOY: Give us a look at your gun, mister. What? Shut up, and sit down. Ah, go on. Just give us a look at the gun. Get back in that settee. - Go! - No! Hey, I'll take your legs at the knees if you don't sit down now. Now be quiet, or I'll put the Curse of the Umgazi on you, and your teeth will fall out. INSPECTOR: So what's our next move, boss? Give them time to get tired and hungry. Then we'll see where we're at. INSPECTOR: Are you hungry, boss? I could eat a horse between two mattresses. Come on. - Two fish suppers, please. - WOMAN: Yes, love. Fish and chips, greatest food known to man. I mean, you got your protein, your carbohydrates, your omega-3 oils, your sodium, and all for 3.50, eh? Plus you get to catch up on yesterday's news. Heh heh. Now, where else in the world would you get a bargain like that? [Radio] Expect heavy traffic buildup. We require ambulance and fire service. What the fuck is this? SAS MAN: And stand by, Sergeant. Covering. Who's the OSC? OSC? On-site commander. Well, th-that's me. And you are? Captain Thomas Farnsworth, SAS. And what are you doing here, Captain Farnsworth, SAS? I didn't catch your name or position. I'm Detective Inspector Weller, and I'm standing in front of you. What are you doing here? I'm here to assist. Nobody requested the SAS. We have direct orders from the Ministry of Defence. The war here is over. Did nobody tell you? Those days are gone. But I know what this is about. Yous are bored, aren't yous? Excuse me? Ah, you're stuck in your barracks, nothing to do. You have the smell of action, and here you are. Well, you can fuck off back to Kabul or Baghdad or wherever you came from. There's nothing for you here. Very well. I'll pass your message to the Home Secretary. I don't care if you inform the Queen herself. There's nothing for you here. Now get back in that van of yours, and clear off. I have work to do. Civilians. Move it out, lads. Excuse us. Excuse us. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Excuse us. Sorry. Sorry. Jesus, lads. We're in big trouble now. What am I going to tell your mother? This just came through via e-mail... from the FBI. What we have here is a Mr. Joseph Maguire of South Boston, an antique supplier. "You'll notice that Mr. Maguire is married to a Tracey Barrett, "daughter of James Barrett, "better known as Whitey B., head of the South Boston Irish mafia." Heh. "Mr. Maguire, it appears, "is in bad favor at the moment with Whitey, "who has a hit out on his son-in-law for 100,000 to whack him." That doesn't get out, by the way, in case one of your lads decides to take up the offer. - [Ringing] - JIMBO: Answer it. Hello. You missing Boston, Joe? WELLER: Missing the wife? JIMBO: What? WELLER: Come on. I know everything now. You have a price on your head, you come over to hide. You run out of money. You go back to your robbing ways. The game's up, Joe. Come on. Surrender now. We can work all this out. - Help! Mister! - Shh! - We been kidnapped! - Shh! Wait, boys. [Yelling] - Who's that? - SOPHIE: Shh! Shh! [Hangs up] You're married? Uh... JIMBO: You see? - Look... - He's a liar. MARY ELLEN: You no-good bastard! For God's sake, Mary Ellen, don't! Run, lads! Lads, for God's sake, run. I'll fucking kill yous all! I'm sorry, Mary Ellen. It was a mistake. My kids are being held hostage! [Recording] Help! Mister! We've been kidnapped! - [Yelling] - SOPHIE: Shh! Oh, Jesus. Two boys, a woman with an accent, a Belfast man and a baby. Makes it slightly more difficult if we need to take Maguire out. What the fuck are you talking a... Why are you still here? Hi. James Buckley, Ministry of Defence. What can I do for you, James? Listen. Uh, you're to deploy the SAS team. Why? This is a police operation. I know, but it's direct orders from the Prime Minister's office. This suspect, Maguire, he's Catholic, isn't he? I have no idea. Well, we can't have the Police Service of Northern Ireland shooting him. It's terrible for community relations. Well, what if he's a Protestant? Same difference. It's not in keeping with the PSNI's new image. And how about if he's an American? What? The suspect has connections with the mafia in America. He's American? - Yes. - Okay. Under no circumstances, even if he comes out with guns blazing, are any of your men to shoot an American. Countries have been bombed for less. Holy moley. Can you imagine the paperwork? I've been on the force for over 30 years, and I've never yet fired a shot in anger. I'm hardly likely to start now. That's what I like to hear. However, if it does get messy, then the bad boys take over. [Chuckles] And, by the way, can you include Captain Farnsworth in all decision-making processes? It's just he gets a bit sad if he's left out. Good man. I'll make sure there's a Queen's Medal in this for you. Calm down, Mrs. Jones. We're gonna take care of this. We've no need for this. There, now. Come on. Careful, lads. Keep your heads down. You know they're good boys. It's just that useless gob shite of a da of theirs. Very good boys, they are. [Playing notes] I will kill you two. Go on. I dare you. Why didn't you tell me you were married? Yeah. Why don't you tell us about your family in America? Why don't you tell her? You're the one that's here to do the dirty work. What are you talking about, "dirty work"? You're a cheating, no-good scumbug. - I ought to kill you now. - What are you... You have no idea, do you? Hey, calm down. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. - I don't. - My mum, that's what I'm talking about. What about your mom? Don't tell me you don't remember. Jesus Christ. You'll be the same, used and abandoned. Who... Who is your mom? Phyllis. Phyllis Regan. Phyllis Regan. I don't know her. - Yes, you do. - No, I don't. Yes, you do. Is that you and her... when yous were together? Ph-Ph... Um... Okay. Phyllis. Okay. Yeah, fine. It's Phyllis. JIMBO: You remember that photograph? Yeah, I do. It was at the beach. What beach? The... At the big... Coney Island? You don't remember the most famous beach in the world? You don't even remember? - Right. Get into the toilet. - Hey, hey. Move. Get into the toilet till I figure out what to do, because... - Just get into the toilet! - All right! - [Scratching] - Boys, come, come, come. Hey, into the toilet, all of yous. Go. Mister, I need to go to the toilet. You're going into the toilet. But I need to go on me own. Please, me first, mister. I said it first. Okay, right. You go, quick. SOPHIE: Hurry up. ANNOUNCER: The standoff continues, with police sources confirming that the siege is related to the earlier fish market robbery. The PSNI... We pulled off a big one today, lads. Big operation. Great driver. [Chuckles] [Flushing] Ah, you took a shite. Why'd you not let me go first, then? Get in there. I'm gonna take a shite, too, then. SOPHIE: [groans] [Clock ticking] [Flushing] Can we talk about this? JIMBO: No, we can't. Get in there. I need time to think. Go. [Helicopter hovering outside] Do you remember his mother? Yes, I remember Phyllis. Um... My father owned a bar in the eighties. She came over from Belfast to work as a cocktail waitress, and we dated for a few weeks. We had a summer fling, and she went back to Ireland, and that was that. Mister, have you got any cigarettes? - Hey! - What? Sit down. [Together] We're sorry, missis. [Sighs] Jesus. That's why he's been stalking me. Heh. I thought Whitey had sent him. Who is Whitey? Whitey Barrett is the head of the Irish mafia in Boston. Yeah, he has a daughter named Tracey, who I'm married to. Well... I'm not. I am trying to get a divorce, and look at this. She took a knife. She stabbed me in the arm while I was asleep. Then she goes to her daddy, and he sends a hit man after me. I had to get out of there. Boys! JOE: Anyway, I came here to hide, and then I see this kid stalking me, and that's why I had a gun. What gun? JOE: The gun. I had a... The one that the policewoman saw. - Policewoman? - The... Oh, my God. This is such a mess. You know, he thinks you are his father. Man, I guess I could be. Scaling. Go. Go. [Sean fussing] We're in position. WELLER: Very good. Keep 'em there until I say otherwise. - You in there! - Very well. - Let me through! - Hey, watch it, will you? MARY ELLEN: Don't you touch me! - Where the hell are they? - Who are you? - Hold on there, missis. - Hey, you. Are you in charge here? FARNSWORTH: Just calm down. Step back. Who is that woman? I want my children now. You, get out here. We have to go home, mister. Me ma will kill us. Shut up, and stay in there. Please, don't do anything foolish. - All right. - Okay, now. Shh. Sit down, or I'll bring those Umgazi. What's the Umgazi, missis? They are fierce, dark, crazy spirits. They take children in the night to the swamp. Okay, now sit down. Be quiet, or the Umgazi. [Clock ticking] So how's your mom? Say her name. Phyllis. How is Phyllis? She died four years ago of breast cancer. Oh. I'm sorry. Look, I don't know your name. It's Jim. JOE: Look, Jim, - this was a long time... - What's better, that your father can't remember your mother or that he decided to pretend she doesn't exist? Which would you prefer? I'm truly sorry, Jim. And what about all the letters you wrote? Were they all lies? What letters? The letters from California, when you were a stunt man on Raiders of the Lost Ark, when you were working on the oil rigs in Texas. She read them all to me. Why did you stop writing? I swear to God I never wrote any letters. Your mom and I... Phyllis... we were together for a couple of weeks, and then she left, and I never saw her again. We were kids. Uh... What are you saying to me, that she made all that up? I... I... Bollocks. Jim, I... Bollocks. You're doing my head in. Go easy. Calm down. - Jim... - Shut up. I... I... Look, Jim, I... I truly do believe that... - Shut up. - I do believe... Shut fucking up! - My... - Get down. - Get down on the ground. - Don't do this. Get down! - Get down on the ground. - Calm down. [Gasping] I can't handle this. It's no good. I'm sorry. JIMBO: I'm sorry. [Click] Hmm. - No! - [Sean crying] Oh, my God. Don't do that. No. Sorry. Stay away from me. - Son, listen to me. Don't do that. - Let me be. Please, it's not worth it. Don't. Just put that down. It's all right. Think of your son. Whatever it is, we can work it out. Please! Help! I swear. I'll fix it. Help! Help this child! He'll die! He's stuck! - What? - What? - [Pounding] - SOPHIE: Come on! Come on! JIMBO: What's wrong? He's choking. - JOE: What the... - Help! Missis! Them Umgazis are gonna kill me! Help! Help! Get away from me! - Get away! - I'm trying to help you. Missis, them Umgazi, they're gonna... Sir, it appears his head's stuck between the bars. Is he trying to escape, or is he spying for the Yank? Soap. Quick, quick, quick. Get away! Here. Put this... - What is that? - JOE: Never mind. There's an adult male, appears to be pulling him back now. [Grunts] Gee. - [Pop] - Ohh. SOPHIE: Are you okay? [Telephone ringing] BOY: What was that? Soap. Hello. Listen, Maguire, if you harm that child, I will see to it that you rot in jail for the rest of your life. Do you hear me? I will call you back. BOY: What did you see out there? SECOND BOY: Shut up. I'm trying to listen. SOPHIE: Just sit down, and behave. JOE: We need to talk. [Sighs] [Police dispatch chatter] What are you doing here? The children are my concern. And I suppose they're not mine, eh? Why did you come here? She's their mother. I thought she could help. She's a madwoman. - I don't want a fucking coffee. - Look at her. I want my kids back. Don't suppose there's any chance we'll get her out of here now. I'll take care of her. Don't worry. We won't be a problem. "We"? Oh, no, no, no. You are out of here. This is way out of your league. What is my league, Daddy? You wanted me to join the force, but now I'm only good for community relations and paperwork? I want to be here. Please, for the first time in your life, give me some respect. You think you can control that woman without me? Go on ahead. - MARY ELLEN:...to get off your arses... - You go over - and talk to her. - And get my kids back. How long have we been here? How much time are we wasting? We don't know what's happening in there. Please! You can stay. Just keep out of the way. JOE: You came to the store because you needed help. You did what any son would do. You turned to your father. Now, I want to help you. But first you're gonna have to put that thing down before it goes off and kills someone. [Sean fussing] [Piano playing] Hey, guys, knock it off. BOY: Okay. So tell me everything. Last Christmas, when Sean was born... I had no money, so I borrowed some from Mad Dog Flynn. The gangster guy? You know him? We've met. Trust me, I know the type. Go on. I owe him a lot of money. They definitely said this American was involved in the fish market robbery? That's what they said on the news. Who'd have thought it, eh? It went from 500 to 2,000 in two months, and that's when he gave me an extra 1,000 in his casino to win it back. And I tried to win it back by gambling... and that didn't work. Next thing, it's 5,000, and he's... saying he's gonna give me two days, or he's gonna take Sean. SOPHIE: What? What? You cannot just go and take a baby. He can. Why do you think they call him Mad Dog? He's killed loads of people during the Troubles. He'd just take Sean off me, and if I tried to say anything to him, he'd bury me. Why didn't you go to the police? Police have been trying to get Mad Dog since I was a wee boy. They can't touch him. [Fussing] That's why I robbed the fish market, to get the money back. All I got was this brown bag. The tinker boys and Maguire, we know about, but who's this mystery man with the baby and the woman with the accent? Boss, check this out. Mad Dog Flynn. What's he doing here? I don't know. [Sighs] Jeez. All we need is Bono, and we'd have a fucking musical. 500, 600 at the most. Everybody uses debit cards these days. What's this? I don't know. Hello. Passports. "Horace Generoux" from Montreal. Horace Generoux, my arse. That's Mad Dog Flynn. That's what his ma must have been talking about. This must be Mad Dog's bag. He's a dual citizen apparently. What's this? I don't know. Hang on a minute. - What? - Look... let's get a magnifying glass. There we go. You see that? That's Augustus. This is Roman Sestertius. It's worth about 200 grand. That is a Penny Red. Here, give us a look. No, no, no, no. Shh. I'm dead. No, you're not dead. You let me worry about Mad Dog. Right now, all we gotta do is think about how to get out of here safely. [Distant siren blaring] Have to get that bag back. How are you, M.D.? You saw all the cops around there now. Exactly. My photo's in that bag, as well as a fortune in stolen gear. How did that Yank know about it? You don't think my ma's in on this, do you? Jesus, Mad Dog, not your ma. I'll kill her if she is. No way, M.D. I hope the cops don't shoot that Yank. I want him tortured when he goes to jail, to find out how he knew about that bag. Can't let the cops get their hands on it. Or else maybe... Or else what? Blow the place up. Burn it down. Destroy the evidence. Jesus Christ, M.D. Half the cops in Belfast are around it. [Overlapping chatter] This is the best place for us now. When are you gonna get my boys? They're all sitting around on their arses. Don't worry, Mary Ellen. Things are happening. Can I get you a wee cup of tea to soothe your nerves? That'll be lovely, son. You're awful good to me, son. I hope I can make you your tea. I'll be right back. - [Spits] - Why don't you get off your arse? This is your chance to stand up to this thug. I'm gonna get you out of this. I don't know. You can bring this guy down. One of those big cranes. Get a big petrol drum, Swing it across. Drop it in the shop. Boom. Is there a crane near there? I haven't seen one, Mad Dog. Have you not? How 'bout we get two big 5-gallon cans, strap them to you, give you some matches, and you go in there? You up for that, Hatchet? MAN: [chuckles] What about me? You're a fucking idiot. Go and get Big Bertha. I thought we destroyed her as part of the cease-fire. Aye, we said we did. You think I'd destroy a lovely lassie like that? This is where she is. [Telephone rings] Sir, that's Maguire calling for you. WELLER: Ah, tired and hungry. Told you. Hello there. We need to talk. Right. Go ahead. We want no violence. We end this thing peacefully. WELLER: I'm all for that. Listen, why don't you, uh, send out the children and the baby? You know, show of good faith. We're all coming out. You're all coming out? Right now? Great. No. No, no, no. We have, uh, a few preconditions first. WELLER: Like what? JOE: I'll meet you out front. We do this face to face. All right. I'm coming on my own. All right. Grab me a vest. Will do, boss. All right, get the floodlights up. And you tell your men that I'm going over there. Now, they can cover me, but under no circumstances are they to take aggressive action. MAN: Ah! I've lost me fucking sneaker. SECOND MAN: Told you you should have brought some rope. Hurry up. SAS MAN: All right. Move it. Boss. This woman says her husband and her baby are missing. Did he have the baby in a pram? [Exhaling] BOY: Bet you I can. You all right? I need to pee. Uh, well, go. You won't run away and leave me? God, no. Go. You swear? I swear. You can leave that thing. Just leave it. BOY: Let me see it. [Boys chatting] Okay. JIMBO: Thanks. [Sighs] Do you think he's your son? Well, he sure has my bad luck. Wow. Sophie, I am so sorry for dragging you into all this. It's not your fault. Can you give me another chance? You can have your chance, Joe Maguire. Ooh! Ooh! Hey! Umgazi. We're sorry, missis, honestly. I don't want to see them Umgazis again. Again? What do you mean, "again"? I saw it, mister, I swear, when me head was stuck. They're out in the back. Tell me everything that you saw. They were all black, with a big mask and wires coming out of their heads and guns, all sorts of guns. They were scary, mister. Uh... come with me. Here. Sit down. You, too. - SOPHIE: Stay here. - [Toilet flushing] JOE: Jim, turn that light off. What's wrong? There's snipers in the backyard. [Sean cries] Light 'em up. BOY: What's happening, mister? - [Gasping] - What are they doing? WELLER: Maguire. JOE: I'm coming out. WELLER: Well, Mr. Maguire, it's a fine pickle you got yourself into. This isn't what it looks like. Oh, yeah? I'm all ears. Here. Ah, she's a beauty. Here. Be fuck-all left of that shop, that's for sure. Heh heh. - Now you're talking. - Right. Let's get this show on the road. And, uh, he runs inside my store. That's quite a yarn, very good. All right, how about if I give you something that you really want? Like I said, I'm all ears. Mad Dog Flynn. Mad Dog Flynn? He's taking too long. Shh. JOE: There's two fake passports. There's rare coins, very rare stamps. Is there a Penny Red? Yeah, in mint condition. How did you know? Big heist about a year ago from a private collection. Thought Mad Dog was behind it. Now you got the evidence. - It's not enough. - I've got a witness. Oh, yeah? Who? The kid, he'll testify against Mad Dog for extortion, torture, threatening to kidnap a baby. He'll testify? Yes, but you have to put him and his family in a witness protection program somewhere abroad. Look... you get a major gangster off the streets of Belfast, and you resolve a hostage situation peacefully. - Get in. - Quick, get in the back. - Get in. - Here he comes. What's happening? - Everything's gonna be okay. - Aye? - [Sean crying] - I can make a deal with him. I'm gonna have to take this little guy out with me now, okay? Attend your targets, and hold your position. Received. Over. Hey. MAN: What's going on? - [Cooing] - JOE: Here he is. Very good. That's a start. - [Farts] - [Crying] [Groans] Not much of a baby-sitter, are you? Hey, you can't come through there! Oi! Come back here! [Crying] MARY ELLEN: Where's my boys?! Hey, wait a minute. Where are you... - What the... - Where are they?! - Stop! Wait! - Oh, fuck you. - Come here, you. - We're sorry, Ma. - Come here. - I'm sorry. - Stop! Stop, or I'll shoot! - Put that down! If you don't get out of my way, I'll stick that gun up your arse! - No! Come on! - [Yelling] Let her go. Do it. Do it. - Whoa! - Down! Give me that thing! What are you doing?! FARNSWORTH: Place yourself. - Get out of here! - Joe! - Come away! Get over! - Holy shit. - Are you okay? - I'm all right. I'm all right. Get the baby. Get in... Get in here! I'm all right. Hold your fire. Stand down. All units, stand down now. Nobody shoot! Don't shoot! Let it go. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. JOE: What are you thinking? Who the fuck let that woman go? What kind of a Mickey Mouse operation is this? Hey, get your boss. Home Secretary, Northern Ireland Secretary, Queen, I don't care who it is. Get them on the phone for me now. Put me through to Deputy Secretary Buckley at the MOD. WOMAN: Okay, sir. Right away. What did I tell you? I couldn't just leave you, Dad. You all right? Damn knee went out again. - [Winces] - MARY ELLEN: Tell me now, - who told you... - You did good, son. To get in that sofa? Was it your da? Go and pacify that woman, will you? And tell her to stop beating her children, or you'll arrest her for cruelty. Shut up, or I'll... We'll need the SAS for that. Undersecretary Buckley. Hello, sir. No, but everything's going according to plan. Well, I just need authority to make a deal. No, I believe we can nail a major criminal, someone I've been after for years. MAN: Okay, let's go. [Telephone ringing] JOE: Okay. Are you trying to get somebody killed here? That was not our fault. All right. I'll see you at the door. Help me up. WELLER: Right. Right. Come on. - Coming out. - That's fine. All right. Have we got a deal? Yeah. Deal. But this is how we do it. Bring out the woman and the bag first. Then you bring the kid out and yourself. MAD DOG: Hurry up. Get that thing up and ready. WELLER: All right, lady. HATCHET: Shit. Fuck, Mad Dog. That's the bag. I know that's the bag. Get on with it. Now. Quickly. He's giving the evidence away. Switch the safety off. WELLER: Show me this evidence. - What is this? - What? Where's the passport? What are you talking about? Where's the evidence? No, this is a mistake. - Ju... No, I'll... - Don't mess with me. MAD DOG: Come on. He's taking it back inside. - Where's the stuff? - SOPHIE: What's wrong, Joe?! - Go on. Get back. Come on. - Perfect. - The passports? The coins? - It's in the bag. No, it's not in the bag. It's empty. Hit it, boss. Aah! - Shit. I missed. - [Alarm blaring] Jesus Christ. What was that? That was an RPG. - Get up, you stupid bastards. - Ah, God. - Where'd it come from? - Shoot, boss. - Wait! Wait! - Aah! Fuck! [Screams] Joe! Ohh. Come back. Come back. You can't go in there. Come on. Come on. Get back. - Move! Move! - Come on! Let's go! FARNSWORTH: Fire at will. Ah, jeez. Get the fire engines in there now. Move it. Come on. Let's go. Go! Go! Go! [Sirens blaring] This constable's gonna take you to the ambulance. JIMBO: Help! Hey! - What the... - Someone's in here! - We got survivors here! - Help! [Coughing] FIREMAN: Andy, we've got two survivors! - Come over here, and give me a hand. - Are you okay? [Coughing] Ah, my eyes. [Coughing] JIMBO: What happened? [Laughs] Joe. SOPHIE: Joe! [Crying] Annie. - Jim! - Annie! Am I all right? You're fine. You're perfect. - [Laughs] - Maguire. The deal's off. No evidence. - What? - Take him in. Wait. Wait. I know what happened. Oh, yeah? Are you the Umgazi? Show us your gun. Just eat your chips. Go on. [Western movie music playing] Where is it? Tell me, or I will cut the tripe out of the both of yous. Wait. Guys, just tell us where you put the stuff. I'll buy you a new piano. You will in your arse. I didn't touch it, I swear. But I think it fell into the pram. [Cries] Excuse me. Yes. Here you go. That's it. That's what you need. [Chuckles] Perfect. Right. Let's shut this little circus down. I'll deal with you in the morning. JOE: It'll be okay. Thank you, son. You did a great job. I'm proud of you. Not as proud as I am of you. You're a great policeman. Ah... Hey, Dad. I... I have a confession to make. Oh, Randy, I have a lot on my plate. No, no, no, no. I have to say it. You know in the morning when I go running? Well, I don't. I... I go to Mass with Mommy. I'm Catholic. Five years now. I- I'm really sorry. All right, all right. I... I suppose I'll get used to it. At least you didn't tell me you're... Please, son, no more confessions. Not tonight. Jesus Christ. OFFICER: Let's go. You better get going with them. SOPHIE: Take care. Okay. Come on. Take care, Joe. I thought you were dead. You can't get rid of me that easy. [Chuckling] [Tires skid] MAD DOG: Did you throw Bertha in the river? Aye. Crying shame, Mad Dog. - She's useless now. - Why? 'Cause we've no fucking rockets, you idiot. OFFICER: Don't you move, sunshine! Still! Good evening, Inspector. I was just leaving, but you can warm yourself by the fire. Planning a trip, are you? I might. Have a nice house in Majorca. You should come down there. The wee shed out back with a nice patch of mud that you could roll in. [Chuckles] Well, your trip's been canceled. Passport's out of date. [Music playing] - What do you think? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Good. Try this. JOE: Hey, look. SOPHIE: There they are. - JOE: Hey. - Hey. - Good morning. - Here we are. Come on, wee man. ANNIE: Good morning. Ah, you guys. Hey. Come here. ANNIE: Yeah, yeah. Come on. You okay? Yeah. We're all packed. Well, take care of these two guys. Yeah. - Come here. - Yeah. SOPHIE: Hey, there's that baby. Ohh. Do you really think you are my dad? [Chuckles] I'm sure of it. [Sean fussing] Very good. Cool. JIMBO: Okay, we gotta go. Good luck. ANNIE: Bye, now. Bye. - JOE: Bye, Sean. - Bye-bye. SOPHIE: Bye! Well, Mr. Maguire, think you got more than you bargained for hiding out in Belfast, eh? Yeah. No kidding. This just came in from Boston. "Whitey Barrett, FBI informant"? You're kidding. I think you're the least of his problems now. And, uh, about my gun? Oh, that peashooter of yours? There was no firing pin in it. - No firing pin? - No. We'll call it an antique. Okay. Behave yourself. Yes, sir. I don't know about you, but I need some breakfast and... - Come. - Yeah, come on. SOPHIE: Let's eat. # Well, let me kiss the lips that whisper to me # # Uttering the words that burn right through me # # Hold me in your arms # # Hold me in your arms, baby # # And let me hold the hands # # That once caressed me # # Hands that made me sin # # But then confessed me # # Hold me in your arms # # Hold me in your arms, baby # # Ah, well, you said I never stood strong in the hard times # # And maybe you're right # # But I swear I will tonight # # Yeah, when you hold me in your arms # # You know I want to be the one that stands beside you # # Baby, in your life # # Baby, be with me tonight # # Oh, and hold me in your arms # # Hold me in your arms # # Hold me in your arms # # Hold me in your arms # # Hold me in your arms # [new song playing] # Well, if there's something I can give # # You need only ask me # # 'Cause you help me, now I'll help you # # It's the way it should be # # As I walk along these streets # # The ones I'd once forsaken # # And people that I knew # # I see a light awaking # # Well, nothing much has changed # # Mostly still the same # # Cold sun shines through rain # # Yet Belfast is born again # # Oh, nothing much has changed # # Mostly still the same # # And the cold sun shines through rain # # Yet Belfast is born again # # Mm mm, mm mmm mm, mm mm #
