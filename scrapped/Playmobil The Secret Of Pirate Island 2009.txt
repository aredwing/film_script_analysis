The same question over and over. Hey, remember the song Gram taught us? I do. Dad. -Oh, there you are. -Hello, Amelia. -Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. -Hey, Mom. Hey, Gramps. Mary, Tom. HoW are you? Oh, it's so nice to see you. -So hoW Was the drive? -Great. We sang your song. You call that singing? Mom and Dad liked it. Mom and Dad Were being polite. Like When they say you're Witty? Amelia is very Witty. So, What are you kids up for? Let's go exploring. The boy's got spirit. The boy's a loose cannon. That's because he acts before he thinks. Hey, I'm only 7. So Where should We play? HoW about up in the attic? -No Way. -Amelia's afraid of heights. It's dusty up there. -They could go explore outside. -Yeah. Let's climb trees. Oh, I forgot. Amelia's afraid of heights. Maybe you could help her overcome her fear. And, Amelia, you could teach Jack not to just barrel into things. Whatever you decide, be careful. And, Jack. Listen to your sister. -That Will be a first. -Come on. No. No. -Tom. -They're ready, Mary. I Was even younger. They'll be fine, dear. Look at all this stuff. Must have taken years to collect. Check this out. I am all-poWerful. Well, I'm a magical princess. You Will obey my commands. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. And if you don't, I'll sic a nasty mummy after you. Bring him on. Because I'm a big, bad... ...voodoo daddy. Jack. Amelia, look. -Come on. -Jack. It's a schooner. You can tell by the tWo masts. Jack, We have to go back. Schooners are really fast ships. They Were usually sailed by-- Pirates. Is me sWeet sailing vessel shipshape and seaWorthy? Come on, We gotta hide. Quick, in that barrel. Gaptooth, has me beauty been scraped and cleaned? Clean as a Whistle, captain. Scrape it clean, Washing machine. Cookie, did you replace that Worn-out plank? All set, captain. Plumpy tank gonna break the plank. Bring me cracker barrel aboard. Yummy crackers. Settle doWn there, Sea Biscuit. What do they make these crackers out of? Lead flour? Deck sWabbed, supplies loaded and battened doWn, sir. Excellent, me hearty. Hey. Buckethead. Blasted bilge rat, Where are you? Yes, sir. Weigh anchor, and set sail. Yes, sir. Bird brain. Bird brain. NoW, noW, Sea Biscuit. We ain't all born With natural smarts. Sails patched and riggings tight. Hoist the Jolly Roger. Aye, aye, captain. Heave-ho, mateys. Hard biscuits packed, and I just Whipped up a batch of your favourite. Don't mind if I do. Yummy cookies, yummy cookies. Blasted bird, quit your squaWking. Those cookies sure smell good. Why don't you ask the captain if you can have one? Okay. There ain't nothing like sailing the high seas. Sea Biscuit Want a cracker. Maybe this Wasn't such a good idea. Gee, you think? You didn't have to folloW me. Dad told me to do What you said. Nice birdie. Monkeys in the barrel. Quiet, bird. Let me enjoy the vieW. Kids cracking the crackers. StoWaWays sitting on our stash. What? StoWaWays? In me cracker barrel? Scurvy dogs. After them. Amelia, this Way. I can't. On second thought.... Look. There's something out there. It's big. It's scary. We've gotta Warn the pirates. If they catch us, We'll be chopped like a salad. If We don't, We'll be sleeping With the fish. Hey, pirates. Look. In the Water. Ahoy. Thar she bloWs. WoW, What a beauty. -Fire. -No. I just patched that sail. Amelia, do something. Can't We have a sing-along another time? WoW, you're good. Amelia, he likes it. Hold your fire. Gotcha, you rascal. Keep singing, lassie. You've tamed the beast. Sing it, sister, sing it. That Was some performance. Bravo, me buckos. Do you realise you just made friends With Chumley... ...the legendary giant octopus? Piece of cake. Any time you need help, just let us knoW. Come on, Jack. Just Where do you kids think you're going? Well, to tell you the truth.... We're lost. That does pose a problem. And I have a solution. Make them Walk the plank. Bootflap, you're a cold one. Feed them to the sharks. I could use some target practise. But they saved the ship. Besides, We could use a couple more deck hands. Pegger, you lazy spud. Any excuse to get out of Work. -Not me, I love Work. -Me too. No one ever helped me When I Was young. I had to do it all myself. It's just not fair. Bootflap, you've got some issues. We'll keep you along until the next port of call. Can I steer the ship and hoist the flag? Listen here, buckos. You'll be sWabbing the deck and scrubbing the chum buckets. And mopping me cage. -Aye, aye, captain. -Then it's settled. Welcome aboard. This calls for a party. So is this Where the gig's at then? That Captain Gruff, he's hard to figure. Either he's getting soft in his old age.... Or he's setting those poor kids up for something really heavy. With that scurvy creW, nobody's safe. Why, they'd bloW a man doWn for a Wooden nickel. Are We gonna jam, or What? NoW all you groovy cats Watching at home... ...feel free to sing along. And get up off of that couch and shake your booty. Get it? Booty. Like pirate treasure.
