 

                        The building was erected in 1879. As I explained to your assistant, you've got the 16th, Just write a draft and I'll look at it when I get back. Before I forget, I got two manuscripts on my desk. Make copies and send them home with the partners and send me additional copies 'cause I don't wanna carry that shit. After the previous owner died, the estate asked us to handle the matter. - However, the company-- - How many times is that? Eight. Who calls someone eight times in a week? Four bedrooms, five baths. A housekeeper to take care of the 11,000 square feet of space-- Who else? Yeah. I'll talk to them. Patch me through. Well, try him on his cell phone. Tribeca, Soho and beyond-- Make me care. The bathroom has a-- Kristen, you didn't-- A Jacuzzi. Fine, send me the draft when you're done. Bye. The private elevator handles all three floors, as well as the rest of the building. Bec, you still on? Who else do I owe? Who? Dunlap? No, I don't even know who that is. Hey, Bec, ahem, I'm finishing up, so I'll just try you from the car. As I mentioned, the company is in no rush. Well, actually I am. What do I have to do to get this place and still make my 1:00 o'clock? Jesus Christ. You're pitching me a story about a haunted house without doing the work. Make me care. Create a back-story, develop a mythology. Write a story about you writing a story. Heh. That's scary. Now, why on earth would you put me on the phone with him? I know, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This is dog shit. These two need charged. Uh, Garret called again. Why is my best friend stalking me? Leave a message with his assistant. Tell him I was busy-- What? He didn't get the job. I was supposed to make a call, wasn't I? I reminded you for a week. The partners needed your reference. Send him a basket. The Barneys' one. Write him a note, tell him... How sorry I am, that I'm thinking of quitting and that all the partners are fucks. But you are a partner. The other partners. Hey, David. David, uh, you didn't, you know, maybe possibly have a chance to look over the story I gave you, did you? Shit. No. But I'm gonna blow through a stack of reading as soon as I get home. I'll see ya. Hey! Ouch! Ow. - Oh. - Oh. Shit. I am so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. I'm, uh-- I'm awake now. Coffee was supposed to do that, but... I guess I owe you a caf mocha. With soy. And a towel. With soy and a towel. I have those. Well, your pockets must be a lot bigger than they look. No, not on me. I, uh-- I live in this building, here. Wow. It's a great building. Yeah, I love it. I just moved in. You wouldn't know it. You must do very well for yourself. These places are pretty exclusive. I do okay. One caf mocha with soy. Thank you. So, what is it you do "okay" at? I, uh, represent writers. Books. Hm, what kind of books? Horror mostly. Well, entirely. Must get into your head. Is that why you were running so fast? Monsters after you? Horror is scary 'cause it plays on your fears. That's all. What are you afraid of? Having a party tonight. You wanna come? You didn't answer. Neither did you. Check your guest list, David Lamont. You did invite your neighbors. Audrey Levine, third floor. Pleasure. Thanks for the drink. You didn't think I'd come in to a stranger's apartment, did you? Well, I just thought you were easy. I am. You're just not that charming. See you tonight. Great. - Hi. - Hey. Pretty dress. Give me a flat water, no ice. Bobby Reed. Ha, ha. Congratulations on the book, buddy. Thank you, David. It's been-- Hard to believe only two weeks on the Times, no Oprah. What's up with that? Well-- But I'm sure your agent knows what he's doing. Have a good time. I guess preppy is making a comeback. Hi. You headed to a birthday party afterward? It's for you. Happy house-warming. House-war--? It just rolls off the tongue with this one. Joe Grimpel, Kathy Mahoney, this is my assistant. You'll have to excuse her. We're still working on group interaction. You guys have a good time. But his agent... I hate... Excuse me, I hope I wasn't-- I wasn't interrupting you. Are you kidding me? You finally saved me. - That's Kathy. - Oh... You know, the party, it just turned out to-- To really be something else. And the food is just-- Beautiful night. Sorry. Do I know you? I think we may have bumped into each other. You have a lovely place. It's a great building. I think you've said that before. Actually, I think you've said that before. Can I get you something to drink? Preferably without soy. As long as you promise not to run. You look great. There you are! I have been looking all over for you. How are you, my brother? How are you? Doing all right, ahem. You holding up? Fucking great. Never bitter-- Or better. Never better. Great party, man. What are you doing? Partying. Drinking. What? Did I interrupt something in there? Sorry. You're pissed off. How'd you guess? You know, if you want to be mad at me, Garret, that's fine. But don't be a pussy about it. Be direct. Just air it out. Direct? Like the basket you got me? David, I invented the "fuck you" basket. It wasn't a "fuck you" basket. No, that would require you actually dictate the letter. - I did dictate it. - Hey, look, man! I'm, uh-- I'm not even pissed at you. I'm pissed at me for believing that I could count on you. Christ. And when you lose your job and your best pal steals your clients and then makes a dash for another agency... - Oh, come on! -...that's shit! That's not what happened. Okay. Tell me what happened. Come on, I'm all ears. You're in a slump, Garret. A professional slump. Slump... Hmm. So the book's a total mess. Hey. This should be my life, my party, my place. Sorry. Fuck you! Fuck you. What in the fuck did you write in that note to him? Just what you told me to. Did I do something wrong? Did that look like it went well? Have you seen Audrey Levine? Five-seven, brown hair, black dress. Her name wasn't even on the li-- David Lamont? Yeah. My name is Martin Soll, detective, N.Y.P.D. Sorry, Mr. Lamont, for calling at this hour. That makes two of us. What, uh, is this about, detective? There's a guy downstairs who claims that you're squatting in his residence. Do you have the deed to this place? My lawyer does. I'll give you his phone number. This is his home and his cell. Who is he? Uh, Jared Thurber. Uh, his father was the previous owner. He claims that when the old man died, you moved in here illegally. Well, I can assure you, the transaction was entirely legit. Well, if you say so. Hopefully, I can get back to some real work, and... you can get back to all this. Oh, I almost forgot. In case anything comes up. Like what? Hey... it's New York. The only penalty you ought to worry about is the one I'll impose on your ass for wasting my time. He's the one fucking wasting your time. God fucking damn it! Either you're gonna do something about it, or I am. It's my house. Well, we'll find that out directly. After you. We let 'em slide on advances, the next thing you know, quotes are gonna be 80% of what they are now. My client doesn't need the advance. - He'll do the work. - Without incentives-- Hang on. Your client doesn't need the advance. Well, that's mighty kind of him. My top five clients brought in an estimated, what? Fifteen million dollars worth of advances last year. My bottom five, zero. That's because your clients were dictating the terms of their deals from a cabin in Maine, wearing a fucking bathrobe. Every day is a war. Be generals for chrissake. No, no. I'll be done here, uh, soon. Like 45 minutes. Yes, we're just-- We're wrapping up. No, no, okay. Call somebody at The New Yorker. I got some renewal thing. I have to go, bye-bye. I shouldn't have to pay for it. Okay. Uh, this came for you today. What is it? A thank-you note from Andrew Dunlap. Never heard of him. Put it with the others. I just thought you should see it since he wasn't invited. He's a writer. He's-- He's the one that you told to write a story about himself writing a story. Let me see it. Thank you. Can I help you? That's an odd thing to say. Do I look like I need help? You look lost. Actually, I'm very much at home. I know who you are. Then you know what I want. Sorry, pal. Can't help you. You got a problem, you call my lawyer. You're the one with the problem. Is that a threat? Get the fuck out of my face! Sleep tight, Davey boy. Just let it go. No, I'm not avoiding. He has no idea. No, look-- Will you trust me already? I am not a child. We are not having this conversation again. Look, I know what I'm doing. I'm convinced. Whoa. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Okay, well, I did mean to scare you a little bit, but you don't have to throw knives at me. You shouldn't leave that elevator open. That's twice now. I guess you owe me one. But actually, uh-- I came up here to ask you a favor. I have this terrible habit of misplacing things, and my assistant lives on the other side of town. What? Hey. Heh. I mean, if there's a problem, you don't have to do it, the hell with ya. You don't strike me as someone who misplaces things. Well, uh-- It always comes as a shock to me too. Did you messenger me something--? Rebecca David? Did you have something messengered over to my house? An envelope from the office? Oh, my God! I can't hear you. I'm in a club. Did you messenger an envelope to my house? I'll have to call you back! Fuck. I did owe you one. Hey. What are you doing? I never sleep with a man on the first date. But sex is okay? Heh. Sex is better than okay. Come back to bed. I just heard something. What? Right there. It's just the pipes. It's like that downstairs too. You'll get used to it. Small spaces. What? You asked me earlier what I was afraid of. Small spaces. Is that why you live here? I live here because I can. Well, I'm glad you're happy. I have to admit, this place always freaked me out a little bit. What do you mean, always? Um... Nothing. No, you said this place always freaked you out. What does that mean? Mm-- Nothing. It's just stories, you know? The guy that lived here before, he was a little weird. Well, what kind of stories? Just forget I said it. No, no. Wait a minute. You said stories. What kind of stories? David. Audrey! Sorry, I-- Story's my business. Just what I do. Anyway... call me later. We'll share stories. You're sure you didn't messenger me anything last night? Mm-hm. Sure. All right, get me Garret. I'm gonna leave a message. Jump off. Yo, it's me. Real fuckin' funny about the pictures. Ooh, I'm scared. You fucking jackass. Call me. Detective Soll, please. What are you thinking? It's Thurber. Slow down. First, ahem, you don't know who sent what. Second, you don't really even know what's in these pictures. And last, I checked the records back and forth. Nothing ever happened at your place. Period. Now, that's not to say that something didn't happen there-- Thank you. --and it just got covered up. Covered up? New York is a corrupt clusterfuck, just like any other city. Now, Thurber was a very powerful guy. He played squash at all the right clubs and threw parties. So where can I find him? Well, that's never gonna happen. So, what do we do? I'm not just gonna sit here on my hands. We are not gonna do anything. He knows we're on him. And you know where to reach me. It's all copacetic. Soll, it's Lamont. I found the tiles. The same tiles that were in the pictures. Something bad happened there. Call me. Rebecca David Lamont's office. I'm not coming in today. - Reschedule everything. - Uh, is everything okay? - Did you get Garret yet? - No, I haven't. I'm on my cell. Try me when you got him. - I need to talk to you now. - Um... Hang up. I tried to tell him you were busy-- I didn't know Thurber from Adam. - I only know real estate. - How 'bout any work? He have any, uh, renovations done to it? Yeah. Yeah, he had some work done to the, uh-- - The pool deck. - Uh-uh. Silver plumbing in the kitchen. - No, no. - That's it. Some cosmetic work to the, uh, bathroom, the stairs-- Bathroom. Let me see. When? When was this worked on? I don't know, David. Twenty years ago maybe. Doesn't say. That's weird. What? Computer says there's a police report here, but I can't find a file. What's that mean? Either someone took it, or it's here somewhere. That's brilliant work there, deputy. Since the Freedom of Information Act, this place is Grand Central Station. You could always send a written request, and within 10 days we'll get you what you need. Forget it. Forgotten. Hey! Come on! Hey! Camera on? Yeah. Case 29703725. Triple homicide. Entering the residence, we come upon the killing floor. We see the splayed body of victim number one. Victim: Caucasian, male, Head facing the north side of the penthouse. Multiple lacerations visible to the victim's throat. Blood spatter is evident. Victim number two: Caucasian, male, 8 to 10 years of age. Several stab wounds to the face. Victim number three: male, Caucasian, Ooh. What the hell is going on here, huh? Is that yours? Yeah, it came with the apartment. Four bedrooms and a big fuckin' knife. Well, how's about you just set that thing down, huh? How the fuck'd you get in here? You think this is funny? You think this is fuckin' funny? You called me, remember? I didn't come over here to play patty cake with your sorry ass, so unless you wanna go all the way, you are gonna drop this knife and take a seat. You left these in the elevator. And your laundry. I am not your fuckin' maid. What do you got to drink? Man 1 Head facing the north side of the penthouse. Multiple lacerations visible to the victim's throat. Blood spatter is evident. So? It looks authentic. Yeah, no shit, it's authentic. The killing floor. Mm. That's what they call it where they kill the animals in a slaughterhouse. Cops use it for where they find the bodies. You said nothing happened here. - I know what I said. - What do you call that? It's a knife. Maybe it's a murder weapon. Maybe it's not. I mean, we'll check it for prints. And if that's blood on there, we'll run the DNA. That's all I can do. What's going on, Soll? Exactly what they want. I mean, look at you. You are a mess. Death scenes show up at your doorstep, what do you do? You start tearing your place apart, and lookin' over your shoulder. I thought this was your business. What do you mean? Scaring the shit out of people. Looks like somebody's doing a pretty good job on you. Thurber? I don't know. Maybe. What do you know about him? What are you asking for? You're the one that brought him to me. Well, he's disappeared. What does that mean? You know, as in... vanished. The address he gave me turned out to be in the middle of the East River. You lost him? Nobody is lost without my say so. You fucking lost him?! The kid is a mistake. One which I will correct in time. Speakin' of which, yours is up. Hello. Man You really think that cop's gonna help you, Lamont? Who is this? Watch your step. Stay the fuck away from me, I swear to God-- Check the bedroom window again. Audrey! Audrey! No, no. Keep that off. Keep that-- Keep that-- What, David? What's wrong? What's the matter? Holy shit. Holy shit. You're freaking me out. Holy shit. Talk to me. Okay. Okay. I'm sure he's just trying to scare me. I don't know. Sounds dangerous to me. Thanks. Look, I know it's a great place, but maybe you should think of moving. Moving? No. I'm not gonna let someone just scare me out of my home. I'm just saying that-- No. I sai-- I mean, it's mine. Well, you can stay here as long as you want. You motherfucker! David! Fucking Garret! What the fuck? You motherfucker! You motherfucker! What the fuck is wrong with you? All this over some fucking clients? What the fuck is this? Huh? What the fuck is this? Goddamn it. What the fuck is this? "Formal apology." Jesus. - Hey. Hey. - Ow. I'm gonna get a towel. I'll get a towel. Yeah. I love what you did with the place. What happened to you? You've become an asshole. Somebody left-- I thought you were someone else. That's funny. I thought the same thing about you. Let me get some of this shit on there. Shit, you know what? I can't get it to stop, so let's just-- Let me run you to the hospital. It's all right. I can take care of it. I can take myself. - Garret, don't be ridic-- - Shut up. We'll have to do this again real soon. David. David? Hi. Hey. Oh, what time is it? It's 11:00. I tried to wake you up a little bit earlier, but, uh-- David-- David, I'm concerned. You seem a little bit off. Okay, what you got for me? Okay, well, you've got a board meeting at noon. At 12:00? Get me in, like, 55 minutes. David, you can't. Trust me, I can. Shut the door. David, please. You look like shit. Hey. Hey, you don't talk to me like that. I'm sorry, I didn't-- I'm sorry. It's just that this meeting is very important-- Yes, I'm very aware of what a fucking board meeting entails. I will have everything ready for you. I will make a pot of coffee. Your shirts just haven't come back from the cleaners yet. So, there is a Gucci just three blocks... - Okay, I'll go. -...away, on 51st. I'll go. Okay, I'll have everything ready for you by quarter to. - Shit. Give me my phone. - Oh, yes. Here. Three dollars Quick Pick. Gotcha. I found him. Soll Who is this? It's Lamont. Lamont, right, hey, I'm kind of busy right now. Hey, I found Thurber. Wha--? What? What do you mean you found him? Where? Alphabet City. The corner of 4th and B. I'm standing outside his apartment right now. Did he see you? - No. - Good. Get out of there. Why, so we can lose him again? He's not going anywhere. Unless he sees you. Get the hell out of there. I'll handle this. He's all yours. No! Hey, honey. You miss me? You want to hear about my day? Sure you wouldn't rather I put - some dinner on the table, dear? - Don't interrupt me, Audrey. 'Cause the one thing I've learned from all this is I'm capable of just about...anything. - David, you're not-- - Don't interrupt me! So the clouds of suspicion parted, and a shining ray of proof led me right to you... and Thurber. Did you know... that Soll actually lost him for a minute? I mean, don't ask me how. It's the fucking guy's job, right? But there he was, leading me right to his front door. After I called the police, I made another phone call. Any guesses? Goodman. You remember Goodman, don't you? You should. Because apparently, you placed a bid with him. On my fucking apartment! Imagine my surprise. But it wasn't your money, was it? Was it? Fucking talk! No, it was my father's. Bull shit! It was Thurber's! Thurber's dead, you asshole! You need-- You need to understand something. I've lost the will to control myself any longer. I just don't give a fuck. Of course, Thurber's dead. It's his son Jared. I saw you with him this morning at a coffee shop! I saw you, Audrey! I know! Thurber nev-- Never had a son. David-- David. You think I'm a fucking idiot? You think I wouldn't figure this shit out? Listen to me. Listen to me! I wanted your apartment, yes, but that's all, I swear. I-- I-I got a call from, uh-- From, uh, uh, a gallery owner today and he wanted to meet in the coffee shop, and he never showed. David, you have to trust me. I don't have to do shit. I still have the message on my voice mail. You can listen to it, David. David, why would I lie to you? Woman Thank you for calling Gotham Realty. Please leave a message after the tone. Goodman, it's David Lamont. I want out. List the fucker. Hello? What the hell happened Arther kid's apartment? Who is this? Ahem. What time is it? What the hell happened Arther apartment? Soll? Shit. What are you talking about? I left right after I called you. Yeah, well, I got some bad news for you. He's dead. Somebody cut him a new smile, ear to ear. His body's in the bedroom. Sound familiar? Jesus Christ. You ready for more? Well, Thurber ain't Thurber. His name is Frederick Hawkins. Some De Niro wannabe. Shakespeare in the park, that type of shit. You still there? He's an actor? Medical examiner just got here. I gotta go. How's your alibi? Shit. Yeah, I figured it might be. We got to talk. I'll be at your place as soon as I'm done here. Soll-- Hey. Rebecca? Oh, my God. Um... What is this? What is this? I'm sorry. Did you do this? Oh, my God. All of it? Why? No! No! Why?! Um-- Uh-- David-- I love you. - What? No. - I do. - No. No, you don't! - No, yes. Yes, I do. I'm sorry. I didn't know... - You can't. No-- -...howto make it go away. You tried to ruin my life! David, please don't say that. Please-- I've only wanted what's best for you. What's best for me? Stalking me, taking fucking pictures? But, David, please, listen. I know that I'm s-- I know what I did was wrong. I know what I did was wrong. It's just-- I just want to be close to you. I wanted to be close to you so badly that I just-- I swathe apartment across the street and-- And I just want to-- David, please, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just that-- I know that you're David Lamont and you would never be with somebody like me and I just-- You don't know. You don't even know. Oh, God, David. David, please, I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. Can you please just forgive me. Please. It's okay, Rebecca. - I'm sorry. - I said, it's okay. Hey, you've been watching the place. Who have you seen? - I don't know. - Who? Just think. Who? Rebecca, tell me. - Oh, God. I-in the-- - It's okay, just think. - You. - Okay. I don't, I me-- I see your housekeeper. Okay. Who else? Audrey. Just some friends of yours, like Garrett, um... That's not helping. Is that all? A messenger. A messenger? You saw a messenger? Was it a man? - What did he look like? - I don't know, David. - It was late at night-- - This is so important. Please. I don't know, David. I'm sorry. Okay. What are you gonna do? I got to call Soll. I got to talk to the police. Don't worry, I won't tell them about all this shit. I just saw him leave Audrey's apartment. Who, Soll? I'm sorry, David. Audrey! Audrey. Audrey. Where you been? Where's Audrey? Who's Audrey? Don't fucking bullshit me! You was just in her apartment. I don't know what you're talking about, Lamont. But you got a hell of a serious problem. Yeah-- Yeah, I've had a problem since the moment I met you. This kid, Thurber-- Hawkins. He's dead. Yeah, no shit. Murder weapon was left at the scene. Guess what? It looked exactly like...this. We dusted it for prints. We got a hit. Who? You. You know I-- Yeah, I had it in my hand-- You little pussy. If I didn't know you a little bit... didn't know that you were a narcissistic pretty boy... Fuck you. who'd sooner call a cop from halfway across the city than do his own dirty work, I would haul your ass in to the precinct right now with an airtight case. But that's not what my instincts are telling me. What are your instincts telling you, detective? Whoever killed that boy wouldn't have done it unless he didn't need him anymore. Hey, hey, I mean-- Relax. Now, he's coming for you. You better lock up. Take the second floor. Not now, Rebecca. I'm with Detective Soll. Rebecca That's what I'm calling about. He's not who you think he is. What are you talking about? When you said his name, I knew I heard it before. - In what? -Andrew Dunlap's novel, the one you rejected, the killer's name in it is Soll. Detective Soll. Downstairs is secure. David? I checked with the police department, there is no Detective Soll. Get out of there, David! Um, okay, Bec, uh-- We'll just go over that in the morning. So... is everything cool up here? Good. Dunlap. Hey, Lamont. Seems like we got off on the wrong foot. Sure feels that way. David! Calm down. Everything's gonna be fine. I'm a police officer, remember? Aw! Fuck! Get out! Lamont! Goddamn it. Nobody was supposed to get hurt. David. It was all an act. Lamont! This gun... is a fake. David! No, it was all an act! Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God. We should call the police. And say what? That there are two dead bodies in my house, Rebecca. Um... Maybe you should... Maybe you should call your lawyer first. Yeah, that's a good idea. He should be here when they get here. - I can't do that. - Why not? This all points to me. This all points to me. The bodies. It's a neighbor that I had an affair with. And it's a-a writer. A guy that-- That I invited in. But he was terrorizing you, David. But I have no proof. My phone records are gonna show that we called each other. He sent me a thank-you note to my fucking party, for chrissake. What about all of the things that he gave you? You said that he gave you photographs and tapes-- But every time I thought I was talking to the police, I was talking to him. I gave it all back. He killed Audrey. He killed Audrey, and they're gonna be able to prove that, you know? They're going to be able to find his fingerprints or his hair or something-- - Oh, my God. - What? What? My skin's under her fingernails. - Why would your skin be-- - We had a fight. Oh, my God. Oh, hey, Rebecca. I did not kill Audrey. I swear to God. I did not kill her. I'm fucked. Oh, boy... Okay... I know this is gonna seem really weird, but my parents have a farm two hours upstate, and they're out of town. So? There are ways to get rid of this, David. Wha--? One, two, three. Pigs are omnivores. Excuse me? Are you okay? David? David? Okay, come on. Come on. Come on, let's go inside. David? David, I brought you some clothes that I found in my-- In my father's closet that I thought might fit you. It's nice to get out of the city. Listen. Um... I think that... we just go in tomorrow like nothing happened. And... like everything is like it was. Bye, David. Everything will be fine. Yeah. Hey, G, it's, uh-- It's pretty early, man. I, uh-- I was just calling to see how you were doing. I, um-- Oh, I thought maybe later we could, uh-- We could grab some lunch. Anyway, all right, Garret, give me a call. Bye. Rebecca The apartment was not so much an apartment, as a monument to a good life and a better fortune. The owner was a man of stature, handsome, with an articulate wit. A bull among calves. An arrogant, ego-driven, misogynist bull that she would carefully lead to the slaughter. It could have all been so easily avoided. If he had only taken a moment, one moment, he would've seen the blueprint for his demise. David? You didn't maybe, possibly have a chance to look at the story I gave you, did you? Aw, shit. But I am gonna burn through a stack of reading as soon as I get home. Rebecca But she knew he wouldn't bother. Of course not. A man who basked in the reflected glow of those with real talent, getting rich off the blood and sweat and torment of those he represented. Surely he'd never take the time to read a story from an unknown writer. David? I have Andrew Dunlap for you. She chose a name at random and stamped it at the bottom of a title page. Why on earth would you put me on the phone with him? The actors weren't hard to find in a city full of starving artists. Hi. Hard to believe what they would do to show the extent of their talent. Soll? I'm coming to your place as soon as I'm done here. Poor bastards had no idea what they were getting themselves into. Hey-- Hey, Ellsworth, how are you? The irony of it was that it was all his idea really. She did exactly as he suggested. Call somebody at The New Yorker. I got some renewal thing. He's a writer. The one that you told to write a story about himself writing a story. Rebecca And that's exactly what she did. She wrote a story about herself writing a story. All that was left was to follow his own words. The advice she'd hear him scream countless times. Make. Me. - Make me care. - Care. Find what you need, sweetheart? Oh, yes, thank you. Renting a place across the street made it easy. She learned his every move. Predicted his every thought. David? Oh, my God! I can't hear you. I'm in a club. She knew there would be victims. Victims he could have easily saved. Victims of his own arrogance. And then... with a stranger's hand, she pushed him... right onto the killing floor. She would become his number one client. She'd call the shots from her cabin in Maine in her fucking bathrobe. What happened next was his choice. But live or die, they'd go together. It was comin' at a brotha I saw you with your man Smilin', Marc Jacobs bag in your hand Now I'm sittin' in the coupe with my hat turned back Hold up, let me stop playin' Uncle Al said that, uh Yeah, still I gotta say hey, lover Heaven knows I can't imagine you with another Head to toe, your whole body smooth like butter Let me know the deal keep it real with each other Real with each other I need you now Before the moon sails away I dream of you, your touch Secret things we used to do I wanna make love to you Faraway I'm here waiting for you Let's go, come on Take me home I wanna be alone with you Yeah, like that You are my life Don't leave me lonely tonight I want you deep inside of my soul You're the only one who knows Where I wanna run to Through the door in the shower, on the bed Rollin' on the floor power rushin' to my head Callin' out for more sweat runnin' down your legs Crawlin' on all fours I love it when you beg Bitin' your bottom lip soon as I get nearer I see you starin' at the man in the mirror You love the way it feels I can see it in your face Close your eyes, move your waist Faraway I'm here waiting for you Let's ride Take me home I wanna be alone with you Swing your hip, girl Ain't no better place that you could ever be Love flows steadily and passion is heavenly The first time your sweet voice said yes You was the best girl I'd ever undressed Never stress the rest 'cause the rest don't matter Did your body good, girl that ass gettin' fatter Yet you from the hood, girl but you don't chitter-chatter Damn, I got it good, girl and I ain't mad at her Cruise around town her cryin', leave it at home We both in the zone goin' all night long Makin' each other feel so right that it's wrong Girl, move your hips let 'em swing with the song -Faraway - Uh-huh I'm here waiting for you - Let's ride, come on - Take me home...
