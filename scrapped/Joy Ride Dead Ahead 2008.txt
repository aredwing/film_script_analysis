 

                        Will that be all for you? There you go. Have a good night. Where are you going? Come on. Party time, huh? Hey! Hey, wait up! Looking for company? It's pretty shitty out there, huh? Hoo. I like the rain. Keeps everybody inside... and washes everything clean. Yeah, sure. Whatever. So, anyway, it's 75 for a straight fuck... And 25 for a pump and run. Show me what you got. Where you haulin'? Heading home. - Lucky you. - The wig too. So we gonna get started here or what? Get it wet for me. - Are you kiddin'? - Do it. Now! You know what? Screw this. What the fuck! You want out? There's your exit. You're a fucking freak. Somebody help me! Oh, my God, Kaylal Oh, my God, look outl - Oh, my God! - - Oh, my God. - Oh! Why? Why? - Are you kidding? Not funny. - I don't wanna die. - - Oh, my God. I'm sorry, baby. She made me. Mel, I did not make you. That was totally your idea. That's the quality time you guys want to spend together? To kill me in my sleep? You should wait and see what we have in store for Vegas. - You know what I'm gonna do? - What? I'm gonna go into a dark corner, and I'm gonna gamble by myself... while you guys go do the whole bachelor/bachelorette thing. Don't be such a baby. We agreed to do the parties together... so everyone would have an equal opportunity to torture us. Hey, chill. Chill! I don't want you staining the fine Corinthian leather. What a waste of fine Corinthian. You dare mock the '83 Chevy Caprice wagon? Yes, I do. Question: Why did we not fly to Vegas? Because Kay and I haven't seen each other since Christmas... and I miss my little sister. I miss you too, Sis. Congratulations, Kay. - You've found a genuine ghost town. - Okay, is this place even open? - Fill her up, ma'am? - Sure. He's kind of cute. No? No. No. You know, ma'am, here at Inbred Jed's, we require that you pay in advance. - Really? - Really. - Uh- - Okay. What the- Uh- - Psych. - Okay. - - Hey, whoa. Hey, whoa! Hey, hey, hey. What the hell is going on? Nik, this is my sister, Mel, and her fiance, Bobby. You are way hotter in person. Wait a minute. Is this the guy you've been talking to on MySpace? 33, 628 friends and counting... and Kayla is number one. - You're my number one. - Okay. All right. What's happening? What's going on? Nik's gonna be my date in Vegas. - He took a bus all the way from Salt Lake City to meet me. - Okay. C-Could you please join me in the bathroom? Okay. - Are you kidding me? - Look, I know Brad's gonna be there tomorrow. And I haven't seen him since we broke up. I just wanted to show up with somebody. But you barely know this guy. I barely know you since you moved away to be with Bobby. Which one's yours again? I jest. I don't understand anything you said. You have two things right here. Nik and I have been talking on the phone every day for the past five months. - Yeah, online. - Online, on the phone, over webcam. He's not a serial killer. Trust me, I googled his name and everything. Do you need the change? - Come on. Come on. - There you go. Check this out. This road would be a lot faster. No traffic, no cops. Free at last. No hassle from the man. Look, I didn't tell you because I knew you'd try to talk me out of it. Yeah, exactly. Why do I always have to be the voice of reason with you? Come on, Sis. Please? Pretty please? I just want to have some fun. Fine, but you have to promise to feed him, water him... - and clean up after him. - I will, I promise. Uh, I'm not really a back roads type of guy, buddy. Uh, they built the highways for a reason. Stick to 'em. Yeah, to slow shit down, man. Think about it. The faster we get to Vegas, the faster we start cashing in... - the faster we start having fun. - Come on, Bobby. - Come on. - Let's go. We're going to Vegas! We've been driving over an hour and we haven't even seen the main highway yet. That's because we're running exactly parallel to it, sweetheart. It's simple physics. Relax. We're fine as long as we keep heading west. Oh, would you look at this. A dirt road. Yeah, this has to mean civilization is close, right? Or is this the main entrance to Vegas, Nik? 'Cause I don't know. I've never been. Quit busting my balls, man. It was your map. What the fuck is that smell? - Oh, no. - Oh, shit! - Pull the car over. - What's wrong with it? - Anywhere, pull over. Pull it over. - I am. Okay. Geez, just stop the car. Stop the car. - Thank you. - What are we gonna do? What is it? - The engine seized. - Did you ever think- Did you ever think maybe you should put some oil in there? I don't know about that stuff. She had a good run. Isn't this Grammy's car? - Yeah. - Well, I'll miss her. Aw, that's sad. I feel like we should bury it or something. Can you hear me? Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? No shit. Which way do you think? Well, we know nothing's down there for a hundred miles, so- I say we keep going down this way. - Straight to Vegas, right, Nik? - Right, Nik. - Right, Bobby. - Asshole. Okay, guys. - We're in hell. - At least that means we're not completely lost. You may want to surrender your Goth pride, Nik, and lose the black jacket. I'm not Goth, jock. Third-wave emo punk, if you insist on using labels. Well, it's first-wave jackass to wear black in the desert. - Tell that to the bedouins. - I will. Wait a minute. What's that? Sweet. What are we gonna do? Bust right in, or what? Looks like our luck's changing. See you're good for something, jock. Holy shit! This mail's over a month old. Anyone home? - Hello! - Hello! Hello! Anyone home? Hello. - - Still got nothing. Nik? Nik! - - Oh, my God. Oh, my God! What is it? What? Oh, I'm sorry. These are a bitch to open sometimes. - You think they'd fix that. - We just busted down a door and broke a window. What do you want to do next? Set this place on fire? Where are you going? This place is empty. Whoever lived here before hasn't lived here for a long time. Bobby? Bobby? - You scared the shit out of us. - I'm sorry, baby. Oh, gross. These expired, like, a year ago. Scooby snack? Like Scooby Doo? I thought you said therapy helped your sister's control issues. I told you that because I thought you'd never meet her. I don't see what the big deal is. I think it's kind of sexy. I'll show you sexy... later. Later, later, later. - Later, later, later. - Creepy. - All the phones are dead. - Everything's dead here. You know, this place has got to be one of those weekend retreat slash meth-lab combo deals... or something, because this is pathetic. - We should get out ofhere before sunset. - I think we should go. Check this out. Wow, talk about valley of death. Nice piece of real estate. You know what they say. Location, location, location. Bobby, don't go any closer. Don't worry. I'll protect you. - Let's get out of here. - You wanna check out the barn? Just what do you have in mind, mister? Oh, simply a wholesome appreciation of early Western rustic architecture. This place keeps getting more and more charming. Come on! - You're suck a jerk! - Asshole. You scared me. I'm down with the freaky, but- This is just pushing it. What is that? - Wow. - Our motherfucking salvation! A 1971 Chevy Chevelle hardtop. - It's an American classic. - Dibs! Oh, no wayl Breaker, breaker, this is Captain Winky looking for Pink Taco. - You out there, R. T. - Nobody uses C. BIs anymore. Truckers do. God is quite literally handing us this fine automobile. Who are we to deny him? You are not thinking about taking this car? What if the owners come back? We don't really know how long these people are gonna be gone. They could be on vacation. Or they could have died in a freak combine/thresher accident. Who knows? - I mean, come on. - Oh, listen to that purr. And it's full of gas. Hop in. Let's take this bitch for a ride. Nobody's stealing anybody's car. - - At most we're borrowing it. Exactly. We're gonna borrow it for a little joyride, which is guaranteed fun. - I mean, "joy" is built right into that sentence. - Well, that's grand theft auto. - And what's the alternative? - We can't really hang out in that creepy house. She's right, Mel. We can't be out in the desert at night. How about this? We take this car to the nearest town. In the morning we'll rent a car, return this one with cash inside for how much the damage is. - Right, Nik? - Yeah, uh-huh. Right. - Fine. - Yes! - I'm riding shotgun. - You can ride whatever you want. You got the keys? Don't worry. We'll stop by Kayla's car and get the bags. Everything's gonna be okay. Okay, but I'm leaving my number in case the owner comes back. Smart and sensible. Just like my baby. - Come on, Mell - Come on. Let's gol - - Let's gol Come on. Get in. All right. A II right. Thank you. Okay, so good news. There's a car rental place in Cedar City about an hour away. They're holding a car for us. Oh, good. I called Michelle to tell her we'd be late. But I told her we'd meet her in Vegas tonight. See, everybody? That wasn't such a bad little detour, was it? - Watch your head, Sis. - Oh. Thanks. See, this is a ride. '92 Harley Heritage Softail Classic. Fishtail carbs, Corbin seat, and a bitch pad. Wow, that's extremely butch of you, Melissa. No offense. All right, let me see if I know my fiancee. You dated a gearhead in high school. Gary Braddock. - I thought he was so hot. - He taught us both how to ride. I just think he wanted to hook up a threesome. And who could blame poor Gary Braddock for that? Don't worry. It never went anywhere. I just liked to ride his bike. - - What the- Fuck you, asshole! - Yeah, rage against the machine, motherfucker! - Son of a bitch! Fuck. I got me a bodacious case of beaver fever, that's for sure. Your old lady finds out, you'll be off the super slab for good. About my 18th hour straight. Oh, my God, is that Shakespeare we're hearing? Take it you kids are from out of town, on your way to Vegas? - Yeah. - Yeah. Five bucks says she's got two names, like Amy Sue, or PeggyJo, or- - Twenty and you're on, harelip. - Here you go. Best seats in the house. Thank you. Thank you. I'm Nik. I'm Jolene. That's one name, not two. Guess you lost, pumpkin. Well, Jolene, a round of specials, please... and my third-wave emo punk here is gonna get the check. Oh, that's just fantastic. I'm already paying the bill for the window, might as well pay for breakfast. Thank you.| Uh-oh. Looks like we brought chum to the shark tank. Oh, that's romantic. You're referring to us as piecemeal fish guts. Look around. We're surrounded by trucker trash. Just ignore 'em. They're not bothering us. - Okay? - Of course they're not. They know their place. After all, truckers are just gacked-out speed freaks whose only hope for companionship... is a disease-ridden hooker. Jesus, would you lower your voicel I bet you I can get one of these convoy wack jobs to flip their lid and storm out of here. Come on, gambler to gambler, give me a chance to win my money back. You want a bet? Here. Here's your bet. - I bet you you won't shut the hell up for five minutes. - Five minutes? Six. How about seven? Ten bucks? Twenty? I'm gonna go to the bathroom. You're not gonna cry, are you? Courtesy flush. We don't want this place smelling like a truck stop. Um, ten bucks if you guys make out. And another special. Oh, that's Bobby's. Right here. Thank you. So, you and Bobby can't stay apart long enough... to have separate bachelor/bachelorette parties? - That's pretty sad. - Combo parties are in right now... - especially when the couple has the same friends. - No, I'm not complaining. Trust me. I think it's pretty interesting. I've always wanted to know what goes on at a bachelorette bash. - Can I be the stripper? - You okay, Mel? Why is Bobby taking so long? Cupcake, when we're together four years... will you worry about me when I'm out of your sight for 15 minutes? Oh, I'll worry about you... cheating on me. No, no, no. Give me a little more credit than that. I plan on keeping my affairs completely discreet. - LikeJames Bond. - How nice of you. - Hello? - I believe you have something of mine. Shit. I think it's him. - Him who? - The car. The car guy? - Goldilocks? You there? - Uh- - Goldilocks? - Didn't you come into my place when I wasn't home... just like Goldilocks and the three bears. Uh, yes. We're really very sorry. We ran into an emergency, but we're bringing the car back and money for any damages. - That's why I left my number. - No rush. No rush. Wouldn't want you to worry one hair on that... pretty blonde head of yours. How did you know I was blonde? Lucky guess, Goldilocks. Yeah, a-a-anyway. Um, okay. Thank you for not going to the police. Oh, I'd never do that. I expect the same. I don't understand. Why would I go to the police? 'Cause now I got something of yours. Your boyfriend. Are they gonna have sex in the bathroom? Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby, where are you? Bobby, are you okay? He can't come to the phone right now. He's a little... busy. Why are you doing this? Only seems fair. I told you we were sorry about the car. We didn't think anybody was home! It's about more than just the car. Please don't hurt him. Aw, too late for that now. I'm begging you. You want to see him again? Alive? Of course! Then we got a long road ahead of us. There's just a couple of things I'm gonna need you to do for me. He wants to talk on some private station or something. - This is so fucked! - Totally fucked! - I mean, who is this freak? - Why would you leave your number? Are you a complete idiot? I didn't want anyone going to the police! Just leave her alone, all right? She was just being Mel. How do we know this guy's for real? How do we know he's not punking us like some sick joke? Hello? Hello? Is anybody out there? Hello? Is anybody there? Goldilocks? Yes. Yes, I'm here. Who are you? You can call me... Rusty Nail. Can I speak to Bobby? Please? L-| I need to know that he's okay. Oh, my God. Bobby! Bobby!| Okay. It's okay. You do what I asked? Yes. I got the cell phones. Line 'em up in front of the car. No way! I waited two days in line for this phone. Do it. Nowl - No. - Move! - How's he gonna know if you do it or not? - He's probably watching us. How do you know he's watching us? How do you know that? Okay. Start the car and drive forward. Don't do it, Melissal Don't do it, Melissa. - I have to. - If you do it now, he'll know he can do anything he wants. - - This is fucking insane! Don't do it! Fuck! Okay, it's done. You follow everything I say to the letter. You do that, I promise you'll all be reunited soon. Don't get no ideas of separatin' or goin' for help. Okay. We'll do whatever you want. Whatever you want. - Jesus. Make sure you tickle his balls while you're at it. - Shut up, Nik! What do you want? Remember when your girlfriend there threw her drink at my rig? That was him? He's one of them. He's a fucking trucker! She gave me something, right after that. Ring any bells? I don't understand. She gave me the finger. Now I want it. She gave it to me, I figure it's mine to keep. What? My finger? I'll let you know the place and the time. You just make sure it's freshly cut. And if you don't show up, well... things will not go well for your boy here. And, Goldilocks? Yes? I want you to bring it to me. It's time we met... in the flesh. I can't believe this is happening. I swear to God, we're gonna find him. - We can figure this out. How smart can this guy be? - He said he had eyes everywhere. That's impossible. I mean, he can use his C. B. to ask his fellow road zombies if they've seen this car. I mean, it's pretty unique. It's probably how they found us in the first place. And he almost definitely has a police scanner, so it means we can't go to the cops. - How do you know all this stuff? - Dad used to be a trucker. Let's just say, not a fan. - He could be in any one of them. - It doesn't make sense for him to follow us... until we meet him in... three hours, with Kayla's severed finger. We are not cutting off my sister's finger. My point is, is he's got to have something to do between now and then. Otherwise, he would've asked us for it right then and there, right? - Okay. - So, if he's not following us now... and we stay away from trucks and police, maybe we can find ourselves some time to maneuver. - He may be right. - Thank you. - What if he's wrong? - Hell, it's not my funeral. Hey, you know what? Why would you say something like that? - Sorry. - Just shut up! You know what? Maybe we should just get him what he wants. - I'm not going in there. - Nobody's asking you to. I'll go. You know I can handle blood. No. You know what? This is my fault. I gotta do this. - I need you to come with me. - For what? Wait. Go wait with Mel. Fuck. What's with the whole "okay with blood" thing? Forget about it, all right? No, seriously, you go to, like, med school, or just a lot of P. M. S. What part of"forget about it" is confusing you? Shit. Shit. - My God. Kayla. Kayla! - Oh, shit. Shit. Oh, God. Fuck, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. - - Thank God. - Did you get it? - Yeah. I got a scalpel, too, just in case. - Great. - Let's go. I'm in a fucking car with a fucking finger. - Come on! Get in! - It's fantastic, really. Oh, fuck! That's him! That's the guy. He wants his finger back! That's the guy. - He's coming for the fucking finger. - I don't have the keys. - I left them right here! I don't know where the keys are. - Let's go! - Come on, man! - You can't park here! Police escort vehicles only! How many times do I have tell you? Sorry. We're really sorry. We did- It'll never happen again. - Sir. - Yeah, sorry. Sorry, Mr. Lurch. I'm not-I'm not so sure about this. Relax. Everything's gonna be fine. Oh, great. Yeah, as long as we have the power of positive thinking on our side. I think this is it. Stall him as long as you can. Okay? You be careful, okay? Yeah. - - Okay, I'm here. Park about 50 feet away from me, nose to nose. What now? Get out of the car. Then come around the front... and strip for me. Down to your underwear. Gotta make sure you're not wearing a weapon and a wire, now don't I? - - Please don't make me do this. I'm not wearing anything. - I'm losing my patience. - Okay! Okay, okay. I'll- I'll do whatever you say. At my signal, come up to the cab... and give me what's mine. And then you'll let Bobby go? - - You do what I say... and I promise you'll see him again. Do it now. And, Goldilocks? Make it slow. I want to enjoy this. Now why don't you show me that pretty little ring of yours? - Oh, this is so messed up. - Just keep moving. I don't remember reading any of this shit on your user profile. - Are you serious? Just shut up! - I'm sorry. L-I get nervous, I tend to talk a lot. Whoo-wee! That is the finest striptease I ever did see! I'm gonna throw this up on YouTube, get me a million hits. - Who are you? - Whoever you want, sexy mama. Close them pretty eyes and pretend I'm Kenny Chesney for all I care. Oh, my God. You're not him? - Where's Bobby? - Bobby? What the high heck you talking about? All's I know is some road dawg came over the squawk, told me that I'd get quite a show... if I pulled over at this here chicken coop. And, missy, let me tell you, that did not disappoint one bit. - Bobby! - Bobby! Bobby! - Why are you doing this? - Goddamn it! Didn't warn me you was no psycho she-bitch. I'm out of here! Your titties are too small anywaysl I like them super mongo jugs. Yeah, you heard me. Circus boobs! - What was that? - Roll! I don't understand. I did everything you asked! No, you didn't. - I saw you down at the funeral parlor. - Mel, what is going on? There's a big difference between a freshly cut, live finger... and one snipped from a corpse. Less blood in that one you got there. Stiffer, paler. The nail's yellowed... no nutrients, deterioratin'. Want to see what a fresh one looks like? Check the glove compartment. Told you you'd see him again. I just didn't say which part ofhim. - - Your boy's losing a lot ofblood here. Maybe I should take care of that for him. No. No, no. No! What the fuck do you want? We're not finished, Goldilocks. Not by a long shot. Heck of a joyride, isn't it? Okay. So, uh, maybe- maybe now we should go to the cops. What are they gonna do? Put out an all-points bulletin? Set up roadblocks? Rull over every big rig in Utah? - That's a damn good start. - He's monitoring the police bands. - He'll know the second we try to get help. - No. No police. Absolutely not. - What the fuck do you want to do then? - Whatever he asks! Next time, for sure we do exactly what he asks, no matter what it is. This is so fucked up. You alive, boy? Don't do anything stupid. Sorry, hoss, but you got to be a member to enter a bar in Utah. All right. But be quick. Dick. # I don't have to change no more # # No, I can't # Help me! Help me! # Singin' my song to you ain't gonna pay my bills ## Help! Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about.| Help! What the fuck? Helpl What's going on in there? - Help me! - Holy fuck! Open the door! Hey, you hold on in there, buddy. I'll get you out of here. Damn thing, it won't openl - No! - I can't open the damn door! - - Oh, my God. Did you see the way his jaw dropped? You like taking chances, huh? Well, then I got a game for you. Rusty, can you hear me? Rusty, please talk to me. Rusty, please talk to me. - It's been over an hour. Maybe he's, um- - Well, maybe it's over. Maybe he's, you know, already dead. Shut up, Nik. So much cooler over the Internet. Yeah, so were you. Goldilocks? Y-Yes, Rusty. Rusty, I'm here. Look, I'm-I'm sorry... about what we did to you, deceiving you like that. It won't happen again. Just please- please let me talk to Bobby. I'm tired. Real tired. Been gone a long time. I was heading home, you know. Planning on staying off the road for a while. Hibernatin'. Like a bear, huh, Goldilocks? Rusty, please- please let me talk to Bobby. I love him more than... anything in the world. And we're getting married. Bobby, if you can hear me, I love you. I love you so much. I need you to get something for me. Anything you want. Some high-speed chicken feed. - I don't know what that is. - It's crank. It's trucker speak for crystal meth. What, now we're drug mules? Fuck! We're just gonna do whatever he says. Yeah. You know what? I'm just glad it doesn't involve a fucking body part! I think it's about time for y'all to take a walk on the wild side. Get in. #It's 2:00 in the morning My baby's in bed # Not exactly my scene, but I respect their right to peaceful assembly. - Go, go, go, go, go! - Or not so peaceful. All right, Rusty, we're here. What now? Check the trunk. Fuck if I'm doing it. What the hell? Did you get it, Goldilocks? What is this? Well, that's what the tattooed boy's gonna wear. Oh, no fucking way. I want him to walk through this party... Iookin'like a disease-ridden lot lizard. That's all us gacked-out, speed-freak truckers can get... so that's exactly what he's gonna do for me. Oh, my God. He was there. He heard everything. He was in the diner. He heard everything you said! - Way to go, Tattooboy2000! - Shut up! Take it easy, Finger Queen. You didn't exactly ingratiate yourself to him either! Shut up! You're a gambler, aren't you, boy? What's the odds you can stay out there long enough to bring me what I want? Zero! 'Cause it's not fucking happening! Want me to go out there dressed like a fucking tranny? They'll kill me. Not doing it. Oh, you're doing it. - I'm not doin' it. - Yes. You are. - Excuse me? - You're gonna go out there... and you're gonna do everything he asks to the letter... 'cause Bobby's life depends on it. - Fuck you. - Hey, know what, Nik? Fuck you too. Most of all, fuck himl Fuckl What the fuck are you doing, bitch? You are not going anywhere. I don't even know why I stayed around this long. I barely know you or your boyfriend. And, you, I'm sorry, but you're just not worth it. From now on, this is between you guys and Rusty Dickhole. Good night and good luck. You're not gonna have to worry about Rusty anymore, Nik... 'cause right now I'm your fucking problem. Mel? Mel. I am not gonna let you jeopardize Bobby's life. - Mel, I think you have to calm down. - Mel, give me the scalpel. I'm sorry. I will do whatever it takes to save him. 'Cause Bobby is worth it. I can't go out there dressed like a fucking tranny. I can't do that. They'll kill me. Please don't make me do this. I just want to go home. I just- Please. - You're not much of a tough guy now, huh? - Please. All tattooed and pierced. They're fake. Lookit. They're fucking fakel They're fakel You're a little fucking douche bag! Rlease. Rlease. Listen to me, Nik. We're going to make sure... that you pass as a girl. - Oh, that won't be a problem. - You're gonna go out there... you're gonna get some speed from some dirt ball too wasted to even know the difference... and everything's gonna run smoothly, okay? Okay. Goldilocks, you out there? You better not bail on us. 'Cause I'll call you out on it so damn fast. I said I'd fucking do it! Okay? How's my little hussy? We're just finishing some final touches. #Monkey-doin'woman Mr. Shy Guy's back in town # #Monkey-doin'woman Mr. Shy Guy's back in town # # Well, I'm a monkey-doin'man # We should follow him. No. We can't leave this car. He didn't say anything to us about staying put this time, right? I mean, this could be a trap. Hey! Come on over, sexy lady! Hey, you want some of this, huh? - Does any- - You want a real man behind you? - Does anybody have any meth? - You like it like that? Rusty's here, Mel. He is. A nd we have to try to find out who he is... what his truck looks like, where he might be keeping Bobby, something. He said that if we followed everything that he told us- He would reunite us. Which really only means... if we keep following his demands, we're all gonna end up dead. Does anybody have any crystal? Hey, sweet tits! I got what you're lookin' for. Maybe we can work somethin' out in trade, huh? I'm sorry. No- No, thanks. Why are you running away from me? Fuck. - Oh, shit! - You can't- - - Oh, my God! Shit! Oh, my God! Hey, little girl. Nik! Nik! No! Get back in the car! Back to the carl We gotta chase himl - That fuck head! - We can't follow him! He's gonna kill Bobby, and then he's gonna kill us! This is our one chance. - He's taunting us. - Kayla, please. Where did he go? I don't see him. Oh, my God! Go! Oh, my God! Fuck! What? I can't- Okay. I can't go any faster! Oh, my God! No! Mel. Mel, can you hear me? Mel? - - Oh, thank God. I'm gonna- I'm gonna get you out of here. I'll get you out of here. You have to wait until the last moment to jump, okay? What are you talking about? If you time it right, he won't be able to see you from this angle. You have to go. Oh, my God. Go. Go. Come on. Get up. Come on. That's good. Okay. I gotta get you out of here. Sis. Sis. My leg's pinned. I'm not going anywhere. - You have to go. - I'm not. - You have to go. - I'm not going. Promise me you'll finish this. I promise. What the fuck's going on? Where are we? Where it all started. Where I can take my time with you. Couple ofbig-time risk takers, huh? Pl-Pl-Please let us go. You like to gamble?
