 

                        Point for M. de Lesseps. Point 30. Bravo, that was wonderful. Eighth game and second set to Mr le Vicomte de Latour. Better keep your mind on the game. Mesdames et Messieurs Monsieur le Prsident de la Rpublique Look at that. He sits down on that throne as if he liked it. After all, Louis Napoleon is a Bonapart. Emperors seem to run in his family. As a staunch believer in the Republic, that's exactly why I'm worried. You better keep your mind on the game. Third and deciding set. Mr de Lesseps will serve. Who's that playing against de Latour? Ferdinand de Lesseps, Mr le Prsident. Son of our Consul-General to Egypt. Oh, yes, he's a fine officer, isn't he? One of our most promising young diplomats. Oh, that's wonderful. Du Brey... Who's that? Countess Eugenie de Montijo, from Madrid. She's very enthusiastic about the game. Especially when young de Lesseps is playing. The young man has a keen eye for other things than a tennis ball. See that Mr de Lesseps is invited to my next reception. Yes, Mr le Prsident. And, of course, Countess... what's her name, too. Yes, Mr le Prsident. Le Conte Hatzfeldt, Baron Dreissen. Mr Franz Lizst. Ah, Mr Lizst, I shall have the pleasure of asking you to play later this evening. It will be my honor, Mr le Prsident. Let me help. Ferdinand, you mustn't in front of all these people. It's your fault for looking so beautiful. If you don't stop I won't have any reputation left at all. Why, haven't you already shocked half Paris by riding astride? That was different. Oh, yes, I know you look very charming in breeches. Thank you. Oh, Ferdinand. There's a fortune teller. And before the year is out... you will be married for the fourth time. Good evening, Eugenie. Isn't it marvelous? My fourth marriage. I've only just lost my second husband. Louis, dear, your party is so different. Only you would think of having a fortune teller. I'm glad you're enjoying yourself, Duchess. Oh, you haven't been presented. Let me. The Countess Eugenie de Montijo, Mr le Prsident. Mr le Prsident. I had heard that the Countess de Montijo was one of the most beautiful women in Paris. Oh, really? For once the gossips didn't exaggerate. Thank you. And this is Mr de Lesseps. I have always had great respect for your father. I'm happy to meet his son. Mr le Prsident is very kind. May I have the pleasure of this waltz? Oh... why, yes, of course. Would you excuse us, please? Don't they make a handsome pair? Yes. Mr le Prsident. The British ambassador has just arrived. Oh, yes. Du Brey has no manners. He's always intruding. Will you forgive me? Of course, I understand. May I hope for another dance? With pleasure. Monsieur le Marquis. Ren, good evening, how are you? Good evening, Eugenie. Will the most beautiful woman not only in Paris but in the entire world honor me with this next dance? Let's have our fortunes told instead. He doesn't need his fortune told. No? He's already predicted a most brilliant future for himself. Oh, but what about my future? That's easy. You're going to share mine. We'll see what the swami has to say about that. Sahib, memsahib. We'd like one of your best fortunes for the young lady. One of your very best for us now, please. The sand falls slowly. I see difficulties. Yes, I see a troubled life. But a great one. You will live a hundred years and wear a crown. Ren, she really believes the fortune. Since you're being so generous, you can tell mine. The sand tells a strange story. You shall dig ditches. Ferdinand de Lesseps, the great diplomat. France expects ditches. Since you're laughing so hard, let's hear yours. If I knew Louis Napoleon's future, I'd know mine. That's a very interesting idea. We'd like you to tell us Louis Napoleon's future. Very good idea, Only if he himself is here. Well, let me try. Here, let me try. Abracadabra... I see a throne. An imperial throne. Who's this approaching? Why, it's Louis Napoleon. In one hand he carries the tri-color of the Republic. Where's that? Right there. He walks forward, looks at the throne... Looks at the tri-color. Puts it behind his back. Then he walks toward the throne. He starts up the stairs. That's hard going. He keeps tripping on the tri-color. Very amusing. May I... Ferdinand, this is our dance. Mr le Prsident. Don't you think I... No, no, you'd only make it worse. The young man is a wit. A pity to waste him on Paris where we have so many wits. Oh, that's nice. I designed it especially for mademoiselle. Oh, it's lovely. It is beautiful, mademoiselle. Ravissant. If mademoiselle will permit, I shall name ir Eugenie. That's very nice of you. Thank you. Monsieur. Don't you think it would be better if that were... down just that much? No, no, mademoiselle, no. Well, I guess I suppose you're right. Mr le Marquis du Brey is here, mademoiselle. Du Brey? Oh! Yes, of course, I'll see him at once. Bien, mademoiselle. Mr le Marquis. Mademoiselle. Pardon me for calling at this hour, but Mr. le Prsident desires an early answer. Would you please tell Mr le Prsident I should love to. Mademoiselle. Mr le Marquis. Au revoir, monsieur. Merci mil fois, mademoiselle. Mon plaisir. Thank you very much. The hat's a creation. Sorry. Sorry. Eugenie. Ferdinand. Eugenie, darling. I'm leaving for Egypt in an hour and forty-five minutes. Will you marry me? What? I'm going there as secretary of the Consulate. Marry me, come with me. Ren's gone for the license. What license, what are you talking about? The marriage license. Quick packing things. We've just time to get to the church. But I couldn't possibly do a thing like that. You know I couldn't. Darling, don't you understand? I may be gone a year, five years. This may be our last chance. Oh, Ferdinand, are you insane? No... Yes. Don't you see? It just isn't possible. Yes, I see. I've made an idiot of myself as usual. Asking you to change your whole life, marry a nobody and go to live in a desert. You're not a nobody. You never could be. Never. It's... it's just such a leap in the dark and I... Oh, darling, you must understand, you've got to, you do, don't you? Yes... I understand. Oh... I wish I could go with you. No... I won't ask you again. It wouldn't be fair. But please remember this... Whether I'm here or in Egypt no matter where I am I'll always love you. Goodbye, Eugenie. Goodbye. Well, here you are. I got it. You know, I had a terrible time... Oh... I'm sorry. Thanks, just the same. The new gown is ready, mademoiselle. Take it away. I don't want to see it. Take it away, mademoiselle? Yes, yes, Julie, please. Driver, stop. Hassan! Hassan! Hassan! Hassan! Oh, you bad donkey. Wait a minute... Oh, you dirty pig. Come back at once or I will cut your heart out. I beg your pardon? Oh... I was talking to Hassan. Hassan? Yes, my donkey. But you'll do. At your service, mademoiselle. Make him bring back my little house. My clothes are in it. Why don't you come out and get them yourself? Shame on you. My dear young lady, I don't mind seeing you in your bathing dress. Oh... Shame on you. It's none of your business. Go away. Good afternoon, mademoiselle. Oh, no! No, monsieur, please, no. I didn't mean it. Oh, please, monsieur. Make him bring back. Come on, Hassan. You mustn't keep the lady waiting. No, no, no! Don't you know anything about donkeys? Make believe you want to make him go forward. Forward? Hm-hm. Forward, Hassan. On to victory. Come on. That's right. That's the way, come on. Good! Now look the other way. Hey, hey, hey. I'll be dressed in a minute. What's your name? De Lesseps. Oh, you're the son. We've been expecting you. We? Yes. All the French people here. We heard you were very good-looking... And you are. What's your name? Marie Antoinette Germaine Fernande Franoise I'm very happy to know you, Mademoiselle Prrrr. Occupation? Young lady. Young lady of leisure, eh? Married? No, but I could have been. Many times. Everybody wants to marry me. Are you married? No. Good. I'm glad somebody's happy about it. Well, now help me down. We got wet, didn't we? Yes. His Excellency is in the garden, efendi. This way, efendi. Ah, here we are. How are you, sir? My boy. I'd have come to meet you myself but... I had some business with the Viceroy that couldn't wait. What's happened to you? I had a slight adventure. Let me present my son. Sir Malcolm Cameron. Her Britanic Majesty's Consul General. Don't get up, sir. How are you? I hope you'll pardon my appearance but I seem to have fallen into the Mediterranean. Don't tell me that Louis Napoleon is so pressed for money that he makes his diplomats swim to their posts. No, but we Frenchmen must do our swimming in the Mediterranean while we still have the chance. Hm? Before it becomes a British pond. Young man, you'll be here watching. Well, here's to a long stay. And a successful one. Well, a successful one anyway. Thank you. Well, I must be off. Thanks for the drink, Mathieu. I'll see you at the Viceroy's reception tonight. It's been a pleasure to meet you, young man. Thank you, Sir Malcolm. So that's Sir Malcolm Cameron, eh? Yes, do you know about him? Only what everyone in the Foreign Office knows. That when England sets him to watch the kettle it means something important is brewing. Right you are. We must do our best to upset it. Come, get out of these rags before you take cold. A diplomat with a sore throat is about as useful as a fiddle without strings. Elle a de nouveau le costume de bain. Toni! Toni! Where are you? Where have you been? Running off without telling me. Bad disciplice gives the army a bad name. Yes, grandfather. Don't grandfather me. I'm ranking sargeant of the Consulate detail and I expect obedience. Yes, Sargeant. Look at this. Gray as a goose. I spend all afternoon hunting for the hair dye. I hid it, grandfather. I was afraid one of the men might see it. Alors, bien, get it! It's terrible. What must the army think of us? Where have you been? Swimming with Mr de Lesseps. What? No, no, grandfather. His son, the young one. Hm? Oh, he's so funny. So polite. I think I'll fall in love with him. What? The Consul General's son? I forbid it, you understand? This is an order. Yes, grandfather. Yes, who? Yes, Sargeant. Enchant. Ah, Sir Malcolm. Delighted to see you. Your Highness, another evening to charm the memory and ruin the figure. Mathieu. Malcolm. How are you? Alla wa Salaam ya sahibi. Allah wa Salam ya kedive. The presence of my good friend honors my house. It is my great pleasure, Your Highness, to present my son. It is my great pleasure to welcome to my court another of your illustrious family. Thank you. Who is that? That is Prince Said, the next Viceroy of Egypt. And your first assignment. What am I supposed to do with him? Cultivate him. Make a friend of him. So, here you are. Trying to catch a glimpse of the young gentleman, eh? Come now. Get along with you. Do your marketing. Yes, grandfather. What? Yes, Sargeant. His Highness, Prince Said, is calling to see Mr Ferdinand de Lesseps. I'll tell him. No, don't go, grandfather. I'll tell him. Mr de Lesseps, please. He's in his office. You mustn't go in. He's very busy. Oh, who cares. I'm sorry, but he doesn't wish to be disturbed. Very well. Mademoiselle. Please, don't go in... Hello. Hello, yourself. What are you doing here? I just dropped in. So I see. Look here, Toni. I'm very busy. Who is she? A friend of mine. I suppose you are in love with her. She doesn't look like much. Now look here, Toni, I've got a lot of very dull work to do and my mind isn't on it. And it's hot. I wish to heaven I were back in Paris and the flies are driving me mad and now you have to come in and make matters worse. All right. I just came to tell you that he's here. Who? You know. The Prince. Said? You mean to say that you've left him waiting out... I only wanted to talk to you. You're not angry with me? I ought to take you over my knee and spank you. Oh, why don't you? These men coming from Paris are so edgy. Good afternoon, Mathieu. Good afternoon, Malcolm. I was hoping you'd join me. Thank you. What are you doing? Brushing up on your tricks? Maybe I'll need them, now that I have two of you to fight. Only one, I'm sorry to say. I'm going back to Paris. Paris? Yes, I've just had a letter from Victor Hugo. Things look pretty bad. I shall miss you, Mathieu. There's no fun bowling at an empty wicket, you know. Don't be too sure about that. I'm leaving my son in charge here. Poor lad, eh? Yes, haven't told him yet. Poor fellow, I'm afraid it will be a blow to him. What's that? En garde. Right. A simple. En garde. One. Two. Three. Four. Parry quatre. Move your arm a little more to the left for parry quatre. Ready? Good boy, Your Highness. I get rid of the old fox and he leaves me with the young one. Wait. Here we go. Up we go. Please, could I rest in my father's carriage for a few hours? Of course, if you must. But remember, you promised to ride all the way to Suez. Oh, all right. I will ride. Good boy, Said. (In Arabic) Good morning, grandfather. What? Good morning, Sargeant. Toni, you had your orders to stay in Alexandria. Yes, I know. But I was worried about you. About me? What do you mean? Look. See? Gray as a goose. Shhh. If I don't fix it, they'll be calling you old man Pellerin. You ready, Said? My friend... I cannot ride with you today. This morning the boxing, yesterday eight hours in the saddle. All right. You've earned a day on your back. Ah, thank you. There. I don't like this. This camp is no place for a young woman. I'll take you home tomorrow. This is no discipline. Hey, where are you going? Hello. Well, what are you doing here? I followed you all the way from Alexandria. Are you glad I came? Oh, look. Let's race the storm to the ruins. See? Now we can both keep warm. Maybe it could rain for hours. No, it's just a squall. It'll be over in a few minutes. I can ride better than she can. She, who? That girl in the picture. Yes, you do ride very well. That's from being in the army. And she isn't as pretty as I am. Is she? Well, she's considered the most beautiful woman in Europe. She is not. You think so because you are in love with her. Oh, I hate her. For heaven's sake, come on, Toni, sit up. Sit up. I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. It always happens. What do you mean. When a woman falls in love with a man. Listen to me. You mind if I give you a little friendly advice? No. Forget about this falling-in-love business. But I don't want to forget it. Don't you like me? Come on. The storm's passed. Look, a rainbow. Grandfather says there is a pot of gold at the end. One in the Mediterranean and the other in the Red Sea. What a pot of gold for the world if they could be joined, the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. Look, Toni. Water in the old gulf. Just as it was centuries ago when the Phoenicians sailed through. Can you imagine ships sailing right through here where we're standing? Ships? Yes. Not ancient galleys, modern ships. Steamers sailing a short trade route to the East. It could be done. No elevations, no rock formations. Just a simple sand d... ditch. And I was told I was going to dig ditches. There's fate in this, Toni. Something sent me here to Egypt when I didn't want to come... kept me here when I wanted to leave. I thought it was a dead end. It has been up to now. But I could make this... I could make this spot that we're standing on the crossroads of the Earth. Why, think of it, Toni. A canal stretching through from the Mediterranean. Open to the ships of all nations. It could be done. And I can do it. I was looking for a way to serve France. And I think... I think I found a way to serve the world. My plan is to form a stock company in Paris. To finance the construction of the canal. But before I can go ahead, I must have Your Highness' assurance that Egypt will lease to us the necessary strip of territory. I regret that I cannot give you that assurance. What can Your Highness lose? We take all the risk. You are young, my friend. The wisdom of age will teach you the folly of tampering with the work of Allah. What man can accomplish is also the work of Allah. Since we are his creatures, obeying his wishes. Unfortunately one must also consider the wishes of the Turkish government. Does this objection come from Constantinople? Or from London? From London. Do you mean your government would oppose the construction of the canal? I do. But why? Can't they see that England would be the first to benefit by a canal through the isthmus? Think how it would shorten the sailing time to India. To England's possessions in the East. No doubt. But my government wants no short pathway to the East. There's always Napoleon sitting on the gate. But it's absurd to think that any one nation would dominate the canal. It would be open to the world. Your Highness, if you allow these selfish political considerations to sway you, Egypt, not France, will be the greater loser. I'm sorry. I'd like to help you. But my hands are tied. How did you get in here? I'm your secretary. Since when? From now on. Look, Toni, can't you find some place else to play? I'm not in a very good humor. Good humor or bad humor, you must have a secretary to help you. Well, you can take those books on the trade routes of the ancient Phoenicians back to the library. Which books? The trade routes of the ancient Phoenicians. What's the matter, can't you read? Didn't you go to school? Oh, yes. For how long? About two days. It was so dull, I ran away. His Highness Prince Said. I'm sorry, my friend. If I were the Viceroy... Thanks. Thanks, Said. Toni, does this sun out here in Egypt ever do strange things to people? Sometimes it makes them see things. That explains it. I must've been having hallucinations. Delusions of grandeur thinking that I could change the map of the world. Who knoes, my friend? Inch'Allah. And I thought I was going to Paris with you to be your secretary. Secretary and you can't even read? I could go to school in Paris. In a few days I learn to read. And then I could be your secretary. We won't have to worry about that now. Because we won't be going to Paris. His Highness the Viceroy. This is a great honor, Your Highness. Won't you come in. I've been thinking about your project, monsieur. And the advantages it would bring to Egypt. Yes, Your Highness? As you know, I cannot officially give you permission to proceed. But I owe you much. I repeat. I cannot officially give you permission, but if you wish to go ahead with your preparations you have my personal promise that when the time comes my son and I will do our utmost to find a way to help you. May Allah bless you, my boy. What did I tell you, huh? Pellerin. Yes, sir. Sargeant, you have your orders. Take Toni to the boarding school, then report to my father's office. Yes, sir. I don't suppose I could start school tomorrow? You start today. But you will come to see me. Of course I will. No, no, I won't leave you. Take me with you. No, Toni, no. Sargeant, don't just stand there, do something. Attention, Toni, what's all this? Thank you. You better take her away before she causes a riot. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Ren, good to see you. You know, that's just Toni. She's the old Sargeant's granddaughter and a perpetual nuisance. Oh, no, no! Come here. What are you doing? In a way, that little Toni was the inspiration for the greatest project ever concieved by the mind of man. I suppose I'm in for one of your orations. Eugenie. Did you give her my message? Well, no. You see... I couldn't. The dispatch was rather late in arriving and... when I called on her she was out. Oh. Fire away, my friend. I'm all ears for news of this canal of yours. Good heavens! All I need to start operations is the necessary money. I see. And how do you expect to raise it? Simple. The Bank of France will float a loan to raise part of it and the rest will be raised by the sale of shares to the public. In fact, you will be one of the first buyers. Who me? Oh, no. I'm just a poor politician. I've been told there's no such thing as a poor politician. Well, it's the first time in my life that I've ever known a fortune teller to be right. And you would try and dig the biggest ditch in all history. It's been kept out of the papers. I was hoping you already knew. Yes, I'm afraid Eugenie also takes her fortune tellers seriously. Yes... He said she'd wear a crown. Remarkable fellow, that fortune teller. The waters of the Red Sea are 30 feet higher than those of the Mediterranean. If a canal were cut across the isthmus it would cause the waters of the Red Sea to flow into the Mediterranean flooding every port in Southern Europe. That is the opinion of my engineering experts. But that's absurd. Any schoolboy knows that open seas the world over seek the same level. Are you an engineer? No. But I claim enough elementary physics and common sense to know that the Red Sea couldn't flood the Mediterranean. I'm afraid you've allowed your enthusiasm to flood your sense of discretion. I'm sorry. I must accept the verdict of my engineers. I'm inclined to agree with our excitable young friend. But we have more important things before us. Why haven't you been to see me? Would I have been welcome? But of course. Old friends are always welcome. Then you do consider me a friend. I've been worried about you. Wondering what you thought. I wanted to explain... Is it necessary for old friends to explain? Do come soon. I want to hear about all you did in Egypt and the canal, what progress you're making with it. Why don't you ask your friend Louis Napoleon about that? I'm sorry. Eugenie. I'll come soon. Contesse. Yes. Yes, I... Eugenie, Eugenie... Eugenie. Yes, yes, what is it? You have to dress quickly. What is it? Is something wrong? I'm afraid so. Rioting has broken out all over the city. Rioting? Yes. The Marquis du Brey is waiting. Louis Napoleon wants you at the palace immediately. Yes, of course, I'll come at once. Hurry. Victor, I think you know everybody. Oh, this is my son. Mr Victor Hugo. Messieurs, it's 1848 all over again. Violence breaking out all over the city. I repeat, messieurs. Our duty, as members of the Assembly, is to stand fast. It is my firm belief that Louis Napoleon is deliberately provoking all this disorder to give him an excuse for demanding the adjournment of the Assembly. Don't let's forget that Napoleon's argument all along has been that the Assembly's refusing to adjourn is responsible for this rioting. You will excuse me, messieurs, I have work to do. The poor boy has had a cruel disappointment. I hope he doesn't take it too hard. The Contesse de Montijo is here, monsieur. I had to come. I need your help. My help? Yes. Louis feels you can break this terrible deadlock in the Assembly. Oh, I see. I'm sorry, Eugenie. If there's a crisis, Napoleon has only himself to blame. Oh, but it's all so ridiculous. Louis doesn't want the throne. All he wants is a strong, orderly government. What do you think those people out there are shouting for? Monsieur Bonapart the President, or Louis Napoleon the Emperor? Ferdinand, he's not responsible for every crackpot in Paris. Please listen to me. I know you dislike him and I don't blame you. My dislike is political, not personal. We must forget even our political differences now. Ferdinand, come here. Look at that. It's going on all over France. Riots, bloodshed. There may even be a civil war. Don't you see? It's for the good of France. That's all Louis is thinking of, believe me. But I wouldn't know what to do even if I wanted to help. I have no political influence. But your father has. Convince him that the Assembly should adjourn. Then, when order has been restored, Louis promises to reconvene it without taking away any of its power. My father wouldn't hear of it. I know how he feels about Napoleon. He doesn't trust him. Even with his written promise that he means what he says? And if even with this you feel you can't trust him you know you can trust me. Messieurs. Your attention, please. I bring you an offer of compromise direct from Napoleon. And what is his offer? First he asks that the Assembly adjourn at once. Impossible. But... he gives his solemn promise to reconvene it as soon as the rioting has been stopped. But don't you realize what he's asking? That we throw away our one weapon our strength of numbers. He'd never dare invade the Assembly to arrest us. But separated, disbanded, we'd be helpless. An easy prey. At the mercy of any charge he might trump up against us. But Mr de Lesseps... His promise, he's given his word. Word of a Bonapart. The Bonaparts, whatever their ambitions, have always been men of honor. Have we the right to gamble our liberties on the promise of one man? And on the scratch of a pen to hold him to it? On the contrary, sir. Father, there's so much at stake. The peace of France. Maybe the future of all of us. When I was coming here just now I saw rioting bloodshed in the streets. Frenchmen lifting their hands against each other. No one questions your patriotism, sir. But I love France too. And believe me, you can best serve your country and liberty by doing what Napoleon asks. Well, messieurs, what do you say? I think we should bring this before the Assembly at once. And suppose they refuse to listen to us? They'll listen to you, sir. L'Assemble est ajourne. L'Assemble est ajourne. The Assembly is adjourned. I expect you to have every important member of the opposition behind bars before morning. Except, of course, young Mr de Lesseps. He will find that his Emperor is great. Gentlemen, you have your instructions. Louis, you promised me. You told me I could promise him. What have you made me do? Something for France that I couldn't do myself. But they'll blame him. They'll call him a traitor. I'm sorry, of course. But it will be only a temporary unpleasantness. And he shall have his reward. I intend to give his canal project my full support. Oh, no, Louis, you don't understand. His family and his honor, they mean so much to him. In a crisis, the individual is unimportant. The State is everything. The State. France, floundering in the phallacy of democracy. its industry idle, its army weak, crippled by the poisonous doctrines of the Republicans and the Socialists, has called me to save it from anarchy and ruin. I had to act swiftly, ruthlessly, but act. If I have used young de Lesseps badly it was for a great end. You have used me too, Louis. What can I possibly say to him? What will he think? The opinion of one man should be a matter of little concern to the future Empress of France. I'm sorry, Vicomte, you're under arrest. Arrest? By whose order? By order of the Emperor. Emperor? Why, in the face of this? Oh, thank you, Vicomte. I've been looking for that. But look here, Du Brey, Napoleon promised me that... Have no fear, de Lesseps. Napoleon keeps his promises. He's most grateful. Grateful? I don't know what he's talking about. So, that's what it was. I see. Your canal. Look here, Ren. You don't believe that I... Lackey, I'm ready. Ren! Ren. Ren. Ren. Your father will be proud of you for this. Where's my father? In his room, monsieur. Sir Malcolm. A stroke, monsieur. Sir Malcolm. Sir Malcolm... you were my father's best friend. You must believe me. Because I was his friend, I will spare you my opinion of yourself. A high price to pay... for a ditch. Toni. Where are you going? Shhh. But, no, no, mademoiselle. Mr de Lesseps cannot be disturbed at this hour of the night. Especially after what has happened. Perhaps tomorrow. But mademoiselle, mademoiselle... Oh, dear, I'm so sorry. At least he died thinking it was a dream. You mustn't. Sit down. It's late. Try to sleep. Sleep. I will tell monsieur that you are here, mademoiselle. Yes, thank you. Monsieur. He won't see you. But he must. It's terribly important. No. I won't let you. But why? Who are you? His friend. The only one he has left. How could you do this to him? First you break his heart, then you make everybody hate him. What kind of a woman are you? Get out. Go away and keep away from him Toni. Ferdinand, don't listen to her. No, no. I didn't know. I swear I didn't. Louis promised me and then he broke his promise. You do believe me, don't you? Yes, I believe you, if it makes any difference. It does, of course it does. You see... I... I have a message for you. He wants to make amends. Amends? Can he bring my father back to life? Will he tell Paris the truth and clear our name? He can't. You see, it might... It might show the savior of France in a rather bad light. Now, will you go? Please. Ferdinand, there's one thing we can do. There's nothing anyone can do. Have you forgotten your dream? The canal? What about it? Louis has promised me to withdraw his objections. He'll do anything you want. And suppose I accept. Then everyone in Paris will be convinced that what they're already whispering is true. That I sold my party, my friends... and my father's life for a ditch. Tomorrow they'll hear the truth if I have to spend the rest of my life in prison. What do you care what they think or what they say as long as you know you did nothing dishonorable. I never want to hear of that ditch again as long as I live. You're very fond of him, aren't you? Well, so am I. And perhaps I know him a little bit better than you. He's a dreamer, a creator. He was put on earth to do great things. This mustn't stop. He owes it to the world and to himself to go through with his plans. Oh, my dear... He believes in you. Don't let him give up. You must make him realize that he's got to go on whatever the cost. He never will. He's beaten. No, no, you're wrong. There's something in him that'll never let him stop. It's a fire a greatness that isn't in you or me. Oh, keep that lighted. You can do it. You've got to do it. Look. The riot is all over. Isn't it a beautiful morning? What can you do? If you try to make people believe you it means prison. To be in prison these days is a guarantee of honor. Don't you understand? I can't go on forever having people think I'm a traitor, a Judas. I know you're not. And you didn't have to tell me. You're a stubborn little imp, aren't you? It's because I believe in you. This has just arrived by special messenger, sir. It looks most important. I'll read it for you. I can read very well now. Te-le... Telegram. Telegram. Oh, yes, telegram. From His Highness... Said Pacha. It's your friend. Go on. Vice... viceroy. Muhammad Ali is dead. Said is Viceroy of Egypt. Really? He wants to know when I'm coming to start work on the canal. You can begin at once. There is nothing to stop you now. No. There's nothing to stop me now. But I can't do it. So you can do it. I thought you were going to do this wonderful thing for the world as you said. And the old Viceroy trusted you. And Said trusted you. But you don't care anything about them any more. Only about your honor and what people say. I know you are honorable. But I want you to be more than that. I want you to be great. And when the day comes I want to stand beside you and see the ships go through the canal and know you built it for all the people in the world. Our line runs a little East of Sour till we reach the Ballah Lakes. Soft sand most of the way. Send word to Port Said that we start digging tomorrow morning. Mr de Lesseps, we just had news that the Viceroy is shipping 20.000 labourers from Alexandria. Splendid. My compliments to Captain le Duc. And see that housing is prepared for the men immediately. Yes, sir. Mr de Lesseps... I've just heard that our last consignment of blasting powder from Port Said was captured by Arab raiders. Arabs. Have we enough to carry on? For a little while, sir. Order another ship from Marseilles. Yes, sir. We'll deal with the Arabs when the Viceroy arrives. This Arab is no Arab. He is a Turkish soldier. Turkish? But the Sultan promised us he wouldn't intefere. No, not openly. But there are ways of interfering. When there is trouble, you can count on me, my friend. It is good to see my people happy. You have done much for them. Much more than giving them work, you have given them hope. They know your canal will bring new life to Egypt. They have their ruler to thank for that too. Letter from Paris, sir. It's from Toni. You remember her, Your Highness. Ah, yes, the little one. She's been studying her lessons. Look how her handwriting's improved. Don't go, Sargeant. You'll want to hear what's in here too. Yes, sir. I miss you very much. I hope you miss me too. The Emperor and Eugenie were... married last week. All we girls from the the school went and stood outside the church. She loked very beautiful and the crowd cheered. I cheered too. I was so glad she was married. Give my love to your... She sends Your Highness her love. Oh, thank you. Tell grandfather that I am sending him a bottle of his... hair tonic, Sargeant. They've pardoned all the political prisoners to celebrate their wedding. including your friend Latour. So I celebrated too. I ran away from school and... now I'm his secretary. That little rascal. He writes things against the Emperor and we have them printed secretly. I will send for her at once, sir. No. There's no place for her here... She's in good hands with Ren. First thing he knows she'll be writing his pamphlets for him. She's very fierce, the little one, eh? Yes. Takes after her grandmother. The Emperor abandons the Suez Canal! The Emperor abandons the Suez Canal! The Emperor abandons the Suez Canal! Who is it? Toni. I thought it might be the police again. Do you know what this means? Yes... I was afraid this would happen. But what does it mean? It means Louis Napoleon expects trouble with Prussia over Alsace and Lorraine. And Bismarck evidently intends to have them even if it means war. You see, my dear, France needs England's friendship And England will not stand for the Canal. But it's Ferdinand's. He's building the Canal. Even Napoleon cannot stop him. You forget that he's an emperor. With one stroke of the pen he can cut off every sou of the Canal's financial backing. But he's been working all this time. They must let him finish it. They cannot do this. I won't let them. I'm afraid there's very little that you or I or anyone else can do when Prussia rattles the saber. Your Majesty. The Suez Canal is far too important to France and to the world to be used as just a political pawn. I urge upon you most earnestly to reconsider your action. And let me finish this great project. And embark upon a war with Prussia without the support or at least the neutrality of England? Why is there any need for war if Your Majesty sincerely desires peace? Peace without honor? Can I disregard my destiny? The motto of the Bonaparts is still Glory for France. Your Majesty, the officials have arrived. I'm sorry, I can give you no more time. Gentlemen. You see? Week after week to watch ambition undermine him, destroy his balance and his judgment. He wants war, glory. That's all he thinks of now. Now I know where it will end. Finish the Empire. What will you do if he... If he loses? And the Empire falls? Why, stay with him, of course. He'll need me then. You see, Ferdinand, once I made a choice. Maybe it was a mistake but... it was my choice. And you've made my problem yours. And failed you. Yes, Ferdinand, I failed. But you won't. You'll win. Not through Louis' help or mine... but through your on efforts. I don't know how, but... somehow you'll do it. Do you have so much faith in me? Why, I've never lost it. And I never will. Goodbye, Ferdinand. Toni. Always when I need you. I almost didn't know you. Is that a compliment? You're lovely. That's the first time you ever told me. Oh, I brought a friend of yours. Ren. So you see... I've found my niches of pamphleteer for democracy. True, I haven't as great a reading public as Rousseau had, but I manage. And Toni here has been a tremendous help. Except with the spelling. You know, she edits everything I write. If I didn't, you'd go back to prison. But from now on... we're going to be together the three of us, hm? Where you go, we'll go. I'm leaving for England tomorrow. England? Well, don't you think first a long rest... Rest? You are going to stay right here and let Ren and me take care of you. The only thing that stands in my way now is the English government. My one chance is to go there before it's too late. Explain it to them. Break down their opposition. I must go there at once and try to see the Prime Minister. I'm sorry, Mr de Lesseps. I cannot support a project that is clearly opposed to the best interests of England. But I assure you it will be of the greatest benefit to England. Many of your own countrymen are convinced of this. Men of vision who can see beyond mere national boundaries. I disagree with you, sir, completely. In fact, at this very time, we are debating in Parliament this insane policy of reckless expansion for England. Englishmen should keep their eyes on their own boundaries not gaze moonstruck on foreign shores and fly-by-night foreign schemes like yours. I'm sorry, Mr de Lesseps. I bid you good afternoon, sir. The conduct of our colonial policy has been criticized by those who have placed the welfare and safety of our colonies above the welfare and safety of England They would risk their heads to save their limbs. Our first duty is to the mother country. England. I would not trade the meanest English county for all our colonial possessions. The path of headlong expansion is the path to disaster. Mr Speaker, sir. You have just heard the Prime Minister most ably and eloquently urge your support of the government's colonial policy. To his noble bellow I wish to add my own small voice. The Prime Minister has not always enjoyed my support, no. In fact, there have been times when I've been forced to to take issue with him. Who is that? It's the leader of opposition. Mr Disraeli. But now, strangely enough, I find myself pleading his cause. What's he up to? Some trickery, I wager. By all means support this policy. By all means rally round the Prime Minister. By all means follow cheerfully and unquestioningly his leadership. All of you. Who are as anxious as he to see England reduced to the standing of a third-rate power. Mr Disraeli's carriage. Mr Disraeli, I must speak to you. It's very important. And who are you? Ferdinand de Lesseps. Pray get in. The greatest danger is in delay. I had a message this morning from Said Pacha, the Viceroy. The desert works fast. Unless we can get our dredges going within the next few months all the years of work, all the millions we've spent wil be a total loss to us. To say nothing of a far greater loss to the world. And why have you come to me? Because England needs the Suez Canal. Because soon you're going to have a general election but above all, because you represent progressive and intelligent English opinion. And think what my enemies will say. Dizzy, the internationalist. Dizzy, the poseur. Dizzy, the foreigner, as they say... conspiring with a Frenchman in some evil-smelling foreign plot to undermine British institutions. Then you will do it. Of course I'll do it. You've brought me a whiff of hope, monsieur. Frankly my party's been the underdog in this election. We haven't expected to get a majority in the House. But I feel you've given me an issue here which dramatizes my whole stand. Strikes at the very heart of the government's do-nothing, thumb-twiddling policy. They see an England that stretches only from Land's End to John o'Groats, from Wales to Norfolk A tiny island off the coast of France. I see an England flung around the globe. And you, a Frenchman, are doing the work England should be doing to help create this greater England. Monsieur, if you're willing to take a sporting chance go back to Egypt keep up your work, at least try and save what you've already done. Raise the money somehow. I give you my solemn promise that if my party is returned at this election I'll do everything in my power to place England on your side. Come, let's have some supper. Four million piastras, Your Highness. Your Highness, isn't this the Kompor ruby? Yes. It was given my father by the Sultan for defeating the Wahabi in the Arabian Campaign. But isn't it enough for you to empty your treasury? I know how much these heirlooms mean to you. I wish you wouldn't, Said. Oh, no, my friend. Have you forgotten that sand is filling the Canal? The banks falling in? Machinery rusting? See... This is but a stone. Yet, with it, I can buy a great future for my country. Your bids have been dear. thirty-two... thirty-three... Crapeau! Four games in a row. You're too easy. You're too good. Ren. Hm? Come take my place. Give her a good beating. With pleasure. There is something on your mind? Yes. We can't hold out much longer. Even this way. Not making any actual progress but just keeping what we've already got. Fighting back the desert. And I don't whether I could even have done that without my guide, philosopher and friend. Have I been a good secretary? You've been a good angel. But I've been worried about you, Toni. Hm? Yes. I've been so selfish, letting you come down here... Oh, but I wanted to. Yes, I know. But you should be thinking about your own life. Your future. Your best years are before you. Marriage, children... All the things that belong to a happy, normal life. Not tying yourself down to a lunatic with a visionary idea. Toni... Toni... It's all right. Maybe I'd rather lunatic with you. even if you don't want me in any other way. Toni, listen to me. You have enough troubles without me being one too. Let's forget about it, hm? It's quiet, isn't it? Unnaturally quiet. As though the whole world were standing still. Listening, waiting for something to happen. Look. Ibises from the Nile. I don't believe I've ever seen them so far from home. I have. Years ago in Alexandria. The year of the Devil Wind. Listen. What's the matter with you? Those were only the jackals. Come on. What's that? Ren, go cut the animals loose. It's our best chance. Sargeant, go down to the encampment and get the men out. Get ropes, brace the dredges, everything. Yes, sir. Come on, Toni. We'll get the women to a place that's safe. Get the women out and place them into the food cellars. Get the men away from the tanks. Come with me. Toni. Toni. Toni. We found her. It was in the line of duty, sir. (In Arabic) Have you any orders for the men? No. Just tell them to go home. The work's finished. I thought I was doing such a great thing for the world. And what have I done? Destroyed everything I've touched. Now Toni's gone. For what? For what? Failure. The old Viceroy was right. If God had wanted a path through the isthmus He would have put one there. Goodbye, Toni. Westminster and the City are with us. The rest will follow. We've had reports from everywhere but the Midlands, Mr Disraeli. You cannot see poor towns easily But I'm afraid when the returns from Nottingham and Birmingham come in... Yes, I'm afraid you're right. Apparently... the present government have temporarily averted the danger of England taking over the leadreship of the world. It's no use crying. There will be other elections. I'm sorry for that poor Frenchman. I hear he's bankrupted himself. As well as the Viceroy of Egypt. Counting on us to win. Send Peterson to me, will you? I want him to send a telegram. Yes, Mr Disraeli. Come in. Lord Bainsford, sir. Good evening. Mr Disraeli, I have the honor to inform you that Her Majesty the Queen extends her congratulations on your party's victory in the election. May I add my own congratulations, sir? Thank you, Lord Bainsford. Would you inform Her Majesty that the first thing I shall do is to put her into business as senior partner in the firm of Victoria, de Lesseps & Company. We are building a shorter route to Her Majesty's Eastern Empire. A distinguished service to France and to the world. You've won. Yes, I've won and lost everything I'd learned to hold dear. Perhaps that's the price one pays for fame. And when the day comes... I want to stand beside you and see the ships go through the canal. I'll know you built it for all the people in the world.
