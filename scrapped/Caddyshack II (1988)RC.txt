building on that site and move this entire housing project somewhere else dont see it Because sir hell have no choice Let me explain how the legal system really works You see Mr Blunt if your client doesnt voluntarily cease and desist well be forced to go through the long and very costly process of injunctions law suits motions counter motions hearings appeals Which will cost you so much in legal fees and construction delays youll wish youd never heard of the Historical Preservation Society Because theres no way in hell wed let you come barging into Bushwood Estates and throw up a lot of cheap housing for bluecollar trash Which one of you is Chandler Youngs son am Youve certainly made it clear how your legal system works Mr Young Now d like to explain a little bit about the Peter Blunt system You see dont go in for law suits and motions or any of that legal stuff No no see what happens is find out where you live and then come to your house see and beat down your door with a fuckin
