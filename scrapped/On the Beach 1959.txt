GOT A BIT OF A BURN YESTERDAY AT THE BEACH AFTER ALL. YOU'D BETTER PUT SOME CALAMINE STUFF ON IT. [ Laughs ] YOU DID GIVE JENNIFER HER BOTTLE ? I LAID OUT YOUR WHITE UNIFORM. WAS THAT RIGHT ? I ALMOST FORGO I HAVE TO DASH. PETER ? MM-HMM ? THEY MUST BE GIVING YOU A SHIP OF YOUR OWN. NO, DARLING. THEY DON'T GIVE SHIPS TO LIEUTENANTS. THEN WHY WOULD IT BE ADMIRAL BRIDIE HIMSELF ? IF YOU WERE JUST TO REPLACE SOMEONE WHO'S ILL OR SOMETHING, THAT WOULDN'T MEAN SEEING ADMIRAL BRIDIE, WOULD IT ? I DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT THESE DAYS. I'LL PICK UP JENNY'S MILK ON THE WAY HOME FROM THE STATION. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO PICK IT UP ? THEY JUST WON'T BE DELIVERING IT ANYMORE, I UNDERSTAND. OH. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY, PETER. IF I WHEEL JENNIFER DOWN TO THE CLUB AFTER LUNCH, COULD YOU MEET ME THERE FOR A SWIM ? PETER ? THEY JUST DECIDED THA YESTERDAY. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN MELBOURNE BY 11:00, YOU'D BETTER HURRY. SO LONG, CHARLIE. [ Traffic Whistle Blows, Streetcar Bell Rings ] [ Bicycle Bells Ringing ] HOSGOOD ? HOSGOOD ! YES, SIR ? HAVE YOU SEEN THIS FROM THAT IDIO ATTENBOROUGH, THAT GREAT CORRELATOR OF STATISTICS ? YES, SIR. IT'S FINALLY SEEPED DOWN TO HIM THAT MOST OF THE OIL IN THE WORLD... COMES FROM THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE. ATTENBOROUGH SAYS SO. IT'S NOW OFFICIAL. WE WILL CAREFULLY CONSERVE THE REMAINING SUPPLIES OF PETROL IN THE DEPOT. YES, SIR. HOSGOOD ! LIEUTENANT HOLMES IS HERE, SIR. AH, YES. COME IN, COME IN. SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN. THANKS, SIR. I HAVE AN ASSIGNMEN FOR YOU. DO YOU CARE FOR SOME OF THIS MISERABLE MUCK THAT PASSES FOR COFFEE ? NO, THANK YOU, SIR. IT'S A REASONABLY IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT, AS THINGS GO THESE DAYS. THAT'S GETTING TO BE QUITE A PHRASE, ISN'T IT ? "THESE DAYS." YOU FIND YOURSELF USING IT ? YES, SIR. I'M AFRAID I DO. I'M SORRY IT CAN'T BE ONE OF OUR OWN SHIPS. IT'S SEAGOING THOUGH AND BETTER THAN SITTING AROUND ON YOUR BOTTOM. LIAISON OFFICER ABOARD THE AMERICAN SUBMARINE SAWFISH. SHE JUST DOCKED. NUCLEAR-POWERED, OF COURSE. YOU KNOW ABOUT HER ? YES, SIR. I READ THE REPORT. SHE'S AT OUR DISPOSAL FOR A CRUISE: RECONNAISSANCE OR WHATEVER YOU CARE TO CALL IT. YOU'LL SAIL SOON, BUT JUST WHEN OR WHERE OR FOR HOW LONG I CAN'T TELL YOU, NOT UNTIL THE GOVERNMEN AND A PACK OF THESE LONGHAIRED SCIENTISTS SORT THEMSELVES OUT. SHE'S MOORED ACROSS THE DOCK FROM THE CARRIERMELBOURNE IN WILLIAMSTOWN. YOU'LL REPOR TO THE CAPTAIN, TOWERS. THAT WILL BE ALL, HOLMES. SIR, WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO DISCUSS THE DURATION OF THIS APPOINTMENT ? NO. BUT I CAN GIVE YOU A REVIEW IN FOUR MONTHS. THANKS VERY MUCH, SIR, BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO BE HOME IF POSSIBLE WHEN-- IS THERE ANY OFFICIAL ESTIMATE AS TO HOW MUCH LONGER ? THE BEAKER-HEADS, THE FINGER-IN-THE-WIND BOYS SAY, CALCULATING THE RATE OF DRIF OR WHAT HAVE YOU... ABOUT FIVE MONTHS BEFORE IT GETS HERE. THAT'S WHY I SAY FOUR FOR REVIEW. THERE'S TRANSPOR LEAVING FOR WILLIAMSTOWN, IF YOU CARE TO TAKE THAT. YES, SIR. HOSGOOD, WHERE IS THIS COFFEE COMING FROM ? SUPPLY SAYS IT'S THE BES THEY CAN DO THESE DAYS, SIR. SHALL I QUERY THEM AGAIN ? NO, NO, NO. IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU HAVE ANYTHING IMPORTAN TO DO, HOSGOOD ? NO, SIR. WHAT IS IT ? OH, NOTHING. I JUST THOUGH YOU MIGHT LIKE TO TAKE YOURSELF OFF TILL MONDAY. A FINE WEEKEND. BOYFRIEND OR WHATEVER. NO, I-- I GUESS NOT. I'LL BE HERE, SIR. ???? [ Bugle ] ???? [ Continues ] [ Man Over P.A. System ] ALL WATCHES OF SEAMEN FALL IN ON THE DECK.

I'LL SEE YOU MONDAY, LIEUTENANT. THANKS. IT'S FUNNY. SOMEHOW I GE THE FEELING... THEY'RE PUTTING HER IN MOTH BALLS. SIR ? I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO BUNK YOU WITH THIS SCIENTIST FELLOW... WHO'S COMING ABOARD FROM THE C.S.I.R. SORRY. I DON'T KNOW WHO HE'LL BE JUST YET. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, SIR. I'LL MANAGE. CARE FOR A DRINK BEFORE LUNCH ? YES, SIR, IF IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S AUSTRALIAN COUNTRY IN THE FLATTOP-- I'LL HAVE TO STICK TO COKE. YOU HAVE WHATEVER YOU LIKE. [ Bell Ringing ] I'M A BIT PUZZLED ABOUT THIS CRUISE, SIR. OUR DESTINATION, I MEAN. ADMIRAL BRIDIE SEEMS... A BIT INDEFINITE. OF COURSE, IF THERE'S SOME REASON I SHOULDN'T KNOW-- NO, THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW. BUT OUTSIDE OF THE FAC THAT IT'S RECONNAISSANCE, I DON'T KNOW ANY MORE ABOUT IT THAN YOU DO. OF COURSE, THE CREW HAS IT ALL DOWN PAT. WE'RE SAILING THE END OF NEXT WEEK. WE'RE GOING NORTH, AND WE'LL BE BACK IN TWO MONTHS. [ Chuckles ] BUT I'LL LET YOU KNOW... AS SOON AS I HEAR ANYTHING MORE OFFICIAL. DO YOU LIVE IN MELBOURNE ? JUST OUTSIDE, ACTUALLY, IN FRANKSTON. THAT'S THREE-QUARTERS OF AN HOUR BY ELECTRIC TRAIN. YOU MAKE OUT ALL RIGHT ? ANY SERIOUS SHORTAGES YET ? YES, A FEW. PETROL MAINLY, BUT WE MANAGE. SAY, UH-- I'VE BEEN STICKING PRETTY CLOSE HERE LATELY. THINK I'M DUE FOR SOME SHORE FOOD. YOU KNOW OF A PLACE WHERE WE MIGHT GE A GOOD STEAK ? YES, I SUPPOSE SO. THE ADMIRAL FIXED ME UP WITH A TEMPORARY CARD... FOR SOMETHING CALLED THE PASTORAL CLUB. WHAT'S THAT LIKE ? IT'S A MAHOGANY- AND-POLISHED-BRASS PLACE. SOME PEOPLE USED TO CLAIM IT WAS THE STUFFIEST CLUB IN THE COMMONWEALTH. I SUPPOSE THERE'S NO ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT NOW. WOULD THEY HAVE ANY SCOTCH LEFT ? YES, IF ANYONE DOES. MY WIFE'S UNCLE LIVES THERE; MOSTLY AT THE BAR THESE DAYS, I UNDERSTAND. I WOULD THINK THEY WOULD HAVE SOME SCOTCH, YES. SOUNDS GOOD. LET'S GIVE IT A TRY. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN FIVE MINUTES. SOMETIMES I THINK THAT CHILD COULD FLOA A BATTLESHIP. THAT'S WHA I TOLD THE ADMIRAL. PETER, HOW COULD YOU ? I DON'T KNOW, REALLY. I JUST HELD THE TOWEL LIKE THIS AND-- VERY FUNNY. YOU'RE STARTING TO GE YOUR FIGURE BACK, AREN'T YOU, CHARLIE ? YOU KNOW, AFTER JENNIFER AND ALL. A LITTLE HERE, A LITTLE THERE. BY THE WAY, I INVITED CAPTAIN TOWERS FOR THE WEEKEND. OH, PETER, YOU DIDN'T. I HAD TO, REALLY. WE HAD LUNCH TOGETHER, AND HE STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE LIVE AND ALL. MARY, I WOULD HAVE LOOKED AN AWFUL CLOD NO TO HAVE ASKED HIM. HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT, I THINK. WAS HE MARRIED, DO YOU KNOW ? TWO KIDS. AND THEY'RE GONE ? YES, THEY WERE IN AMERICA. NAPPIES FLYING IN THE BREEZE, PABLUM EVERYWHERE-- THEY'RE BOUND TO REMIND HIM. WE'LL JUST TRY TO GET THEM OUT OF SIGHT, THAT'S ALL. HE'LL GET SODDEN AND WEEP. I CAN' STAND THAT AGAIN. HE DOESN'T LOOK THE TYPE TO ME. YOUR R.A.F. CHUM DIDN'T EITHER. NOW, MARY-- WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH HIM FOR TWO DAYS ? FOR ONE THING, I THOUGH A PARTY ON SATURDAY NIGHT. TEN OR TWELVE PEOPLE. WE HAVEN' DONE THAT FOR A WHILE. WOULD YOU LIKE THAT ? WELL, AS LONG AS THEY ALL UNDERSTAND HOW I FEEL ABOUT THOSE MORBID DISCUSSIONS. WE WOULD HAVE TO GE SOMEONE FOR HIM, THOUGH. WHAT ABOUT MOIRA ? WHY NOT ? IF SHE'S SOBER THIS WEEKEND. JULIAN SAID SHE'D GIVEN IT UP. NO, DARLING, YOU DIDN'T LISTEN. JULIAN SAID SHE'D GIVEN UP GIN... FOR BRANDY. SHE SAYS SHE CAN DRINK MORE BRANDY. MOIRA'S NOT A BAD NOTION, IN POINT OF FACT. SHE'D KEEP HIM OCCUPIED, AT LEAST. BUT SHE'D HAVE TO STOP OVER, AND WE CAN'T JUST PUT HIM ON A COT. PUT MOIRA ON A CO ON THE VERANDA. SHE CLAIMS SHE'S NOT SLEP IN HER OWN BED THE LAS THREE MONTHS ANYWAY. THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY FAIR. IT'S ALL ON THE SURFACE. I'LL RING HER UP TONIGH AND GIVE HER THE DRILL. I WONDER WHAT HE'S LIKE WHEN HE GETS A SKINFUL ? PETER-- WHAT ? YOU DO UNDERSTAND HOW I FEEL ABOUT PEOPLE TALKING ? SURE. AND YOU DO LOVE ME ? OF COURSE I DO. THEN WHY DON'T YOU EVER SAY SO ? [ Man ] GIVE HER WHAT FOR, MATE. [ Horn Blowing ] YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ME. AM I ? MM-HMM. I'M MOIRA DAVIDSON. M-O-I-R-A. IT WAS A VERY FASHIONABLE NAME IN BAD NOVELS WHEN MY MOTHER WAS YOUNG AND IMPRESSIONABLE. I'M A THROWBACK. [ Laughs ] WHERE'S HOLMES ? OH, HE'S DECKING THE HALLS WITH HOLLY. HE SENT ME FOR BETTER OR WORSE. BETTER, I'D SAY. I'M YOUR DATE OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT. HOW'D YOU RECOGNIZE ME ? [ Laughs ] I LOVE AMERICANS. THEY'RE SO NAIVE. THIS WAY, COMMANDER. A NEW MODEL. ONLY ONE HORSEPOWER, BUT SHE DOES A GOOD EIGHT MILES AN HOUR ON THE FLAT. QUITE A BUGGY. OVER 70 YEARS OLD. DAD SAID SHE WAS MADE IN AMERICA. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED. GIVE ME YOUR TOOTHBRUSH. TAKE AMELIA'S HEAD WHILE I SEE IF WE CAN GET US OUT OF HERE. SHE'S STILL A WEE BI STICKY IN REVERSE. ALL RIGHT, BOY. HERE WE GO. IS THERE A PLACE WE MIGHT STOP WHERE I COULD GET A LITTLE BREAKFAST ? WHAT ? "A LITTLE BREAKFAST." DO YOU MEAN THAT IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING ELSE, I HAVE TO WATCH YOU EAT BACON AND EGGS AND ALL THAT MUCK ? I WAS ON A PARTY LAST NIGHT, AND I GOT UP AT 8:00 IN THE MORNING TO MEET YOU. I, UH-- OH, NEVER MIND. HOP IN. BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY ME A COUPLE DRINKS TO GET ME STARTED. [ Laughing ] OH, INCIDENTALLY, THEY DIDN'T TELL ME WHAT TO CALL YOU. WHAT'S THE PROTOCOL ? MY NAME IS TOWERS, DWIGHT LIONEL TOWERS. REALLY ? REALLY. HANG ON, DWIGHT LIONEL. [ Cracking Whip ] ???? [ Piano ] ???? [ Continues ] [ Towers ] AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE'VE ONLY BEEN IN PORT FOR THREE DAYS. IT'S CALLED THESAWFISH. MY SECOND HUSBAND WAS AN AMERICAN. WE TRAVELED ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND EVERYWHERE WE WEN HE WOULD SAY TO PEOPLE, "I AM AN AMERICAN. I AM AN AMERICAN." THEY FINALLY SHOT HIM IN ONE OF THOSE EASTERN COUNTRIES. OH. WELL, I'M SORRY. I WAS TOO. HE WAS SUCH A NICE MAN WHILE HE LASTED. IS HE YOURS, MOIRA ? OH, ON LOAN. OH. WELL... TOODLE. [ Snickers ] TOODLE. [ Laughs ] [ Guests Chattering ] HE JUST DRINKS AND DRINKS AND NOTHING HAPPENS. AT LEAST HE HASN' BURST INTO TEARS. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. [ Man ] AMEN ! [ Man #2 ] THAT'S SHEER BALDERDASH ! I NEVER HEARD SO MUCH NONSENSE IN MY LIFE. YOU MEAN TO TELL ME, THIS WHOLE WAR WAS AN ACCIDENT ? NO, IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT. I DIDN'T SAY THAT. IT WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED, DOWN TO THE TINIEST MECHANICAL AND EMOTIONAL DETAIL. BUT IT WAS A MISTAKE, IT WAS A BEAUT. IN THE END, SOMEHOW GRANTED THE TIME FOR EXAMINATION, WE SHALL FIND THAT OUR SO-CALLED CIVILIZATION WAS GLORIOUSLY DESTROYED... BY A HANDFUL OF VACUUM TUBES AND TRANSISTORS. PROBABLY FAULTY. [ Man #2 ] THERE YOU ARE, JULIAN. NOW WE KNOW WHERE THE BLAME LIES. OH, NO, YOU DON'T. NO. NO. MAYBE WE WERE THE BLIND MECHANICS OF DISASTER, BUT YOU DON'T PIN THE GUIL ON THE SCIENTISTS THAT EASILY. YOU MIGHT AS WELL PIN IT ON... MOTHERHOOD. IT SHOULD BE PINNED ON SOMEBODY. YOU SCIENTISTS ARE THE LIKELY ONES AS FAR AS I CAN SEE. YOU BUILT THE BOMB. YOU EXPERIMENTED WITH IT, TESTED IT AND EXPLODED IT. JUST A MOMENT, MORGAN. THANKS TO YOU CHAPS, A MOMENT IS ABOUT ALL WE HAVE. EVERY MAN WHO EVER WORKED ON THIS THING TOLD YOU WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THE SCIENTISTS SIGNED PETITION AFTER PETITION, JULIAN, PLEASE. BUT NOBODY LISTENED. THERE WAS A CHOICE. IT WAS BUILD THE BOMBS AND USE THEM... OR RISK THE UNITED STATES, THE SOVIET UNION AND THE REST OF US... WOULD FIND SOME WAY TO GO ON LIVING. [ Scoffs ] THAT'S WISHFUL THINKING, IF EVER I HEARD IT. [ Julian ] I'M NOT AGAINS WISHFUL THINKING, NOT NOW. [ Morgan ] THEY PUSHED US TOO FAR. THEY DIDN'T THINK WE'D FIGHT, NO MATTER WHAT THEY DID. AND THEY WERE WRONG. WE FOUGHT. WE EXPUNGED THEM ! WE DIDN'T DO SUCH A BAD JOB ON OURSELVES. WITH THE INTERESTING RESUL THAT THE BACKGROUND LEVEL OF RADIATION... IN THIS ROOM IS NINE TIMES WHAT IT WAS A YEAR AGO. [ Holmes ] JULIAN. DON'T YOU KNOW THAT ? NINE TIMES ! WE'RE ALL DOOMED, YOU KNOW. THE WHOLE SILLY, DRUNKEN, PATHETIC LOT OF US. DOOMED BY THE AIR WE'RE ABOUT TO BREATHE. WE HAVEN' GOT A CHANCE ! STOP IT ! I WON'T HAVE IT, JULIAN ! I WON'T. THERE IS HOPE. THERE HAS TO BE HOPE. THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE. WE JUST CAN' GO ON LIKE THIS. WE CAN'T. WE-- WE-- [ Sobs ] [ Door Closes ] I SHOULDN'T DRINK, YOU KNOW. I INEVITABLY SAY SOMETHING BRILLIANT. SORRY. [ Guests Chattering Softly ] [ Puts Down Glass ] [ Sobbing ] [ Continues Sobbing ] I-- I CAN'T HELP IT, PETER. I'M SORRY. I JUST CAN'T. EVERYBODY'S GONE TO BED. YOU LIKE THAT ? SETTLES THE STOMACH. I HAD A LOT TO DRINK. I HAD A LOT TO DRINK. JULIAN HAD A LOT TO DRINK. JULIAN AND I ARE THE TOWN DRUNKS. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO FORGET ? IT'S A DAMN SILLY QUESTION IF I EVER HEARD ONE. [ Chuckles ] YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION. YOU KNOW... SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN ME A COPY... OF THE LOCAL GROUND RULES. I MIGHT HAVE OPENED MY BIG MOUTH. [ Chuckling ] DANGER STRUCK FROM THE WRONG QUARTER. THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY WATCH THE WRONG MOUSE HOLE. COME AGAIN ? BUT THEN WHO WOULD KNOW YOU WERE SO TOUGH AND DRANK STRAIGHT MILK ? WHERE ARE YOU FROM ? WHICH STATE ? [ Laughs ] I'M FROM IDAHO. IDAHO ? I KNOW BETTER THAN THAT. THERE'S NO NAVY IN IDAHO BECAUSE IT'S TOO HILLY. WELL, I WAS BORN IN IDAHO. I LIVE IN CONNECTICUT NOW. NEAR NEW LONDON, WHERE I'M BASED. WHERE WERE YOU DURING ALL THE WATCHAMACALLIT ? OH, NO. I DIDN'T MEAN TO ASK YOU THAT. PETER SAID NOT TO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER. I CAN'T DECIDE IF I'M MORE OBJECTIONABLE DRUNK OR SOBER. IT'S PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT. WE WERE AT SEA... BETWEEN KISKA AND MIDWAY, WHEN IT BEGAN. WE GOT ORDERS TO GO TO THE WEST PACIFIC, AND WHEN WE PUT OUR NOSE UP NORTH OF IWO JIMA... THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH RADIOACTIVE DUST. SO WE DUCKED. LATER ON, TOOK A LOOK AT MANILA... THROUGH THE PERISCOPE. IT WAS STILL TOO HO TO SURFACE, SO WE CAME DOWN THE COAST OF AUSTRALIA... AND ENDED UP HERE. THERE WASN'T MUCH OF ANYPLACE ELSE TO GO. [ Pouring A Drink ] YOU LOOK MARRIED. OH, I AM. MY WIFE'S NAME IS SHARON. I HAVE A COUPLE OF KIDS: RICHARD, EIGHT; HELEN, FIVE. [ Chuckles ] DICK IS THE REAL SAILOR OF THE FAMILY. HE IS GOING TO ANNAPOLIS. [ Chuckles ] OH, THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED. HE'LL PROBABLY CHANGE HIS MIND. WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG ? CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT TO ME ? NOBODY CAN EXPLAIN IT TO ME. AND DON'T TELL ME ABOU THOSE DAMN WINDS AGAIN. HOW THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE AND THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE... GET ALL MIXED UP AND OVERLAP. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THAT ANYMORE. ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS... IF EVERYBODY WAS SO SMART, WHY DIDN'T THEY KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN ? THEY DID. WELL, I-- I CAN'T TAKE IT. I-- [ Sighs ] OH, YES, I CAN TAKE IT. BUT IT'S UNFAIR. IT'S UNFAIR BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING... AND NOBODY I KNOW DID ANYTHING. MAYBE I'M STUPID. I HAD TO TAKE ALGEBRA TWICE. THE ONLY THING I COULD UNDERSTAND WAS GEOGRAPHY. I LIKE GEOGRAPHY. YOU KNOW WHA I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO ? I WANTED TO WALK DOWN THE RUE DE RIVOLI. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO THE RUE DE RIVOLI ? YES. I WANTED TO WALK DOWN THE RUE DE RIVOLI, AND I WANTED TO BUY GLOVES. I KNOW THE FRENCH WORD FOR GLOVES-- [ Sobbing ] NO, YOU'VE GOT I ALL BACKWARDS. WHAT'S THAT ? I WAS SUPPOSED TO COMFORT YOU, AND YOU'RE COMFORTING ME. I'M CRYING. EVERYBODY WAS SO AFRAID THAT YOU MIGHT CRY. THEY WERE ? ISN'T THAT FUNNY ? [ Chuckling ] NO. SOMETIMES I DO. YOU BETTER GO TO BED. MM-HMM. BUT YOU'RE IN MY BEDROOM. OH. WELL... I'LL CLEAR OUT. DWIGHT. EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE ME, WOULD YOU PLEASE HOLD ONTO ME JUST FOR A MOMENT LONGER ? THIS FELLOW JULIAN-- AND HERE ON SOME KIND OF SCIENTIFIC JOB. WHAT'S HE DO, EXACTLY ? [ Bridie ] I THINK PROFESSOR JORGENSON SHOULD OUTLINE HIS PLAN... BEFORE WE MAKE A DECISION. [ Jorgenson ] SIMPLY STATED, OUR VIEW, OUR STRONG OPINION, IS THIS: DURING THE LAST WINTER IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE, RAIN AND SNOW MAY HAVE WASHED THE AIR, SO TO SPEAK, CAUSING THE RADIOACTIVE ELEMENTS TO FALL TO THE GROUND MORE QUICKLY THAN ANTICIPATED. BUT THE TRANSFER OF RADIOACTIVITY TO US... WOULD BE PROGRESSIVELY DECREASED, AND HUMAN LIFE COULD GO ON HERE OR, AT LEAST, IN ANTARCTICA-- THAT'S CLEAR ENOUGH, PROFESSOR JORGENSON. IT'S A HOPE. WE AGREE AND THE GOVERNMEN AGREES THAT IT'S WORTH TRYING TO FIND OUT, ANYHOW. HOW FAR NORTH COULD A VESSEL PROCEED ? OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THA THE SUBMARINE SHOULD GO... AS FAR NORTH IN THE PACIFIC AS POSSIBLE, TO POINT BARROW, AND MAKE THE NECESSARY RADIOACTIVITY READINGS. THE PRIME MINISTER'S INSTRUCTION, INCIDENTALLY, IS THESAWFISHBE EXPOSED TO AS FEW DANGERS AS POSSIBLE. COMMANDER, HOW ABOUT ICE THAT FAR NORTH ? SHE'S NO ICEBREAKER. WE CAN FEEL OUR WAY. I MAKE IT OVER 13,000 MILES ROUND TRIP. ENOUGH POWER IN YOUR REACTOR FOR THAT, COMMANDER ? I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A CONSIDERABLE STOCKPILE OF URANIUM HERE. ENOUGH FOR TEN TRIPS LIKE THIS. WISH WE HAD SOMETHING WE COULD USE IT IN. YOU MIGHT TRY USING I IN MY CAR. [ Men Chuckling ] GET A LOAD OF THE CHARLIE WHEELER. MAY I BE OF ASSISTANCE ? YES, I'M LOOKING FOR CAPTAIN TOWERS. I'LL TRY TO LOCATE HIM FOR YOU. PAULSON, SHOW THE LADY TO CAPTAIN TOWERS' CABIN ON THEMELBOURNE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S A PLEASURE. RIGHT THIS WAY, PLEASE. RELAX. [ Wolf Whistle ] CAPTAIN. THERE'S, UH... SOMEBODY TO SEE YOU. I ASKED HER TO WAI IN YOUR STATEROOM. OH. HELLO. A VERY NICE MAN ASKED ME TO WAIT HERE. I DON'T THINK HE KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH ME. THAT'S DEBATABLE. DID YOU-- DID YOU ASK ME TO VISI YOUR SUBMARINE ONE DAY ? HMM... NO. OH, I COULDN'T REMEMBER. OH, IN THE MEANTIME, I'VE BEEN SNOOPING. REGULAR FISH, THESE KIDS. I'LL HAVE TO GET THEM A BOAT OF THEIR OWN ONE OF THESE DAYS. SIT DOWN. THANK YOU. HERE, HAVE A CIGARETTE. THANK YOU. I'M GLAD YOU CAME. OH... I JUST BET YOU ARE. NO, I AM. REALLY. AND I'LL JUST BE THAT MY CREW DIDN'T MIND TOO MUCH EITHER. YES, I HAVE A SNEAKING SUSPICION THEY DIDN'T MIND AT ALL. [ Laughs ] [ Knocking ] COME IN. I SEE THEY FOUND YOU. OH, MR. CHRYSLER. SEE IF YOU CAN FIND MISS DAVIDSON SOMETHING SHE CAN WEAR... TO GO DOWN IN THESAWFISH. YES, SIR. I, UH-- I TAKE I YOU PUT ME TO BED. YES. I ARRIVED AT THA BY DEDUCTION. I ASKED PETER AND MARY, AND THEY DIDN'T. [ Sighs ] I'M AFRAID I WAS A BIT OF A MESS. YOU DRANK TOO MUCH BRANDY. YOU PASSED OUT. YES, I'VE BEEN DRINKING QUITE A BIT RECENTLY. THAT'S NO BIG SECRET. BUT, YOU KNOW, I-- I'VE NEVER HAD IT HAPPEN QUITE LIKE THAT BEFORE. MY OBVIOUS JOB WAS TO SEDUCE YOU. SO I SUPPOSE MY PRIDE IS HURT. I OUGHT TO FEEL ASHAMED. WHY DID YOU BOTHER ABOUT ME ? THERE'S A REGULATION IN HERE SOMEWHERE. IT'S UNDER "SHORE DUTY." I'LL READ IT TO YOU. NO, TELL ME. [ Tosses Book On Shelf ] IT SAYS WHEN A YOUNG LADY HAS HAD SO MUCH TO DRINK, SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING, YOU PUT HER TO BED... AND GO BACK TO THE SHIP. THAT'S WHA IT SAYS ? THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS. [ Knocking ] YES ? WELL, THIS REQUIRES QUITE A COMPREHENSIVE CHANGE. ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS ? YOU CAN'T GO DOWN IN A SUBMARINE IN THAT BALLET COSTUME. [ Laughs ] I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES. UNPACK THAT ONE NEXT, PLEASE. THAT ONE. EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL, MR. OSBORNE ? OH, I GUESS SO. BLASTED IDIOTS SENT ME TWO WRONG COMPONENTS. I'LL HAVE TO GET THEM REPLACED THIS AFTERNOON. AS LONG AS THEY'RE RIGH WHEN WE SAIL. WHAT IS HE DOING HERE ? MR. OSBORNE'S BEEN ASSIGNED BY THE C.S.I.R.... TO LOOK AFTER OUR HEALTH ON THE TRIP. "HEALTH" ? IT'S YOUR SUBMARINE. CAPTAIN... MAY I SEE YOU A MINUTE, SIR ? HALF A SECOND. VERY BECOMING OUTFIT. YOU KNOW, JULIAN, THEY DON'T ALLOW DRINKING ON AMERICAN SUBMARINES. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT ELSE YOU'D DO. THANKS VERY MUCH. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ? OH, KEEP AN EYE ON THE WEATHER. CHECK ON RADIATION. I GUESS I'M SOR OF A SCIENTIFIC CRUISE DIRECTOR. THEN IT CAN BE DANGEROUS ? I WOULDN'T KNOW, REALLY. A RELATIVE QUESTION AT BEST, ISN'T IT ? IT SEEMS THAT EVERYBODY I KNOW IS GOING. I FEEL LEFT OUT. I CAN SING AND DANCE. YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME. THE ADMIRAL IS UP TOP. DON'T YOU GO AWAY. [ Beeping Morse Code ] [ Beeping Continues ] [ Typing ] IT'S THE DAMNEDEST THING. STARTED THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY. CAME ON AGAIN TEN MINUTES AGO, SIR. STARTS AND STOPS. WE'VE MONITORED 60 HOURS SO FAR. IT'S WEIRD. YOU'RE SURE IT'S FROM SAN DIEGO ? WITHIN A 100-MILE RADIUS. IT'S AS CLOSE AS WE'RE ABLE TO PINPOINT IT, WITHOUT TRIANGULATION. [ Beeping Continues ] COULD IT BE A KID, SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T KNOW MORSE ? WE'VE MADE TWO WORDS, SIR: "WATER" AND "CONNECT." YOU KNOW THE OLD STORY ABOUT AN INFINITE NUMBER OF MONKEYS... AND AN INFINITE NUMBER OF TYPEWRITERS. ONE OF THEM HAS TO END UP WRITING "KING LEAR." I MAY BE CRACKING UP UNDER THE STRAIN, LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, BUT THIS INTERESTS ME. IT'S MORE THAN JORGENSON'S THEORY. IT'S A FACT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, BUT IT'S A FACT. A RADIO SIGNAL IS COMING FROM AROUND SAN DIEGO, AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE. THERE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE ANY POWER FOR TRANSMISSION. HYDROELECTRIC ? YES, POSSIBLY. THERE HAS TO BE AN EXPLANATION, AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IT IS. NOT THAT I'LL LIVE ANY LONGER FOR KNOWING. [ Beeping Continues ] HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRACK IT DOWN ? I'D LIKE IT, SIR. VERY WELL, THEN. I'VE BEEN ON TO OUR ELECTRONIC WIZARDS. THEY TELL US YOU HAVE RADIO DIRECTION EQUIPMENT THAT CAN BE USED FROM PERISCOPE DEPTH. IS THAT CORRECT ? YES. IT HASN'T BEEN USED MUCH. WE'LL HAVE TO RUN SOME TESTS. I'D LIKE I TO BE IN THE PINK. PERHAPS YOU CAN AMUSE YOURSELF AROUND HERE A LITTLE LONGER... UNTIL YOU'RE READY TO LEAVE. [ Beeping Continues ] [ Laughs ] HEY ! WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR ? WE COULD HAVE WON. THEY'VE HAD IT. ARE THEY ALL RIGHT ? THEY'RE ALL RIGHT, BUT THEY'RE OUT OF THE RACE. IT'S LIKE LOOKING AT A FRENCH MOVIE. [ Laughing ] DR. FLETCHER ? WHAT ABOUT THESE PILLS THEY'VE GOT, WHATEVER THEY ARE ? THEY'LL BE AVAILABLE FROM THE CHEMISTS' SHOPS ON THE FREE LIST... WHEN THE TIME COMES. I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE GOT THEM ALREADY... AT PORT MORESBY AND DARWIN. APPARENTLY. WHAT'S THE EFFECT ? LETHARGY, THEN SOME EUPHORIA, COMA, THEN NOTHING. IN FAIRLY RAPID ORDER. YOU, UH-- YOU DON'T SUPPOSE YOU COULD GET ME A COUPLE ? AND... WH-WHATEVER IT IS FOR CHILDREN ? NOT A CHANCE... UNTIL THE TIME COMES. SORRY, PETER. I'M BEGINNING TO TWITCH WHEN I HEAR THE WORD "TIME." IF FOR SOME REASON-- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT NOW, I'M JUST TALKING-- IF THERE'S ONE THING YOU COULD DO-- NO. NO, I KNOW WHAT I MEAN. WHEN THE DENTIS IS DRILLING YOUR TOOTH, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ? THE NICEST THING ? SEX ? OR WHAT ? [ Laughs ] FISHING. TROUT FISHING IN A CLEAN MOUNTAIN STREAM. YOU WOULD. WHY NOT GO THEN, WHEN YOU COME BACK ? THE SEASON DOESN'T OPEN UNTIL SEPTEMBER. I'VE ASKED. YOU THINK I CAN'T FIX THAT ? YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW IMPORTANT PEOPLE, THAT I SPEND ALL MY TIME WITH THIS MOLDY SUBURBAN SET ? YOU CAN'T MEAN ME. SHE NEVER BOTTLED LIKE THA BEFORE. WHAT HAPPENED ? [ Laughs ] SHE BOTTLED US. I WAS TRYING TO WIN. TAKING THE RACE TOO SERIOUSLY, NOT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO HER. TRUTH IS, HE MADE A PASS AT ME. I HAD TO GO OVERBOARD IN SELF-DEFENSE. WELL, IF THAT-- [ Squeals, Laughing ] [ Towers Laughing ] [ All Chuckling ] I LIKE TO SEE THE YOUNG FOLKS ENJOYING THEMSELVES. [ Laughing ] WHAT ? YOU NEVER WRESTLE WITH ME ANYMORE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ? I MEAN EXACTLY WHAT I SAY. YOU NEVER WRESTLE WITH ME ANYMORE. ALL RIGHT. PETER, REALLY. YOU SAID I NEVER WRESTLE. NEVER MIND... FOR NOW. [ Sighing ] NOW, TELL THEM THE TRUTH. BUT I TOLD THEM THE TRUTH. SHARON IS THE MOS TERRIBLE LIAR THAT-- I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS. HOW MUCH OF THIS GOULD CAMPBELL HAVE WE GOT LEFT, STEVENS ? BETTER THAN 400 BOTTLES, SIR. AND IN ITS PRIME. SHOCKING. SHOCKING ! FOUR-HUNDRED BOTTLES OF VINTAGE POR IN THE CELLARS... AND BARELY FIVE MONTHS TO GO. FIVE MONTHS, MARK YOU ! IF WHAT THESE SCIENTIST CHAPS SAY IS RIGHT. I THINK IT NEEDS ANOTHER YEAR, ACTUALLY. I BLAME THE WINE COMMITTEE VERY MUCH. VERY MUCH, INDEED. SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE FORESIGHT. HOW CAN THE MEMBERS BE EXPECTED TO GET THROUGH 400 BOTTLES OF PORT... IN FIVE MONTHS' TIME ? BAD PLANNING, I SAY. RIDICULOUS. I'LL TAKE ANOTHER BOTTLE HOME WITH ME TODAY, STEVENS. YES, SIR. SIR DOUGLAS FROUDE IS EXPECTING ME. I BELIEVE HE'S IN THE BAR, SIR. THANK YOU. YES, I'VE HEARD ABOUT THOSE PILLS. THIS CRUISE IS DEVELOPING INTO SOMETHING BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT. I MAY NOT BE HERE WHEN IT HAPPENS. I UNDERSTAND, BUT IF DR. FLETCHER CAN'T GET THEM FOR YOU... I'M NOT CERTAIN I CAN. I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE. YOU'RE MY LAST HOPE. YOU'RE CONVINCED YOU WANT MARY TO HAVE THEM NOW ? I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT I A GREAT DEAL. YES, SIR. YES, I DO. HMM. I'M NOT CERTAIN YOU'RE RIGHT... BUT CONSIDERING MARY-- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WEIGH I CARRY WITH THE GOVERNMEN IN MY OLD AGE. THERE'S A LOT OF BUREAUCRACY STILL, YOU KNOW ? EVEN IN DEATH. BUT TAKE THIS AROUND ANYWAY AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. THANK YOU. THE WINE COMMITTEE IS MAD, ABSOLUTELY MAD. FOUR HUNDRED BOTTLES OF VINTAGE PORT. TOO LATE. TOO LATE. SORRY, DYKERS. GOOD SHOW. CARRY ON. [ Laughs ] AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE WHOLE THING IS DUE TO THE WINE COMMITTEE... HAVING FAILED TO CONSERVE THEIR SUPPLIES PROPERLY. IF THEY'D ONLY REGULATED THEIR-- OH, HOW NICE. HAVE YOU NOTICED MOIRA ISN'T DRINKING SO MUCH ? I WONDER WHY ? NO, I HADN'T NOTICED. PETER ? MM-HMM ? COULD WE AFFORD AN ELECTRIC MOWER FOR THE LAWN ? A VERY LITTLE ONE I COULD START MYSELF WHILE YOU'RE AWAY ? DORIS HAYMES HAS ONE. SHE DOES ? WELL, SHE'S CUT THE CORD THREE TIMES AND NEARLY ELECTROCUTED HERSELF. BESIDES, DARLING, I DOUBT THERE'S ANY LEFT. WHAT'S THAT ? SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN. THIS IS SOMETHING I WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOU BEFORE I GO. YOU'RE GOING TO BE SERIOUS ? I WISH YOU WOULDN'T. I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE. NOW, DARLING, THIS IS A BIG CRUISE WE'RE GOING ON. THERE WILL BE MINES AND ICE TO CONTEND WITH. PETER, I KNEW WHEN I MARRIED YOU THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE A NAVAL OFFICER. MY FATHER DIED AT SEA. YOU KNOW THAT. WE JUST DON'T HAVE TO DISCUSS IT, DO WE ? WE HAVE TO DISCUSS THIS, MARY, BECAUSE THERE ISN' ANY TRADITION FOR THIS. PETER-- YOU'RE GOING TO LISTEN WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. NOW, THIS IS A SPECIAL KIND OF... SLEEPING PILL. I HAD A DEVIL OF A TIME GETTING THEM, BUT I WANTED YOU TO HAVE THEM ON HAND... AND MAKE SURE YOU KNEW HOW TO USE THEM. WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE RADIATION IS THAT YOU GET ILL. YOU START FEELING SICK, AND THEN YOU ARE SICK... AND YOU GO ON BEING SICK. YOU CAN' KEEP ANYTHING DOWN. YOU MAY FEEL BETTER FOR A WHILE, BUT I ALWAYS COMES BACK. YOU GET WEAKER. AND THIS CURES IT ? DARLING, YOU KNOW NOTHING CURES IT. THIS ENDS IT. BUT, PETER... HOWEVER ILL I WAS, I COULDN'T DO THAT. WHO'D LOOK AFTER JENNIFER ? JENNY WILL GET IT TOO. YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO TELL ME YOU WANT ME TO KILL JENNIFER ? MARY, DON'T BE AN IDIOT ! SUPPOSING YOU GET IT FIRST ? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ?

MOIRA, THIS ISN' GOING TO DO US ANY-- NO, HEAR ME OUT. I WAS HURT AT FIRS WHEN I REALIZED YOU WERE MIXING ME UP WITH SHARON. AND THEN I REALIZED THA IT WAS ONE OF THE NICEST THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN TO ME. I WOULDN'T REALLY MIND IF YOU COULD FORGE ENTIRELY WHO I AM. I DON'T LIKE MYSELF VERY MUCH ANYWAY. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO TRY ? [ Streetcar Bell Rings, Traffic Whistle Blowing ] NO. IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA. I SUPPOSE IT WASN'T. THERE'S A TRAIN LEAVING AT 10:50. I THINK I'LL TAKE IT. [ Horn Honking ] YOU SEE, IN THE NAVY, DURING THE WAR, I GOT USED TO THE IDEA THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME, I MIGHT NOT MAKE IT. I ALSO GOT USED TO THE IDEA... OF MY WIFE AND CHILDREN... SAFE AT HOME. THEY'D BE ALL RIGHT, NO MATTER WHAT. WHAT I DIDN'T RECKON WITH WAS THAT IN THIS... THIS KIND OF A MONSTROUS WAR... SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN TO THEM... AND NOT TO ME. WELL, IT DID...
