 

                        300 Guineas. Now Ladies and Gentlemen, Who would start with 300 Guineas on this magnificent pair of tusks? Oh, please let's hear a Gentlemen, 300 Guineas. This ivory is exceptional. As you know, offer for sale by Mr. Aidan McRory himself. It must guaranty museum quality. Very well. Should we say 200 Guineas? Do I hear 200 Guineas? All right. What about 180? Surely, 150 Guineas? No? No one? Not sold. With our next large lot No. 38, we leave Africa and journey there to Southeast Asia. This is a 13th Century sandstone Buddha from the unknown reach of that region. I'll start the bidding at 200 Guineas. 270 Guineas to the back. 270. Thank you, sir. 350 on my left. 400 at the front. 450 on my right. 550 on my left. 700 at the front. 850 at the back. 900 Guineas. 950 Guineas sold to the gentleman at the back. Congratulations! We get down to our next lot... This is a statue dated back to late 12th Century... Beautiful statue here. Big money, but too heavy. Just take the head. Tiger! Tiger! Tiger! Run! Run! Rifle! Bring those too. We lost it. Let's go back. What's the bounty for a tiger? 150 Piasters. See that you get it. Lay this out. I'm warning you. You bite me, I'll bite you back. All right? Yeah, drink some of this. You'll like it. Look, look, See, it's nice. Come on. Try a little bit more. You can't make war on the entire world. Did you? Am I going to get that hand back, or I'm going to lose it? You'd like to keep that hand forever, don't you think? You like that? Yeah, have a little of this. They are honey drops. My favorite. Umm, nice, uh? My father, the Chief, in the name of the village, thanks you for killing the tiger. Tigers bring death. They kill all of our buffalos, our chickens, our people. We own you for the death of our enemy. After all the help he's giving me, I'm glad at his service. Will you tell the Chief, next year if I return for these statues, I'll need his assistance again. In the meantime, I know I can count on his friendship and discretion. The Chief says, discretion is the Orientals virtue. Of course. Well thank him for what he's done, I'll give him the hide. The Chief says he'd rather have them alive. No, I mean the big tiger, the dead one. The Chief says, the dead one is also welcome. He thanks you very much for both tigers. No. I don't think he understand. Can I help you, Captain? Sergeant Van Tranh. Second district. What do I see here? Pretty subject from this safari outfit. I should say statues stolen from the temples. Is that what you see? I see blocks of old stone, found in the jungle. In that case, in accordance with section 12, subsection 211 of the Mineral Resources Act, relating to the illicit use of stone quarry, I request you show me your hands. Follow me. Tiger attacked him and he lost his leg. On your way. He gives you this charm to thank you as a sign of him gratitude. Go. It will bring you luck. Looks like I might need it. The Administrator thanks you for reporting the statue thief. We know our lord by the gift he brings. So, Chief. 50, 100, 150. 200. 250. Where you put him? In the general holding cell, Mr. Administrator. Very good. Has he had anything to eat? I gave him some food, but he wouldn't touch it. Good, very good. Of course, you took him shoelaces away? Yes. We've done everything you asked, Mr. Administrator. Splendid! I don't believe it. The famous Aidan McRory is in prison. What a ludicrous these days could be, turn you in here. Open. Forgive me. I am Eugen Normandin. The Administrator of this district. It's absurd. Open. Aidan McRory is in this terrible place. My son knows all of your books. The "LION HUNT", the "IVORY TRADER", "My YEARS IN KENYA" My wife, she reads them to him. Don't tell me you took his shoelaces. You must be more careful in future. This little escapade could have cost you... Three year. You see. For the statues, give two or three of them. As for the rest, let's we call them "Holiday souvenirs." Listen. I don't know how to thank you. My boat sails tomorrow. I thought I'd be stuck for another two months. Tomorrow? We can not permit Mr. McRory to leave this country yet. Not until the paper work is finished. Oh, I feel terribly. No need for that. I'm relieved just be outside of that place. I'm grateful. Really? Really, Really. That gives me the courage to make a request. You see. It seems almost supernaturally that a great hunter like you should be sent to me just at this moment. Meet the man-eater. If you have no objection, I think we'll call you "Kumar." For your information, I am Zerbino. World famous animal tamer and director of the great Zerbino Circus. Madame Zerbino and still cooking in the oven, my son. This fire-eating sword swallower is the fearsome Saladin. Where did you find him? In the toy department? He's fearsome enough. Don't you worry. Let me see. The sooner you learn it's not the tigers who run the show, the better for you. All right. Close it up. The village is grateful that you come back again. I'm grateful for the opportunity to see you again. They think you will rid the region of the tigers. To thank you, my father wants to show you the temples up river, where there are many statues. Sounds not very far away? No. Not too far. About two week's walk. Where did you learn your English? His Excellency asked the Australian priests to open a school here, to teach us languages. I'm very impressed. What else do they teach you? To be aware of white man. Well. Mr. Administrator. We have one tiger trapped yesterday morning. Oh. Is one enough? That will depend on your guest with his shooting rifle. His Excellency's father was a great hunter. Indeed, his father has many qualities. But a great number of them appear to be puerility. I see, you are admiring my scheme. Impressive, isn't it? Yes. Soon you want me to break up these temples and ship them to London. London will come here to see them. The future is tourism, McRory. My role is going to make it happen. Poor Mr. McRory. If you have to bore the poor, there's plenty here. You might have waited until he had some lunch? My wife, Matild. My dear. May I introduce Aidan McRory, who had so kindly offer to organize the hunt for His Excellency. I know who he is, darling. I take you support the road then. Oh, I do. I support any thing that will get me out of this God forsaken home. So might you make a success of the hunt. If His Excellency agrees to let the new road to cross his land, It could be our tickets back to Europe. Champagne! Champagne! Get up! Attention! Up, up! Champagne, open it in the name of God. The Choir! Get the choir ready! I thought about your father's offer to see the temples up river. I was told the statues are more beautiful than anything I've seen yet. I wonder as it appears I am staying for a while, You think, I could persuade you to act as my guide. You see I really would need someone who speaks English. We are here. Come on. Are you all right? Ah, yes. It's just the swing. It reminds me of being at sea. What? For God's sake, shut him up! No. He's so happy. He's going hunting. Bravo! As Your Excellency's father always said, One shot one kill. With you, with Bang! Straight like an arrow. Straight as your road through the sacred jungle of my ancestors. Come on. The beast can't travel very far. She must be dead by now. We'll send you this kitten. I'm sure you will. Yeah. You know, if we take him fishing, he would fall overboard. That sound like Bitsy. Bitsy! Where is he? Where is Bitsy? And Raoul? Eugen, where is Raoul? For God's sake! Raoul! Don't be afraid. Five, four, three, two, one. Hide you or not, here I come. Sangha. I see you Sangha. "We had to rid the village of that blood-thirsty monster, And our change came sooner than expected. We had just set off. One suddenly, there was a movement in the rock. With no time to aim, brought the gun to my shoulder and fired. The bullet struck the man-eater full in the chest and it fell to the feet of my track... Shhh.. The peace rolled over. Instead of being scream, We stood there silent before the magnificent creature, and then According to custom, I cut open the chest and give the warm streaming heart to my client... Good night, Raoul. Good night, Sangha. Pleasent dreams, my darlings. Kumar, Kumar, eat. He's going to die. You must eat, Kumar. This is good meat. Come on, my boy. It's no use telling him. Make him eat. We spent good money on him. We'd better find the old Chinaman, who stuff that jackal for us. At that size, it would sell well. Hello, Ladies and Gentlemen. What are we waiting for? The great Zerbino Circus is proud to present to its audience, with the savage killer... Out there you lazy old lump. Time to go to work. Move. He's an embarrassment for the show. We should get rid of him. But who would buy him? At his age, he's not worth a cent! Let's go! Move. Get ready. I give you bloody Caesar. You are a ferocious beast. So why try one! So how are you enjoying your extended stay? Very much. I heard you are keeping your ship standing. Does this mean we can hope you to stay longer in our beautiful colony? Or if you have plenty to do. Someone said you were asking about the river region. Of course, there's wonderful temples there. But I must warn you. Sergent Van Tranh is getting very hostile? I can't be present for him. I wonder if it would make it easier for you, if you have some sorts of feature hat to wear. Special adviser for hunting. How does it sound? Rather long. What might that involve, do you think? Nothing much. You could organize the tiger hunt whenever I have important visitors. Very kind of you. How on earth can I thank you this time? I need the skin of the tigers. His Excellency would be very difficult to buy the road again. It's because he lost faith during the hunt. And how do you suppose we present him the skin when the live tiger is still inside it. You are the hunter. Figure it out. I have an appointment with His Excellency next Tuesday. I can't go empty handed. I'll lose my road. Don't be ridiculous. That's impossible. Oh, You can do it. Otherwise, I may not be able to restrain Sergeant. He says you have acquired an accomplice. Some local. You rang, Madame. Sangha! Hello? Hey, I know you. So this is where they brought you, uh? Well, it's not so bad. At least you got company. Don't you look at me like that. What was I supposed to do with you? I couldn't have left you out there, could I? You never learned to hunt. You would starve to death. It's a pity to get eaten right away. You get a long memory. I know what you want. Ah, ah, ah! I wouldn't do that if I were you. Even at that age, they can take your finger off. Tell me, Have you kept the skins of your animals after they are dead. Sometime. Wouldn't have had a tiger hide by any chance? We can get you a tiger skin. Good. Can I see it? When do you need it? Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Then you can see it tomorrow. 1000 Piasters. Payable in advance. I don't want it finished in gold leaves. That's the price. It's up to you. Do you want the skin or not? If you do, 1000 Piasters. If you don't, get lost. All right. Spend some on this little one, won't you? Eating well. Happens to be a friend of mine. Hey, come on. What do you cry about? You've been promoted. You shouldn't be sad. You were right not to leave that little tiger in the jungle. It would have grown up to a man-eater. I suppose. You are a hunter. You protect people from wild animals. You're supposed to kill them, not to pity them. It's exactly what I used to think. For me, hunting is a novel occupation. Well, I think it's also a novel occupation to share treasures to countries where people don't know anything about them. Wouldn't you agree? My father agrees, if you give him money. Nobody sees the statues here. You just left them decay in the jungle. The jungle is their home. This is where they live. So is where tigers lives, but you don't mind hunting them. Do you remember the young man who give you this? The one who lost his leg to a tiger? He's my brother. May I please, Your Excellency, But your father always prefers to show the death wound in the photograph. I am not my father. So, where is the hole? Here. Isn't that amazing? Absolutely amazing. And very meticulous on their part. Unfortunately the animal I shot was hit in the other ear. So gentlemen, the sacred statues will no longer need to leave their temples and migrate to Paris. Why? Because Paris.... Would you mind holding it? Sangha. Bitsy. Help. I want him out of my house. But mom, he's mine. Get him out of here. Don't sell him! Mom, I need him. Stop. No! Sangha! Don't go! He has a taste for blood now. We can't keep him. Raoul, calm down. Ok, it's over. Sangha! I am in charge of the Palace. It's a gift for His Excellency, in the name of France. Come. Is he really a savager as the Administrator said? You would ask if you see what he did to that dog. He almost killed him. Excellent! It will fit in well with our collection. Come! Come on, big boy! Come on! Come on, Kumar. You can do it. It's easy. You won't be hurt. You will go right through it. You will be all right. You will see. Just jump. One little jump. Kumar, trust me. Come on. Jump! Jump! I say jump, not beg. You stupid animal! Come on. It's time to try something different. How dare you! Back, back. Come on everybody. Everybody in here. Use the rope to bind him. Now we are going to teach you some manners. Now you jump. Go. See. That wasn't so hard. That's how you break a tiger. Is this tiger really ferocious? Why don't you test it if you have a spare arm or leg? Here's the key to his case. My master is mounting a festival. It is to be organized exactly as it was in the time of his late father. Have you heard of these ceremonies? Of course. What animal would he be against? A savage one. We have the best fighting beast we've ever own in captivity. We want an opponent that is worthy of him. A special beast means a special price. 5000 Piasters. He'd better be worth it. He is. Let us know when to stop feeding him. Are they real? Of course. Everything about my father was real. It rather overdone for modern taste. Your father was crazy. It was a tradition. Nothing was too expensive or beautiful for those he loved. Was he born ferocious? He was a very shy animal when he arrived here. Full of fears. So was fear that make them into killers. Why did they call him Sangha? The Administrator's child named him. Leave me. Your Excellency. He's very dangerous. Leave me. Do you remember your father, Sangha? Was he a great lord of the jungle? Mine was. Did all the other creature shrink in his shadow? That's how was with mine. Was yours disappointed in his son? No. Perhaps yours was not. So you too think one must be cruel in this world. That one must be cruel to gain respect. We've got him. He's promised to sign it at the end of the ceremony. Once his name is on the dotted line... If I faint with the first sight of blood, don't say I didn't warn you. If I were you, I would get used to it. Because if I am appointed, as we hope, Remember there has a bullfight every something. It could happen. It could be my tiger. Think about it. It's possible. Raoul, stop it. It won't be your tiger. You wait here for me. Blood hell. These years, isn't it? I am so sorry. How did you recognized me? I am the one who's changed. Looking for another tiger skin? That one is not for sale. No. But it soon will be. You know His Excellency's tiger is a wild beast. He, on the other hand, is a poodle. He's been trained to sit up and beg. So he'll be torn to pieces. How dare you lecture us? Who would you think you are? So one tiger will die. But every penny we earned from it will be spent on keeping the rest of our animals alive. I asked you to take care of him. Not sending him to the slaughter. You are the hunter, not us. You are the one who get rich by killing. Give us the key. I'll buy him from you.I am asking for whatever they pay for him. You could have avoided it. The key. Come on. Boys! Give us the key. I'm finished here. Let's go. Sangha. It's him. Mama, It's Sangha. It's him. How could it be? I am sure. You know very well he's in the zoo. The zoo in Bangkok. Whatever. He's a thousand miles away. Move, Kumar. It's time to go to work. You are a ferocious beast. So act like one. God come with you, my brother. Go on. Go. Kumar. Get some stones. Stop them playing. Get them scared! Get them angry! Come on Kumar! Fight! Fight! Kumar! What's the matter with you? What do you think you are doing? The gun! Give me the gun! The door! Closing that gate! Take him away. Go! Sangha, Run! Oh, thank God. I was not sure you are to come. No until I was thinking selfishly. Thank you. Where are they? Not far. My soldiers took a shot at them at the temples. But they got away. We had to tell him that we give him tiger to His Excellency. He didn't take it very well. I don't suppose you'll speak to him. You see that old man over there, leaning on his cane, That woman with her child? What would you say if you find out that you tiger torn one of their legs or killed one of them? Sangha never eat anyone. No, but he will. It won't be long. If he wanted to, he would've already done it. He never learned to hunt. He's not afraid of people. So when he gets hungry, he will get the easiest prey he can find. Like the women in fields or the children. You see, all great predators who escape from captivity become man-eaters when they return to the wild. They can't avoid it. It's instinct. But they aren't all like that. I know they are not. No, you hope they are not. That's only because you love Sangha. And you don't love Kumar? Of course I do. More than you know. So don't kill them. Please! I'm the one who took Kumar from the jungle. I'm also the one who let you keep Sangha. So this whole mess is my fault. If I don't do it, somebody will. But I swear to you, after this is all over, I will never touch a rifle again. It's a promise. I will leave the tigers and the statues in peace. I'll go back to my country. I'll marry the woman I love and I'll stick to writing books. Then go to write books now. I can't. Sangha isn't a killer. Nor is Kumar. They'll stay in the jungle. They'll learn to hunt. But who will teach them? "Your Excellency, I am sorry to learn that my government has decided to abandon the temple road project. Just at this moment, when I can promise you that the two animals responsible for all these disturbance, are being killed. Raoul? Raoul? Where are you? Raoul is gone. Raoul! Sangha! Where are you? Sangha, come out! Sangha! Sangha? It's me, Raoul. I knew you'll recognize me. You must never come back to the villages of man. Promise me, You must stay in the jungle forever. Forgive me. Forgive me. Did you hear that? Another tiger is answering them. Now who out here would know them, do you think? Whoever it is, could he maybe teach them to hunt? Let's hope so. We're taking a big chance here. I know. But that's good, isn't it? To take a change sometimes? Yeah. Sometimes it is good. Today it feels very good indeed. THE END
