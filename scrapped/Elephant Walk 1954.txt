I don't think authors should write unhappy endings after all we've been through. What with the air raids and buzz bombs and things. Now let me see. Just a quick look. I knew it. She dies. Take it, dear. Much as I'd love it, I just couldn't. What about these two? Do you think they're all right? Have you read this one? Hello. I'm sorry. Am I too early? I mean, too late to... I'd like to change a book. If you try to be quick in deciding. We're actually closed. I won't be a minute. Lovely day. That's John Wiley. He's a tea planter from Ceylon. He's been visiting his cousins, the Mortimer Wileys. The Manor House. Oh, really? They say he's been here looking for a wife to take back with him. He didn't find her. So he's going back alone next week. What civilized girl would want to live in a jungle? Imagine. Snakes and tigers and things. I'll take these. - Did you find something? - Yes, actually. Poisonous Reptiles of Ceylon. - Good night, dear. - Good night. Are you really John Wiley from Ceylon? Are you really Ruth Lacker of Shillingworth-On-Thames? Yes, I am! By the way, Mr. John Wiley... the Shillingworth lending library does not carry books on snakes. Don't they? I'm sorry, it was the only way to get rid of that one hissing in your ear. By the way, I've got something for you. Look, our honeymoon tickets. Two weeks in Paris, two days in Cairo, Bombay if we want to... and then home to Elephant Walk. Darling, to really see all those wonderful places. Only two weeks ago, I didn't know such a person as John Wiley. Ruth, are you quite sure this isn't all a little too fast for you? No, I knew it. I knew I could love you the minute I first saw you. Darling. But, Mother, you must admit he is wonderful. He seems a nice young man, but we know so little about him. At such short notice, what will people think? I don't care what people think. I just know I love him. I shall pray for your happiness. - Good night, darling. - Good night. It's just that you're going so far from everything here. I know, Mums. - Welcome, master. Welcome, mistress. - Hello, Tomas. John, a Rolls! Yes. It's about 15 years old, I'm afraid. It belonged to my father. Or the Governor, as they called him. It's brand-new to me. Sit back, darling. We have an all-day's drive. - Well, do you like it? - You should've told me it was so beautiful. I didn't want to paint any pictures. You wanted to be loved for yourself alone? Are those tea fields? No, darling. Tea doesn't grow underwater. It grows on bushes, high up in the mountains, as high as possible. Those are rice paddies. I always thought tea grew in yellow tins. Welcome, master, welcome. - Welcome. - Hello, James. Hello, Rong. John, I can't believe this! They wanted to impress you. This is all in your honor. A champagne lunch in the middle of the jungle. What am I getting into? Deeper into my heart. A pretty speech. Hello, we better start. We've got guests. What's that building? That's my factory, where we process the tea. Are we on your plantation now? Our plantation, darling. We've been on it for about half an hour. Half an hour? That's miles! Yes, it is a few. That's that lop-eared old bull again. - I'll take a picture. - No, stay where you are. - Is he dangerous? - Be quiet, Ruth. Tomas, let's give him a noise he understands. I'm certainly glad he did understand. John? It should have been done long ago. The trouble is, you have to get government permission. - To do what? - To kill one of their precious beasts. - Then they are dangerous. - That particular one, yes. Dangerous and destructive. There you are, darling. Elephant Walk Bungalow. - Welcome, master. - Welcome, mistress. Welcome, master. - Welcome, master. - Hello, Appuhamy. Ruth, this is Appuhamy. He was with the Governor long before I was born. - He runs the place. - Welcome, mistress. Let's have the customary ceremony about this. I can't believe it! I've never seen anything like this! - If this is a bungalow... - They call everything out here a bungalow. I'm sorry if it's a little small. Then I did marry a millionaire. I'm afraid so. What are you going to do about it? I should have known when you bought me all those beautiful clothes in Paris. What a beautiful view! That's the Elephant Walk, where the place got its name. Before the Governor built here... the elephants used to come down that track for centuries, to get to the water. They don't still try to come through, do they? Elephants always remember. In the Governor's time, a couple of them were killed in the argument. Perhaps it's revenge. Don't worry, darling. That wall keeps them out. They try it from time to time, just out of stubbornness. Led by that big bull we saw? - Why did you say that? - I don't know. It's just that he looks so fierce. And he made you look fierce. Why did your father choose this particular spot to build on? He liked it. - It was a big risk, wasn't it? - He liked risks. - What's that, John? - Come on, darling. What is it? That's his grave. You mean your father's buried right here? Why not? That's where he wanted it, and he always got his way. - Come on, darling. You must be tired. - Am I asking too many questions? Inquiring little head... you ask as many questions as you like. But not now, later. Come on. Master, Mr. Carver requests your presence in the factory. All right, Appuhamy. Appuhamy, tell the groom boys to have my horse at the door. Yes, master. Carver's my assistant. He's a nice chap. You'll meet him tonight. Is there going to be a party? No, just the usual Saturday night crowd. Friends and neighbors. - Here you are. I hope you like it. - It's beautiful. The Governor built it as a bridal chamber before he went to England to meet Mother. - Before he met her? - Yes. He thought it was time to have an heir, so he went to England to find a wife. He must have expected a very large wife. The horse is saddled, master. - Do you mind if I go down to the factory? - I may get lost. I'll find you again. Appuhamy looks after you from now on. Is there anything mistress wishes? No, nothing. Thank you, Appuhamy. I hope you will be very happy at Elephant Walk, mistress. Thank you. That's a beautiful comb you're wearing. It is the comb of caste, mistress. It is to signify that those who wear it are not bearers. I have a great deal to learn, Appuhamy. Will you help me? Appuhamy? Mistress? Mr. Wiley's mother, is she buried there also? In England, mistress. She did not like it here. Master. Darling, you look very beautiful. Chaps, this is my wife. - Gordon Gregory. - How do you do? - Charles MacDougal. - John Ralphs. - James Strawson. - John Longworth. - Charles Beresford. - Peter Ainsworth. - Robbie Norbet. - Bobbie Chisholm. - Sit down, darling. - So sorry we didn't have time to change. I've so been looking forward to meeting all of you. I was rather nervous of this meeting, but none of you seem very frightening. Wait till you know them better. - Where's everybody else? - Who else, darling? The wives, of course. These blighters married? Hardly. Look at them. We're not all as fortunate as John. As a matter of fact, I haven't seen a white woman around this district since... When was the last time the Judge's wife was here? Two years, anyhow. Don't worry, darling. You'll never be lonely here. No. Elephant Walk is like a hotel, Mrs. Wiley. Why, it's better than living in a club... so don't you go thinking there's no social activity. - There's more social activity that goes on... - All right, Peter. I was only trying to welcome a new member. Thank you very much. It's the finest club in the world, founded by John's father... old Tom Wiley, the Governor. God bless him. I'd like to hear more about the Governor. He was the biggest-hearted man that ever trod this earth. All his good fortune he shared with his friends. You could talk for a month and never come to the end of the stories... about the Governor. He was a legend. He's been dead for many years, Mrs. Wiley, but that's a legend, too. The truth is he's much more alive today than ever he was. Let's drink to the Governor! - To the Governor! - To the Governor! Let's go in to dinner. It's no use waiting for Carver. He's always late. - You've met Dick Carver? - No, I haven't. Not a bad type. A bit unsociable. Not one of us, eh, John? He works, which is more than you do. With him on the job, I can retire. You? Retire? Never. Not until you're lying out there beside your Governor. - That chair's been vacant far too long. - Yes. - How did you find things in England, John? - A bit battered, very rationed. I hope they ease up on their wartime restrictions soon. But, darling, things really have eased quite a lot. I can't imagine what they were like before. Then I shan't put a blight on this wonderful dinner by telling you. Good evening, everybody. I'm sorry I'm late, John. Dick, this is my wife. Dick Carver, Ruth. Well, hello. If I had known, I would have had the flags out. If you'd known what, old man? All I can say now is welcome. Or is that just another echo? - If it is, it's nice to hear again. - I'll drink to you. We've already done that, but we can do it again. Mrs. Wiley, here's to your happiness here at... That's that lop-eared old bull again. I saw him around. Carver, would you... No, never mind, I'll do it myself. There's only one answer to that beast: kill him. Yeah, he's a real troublemaker. He's got a persistence that isn't healthy. - Persistence? - Yeah. He wants their trail back. The old watering trail down to the river. John showed me the trail, back of the house. Back of the house? We're sitting on it. This house is built plumb across it, across the Elephant Walk. It's not really as bad as it sounds. Those elephants only come to the wall. There are always men patrolling to keep them out. - But the servants, they ran away. - You'll get used to that. You see, Mrs. Wiley, they think that elephants are people. The elephant people, they call them. And their road was taken from them, their right of way? Carver, I want that patrol around the house increased. Check. Ruth, the right of way was the Governor's. Nothing was taken away from the elephants. Well done! One more for $500? Good shot, man! Excellent. Good shot! Nice shot. Darling, you watch this. All right. Please don't stop. You like it? It's Chopin. Yes, I know. We even have Chopin in Shillingworth. Touch. Is that where you're from, Shillingworth? It can't be just plain Shillingworth. Must be Shillingworth-on-the something or other. - On the Thames. - Where else? - I played! - Wait a minute. Wait. It's a strange country, isn't it? Any country's strange... to a stranger. Thank you for that. - Enough of that. - Please, must you stop? It's getting late. According to the men, the evening's just beginning. That's when I steal away to Carver Castle. It's a little different in size from this. They warned me you were unsociable. Are you really? In your case, it would be for a different reason. Pardon me for staring at you. But it's a new experience to see someone like you around here. A dress as pretty as that, smelling of Paris. Look at that! - Tell me about the elephants. - Are we changing the subject? I would like to know more about Ceylon. Those elephants have been making trouble for 40 years... and they'll go on making trouble for another 40. They must resent this house a lot. - Wouldn't you if you were an elephant? - Yes. I wonder why he did it. Why he built across their trail, why he insisted on his grave being there. Tom Wiley was Tom Wiley. That doesn't tell me very much. He was the best tea planter in Ceylon or anywhere else. But they talk about him as if he'd been a king. He was a king, in his way. But what kind of a man beneath it all? Hard, stubborn. Too stubborn even to die. Don't get your impressions of Tom Wiley from me. I'm not a disciple like the rest of them. Yes, I know. That's why I asked. Can I give you some friendly advice? Get Tom Wiley out of your mind, keep him out. Let the others hang on to their myths if they want to. Just remember that grave out there is a colossal piece of vanity, nothing else. He's very dead. - Good night. - Good night. When I wished you happiness this evening, I really meant it. I mean it even more now. I hope you're very happy. Thank you. Please come see us often. Didn't John tell you? I'm leaving Elephant Walk. - You're leaving? - Yes. I should've gone a long time ago. I only stuck around to keep things running while John went to England and found you. I guess I'm the one who should have gone to England. Where are you going? First stop, Paris, to make up for anything I have missed at jolly old Elephant Walk. After that... I wish you luck, Mr. Carver, although I am sorry you're going. I'm almost sorry myself now. Good night, Mrs. Wiley. Good night. ...and old Charlie Mitchell went into the caf and the girl is sitting on his knee! Charlie always was one to be interested in the natives and their problems. I hope you'll all excuse me. I'm awfully tired. - Darling, have I been neglecting you? - No, darling. - Would you mind awfully if I went upstairs? - Not a bit. We'd all understand. Good night. It's been so nice meeting all of you. I hope I see you again soon. - Of course, you will. - There's no need to say goodbye. They're all weekend guests. They've got their special rooms. How nice. I didn't know. Then, good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Did you like them? They're all nice chaps. - Yes. - They're delighted with you. - Are they? - Will you come up soon? - Darling, we both can't leave our guests. I won't be long. Good shot! Right-o. Pass him. - To the Governor. - To the Governor. John! Master, mistress is calling. What's the matter? I heard all the noise, and I was... I got frightened. Frightened of what? You're not a child, Ruth. You wanted to go to bed, go to bed. I don't enjoy being embarrassed in front of my friends. Forgive me. I don't want to hurt you. John, darling. I don't know why I said what I did. I shouldn't have brought you here. Don't say that. I belong with you. John? John? Old master, hear me, I beg you. Your servant, this beginning of a new work day... ...but concerning the new mistress, my thoughts are troubled. ...as was the woman, your honored wife, before her. She is not one of us... and her ways are cold and strange. Appuhamy. Good morning, mistress. Good morning, Appuhamy. Where's Mr. Wiley? The master has left for the workday. At this hour? The workers of Elephant Walk muster every morning at 6:00. As long as I have known... the master of Elephant Walk is always present to give them their orders. Shall I bring you your morning tea now? - Yes, thank you. - Yes, mistress. - Edward. - Yes. - Get as many pluckers as you can. - I'll make it for you, sir. - Remember, we want a record year. - We make, master. I hear you've had a record year yourself. Triplets? Yes, sir. Three big boys. You're quite a boy yourself. We'll go down to the factory. How's your new humidifier working? Fermentation's improved considerably, I think. - You know, you're a good tea maker. - Thanks. - Why don't you stay? - Next boat that hits Colombo, I'll be on it. Pity. I hate changes around Elephant Walk. I wouldn't say that. You've got yourself quite a change at the bungalow now. Ruth? She's no change. She'll fit in. It's a pity she never knew the Governor. She will. - Good morning, mistress. - Good morning. What's this room? Old master's room, mistress. It is always locked, mistress. Ever since old master died. Only Appuhamy goes to clean once in a while. Will you tell me where I can find Appuhamy? In kitchen, mistress. Mistress. Looks like we're feeding the whole of Ceylon. I beg your pardon, mistress? - Who are all of these men cooking for? - The household, mistress. Excuse me, mistress. I've never seen so much food in one place. The estate is remote, mistress. - We must buy in bulk. - Yes, of course. Madeira, Appuhamy? Who drinks Madeira? I know my husband doesn't like it. The old master was very fond of it, mistress. - Appuhamy! - Mistress. About those cigars. My husband doesn't smoke them. - Must we be so wasteful? - They are for his guests, mistress. His regular guests. There was only one man that I saw smoke a cigar on Saturday night. The old master always smoked cigars. Excuse me. Hello. Please don't stop singing. Don't run away. - Whose children are those? - Their parents work in the nearer tea fields. And they're left alone all day? They're quite safe, mistress, and very happy. They seem afraid of me. What they do not understand, they are suspicious of. Appuhamy. - Mistress. - Why are they throwing away all that food? Nothing once cooked at Elephant Walk is ever used again. What shocking waste! Why, that's six months' ration in England. There's no rationing at Elephant Walk, mistress. Nevertheless, I'd still like to cut down on the waste. Perhaps we could work on the menu together. I have just completed the menus for the coming week. Appuhamy. Mistress. I've decided to continue my inspection of the house alone. - May I have the keys? - There's no need for keys, mistress. All doors are open. All but one. May I have the key? I am sorry, mistress. It is the old master's study you refer to. I cannot give you the key to that room. Is there anything else? That will be all. Ruth! Ruth, where are you? Hello, darling. I just got in. - Carver's called in for a farewell drink. - Hello. - Come down and charm us, will you? - I'll try. I've been looking forward to this drink since 3:00. I'm feeling the heat since I got back. That's one thing I won't miss when I leave here: that afternoon sun. Dick, there's a refreshing sight. - That makes a drink almost unnecessary. - Steady now, man, don't go too far. - Letters? Is that what you've been doing? - Just this afternoon. I see. Complaining about me already. "Dear Mother, I married the most dreadful man." Of course! - Drink, darling? - No, thank you. Know why I don't write letters? You write, they answer, you answer their answer... they answer your answer, and so on... Stop teasing and tell me how to post these. Give them to Appuhamy. He's going to Colombo at the end of the week. - I'll be glad to mail them for you. - Yes. Give them to Dick. - Thank you. That's fine. - He's leaving tonight. - Darling, tell us about your day. - There's nothing much to tell, really. - It's just kitchen talk. - We don't mind. I thought you were going to work with Appuhamy. Did you? - Yes, I did. - How did it go? What's the matter, Ruth? Don't you think this is rather boring for Mr. Carver on his last night? Dick? He's practically one of the family. It's pretty late. - I'd better be getting along. - You haven't finished your drink. Now I have. Thanks, John. Thanks for everything. - Same here. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Ruth. - We'll miss you. Don't be nice to him. Tell him he's an idiot to go. I did. There's just the possibility I may be back. I understand you can run out of money pretty fast in Paris. Do it as quickly as you can. - Okay. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - All the luck in the world, Dick. - Thanks. My letters. Dick! I forgot to give you my letters. For a moment, I thought you were going to ask me to stay. Why should I interfere with your life? Maybe you have already. - Goodbye, Dick. - Bye, Ruth. If you should ever need me for anything... you can always get in touch with me at the American Express in Paris. - If I should need you? - That's right. So long. Where is it now? Where is it? Right. Come on. Monkey in the middle? All right. Come on now. Don't ever startle me like that again. Excuse me, mistress. A harmless insect. Please don't kill it. Appuhamy! What is it? What's happened? John! I can't get the bicycle free. - What happened? - He hit the wall. Appuhamy, call the doctor at once. - I'd say a few weeks in bed will do it. - A few weeks? I'm being optimistic. It's a compound fracture. But I can't lie here, I've got a plantation to run! Then you'll run it from your bed. - If I can't trust you, I'll put you in traction. - Traction. I've got a new crop, and the monsoons are due. Unfortunately, the leg must stay there, and you are attached to it. - Very amusing. - John, maybe your friends could help. How? They're all fighting time and the monsoons themselves... and he picks this time to lay me up. - Good night. - You're a quack! If you come in here, I'll have you thrown out! Master, please. He never was a doctor. Few weeks! He'll be a difficult patient. He's his father's son. Did you know John's father? You see this scar? Tom Wiley threw his water carafe at me once when I said he had a temperature. I can believe it. You should get yourself some sleep, young lady. I'll be all right. Don't worry about me. I've given your husband a strong sedative. He'll rest very well. There's no reason why you shouldn't do the same. - I will. I promise. - Good. - I'll be back in the morning. Good night. - Good night. She has brought evil spirits. The master lies hurt. There is sadness in my heart. Since her coming here, I have felt it. She does not belong to Elephant Walk. - How is he, Doctor? - Awake. Very loudly awake. I'm afraid this may take longer than we first expected. Why do you say that? Even broken bones require some cooperation during the mending process... from their owner, that is. If only we could relieve his concern about the plantation. I wish I could help. I wish there was something I could do. Doctors are notoriously pessimistic, Mrs. Wiley. It's possible that just having you around may be all the prescription required. - Goodbye for now, Mrs. Wiley. - Goodbye. Look here. Elephant tracks all over. Here. There. Ruined tea fields all over. They sure did a good job of ruining this field. Hello, Ruth. Hello. The elephants got in here last night and trampled a few hundred young plants. - You can see how much you were needed. - John know I'm back yet? Appuhamy told him first thing this morning. He's very grateful. He should be. I was halfway up the gangplank. - Are you coming up to the house later? - As soon as I get cleared away here. When you speak to John, would you do me a favor? Don't tell him I sent for you. Let him think it was your idea, that you heard about the accident and came. Dick Carver to the rescue? Okay, Ruth. I understand. Thank you, Dick. - I'll see you at the bungalow. - My regards to the patient. - Come on, boys. What's holding us up? - Need more men. Not enough. Get them. - Patrols were on the job, John. - What were they doing? Relax, man. You couldn't check on them from your bed. They've all been alerted. They'll stay that way. What am I, a blasted contortionist? What do we do about the young plants before the monsoons? We put back more than a third this morning. How? We stopped the pickers and put them to planting. You stopped the pickers? It makes sense. Nothing much to pick anyway, till the rains. Everything's drying up. There's been a rule here for 50 years. Pick while there's flush to pick. Weather and elephants don't change it. You put those pickers back to work. Okay, John. You're giving the orders. - What's this? - Your lunch. Cold chicken and fruit salad. The menu said roast pork. I thought it was too heavy for you in this weather. Appuhamy, will you get what's ordered? But, darling, it's not good for you. Having to lie... Ruth, once and for all, will you stop interfering in a household... that's been running smoothly for a number of years. Do you understand? I order you to stop interfering. May I leave now, master? If this is the kind of ideas you have, you ought to have them more often. Playing nurse to John has kept you inside too much. Have you lost your voice? Not really. It's just that... Rather just ride? For a while, yes. Okay. Let's go. Where are we? Polonnaruwa, capital of the ancient kings of Ceylon. Or what's left of it. Pretty impressive, isn't it? This is a very sacred place to all Buddhists. That's the Sleeping Buddha of Polonnaruwa... and his faithful disciple Ananda. It's so beautiful, still. I feel like we're trespassing. They like company. These are fake. I keep the real ones in a vault. They're lovely. Ruth, you remember once I offered to help? - The offer still holds? - Just try me. You're the only one I can try... the only one that doesn't worship at the shrine. Then it's Tom Wiley. I know you told me to try and get him out of my mind... but it's not that easy. He's all around me. The house, the servants, Appuhamy. Sometimes in John. - What made you say that? - Anyone can see it. Old Tom Wiley still rules Elephant Walk, even from his grave. Do you know anything about John's mother? As far as the house is concerned, there's not a trace of her. Not even a picture. It's as if she'd never been to Elephant Walk. All I know is what the natives tell, local gossip. They blame Tom Wiley for her death, say he killed her. - Killed her? - I don't mean out-and-out murder. The doctors in London said if he brought her back to Ceylon... she might die. Tom Wiley insisted his son must be born in Elephant Walk... so he brought her back. The doctors were right. A few days after John was born, she died. - What was she doing in England? - She ran away. I guess she couldn't take Elephant Walk anymore. He brought her back. I'm sorry, Ruth. I didn't mean to upset you. Also, I said it was just local gossip. We'd better get back. Dick. Now you know why I came back. Dick, I love John. I want our marriage to last. Dick! You wait here. Old Lop-Ear and company. It's all right now. They're under control. - Hello, John. - There you are. Don't I get a kiss now that I'm all spruced up? Sit with me for a minute. I was riding this afternoon with Dick Carver. - We ran into elephants... - Yes, I heard them. Just as well Dick was with you. Ruth, forgive me... for barking at you like that. I've missed you. John, I'm tired, and messy. Let me clean up. Yes, of course. You watch this. - Crutches. - Darling, do be careful. The old place looks good. I've missed it. Come on. That wasn't very good. How do you manage these? Darling, don't you think you should sit down? - Yes. Appuhamy. - Master. Sit up. There you are. Darling, how can I ever thank you for all you've done in the past few weeks? I've been spoiled before, but never so beautifully. I haven't finished spoiling you. I have a wonderful idea. What is it? The cruise boat comes into Ceylon on Saturday. Why don't we get on it and go to Gibraltar, then fly back? - I'm sorry, darling. - John, it would be so good for you. It would be good for both of us. I've asked Dr. Pereira already. It's a wonderful idea, but you know I can't leave now. Besides I'd have to put off the surprise I have for you. - Surprise? - Yes. Next weekend. That's why I had to get up and get this leg right. - Tell me what it is. - Not a chance. It's a surprise. - John, what is it? - I told you I had a little surprise for you. Oh, darling. - Where are they from? - Most are professionals from Kandy. The rest are gypsies from the villages. Do you like them? - They're wonderful. Just wonderful. - I'm glad. Hi. - Look who's here. - Carver, late as usual. Good afternoon, everybody. - Drink? - No, thanks. Whiskey, Appuhamy. - And how's Mrs. Wiley? - Very happy. Thank you, Dick. All the troubles of Elephant Walk melted away? I told John about what happened between us. I told him it was my fault, which it was. I say! What do we have here? She is the hit of the show, for obvious reasons. - Do you like her? - She's very exotic. Not your type? No, she's not my type. The way you're getting around these days, John... there doesn't seem to be much sense in my postponing Paris any longer. I'm very grateful to you for pitching in. When are you thinking of leaving? - This week, if it's convenient. - Yes, of course. I'm still in your debt. Leave when you wish. - I'm going to dance. - No, Peter. - Be a good boy or I'm going to strike you. - Be a good boy, come and have a drink. I envy you. You make decisions quickly. I didn't make this decision, Ruth. You did. What's going on now? That's the tea planter's version of St. George and the Dragon... old Tom Wiley holding back the elephants. - And my cue to leave. - Leave? That's right. I've seen it all. Every year since I've been here. This has been going on ever since old master Wiley died. Today happens to be his birthday. Old master left 30,000 rupees... so every year he could be reborn again... in the loyal hearts of his subjects. Nice isn't it? Sort of a black Christmas. But don't let him spoil it for you. They're only getting started. This goes on all night. All is ready, master. - Good. Well, give out the presents. - Yes, master. - Just a minute. Where's Mrs. Wiley? - Mistress went upstairs a short while ago. - Well, I'll get her. You go ahead. - Yes, master. Ruth! Ruth, where are you? Ruth? There you are. I've got your present. From the Governor to you, on his birthday. You be quiet down there. He designed it himself for Mother... to be presented to each new mistress of Elephant Walk. - Do you like it? - It's beautiful, darling. Come on. Let's go down. They'll want to see it. - You go ahead. I'll be down in a moment. - All right. Don't be long. For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow That nobody can deny To the Governor! To the Governor! Why was his horse so beautiful? Why, why, why? Why was his horse so beautiful? We finally drank old Wiley under the table. I never would have thought we could have done it. There's no cause for alarm, mistress. I think it's time we had a little breakfast. Appuhamy! We want breakfast! I think another round won't do us any harm. You're not having another round, nor breakfast, nor anything. - You're getting out of here. - Ruth, lass, what's the trouble? You heard what I said. Go home. But it's the Governor's birthday and his friends of long standing... The Governor's dead, and he's going to stay dead. And you're not friends, not any one of you. You're leeches and scrounges, trying to turn John into something he isn't... trying to make another Tom Wiley out of him, so you can go on getting drunk... in your big free playpen. Well, that's finished. I'm telling you for the last time. This is no longer Tom Wiley's Elephant Walk. This is John's home, and mine. Now get out of here. Very well, Mrs. Wiley. - Good morning, John. - Where are my friends? - I asked them to leave. - Why? Because I don't believe they are your friends. They're a lot of drunks who are trying to take advantage of you. Now, listen... these drunks, as you call them, work harder than dogs all the week. They go for months without taking a drink... and you object to them coming here and relaxing? Please, John. Let's not quarrel. I'm sorry. There's been a tradition in this house... of hospitality for over 50 years, which you see fit to change in a night. I can't talk to you, can I? The man I married in England I could talk to... but you're not that man. - You're Tom Wiley's son. - I see, it's my father's fault, is it? Isn't it? You hate him, don't you? You always have. No, I don't hate him. I only... Say it. I hate what he's doing to you, the way he's ruling you from his grave... making you like him... so he can preserve his house, his traditions, his world. Ruth, stop it! Foolish girl. Foolish and very young. Am I, John? I should never have brought you here. Maybe you're right, because I know something now... something I couldn't have known before. You weren't like this in England. It only happens here. You hate him, John. You won't admit it, but you've always hated him. I'm sorry. I... - Ruth! - Your drink, master. Ruth, come back. What's that? Don't touch. Appuhamy, get Dr. Pereira at once. Ruth! What's happened? I've left Elephant Walk. Have you left Elephant Walk or have you left John? He's won. Tom Wiley's won. - Then John Wiley's a fool. - No. He can't help himself. Or won't. You've got to get me out of here. There's a plane out on Wednesday. Take me to Colombo. I'll wait there. I can't go back. I wouldn't let you go back. I'm not giving you a chance to change your mind. No. - What is it? - Looks like trouble. - What's the matter? - Can't we pass? No. Quarantine. It's cholera. - You'll have to turn back. - Don't worry. We'll get out. - Where are we going? - The bungalow, to see John. You wait here. Even if I let you go, the authorities in Colombo will send you back. Another good reason for staying, we need help. Chunsa's dead. We've got new cases all the time. There're nurses coming up from Colombo. We have to set up an emergency dressing station. Mrs. Wiley, we need all the sheets, tablecloths, all the household linen. They must be sprayed and hung in every passageway, immediately. Appuhamy. Will you come with me? John, Dr. Pereira wants to see you. - Any more deaths? - Two. What are those drums for? Kerosene to burn the infected huts when they become empty. - You haven't slept for two days. - Well? You're killing yourself. I thought you said we had to see the doctor. How are things in the fields, Dick? There's not a leaf of new flush to pick anywhere. Even the weeds won't grow. Irrigation tanks are down to dried mud in all sections. It's no good worrying about tea plants anymore. Keep all labor in their quarters. Pete and Robbie tried to come over, but the authorities wouldn't let them pass. - They wanted to know if they could help. - Help us? Why not? They're my friends. Thank them and tell them to keep away. Did you hear the elephants last night? Yes. They're looking for water, too. Look. Another poor devil. Stop him! Come back! Come back! John! What do you want me to do? Let him get through the barrier? Carver, get that fellow to hospital and take the shot out of his leg. Show him around to the others as an example, if they want to spread panic. That's one way of stopping an epidemic: shoot the people. He had to do it, Dick. If they'd gotten away, they could've spread cholera all over the island. Master. - You wanted to see me, Doctor? - Just a moment. No, darling. - Not Coru's mother? - She's out of her misery, poor woman. Isn't there anything more we can do for them? Make them as comfortable as we can. If they last 36 hours, they usually survive. Make sure everyone disinfects his hands before he leaves the ward. - John. - Yes. I don't like to press you to a decision, but it's getting urgent. - What is it? What can I do? - The burials are piling up. The men are frightened. They won't touch them. John, the bodies must be buried immediately. All right. I'll do it myself. Master. Look, master. Look. No water. Elephant people blame us. We wait for rain. Each day we feel it must come, but the clouds pass. The monsoon has never been so late. There is much sickness and suffering. Soon our Lord Buddha must answer our prayers. Put them over there, Coru, and go over and disinfect your hands and arms. Have there been any more deaths today? Coru, have there been... Coru, come back! Ruth. You shouldn't be lifting things like this. - Where do you want it? - Over there. Coru just ran away. I hope he doesn't try and break the quarantine. I don't blame him. I don't blame any of them. We're running out of water. I know. I checked the main tank this afternoon. It's down next to nothing. I pray. I pray all the time. - A lot of good that will do. - Don't. Ruth, what's the use? What's the good of killing yourself trying to save poor natives... that are going to die anyway? I've just been down at the hospital. Pereira says there have been no new cases today. If that keeps up, they'll lift the quarantine in a couple of days. You can both leave at the end of the week. - By the end of the week, Ruth... - He said "if." If it keeps up. Appuhamy, there's some curry and rice in the pantry. - We might as well eat now. - Yes, mistress. John, you must eat something. - If you won't sleep, you must eat. - I thought the rains were coming today. There was a big thundercloud to the north. Then they disappeared. Mistress has been working very hard these last few days. Won't you rest now? - I will do this. - No, Appuhamy. I'm all right. It's just this heat. - Will it rain? - Yes, mistress. We have all been praying. Keep on praying, Appuhamy. - Are the supplies ready? - Yes, Doctor. - Did you hear the thunder? - Thunder does not always mean rain. In this part of the world, sometimes it thunders for days. Dr. Pereira has some good news, Ruth. Yes. We've just made a tour of the workers' quarters. Not one new case in three days. The quarantine can be lifted. - That's wonderful news. - We'd better hurry. Can you stay? Appuhamy can make some tea and sandwiches. I told John and the men I'd pick them up when they'd finished. Where is John? They're burning the last of the contaminated huts. We'll see you in an hour or so. We can leave tomorrow, Ruth. Not yet, Dick. We shouldn't. Why not? We've done all that could be expected of us. More! We can't leave John alone now. If the rain comes, then, maybe. John's done a good job fighting the epidemic... I'll give him credit for that. But don't fool yourself. Nothing else has changed at all. As long as there's an Elephant Walk, he's still Tom Wiley's son. I have misjudged her, master. Forgive me. I have made much trouble. She is mistress of this house now. She is needed here. It is my earnest prayer she will not leave. - It's over at last, Appuhamy. - Yes, mistress. The time will come when my people will no longer fear inoculation. They will listen to the master and to Dr. Pereira, as I did. They will learn. They are learning fast. Will you make some tea and sandwiches now, please? The men should be back soon. - Will the mistress sleep now? - I think I can. Thank you, Appuhamy. Boy, get out. Go on. Master! Master! Look! Where's Ruth? We just left her at the bungalow. What's the matter? The elephants are headed there. There are no beaters to hold them off. No. You go down to the moat and try to stop them at the wall. I'll get Ruth. You better come along, Doctor. Mistress. - What is it? - There. No. Go back! Go back, elephant people! Go back! Appuhamy! Ruth! John! Oh, John! Looks like I get to Paris one boat late, more or less. - I'm sorry, darling. - I'm not. Let them have their Elephant Walk. Ruth, we'll build a new place, a home somewhere else.
