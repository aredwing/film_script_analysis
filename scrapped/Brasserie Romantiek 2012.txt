A full house. Kevin? Uh, sweetheart... - Here. For Valentine's Day. - Thank you, Angelo. I still don't understand why we're a man short this evening. Don't start! We'll only have half the number of covers, we'll be fine. Yeah, but it's a four-course menu plus an appetizer. - We could've done it differently. - You can't have four at a table. No, true, but you could have charged more. - Hello. - Hello, Emma. How was school? Boring. - And I'm hungry. - 10 euros more per menu? I heard you the first time. Give your dad a kiss. - Dad. - Oh, so I do get one. But love costs money, Pascaline! We'll put the prices up when we've got a second hat. A second hat... I need a bigger kitchen for that, more staff... A bigger restaurant, in fact. Where's Lesley? He should be here by now. Hey, Dad, can't you just do me a steak? With fried potatoes and not too many vegetables. Yeah... Emma. Oops, sorry. Shouldn't we look for somewhere bigger? An apartment with two bedrooms, maybe? I looked on the internet and found one near here. Emma, you're supposed to be going back to your mother's soon. - Have you called her today? - Yes. But she didn't have time, she had to give the twin their bottle. Give that here. I reckon she's really glad I'm not there. You just think that, Emma. Now she can concentrate on the two crying brats and her boyfriend. But it'd be brilliant. Auntie Sis. You and me in an apartment. I don't know. - I'm not in your way, am I? - No, of course not, sweetheart. Come on, let's go downstairs. Lesley? Emma, don't do that. Here. Hi, Chef. Well well, it's our student from Ghent. Wow, you look nice. - Fantastic. - Thanks. It's Valentine's Day, eh? - Emma. Hi, Kev. - Hi, Ingrid. - Hello, Pascaline. - Chef. How do you want your steak cooked, miss? Rare, extra rare? Well done, Dad. Ah, Ingrid. Our professional waiter is 15 minutes late again. - I always allow for that. - It happens almost every day. - I'm fed up with it, he's unreliable. - Calm down. - He's never on time. - You know what he's like. He'll be here in a couple of minutes. This evening after the dessert, that's it, he's fired. You'll have forgotten all about it in a minute. Hello, Pascaline. Hello. Frank. - I've got a reservation. - Have you? - In what name? - Janssens. - With an S at the end. - Janssens. - Two people? - No, just me. I wanted to surprise you. If I'm allowed to come in, that is. It's only for couples this evening, Frank. How about if you eat with me then? What d'you reckon? This is my restaurant, I have to work. It's changed a lot. It seems a bit smaller maybe, but smarter. - A real restaurant. - Thank you. We kept the name Brasserie. Is that your brother? What was his name? What are you doing here? I wanted to see you. And try the delicious food too. I see you've got a chef's hat in the Gault Millau guide. Well done. - I don't bite, Pascaline. - No... Follow me. Thank you. We only have a set menu, with accompanying wine, there isn't anything la carte and... the aperitif is included. A Love Bug aperitif... LOVE BUG APERITIF CHAMPAGNE WITH ROSE GRAPPA LIQUEUR There you are. - Can't we have an aperitif together? - Sorry, I've got guests. - Ah, good evening. Hello, Roos. - Hello, Pascaline. - You're looking good. That's nice. - Thank you. I'm not very fond of Valentine's Evening. Sorry, what am I saying? - I don't want to spoil your evening. - You won't. I wouldn't want a different car. I wouldn't want to drive anything else. No. The colour's not a problem. Yes. And you've got an option on it until tomorrow, so take your time. - We've got the best table. - Yes. Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. You can phone me whenever you like. OK. Yes. You too. Bye. - Sorry. - Yeah. Darling... I got you something... Here you are. - Can I guess? - Of course. Chanel n5. - How did you know? - You gave me that last year too. - I didn't... - You did. Did you know it was the only thing Marilyn Monroe wore in bed? You told me that last year too. - I didn't... - You did. - Thank you. - You're welcome. There you are. Tables 3 and 7, three covers. It's only for the sauce, Sis, don't worry. Still no Lesley? - Who's that? Is he on his own? - Yes. - Janssens. Dammit. - Be polite to him. - He may be from Gault Millau. - He's not from Gault Millau. You don't know that. Watch out or it'll be your fault we don't get a second hat. I'm telling you, Angelo, he's not from Gault Millau, dammit. - Hey, Sis, sorry. - Concentrate on your tartare. Chef. - Everything OK, workmates? - Lesley. I'm here now, so we can start, eh Chef? Hey, guys, it's Valentine's Day. A steak for the young lady. Quarter to seven, Lesley, that's half an hour. Where have you been? - Sorry. My moped wouldn't start. - It was a rhetorical question. - That means you didn't have to answer it. - OK, but... - My moped wouldn't start. - Get ready, then serve the aperitif. There are two tables. We'll have a chat later. OK. Is it like that again this evening? Dad. This steak isn't well done. That's how I serve it, Emma. - There. - Thanks. - There you are. - Thanks. Walter, what a surprise! I didn't know you celebrated Valentine's Day. We have salmon tartare with apple and kohlrabi. There. Has the tiger been allowed out again, pal? I'll be right with you. So tell me, Walter, who's the lucky lady this evening? Her name's Sylvia. We arranged to meet at a quarter to seven. She's a bit late, eh? - She's coming by public transport. - That's always risky, eh Walter? - Where did you meet her? - On the computer, it's our first date. - Wow. Walter! - We've never met before. - She always signs with a capital S. - That may be S for sensual. - D'you think so? - Or for soupspoon. - Good evening. - De Keyzer. I made a reservation for two but I'm on my own. No problem. Come with me. - You reserved this table? - Yes. Shall I take your coat? Thank you. Good evening, madam. I sat on the other side. OK. - An aperitif when your date gets here? - He cancelled. He shouldn't have. Leave me alone. - Vervaeke. - Follow me. Good God, look who it is. - Good evening, Mr Vervaeke. - Don't stand up. Good evening, madam. Vervaeke. From the firm of that name. He switched his whole fleet to me. Wow, it's really smart! - Pleased? - Yes. - Good evening, um... Van Groothuizen. - Table 6. - Five tables, eight covers. - Got it! - Ingrid? - Yes? It's Valentine's Day, eh? - Yes, so? - Uh... I... I just wondered whether you fancied... - Kevin, how's that sauce doing? Come on. - Yes, Chef. Well, Emma? How's the steak? There you are. - Good evening. - Good evening. Claessens. - Table 9. - Follow me, please. This way. What are you doing here, Mr Janssens? I know, I should've come before now. But I couldn't decide whether to come or not and... I'm only in Belgium for a few days. For my father's funeral. And I'm off again soon. The taxi's picking me up at half past nine. Half past nine? No problem. You'll be able to have dessert. I'll bring the dessert and the coffee together. Are you married? What about you? - I'm going through a trial separation. - A trial separation? But it will become permanent. - And the taxi? - The taxi? - Where's it taking you? - To Zaventem, to the airport, sorry. - I'm flying to Buenos Aires tonight. - Buenos Aires? - That's where we... - Where we wanted to go together. Yes... I work at the Belgian embassy there. - I'm a shuttle diplomat. - That's right up your street. I'm glad you've landed on your feet, Frank. Really, I mean it. It's good to see you again. I'll make sure you catch your flight, the menu is a well planned one. Come to Buenos Aires with me. Pascaline? Vandevelde, which table? - Um... 1. - Right. This table, gentlemen. I know I'm springing it on you. You've made a life for yourself here. You've turned your father's brasserie into your own restaurant. I'll understand if you say you can't leave or don't want to leave. Surrounded by everything that makes you happy. But I wanted to ask anyway. You never know... Maybe you're not so... so happy. Maybe you'd like a different life. Lots of people do. Pascaline? - Table 6. - Uh, table 6 is already occupied. Oh, uh, table 11, at the back. Oh dear, I'll have to answer that. - Table 11, please. - Can't we sit here? Mr Clment. Already decided, the XC90? - Table 2 is reserved. - There's no one sitting there. I show you to a table, give you the menu, bring you the food and you pay. Table 11. This table, please. - It's a ridiculous idea, Frank. - Yes, I know. But I'm asking anyway. OYSTER GRATIN WITH SPINACH AND A CHAMPAGNE SAUCE Table 7, elderly couple, vegetables well cooked and the man is allergic to oysters and nuts. Christ! What does he want instead? Table 6 wants the first course without spinach. And table 11 wants sea bass twice as the second course. We said it was a set menu on Valentine's Day, not la carte. Careful, Ingrid, it's hot. - That interrupts my flow. - Chef can't work like this. - Kevin, tray. - Yes, Chef. - Table 2, did you take the reservation? - Yes. - Telephone number? - Sorry, Sis. - How often do I have to tell you to ask? - Yes, I know. - Ingrid? - Yes? - Just now, I wanted to ask... - Kevin. - Yes, Chef? - The gratin won't brown like that. Frank... Buenos Aires. Dammit! Half of the grapes used to make the Ct Pontoise 2006 are from vines that are 25, 30 years old and half are from very young vines found mainly round the Gironde estuary. A fruity finish and a very agreeable wine. - Corked. - Corked? - Sorry, sir, I don't think... - I'm certain. Bring me another bottle. OK. - What does corked mean? - That it tastes of cork. May I smell it? - I've got a good nose for that. - Uh, of course. - It's fine. - Yes, I thought so too. There you are, sir. A new Ct Pontoise 2006. Look at that, darling. Oysters, scallops, pigeon and champagne. All aphrodisiacs... - I'll end up feeling really horny. - Hold on, I've got something for you. - Here you are. - Oh, thank you, honey. - I'll put them on for you later! - Promise? Excuse me, could you be a bit more discreet? - Get a life, woman! - Shhh, sweetheart. Yes! Sold. The biggest one. He was still hesitating. I managed to persuade him. Well done, darling. I've earned my evening, haven't I? I suppose you'll want sex later too? - Table 11 has rejected two bottles. - Bloody hell, which one? - The Haut-Mdoc. He says they're corked. - Corked! Corked, my arse. Another old goat with some young thing. - There's nothing wrong with it. - Exactly. - Ingrid. - Yes, Chef? Didn't we open a Paulliac yesterday? - How old is the young thing? - About 25. - And? A good-looker? - Well endowed. - Chef. - Thanks, Ingrid. - Emma, give me that funnel down there. - Chef. Thanks. There. Here we go. - What are you doing? - Nothing, it's for on Facebook. - No, it's not for on Facebook! - Pascaline... - But it's really funny, Dad. - It isn't funny at all. You were right, sir. I apologise. The Chef would like to offer you this Paulliac 2008 for the same price. He's already tried it himself and says it's excellent. - Indeed. Excellent. - Thank you. Walter? - Yes? - I'm Sylvia. - You... You are Sylvia? - Yes. - May I sit down? - Um, yes. Yes. Thank you. - Excuse me, I... - It's nice here. - Yes... Yes, I often come here. - Do you? - With other women? - No, at lunchtime. Lunch costs 19 euros. Soup, main course and coffee. Without coffee. Coffee... Coffee is... is extra. - That's interesting. - Yes... Excuse me a moment. Here you are. There you go. The first course this evening is oyster gratin with spinach and a champagne sauce. Enjoy it. May I ask you something? I... I don't want to be rude or anything, but... Did you lose someone recently, because... Because you're dressed all in black, I thought... Yes, my husband. - Cancer? - No. Tanya. - Tanya? - My best friend. At least, she was. The number of bloody times I saved her arse and what do I get in return? She steals my guy. Fuckin' bitch. That's... You hear that a lot lately... a best friend who goes behind your back and... Shit! Very nice. But rich. Have you eaten all that cheese sauce? What's the matter with her? Maybe she's not having a good day today. I reckon... I reckon she needs a major service. You can see that, of course. - You've got an eighth sense. - Of course. Why don't you tell her? How's that for an idea? 'I can see you need a major service and I'm a mechanic. ' - I was only joking, Roos. - Go on, tell her. Pascaline! - What are you doing, Roos? - Don't be so modest. Your body, your muscles. Then you didn't spend hours at the gym for nothing. - Yes? - Yes... Go on. - Well, that was... - Apparently you need... - That green was spinach, wasn't it? - Yes. I told my wife that spinach was green. Very nice. It really was. - Very nice. My compliments to the chef. - I'll tell him. Why did you do that? - What's the matter, Roos? - Nothing. - Tell me. - Nothing, nothing. We've got time to talk now. - How are the kids? - Paul, I'm with them day in, day out. If there's one thing I don't want to talk about this evening, it's the kids. Yesterday... Or your work either. - Compliments to the chef. - Who from? - Roos's Paul. - Mr Volvo? That's a first! Kevin, can you do me six rolls, please? Hey, Auntie Sis. Who's your fan at table 7? - The guy from Gault Millau? - He's not. It's Frank. - Frank? - You know. Frank. Frank... Who's Frank? Bloody hell, now I recognise him. Frank the student? - Was his surname Janssens? - No, he wanted to surprise me. Frankie. Wow, he's got old! - Who's Frank? - Frank was the local Casanova. And your auntie was crazy about him. - Besotted. Admit it. - That'll do, Angelo. They were out on the town together every night. Every night. Yeah, I remember. You standing at the stove and Frank going like this... Stop it, Angelo. Well, well, well, well! What a woman! - Now what? - What? What do I do? What do I talk about? I'm boring. I'm the most boring man in Europe, well, in Western Europe. I know. Let me think... - I'll... I'll talk about my work. - No, not about your work. That won't do the trick, women aren't interested in that. Never mention your work. What should I talk about then? You start... You start with... a joke. A joke always works. It's a good way to relax women. They relax, they laugh, things start moving. Things whiz around, they flow. Start by telling her a joke. 'OK. There is this enormous ejaculation and two sperm... ...leave the rest behind them... 'Hey, hold on a minute, hold on. This is a lot further than during training. How come?' 'Hold on. Let's check where we are. ' 'You could be right. We're still only in the gullet. ' Hey, I've just realised! You're thingy, from the chocolate shop. Mia. - Eh? It's been there a long time. - Yes, it has been there a long time. - It used to belong to my mother. - I knew I was right. I knew how to make chocolates before I could even walk. At the back of the workshop... it's still there... there was a big vat of warm, liquid milk chocolate. And when Mum wasn't looking I'd put my head under the tap, with my mouth wide open, and swallow and swallow for about thirty seconds. My poor mother. If she had known... She died far too young. - My father too. - Really? Cancer? No, murder. My dad used to hit her. Usually at the beginning of summer. Strange, eh? The nice weather started and whack, it all went wrong. She saved up all kinds of pills from the pharmacy for over a year and then put them in a chocolate. - Really? - My dad was dead in under ten seconds. She went to prison, of course. But she said to me: 'Listen carefully, sweetheart. Love, true love, is like life itself. You only get one go at it. ' My wedding... ...was the best day of my life. Life had been miserable up till then, I always fell for the wrong guy. But Yves was Mr Right. He was it. The circle is complete. Let me give you some good advice, Mia. I can call you Mia, can't I? Flush that ring down the toilet, forget Yves and get on with your life. - My vat's been turned off. - How can you say something like that? An attractive woman like you... Excuse me a moment, I have to... - Yes, sir? - No, Pascaline. Pascaline. Table 7... - Yes? - Nothing. Well, it was very nice. That girl in the kitchen. Is she your... your daughter? No, she's my niece. She's living with me. For now. What d'you think about my suggestion? You're too late, Frank. You should have asked me that 23 years ago. But you had other plans. - You went to find yourself in India. - I was... How old was I? So was I. I was young too. And in love. And pregnant. It was a joint decision. It was what you wanted too... Yes, and then you left. The promising student didn't dare marry a waitress with no qualifications. It's true, Frank. You never introduced me to your parents. But now your father's dead, you're here. - It's too late. - I loved you, Pascaline. - And I still love you. - I loved you too. - Well then. So now I'm saying... - D'you think I'm going to rush off with an idiot who left me in the lurch 23 years ago? Why not? You're alone too. - Not so loud. - I'm not, you are. There's obviously no one to keep you here, Pascaline. And I can give you another life, a new life. Preferably together with me. Any more questions about the menu, Mr Janssens? Think about it. - Hey, careful. - Sorry. Sorry. IBERIAN HAM WITH SCALLOPS BUTTERNUT SQUASH, GINGER BISCUIT & PINE NUT CRUMBLE Well, well. Your ex back in our restaurant on Valentine's Day. What a coincidence! - Kevin, where are my rolls? - Shit! Kevin, have you got spinach for brains? What's the matter with you? This Frank... How long ago was it? - Um, 21, 22, 23 years. - Almost a lifetime, eh? - It is a lifetime. - Were you already working here then? Yes. I was a bit older than you when I started working here. You know your auntie never got any qualifications, Emma. Went partying with Frank instead. Partying with Frank! I went out for a drink sometimes. I had to look after you and the brasserie. Partying with Frank! You came in every morning puffy-eyed. But there wasn't anyone to stop you. - I was 19. - Why is he here, anyway? He's come to see me. - He's going back to Buenos Aires tonight. - Buenos Aires, in Spain? Honestly, Emma! Buenos Aires isn't in Spain, it's in thingy... Yeah, it's the middle of summer there now. There are two eggs and they are running really fast and suddenly one says to 'Phew! We should've been there by now. ' And the other one says: 'Yes, during training they said we'd reach the sperm really quickly and... ' - You don't do that professionally, eh? - What do you mean, professionally? Tell jokes. Uh, no, I work for the Ministry of the Flemish Community. No, no, no... - I wasn't going to talk about my work. - Do you work for the Tax Department? No, I work for the Energy and Natural Resources Department. It mainly involves studies, research, files about the condition of the soil. - The condition of the soil? - Yes, Flemish soil. Stones, types of sand, gravel... clay... Oh, so you study stones? Yes, I'm a geologist... The origin of the world can be found in a stone. In it you can read everything about the ice ages, continental drifts, periods of global warming. All the mysteries of the universe can be found in a stone. Wow! You're so passionate, Walter. I hear you talking and all I can think is wow! I have to... - Would you like another roll? - Yes, please. Who is it? No one. - If something's the matter, tell me. - Nothing's the matter, Paul. Honestly, what could be the matter? I've got everything a 44-year-old woman needs. A husband, two healthy children, my own car, half a villa, we go on holiday at least twice a year, once somewhere hot and once skiing. I've got 81 pairs of shoes and a lover, what else could I want? - Some more wine. Madam? - Yes. - There you are. - Thank you. - Sir too? - No, no, no. - Are you serious? - Yes. I counted them last week. - 81 pairs, that's a lot. - No, about the lover. You had me worried for a moment. I almost thought you meant it. - Scared you, eh? - No, you can't have a lover. Although you could have one. An attractive woman like you. Sorry. No, no. - Let me see... - Honestly! Why can't I see it? It's my lover. Roos, tell me that's not true. Roos? Look at me. Look at me. Who is it? - Do I know him? Roos, do I know him? - We're not alone here. - Who is it? - It doesn't matter, Paul. - If I know him, then I'll know who it is. - You don't know him. - Are you sure? - Yes. You haven't slept with him, have you? Stop eating! - When and where did you... - Have it off? Is that what you want to know? Not at home? In our bed? What's he got that I haven't? It must be someone you can talk to. Actually, no, we don't do a lot of talking. Our relationship is mainly physical. He's got a big one. A very big one. What did I ever do to you? I'm sick of you, Paul. Sick to death of you. Hey, have you got a light? Have you got a light? Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. There you go. May I say one more thing? Your vat isn't turned off. Yt just needs refilling, that's all. Come on. You've got your whole life ahead of you. I'm telling you, you should look to the future. For Christ's sake! Don't you ever read the papers? The oceans are dying. Javan tigers are already extinct. Bees are almost extinct. They're prospecting for oil at the North Pole. Half the world has no toilet. What was that about the future? Well, I wouldn't look that far into the future. The world is full of problems. The only way to survive in it is with love. If you haven't got it, you're empty. Yves and I, Pisces and Cancer. Ideal. There was contact. D'you understand? And then he pissed off. I didn't leave the house for weeks. When my friends came round to help, I just kicked them out. But there... This evening is different. This evening... I had to be here. It's seven years ago. I can still see him there, where you're standing, on his knees. Holding his ring in his hand. I had this dress on then too. He thought I looked really nice in it. You do look really nice in that dress. One person a day in Belgium commits suicide after being rejected in love. Oh come on, not one every day. Thank you. OK... - How are we going to persuade her? - What d'you mean, persuade her? It's like in chess, Walter. Always think five moves ahead. - We want to have sex with her. - Uh, hold on, hold on. - So we're going to show her we're a man. - Right... There's an animal inside everyone. A tiger. Inside us too. Repeat after me, Walter. Sylvia. I'm a tiger. - Come on, say it. - No, no, no. - Walter. - Sylvia... I'm a tiger. - With conviction. Come on. - Sylvia, I'm a tiger. Shout it. Come on. With balls. Come on. - Sylvia, I'm a tiger! - There you go. That's the way to do it! - Uh, Ingrid? - Yes? Would you like to come out for a drink with me this evening? After we've finished here. - With you? - Yes. Because... it's Valentine's Day and... well... - Yeah, fine. - OK? OK. Table 5 is absolutely nuts. Not bad. Not too attractive. Too attractive is asking for trouble. - This one is rather 'horoscopic'. - What is her horoscope? Pisces. - Pisces are very passionate. - Really? Pascaline. - I'm taking a three-minute break. - What? Three minutes. We've got three minutes. Talk. Uh, OK, where shall I begin? At the beginning... In the beginning I went from embassy to embassy... Married, but it didn't work out. I think about us in every restaurant I go to. The guy... that let you down 23 years ago... doesn't exist anymore. I've changed. You are going to try a scallop in a minute, you know, Emma. - I'm not. - You are. Oh, sorry. - Broken plates bring good luck. - Do you know what good luck is? Because I don't. Hey, I was only joking. Haven't you got any homework to do? Geography maybe? - What's the matter? - Can't you see you're in the way? Sorry. Take it easy, Sis. What's up? Frank has asked me to go with him, to Buenos Aires. - What did you say? - No, of course. The guy's going through a serious midlife crisis. Angelo... why do you think I'm still here? I'm busy, OK? - Why do think I've never left? - No, no, no. Don't start. Don't start all that again. Not now. Go on, try one of those scallops. All what? Because our mother stood there by that door and told me to take good care of her little angel. Take care of Angelo. Not so much ginger biscuit! Make sure he's in bed by half past nine every evening. I stood there nodding like an idiot. Not so much! You're fucking it up! I asked her what I had to tell Dad when he woke up. - Because our father, your grandfather... - Stop it. - Was lying there drunk on the sofa. - Stop it, Pascaline! 'Tell Dad I'll be back once I've sorted myself out. Right, bye, Plinny. ' 'Don't call me Plinny, I'm 15.' 'Yes, ' she said. 'I know. You're grown up now. ' And walked out the door. 'Take me with you. I don't want to stay here. Take me too. ' OK. Everything's under control. Move it along. - I'm starting to understand Mum. - I haven't got a mum. - Don't even know the colour of her eyes. - Blue. I'll tell you what. If you really want to go to Buenos Aires, then go. Go to Buenos Aires. Piss off. Go on. - You don't understand, Angelo. - What about me? I could've been a chef in a real restaurant. With 20 kitchen staff. But no, I stayed here. Stayed here with you in the brasserie. If you want to be a chef with 20 kitchen staff, you need to stay off the bottle. - And you need empathy too. - What? Empathy? - What's that? - Understanding others' feelings. Appreciating the people round you. The only one without any empathy is you. I stayed here for you. Just for you. No, Angelo. No. I stayed for you. Sylvia... I'm a tiger. I hoped you were. - Did you? - Shall we go? - Can we have the bill, please? - No. Hold on, hold on. Walter, I want you to maul me to pieces, rip my flesh from my bones, gnaw my bones, until there's nothing left. - OK... - And I'm going to do the same to you. - I'm not putting you off, am I? - No, no. Men sometimes become rather unsure of themselves when they're with me. - I hope you won't... - No, no, I won't. Phew! Sorry, but I've known an awful lot of men. Not that I'm proud of it. I don't do it for fun, eh? Meeting a new man every week, getting to know someone, starting another relationship from the beginning, more disappointment. - Especially sexually. - Sexually? Uh... I know what you mean. Can we have the bill, please? D'you know what, Walter? They look at me and see themselves failing. They think of me as a sort of Tour de France. With all those mountains they have to go up and down and don't know if they'll make it to the Champs-Elyses. The Champs-Elyses? One of my exes even took EPO to be able to keep up with me. - That's illegal. - Shut up, Walter. I don't want 70%. I want 110%. Walter, if only you knew how long I've been looking for you. - Are you OK, sir? - Sorry. Sorry. - Still alive? - Yes. That's lucky. Just imagine what you would've missed. - Can we leave now, Walter? - I'm just going to wash my hands. What did he say? Sorry. I don't get it. I don't understand. - We're a couple, aren't we? - No, no, no, Paul. We're an economic unit. I just don't understand. I'm shocked. We've been together for 17 years and I've been as faithful as a dog. Maybe I should call you Blackie then. Do you realise I've had opportunities to..., you know? The hostesses at car shows with necklines that plunged to Australia... some of them really fancied me. I had opportunities too, but I was able to say no. Opportunities? You had the opportunities you wanted but I didn't. You have no right to be shocked. You've always done what you wanted. You thrived in your showroom. But not me. I was at home making sandwiches, organising summer camps, extra tuition... - You're never home. - Don't exaggerate. You're always at some car show selling someone an expensive car. - Who brings in the money? - For heaven's sake! I used to have brains. Talent. You know I did. That's why you fell for me. - Now everything in my head's gone quiet. - That's not true. - You've still got brains. - Of course I have. - I don't mean that. - What then? I know you inside out, I know what you think. You know all about gaskets and carburettors but nothing about a knock in my engine. - What about the Sheychelles? - What? - The Sheychelles. - The Sh... The Seychelles, Paul. You mean 'the discussion'. That was three years ago, nothing's changed. No, no, no, Paul. Paul! There need to be some drastic changes. Our marriage is a prison, pal. It's like fucking Alcatraz! - Everything OK, sir, madam? - Great, great. - No. What is your most expensive wine? - Oh, oh, oh. - Red or white, madam? - Red. - Roos. - Red. - We've got a very good... - Fine. Is it your most expensive one? - Definitely. But with the next course... - Sold. - Sis. - Don't, Angelo. Come here, come here. - This is our life, Sis. - You're interrupting your flow. Brasserie Romantiek is yours and mine. Our life is here. Isn't it? Leave here and you've got nothing. Your life isn't in Buenos thingy, it's here. Eh? - You do realise that? - Yes, I know. Buenos Aires is a dream. Everything will be fine, Sis. Everything will be fine. We're starting the main course, guys. Get going! - Give me a week. - What? Or a month. Give me a month. - A month? - Yes. - Then you'll come back? - Yes, of course. - We can't close for a month. - You don't have to. Lesley can do the till and you can take someone on to serve. I'll call the accountant and arrange everything. I know it's been a while since you had a serious relationship but... - not a month, no. - Angelo... I'm going. Tonight. Have you lost the plot completely? That guy breezes in here after twenty years, looks you in the eye and that's it? D'you mind? I'm not one of your mates! Pascaline, you can't turn our life upside down, just like that. I can, Angelo. I love Frank. I still love him. I'm suffocating here in our restaurant. I want to get away from the place. What about Emma? Surely you're not going to send her back to her mother? She's your daughter, Angelo. Your daughter. I'm leaving. You're leaving? Then I'm going to stop cooking. - Put that apron back on. - You heard me. - Put that apron back on. - The restaurant's full, Chef. - Angelo, please. - First promise me you're not leaving. Promise me. Promise me! - OK. - OK what? - Yes, I promise. Yeah, yeah. - Do we agree? OK then. Go on, get on with it. Angelo? You can kiss my arse! Top, bottom and all the way round! Shit! Fuck! Out the way! Dammit! - What's going on? Has Chef gone? - Yes. - What are we going to do? - I don't know. Has your chef just left? - Guests can't come in here. - It's OK, Lesley. Go into the restaurant and put some music on. Emma, can you help Lesley serve? But put something else on. - You can't, Pascaline. - Ingrid, stop washing up and help Kevin plate up. - Without a chef we can't... - Come on. We are the Romantiek and we've got a chef's hat. Get going! Nice. - May I have the last one? - No! What's going on? Are you playing Russian roulette with your chocolates? You watch too much television. - So I can have it. - No! Waiter. Waiter. - You took your time. - Yes. - Look, this is an excellent... - Fine, pour it out. - Is something up with the chef? - No, of course not. Honestly... - It's good. - Is it? - Where's the main course? - It's on its way, sir. We'll leave that here, OK? Thank you. - Mia. - No. - Listen. - Go away. Look. I've got a theory. - There are 11.007 million Belgians. - So? Half are men. Take away the kids, the pensioners and the gays. That still leaves 3.1 million men. Half aren't married and of those who are, half are unhappily married. - And your point is? - My point, Miss Mia, is that there are 825,000 men walking around out there for you to choose from. If Belgium splits in two, it's only half of that. - OK. But then there will still be... - 412,500, I know. Come on, Mia. You can find yourself another guy just like that. - Don't be so stupid. - I mean it. I'm sure there are more than enough men who will fall for you. OK, fine. Let's take you as an example. If you saw me on my own in a bar, would you want to chat me up? Is that a rhetorical question? It's Valentine's Evening. I'm sitting there all by myself. Would you then think, yeah... that girl could be the one for me? Her and me, strolling along hand in hand? No, no. Hold on. Look. I'm a bachelor. I thought about it and made a conscious choice. - Really? - Yes. All the women I meet want kids. We haven't even had sex and they're waving a pregnancy test at me. Next minute you're in Ikea looking at kids' furniture. Don't worry, Lesley. I don't want kids. And I refuse to go to Ikea out of principle. - Right... - Waiter? - Coming... - You haven't answered my question. - Yes, no, I... - See, I knew it. You'd think, who is that sad loser of a woman? - And you'd be right. - No. That's not true. And I wouldn't. What would you think then? Waiter? I'll be back. What can I do for you, gentlemen? Right. I think we should be pragmatic about this. What are your plans? What'll happen to the kids? To me? - To you? - Yes. Do you want to move in with him? - I don't want to talk about that now. - Well, you started it. I think it's best if you tell the kids tomorrow. After all, you... bloody hell! It's Sam's birthday the day after tomorrow. Do you realise what you're doing? Everything we've built up together over seventeen years you are now flushing down the toilet. D'you remember? A long time ago you took me to the seaside one night. You took me to the beach. I've never seen so many stars. - September 1996. - 1994. - We're talking about other things, Roos. - You talked non-stop, about the stars. And about... I don't know, the structure of space and... - The fact stars' light doesn't exist. - Keep your voice down, Roos. I wasn't really listening to you, Paul. I was just lying in your arms, listening to the sea. It was the most romantic moment of my life. Then we made love in your first Volvo. Yes, and the cops came along and we got an 8,000 franc fine. - That's right. September 1996. - 1994. - 1996. Where did it go, Paul? - Are you going to be sentimental now? You've slept with another guy. The thought disgusts me. PIGEON BREAS CHICORY, RED CABBAGE, OYSTER MUSHROOMS AND PORT SAUCE - They want the main course. - Almost ready. - Can I do anything? - Stay there. I need room for my plates, pans, everything. - Kevin, hot. - OK. - Is it going OK? - Yes. You're doing fine. Try this. It could be a bit spicier. Why don't you stay here? - Stay with me? Come and live here. - I can't. I've got an 8-year-old son there. He lives with his mum half the time and with me the rest. I promised to collect him from school tomorrow. - What's his name? - Miguel. Is this OK, Auntie Sis? Yes, fine. You can help serve the food. Table 3. I'm proud of you, pal. I don't think... I can do it. You're a lonely person, Walter. You're the leftovers, the forgotten sock in the washing machine. - And she is your salvation. - She just wants to... I want to get to know her first, go for a walk together. - No, no, no, no walk. - I want to take it a step at a time. Like when you examine a rock, you scrape it off layer by layer. That woman wants a pneumatic drill. Until you discover something... - Something beautiful. - Don't start. Eh? Don't start. - Yes, but... - Walter. If you do that... Then all our efforts will have been in vain. Again. I think... I just think... What's that? Think sex, Walter. Think sex. Here you are, madam. Here you are. Enjoy it. Tell me, Mia... I'll be right back. - Didn't you want to tell me something? - What? - Wasn't I going to be fired? - Fired? No. No? What's this then? PASCALINE IS GOING TO FIRE YOU - Oh yeah, Lesley, that's true. - Oh, so it is true? I've worked my arse off for you for 3 years. - You're always late, Lesley. - Those five minutes! - It's not five minutes. - That's why I'm being fired? Get on with your work. We'll discuss it later. - I haven't got time. - I'm off after the dessert. Think yourself lucky I'm staying till then. - Here you are. - Thank you. And for you. Enjoy it. - Lesley? - What? - What time do you finish this evening? - Stop it, Mia. - It's not because we're chatting... - No, no, Lesley. I really feel I know you. - What sign of the horoscope are you? - My sign of the horoscope? - You're a Cancerian, eh? - I'm a waiter, OK? And I'm a bachelor. And I've got my own problems, OK? - The bill, please. We don't want dessert. - Right away, sir. How did we get here? In the Volvo. - When did you change? - Stop it. You've had too much to drink. - Oh, it's never your fault. - I haven't done anything. Haven't done anything. You've never done anything. You cut yourself off. You don't react anymore. You're a wall. - You're like a wall at home. - Roos. A wall I bump into every day, that's what you are. - A wall I smash my head against. - Calm down. You disgust me. - Darling, something's going on. - What? That blonde woman... She's choking, or something. So she is... Madam. Madam. Watch out, watch out. Make her bend over. She's choking. Come on, Mia. Again. - Do it again. - Come on, come on. - That's it. That's it. - Again. - Come on, Mia. - Again. - Are you OK? - Sit down. Alright? Get her a chair. Thank you. Thank you. Alright? I hadn't spotted that. Do you... Do you want some water? She's choked on something. Still no bill, thanks to that stupid bitch and her chocolates. God, what an evening! Bloody hell, what are you doing? Have you gone crazy? Shit! You drunk bitch! Roos. Roos! Waiter. The bill. - Yes, I'm coming. - Now. Sylvia. I realise you find me very attractive. In particular sexually. But I'm... I'm looking for something else. I'm looking for... love. Love like in the Beatles' songs. Love that lasts a lifetime. Until I'm 64. Or 94. Love that checks to make sure a sock hasn't been left in the washing machine. - Where has Sylvia gone? - I'm Sylvia. - No, no. - Sorry I'm late but I caught the train from Brussels and there were problems with the engine. No, no, no, there's another Sylvia. Excuse me, there was a woman at my table, wasn't there? - No, there wasn't anyone there. - You were talking to yourself. No, that's not true, I was talking to someone. Excuse me, there was a woman at my table all evening. - I spent all evening... - Calm down, Walter. Calm down. - What's the matter? - Lesley, there was... There was a woman at the table with me all evening, wasn't there? Did you forget to take your pills, Walter? There, it's paid. It'll be fine. Come on. Roos. Stop. Roos, stop, dammit! Lunatic! Roos. Sorry. Maybe I... Maybe you're right. I'm not a wall, Roos. I'm not a wall. Pascaline. What's your answer? - Pascaline... - How can you do this now, Frank? How can you wait 23 years to come back here? And then ask me to turn my life upside down in one evening? Leave all this behind. You can't ask that, Frank. It's ludicrous. It's ridiculous. What did you think? My plane's not leaving yet, I'll go and ask her. I haven't had a single second to think about it, Frank. - I should have come before now. - Maybe. I didn't have a ticket anyway... Uh, I... It's economy, but... Economy is OK. Really? Yes. Oh, Pascaline. Pascaline. Dessert first. The last sorbet quenelles, then they're all ready. That looks good. Great. Well done. Thank you. Oh, look who's here. What? Haven't we left yet? Eh, Frank? Was it nice? Did you enjoy your meal? Was it upmarket enough? Cos we've got a chef's hat. 14l20 Gault Millau. We'll have a second one soon. - Aren't I allowed to talk to your lover? - Angelo! - Did you enjoy it, madam? - Yes, it was delicious, thank you. Walter, say something, pal. Sorry. It's alright. I thought... Your mind was on other things because... I was late, I suppose. Yes, that's what it was. I work as a seamstress. What about you? - You expected someone else, I'd better... - You work as a seamstress? Yes, letting down trousers, taking in skirts, that kind of thing. The trousers you've got on are a bit too short, for example. You know what they call trousers that are too short? They call them swingers! What? That was a joke. Right. Don't laugh if you don't think it's funny. But I do. I do think it's funny. Oh, no! Paul, don't. Bloody hell! All those text messages are from Sam. You haven't got a lover after all. Bloody hell, you really had me going then! Roos. I would never have expected it of you! You should do something with this creativity of yours. Roos. Roos? No, Paul. No. Roos? Roos! I think you should just flush that ring down the toilet. - It's all I have left of him. - Go on, Mia. - I can't. - Yes, you can. No, I really can't. Mia... I'm a Cancerian. What? I'm a Cancerian. 1st July. I want you to stay, Pascaline. Kevin and Ingrid, can you tidy the kitchen up in a minute? - Bloody hell, Sis. - Calm down, you! You're not going to leave me after 20 years for that... for a guy, dammit! Table 11 left without paying but the rest have settled their bill. I've paid everyone except Lesley, but I don't know where he is, and I've taken some money for myself. - Did you hear me? - Stop this, dammit! Being in love is 100,000 volts that shoots through your heart in one go. But then, afterwards, it stops. Afterwards, it's gone. Gone. I think I'm finished here. Why do you think all your relationships end in disaster? Why? Cos you only think of yourself. Just yourself. Because I've never been able to get Frank out of my head, Angelo. Never. - You're not leaving. You're not. - Leave me alone. Chef! Chef, are you OK? Chef, are you OK? Come on. - Sorry, Sis. - Are you hurt? Sorry, Sis. Sorry, Sis. Pascaline. Chef. Come on, come on. Let's get you home. Come on. One, two, three. That's it. Well done. It's OK. Come on. You can have a bit of a sleep. Sit down. - I'll look after Chef. - Ingrid, we were going to go... - Oh, Lesley, can you close up, please? - We're leaving, Pascaline. Sorry, it was delicious. Bye. You are real, aren't you? I think so. Here. Hold on tight. We're a bit late. I'll give you an extra 50 if you get us to the airport in 30 minutes. - A fine is a lot more than that. - 150 then. - I'm sorry. - Pascaline? Go on. Otherwise you'll miss your flight. - It was... extraordinary, thank you. - Goodnight. Auntie Sis? Fancy these people not turning up... Not even phoning to cancel... That's plain bad manners. Everything was ready and waiting for them here. They could have phoned. Sorry. Come on, Emma, let's get on with it. That apartment you saw, where exactly is it? Just round the corner. I'll take a look at it tomorrow.
