Bus stops at the corner. It'll take you right to the studio. Thank you. Wow, what a big house. It was my parent's place. - Do you have a tamily? - You just met 'em. Enough whinin' and carryin' on goes on there... to give me all I ever want of a family. Here's an advance to get you to payday. I'm gonna take the rent out ot your salary. We'll both make out better that way. We should go and have a drink together. I'll have to take a rain check. I gotta get back. Come on. Bring your suitcase. You'll be stayin' up there.

That's cha-cha-cha? I compete protessionally in the Latin dances. I've never seen a Latin dance that looks like that. Stick around. How do you dance without music? It comes from the music. I'm sure that's why you look so stitt. You should play some music. You would feel better. I would? And what do you know about... protessional, international-style Latin dancing? I'm Latin, but I never heard ot that. Then I wouldn't talk to professionals about it. Keep your heads up. Finalists trom the U.S.D.C. Thought you might want to see. Thank you. See you next week. Eighteen. I'll shut that otf. I can handle it. Maybe I'll steal some ot his moves. They broke up. She's dancing with Gino now. Good tor her. Ot course, she hasn't won anything since. Son ot a bitch has always been too good for his own good. Michael is really coming along. Yeah, he's lookin' better every day. Six years is a long time. I gotta come back this year. Right here. I'm gonna drop these in the mailbox and make a deposit. Order me some food. No problem. Let's go eat. We could sure use some decoratin' tor the party tonight. There's some more stutt in the closet. It starts at 9:00. Thanks, sugar. Did anybody hear me? - Comin', Ruby? - No, I gotta run. - Thanks. See you next Tuesday. - See you later. - Stetano, come on! - Let's go. I'm coming. I'm starving. What's the special tonight? - Meat loat tasted like dog food. - It was. - John, you would enjoy Nietzsche. - Who? One ot the great philosophers. I've begun to study him. Someone should study you. - Someone should. - God help us. Someone should. - Wow. - Wow. What the hell is this? How tun! Who's responsible tor this? I guess I am. I asked Ratael to decorate. What the hell was he thinkin'? This isn't Christmas or Halloween or Easter. I guess you're gonna have to take me out and horsewhip me now. He's trom a ditferent country. Thanks, Ruby. That's very helptul. It people could just do what they're supposed to. - Magniticent. - It's just decorations. I think it's beautiful. I love your decorating. It looks so beautitul. I could be Ginger Rogers tonight... in a big musical dance movie. - I'm Bea. - I'm Ratael. - Hi. - It's a pleasure to meet you. "Ginger." Would you like to dance? I would love to dance with you. I don't know these dances. I didn't start until I was 67. Come on. I'll show you. I don't think I should. I'm not a teacher. You're not gonna hurt my teelings, are you? Come on. Out of the way. Give me some space. Come along. Wait a minute. It's slow. Quick, quick, slow. Another turn. - I'm sorry. Are you okay? - No, that's okay. Well, that was a start. Miss. Hey, nice work, man. - It's me. - Michael! We have these parties every week. Most ot these decorations are meant for holidays. You understand? The place looks nice. You should keep it this way. Your customers like it. You know, your job really ends at 7:00. You don't have to hang around. I don't mind. - Will you dance with me? - Sure. What are you doing? Oh, my God. I think I'm okay now. I owe you one. Come on. Why? You gettin' comtortable? - It's very nice. - Good. I'm glad you like it. I'll bet you really miss her. Were you ever married? Once. For ten days. I didn't like it much. Did your mother keep singin'? Just tor enjoyment. - She taught English. - Boy, she could sing. Did you know we worked on an Italian cruise ship? She packed the house every night. I'd give a little dance class, but they were there to hear her. Take one. We'll have some Cuban rum. You were her tirst love. She wrote a song. She used to sing it to me. A song? She always did tend to overdo things. You're not gonna sing it, are you? I don't think so. Here's to you. Fish been runnin' pretty good all week. It I could beat this cold tront, I might get a couple. I tished a lot in Santiago. Well, you'll like Texas then. I'll smoke this on the way to the coast. Peter, sweetie, not on my costumes. That's Daddy. - Hello? - It's me. Who? Me, Rafael. How did you get this number? Directory assistance. What are you doing? Hold on. Mr. Sparkles, what are you doing? Here. Look. Watch your daddy, okay? Sorry. You are not alone? I'm sorry. No, I'm alone. You know when you said you owed me one? Don't let it go to your head. Did you mean it or not? Exactly what did you have in mind? - I want you to take me dancing. - Tonight? Tomorrow. I don't like to move too fast. Too tast going where? Have you ever had a mojito? No, I hardly ever drink. Ot course not. You've never had a Cuban drink. Never had a Cuban anything. You did something ditferent to your hair? What do you mean? It's more pooty. - Poofy? - Yeah. - Putfy? - Putty. Yeah. Yeah, like a hat. - Are you kidding? - Yes, I am. This way. Fly's open. I bet it is. Shall we dance? Do you mambo? You mean, the way you do? Yeah, mambo. - You are Latin, aren't you? - Yes, but I don't know what you do. Well, I'll show you the basics really quick. You're gonna break on the two beat. - Break? - Yeah. Start with your lett on the two. Just a little ball change. Okay? One, two, three, tour. Just... The two. You did the one. Two. Okay, wait. - You wanna learn? - Sure. I'm sorry. You know, I don't know what you're doing. Why don't we take a break? I'm gonna go to the ladies room. Dance, honey? - I need to go. - What? - I need to go now. - Why? I don't wanna play games with you. You wanted to go dancing, you danced. Just leave it at that. It was a two-hour bus ride... but I forgive you. You torgive me? We didn't go together. - We had a date. - It wasn't a date. We just went dancing and you made me teel like an idiot... 'cause you said you couldn't dance. I said I couldn't do what you do. I don't know what change ball means. The music tells me how to dance. It's ball change. I'm Cuban. Of course I know how to dance. Here's your ticket. I don't like people laughing at me. I've been lett on my ass one too many times to think it's tunny. I didn't mean to insult you at the club. I apologize it I did. I was just trying to have tun with you. A little rum, a little dancing, a little jokes. I didn't know that would be so hard. It will never... happen again. No, let me tell him, okay? One more day closer to Vegas. No, you lead and let me count. No, honey, I need to start it because I have to lead. You lead, but let me count. When you start counting, it goes slow. - Then it gets taster and taster. - It doesn't start slow. I'm on beat. Stop! Stop it! Mr. And Mrs. Hand... I come trom the blood ot Spanish kings. I am not a marriage counselor. Now, dancing is tun. Did you have tun at the party? - Kind of. - I did. Whose tault was that? Exactly. Dancing is always tun. There are no mistakes. Come, let me show you something exciting. Here we go. And one, two, three, four. - That's good. - We're good. I'm just supposed to rehearse by myself. He'd rather go tishing. How are we supposed to win if we never practice together? He's not the only game in town. You're right. I say we burn the place down. Any luck? Wind shitted with the tront. Mosquitoes everywhere. Fish nowhere. Who's in charge ot the studio when you're gone? What happened now? Patricia was yelling... the toilet overtlowed... and a mirror tell down and broke. Seven more years of shit. - I cleaned it all up. - Good. Here. - If it tits, keep it. - Thank you. - It's cold today. Gracias. - You bet. That your truck? What's lett of it. Of course I added a Holley carb and a Hurst shifter. - Racing cam. - You bet. She used to tly. - I could fix it. - Fix it? I don't think so. I used to love foolin' around with this old thing though. I could make it good again. It needs some major work. The wheels are even rusted through. I've got the time. So I take the number 12 to Jetterson. Then the number 6. I take that downtown to what? So when I get out ot town, I get oft at County Line. How many blocks I need to walk? Fifteen? Think I don't know what you're up to? Is it working? Where is your tamily? I'm it. Where did you grow up? Nowhere. My father was in the army. We moved around a lot. Always the new girl in school. This place has parts tor old trucks. Here. 715. Right here. - That's it? - Yeah. Give me one second. They must have gone to eat. It you don't mind, we could wait a little while. I'm starving. This okay? Is this anything like Cuba? It doesn't feel like an island. You know, I've always wanted to live by the water. - It's a beautiful song. - Oh, yeah. It's about motherland. Home. What home means. I was never in one place long enough to know what that teels like. He says... it is like an old tree. Like the love of a newborn sister. The heart ot those tar trom home. It's beautitul. Is your tamily still there? My mother passed away. I never knew my tather. They had an atfair on a cruise ship. That was it. Look. The door wasn't even locked.

The protessionals? A career... shows, competitions, coaching. That's where the real money is. Will they win? Still takes two. I'm doing the best I can, all right? Let's just try it again, okay? I don't teel that we're getting high enough. You'll never get the height it you don't compress. - I don't teel you under me. - I'm going to Vegas. Ready? Wait a minute.

What about going to the club again? Maybe you're atraid to dance my way. Saturday. Deal. Wow, that was great. - What? - You missed it. My mother made me take a little ballet. He can pick me up anytime he wants to. Take a number, sister. Don't loosen up too much. It's crowded. What do you mean? We have the whole tloor. You see? You should've let me drop you otf. It's close enough to walk trom here. I should see you home. Thank you. I had a good time. I have an early day tomorrow. I had a very nice time. What are you still doin' up, pumpkin? Oh, I'm sorry about the sprinklers. Oh, my God, you are soaked. This is my son, Peter. You'd better come inside and dry ott. Yeah, sure. Well, we can't have you getting sick. Well, I'm on my way.

I'm just an amateur... but I have put everything that I have into this. And if I don't think that I have a chance... well, then... I'd rather not go. I see. I don't know how else to say it. You said it fine. Matter of tact, my back's not arguin' with you at all. One, two. And one, two, one, two, three. Very good. Yes. Support my arm. - That's good.

Heel, toe, heel together. - There you are. - Thanks. I was wonderin' where I was. These are all paid. For Las Vegas, switch Rafael's name with mine on Patricia's entry. I'm not gonna go. And take Michael and Ruby otf the pro list. Cancel all their lessons till Vegas. They're not competin', and she's leavin' early. Why? I don't know. I just got a note. By the way...

I know he hurt you. It doesn't matter. Peter matters. I'll have a future dancing with Julian... and Peter can see his tather more. I want him to teel like he's got tamily. Maybe he already feels that... right here. Good night. What about the night we danced? That was ditterent. That's my point. This is not easy for me. Ot course it is. That's why you are doing it.

Hot night, ain't it? That your only shirt? Lucky tarpon shirt. You know that. Then I'm gonna shut the kitchen down pretty soon... so it you're hungry, better make it. You ever cast a long rod before? I can do it. Get some ice. That kind ot weight tends to spool that line quickly. Throw me a beer. It's nice here. I don't know what you're up to, triend... but I don't have a son. She's too heavy. It she spools that reel, she'll take the whole rig with her. - Kid, can ya hold it? - Yeah. Where the hell is my knite? The line's going! Why did you help me come here? Did you feel guilty because you lett her without a word? You and I both know she would've told me about you. You would've called her a liar too. My mother never lied. Let me be real clear. About a mile down the beach there, I'm buyin' a place. I've been waitin' for this a long time. The studio will be history. So go to Vegas... earn yourself a nice little bonus... and then be on your way. Get me? Tell me. What did your tather think of my mother? What did he tell her when she called looking tor you?
