 

                        Perfect.|Just perfect. Okay Dove,|move closer to your sister. Mom, give me a big smile. Great. We're beautiful! Now|let's get one with the groom. Where is Nathan? Nathan? Nathan? Sweetie? Stan, could you make this quick? I'm|kind of in the middle of something. Katya, I'm in jail,|I'm your tax accountant... and you're probably|going to get audited. -Is that good enough?|-Your point is? You need to start|a tax journal... and write down all|of your expenses. Darling,|I'm not the bookkeeper. I have a frantic social|calendar, a thriving career... and a scandalous love life. Well, unless you want to add 'imminent|prison sentence', you'll do it. Also...|-Katya? Oh my God! What are you doing? Taking a breather. The best man|really lives up to his title. He's not the best man! I'm Nathan, the groom. My God. I'm sorry.|I really am. I missed the wedding.|Just got here. Great! You found him! Thank you. Congratulations. Good afternoon, everyone. Katya... Katya!|Katya, wait! Would you stop stalking me? It's over, okay! Don't|I have a restraining order? Yes. Sweetie, come on... I'll never get a girl. It's a great deal, man. How much? -Which one?|-The Dalmation. -Fifty.|-Twenty. -Forty.|-Twenty! -Thirty.|-Twenty. Come on, Darling,|don't pout. Every socialite in San Francisco|is going to see me with that bag. Honestly,|you should be paying me. First entry of stupid|tax journal... Nazi accountant|is forcing me to keep. Mont Blanc pen to write down|expenditures: two hundred dollars. Bang & Olufson|mini-recorder... since Mont Blanc|chipped manicure: free,|as pilfered from office. Spent two thousand dollars on wear|and return gown for Dove's wedding. Worn to wedding,|funeral and bar mitzvah. Still has tag,|and luckily, no stains. Thank God for 30 day|return policy. A tax journal? Something about 'over|declared business expenses.' I don't know, who has the time? If you still need write-offs, you|should reconsider adopting Sabelo. Who? The orphan from Uganda|I was telling you about. You can sponsor him through Youth Aid,|the non-profit I volunteer for. Eliza, I told you I barely|have time to keep a journal... let alone breast feed|an orphan. He's eight. You can't smoke in here. You know what?|You're better than the patch. So, how was your date|last night? Horrible. He fell into a|manhole and now he's suing me. Let me guess.|The Curse of Namambo? I haven't had a boyfriend in|three years because of it. -When it's going to wear off?|-Elevator's here. I don't know when it's going to end,|but that's what you get when... you try to pay a West Indies high|priestess ten bucks to do you cornrows. I thought I was supporting|the local economy! It just goes to show you|you try to do a good deed... and you end up with a voodoo curse|that cripples potential husbands. This is why I avoid|philanthropy. -Good morning.|-Good morning, Eliza. Katya, you're late. By, like, five minutes,|Gatekeeper. Where'd you get that bag? I went to Lulu Guinness|and I bought it. They cost a fortune. Darling, don't you know that|looking good is everything? No matter how much it costs? Nevermind. Wait!|I made seaweed snacks. They're totally organic.|No sugar, no flour... No fun. Sorry.|She doesn't mean it. Who the hell are you? I'm Sebastian. Sebastian who? What is that thing|in my office? What thing? That pre-pubescent|thing in my office? You must mean the new hire? Mr. Cosgrove will be in|shortly to explain it to you. How am I supposed to get any work done|with someone breathing next to me? It is an office|for two people, Katya. I do not need this right now! -I will be in boss-man's office.|-You are not allowed. Not allowed? You know, actually,|I forgot... I got you a little something. Lulu Guinness? For me? Stan, darling, if I adopt|a Third World child... can I claim an exemption|as a single mother? Adopt? You mean you're going|to be a mom? No, silly.|It's like rent-a-kid. That Sally Struthers thing,|'for 79 cents a day, blah blah' Thank god. I mean, I'm|moved by your selflessness. So, yes or no|on the exemption? No. But the IRS loves charitable|deductions. So do it. Now this is|really important... Hello. Katya, what are you|doing in my office? Don't you want to talk to me|about that child in my office? As a matter of fact I would|like to talk to you about that. It seems that you have now scared away|another assistant art director. And this time|in a record two weeks. It is not my fault that she|couldn't handle the competition... or that I'm a good|eleven pounds thinner. Is this a bad time? This is a perfect time.|Come on in. Come on in. Now you can meet our new assistant|art director. This is Sebastian. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure it is. Lyle, if you|had consulted me first... I might've suggested someone old enough|to take clients to drinks. Actually, I'll be|twenty-one in a month. Whatever he lacks in age, he|more than makes up for in brains. He's a smart kid, you know he|graduated from your Alma Mater. Stanford? Of course. Can I have a word|with you? Alone? Sure, I'll just|be in our office. It's such an honor|to meet you. Our office? I'm not sharing|an office with that tween! This is an ad agency,|not Romper Room! Will you hold that thought while|you're stepping away from my desk? Thank you. Look, Katya, I tried to find|someone with real experience... but the truth is no one|will work with you. -Your reputation proceeds you.|-Really? Stop that. It's not good to|be known as a prima donna. Even though my last Campbell's|campaign doubled their sales. You're the one who told me you|needed help with the workload. You have Dr. Bolls|tomorrow at noon. Take him under your wing.|Use him however you need. However I need? He's a dead man. Carrot celery and wheatgrass|for me, thank you. Non-fat milk. -What is that?|-Baryshnikov. -What's that?|-Skinny white Russian. I thought you couldn't do lunch|because you had too many errands? Darling, that's what|a cabana boy is for. Sebastian! After dropping off|my drycleaning... he cleaned|my make-up brushes... and then took the rest of his lunch|off to pick up my birth control. Katya! That's horrible! He's|an assistant, not a slave. Of course he's not. I would|never take advantage of him. He does have a nice ass. This is why you can never keep|a relationship, you objectify men. He's not a man. He's a boy. And the reason that I have|trouble keep a relationship... is because the men I go out with are|not worthy of my inner goddess. Your standards|are way too high. What is wrong with wanting a man that|has the looks of George Clooney... the real estate|of Donald Trump... and the bank account|of Bill Gates? Because, for the hundredth|time, he doesn't exist! Yes he does. I just|haven't found him yet. And until I do, I'm prepared|to be a single mother. -Excuse me?|-I'm ready to adopt Sabelo. Katya, I'm so thrilled! You're making a difference|in a child's life. What do I have to do|to get the write-off? PS: That Aunt Jemima thing|out. Kapish? 'I'm always dressed|in head-to-toe designer... prefer platinum|to white gold... and frequent all the best|restaurants in San Francisco.' Katya, the child lives|in a dung hut. I know! And he lists his|favorite hobby as 'eating'. So we already|have so much in common! Listen, I'm happy to help|with your personal stuff... but I also really want to help|you on your campaign, please. Dookie... You've already got so much on|your plate it makes me tired. Anyhow, I think I'm going|to take a ciggie break... while you finish up|my 'to do' list. I thought you were quitting? It's not lit. But don't tell anyone. I don't|want to miss out on the break. Speaking of, time's up.|You coming? I'm not finished. Je ne sais quoi, check. I didn't know what size you wanted,|so I got you the super pack. Do I know you? Good afternoon. Gas chamber|or lethal injection? I am on a break. I'm sorry. Next up, Melissa Rivers|on In the Know. Watch out San Francisco! You have|no ideal what's coming your way... Socialite sisters|Dove and Fawn Greenstein... well,|they sent out these keys. Invitations to the Royal Ball, the|biggest party to hit this city, ever. Anyone who is anyone is gonna be here|benefitting Youth Aid International. It's going to be|the most exclusive party... more exclusive|than Oprah's fiftieth... more decadent than|Puffy's White Party! And this key, this will|open the front door... Where's my key? to Covington Castle. ,Had to call best friends|Ferguson and Frangipani. Meet me at 17th and Market|Street! It's an emergency! Maybe it's in the mail... You're right.|I have to be invited. You're definitely invited. Teddy, why is it|so freezing in here? You should've|dressed accordingly. -It's June!|-Come on, it's called Igloo. -There's two more ice-tinis.|-I mean why wouldn't I be invited? Will you stop! You're|definitely invited, okay. And in case you're wondering... I think that I'm in love. Okay, I'll bite,|who is he? Hans. I told you not to mix|business with pleasure. Please. Office romances|are tr?s common, sweetie. You are an escort, darling.|Not an insurance salesman. Okay, whatever... Sorry I'm late. I was|speed dating for a billionaire. You just got divorced from your|fourth husband three weeks ago. But I'm so lonely.|I hate being single. I don't know how|you two do it. So, what's the emergency? The Royal Ball! Will you tell her that|she's invited, please? Of course she's not invited.|Dove Greenstein hates you. She does not hate me!|Fergie, does she hate me? No, she... Well... you tried to sleep with her ex-husband|before he was an ex... That was months ago.|People move on. I did not sleep with him|he was up my dress. I've been meaning to ask you to read|this novel I've been working on. Hello?|In the middle of a crisis here. -I don't want to bug you.|-You already are. It would mean a lot of me if you|would read it and give me some notes. And the grant deadline's|in two weeks... and twenty-five thousand|dollars is a lot of money. Twenty five thousand dollars?|What do I get out of it? What do you mean? I mean how long|do we all get free drinks? You know what, they've been|really cracking down on us... make it 3 month and you've got a|deal. Drop this off at my office. Next round... Why me? Because you're too charitable|for your own good, that's why. Now see, why don't you do|tell that to Dove Greenstein? Don't worry. These socialite|soirees are so overrated. That's an invite|to the Royal Ball! I was just trying|to make you feel better. How could you think that I was going|to miss the party of the century? -Anyone who's anyone will be there.|-Well, except for her. I'm kidding. Who cares about|the stupid party, anyway? I do. That invite better be|in my mail at work. If it's not,|my life is over. I'll be banished|to social Siberia. Too bad you burned your Uggs. -You're really overreacting here.|-No I am not. Take it from someone in advertising.|Image is everything. Katya, your Dr. Boll's|presentation has been moved up... to nine a.m. tomorrow|morning. Don't be late. Work. What an|unpleasant interruption. Especially after spending|entire evening building a buzz. Which reminds me|drinks at Igloo: free. Thanks to agreement|with bartender. Initial contribution towards|adopted child: 79 cents... new La Perla thong:|ninety dollars... soiled current one after running into|man of my dreams on smoke break. ,Have yet to learn his name, but|will refer to him as 'Thor'... because of Viking|good looks... Am anticipating many expenses|for upcoming Royal Ball. Can't believe Ferguson and Frangipani|think it's okay not to go. But what else should I expect from a|musical theater queen male escort... or my Korean ex-nail tech|turned-black widow billionairess? Only fourteen days|'til the ball. Must be brilliant, as have several|reasons to get to work before noon. Dr. Bolls... Dr. Bole's...|they're heaven for your soles. You were great.|You make... What happened to Nemo|and the bosses fish? What does it look like? Poor Lyle,|I mean Mr. Cosgrove... He's really upset. We're going to send|them for an autopsy. So, obviously you got|my message last night. After last call. I stayed up all|night working on my presentation. I'm going to go in there and|talk to my very pleased boss. I'm allergic to feathers. Could you hold this? To the fish. Lyle, I just heard... but come on, why the long|face? We just had a home run. You were perfect, as always,|my little angel. So, the good news is Rice-A-Roni|is looking for a new image... they're going to need a new|advertising agency. Now I've already given|the market research... and all the product lines|to Sebastian. Hold on...|I want you to present. -When?|-Next week. Is that an invite|to the Royal Ball? Yes, it is. I donate|to Youth Aid International. So do I! Well then I guess|I'll see you there. I wouldn't miss it|for the world. Good. Then that night we can|celebrate you landing Rice-A-Roni. Whatever.|Sorry. How did Lyle get tickets|to the ball and I didn't? Because he's a six-figure|donor to Youth Aid. So far, you've only|contributed seventy-nine cents. I have an idea. Why don't you volunteer with me.|We'd have so much fun. Working the event is worse|than not going at all! Goofball. What are you doing? I'm working. I told you,|there's no time for that! Go fetch me a nonfat latte|and a nicotine patch, pronto! I have a very important|meeting in half an hour. With a client? He has clients... After spending twelve dollars on|cab ride to house boat at Fisherman's... and a buck ninety-nine|on Charles Shaw wine... Was forced to descend on Ferguson|who's trying to kill himself again... over another client|turned lover. Fergie... He's not here... Ferguson! Go away. I'm coming in. No, not again... Spare me the Sylvia Plath. The oven's electric. Lemme guess. Hans? Listen to me, he's a no-good|German cheapskate! You need a boyfriend|who's going to love you... no matter how much you cost! Now am I right or am I right? Smile. Do it. Do it. Since ninth grade, when|I took you under my wing... have I ever steered|you wrong? -Well...|-Other than the home perm thing? Good. Then let's not|cry over spilled German. -Come on.|-What? Now on to more|pressing issues... I need you to call Dove Greenstein|and pretend to be my assistant. Don't you have an assistant? But not with your wit, or your|charm, or unique flair. I get it, I get it. You need your gay assistant|to call, I understand. Dial the number.|Watch the magic, baby. This is why we're friends. Okay, it's ringing. Greenstein residence. Hi. This is Ferguson from|Katya Livingston's office. -With whom am I speaking?|-This is Laurie. -Hi Laurie, how are you?|-Fine, and you? I'm doing fine|thank you very much. Laurie look, we were just|going over Katya's schedule... we were wondering, she didn't|get an invite to the Royal Ball... -We're hoping it was some sort of...|-Probably was some sort of oversight. Probably some sort of oversight.|That's what we were thinking. -Will you please hold?|-I will absolutely hold. You want to thank me now? Hi, Fergie is it?|This is Dove Greenstein. Miss Greenstein,|how are you? Just so you hear it from the horse's|mouth. There's been no oversight. There's been no oversight? Dove, darling?|Hi, it's Katya. I just caught the tail end of your|conversation with my assistant. What seems to be the trouble? Katya, darling.|There's no trouble. I was just explaining how we didn't|include you on our guest list. You know how|these things are, dear. We had to|cut it off somewhere... so we cut it off at those|who'd slept with our husbands. But you made so much money|off the infidelity clause! I know, but when you leaked|my real age to the Gazette... -Dove, no one's 29.|-I am! Anyways, now that the Sultan of|Brunei is bringing his harem... well, we're absolutely|at capacity. But take care dear.|Good to chat. Are you okay? No! The Sultan of Brunai|is bringing his hoes... and I'm not invited! So what are you going to do? Sweetie... it's electric. Remember? Oh my God. I'm going|to get a huge fine. I'll fix it for you. Here, hold this. -Alright. Thanks.|-Thank you. Going up? You're so uncool! Met Thor the love God|in elevator today. Electric Smile teeth whitener|thirty five dollars. And quit smoking|again. ,Hoping he works|in the building. Got to get Eliza to help me|hunt him down. Please God, don't|let him be married. Darling, can you get me|a list of every man under 35... on the fourth floor? My future husband works there. You found someone who lives|up to your expectations? At least in the looks|department he's very leading man. Katya. Forget about|a fantasy guy. What if I set you up|with my attorney? You want me to go out with somebody|who specializes in personal injury? He's at the top|of his field. Trust me,|he's a catch. Then why don't you|date him? I forgot,|Curse of Namambo. And the fact|that he eats meat. You don't want to go out with him|because he's not a vegetarian... and I don't want to go out|with him because I'm engaged. Fourth floor, remember? Come on. Look who's late. Is that a mirage, or are|you really wearing a parka? I was trying|to dress 'accordingly.' -Igloo's so last week.|-The ice age is so over. So, how was your|grovel-fest with Dove? It was a disaster. I should've known that|bitch would hold a grudge. She retains everything else. Do I smell|something burning? Is something burning? -It was me.|-It was you. The only way I'm going to get into this|ball is to be someone's 'plus one?' Sorry. My ex won|the 'plus one' in the divorce. Hey, guys. Teddy, darling, since when|did you start working here? Since I got frost bite|at Igloo. So, have you|read my opus yet? I did. Yeah. In fact, I mailed it|to the NEA. No, but I wanted to proof it!|It's a $25,000 grant. No need. Thanks, I guess. No thanks necessary,|just Sand-tinis. Coming right up. His book was terrible. So I just chucked it and|submitted my tax journal instead. You did what? At least someone has a chance|to win the twenty-five grand. Now believe me, I did him|and the NEA a favor. -So now he owes you one?|-Precisely. It's too bad he didn't get|invited to the Royal Ball. Of course not.|He's a nobody. -Oh my God!|-What? You just thought of a 'nobody'|who might actually be invited. Who? Bobby, my ex. He was|Dove and Fawn's dealer. -Art?|-Drug. Don't you have a restraining|order against him, sweetie? Didn't he tattoo 'I Love|Katya' on his back? He lasered that off|I think. You know he's crazy for you.|Like literally crazy for you. You're no one in this town,|unless you have a stalker. Bobby,|my actor ex-boyfriend... played Ewok 4 in Return of|the Jedi with such promise. Now he's a rabbit. Want to come to my place|and hump like bunnies? You big silly rabbit... that's right,|tricks are for Katya. Somebody's excited to|see me, Bobby. Who's Bobby? -What?|-Who's Bobby? You're not Bobby?|Get out! Why does this always|happen to me? Bobby, darling,|guess who? Want to come over tonight? Looks like Cinderella was finally|getting closer to her Ball. My shrink said|I shouldn't see you. -You're bad for my mental well being.|-He just wants your money. -You're not gonna call the cops...|-I invited you here. So how's the acting|thing going? Real good. I got|the bunny character down. In rehab, they said sex might not|be the same without the drugs. -But with you, it's still magic.|-Rehab? Six months at Healing Horizons.|I'm clean as a whistle. -So, you don't deal anymore?|-No. I'm a changed man. So, you don't see|Dove and Fawn anymore? Those girls are bad news. So, you're not invited|to the Royal Ball? No. What's with|the inquisition, honey? Nothing. I just have a quick|phone call to make. But I love you, Katya,|I love you! -Thank you, officer.|-But you promised! Must find a new way|into Ball... as chariot just turned|into pumpkin. No expenses worth reporting,|except for the cost of my dignity. -Could you shut the door?|-We'll always be together, forever. Knit, one. Pearl, two. -Good morning.|-Good morning. Wait! Organic prunes. -Organic prunes.|-That'll keep me regular. How was your date last night? It ended in handcuffs|as usual. Yours? He broke his ankle, but|at least he's not suing. Look! You got|a postcard from Sabelo! -Who?|-Your adopted son! I was wondering when he was|going to ask for more money. Listen, I'll be|in my other office. You are not allowed in|Mr. Cosgrove's office! I need a moment alone|with my son! Dear Katya, thank you|for adopting me... and sending me|your wonderful letter. You sound fun. Is it true that if I stopped|listening to the missionaries... I won't go hungry all|the time... and could earn as much|money as you some day? Hope to hear from you soon. Love, Sabelo. P.S. Can I call you mommy? Look at that.|That's where my son lives. Right there.|Yes. You know what?|You want a treat? I could be your mommmy.|Yeah, here you go. There you go.|A treat for you. You know what you'd make? New shoes for Katya. Good morning,|dear Sebastian. We've a very busy|day ahead of us. I need you to run down to the bookstore|and pick me up a copy... of Running a Small Business|For Profit for my son. I don't think so. Do you know where|Sebastian is? Say hello|to the real Sebastian. What are you doing? I'm looking for the cameras... Katya, I'm dead serious. Look, Sebastian...|darling... You may be very good|at playing dress-up... but you have no idea|with whom you are dealing. What do you know|about advertising? I know your position at Liquid requires|the least amount of work... for the most amount of money. And I also know you won't be|in that position much longer. My cabana boy is trying|to take my job! Can you imagine someone|so ruthless... that they'd stab their|own mentor in the back? If I remember correctly,|that's how you got your... I'm not that worried about it. I could eat the twerp|for lunch. Speaking of,|let's take one. Are we really spending the entire|lunch hour in the elevator? He's bound to get on|at some point. There's more|than one elevator. Better odds than Vegas. Now|push four again. We're going down. But I get motion sickness. Isn't it easier to just|go to the fourth floor? And do what? Wander about|aimlessly? That's so desperate. And riding the elevator hoping|to run into him isn't? I don't think you're one to|give advice there, Voodoo Queen. Hello, fourth floor. Are you okay? I'm so embarrassed. No, it's fine.|Can I get you anything? That's okay. That tie|would make me sick too. Thank you. Free seats. Excuse me.|Coming through. Ditch the umbrella.|It is so last season. No I can't. I don't want|to get my sutures wet. Why would you do that?|Your pecs are fine! They are not fine. One was a little|bit bigger than the other one. I demand that you take 'Extreme|Makeover' off your Tivo. You have developed body|dysmorphic disorder. I do not! Learn to love yourself and just stop|trying to be someone you're not. -No you didn't!|-Yes I did. -No you didn't, girl.|-Yes I did. Teddy, darling, when did|you start working here? Since I got skin cancer|at Dune. I have a great plastic surgeon, if you|ever need to get a mole removed. Thanks, but I can't afford|health insurance right now. So Katya, I called the NEA. They never got my book. -What are you insinuating?|-Just drop it, Katya! I can see right through you! You think I want to be slinging|drinks my whole life? You're so good at it! Don't fight that.|Now can we have two Rain-tinis? -You're cut off.|-What? You just lost|your drinking privileges. What about me? You're with her. Thanks a lot. You see|what you just did? -Sorry.|-I have major gossip! -About who?|-Dove Greenstein. My God!|Tell me everything! I don't know. I'm not|one to spread rumors. Give it up or I will tell him|about your working class past! I thought you were|a princess from Korea? I am! Let's just say Dove has|a hairy little secret. Dove not only is a brunette,|she's a virtual Sasquatch! She has a standing appointment|every Thursday at noon! She even gets her back done! Are you thinking|what I'm thinking? Blackmail the ape with|photographic evidence! -It's like we share a brain.|-I know. But you'll never get an appointment.|There's a waiting list. Don't worry, darling. Where|there's a will, there's a Katya. Okay Karino, Ciao. Hello, darling. We'd like|to get our hair done. Do you have an appointment? No. Did I need one? This is Arq. You need|one six months ago. I'm sure you can|make an exception? This is San Francisco,|sweetie. You're not my type. You're up. I'm sorry. You have to excuse|my friend. She's new in town. Obviously. But you and I both know|that a man in your position... not's just going|to bend the rules... I'm sorry, sweetie.|You're not my type, either. -Now what?|-Plan B. I don't think we've|actually been introduced. I'm Katya Livingston. Katya, my name is Geoffrey.|Very pleased to meet you. I think we have|a cancellation, right now. Look at that. You know something maybe you|are my type after all. This way. -Thank you.|-No problem. -Where are you doing in a smock?|-I'm having my eyebrows done. This is about work!|Not primping! But there's a six month waiting list|to get into this place. If we're going to be undercover, we|should probably blend in here. -Good point.|-Of course it is. -She's undressing as we speak.|-There you go, sweetie. Good luck. You're going to get some|work on your brows? -Yes I am.|-Well I'm the receptionist... but I'm also|the eyebrow specialist. -Fantastic.|-Would you like me to work on you? -I would.|-We're going to give you an arc. Maybe do some tweezing|over here. I'm going to pluck you|so good, poppy. What are we waiting for? Right here, baby.|This is my house. -This is your house?|-You're invited. We want to lighten the color of your|hair of your eyebrows a little bit. I want to feature these eyes. You have a beautiful face,|you know. -Thank you.|-What was your name? -Ferguson.|-Ferguson, that's a beautiful name. That's fantastic. Can we help you, miss? I have a twelve o'clock|appointment. It must be downstairs.|This is the VIP section. I am VIP. No, you're not.|You're black. And VIPs are red. I must've grabbed|the wrong smock. -Color blind.|-Nice try. My God. Is he going|to go blind? Go! Hurry.|I'll go with you. -Somebody help me!|-Keep going. You know what? I'm totally fine. It was|my fault. I'm so sorry. That was weird. I thought it was|burning. Well, I couldn't see... Helga, is that you? 'Ja.' Can we start with my back? I'm feeling really sensitive|today. So, please be gentle. I said gentle! Anyway, did I tell you|about the... party that I'm throwing... It's going to be|totally insane. My daddy's hired these Israeli army|guys to keep out the trash. Seriously, Helga! At this rate I won't be|able to wear my backless! Say cheese! Katya Livingston? What|the hell are you doing? Getting photographic evidence. How dare you!|Give me that photo. Relax, darling. It hasn't|even developed yet. What do you want? An invite to the Royal Ball. I already told you|we have none. That's too bad. Good headline:|'missing link found!' Fine.|You win. Give me the Polaroid and|I'll give you the key. Do you think|I was born yesterday? We do it at the same time.|On three... One...two... On second thought,|I don't want to trade. What? Why? Because you can't blackmail someone|when their face isn't in frame. Security! You know what? Watch it,|I bruise easily. Could this day|get any worse? I'm so sorry.|Are you okay? -Fine.|-I'm sorry, it's one of those days. Tell me about it. It's a nice Gucci. Thank you. Not only do you have|exquisite taste... but you're possibly the most beautiful|woman I've ever seen. Your lips... eyes... hair... Where are you going? It looks good. Hello, ladies. Gatekeeper, Nair will help|take care of that problem. Katya! I just received|a phone call from Youth Aid. Thanking me|for my contribution? Not exactly. You're not supposed to display|your wealth to Sabelo... in such an ostentatious|manner. Ostentatious? I was just trying|to bond with the little tyke. But discussing|your sixfigure salary... will only make him feel|discontented with his lot. He lives in a shack with no air|conditioning, DSL, or Tivo! I can't make him feel any more|discontented than he is! Jenga! Boring... Dear Mommy... thank you for the book on how|to run a small business. I started making toy cars... out of scrap metal. Do you think San Francisco would|make a good export market? And could you introduce me|to Lee lacocca? I did corrupt|my little orphan! Katya, could you come|in here, please? What's the matter? Cuddles died. Who? Cuddles... Cuddles...|my little new friend. My little iguana. How could he die?|He was so healthy. But he was fine yesterday|when I was in here. Before the accounting lady|came in right after. So... Khalua called. They're extremely happy with|the unleash ya campaign. Good for Katya. And Rice-A-Roni.|How's that going? Great. I've been|working day and night. I even bought|a gown for the Clios. Fabulous. I can always|count on your consistency. Now, if you'll excuse me...|I have a funeral to arrange. You've reached Katya. I'm out|doing something fabulous. So I'll get back to you|when I'm bored, maybe. Katya, this is Charles Fitz|calling, Eliza's attorney. I don't usually|do these things. But I'm doing it. So, give me|a call when you're 'bored'. And I can promise you|a nice night out. Give me a call. Talk to you|soon, hopefully. Bye. Sorry, Charlie. I don't think|I'll ever be quite that bored. I think that went well. I can't believe you gave your|attorney my phone number! Trust me, I think|you'll really like him. I told you,|he's not my type. He has two tickets|to the Royal Ball. Maybe he is! Why didn't|you tell me sooner? Because I want you|to like him for him. What is more important?|True love or some party? You know what, never mind,|don't answer that. Charles, it's Katya|Livingston, Eliza's friend. Listen, I got your message|and would love to meet. How 'bout Wednesday night|at Mario's on North Beach? Eight o'clock. Really|looking forward to it. Bye. What are you doing? I'm working. You should|really try that sometime. Look, give it up, Sebastian. While I was working on the|'Got Milk?' campaign with Lyle... you were still doing|beer bongs in your frat. Trust me, you are|no competition. We'll just have|to see about that. You do know that your name|is a hair product? Just saying. So, is that dinner? No. Work. What are you doing?|Why'd you stop the elevator? I'm inviting you to dinner. Really? I thought|you were taking me hostage. If you come to dinner,|I'll start the elevator. That's blackmail. I prefer to call it|negotiation. Okay, you win. By the way, I'm Chuck. Katya. -Did you say Katya?|-Yes. It's French. So, where do you want to go? I know the perfect place. Where are you taking me? Is this the|short cut to Postrio? Postrio?|Not exactly. So, where are we? Bon appetit. You're kidding, right? Would I kid about hot dogs|in the park? Besides, look around,|this place is beautiful. And here I was thinking|you were an Armani wearing... four star restaurant|kind of guy? I am. But I like this place.|It's special. You know, I come here|to think sometimes. I go to Gucci for that. Different kind of thinking. What can I get you? Hot dog.|Ketchup, mustard, no onions. Make it two.|And definitely no onions. No problem. Keeping your options open? Thanks. Thanks. I can't believe|we actually got a table. I hear there's a month long|waiting list for this place. I know the maitre'd. Very impressive. I'm very well connected. So, are you always this|extravagant on your first dates? Are you calling this a date? Actually, to tell you the truth, I've|sort of been off dating lately. Really?|How come? Bunch of disastrous|experiences. I can't relate. I'm kidding. My ex-boyfriend wore a bunny|suit for his day job. That's sexy. Not so much, no. Let's hear one|of your war stories. Well, it's not like that,|actually... I would date these women|who seemed amazing... on paper.|I have my list. But then it seemed like all I|was doing was dating a checklist. Well, there's nothing wrong|with having high standards. I know I do. But I think it's what's not on|the list that I'm looking for. If that makes any sense... I guess. Would you excuse me|for a second? I just remembered I have|to make a quick call... someone at work. -Sorry about that.|-That's okay. You got... it's just mustard. I guess it's better than|the foils in the hair. But still somehow I wish|it had gone differently. You want to make a wish? I think I still have some|change left over for dessert. Here.|Knock yourself out. And that's what you call|making a wish? Your eyes open, sort|of hap-hazard toss into the... There's no feeling in that. I mean you don't close your|eyes when you're making a wish? It's not going to come true. You're going to have|to do it again. What? What are you doing? Well, the quarter's not|going to get itself, right? You're crazy. What if it's cold? Well, I think|it's going to be. I'm pretty sure it is. Where's that quarter. My wish already came true. Dance with me? I'd love to. But I always adhere|to the dress code. It's cold, put this on. Miss... Well, I guess I better|go inside... before this officially|becomes a date. Don't worry about it.|I've given up on dating. -That was...|-Amazing. What are you doing Wednesday? I promise I'll take you|to a proper restaurant. But first, there's|something you should know... This Wednesday? -Hot date?|-Hardly. It's this dreadful set-up|through a co-worker. I already committed. -Listen, Katya...|-I know what you're going to say. How could I possibly go on|another date after tonight? Don't worry about it. I just|need a ticket to some ball. Well, here's your jacket. Good night, Chuck. Good night, Miss Livingston. Katya, it's Chuck. We're on our date right now. I don't think you realize|that I'm the guy... that Eliza set you up with|Charles Fitz. I thought it would be more|fun to leave you this message... than to tell you in person. I'm having a great time. I can't wait to see you|Wednesday! Shit! Okay, I deserved that. If you're trying to kill|yourself can I go with you? Sure. There's plenty of rope|here, I'll tie you up too. What's wrong? What's wrong?|I'll tell you what's wrong. While you were getting|manhandled by security... I ran into Geoffrey,|you know, that guy I like... does the little|eyebrow thingy... We got to talking|and I gave him my number... and then he never called me. Do you want me|to make you feel better? Not only am I not going|to the Royal Ball... but I just blew it with|Thor-slash-Charles! He knows I was just|in it for the ticket. That's pretty bad, baby. You're probably never going|to hear from him again. Fergie! I'm just being|honest with you. God, some gay|best friend you are! Come on now. Your making your little|pouty face, aren't you? Want me to give you a hug? I'll give you a hug. I'm going|to make you feel better. -I'll take away all your pain...|-What is that? My god! This? I was going|to tell you about this. When were you going|to tell me about it? What are you doing with that?|I was gonna tell you about it. But I was afraid because you haven't|been thinking clearly lately. Put the invite down|and no one will get hurt. What are you doing?|Put that down! Alright, you're acting|like a lunatic. Put that down right now.|This is not worth it. Speak for yourself. Come on now, sweetie. Sweetie... Late for work, because|stayed up all night... trying to figure out how|to apologize to Charles... without actually having|to say I'm sorry. Forgive me balloons:|seventy-five dollars. Box of truffles:|fifty dollars. Strip-o-gram and lap|dance: 125 dollars plus tip. Yet still... Katya, where have you been? The Rice-A-Roni suits have been|waiting for over an hour! -Rice-a-Roni?|-Rice-a-Roni. The San Francisco treat. Rice-a-Roni.|The San Francisco treat. -You better get in there.|-Think. Think... Thank you. Could you help me|with something? -Me, help you?|-Don't be difficult. Alright. You could have at least|said Pretty Please. Anyway, my wife and I,|we were dancing... we had a good time|over there at Clover. I know you've heard of Clover,|it's a great restaurant. But not well known|for their rice pilaf. -Thank God!|-Sorry I'm late. I had an emergency.|With my son. I thought your son|was in Africa? You want to visit?|I could arrange it. Rice-A-Roni... the San Francisco Treat. It's catchy.|And it's worked for you. Probably still does. But why alienate|the whole country? So here's what|I'm thinking... Rice-A-Roni,|the New York treat. Right there. The Chicago treat. The Kenosha treat! What are you getting at? Rice-A-Roni has been enjoyed|by Americans from the Mid-West... to the Rocky Mountains. And what America really|needs right now... is a treat. So your new slogan... 'Rice-A-Roni,|the American treat!' God bless America! That's it?|That's your pitch? Do you have|any creative ideas? It's Katya Livingston, of|course she has creative ideas. We're going to run a few more|things up the flag pole. Why don't you parade out some of the|other great, marvellous ideas. The ideas that I have,|because I have tons... There's something I'd like to|present, if I could, please. It's not what we scheduled. Well get on with it.|Go. We're just warming you up. Rice. It's gotten|a bad rap as of lately. Lumped together with it's evil|stepsisters bread and pasta... rice is considered to be|just another carbohydrate. A grain pushed aside|in our quest to be thin. But wait.|There's good news, folks! Rice is not as bad as its|carbohydrate relatives. Your product, simply|distinguished from its relatives... a lower carb alternative! 'Rice-A-Roni,|the nice rice!' The nice rice? The nice rice. We love it! It's the first campaign|one that I haven't nailed. Nailed? Honey, you didn't even|have the hammer in your hand. You tanked it. I'm sorry.|I don't know what happened. Let me see|if I can illuminate you. While he was busy working|his ass off... you were at|the beauty parlor. Or you were making 300 dollars|a month worth of phone calls... to the California State|Correctional institute... speaking to God knows who. Or you were taking a smoking|break and you don't even smoke! Yes. It's him. Thank you. As if this day|could get any worse... Cuddles was murdered. Poisoned.|Just like the goldfish. Some idiot gave|that poor iguana prunes. -Prunes?|-Yes prunes. Who'd be stupid enough|to do something like that? Wait, Katya, didn't Eliza|give you prunes the other day? I only eat soup. Campbell's select,|of course. Did you have something|to do with this? Come on Lyle,|you know me. I'm a humanitarian.|I mean I love animals. Katya,|I don't know you anymore. The Katya that I know went|to Stanford University. But when I called there and|checked with the Alumni office... do you know|what they told me? They said Katya Livingston|never even attended the school. You were checking up on me? I encouraged him to call. Katya, you're fired. But I'm Katya Livingston. And you're not going to talk|your way out of it. I am the best|in the business. I sold shampoo to the bald... sneakers to amputees... and contact lenses|to the blind. I am the Katya Livingston. Who is still fired.|Now go clean out your desk. I'm going to have Security|escort you out of the building. Fine! But without me,|Liquid will evaporate. Sabelo. Mommy will|take good care of you. That was Security. They're on their way up|to escort you out. I won't even have time|to mail these. That's okay.|I'll do it for you. You hate me. Maybe a little. But now that you're fired,|you're not so bad. Can I just have a minute,|please? I bruise easily. I'll get them to send|your stuff to your house. Thanks. Why don't you just keep this?|I never put anything in it anyway. -Thanks.|-That's okay. Do you guys work everywhere? In reaction to losing|six figure job... I decided that life|was too short... and celebrated birthday|early. But since only one unemployed,|had to celebrate alone. Loneliness led to utter boredom,|which can be very costly... Richard Tyler gown:|Three grand. Bejewelled Jimmy Choos:|one thousand five hundred. ,Have successfully bought couture|to party I'm still not invited to. Getting in touch with|inner child: $22.50. Due to lack of job and|aforementioned shopping spree... can't afford to pay rent. Thank God I'm subletting and|name's not on the lease. Must do something to pull|self out of doom and gloom. You in the middle? Katya.|How'd you get in here? I bribed the receptionist. How resourceful of you. I see you got my balloons. I assumed you were|angry at me... because I didn't want|to go out with you... because I needed to go out|with the other you... in order to nab|the ticket to the ball. I don't have time for this. And honestly, you|don't have to explain. I don't have to explain? Of course I don't.|You tricked me. Tricked you? I was just having|a little harmless fun... and when I go to come clean,|you completely cut me off. Like you didn't have the entire|night to tell me who you were. You set me up for this. Please, but you know what? I'm|glad I didn't come clean. Because then I got|to know the real you. And the you that|I went to the park with... is not the you who'd use someone to|gain entry into a ridiculous party. But if you want the invitation|so badly, fine. There you go. Wrong you. Regret not grabbing ticket|when had the chance. Almost led to something|more regrettable... a mall makeover. Trench coat and fedora to obtain|unemployment check incognito: two hundred twenty dollars. Silver lining to stormy|cloud: winning NEA grant. Now can afford to pay debts. ,However, still have no boyfriend and|no way to get to the royal ball. Finally understand cliche,|'money can't buy happiness. ' Stay tuned while we go live to|the socialite event of the year... and Melissa Rivers. At the Covington Castle|with everybody who's anybody... is there right now with|Melissa. Melissa? Watch out San Francisco! The night you've all been|waiting for is here. The night of the Royal Ball,|and we are live... Yes live|at Covington Castle. Everybody's arriving early, there|goes the Sultan of Brunai and one... two, three, four, five... all five of the favorite|women from his harem. I don't think they've all|been ever photographed together. This is a tremendous event.|Don't go away, we're... Katya? Baby? What are you doing up there?|We're coming up. Get out! Put down the Vicodin down|right now! I wish. But you used it|all for your damn surgeries. Plastic surgery kind|of hurts, sweetie. What are you two doing here? We're here to help|get you into the ball. Forget it.|I give up. Are you serious?|Are you kidding me? Are you going to let those two ugly|sisters keep you out of the ball? I wouldn't serve those wretches|tap water out of a dirty glass. They're nothing|compared to you. They're not? What happened|to the Katya Livingston... who can talk a mad queen out of drowning|himself in a moment's notice? I don't know. Where's the Katya Livingston|who introduced me... -to my first net worth individual.|-I don't know. Katya Livingston, you have to|fight for what is yours, baby. And that means your job|that Scandinavian love god... and your social status! Now get out of bed right now|and get ready. I love those.|Those are cute. You're right!|You're right! There hasn't been a guest|list or velvet rope... or moat that's ever kept me out!|I belong in a castle. We are live at Covington Castle|from the Royal Ball. And I'm here with Nob Hill|socialite Frangipani Lee! Who you best know as ex-wife of hedge|fund billionaire Lane Foreman... ex-wife of of music producer|Randall Jones... Come on, it's this way.|Don't push me. Hurry. I could walk through the front door.|I don't even have to go this way. Ex-wife of media mogul|David Bowler. Of course most recently, ex-wife of|sausage heir James Lawndale III. -It's so good to see you.|-It's good to see you. You know what? I don't like|water, and I don't like... sludge... look at all|this green stuff. If you helped me out we'd|probably get there a lot quicker. And ruin my manicure? My hair is already frizzing. At|least let my nails look good. I know you want to|look good at the party... and I don't want to die|on the way there. -Where are we going?|-I don't know. -This dress is amazing.|-Janine Isrial Couture. Now are you excited|to get inside? Is there anyone special that|you're looking forward to seeing? I'm very excited. Well wonderful to see you.|Thank you so much for stopping. Have a great time inside. We'll be back with more live|from Covington Castle. Don't go away. Can someone tell me if there's|anyone on the guest list... she hasn't slept with or is planning|on marrying and divorcing? You wait here and I'll meet|you over at the wall. Alright, come on, baby. Come on, let's go. I don't want|to hold this thing further. Thank God I went|with a spike heel. I guess you really|are a social climber. It takes one|to know one, sister. You better hurry, my wrists are|getting limper by the moment. -You wouldn't.|-I might. Alright, are you ready|to go in there? -Am I ready?|-You're fabulous. -Am I ready?|-You're fabulous. Now get in there and|do your thing. Come on. That would have been|quite an entrance... Who do you think you are,|Bjork? -Thank you.|-You're welcome. I need a drink. Teddy, darling... since when did you start|doing catered events? Let me guess...since you caught|pneumonia at Rain Storm? Close. Whooping cough. That's too bad. Now can we have|a round of Knight-tinis. I'll pretend to slip|you a twenty. Well thanks, Katya. It's a party.|The drinks are free. Then, let's party. Thank you. I don't care if it is Chanel. Winter|white in July is unacceptable! At least it distracts|you from the face. What about her? Polka dots, black socks,|t-shirt. It's Eliza... Katya. You remember Steve?|The guy I puked on? Ladies, look|who I just ran into. I really don't need|this right now. I'm not stalking you anymore. After that night at your place,|they threw me in jail. I did a lot of thinking and|realized you're not my type. I am! Fabulous! Fergie|finally found his love! To love! My god!|Someone do something! You broke|the Curse of Namambo! Katya Livingston? What the hell|are you doing here? Dove, you look fabulous. It's the biggest party of the season.|You didn't think I'd miss out? Cut the crap, Katya.|How did you get in? I climbed. What kind of a person would|go to goes to such lengths? An ambitious one. Try a sociopath! For years, you've sunk|to the lowest depths... to claw your way|to the middle. You lied. You stole.|You cheated. In fact you would do just|about anything to get ahead. But I've got news for you. You didn't spend thirteen|years at Chapin... and you never dated|a Vanderbilt. So, no matter what you do... you're never going|to belong! I'm not going to belong? I'm not going to belong? You're as|phony as your ski slope nose job! And if you could date|a Vanderbilt... then why don't you stop slumming|it with extras from the O.C.? Let's face it, Dove. You have always been jealous that|my boobs are bigger than yours. You'll never inspire|a designer... and you will never have front|row seats at a fashion show. Katya Livingston,|you're a fake and a fraud. And after tonight,|everyone's going to know. -You want a piece of me?|-Do you want a piece of me? Hold my gold. I didn't know|you were into that. Okay everybody,|the show's over! Should we help her? If we do, we'll be|social road kill. Let's wait|until the crowd thins. I said party, goddamnit! Ladies and gentlemen, can|I have your attention please? On behalf of|Youth Aid International... I would like to present|a short video... to remind us all|why we are here tonight. Over the years,|Youth Aid International... has been connecting|Third World children... to generous adults|like yourselves... in our immensely successful|adoption program. We'd like to thank|Youth Aid International... Rice-A-Roni... and most of all, my adoptive|mother Katya Livingston! We've all gained two pounds|since she sent us... the San Francisco treat. We love you, mommy! Is Katya Livingston|still here? She's here...|Hi. Coming. Hello, Dove. Thanks. Katya, on behalf|of Youth Aid International... I'd like to thank you|for all your efforts... in helping Sabelo|and his village. -Thank you.|-Julie, it's been a pleasure. I mean I've always been|heavily involved in charity. And when my dear friend Eliza|asked me to sponsor Sabelo... I knew that I had to do my part|in helping the less fortunate. Actually, that's a lie. I adopted a kid|for the tax break. See, I told you|she was a sociopath! Security, can we get|rid of this nut job? Wait! Dove's right. I am a total fraud. I lie about everything|just to get ahead. I didn't graduate Magna|Cum Laude from Stanford... I barely made it out|of U.C. Santa Cruz. Teddy, I never submitted|your novel to the NEA. I won the grant and blew|half of it on this dress. Lyle, I have shown up late and|left early a thousand times. I am responsible for the deaths|of your goldfish and iguana. Eliza, you have always been there for|me no matter how I treated you. I slept with|the guy you puked on. And finally... I tried to use this great guy just|to get into this stupid ball. I was so worried about being|in the right place... that I ended up missing|the best thing of all. Him. Did I mention that I wear|designer knock-offs? And... I thought the kid was gold. Katya, the video|was beautiful. We can't buy press|like that. We're going to be in every|paper from coast to coast. And by the way, focus groups|loved the American treat. That carb thing|was a total turn off. Turns out rice has more|carbs than wonderbread. He lied about the facts. Lyle, we'll work with you... but only if Katya|is our point person. -She's your point person.|-I don't work there anymore... and I really have to go. Katya, come on. Please,|think about it. -I'll give you a nice desk.|-I don't think so. Don't worry,|I'm going to work this out. You know, the advertising|game, it's a jungle. Is this seat taken? Charles!|What are you doing here? Long night,|big party, lots of drama... -It sounds fun.|-Not really. I'm not much for big soirees... or catfights. I don't know.|I needed to think. I didn't think|I'd have company. Well I climbed all the way up|the social ladder... and figured out it was lonely. So I needed to think too. Gucci was closed? So what are you|thinking about? Well there's this girl... God, there's always a girl. Tell me about her. She's a liar... a social climber... animal killer... She sounds awful. She's everything|that I didn't want. Everything that's not|on my list. And yet I can't stop|thinking about her. Maybe that's because|the list is misleading. And maybe it's because she's a|bunch of other things as well. She's complex,|and intriguing... and full of surprises. Like tonight. She did|this incredibly brave thing. It was about time. Well some people never come|clean about who they are. Especially in front of 250|San Franciscan socialites. But I didn't. Not completely. I don't know how much|more I can handle. My real name is Katy. I like Katy.|Katy I can handle. Now my turn. I spray tan. Really?|It looks good. Thanks. What else? I really like you. I really like you too. Cab fare from Covington Castle:|Thirty Five dollars. Ripping coture gown:|$85 dollars. Finding happiness that|has nothing to do... with money, parties,|or designer clothing: what do you know|priceless.
