 

                        Yes, sir. I will do that. Urgent. Urgent. Where's Lin? Lin Braddock? She left. You know where she went? I don't know. Lin... is your man really take you to America? Yes, of course. What about all this? I can't take everything. What about this? Yes. Take it. Take anything you want. Stay back! Stay back! I can't let you in! Please disperse. We can't help you all. We have no room! Captain, has a Lin Braddock come through the gate? If you work for the Embassy, have your papers ready! Not yet, Colonel. You're a friend of Lin? I'm her husband. She went to her home. When? One hour, maybe two. She had to get her papers. Please disperse! The dress is so beautiful. Thank you. Good-bye, Min. Take care. Bye. Hold it. We found her upstairs. You know her? Guess what I've got. All right. Hit it. Roger. I said get the hell off of there! I'm Lin Braddock! Look at the list! I work for the Embassy! Lin Braddock! Captain! What is it? She says she's on the list. What name? Lin Braddock! I'm a translator for the embassy! Give me your papers. I lost them! They stole it! Please! Look at the list! I need your papers! I told you! Somebody stole them! Oh, God! You have to believe me! Well, there's nothing I can do about that. Please! Lin! Look at the list! This morning there was a Colonel Braddock. Is Colonel Braddock your husband? Yes! Yes! For crying out loud! These people are crazy! Get them down! Shoot them! Get it together! Grab the seal. Step aside! Move! Come on, Junior. Get these folks out! Get off me! Get out of the way! Move! Stand aside! Let's go! Please! Wait! Please! Please! Commander, please. I give you a thousand dollar. Please. I love America. Come on. Hey. Let me go up. Let me go! OK. Take off. Son of a bitch! Don't worry. We got you, Colonel! That bastard was probably V.C. All right. There you go, Colonel. All right. Move them out. Move! No medals, no ribbons No welcome parade It's a lonely road home And a heavy price to pay Now I say a prayer For those that remain And I wonder Will they ever find freedom again? - Hi, Cindy. - Hey. I should run for president. What'd you say? I didn't think he needed to. Oh, really? Mr. Braddock? That's right. Colonel James Braddock? What can I do for you? Could I have a few moments of your time? - Sit down. - Thank you. Please, uh... could we please talk more privately? Yeah. Sure. Thank you. Would you like something to drink? No, no. Thank you. I am Reverend Polanski... from the Amerasian Children's Mission in Vietnam. Occasionally, I come to this country... to raise funds for the mission. I was hoping I could find you before I went back. Find me? Why? About a year ago, a young Amerasian child... came to the mission begging for help. He told me that his mother was sick. I went to see if there was anything I could do... and found out she worked for the U.S. Embassy... during the war. She has been severely punished by the Vietnamese government. Having the half-American son has made things... even worse for her. I'm sorry to hear that, but... what's that got to do with me? The woman's married name is Mrs. James Braddock. What did you say? I'm talking about your wife, Mr. Braddock. Lin Tan Cang. You're mistaken. No. There is no mistake. My wife died during the fall of Saigon. Your wife is alive. I know her quite well. Your son's name is Van. He's now 12 years old. My wife and I didn't have a son. Why is it so hard for you to believe me? Because I saw my wife's body burned to a crisp, that's why. You may have seen a body... but it wasn't your wife. Lin Tan Cang is alive! Believe whatever you want, Reverend. I know better. Your few moments are up. Oh, they had this great place in Georgetown. Really nice. Yeah, of course. I saw it last week. Even if you did believe me... I doubt if there is anything you could do. I've already gone to the State Department... and they will do nothing... but I had to let you know. Good-bye, Mr. Braddock. God be with you. Braddock? C.I.A. Please come with us. Wait outside. It's been a long time, Colonel Braddock. How have you been? You know how I've been, Littlejohn. Now, what do you want? You just met with a Reverend Polanski. So? Did he tell you some kind of... crazy story about your wife being alive? Is it a crazy story? Of course it is. Big mistake, Littlejohn. I didn't believe it until now. What are you going to do about getting them out? Nothing. If I don't get them out... they're going to die. People die every day. Braddock! I'm warning you. Don't step on any toes. I don't step on toes, Littlejohn. I step on necks. Welcome to Bangkok. We hope you enjoyed your flight... and will fly with Thai Airlines again. Take me downtown. Now, look here, mate. I said I need more room. Now beat it! Whoo! You take me home. You want to try knocking me off? How the hell are you, Braddock? Did you get everything? Yes, I got everything... but it sure as hell wasn't easy. That's why I appreciate you, Mik. That's what friends are for, Braddock... which reminds me. Got my money? Let's go. No, no, no! No need to hurry. The plane won't be loaded for several hours yet. We got a long drive out of town. Oh, shit. Here comes trouble. Go get the car and pull out front. Ah, OK. Hey. You're not going anywhere, Miklachek. Take him to the car. Jeez. Hey, where's the rules about... Hey, watch my beer, man! Hey, listen. I warned you, Braddock, not to fuck with us. Don't try to stop me, Littlejohn. You're stopped. Come on. Oh! Oh, my God! Freeze, asshole, or you're dead! Excuse me, girls. Braddock! Cut him off! Braddock! Braddock. Stop right there. Braddock! Wait! Son of a bitch. You actually made it. - Shit! - Uh-oh. Braddock! He's getting away! Hurry! Get in your cars! Go after him! Hit it! Oh, no! Way to go, man! Jesus, Braddock. Couldn't you lighten up just a teeny bit? I mean, I got to live here. You've got a one-way ticket out. Jesus, Braddock. Watch it! Whoa! Oh, shit, Braddock. We'll have the whole damn police force after us. How far is it to the plane? Uh, it's quite a ways out of Bangkok. No. It will be daylight before we get there. Hey, the boss is coming! Don't hang around! Why didn't you have her going, man? Let's go! Come, come, come! Are you sure this thing will get off the ground? Oh, relax, mother. Sit back. Enjoy the ride. It'll be just like Coney Island. OK, Braddock... are you gonna tell me where we're going now? As if I didn't know. Along the coast. Ganh Rai Bay. We're gonna have to skim the waves... when we get there to stay underneath their radar. Hey, Braddock, you've done some flying. Why don't you take the controls, eh? Give me a rest. Let's see if you can fly as well as you can drive, eh? It's been a long time. Oh, you can do it. I tell you... it's a lot calmer up here... than it is in your automobile. You know, when we get to the drop zone... I'm gonna pull her up into a climb... and you'll have about five seconds... to make the drop before I put her into a dive. I'll need ten seconds. Well, if you're a good boy, I'll give you ten seconds. Vietnam. I never thought I'd be coming back. I guess we never really can leave, can we? Aw, come on. Get your ass back there. I'll take it. OK, Braddock. You got thirty seconds. Good luck, mother. See you in hell, you crazy bastard. Come on! Let us each give thanks in our own way. - Amen. - Amen. Thank you, Father, wise and good... for home and friends and daily food. Bless, dear Lord, the food we take... and keep us all... Oh, my God. And keep us all home and safe. Amen. Please start without me. I'll be right back. Braddock. How on earth did you get here? Where's my wife? She doesn't live very far. Can you tell me how to get there? I'll take you there. Here. Wear this. There's a curfew. We must be very careful. I tried to tell you how bad it was. You'd better go, Reverend. And thanks. Good luck. God bless you. I didn't know. I thought you were... It's not important. I prayed you would come for us... and you are here. That is all that matters to Van and I. This is your son, Jim. Hello, Van. I speak English, Braddock. For years, he dreamed about you. Sometimes, in very difficult moments... I would find him talking to you... as if you were there... and somehow you would make things right for him... but one day, he stopped believing. I tried to keep you alive in his heart. I tried. I guess I know how you feel, Van... thinking that I deserted you and your mother... but... I want you to know that... Van, please. If I had known that you and your mother were alive... there's nothing in the world... that would have stopped me from coming for you before now. You've suffered so much. I know I have changed, Jim. I'm sorry I'm no longer pretty for you. You'll always be beautiful to me. We have to go now. We are ready. Let me check the street first. Van, hurry. Come on. Hurry, hurry. The boat's right down there. It might be a tight squeeze... but I think you're going to enjoy the ride, Van. If you say so, Braddock. Please be patient. We've only had each other for twelve years... and now... it is very difficult for him. He will need some time. We have all the time in the world. I love you very much, Jim Braddock. I think I should talk to our son for a moment. I'll go get the boat ready. Van. Everything will be all right. You don't care about me now. You only care about HIM. That is not true. It was our love that brought you into this world. Your father loves you as I do. If you will only give him a chance. Please try, Van. I'm very scared. I know you are... but once we get to America... everything will be better. I promise. Your father promises. Lin, we have to get out of here. Hurry! Foolish. You're in Nam. Very foolish to come back. I am General Quoc. How do you do, Madam Braddock? And yoi. And this must be your son Van. Very good-looking boy. When I received the report... that a strange-looking boat had outrun my gunboats... and heading towards Ho Chi Minh city... I took the privilege... of assuming it was you, Colonel Braddock... since Reverend Polanski had just returned... from your country... but now... Braddock... you must pay for the crimes that you have committed... against my beloved country. They have nothing to do with this. You are absolutely right. No! Ma! You will find your first test... quite challenging. Usually, we use people who are... a little bit taller. I have tested many before, Braddock... and no one has lasted even an hour. Maybe you can be the first, eh? I'll do whatever you want. Just let the boy go. You will do what I want anyways. Well done. Well done, Colonel Braddock. You are every bit as tough as your reputation. I like that. You have not disappointed me, Braddock. No! This has gone on long enough. No! Van! I'm in here! Come on! Come on! Can you make it? Yeah. Go to the mission. What's wrong? What are you doing? Where is Braddock? I don't know where Braddock is, General. You lie, priest. You lie! We know you helped Braddock! I? You must be mistaken. You lie! Perhaps a change of environment... will help you to think more clearly! Take him! Please, no. I can't leave my children. They need me! Of course! I would not want to separate you... from your half-breed American bastard children! Take them all! Priest, your new home will be Olaha prison! Don't! Don't! Don't! No! No! Stop! Stop! Kids! In the truck! Van! Where's the Reverend? I know! I get him, Braddock! Come on, Reverend. Thank God, Braddock! Protect yourself! Reverend, get the kids out of here! Out! Hurry! Hurry! We must get away from the truck! Hurry up, Braddock! Here! Get down, Reverend! It's OK. Ninety kilometers to the border. You don't expect these children... to walk ninety kilometers! I don't expect a damn thing, Reverend. But walk or crawl, we're gonna make it. Come on, kids. Come on, Reverend. Braddock... Braddock... the children are dead tired. We must stop to rest. Please, Braddock. They are not very strong. Wait here. Reverend. Reverend! Bring the kids. Hurry. Come. Come, children. Quiet. Be quiet. Come, children. Hurry. Hurry. Come, children. Be careful. Be careful. Don't hurt yourselves. Come. Go. Go. Come on, kids. Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry up! Thomas! Hurry! Sit down and hold on. Damn it. Braddock, get back, you bastard! Come on! Hold on! Braddock! I will kill you... and I will burn those filthy children! Hold on. Oh, my God. Get back there with the kids, Reverend. It's gonna get rough. It's going to get rough. Mayday. Mayday. This is Colonel James Braddock... calling American Military Assistance Command. Come in. Mayday. Mayday. Here. Take a seat. Mayday. Mayday. This is Colonel Braddock. I'm in a crippled C-47. I have a planeload of Amerasian children. Losing fuel. I'm approximately eighty miles east of the Thai border. If anyone can hear me, please transfer this message... to the American Military Assistance Command. Is everyone OK back there? Are you OK? Yeah. I fine. How you? I'm fine, too. Reverend! We're going down! Children! Get down! Hold on! Hold on! We're gonna die! Just hold on! Van. Come on, Van. Help the kids. Everybody down. Reverend. My God. Braddock, there's the border. As soon as I take the guards out... you get the kids over the bridge... as fast as you can. Did you hear what I said? On my way over here... I was wondering what you would be like. I want you to know... you're everything I wanted in a son... and I'm very proud of you. I love you. All right, men. Let's go. What the hell is happening, Dan? Braddock and the children. We intercepted a radio message. They crashed somewhere near here. Oh, shit. Van! Don't go! Can't leave him, Dan. I got to help him. Leave it alone, General. He's on his own. No one crosses the border. Get a medic in, man. All right! Daddy! Don't go! Christ. I got you, Braddock! I got you! Daddy! No, no. No, Van. Get back! Get back! No. No. Please! You're finished, Braddock! I've won! They will not dare to cross. What's he doing? Hold your position. He makes one wrong move, we'll climb up his ass. You got it. The Americans are bluffing. They will not dare do any more. Fire! Fire! Dad! There he is! Oh, Braddock. Thank God you are alive. Come on, children. Thank you. Bless you.
