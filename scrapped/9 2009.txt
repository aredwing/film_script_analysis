Our world is ending. But life must go on. (WIND WHISTLING) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (BANGING) (WIND HOWLING) (INAUDIBLE) (RUBBLE CLATTERING) (SCRAPING) (METALLIC GRINDING) (CLATTERING CONTINUES) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (GRUNTS) (SIZZLING) (GROANING) Wait! I'm a friend. (GROANING) Yes, I always hoped. Aha! So much thought. The details... Carved wood. Molded copper. (INAUDIBLE) You can't speak. Uh-huh. Come with me. (METALLIC CLANKING) Here. Stop! Somethings in this world are better left where they lie. But if you know where to look, these ruins are full of riches. - (GARBLED) Friend? - Wait, wait. - Friend? - Almost there. Friend. Friend. - (CLEARLY) Friend? - Friend. What's this? You found it! (EXCLAIMS HAPPILY) He's... He's always drawing this. (LAUGHS HAPPILY) (DISTANT ROARING) (STAMMERING) Are... Are we alone? No, no. (DISTANT ROARING) (GASPS) (SHUSHING) Go. (ROARING) Get in the can. Go on. (ROARING) (GASPS) (METAL GROANING) (GROWLING) (ROARING) (SHOUTS) (GROWLING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GRUNTING) Here, kitty, kitty. Why don't you finish what you started, with me? (GROWLING) (TREMBLING) (EXCLAIMING FEARFULLY) (METAL CLANKING) (GASPING) It's all right, I'm not going to hurt you. You're safe now. Where am I? With us. I never expected to see an other one. There, that should hold. If 2 were here, he would have done a better job. I wonder where he's gone to. I was with him. 2? Where? Out there? - What was he... - Keeping secrets from me, I see. I was coming to tell you. What's this? I... I found him in the emptiness. What were you doing out there? - I... - You'll lead the beast straight back to us! - But... - How many times have I told you? The beast. That's what took 2! If we hurry, we can save him. If the beast took him, that's the end of it. But he was still alive. No! We have rules! Our new guest seems confused. Perhaps I can help you achieve some clarity. (SNORTS) It didn't kill him? Quiet! (GRUNTING) Hey. (LAUGHING MENACINGLY) Hold on. (8 GRUNTING) When we woke in this world, it was chaos. Man and machine attacked each other with fire and metal. (ARTILLERY FIRING) SOLDIER: Look out behind you! (TAPPING) I found others. (EXPLOSION) There's a path ahead. Follow me. (ELECTRONIC WHINING) (SHOUTS) ONE: The gas killed everything. I led us here to sanctuary. And here we waited for the war to end. Slowly the world became silent. The only thing that remains now is the beast. So we stay hidden. And we wait for it, too, to sleep. But where did it come from? Why is it hunting us? Questions like that are pointless. We need to protect ourselves, keep ourselves out of danger. Too many of us have already been lost. But he isn't lost. (SCOFFING) - Why aren't you listening to me? - 2 chose his own path! I suggest you avoid making the same mistake. Go to the watchtower and take our guest with you. This was the first thing we built together. We can still go after him. Us? But he could be anywhere out there. (GASPS) That's where it took him. Out towards those three tall shapes. Oh, no. We can't, not there. We have rules. Why do you listen to 1? A group must have a leader. But what if he's wrong? Come with me. I can't do it alone. I... (INHALING SHARPLY) I... I can't. But wouldnt he have come for you? (SIGHING) I... FIVE: Wait. We're going to need a map. FIVE: Actually, I don't mind having one eye. It's easier for me. Allows me to concentrate on just one thing at a time, you know? (GASPS) (RUBBLE CLATTERING) Why was he out here alone? (DISTANT RUMBLING) Where's this tunnel? I don't know! Wait! (YELLS) We should go back! We can't. (GASPS) The beast. It's too dark. We can use that. (CHUCKLES) Wait. 2 would be impressed. We'll find him. You know, you're just like him. You forget to remember to be scared. Can I wait here? Oh. Why would it bring him here? (METAL CREAKING) (GROWLING) (GASPS) (GASPS) 2! FIVE: 2! I knew you would come. - (GASPS) I thought... - (SHUSHING) (GROWLING) (GROWLING) (SHOUTS) (SCREAMING) (9 BREATHING HEAVILY) (EXCLAIMS FEARFULLY) (ROARING) - 7!? - I don't believe it! You've come back! I never left. You finally decided to join the fight. You dropped this. Where've you been hiding? Rusty, hacked-together, shoddy pile of... (EXCLAIMING IN PAIN) (LAUGHS) (METALLIC HUMMING) - FIVE: We did it. We did it. - TWO: Remarkable. I never thought... Wait! What are you doing? We don't know what it is! (SCREAMING) - Oh! - No! 2! (MACHINE POWERING UP) (MACHINE GROANING) (SHOUTS) (ALL GASPING) (GASPS) - FIVE: Whoa! - SEVEN: Jump! (GRUNTING) (GASPING) FIVE: Hurry! Quick! (DISTANT CLANGING) What are you waiting for? Keep up! Come on! (SOBBING) I knew we shouldnt have come! Why? Why did you do that? I didn't know! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What were you thinking? What is it going to do? I know where we can find answers. (SCREECHES) Is this what it was like? SEVEN: Keep up! (PAGE RUSTLING) (SOFT CLATTERING) Oh! They've been here? The whole time? Twins. They've been hiding here. Lost in the past. Looking for answers. - Oh! - (LAUGHING) They're cataloging. Whoa! We need your help. We awakened something. No. I awakened something. Something terrible. That's it! ANNOUNCER #1: Today, the Chancellor presented the latest advancement of technological wizardry to the public. CHANCELLOR: Comrades, today dawns a new era. Let us praise this new technology. Welcome to the age of the Machine! It will create new machines in its own image! Machines of peace that will usher in a glorious new era of wealth and prosperity for the state! ANNOUNCER #2: Residents are advised to pause for a public address. (GUNS FIRING) CHANCELLOR: Science has turned its sinister hands against us. (PEOPLE SHOUTING) People of our mighty state, join me in repelling the iron fist of the Machine. But the thing that woke it, it was round and imprinted with strange shapes. The shapes corresponded. It fit perfectly into the Machine as if it were made for it. That's what 6 always draws! 6? 2 collected his drawings. He was always studying them. I have to see them. What? Go back to 1? So he can lock us away while this nightmare awakens? Never. Where did he put them? Uh... They're here somewhere. Uh... Here. Here. Here they are. Right? (LAUGHING MENACINGLY) ONE: You awakened what? You fools! I warned you! He warned you. ONE: Now you've put us all in unimaginable peril. And may I ask, did you manage to save 2? Of course not! By following this witless folly, you've endangered everything we work for! Why was 2 sent out to begin with? I sent him to scout. That doesn't make any sense. You don't send the oldest out to... Look, we need to figure out what's going on. The source, the source... Go back to the source. This is it. This is what awakened the Machine. What do you know about this? Ah, You can't be trusted. I won't allow you to endanger us further. Subjugate them! Sub... What? You illiterate cretin! Take their belongings! Hey! You're nothing but a coward. How dare you challenge me! I, who kept everyone safe all these years. Ever since you got here, everything has been unraveling. You're a curse, a fool, guided by pointless queries! And you are a blind man guided by fear! Sometimes fear is the appropriate response. (SCREECHING) Whoa! Quick! - 9! - Go! (SCREAMS) (SCREAMING) (PANTING) - Nine! - Keep going! I'll find a way down! (LOUD SCREECHING) (SHOUTING) (GRUNTS) (SCREECHING) (GROANING) (PANTING) Come on! (BOTH SHOUTING) Let me try that again. (7 GROANS) Oh! The cable! Cut it! (SCREAMING) Grab on! (SCREAMING) Grab those wires! Your cape! - Let it go! - I can't! Do it now! (PANTING) (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) (SCOFFS) Well, you owe me a cape. (SIGHS) Oh. (EXCLAIMS) (GROWLING) There will be more, won't there? (1 SCOFFS) It's not safe here. Stand lookout. (LAUGHING MENACINGLY) I'll search out a safer retreat. Oh! Ah! Ooh! (SKITTERING) Oh! (GASPS) SIX: Oh. What? What is it? The source. The thing that woke the Machine. - Go back. Go back. - Back to where? ONE: Dark science. What good does this useless rubbish do us? Forget it! You know something. What do you know? I know enough to leave their ancient evils to molder. Look what they've left us with. Leave it be, I say! But you, always asking questions! So many pointless questions! Probing. Pushing. Like 2! He always had to know too much! I was right! You did send him out to die! He was old. He was weak! (GASPS) Sometimes one must be sacrificed for the good of many. You coward! NINE: 7! (SCOFFS) Your path takes us to catastrophe. We have to go back. Back? Where? To the first room where I woke. (MOANING) - (SKITTERING) - Hmm? (SKITTERING) (SHUDDERING) (GASPS) Can't he see his way only brings trouble? I mean, what good comes from his path? (SCOFFS) I know what we need. I... I know what's right. (SKITTERING) (GASPS) No. (METALLIC CLANGING) (SKITTERING) (GASPS) No, no. It can't be! No! No! ONE: No! NINE: Find her! (SCREECHES) (GRUNTING) Don't look in the eyes! 5! (GRUNTING) (SCREECHING) - Seven! - Nine! NINE: No! (GASPING) We have to go after them! What? 8? Where's... Where's 8? That thing has them! It's taking them back to the Machine! Then it's too late. We... We have to get out of here. We must try to find another safe place. No more hiding. We're going after them! All of us. Need I remind you of the outcome of your last heroic venture? I can't let this happen to them. I'm going in. I'm coming with you. No. I need you here. If I don't make it back, destroy it. Wait! How? So then, let's hear it. What's your brilliant scheme? Well need a full barrel. (GROANING) (MUFFLED SHOUTING) (GRUNTING) (EXCLAIMING HOARSELY) NINE: Hey! Over here! (SQUEALING) Where are they? It's been too long. We have to do it now. No! They need more time. (GASPS) Help me pull it down! (ALARM WAILING) They're coming! They're coming! Help! Help! No! Not yet! Let go, you fool! NINE: 5! We're coming! Now! (EXPLOSIONS) (SCOFFS) Good riddance. It's done. (MUSIC PLAYING) (HOPEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (LAUGHING) (GRUNTS) (BOTH LAUGHING) SIX: (ECHOING) Sound. Sound. (BOTH LAUGHING) SIX: Sound. Thank you. Hmm. (EXCLAIMING) (PANTING) (5 SCREAMING) FIVE: The Machine! Everybody, the Machine! Run away! (MUSIC STOPS) No! No! ONE: There's nothing we can do! No! No! No! No! (GASPS) They... They've been trapped! ONE: To the bridge! No! They're trapped! They're trapped inside! NINE: 6, come on! SEVEN: Get off the bridge! No! Stop! You mustn't destroy it! SEVEN: Get away, 6! You mustn't destroy it! Don't destroy it! They're trapped! They're trapped! They're inside! They're inside! Run! NINE: Jump! Go back to the first room! He'll show you the source. It must be destroyed. No. No, we can't! Didn't you hear him? They're trapped inside. We can still save them. What? How? We have to find the source. It holds the answer. We need to destroy it. But there's still a chance! We're out of time. 9, they're gone. You're wrong. 9... Let him go. Greetings, 9. It had such promise, my Great Machine. It was meant to be an instrument of progress, of creation. That was the agreement our Chancellor failed to honor. Though the fault is hardly his alone to bear. The Machine was born purely of my intellect, which I now know was not enough. My creation was hopelessly flawed and indeed dangerous, for it lacked the human soul and could be easily corrupted by those who controlled it. That is why I'm making each of you. You are all that's left of humanity. You are all the pieces of my soul. Together, you and this device shall protect the future. Look closely and remember what you see. Fire! - Quickly! - NINE: I now know the truth! The Scientist! It's the Scientist. He's the source! He gave us his soul. We are him. Load the cannon! Stop! Youll destroy the talisman! It's too late! Quick. Quick, get in. We need to take the talisman from the Machine. It can be used against it. I'll lure it to me, and then you'll have a chance. No. 9, don't do this. What if you're wrong? I'll show you how to use it. It'll be okay. NINE: This is the sequence. (GASPS) (GRUNTING) (GASPS) (GASPS) No! Please, we can't do this with out you. They all died because of me. I started this and now I need to finish it. ONE: They left us nothing. Nothing. Why do we have to right their wrongs? Sometimes, one must be sacrificed. No! (GROANING) (GASPS) (SIGHS) You did it! No, I didn't. Not yet. They're free now. SEVEN: What happens next? NINE: I'm not sure, exactly. But this world is ours now. It's what we make of it. Sub Upload Date: May 10, 2016
