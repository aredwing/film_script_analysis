Look, ourteacher arrives from the other side of the world... ...we lay on an international ceremony and no one turns up. lt's plain rude! Mr. Celal... OK, go back to yourplace. Anyway, we'll discuss that later. Ourtreasured teacher, Miss Emily! -l don't understand. -Of course. As you like. -What do you want me to do? -Thanks Bravo! - Thanks. - Ready forthe national anthem! Why are these still here? They were recalled months ago. -Yes. l guess l didn't notice. -You didn't notice! -Suppose you'd sold them to someone by mistake? - lt was a slip-up, Volkan. -You're responsible to people here. -l'd have noticed before selling them. -Suppose you'd slipped up again? Who knows? Maybe you've sold some. -Volkan... What do you plan to do? Go knocking on doors and ask them back? You can't tell anyone if there's an emergency. You tell no one anything anyway! -Zeynep, quick! Help! -What's wrong? -Zeynep, what's up? -Volkan, l'll be right back. -Can you take charge fortwo minutes? -Why don't l come too? -l won't be long. Come along! So here we have the second grade classroom. We've just had the floors varnished and the board painted. We were also going to get the desks varnished.

Before would be betterfor everyone. Please, teacher. This way. Let's show you the computerroom. Make way forthe teacher. This way... Ourteacher, Naci Altintas had built it forus. Where's Zeynep? l don't know. Zeynep's a bit sensitive these days. Don't talk herinto making the wrong decision. She already made the wrong decision. lt may be wrong to yourmind, but Zeynep belongs here now. l happen to be an old friend who knows herinside out. Friends here don't make secret visits in the middle of the night. Do you love her?. l do. l love her. Don't worry. She loves someone else. Let me get in there. Now we'll try again. One, two, three...

This place is a lovers' den, isn't it? How is everyone? Good. Fine. Levent? How's he? Good. Townspeople... Ourvalued teacher, Miss Emily, has gone missing. Anyone who sees a blonde English lady is asked to report to the Town Hall. Zeynep, what's going on with you? Nothing. Seeing the teacherthere, l suddenly felt weird, suffocated.

He has a name! -Zeynep, let's discuss this tonight. -No, let's do it right now! -ln front of everyone. l want to hear what's bothering you. -Zeynep. Everyone already knows everything about us. You didn't want Volkan listening, and forme it's the neighbourhood. OKthen. OK, l'm listening. All right. We'll talk tonight. l have to get back to school. Mum, please... Get that knee better soon. Go on, tell her. Men... lt's all yourfault. Why are you laughing? So what do we do now? -How could they do that to our gang? -We should smash theirfaces in. -Right, make them sorry they were born. -Bekirthe Brat... Ferit? Ahmet? -You see how he was lying there? -lf l hadn't turned up, they'd have beaten every one of you. No way! We were laying into them before you turned up. -Don't lie! -But you got punched by Murat. lt's, Romeo! Hey, fainter, looking forthe letter?. Can we talk man to man, Brat? Get talking. -Give me back the letter, Bekir. -Me, give it back to you? What if l don't? Then l'll tell all yourfriends that you carry lippaint in yourpocket. -Are you trying to be funny? -Take a look if you like. lf you don't want me shouting about it, hand it overwith the letter. -Hey, is there a problem there? -No. When l get the letterback, it'll all be settled. Trust me. Sevgi! Run! Look, l'm sorry about the argument this morning. l learnt my lesson. We have time left. Last night's offer still stands. Volkan, it wouldn't be right aftertoday's scene. Zeynep! Hey, it's working! l have a signal. lt's ringing. Hello? Mathieu, it's Julie... Julie. Can you hearme? Julie! Julie? Mathieu, stop messing around. Mathieu... Mathieu, listen. Mathieu! Shit! Her dad answered the phone. He hung up on me. l was with the guy forfouryears. l'm supposed to be running away with the girl. And l haven't set eyes on her forthree months. And he asks what l've been thinking all these months. What do l do now? Just the sound of the wind. Just the sound of the wind. She lives up there. You love her?. l love her so much... C'mon! Where are you going? C'mon! Don't be ridiculous! Those guys in the village are just waiting to beat me up. At least one of us should get what they want. Volkan! Volkan, wait! Where are you going? You wanted to get away from the town, right? l'll be in the car. -C'mon! What's wrong all of a sudden? -That's what l should be asking you! Marriage wasn't even an issue a month ago. So what's changed? A month ago we were having fun, everything was perfect. And now? Look at me. Zeynep, look at me! Say you're happierthan ever. Say you love him. But then who am l? Just a go-between bringing news from town. l was in love, really in love. l don't want to get hurt anymore. Celal's a good person. Everyone was telling me about him. We made up ourminds together quietly, without any fuss. lt's betterthis way. How sweet and innocent. lt was listening to otherpeople that made you leave Levent. Now you're doing the same and marrying Celal. Listen! What if l hadn't said Levent was getting married? Would you still have listened to them? What if Celal knew why you're in such a hurry? Zeynep, why are you doing this? What's going on? l lost you to my best friend. And now he's stopped loving you, l'm still losing. What are you doing? What are you doing? lt's OK. lt's OK. Run, run! Stop! You no longer exist forme, Tuzsuz. Saniye is inside. She's very weak. She's in bed. l'm not letting you in until you hearthe truth from me, Ferit. Ahmet... Come away. What are they saying? Guys, the lady wants to look around. Are you going to let her?. OK, she's a guest. She's welcome. But you?! l'm talking to you! Man, what is this? Clear off! Gone are the days when men kept promises. Ferit and Saniye... A story of undying love. You planned to run away that day. l'd lose the two people l loved most. While you were getting ready, l was taking yourletterto Saniye. l was stopped by the villagers. They talked me into theirruse. l was to tell a simple lie. Three words. Saniye is dead. And the villagers would bundle Saniye away into town... ...and say you couldn't take it, that you'd killed yourself. That way, l'd lose neitheryou, norSaniye. l told myself l'd wait. One day, she'd forget you and love me. Fearless Tuzsuz. Fearless on the outside, terrified of death on the inside. l became her closest friend. She slowly grew older. l watched her every step. Years later, she came back to the village. She found out that you'd got married and had children. You'd settled into family life. She didn't want me to tell you. She condemned me to carry my guilt to the grave. lf l'd been that age again, l'd have killed you, Tuzsuz. -What are you doing here? -Hello! l'm the town's new teacher. Tell him, Ahmet. Hello. She's the new English teacher at the town's school. lt's my first day here and.. Ahmet, tell him to let you two see each other. As she's new to the town, l'm her guide, l'm showing her around. Do you really think you have the right to interfere in these kids' lives? She'd like to get to know her students before school starts. lt's foryou... Foryour daughter's happiness. So she'd like to meet your daughter. She'd like to get to know her. ls that right, Sevgi? Gulbahar! Mum was right when she said Ahmet would make a rubbish husband. Ahmet! How are you doing, Levent? lt's OK, go ahead. l'm listening. Saniye... Do you rememberme? Welcome. We're both alive. Rememberthe day we first met? TO LEVEN lt was otherpeople who came between us... Otherpeople who tried to console us. But our destiny is now in our own hands, Saniye. We need something to wrap this. lt's rude to give it just like this. l had something but... l don't have it either. Ah, give that here. l'm sorry, teacher. lt's all we could scrape together. But l hope it's some use. Once we've got you a bank account, the rest will be fixed in a few days. Now you translate. You see? lt's all worked out, huh? Thanks a lot. Hello. How are you? Not now, mum. We're listening to music. Are you OK? My favourite singer. lt's my first time listening but it's good. What do you listen to? l guess it's kind of late to be answering a question like that. You are the meaning of my life. l'm dying fortoday when we... She's here!
