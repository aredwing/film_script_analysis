What are you doing here? I didn't know they'd go this far. It won't happen again. Thank you. Valentijn, give the gentleman a hand. Valentijn! He got a fright. Open your hand. Now! Why would you kill a butterfly? Get rid of it. It's a map butterfly. It's beautiful and rare. Get rid of it! - It's for my dad. Shall I throw it out? Give it to me. Do you want some liquorice? - No, thanks. Take it. How do you like it, Vati? It's a real map butterfly. It's the summer variety. - Beautiful. I had to fight for it. Two Germans in uniforms wanted to take it from me. And then Miss Mieke... - You've been to Germany? I got lost. He's been to Germany. He's been to bloody Germany! He's no longer my child. He's going to a home. He's been to bloody Germany! I don't want any German butterflies. Vati, we're having dinner. What have you got there? Come sit with me, boy. Do you like to be in my lap? - Yes. Everything that's good will pass. Everything that's beautiful will be broken. Now you're in my lap, but soon I might hit you. In twenty years, I'll be old and ugly. And you may be crippled or dead. Learn to poke my eyes out with a fork. Or to make lamp shades of my skin. Everything's possible, boy. But I love you. Never say that again. Dummkopf. You don't know what you're saying. To love. People weren't born to love each other. Double beds, yes, but that's something else. That's something else. But did you ever see a double coffin? Never love anyone. Never. Never, never, never! Mr Boecke, we all know you were a hero in the war. And that you, as a German, fought against your own people. But that doesn't give you the right to hand out 68 fines in one day... as a police reserve. Do you see that man? That's the police commissioner. The chief commissioner. This man spent the entire war in his office and he made sure... there are only ten Jews left in our town. Do you know what that man in uniform forbids me to do? To fine Germans. And do you know what my reply to that is? What did I do wrong? You drove too slowly. I drove too slowly? - Yes. I've never heard of that. What do you mean by that? This is insane. - Drive on. Or I'll give you another one. Screwdriver. Reinier, please remove that thing. Don't act so crazy. Who's crazy? He or me? He or me? - He. He. - He. You. Boecke, you have to leave the house. Come, Reinier, don't make it harder than it is. Justice has been administered. I don't acknowledge the Dutch legal system. Come on, Boecke. I wish I was a bachelor again, so I could go after the women. Get in, but shut up. Didn't you see it? Take off those sunglasses. What is this, damnit? The deal was you'd shut up. Please stop. Kill yourself, not me. I want to get out. Yes, it's me. Damn, I asked you for an answer. I'm getting so fed up with this. I only want character parts. Shit! Miss Mieke? I'm Valentijn Boecke. From the butterfly. This isn't just a meeting. Fate brought us together tonight. I don't believe in fate. - You're too young. Tough guy. Too young, too scared. I never fuck people I know. Who mentioned fucking? Jesus Christ... you want to... here? You're off your rocker. Oh, you prefer the lights out. Mr Boecke, you're up! Boecke! - Yes, I'm coming, Our next guest is literary sensation Valentijn Boecke. Middelburg. Zeeland potatoes, mussels, sugar beet. I guess you need it to rhyme. No money, no fire, no speed No paper, no miracle, no weed No bread, no idea, no time No balls, no shit, no dime If that's what you wanted, you should have asked Jules Deelder. Then I hear language in which the song rests forever Blue, but golden azure A prince is kissed unguarded Looks for father in the field The girl hurries to get home Not tormented by demons That inhabit this manuscript Damnit, I keep dreaming things I can't sing. Would you mind signing this? Have you all heard of Belgian fucking? What's your name? Elleke, sir. - Elleke. Belgian fucking is fucking with strong coffee. You fuck, you lick, you suck until you fall asleep. And then strong coffee. Then you lick again, sleep again. day after day. Fuck to forget. What do you say, Nelleke? - Elleke, sir. Here you are, Elleke. None of you? No one has anything to forget? What about you, beautiful prince? Always the same shit in Zeeland. Hospitality zero. Respect for artists zero. Fuck Middelburg! It's not easy to get your address. Is it a secret? No, but... - I only wanted to see how you live. Five minutes? In and out again. Yes, but I'm not alone. That's ok. I'm not alone either. Good. Don't mind the mess. Mess? It's a pigsty. A beautiful pigsty. You know what Miss Van Dalen used to say: "The way your desk looks..." Sorry. Can't we meet some other time? I just came from the doctor. I'm pregnant. Congratulations. That's great. Congratulations to you too. Your child. I'll come see you some other time. Bye. Can't you have it removed? - It's four months old already, silly. Let's first get used to the idea. I don't want to get used to anything, bloody hell! I'm the most terrible father possible. I beat them, I kick them... I hate them! I'd like to give the poetry award to Valentijn Boecke... for his collection of poems called 'The Map Butterfly'. Mr Boecke, congratulations! You can now give your speech. Thanks. That was short but sweet. But can't you tell us something? Were you surprised that your debut was an immediate success? No. - Unfortunately, no. Short but sweet again. That brings us to the end... What does love mean to Mr Boecke? A good question from the audience. What's the importance of love in your work? All great art deals with love and death. Then why do you reject the result of this love? Why do you reject the result of this love? Do you mean in his work? Can you be more specific? Sure, does he always fuck and say I love you and then disappear forever? The question is if you always fuck and... I never talk when I fuck. You're hearing voices. I never said I loved you. Yes, you did. When you came inside me. I can't even say that kind of nonsense. Projection. - Projection! Is my belly projection too, Mr Poet? Get lost. I don't mind if you have girlfriends or boyfriends for now. We'll find a way to deal with that. Come, listen. I think we can have a great time. We'll do crazy things together. Go do crazy things on your own. Youre running away from yourself, buddy. Why are you so afraid to be a father? Is it because of your own father? - Yes. Bye! Let's go for a drive. Hello. It's nonsense to think things can always only repeat themselves. Get lost. You're not like this, Valentijn. Yes, I am! You'd be a fantastic father. I know what happened in the past. - You don't know anything. Get lost! Listen! Stop it. You don't know anything. You're just deranged. I'm wetting myself. Help, I'm bleeding, Valentijn. Valentijn, help! Women used to throw themselves off the stairs if they didn't want a child. These days, we go to the fair. - I want the child. You could have fooled me. Did you quit smoking? - Yes. Drinking? Your liver's enlarged. Do you know what alcohol does to the foetus? I'm not here to... - Don't move. Look, that's his heart. Look at him struggle. Look, Valentijn, his heart. Look. This is his head. His eyes. This is his heart. The children are ready. We're just waiting for the parents. Good morning, Valentijn. Good morning, Micky. - Good morning, mummy. Hello, darling. - Look what I found in the sea. Asshole! Shit! Not in bed. - There's a note in there. You're cold. Come under the blankets. Don't throw sand in my face. Oranges, cotton wool... It's your mother's shopping list, silly. Are you enjoying yourself? Yes, it's wonderful. You're so funny. If I was funny, life would be a lot easier. A nice, funny life. A nice, funny holiday. Don't you love your son? Are you starting that again? I wonder what you feel when we're on holiday with the three of us. I feel, you feel, he feels, we feel, they feel. Can't you talk normally? Am I allowed to feel nothing? Is that allowed too? Thank you. I feel nothing. Except for sand up my ass. You're here out of your own free will. Because I'm a noble soul and I'm true to my word. If you were really noble, you would already have moved in with us. No, I'm noble, not masochistic. You're really funny. Well, circumstances are good. Nice sun, good company. You're an obnoxious little fellow. Do you know what you said the night we made Micky? You're such a bitch. Such an incredible bitch. So sweet, you said. So sweet. Only five more days. Only five more days. I'm going back. I'm tired. We ran out of vodka and whiskey, if that's what you had in mind. If we were dead, then you'd miss us. Nice atmosphere. Can the sun fall down? - No, Micky. It does so at night. - Yes. Look, butterflies. Do you know what kind of butterflies? - White ones. Yes, but what's their name? Henk. - No. It's the green-veined white or pieris napi. Do you know which language that is? - Chinese. No, Latin. Let's go catch them. - No, you might get lost. Let's sit down. I'm tired. - I'm not tired at all. How many days until my birthday? A couple of weeks. I want a big white bear for my birthday. You're too old for that. - No. Yes, you are. -No. - Yes. Can I have another ice cream? No, no, no! Valentijn, I'm sick. I think I have to puke. Shit! Don't think about it. Just don't. I have a headache. I'm tired. I can't walk. He needs oranges. Vitamins. Mieke, he just puked. Close your eyes and sleep. It was a nice day today. - Yes, it was fun. Can butterflies puke? Butterflies? No, they can't. And white bears? Micky, sleep now. Sleep. We still have to look for fleas. How long will the holiday last? Five more days. - Oh, that's very long. Yes, that's very long. Sleep well. Good night. Bye, Mick. I want another Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary! I keep dreaming things I can't sing. Hello? Telephone! Yes. What? That's strange. Are you sure it was 9:30? It says 11:30 in my agenda. Alright, I'll be right there. Have we met before? Bloody Mary. Valentijn. No, Dieudonne. Call me Dd. Oh, Bloody Mary. Go, you're in a hurry. Important meeting? No, just a request to translate all Baudelaire's poetry. For a big publisher. Two years of work. Very exciting. That way we can already create some publicity. Here, at the bottom of the page. It's what we agreed upon with what your lawyer added... the payment terms, delivery dates. Rights and obligations. Jesus, you're crazy. An opportunity like that. Crazy's the wrong word. You're a coward. You're scared. I thought you studied law, not psychology. Afraid to honour your obligations. Asshole. How old are you? Do you want to go on like this for ever? Did I put in all that effort for this? Never mind. Dear Harold, I don't want to translate. I want to be translated. I suddenly realised that. As if you've written that much, these last years. You're one of the few people who don't change at all. And I don't mean that as a compliment. You're content with what you achieved years ago. The illusion of the brilliant poet. Dope, inspiration, sex, poetry. The Valentijn Boecke gimmick. May I? I already know that gimmick. You're too scared to make a commitment. Whether it's translation work or a relationship. Never mind. - No, continue, it's interesting. Maybe I can do something at your lawyer's office. A real commitment, I mean. Don't you have parties with the personnel? Right. Bye. My lunch break's over. Can you pay? Harold, wait. Yes, here's your money. Go pay. It's Micky's birthday tomorrow and I don't have a cent. Can I borrow a 100 bucks from you? A 100 bucks? Come on. For the good cause. Loser. I hope you can get early retirement. Or else you'll be working there until you're 65. Sucker. Happy birthday... Micky's in bed. Is he sick? - Yes. What's wrong with him? - Nothing, he's just sick. The flu. Nothing serious. Just go. I didn't tell him it's his birthday. What kind of nonsense is that? You've got balloons. Valentijn, please get lost. You're never that worried about him. Well celebrate some other time. He's got candy and everything. It's his birthday. You can't do that to him. To bed you. Act the nice daddy next week. What happened? - Get lost. You hit him. Let go off me. - Did you hit Micky? I asked you something. - It was an accident. He had chocolate on his fingers. I pushed him. What is it to you? Open up! Open up, damnit. Show me. Does it hurt? - A bit. We're going to celebrate your birthday. And we'll get your things. Come. Open up! Let me in! Flip-flops. Micky's staying with me for a while. Come, kid. You're good at pretending. Asshole! Micky, I love you! Micky! Do you have a real father, Valentijn? He... Is he dead? - Not as far as I know. Oh, you've had an argument. I wish I had a real father too. - I am a real father. Then why can I never call you daddy, always Valentijn? Well? Look Valentijn, he's pissing. Yes, just like us. Apes check each other for fleas too. Yes, just like us. Do they eat vitamins too? Probably. Try it. He's eating it. He eats it. How much do they eat? - A lot. Can polar bears swim? - Yes. Why isn't he swimming then? - I think he doesn't feel like it. Why doesn't he feel like it? - Maybe he's tired. Why is he tired? - Because people talk to him all day. Come with me. Mieke's all alone now. Let's throw a party for your birthday. For all the kids in your class. Great, with coca cola and crisps. We'll do it. - Ok. Everything will be alright. Don't worry. And now go to sleep. Good night. - Sleep well. Right. Valentijn, wake up. Valentijn, wake up! I have to go to school. It's 8 o'clock already. - No. Look, 8 o'clock. It's broken. - No, it's not. Listen. Micky, please. Where do you keep the brown porridge? I don't want that. - It's all I have. Brown porridge. I told you I don't have that. - Fresh orange juice. Eat! Are you crazy, jerk? Be happy that you can have breakfast here. I'll be late for school. No, you won't be late. Can I have some time to wake up? Shoelaces, Valentijn. I'll be late for school, I'll be late for school. Shut up, relax! Jesus. You're not even wearing your socks yet. - This is how it has to be. Thanks. See, we're late. They're all inside. It's alright. I'll go with you to the teacher. No, that's stupid. How are you? - Good. I arranged everything. Can I have everybody's attention? Attention, please. Tomorrow, Micky's throwing a birthday party. And all the children are invited. It'll be a disco party. It starts at 2 and continues until late. We have everything, coca cola, crisps... The children only have to bring their own condoms. Hey Mick, I don't think they're coming. I think I acted a bit weird to the mummies and daddies. Sorry. What are you going to do there? - Read to them. The teacher always does that too. From the same book? No, poetry. What's poetry? Remember that I wrote something for you with St Nicholas? "This present is for my little man. It's cookies in a can." Very good. That's poetry. And when you write poetry, you're a poet and that's what I am. And sometimes I read poetry to people. But it's not St Nicholas. No, but some people always like to hear poetry. I have to poop really bad! It's all the candy that I had. Writing poetry's so easy. I'll do it too when I grow up. Valentijn Boecke "Map Butterfly" Dad, I'm bored. Valentijn, I'm bored! See that man? When he's ready, it'll be my turn. I want to go home. A bit longer, Mick. One more hour. Do you want another chocolate milk? Another chocolate milk, please. Dad, I have a headache. I'll call you Valentijn again. You don't listen to dad anymore. Valentijn, I have a headache. Yes and what do you want? I want to go to bed. He can lie in my car. Go to sleep. I'll wake you up in a bit. We'll end our cultural evening with poet Valentijn Boecke. A hand, please. Mr Boecke, where are you going? I thought the level of this evening was fucked! Micky! Where are we going, mummy? We're going home. You're such a bitch. Such an incredible bitch. You, incredible... - Incredible what? You leave your child in a car at night. Incredible what? What is this? I've been looking all night. I've been to the police and to your house. I took him to a railway crossing. You don't want me or Micky so we might just as well not exist. I can give life and I can take it. So what are you doing here? Why didn't you do it? Why didn't you have the guts? You're waking him up. I've decided not to feel anything for you anymore. I don't care for you. I'm going back to Zeeland and I'm taking Micky. And I never want to see you again. That's also best for Micky. Sooner or later you'll go as crazy as your father. Let's spare him that. You never wanted Micky, did you? Just me. And you? Did you want him? Can you get his things? I want to go. No, we were going to do something this weekend. So he stays here. I'll bring him to school on Monday. And then? Then I'll pick him up, with his things. And that will be it. Get him oranges, vitamins. - Yeah, yeah, vitamins. It's really not cold. Come in. No, I won't go in. Show me you can swim. Come on. No. - Oh come on. No! Help, help! Are you alright, Micky? See that it's not cold? Asshole! Ask for mercy! Ask for mercy? Mercy! Good boy. We'll always stay together, won't we? You don't want that. - Of course, I do. I'm a bad father. - You saved me from the water. I don't even have a room for you. I can't fold your clothes neatly, I ruined your birthday party. It doesn't matter. I'll always stay with you. Shake hands on it. I'm never home in the evenings. - You're always home. Because I know you're here. Because it's only for now. Won't I always stay with you then? I have to tell you something. I really have to fart. Ok, do it. I gassed him. I gassed him. Daddy. Daddy, that's enough. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy, don't die. I'm only joking. I'm pretending. You can't die yet, because I cant tie my shoelaces yet. And I can't write and I can't do maths. I'm not going to die. You first have to get really old. By that time, you can tie your shoelaces. Mieke Van De Pas speaking. Yes. What do you mean, don't pick up Micky. We'll turn things around. He lives with me and you can visit him. Are you mad? Micky's mine and I'm picking him up now. There's no use yelling, Mieke. I talked to Micky about it. He's my child too. He's my child too. You're grown-ups. Can't you agree on something without lawyers? I want to be his father, not her husband. If this becomes a legal battle, it'll cost you a lot of money and time. And if you win... listen... If you win, you'll be fed up with the kid by that time. Or he'll probably be fed up with you. - Amigo, I want this. Amigo, you'll have to change your life then. Translators have to translate and deliver in time. I don't know if I'm conservative enough for the Guardianship Board. Pancakes on Sunday. You're trying. Shit, Micky, spit it out. Would you like a cookie? - Yes, please. So translating is freelance work? Yes. - And can you live off it? Yes, it's a contract for two years. And it combines well with Micky's school. Can I see where Micky sleeps? - Yes, of course. Please follow me. Please. So this is his room. Yes and he helps me clean it up. We just took five garbage bags of junk out. It must be quite a change with the boy. Yes, but that's the choice I made. Do you still get the chance to write poetry? Not really. You're well informed. I've read things. Interviews, articles, interesting stuff. What was it? Something about Belgian fucking. Help me. The coca cola and crisps must be left-overs from the disco party. When will you hear from them? - That could take a few weeks. So I'll lose him in three weeks. I won't have to go to Paris either. For that stupid Baudelaire stuff. It's nonsense to give up already. Micky doesn't mind that I'll look after him for three days. If the Board finds out you're letting the translation work go... you won't have a chance. It's good to take a break. Mick, do you want to go in that one? No, thanks, I'm a bit dizzy. Well, it's only for big children anyway. Rinse. Have fun. Bye. Perfectly on time. Very convincing. What are you doing here? Have a look. At you two. I saw a lady from the Guardianship Board yesterday. They were well informed. About holidays, about Micky's birthday that I didn't celebrate. About that I hit him. What did I do wrong? What did I do wrong by loving you? I've always been honest with you. I've always left all options open. Anything you wanted. Mieke, I don't love you. How can you say that if you don't know what love is? I've always believed you'd be a great dad. And now you believe it yourself and you want it... without me. Why? It's not fair. Life isn't fair. I've found that out too. Just wait. Just you wait. What's wrong? - Nothing. Put on your pyjamas. It's very late. What's wrong? My father died. - My granddad. Yes, get undressed. Now I can never see him. You didn't see him often either. Get undressed, damnit. And collect your toys. We won't have time tomorrow morning. Hello, Valentijn Boecke? A package for you. Please sign. Why do you throw that out? - I'll fill up a bath for you. And you just said I didn't need to. What are you doing? Go to bed. Raus, raus, raus! Did you open my box? Tell me. What did you see? Tell me! A baby and you. And a woman and you in front of a plane. Where's that baby now? Where is that baby? Dead. Where is that woman? My woman. Dead. And where are all the people in the picture? Dead. And who killed them? The Nazis. Idiot, Dummkopf! Did the Nazis bomb Danzig? Did the Nazis bomb their own cities? Of course not. Who wiped out Danzig? The good guys, the bombers, the heroes. I bombed Danzig! I killed all those people. Daddy, daddy. What's that? - Micky, my son. How could you do that? Dummkopf. Idiot. Dummkopf, didn't you learn anything from me? Why did you give me the box then? - Because I'm... Daddy, what's wrong? What's wrong? - Go away. Daddy, what's wrong? When will you be back from Paris? - In two days. Will you be good? - Dd says I can stay up late. And I can drink chocolate milk all day. - Well, well. I have to hang up. I'm out of money. Will you bring me a present from Paris? - Well... Yes, please. - Bye, Mick. Bye daddy. - Bye. Hey, what are you doing here? Come in. We'll explain. What happened? Where's Micky? - Just come in. Why, surprise? Yesterday, Mieke showed up at the school. She felt alone. She said it was her birthday. She wanted to do something nice with Micky. She kept him. Well done, Dd. - He's no longer with Mieke. He's in hospital. - He fell off the stairs at her place. How could he fall off the stairs? How could he? How could he, damnit? You pushed him. Admit it. Admit it! He hasn't even been inside. He fell just like that. He acted weird with his eyes, as if... We were just about to go in and... No, it's not my fault. I didn't do anything. Right, it's my fault. - No, it's not daddy's fault. It's not your fault. Everything's my fault. Daddy never gets angry. Daddy never hits you. Daddy has nice boyfriends and girlfriends. What a daddy. You can't understand that a daddy like that ever put his willie... into a mummy like that. Yuck, stupid daddy. Mieke... Mieke... Valentijn? Valentijn? Valentijn, for Micky. Vitamins. Mr Boecke, you have to wear a coat. I'll call the doctor for you. His fall from the stairs was probably a secondary trauma. Just like you can have a car accident because of a heart attack. Your son has probably had that tumour in his head for years. And suddenly it burst. That's the best way I can explain it. That's why he's in a coma. Did he often have headaches or dizzy spells? Sometimes. Ouch in my head. Eat something. Bear Bob grumbled and waddled through the dark forest. Further and further. Until he almost couldn't see anything. Then he stopped. 'Help, I'm lost', he said. It was bear Bob talking softly. Please. Was he a sweet kid? - He is a sweet kid. He feels warm and soft. He looks like he's shrinking. - He is. He's being fed artificially. That makes him shrink a bit. Don't stay too late. You have to look after yourself too. If anything happens, we'll call you. It was bear Bob talking. He couldn't grumble anymore. Valentijn Boecke speaking. - You had a deadline. You know our deal. This is unacceptable. A deadline is a deadline. So there's no more hope? Humanly speaking not. - What do you mean humanly? Ignore I said that. Your son's dead. Then why is he attached to all those machines and tubes? He's breathing. - We can keep doing this for years. We? You mean Micky can keep doing this for years. No, we can keep doing this for years. Your son has no will anymore. His breathing is our will. Does his mother also have to give permission if... Strictly speaking, nobody can give permission. It's not allowed. But what we're doing now leads to nothing. It doesn't do your son any good. Or you. Pull the plug? Flip the switch? Like that? That's it. You don't have to decide now. Just think about it for a weekend. Yes, we'll just think about it for a weekend. Jerk! This doesn't work, does it? But I thought of everything. See what happens. I'm going home. Bye. Good music, Valentijn. Can I keep it? Mick! Nurse! Nurse, nurse! Nurse, he woke up. He opened his eyes and started talking. He can't talk. He has a tube in his throat. But I heard it myself. There has been no change. Not just now and not in the past hour. Not for weeks... months. Look for yourself. I'm not crazy! We'll always stay together. Shake hands on it. Word of honour. Little blond hero. Does he feel this? Your son's asleep. If we stop the artificial processes, he'll sleep deeper and deeper. He doesn't feel anything. Can't you give him an anaesthetic anyway? If you want. Yes, better do it. Very wise of you, Mr Boecke. One more thing, though. Have you said goodbye? I can't say goodbye. You should. It's better for you. I want to stay with him. We'd prefer not. After we've removed everything, you can be with him. And afterwards you can arrange some practical things with the nurse. I'll do it myself. That's out of the question. You weren't there when I made him either. I'm responsible for him. So can I put him down myself? That's out of the question. It's not wise and it's impossible. But it's what I feel, Mick. It's what I feel. Please go with the nurse. Valentijn, this is useless. Stop it. I don't want to keep any of his things. You can't throw them out. Shut up, damnit! Get lost! Now! Hold tight, kid Mummy Loud, please. Louder, damnit. Louder! Micky had this one with him, that evening. He wanted me to put it in a frame. It's for you. We'll be going 100 kilometres per hour, won't we? - No! You don't need to worry. Nothing can go wrong. When did you learn to tie your shoelaces? A long time ago. It's easy. Easy? Are you saying that all this time... Little asshole. Why didn't you tell me? I liked it when you did it. I love you, little blond... Hold tight.
