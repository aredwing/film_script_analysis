As a kid I watched him play Raghupati in Tagore's "Bishorjon". We might get letters from the Prime Minister's office. Heard he's quite close to him. Arrange for accommodation. We better admit him day after. - Okay. Sir, have you watched his film 'Runaway'? It's about a boy who runs away from home. Fun! Do I have the time to? Only his 'Beyond the Clouds'. He was found lying sloshed, in an alley near the cemetery... ...frothing at the mouth. He has three kids at home. No sense of responsibility! Irresponsible. The overtures of Beethoven's the symphony... I can see it! Dugga will go away. Surge, swell Oh! mighty waves" Smash, shatter as shackles do break... Yonder, a new dawn peeps as souls arise so long asleep. It's all burning! The entire universe... ...so am I! Father, we are leaving. Won't you visit us ? So, you're leaving Dugga. You are taking Satya away from me too? Separation is essential. I will not let you go. Amidst these plains of ends unknown a single cry". "Rents heaven and earth ancient chants... of deep... despair. I will not let you go. A revolutionary war is a people's war. With the help of mass uprisings and only by depending on the mass... ...the war can be continued. "Up and down, the water is moving" "From one side to the other.." "The boat's helm is moving" After a year of the President's rule in West Bengal... ...the United Front government's newly elected Chief Minister... ...spoke of bringing back peace to West Bengal.

I find myself akin to your Nirmala. It's the same story in all households. That was a cakewalk for me. "The bees are playing on the flowers.." "We have no language... no homeland..." "We have no destination... no homeland..." All ok? Please come in. All good? Mrs. Bagchi... the admission form.- Come. Phulmoni...and she's Damini. Your cabin. So this is where the evil which is to be eliminated. The son of Shiva and Parvati shall be born here. How long is my exile here? Quoting from our epic 'Kumarsambhava'. I was thinking of translating it's eighth chapter over here. Mr.Bagchi, you are a talented man. You need to get better. You just have to take your medicines regularly. What is it that ails me Doctor ? Is it the bottle ? That is the symptom. The real reason is something else. - The lad's caught on! So what is the reason? That has to be investigated. Sister! And the procedure of that investigation Doctor? Jung or Adler ? Pavlov or Freud? Please take rest now, we'll discuss all this later. Oh... "so if we're not talking right now, I'll go get some fresh air. You're not going anywhere. No, I promise I'll come back here. I promise. I've loads of work pending. - Mr.Bagchi please... Don't be difficult. Be seated. Give me some money. - No. You will hit the bottle again... you won't come back. This is not your shoot Mr.Bagchi. I am the director here. So my word is final. Sit. So be it! Very stubborn man. Creative as well. Doctor...please take care of him. He's very headstrong. I have no one to fall back on... Don't worry... ...he'll be fine here. Thank you. What happened ? Sir, please see. - What's wrong? She was complaing of regular headaches. No,thank you.. - Let me check your pulse. The headaches are possibly because of stress. Get her to the consultancy. - Come. Been working too hard ? I'm looking for a job... sitting for exams". So I've been studying day and night. She's determined to take up teaching. I don't really earn anything... "but we have many mouths to feed. It's all messed up. You know Dugga... ...our poet Kalidasa was... ...actually illiterate. But the princess? ...fell head over heels in love and ended up marrying him. But after a few days... bullcrap... ...all her love vanished! - Quiet! I know. A distraught Kalidasa... left home in sorrow... ...in pursuit of knowledge. Kalidasa! - I have a headache. After attaining wisdom.. ...when Kalidasa returned home triumphant... ...Princess Viddottama asked him... if he was now her equal, with the wisdom he had gained. What did Kalidasa do on hearing this ? Wrote three entire epics. Dinner is served. Finish it fast. Stop blabbering. And you have not been able to become equal with me. You've made six films.. so many plays and documentaries. Can anyone call you a gentleman? Come! Do you play cards? Twenty nine? We play"- ...everyday. Entertainment. Good morning Mr.Bagchi. Good morning. Let's see... ...did you sleep well last night? That beastly cough troubled me the whole night. It will be better soon, the treatment has just begun. So, how do you like it here? What so different between the world outside and the one inside? Just that a booze den is missing inside, that's it. I realize you've migrated from East Bengal. Can there be two Bengals, East & West? But you're right. Bharenga, Pabna district. So why suddenly Kolkata ? And then People's theatre ? People's theatre! It's so stuffy inside! Intellectuals in politics. Romain Holland. Maxim Gorky. Good morning sir. - Good morning. Why that smirk? So was this coming together of the artists wrong ? It was inevitable. While still in Rajshahi... ...I had felt the heat. My intermediate examinations were going on. Back then we were publishing a magazine. Which one? New Wave. Stories, poetry... I too had some inclination towards politics. It intensified when I was at the Krishnanath college of Baharampur. Radical politics ? Do you expect the agitated populace.. ...to dance the Hula in those turbulent times? Bloody hell. Four million people died from... ...that famine. Bhoba, come ...today we will rehearse all night long. A fire burns without... Whose conch is it that awakens the multitude! Whence echoes these wails of deep despair... From the darkest dungeons... In a speech at the Berlin Sportpalast... German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels... declares a total war against the Allies. In the Soviet Union, the Battle of Stalingrad... comes to an end with the official surrender... Mother, give us food, give us food. Act 1 Scene 4. The court yard of the village head man. No no...no way... Let this bit remain. I won't sell this bit. Rest of it is all gone. Won't sell this bit. They took away all the paddy luring people with money... and now they are after our lands! Tell them, this land is not for sale. Not for sale?! How dare you! You are going back on your word Mr.Headman, You are going back !!! Thrown out from their village, Kunjo and the Head man... ...descend to make a home on the Kolkata footpaths. Act 2 Scene 2. Make way please. Hey! Have you got the dole ? The dole ? I mean that porridge. No. No food. No clothes. No roof. Err.. Mukherjee... Please try to make her smile. Just a bit of smile. Please try... my friend... Smile ! "Fickle tickle... What are you doing ? Let her go. - Leave her! Then I can name the photograph Bengal's 'Madonna.' Leave us alone! - What's going on here? Leave us alone! - You cannot stop our theatre like this! You cannot stop our theatre in this way! Who's there? Which son of a gun ? What's all 'this! This is an unauthorized intrusion. You can check our registers. We have orders. We don't need warrants. Who is there in this cabin here ? - Mr. Bagchi. Nilkantha Bagchi. Cultural activist. Cabin 3. Oh !This drunkard is your inmate too now! So how come you uniformed angels are here for... for a sermon on righteous living in an asylum? Waste of time. Let's check the other cabins. - One minute. Sister. Com e. Come. - Come. You need to pay your way to see an intellectual in a zoo. Pay up you bastards! All your dirty money! Mr.Bagchi, quiet. Relax! Please take rest. So sorry you got disturbed. What got these fuckers so prompt today ? Relax Mr. Bagchi. They must've postered the piss walls with death threats again. So their balls have all shrivelled. They have information... ...a Naxalite is hiding here... ...disguised as an insane inmate. Disguise ? Why do you say 'disguise' ? Only insane people can trade a bright future outside the country... ...to cleanse the shit holes of their motherland! Have some water. Oh my God ! Therefore... ...we got involved. 'We', as in ? 'We' who... ...borrow money for our tea and fags. ...our singing sessions, our theatre... our squabbles. There used to be a cafe in South Calcutta. Thinker's Paradise. That's where we used to sit around... ...rebuilding our nation. We'd talk about change! And then borrow money to get married. As in? Heard about Chandanpiri ? - Yes. Head it in the paper. The peasants are up in arms. Armed uprising! Our relief team has gone there. But there is no news of our men... Mohit, Ramen, Satyabrata, there. What do we do? Shoot at sight orders are on. - Oh no ! Now what Bhoba? What are the leaders of People's Theatre Group saying ? Booking fancy theatre halls as bullets fly there. For them it's art for art's sake. Why will they bother about the poor farmers? Damn fools... Bhoba calm down... So many events in quick succession... second Great war...Indian freedom struggle... black marketing... famine, riots... Now its Kakdwip..Telengana...Naval Mutiny... The people are seething. But what does it all indicate ? What? Change! I'm leaving. Lights !!! Could you switch them off nurse? They haven't seen riots... nor famine... nor war... nor death... fighting within the parliament... So will the very definition of revolution change ? What's that Mohit ? Writing film songs ? No...poetry... will you hear them? Poetry that's not for me... Poetry and me are chalk and cheese. You look frail Bhoba... ...you've changed a lot... ...in the last few years... You look much older. - Yes. These days I cough if I raise slogans. Sudden bouts. Have a perfumed kerchief guys? Doctor's diagnosis ? One side of the river erodes as the other builds. One burns so as to illuminate others. That was the point of our struggle, right comrade ? Ketoki is doing great now as a movie actress Bhoba. So mind it. Shut up... ...what about you guys? Running to Bombay for money? Remember that poem of Salil's ? Stand by in fields, forests and towns.. "Stand by in harbours, woods and grounds... Do you smell something burning? - What's wrong? Aren't you getting a burning smell ? I am! What happened? - Ahalya, Batashi...Sarojini... Uttami... ...they are all ablaze. All abaze! All's aflame. Bhoba, where are you off to ? Listen... Bhoba please. - Bhobha where are you going? Heard the latest? Bhoba's run away from home ? Uncle Bishtu's son Bhoba ? Who else ? Wayward lad... ...he's run off to some place called Kanpur" ...to work in the cotton mills... ...no studies" nothing. Wait, Bhoba. Don't leave. - Bhoba, Bhoba! In the fields, the ports, the cities and villages" prepare! Those snuggling in the eternal darks of their unlit homes.. prepare! Those with hungry stomachs and dried up faces...prepare! This is a call to all the homes in the land, prepare. Unite! Our soil belongs to our soiled hands! Our soil belongs to our soiled hands! Our soil belongs to our soiled hands! Endless clouds of unshed rain.. ...clinging on to the skies in dirge despair... ...as they mourned the denied life. Claiming the child his right to live... ...no seed raised a tiny head No butterfly spread its cocooned wings... Kakdwip was not the same that night. Head the poem ? Was abroad at that time but have heard about it. But why were poor farmer's wives fired upon ? Because they had freed Kakdwip. Which ruler tolerates... free subjects in his rule? Came to Kolkata... ...for higher studies... ...a defeated poet like all good Bengali boys. That smell wafts into the wards and it's harmful for you too. We are fire eaters... ...wouldn't have stubbed it out in those days. Non conformist ? Conform where my boy ? No roots, no encumbrance, just a homeless refugee boy... - Sir... What? - Sir, can we say something? Sir, Bhushon saw someone burning up a book and flee last night. Why.. why burn a book? After that police raid, may be they wanted to make the book vanish. Com plain to the Superintendent. What will I do ? Treat the ill or play hide and seek? What book ? - We can't read the entire thing. Piecing the burnt fragments... ' How to be... ...a Good Communist'. Okay you guys carry on. I will look in to the matter. How did you know the name of the book ? It was our ABC... ...like learning the alphabets. Where are you my dear Boudi (sister in law)? Here comes your tutor. He's completely head over heels. Coming over twice a day to teach. Here we are. Come in. So where's my 'Das Kapital' ? Could I have a cup of tea please ? Really, you've got an angel in your house. You people sit. Got you two new books. It is the language of my protest... It is my dissent's... flame. May it burn twice it's life. If you wish to reach the grassroots in this country... you have to dig into our soil. Just reading Leu Shao Qui won't do. Great activist! Welcome Ma'am. How do you find him ? Good ! Seem happy 101153! 7 That's because the cops came in the morning, called me a drunkard. I've asked Ramen da(brotherly). They live close by. They'll com e. Just a few more days here. You've to recover fast and get back to work now. Don't be late, times are bad. Was behind bars when the party was underground, maybe you've forgotten. You were better off in prison... than with me, in yet another prison. No Doctor... it's apparent... I keep working but I cannot proceed, even if I proceed I cannot finish. Have you progressed with your translation? It was progressing but then an obstacle came by. The Santhal girl in the next cabin... ...she is upsetting it all. Phulmoni ? What's happened to her ? She has gone mute. Got raped by some army personnel in the jungle. In her veins runs the revolutionary blood of.. ...Sidhu and Kanu, leader of Kol and Santhal rebellion. Beware. If they get mad all your state machinery is finished! My state machinery ? Not yours? - No! It never was. This so called independence by stabbing us in the back... ...we never accepted it. never will. And anyway" How on yonder boatman... my broken boat is on the deep deep sea... POW on... row on my boatman... my broken boat is on the deep deep sea... Have seen three of your films. Didn't understand much, but they look like paintings. And what about my thoughts you rascal ? They were also nice... ...but... - ...could not understand. I have understood... I am gratified... now be of some help my understanding rascal? Just say... Can I smuggle in... some booze out here ? The Democratic police force can rape a political prisoner in custody. "Desher Broto" has brainwashed you. Pass on some bucks now, you disgraced intellectual. Right !!! What? What's happening here ? Back to your wards. Where is it? Amazing!!! This is Einstein!!! ...coming out. Long years ago... we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes... when we shall redeem our pledge... at the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom . Hey! Mahatma Gandhi was shot, and killed this evening by a Hindu fanatic. The man who identified himself as one Nathuram, fired a fourth shot, apparently in an effort to kill himself. An infuriated crowd... fell upon the man, and beat him with sticks. Hey! You scoundrel! We assert that after the transfer of power... on 15th August 1947, a section of the left leadership... feel that revolution is just, around the corner and that this freedom is fake. We have to avenge this! The gunned down Haramadhav and Sun. Haruda'a house was ransacked. I can't believe our country is free now! I have a problem with the word 'freedom', Gurudas. Its because of these sarcastic jibes of you people... that Monishonkar da, Rajani da have left our group. Pratap da's theater group is going great guns. These newspapers are having a field day. - Let them! The government doesn't want us in parliamentary politics, right? It's our mistake, we're wrong in insisting that the freedom is false. This is Anarchism. Who are you calling anarchists? The poor farmers of Dongajora or the theatre people? Why are they being butchered? They are getting intimidated by us. I can foresee an uprising. We should carry on with our theatre work. Err.. why don't we.. Rename our Central Squad as our 'Troop Brigade'? Boudi (sisterinlaw) can I get a few mouths of food ? Drink some water, that's what you need first. I'm acting in Samarda's film which is about refugees. Nitai da has called to assist in his shoot On the other hand there is the zonal meet... Listen, we are into politics too. Everyone does. But that is no excuse, for your Vagabond existence. Now go take a bath. " The storm crashes on to the blazing for head" understand? You need a wife. Dugga's from Shillong. I'm her tutor here. They still get trapped ! Your novels are so popular back home. Which ones ? - "Mohakaal", "Dheu","Bhangon" Satyabrata is a genuine people's author, Dugga. Much like you he's been imprisoned for his activism. Tea anyone? Really? Getting paid for drilling sense into wood... tuition.. ...so, trying to repay your debts. Who's the wood? Madan. Give Ma'm a cup of tea. You still owe me for three months. Now you know... studies are fine... ...then you'll realize you're trapped. Some difficult love letters will arrive alongwith a grocery list. Enough. Your tea. That is obvious your friend is a romantic. Romantic, yes. But the love letters wont have any romance. Dimitrov facts and CPO testaments" these will be all. Rascal. What are you looking at? My mother. What a face... what fire. Had made some documentaries, for the Bihar government... Saw them up close. Our true land !!! The original inhabitants. Of course. Unlike us. Uprooted half and halfs, imported intellectuals" Actually we cannot decide... what comes first ? People or theatre ? Is PTG the party festoon ? Yelling "people people" all the time... The theatre workers want to concentrate on theatre Bhoba... ...not meetings, rallies and politics. Why are they herded into regiments? Here. -No. Does anyone care about theater? The lights, the sets, the acting. Tea. You cannot stage plays without a revolving stage. Not enough light, rundown sets" ...no theatre schooling, the discipline is gone. A good play has to look good. - No. It must speak the truth. - You're being impatient Bhoba. Even anarchy has a discipline. You lack that. You're irregular. When you do come, you're busy with your 'truth'! Is that wrong ? Truth is relative Bhoba. Today's truth may be tomorrow's lie. Think about the theatre. It's the same for 'beauty' Shibuda. I say it as we speak of theatre. I can't do theatre for the sake of it. I'm in for people's theatre. But your mass plays, your new fangled drivel, I'm not game. Hence the new play at Srirangom is selling so well and we're a flop. Let it sell. I'm not here to entertain people. Moron! Be it true or beautiful, do we have the ability to write a good play.' The same old hash. Brecht, Chekov, Ibsen. You too are stuck at Shakespeare, Anando. Try something original. Thought of something new, Bhoba? - Yes. I've decided the name too. Anguish. What's the theme? Partition? Refugees? That same old documentary style of plays. No. Suicide. - What! Why ? Why suicide? - Why not? Head the papers those days ? Ripples of suicide in Calcutta. I was writing as the Bengal Correspondent. Thirty one suicides in a city consecutively. And the reason ? Do you have suicidal ideation ? Oh no! Wasn't satisfied by just the article, so I wrote an entire play. It was turning into a good play. Expressionist approach much like Strindberg. Stop these depressing stuff... the audience will reject it. In the morning... was warming some borrowed milk for the little one. The rest... ...the rest hadn't eaten since yesterday. Suddenly Nutu, my third one.. ...came and stood beside me. He loves to eat, you know. But we have never afforded anything fancy. He came before me, said... "Ma.. I want to eat." wicked boy... gave him one whack... next thing I know my Khuki screams... Ma, something is wrong with Nutu! Something is wrong with Nutu! Something is wrong with Nutu! You are glorifying suicide! You are behaving like the Police chief. Are you the secret mole of the Police? Censoring? Whatever we write will be questioned? Is this a free country ? That is how the British police censored 'Nil Darpan' shows. So what's new? Bloody pimp- Come on. Start. I cried. I cried a lot. Sat at my door and wailed.. "And wailed. Is there anyone? Anyone out there who understands my tears ? Is there anyone ? Is there anyone ? Is there anyone ? ...who'd understand those tears ? Bloody scoundrels all... You understood ? - Right ? Because l was a people's artist... that was my job. The rest were just the choicest bastards... ...plain mediocre or CIA's agents! Think about it and tell me. - About what? Why did those news of suicides move you so much ? Because they were just the symptoms. I wanted to get to the root cause. Like you. Hmm... That was? - Poverty, what else? I was only recording the great changes. But the why did your Party oppose you ? Why could you not finish your Gorky play ? Why? You left PTG. - Why? There's no one with you today. No friends, no one. Why.' Because some looked for name, fame, bank balance. Some got depressed and looked away and some went down fighting. Hence. But I.. ...was smelling the gunfire on the streets! "We have no language... no homeland..." All thrown out of their own country. "We have no destination... no homeland..." Grabbing our land now! There is no good, There is no evil. No kith nor kin. Who says to slay is sinning ? When this world is a giant Carnival of killing, Killing in the woods, Killing in the huts, Killing in bird nests, Killing in worm burrows, Killing in vast oceans" Killing in azure skies, Killing to survive, Killing for play, Killing for no reason, Killing unintended... What are you thinking ? Many things... lam unable to tie up the ends. Theatre or films ? Within the party or outside? I being unable to settle down anywhere. You are being chased by your flight of thoughts. They never let you be and that's what I fear. A demonic criminality. A strange madness. What kind of madness? Have you read about the Greek legend of Sisyphus ? King Sisyphus was punished by the Gods, to bear stones all his life. So that his enormous strength, may slowly ebb. Because that was what he needed. His strength made those around him weak. You must chastise yourself. You must control yourself Bhoba. You must simmer down your smoulder. Or else all... will be, scorched around you. What's happened ? The Plays a hit! But Bhoba, all your broad big, exaggerated gestures keep coming back. It's all like only your body is acting, false. But that is what the audience is lapping up. Maybe because in this play" "Raghupati needs to be played with a superficial touch. What are you thinking ? Thinking. How I have begged, borrowed and stolen for a few shows. It is so pointless. How many people have seen them? How much can you tell with so little ? Have you seen De Sica's Bicycle Thieves ? Animesh ...explain it to Bhoba. Listen... Because you do it yourself you don't feel the pressure for profits. Had a producer been breathing down your necks... Correct. - But Cinema ? I know! How long have you been around? Huh !Think about the sheer numbers! Theatre provokes an immediate reaction but that is inadequate. And why are we looking at films as money making machines ? I am fed up of my job as a medical representative. There is a reason why I am tense. Eisenstein, Pudovkin... had access to government funds at a point of time. The rest like Chaplin, De Sica had a problem with funds. Take my example. How much do I earn as an editor ? We can all pitch in, we are the producers. Brilliant! - As in? Is this a joke ? Bikram da l have not fallen in love with films. It is just a weapon for me. And tomorrow... if you get a sharper sword ? Will kick aside movies and go forward. Have you thought Bhoba, what you will work upon? I know him. I had seen him. Still stands the huge city, it's sky scrapped by a jungle of black wires. I had seen him under that sky. In a crowd of thousands of city dwellers... ...another city dweller. How long will your work deal with migrants and refugees ? As long as I can. Because I don't believe in these very terms. Stop labeling people! - But no one saw all that. But that does not prove there is no hardship and sorrow in the world. And what about us ? You've begged and borrowed to make the film. But you couldn't release it. There are others making movies too. They're being shown around the world, getting acknowledgments. And you, going around like a Vagabond. There is no money in the house. Money won't remain Dugga. But my work will. You'll see. Your wife has a complaint... ...you are very whimsical... Which do you prefer Doctor, a slushy pond or... a gushing mountain stream ? I wouldn't have been able to to lead the life of a school teacher. Therefore... ...from poetry to prose to theatre to films. I had a lot to say. This is not me. This is Maxim Gorky. Dinonath has just translated it why will we have to justify this ? Nobody wants to believe you Bhoba. Maybe not today but tomorrow. You all are there, the party is there. - Where is the party? The party has dropped you Bhoba. - What! They say you, Mohit and Anando... You are Trotskyte...Anarchists... Bastards !!! They've also been wary about my relationship with Nilkantha. But Aslam and I... have already sent our justification about the cultural front. What happened to that? That's also missing. What!!! - That is the problem! There is a one-man commission on our new play. Comrade Basu had written a letter protesting on our behalf... ...but... that too is missing. Perfect! So.. we then cannot remain in group theatre anymore. Even if I am not here... ...peoples theatre will remain in me. Feeling very tired Doctor... am off to bed. You are one stubborn man. You must take your medicines regularly Might make you drowsy... - May I come in? Need to talk. About what ? It is a new dawn in Asia. These are a few sunrays. Again at your nonsense ? - Without booze ! Or, I'd abuse too. Please leave. We have work. Work? Jobless idiots! We have information... Ashim Mahato... of Gopiballavpur... ...is admitted here under an assumed name. Conspiring against the state; that's the charge. We have an eye witness. What can I do ? We have permission... ...from the authorities. We have a search warrant. Identification parade. Impossible... This is insane... Come Phulmoni! - Nothing will happen. Nothing will happen, come. - Nothing will happen. Don't be scared. Phulmoni, listen to me! Stand here. Catch her. What's happened ? Identify? I can't find him Sir... Try to remember who you had seen! It was a ghost! All states are prone to imagining ghosts of their traitors. Shut up you nut head! This one's the worst of all the lunatics here! Bastard ! Who's that? - Ramu, from the colony. The hero of many of your films. That 'city dweller' hero of yours. The film never got released. No one ever saw it. I know... Anyway- Where have you been all these days? We all live in No man's land Nil da. Do we have an address ? Right. I too am a refugee now. No country, no group, no friends, no family. Just a drifter... a vagabond. But we will still give birth Nil da. We will writhe in pain. And through that pain... ...will be delivered new life... Not my lines. Yours. Remember? Bloody! Havel ever deceived in my world of thoughts ? Oh no! Police raid sir. Narayan . One of them has been arrested from Debra. Take him in custody today. We'll take him to the court day after. And in the middle of that... Sir... ...road map sir. They had an assassination plan. The target was the police chief Manna. And all you people can see is state violence, Mr.Bagchi. When power speaks so shall the rebel. If there's a state there will be conspirators! Come on! You bloody pimps of China! Narayan! Damini! Damini, calm down. Hey! Damini, be quiet. What are you doing? ...we need to talk. Tell me. Be seated. After all the medication and therapy" ...we've come to a decision about you. That this bugger is a complete scoundrel. He can never ever change. Ism? Your alcoholism, exasperation, all of this has one root cause. Depression. We have to make you survive, you're a creative person. These aren't my words but society's demand. Is the society high on booze? Why so much compassion in such evil times? The dosage which you were given can't be increased. There is toxicity involved. You drank again? I did. I mean couldn't control so... Hence? We have to go for ECT. As in? Electro Convulsive Therapy... ...popularly known as shock treatment. Oh ! Which is a treament I usually practice on others. We will be taking all precautions. But Ma'am, before that you need to sign the risk bond. Madam . Please. The first partition of Bengal, Doctor. Us, Bengalis, who've suffered so much since then... ...can't be hurt further more... ...by this new fangled Western treatment of yours. Com e. Let's go for a walk? Come on. Open your mouth sir. A little wider. Okay. Heady sister? - Yes sir. Surge, swell Oh! mighty waves" Smash, shatter as shackles do break... Yonder, a new dawn peeps as souls arise so long asleep. Surge, swell Oh! mighty waves" Smash, shatter as shackles do break... Yonder, a new dawn peeps as souls arise so long asleep. Surge, swell Oh! mighty waves" Smash, shatter as shackles do break... surge, swell Oh! mighty waves" Smash, shatter as shackles do break... Now try to sit up slowly. Come on. So? You need to get better. You'll have to start writing again, right? My glasses? -Yes. I have finished writing Doctor. It's a new play. Surge, swell Oh! mighty waves" Now the rehearsals. Smash, shatter as shackles do break... surge, swell Oh! mighty waves" Smash, shatter as shackles do break... How are you doing today ? Broken.. ...but... ...not beaten. Head the play ? - Yes I did. Why suddenly mental patients ? Who is not a mental patient, Dugga ? Is everyone sane ? So Doctor, don't you get government funds for this place? We do. Cultural development fund. Will you be able to Manage with this health ? And that too with the inmates ? You still have a few more ECTs to go through. How many volts per cycle Doctor ? About volts. A thousand volts play around in this brain of mine Doctor. Your therapy tickles me. May I? - Please start. We... plan to stage a play in this hospital. Here you go, Jack. Ace! Its all mine. - How come? This one.. Leave it. - Silence please. Mr.Bagchi is saying something. We all, live in the heart of this city. But we are all refugees... You don't know much. - I know.. ...on the fringes of society. Marginalized. I did right. Can we never get back to the mainstream ? See what he did ? - Amalesh! Aren't you supposed to give the cards? We know our pluses and minuses, our notoriety. Is this right? - Shut up. I'm not playing. But shall we be defeated ? - What is this Amalesh! Kartik da. - You are creating all problem. Kartik da! Where are you off to? Tridib! - Where are you off to? - If not today then someday. We will not be defeated! We can do it. We will prove it that we still stand by the working class. Damini! - Silence. Mr. Bagchi! Silence. Shanti visualizes these grills as slithering snakes. And this huge lock... the face of Goddess Kali. Her tongue sticking out. Stop laughing- Why are you laughing like a lunatic? - Once the delusion fades... ...Shanti becomes the soul of my Bengal. The slayer of all evils. And then the celebration of the Mother Goddess, her tempest dance. Phulmoni? Phulmoni will dance. Our Phulmoni? - Yes. Impossible! She won't be able to do it. Mr. Bagchi. Yes? - You will have to come with me once. Sorry. I had to stop you. Sorry? Okay, let's go. - Come. Dad.. - Who is it? Ramakanta again? No, I'm Shubho, from your film, 'Runaway'. I've run away from home. Here, Keshto uncle's Gram Fritters, want some? Let's run away Bhoba. Where to? - To the bank of the Padma river. Pabna. No, I'm not coming along. Don't you know I'm being treated with shock therapy? I know. I am too weak to walk. - I have brought us a car. Want to see it? What are you saying! Car! There, the master is standing, Parimal, the loony. Come on. Master, he will go to Pabna. - When? Right now. Twenty. Making a kill as we are in a spot? We won't go, won't see Pabna. Okay fine. We'll give you twenty rupees. Let's go. Let's go Jagaddal. The flower of pearl, the flower of pearl! It is very far! Your son sent flowers from the banana plant, The trees have borne fruits. Let's go. Let's leave the roads, let's go to the river. Hurry, hurry! - Hey you! Hey ! You stole my boat. You've set it afloat. You scoundrels! Hey! Parimal Master ! No he's our Fritters man, Krishnadas. What happened to you? Someone's home. They set it ablaze in the '46 riots We are a nation with our own distinctive culture and civilization, "We have no language.." "We have no homeland.." "We have no direction.." "We have no homeland.." "We have no direction.." "We have no homeland.." I propose a two nation theory. Bhoba! - Hey, it's you Ratan! Where's Gita, your friend? Uncle Jagadish's sister? She went missing. During the riot. It's her I've been Looking for. Bagdibou Koikeyi, my mother, all have gone missing. Can you help me find my mother Bhoba? Come on. Come on. My prayers remain unfinished. My prayers remain unfinished. I could not say my prayers. I could not say my prayers. My prayers remain unfinished. I could not say my prayers. My prayers remain unfinished. Know the name of the river, Bhoba ? Subarnorekha! Gita.. you ! Yonder is the station" ...there sits Jagadish da with the station master, let's go see. Come on. Jagadish, the Dwandakaryonno Express just left packed with refugees. All from East Bengal, they dumped two aged women from the train. Ok. - One is dying. I believe they are from Bikrampur, from your village, Kheyadaho. Oh is it. - Yes, last stage. Even the Medical Officer failed. There's no hope. Bagdibou! Bagdibou! What's wrong? - A low caste woman is dying. My mother! Bagdibou! "We have no language.." "We have no homeland.." "We have no direction.." "We have no homeland.." "We have no direction.." "We have no homeland.." Only a few more days. I know it's tiring you but... "this time it's a long term plan. A short circuit has happened in the metre box Doctor. Will there be light ever again? Your integrity, motivation.. has all that vanished? Did I ever possess those? Or was all of it only... ...defence? "Wherefore rejoice... ...what conquest brings he home... ...what tributaries follow him to Home" in captive bonds of cha.. Sorry. How are you Bikram da? I'm good. How've you been? Walking the red carpet everyday. From one country liquor shop to another. Everybody's films flop Bhoba. - How many films? How many? "Pain" A car and it's driver. A story about their simple love. No one understood! Children's literature. A kid who ran away from home. No one bothered to see it! How long shall I hear the echoes of my own... "tiring screams in my own dreams? Could you tell me? So then you will give up Bhoba? Don't you have any contribution in this fate of yours? You mean I didn't try'? - You weren't consistent. Your first Hindi story won awards You quit the job in Filmistan to join theatre here. You started off with the play but you didn't finish it. - Fimistan! You wrote scripts, left them to rot. The shoot started but didn't finish. Are you decisive at all? You're displeasing everyone Bhoba. Friends. Producers. Governmental offices. Newspaper offices. Even family. You know why? My pen and I are one and the same. What are you thinking? About Rabindranath Tagore. He's written so much, thought about so much. He is so enlightened. Dugga" ...why did he write that Poem all of a sudden? Death, you're equal to my nights. I don't know. Will I finally lose? Will l flee? Traitor? What nonsense are you speaking? I feel really angry at times. I feel like finishing myself off. The epic character Karna(in Mahabharata)" ...was born with innate truth. And you ? You were born with innate purity. I'm not flattering you. Just analysing. Over days, the way I feel about nature, is changing. Earlier I was prone to feeling it from the depth of my heart. And now, all I'm interested in is how to steal it's beauty. You're like the Autumn. Always childlike but always serious. The girls here are very simple. They have a natural rhythm in them. Whenever I see them, they remind me of you. It's this simplicity of yours that has still held our household together. Love. Nilkantha. Let's say... ...this is a mental hospital ward. This is the first time we get to know about Shanti's illness. Damini, ready'? Where's Kartik? Kartik. Hey Kartik! - Here Mr. Bagchi. Make up? Hey! Quiet! You're Shanti's husband who is ill. Your factory has been locked down. Kidding me here, with that kerchief around your neck? It's my habit from childhood. I stay a bit neat and clean. Shut up! Pick up the habits of your character shedding of your own! Come on. - Come on, Shanti. Where are you taking me? I won't go. Come out Shanti. - Leave me! Sir. Shanti... She will die. Nothing will happen, this is just a play. It's all a set up. Fake. It's fake? -Yes. It's fake? Oh no! Blood! My head is bleeding! No, thats not blood. That's your vermillion. Vermillion! But that's something Indian married women wear. Will you burn me to death? Amalesh! Get lost! Get lost! Com e. Let's go sit in that chair. Who are you? I? I'm your friend. Friend? - Yes. You're really a friend? - Hmm. Son, what is the character? A Doctor. There should be an integrity. You should look upright and confident. Look at our Doctor. You're constantly stammering. Does a psychiatrist wear an apron? Do you have to make him wear an apron to prove he is a doctor? Yes, that I have to. I want to see an archetypal doctor Ramen da. Even though it's unreal. Because that's what people think, that's how they recognise a doctor. The people are the priority. Your health has deteriorated. Leave that. What news of the party? Forget it. You already know, everything has shattered. On one side there's too much compromise. A part of the group is preaching" ...co-existence participating in the government. And the other side is living on the edge. Terrorism. Corner the city with villages! Will you stop dwelling on this same question again and again? Ramen da. Will you please sleep a bit? Sleep? Did I take birth to sleep Dugga? Why art suddenly? For the betterment of the mass. This is where Russians are correct. That's what I felt after meeting them. The artists of our country don't know their country well. Whose betterment will they think about? You're right. Only Mr.Arijit Hay. His 'Pather Gaan', 'Aparajeo, marvelous. Let's see if he can keep it up. Thank God he got awards abroad, otherwise... Here, gulp it down. - No, I can't take the smell. The intermediate stage between capitalism and socialism is... ...alcoholism, Bagchi. Here take it. The last shelter of the intellect. Drink it down. Scoundrel! If I ever touch this thing again! I have information... ...some of our unit members drink behind our back. Why.' What is their problem? To endure the hardships of life? And here we're trying to build a group of activist artists. From tomorrow no one shall touch alcohol in the shoot or the edit. Let's see. Let's see. "I am in love." "I am in love." "I am in love." "With my beloved." "I am in love." "I am in love." "The reflection of my beloved is wonderful." "The reflection of my beloved is wonderful." "I am greedy seeing it." "I am in love." "I am in love." "I am in love." Ma, brother is home. I told you not too but you still came late. Where is Khuki Ma? She is my elder daughter. She has supported everyone. She is untouchable. So have you fallen in love at such a ripe age? What are you hiding? Love letter? Let me see! "I am in love." What happened Dada? Why are you so restless? Khuki has got T.B. Terminal stage. She's been ill for so long, none of you understood? What not has she done for us! I accuse. - Whom? No one. No one at all. Cut. Aunt, where's the tea? - Good news Boudi. 'Beyond Clouds' has set the market on fire! Here see. Yes, I've heard. - But didn't you guys say... ...it's too sentimental. Won't work. Mr. Bagchi's new film 'Beyond Clouds' fills our heart... ...up with compassionate colours of life. Nice, see what the poet. "Krishna Sen has to say. - Yes. "This is what the masters call the personification of tragedy". Anyway- May be this tragedy shall wash away our tragedy. That could have been the turning point. That was the only time I passed. You could say, the great mother archetype had worked. After that I failed miserably. Why? Why do you say you failed? Have you heard the song, 'Don't swing with the spring'? Yes I have. Very nice song. 'What if this path never ends?' this song? Yes. I've seen that film too. A very favorite film of mine. Bengal's favorite pair starred in it after all. At that time a couple of my films released too, did you see them? Partition, people residing in colonies, these were the subjects. Thus. I did not even get the pass marks. Bye Doctor. I have rehearsals. Give it to me. I mumbled as I walked around. Will I tell you about the dream? I mumbled as I walked around. Will I tell you about the dream? A whitewashed house. Azure blooms in the garden. Green meadows and orange rocks, amidst all of it my little one. Toddling towards me. I used to sing him lullabies. The little mouse is scared..what if the eagle. Just him and me, behind us a row of coconut trees. A gurgling stream rushes past in a hurry. My reverie... Useless! This is not working at all. Do you realize the significance of Shanti in this play ? She may be ill, but she is a mother and that is paramount. I need to see that mother in you. Now take it from the top again. Imported. Won't suit me then. You're developing a mother obsession. Jung's mother complex. Get out of it Bhoba. - Yes, I'm obsessed with it. As I believe this mother archetype is.. ...woven in our unconscious for centuries. And it will motivate a change. I do not agree. Analyse Bharat's (playwright) "Principles of theatre"... ...all folk and traditional forms of India". 'jatra' , 'noutanki' , 'tam ash a'... There is always a mother figure. - We're students of Dialectics. I know. - Motivation is the class struggle. No. Genetics has a role to play too. Our religious ways, our history. - So... ...is religion your new opium? You're well aware I'm a nonbeliever. Gods don't suit me. Rubbish! You're messing around with religion and God these days. Forget it. You guys are too set in your own ideas. No thanks, he's supplying imported smokes. "The rain." "The clouds of rains have arrived." "The lovely rains, impressing the mind." "The lovely rains, impressing the mind." "The rains have com e." Dada was right. Whether it's books or films... ...nobody is interested in tales of hardship. But endure they all will in their realities. Boring. Monotonous. They're so eager to suffer. But the moment you speak up... ...they will all disappear! Repetitive. By the way, there's a good news. An old friend from college, Suren. Bumped into him today. That same old story. Com e, let's leave. - Bastards. Watched my movie? -Yes. You're not being able to rise above your shanties and shackles. Do you feel the same? It's very important to understate the melodrama in your art. Don't you find your dialogues superfluous? Too many moments, too many raw incidents. Really? Actually you're not being able to break away from the theatre mould. Coincidences at every step. What about the narrative? Its not working. - Uneven. Rough. Your frames are disorganised. Edit jerks. Mr. Bagchi, what's happening? Bye You put all your hard earned money into your film ? What could I do? What can I do if my producer runs away? All that you earned from the British Tobacco commercial... "invested it all in the film? And your family? What about them? Then the film would not have happened. In spite of the humiliation, I took up office plays for the money. And look at you. What are we Bikram da ? Intellectuals or... ...entertainment experts ? Have some money to spare? "Life... ...is but a walking shadow... ...a poor player... ...that struts and frets his hours upon the stage... ...and then... ...is heard no more" 30,110 you guys... ...watch cinema? Days that we get good money picking pockets, we do. I've seen "Kashmir ki kali", "Sangam" . We are Shammi Kapur fans. Don't mind brother, we don't understand your films. So we don't watch. What's new in that? No one understands. Does any son of a bitch out here understand movies at all? That I don't know but... ...all I understand is that... you understand. You do. I? -Yes. How do you know that? You're just like us. Living off the streets. What's that? Gram seeds ? Mr.Nirodh had come over. He was planning a documentary by you on Ustad Alam Khan. He's given up on that plan. Came to convey the news. Give it. Who is it? Minu, are you home? Is everything okay Nil da? Can I get some food ? Have been drinking since morning on an empty stomach. Come inside. Please come inside. Sure you had enough? Yes. You all carry on. Go sleep. I will doze off there. And listen. You have those long playing records of Tagore songs, right ? Leave them here. You are very sad, isn't it Nil da? You put in your best We all worked so hard. But then the people rejected it. In such times... ...always rem ember Tagore. "Losing faith in humanity is a sin". Whatever happens, I will make a film again. Leave the records and go. Go! Okay. "In happiness and in sadness, within a heavy heart..who.." ".. is playing the flute" "Who is playing flute throughout my being" Fidel Castro has launched a revolution from ...his camp in the Sierra Maestra mountains. Adolf Eichmann, one of the members of the Austrian Nazi party... "In happiness and in sadness." "..within a heavy heart..who.." Yuri Gagarin the Russian astronaut ventured into space on his orbital flight. While riding in an automobile procession in Dallas, ...firing from an upper floor of a building. John F Kennedy was shot to death by an assassin... "Who is playing flute throughout my being" "North Korea had seized US navy ship Pueblo, all on board have been taken prisoner as American spies. On the first day of celebration of the lunar year, Vietnams most important holiday, the Vietnamese Communists launched a... "Feeling the rhythm of blossoming flower, the soul and body feels complete" "What a beautiful fragrance.." "..is afloat in the air" "Who is playing flute throughout my being" Why do you move away... ...from the sunshine, from it's heat? You fear to break away, It's not a material success. Seek like the waves do. Or sink into the transparent heart like does the mirror. How are you Narayan ? Who are you? -A drunkard. He is quite a well known man. A man with no politics. Where are you? Listen . The Party Secretary himself called me and said... ...Nilkantha... ...you're the only people's artist in the country. I'm dropping this year. Won't sit for the exam this year. Couldn't even pay off the maids this year. It'll be fine. Chitramohan Pictures owes you money. When are going to ask for.. Yes... err... You don't matter. You may go. But I will stay back. I want to know. Where do you get the motivation to fight? See, we're expecting a police attack any moment. Don't you know there's an operation going on here. But still I will stay. There's nothing more left in this Bengal of mine. It's only you guys who're twinkling in this darkness! Partisans All films are political as all art is... ...and all artists are. The point is which side you take. Sir, which side did you take, when you moved to Filmistan for writing... ...commercial Hindi films? Or while you did an ad film for a cigarette brand? Is it true that you're being commissioned a documentary... ...featuring the Prime Minister of the country? You're feelings are perceptive. The vow of self sacrifice mesmerizes me but... ...you guys have been misguided. Like the agitated ones from the Reign of Terror. Don't talk rubbish! Have you read anything? Red Book, Guevera's diary, CPO report? Why are you interfering without reading all this? Have you guys read the history of India? How many thousand years does it stand? The history of oppression and deprivation? And the history of serious philosophical thoughts. To uproot those oppressions and deprivations... ...you've to read it, know it. And then we'll have to rot ourselves drinking to death, right? Bloody Nihilist! A young boy struck by a bullet. He could be a student or a farmer. He falls on the earth. He bleeds profusely, the blood that the earth sucks on. Tearing apart the heart of that soil, rose a Vietnam. I fake. I pose of being displeased too. I lie too, for the money for my alcohol. But... ...for name, fame and recognition... ...I won't ever lie. Is this a pose too? You've learnt to trick men pretty well. He's caught me! But I tell one thing honestly... MN] ...confused. Utterly confused. Brother! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Praise the Goddess Durga! Did you lose yourself or did you run away? What do you think? It's difficult to tell. I can't really decipher you. Don't even try to. I'm a ball of fire, Doctor. You'll burn your hand. Our play's climax, as in.. how we are looking at it. Shanti is recovering from her illness, her delusions are clearing out. The tempest dance! Phulmoni, come here! Com e. Come sit. Come on. So, won't you dance dear? Mr. Bagchi, I think Phulmoni won't be able to, leave her. Definitely she can. It won't happen if she does not dance. Go! So... won't you dance? Sound! The grills are turning into black snakes for Shanti, Phulmoni. And this huge lock is transforming into Goddess Kali. A tempest everywhere! Blood all around! Horrifying The earth is shaking! Death is embracing itself! Amidst that one has to Break away, set sail on ...on a new sea shore! The guard tolls the bell, orders are here! The bondage of the port has been unleashed for good! The old saving out on sail, no more! Lights off! Nothing is happening! But why not? Look here, we are all insane here, all crazy. But, if that insanity" But if that insanity isn't released, will any creation happen? No! Nothing! -You need to take rest. Go back to your cabin, you need to sleep. No. Bhusan, Bhusan!- Yes! I won't. I'm awake for the first time... and all before have been decades of mean sleep Take him away. - Leave me you scoundrel! Please calm down. - Mr. Nilkanth, please calm down. I'm awake! Leave me you scoundrel! I am awake! I am awake! - Please calm down. - I am awake! - Nilkanth! This won't do. This won't work. I need alcohol. Nothing can happen without it. Give me some money. I need a bottle. Dugga... Give me some money. I'll get myself a bottle. I'm not being able to work without it. Give me some money. Please, get me a bottle. My brain's not working, trust me! Please give me some money! - There is no money! Do you have any idea how I'm affording this hospital? Bringing up the kids, the household... ...where is the money coming from? You don't care about anything! Only your alcohol! Look at yourself! You're perishing! I know! Everything is burning out within me! It's all burning away. Just give me one bottle! Just one bottle! A little bit of money. Fine, this is the end. I'll never get you admitted again. I'll not say anything. Please listen, I'll quit drinking, once this play is done. There's another good news. - What is it? The results are out. I've got a teacher's job at a primary school near Shithigram. I'm leaving... ...with the kids. What about me? Don't you know what will happen if you drink again? Why have you been brought here? I can't work! "The mango trees are decorated.." "..the wedding is happening under the banana tree" "The handsome groom has arrived.." "..with the wedding crown on his head" Hope you are fine, Sister. "The mango trees are decorated.." I'm leaving, Baba. Let's go. -God bless you. "..The wedding is happening under the banana tree" Mother. Where's your father? Inside. Come on. Nothing can happen in this house. What was wrong with the film institute's job? You were doing good with your students and films. Why did you quit? I feel claustrophobic stuck at one place for too long.. What the hell do you keep writing all day? Will I write accounts? I have finished seven scripts. -Not one has been made into a film! No one reads them, neither pays money. Look at your friends. Is anyone of them like you? Can you find anyone lazing around in that cafe anymore? Hey Bagchi, come! Come! Let's have a couple of pegs? - No, I'm carrying my own. What took you so much time? Two groups of communists were fighting in front of Shahid Minar. The third power has declared the formation of a new party, you see. Why suddenly today.' After so many days? What's the date today.' 1st May. I need some money. That's why l came. I read your novel 'Jathor'. In the newspaper. Quite a... Sleazy Crap I'm a pimp if I'm writing about human feelings. Writing about relationships means getting purchased. Whose feeling? Whose relationships? And who is publishing all of it? The 'partisan thing' is not selling anymore Bagchi. You rascal!
