 

                        1 Hollywood extra is coming to you live from the red carpet for the world premiere of Alex Allen's "heart full of wind." Now let's hand it off to Jeremy Mitchell, who's in the middle of all the star-studded action. Thanks, Michelle. What an exciting night! Every celebrity in Hollywood must be here. And look, here comes America's sweetheart, miss Alex Allen! Alex, congratulations on the premiere of your new film, "heart full of wind." Tell us what made you want to make this movie. Well, I love romance. "Heart full of wind" tells the story of two lonely people who are afraid of opening up their hearts, but they learn to trust each other and love one another for who they really are. And your co-star in this film, of course, your very handsome boyfriend, Mr. Colin hartling. Now, we have heard rumors that there's trouble in paradise. Any comment? Oh, you know how rumors travel in Hollywood, so let me set the story straight. Colin and I are very much in love. Uh-huh, so where are you hiding him tonight? Well, he's right... Well... He was right here a minute ago. Excuse me. Sure. As you can see, Alex Allen... Alex! Alex, Alex, right here! Hi. Sorry to interrupt. Alex, you know Rebecca havercroft. Of course. How are you, Rebecca? Alex. We were just discussing the possibility of me being in Rebecca's next picture. Oh! Really? I think Colin is wonderful in your little movies, Alex, but I'm sure he'd like to try some serious acting sometime, too. Excuse me a minute. She's adorable. May I? So, as I was saying... Go find your own co-star. What did you do that for? Oh, come on. Like she was really just interested in you for your acting? You don't think I'm a good actor? Colin... Let's not do this here. No, you know, maybe it's time I moved on. To what? Before you started dating me, you were making dog food commercials. And now I'm a star. You know, I don't need you anymore, Alex. What? Wait. Are you breaking up with me on the red carpet? Goodbye, Alex. Colin, you said you loved me! Guess what... I was acting! We still love you, Alex! Alex, Alex... All the world's a stage... And all the men and women are merely players. At least, that's what our friend Mr. Shakespeare said. What he really means is that we all play roles. We have our public faces, the faces we share with our friends and family, and then we have the one true private face, the face we only share with ourselves in the mirror. Yes, David? What if you don't like what the mirror says? Sorry, I can't help you out there, David. My specialty is English. All right, guys, remember your homework for tomorrow. Chapter eight. See you tomorrow. Courtney! Oh! Hi, Dennis. Actually, it's David. I was... Okay. Whatever. Do you want something? Yeah, um... I was just wondering, since the prom's coming up, and I was just wondering if you wanted to go... With me. Me? With you? You mean, together? Yeah. I already have a date. Oh. Yeah, so... Right, yeah. Um... Well, maybe I'll see you there, then, okay, right? Yeah. Right. Or maybe not. That went well. Shut up, watts. Look, Rogers, no pressure, but there's only a week until prom. So who's left on your list? Nobody. Courtney was the last one, and... This has been a disaster, watts. I mean, I've asked every girl in school, and they've all said no. What am I going to do? Hey, why do you even want to go to the stupid prom, anyways? It's just an archaic ritual designed to force us to conform to society's expectations for the rest of our lives. It's also the last chance I have to make a mark at this school. And that is important why? Because for the last four years, nobody at this school has paid any attention to me at all. Aw, thank you. I mean, you had to. I mean, we've been friends since first grade. Come on, I'm talking about everybody else. To them, I don't even exist at this school. I want to be remembered for something more than just... Being... me. Look, I hate to break it to you, Rogers, but I don't think having Courtney Cornell or any other member of her bubble-head brigade on your arm is going to do anything. In fact, we are so far down the social ladder in this school, that taking a movie star like Alex Allen to the prom wouldn't even help. - Heidi watts? - What? You are brilliant! I'm afraid to ask why. I'm going to invite Alex Allen to the prom! Great. And look, here comes America's sweetheart, miss Alex Allen! Alex! Congratulations... - Gentlemen. - Hey. Mr. Walsh. ...on the premiere of your new film, "heart full of wind..." Remember tomorrow's homework, David. I don't want to hear that your dog ate it again. Hey, Mr. Walsh! Wait up! You're good with words, right? I like to think so. Well, I'm having a little bit of trouble writing something. What kind of writing? Oh, a promposal. A what? You know, like a formal invitation to the prom. Ah... prom. Proposal. Prom-posal. That's very clever. Right? Except I'm kind of having a hard time with it. I want it to sound romantic, but not too... Mushy. Well, the first thing I would do is make an observation about your object of affection that no one else can. Something... insightful, but not too... Creepy stalker-ish? Yes, exactly. Right. Can... Can you keep a secret? Yeah? No way, this is you! In my prior life. I wasn't always an English teacher, you know. I didn't know you wrote poetry! It's not exactly something I want to spread around the school, but... Maybe it will give you some inspiration. Thanks, Mr. Walsh! Good luck with that promposal. Mr. Walsh! Did I hear you mention the prom? Uh, yes. Was just helping out one of the kids. Mm-hmm. Well, as your fellow prom committee member, save me a dance. Hollywood starlet Alex Allen has a red-carpet meltdown, and it's all caught on tape! Are you breaking up with me on the red carpet? Goodbye, Alex. Colin, you said you loved me! So, Meghan, what do you think? Is this the end... Alex? You never know, Brian. Hollywood is always... Alex, honey, you can't stay in here forever. Why? Nobody cares about me. I do. You have to. You're my publicist. I am also your best friend, and you're Alex Allen. You're a huge movie star. You've got the number one romantic comedy in the country right now. Yep, I can fall in love on-screen, but every romance I've ever had ends in disaster. Okay, so you've had a few bumps along the way with the men that you've dated. No, Paige... I haven't dated them, they've dated me, and only because I'm famous. Nobody wants me for who I really am. That is not true. You have millions of fans out there who love you just the way you are. Oh, yeah? Have you checked the Internet recently? "Alex Allen, a star has fallen." "Alex Allen, is it really over?" "Alex Allen... Has America's sweetheart gone sour?" We can fix this. We just need to get a little bit of good publicity going, that's all. Mm. Wait a minute. Have you seen this? What? It's a video message to Alex Allen. It's been viewed 800,000 times. Let me see that. Hi, Alex! My name is David Rogers. I'm 17, and I'm a senior at j.W. Hughes high school in Arlington heights, Illinois. Would you go to the senior prom with me? You're probably wondering why you should even consider this. I mean, you don't know me, and I don't know you, right? But there are some things about you i think I do know. You walk in beauty like the morning sun, arising with the hope of love. Your heart beats with the passion of your courage, the strength of your determination, and the gentle kindness of an ageless soul. Ageless! You are to me a dream made real, one from which I hope to never awake. So what do you say, Alex? Will you take a chance on me and be my date to the prom? Well, what do you think? I think it's cute. Send him a signed photo or something. Cute? Alex, this kid is exactly what we need! Paige! I'm not going to this kid's high school dance. I didn't even go to my own prom! Think about the publicity. "Hollywood star attends prom with boy from the Internet." It's halfway across the country! Exactly. It's the perfect way for you to reconnect with your public! Vanessa hudgens did it, Taylor swift did it, and they got some serious press. It's going to make me look desperate. Well, no offense, Alex, but ever since your performance on the red carpet, offers haven't exactly been rolling in. The answer is no. Oh, ho! Look at that. It's my agent, probably calling with an offer for my next movie. Hey, Eddie. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm? Okay, well, thank you. I'll just have to think about it. Talk to you later! So, was it an offer? Yes, actually... A commercial... For dog food. Oh... Where does that kid live? Mom, I told you, I'm going gluten-free. It helps me focus in class. I'll remember that. So? Anything? I broke a million hits last night. But? Still no response from her. Honey, has it occurred to you that Alex Allen is a very busy Hollywood movie star, and she doesn't have time to look at every single thing that someone posts about her on the Internet? Mom's right, you know. She's a somebody, and you, you're basically a nobody. Thanks. Devyn... Just trying to keep things real. If you ask me, this whole thing has been a waste of time. Now, if you had monetized the site, made it pay per view... I'm not trying to make money from this, Devyn. I just wanted a date to the prom. Oh, I'll get it! Who's Heidi going with? Oh, she's not. She says it's an archaic ritual designed to force us to conform to... Something. I worry about Heidi. Good morning! Who was it, Devyn? Help me clean up. Mom, fix your hair. David, wipe the milk off your chin. Are you really wearing that? You look like a child! Why? What's going on? Alex Allen is at the front door. Are you sure this is the right place? This is the address. Told you we should have called ahead. And take away the element of surprise? That's what we want. That's how things on the Internet go viral, Alex. Real reactions from real people. Hi! Uh, I'm... Alex Allen! And you must be David. I'm David. Well, this is my publicist and manager, Paige Sumner. Hi, David. It's nice to meet you. Good, and you? I'm the witty but adorable younger sister, Devyn, and this is our mother, the warm and caring Catherine. I'm Catherine. How do you do? Well, you're Alex Allen. I guess you do just fine! Okay! Uh, well, anyway, David, I obviously saw your wonderful video online. I was very touched. You were? So, if the invite still stands, I would love to go to prom with you. Wait! Let's try that again. Alex, you're kind of blocking yourself a little, so let's try it again, but this time with a bit more emotion, like you're really thrilled to be here. Okay. Um, David, if the invitation is still open, I would love to go to prom with you. Perfect. Oh, and here he is at his middle school graduation ceremony. He still had his braces then. I used to cut his hair. Not sure what happened to his bangs there. Seriously, I don't think Alex wants to see all this stuff. Actually, I think it's very sweet. You were an adorable little boy. Well, I think I should warn you, that didn't carry into high school. My brother isn't exactly Mr. popularity. Devyn... Just keeping things real, mom. Now, I would like to get interviews with each of you for Alex's various social media accounts. Just something short about what it means to have Alex in your house today... If that's all right with you, Mrs. Rogers? Hey, honey, I'm late for work. Grabbing the paper. I think we should review the interview questions beforehand. We should also discuss a contract for David. Uh... Catherine? Catherine? What's with all the people out there? What's with all the news cameras and reporters? Did somebody... She said yes? Okay, we've got a problem here. Why? I thought we wanted the publicity? We do, but not from that pack of wolves out there. They don't want a human interest story, they're just looking for a scandal. How did they find out you were here? I might've tweeted it... Just a little. Okay, we need to get you out of here. Good luck. They've got the place surrounded. - You... - Heidi. Yeah, sure. What size do you wear? Okay, it's clear. Um, Alex? I just, um... I really wanted to say thank you. The truth is, I never really thought you'd say yes. No problem, and you know what? I think it's going to be a great prom. Yeah... Yeah, it is. Come on, come on... There's got to be a signal somewhere. I knew I shouldn't have left L.A. Oh, no! Oh, no! Did I kill her? Is she dead? Oh, my gosh... Are you all right? I'm so sorry. Uh... Yeah, I'm... I'm fine. Fortunately, I landed on my pride. I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry. It's my first class. Um, maybe we should call you an ambulance? Oh, no, no. No, no ambulance. I'm cpr-certified! Honestly, I'm okay. Oh... Mr. Walsh, are you going to flunk me over this? Because if you flunk me, my dad will never let me get my license as long as I live. Well, Andrea, maybe we should ask your victim here, miss, um... Alex... andra. Uh, Alexandra molinsky. Well, miss molinsky, what do you think I should do? Well, I think Andrea here just needs to learn from her mistake and try again, with a zero body count from now on. Well, I can't let you get away with this without some kind of punishment. You know what, I'll walk home. Bye. That was a bit harsh. She lives at the end of the block. Is there anything I can do for you? Call you a cab or... Why don't I give you a lift? How about some music? Uh, sure. ...showers this weekend. In entertainment news, the town is buzzing with the arrival of Hollywood star Al... Maybe not. I know. I look vaguely familiar to you. You feel like you've seen me someplace before. It's funny how I have that effect on people everywhere I go. It's just something about my face. Actually... You have leaves in your hair. I was wondering whether or not I should tell you before you get out of the car. It's a... It's a nice face, though. Thank you. So you're staying at the hotel. What brings you to town? Nothing special. Just visiting. Where from? Out of town. It's beautiful country there. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude. It's just been a weird day. Near-death experience and all... Oh, there's my hotel. Well, thank you for the ride. Look, I know we started off on the wrong foot. Actually, I was off both feet. Maybe I could make it up to you, buy you a cup of coffee or something? I know this quiet little cafe over on the next block. You really don't recognize me, do you? I don't think we've met before. You're definitely somebody I would have remembered. Have you ever seen any of the starlight falls movies? I don't get to the movies much, I don't even own a TV, but if you recommend them, I'll check them out. Are they popular? Wow, you must've been hiding under a rock for the last two years. Actually, I, um... I was stationed in Baghdad. Army communications officer. Got back a year ago. I guess I've missed out on a couple things, huh? Nothing important. Where's that cafe? Thank you. Here you go. One decaf soy vanilla latte. Thank you. And... I brought you this. Figured it was the least I can do after I almost ran you over. Well, technically, you didn't do the running over. Well, Andrea is my student, so I'm responsible. We'll call it an apology cookie. Actually, I don't, um... Cookie accepted. So what were you saying? Uh... Anyway, when my dad passed away a year ago, my mom was all alone, and I'd finished my service and got an honorable discharge... Came home and started teaching. That takes us up to this afternoon and the pavement. How about you? Um... Indiana. That's where I'm from... Originally. And now where? Don't you think it's just way more interesting when you don't know everything about a person? A woman of mystery. No, it's just... These days, everybody wants to know everything about everyone. I don't want to know about everyone... But I would like to know a little bit more about you. Oh, this is so good. I can't remember the last time I had a cookie. And then I put it on the Internet and waited. I never really thought she'd say yes... Oh, no... And there we have it, folks... Wow. Whoa, wha... That's one way of getting to know you better. I... I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me. No, no, no apology necessary. I've got to go. Thanks again! Wait... Alexandra! Thank you! Goodbye! Hey, it's me. Where have you been? I have been calling you for an hour! Phone died. Another one? Mm-hmm. You missed the kid on TV. Oh, I saw him. He was... good. Yeah, he was. We should get some positive bump from that. Oh, and we have a meeting with the principal at the school tomorrow. I just kissed some guy. What? Who? Mr. Walsh. Who is Mr. Walsh? He's a driver's ed teacher. What are you doing kissing strange men? Have you lost your mind? He isn't strange. He's nice. Handsome too. I don't care who or what he is, Alex. What if he goes to the media? He won't. He doesn't even know who I am. Does anybody else know about this little make-out session of yours? Calm down. It was one kiss. I just did it to distract him. From what? David's interview. It came on the TV at the cafe. You were at a cafe with this man? Yes, and you know what? It was really nice spending time with someone who didn't want anything from me. I was just myself again. Alex, I hope, for your sake, none of this shows up online. He wouldn't do that sort of thing. He was a real gentleman. He's not the one I'm worried about. Everybody has a camera, Alex. You've got to be more careful. But nothing happened... This time. Alex, this whole project is about making you look good. America's sweetheart, remember? I need you to forget about this Mr. Walsh, all right? All right. Good. Now, get some rest. You've got a big day tomorrow. You are going back to high school! I forgot how much I hated high school. Don't think about it as high school. Think about it as a Hollywood public appearance event... With worse lighting. All we have to do is get Mr. Lee to say yes. How hard can that be? Good morning. David here tells me you want to attend our senior prom as his date. With your permission, of course. Mm-hmm. Well, I've thought it over, and... I'm all for it! As far as I'm concerned, miss Allen, you are more than welcome here. I think you'd be an inspiration to our students. Hello, everyone. I'm so sorry I'm late. Alex and Paige, this is miss hope. She's our faculty chair for the prom committee. Good morning. I've just given my permission for David and Alex to attend the prom together. Well, isn't that exciting! Well, of course, we'll have to work out some logistics. What with all the added attention that this is going to be bringing to the school, we certainly don't want to overshadow the experience of the event for the students. Well, logistics are my specialty, miss hope. I'd be more happy to help in any way I can. Honestly, I don't want to be any trouble. I'm here for David, so just treat me like you would any regular student at the school. That is a brilliant idea. What is..? Being treated like a regular student. Mr. Lee, do you think it would be possible for Alex to attend classes with David? Alex is very interested in getting involved in educational charities, that sort of thing. It would be very helpful if she could get an inside perspective while she's here. I'll tell you what, miss Allen. I will make you an honorary student for the week. How about that? How about that? What's the idea of making me attend classes? That wasn't part of the deal. Alex... You remember how you always used to tell me how you never fit in in high school? Everybody picked on you. This is your second chance to be the coolest kid in class. I don't know... Plus, there are probably hundreds of untapped social media accounts in this building, waiting to smile on you. Do you really think this is going to work? Course I do. I'm also going to set up a date for you and David to be seen at a local hangout. You can have milkshakes. You know I don't do dairy. Alex, you're an actor. Fake it. Have a great day! So, where to first? My favorite class of the day. Come on. Excuse me, Mr. Walsh? There's someone I'd like you to meet. Good morning, students. I'm going to dispense with the usual announcements this morning in order to welcome a very special guest to our school, the famous Hollywood actor miss Alex Allen. Miss Allen is here to attend the prom with j.W. Hughes' very own David Rogers, and we hope she has a wonderful time this week. Over and out! Well, it's really nice to meet you, miss Allen. Same to you, Mr. Walsh. Yeah, you can sit over there with me. Okay. Hi. Okay, everybody. All right. It's very exciting we have a celebrity in our midst, but we have work to do... She's so awesome. ...so let's get back to our friend, bill Shakespeare. Who can tell me what happens in "Romeo and Juliet," act two, scene two? Anybody? Come on, does anyone? How about you, miss Allen? Uh... You're kind of putting me on the spot right now. Of course, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have expected you to know this. I guess you're used to a different kind of acting. The balcony scene. Very good. Thank you, miss Allen. "Romeo and Juliet" is one of the most famous plays in history, but really, at its heart, it's just a story about two people who could be together, but are kept apart by lies. Yes, miss Allen? Well, I hate to disagree with you, Mr. Walsh, but it wasn't exactly lies that kept them apart. It was more like a small misunderstanding. Well, if Juliet would've told Romeo the truth in the first place, then there wouldn't have been a misunderstanding. Well, maybe Romeo needed to give Juliet a little more time to explain. Juliet just had to say "I'm a capulet," and Romeo would've figured it out. Yes, David? I don't remember any of this from the play at all. Yeah, it's just... Miss Allen doesn't know the play as well as she thinks she does. O, Romeo, Romeo. Wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name, or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, and I'll no longer be a capulet. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou art thyself, though not a montague. What's montague? It is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face, nor any other part belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name, would smell as sweet. Mr. Walsh, just wanted to return your book. I take it any inspiration you got from it must have worked. Oh, big time. I still can't believe Alex Allen is going to be my prom date. Oh, excuse me. Hey! Hi. Hi! Listen, I haven't had a chance to say thank you for yesterday, but I have your clothes at the hotel. I'm having them cleaned, and I'll get them back to you tomorrow. Not really your style, huh? Well, let's just say you make a much better Heidi than I do. Apparently, David doesn't think so. Can I ask you something? You're the movie star. Why aren't you and David going to prom together? Uh, because... The prom is stupid, and I wouldn't have gone anyway. He didn't ask you, huh? Look... David and I are best friends, okay? Okay. And best friends look after each other. Right, so..? So... I know what's going on here. You don't actually care about David, and you don't care about the prom. You're just doing this for some good publicity. Well, that's not exactly true. Really? Well, here's what it is. This is really important to David, and if you do anything to hurt his feelings, I have a cell phone and a social media account, and I am not afraid to use them. Have a nice day. I thought Hollywood was tough. Oh, nice performance in there, miss Allen. I was impressed. Thank you. I was hoping we could go someplace and talk for a minute, privately? I don't know if that's a good idea. Last time we did that, things kind of got out of hand. Well, that's what I want to talk to you about. - You see... - Oh, there you are! Mr. Walsh, it's time for our prom committee meeting. Oh! Well... So sorry, big meeting. Got to go. Can I come too? I would just love to see what you guys have planned for the big night! Yes. Of course! Oh, we'd be just thrilled to have you. Great! Lead the way! This should be interesting. Bree, would you like to open the meeting for us? Absolutely. Okay, well, Alex, on behalf of everybody on this year's prom committee, I just want to welcome you and tell you how really, really excited we are to have you here. Thank you. It is an honor to be... Sure, that's really nice. So we only have a very short time together today, so let's just keep this meeting moving right along, shall we? All right. Now, since this year's theme for the prom is the wild west, I think we should get some actual bales of hay and have them scattered around the gym, and... Yes? Do you really think that's such a good idea? I mean, a lot of people have hay fever, and I imagine there's nothing worse than sneezing all night in a prom dress. Um, well, we don't have to have real hay, I suppose. And the wild west thing? It seems a little culturally insensitive to me. Well, do you have any ideas for a theme, Alex? Well, since I'm going to be here, how about Hollywood dreams? We can get some spotlights and have a big Hollywood sign on the stage. I love that! Don't you think it's a little late in the game to be making changes like that? Not at all! I just worked with the most amazing set decorator on my last film. I'm sure I can give him a call, and he'd be happy to whip up some designs for us right away. It's, it's just... We don't exactly have a Hollywood-sized budget to work with. Oh, that's okay. We can just run it through my non-profit organization. It won't cost a dime. This is awesome! Miss Allen, the idea behind prom is to have the students participate in every aspect of the event. Perfect, and I will be right there participating alongside them. Um, I think what miss hope means is that we need to be sure that this is something the whole committee wants. But prom means so many different things for so many different people. Romance, celebration, a rite of passage... I just want to make it better for everyone. Well, I say we put it to a vote. All right. All in favor of... Motion passed. Mr. Walsh! Just... okay, sure. I must admit, I'm a little surprised by you, Mr. Walsh. How so, miss hope? Well, you certainly don't strike me as the kind of person who'd be a fan of miss Allen's movies. Actually, I don't know them, or her. Oh. That didn't seem to stop you from encouraging her little coup d'etat. I didn't encourage it. It's what the kids want. It's their prom. Exactly. It's their prom, not the Alex Allen show... Enough about me. ...and I intend to keep it that way. Okay, first thing we do is take off the emergency brake. Which one is that? You're not Andrea. No. I asked her to reschedule. I felt like she owed me one. You lied to me, miss Allen. Okay, first of all, please call me Alex. Second, I didn't lie. I just didn't tell you the whole truth. Which amounts to the same thing. Okay, look, you're going to prom with one of my students. I find it highly inappropriate for us to be sitting together in this car. Well, you've been avoiding me all day. Felt like this was the only place we could talk privately. Look, about the kiss... The kiss was inappropriate, too. I know, but if you'd let me explain... Okay, all right, look, we're sitting in a car in the parking lot. You should drive. Drive? You do know how to drive? I've always had a chauffeur. Never had to learn. You're kidding? All right, I guess this will be lesson number one. Seriously? Better late than never. Let's start by releasing the emergency brake. That's the emergency brake. Oh, yeah. Whoo! Hey! Okay, this isn't so bad. Good. Now let's see how you actually feel when you start the engine. And when that TV interview showed up on the screen with my face all over it, I didn't know what else to do. So you kissed me. Well, I couldn't think of any other way to distract you. Well, it worked. What I don't understand is... Why didn't you just tell me who you were in the first place? I don't know. I guess I was enjoying not being Alex Allen for a change. What's wrong with being Alex Allen? Nothing. It's just... Every time I meet someone new, the first thing I wonder is, "what do they want from me?" Oh, come on, it can't be as bad as that. It's worse. If I actually go out on a date with a guy, and our photo shows up in a magazine or online someplace, suddenly, he's got a three-picture deal and never calls me back. Guess that's why I'm still single. Well, you have a better excuse than I do. Oh, yeah? Yeah, no one's going out with a high school English teacher to advance their career. So, how come you're still single? Bad examples. Parents? Yeah, they were happily married for 30 years. How is that a bad example? It's just, it's a lot to live up to, you know? The way my mom still talks about my dad... I just hope that some day, I can find a relationship like that for myself. Car! Okay. Maybe we need a little break. You know, I know this great spot up ahead that has excellent milkshakes. Oh, I don't do... I would love a milkshake. When I was 18, I was working at a gas station, and they asked me to be in their commercial. I was a windshield wiper. You must have been very convincing. I must've been. Somebody called my mom and told her they thought I was talented, so... We packed up, moved to Hollywood. And the rest is history. Not quite. We lived in the car for about a month, but then I got a job, and then I got another one, and then the starlight falls movies happened. Wait, what are the starlight falls movies? Well, I play an alien who comes to earth as a teenage girl, and every time the stars shine, I have magical powers, and I save the world. Okay. Got it. Mm-hmm, yep... And when the first one of those came out, everything changed. For the better, obviously. Sometimes, I'm not so sure. I love acting, but the stuff that comes with it can be... confusing. How so? Sometimes, people want you to be something that you're not. Well, that's just part of the business, isn't it? Not when you start to forget who you were to begin with. We all lose track of ourselves once in a while. Sometimes, it takes a complete stranger to remind us of who we are. Ah, I've got to go. But you haven't finished your milkshake. I know, I'm sorry. I have a date... With David. Ah. Mm-hmm. Phone's still not working. I don't get it. She's never like this. This diva thing might work in Hollywood, but around here, being late is just rude. I'll be on the balcony. Thank you for the milkshake. It's been a very long time since I've had one of those. Can I ask you a question? Is there going to be a test later? You said that people always seem to want something from you... ...but what was it about David's invitation that made you say yes? Well... I guess it was the words he used to describe me. What kind of words? He said that I "walked in beauty" and was an "ageless soul," and he said that I was "a dream made real". I mean, how could I not say yes? Now, if only I could find someone my own age to use words like that. Anyway, I guess I will see you around school, Vincent. Have a nice evening, Alex. Oh, hold on! I almost forgot. What's this? Your report card. D minus! Ouch. Well, look, you're here to go to prom with David, and as his teacher, it's my duty to maintain a strict code of professional conduct all the way through prom night. Understood. But maybe if you're interested in another lesson... My number's on the back. We're from two different worlds, you know. I'm a capulet, you're a montague. We both know how that ends. Well, nobody said you can't rewrite Shakespeare. Would a kiss get me an "a"? It's... it's worth a try. Good night. Good night. Hey! Hi! Sorry I'm late. Where have you been? I have been calling you for two hours. Phone's still dead. I was just doing a little sightseeing. Really, and what sights did you see? Uh, you know. The sights. These are for you. Oh, thank you, David. They are beautiful, and you look nice! Where are we going for the big date? The burger barn. What's wrong with the burger barn? There's nothing wrong with the burger barn. It's the most popular place in town for high school kids. Yeah... The cool kids, which I'm not. Well, I think you're cool. Stick with me, kid, and we'll have a great night. I'll be right down. I'll get the car, meet you out front. I'll help you! Have you seen Alex's latest movie? Which one? The one she made tonight. Who is that? Mr. Walsh, David's English teacher. It looks like Alex had a little extra homework to do. Did anybody else see this? Not yet, but if your client dumps my brother before the prom, I'll make sure this ends up all over the Internet faster than you can say "America's sweetheart." - Got that? - Understood. Good. Have you ever considered a career in Hollywood? Hi. Yeah. There's a seat right over there. Thanks. Alex Allen, table for four. Of course. Course, yes. Please... Right this way. Hey, nice to see you. How's your night going? This is crazy. I can't believe she's here. Hey, David. I know. Good to see you. Hey, David. It's reserved. Alex. Can I get you something? Four sodas. Okay. - Diet. - Diet. - Diet. - Diet... The best you've got. I'll check the wine cellar. Excuse me. Hey. What's the matter? Why did you have to bring her here? What, this? This was Paige's idea. What's upsetting you? You, David! You upset me. I'll make sure she leaves a big tip, if that's what's bothering you. You know, you're really an idiot. You know that? Look, I'm just having a great night, okay, and I... Why can't you just be happy for me? Everything okay? Yeah, that was just... Watts. She gets kind of weird sometimes. You are trending across all of your social media accounts right now. Everybody in here must be posting something about you. Do you think there's anything on this menu that isn't fried? Be nice. People are watching. Hi, David. Oh... Hi. I saw your promposal video. I was very impressed. Thanks. I wish a guy would do something like that for me. Good luck. It wasn't that big of a deal. It certainly was a big deal! David's video's all over the news. He's famous. I bet you're glad I didn't go to prom with you after all, huh? David is the best date ever. We're having so much fun tonight, aren't we? Yeah! Alex Allen, Courtney Cordell. It's very nice to meet you. Mm... Are you a friend of David's? Oh, yes, I've known David for years. We go way back. Alex, could I get a picture with you? Absolutely. You want me to take it? Yes. There you go. You know, I have an idea. David, why don't you be in the picture, too? Whoa, what? O... kay.... Ready? One, two, three. Perfect. Oh, it's perfect. Thanks so much, Alex. You're the best. You know she's just going to crop David out of that picture. She can't. That's why I put him in the middle. Yeah, so, uh... That was Courtney. She was the last girl to turn me down for prom. You know, I still can't believe it was that difficult for you to get a prom date. Uh... I did get rejected about... 15 times. Wow. Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Four diet sodas. It's our finest vintage. Thank you. Thanks. Why didn't you ask Heidi? They're just friends. Yeah, and also, she thinks prom is stupid anyway. Well, let me tell you something. If you were in my class back when I was in school, I would have been thrilled if you asked me to the prom. Really? Mm-hmm, and I definitely would have said yes. I had a lot of fun tonight, Alex. For the first time, I kind of felt like I belonged at that place. I'm glad! I had fun, too. I was just wondering... I know I'm only in high school, but maybe, say, a few years from now... David... You're a great kid, and someday, you are going to make some girl very happy. But not you. Not me. Besides, as far as Hollywood's concerned, I'll be 29 forever, so eventually, you'll just be too old for me, and it wouldn't work. Well, can't really blame a guy for trying, right? Good night, David. I will see you in school tomorrow. You walk in beauty like the morning sun, arising with the hope of love. Your heart beats with the passion of your courage, the strength of your determination, and the gentle kindness of an ageless soul. You are to me a dream made real, one from which i hope to never awake. So what do you say, Alex? Will you take a chance on me and be my date to the prom? Hello? Alex, I need you to... Um... Who were you calling? Nobody. You can't just go around taking other people's words and calling them your own. It's called plagiarism. I'm really sorry, Mr. Walsh. Look... No harm, no foul. Just next time... Write something of your own, okay? Yes, sir. Mr. Walsh? Do you have a moment? Certainly. My name is Paige, Paige Sumner. I'm Alex Allen's publicist. What can I do for you? It has come to my attention that you and my client, miss Allen, have become, for want of a better word, an item. I wouldn't exactly call it that. Well, whatever it is you want to call it, I need to keep it out of the press, print and electronic. That means it needs to stop. Is this coming from you, or from Alex? As her publicist and friend, I speak for both of us. Look, she came here to go to the prom with David Rogers. I understand that, and I'm not getting... So this is not an opportunity for you to make money, Mr. Walsh. What? I will not have you selling my client to the media. Is that what you think this is about? Let me put it like this. If your relationship with Alex becomes public, so will your entire life. I have nothing to hide. Everyone has something to hide, Mr. Walsh. Remember that. It's me. I need you to do a background search on one of the school teachers up here. J.W. Hughes high. Yeah, his name is Vincent Walsh. Trevor... That's my set decorator, sent over these designs for the prom. Miss Allen, they look very ambitious. Ah, well, that's Trevor. Once he gets his mind set on something, the sky's the limit. So we're going to go with an old Hollywood glamour theme. Classic movies, classic movie stars. Are those mirror balls? Of course, you can't have prom without mirror balls. But 10 of them? And what does that mean... "Black and white, no exceptions"? Oh, that's Trevor's color scheme for the evening. It's based on hurrell. The photographer? Anyway, everyone has to come dressed in black and white. But miss Allen, many of the students and faculty have already purchased their prom wear. Okay, we can compromise, I guess. Let's say the girls can wear whatever they want, and the boys have to come dressed in black and white. Otherwise, Trevor will have a heart attack. Um, maybe we could simplify this just a little bit. I mean, it's a lot to take in. Bree, do you want to have a prom to remember? Yes, but... So do I. What else you got? Now, over here, wind machines... Wind machines? Yeah... And then this will be the lounge area, so that's not dancing, you can just chill out. Right. Oh, Vincent... Sorry, I was in a meeting. What did I miss? Oh, nothing. Except little miss movie star in there is turning the prom into her very own personal academy awards. I'm sure it's not as bad as all that. It's worse, but I'm going to put a stop to this, once and for all. I know. Hi. Oh, my gosh, you really... Where's Alex? She's still working on the prom. This seat's taken. Okay, sorry. I swear, I have no idea why he'd come around. - Hey. - Hey. Hey. Why aren't you sitting with your new friends over there? I don't need a mercy lunch. Shut up, watts. So, where's your prom date? Still in the gym. She and miss hope have been arguing about balloon shapes for an hour. Oh. Look, I'm sorry about the other night at the burger barn. Don't... Don't worry. No, I was being an idiot, and I really am sorry. This whole thing has just gone to my head, I guess. You know, you asked me why I couldn't just be happy for you? The thing is, I've always been happy for you. You're, like, the best person I know. Watts... No, it's true, and just between us, that promposal that you wrote was pretty amazing. I'm really proud of you, Rogers. Yeah, about that... Can, uh... Can you keep a secret? Haven't I always? I didn't exactly... write it. What? Mr. Walsh, he, um, he gave me his book, for inspiration, he said, and I didn't get that inspired, so... You stole it right out of the book? No, not all of it. Just... just the part where I described Alex. It was from this chapter where Mr. Walsh is talking about the woman he wants to marry someday. It seemed to fit, so... You need to tell Alex. Why? Because it's dishonest, using somebody else's words as your own. Come on, nobody cares about that on the Internet. Yeah, but I do! Okay, okay, settle down. I'll tell her. Good. - All right. - Thank you. After the prom. Ow! Ow! Whoa, whoa, let me help you with that. Oh, thanks. Ugh... What are you doing back here anyway? I thought I'd look and see if there was any decorations we could use, and then I got a splinter. Let me see that. Oh, yeah, it's in there. Here, have a seat. Thank you. You're really into all this prom stuff, huh? You must have had a really great one when you were in high school. Actually, I didn't go to mine. What? Why? No one asked me. I find that hard to believe. Believe it. I was not one of the popular kids in school. Alex Allen, Hollywood superstar, not popular? That's impossible. I was bullied a lot by some of the other kids in school, so that didn't help. I just remember sitting at the lunch table, listening to them all talk about what they were going to wear to prom and where they were going to go out for dinner after. Is this going to be a sad story? Oh, it gets much better... Because I decided I was not going to sit at home and feel sorry for myself, so I decorated my room, twinkle lights and all, and I did my hair and makeup, and put on my best dress, I picked just the right song, and I danced by myself, all alone, in my room, and I pretended that I was having my very own private prom. My mom says that's how she knew I was going to be an actor. Silly, right? No, not silly... Sweet. Well, who knows, maybe this prom will help make up for it. Got it. Thanks. Back to work! Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee. Ah, miss hope. How are the preparations coming along for the prom? Well, that is exactly why I wanted to talk to you. It's about miss Allen. Such a pleasure to have her in our school. A lovely lady, isn't she? Sure. Well, the thing is... Um, the thing is, Mr. Lee, I'm afraid we have a problem with miss Allen. Ugh, I am beat. How anyone does anything without at least five personal assistants is beyond me. I just want a hot bath and a glass of wine. Make that two. You're going to hate me for this, but I ran a background check on your English teacher. What? You're right, Paige, I am going to hate you for this. I know, I'm sorry, I should've told you before, but I... But what? You thought I would tell you it's none of your business? You are my business, Alex, and you're my friend. I just don't want to see you get hurt, and... I'm afraid you're not going to like what I found out about Vincent Walsh. Are you sure he doesn't want anything from you? Let's go, people! We are less than six hours to prom time! Hey, great job! Oh, here. You, with the signage, come on, hustle! Sweetie... Looking good, sergeant. Good is not good enough. These guys wouldn't last a day on a film set. Well, let's remember, it's only a high school prom. Do you need something, Mr. Walsh? Uh, well... Actually, I was wondering when you'd like to schedule your next driving lesson. My calendar happens to be wide open. I won't be taking any more of your lessons, thanks. Is it the car? Because I know it's not exactly the smoothest ride in the world. No, it's not the car. It's the teacher. I don't trust him. What's that supposed to mean? You tell me... V.K. Walsh. So you found my book. Paige did, when she was checking up on you. Why didn't you tell me you were a writer? I don't know. It didn't come up in the conversation. Well, I'm sure it would have, sooner or later. So? So... This was all a set-up, wasn't it? What? The "promposal." You and David had it all planned. You gave him the words right out of your book, told him exactly what to say and how to say it. No, that's not what happened. You used that nice kid as bait to meet me... Oh, and what a coincidence, you just happen to have written a book, and wouldn't it make a great movie? That never even crossed my mind. It's a book of poetry! You know, I thought you were different, but you just wanted to use me, like every guy I have ever dated. Alex, let me explain something to you. You didn't recognize me. Right. I'll bet you knew I was coming all along. You've got to be kidding me. A week ago, I didn't even know who you were! Oh, please! Everybody knows who I am! Maybe that's your problem. You're so used to everybody knowing you, that you're afraid to let anybody actually get to know you. What does that even mean? It means that despite how highly you think of yourself, not everybody's interested in taking advantage of you... Especially me. And another thing... Ms. Allen! Oh, Mr. Lee. Hi. I... um... First of all, I want to thank you for all your efforts on our students' behalf this week. Why do I feel like there's a "but" coming? I regret to have to inform you that... You cannot attend prom tonight. What? But you said... The state school board recently enacted an official prom age requirement that all student dates must be 22 years of age or younger. I see. Out of curiosity, how did this issue come to your attention? Well, if it wasn't for miss hope's due diligence, we might have gotten ourselves into quite a fix. Why don't I just come as a chaperone? Only parents of students or faculty members are permitted to act as chaperones. I'm sorry. You should pick me up around 6:00, I think? Chaperones should get there early. Don't you agree? I think the gym looks spectacular. Everyone's going to have a really good time. Not everyone. I really don't know why you have it out for me, miss hope. I just wanted to make this a great prom. Oh... well... Everyone has rules they need to live by, miss Allen, even people from Hollywood. You know, I had forgotten. Forgotten? I'd forgotten what high school was like. Full of bullies. Great. Hey. Thanks. I overheard principal Lee. You're leaving just like that? Well, if there's one thing I have learned as an actor, it's to always make a clean exit. Okay, but what about David? He's been looking forward to this prom for such a long time. I know. So was I, but there's nothing I can do about it. There is, however, something you can do about it. What do you mean? You need to go to the prom in my place. No. No way. No, prom is... Yeah, prom is just dumb and stupid... I heard you before, and I didn't believe you then, either. Look... If I show up instead of you, David will never speak to me again. Well, then you obviously don't know him as well as you think you do. Heidi, you and David are perfect together. Anybody could see that, except, apparently, the two of you. Look, your senior prom only happens once, and if you miss it, you could spend the rest of your life trying to make up for it. Don't throw this chance away. Well, the theme is Hollywood dreams, right? Mm-hmm. Well, I am not exactly what you would call a glamour girl. Well, that's... That's my department. Argh! I can't get this stupid thing to work. I've got this. Ready for the big night? I think so. Corsage, limo, sweaty palms... You name it. I just checked Alex's social media accounts. She's peaking in all platforms, and alexanddavidgototheprom is trending very hot. Sounds like it's going to be a win-win for everybody. Oh, limo's here! Yeah. Win-win. This is an outrage! We flew all the way here, paid our own expenses, completely out of the goodness of our hearts, to make this young man's dream come true, and now you're telling me that some petty bureaucratic... Hello? Hello! Come on! We've got work to do. Love it. Mm-mm. No? Daylight's still a long time coming okay. But I know it will been under their spell oh, but we're coming awake no. No? Mm-mm, nope. Too much... Too much? Yeah, too much. This is why, this is why we crank the dial to the right ooh, this is why we're biting the bullet we know the kids are right sing ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh This is the one. Different colors ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh we carry each other ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh we're just different colors this is why we're biting the bullet we know the kids are right we keep cranking the music up driving through our towns but they don't wanna hear they want us to turn it down so come on, lovers come on, haters tonight we raise the fire ready? Ah, it's a little more complicated than I'm used to, but... Wow. Do I look okay? You look amazing. Really? Thank you. Oh, uh, by the way, I hope you don't mind, but... I couldn't go all the way. Let's see you. It's probably your Mr. Walsh. He's been calling all afternoon. Well, don't answer it. I'm not going to let him ruin this perfect moment. Ah, Alex, there's something I have to tell you... About Mr. Walsh. I think I know everything I need to know about Mr. Walsh. Well, actually... You don't. I didn't mean to snoop, but I overheard you two arguing today about David's promposal. You mean the one Mr. Walsh made him write? No. You see, Mr. Walsh really didn't know anything about it. David just ripped off the words from Mr. Walsh's book, and passed them off as his own... To you. Why wouldn't he say something? He didn't want to ruin the prom for David, I guess. Mr. Walsh is pretty loyal to people. Mm. So... He wasn't after anything at all. He was just trying to help out one of his kids. And when he said he didn't know who you were... It's because he didn't know who I was. He just liked me for me, and I threw it away. Well, what are you going to do about it? Right now? I am going to make a little promposal of my own. I'll be right back. Hi, David. Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond my control, i can't be with you tonight. So, David Rogers, consider this my official unpromposal. Instead, I am sending a replacement. Actually, she's much better than a replacement. She is who you should have been taking all along. See, I've gotten a chance to get to know you both this past week, and whether you guys realize it or not, you're perfect for each other. You just needed someone to push you in the right direction. So please, have fun at prom, have the best night of your lives... Oh, and don't forget to take pictures and post them online. Hi. Um... Heidi... You're, um... You're beautiful. Shut up, Rogers. You get me higher you light the fire somehow you get the best of me you make me want it you know you got it you got me hooked and you're the key yeah, I know there's a million other girls to see but right now you're the only place I want to be Isn't this exciting? Takes you right back, doesn't it? Doesn't it? I'd better check the punch bowl. Save me a dance! I don't think we should dance near the cool kids. Ah, please. We are the cool kids. - David! - Oh, hi. Heidi? Yeah! It's really me under here, Mr. Walsh. It's kind of weird, right? I think you look wonderful, but I thought you were supposed to bring Alex tonight? Oh, she wasn't allowed to come because of some sort of rule or something, but... I've got a better date anyway. 'Scuse us. Howard... Really makes you want to groove, doesn't it? Yeah. I just heard that Alex Allen won't be allowed to attend tonight. Oh, just some mix-up with the rules. Funny thing is, I double-checked with the school board. Miss hope must have misunderstood. Wait, it's because of miss hope? Yes, but it seems that the restrictions for attendance do not apply to anyone accompanying a chaperone. Yeah. Care to dance, Mr. Lee? Oh, uh... okay! 'Scuse me! We're taking the next flight out. She'll be back in Los Angeles tonight, and she can be on set first thing Monday morning. Absolutely. Thank you so much. I told you this would work! You start a new movie next week, and I've had four more phone calls already asking when you're available. We're back in business! That's great. I... Well, I suppose we could always take the first flight out tomorrow morning instead. Hi. Hi. You're leaving. My agent wants me back right away. Duty calls. So I guess you didn't change your mind about that driving lesson? Well... I changed my mind about the teacher. Does he accept apologies? Well, that depends. On what? Whether or not you'd accept a late invitation to the prom? Let's dance in style let's dance for a while heaven can wait we're only watching the skies hoping for the best but expecting the worst are you gonna drop the bomb or not I wonder what happened to Mr. Walsh. He owes me a dance. ...or let us live forever we don't have the power but we never say never sitting in a sandpit life is a short trip the music's for the sad men... Looks like somebody found a loophole. Can you imagine when this race is won turn our golden faces into the sun praising our leaders we're getting in tune... So, what's next for America's sweetheart? Well, I have been thinking about that, and... Maybe I could just be a sweetheart here for a little while. Do you really want to live forever forever and ever forever young I want to be forever young do you really want to live forever forever and ever forever young I want to be forever young do you really want to live forever...
