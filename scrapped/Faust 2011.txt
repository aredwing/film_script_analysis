I haven'! found ii. Where does one look for the soul? The skin is (hi n, perforated... Large and lung... The soul. And life... Where are they hidden, then? In the head? There's only rubbish in there! Or in the heart? Sometimes I have the feeling that... ...both reside in the feet. - How do you mean? - If one is startled... Up, up, up, up! ...Then one suddenly feels... ...so much life in the startled feet. Nonsense! You clean up here! The rag is dirty, too. - That rag ls clean. - Smell for yourself! I made a mistake. It's the formalin! Do you thlnk that I'm already dead? - That was an accident. - Like the berries with carbolic acid... ...you served me last night? Carbolic acid dulls the pain.

I was asked Io give this to you. - By whom? - A good person... ...with a big heart. An angel. Or perhaps a villain, a scoundrel. What are you saying? Just take what your patron saint has given. Only the Lord Gnd sends patron saints. - NM necessa rl ly. - The Lord giveth. and the Lord ta keih. Man has two hands. One taketh, the other one giveth. What about you? It has nothing to do with me. What's wrong?I He struggles along like a decrepit old horse! What, what, what?I Tell me already! Did she accept it? She did. But personally, I would n't have given it to her. Why not? I don' like any of this. You are moved... ...by pure lust. Although It ls hidden behind a mask of nobleness. What noblenessl There they are already! I'm ridden with guilt. Tha!'s also quite noble. What's the hurry? One is rushed. even tu the grave. Tlme ls on the wane. Death is never a welcome guest. One always hurries Io he rid of him. This is taking it too far, Doctor! - What are you dolng here? - Listen... ...this is not my crime, but yours. Oh dear, you've been offended! Attention! Close ranksl But we have no money. Now we do. Now everything will be different. We won't let our heroes be disgraced! Stop it! End this nonsense! There are no heroes here! This is a private affair! Onwards! I'll lead the way I Go get 'em! Splendid! Hands off! She's not yours! What is the Professor doing here? He's not a member of the family. Boring! I barely knew him. He was always fighting in SOME War DY Othr. I rarely saw him. From the earth we came... ...and so we shall return. Earth tn earth... ...ashes tn ashes. dust to dust. My sympathies. Frau Emmerich. Be careful with the cross! - Are you going to the wa ke? - No. A peculiar girl. May I accompany you, Frau Emmerich? - Is that hlm? - No. So who is it then? An eternal wanderer... ...who reams the hills and vales of life. Altmayerl Where are you? Let's go together! - All of them are buried here... ...my entire family. - The graves seem somewhat neglected. Everything will he different now. What a naughty old man! Could you introduce me to him? - Absolutely nut. - Why not! My companion is a scholar. A misanthrope. He lacks the lightness of being that we naturally possess. - What Is he dolng here? - He is suffering. Everything revolves in its little circle. I don' like any of this. I'll see you home. Wolves roam these parts. For everyone knows exactly what will lead him to hell. - What about my mother? - She's having a conversation. What? You don't know what leads a man to hell? I'm so tired. We're nearly Ihere. But nobody wants to go to hell. Everyone presumes hell ls only for the bad, not the good. And that is a mistake. What plant might I gladden you with? Celery? Parsley? Perhaps mandrake root? There Is no mandrake root round here. - You should be glad! Oh, a burdock! - Thank you. Can you not walk faster? I have to get to my guests. Do you know where mandrake root grows? - No. - We'd better ta ke the little path. - Why? This path is better. It ls a steep path but it is quite pretty. - Yes, It truly ls. - Professor! - I'm over here! - I can hear that. It grows below gallows or near bonfire pits... Blueberries! ...Bonfires In which witches were burned. - I'm tired. - We can have a rest. No, let's keep going. Women are weatherproof: one may only admire (hem. Why are you so frightened? You're not a witch. - Where are the two of them going? - They cannot run away. All roads lead to town. And what is this here? Verbena. Ora lily. Are you really a professor? And a baccalaureate, and a doctor, and so on. But you're not well versed in botany. Quite so. Autumn is coming. So in what things are you well versed? The order of the universe... ...the trajectories of the planets... ...the transmutation of metal into gold. What plan! is this? I think... ...It's chickweed. - The things you know. Why are only women sen! In the stake? I know that my chatter can never entertain a man like you. - But not men? - You'll be the firs! man to burn. You should trust yourself more. Fine by mel I dream of the day... ...when I'm finally burned. The day that everybody is burned... ...regardless of sex... ...age, rank or merit. That's what I call equality. I had a dream about my brother today. He seemed different. We talked... ...for a long time. You know so much. What does death do to a person? Does he die completely? Science argues that death exists. - But Ilfe gives the same answer. - Yes, tha!'s true. So what do we need your science for? It's something to do to fill the void. You, say, probably enjoy knitting in your free time? Yes, I do. Science is something like knitting. I'm driven by great things. Thls earthly round is ton cramped for me. I can neither better nor convert my fellow men. - Wherever are they? - They're just talking and talking. - What about? - About life and death. Death is death. Yes, death still exists. But soon ii will disappear. - What ls that supposed to mean? - I'm speaking of the future. But some people are already on the right path. And there won't be any unhappy people there? No. The unhappy are dangerous. Quite dangerous. Doctor! I'm over here! Margaretel It is late! Come! What are you dolng sitting there? Is this a pleasure garden or what? We must go home! - I'm coming, Mother! - Quickly, quickly! Why are you running round with your skirt raised? - What an innocent child! - Don't touch her! - No groping! Thank you. Goodbye, my guardian angel. - I'll be thinking of you. - You're shameless! Up here it's safer, isn't it? Why are you roaming about? Think of your brother! He lies In his grave, and what are you doing? - I thlnk only of him! - I know what you're thinking about! You Ilttle whore! It's a disgrace! A disgrace! What will people say? One should never joke with women. Ma ma, wait! That wasn't exactly timely. Who is he anyway? Why did you bring the mother here? I! was lime. You begln In secret, with just one. And then another. And soon the whole town will have you! You know where this will lead you? What are you dolng here? Come with us! No, I don't know! What binds a woman tn a man? Don't you know? No, I have no idea. Three things... ...money... ...lush and a shared household. That has a cynical ring. Cynical? L!'s strange to hear that frnm you. Yet another moraliser. I have the rlght tn accuse others of being cynical... ...because I myself am different. Clean. Pure. You - clean, pure? Who told you that? Ever since Eve was tempted, the world has not been pure. It wasn't I who tempted her, but a distant ancestor. A snake just like you. Good day! - Are we headed the right way? - Where are you going? - To Paris. - To Paris? Paris is that way. Get in! - Would you llke to go to Paris? - That's the last thing I need. - Show me the way. - I'm tired. Let's ride with him for a bit. Let's ride with him for a bit. Someone is lying in here, snoring. Doctor! Climb in... ...or the best seats will be taken, as so often happens in life. Get in, get in! Come on! Hey, careful! Lousy Krauisl Let's be off! Straight ahead! I want to get out. It smells here! - The man stinks terribly. - Maybe it's a woman. You'd know better than I. Your little doll quickly took the bait. How I'd love to spit In your impudent face! But I still have need of you... ...perhaps. - Together we're strong. We accomplished a lot today. We made the family of the murdered man happy. - Indeed! We made them happy. You talked to Ma rga rete in private. - Mind you, thanks to me. - It was too brief. Too brief?I Do you wan! to be with her for longer? Then it's called seduction. Good morning! Selifan, give me my jacket! And teal And so it is. But I want to all the same! How boring! I was sleeping. Selifan, where ls my jacket? We have guests. - Is he a madman? - ND, he's Russian. - How do I approach her? - You'll have to impress the girl! But how? Show her that you can read her secret thoughts. - Glrls like that sort of thlng. - Stop it! Even you won't be able to flnd nu! her secret thoughts. Selifa n, kick them nut! Stop] We've arrived! It's mass you need to stay the masses. Come on, Doctor! You're not yet man enough to deal with those devils. - What do you mean not yet"? - You must learn to trust yourself. - Nonsense! - Your desire to live is great... ...but your strength Is small. - Were you serious... ...about reading her thoughts? - Even you can't do that. - I can't. But her confessor can. I'm not a confessor. - You could become one. - Me? Her confessor? - I feel you have strength. - You're mocking mel I'm not mocking you. I have a plan. When was the last tlme you went to church? Last year. Margarete goes a little more regularly. Nearly every day. Nearly every day? So what? - How Is that going to help me? - You're hungry, too? Everyone here ls starving. Continue fighting. The world is big. And our priest... ...is he also one of your clients? Well, then. See you later. Rather tasty. I did my best, as always. Such pretty things. Where did you get the money for them? Your student... Your student pawned off some of your lectures on somebody. Although I have no Idea why anyone would want them. One doesn't have to know everylhi ng, Ida. One more thing. Professor. There was someone here for you, a professor. He wanted to invite you to his lecture. I asked hlm, "Who are you? What do you wa nt?" He said: "I wa nt to see Professor Faust." - Thanks, Ida. - You're welcome. I sald: "You have no business here. Go to the unisity." "University"I That's what I said, "Unisity." - "He's there day and night." I said. - Yes, it's all so terribly horrible. - Decent gentlemen sleep at home... ...in their own beds. Katharinal I'm busy! I'll save her. What do you want, Frau Hagemann? I want some bread. - Where were you? - Everybody has been waiting. What did she tell you, Adelhelma? Where is your mother, Gretchen? There she is. Where have you been? They're going to eat everything up! Margarete. where are you going? I'm going outside. There he is. Where can I make a donation? It's you! I haven't seen you in a long while. How large is the donation? It's not small. How hard the uphill road would be... ...in silence, sweat, and effort... ...if every now and then we did not meet 3 TCSS [IPOD DUI' Wiy... ...that nodded to us: "Look, I'm in bloom!" Please, come with me. What would we da without... ...the generous hands of our benefactors. He who has no hand makes no fist. Elsa! I forgot my basket in your house! I'll bring it by later! There she ls. What a coincidence! No, it's no coincidence! I must speak with you. Don't be afraid! I despise everything coarse. I know how you feel. I was there at the cemetery. - Didn't you see me? - Let me pass! I was Ihere. I'm so happy today! It's such a happy, important day! Do you think he ls Faust? He isn't Faust! I am Faust! He stole all his ideas from mel - He ls a usurper! - What did he say? Yes, I'm little Wagner. I am the great Wagner! - We believe you. - The very great Wagner! - Shall I take your measurements? - I am the great Wagner! The very great Wagner. I am Faust. I am Faust. The great Wagner. - The very great Wagner. - Yes. - I am Faust. - Yes... ...I believe you. Yes, of course. I believe you. I can prove it to you. I have... I can prove I! if you don't believe me. I've done it! I mixed the essential oils... ...of asparagus and dandelion... ...with a hyena's liver. And thus I created... ...a homunculus. I mixed... ...the essential oils of asparagus... ...and dandelion... ...with a hyena's liver. ...Mixed I! with a hyena's... ...liver. I mixed the essential olls of asparagus and dandelion. What are you doing? A humunculusl An Ubermenschl A manmade man! Show her what you can dnl Look. Margaretel Look! Say something to her! Let me go! Help! Help! My peace is gone... ...my heart is sore... ...I'll never find it... ...Oh, nevermore. Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Yes, please enter. Dear Lord, forgive me my tainted thoughts. I feel so alone. And I do not love my mother. But she doesn't love me, either. I know I'm a had daughter. And Gnd will punish me. But her make-up... ...the powder on her forehead... ...her had breath. Dear Lord, forgive me and help me. Forgive me my sins. You? - I met your assistant. - Did you really? He is somewhat nervous. your student. Yes, he is a philosopher. May I tell you something? You needn't reproach yourself. Take me, for example. I didn'! love my mother. Ilound everything about her nauseating. Her red-painted cheeks. The powder on her forehead. Her foul breath. But that ls a sin. One must love one's mother. ND... One day she died suddenly. She choked on A piece of cake. And died instantly. Can you imagine? To die from a piece of cake! With whipped cream. If you asked me today whether... ...I'd wanted her dead then... ...I'd have tn admit... ...that yes, I did. - Do you believe in God? Who today has the rlght to say, "I believe in God"'I Me. God Is love. But love knows no obligations. You don't have to love your mother. Are you a mind-reader? You're able to read the book of life. Not the hook of life... ...but, perhaps, the book of one particular person. There is a custom... ...to pray for the deceased for forty days... ...while holding something in your hand... ...that was his. I've never heard of that. No, there is such a custom. Doctor, I'm leaving. Everyone can do it... ...except for murderers. Would you like to pray for my brother? He gave this tn me. What a likeness! Farewell. I saw it with my own eyes. It was the one who kept hiding behind the fat man. It couldn't have been anyone else, Frau Emmerich! Come here! I know who killed your brother. Do you want to know? I! was Faust who did ii. Katharina! Please bring me my cape! My sympathies. Take a rlght at the south gate. I'll show you the way. You? Do come in. Do come in. Have a seai. Have a seai. Sit down. I moved the bed next to the window. For the light... I'm reading. - I have to ask you something. - Yes, go ahead. - Something peculiar. - You can ask me anything. - Please excuse me. - Go on, ask me. What is this? A bellows. Yes. - And this? - A retort... ...for distilling mercury. Is that all you wanted to ask me? Word has it... - No... You know... - What do I know? Good bye! Good bye! Was ii you who killed my brother? Yes, I killed him. What do you want? But on the list it says "two rugs." What rugs? Where are my Persian rugs? I! seems you picked them up yesterday. The lady would Ilke to redeem her Dutch chest. But it is full of fleas! Out of the way! Three rugs... ...and 22 percent In Interest. - What 22 percent interest!! - What about my flute clock? With the Handel sarabande? The beautiful clock goes back. I love Handel. Wait] We have tn... Where is my flute clock? Oh, Ferdinand! Tick it off! - One Christ. - One chest? - One Christ. It goes over there. - Somebody stole the clock. - How many were there? - Five vases. - We're doomed. - I know. - We've been found nut! - By whom? The girl told me I was the murderer. You have been found out, not me. Does this mean she came tn see you? I hope you used the opportunity? It ls not my nature to use such opportunities. Stupid! You won't get another such chance. You only wasted tlme if you denied it all. How do you know that I denied it all? You are the incessant Ilar. I always tell the truth. Is that 507 Well, never mind. It must have been the mother who found out. Take ii easy. So far you haven't been arrested. Don't worry. We'll flnd a way to silence the mother. See what a swamp you've driven me into? When you're sitting in prison... ...then you'll know what a swamp is. - Go! Away! - Stop! - Don't go! - Move it, I said! No, stop! This ls all rubbish! Where is my mirror? - You won't be needing a mirror any more! - My clock] You've run out of time! Rubbish! This is all rubbish! - Rubbish? These are your treasures! Go! - Leave him alone! Devil! - Crook! - Move it! It's a n outrage! Enough, I said! I want only one nlght. That's all I wan!! One night. - Only one nlght. Alone with her. - All alone? One whole night. The things you want! She shares a room with her mother! One night. Please. Just one night. Why such complications? You could just invite the Ilttle doll to your place. She already knows the way. After what I've confessed? What happened In your intellect? Where is your imagination? I have no imagination. I have something better. You sign here. and Margarete is yours. What is this? - Thls ls full of mistakes! - Oh really? "With this signature"... With (his, my personal signature... "I bequeath"... There's something wrong here. I. Heinrich Faust, bequeath... "to the bearer of the letter"... ..."this" letter... ..."my sol... Soul is spelled with a "u"I - With a "u"! How nice. - ..."after its natural"... ..."separation from my body." Yes. Now it's correct. I've run out of ink! What a shame! Perhaps you could use blood? You were prepared to write in blond. Behave yourself! You're a guest here! Lousy dog! What a hideous language, your German. All the same. - So what now? - Now? You'll get your Margarete. I'll see In my side of the bargain. I know where she is. - Let's go then. - So impatient! Fulfil your obligation! Thank you. Where are we going? I'll take you to your dearest by the quickest way. There is a secret path! And where is it? I'll show you. There is no chimney on my lamp! This path is underground! Underground! - Here It ls! Which way? - This way I My secret tunnel! I'll lead the way. This is my way. I've never shown it tn anyone. What a devilish tunnel! But somehow it's easy to breathe here. A deep well. My storeroom for cowardly souls. I'll lead the way. Let me through. Do you still want tu do it? Thls ls all sedimentary cover rock. as far as I can tell. You'd better thlnk about good cover for yourself. The little one will do you no harm. But the old hag... I know how tn pacify her. - Do you want to decapitate her? - Dear Doctor! - Rip out her tongue? - A good herbal tea... ...and she'll fall asleep forever. Fall asleep forever? Yes, nice and quiet. We'll leave them here. For the way back. - Are we there yet? - Yes. The poor girl. The dear child. There she is. I just knew ii. Thls ls where all young souls go when they're suffering. Go! Go! You wanted to save her. You can save her now. My peace ls gone, my hear! is sore... Is there anyone here? How cold it is here. Cold. Why are all these things scattered here? I don't understand. Who did this? This is his herbal tea. L!'s your flask. Doctor. I have Io go. I have Io go. Now you may enter. No pushing! Behave in an orderly manner! Come on. I'll help you. There's someone here. The clock has stopped. The hands have fallen down. L!'s draughty in here. You're cold. I have Io go. Those cats again. I hate cats. I don' wa nt tn... I don' wa nt tn... Where are my things? What is this? A straitjacket. God help me... Gnd save me. I don' wa nt tn... - Well, finally! - I don't want to. - What ls this?! - Your armour. What are you doing" - Where did you get such strength? - I want to save you. It's the best armour I have! A good man needs good armour! I'm not good! Don't touch me! I cannot stand violence! Come to me! One step and then you're free! - Where to? - Forward, march! Your loitering draws Death closer! Not every murderer is forgiven his guilt. I! has to be earned. What sense ls there In fleeing? I must stay. You must live. We're people destined for great things. I wish that I had never been born. It would be best not to be born at all, my friend! Much better than finally to dle, fortunate as that might seem. - What do you mean? - Finally you're awake! Then go saddle up! I'm a poor horseman. But a good man. Where are you going? Where, where? There. You'll like it there. I know it. - I'm dizzy. - It's ever the same... ...man wants to fly, yet he ca n't cope with dizziness. ...Man wa nts to fly, yet he ca n't cope with dizziness. You're a man. A soldier. What? What am I? In the end. you are what you are. I don't recognise anything here. The forester's house was here. And over Ihere, the mill. The mill? I!'s gone. What do you mean, gone? - Very simple. - But the mill can't just... I don't understand. Armour becomes you. Very noble, powerful. It befits your name: Heinrich. Which means... ..."mighty wall." Or just Heinrich the Mighty. What about your name, Mauricius? What does it mean? - The dark one. - It's a rare name. Yes, it's a martyr's name. And a publisher's. Come! Send the horses home! They'll find their way! It is getting tight here! Why do we have do go through there? This is the stairway ta heaven. But It might lead us in an entirely different direction. Why have you stopped? What are you mourning? I'll show you something better. Here I stand: I cannot do otherwise. So help me God! Be careful with my beautiful armour! Don't scratch it! It's borrowed. - From whom? - How inquisitive you are! Must be our theatre director. And now I'm supposed to amuse the world like a fool? You can amuse only me. There is no one else here. - Where are we? - Far away and high up! Very, very high up! It's so easy to breathe here! I should think so. - What Is this here? - Nothing. - We're not alone here. - Who could be haunting this place? Maybe the Greeks? I have some here. Move! - I have to get through, ton! - Thank you! I can see... ...you're slowly recovering. I've had enough of this masquerade. It's a pity, but alright. In for a penny, in for a pound. - The greaves, please. - I'm no! your servant. - Not a servant. Atypical human being! - I'm going ahead. - Where to? - To the left. Damned bootsl Tell me now, where are we? I told you: far away and very high up. - And what ls this here? - Nothing. Go look for yourself. I know... ...you hope to discover the all in my nothingness. Let the living go on hoping. We were forgotten here. - We are forsaken. - What are you doing here? It's your old acquaintance! - Thank you. - Let me go! What do you want frnm me? Let go of my ha nd! Help! - Stay here with us. - I wa nt to leave! I! is freezing here. Take charge of us. - Vou're so warm. - Lead us into battle. The war is over. I have In save you once again. I don't understand what they see in you! Without armour you're not a general! - Thls way? - Yes. this way. Let me go first! What did he thank me for? Death, of course. Because Ilfe was even harder for him than death. I don't understand. What's there to understand? Eternal poverty. Dependency on his mother. And on his sister's whims. He was a proud man... ...and all that wounded him. What A pity... ...that you didn't kill him in battle. Tha! would have been nobler. Never mind. One must know how to laugh off such things. What will become of the girl? She might he imprisoned. But are we going to save Ma rga rete? If the old hag wakes up. we won'! have In save her. - Are we going to save Margarete? - of course not. In any case... ..we'd flrst have to ask her whether she wa nts to be saved by us. L!'s different with you. We are partners. We have a contract. So that's how it is. Where is tha! smoke coming from? Wait! I did everything I promised to do. - But you... - It's not enough for me. - I'm worth more. - What else do you want? Another sun? Another homunculus? Two, perhaps! L!'s not enough for mel - What a spectacle! - It's a fantasy. No! You're lying! This isn't a fantasy! - How does It work? - My fountain isn't so harmless. It's hot! - Are you happy now? - How does it work? I don't need to know. The Lord Gnd knows. Come on now. It's dangerous here. God doesn't know. Bu! I do. The heat rises upwards... ...the cold sinks towards the interior.. ...Of the earth. - Yes. very interesting. I could recreate this in a snap. Come on! We're leaving! No! I'm staying! He wants to recreate my fountain. You want to achieve glory? The deed is everything. not the glory. Let me see your deed at last! Friends don't treat each other this way! - It really hurts! - Crying is good fur one. Even someone Ilke you must suffer at some point. What do you know about suffering? What can be so special about your suffering? Soon you'll know for yourself. Eternal solitude, and no hope of salvation. Quiet! Enough! I already know everything about you. You're only disturbing me. Quiet now! Pointless hole! I decide everything here! It is not yours to decide anything here. Walt! You can stay longer if you wish. Even without a soul. Leave me alone. I don' need you anymore! What is it you want? Why did you show me those madmen... ...who even In the sleep of death cannot forget their war? What have you given me? Not even money for my ring! Power, influence... ...one can only seize such goods oneself! Nature and spirit... ...that is all one needs... ...to create here, on this free land, a free people. But. seriously now, I have a contract. A contract? You signed it! I have to concentrate! Leave me alone. Wait! The soul! Your soul. - I'm entitled to It. - The soul? You signed the contract with your blood! Feel free to submit It on Judgement Day. No! What are you doing? That's that then. Is this for Margarete? And that is for the mother? Stay thee a while! This isn't pretty! Again, again, again, again. Bad shot! Bad shot! Who will feed you? Who will guide you out of here? Over now. Over as if it never was. Over: what a stupid word! Where are you going? Where are you going? Over there! Farther and farther!
