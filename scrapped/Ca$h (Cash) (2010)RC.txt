walk away Get out the damn jalopy Leslie you make a decision now and you live with the consequences after remember that Fuck you It is an idle threat Sam Thats all hes bullshit Get in the car Leslie Hes bluffing Get in the car Hes a damn bully We can walk away Lets go Lets call the police Where Where the house is financed Mr and Mrs Phelan is it your wish that this gentleman be privy to your personal financial affairs Yeah sure Why the hell not What was the original purchase price of the house The original purchase price was Purchased when Five years ago What is the amount of their monthly payment a month Term of loan How much down Well So if down payment being the same as equity they day they bought the house thats equity And still have that amount today yeah Well yes technically yes Theyve been paying monthly payments faithfully for the last five years which comes to right Thats correct So discounting interest theyve paid down about and a mortgage debt is that right Yes Thats just about right yes So they still owe Now during these past five years the property has appreciated Well yes of course But we cant be certain on how much without an appraisal Yeah nevertheless it has appreciated Lets use a conservative figure say over five years That sums easily to what per year would say thats optimistic would you No that sounds reasonable Okay So discounting appreciation with their original down payment they have equity in the house And as such see no reason why this institution should not lend them a they seek less than half their existing equity Well We quit our jobs Youre unemployed Yeah Are you familiar with the Newer Dock Home Equity Loan Yeah of course Yeah You see the Newer Dock requires no employment no income or assets Lenders do not verify any information beyond the credit profile and value of the property Of course The Phalanx have equity They could easily get a loan equal to Well dont know that this bank has ever issued a New Dock loan dont know that we can do it Their credit rating Listen think youre missing a big opportunity here Mr Dink Its Dale Mr Dale Yeah whatever We could go elsewhere for the money and m sure your branch manager would be very unhappy to lose a business especially in view of the fact that this institution holds the first mortgage But its urgent These people need the cash today Name your terms At todays prices they have more equity than necessary more money for the bank if you decide to foreclose you get me what mean here Its a sweet deal There might even be a promotion in it somebody Perhaps could consider a small home equity loan you know for urgent home repairs High interest Well of course Well we take the fair market value times loan to value and equals minus the compound interest over the term of the loan can lend Thats the maximum on a pure equity loan of an unemployed applicant Theyll take it Make a bank draft to cash Theyll redeem it here So Sam how are you going to get the remaining Why are you keeping me at this The money isnt even yours anyway Thats where youre wrong The money is mine and will keep it until a superior power takes it from me And so the question remains How will you pay me the that you owe me Theres your fucking Thank you Leslie Why cant you just leave us alone understand your frustration do but must have the full amount We dont have it and theres no place else we can get it So youre just going to have to kill us or whatever it is Slow down Look everybodys overreacting Lets just all settle down okay Well have a nice meal well watch some bigscreen
