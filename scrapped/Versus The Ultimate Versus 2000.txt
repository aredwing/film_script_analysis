And some are willing to open the door to gain the power of darkness... Somewhere in Japan exists the 444th portal, known as... The Forest of Resurrection. It was a long time ago when the evil soul uncovered its existence... CHARGES: 1st Degree Murder, Robbery, Excessive Self-defense, Manslaughter, etc. VERDICT: Guilty SENTENCE: 202 years in prison "The world is full of people who are better off dead..." Prisoner No. KSC2-303 This way. You better be right. It's okay. Just trust me. Where are they? Don't worry, they're coming. I'm not worried. I just don't trust you Do as you please then. It's quite a big deal for a pick-up, isn't it? Where's the other car? We gotta wait for him. Then we'll leave. Are you serious? It's not safe here. It doesn't matter. We have specific orders from him. Look, the roads could be blocked by now. We gotta go! What about roadblocks? That's not our concern. Hey, you... Shut up, what the hell are we doing here anyway? No, you shut up. An order is an order, stop whining. To hell with those orders! Do you know what we had to go through forthis? Besides, this place gives me the creeps. Don't bother. These assholes can't do anything but follow orders. What? On your way to a party? Or are you trying to promote hoodlums? You... Better watch your mouth. After all this running around... ...all we get is a useless bunch of punks. Count me out. I see. So, shall I give you some time to rest? Like forever! Stop! We were also ordered to keep this guy alive. Shut up, come on, come on, come on! I don't understand why this one is so special. But you have to follow orders, too, right? Don't be so nosy. Wait a minute! Calm down, all right? You'd better be quiet, too. Don't be so tense. Fighting wouldn't do any good here, right? That goes for you, too. We'll let you get out of here when he comes, so be patient. You know what? I really hate waiting. Stop it for now, it's not a good time. That's right... There's still... After he gets here... We'd better get out of here quick. No matter how many times we come here, I hate this place. It's ominous. A forest to the southwest is an ominous feng shui sign. Oh, really? Meeting with you guys is ominous enough. I told you to shut up. Don't start again! Hey! Bring the girl. Hey, what's with this girl? Who knows? The order was to kidnap her and bring her here with us. One stupid girl and one asshole... What the hell is he planning to do with those two? I don't have the slightest idea what he's thinking! Hey, come on. He must have some plan. Hey, wait. I'm taking no part in kidnapping. What? What did you say? Five men on one girl, you must be proud of yourself. Hey, let her go and take off your toupee. Shut the fuck up! Do you know who you're talking to? Perhaps you're misunderstanding the situation, hmm? A crook like you could be spending the rest of your life in jail if we weren't here. So just shut your smart ass mouth up! Here's the thing, I'm a feminist. What're you gonna do about it? Hey you, let her go now. Watch it. I'm telling you, you should just let her go now. Hey, are you crazy or what? Don't make me tell you again. Let her go right now, or you'll pay for it later. So what are you going to do now, tough guy? Where did they go? It's scary here. I'll kill that guy. No, you shouldn't do that. If you do, he'll become a monster like them. I don't get it... You know what? Then I can kill the bastard twice. That's nonsense. This is not good, let's get out of here. Don't be stupid, we can't let them get away! We have bigger problems, don't we? Look, this is yourfault, isn't it? It's notjust that, think about it. Thinking isn't going to do a bit of good. They were not dead... This can't be happening. We'd better catch them before he gets here. Yeah... You're right. Why did you do that? You didn't have to kill that man. What's your problem? If you did something like that, you're no different from those men. They're bastards, I'm not. I'm sorry... Thanks for helping me. I didn't mean to help you. They just piss me off. So, what are we gonna do? Don't you have a plan? Plans always change. What are you talking about? They're going to kill us! But they were... ...definitely dead. Hey. So, why were you in jail? Shut up, let's go. Something's not right with this forest. Like what? People are everywhere... ...but you can't hear a thing. Nobody's here. Yes, there are. What makes you think that? I've had a strong sixth sense ever since I was little. Hey. Hey... Wait. What's wrong with you? Where the hell do you think you're going? Stay back. This man... What are you doing? Hey, stop! Don't do that! Hey, wait! Let that man rest in peace! I don't believe this... You're crazy. Let's go. We'll take their car. Stop it! Let's just go. They must still be around here. Something's wrong here. That again? I can feel it! Those guys back there... There is something here! Hey... What? They were... ...definitely dead... ...but they came back to life. So what? The dead can come back to life here. So, what are you saying? We've... ...been here over and over... And... The ones we killed... We buried them! They are supposed to be buried right here! Where the fuck are they now? Where are they? I didn't mean to... I just... Come! Let go of me! The game is over. What are those monsters? I thought they were your playmates. So, do you want me to kill you? Then you can be my next playmate! Don't kill this one! You have orders! Hey, you've got the wrong man. I don't care. Just let the guy go. That's why you're nothing more than a punk. Wow. This is getting complicated. Hey, she's been taken away. Huh? What are you talking about? That runt shot my arm and took the girl. Jesus, the both of you! You're both crazy! Are you turning back now? I'll play with you later. So, just wait here. You just let him go? I'm disappointed in you. Don't you get it? It'll be easier if we let that guy find the girl for us. Huh? We'll get them both afterthey're together. Now I see! You're using your brain! Keep both of them alive... Those were his orders exactly. Oh... too bad. It doesn't matter anymore. He's going to die anyway. I'll be in charge from now on. What? It's all been planned, he's just coming here to die. Don't fool with me! What was that? It'd be a pain in the ass if you became a monster... ...so die slowly. Are you okay? Yeah... But this place is fucked up. Nothing can stop me... Not even those monsters... Don't worry. Come on, run faster! Bastards... Are you okay? It hurts... Hey... Your hand! They took it... Those bastards! Damn it! We'll make them pay for this. Shouldn't we report back? No... We'll search for them... ...and destroy them! But... We don't know where they are. I know what they're thinking. They must have taken the mountain paths instead of going down the highway. I was trained at FBI headquarters in Langley. I'm an expert at profiling. An expert? So, Expert, where in the mountains? Don't worry. I'll track them down. I grew up at Yellowstone National Park in Canada. A natural born hunter! A hunter? Which way? No! Shut the fuck up! What's wrong with this place? He'll come after us. Let me go! This is so insane. You... You did all this? It's all your fault! Stop... You're crazy... Hey. No! What do you want? You don't have to kill this one. Shut up, don't preach to me. You can't hurt people for no reason. These days, the world is full of people who are better off dead. That's not for you to judge. What are you, a preacher? Okay, fine. Let's go. Look, no more killing, okay? M-My gun... Hey, who the hell are you? How did you get here? I was kidnapped... What? I can't remember. Huh? I can't remember anything about what happened... ...before I got here. What the hell are you talking about? How about you? Why were you in prison? I was... What? You don't remember either? I forget things easily. So, you too... When did you get here? Just now. What the hell was with those two idiots and all the monsters? What are you up to? Something bad. Where are the others? They're all dead except us. I see. And why are you alive? Got a problem? Yeah, you. A scumbag like you should be dead. Well, well, well, who are these scary people? What's going on? You're dead. No, let's get away from here. That was pretty good, boys and girls. But not good enough. Hey, baby. You... What are you? If you want to kill me... ...you'll need to bring an army. Bastard! I'll give you power... ...in death! It's him! No, we have to go! No, he is... Please, let's go! Hurry! Hurts? Human life is only an instant. Your body will eventually rot. Do you want to be dead? Or eternal life? Eternal... Any trouble? Yes, a little accident. Are you okay, officer? Don't call me officer. Did you do it again? You better behave yourself. Or, you'll be joining those idiots on the mountain... ...officer. You want to fight me? The master of all martial arts? The Fighter? Okay, Fighter. Fighter? We don't have time for this crap. Those criminal bastards! Let's kill them all! Right, Fighter. Hey, your heart! I'll give you this... Help yourself! H-Hot, hot, hot! Mother fucker! I'll show you the world beyond death... What's wrong? We should hurry! What's going on? Come on, let's go. I'll tell you something... I hate to turn my back. We don't have time for this. That man is dangerous... Who the hell is he? You know him, right? He's... Cut the crap already! I don't know him at all! Who the hell is he? And who are you? What does this have to do with me? Because... Say it! It is your... ...destiny. What? You two are... ...destined to fight each other. What are you talking about? I've never even met him before. You have... What? The Resurrection... Stay back. We'll talk later. It's time. You said something about Resurrection... What were you talking about? The power of returning the dead soul back to the body. It can be used only in the Forest of Resurrection. Now what? The Forest of Resurrection... Is where we are. I don't understand. It's him... ...he is resurrecting the dead... ...with the Power. What are talking about? What Resurrection? I was able to kill them. That's because... Who's that? Is this one dead too? No, that girl's alive. Hey, what are you? Hey! Please, no killing! Because... I thought you were going to lose. You know what? I never lose. Hot, hot! What the hell? Stop. Huh? They're around here... What? I can smell... Smell? I can smell like a dog... Like a top dog breeder. Like a dog breeder? I smell... Look. An escapee. We have our death warrant! Go! Die! What? Dammit... T-This way! No, this way... Wait, this way! Bitch! W-Wait a minute! You're not a monster... You are not a monster... Let me talk, bitch! Speak. You're not a monster yet, right? Neither are you, right? W-Wait a minute! Don't misunderstand me! I was just taken here... Bitch! It seems like... ...we are the only survivors... ...Baby. What's going on? I don't know... But we need to get out of here, that's for sure. Hey, you want to come with me? Why would I? I know this forest very well. I'd be a big help. That's a good point. However... One wrong move... ...and you're dead. I know that. You... You've changed. Get up. Hey... You really don't remember anything? What the hell are you talking about? About me... Don't you remember? I've never seen you before. Why... Why did you help me then? I told you. I didn't mean to help. You came after me... ...and you saved me. You said something about my destiny... What is going on? I will tell you. It's you... You're still alive. Impressive. So, you caused all of this. I knew you could survive no matter what. I don't know you at all. What do you want? It's fine that you don't know me, because your soul does... You're making things complicated. What are you up to? It's time. Give me the girl and come with me. Don't be stupid. Hey, hey, what are you two talking about? I don't like this at all. This guy doesn't remember anything? Really? Leave us alone. I can't do that. I've waited... Are you going to tell me what you're up to? He wants me dead. What? I'll grant you power. Why don't you come with me? I'll take care of her later. Let's talk now. What's going on? The girl's blood gives me power. This is the Forest of Resurrection. A Gate... A portal to the other side... Where the dead become zombies... That was ajoke. That was nothing compared to the real power. A great power is hidden in this forest. The darkness on the other side... You need two keys to open the gate there... One is a human sacrifice. And the other key is... ...the one with the Blood of Resurrection. I found them... Five hundred years ago. You're totally insane. Just shut up and come with me. I'll show you... ...the power of darkness. You know what? I hate being told what to do. It's no use. You can't kill me. So just shut up and listen to what I have to say. I don't want to listen. Because you interrupted me... ...I had to wait five hundred years for her to reincarnate. It's been a long time. But it's okay. I forgive you. I've waited for her to reincarnate and mature. I've been waiting for today. The power of the Forest of Resurrection and her matured blood... ...will open the gate to the other side. I finally found you, but you were in jail. I never expected you to be in jail. And what's more... You were serving a life term as a serious criminal who committed disturbing crimes. Why... Did you make me come here? I like you better as a criminal now. You used to be an awful man... You believed in this stupid idea ofjustice, and you really made me suffer. In the end, you did something really stupid. But you've changed quite a bit. That's why I brought you here. I'll forgive what you've done in the past. Don't let me down this time. Why don't you get lost? You now have the heart of a serious criminal. How many people have you killed so far? Forty three people as of today... That's my little brother. Brother? Do you feel that? The power of this forest... People are born... ...live... ...and die. The darkness after death... ...is what's real... I'm going to open that door. Come with me. Follow your instincts. What your heart really wants... ...is darkness. I'd rather die than live with you. Then die. As I planned... Get the girl. I'd rather die that let you touch me. I'd rather die! Still a bitch... That man could never save you. Not the last time. And not this time. You've finished playing your role. It looks like you'll never grow up. I've waited... The Forest of Resurrection... I've returned here after so many years... ...so open the gate in exchange for her blood. And grant me power... Grant me the power! Why? How come nothing is happening? Why is nothing happening? My Blood of Resurrection... ...only works once. I've already used it. Can you wait until I reincarnate... ...again? You... I'll kill you! You wanted me to kill you in a moment of anger, right? However, you can't fool me. I won't let you interfere with my plan. Your blood is not good enough. Your blood cannot open the gate. Your blood is not enough! You know why? Figured it out yet? Do you know why I brought that man here? That's right... He was able to resurrect with your blood. That man's resurrected blood is the true key. I wanted to see that expression on your face. That face... Hey. You talk too much. Here he comes... ...the last key. It took me a while to remember. I'm the one you want, right? Don't touch my girl, fucking asshole! You want to do it now? Or... Do you want to play? Wait for me... Don't worry. I never lose. Stay there. Wait here. This is between him and me. One of us will return. He's different now. You might lose this time. Maybe... We'll see what happens... You have to work for what you really want. Right? Freeze... Freeze... I said, freeze! Leave the car. What was that? What did you say, what did you say, you runt? I said, we're taking your car! We are looking for escapees! Out of my way! So you are a Fighter. I can tell. Give me the car, that's all I'm saying! Shut up, you asshole! I'm sick of this place. I'm really sorry. You short-ass bitch! Come on, get in the car! T-That hurt! Hey, let's go! That was your partner! This is not my fault! Hey! I've found you! Prisoner number KSC2-303! Give me my right hand back! Hey, I'd have two left hands! You can't hit me with your slow bullets! My reflexes are... ...five hundred times faster than Mike Tyson's! Come on! Oops! Just like last time... No matter how much power you've gained, you can't beat me. The darkside has chosen me. I won't let you stand in my way. I told you... I never lose. Listen... What? You came back... ...because of the forest and my blood. If you leave this forest... You might die. Maybe... But that's fine... We'll see what happens. I hate to be locked up in one place. I should have been on your side. There's nothing left to destroy in this world. Hurry up and take me to the other side... ...brother. Just stop it!
