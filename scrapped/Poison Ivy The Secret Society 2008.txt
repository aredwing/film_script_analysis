 

                        Alexis. Alexis. Alexis. Will... Will, no. No, maybe we shouldn't do this. But, I mean, you're going tomorrow. I thought that you'd want to. I do... ...but it's only gonna make things harder for me. You... I love you, you know. I know. I just... I wish that was enough. It's not? It used to be. Too many painful memories here. Look, you gotta move on into the future, okay? That's what I'm trying to do. That's why I have to go. No, I was talking about our future. You make it sound so final. You see all this? I put the money down last week. It's mine or ours. I can't believe you did this. I just thought that maybe you'd change your mind. It's been a year since I lost my parents, Will. You don't know what that's like. I have to go. Oh, a taxi. How quaint. I love transfer students. Now, here's one arriving in style. "Christa Caldwell, 3.8 GPA, transfer from Rambling College. Captain of the volleyball team." Tell me what I wanna hear. She comes from three generations of Texas oil. That we like. Get her dorm number. Oh, my God. - Here comes Miss Taxi. Wow. Okay, I gotta get this one. All right, here we go. "Danielle Brooks, 4.0 GPA. And she's a government major." Aw, she sold her late parents' land to pay for school... ...and yet she's still on a work-study program. Must have been some house. Guys, her nickname is Daisy. Aw... - Next. - Yeah. - Need a hand? - No, no, it's all right. Heh. You know, there's, uh, a lot to say for a new piece of luggage. - Yeah, well, I've had this piece forever. - Yeah, it looks it. It's not that. I mean, we've been through a lot together. This is the luggage we're talking about? It's a long story. Heh. Well, I can see you two have a lot of history. How is that? It's all broken up about you going to a new school. I am so embarrassed. - Well, let me help. - No, really. No, no, no, please, I live for these small moments of altruism. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So are you here with anyone? No, I'm alone. I'm looking for the girls' dorm. Alone and looking for the girls' dorm: story of my life. Heh. I'll tell you what, why don't I save you the agony of trying to read this map... ...and give you and your 1972 luggage door-to-door service? I'm Daisy, by the way. Blake. It's, uh, that way. Everything look good to you so far? - Yeah. All right. Well, the, uh, library is down there. Student Union building is over there. You're through here. Oh, my God. What happened? Uh, Alexis Baldwin. She was a student here. Last semester she fell to her death. That's horrible. Yeah. After you. Okay. Wow, I feel so underdressed. You kidding? You look fantastic. Heh. You're just full of compliments, aren't you? - They bug you? - No. - Because I can change tactics. - Heh. This is it. Great. Thanks for your help. No problem. See you around, Daisy. - Bye. - Bye. Hi, I'm Daisy. I'm your new roommate. - Daisy? - Well, Danielle, originally, but... Not a local, I take it? No, a little town on the outskirts of Iowa. You're not bringing a bunch of chickens in with you, are you? Um, you must be Margaret Hart. Magenta. Magenta, are you a film major? - Minor. Poli-sci major. - Me too. Uh, careful with that, Daisy May. That's a camera, not a tractor. Oh, no! - What? - Wilbur. - Who's Wilbur? - He's my pet tarantula. He was here just a minute ago. A freaking tarantula? That's disgusting. Where is it? Wait, I left him at home with the chickens. I just plum forgot about that. Heh. That's real cute. It's nice to meet you, Daisy. Nice to meet you, Magenta. That's the professor? He's not like my teachers back home. You mean cute? Ogling the teachers? Advanced Political Theory. Mighty impressive for a freshman. Listen... ...thanks for the luggage, but I can't... - Accept them? - Candy from a stranger, that kind of thing? - Yeah. Thank you, though. Well, tell you what, why don't you just hang on to them for a few days... ...and then when we're no longer strangers, keep them. Morning, class, and welcome to Advanced Political Theory. My name is Professor Andrew Graves... ...and, uh, before we begin this semester... ...I wanna say a word about the upcoming PEIP exam. That's Political and Economic Internship Program. Eight weeks, paid, working in Washington, D. C... ...shadowing administration officials, senators, congressmen. Let's face it, this is the Holy Grail of political science. This is a terrific opportunity. I encourage each and every one of you to take advantage of it. So for those who are interested, raise your hands. I'll give you a copy of the study guide. Little eager, Miss Daisy? Mr. Graves. I didn't know you were enrolled in my class. Actually, Professor Graves, I'm not. Just here to make sure everyone gets their syllabi. - Well, thank you. - You're very welcome. So... ...you doing anything Friday night? - No. Excellent. You're good, you know that? No is the correct answer. So dinner will be at 8:00. Now, can anyone explain? That was shameful. I thought it was kind of cute. Ah, I guess it runs in the family. Anyone? I'll see you later. - Okay. Uh, Miss Brooks? I just wanted to, uh, welcome you. I mean, you know that you're the first underclassman that's been allowed in here? Thank you. It's nice to know those late nights paid off. Good for you. It was a good choice to volunteer for the internship. - That kind of program can change your life. - That's why I'm here. Good. I just hope it's not to date my son. He is persistent. Yes. Persistently inappropriate, to be sure. Dean Graves' office. Yes, okay, I'll get her to call you back as soon as possible. May I help you? Yeah. Hi, my name is Danielle Brooks. I was assigned to work here. - Oh, you're the new office assistant. - Yes. Welcome. Just give me a sec. Dean Graves, Danielle Brooks is here. - You must be Daisy. - Yes. Please come in. Tell Miss Starr I'm running a little late, okay? Sit down. I've had the pleasure of speaking with your former principal. He expects to see your name on a ballot someday. Ha, well, I'm not sure about that. I think you'll find Beckshire to be a really good fit for someone with your potential. Well, this is the chance of a lifetime... ...and I just really hope I can live up to your expectations. Well, I'm confident you will. Thank you. Nice digs, if you've gotta live with your mommy and daddy. - Are we breaking and entering now, Azalea? - Just entering. I haven't broken anything... ...yet. Right, well, I think that's still illegal. - Not in my world. - Ha. Azalea's world. Such an interesting place that must be. Wouldn't you like to know? You flatter yourself too much, Lea. I gave up chasing you years ago. Is that how you like to remember it? Well, there were those nasty rumors. Rumors? Not familiar. Oh, no. You know, the ones where you swore off men? Hmm. I bet you're just dying to find out. What do you want, Lea? C's and D's on my transcript. Since the arrival of your mother last year prompted a sudden downturn in my GPA. Really, I'm terribly sorry to hear that. Maybe you should try... ...I don't know, studying for a change. Of course, I'm sure you'll find a way to persuade your professors. Easy ones have been transferred to different schools. Sorry, Lea, can't change your grades. We'll get to that. Ah... Right now, what I wanna know... ...is if this jeopardizes my chances at the internship. After all, it is traditionally granted to the head of the Ivys. By professors that are no longer here. Yes, but your daddy... ...is the head of the new board, the whole program. And there might be some... ...idle chitchat... ...or discussion around the breakfast table that might shed some insight. Maybe I can help out. Please. You know, I had it on the tip of my... Maybe I can jog your memory. I'm sure you can. Still foggy. Oh... I'm sorry, did you think I was wearing panties? Are you? What you have... ...better be what I want. That's funny. I was gonna say the same thing. Bite it. Let's skip the cuddling. I don't know, Lea. I'm still a little bit cloudy. Relax. One name is being mentioned as far as the prized internship is concerned. And that is? Daisy. What? That hillbilly freshman? Are you joking? Dad seems smitten by her, and, I mean, let's be real, what's not to like? - Ugh, you've got to be kidding. - Ha, ha. Whatever you say, Lea, but the girl is gold... ...and unfortunately for you, she's one of the few you don't own. Hmm. I'll own her like a pet. - A pet? - Mm-hm. You looking for a new friend? Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Oh, well, turning the farm girl into an Ivy... ...is not gonna stop her from getting the internship. Yeah, we'll see about that. So tell me... ...how can we fix those naughty grades of mine? Oh, yeah. Well, I might have a friend... ...who has a friend who's privy to classified information, passwords and such. He might have the information you're looking for, but there would be a price. We could make this a regular thing. Been there, done that, bought the T-shirt. - I could bring a friend. - Ah... Now we're talking. Isabel seems like a nice girl. Issy is a nice girl. I should know. Now, you hack into your mommy's little computer... ...and I'll make sure your little perverted fantasies come true. Deal? See what I can do. Wow. We are gathered here in the name of the sisterhood... ...founded in the strength of her members, preserved by their accomplishments. Each year, the sisterhood nominates new women for membership. These names are not to be written down anywhere nor spoken in public. There are two names up for consideration. Three names. I hereby nominate... ...Christa Caldwell... ...Monique Price... ...and Daisy Brooks. Good morning. - Hey. Hey, what's this box? I don't know. It was delivered yesterday. Ugh. He is a real gift-giving fool. Heh. It's a cell phone. - What? - That's not from Blake. - What do you mean? How do you know? - Looks like you're being tapped by the Ivys. - Wait, the what? - Technically, they don't exist. Technically, there's no sororities or fraternities here anymore... ...but the Ivys, they're a secret society. Why did they give this to me? Beats me. If the Ivys want you, there's a good reason for it. - Do they want you? - Heh. Trust me, they don't want me. I'll see you later. Um, I put the photocopies on, uh, Dean Graves' desk. Great, thanks. I can't. Hello, Dean Graves' office. Yeah, we'll send someone right over. Daisy? Admissions just called. Can you go over and pick up some files for us? Yeah, yeah, sure. Hi, Daisy. Is this from you? Keep it. I'm Azalea. We're in Professor Graves' class. Right. Look, I'm just not really sure what this is all about. It's not easy, is it? I'm sorry? Losing your parents. I lost my mother when I was 8... ...and my dad's been on, like, a 10-year business trip, so I know, it sucks. Yeah, it does. But it doesn't have to. We can help you, Daisy. We can help redefine family for you. Give you back that security blanket that I know you miss. Let us help you. I do pretty well on my own. Sure you do, for now. I mean, you'll do well here and graduate, even with honors, and then what? You'll be dead broke and owe thousands in student bills... ...and be stuck in some dead-end job you're tied to... ...because you can't afford to take a risk. A risk for something greater. That won't be me. The statistics say otherwise. We can change that. Think about it. Disrupt any good lectures today? Only with my brilliance. What, that's it? Come on, Dad... ...don't stop the momentum now. That was an awesome conversation starter. Well? It's official. Alexis Baldwin's death has been ruled an accident. The investigation is being dropped. Maybe now we can all find some closure. Hopefully. Well, forgive me if dealing with a student's death... ...a grieving family and restoring the reputation of this university... ...has inconvenienced you in some way. Now, here's the old Graves family chats we've come to know and love. Joining us for dinner? Actually, as appealing as that sounds... ...I have a date... ...with Daisy Brooks. So it was either a night out with you... ...or another fantastic dinner with my Norman Rockwell family. Must be nice to be around your parents so much. Uh, if by "nice" you mean "suffocating," then, yeah, totally. Heh, I just don't know if anyone really wants their parents around all the time. I'm sorry. I totally for... That was way inappropriate. That's okay. Your father says you're persistently inappropriate. You speak to my father? Oh, yeah, we're real close. That makes one of us. So you two don't get along? That's an understatement. Can we not talk about my parents? - Sure. - Thank you. How about we talk about you? Why do you like me, Blake? What do you mean? I mean, all the girls on campus, and you're with me, the farm girl. That's probably exactly why I like you. You're different. Yeah? Trust me, it's refreshing. Refreshing? Heh. Lemonade is refreshing. Iced tea is refreshing. I didn't mean it like that. Then how did you mean it? Well... ...not only are you incredibly beautiful... ...but you're also funny... ...and smart... ...and sweet. Go on. Good morning, Mother. You slept out last night. I did. Guess it's safe to assume the date went well? Gotta tell you, she's one nice girl. Anything else? She's been tapped. By you or by them? Both, actually. You won't be seeing her anymore. What if I like her? Then like her from a distance. Blake? You've reached the automated Blake. Leave a message and the real Blake will get back to you. Hey, it's Nadia. How soon can you come into the office? What's going on? Daisy... ...there's a problem with your tuition installments. What? Apparently, your payments have been defaulted. - But that's impossible. - Don't worry, I'm sure it's a glitch. But you do have to figure this out with the bank, otherwise... ...well, the system will automatically withdraw you... ...from the college, and you'll have to reapply next year. I'm sorry. You're so cute! Hi, you've reached the automated Blake. Fantastic. What happened? My loan. I guess I didn't fill out the right forms or something... ...and they've frozen my account. Well, I'm sure it's just a mistake. You'll get it all figured out. If I lose my loan, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I can't go home. It'll be okay. Why don't you come out with me tonight? You sure? Basement? Hello? Is anybody down here? Daisy. Daisy. Daisy. Daisy. Daisy. Daisy. Daisy. Stand. We have gathered here today for your initiation... ...into the Sisterhood of the Ivys. Founded in the strength of its members, preserved in their accomplishments. Repeat after me. Work together to accomplish more. These words may not mean much to you now... ...but believe me, to an Ivy... ...they mean everything. No longer will you be alone in the world. From this room, we have spawned senators, governors, CEOs. Thanks to each other, they have managed to break down social barriers. All women, all Ivys. And you... You have been called upon to continue this tradition. Do you accept this honor? So meek. Has the world got its grip on you already? Answer. I accept. I accept. I accept. Kneel before your new sisters. All matters are dealt with within these walls. Outside this room, we are not even a rumor. We are a whisper. You will obey your older sisters. Do not question them. Trust is everything. And if you should feel pain... ...we all bleed. And when you succeed... ...we all succeed. And believe me... ...you will succeed. "I solemnly swear... ...to hold the bonds of the Ivy girls higher than all others." The power of the Ivy is transcendent. Drink and join your new sisters. What is it? Trust in the solidarity of your sisters. Now, ladies. Table. Undress and lay face down. This bond unites us as women... ...and binds us as sisters. Repeat. This bond... ...unites us as women... ...and binds us as sisters. Ivys are a family. We share everything. Our love... ...our hate... ...our pain. Everything. Welcome to the Ivys. Hurry, come on. We're late. They approved my loan? Now, once executive privilege is asserted... ...the various branches of government are set on a collision course... Miss Brooks. - towards destruction. Now, the judiciary is forced into a difficult task... ...of balancing the need for information on a judicial proceeding... ...and the executive's prerogative. Mr. Graves. - Girls, did you enjoy the class? - Yeah, we did. Hey, how are you doing? You were like a zombie this morning. Yeah, I just studied way too late. Well, did you get that whole loan thing figured out? Mm-hm. Yeah. Some weird clerical error. It's okay. - That's great. Did you wanna...? - Nice hair, Magenta. Never mind. How you feeling this morning, Little Miss Daisy? Not so good, but I'm gonna feel better when I apologize to Professor Graves. You're not quite getting the whole Ivy thing yet, are you? Daisy, we take care of our own. I'll handle it. Besides, look at yourself. Yeah, I just woke up late. Oh, sweetie, it's more than just that. You're an Ivy girl now. You need to dress like it. Now, go wait in the hall. That was a great class, Andrew. Well, thank you, Miss Berges. You can call me Azalea. I have known you since I was in middle school. I have two questions for you. - Okay. - My first one is: Do you think that a young woman can be sexually compatible with an older man? Excuse me? My human sexuality class is having us do surveys... ...on certain aspects of relationships, and I need a few more unbiased subjects. I may not be the right person to answer that question. Oh, you're perfect. Old enough for you to have seen it all, yet still young enough where you can relate. I guess, uh... ...on a case-by-case basis, a relationship could work well. Everyone's different. And being that women do mature... ...quicker than men, physiologically... ...yes, a relationship could work quite well. That makes a lot of sense. Stamina... ...hormones. I bet they match up a lot nicer at that stage. Now, my second question to you would be: Is there anything extra that I can do... ...in any way to help further my chances with the internship? On a completely different note. Just keep your grades up. Do well on the exam. Of course, but you would tell me... ...if there were anything... ...extracurricular-wise I could do or maybe put more... ...effort into. Get back to you on that. You know where to find me. What's that for? Before. - Before what? - "Before" picture... ...soon to be followed by an "after" picture. I don't follow. Of course you don't. Let's go. The blond's hot. Ugh, here comes trouble. There's Blake. Great, I'm out of here. Daisy. - Hey. - Let go of me. Wow. You, uh, look different. No, in a good way. Would you please just look at me for a second? Don't listen to his B.S. What's she saying? Whatever you think of me right now, it's not the case. Really, so you didn't just sleep with me and then completely ignore me? You blew me off, Blake. I saw you with that other girl. Are you kidding me? She was nobody. - She was a friend. Look... - Don't let him get to you. Daisy, I like you. Things are complicated, but if you give me a chance to explain myself... You had a chance to explain, two days ago. You blew it, Blake. Goodbye. Good girl, Daisy. - Daisy. Wow, I need your financial-aid program. Nice, huh? Heh. You've assimilated. Let's just say I found my fashion sense. And lost your common sense. No, I haven't. So is being an Ivy living up to all its hype? - Hype? - Well, I mean, it's a lifelong commitment. Well, I don't know. I think I just needed to let go. There's letting go and then there's being an idiot. Have I given you a hard time about your look? My look I do for me, not for somebody else. I think I like the tarantula-carrying country girl better. It's just clothes, Magenta. Don't fool yourself. Those girls want something from you, and it's not your money, that's for sure. Oh, so they can't like me for who I am? No, Daisy, that's the point. They can't. Why don't you go ask your friends about Alexis Baldwin? What about Alexis Baldwin? Isn't she the girl that died last semester? She was my last roommate. They tapped her... ...and now she's dead. Wait, but that was just an accident. Everybody knows that. Yeah, everybody but me. Well, here comes the conspiracy theory. You know what, forget it. Oh, and some guy named Will called. He sounded nice. Hello. Hey, it's me. I got your message. I really miss you guys. It's so big here, it makes me realize how small home is. Perspective does amazing things. It's so different. I'm just starting to make some friends. That's great, Daisy... ...really. So maybe we'll be lucky enough out here to get a visit over the next summer. - Yeah, how's your home coming along? - It's coming along great. I should probably have the foundation of our... Of the, uh, ahem, place done by then. I miss you, Daisy. I miss you too. Look at you. Heh. What? Daisy, I'd like to see you in my office, please. Is something wrong? It's about your scholarship. Your application was reviewed, and, well, they awarded you one, in full. Congratulations, you deserve it. It must be a relief not to have to work here anymore. Wow, I mean, I don't even know what to say. This is incredible, but I would still like to work here. I'm not the type to quit in the middle of something. Well, we would love to keep you on. You've been a valuable asset to us. You replaced the dean mid-semester last year, right? Yes. Was that because of the death on campus? Yes, that had something to do with it, but not everything. Why do you ask? Well, I'm rooming with her old roommate, Magenta Hart. It was an accident, right? I've heard all the rumors too, but, no, in the end it was a terrible accident. Unless, of course, you've heard to the contrary. No. Congratulations again, Daisy. Thank you. Ladies. Come to honor our agreement? Only if you've honored yours. You're serious. And you weren't? - Heh. Lea told me all about it. I'm totally into it. Well, then I think we should find a place a little more comfortable. The minute my grades are changed, we're all yours. So, what's the holdup? The passwords change every week. I don't know what time they change, so... Is little Blakey scared? It's big Blakey, remember? And you rocket scientists are confusing smart and cautious for scared. Smart and cautious or just stalling? Not stalling. So then you have the passwords? I might have this week's password. Where might that be? It might be in my pocket. Ooh. Nothing there, Blakey. Oh, there's something there. Check the other. If you're messing with me... I mean it. Let's go, Issy. You're reneging on our agreement. No. Just making sure everything's on the up and up. Oh, it will be. And, uh... ...even if you do manage to get your grades changed, there's still Daisy. Daisy's an Ivy, just like I said she'd be. Well, just because the empress has some new clothes... ...doesn't mean she's gonna fall on her sword. She'll fall, they all do. I can make her do whatever I want. - Really? - Mm-hm. And you just better make sure those passwords are right, and I won't have to. Bye. It's nice to have Blakey wrapped around your finger. Isn't it though? And... Sure beats studying. Oh, no, he didn't. What a liar. That really pisses me off. It's time for plan B. I think that's why Blake has to sleep with every girl he sees. He's making up for the fact that his father can't even get with his own mother. Pathetic. Sorry, Daisy, we didn't mean... No, it's okay. I'm so over it. What's going on? Daisy. Daisy, wait. I'm sorry you had to see that. I can't believe he taped us. He's a man. How could he stoop so low? He taped you, Daisy. You have to hit him back, hard. No, just... Just drop it. I don't wanna make the situation worse. If someone throws eggs at your house... ...you burn theirs down. Now, are you truly... ...ready to become an Ivy? Yeah, so make sure you do it. Here we go. Four minutes? Let's go. It's clear. This is your thing. Do it. I can't. There is no can't. Did he hesitate when he took advantage of you? Blake doesn't deserve this. Wrong answer. I'm out of here. We'll be taking a closer look at governmental policy... ...which maintains a separation of power through checks and balances. - Not a good show last night, Miss Daisy. - What you did was wrong. - What he did was worse. - But he did it to me. That's where you're wrong. You belong to a family now. I thought you knew that. Well, maybe I didn't quite understand. Well, now you do. Don't you? This is for life. You better get used to that. Sorry. We forgive you, Daisy. You're young, and you don't quite understand how it all works yet. But... ...if you ever cross your sisters again... ...it will be, oh, so ugly if you do. Everyone get your questions together. Your opening statements. That's enough for today. Try to read through to chapter 27 before the next class, and thank you. Ms. Brooks. Can I speak to you for a moment? Everything okay? Usually a point of mine doesn't go by... ...without you coming up with some new question. Yeah, yeah, I'm just cramming for another class. The majority of the essays have been turned in. I heard, and I'm just finishing mine up. There's two weeks left before the exam. Let's pull it together. - You gave my car a nice paint job. - I don't know what you're talking about. I get it. Azalea put you up to it. Yeah, just like that video you leaked on the Internet. There's no use explaining that I had nothing to do with that. And I had nothing to do with your car. Now we're even. Bye, Blake. Hey. - That's that Internet girl. The girl from that... Oh, yeah, ride me, baby, yeah. - Oh, my God. She's, like, strutting her thing. I swear. That was a 10. We need to talk. Yes, drama. My father had dinner with Senator Mitchell last night. They got to talking about the internship... ...and it seems somebody's already been chosen. And it's not Daisy. Well, who is it? It's not you, Azalea. It's Magenta Hart. What? That rainbow-haired corpse? I know, Blake flat-out lied to us. He lied about the passwords and about the internship. Maybe he's been playing games with you all along. Really? The Graves have declared war on the Ivys. If it's war they want, I'll give it to them. Have the police questioned you about Blake's car? No. Good. Honestly, I'm relieved. Look... ...Daisy... ...in life, you'd hope that people do the right thing, and rarely... ...that's the case. But you're being used by people that are trying to take us away from you. Do you wanna be an Ivy? Well, you said it was for life. What choice do I have? There's always a choice. You just have to be able to deal with the repercussions. Is that a threat? Sweetheart... ...who do you think made your financial-aid problems go away? Who do you think gave you your scholarship? And it doesn't end there. What about your little Will back home? Are you ready for that? Ready to take the innocent down with you? How do you know about Will? It's called leverage, Daisy. I have stashed away this piece of paper... ...and at the top it says "Land Deed," at the bottom, a name... ...and it's "William Miller." What did you do with Will's land? If you can walk away with this and see it as a learning experience... ...I think we have a future together. Who do you think you're messing with? You think we don't cover all our bases? Now, I'm gonna ask you one last time... ...because I'm nice: Are you an Ivy? Yes. Good. Now you're gonna have to prove it. What do you want me to do? I'm in the courtyard. The main door should be open. - Go through it. - But that's the administration building. You said I was going through the dorms. I did. Change of plans. Okay, I'm in the hall, and I'm kind of freaked out right now. Okay, down the hall there's a janitor's closet. Go in it. Okay, I'm going in. Now, take your jacket off. What? Put it in the closet. Leave it here? You didn't think you were gonna get all dolled up for nothing? What does this have to do with anything? Trust is everything. Now, lose it. Okay, now what? Now go back in the hall and up the stairs, one floor. Where am I going, Azalea? First door on the right. But what's up here? Don't ask, just do. Professor Graves' office? Exactly. Now, quietly open the door. But he's in there. We know. Kicked out again by the missis. Probably getting off on some Internet porn. You will be a refreshing sight. Come on, what am I doing here? Daisy, you're going to go in and make the poor man feel better. You're going to have sex with him. - What? - You go in there and do this. This isn't gonna help anything. Will's land is at stake here. Think about what you're saying. Are you turning your back on your sisters again? Daisy has left the building. It's too predictable. Do I have to do everything around here myself? What are you doing here? Couldn't sleep. So you came over here? Highly inappropriate. Go home, Azalea. Inappropriate is you here alone at night. Well, that's my business, isn't it? Oops. - Give me the keys. - No. - Give me the keys. - No. You deserve... ...so much more. You have no idea what I deserve. Really? Is it complicated? You're crossing way over the line here. And I think you... I think you assumed a little too much. But you're miserable. I can see it every day in class. You are overworked... ...and unloved. Heh, Andrew... ...I was born into neglect. I can't imagine marrying it. I need to be free, to feel. Don't you miss that? Don't you want that? No! - I can't do it. I'm sorry too. - I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm surrounded by people all the time, and I'm alone. I thought you might understand. I'm sorry. Here. Your son was better. What's happening? I think a professor was killed. What? Who? Professor Graves. Miss Danielle Brooks? - Yes. Detective Morgan Hadrian. I'm investigating the murder of Professor Graves. Can we speak in private? Is it true you had a relationship with Professor Graves' son? We went out once, yes. Nothing more? If you mean, is there a video on the Internet showing me having sex with Blake? Yes, there is. And the relationship? It's over, it's been over. - You seem upset about that. - The video, yes. The relationship, no. So there'd be no reason to torch the car, right? I mean, no reason to kill his dad. I didn't do any of those things. You worked for Elisabeth Graves as well, correct? - Yes. - You see... ...you seem to have a lot of access to the Graves. Andrew's class... ...you worked for Elisabeth, dated the son... Well, we are gonna be going over that building with a fine-tooth comb. Fingerprints results should be back in about a day or so. But until then, please don't leave campus. as information becomes available. Again Professor Andrew Graves, husband of Dean Elisabeth Graves... ... was found murdered in his office early this morning. Can you believe this? No. We'll continue to bring you all the latest on this developing story as... Know anything about it? Why would I? Because this has the mark of the Ivys. Wake up, Daisy. You're sleeping with wolves. My little Daisy. I'm so glad you called. You went to see him after I left... ...didn't you? You were scared... ...and you let your sisters down. It's upsetting. You... You killed him. Not me. Your dainty little fingerprints are all over that place. I can't believe you did this. You're such a sweet thing. There's something almost envious about you. Almost. Blake... - Wasn't you, was it? - No. Blake, I know. I am so sorry. I just want it all back. - We need to do something. Call the police. - No, we can't. We can't just take this to the police. Why? - This has been going on for way too long. - Listen to me. If you do, my mother will be forced to deny it. She'll cover the whole thing up. The dean of students is gonna cover...? Oh, my God. She's an Ivy, isn't she? Daisy, you're not here by accident. You were handpicked to clean up the Ivys. Listen to me. You have no idea how big this is. You can't out a billion-dollar secret organization with a phone call. They'll do anything they can to cover it up. Blood will be shed. Blood has been shed. More blood. I can't believe you used me. All of you. Even your mom. Yeah... God, I am so naive. Daisy... ...you can't stop them. I've learned one thing from the Ivys. If someone eggs your house, burn theirs down. I'm scared. Come here, little Daisy. I'm so sorry. I should never have betrayed you. My sisters... ...the Ivys, they're all I have left. Alexis was like you, Daisy. But she made the wrong choice. She turned her back on her sisters. And we had to take care of her. But we did things our way. It was an accident, and that's exactly what Professor Graves will be. Just another terrible... ...accident. They can't hurt us, Daisy. When you're an Ivy... ...you can get away with murder. Trust me. I did. And you betrayed me. And now consider the favor paid in full. What are you doing? I'm keeping my enemy close. Very close. You bitch! Azalea, stop it! You've gone too far. You guys gotta help. It's Azalea, she's gone crazy. I've got a pulse. When you're an Ivy... ... you can get away with murder. Couldn't you have come up with a tougher name? Usually they call it something like Horseshoe Ranch... ...or Rusty Nail Ranch, but Daisy Ranch? Guys might laugh, Will. Heh, yeah, they already did. Leave it up to me to give it a man's touch, huh? What are you doing here, Daisy? Some stuff happened at school, and I kind of got the rest of the semester off. You're okay. Everything's fine, right? Yeah, yeah, I got straight A's on my last semester... ...and a full scholarship for the next four years. Wow, heh. That sounds great. It sounds like you got everything figured out. Everything except... ...you. What do you mean? You know what I mean, Will. So, uh, you're here for...? For the summer, at least. And then you go back. For the next four years. And then? Well, I guess we have to figure it out as we go... ...together. Hey, you got a tattoo. Yeah, do you like it? Yeah, it's a great-looking daisy.
