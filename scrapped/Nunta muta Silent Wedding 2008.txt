Do you know the way? Not really. Let's go, I'll show you. I don't understand... What's this Paramedia? We make films about paranormal stuff... ...then sell them to the highest bidder. Mr Cretu, also called Donald, is the driver... ...he's Runcu, photographer and smooth operator... ...and Mafalda, the sound operator, editor and Psychic. Gogonea. Tell me Mayor... ...have strange things been going on for a long time? First, there was that girl, when I was just a boy... ...and I was called Gogonica. Come on, forget that girl. Tell us what's happening now. Like the elections in '45? Everyone voted Liberal, and the communists won. Forget that tool. We want today's paranormal stuff. What's normal these days? Is this the new road? Turn the fucking music down! Is this the new road? Built with European money. Not enough to go round. Mafalda, don't you feel anything strange around here? Yes, a strange need to piss. My kidneys are in a total mess. Any nature-friendly loos around here? Sure, everywhere! Nothing more friendly than this! And zero investment. We're fighting the effects of the drought... ...and as for irrigation... Will the film be broadcast by the end of the month? There'll be the local elections. I'm not sure. It depends on what we uncover here. Slow down. Get a photo of that old woman. Who is she? What used to be here? A village. The communists destroyed it to build a factory. Now that's being destroyed by the capitalists... ...to rebuild a village. A holiday village! What have we got here, mate? Fresh meat. Canned and past its sell-by date. It's Marinela. Hi there Marinela! Boys, how do you prefer it? Altogether or one at a time? Marinela, don't make a fool of yourself. They're from the Television. Oh really? So sorry. I'm wearing cotton panties. Let's have a look. Come on handsome, are you brave enough? Well no, I'm not. Too badl I would've taught you things... ...that few girls know nowadays! Marinela I Cretu I I used to work at the Post Office. That's enough! I charged per word at work... ...and by inch at home. I used to be the slut of the village! Right, Gogonica? Right! Enough talking! I like a quick chat and a long, long fuck! Come on, boys! Who wants to be first? Get your hands off me, kiddo! You should talk to the committee about me teaching! What do you want to teach? Religion! Stop the car! Mayor, tell me what happened here. Lancu, your father's calling you! I won't! Shut your fucking mouth! Shut up! If it's not him, it's another. If he's not bad, he's good enough! I will not! So, the slut's come home! Leave her alone! Shut up or I'll give you a good hiding! You've always taken her side... ...now lancu Vrabie is fucking her! Are you mad? Don't talk back to me! Where have you been? To get lamp oil. Where is it then? They had run out. Out of oil? Rubbish! Let me tell you where you were... Getting laid by lancu! Not even wearing underwear. Dirty old man! Shut up! Don't touch me or I'll set you on fire! Well, I'm off to the store... ...to check they're out of oil. If not, I'll make you drink some! Sure! You're going to the bar! Shut up, woman! No, I won't! Come to Daddy, my baby. I made you when I was drunk... ...but you're gonna get all my fortune. The communists will get it. Do you hear how she speaks to me? I could strangle her! Go on Dad, go get drunk... ...and cheers to you and yours. My little girl... Daddy's beautiful clever little girl! Lucky guy, that lancu Vrabie to get you. You slut! Leave her alone. Don't bother cooking tonight Fira... ...you'll be drinking lamp oil. Both of you! And put that one to work... ...not even fuckable.

Hey, Uncle Vrabie! What's up? What have you two been up to? We were checking the corn in Aschie's field. Did Mara Aschie happen to be there? She was indeed. Why aren't you straight with her? If you're already involved with her, marry her! These are no times to get married. Sile, what do you think? I wouldn't get married either. But then, who would have me? Where are you going? To town, to sell what's left of the quota. Is Mom home? She is... ...she's praying to the icons. But they don't listen. Come on, gee up! Hi Mom. Go to the store. I've just been there. We're out of lamp oil. Isn't Dad in town buying it? If we relied on that mean bastard... ...we'd die in the dark. God forgive me. Sile! Miss Marinela, it's easy. You attach a dynamo to the wheel... ...the dynamo has two wires... ...attach a light bulb and we'll have light in the village. Ulcior, four more all round!

We've served you for too long. Look Gogonea, you and your father. weren't even good at being servants. Good for nothings! Do you think gambling away your land... ...makes you an intellectual? I didn't go to school, and look what I've become! Well, I did go to school and look what you've become! Shut the fuck up. You don't know what you're talking about. I've been too good to you. What are you doing, you monkey? Scram! Whoever wants to join the Party can find me at the Town Hall. Right away! We're all coming! What's he saying? He'd like to join the party. But he'd rather join your mother! Well, I'll show you lot! Gogonica, come over here to your uncle, rascal. Auntie's not for you. Did you like the brandy? Shout "Daddy is the Russians' slave"... ...and I'll give you some more. Daddy is the Russians' slave! Louder! Daddy is the Russians' slave! That's my boy, get under the table. Where's the bar?
