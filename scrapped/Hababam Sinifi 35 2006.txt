 

                        My dear Students, esteemed Mr. Bedri. I never intended to end my career in this holy profession... ...which I committed 30 years, and this beautiful life... ...in such a pathetic way. The Class of Chaos has ruined me, Mr. Bedri. My dear wife, I rather die once... ...than thousand times each day. Forgive me, daughter. Forgive me, son. Farewell. Good bye life, hello universe. Kamil Canbolat. Class: Empty Subject; Origami You cut just like you speak, Lispy. I just want them to be right. Give me another one. This one's ready. Come on. Don't keep the customers waiting. - Alright. - Hurry on. I'm coming. Psycho. Be careful. Don't scare off the customers! Man. They make some serious fuss. Just a second. Stop shouting. There's enough for you all. Report, 20 Lira. Honors, 40. Don't forget to pay. Don't be so sad, Mr. Kamil. But how, Mrs. Nuriye? Just look at me. I shouldn't have ended up like this. They will all burn in hell. You shouldn't exchange the pills that a teacher would use for suicide. He's coming! Come on, exaggerate! I've had enough of you! What's going on?! It sounded as if there was a stampede here. Stampede?! Could be psychological. What did you say, Lispy? What psychology?! Herd psychology. - My sinusitis! That hurt. - Well, of course. I don't want to hear any bad jokes from you, Mean Kenan. Ouch! Mr. Bedri. You're cruel. Don't laugh! Cut the laughter! You rascals! What have you done to Mr. Kamil? He was about to commit suicide and we saved him. Shut up. - You're lying, you pimple! - My eye! I saw the poor man. You've turned him totally green. Well, yes. We have exchanged the pills. Otherwise we would be mourning after him now. Make fun about your own butt crack, you mad cow. That's your share, you bug! Give me some more! I like that! too expensive, Mr. Bedri? Buy some foggers. It's cheaper. Don't laugh! You bums! Uncle Bedri, can I have some as well? Here. Thanks. You're welcome, idiot! Spread them out. Get your parents to sign them and bring them back after the holiday. Tell you're parents my regards. They should kick your butt for me as well, while they're at it. He wasn't as angry as we expected. That's obvious. He has accepted defeat. Yes, folks! We have our reports... ...and can go now to our homes. - How are you, Mr. Kamil? - As you can see... "Green is my valley, blue were the pills." He's totally down. It's very natural! He looks like a grass head. Oh my God! They'll call me grass head. Oh no, I won't let them. I'll forbid that. The pigments are ruined. What did they give him? Oh my God! I could've been resting in peace now. Those who commit suicide won't find peace. Don't worry! This time I'll save you all. Are you going to dismiss them all? No! I'm afraid I can't do that. They have paid in total... ...260.000 YTL, those rascals. But if they should chose to leave, things would change quite a bit. I spoke to a lawyer. In that case they won't get a refund. They would never leave. They would've done it in the last century, if they wanted. They won't leave voluntarily of course They're not called Class of Chaos in vain. With a little push, we could change everything. Push? Yes, listen up! I have a great and cheap plan. If you all help me... ...we'll get rid of the Class of Chaos for good. Deal! The worst part of school are the holidays. Right! I don't want to go home at all. Besides, I have to stay with Crazy Bedri. And he saw my real report. He'll make me sleep in the balcony, that's for sure. Nonsense, what balcony? You can stay at our house. I got honors after all. Great, honors? Who gave it to you? We did, Baby! Here. What are you on? - Crazy Bedri comes in style! - What do you mean style? In summer style. He's going on vacation I assume. Idiots! Are you still here, canaries? We'll leave soon. We're saying good bye. Where are you off to? Don't you see, my dumb son? On vacation. Vacation? In the midst of winter. My stupid boy. Since you're ignorant, you wouldn't know that when we have winter here... ...it is summer in the southern hemisphere, fool. Where are you going to? Thailand. To be more accurate, to Pippi Island. Pippi Island? What could be famous there? What possibly could it be, Lispy? The sea, the beach and sun. Blow it! You too. I have to catch my plane. I'll give your present for your report as soon as I'm back. Hope so. - Farewell, losers. - Let me take it. Bye. Have a nice flight, Bedri! Have a nice vacation! Watch out for tsunamis! I almost forgot. You left your report papers in the class. In the trashcan. Yes, we didn't want to lose them. Don't worry. We'll take them. Don't trouble yourself. I sent all your reports to your parents via courier. Bye then. If I'm not mistaken we're all done for. But why? We could stay at school. That you won't! This is not a hotel! I mean in order to study, dad. We may improve our grades! Do it at home, dear. You can't stay at school. There will be renovations. The school will be painted, disinfected, washed and dried. I'll miss my flight! If I hear that you stay at school, I'll waste you. So, folks? Where shall we stay for 3 weeks? Wait till our tourist leaves, then I'll tell you the address. Are we going to Wee-Wee Island as well?! Just open the door! Take your shoes out! Who am I talking to? - Are those piglets gone? - Yes, sir. Pray for snow. Or else our plan goes down the drain. I'll sure pray! The adventure begins. - Little more left. - Yes, sir. No begging here. This is a school. Shame on you! It's you? You're great. Psycho. What are you doing!? You're piercing my dad. Stop that! Little more to the left. These are our new friends. Rezzan, zge and Tue. Perfect. Well, girls... Take your shoes out. I'm begging you! Take this too! What are you throwing at me? Do I look like a monkey to you? Next to the table. Mr. Bedri. Mrs. Sheyla is here. Welcome. Nice to meet you. Welcome. First I'd like to give you the money. Thanks. Can I have a wine glass? Wine glass! Right away. Here you are. - Thanks. - Not at all! Midget. Good evening, Midget. What are you doing here at this hour? - I came for the test. - Which test? Don't know. Mr. Bedri said we were to make a test. A test at this unholy hour. Test. Now I got it. Why don't I get it? You'll get it soon enough. - Jesus! What was that?! - An owl. Oh my God! Jesus! Run! Run! Oh my God! What's going on?! Good God! Yusuf! You're going to die, Yusuf! Mr. Bedri?! What Bedri?! I'm telling you, you're going to die! A mortal should be somewhat scared. Mortal?! My God! Help! Help! Help! Mr. Kamil? Run away, sharks! What!? Sharks?! Oh no! Shoo! Noo! Take me with you! Help! Police! Coast Guard! Help! Hello, Mr. Yusuf! Mr. Yusuf? Mr. Yusuf. That's it! That's my system! Mr. Bedri. Mr. Yusuf won't wake up! Slap him in the face. That will wake him up. Come in! - How was I, Mr. Bedri? - Outstanding! Really? Did you like my acting? More than that. You were great. You should attend a drama school. At this age? Education has nothing to do with age. You're talented. Arda, I'll kick you in the face... ...and your eyelashes will fall out! The Lord is our shepherd! Mr. Yusuf, no! It's me, Niyazi. Don't hit. Oh no! What is Mr. Yusuf doing?! Exorcism of course! May God help him. Don't hit! Who's she?! Who? Your stepmother, Ercment! Your stepmother! Stepmother? Her feet are backwards! Yes, Ercment! Very nice and decorative, right? Mama! Yes, son? Kiss your mother's hand! Her hands are backwards too. No! No! No! Oh my God! What's going on here? What's with this wedding? Good God! You're going to call me mother. You'll say mummy to me! Who are you? Am I drunk or what? Help me, God! - The garden is full with cement! - So? Idiot Ercment! What's happening to me? What did I possibly take? Come to your senses. Ercment. What's up, brother? Who are you? Don't you know me? It's me. Your brother. Why can't I see your reflection? So what? What do you mean "so what"? I'm not to be seen in photos either. Good God. What's going on here? Who are you? What do you want? I told you. I'm your brother. Your stepbrother. My...? Brother. My dear brother. Dad! Dad! Dad, what's going on here? Thank God, it was just a dream! These dreams should come to an end one day... Scumbags! Psycho? Sebastian? Where are you? Help! Who left the house like this? Buggers! At ease! Hi girls! Welcome to our school! Thanks. They are cute. - Have we met before? - I don't think so. Since we're at it we could meet now. Why not? I'm Alara. I'm Ruhi. - Emre. - How do you do? I'm Dilara. Kenan, nice to meet you. I'm Itir. Oh my! I'll nibble you off, Itir. This is Sumo. He's trying to say "nice to meet you." Would you allow me to make an announcement to our friends? Well of course. Here. My esteemed colleagues! Dear students! I have some joyful news for you! I... I mean "we". I have... We have... We have met in Thailand... ...and decided to get married. This is awesome! That's great news! Friends! I'd like to introduce you to my... ...new wife. We got married on the plane. Bedriye, this is the school I told you about. - Good morning, kids! - Thank you! Thank you. I'm outmost pleased to know you. Thank you! - Did you marry on the plane?! - Yes! At 12.000 feet. That's wonderful. May I? - Well, of course. - Thank you. What's going on here? That's enough. Thank you very much. Oh no, that woman...?! I'd like to introduce Feza to you. Feza, School. School, Feza! - Hello, friends. - Thank you. He's my stepson. I couldn't love him more than this even if he were my real son. Rascal. I'm sure that you will all love him. He fainted. Poor guy, he's jealous! Leave him. He's nobody. Don't talk nonsense, Bedri! The boy suffers a trauma! But honey. He's not a real person. He is Ercment. My son. Does anybody have eau de cologne?! I have! There's no need to panic. I know it. Ercment! Wake up, son! Jeez. Do you see that, a mother's heart. - Bravo. She's very caring. - It' a miracle. Eau de cologne, right? A great discovery. Always the same jokes. Ercment, wake up, son. Come to yourself. Over here. Slowly. We're lucky, guys. God sent us a matron just the way we like. She has suppressed Bedri immediately. Bravo. A real psychopath. Hell no! She looks very maternal. She has treated even Ercment like a human. She took care of him as if he was her own son. She has struggled. That's right. I thought she'd breastfeed him. Shut up! Take it back! What breastfeeding?! Are you awake, jealous Ercment?! What jealousy? You don't know anything. I saw that woman last night in my dream. Really? What was she doing? She was marrying Dad. The classic "Idiots can foresee" situation? Don't talk nonsense. Come closer. Last night in my dream... ...her head turned around like a dove. Afterwards her hands and feet were totally backwards. It was strange. I swear. He's gone nuts. Stepmother syndrome. What syndrome, man? I swear, she's a demon. I swear! Yeah right. If the mother is a demon, what is the son? Maybe lemon. Oh, no. He's a devil! Yesterday I couldn't see his reflection in the mirror. One of his eyes was yellow and the other red. OK, Ercment. We'll give him a blue lens for his red eye. You guys are careless! I'm freaking out and you make fun. We're in danger. Why don't you see that, idiots? We're here! There he is. Don't look him in the eye. Don't let him sense it. This is the dormitory. And these are the dormants. There! Look at his eyes! Hi, folks. Hi, dude. Welcome. Come here. Hello, mate. Welcome. Thanks. Ercment. How are you bro? What's the 'bro' talk? Let me see your eyes! You wiseacre. You have contact lenses, don't you? What lenses? Never mind. It's hard to explain, much harder to understand. Do you smoke? - Great. Thanks. - You're welcome. Here! So, you're Ercment's new brother? Yes, so it is. Demons don't make brothers! Enough, take out the lenses! Who are you trying to scare off? What do you mean? What's wrong with him? Don't mind him. It's the first time that he has a stepbrother and it's hard for him. Too bad. Don't be so sad. I'm in the same situation. That's life. You'll get used to it with time. Don't touch me! 'With time', huh? You are a smart one. Ercment, what are you doing, are you insane? Why insane?! Don't you believe me? - Lispy! Get me a mirror. - What mirror? I see. I better take my stuff out. Did you see that? He beat off when I said mirror. You foxy crab! Shame on you! You've treated him like an ox. Man, Drill. Try to understand. Shut up! Don't be so fussy! You're jealous! Alright, you'll see it yourself. But it will be too late. Shut the hell up! Bravo, Beberuhi. You stood up good against him. Shut your piehole! Did I ask you? How was it? I was very convincing, right Psycho? Pretty much! Congrats. That hurt. Kenan! Kenan! I beg you, wake up. Kenan, wake up. What are you doing, you moron?! Don't shout! You'll wake up the demon! Listen to me, Kenan. Organize all our friends. We have to meet. I'm freaking out. You have to organize them! Organize them! Meeting?! That's not a good way to wake someone up. - Psycho?! - Yes? Get up, we have to go to the loo. Why's that? He's lost it again and he wants us to meet. - Who? - Erc. - With whom? - With us. Fine. Then go. No. You have to come as well. Get up! Unbelievable. Come on, guys. Don't touch the light. Come over here. Dreadful things will happen in our school. You are the only dreadful thing in this school. Are you aware of it? I am. Yeah, right. What is that stone for? Self-defense, you idiot! You should get one as well. You all should! Alright. Fine! What? Are you all psychopaths? What are we talking about in the middle of the night? Have you gone completely insane?! Did you wake us for that? Beberuhi, turn on the lights. Don't touch it! This is a secret meeting! Don't laugh, you fools! Do you want your head split open with a hammer? He thinks he has a hammer in his hand. Idiot! I'm talking about the hammer of that guy. Such a big thing. What do you want from him? Do you like what you're doing? I don't want anything from him. There he is! Look! What's going on here?! Who put this in my bed?! You don't make such jokes on the very first day! I didn't do it. Is that some kind of a joke? Shame on you. I'm out of words, Ercment. That's not good at all. - Friends, I... - I'm protesting you. - Me too. - But, I... Me as well. Think about it. Emre. Psycho? Kenan? Don't be so prejudiced. Idiot. He's at the brink of suicide. I feel sorry for him. Trust me, he doesn't deserve pity. I'm in this school since years. Never have I seen such days. - Are you ready? - Yes. Not you, Mercan Dede! - I said I'm ready, man! - Bravo! Wait for my signal. That bastard has turned them all on his side. Ercment! Huh?! What?! Don't be scared, Ercment! I will help you! Help? Sebastian? Is that you?! Who the hell is Sebastian?! Who are you? Show yourself, who ever you are! Do you see this stone here? I'll smash your liver. Show yourself! What's going on here?! - What's this about? - You little sprout! You're going too far! We're five guys here! Enough! Don't give me this transparency crap! Search and find me, Ercment. Search and find me! Why should I? Who are you?! I'm Mercan Dede! Mercan Dede? Yes, Mercan Dede. But my friends call me Holy Moly. Holy Moly?! Yes. Cut it out. Find me, Ercment! Or else you're done for, Ercment! Good heavens, what's going on, holy men and such? Our father, who art in heaven... The food is great. Many thanks. Bon appetite. Thank you. Thanks. I don't believe it. I'm totally confused, mates. Yes. Are we in heaven? I'm since 16 years at school. I've never seen such food. And I'm here since 11 years and I didn't either. She sure knows about education. That's for sure. Which school has a Japanese cook? All the schools in Japan for example. Bravo, Mrs. Bedriye. She's a reformist. I appreciate that. You still don't get it, do you? That witch tries to win your heart. Erc, shut up. That's enough. Emre, you fall for it. Erc, take some Omega 3. May God give you wits. What is that!? My dear Bedriye is coming! - Bon appetite, kids! - Thank you. Hello, Mother Bedriye! Oh, my children. Did you like the new cook? We're like in heaven. Many thanks. For a good education... ...you need good nourishment, right? Sure. I won't work out without Shu... suchi... sushi. Bon appetite then. - Bye! - Bye! Such a nice woman. Hell no. She'll trick out all of us. Cut it out! I'll push these sticks into your ear! Guess which test I stole? Chemistry! Excuse me. I'll undertake an operation. Well, of course. Take out those cheat slips! I won't repeat! What are cheat slips? Don't play the fool, you tomcat! I know that you stole the test. Ercment?! Take out the cheat slips! Which slips?! Which? These, you dove! Are those rascals cheating? You'll get all F! Don't laugh! Didn't I forbid cheating at school? What's going on here?! I caught that teddy bear during cheating. So what? Leave him alone. What?! All students cheat. That's pretty normal. Besides, I'm sure he's learnt a couple of things doing it. - Don't worry. - But honey... - Sit down. - Yes, mother. Take your notes back. You can open your books. But how's that? Just like this. That's the way it is done in European countries. Is cheating free? You can call it system change. What ever. Have a good exam. Come, Bedri. Yes, hon. I'm coming, sweetheart The answer of the third question is on page 27. The books were open. The highest grade is DD. Excuse me? The books were open. The highest grade is DD. Whose grades? Forget it. Mrs. Sheyla. Yes? Congratulations. I almost got fooled by the cheating trick. Thank you. I don't feel so well about this. They all look like nice fellows. I don't know if this is right. You can be sure that this is right. You haven't yet seen their true character. Really? Snow! Snow! I'll go right away, Mr. Bedri! Why 'go'? There's going to be snowfall. What's going on?! It's going to snow! The snowstorm could affect the daily life... ...in the morning hours. The authorities have warned the drivers against ice. Dear Lord, you have created the earth, the skies and me like this. As your believers we don't ask from you... ...money, fame, name or shame. Please grant us a little bit of snow. Amen. Please grant us some snowballs! - Thank you in advance. - Amen! There won't be any snow these days. Don't be so sure. He has a good heart. There could be snow after all. Yeah, right! Let's sleep now. Ercment. Sleep tight, brother. - Excuse me? - I said 'Sleep tight.' Thanks, brother. You too. Holy smoke! What? Snow, Ercment! There's snowfall outside! - Really? - I swear. Great! You scared me. Ruhi! My baby! My hero. Your prayers have been answered. Please spare me, Ercment! What, you loony? Get up! There's snow outside, you ox! What's going on? It's like the school has been hit by an avalanche. Snow! Nice chick. We should give her a name. How's Spike? Please. Yeah, sure. Lassie would be better. No way, that's a dog name. Hold on. I got it: Alara How's Dilara? That's great. Just a minute. I suggest Itir. Alara. Alara. I insist on Spike. What are you doing in my schoolyard, you perverts? Take off that bikini! Come on! He calls us perverts and wants us to take off the bikini. You lousy son! You won't ever claim that I didn't play snowball with you. They couldn't get home since the roads are closed by snow. Therefore they'll stay with you during the snow holidays. It will do them good! Idiot. Feza, son! Come and stay at home. You can watch plasma-TV. Or else these bandits will tear you apart. Thanks, Uncle Bedri but no. I want to stay here with my friends and my brother. Do you see that? They have transformed him in 2 days. Shame on you! Habits die hard. Anyway. Don't forget. I'll keep my eye on you. And I'll stay here for a while. Please, not in the face. Attention, attention! Guest rooms have been prepared on the second floor... ...for our female students! Girls! That's your room. You can put your stuff into the lockers. Thank you! Don't make noise. We won't. I want to see too. Step aside. We want to see the chicks too! What are you doing? On the very first day! You crooks! I swear I couldn't see a thing, Dad. From now on you won't be able to see anything. I knew that you'd pay a visit to the girls. Therefore I've let them prepare Mrs. Nuriye's room here. What's gotten into her? She's become Sex and the City. Mrs. Nuriye! From now on I'm entrusting the girls to you. These sex maniacs shouldn't make it even to their door. Don't worry. I'll sacrifice my body if necessary. Holy cow. How was that? Sextant... and? Oh no. Japanese food again? You should be grateful... ...for Japanese food, ruffian. I think he's angry! I'm not angry! Don't worry. The Japanese talk as if they're angry. That's for sure. You think he's cursing at you... ...but that fool is actually reciting a poem. Shut up, you dumb cluck. Go and call your father a fool What did he say now? Bon appetite or something like that. The girls are looking at us. Feza. I like that Alara pretty much. Really? Me too. Cut the crap, she's mine. Really? Mine as well. Get lost. I hope the food gets stuck up your throat! Atatrk? No, it's me. Mercan Dede. Mercan Dede? We met in the toilette, you moron. Did you forget? What do you want from me, dude? You're in danger, Ercment. Listen up, you don't exist. Don't talk to me. I'm extremely dangerous. Papa, was that you? What are you doing here, my sick son? I wanted to ask you something. So? Come on, ask. Do you know a certain Mercan Dede? How did you find out about Mercan Dede? He's talking to me. The boy is right. I'm talking to him! There, he talked again. Did you hear that? Nonsense. That dude passed away 100 years ago. Is that a crime? Don't you really hear that schmuck? No. Only you can hear me. And you're the schmuck. Cut it out! We'll be ruined if anyone hears that there's a tomb in the school. The parents would take away their kids. If that happens I would be forced to donate you to Greenpeace. And what about that voice? Come on. Don't cry. Go and wash your face. Now go. Whom does he resemble? Cloned sheep. Was that an owl?! Perhaps. It could also be a she-owl. Don't laugh. It invites trouble. So we won't laugh. Please. You've laughed a lot. I'm sure something will come up. You're not going to set the dog loose in the yard? Don't worry, I won't do it, Midget will. Midget! Mr. Bedri? You can set Django loose. Of course. With pleasure. What kind of a knot is that? Mrs. Sheyla! Please, would you do me a favor? I want you to record these moments. Would you do that for me? Of course. The tape is inside. You just have to press "Rec". For howls press this button. Use it as much as you can, we want to scare them to death. How do I look? Great. I'll scare them away in an instant. Jesus, there are wolves at school. Relax. It's possibly only a werewolf. Don't bray! Behave yourself. Otherwise we'll get caught. Silence. I see the chick's shadow. - Good evening. - What are you doing? The girls. We wanted to come over for a visit. How clumsy of us. We chose the wrong thingy. What a pity. You should've chosen the right thingy. In that case this window...? What are you doing here? Beat it! No! Man, what kind of a knot is that? Mrs. Sheyla, are you taping it? Yes. I want to show it to my grandchildren... Run! Where are they? Wait. Stop. Girls! Don't laugh! Get inside! Your own dog didn't recognize you. Someone has to keep Nuriye busy. Otherwise we'll never get close to the girls. Why me? It's obvious. You're the most handsome among us. No way. I'll never go to that woman. Who'll go? Don't look at me. Get in there. No way. I rather die. I don't care if you die or not. I'll ask for the last time. Who'll go in there? No way. Forget the girls then. Give me that. It shouldn't be that tough. Do you see that? You're so self-sacrificing. What the heck? You're new around here. I'll go. Why do you look like that? He couldn't spare his stepbrother. Hurry up. What's wrong with these doors? Who can it be now? Who can it be now knocking at my door? It's me. Ercment. Come in. The door is open. Are you available? More than available. Where are you? I can't see you. Where are you, Mrs. Nuriye? Here. Mummy! They say that my mother's name is Bedriye. I don't know my mother. Who was she? Are you available? I wanted to ask what notes are. - Is the rose for me? - Yes. Thank you, sugar. Bon appetite. Come in. Hello. May I come in? Sure. Hi! - Hello! - Aloha. It's us! We thought you might get bored. Yes, we're bored to death. How about some entertainment? Scrabble! - I love it. - I love it more. Let's play! Bravo, Feza. You sure know about girls. Come on. Where are you going, girls? To the canteen. Do you want anything? Yes, we want you back quick. He's right. Come back quick. There's full moon tonight. Could be dangerous for you. You're lucky. There weren't such idiots around in my days. We'll pee in our pants from laughing. Of course you have to take care of some details. Like what? For example, this is yours. Are we going to scare them with this wig? That's not a wig, that's a mask. We'll scare them with these masks. What, you idiot? What are you doing, you fool? Pee. You can open up to me. We're both adults. I want to become a singer when I grow up. That's why I came. Singer? I'm very fond of classical Turkish pop music. I came to be inspired by you. Inspired? Pike off, Ercment. - She's got bad intentions. - What? Do you know how to play the guitar? - Guitar? - Beat it, don't just stand there. Good that you reminded me. I should go and learn how to play the guitar. Are you going to the music chamber? Yes, I'm highly motivated. Thank you so much. Hold on. You can't learn on your own. Come on, play faster. What's that? Bloodsu...? Bloodsugar. Bloodsugar is not one word. Why not? Then we'll write mymilk. - What's mymilk? - My milk. for us, Feza. - 14. - Did you write it? Is it our turn? Feza, 18 points. What, 18? What's the word? Alwaysloyal I'm always loyal too. Kenan. Take this, I'll take a look at Ercment. Oh, Ercment. I wonder how he's doing? Poor guy. He's probably scared to death right now. That guy is hilarious! Should we turn off the lights? With pleasure. Stop! Let's watch that idiot for a while. What do you need to play the guitar? A guitar? Bravo. Which guitars are better? Those with chords? No, you idiot. The heavy ones! Heavy? Yes. This for example is a good one. What are you doing? I'm getting scared. Relax. I'll teach you how to play the guitar in such a way... ...that you'll never forget it. Whose turn is it? Don't cheat. Our word is bite! Bite?! 'Bite' as we know it? You wouldn't know this bite. Write down. 30 Points! These girls are just made for us. You begin to understand. Oh no! Powder cut. It's seems to me that Feza has found Ercment. Yes. Does anyone have a candle? I have this here. Can we light it? Which room's key is that? The dining hall. There should be a gas lamp. Dining hall?! Cool! Let's go and find a gas lamp. Come on. I'd like to walk around as well. I love to walk in the dark. I would go with you down the deepest and darkest caves. - Just ask for it. - What if I ask? Cool! Let's go. Don't cry and watch me, moron! I beg you. You take the guitar. And then smash it on the head of the victim. Don't run! I'll show you how to blow the saxophone. Help! Anyone! Where are you going, homey?! Feza! Run, bro! That Nuriye has lost it. What's that? This here? A murder weapon. Great. Feza, why do you laugh like that?! Don't call me brother, you rhino! - Why? - I hate you all! But why? I hate all stepbrothers! Feza. Please, stop it. Those were the last words of them all! Which flour dish do you like the most? Manti. What a coincidence. Me too. - How do you like meat? - Bloody. Are you serious? Me too. We have so much in common, right? I like it when there's only blood. - What do you mean "only blood"? - Luke warm. You seem to have a vampire part in you. Vampire! He's out of battery. Idiot! You won't catch me. Help! Help! Oh God! What's this?! Oh God. A ghost. Come in. We're ready, Mr. Bedri. - Let me see. - Of course. - How do I look? - Great, you look fantastic. You have a very long life line. It's hereditary. My grandpa lived 250 years. What?! Let's see whose hands are bigger. Lispy. My hand got sweaty. So what, my whole arm is soaked from sweat. You can kiss if you want. Who? Me? Oh God. Of course I want it. You can kiss too, it will feel swell. Yeah? Many thanks! It already feels swollen. Take a look at that wrist. Since we've started, I should put on something comfortable. Of course. Wait a little. I'll be back. Man, she's so horny. Well, we made her blood boil with our kisses. And I will make your blood boil. - Deal! - I'm first! I'm first. I'll strangle you! Alright, we both are first. This power cut will make everything easier. He'll freak out. Just wait. We'll see. I'm ready. Kenan. What's going on? Dude. That girl. Vampire. She's a vampire. It's us. This is my favourite place at school. Really? Since when? Since 1860. There are so many books here! You can take some if you're interested. Yes, you can take them. They aren't ours anyway. Cool. Ruhi! Let's cut a deal. Alright. You'll go and look for a gas lamp now. And in return, I'll leave you alone with her. OK? Deal! Listen, you'll keep your promise, right? Of course. I'm not a trickster. Well, I'll go and look for a gas lamp! Thank you, Drill. I won't forget this favour. Me neither. - What would you like to drink?! - Do you have something red? Sure! Alara. I want to ask something. What's your sign? Cancer. I love cancers. What's your blood group? O RH positive. Really? My favorite. Really? Why? Kenan! Psycho! Ruhi! Mrs. Nuriye?! Chill. I'll blow you saxophone. Help! Run. Shark! Mr. Carp! A shark is closing in. Run away! Shark? Really? Where? There. How sweet. He must have lost his way. What are you doing? You should be scared! Run! But why? They don't do anything when you squat down. Didn't I tell you? It looks so cute. Well, did you like Ruhi? Don't leave, come here! Shoo! Eat your head off! Another one?! Why aren't you scared? Why should I? I'm squatting down. Get lost! Strange. That boy is an imbecile. Get lost. There's someone in the teachers' room. He'll leave soon. You are smart, aren't you? Damn it. You scared me out of my wits. I'm tense all over. That chick turned into a vampire. She transformed into a German shepherd dog. Mine as well. And there are two monsters outside. What?! Monsters? They are no monsters. They are Frankenstein and Zombie. Frankenstein and Zombie? What's going on in this school? I saw Nuriye. She was running around with Saxophone. What do you mean? Monster! It's us. What monster? May God smite you. Why do you run around like this? Are you insane, Psycho? You won't believe me... ...but Freak turned into a Werewolf. - What? - You're lying. Why should I? I'm going to tell you something incredible. We know. She turned into a vampire. Yes. I knocked out a ghost in the yard. This is the last straw. Let's get the hell out of here. But where? The place is loaded with vampires. Could be. We have vampires outside... ...and here we have a table. What are you doing, Psycho? Did you never watch a vampire movie? Take one. Please try to understand. This is not personal. My mother married seven times. I've treated my other 13 stepbrothers like this as well. Some died with my saw and the others were stabbed by me. Are you scared, knucklehead? It's very sad to die like this, huh? There's nothing I can do. It's all your fault. If you had graduated we wouldn't have met at all. Am I right? Isn't it your fault? Why do you grunt like a Tasmanian Devil? I don't understand a thing. I'll open your mouth know... What did you say? I swear I'll study hard. It's too late, Erc. Idiot. Do you think you can run away like this? - Please, spare me! - Don't worry, we're friendly! What's with those clubs? The school is full with vampires. Vampires?! - And ghosts! - Also werewolves! What should we do? Don't worry. We have enough stakes for vampires. What did I tell you? What is this thing? I think my guts exploded! Please, Freak. Don't eat us. Don't be scared. He doesn't do anything when you squat down. Don't look at me. Help. Ercment, what happened?! He's possessed! Come. You're exaggerating. Oh my God! This seems to be permanent! What should we do? He's possessed by demons. Who has obsessed you?! Erc... Erc. Relax! We'll find an exorcist for you tomorrow. We should find Mr. Niyazi. Maybe he could fix him. What? Did you eat your tongue?! Who is that? Well, of course you'll babble like that. I told you to find me! Why didn't you find me, idiot? I'm scared, Psycho. Don't be afraid, Sebo. I'm with you. Don't get excited, folks. Excuse me. Who am I talking to? I'm Mercan Dede. My friends call me Holy Moly. Just what we needed, a holy man. I came all the way from the other side to save you. Why is that? I was once a student as well. Besides, I was at this school, in your class. I call that luck. I guess we're saved. You'll help us, won't you Mercan Dede? Of course. You must follow the procedures. Everything has a thing. Everything has what? You have to conjure spirits. But first comes a ritual ablution. We'll do that. We'll meet in the attic in 10 minutes. OK? Bye! Hurry up. Let's not keep the customers waiting. Oh spirit! Oh spirit! Mercan Dede's spirit! Give us a sign when you're here. You said 10 minutes but are still not around. It won't work out like this. We have to find another way. I have an idea. He won't make it. Mercan Dede's spirit won't make it. What the hell? That spirit could smite us! What was that? Give it a try. Oh spirit. People, there are vampires in the school! We know, that's why we're conjuring a spirit. You're conjuring spirits? He said we should come here but he's nowhere to be seen. You can't conjure like that. What's the right way? With a coffee cup. Lunatic. He carries a coffee cup. That's my lucky cup. My grandma was a psychic. I always carry it with me. Looks like you know such things. Respect. Psychic. We'll start with the prayer. Put your fingers on top. I'm starting. - I'm scared. - Me too. Don't make me laugh or we'll get smitten. Whose spirit do you want to conjure? - Linda Lovelace! - Marilyn Monroe! - Jeniffer Lopez! - She's not dead yet. Nostradamus? Cut the crap! Call Mercan Dede. Fine. Put your fingers on top. Oh Mercan Dede's spirit! Mercan, we're calling for you. Tell us when you're here! Mercan. Mercan! Mercan, I'm calling you. Tell us when you're here! What's going on? Does that mean he's here? Look. Something is happening to it. Run! Help! They're freaking out. Looks like he's dead. Shall we run away? What should we do? Wait! He's moving! Did you wait a lot, morons? Oh no! He's inside him! Well, I'm definitely not in his pocket. That's how things work out. Help! He's taking over my skin. Stop complaining! This is my body, Mercan Dede. My body. Don't get me started with your body. Beat it. You're so mean, Mercan Dede! Of course, I'll let him know. Great. Finally I found myself a new body. Is everything fine now? Can we now solve our problem? That we can't. I don't need you anymore. Quasimodo! Oh God! Come on. Close the door, quick. Mummy! Vampires! Vampires! Ghosts! Werewolf! The reaper! She reaper! So? The hell is loose. Unbelievable. The school is full with creatures. It's like at a rock concert. But no! You're sinning. That's not a good joke at all. But it's not a joke. I think he's possessed by a demon. Or a ghost. Stop the nonsense. You are somewhat educated after all. Ghosts, vampires, zombies. They were invented by adults to scare children. Don't be so superstitious. Yeah. Why are we scared? Everything has a logical explanation. You're right. Thank you. You've brought us to our senses. Don't lose it again. First rule of belief, the oath. Second: Fasting. Three: Pilgrimage. Four: To give alms. Five: Daily prayer. He is insane! Your vampires are good belly dancers. Brother Necmi. You lowlife! Why didn't you warn the boys? I wanted to have some fun before telling them. But your boys scrammed instantly. Don't laugh. It's very natural. You should see them. Do you call this a joke? Tell your mad boss, he'll pay for it. Understand? Take care. Bye, Brother Necmi. I guess this time we've crossed the line. Midget. Who was that? Who? That man. Him? Gdk Necmi... Who's that? A former student of the Class of Chaos. Former? Yes. Thanks. First I would like to thank Mrs. Sheyla, one of the... ...precious actors from the Tokat State-theater... ...for helping me carry out my plan. And... My thanks go to the young yet talented... ...students from the drama school, Arda and Freak. And now the big moment. The first show in our school history... ...without the Class of Chaos. It all seems like a joke, right? It's a joke but real. I lack the words to describe my happiness. Enough said, I bring you the show. The show begins. Stop! Stop! The Class of Chaos! Cut it out! Listen, you troll. Give that to me. Don't touch my baton. I'm leading an orchestra here. Go and sing somewhere else. This is private property. You can't sing here. Give me that! Crazy Bedri. Stop it! There's no show without us. Let them at least finish their song. As if I care! What did I tell you?! They're now gone. They are no longer students of this school. Only our students can sing here. Give me that. What have you done? That was Richard Hayman's baton. I'll buy him a new one. Stop the song. Now shoo, you crows. We're not leaving! What are you going to do?! That's it! Security! I'm coming! Yes, sir. Take these occupiers down from the stage. Use force if necessary. You, turn of the light. You're being inhumane! Let the boys finish their song. Throw him out. Quick. Out. But Bedri... Are you still waiting? I'll throw them out myself if necessary. I'm sorry, Necmi. Orders. Cut the talk. Throw him out! Come on! Out! Hurry! Come on! That's it! Don't touch Mr. Necmi, Dad! Are you nuts? Do you know what you're saying? I can touch anybody I feel like! Dad! Don't touch Mr. Necmi! I said don't touch him. Shame on you! How dare you talk to your father like that? Don't come in between father and son. I told you not to touch Mr. Necmi. Ercment! What's gotten into you? Let go of the gun, Midget! It's registered on my name. I said let go. I'm saying the same! OK, I'm letting go! What have you done? You've killed him! Oh God! I've become a killer. Remain calm. Drop the weapon. I've killed someone. You're very clumsy, Ercment. What have I done? I've killed again. I beg you, please don't shoot anyone else. Otherwise the school will get a bad name. I've turned into a killer at this age. I'll rot in jail. Don't worry. I'll hire the best lawyers. Just drop the gun. I'll get at least 40 years, right Dad? So what? They grant amnesty every ten years. No! I'm too young, Dad! Son! It's all your fault, you stepdog. You got me all wrong. Shut up! I'll end up in jail anyway... ...it won't matter if I kill you as well. Ercment... Please, I beg you. Beg the demons in hell, you dog. What have you done?! Erc. What are you doing, you fool? I guess I'm in a murder frenzy, Mean Kenan. I can shoot me in the head while I'm at it. Ercment, don't! I beg you! No, Dad! There's no point in living anymore. I've killed 3 men in 2 minutes. My life's over. We'll send you to an institution. You'll get better. Please, don't kill yourself. Don't let your father suffer this pain. - I'll do whatever you want! - Whatever? Yes. Just drop the gun, Ercment! Would you take my friends back to the school? Yes, right away. How about 50 o/o discount with the tuitions? That's OK. Let's make it 60 o/o. We want an Italian cook. That Japanese cook is getting on our nerves. Alright, deal. You scoundrels. Was it all a game?! Would it have been better, if I really were in a frenzy? E tu, Brutus? I thought you were on my side. I'm sorry, Uncle Bedri. I've become a member of the Class of Chaos as well. You rascals! You almost gave me a heart attack. Now we're even. That should be a lesson for you. Don't forget! If you sow wind, you'll gather storm. I won't forget that. Let me kiss your hand. Don't forget your promise! I won't! Class of Chaos! You can return to the school next year. And if I don't employ an Italian cook... ...don't call me Bedri anymore. Just a second! I can't give you 60 % discount. You know, I'm very tight fisted.
