Gosh, you've grown! -How's your dad?. -Fine. -Your ma?. -Fine. I was afraid I wouldn't find you. Ma said I should wait... by the boat. In Shanghai you have to watch out. Get in the truck. FI RST DAY Shuisheng! Stay in the truck! Mr. Song. Now pay attention. In Shanghai... you have to learn what to do. Listen carefully. Do everything I say. -Got it?. -Got it. All outsiders get searched here. This is Shuisheng. He's from the country. This is where the Boss lives. You're so dirty, we'll go in the back way. I'll show you around the house later. All the kids in our family... want to come here to get rich... but you're the only one I recommended. Don't let me down! It's good to be rich. Rich?. You know what "rich" means?. Any place in Shanghai... if the Boss wants it... he gets it. The money that goes through the Tang family's hands-- Unbelievable! I'd start up a small shop. You really are a bumpkin! You know why you are here?. Because your name is Tang. The boss trusts nobody... except members of our family. Scrub yourself all over. You'll be serving a young lady. She's the Boss's mistress. He's made her the queen of Shanghai. I don't know what he sees in her myself. Her name is Bijou. Her sign is the Snake. The boss told me that. You'll have to work hard. Got it?. Got it. Eat up! You've never seen this?. It's called ice cream. This is the Boss's club. It's the hot spot. Look, that's Bijou! Pretending, youre pretending Don't bother pretending Look You can't wait to look at me Don't be shy, take a good look Don't look so serious Don't look so distant Don't look so serious Don't look so distant Serious, shy, it's all an act Your eyes have already been all over me From head to toe, all over me You've secretly looked all over me Embarrassed, embarrassed Why be embarrassed You think you love me You want to love me What a tram p! The Boss sent his wife away because of her. Who would dare to go near her?. Now she's with the Boss, she doesn't smile at anyone. She really thinks she's the queen of the stage! If the Boss dropped her... she'd be out on the streets. What a slut! On my body I can feel your eyes Roving up, roving down On my body I can feel your eyes Shuisheng! Let's go. Got that?. You must call her " Miss." From now on you're her servant. Miss... Say " Miss." Miss. Come here. Turn around. Pretty hips! No wonder the clients are all over you. Did that old man feel you up without paying?. So you hid it! Stuff it inside you, I'd still find it. You know the rule. Your ass is your own... but if you get fondled in here... the money is for me. That's the rule. Miss... All right. Since it's the first time... I'll give you the money back. Thank you, Miss. But I hate to break the rules... so no wages. That will teach you. Get lost! So this time I get a little rooster! Come here. How old are you?. Fourteen. Fourteen?. Have you slept with a girl yet?. Miss... Yes, I have. You have?. Who with?. My ma, when I was small. Your ma when you were small! What's your name?. Shuisheng. Your last name?. Let him answer! Tang. My last name is Tang. Tang?. So youre a Tang. Shuisheng, give me a light. It's a cigarette lighter. Smart kid. He learns fast. What's the matter with you?. It's not hard. Blockhead! Forgive him, Miss. My apologies. Forget it. Apologies from a Tang?. That's new. The Boss is waiting. Shuisheng! Follow Miss. The Boss is already here, Miss. He's upstairs with Mr. Song and Mr. Zheng. You must take her coat. Don't step on it! Mustn't get it dirty. Take her hat too. Right hand is for the coat. Left hand is for the hat. That's the rule. Remember the way. Whenever Miss comes here... you must serve her well. Walk behind her. Not too near, not too far. Don't ever walk ahead of her. Walk silently, but let her know youre there. Serve her well, you'll make a good living. Got it?. Got it. Shall I tell the Boss you're here, Miss?. When she goes into her bedroom... you must stand here by the door. See those chairs?. Don't sit on them. They're not for you. You must stay standing up. Don't doze off!. If the Boss or Miss wants some food or drinks... hurry out there and tell them. Everything is there. If they ask for something... bring it at once. Got it?. Got it. Put it on the sofa. Stand there and let me see. This way a little. Bow your head. Not bad. Don't forget... if you want to look at something... do it discreetly. Don't stare... or you'll end up looking like an idiot. Don't complain. In a few years, you'll be somebody in Shanghai! Being a Tang will change your life. Got it?. Got it. The Boss is in there. Take a good look. If he's talking business in that room... like now... don't go in. Wait out here. The Boss always says... "Women's business is nothing but wind. Men's business, however small, is important." He's the most powerful boss in Shanghai. Always remember, everyone who works here... is a Tang. If your name is Tang, the Boss will be good to you. See how lucky you are?. That's Mr. Song. You saw him before. The Boss thinks very highly of him. They call him the Boss's right-hand man. He's shrewd and sharp. Sharp as a knife! The other one, the fat man, is Mr. Zheng. He's the Boss's favorite. He's a tough man of action. He has a violent temper. When he gets mad, all of Shanghai behaves! Shanghai behaves! The old man is Mr. Tang. He's the Boss's cousin and private secretary. The Boss trusts him implicitly. He handles all the family business. All of it. Song, Zheng and I had equal rank in the family. Then a few years ago, there was a gang war at the docks. The Boss saved Song's and Zheng's lives. With secret rituals... they became blood brothers. You know what that means?. That's how the Boss controls his empire! Mr. Yu?. One moment, please. That's a telephone. It's a call for the Boss. When he's on the telephone, we move away... so as not to disturb him. Remember that! Mr. Yu! How are you?. Yes, it's been a while! I'm sorry I missed your son's birthday party. I had to go to Suzhou on business. Yes. Of course I'll see to it. Yes. Song! What's all this about?. Why did you fight with those punks?. What happened?. He broke his promises. He ignored the Boss's orders... so I killed him. Is that all it was?. Just one man killed?. We can pay to keep it quiet. Song did it to avenge your honor. When you wash your pants... you clean it up or it stinks. Deal with it. I'll go see Yu. Boss, are you serious?. Is it really that bad?. We can't let Fat Yu lose face. I should be the one to go. Take some men with you. Fat Yu has no balls. Go with the Boss and take some men. Boss... this is Shuisheng, Miss's new servant. He's the third nephew of a close cousin of yours. -Say "boss." -Boss. Boss! What are you doing here?. Don't you want me here?. How can you think that?. Let me see you. Like a real goddess! I don't see much of you. Don't worry, Treasure. I'll be right back. May I ask... Which bitch are you going to see now?. I'm going to see Fat Yu. Is that a new perfume?. All right, then take off your rings. Afraid I'll give them to another woman?. All right, I'll take them off. I would give them to no one but you. Here, Treasure. You can have them. Take them. You're all witnesses. I'm not after his money. I'm taking his rings to keep them safe. Do that. Keep them safe! Boss, the car is ready. See?. This is important. I'll be back soon. We mustn't let Fat Yu lose face. We can't do that to him! Kiss me. I'll be waiting! Can't you knock?. Bumpkin! Get out! Go out and knock! Who is it?. Me. Who is "me"?. Shuisheng. Knock again... and say "Shuisheng the bumpkin." Who is it?. Shuisheng the bumpkin. Say your first and last names. Knock again! Who is it?. Tang Shuisheng the bumpkin. Come in. Put it on the table. What are you staring at?. Who is it?. It's me, Miss. Liu. The Boss won't be coming home. He's playing mah-jongg with Fat Yu. He'll be busy for some days. So if you want to-- I'm going home. Bumpkin! I'll deal with you later. See this house?. The Boss gave it to Miss for her birthday. You're going to live here. Lucky boy! That's Shuisheng. He'll sleep in the room under the stairs. She can't speak. Guess who cut out her tongue. But she can hear. You sleep here. That's the bell. When it rings, it means Miss is calling for you. Remember that. When it rings... even if you're peeing, stop. Go to Miss at once and take her orders. When she speaks to you, bow your head. Pay attention. Keep your ears wide open. - Got it?. - I want to leave. Shuisheng! I want to leave! You didn't come here to do nothing! And who will pay for the mirror?. Now listen. For country folk like us, finding work in the city... isn't easy. I sweated blood to get where I am. I worked damn hard! Work well, or I'll send you back to the country. Got it?. Got it. If you ever say "no" again... I'll throw you in the river! Go to bed. Miss! I've taught him a lesson. Don't worry. I'm going home now. SECOND DAY Faraway the clouds are fading My lover appears in the moonlight Tonight we are happy together again On the crystal water swims a pair of ducks Green leaves, red petals The lotus flowers open A pair of ducks and you and I together The playful breeze caresses the flowers And our love lights up the world Far away the clouds are fading My lover appears in the moonlight Tonight we are happy Together again On the crystal water swims a pair of ducks Green leaves, red petals the lotus flowers open A pair of ducks And you and I together The playful breeze caresses the flowers And our love Lights up the world A pair of-- What is it?. The Boss hates " Moonlight." Everyone knows that... yet she sings it when he's here! Change the song! Play " Pretending." Get changed, quick! Miss! The Boss is here with Song and Zheng. They've come with Fat Yu to hear you sing. Please get changed quickly. Fat Yu?. That fat pig! Please hurry. Shuisheng, bring me the red dress. Hurry up! It's next to the green one. The red one! Don't you understand?. Have you ever seen blood?. Bumpkin! Can't you do anything right?. They've stuck me with a moron! A half-wit! Calm down, Miss. I'll help you. Buzz off. Pretending, youre pretending Don't bother pretending You can't wait to look at me Don't be shy, take a good look Don't bother pretending We have the same tastes! Mr. Yu, do you think she sings well?. She looks better than she sings! I love it when she sings this song. A lot of people sing it... but not as well as her. Listen. Listen carefully. It comes and goes... as softly as a goose's feather, right?. Yes, it's interesting. Isn't it! Embarrassed, embarrassed Why be embarrassed? You think you love me You want to love me So come right out and say it Don't look so serious Don't look so distant Don't look so serious Don't look so distant You're blushing Your heart is beating I can tell you're consumed by desire Roving up, roving down All over my body I feel your eyes Roving up, roving down All over my body I feel your eyes Get lost! Fuck off!. Don't ever come back! Didn't you ever care for me?. Bastard! Pig! Who do you think I am?. You treat me like a whore! You lousy bastard! Drop dead! Just because you fucked me, you think you're the boss?. Don't kid yourself!. Dont you know who the boss is in Shanghai?. I'm the boss now. Drop dead, bastard! Go fuck yourself!. Who do you think you are?. What are you?. A jerk! A fucking jerk! You want to play at being the boss?. THI RD DAY I beg you, go away Go quickly, far away Your heart, hard as rock Your heart has me under its spell I beg you, go away Go quickly Far away Your heart, hard as rock Your heart has me under its spell You have consumed my heart You have consumed my body Your heart, hard as rock You have no heart You have consumed my heart You have consumed my body Your heart, hard as a rock You have no heart SHANG HAI - PARI S SHANG HAI - U.S.A. It's a big party All the guests are here Men and women, happy together You're too good at mah-jongg, Mr. Yu! You're too modest. Tell Miss I'm going to Mr. Yu's for mah-jongg. I'll be back late. Tell her to wait at home. Yes, tell her to wait! After you. Uncle Liu! Uncle Liu! Here's the Boss. Boss... his eyes are still open. Let him go. Fat Yu's gang did it. Your uncle died protecting me. Take a good look. His open eyes cry out for vengeance. Get up! Get up! It's so early! Where are we going?. I've nothing with me! Shuisheng, get in! Hurry! Get going! FOURTH DAY This is boring me to death. Why leave home so early just to sit around in a dirty boat?. Not even allowed outside! Where are we going, sneaking away like thieves?. We're going to a small island, Miss. An island nobody knows. Nobody?. What's on this island?. Just a widow and her daughter. There are safe places in Shanghai. Why do we have to go there?. I'm not going! You are, like it or not. You know the rule. Miss, once we're on the island, you must stay calm. Don't wander off. Anyone landing or leaving without permission will be killed. Those are the Boss's orders. We haven't even told Song and Zheng. It isn't far from Shanghai. If people know we're there, they'll come and kill us. Is it that bad?. That's how it is. So many people in Shanghai are jealous of me. They all want to take my place in bed. The older you get, the more you know about pain. Shuisheng! Fetch the red box. Be careful. It's the Boss's medicine. Where do I sleep?. In the next room. We have to talk business with the Boss. Unless it's urgent, don't bother us for the next few days. Urgent?. In this place?. There's nothing to do here! Will you stop complaining?. Shuisheng, get rid of those swabs. Not in the sea. Bury them. All our rubbish must be buried. Don't forget it. FI FTH DAY Your lunch. Put it on the table. In the country we eat very plainly. It's exactly what we and the Boss want. What a sweet little girl. She's had lunch, sir. What's your name?. Ajiao. And your mommy?. Cuihua. How old are you?. -Nine. -Nine? That's nice. Cuihua, wait here. Is she your daughter? Yes. Her name is Ajiao. She's cute. She has a pretty nose, pretty eyes. You think she looks like you? She looks more like a child of mine. Ajiao, come here. Who is prettier? Your mother or me? What do you want to be when you grow up? Come on, tell me. I want to be like you. Ajiao! Have you been living here long? Several years. How can anybody live here? I'm bored to death after just one day. Shuisheng! Do you know where Miss is going? Go with her! Take an umbrella, it's starting to rain. Do you hear me? Shuisheng! Are you asleep? Get up! Shuisheng! Get up! Quick! Buzz off! Go on, go away! Open up! Who is it? It's me. I need you. Can't it wait till tomorrow? Open up! Are you counting your money or what? I haven't come to borrow money! You took your time! -Were you asleep? -Yes. On your own? Ajiao's sleeping too. I can't sleep on my own... so I came to talk to you. What about? Oh, we'll think of something. If you don't want to, never mind. I'll go. I'm going. Can I borrow some clothes? All mine are being washed. I have nothing to wear. I have only peasant's clothes. They'll do fine. Miss! See how ignorant I am about country ways? Walking into your bedroom uninvited! Do sit down. No, no. Thanks. Give me any old thing. Don't worry. Take your time. Besides, I've got nothing else to do. I can't sleep on my own. Here! I've found something. You sew very well. If I were a man, I'd marry you myself. I wouldn't leave you in somebody else's arms! I really have to go. Since you sleep alone, be sure to lock the door! I beg you, go away Go quickly, faraway Go quickly, far away SIXTH DAY Are those Mommy's clothes? Aren't they pretty? Yes! So pretty I'm going to keep them. I'm swapping clothes with her. Now you can call me " Mommy"... and you can call her " Miss." Teach me to sing. Shuisheng says you sing very well. Ajiao, can you sing? I only know one song. Then sing it for me. Go on, sing! If you sing well, I'll give you lessons. Come on, get up and sing! Up you get! Sing! Sing! Beddy-bye, beddy-bye Over Grandma's bridge Grandma says I'm good as gold I know how to laugh I know how to cry Two yellow dogs carry the litter On the bridge the birds are tweeting Do you know this song? My grandma sang it to me when I was little. In her red trousers and coat of brocade Grandma takes me to the litter Beddy-bye, beddy-bye Over Grandma's bridge Sing, Shuisheng. All together! So what if I had him killed? I gave the orders. Nobody lands or leaves without permission. He didn't bother you! That's not my problem! We have to be careful. Stop making such a fuss! If you minded your own business, he would still be alive. To tell you the truth... if you had kept quiet last night, I'd have been none the wiser. I owe you my thanks. Whom are you trying to blame? Not me! It's all your fault! Stop. Did you hear me and the Boss arguing? The Tang family is all bad. Cant you sleep? Then stay and talk to me. Do you know how to climb trees? Yes. When I was a girl... we had two trees in the yard. Mulberry trees. Very, very tall ones. People say mulberry trees in the yard... bring good luck. Every summer they bore lots of fruit. People came to pick them. And I... I climbed up in the tree and ate lots of them. See, I'm a country bumpkin too. Bijou the bumpkin. Bijou the bumpkin! Other than your uncle, have you got any family in Shanghai? Take this. Take it! When you've saved up enough to open a shop... go back to the country. Shanghai is all bad. I want to avenge my uncle. The Boss said his eyes cried out for vengeance. Oh, yeah? So go back to Shanghai. Be like your uncle. Go back to Shanghai and get killed. Go on, go to bed. Cuihua, this evening you and I can have a chat. -Hello, Miss! -Hard artwork? Take a seat, Miss. How old are you? I'm a Horse. A Horse? You look much older! Yet you're younger than me. When you look old, the mosquitos don't bite. Why dont you remarry? Surely there's somebody. There must be a man in your life. I could find you one. Uncle likes Mommy a lot. Ajiao! Go to bed. Who is Uncle? He lives on the island across the way. Does he visit often? He comes by boat in the night. Ajiao! Go to bed! When are you getting married? After the New Year. Forget that man. Why live in the country? Come to Shanghai with me. I'll find you a good husband. You can keep Ajiao with you. If you don't want to, I'll keep her. I like that girl. What are you saying, Miss? I mean it. I came here to talk about it. But I don't want to leave here. You really want to stay? Well, in that case... let me know when you get married. I'll give you a wedding trousseau. I'll send clothes for you and Ajiao... and I'll send an opera company... to sing for you. You're making fun of me. Everything's planned. For the wedding, he'll simply move in here. You must have had a grand wedding! Married, me? It's too soon for that! At your age you ought to be married. Oh, sure. I ought to. But I can't see who to. I don't know anyone worth it. You have to be patient with a man. Be sincere and he will treat you right. I've been sincere so many times. You'll find your Mr. Right. Up to now I've been unlucky. Now I'm with her uncle and I'm happy. Cuihua... I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come. What makes you say that? Really... I shouldn't have come. I shouldn't have come to this island. I'm truly sorry. Shuisheng! Were you waiting for me? I brought you the umbrella. Shuisheng, you must not stay with me. I'm not good to you. SEVENTH DAY Are you Cuihua? How do you know my name? I've eaten your fish soup so I know your name. Are you Ajiao? Come here. Say "Grandpa." Grandpa. You're pretty. You look like Bijou as a little girl. Bijou! Go get Miss. Bijou! Look at Ajiao. She looks like you as a girl. Cuihua, cook some fish. We have guests tonight. Song and Zheng. Got the shits again, you little prick? Serves you right... for staying outdoors all night! It's your fault you've got the shits! Move away! Move away! Shit, it's going to rain! Good. It will make the job easier. Doesn't Song mind about killing Bijou?. Do as you're told. Don't complicate things. Remember. Once the bitch is asleep... strangle her. Be careful not to make any noise. - Song said to stab her. - What's it to you?. Just don't disfigure her. It's raining. Where do we hide?. In the water. It'll be easy. There aren't many of them. What's up, Shuisheng?. Dont you know the rule?. Cant you see the Boss is here?. If its not urgent, get out. Shuisheng?. What's the matter?. Miss! They want to kill you! Shuisheng, calm down. Take it easy. What did you hear?. What did you see?. I heard two men. They were planning to kill Miss. Shuisheng, look at me. Look at me! Explain yourself. I had the shits. I was crouching down. - I heard two men. - Saying what?. They were going to kill Miss with a knife. Shuisheng, who was going to kill Miss?. How many men did you come with, Song?. Two. That's a lie. Two boats and 1 8 men, right?. Do you think Zheng is stupid?. Why did you bring so many men?. Just to kill Bijou?. What did she do to you?. Why meddle in my private life?. Dont you get it yet?. Then I'll explain. See Song there, looking so serious?. He actually works for Fat Yu. He came here... to kill us all. Do you think I've been twirling my thumbs since we got here?. On August 6th... after the police seized those 80 packs of opium... the Boss invited the customs officers to dinner. That night, our man watching Song... saw him go to Miss's house for the first time. After that, he went there often. We have all the details. On the 3rd of this month, Fat Yu invited Song to dinner. They met secretly at a restaurant. The next evening, the 4th... the Boss was attacked. Liu, Agen, Acha, Aniu and Miaofa were killed. The next day the Boss came here to hide... protected by 40 of Zheng's men. Last night, the Boss sent Zheng to Shanghai... to invite Song to come here alone. But 1 8 of Song's men arrived after dark. Song... I knew that you and Fat Yu were out to get me in Shanghai. I also knew that... when you got Zheng's message, you'd send men here to kill me. What Shuisheng overheard, we already knew. I came to this godforsaken place... but the whole thing was planned... to set you up this evening. Now do you see?. Song... do you want to see my wounds?. Not one hole except my navel! Boss... you don't like my " Moonlight" song. But Song often promised me... that once he had taken your place... I could sing it for him every day. He also said he would give me the nightclub... so I could listen to other people sing. He promised we'd get married in France... and I would sing " Moonlight" for him on our wedding day. Isn't that so, Song?. Faraway, the clouds are fading My lover appears in the moonlight I'll murder you! Bitch! I'll kill you! Did you think I loved you?. I loathe you! Seeing you with that old wreck made me sick! You peasant bitch! Who do you think you are?. I never loved you! For the last five years... there wasn't a day I didn't want to murder you. Listen, Zheng, and you too... listen to me! I wanted to kill him, not for my sake... but for the sake of the Tang family! With me in charge, think what we'd have done! With me in charge it would all be different! He's old. He's out of date! Shuisheng. There's no need for you to stay. Go to bed. Go on. Run along. You can insult me all you like... but tonight we're going to settle up the score. Not bad! You really are a hotshot. I didn't expect you to get up. Your 1 8 men are lying there. You'll have company, Song! When I get back to Shanghai, I'll say that Fat Yu killed you. I'll wear mourning for you... to show all of Shanghai how much I value my men. Zheng and I will kill Fat Yu to avenge you. Shanghai is going to see some action! Too bad you won't be around to watch. Have you got a final wish?. I'll grant it for you. I've said all I had to say. I wasn't going to speak again... but as you're in such a good mood... I'll say one more thing to please you. You forgot one thing. Maybe you had me followed... but I could easily have done the same to you. What do we do with him?. Bury him alive. Since you had a little act with Song... you're going to bow out with him. As they say, you had it coming! I'm not going to publicize your dirty little tricks. I'm not going to lose face. Nobody will ever know. You will die as white as a lily. According to the rules, I will ask you one last question: Have you anything to say?. Have you got a final wish?. You know I never asked you for anything before. Now I ask for just one thing. All right. Say it. Cuihua and Ajiao were not involved in any of this. Don't touch them. Obviously, I'm taking Ajiao with me. We'll take care of her. In a few years, she'll be a new Bijou. But as for Cuihua... it's too late. I didn't want to kill her... but since you talked to her, she knew too much. See?. Your fault again. But that night... I told her nothing. I talked about myself... about my background. Cuihua... forgive me. Please forgive me. - I shouldn't have come. - What was that?. I said... you're a pig! An old pig! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Miss! Come the spring... the grass on that island will be good. You're right, Boss. Grandpa, you have to let Shuisheng down! Later. It's not hurting him. Don't worry. Ajiao, did you never have a dog?. No. A good dog has to be trained. That's what I'm doing to him. Where's Mommy?. And Miss?. Didnt you say... we would meet them on the boat?. They went away on another boat. We'll meet up with them in Shanghai. Am I going to Shanghai?. Yes, we're on our way to Shanghai. In Shanghai, will I have pretty dresses?. Yes. And lots office things?. Sure! Lots of bracelets and rings. I want to be like Miss. All right. You'll be like Miss. You'll be like Miss. Beddy-bye, beddy-bye Over Grandma's bridge Grandma says I'm good as gold I know how to laugh I know how to cry Two yellow dogs carry the litter
