 

                        Turn left. Make a right. Is this the kitchen? - Yes. It's a pretty large kitchen. How big is it? It's about Look! It's connected through here. - Not bad. How many rooms are there? Three... three bedrooms and two parlors. How big is the room up ahead? This room is at least 35 square meters. This is the living room? - Yes. Why is there a bed? The landlord put it there... but if you guys are planning to rent the room, you can rearrange the room later. There's no other furniture? Yes, but these are all brand new. The landlord just renovated it and he's out of the country now. I think it's too big. Really? Too big? This is what you requested to look at. Is there another room over there? Yes, that's another bedroom. - There's another room? We do have smaller rooms, but we just looked at them. The bathroom's here. - Yes. The bathroom's here? Wait, there's still a lot of rooms over here. We're going to take a look at them. - Sure. Hello? Can we go in here? Go ahead, feel free. Hello? Fever again? How? I know, I'll be over when I'm done here. Ok. Teacher Gao said she was warm this afternoon. I gave her some medicine when she came back from school. It helped a bit. But now it looks like her fever's back. Don't worry about it, eh? Let me see. She shouldn't have such a high fever. Do you want to take her to the hospital? Wait until after tonight, we can monitor her condition. Yes. I want find grandpa... I want find grandpa... ...behind you. Mom, please find Grandpa for me! Grandpa is waiting outside! I still have a headache. Headache still? What should I put for registration? Neurology is fine. Are there any specialists? Not today. Checkup Room Come on, eat another bite. Who's Hehe? Hello doctor. - Hello. How are you? Let me see. How's she feeling? She's good. Where are the results? Can you come out with me for a second? I'll go. - Ok. Here, Daddy has some rice congee. Good girl, eat some more, you'll get better faster. I'm going downstairs to buy groceries. There's nothing to eat. You don't have to buy the groceries. I should still buy some. When Hehe wakes she'll want to eat something. She'll need to keep her strength when she starts chemotherapy. Are you sure you don't want to call him? Such a disaster. Stop enduring it yourself. I know you're worried, but I'm even more worried. I ask the contractor for money every day! But where is the money? So? You ask for money but I need my own money too. I need to have money first! That contractor's not giving me money. - I signed my contract with you. You already signed with me. I signed my contract with that contractor too! I signed with you! If I don't ask you for money, who am I going to ask? I don't have any money to give you. So? If the contractor refused to give me money, where am I going to get the money then? You said you would pay me some money. - You can't force me. Even if you made me jump off a building, I still wouldn't have money to pay! No one's forcing you to jump off a building. I think you are. - Stop it. I am... - No pay? Stop the construction! Stop it. - Stop the construction. Now! Yes. - We'll see how you do without me. You don't scare me! Come on! - I'm not joking. Can we? - I know but... why are you fighting with me for all day? - I'm not joking! Really? Stop the construction! I'm not joking! Hello? Lao Xie. Oh, Hello. Come in, hello hello. - Hello. Sit down. I want to see the child first. Oh, sure. I'm out of cigarettes. Be right back, I'm going downstairs to buy some more. I have some, take these. Let him go. You two sit here, I'm going downstairs. Where's the girl? She's sleeping in her room. Hehe's condition... Is it serious? It's bad. She needs a bone marrow transplant. How long do we have? We found it late on. We have to see how well the Chemotherapy is working. If it doesn't work... Then she only has She needs a matching donor soon. I've already sent a sample to the lab for testing. You should go send in a sample too. The parents are supposed to provide the best match. It's pretty hard to find a perfect match. Ok. I'm going now. Why did you get that? Hehe likes this book. I want to decorate her hospital room. Can you? Should we let the school know that Hehe needs tomorrow off? Right now, I don't want anyone to know yet. I understand. Just tell them she still has a fever. We can't hide it forever. You called my phone? Hm? No. Oh, I called you by accident. You've done that so many times. You should put a lock on it. Sorry, I don't know how to. From today on, you are not allowed to cry anymore. Especially in front of Hehe. Okay? Let's go. Come down quickly. This old and you still like riding on Daddy's back? For shame. Come down. - No, Daddy don't put me down. Ok, if you are embarrassed... - Be careful. ...when people look at you, it's not my fault. Daddy, I want to ride the airplane. Ok, go ahead. - Be careful. Okay. Ready for flight. Okay. Ready for landing. Daddy, I still want to play. Ok, one more time. Department of Pediatric Hematology These are Hehe's records, you can arrange them how you see fit. Ok. - Well. I'm going. Ok. - I'm going. Are you the parents? - Yes. Here are some forms you need to fill out. Here are two surgical masks to wear when you enter the room. It's this bed. She's scheduled for a checkup this afternoon. If you have any questions, just call me. Yes. - Yes. Hehe see what daddy brought you. You think it's pretty? Yes, it's pretty. Hehe. Do you want daddy to put a sticker on the wall? Ok. - I will. This sticker? - Ok. Ok, Daddy's putting it on the wall. Is here okay? Put it here. Ok, right here. Good? No, over there. Oh, then stick it there. You like it? - Yes. Daddy's gonna put it there. I'm so hungry, where do you want to eat? Hey, Xiao Tian, you should come with us to eat. I'm fine. I don't think I can go with you guys. I'll just drop you guys off first and then I have to hurry to work. There's some things I have to do. All messed up. How come it's like this every time? Can't help it, I'm sorry. How about you go eat with Xiao Tian? I can meet up with you afterwards. I've already explained it to them several times. It's no use, they still complain. As you said, I already gave them part of their money. This way, they would have to work. But the problem is still there. These two days are going to be rough. Can't let the construction halt. I know all this. Hello. I'm at the work site. How's the girl? How about the blood sample? No match. Neither of us are a match. Don't worry yet. I still have some work to do here. I'll come over in a while. How is it at Hong Ye's? Now we have more to worry about than Hong Ye. Even Wei Xin's people can't find any. Those bastards. Now what? We can't keep doing this, it's bad for the company. I know. Don't worry about those matters. Just make sure you secure this project. Take it day by day. You're here. How's her condition? Still good. They just started the treatment. Where's Mei Zhu? She's over there with the IV. An old problem, low blood sugar. Where? I'll take you to see her. Sure. Are you ok? You two talk. - Thanks. Take this... You should pay the bills. You're here. Yeah, smoking a cigarette. Want one? Sure, why not. Busy recently? Quite busy. It's good to be occupied. Any problems with the work site? It's fine. The last few days have been hard on you. Let's not talk about it. Always wanted to thank you. Heard Mei Zhu say you've been good to Hehe. Of course. Hehe, she's adorable. I loved her from the start. How is the girl doing overall? She's fine. Her mother's very careful. Fortunately, she's still young. And doesn't understand what's happening. When she's older, we'll tell her. I don't think you'll need to. Well, I'm off to check on her again. Oh, one thing... We will try our best to heal her. Money's not an issue. I know. What's wrong? Nothing. Just some things on my mind. I'm sorry. Go to sleep. Hey, Mouse. Tell me what's wrong. What did he want? Oh, I know. Didn't you already give them money last time? Yes, it's not enough. But we have an understanding. Right now, I can't go. I have family problems. Just tell them the money is not a problem. I promise that every one of them can go home and have a good holiday. Yes. Hello, it's me. How is it at Hong Ye's? You tell them, it's rough. Things are bound to happen if they don't pay. I'm not at the work site, Mouse is in charge. Watch out for Hong ye and Wei Xin. Give me a call if you need help. After one period of treatment, It seems we didn't get positive results. But it is not the worst. So I think the best idea for now is to perform a bone marrow transplant Of course generally, we will do anything possible to avoid a graft. The expense for this operation is too much. Also, it's been difficult to find a match. Right now, neither you nor the father is an ideal donor. If we are going to operate, It's best to get at least a 5-point match. If there are any blood sisters and brothers, then there is more hope of finding a donor. I recently met a child. She luckily had a sister who had the matching five points. Of course, for a one-child family, this is more difficult. But don't get too anxious. The hospital will think of a plan. Ok, how about you get her an outpatient bracelet. Remember that before her second treatment, she must take her medicine regularly. I will. Thank you Dr. Cao. Take care. - Thanks. Goodbye. - Bye. Don't fuss, walk normally. I'm so tired. - Stop running. It's good. - How's the house? It's good. Stop running. Listen to me! Say auntie. Auntie! How old is she? Tell her how old you are. How cute. Cute nothing, she's so naughty. You have two kids? I didn't consider it. But my husband's family kept encouraging me. And once you have one, raising them goes by pretty fast. Come on. What do you think of the apartment? The place is nice, there just isn't that much furniture. Want to reconsider? You see, the place is spacious, but it needs more furniture. We want to move in as soon as possible and start living here. Give us some time to think about it. OK, we'll wait for you outside next to the elevator. Hello. - You rest. No, it's fine. Really, I appreciate all you've done. Why do you say that? If it wasn't for you... I can't face my kid alone. Hehe... Knows too much for a kid. She moves everyone who meets her. This treatment didn't help at all. I'm truly worried. Don't freak out about it. It's only been one treatment. Don't worry. Lao Xie. Yeah? Nothing. Rest assured. I've taken a leave of absence. I'm going to work at home instead. You don't need to worry anymore. Go back and rest. Today's not good, I don't have enough time. Ok. well can you do tomorrow instead? Oh, if that's the case, I can schedule more appointments tomorrow. We'll look for apartments tomorrow then. - What would you like to drink? Water is fine. - Yes. Ok? A cup of tea and a cup of hot water please. Bi Luo Chun tea please. I understand. Rest assured. Good! I really thank you for doing this. See you tomorrow. Right, I will call you. Ok. Bye. Thanks. Xiao Lu. I want another child. Ok. Lao Xie is a good guy. It's about time you had another baby. No, not with him. I want a baby... with you. What? It's not what you're thinking. Wait... wait. I know you're worried. But isn't the doctor working to find other alternatives? We're waiting for a match. There's not enough time, I can't wait anymore. I've already thought about it. And this was the best idea I thought of. This waiting is hopeless, we can take initiative. Think about it, if Hehe had a blood sibling, we could use the umbilical cord blood to save Hehe. After nine months of pregnancy, Hehe will be saved. This is outrageous. We've been divorced for so many years... I know it sounds absurd. Actually, I need to convince myself... ...to do this too. Listen to me Mei Zhu- You know I have so many things going on in my life right now. Another child is just not an option. You don't need to be responsible for another baby. But Hehe needs one, I need one. I know, I know. You are too caught up with her cancer, you can't do this. You're not doing it because of Dong Fan right? I will go find her and beg her. I can repay her kindness if she agrees even if it takes my whole life, Mei Zhu, it's not like that. You know we've separated for so many years and we each have our own families now. Dong Fan and I... To tell you the truth, Dong Fan has always wanted a baby. But I've been avoiding the subject. I tell her she's still young, there's time. Right now, my life is just so busy. I can't even think about having a baby. Do you think I should coax her into not wanting a baby? And tell her that us two should have a baby? Isn't that messed up? It would definitely complicate things. Listen to me. Here you go again. I beg you. Don't look at me like that. Really. Please reconsider. Ok. You can think about it. I am asking you to reconsider. How was your day? It was fine. But I didn't want to see my clients today. None of them were willing to rent the apartment. These days, there's too many options for apartments. You know what's weird? The company has one apartment on the market for over 2 months now. Furniture, decorations, everything is in great condition. But no one wants to rent it. The company is very anxious to get a lease. Let me do it, the water's cold. Lao Xie. - Yes. Give me the washcloth, I'll wipe the table. Is this a joke? You don't think it's preposterous? You two have been divorced for 4 years now. We've been married for two years, you have a new family. And now you want to go have a new baby with your ex-wife? Coming back home, and trying to convince me to accept this! The nerve! She actually came over to ask if she could borrow your services! I beg you, think about what you are doing. You don't need to say it so meanly. She is just crazy about her child. This is what she said. But that doesn't mean I agreed to do it. I'm not being meanly. I never ask about your past relationship with her. The two of you have children, and I'm fine with that. The child is sick, the child needs money, I never complain! But some things are just too much. Can you blame me for this? Did I ask to have another kid? Also, This issue is on the table, we're only doing this to save a life. The life in question is that of my daughter. My own flesh and blood. Plenty of people are diagnosed with cancer. But do you see them taking such drastic measures? Of course not. She only heard what the doctor said. He said this is the safest method, with the highest rate of success. And now she's fixated on this as the solution. I will talk to her. Why are you going to talk to her? It's no use. I understand her. That child is her life. I know now why you don't want to have a baby with me. Why are you bringing this up? You know our situation. Your life is busy, my life is busy. How can we have a kid at a time like this? Fine then. Then what is there to talk about? Do you even care about my opinion on this? Very much. What if I don't want you to have another baby? Don't look at me like that. Mei Zhu, we're ready. I'm coming. I'm coming. You ready? We're getting out now. Come on, Come on. Is Hehe ready? - Yes. Sprinting out now! Hurry up. - Let's go. Quickly. Dry your hair. Mama will dry your hair. Hurry, put on your clothes. Listen to mama, good girl. Put your clothes on. Now we are okay. - Daddy tell me a story. Ok. Mama's telling it or daddy's telling it? I want Daddy to tell it. - Ok. What is Mama going to do? - Mama can leave. Ok. Mama's leaving, give me a kiss. Good girl. - Daddy is telling a story now. Ok, after daddy tells you the story, you go to sleep eh? Ok. I've got a story. Let's do a riddle first. - Ok. Okay. Ding Ling Ling Ding Ling Ling. Before meeting, first ring the bell. With tens of thousands of miles in between. Every word can be heard clearly. What is it? A Telephone. So smart! Daddy's going to tell you a story now, ok? Deep in the mountains, there's a monster. Let's divorce. Why? You are aware of the results from the doctor. Xiao Lu and I both don't match. Now, other than waiting for another solution, the only hope lies in a new baby sister or brother for Hehe. This way, their umbilical cord blood can save her. So, I want to have another baby with Xiao Lu. I know it sounds absurd. You want to get back together with him? No. I just need to have another baby with him. Things are not as simple as you think. I understand. I know your heart. I'm worried too. But this is big. Have you ever thought... What happens if you and I want another baby later? I have thought all this through. But this compared to saving Hehe... ...is nothing in comparison. Lao Xie. Don't worry about me. I just wanted you to know... ...I won't drag you into this. You have talked this over with Xiao Lu? Yes, we've discussed it. You also understand, if not for the child, I would never want to see him again. Did he agree to it? He has to. Not many people in the world can handle this sort of situation. Yes, I know. That's because they've never had to experience anything like this. I'm going to buy cigarettes. Ma'am, I brought back some bottles. - Yes. Put them down there - Ok. Thanks. - No problem. Bye. - Bye. Sorry, she won't let me. I don't care about her. What about you? If I do this, then we will probably have to divorce. I'm doing all I can, have some sympathy. Don't talk to me about sympathy. You know I am... - You're surrounded by dilemmas? Yes, I know. Because I am too. Lao Xie is the best man on the face of the earth. But because of our child because of Hehe He doesn't agree either. Right? If only he didn't agree, then I wouldn't owe him so much. Dong Fan is still young. Some things can still change. Give me a little more time. Who's going to give Hehe more time? I'll be in Hehe's room. Hehe. Oh, you're here. Hehe, you have a visitor. Hehe. Say hello. Hello Uncle. You guys have some alone time. Hehe, Daddy's going out real quick. Have fun with Uncle. Hehe, do you feel well? I'm sick. Yes. Our Hehe is sick. But, only a little sickness. Ok? I'm not going to get well again. Who said that? Lies! All diseases can be cured. Mama is always crying. Mama's crying... ...because Mama cares about Hehe. Come, drink a little. I know you are my father too. Oh. Your Daddy and I are both your father. Then are you going to save me too? Fan- You're really not going back? Do you have anything to do later? No, nothing. Coming. Who is it? Who are you looking for? I'm looking for Mei Zhu. I'm Xiao Lu's wife, Dong Fan. Oh, hello hello, please come in. Please come in. You are Lao Xie? My name is Xie Huai Cai. But just call me Lao Xie. This is my co-worker Xiao Tian. Oh. Hello Xiao Tian. - Hello. Your job is pretty amazing. Getting to fly everywhere. You are looking for Mei Zhu? Right, I want to talk to her. Mei Zhu has mentioned you a few times. She's always wanted to meet you. How unlucky, today she's not home. I just wanted to chat with her. I didn't know where she would be. So I just came here. It's best to talk at home. I can give her a call and tell her you are here. No no, it's fine, we can wait. Alright. Daddy. You two sit for a minute. Coming. Hehe, you're awake. Say hello to auntie. Hello auntie. Let's sit. So you're Hehe. How old are you? Five. Come play with auntie. Ok? This child... Auntie has something to give you, wait a second. Hehe, look, chocolate. Auntie just brought it from out of the country. Just got off the plane. Do you want to eat one? Ok, here you go. You can open it yourself. Go on, take it. Say thank you auntie. - Thank you auntie. Hehe are you thirsty? - Yes. Sit here a while with auntie. Daddy's going to get you some water. No, I don't want to. This child, I can't go anywhere without her. Daddy, take me with you. You two sit here. Drink more water, you'll get better sooner. Why are you leaving? Just wait a while, Mei Zhu will be right back. We have errands to run. - Yes. Ok then, that is unfortunate. Do you want to leave a telephone number? I can ask her to call you. No, it's fine. We... Next time. Ok, tell auntie goodbye. Bye auntie. Hehe, you're such a good girl, let's go now. Say goodbye to this lady too. Bye auntie. I'll walk you out. Bye now. Go in first, it's cold outside. Ah, don't worry bout it. Goodbye. Fan, are you ok? Hurry up and change. Today you're with me so you have to listen to what I say. Don't think about your problems. Hey! hurry and change. What for? Eat, you have to eat. Seven 5s. - Start! Drink. Come on, everyone drinks up. You have to drink too! Don't give her any. I can drink by myself. Hey, what are you doing? You're not coming up? No you go on ahead. Get some rest. If you are hungry, there's food in the fridge. Sweet dreams. Where are you going? Take care. Hello? Xiao Lu? Are you at home? I'm telling you... ...I saw the girl today. Xiao Lu- Promise me one thing. If I agree to let you... Can we have our own baby? I can become a stay at home mom. Sometimes I feel really lonely. Alright. I agree to all of your terms. And I promise this. Here you are. - Thanks. Xiao Lu just called. - Yes. He said, Dong Fan... ...already agreed. Lao Xie, If you want to leave me, I won't blame you. These days, my heart aches... ...from thinking. If I didn't abort our baby... Why are you saying these things? Have you ever wondered... What happens if you and I want another baby later? I don't want to hear this. At least, not right now. I know there will be a lot of problems. But I can't really control the situation. Because I know what you are thinking. I already have a child. If I give birth to another, then I won't be able to have any more children. This is not fair to you. I'm very clear about that. I don't know what to do right now. But you can't let me watch Hehe suffer. Don't talk about it. I know. I'm out of cigarettes, I'm going downstairs to buy some more. I'm leaving. Why in such a hurry, are you catching a plane? No, I'm "shooting a plane". (slang for "masturbation") Stop fooling around. Do you need my help today? Thanks wife. I can handle it. I've been doing this since middle school. Come on. Then don't let her help either. I'm begging you. Have faith. Come back quickly. I'll come straight back when I'm done. Thanks wife. Go now. I'm leaving. Department of Obstetrics and Birth Control Walk straight down this corridor and make a left at the end. There'll be a small door, just walk in there. Ok. There's a small container. You shouldn't come with. I'll wait for you here. Don't wait here. Go wait with the doctor. It didn't work this time. But this often happens the first time, not to worry. If you two want to try again, that's fine. You're laughing. I finally understand what they mean by "when the fertilizer flows, outside farms flourish." That doesn't have anything to do with this. Then what does that count for? Maybe it's because recently... work has been busy and it's taking a toll. I think you have... ...middle aged men syndrome. Menopause? It seems like it! It came a little early. You complaining about it being early. With you, I'm becoming faster. Say, how come these things I have to share? Did I owe you something in a previous life? No, I definitely owed you something. All three times have failed. This method doesn't seem to work. What's the problem? It's hard to tell. Have you had an abortion before? I didn't think I would want children after my second marriage. So I did it once. Afterwards, I felt guilty, so I tried to have children again. But I miscarried all of them. I'm just worried about habitual abortion. You are not young. Is there any other method? We've tried the best. Doctor, how about we try one more time? That's not possible, it's against hospital policy. We have already let you slide on the rules. So you're saying that we have to do it for real. Mei Zhu, you should have some common sense. Artificial fertilization is the most effective. This won't work, you can't put this all on me. No matter what you say, I have already decided on this matter. Even if there is only a 1% chance, I must take it. You don't think that matters are complicated enough? Alright, tell me what to say to Dong Fan tonight then. Don't tell her. Just say we are still going to the clinic. If I get pregnant, fine, if not, just forget about it. When the time comes, I can die with my daughter. I won't contact you after this, Xiao Lu. Rest assured. Mei Zhu. People cannot be too selfish. Cannot be only thinking of themselves. If we do this, think about who we would hurt. The girl, I'm doing this for the girl. Xiao Lu, you don't have to force me. I don't have any other option. How is it that I'm forcing you? When you left me, I didn't say anything, I didn't take anything. I have never regretted it. If not for Hehe, I would never come beg you. For the rest of my life, I would never have asked you for a favor. You must be very clear. How can Lao Xie agree to this? I have already told you. I won't tell him. This scandal will get us on TV. I'm not scared to do anything. When the day comes, I'll contact you. Why? Why can't I have my one child? I'm sorry. Now is not the time. I lent her my husband to have a child but I cannot have a child of my own. It's not that. I suddenly feel very tired, very down. I know that. Have you thought about me though? Yes. That's why I think that now's not the time. - I know. You don't have the energy to do anything with me. But you have all the energy for her. How can you say that? Now, everything is messed up. You're only confusing matters. You're confused. Not me. I feel as if I've done my best. I love you, and I pity the child, you can make me do whatever you want. But I deserve a life of my own. I feel torn apart between you two. Now you won't. Yesterday afternoon, she called to say it failed again. Are you happy now? What kind of person do you think I am Xiao Lu? I understand you. It's because I know you too well, that I'm willing to take all the blame. What do you want me to do? Tell me now, what do you want me to do? You've already done all you can. I wronged you. Mei Zhu still doesn't want to give up. She wants to try again. But the clinic refuses to let us try again. There's more. I don't want to hide this from you. I already knew this. This is not enough. You two still want more. I know all of this for you is very unfair. Shut up. Get up. These words may not sound right now. But I've been thinking about it. I shouldn't be in your life anymore. Tomorrow I'm going to work. You can file the divorce papers. Send me the draft via email, I'll come back to sign them. Please don't say this right now. We need to calm down and think about it. I've already made up my mind. Time is very important to this child. I'm no longer in your way. This is a nice apartment! We four people will lie on one bed! This bed is so soft! Isn't the design of this apartment weird? Come here, there are two more rooms over there. Let's take a look. This is a nice apartment! I think it's too expensive. Ah, the elevator is here. Hurry up. Hello. Hey. I've been in a meeting. Hello. Lao Xie. - Yes. Hehe needs to go to the bathroom. Coming. Come on. I'm coming. Daddy will take you to the bathroom. Your clients want to see the apartments today? Yes, they insisted on coming today, I scheduled the appointment ages ago. Say bye to mama. Bye ByeByeBye Mama. - Goodbye. Lao Xie, have you seen my cell phone? It might be on top of the microwave. Hehe. Mama is leaving. Bye Mama. - Goodbye. Are you done? - Yes. Let's go to see Hehe. Come on. Quick. Teacher Gao. Hello Hehe's father. - Hello. I've heard about Hehe's problems. She hasn't been to school in a while now. All her classmates miss her. I've brought them today to visit Hehe. Oh, thank you thank you, please come in. Say hi to uncle. - Hello uncle. Hello students. Please come in. - Walk inside. Come inside the room. It's warmer in here. Come in. Come in. Come on. Quick. Let's go. Come in. Come in. Teacher Gao, please. - Where's Hehe? She's in her room, I'll call her out. Please come in. Kids, have a seat. - Sit on the sofa. Sit on the sofa. Left. Right. Start! Small sea shells, small sea shells. What is this sound? Ocean Shells. Ocean Shells. What are they singing? We want to prick up our ears. Listen. Listen. Whosh! whosh whosh whosh! There won't be anyone coming? No. The landlord is out of the country. The place hasn't been leased yet. Let's go in first. Little bear, little bear, nod your head. Nod your head. 1, 2, 1. Little doll, smile. Hey, Mei Zhu. This place seems strange. Hello? Hello? Ah! This is a living room, the landlord put a bed here. That's probably why it seems strange. There's someone living here? No. There isn't. These things are all brand new, I bought some quilts. There's personal hygiene products back there too. The furniture is left from before.
