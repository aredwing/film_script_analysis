For 50 grand, You didn't have to bother me. Mr. Gela. Oh, I didn't know that package belonged to you. So now you know. Yeah. Now I know, and the deal is off. Now don't push your luck. I may be a sentimental meathead, But this time, This package is on the house. On the house? Why on the house? Tom Devlin. Who? Tom Devlin. He was my father. I'm Tolly Devlin. Devlin. Devlin! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. You used to work with him in the '30s, right? Now I know why you look so familiar. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I used to work with him. You and him was like brothers, 'til my old man got bumped off. Who told you we were like brothers? Vic Farrar. I met him in a prison hospital. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. He's from the old days too. Mr. Gela. You know them four gonzos that bumped my father off? Yeah? They got paid off. Burned to death in a car wreck. Who told you that? Vic. Died in my arms in a hospital. I ain't takin' no package from you. You tryin' to tell me That you're dumpin' 50 grand Just because of sentiment? It would be like tappin' my own father. Hello? It worked. I scored with Gela. Now keep that broad in the house. She's hot. Tolly. Tolly, wait a minute. Tolly! Tolly! What do you mean, he's no cop? He's a thief. And he just got out of prison. He used me to get his hands On that stuff, didn't he? Yes. Well. I don't care. He saved my life. He thinks his old man and I were blood brothers. So, I put him on for a fast 75 a week As a numbers collector. Relax, relax. He's loaded with loyalty. Anyway, Im runnin' a check on him. The name Devlin Still rubs me the wrong way. Well... Im a sentimental slob When it comes to lovin' a parent. I wish my kid felt about me The way Tolly feels about his old man. Hey, what's this? What? This report on the police chief. What is this? Oh. Chief fowler. He wants me to lay off my houses For a few months. Why? He thinks someone in our camp Is selling him out to Driscoll. What are you payin' him? 5,000 a week. That's a fat bonus for a police chief. That's more than I grease my union lobby guys. He's worth it! We're clocking 100,000 a week In girls, numbers and distribution. Five grand's a bargain. Yeah, but maybe he's usin' Driscoll as an alibi. He's been tryin' to get out for months. You know that. No, I don't think so. Look, he's very close to his family. He's worried stiff about that daughter of his. Besides, I warned him he'd be putting her head on the block If he even tried to think of crossing us. The syndicate bosses in the field Command the rackets Like generals in the field command divisions. And lording it over the syndicate wheels Is the top brass. The underworld's combined chiefs of staff. Each chief commands a specific department. Gela, narcotics. Gunther, labor. Smith, prostitution and so on. They all have substantial business fronts, Pay taxes, Wear respectable suits. And lording it over all of them Is Earl Connors. Their chief of staff. Shrewd, Warm, Charitable. An animal. He arbitrates the disputes between the syndicate bosses, Pulls national strings, And controls gangdom from their headquarters at national projects. A building only A beehive of concealed activity, With a legitimate business facade, From the basement to the penthouse Executive offices. Now. The most vicious increase in vice Is the teenage dope addict. And... the recruitment of school girls Into the ranks of prostitution. They're using coffeehouses and soda shops as fronts. The underworld is reaching the young people Of this country. Our job... is to get people to prosecute. Ha, ha. Getting anybody to talk is tough. Families of informers have been... butchered, burned, bludgeoned to death. However, We have found a man who is not afraid. He's called Menken. He works as a bookkeeper for national projects, And he has agreed to bring me evidence That Earl Connors is paying police chief fowler $5,000 a week bribery To permit local traffic in dope and girls. Connie, we've always leveled with each other. I'm washed up. What are you talking about? I've been on the take. I've been getting $5,000 a week For turning my back on dope traffic and prostitution. I'm sorry, Connie. I haven't got the stomach to face your mother. ] You'll have to. I'm not gonna tell her. I don't know what you did with all that money, But you're gonna have to tell her this yourself. Those lectures you gave the rookies every year. Telling them that the lowest crook in the world Is a crooked cop. ] Why did you do it? Why? Because they threatened to chop your mother in a meat grinder And send the pieces to me in a basket! You're alive. That's all that counts to me. You and... mother are alive. Where are you taking him? To the federal building, Connie. Come on, dad. Let's go. Tell mother Ill be down in a minute. We'll be waiting downstairs, Mr. Driscoll. I wish I had a daughter with her guts. You tell your story to the world, bill, And a lot of frightened witnesses are gonna crawl out from under the rocks. Are you crazy? Ten minutes before you get me on the stand, they'll chop her! I know how they operate. And so do you. No, John. My family's dead while Im alive. God forgive me. Bill! Devlin. Who? Tolly Devlin. From here on, When you make a pick-Up, Bring the money here, immediately. What, after each one? Yeah. Can't have our collectors walking around with a big bundle. It's always an invite for lone wolf hijackers. What are you worried about? I got Gus with me. Uh uh. I been makin' the rounds with you So the customers get to know you. Now you make your pick-Ups alone. Devlin, here's tomorrow's route. Gus, Mr. Gela's lookin' for you. Come on, Ill give you a cook's tour Of how the higher echelon works upstairs. Hey, what do you got? A swimmin' pool out there? Yeah. On a roof? Sure. Well, let's take a swim. Nope, it's just for the big wheels And underprivileged kids. Once every week, national projects turns it over to them. And every month there's a swim meet. Well, Tolly. Mr. Gela. I haven't seen you all week. Gettin' along okay? They've been keeping me on the run, you know. Hey, that's a nice suit you got. Gus's tailor. Hey... that, uh... bookkeeper That dropped out of circulation. Menken? Yeah, Mr. Menken. Find him. See you boys. As I was saying, the chamber of commerce Gave us a plaque for sponsoring youth clubs. I even acted as lifeguard for the kids one day. I liked that. Menken's gotta be the man. He was the only one who paid the chief every week, personally. What about his family? Not a trace. I just gave Gus the assignment. Send for the boys. Ask Smith and Gunther to come to the pool. I've been on the phone To at least nine cities in the past hour. About Driscoll? No, they know he's my headache. They're disappointed in your figures. I'm stretchin' the rubberband from coast to coast. I want to hear it snap. There are at least 13 million kids in this country Between the ages of 10 and 15. Don't tell me the end of a needle has a conscience. Put more field men to work around the schools. Mr. Gunther. The mister means trouble. Real trouble. The coast wants to know why You haven't made any headway with the longshoremen. Strong arm isn't helping the teamster situation. It's the unions themselves. Locals are kickin' our men out of office. Hello, Smith. Everybody's asking me about Driscoll. Think he's got a pipeline to the girls? We don't know yet, but what we do know Is that you showed a loss last month. St. Louis, Chicago, San Francisco, All showed drops. Let's have another drink. Think I like sitting on you like this? I hate it. But it's gotta be done. 'Cause we won't stay big if we lose our grip. There'll always be people like Driscoll. There'll always be people like us. As long as we don't have any record on paper, As long as we run national projects, A legitimate business operation. And pay our taxes on legitimate income... and donate to charities and run church bazaars, We'll win the war. We always have. Hello, Jenny. Remember me? Boy, this is a nice bike. You're Jenny Menken, aren't you? Yes. How did you know my name? I'm a friend of your daddy's. Say, you haven't seen him today, have you? No. He went away on important business. Mommy says. Oh. He went away on business. Do you know where he went? No. Say, would you like some gum? Uh huh. Go on, take it. It's all right. I'm not a stranger. I'm a friend of your daddy's. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye. IYes? This is Gus. I couldn't find Mr. Menken. But his wife and two kids are living with his cousin. I just got through talking with his little girl. IWell, the only way to keep Mr. Menken's mouth shut IIs to teach him a lesson. Get rid of that kid. Bye bye, mister. Jenny! Jenny! Aah! There you are. Ha, ha! How 'bout that? That's for you. And I got a little somethin' here for cuddles. There. Here. How's that? Hey, how is the muffin anyway? She's gone. What do you mean, gone? Out. Out where? Who knows? Why didn't you stop her? I did try to stop her. Did you ever try to grab a handful of dynamite? She called a while ago and said she'd call back, and then hung up. Asked for you. Why'd she leave? She got lonely. Lonely? What do you mean lonely? She got a problem, so she got drunk. Problem? Everybody's got a problem. What kind of a problem? Yeah? Wait a minute, honey. Yeah? The park, the park. Where lovers spark. Where are you? I got tired of wearin' one dress, And I went back to my joint to pick up some of my gowns. Where are you? Ace bar. I'll meet you in the park. You stupid little broad, you get over here... ahh! What are you, nuts? Going back to your house like that, for Petes sake! Oh, now, why don't you suck on some ice? Sober you up. Come on. Don't pull me or Ill call the cop! I know. I'm drunk. But my brain's okay! There's ice. Nobody saw me in that bar. Will you quit worryin'? Sandy told me what's eatin' you. I- I once saw a movie like that. All about revenge. Ex-Con's revenge. Very touching. Close to home, huh? Only he was smart. Not like you. You're not smart. You know why you're not smart, Tolly? 'Cause the day's gonna come when you want out. And the only way you're gonna get off their payroll Is on a nice, big, cold Marble slab. You know how I know? 'Cause I got one waitin' for me. Yeah. You think Gus was gonna polish me off Just 'cause I didn't pick up that package? Uh uh. No. I know too much. I know names and things. Like for instance, I saw... I saw Mr. Smith kill a dame. She was a hustler. Who was the broad? You know, Tolly? I saw too much. And that old Gus, he would've killed me. If it hadn't been for you. Sandy told me all about your old man. How he was a nothin', A real nothin'. But to you... he was like a god. You must have An awful lot of love in you. Isn't there a story about a guy, All alone, in the desert, for years and years. And then he meets an ocean. I sure like the way you kiss. What is the name of that broad? What broad? Broad that Smith got rid of. Huh? The broad that Smith got rid of. Oh, brother. I really ran off at the mouth, didn't I? Your story's on the level, wasn't it? Yeah, yeah, it was. There's a federal man named Driscoll. So? So he'll get rid of Mr. Smith for good. Is he one of the wheels who killed your old man? That's right. And you want me to walk the plank, So you can even the score? Mr. Driscoll will protect you like you was his own mother. If Im gonna have my head blown off, It's not gonna be because you're on a revenge kick. The last few years... seemed like somebody else was workin' the house. Like it was another person. Not me. Oh! I sure... I sure like the way you kiss. What was the name of that broad again? He's got a wife and another child. Their lives won't be worth two cents If Connors finds them. Everybody on the police force Trying to locate the Menken family. If only he'd try to contact us. He evidently has no idea That they'd be safer with us than wherever they're hiding. With the murder of that child, It's gonna be impossible for any of our leads to testify now. Yeah? ILet me talk to Driscoll. This is Driscoll. IOh, Mr. Driscoll, this is Tolly Devlin. Who? ITolly Devlin. Tolly who? ITolly Devlin. Don't you remember me? No. IMy old man was beaten to death IIn the alley behind Sandys gin mill about 20 years ago.

I want every syndicate On the lookout for that girl. What about those lawyers on Driscoll's staff? Maybe we can reach one. You know, make a deal. You can't trust any of them.

I want your kids. What? We could quit our way of turnin' a buck. I want your kids, Tolly. I want you for my... my husband. You must be on the needle. Marry you? Marry you? No woman can tell the whole truth About herself to a man, but that broad did! What is this with marriage and kids? Are you kiddin'? With her? Aw, c'mon... why don't you take a good look at yourself. Sandy, don't start. What do you see? A doctor? A scientist? A businessman? You see a scarfaced ex-Con. A two-Bit safecracker. A petty thief who don't know When he really made the big time. Where do you come off to blast her? No matter what she's been, what she's done. She's a giant, and you want to know why? Well, Ill tell you. Because she sees something in you worth saving. If only one-Tenth of one percent Of all the good in her could rub off on you, You'd be a giant too. But you're a midget! In your head, in your heart, in your whole makeup. You're a midget! I never felt like this before. How do you feel? Well... some women, When they kiss, blush. Some call the cops. Some... swear, some bite, some laugh, some cry. Me... I die. Tolly, I die inside when you kiss me. Connors wants me to deliver the reports to him first, Not to let Gela know. Good. Now there's no one he can trust. Are they ready? No. The next few nights, Tell him you found nothing in my safe. What? Make him sweat. Yeah, but we ought to get Gela as soon as possible. We'll get him, we'll get him. I gotta figure out a different angle. Repeating the same frame-Up so soon Might make him suspicious. You see what I mean? Yeah. Leave it to Uncle Sam. Meeting... meeting with uh... Gela. Yeah, meeting with Gela. Confidential from Driscoll. Wednesday, 2 A.M. Meeting with Gela. Saturday, 10 P.M. Meeting with Gela. Sunday, 4 P.M. Meeting with Gela. Monday, meeting with Gela. You brought this report directly to me first, right? Yes, sir. You say your name is Tolly? That's right. Tolly Devlin, sir. Good work, Tolly. Put this back in Driscolls safe. Tell barney to tail Gela round the clock. And make sure he personally gives me An hour to hour report on Gela. Well... maybe he was too drunk to know what he was sayin'. What'd he say? I'm at the pool, right? Gela's in the pool with one of his punks. You got the picture? Gela's in the pool with one of his punks. No, he's not in the pool. He's too drunk to be in the pool, But he's at the pool. All right, Gela's at the pool. I hear him say to this punk That if he thought he could get a short sentence, He'd make a deal with you as long as nobody knew He did the singin'. Gela said that? That's what I heard him say. Call off your cannibals. I won't bruise you. Not here. Relax, Danny. Okay, Mr. Gela. What are you prowlin' around here for? I wanted you to know I... I understand your feelings. Now get outta here. I've got to be sure. When I drove past him, My lights picked up his face. It was big as life, close to my car. That guy was Driscoll, all right. Find Gus and send him here. You want me to keep on Gelas tail tonight? No. It won't be necessary. I just got your note. What's up? Phone Gela at home, right now. Tell him you got some reports out of Driscolls safe.

Good, good. Bring them right over. Take you about a half hour. I'll let you in myself. Got the reports for me? Mr. Gela... when I was a kid, I seen a messy thing. I seen four shadows on a wall kill a guy. You know, I never could rub that out of my mind. 'Cause the guy was my old man. Huh? That's right. You know, it took me 20 years To find the faces of them shadows. But I found 'em. The first guy... he conked out in a hospital asking me To forgive him. Vic Farrar. The second one... he's gettin' the chair. Smith. The third one... he got barbecued. Gunther. There's one punk left, Mr. Gela. That's you. You wrap up the package. That's Gus. I set you up for a hit. That's the only way I could even up. What's the matter? Don't you pay the light bills around here? How you doin'? You're not the only one with ideas, you know. I got ideas too. You made your point. Quittin' our way of turnin' a buck, I buy. But I don't buy it alone. I gotta have a partner. Like sandy said, the only good partnership Is between a man and a wife. What are you getting at, Tolly? Well, I want you to be my wife. And all... everything that goes with it. There's a man outside who wants to see you. His name is Tolly Devlin. He's here? He wants to see you alone.

What are you doing here? Gela's dead. Did you kill him? Naw. Who did? How do you know he's dead? He's dead. And you set him up, didn't you? What difference does it make? Mr. Driscoll, it's been a good partnership. But with Gela on ice, That wraps it up and you're on your own. Come on. Our job isn't finished yet. Mine is. Tolly, you've got a perfect pipeline to Connors. Connors? What do I care about Connors? That's your headache. Well, what are you going to do now? I'm gonna get married. I'm gonna get married, and Im gonna dump my trade. What about Connors? I'm gonna dump him too. I want to start from scratch. Me and my broad. Oh... what? Don't you think I can turn a buck the right way? Of course you can, and Ill help you get started, But right now, don't run out on me Until we get Connors. You got cops, you use 'em, all right? You can't quit him, Not while he's top butcher, and you know it. I know one thing, Im getting out of this... he'll never buy it. Tolly, you'll never be able to start from scratch Unless you help us put Connors out of the way. He'll buy it. I'll tell him Im hot, He'll tell me to get lost. Then tell your bride to wear black. Yeah? Come over here! And please, please, hurry. Yeah, right after I see Connors. Listen to me. The best time to check out is right now. He's always relaxed when he's in the pool. You gotta listen to me. Love you, doll. Tolly. What's up? Here, that's for you. I got my own. What's this for? Remember that bookkeeper Menken who bribed the police chief? Yeah. His kid was killed by a hit and run? Yeah, I read about it. I ran her down. I just found out where he's holed up. So what's the gun for? Connors wants me to break you in, See how you operate.
