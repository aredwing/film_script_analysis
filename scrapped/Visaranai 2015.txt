 

                        Hey, buddy! I'm leaving. You're leaving this early? The harvest festival is round the corner. My boss wants me to open the shop early. Your lies won't work with me. You're going to check out that girl! Shut up. You don't know about last night's problem. This is not your hometown... Watch out or you'll get beaten. I need a lift. Wait for five minutes? No, I'm running late already! Stay out of the watchman's sight. He'll ask for money. Stop! You haven't paid this week. - I'll pay you this evening. Don't forget my booze. - Sure! You stubborn Tamilian mule! Learn Telugu. You've been here for a year! Good morning! Good morning, boss! - You fool! Is this the time to open shop? You'll ruin my festival business. Don't worry, boss. Up and running in ten minutes! Don't yell at the poor boy, dear. No eating papers! I'll give you a biscuit. Boy... Give me a pack of cigarettes. Where's Brindavan Colony 3rd street? So, you're a Tamilian? What? I just... I saw the Tamil Daily... - You! Shove the newspaper inside your bag, idiot! I never meet Tamil folk here. So I got excited. Let's just say I'm from Tamil Nadu. Where is Brindavan Colony 3rd street? I don't know. Just go away! I need to start business. His pistol is jutting out. We've set out to work with such idiots. Walks around with Tamil newspaper and pistol for the world to see... Matchbox, please. Your Telugu wasn't so convincing, either... Boy... What can I get you, sir? What's your name? Sir? Your name. Pandi. What do you want? It's you we want! Get your hands off me! What are you doing? Let me go! Buddy, don't...! He's a cop. What happened? They woke me up at the park and asked if my name is Murugan. I said yes, and they just picked us up! They haven't said a thing. Get down! Down... What about my fare, sir? - Want a fare? How about I arrest you? Get going. What are you staring at? Get in, all of you! Sentry! 8 men in the lock up, now these 3. There's a boy upstairs. Totally, 12. Get them breakfast in the morning. - Okay, sir. Remove your slippers. Havildar! -Sir? Frisk them. - Okay, sir. They might be carrying something... Where was I? - The old warehouse... They surrounded the building, right? Our inspector was a sub-inspector back then. He was scared to death. - Really? Yes! I wasn't. I fought them single-handedly. You should have seen that, Sindhu! Influence is more important than skill when it comes to promotions! Havildar, come join us? No? Give one to Jai. Hold on! Give me the pink one. It's my lucky lathi. Let's get them to confess. Sir, I'll wait outside? He's running that way! Stop him. Sir... What if he dies? Good god! Kumar! Kumar! Wake up, Kumar! Kumar! Open your eyes... Kumar? Kumar! Kumar...? I asked you to stop him! Not shove a bucket at his face. He's a fine actor. Thinks we'll stop hitting him now. - Please! It hurts... SINDHU : Sir, the tea has arrived! S.I. : Give me a minute. Let's drink the tea and come back! - Fine. KUMAR : It hurts! Tell them not to hit us... Murugan... They can't reach us in there. Help me drag him. It really hurts... You're okay. Just hang in there... It hurts so bad! Why have they brought us here? Why are they hitting us? It was a great pilgrimage! Give everyone this sacrement. It's the inspector. PANDI : Is he coming this way? I got the best view of the deity! Sindhu, how went your husband's job interview? -Waiting for a response, sir. MURUGAN : He's coming this way. I'll talk to the company chief about your husband's job. - Thank you, sir. Thank the almighty. I just want us to be friends. Give them some, too! Here. Take some, son. Guys, come out! SINDHU : Here. RAO : Eat up! Go on. Sir... - Yes? They're beating us so bad, sir. Don't even know why. It hurts a lot, sir! All police- meeting, sir. All police- beating, sir. Very pain, sir. Hey, Oguru! - Yes, sir? Why are they still dressed? Undress them and beat their bottoms raw. They won't even tell us why we're getting beat up! Lock them up for now. Are you Tamilians? - Yes. Why are you in? - We don't even know! How can I close the case overnight? The A.C. should understand my situation. Am I right? I've got Tamil boys in my custody. I'll close the case. But I need to account for the stolen goods. Get me the money from your builder friend. Committed big time crime, huh? - We did nothing. It's my fault, man. You mentioned some trouble this morning. What is it? I was talking to that girl last night. The one who lives by the shop? - Yes. That girl in the car is totally... - Checking me out? Precisely why I'm not looking. That's an expensive car! Why would she check you out? You're the new boy here. Shut up and mind your job. She comes out at this time everyday to see me. When she hears the sound of my bell, she comes running out. Want to see? She ditches work to ogle at you! Her boss won't mind? Is she a housemaid here, big brother? Yeah, what did you think? I thought she lived here. Afsal, girls don't even notice homeless loafers like us. But this girl seems to trust him. She thinks she'd be happy with me. That's a great honour. She came to the shop last night... Why so serious? Keep trying. Hello? Mom? Can you hear me? Got a rupee coin? Hello! Hello? Does the phone work? It works. She looked really nervous. I thought it would comfort her if I held her hand. But she got offended and walked away. We've run away from home to make a living. You need to behave yourself. This is what happens when you mess around with girls. It wasn't like that. I closed the shop and went after her. I'm over here! She was there waiting for me, you know. I thought it would comfort you... Holding your hand. Don't mistake me. Don't cry! What's your name? My name is Pandi. I'm Shanthi... Can you find me a job? A job... A job! KUMAR : What's up? AFSAL : They're talking... PANDI : For whom? SHANTHI : For me. Your boss is not paying you? They're paying me. But... My mother is in my hometown. Sometimes when I feel like going home... They don't let me go. So... Shanthi, don't cry! Listen... We'll fix your problem, whatever it is. The boss's wife... She travels often. I end up being alone with the boss at nights. I want to get out of here. Don't feel bad! We'll fix it. I'll find you a good job. If there's some problem, just come to the provision store. You know where I work. We'll handle it. Thanks. -We can. I need to cook dinner. I must go. You should go eat, too. Bye! Take down my mobile number, just in case. I don't have the phone with me now. I'll come to the shop and get it later. Meanwhile, if there's a problem just come to Gandhi Park. We can work it out. You were chatting for so long, like you speak each others' language! She said something about being alone with her boss at nights. I saw bruises on her arm. I can understand what she's going through. She works at a cop's house. We'll get into trouble... - What trouble? Shanthi! Don't you worry! I'm here, no matter what! KUMAR : Don't shout. People are looking. PANDI : I'm here for you. KUMAR : When you were shouting on the road last night... I knew we could get into trouble. PANDI : But thank goodness... Afsal didn't get caught with us. The kid can't take all this beating. Man! Who asked you to shout? You were flirting and we're all getting beat up. Sir, open up! I need to poop. If I do my business here, the whole station would stink up. Wait for a bit. - Can't hold it in! Out! Rascal... Get out! Stinky creatures... Newbies, come here! Grab a mug and go in. Do you see puss? No. Just a bit of swelling. That's all. Don't let it get wet. Dude! Afsal! Hey, Afsal! Big brother! When did they get you? Last night... What did you do? I did nothing! Why would cops arrest you, then? On my way back from the cinema last night... Come here. - Sir? Where are you coming from? I'm coming back from a movie, sir! What's your name? Afsal, sir. Are you with Al-Quaeda? Or I.S.I.S? - No, sir. I've come from Tamil Nadu to work here. Tamil Nadu? Are you L.T.T.E. ? I am a Tamilian, sir. All Tamils are L.T.T.E.! Take him in. He might lead us to the Tamil robbers. I don't know anything! I only got here a few days ago. They hit me and asked whom I live with... I told them we stayed at Gandhi Park. In the morning...! Please! You got us screwed! I didn't mean to! Dude, this is not about your girl. We're in deep trouble. But I don't know what. So... Do you accept? He asks if we accept. Accept what? What do you want us to accept, sir? Sir, he wants to know what to accept. Sindhu... Anything to close a case. Soon, you'll learn that. Enough... Untie them. Or they'll end up with a clot. Make them run for sometime to get the blood flowing. Okay, that's enough. Stop! Enough. They are ready. Start again. What the hell do you want us to accept? Don't say anything. Just be quiet. You need to tell us what to accept! Keeps saying "accept it, accept it". Prasad, the paramedic is here. Take them to him. I'm just taking them in. Okay, let's go. Jai, the inspector wants to see you. -Watch them for me. I will. Half my tooth is stuck inside. It hurts a lot. My mum would always say my teeth are my best feature. She'd be so upset if she saw me now. Madam! You've forgotten your phone. In your situation, if I happened to find a phone, I'd call for help. I'll be back in two minutes. Boss, the cops have caught us. They're holding us at the R.K Puram station. Why did they arrest you? - No idea! They even broke Murugan's tooth! Okay, don't worry. I thought you left the shop open and disappeared! Please get us out of here! - I'll come. Pandi! Pandi! Boss? What's happened? Don't even know why they're holding us! Pandi, don't cry. I'm not. Boss... Get us out of here, boss. They broke my teeth, boss! The cops are saying strange things. I'm really scared. They say you've robbed big shots! No, boss! They say you've robbed over ten million rupees. I come to the shop at 5 in the morning and work so late! How could we rob? Tell them that and get us out of here. If you did it, just accept! You too, boss? We didn't do anything. I know. But the cops won't buy it. What are you doing there? I'll be back. Boss? Who are you? - My name is Subburaylu. Boss? They're being held for Brindavan Colony robbery. Don't leave us here! Take us with you, boss. The kid admitted to committing the crime. They probably did it. One of them has been working in my store for a year now... A good lad. I'll talk to the inspector. Buy food for everyone in the station. Eat up! You poor boys... They've hit you so bad! If you just accept, they'll stop hurting you! We didn't do anything, sir! Look at my leg... And my teeth! Poor things! Suffering in an unknown city. But he's already confessed to the crime. They beat me badly and asked me to accept... ... I couldn't stand the pain. So I told them I did it. But we really didn't do anything! The inspector won't buy that. Shall we do one thing? Let's just go to inspector... Tell him, "Sir, they caught the wrong guys" "File us under a petty case, please. And let us go" He'll do it. What say? Shall I speak to the inspector? Sir, will they stop beating us if we accept? They won't hit you at all. They'll even buy you biryani, fags, alcohol and everything! No, sir. We've run away from home due to various reasons... We've vowed to go back home only after making it big. We've got jobs here. Our reputation... This is Andhra! No one in Tamil Nadu will find out. This is not headlines material. This is a small theft case, a bit news. Sir, we could do this... I'll speak in Tamil. And you translate in Telugu! If you do as I say- I'll kill you! I took pity on you and offered to help you Tamilians... You're issuing orders now? You'll only learn the hard way. Clean it up! Clean up your mess, now. Ramesh! Be ready. I'll tell you when to block his car. Okay, sir. Start the car. Stop! Hey, stop! The cops have stopped him. Where are you coming from? - Chennai. Where do you stay here? Brindavan Colony. Do you have a photo ID? Turn around. This is too risky. We'll snatch him at the court. They picked us up. They beat us up, didn't give any reasons. They said it's a petty theft, and we should accept. They threatened our owner. They give us one square meal everyday, no matter what. So it's important to them that we eat. To make them hear us, we should stop eating. What if they let us starve to death? It's better to die fighting than get beat up to death. Why haven't you eaten yet? Sir, it's the Tamil boys. Why have you wasted food? We will not eat until you let us out. We'll see how long this lasts. Bike thieves. Come out! Your turn to go first. Quick! You're going to the courts tomorrow. Remember your lines? Sir, we only stole two bikes. They're asking us to own up for fifty two! Just do as they say. Or they'll just keep hitting till you do. They've started beating the batter at the hotel next door. Yes... I hear it, too. I hear all the way from my ears... to my belly. Then let's eat? Starving oneself is hard. Viswesvara Rao! - Sir? When will you close that case? - Another two days, sir. You idiot! Don't you know your job? If you can't do it, why the hell didn't you say so? Another two days, sir. It will be done. Sir, it's the S.P. Mic 50 to mic 10, sir. Narayana Rao. - Yes, sir? Call me on my phone. - Okay, sir. Look, man. Did I ask you to find the criminals? I only asked you to close the case. Pressure is mounting from the chief secretary's office. I'm going to tell the commissioner that you'll file the F.I.R. tomorrow. If you can't, take a sick leave. I'll get someone else to do it. Listen up, Pandi. Want get out of this place? - Yes, sir! You only have one option. Co-operate with us. Think we'll let you go if you starve yourself? If you don't co-operate, only your corpse will leave this station. Your friends have agreed. We didn't do it, sir. This Brindavan Colony case is getting complicated. Get those boys to accept soon. They just won't eat! We'd better find someone else. We've beat them up badly, one of them is very ill. We'll be exposed if they get out and talk. If we hit them any more, they could die! Stand over there... You haven't eaten in three days? Who came up with this idea? They're so determined! We can't get them to agree. Let them go. Goodbye! He's asked us to go. They shall collect money from Bhai Hotel and sign a statement that we didn't hit them. Go on! Ask the Bhai to give them 2,000 rupees. They must come back to sign. So... You starved yourself and had your way! Go on, I'll come. Maybe he's a good man afterall. Iqbal Bhai! The inspector asked you to give them 2,000 rupees. Thank you! Let's go to the station, sign, and leave for our hometown. I want to take the girl with me. Dude... I'm so hungry! Let's eat here? Two omelettes, please. These prawns... Half-boiled eggs... - I want chicken! I want the leg piece! Hello, sir. - You can sign and leave. Okay, sir. They gave you the money? - Yes, sir. We ate there. But I couldn't chew the meat, with my broken teeth! But we ate well! Want some bananas? - No, thank you. Can we sign? We're running late. - Come in. You can sign. - Thank you, sir. Have you eaten, ma'am? Yes, you? - We did! Starving yourself, huh? Strip. All of you, strip now. Couldn't bring myself to hit starving young men. So I had to make you eat. I don't have a choice. I must get you to accept. I don't enjoy this, either! I'm giving you one minute. Accept on your own accord. Or else... I will stop being so considerate. We didn't rob, sir. You, come here. How's the leg? It still hurts, sir. They've given me a tablet, sir. Get me that. There are schools and houses nearby. When I hit you, there must be no sound. If you make a sound... Hold it! Saw that? If you make sound... ... Or fall down They'll get hit. If you dont, I will only hit you. Okay? Turn around. Enough! This is MY STATION. MY WORD is final here. Got it? We did not rob, sir. Hitting us won't change the truth! Lock them up. Bring in his shop owner tonight. What have they done to you? How long will you suffer this way? Till they arrest the real robbers. They say you're the real robbers! If you accept now, they'll just file you under one case and let you go. But we didn't do it, boss! Why should we accept? Once they set their minds, they won't let you go. The other boys are willing to accept. If you co-operate, they say it will end well. It took place at some big shot's house. Almost ten million has been taken! If he doesn't close the case, the inspector might even lose his job! What can I do about that, boss? Look, boy. The burglars had tied up the lady of the house. And one of them was heard speaking in Tamil. The cops caught your friend while hunting for them. They were desperate to close the case... And they found you homeless non-natives. They always use men like you. They were confident about coercing you, they even told the press. You are refusing to co-operate. So they haven't even filed an F.I.R. yet. They're under a lot of pressure to produce you at the courts. So, just accept. But we are not robbers, sir. You're being silly! They've got money and jewellery to account as the taken goods. All they need is someone to own up to the crime. They'll take you to the courts. When the judge asks if you did it... Say "Yes, we did". Everything will get sorted in three months. You can all go back to your lives. I said we didn't steal, why are you...? You stubborn fool! Sir, I'll convince him! He refuses to understand! - I'll convince him. Pandi, I've been pretending to be a Telugu... To make a living here for thirty years now. I've invested all my savings here. They're threatening to lock me up if you refuse to accept. Please accept, son! You are making life difficult for your friends. And now your employer, too. I'm saying this as a well-wisher: The inspector will ask you if you did it. All you have to do is say "yes". No more beating, then! You can just go to prison. When you come out of the prison, I'll find you a job. Pandi, please don't get me in trouble. Uncuff them. Climb on to the ledge. Okay? Show us what you did... What? Didn't you climb this way? Do it. Come on, boys. You climbed on to this ledge, right? Isn't that what you told us? Yes, sir. - Show us; Climb. Have you recovered my jewels? They sold the jewels. But we found the money they had stashed. What are you waiting for? Show us how you unlocked the door. You entered the room. Then? Sir? There was a lady sleeping, right? What did you do to her? She was asleep. I covered her face with this sheet... I did this... and held her down. Rao? Bring the weapons Which weapon did you use? Sir? Was it this one? - Yes, sir. Who used it? Murugan did it, sir. Come here, my darling! You held the weapon? Yes, sir. What did you do with it? What did you do? Did you seal her mouth shut? Yes, sir Demonstrate it! She was asleep. I did this... Give me the keys! Who opened the locker? I did. You, again? You're the leader! Come here. Show me. Come on, leader! Give him the keys. Tomorrow, at the courts, you shall tell the judge all this. Or else... You must meet the leader, somehow! Suresh, I'm at the court... K.K : Be careful! Mr. K.K, please get down! - Who are you? Get down. Come with me, Mr. K. K! Who are you? - He is surrendering in the court. He won't be going to the courts. We'll take him. Get the bloody car soon! I'm going to surrender at the court. They just grabbed me! Wait, let me explain! I'm a cop! I'M A COP, too! Yes, Muthuvel. K.K. has surrendered at the court, sir. You spent a whole week in Guntur just to tell me this? Shame on you! If you could pull some strings, we can still do it. The D.S.P. here is your batchmate from traning academy. If you could put in a word to him - I'll call you back. Accused from Ramakrishna Puram Police Station! That's us. - Come on. Get up. Up! Lift your collar up. Hide your bruise. AFSAL : Inspector will get us a job? CONSTABLE : Inspector is a nice man! MURUGAN: We'll be released in two months? CONSTABLE: You will. You're really helping the inspector now. Just go to prison. He'll remember the favour. Do you accept to the robbery? You're remanded for fifteen days. Sir! We did nothing! They keep hitting us and ask us to accept! We don't even know... RAO : You can't speak in the court! Get lost, you...! If I can't speak even here, where can I? I'm speaking the truth. I work at a grocery store. He works at a butcher shop and he's a painter... We came here to earn an honest living. We don't know anything. They are threatening us. We didn't hit them! They said they did it. Don't believe him, sir! Son, tell the judge. Did we hit you? Did we hit? This is our last chance. Let's speak up, fools! He's mentally unstable. See for yourself, what they've done to us... Show him the bruises. TELL HIM THE TRUTH. It's true, sir. They even broke my teeth, sir. They've beat us so badly. You don't speak Telugu? Sir, I can understand but can't speak. Does anyone here speak Tamil? I can speak Tamil, sir. Think I'd trust you to translate right? A group of officers from Tamil Nadu Police Department... ...Have come to take custody of an accused. He's an absconding accused, with a non-bailable warrant against him. We've come on duty as a special team to arrest him. My client came here to surrender at the court. They tried to kidnap him inside court premises. - No, your honour! We tried to arrest him outside the court premises. ... Tamil Nadu police... - Okay! First court magistrate needs the Tamil speaking cops. A magistrate wants your help. Go there. Madam. This is a matter of national security. He had absconded for three months. Madam, going with them would pose great danger to my life! I'm remanding him. Take custody of him through courts. Were you previously suspended for filing false charges? But that case was different... Were you suspended or not? Looks like a waste of our money... - I think it's the D.C. Hello? - Muthuvel, I spoke to him. He's agreed. But they can only bring K.K. outside the court building. You must take it from there. Done, sir. I just want to know what these boys are saying. Can you translate to Telugu? I can translate to English, your honour. Go ahead. What's the matter? I work at that grocery store! You came to buy cigarettes, I mistook you. They say we're thieves and hitting us. We don't speak Telugu. Some robber spoke in Tamil... They're telling us to own up to it. MUTHUVEL : I'll explain everything to the judge. RAO : Cop to cop, please help me out. They were not given a chance to speak, your honour. They were forced not to speak in front of you and just accept the crime. This is what every accused says. - No, your honour. I know one of these boys. I've seen that boy working in a provisional store. I can vouch for him. - You may go. What's all this? Sir, we all know Tamilians always back each other. We've recovered the stolen goods. Please think about it.... Telling a magistrate how to think? Come, stand here. - Sir? Come here. I said, come here! Face that way. You must stand there till the session ends. Son, you're not remanded. All of you, go home. Constable, tell them what I said. Send in the next case! Sir, we've recovered the goods- - Shut up. You heard the judge. Leave my client alone. Pandi... Take this money. Go straight home. It's not safe here for you. Take this. Sir, his lawyers are tailing us. They haven't left our side. - So what? If you can't go near him, use someone else. Okay, sir. That girl came to the shop looking for you. What did she say? She said she's leaving town and wanted to talk to you. She's given her mobile number. Can I borrow your pen? Tell me, boss. 9-8.... Okay, boss! Boy... Come here. Will you do me a favour? If not for you, we would have been branded as robbers. We'll do anything you say. You're here for remand? Yes. Let's go! Please go with him. But my lawyer said "evening"... No, sir. We're taking you now. He's a Court Orderly Policeman. You can go with him. What's this? Please get in, sir. It's for your safety. Grab him, NOW! INTERMISSION Did he co-operate? - Yes, sir. Get down. K.K., come with me... Let's sit comfortably. Her number is switched off but the I.V.R is in Tamil. So, she must be in Tamil Nadu. Lock the door. Send her a text? I've already sent one. Shall we eat here? No, I'll get dropped at my village. I feel this is a mistake, sir. We kidnapped K.K. when he tried to surrender at the court.... No, we didn't. - Even if it's off the books, easy to guess. When media gets wind of this issue, government will walk away We'll be the scapegoats. The leader of the opposition party called me regarding K.K.. K.K. is his auditor. Leader will help his loyalists after winning the election. Personally, he's taken good care of me. He's a very generous guy. I know about your loyalty to him. Sir, his transactions are neat. If you agree, your name won't be involved. Rathnam... I'm getting paid to work for the ruling government. You may go now. Spoke to him? He doesn't get it. Elections are round the corner... We know the opposition will win. Ask him to choose his loyalty wisely. Sir! Sir! Inspector Muthuvel asked me to prep for enquiry. He's bringing K.K here. He surrendered at the court. How did they get him? They found a group of Tamil boys to help them out... Sir, if you could pull over, I'll get dropped at this junction. Goodbye! Get home and call me. - Okay, big brother Take care! Call us when you reach home. I'll get a new phone and call you! Where's the other guy? He got dropped on the way. Get home safe! And don't breathe a word about K.K.. Understand? - Okay, sir. You slept well? Looking fresh! The A.C. has been trying to reach you. Don't mistake me for saying this. We must accommodate him- Just focus on your duty. Stop sucking up to that A.C.! Or you won't get anywhere! Oh! Off you go! Don't try to save money by sleeping in public parks anymore. Rent a place. With the rising crime rate... You boys look like a bunch of thugs. With faces scarred and broken teeth... They can file you under any case! So long, sir! Can you tell that my teeth are missing? Sir? The A.C. wanted the station cleaned before harvest festival. We couldn't find anyone for hire. Shall we make them work? Will you clean up the station before leaving? Sit down, sir. Are you ready to talk? Not going home on a festival day? Won't your family mind? They do. But work is important, too. That's precisely why... ...I never got married. But you make up for that with three girlfriends! Threesomes and foursomes, huh? What do you do? You know about my girlfriends... But not my profession? Hard to believe, Mr. Muthuvel. Call me Muthu. You're older and greater than I! You've got me locked up here. You're the big guy here. Not at all... I'm just an inspector of police... Not you, I meant the system you represent. The system is the most powerful thing. We're all but pawns. A game has begun now. I know why this game is happening. You can't get to him through me. Give it a try. Sir... You were harsh yesterday, so I thought I can never pursue this. Thanks for setting up this meeting. There's nothing wrong in having a chat. Of course, we can't talk about these things at the office. That's why I wanted to meet them here. All said and done, they are a part of the system. That's Rohan, sir. Okay, you may leave. Sir, let me introduce you! Will they recogonise me? - Yes, sir. I'll take it from here. You needn't talk about this anymore. Okay, sir. Hi, Rohan. This is Frank. Hi, Frank. Have you briefed him? - I've explained everything. You needn't worry about anything. Go meet him. So... You're an auditor by profession... Hand me that pillow? My back feels stiff. Thank you. You're used to finer living, right? Want to lie down? You look tired. You lie down. - Thanks. You have the rich and powerful as your clients. Politicians, busninessmen, movie stars. Am I right? Yes. You're Actress Sundari's auditor? I'm a big fan. Did she undergo some surgery recently? Looks much firmer now... Her nose, sir. Tell me, K.K.. You are richer than your more established auditor colleagues. How? See... Money is something that will not be there with everybody. We must have wondered at some point... "Where's all the money I earned?" Am I right? That's the story of my life. When you have money, you feel this quiet, inexplicable guilt... Yes, sir. You? Yes. All the religions in the world have taught us that money is evil. Especially in a country like ours, where the majority are poverty stricken... A rich man tends to look like a culprit. Not just to the people, he feels that way about himself! When that feeling becomes unbearable, he chooses to lose his money. A man who doesn't feel guilty for his money, who respects the fruit of his labour... Who doesn't feel ashamed, but understands that it's a token of appreciation... will be rich. One must never hide his wealth in guilt. One must celebrate wealth! How? Like the parties you throw? I need acid to clean this toilet... We don't have it here. I'll get it this evening. MUTHUVEL: So, you're helping them? Yes, I do help my friends. Getting two "friends" to meet... And paying a commission to one of the "friends"... Investing that money in a foreign country... Getting licenses to foreign companies here.... Investing that money in a Swiss Bank. Favours like these, right? You've got a few things wrong about me. Some of the things were right. But this is wrong. Correct us, then. What is your job? You said so yourself. I'm an auditor. Back at square one! Okay, Mr. K.K.! You must be worn out from the travel. Get some sleep. Let's go, Ramesh. Even police stations are better in our hometown! Everyone is so nice. Yes! - This building, the cops, everything is great! Right, Afsal? Oh, brother! You give lengthy lectures during enquiry... But you get so startled when you are worken up from sleep! Are you that scared? When you have a lot of money... It must be scary, right? Freshen up now. I'm in the mood to talk. No, thanks! We paid for it. Eat up! On February the 26th... A deal was made between your leader and an international company... The transaction... - Are you both drunk? Yes. I have a problem talking to drunkards. We'll talk when the alcohol is flushed out of your system. Okay? Meanwhile, I'd like a fresh set of clothes. D.C. asked us to catch this guy, at any cost. But the A.C. wants him freed! I don't get it. Ramesh... The outcome of the next election depends entirely on whether or not K.K. talks. The opposition leader made a huge chunk in his term as the chief minister! We all know he made a commission of 200 million! K.K. has invested all that money for him. If he talks... The leader will be locked away for his lifetime. Which is what the government wants! That's why the D.C. has been posted here. Through the A.C., the opposition is trying to prevent him from talking. From my experience, I think Muthuvel needs to watch out. They'll destroy everyone involved in his kidnap. Muthuvel! - Sir? Did he talk? No, sir. In that case... bash him up. His men dropped by... They're scared that he'll jeopardise their chances at the election. I told them he's ratted out the leader. And they panicked! Agreed to pay us 30 million to drop the issue. Hit him, make him talk. Make all the necessary arrests We can get some serious money here. Ramesh! - Sir? Something has come up. Everybody, get out of here. Tell them to leave. Wait till D.C. has left... RAMESH : Officers are in a meeting. You can clean up later. PANDI : I left the cleaning acid downstairs... RAMESH : Let it be. Not now. Mr. K.K., I'm giving you two minutes. Answer all my questions, to avoid humiliatiion. Muthu, I'll give you a good deal. I'll give you more money than- Trying to buy me! When I ask you a question, I want an answer! I'll kill you! Come here! Get him talking in 10 minutes. Do whatever it takes. You'd better co-operate. Won't talk to drunkards, huh? Muthu... Get up. Get me some water! Go on! Pick up your clothes. Go on. This is a mistake- I told you to crawl. Don't get up. Go. Sit over there! Chain him! Murugan... What have we done? We must help him. Let it go, man. We're only here to clean the station. We'll do just that. Buddy... I think we've made a mistake. Why should we feel guilty? He must be a fraud. With or without our help, the cops would have done this. Now the cops are friendly with us. They'll help us in times of need, right? It's our fault he's here. What's all that? - Need to clean this bathroom, sir. Okay, make it quick. Sir! Inspector sent you to spy on me? No, sir! Someone once gave me her phone when we were locked up. I don't know what else to do. Sorry, sir. Who is this? What's going on, Suresh? Have you spoken to the leader? Sir, I couldn't meet him. But I spoke to his secretary, Rohan. Fixed a price with D.C.? Sir, we're talking. But he's expecting too much... They're still negotiating. Hello? Hello! Sir, can you hear me? How much do they want? - Leader has agreed to pay 30 million. But... But what? D.C. says you're talking. And you're ratting out names... He's obviously lying to raise the price. Think they can make ME talk? Anyway, talk this out and seal the deal as soon as possible. I can shell up to 50 million. Will do, sir. But one small suggestion... What? It's safer for you to stay in police custody now. I don't understand. There are talks that... They will get you out and then force you to commit suicide. Sir? Hello? Hello? Okay. Do you have Muthuvel's number? No, sir. But I can get it. It's written on the board downstairs. No. You call him up. Tell him I'm ready to talk. Did Ramachandran speak to him? - I don't know. He said he'll talk if you guarantee his safety. Pass the phone to him. - He wants to speak to you in person. I'll be there in half hour. Call me if necessary. - Okay, sir. When did the D.C. come here? Why wasn't I informed about it? Unchain him. This was so embarrassing... How is your family- Rathnaswamy! Who are they? - Chain snatchers... Let them go. - We've recovered the goods. Let them go. We'll find someone else. You made a mistake, K.K.. You shouldn't have talked. But what...? I didn't talk... Something is terribly wrong... Let's leave? D.C. says you spoke to Muthuvel about the February deal. Kneel! The leader trusted you, let you handle the funds. You've betrayed them. Tie him up. Sir, to hit is one thing. Tying him up is a little extreme... Just follow my instructions. If he talks, there will be much trouble. He's been so kind to our station... - I don't enjoy this, either. He got my daughter admitted into med school. But this needs to be done. I had to make sure he won't talk to anyone. Where to? - We want to leave for our hometown. But you haven't finished the work. Get in! We're leaving, sir. You're not done cleaning the toilets. Finish your work! A.C. has let the accused out. Should I scrub the toilets now? Oh, no! K.K.! It hurts. Please get me down soon, if you can. Ramesh! Who did this? Ask him to come here! - It was S.I. Shoban. Ramesh! Ramesh! Hurry upstairs! What, sir? - Come upstairs, man! K.K.! K.K.! K.K.! What the hell have you done? Untie him! Let him down. Who gave you orders? Who gave you orders? I'm the inspector. You report to me. It was the A.C.! - Get in there. Unfasten him! Get the jeep ready. Must take him to the hospital. It was the A.C.'s orders... This is my case. Not his! Do as I say. Get out of my department! Steady! Careful... They've used you to finish me. This is the first move of this game. Now you're a loose end. They'll eliminate you next. That will be the last move of the game. You'll be okay. We're taking you to the hospital. A.C. is on the call... You do this everytime. Is he on the line? Yes, sir. Sir? Are you taking him to the hospital? Yes, sir. Need to take him immediately. Don't you know your job? How could you take an unnaccounted accused to hospital? But we can't just let him die. He's got low B.P. Let him die. What do you care? How can you barge into my station and enquire my accused without my permission? You can't tell me what to do. You're to follow my orders Don't take him- I WILL take him to the hospital. The D.C. forbids you - I'm taking him. It's my job at stake now. I'll handle the D.C.! I'll keep you out of this. - He's here next to me. Talk to him. What? It's over, sir. Hello, Muthuvel? I can't hear him... Hello. Muthuvel? Are you happy now? Who is it? Muthuvel, you hung up? The A.C. came here and... Now is not the time for this. We'll all be in trouble if this gets out. Need to dispose the body first. Chandran from I-2 will be there in two hours. He's a pro. Follow his instructions. I'll come there after you move the body out of the station. Straighten the elbows, Ramesh. Don't mess up his shirt! Don't take his wallet. I only took the cigarette. Sir. The D.C. sent me Are you well? - Yes, sir. Tell me. D.C. says K.K. is a bachelor, so we can hang him at his house. Have you informed the local inspector? - The D.C. has spoken to him. We're hanging the body because the D.C. said to. But this won't look like a suicide. The mouth is shut and body is not twisted. He has urinated and defacated. If we'd planned this better... This wasn't our plan. When it's a sensitive issue, such errors must be avoided. Right? - Our job is to follow the orders. Let's just do that. - True. Charles, grab that chair. Don't just stand there! When willyou ever learn? Ramesh... Get on the chair and tie it up! I'll take his shoes off? - Yes, take them off. Charles, leave a chair under the body. What about the finger prints? No time to wipe it out now. Local inspector filling crime scene report is our guy. The doctor performing post-mortem, too... I said he's ratting their names... Giving information. To scare them into paying more. They were scared hat K.K. had talked. That's the problem. So they asked me to verify your claims. This guy was careless and K.K. ended up dead! All this was a result of your claim... Don't change the issue! Is it done? -Yes, sir No complications? Unlike you, he can take orders. He does a clean job. But they offered us thirty million! Now it's ruined... Have you told them that he's dead? - No, sir. We wanted to inform you first. You should have informed me before you tied him up. This serves no purpose. - But it could. We could use it to our advantage. They're under the impression that he's still in our custody. Let's get 30 million in the morning, and tell them we've sent him home. If he chooses to kill himself, how could they hold us responsible? The government's plan was to arrest the leader of opposition party. Sir, K.K. has mentioned his partner... Yes, sir. Then the issue is sorted, guys. Let Muthuvel's team arrest K.K.'s partner. - Okay, sir. With that arrest, we can cover up K.K.'s death. But the the Intel officer in our station? I'll speak to his inspector and keep him quiet. He belongs to our caste. Okay! Can give him a cut, too. Ask public relations to give "envelopes" to all the media... Get them to slander K.K.. Who are you? We were asked to clean the station, sir. What are you doing here? Head constable asked us to clean... Were you eavesdropping on us? We just got here, sir. Do it later. You can clean later. Go! Careful! Is Murugan downstairs? - Yes... Are we in trouble? Pandi, were you here the whole time? Head constable asked me to clean the toilet... He wanted it done immediately because the D.C. is here. Come with me. Call yourself a Head Constable? Letting these boys in at a time like this. Ramachandran! Sir? Dumb...! Where are you taking them? I'm taking them in... We're talking here! Take them downstairs. Okay, sir. - Shut the bloody door! Come, let's go downstairs. Everything's okay. Don't worry. I'm scared. What's going on here? Pandi, you can't come up when the officers are in the meeting. You should know better. When did you get here? AFSAL : 5 minutes back. PANDI : Just now. You say "now" but he says "5 minutes back". He's scared! We just got here. - Really? If you didn't hear anything, no reason to be scared. Okay, clean this bathroom now. Do the one upstairs later. Go... Give me the keys. Here! Sit here... You can continue upstairs after the officers leave... They don't like it when it's noisy! Murugan! - Sir? What's wrong? It's nothing! Sit down... MURUGAN : What's wrong? So start cleaning this bathroom. Even police stations aren't safe from robbers! So I have to lock up. Clean it up quickly. I've made them sit downstairs. When did they get here? Not sure, Ramesh. One guy says "5 minutes back". And the other says "just now". I'm sure they've heard everything. Yes, sir. That's why they aren't able to corraborate. We just got there! He entered suddenly... And asked if we eavesdropped. I'm confused. Mr. K.K. wasn't there. I don't know... - Sounds like trouble! Sir, that doesn't matter. The boys have heard us talk. Let's think of ways to silence them. Sir! They couldn't have heard anything. It's not a big deal to shut them up anyway! Sit down. Everybody sit. If we threaten them to not breathe a word... They'll just quietly go home. Muthuvel, are you trying to double-cross me? I don't understand. Gathering information for the Intel Dept. using these boys? Sir? This is not a regular lock-up death that we can brush aside. Government is directly involved in this case. If word gets out that we've double-crossed both the parties... They'll hang us like we did K.K.. Sir, we have three cases pending in the station. Can we use these boys...? The A.C. released two chain-snatchers today. We've recovered the goods... We'll use these boys for that case? These boys? They spoke volumes to a judge who didn't even speak our language. Take them to the courts here, they'll get us all locked up. Sir, we should let them go. The inspector spoke for us at the court and saved us. He asked us to work here. He'll make sure nothing bad happens to us. Shall we let them out, and get "Sketch" Kumar to finish them off? Get out of here. Just go! Very well, sir. Sir. Shall we run over them in the highway? You can't do such a thing, Ramesh! That's wrong. A sin! Humans are the most responsible lifeform. Just like every birth has a purpose, so should every death. When a life departs, it leaves a void in this world. That void can never be filled by another. That death should have a significance. Sir, the A.T.M. break-in is pending. - Ramachandran... When was your last promotion? It's been 16 years, sir. There are blackmarks against your record, right? - Yes, sir. We'll make that go away. - Okay, sir. Why do such things happen to us? We haven't wronged anybody. Nothing will happen to us. Come here! No, sir. This won't work. It will, sir. I'll get it done, sir. It will work out. Sir, everything is falling in place now... Don't say- What are you talking about, man? Muthuvel! Why are you getting worked up? Compose yourself. K.K. has been murdered: In your station, under your custody. You've disposed of his body. K.K.'s men will protest and go to the courts asking for a review... The case might be taken over by the CB-CID. You'll be the accused number-1 if that happens. Minimum of eight years jail time Neither Rathnam nor I were directly involved in this case. We didn't call you from our registered numbers. You need to choose to protect yourself. They trusted me, sir! Your native? Paramakudi, sir. What's your name? - Pandi. Your father's name? - Ravi. What's your name? - Murugan. From? - Tuticorin. The D.I.G. list will be announced in ten days. My name is second on the list. If they talk about what we did to K.K., all our careers are gone! All our efforts will be in vain. They need to be silenced. At any cost. Okay, sir. You have made up your minds. Leave me out of it. Muthuvel! You kidnapped K.K. from Guntur court. Enquired him off the books. He died in lock-up under your supervision. You've tampered with murder evidence and staged a suicide. If you refuse to co-operate, I can arrest you right away. Sit. Bloody quota candidates, you just don't get it. Co-operate now. I will protect all of you. Open the Bell of Arms. Sir, we didn't hear anything - Okay, just wait. Have you eaten dinner? We'll talk later. And one for Inspector Muthuvel. Afsal, get the broom and buckets. Sir, I'm telling you the truth! I didn't hear- Let's finish this work, then we can talk. Where are we...? - I'll tell you! Let's go now. The A.C. has an old house. He wants it cleaned for the harvest festival. So he's asked you to clean it. If you do a neat job, he'll be pleased. Inspector Muthuvel will be coming with us, too. After cleaning, he will speak to the D.C. and you'll be off the hook! Let's talk to him before we go there? - Stop pestering me, boy! We've got work to do now. We'll talk to inspector later. Murugan, you may sit in the front. Go on! Pandi, sit with me in the back. Or you'll keep pestering the inspector. Slide in... Sir, have we cleaned the station well? - Yes. If we'd had more time, we would have done a better job! Right? We could also clean your house, sir. After cleaning this place, we shall clean your house tomorrow. We'll take turns and clean all the officers' houses within a week and then go home! Right? You've got a phone! We didn't know! Who is it? - It's an important call. Shanthi... Is she a friend? It's an important call. - You can talk later. I had no time to plan, sir. I'm just setting it up with everyone. The cash? - It's ready. Okay. Two "toys" and three handcuffs. - Lead the way. Okay, sir. Let me speak to the local inspector and town chief, sir. Sir? They say you're going to kill us. You wouldn't do that, would you? No, boy. Afsal! What kind of talk is this? Is this the way to talk to an officer? Your speech should befit your age, son. Come, son. Let's get to work. Ramesh... Be alert. Come here, boy... Is everything ready? - Yes, sir. Start with the bedroom. Brother... Why is there so much money here? They're giving us all this money to cover up something. Could that be? I don't know. We'll finish the job in 45 minutes. You can inform the control room then. Ensure that the residents don't face any trouble. We're working for the public's safety. They've robbed three A.T.M.s in ten days. They're a threat to the society. We're doing this at the cost of our reputation! No matter how much they offer, we shall refuse! They've brought us here for something else. No way... Brother... That's our bag.... Those are our clothes! They've set this place like we live here! No! The inspector promised us... Wait. I'll ask him. Sir, they say- What the hell have you done? You fool! Who asked you to fire? He was trying to run away. What was I supposed to do? Oh god! Afsal... Buddy... What have you done, sir? Where the hell is Chandran? Hello. Chandran! Sir! Please go inside. This is a police operation. Don't come out! It's for your own safety. Turn the lights off. Sir, I asked you to wait till it's all set. MUTHUVEL : The pistol is jammed. MURUGAN : Dude, he's alive! CHANDRAN : You know the station pistols never work. PANDI : He's alive! CHANDRAN: Those are just to make up numbers. You should use the "toys" I brought! MUTHUVEL: Just come here, quick. He's alive, sir! He's alive, sir... We need to take him to the hospital. Save him.... Afsal, you'll be okay! Come soon, man What was that noise, sir? Mind your own business. Don't want to get home safe? Go on! Just hang in there, Afsal. We'll take you to the hospital! Sir, please let's take him to the hospital? We can save him, sir! Can we take him to hospital? Please? PANDI : Please say "yes", sir. AFSAL : You said we did nothing wrong. So we'd be safe. Why has this happened? You'll be okay, man! We could have gone to the prison. At least we would have lived. Right? Let's rush him to the hospital, sir. Please? It's in your hands! Please, sir! I beg you, sir. He's just a kid! Let's take him to the hospital. Ramesh, pull him back. RAMESH : Let go of him, Pandi. What is this? Didn't even cuff him? I gave you clear instructions! Unlike you, I don't do this full-time. Do your job. You'll be okay, Afsal. We'll take you to the hospital. AFSAL : Just run away. Or they'll shoot you, too! CHANDRAN : Give me the handcuff. You're going to let him die? Flee! PANDI : I'm here with you. So is Murugan. You'll be okay. CHANDRAN : Such an easy job. And you've made it so complicated. Boy... Give me your arm, Pandi. Run, big brother! Don't worry, it'll be over in a jiffy! AFSAL : They're going to kill you, too! PANDI : The hospital... First, put on this cuff. We'll take him to the hospital then. Run, brother. Run... Run! Run! There! It's done... Run before they shoot you. RUN! Get them! Shoban, stop them! Don't shoot! Our guy is out there. Give me a pistol, Ramesh. Stop! You can't escape. You asked me to kidnap K.K.; I did! You asked me to interrogate; I did! You asked me to hit him; I did! You killed him and sent me to hang him; I did! I'll do this, too. We'll get caught, someday. My time will come. You'll have to answer then. Find them! I dislocated my knee, sir! Buzz off. Chandran, hand him the torchlight. Go look for them. Where's the other torchlight? Shoban, come get this torchlight. You can't get away. Just surrender. Pandi! Sir, I'll climb on to the terrace. You can't hide in there for long. You'll be spared if you surrender. Or we'll burn this place down, if we must. Shoban, turn to your left. Don't just stand there! Go, quick! - Okay, sir. Give me that! I can't see them here! I will run this way. Let them come after me. After a while, you run the other way. No, man. Let's stick together. We need to tell the world what happened here. For which, at least one of us should live. Okay. We'll be okay, buddy. We'll both live. We are going to be fine! Shoban, one of them is moving. - Where? Right before you... I can't see him. He's gone past you, you idiot. Sir, get ready. Pandi, stop! Don't run. Go, get hold of him. MUTHUVEL: Don't shoot him. Okay, sir. Sir, if he crosses the sewer, he'll reach the highway. Then he'll get away. Stop him here! If he leaves this place alive... We are dead men. Stop! Sir, he's running with my pistol! Get him. - He's got my pistol! Stop running. Pandi! Trust me! Come out... We did trust you. But you did nothing! He was just a kid... He believed that you'd protect us. He's been killed! I didn't do it... But you let them. Murugan! Stop. Don't complicate this further. Come out! Oh no! Murugan... I had a clear aim, too... But you came in the way! Ramesh. It was an easy job. You made it so difficult. Sir? Two down, sir. Yes, sir. No, he's not near me. Okay sir. I'll do it. I'll call you, sir. Shove this aside. Hold on to this, I'll do it. Let's inform Inspector Muthuvel? No. I'll handle it. All done? Two down. One more to go. Shall I inform the control room? Not yet, sir. A new task has come up. Just wait till it's all done. Even now, you're holding a gun in your hand. I don't have a gun now. Come out. Come! Come out... Pandi... I won't hurt you. Come out, Pandi. Let me save you, at least! Don't be scared. I'll take you to the media. You can tell them everything. We'll handle it, together! Come on. Take your hands off the gun! Shoot me. Shoot me and run. Shoot. Shoot me! Should I kill to live, sir? I don't want to. You made us stay back and clean the station. Why did you betray us? I didn't do it... Even now, you lied about the gun. It was for my safety! Not to hurt you... Give it to me. Give me the gun It's not for you... Don't try to stop me. Please let me go. I'll drop the gun. You drop it, too. Let me go. You drop it first, Pandi. I will, too. - Don't make me shoot, please. I won't shoot you! Drop the gun. Sir, Chandran here. Yes, tell me. Done with both tasks. Shall I inform the press? Yes. Tell them to focus on Inspector Muthuvel's death during the pursuit of the A.T.M. burglars. No one should sympathise with those boys. That's easy, sir. We will publish his wedding pictures on one column... And his wife and child in the funeral on the other column. Everyone shall mourn Inspector Muthuvel. We'll cover his mourning family in the T.V channels... And organise debates on safety of policemen. Can I do that? Do that. - Okay, sir. I'll call you when something comes up. - Great, sir.
