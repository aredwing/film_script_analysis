Why the fuck did you give him the ball? Foul, you fuck! Why the fuck you fumble here? Why him! Give me the ball! Give it to me! You moron! Why shoot, when you can't? You fucking listen to me! Stop it, okay! The time is up. THE CLASS based on real stories ARE YOU A FREAK? Day One So, Joosep, you are our best player? You can alone win the game! Did you shoot for the first time in your life? Don't put your shirt on. We want to see your muscles. Hey, asshole, we are talking to you! You are not going to take a shower? You're gonna stink in the class! Look at me, when l'm talking to you! What do you want? - No shower, basketball star? You fucking fag... What did you say? Who are you calling a fag? Who is a fag? If you are so straight, why are you there with a guy? Let's take his clothes off and get him to the girls! Help me with the door! - Ladies man, don't be shy! Open the door! God...! Open it! Joosep is screwing already! Do you hear me? Open the door! Are you a freak or something? Let him out! Being really cool, ah? Are you a freak or what? You idiots! Why the fuck did you let Joosep out? It was enough. - Bullshit! A guy who calls me a fag, won't come out until I say so! Then you should be at the door. - You have a problem? Oh no, everything is just great. This fucking guy is getting really cheeky. You won't look for it? - Stop it... So, what is it with you and Roland? What did he say? - We won't talk about it. Who else did you invite? I don't know... I told Paul that everyone could come. Having a party again? - Yeah. Paul didn't tell you? No, he didn't. Okay, then... Shall we get some booze? - Yeah, of course. Let's go straight to the store, then. Come on. Thea, wait! What? - I need to talk to you. Okay... - Let's go somewhere else. Well? I was thinking... Are you mad at me? You guys are so cool... Why did you bring this freak to our dressing room? And you must be the tough guy, holding the door... Thanks! Thea, are you coming? - Yeah, one moment. Well, l'm off. Is it Joosep? - Yeah. Joosep! Wanna come to the shooting range? I can't. - Stop it! Let him study! One militarist in this family is enough! At least I'm trying. The competition is next month. - I have so much work to do. Joosep... Can you lend me 500? What are you doing here? A homepage to some kennel club. But no dogs? - I'll add them later. And they are paying you nicely? Right... How's school? Everything alright? Okay... Hi, Riina! Can we get laid? - I don't know... Others are not here, yet? - No. Thea is in the kitchen and I am here. Who else do you need? See, Toomas has this problem... If there are two women and four men, he starts drinking. What have we here... - Don't take anything from there. Don't worry, we brought the booze. One sip, no one will notice. My dad will see at once. - Okay... My god, you freak! You startled me! Did you get the new Deftones' record? - Yeah. Show it to me. - Wanna hear? Well... Hello! - Hi. What do you want for dinner? - Don't want anything, now. Have you eaten today? Wait... Are you ill? - I really don't want anything. Did something happen in school? Grandma, it is not like you think. But what is it? Tell me. Well... We had a quarrel with Thea. Kaspar... Maybe this Thea is not a right girl for you? But maybe you are too old to understand anything? Just shut up! Kaspar... Do you know that you insulted me? Yeah, l'm sorry, grandma. - Now what? I'm off. Thea invited me to a party! By the way... She is the right girl for me. Kaspar, wait... Have a nice evening. You too. I don't know, when l'll be back. Hi! What took you so long? Everybody is here already. Hi. I only heard just now. Can't you dance after your own rapping? - But I can! Yo, man, tell you bird, that trance is really crap. To be honest... It really is. Or what? If the man said, it must be. No point in this talk. In my place we listen to my records. Or Paul's. Snoop Dogg at least has some point in his lyrics. You say that you understand Snoop Dogg's rapping? - Yeah... But the blacks in America have really their own language, they themselves don't understand it. So, rap or trance - you don't understand shit. So you can just shut up about DJ Tiesto. Stand here, near the wall! I liked how you said it. I'm sorry, I had a really bad day. I didn't want to fight with you. But you didn't, actually. Thea! But you promised to rub my back tonight! Get out of here... - I'm really in pain! Well done, man... Kaspar! Why did you protect this nerd today? What? I didn't protect anybody. Then why did you let Joosep out? It doesn't matter, let's go. Here is the man who protects our shitbag! Stop it! - The smell can stick to you too! I didn't protect anybody. - If Anders says, then you did. If Anders says... And what if I protected him? Get it, man... Nobody in our class protects Joosep. Oh, right... You must know. You're the boss. You have problem with something? Stop it, boys! - Fuck, you don't like it? Get out! You fuck! Don't think that it's over! Get out! - Fuck off! Out! GET YOUR ASS KICKED EVERY DAY Day Two Good morning! Take your seats, please. Kaspar! Sit down, please. Didn't feel like sitting in the back. I don't see very well from there. - Get binoculars. Take your notebooks, I want to see your homework. Pass it on. - Don't just stare, pass it on! Joosep, where is your notebook? Somebody took it. Who? I don't know. It was taken here, in this classroom? Yeah. Please, whoever took it, give Joosep his notebook back. Well... We will not continue, until Joosep gets his copybook. All of you, stand up! Or should I go to the headmistress? Paul! - What did I do? Stand up! I don't know... Riina! - I didn't do anything! Stand up! And who is next? Anders? Yeah? Do I have to ask you personally? Yeah, sure, I could have a personal talk with you. Stand up, when you talk to me! Where is Joosep's copybook? - How should I know? I sit in the other end of the class, I can't see everything. Kati! - What? Stand up! And now everybody stand up! Well? Nobody sits down, until Joosep gets his copybook back. Joosep, you can take a seat. Yeah, sit. It's up to you. Anders! - I can stand here with you till nighttime. Well, Joosep, you fuck! - Oll, block his way! Joosep, if I were a boy, I would hit you in the face! But come here! - Yeah, Kati, hit him! Do you think that you are so cool? We had to stand for a whole hour because of you, get it? Why aren't you speaking now, fuckhead? What should I say? - Say that you are sorry. Did I ask you to take my copybook? Man, don't you start! You'll get your ass kicked every morning and tell the class that you are sorry! And then we'll see if we forgive you. Every morning we'll kick your ass, till we forgive you! And not a single dickhead will interfere! So... Now you all will go to the headmistress. One by one. Paul, you'll be the first. - Why me? Let's say - because you are the best student in class. You should know, what you do. Kaspar, to the headmistress. Take your seat. Go on, Kaspar. You asked for me? - Yes. Come, have a seat. How are you doing here, in our school, Kaspar? Okay. - Very good. What happened today in your math class? Somebody took Joosep's notebook. Who took it? - I don't know. Strange. Paul told a different story. What did Paul say? Where do you sit in the classroom? Next to Joosep. Now. From today, right? - Yeah. And how did you not see, who took the notebook? It seems to me that you are lying. You know that we have no obligation to keep you in this school? We could send you right back home to your parents, to Antsla. You took this notebook. - Me? Who said that? - Paul. Paul? Paul took it. - Doesn't that seem ridiculous to you? Paul is the best student in this class. Why should he need the notebook and why would he lie? Why would I need it? Why should I lie? There are rumors that you are teasing Joosep. It is a lie. I don't tease anyone. Alright. I will not investigate this thing any further. But remember what I told your grandmother: Bad grades, bad behavior - country lad as you are, you'll be out of this school. Do you understand, Kaspar? Yes. You can leave. What happened? Thea THE SNITCH DON'T EVEN APOLOGIZE? Day Three Okay, show time! You, stay here. Sorry, man! Come on in! Come on! Come in, as we agreed... What do you want? - Come in. Come on! Show him! What is going on here? Take your seats! Let's start. So, girls... Would you be able to take a disabled person like Quasimodo to be your husband, instead of an important rich man. Kerli would... - Quiet! Nobody would think of it, voluntarily. But Victor Hugo's romanticism is all about making unexpected choices. Romanticism was an era and literary movement, where people made extraordinary decisions and became great through that. 'The Hunchback Of Notre Dame' is not the only piece... Will the snitch not apologize today? Kaspar and Joosep, come out. I must lock the door. What shall we do now? Let's go. You fuck, you thought that you don't have to apologize today? Say that you are a dickhead and a snitch, so that the girls hear you! I can't hear you! I am a dickhead and a snitch. - I can't hear! You, girls? Stop it. - I can't hear you! I am a dickhead and a snitch. Is it normal that this guy wears such shoes? Are you a sportsman now? - His mother is a sportsman. Nerds don't wear these shoes! Anyone got a knife? - I have. See, Joosep, I really want what's best for you. You know, you are a crazy bastard. Crazy bastards don't wear Sebix shoes. So, I want to help you to get rid of a trademark that doesn't suit you. Okay, I give it back later. Let's say, it is okay for today. But tomorrow you will apologize correctly. Got it? Does anyone know, what are the first words in the great book 'Adventures Of The Good Soldier Svejk During The World War'? OK, take your seats. Wait... Joosep, where are your shoes? I don't have them. What do you mean, you don't have them? How did you come to school? I threw my shoes away. - Threw your shoes away? Why? The trade mark was too noticeable. I don't see the point here. - You see, there are personalities and people, who have trademark items instead of a personality. So, you are a personality now? - I didn't say that. But now everybody will see me, not the trade mark I wear. What a guy! Enough! So you think that some Olympic Champions or Chino Moreno are also meaningless persons? They get paid for wearing trademark items. But you pay for these items. Joosep, you have another rooster on your hoodie. Enough! Alright, enough of that! Joosep, you're a failure! At least, now I'm honestly Joosep. Well... Take a seat. But in spite of this little action against the consumer society... We'll go on with the class. How will you get home? - What? How will you get home? I don't know. Try these. Joosep, wait! So, what's up? Tight? - No, they are ok. What you said in the class, did you mean it? Absolutely. I think you should wear these expensive shoes, then they wouldn't pick on you so much. I definitely will not do that. It is a principle. Hi! You were supposed to call me later. But I wanted to see you in person. Of course, you don't have time in school. Yeah, that sucks. Suddenly, what is it with you and Joosep? I didn't know that you were such good friends. We are not friends or... Just... But this fighting with other boys, it is really stupid. What should I do, then? Just watch the others beat him up? But it used to be like that. - I can't stop it now. Keep on beating Joosep, l'll just watch... Thea, for the first time in my life I feel... That this is a matter of honor. Well, hello... Do you know what time it is? Don't start, grandma. Please. - Wait... Have you eaten? Kaspar? Come to the kitchen, l'll heat up the omelet. So, where were you? Walking with Thea. Where did you walk? Grandma, that really is not your business. When I get calls from school, it really is my business. Why did they call? You are picking on your classmates. What nonsense is that? - I got a call from school, that you are picking on someone named Joosep. I am not... I don't pick on anybody. Kaspar... Do you know, how much I want to believe you? You come home at night. You won't talk to me. Kaspar, tell me... You are not one of those, who they write about? Violent? You really don't understand anything. But how can I be sure that you are not lying to me? Well, who is this Kaspar? - He is not to blame. But who is? - What do you mean? So, somebody is actually teasing you? Well? - The whole class. What? - The whole class! What talk is that? - It's just how it is... The whole class is never picking on someone! Usually there are some leaders behind it. And what do you do? - What do you mean? What do I mean? Nobody picks on my boy, so that I get phone calls from school! My boy will fight back! The man who does not fight back, will be a loser one day. Yeah! But if you show them once, they won't come at you again. Do you understand? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? Day Four Joosep! Wait! Morning! - Good morning. Well? - Well what? It starts all over again? You don't have to do that. - No, too late. Now we'll go to the end. Remember what was here yesterday? I'll go first. We got Joosep. Hold him! Fuck, pushing me...! Hold him! Fuck, have you gone mad? What is going on here? Take your seats. And what are you doing with that chair, Kaspar? Nothing. Alright, we'll talk later. Wait... So, you are also infected by this trademark antagonism? It is no infection. Do you also want to show your classmates, that people wearing trademark items are vain? That is what you said just now. Alright, let's start. Maybe some words about your last test. Nothing to be happy about... The picture is rather sad. But there is hope. And as my grandfather once said, the harvest was sparse, but lean. But I am sure that if you go on like this... Kaspar, you will come to the backyard after the math class. Got it? What are you doing? Thea What is it? Say it. I don't want to go on. And you think I want to? Don't have the guts to be anywhere else, now? Some heavy metal - took a shit... Kaspar, what has gone into you? You were an normal guy. That's the way it is. Put your hands down, I don't want to fight. Get it, man, I don't give up like that. So, how will it be? - You'll find out, in a moment. Don't come closer! Really cool guys, picking on just one! Go to the woodshed, or you'll get worse. You go to the woodshed! Let's take him to the shed. - Use your own head and think! Go to the shed! - Don't touch me! What are you, always after Anders! - You shut the fuck up! Fucking idiots! You fucking move! You think, that today you didn't have to apologize? Can I kick him myself? - Okay, try. And a normal kick. Be still, you fuck! Your kick is like shit, he is still standing! Paul was on the way. - What? He was not! Let's try it like in the movies, that dude is down with one kick. It is not possible! Let's take boxing. They hit each other for, like, twenty minutes, and finally one falls down because of exhaustion. But, Oll, you try it. - Me? Try to get Joosep down with just one kick. Okay... Let him loose at the right moment. Why the fuck are you hitting him in the face! Everyone will se the bruises! - So what? Don't you think, man? You won't hit again! - That's for sure! Fucking moron! See, Kaspar! Without you it would have been over now! Dickhead! - Fuck off! No problem, l'll hit. - Hold him! Be still, man! Fuck, what did I tell you! Nobody will fall after that. Hold him, I'll do it myself. Joosep, at this moment you will ask Kaspar never to protect you again, because it will make things worse! Alright. What now? Can you breathe? What do you think, you kicked him in the lungs. I know! Okay, let's say that apologies are accepted for today. And Kaspar, this is a lesson for you, too! Don't you fucking protect him! Let's go! Yeah. I can't talk to you right now, I'll call you later. No, everything is fine. Bye. Hi! What are you doing here? I don't want you to protect me tomorrow. What will you do tomorrow? Nothing. Just get your kick in the ass and apologize? What would you do? What about shooting them all? Or do, like, God's law or something? When you hit another person, your hand will fall off. And then we'd watch these handless on streets. Fairytale... I think that when the school is over, I won't have to see these bastards ever again. Can you wait that long? - Why can't I? I have made that far, I can go on. Maybe I go to the Netherlands, to study computer graphics. Great dream. It is. So, I'll do nothing tomorrow. Thanks. DO YOU LOVE A FAG? Day Five Hi. What are you doing here? I thought that if you want it that way, you must go to the classroom first. Or they would attack me first. Right, okay. Well? Having second thoughts? Good morning, boys! What are you waiting for, the class will start soon! Let's go... - Ladies first... Good morning! What are you standing here? Take your seats, the lesson will begin. Hurry up... Did you have a good rest? Did your homework? How do you feel? Good? So... Last time we talked about French romanticist literature, but today we'll turn to Russian literature. You may not imagine the influence of French spirit in Russia... Napoleon and Alexander I, for example, spoke with each other in French. Today we'll speak about 'A Hero Of Our Time' by Lermontov. The main character acts like a villain, but suffers like an aesthete. The last to enter are fags! Thea, do you love a fag? Thea, wait! Where are you going? - You got, what you wanted! What do you think I should have done? I don't know... Maybe not entered the classroom with Joosep? So, Joosep is to blame? - Of course not. You have this stupid thing about power with Anders... No! - What, then? Even if it is about power, what is so wrong when I don't want to obey this guy's orders? Must I be Anders's errand boy? Thea, wait! - But do you think of me? Of course I do! - Then why do you act like that? Leave this Joosep. I am not with him. I don't know, who is with whom. Just promise not to deal with him again. If Joosep does not ask for my help anymore, then, of course. Do you understand what you just said? What? Joosep is more important to you than I am! - No! But how should I know, maybe you are fags! And now apologize! - I am sorry! Joosep, do you have any dirty laundry? Did you take the things from my room? - Yes. Give this shirt that you are wearing. Wait... What is there, on your chest? Come here, show me. My god, where did you get those bruises? Physical education class... - And here...? What's that? Margus! Please come here! - No... Stand still! Don't move, I tell you! Take look at those bruises and the chin! Joosep, you had a fight! - At least, did you hit back? Are you crazy? Who did you fight with? It would be alright, if he fought, but I suspect that somebody just wrote the commentary on his chest. There were many of them! - Who? I will talk to them! No! It would make things worse, I couldn't study there! Right. - What can be right here? Who were they? - I won't tell, it is none of your business! I can handle it! - Good! A man must handle it! Or nobody will respect him! - What are you talking about? Look, what if they cripple him? Don't you read the papers? You are a macho man! But Joosep is not! He is a wuss! Dammit, he must become a man! KASPAR, I LOVE YOU Day Six KASPAR, I LOVE YOU Day Six It is really embarrassing for me to speak of this... Today I got a phone call from Joosep's mother. She told me that somebody had beaten Joosep in school. I want to know, what you know about it. If it is true, then l'm really disappointed in you. Joosep... What do you say? I don't say anything. I can assure you - the culprits will not graduate from this school. And what comes next... You can imagine that. Joosep, leave the classroom for a moment. Will anybody tell me now? What is going on in this class? Toomas? It is Joosep's own fault. - What is? He is such a jerk. Toomas... Have you hit Joosep? What? I cannot hear you! Nobody would hit such a jerk. If anyone should leave this school, then it would be Joosep. Do you understand, what you are doing? We don't need those who keep snitching on their own class! Don't you feel sorry for him? The whole class against one boy! Will somebody say something? Kati? Toomas and Olav already said everything. I am really sorry. From now on, the headmistress will talk to you, or whoever. I have nothing to say to you. Fuck, when that fag comes back, l'll fucking kill him! What can the headmistress do to us... She cannot do anything, if we stick to the same story. I already said that I don't beat jerks and fags. But then, let's agree, that we tell the same story. Exactly, but that goes to the girls, too. Riina? - What about me? We haven't seen a thing. Right, Girls? Okay, I didn't mean you, more, like, Thea. L'll talk to her, she is okay. Kerli? Fuck it! One guy just cannot snitch on a whole class! We must do something back. I don't believe that Joosep let her mother call the teacher. Who would? Let's make him a website, with fag photos! Yeah, let's put Joosep and Kaspar to some male prostitutes' site. Wouldn't it be too weak? Why aren't you in school? Wait! I want an answer! Did I ask you to call the teacher? Wait... I didn't call anybody. - Fuck... It must have been your mother. Fuck... What did she phone about? Do you hear me? Listen to me! What happened? The Cheese came to the classroom and asked, who beat Joosep. And then? - Nobody said anything. And you ran away? - What should I do then? Have you fought back at least once in your life? Yeah, I have... - Where did you hit? Everywhere. Do you understand, it won't end like that. You must hurt the herd leader! So that he... Do you get it? Do you know the triangle? - Yeah, here. Then hit! That's the way to hit! Do you understand me? Or else nobody will ever respect you. Come here. - What is it? Max will do Kaspar, right? - What do you mean? Wait... Where is Joosep? - He ran away. Max created Joosep's e-mail address and sent Kaspar an e-mail. What? - So it was, like, from Joosep. I want to see that! Kaspar, I love you. Joosep. Did you get an answer? Maybe he found out that it is not really Joosep? What do you care? He answered. Joosep, I am not gay. Wait... Let's create a similar account for Kaspar. And send a same letter to Joosep. So, set up a date for them? - Do you think, they would come? Let's keep it very simple. Let's meat on the beach, it is important... Hi. Well... What did you want? - Me? What do you mean? You sent me an e-mail, that you had something important. Fuck... Well, Kassu...! Which one of you is not gay? Do your gay thing, don't let us get in the way! Maybe a pole dance? Thea, are you still with Kaspar? Come on, everybody is waiting! Tell them. The guy is a fag... Are you going steady or not? No, we are not. Give him! Fuck off! Let's see, what a man he really is! Are you a tough guy? Get on you knees! On your knees, fuck! Bring Joosep here! Hi, Joosep! Kaspar! And now say that you never protect a freak like Joosep! Say it! I won't protect a freak like Joosep! I won't protect a freak like Joosep. Let's take a picture! - Fuck, why now? Idiot. And now do some fag stuff. Take Joosep's pants off! Take them off! - Do something! Take the knife away, maybe then he will kiss him or something... Fuck, do something! You did not get your punishment, yet! Stand still, you fuck! If you move, l'll smash your kidneys, got it? I don't want to see this! Thea, where did you go? - Bring her back! Others, stand aside. Do something. Take Joosep's pants off! - The knife can be seen. Take this. Do like this. See, it works! Hurts? Take Joosep's pants off. Take his pants off, you fuck! How long must I wait? He can't do anything... - Shut the fuck up! Do what you are asked. Won't I be seen? Stop it... - No, I won't stop! Take them off! Don't you understand! - Stop it! Take it in your mouth! We want to see some gay porn! Take off the underpants! Take them off, you fuck! Stop it, it's not hard. - He'll make it hard! You know from your own experience? - Your mother knows, fuck! Joosep, you should like it! Take it in your mouth! And suck! Suck it! You are freaks, all of you! Fuck you, big mama! Fuck, a drop landed on me! Let's go. - Anders! I AM SORRY, GRANDMA Day Seven I AM SORRY, GRANDMA Day Seven Grandma... - Kaspar! You startled me! I don't want to eat right now. - What is it, this time? Kaspar, where were you last night? I am worried about you! You are not in that age to be out alone. Oh my god, what happened to your jacket? A hole... How will you go to school like that? Take it off! Kaspar...! What is it, now? Grandma... - Yeah? Please, forgive me. This is a magazine. You got eight bullets. This is all you have. The magazine goes here. How do you load a gun? You pull the slide back. And you don't push it back, but just release. Now it's loaded. Let's go. Wait. Remember that further from Boys, where are you going? - You call the police. Only in movies they shoot to long distances with pistols. This weapon can shoot accurately only up to 25 meters. You must be really close to your adversary. And only then shoot. There is no point to shoot from afar, just wasting bullets. Shall I go in or out? Go out. Thank you. Well? Afraid? That's what we wanted. Let's go. If there was a God's law or something... When you hit another person, your hand will fall off. Get it, man... Nobody in our class protects Joosep. It's a matter of honor. I don't get anything, a guy is talking, like... I shot a girl from the eighth grade. I told you not to shoot from afar. Have you any bullets left? Have you any bullets? - No. Take it. How shall we do it? We'll count to three and then shoot. We'll pull the trigger together on three. Thank you. One... Two... I will not die in your despite
