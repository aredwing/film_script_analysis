 

                        Shit. Hey! - Oh, shit! - Hey! Yo, Champ, get out of here! Pull out! Pull out, Champion! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! # Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy # Get ready, everybody # Let's shimmy # All the shimmying that we do # Right now, it's time for our latest tales from the street, and I'm here with my man the legendary Speedy. What's going on, Base? How you doing? I'm good. How are you? - Chillin', chillin'. - All right, cool. So what's this crazy-ass shit that happened out in Queens last week? Yeah, so me and my boy Rox, we go out to Shea Stadium to catch a Mets game, you know, but for us, it ain't even about watching the Mets. We bring in these cans 'cause we trying to bomb the apple. Why are you trying to bomb the apple? Explain what the apple is for everybody. Well, anybody who's living up in this fine city knows anytime someone on the Mets hits a home run, this goofy-ass apple pops out of the- pops out of the stands, and everybody goes crazy. It's corny, but I'm a fucking Mets fan. - No, fuck the Mets. - Don't disrespect the Mets. All right, all right, it's your show, so I'ma let that slide. But seriously, yo, you know, I mean, we've hit walls. We've hit subways before. But if you hit the apple when it pops up, the whole crowd sees it. Everybody watching on TV sees it. All of New York will see that shit. That's gonna be, like, forever. We had to wait until about, like, 4:00 in the morning. We go over there to center field, we hop the fence, and there it is- boom, the apple. You know, I'm right underneath it. I can see it. I can touch it. We're ready to go, and then, man, flashlights are all over us. There was mad cops, so we just bounced, right? I'm running one way. Rox is running the other way. I think I'm in the clear, but, like, I had to- I caught a charge. You gonna try to bomb that apple again? Hell yeah, I'm gonna try and bomb that apple again! Yo, I'm a constant opportunist, so if the situation arises, then hell yeah. But honestly, even if it's not Speedy or Rox that do it, somebody's gonna bomb that apple, and they gonna get mad props in the game. Their names are gonna ring out in our world. # Ah, the shimmy is what's happening # To everybody # Shimmy # Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy # A'ight, yo, let's go. Buffing our shit? Who the fuck they think they are? Yo, that's what I'm saying, man. I gotta get me one of those Queens boys, man. You gonna get you one of them Queens toys and do what? I'ma fuck-yo. I take care of my shit. You don't know. Gus, let me get two slices. You know, I don't know. What, you a gangster? What, you a thug now? When I need to be. Yo, don't let me catch one of these motherfuckers buffing our pieces. I'ma come up behind 'em with some GoodFellas shit. They not gonna see it comin'. Put, like, two in the back of they head. Easy, just- First of all, nobody in they right mind is gonna give you a gun. It's not funny. And second of all, if you gonna shoot somebody, you shoot them in the eye like a fuckin' man. Be the last thing they see before they drop, not like them fuckin' "GodFellas" pussies. Yo, whatever, as long as they get got, yo, I'm fuckin'- Stupid-ass Mets fans, yo.

Fucking Pedro or some shit? Yeah, yeah, Pedro, he works, like, at Shea, like, off-game security when the Mets is out of town and shit. But who the fuck cares? Fuck Pedro. - And fuck the Mets too. - Fuck the Mets. That's exactly what the fuck I'm saying. So look, this is what you gon' do. You gonna call Pedro. He gonna sneak us in. We gonna bomb that stupid-ass apple. Then when they get a home run, everybody gonna see our names on that shit, right? And who gonna be on our dick? Them Queens niggas. Yo, you fucking crazy!

He fuckin' heard about a fix on a fight at the Blue Horizon in Philly, and guess what. I don't give a fuck. This nigga bet the wrong guy. How you bet-how you gonna bet the wrong guy? What kind of stupid shit is that? How we gonna get this paper? Well, for starters, Ronaldo owes me $80 for that custom, and I got deliveries. Well, you gonna have to steal them deliveries. I'm not stealin' from Donnie. That nigga'll kill me. You not stealing from Donnie? What, you scared of Donnie's rich ass? Don't be a fucking pussy. - Man, it ain't even about that.

You want 'em? - That'll work. That's good. That's good. - I mean, I just have one delivery, so... All right, word. All right, here, turn around. All I see on these streets, Malcolm, is guys wearing flip-flops. It's fucking disgusting, really. It's not a joke. I mean, what the fuck is this city coming to? Back in the '90s, you would have never seen a guy wearing flip-flops. I mean, if a woman wants to show her pretty toes, fine. I don't recommend it, but... You want to go to the beach in flip-flops, all right. It's a pass there, but... What's the address? - Yo, it's this girl- Ginnie. She's Donnie's sister's friend from high school. I don't know. Private school girl. Where does she live? She's all right. Yo, Malcolm, could you just chill for a second? You know, I'm really bored out here. It's fucking hot as shit, and I just- just want to talk for a second. - Yo, it's not even like- it's not even like that. Look, Donnie just chewed my ass about how slow I am, and I'm just trying to speed this shit up. Yo, fuck Donnie. Chill and talk to your boy Lenny for a second. Yo, I gotta jet, man. Like, come on. I just need the address. All right. It's 34 East 1 Oth Street, okay? A'ight, what apartment? - Six. - A'ight. I miss you, man. Thank you. - Be good. - Peace, Lenny. - What's up? - Hi. Hot out there, huh? Huh? - It's hot outside. - Yeah, it really is. Um, is Ronaldo upstairs? Yeah, I guess. Ronaldo. # Ronaldo # Sofia? Yeah. Oh, come on, nigga. You still asleep? No, I'm depressed. Why are you depressed? They discontinue Fruity Pebbles? She dumped me. - Now, you know that girl was just fucking with you. You know that shit wasn't serious. - I can't stop thinking about her. I don't know what I'm gonna do. - You gonna give us that 100 bucks for that "Ronaldo loves Alyssa" custom we made you. That's what you gonna do. It's "A-Lisa. " Whatever. - No, get it right. And it's 80 bucks. So then give me my 80 bucks. I love her. You love her? You out your mind, son. - Yo, I never gave her this shirt. You could take it. - Uh-uh. What do I want with this? - I don't know. Resell it or something. Resell it? Nah, it don't work like that. What am I supposed to do? Find some other herb named Ronaldo who's fucking your girl? I don't think so. Hey, look, I can't pay you. Look, you can keep the custom. Give it to Alyssa to try to win her back. It's "A-Lisa. " - You need to get over this shit and go find some other girl. I can't, though. I got no money, I got no job, and I got no girl. I got nothing! What about your kicks? - Yeah, I got my sneakers. Big whoop. - Nah, I'm saying, run your sneakers. What? - Look, nigga, you owe us money, and we need the cash now, so I'm taking your sneakers. But those are my favorites. So? Yo, what the fuck! Bitch, why the fuck didn't you stop them? I don't care. Call your fucking friend. I don't have a phone. Call your fucking friend. I don't have a phone. You don't have a phone? What the fuck is this in your pocket, then? Oh, you don't have a fucking phone? So what the fuck is this, then? - He doesn't have a phone, though. - Oh, he don't have a fucking phone. Okay, and since you didn't have a phone, I guess I'm not robbing your ass, then. - I'm sorry. - What the fu- Fuck! # I believe # I believe # I'll go home # Hello? Take off your shoes. I'm in the bathroom. Hey. You're not Donnie. Who are you? Uh... Sliced my toe really badly. Does it hurt? Yeah, like hell. I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's not your fault. Come in. So who are you? I'm Malcolm. Oh, okay. - You just asked me who I am. That's my name. - Come in. Come in. Into the bedroom. Where's Donnie? Come sit over here. - I don't know. He must be working. Look at my toe. It's really bad. Yeah, it is. You should put some Vaseline on that or something. My brother's a boxer, and they always use that for- - Vaseline? - Yeah. - No, it needs, like, hydrogen peroxide or something. Whatever works for you. - You know, you don't exactly seem like the Donnie type. I mean, I work for him. And we go bombing together sometimes, but that's about it. Like terrorists? What? Bombing? Nah, yo, like graffiti. You know, spray paint, writing on walls, climbing buildings. - I know what graffiti is, okay? I'm not an idiot. Um, look, I need a 50. My wallet's in the other room. Oh, I'm so broke. - Yeah, I see you got, like, a lot of cameras in here. My uncle, he bought me a camera just like that before. Uh-huh. I broke that shit, though. It was a nice one too. Got a nice big flash on the top. Hey, do you have $10? I don't, actually. I'll tell you what. I'll give you $60 if you smoke me up out of your stash. - I- - Here you go. I'm gonna go get my bowl from my mom's room. - Why is your bowl in your mom's room? Oh, she doesn't care. And she's in Nantucket for the weekend anyway. What the fuck is Nantucket? Holy shit. Let's smoke this. - Word, come on. Let's do it. So, uh, where's Donnie? Is he golfing with that asshole Ben Brogan? Donnie does not golf. Yes, he does. You didn't know that? No, 'cause it's not true. I don't know what to tell you other than the fact that he was on the varsity golf team at Oornell. Get the fuck out of here. I'm not kidding. - Yo, my boys found out about this shit? You don't understand. This nigga Zerox golfs? That's fucking retarded. Zerox? Yeah, that's his tag name. That's ridiculous. - Yo. - Yo, Malcolm. Where Champion's spot at again? You mean the impound? Yeah. - Wait, you going to sell the cans? - No, we gonna talk about our feelings. - A'ight, it's on 134th, right by the underpass. A'ight. - So have you ever traveled anywhere?

What? - Yeah, Oosta Rica, Mexico, Paris, all over Italy- like, three times in Italy- Spain, elsewhere in France. That's crazy. - There's still so many places I want to go, though. I mean- - But, shit, you got a head start on me. - Yeah, well, I'm sure you'd like it. What are your favorite foods? - That's easy. Milkshakes. What flavor? Vanilla milkshakes. Nah, fuck vanilla. That's wack. No, vanilla's fine. I don't like chocolate and get shit for that all the time. - I'm more interesting than that. I like... Mint chocolate. Yeah. Okay. What's your favorite food? - Uh, that's easy, two favorite foods: oysters, cherry pie. Oh, three: champagne. - That's- champagne is not a food. All in combination. The best meal. You a drunk. Yo, Champion, what's good? What up, girl? What's poppin'? - Damn, still doing that nursing home scam, robbin' them old ladies? That's fucked up. - You gonna question me on how I feed my family, man? This is how I feed my kids. If I gotta scam the old folk, I'ma scam the old folk. Right, right. Yo, I need my cans. You need all the fucking cans? All my fucking cans. - What the fuck you about to get into? Don't worry about it. What you scheming on, man? - It ain't got shit to do with you, so don't worry about it.

She's, like, a hippie and shit. You can't be a hippie, okay? What you mean? - It's, like, an olden times thing. It's like saying she's a Victorian courtesan or a Mayan princess or something. Anyway, he cheats on her. So what? - No, but he cheats on her with, like, vagabonds. What the fuck is vagabonds? Vagabonds are... Well, okay. So this one time, Donnie and I were getting cash out of an ATM, and there was this old Hispanic woman cleaning the floor- like, the janitor or something. And she was really old and really fat. Okay.

Get the fuck out of here. # Well, I say, if it wasn't # For the Lord # How would I know? # What would I do? # Tell me, what # What # What would I do? # Would I do? # I want to know # Oh, what # What # Would I do? # Yo. I'm in love, yo. I met this fucking girl today. Oh, my God. What the fuck happened to you? Yo, shit gotta fucking end, Sofia. I'm tired of this shit, yo. I'm fuckin' tired of these niggas, yo. I'm tired of them. I'm gonna fuckin' kill one of them, yo. Their fuckin' moms gonna be crying, yo. - Your fuckin' mom's gonna be crying that she even birthed you. There's, like, 12 of them niggas out there. - Listen, they just fucking with us 'cause I roll with a girl, man. - Fuckin' with us 'cause you roll with a girl? No, I think they fucking with me 'cause I roll with a easy target like you. Always talking shit. - Look, I'ma let that slide. Listen, let's just keep our eyes on the prize, man. Once we bomb this apple, nothing- yo, nothing they did is gonna mean nothing, man. We gonna fuckin' make history in their backyards. - Look, you need to let that shit go. We don't have no fucking money, we don't have no plan, and if we did have some money, you gonna give it to some nigga that you don't even fucking know? That's stupid! - No, I'm telling you, Pedro is good for it, man. You don't know shit. You're not even fuckin' wearin' sneakers. No-sneakers-havin'- What the fuck happened to your sneakers? - I'm telling you I got something big, yo. No. - No, listen- - No! - Listen, remember the fuckin' girl I was telling you about? My love, Ginnie? Listen, her fucking parents got that bread, like, that Nantucket money, like... Look, and in her room, there was this case, right? It was a case full of jewelry, full of- Yo, I know how to get it. You gonna have enough money to move out. You got five minutes. - Yo, so all we gotta do is get the key, and we good. - So is there, like, diamonds in there? Like, can you give me a little bit more information- - Hell yeah, there was diamonds. There were fucking diamonds, rubies, pearls- So what's the plan, then? - The plan? The plan is, I seduce her. The plan is, you seduce her? You serious? Nigga, you couldn't seduce a prostitute if you had, like, hundreds all in your hands. - You don't understand. This girl is on my dick. All I gotta do-listen. All I got to do is go upstairs, right? Get her naked, right? Fuck her real quick, you know- - Sucker, you think I want to hear this shit? - Why you gotta hit me so fucking hard, though? So did you even use a condom? I ain't fuck her yet. Wait, wait, hold up. You telling me you didn't fuck her yet but she got you fucked up in the head like that already? It's not even like that. - I thought you was harder than that. You fuckin' soft. - Listen, I'm a gentleman. - You ain't shit. If I fucked her, I wasn't gonna wear no condom anyway, though. - Oh, real smart, Malcolm. Real smart. - Whatever. Oondoms suck, Sofia. How the fuck would you know? That one bitch that one time? Meredith? - Listen- - She looked like a dude, son. - Stop hating on my shit. - Her name was "Man. " - Stop hatin' on my shit 'cause you don't get no dick. Her nickname was "Manny. " Whatever. The fact is, like, everybody knows condoms suck. You would think, after all this time, they'd have made something better, like- - How exactly do they wrap your dick better? Like, that's the dumbest shit I've ever heard. - Why does it have to go all the way down? See, that's what I'm saying. Like, why can't it just cover the tip, let the shaft get all the juices? - That's fuckin' disgusting. Shut the fuck up. - I'm saying they should just cup it. - Oup it like what? Like a little hat? Like a fitted? - Oh, no, but kind of- no, like a yarmulke. What the fuck is a yarmulke? One of those little Jew hats. I... I don't know what that is. - Yo, the shit that Mr. Donowitz wears, the little black thing on his head. - Oh, the thing with the bobby pins in it? Yes. - How the fuck was I supposed to know that's Jewish? What the fuck you think? He was trying to make a fashion statement? - I don't fuckin' know, but all I know is, until they start making little rubber Hanukkahs, I suggest you wrap your dick proper, or else that shit just gonna fall off and roll down a fuckin' hill. - Nah, yo, I bet you she's a virgin. So? Virgins can have babies, Malcolm. Whatever. - We should just rob this bitch straight up. Fuck that shit. Nah, I already told you, I don't want no face-to-face on this. And plus, I don't want to scare her. - What the fuck you mean, you don't want no fucking face-to-face on this shit? You just met this bitch. Fuck that bitch. Look, you always sayin', "Oh, we gonna be the biggest writers in New York City. " Well, do what you gotta do to make that shit happen. - You don't even understand what I just went through earlier. I got this. All I gotta do is wait for her to come out her building, act like I'm bumping into her, like, "Oh, shit. " She's going to invite me back upstairs. - With no shoes on. - Whatever. She gonna invite me back upstairs. You know what I'm saying? And I'm gonna get up in it, take the chain, and be out, so smooth. It's gonna be so easy, yo. - Malcolm, you are so dumb. - You don't understand, man. I got this in the bag. That shit right there, that shit remind me of the thing that we did with Scoop and Dash. Remember? - Oh, yeah, it does look like that shit. Fucking crazy face. Yeah, that's they signature shit. - Yeah. I like that blue shit too. - Tryin' to help your weak-ass book out. - Please, girl. You ain't all that. - Nigga, so why you jacking my shit? - Whoo! Guess who it is? My wifey wants another delivery. - Good. Go get that fucking necklace. That's not all I'ma get. You know what "delivery" means? Do you know what- It means dick. I'm about to get some pussy, with dirty socks on. Ha! Out! - NYPD! - What the fuck? You must be the drug dealer. Yeah, where's Ginnie? What's the magic word? I... I don't know. Nope. Um... - It's not "um. " It's not "I don't know. " - Look, I need to see her. She has my shoes. - You think she's cuter than me? She has my sneakers. You have no shoes. Yeah, I know. Where's your shoes at? She has 'em. - Well, you should probably take off your socks, 'cause Ginnie's mom's not gonna want you bringing the street into the house. Wait, but you have on heels. I'm a lot cleaner than you. Follow me. Here's the drug dealer. Everybody say, "Hello, drug dealer. " Hello, drug dealer. What's up? Donnie's not here, right? - Why? You scared? Nah, just... Yo, you got my shoes? No. Donnie took them. Fuck. - Anyway, we need 100. Money's on the table. - All right, I got two 50s, but... Whatever. So what you been up to? - I'm good. You? I'm all right. That was fast. I called you, like, two seconds ago. You're not stalking me or anything, are you? - What? No. I was just doing some deliveries in the neighborhood. Was it on Bethune? Was it that asshole Benny on Bethune? Um, I don't know. I think- I think it was on- If Benny shows up tonight, I'm not talking to him, no matter what. You're not either. No, not a word. Is Benny the blond one? No, no, no. That's Aaron Childs. - That's your blondie. - Yup. That's your boy, which, I can't believe that you like him. - It's just that we've known him way too long. He's not that bad. He's a monster. - Hey, don't offer him any product. - Aaron, like, called me out on it all of a sudden. - I mean, of course, have some. Here. - No, I'm all right. I'm all right. I was just joking. Don't be that way. Here. - Nah, really, I'm-I'm really cool. I'm good. You're really cool? He's really cool. - That's not what I meant. That's not what I meant. Yo, did I tell you that I'm gonna bomb the Shea Stadium apple? - I think it's called Citi Field. What's the apple? - Oh, it's like, when the Mets hit a home run, it's, like, this big, goofy, like, plastic apple that comes up; it's crazy. - And you're gonna draw graffiti on it? Yeah. That's so stupid. That's fucking retarded. No, it's not. I'm a Yankees fan, so... My dad's a Yankees fan. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Good-bye, drug dealer. It's Malcolm. Excuse me. Girls, say good-bye to Malcolm. - Bye, Malcolm. - Good-bye, Malcolm. - Yo, whatever, man. Whatever. - "Whatever"? We love you. Girls, say, "We love you" to Malcolm. We love you, Malcolm! Oh, well. We should bring him to Betty's party. That would be a riot. - And, like, I wanted to feel sympathetic, except, the whole time, he was, like, complaining about... - So you get the necklace or what? - You know I take care of my shit. Let's rob this bitch. Oh, shit. Nigga, where you going? Why you mad? Now that I think about it, you was gone only two minutes. Still ain't get your sneakers back, mm-mm-mm. - I don't know, but he needs to get the fuck out here. Believe this shit, man? These fuckers ain't got no vanilla Dutches, man. They call this shit a cigar shop? Come on. We gonna go to this newsstand. - What you think? You didn't tell me- Like, you didn't give me an answer yet. - No, but I think- I like what I hear, man. Sofia, you follow that bitch. Once she leaves her spot, keep a eye out. Let us know when she's comin' back. Me and Malcolm sneak in. I pick that lock, easy-easy. Champion saves the motherfuckin' day. - "Champion saves the motherfuckin' day"? Nigga, don't forget this is me and Malcolm's deal. - What the fuck? Y'all jewel thieves now? Maybe. - So what the fuck you wasting my time for? Why you calling me up with this bullshit, man? Yeah, that's what I thought. Don't worry. We gonna-I'm gonna break you off a nice cut. - Break us off a cut? Nigger- - Come on. Keep it up. - Fuck this shit. Malcolm, I'll do it my fucking self. - Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. Fuck that. Look, when we pawn that shit, we'll give you 20%. - 20%? Nah, I pawn 'em; you get 20%. - Nigga, you out your fucking mind. Fucking crazy-ass nigga. - Hold up. Let me get a Dutch. You got vanilla Dutch? - No Dutch. - No Dutches? Come on, let me explain something to you, man, a'ight? Y'all get locked up? Five years probation. Y'all coming home the next day. No need to worry. Me, I get locked up? Three-time predicate- I'm going down. So if I'm gonna rob a rich white bitch, believe me, I'm gonna take my proper cut. Fuck it. We'll give you 50%, but that's it. - That's what I'm talking. That's what I'm talking. I like that. - A'ight. - A'ight, I'ma keep one of them stones, a'ight? - Keep one of them stones? - For my bitch. - Nigga, that's coming out your cut. - Nah, you can charge that to the game, bitch. Just don't fuck it up. I'm Champion, baby. Champion never fucks up. I don't understand, like, why we don't just burst in there. What's wrong with you, man? You stupid or something? Relax. Calm down. - Well, turn on the fucking AO. I'm hot, nigga. - The AO drains my gas, and I'll be damned- I'm not turning on my car. Well, turn on the radio. - Damn, bitch, the radio broke too. What the fuck? Hello? Yeah, Ma, I can't talk right now. No, I've been working. I've been working. Nah, me and Sofie- me and Sofie are helping this guy out. We-yeah, but I can't talk right now. I'm gonna call you back, all right? All right. What the fuck are you doing? Jerking off in the back of the fucking car? No, yo, I got stickage, yo. What the fuck is stickage? He knows. It's, like, when your balls and your dick stick together, like... I ain't never heard of that. You better go to the fucking doctor. No, I don't need a doctor. I'm all right. - Who's that stinking like that? Why would you hang your funky-ass socks in the window? - Stinking up the car, man, for real. - No, that's them funky-ass TVs in the back stinking up the car like that. - Listen, them shits work, man. So hook that shit up! You ready? We gonna do this shit right here. All these buttons... UPS? Come on. This is what I came here to do, baby. Come on, man. Stop playing, man. Oh, shit, easy as fuck, man. Come on, man. Hurry the fuck up, man. - Come on. We're on six now. - Six? We on seventh, man. Yo, we walked up six flights, so we on the sixth floor. - We on seventh, man. You start from two, man. - What the fuck you mean, "start from two"? One, two, three... - Nah, nah. - Four. - You know what? Come on. We gonna start from scratch. We gonna start from scratch. I ain't gonna rob the wrong house, man. No, this is it. - Come on. We start from scratch, man. - No, no, no, wait. - Let's do it. Come on. I don't feel like fuckin' walking all the way down. - A'ight, youngster, pay attention. A'ight, simple shit. Ground floor, second floor, third floor, fourth floor, so on and so on. Understand? All right, get to stepping. Come on. I ain't got all day. - Why none of these fucking people got numbers on their doors? - Fuckin' white people don't take no stairs, man. You ain't tell me there were gonna be two locks, man. Look at the size of that motherfucker right there, man. - I mean, you said you could do any locks. - A'ight, let me do my thing right now, man. Shut the fuck up. Let me show you how I do it. A'ight, this is what I do, a'ight? Yo. Yo, fuck it. You got a phone? Let's Google that shit. Google how to pick a lock. - What, you trying to play me, nigga, like I can't do my job, nigga?

You ain't tell me this motherfucker wasn't no Concept lock, man! You ain't tell me about this motherfucker up here either! - What the fuck does it matter if it's a Concept lock, like... - Artie's Locksmith, that's probably the only motherfucker that can open that motherfucker right there: 24-hour service. Not me, man. This right here is-is- I can't- I can't do it, man. This shit right here is- You can't do it, for real? - I could do it, man.

What the fuck you think? I was running like a fucking track star trying to get down here, Malcolm. - Oh, you can't keep up with the white girls? - Shut the fuck up. I don't know this fucking area. The fuck is she doing? - Oh, shit, this bitch is going in? That's the ghetto swimming pool. - Let's go grab her fucking keys. You crazy? Gonna take us, like, ten minutes to get up there. She not gonna be in there that long. I'm telling you, that shit is crazy cold. Crazy cold. How you know? - Listen, I know all about the ghetto swimming pool, Sofia.

You not asking me if I ate or drank anything. - Yeah, but you're you, and she's, you know... - She's what? Pretty? Yeah, she's pretty. Interesting. Exciting. Fun. You know? But, yo, that ain't even my type, though. I don't even like chicks like that, man. - You said you was in love with her, Malcolm, so, you know, it is what it is. - You know I just be talking my shit. Like, just- You know I'm more into girls like-you know, like you. Like me? Like what, some weird-looking bitch that, like, isn't pretty, that isn't fly, that doesn't climb into fucking water towers? - No, I didn't mean it like that. I'm just saying I like girls that are more, like, you know, tough. Tough? What, tough like a fucking dyke? - No, Sofia. Yo, listen. You know-you know, I think you're fine as hell.

You know, I just be trying to- I don't be trying- Shut the fuck up, Malcolm. I know what the fuck you mean, like when you be fucking with somebody, trying to make them feel better, but instead you make them feel, like, ten times worse, so it's cool. Yeah, man. Like my mom, she used to think that I was scared of flying, so she would tell me, like, I have higher chances of dying in a car crash than in a plane crash. And I'm just like, "What the fuck?" Like, now I'm scared to ride in cars now. Yeah, like that. - Man... Or like wet dreams. - Wet dreams, Malcolm? Really? What the fuck? - No, like they always telling us in phys ed. They always telling us, like, it's normal to have wet dreams, right? But, like, I don't have wet dreams. Like, I don't come in my shorts in the middle of the night. But all my parts work, but, like-I don't know. Maybe something's wrong with me. - That's disgusting. - I know, yo. - No, I'm saying you're fuckin' disgusting. You don't say that shit to a lady. - Oh, now you a lady and shit? Please. Yes, I am a fucking lady. And, what, you think you gonna get that white bitch talking about, "I don't come all wild in my shorts at night"? - I mean, I don't come in my shorts, so, I mean, that's a benefit, if anything. A benefit? Look, my fucking point is, you don't say that shit to a female. It's manners. You're mad disrespectful. All right, man. You gonna be all right. - Don't touch my hand, Malcolm. - I'll touch your hand if I want to. Don't fucking touch my hand. Nigga, you soft. - You ain't so tough after all either. - I don't know what you talking about. Yeah, mm-hmm. - Yo, she's been up there for a minute. She has been. I don't know.
