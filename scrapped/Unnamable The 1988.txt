Be silent! Hush and listen to my words. For I would that some day you might walk in the light of day and sit at the tables of men. You can come out now. Come out. Saints preserve us. - Hurry it up. - Yes, sir. It was not human, which did this. Shh. The sooner he's in the ground, the sooner we'll be left in peace. Leave it be. Seal this house. The light of day must never enter it again. As you wish, Mr Craft. May what horror hides here be consigned behind these walls for all eternity. Blessed be all our mortal souls. It's not right to bury an old warlock by sacred ground. Go on. It makes no difference. Dead is dead. With this one, I am not so sure. And that was the tale told by Cotton Mather, the clergyman author, in his volume on New England legends. My story begins 50 years later, when a local boy stole into the house, and to the attic. What he saw reflected in the glass of the attic window, an image retained within it of the unnamable creature, which stared out of it for so many years, turned his hair instantly grey. He ran screaming from the house to be found wandering mindlessly in the nearby forest some days later by a woodcutter. The boy never regained his sanity. When questioned, he fell in the screaming fits, rather than attempt to describe the unmentionable thing he had seen locked in the glass of the attic window. Carter, this constant talk about unnamable and unmentionable things is childish. But, Joel, there are things in this universe so horrific that the mind is unable to conceive of them. Wrong. Everything can be conceived and described, either through scientific prose or mathematical equation. And that is a smug answer, but it is one to be expected from a science major. - It's common sense. - It's just a story, right? You haven't heard of Randolph Carter? Miskatonic University's best-published student. At least three magazines grace the world with his rubbish horror stories. Really? I had some poetry published... - You know it's more than that. - OK, Carter. Images embedded in glass I can accept only because it is possible according to the laws and principles of radiation. - But unnamable? - I give up. I wonder as to what unmentionable nourishment those roots must be sucking from that tomb. Carter, they haven't had a burial here in over 1 00 years. What do you think the boy saw in the window pane? - It cannot be described. - You're so full of it. - The story is true, Joel. - Do you think we're idiots? Of course not, but it is based upon a diary written by one of my ancestors who lived not a mile from where we are sitting now. - It was his son who went mad. - Jesus, Carter. It's just a bunch of old wives' tales. Is it? Two separate sources. Cotton Mather, a moderately-sane clergyman and author and my ancestor's diary. Both claim the tale to be true. Obviously, one based his story on the other's. Or you made them both up. You admit it is possible for a piece of glass to retain the image of someone who sits in front of it for a long time. - Sure. - But for centuries, it was an old wives' tale. - A superstition until science proved it fact. - So if I sit in front of a window... That doesn't mean that this creature actually lived. Forget the creature. What about the house? If all this is real, where's the house? - It's still there. - OK. You take us there, Carter. Glass or no glass, I tell you it's a bunch of bullshit. In fact, I dare you to show me the house. Well, Joel, you've seen it. It's right there. Gentlemen, there is a third local tale that tells... Give it! - That's a bat! - I got it. We'll spend the night there. Ha! Right. Well, why not? Shit, let's get out of here. No way. If Carter here thinks he can scare us with his tall tales, it's up to us to prove he's full of it. Joel, trust me. It's all true. Well, then, prove it. Scientific inquiry is the ultimate road, Carter. To famous disasters. I for one will not risk tampering with forces that dangerous. Come off of it, Carter. How much melodrama can you shovel out? "Forces that dangerous." How about you, Howard? Are you game? Uh, I don't know, Joel. I think the whole thing's a waste of time. In other words, our freshman colleague is chicken. Come on, Joel. It's just a story. Right? Don't look at me. I'm too smart to be conned by a stupid dare. - You're acting like a couple of little girls. - Wait a minute. Cowards! What are we going to do? I for one am going back to the university and a warm bed. You coming? Hey! You coming? Uh, Carter... Carter, we really should convince him to give this whole thing up. Not that anything's gonna happen. Legends are stories that are told and retold till most of the original meaning has gone. But there usually is some original meaning. Something started those stories. But it might have a simple explanation. It might, but l, for one, don't care to press my luck. JoeI'll be back in the morning to call us cowards and I can live with that. - Oh. Carter, hi. - Hello, Wendy. - Hi, Wendy. - Could you help with Angelie's assignment? - I don't know what he's talking about. - Sure. I'll be at the library tomorrow. Where else would anyone find you? See you. Howard, Joel will be all right. I just hope he scares the hell out of himself. Wendy? Look, if I did anything to offend you... I don't think you could. Don't follow me around like a puppy. - I don't. - Stop calling me. Well, I just thought maybe we could go out some time. Howard, read my lips. I danced one dance with you. That was all. That's all there ever will be. - So stop following me around. - I'm not following you. Uh, you just shouldn't walk alone at night. I can take care of myself. Shit. Carter? Howard? Is that you? You guys trying to scare me? Well, I don't scare that easy, guys. Carter? This isn't funny. What's wrong with me? What have I got to be afraid of? Ah, what the hell? I know you're up there, Carter. I'm gonna get you. Carter? Howard? Argh! Uh-oh. - Carter! - Shh. Carter... - Carter, what about Joel? - Just a second. Do you mind? What about Joel? He hasn't come back. I checked the dorm. - He's probably at the gym or with Vicki. - No, she hasn't seen him either. Carter, this is serious. He hasn't been seen since last night. We are the last people to have seen him. - You don't have to be melodramatic. - What if he's trapped in that house? Or broke his leg and can't get help? - He's capable of taking care of himself. - But if he can't. If... If something horrible happened, like you described... If something like that happened, we're better off not knowing about it. We can't just leave him there. It's broad daylight. We can go check and see. Sorry. Howard, you are so naive, even for a freshman. In these matters, day or night, it makes no difference. Don't worry about Joel. He's probably hiding, hoping that we'll think he's in trouble. Or he's waiting in the house for us to come back for him, so he can have a laugh. But what if he isn't? Thanks for the tip, Carter. - Oh, no charge. - Hello, Wendy. - Hi, Howard. - Hm? Uh, hi. Better yet, he went home for the weekend, so we'd have plenty of time to worry. Uh...yeah. But I don't like it, not knowing. As I said before. I have no intention of going in there. - I don't like it. - Howard... Let me put it to you this way. Do you believe in the supernatural? - No. - Well, then, what are you worried about? I'm worried that he's hurt. Well, then, trundle over there and check it out for yourself, by yourself. You really think he's trying to scare us into going there? He's just that crazy. Yeah. - How come you treat Howard like that? - Cos he's a dork. And he's a freshman. So are we. I think he's completely cute. If you want to make it at this college, you don't date the freshmen. - Why? - Cos that's the way it works. What works? Look, old girl, you have to use what you've got to get ahead. If you know what I mean. I guess. What do you mean? Honestly, we are the official Miskatonic University welcoming committee. - I'm John Babcock. This is Bruce Weeks. - I'm Wendy Barnes. - Nice to meet you, Wendy. - Tanya Heller. I love your accent. - Obviously, southern France. - A lot you know. She was raised all over, England, Switzerland and Germany. Her father is the ambassador to the court of St James. Actually, he's the first secretary. That's pretty impressive. Bruce's father's Secretary of the Navy. - So how do you like Miskatonic University? - It's great. But Arkham is a bore. Are you going to Boston for the Harvard game? - Of course. We've got a bus chartered. - We might have extra room. Really? Tanya and I would like to go, but we don't have a ride. We'd love to give you one, but technically we're taking the girls from Kappa Alpha. - Ah, yeah. That's right. - We were thinking of pledging there. - Really? Excellent choice. - Maybe you could give us advice. - What to expect about the pledging. - They're picky about members, but... If you're going to pledge Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, they'll be using the same initiation we use. - I don't think we should discuss this. - Come on. It's not going to hurt. Look, they're shoo-ins. What's it going to hurt? We won't put it all over campus. - Well... - We'll check out the location tonight. See if it's safe. There's this old house across the graveyard. - Sounds pretty kinky. - Sounds like hazing. Young lady, Miskatonic frats do not stoop to such behaviour. - So what about this house? - It's a must. Been deserted for years. We need to chart the inside layout. - lt'll be a hoot exploring it. - Let's go for it. - What? - So we get a jump on the other girls. I hope you fellas don't scare too easily. Yeah. You have not heard a ghost story until you've heard one of mine. - The guy is the master. - I'm sure he is. - What time? - Why don't we meet there at eight? - We'll bring the Buddies. - All right, but no frat pranks. No pranks. Honest. - We'll see. - We'll catch you later. That's how you get invited to the big weekend. - But an old dark house at night? - Come on. It'll be neat. Bruce is completely cute and he's captain of the rowing team. - lt'd be quite a coup for you. - I'm not so sure. If you don't want to be a campus bore, you get in with the right people. - Well, it's just... - No guts, no glory. - Why not? - Excellent. I've read enough. I wonder who he was. At least he had a name. - I am psyched. - This place gives me the creeps. - You ever been inside? - No. You? No. Look, you want to pull out now before you get your wick wet? - You really think they'll show? - Yes. Look, nothing gets a woman more excited than a good scare. They need that so that they can get close and horny. When you get them scared enough, they'll do anything. - Kind of perverted psychology. - Hey, if it works, use it. What do you think of Wendy? - Huh, the top on her. - I wouldn't throw yours out of bed either. What do you mean, mine? Well, this place isn't real conducive to horizontal dancing anyway. Hey, don't get soft on me. Now, come on. Divide and conquer. OK? Divide and conquer. - Hi, guys. - Hey, you made it. Bruce was beginning to think you wouldn't show up. - Eerie place. - Yeah, wild, huh? I'm glad it's not Halloween yet. - Shall we go in? - Yeah. Let's go in. Maybe we should just stay outside. Oh, come on. It's just an old house. See? Just a little ghost house humour. Sure. Look. This is gross. Hey, look, sneaker tracks. Somebody's been here. Maybe somebody lives here. - Nothing can live here. - Cut it out. Bruce, I suggest we find a good spot to get our attitudes adjusted. John? Yeah? - Very childish. - I found the living room. - The door's locked. - It's probably sticking. Shit. Come on. Howard. I, uh... Give me a second. Take all the time you need, old boy. His parents called the dorm. He was supposed to go home for the weekend. - But he didn't. - Who? Joel Manton, our friend who we left last night in that damned house. Are you ready to take this seriously? Joel's still there and I don't think it's a joke. Look, if he's waiting to scare us, then fine, but I'm going back there, with or without you. Then we must go, but let's go by my place first. I have a flashlight or two and a few of the things we may need. Well, it's about time. So she uncovered her eyes and spotted a policeman. The policeman said everything would be OK. As she got out of the car, the policeman tried to keep her from looking back, but she did. Hanging, upside down, from a tree branch over the car, was her boyfriend, his bleeding fingernails scraping over the roof of the car. - You're sick. - lsn't it getting late? I have an idea. Why don't we explore the house? Why don't you two go? We're all right here. Oh, come on. It'll be neat. - That's what we came here for anyway. - Yeah, let's go. Jeez, look at all this crap. Better keep moving. Hey, there must be a basement. - I'd rather go up than down. - Yeah, I don't care much for rats either. It seems bigger inside than it looks. Wouldn't it be weird to find a dead body under this? Don't. Something's out there. Come here. Something is out there...and it's us! I know. Don't say it. I'm afraid of my own reflection. Yeah. Something like that. Hey, look. I'm sure there's a lot of good antiques around here. It's amazing no one's taken anything. - Hell, who knows what we're going to find? - Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of. Let's cut away and circle around. We can give them a real scare. No. They're just trying to scare us. It's working. Come on. Get in here. Oh, hey. I got a flashlight here somewhere. Looks like it's our turn to scare them. I don't think Tanya's pleased I left her like that. Don't worry. Bruce'll take care of her. Come on. I suggest we find a parallel parking spot. Attic. I don't think so. This room looks pretty good. - It's super. - That's the spirit. Hey, speaking of spirits, I got another bottle. Oh. They gotta be around here somewhere. Is the Homecoming Queen always a Kappa Alpha girl? - Usually. Why? - Since you're president of... Ouch! - I'm sorry. - Not you. Some animal must have dragged it in. An animal that big, I don't need. - What about me? - That depends on how big you are. Come on. Stop it. You're drunk. Stop it! Oh, damn. - What do you think you're doing? - I just thought... You call that thinking? You may be the big jock captain of the rowing team... No, that's not it. Maybe I have a boyfriend. I'm sorry. She always hated me being off with the team. We have to travel a lot. So we broke up. Do you have a boyfriend? Well, there is someone I like very much, but... Wendy! Shit. - What got into her? - Probably your stupid friend. Stop. You can't leave us here. We gotta get out of here. A head. Oh, my God, help me. It was a human head. It's all right, we're getting out of here. Wait here. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, John? - Is he all right? - Stay back. - What happened? - Something's gonna kill us all! Wendy? Wendy? What was it? I don't know, but something is going to kill us, so we gotta get out of here! Wendy? Just like a woman to faint. Take care of her, Howard. Uh... Miss? Miss? Erm... You OK? Hello? Carter, you want to give me a hand? Interesting. Very interesting. Hi, I'm Howard Damon from... Don't scream. It's OK. You're safe. He's correct. We won't harm you. I'm Randolph Carter. - Yes, I know you. - And this is Howard Damon. - And you are? - Tanya Heller. Of course. - We gotta get out of here! - Why? Something's here. A creature. It killed John Babcock. - A creature? - I'm not lying. I swear it. - Joel had this masquerade well planned. - Something's up there. I swear. - We believe you. What did it look like? - I don't know. - Unnamable perhaps, hmm? - Cut it out. I didn't see it. I just ran. It... - It what? - What happened, exactly? There was a scream. That's when we found John. He was lying there. His throat had been ripped out. That's why we ran... - Hold it. You're positive he was dead? - I saw him there. Fraternity boys are known to pull pranks on new students. - But he was dead. Bruce... - His friend? - Yes. - Aha. The plot gets thinner. - John and Bruce were playing tricks. - They couldn't have. OK, all right. Just come sit down. Take it easy. Maybe Babcock was accidentally killed or someone we know is doing people in. - Not Joel. - If he actually went mad, or thinks he did... Do you think it could have been planned to scare us? It is possible. -Wendy, my God, she's still up there. - Wendy Barnes? Those bastards. I've got to get... No. I don't rule out the possibility of there being something else behind this. We can't leave her up there with them. I suggest we ponder this a bit longer before running off. - Are you coming? - No. But keep an eye on her. And be careful. Get in there! No! Down there. He was here. - That bastard. - Where did you last see Wendy? It was somewhere around here. How did you happen to be here? Uh, someone we know. Carter and I came here last night. - You weren't following us, were you? - No. Wendy thinks you follow her. Yeah, well, she's paranoid. I think she's afraid of men, despite her facade. - Maybe. - I'm not like that. Afraid of men? No, paranoid. I didn't think so. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Bruce? Bruce? - Poor Wendy doesn't even know it's a joke. - This way. - Joel? - Wendy? You are very brave. Yeah, well, not usually. I figured Joel might be the one scaring everybody to get back at Carter and me. Joel, it's me, Howard! - Wendy! - Wendy! The Necronomicon. Abdul Alhazred, the mad Arab. I hope this doesn't sound stupid, but what do guys see in Wendy? I think most guys just see her as a good time. It's her big tits, isn't it? I...guess. Damn them. What's wrong with the rest of us girls? Why do all the big girls always get all the attention? Howard? Oh, my God. It's Joel. It wasn't him. It wasn't him. - Oh, my God. - You mean... - Tanya? - Howard? - Tanya? - Please get it open. I can't. - OK. - Howard. Stay calm. Uh... - Meet me in the hallway. - Hurry! Tanya! I'm coming closer. Talk louder! Shit. Uh... It's all right. If we just walk in the same direction, we'll eventually meet, OK? Tanya? All right, Tanya, stay where you are. I'm going to go get Carter. And we'll come back and get you out, OK? Tanya? - Carter, Joel's dead. - That's to be expected. Don't you understand? Joel is dead. There are others. I know. Look, Howard, it wasn't just an old tale. - No shit. Well, what was it? - I don't know yet. - I have to have more time. - But Tanya and Wendy are up there. Get them out. - Hurry, Howard! - That's Wendy! Wendy, hold on! 'How such an abomination could have been born. 'How my wife suffered as it ate through her body to reach the light 'and then fled from that light as an animal from fire. 'l have searched the ancient books of magic, but have found only a feeble spell 'to trap the evil within these wooden walls.' My God. 'But the day will come when this spell is not enough 'and the dying wood of this house will rot away. 'Thus have I planted trees around the house 'and hope I will discover the ancient secrets of the tree spirits to help me. 'But l, Joshua Winthrop, am an old man, and trees grow very slowly.' You! - You're doing this! You killed him! - Stop it, no. - You killed him! You're sick! - I don't know what's going on. - We gotta get out. - You come any closer, I'll kill you! I'm going. I'm going. Wendy, look, I came down here to get you out. Honest. You can't stay down here. It's not safe. Argh! Why? You disgusting pervert! - How could you? - No! No! It hurts. Howard? Oh, Howard, please. Of course. Trees. Tree spirits. Genius. But now...will it work? If you need it, the lantern's in the library. Hmm. Well thought out. Hmm. I like that one. Woah! Carter, we've got to get... Carter? Carter! Tanya. Tanya. Tanya! Tanya! Carter! Hey! Tanya! Tanya. Tanya. Ah. Sorry I left you all alone. - It's John. - Yeah, I see. Come on. I'm sorry I lost you. I should have come back right away. I'm sorry. It's OK. All right, come on. Let's get out of here. Tanya, come on. It goes up! Get some of those boards. Boards, boards, big boards! Howard, in here. Look, it might come up through here. - What is it? - Don't ask. Maybe we can close it off with this. Father of all trees, awaken the sprits of these trees Joshua Winthrop has planted here. Protect us forever from the evil which dwells within this place. Yikes. Damn. Double damn. I think we're safe now. - It's out there. - No, no. It's just an image in the glass. It's what Carter and Joel were talking about yesterday. The glass retains the reflection of someone who stares out of it for a long time. Come on. I'll show you. Come on. It's nothing. Argh! Argh! No! Howard! Alyda. Alyda, my child. Alyda, I have come for you. Alyda. Alyda. Oh, Alyda. Tanya, down here! Give me your hand. You have renounced your human soul. It is time for you to come to me. It is time. Time to come home. It is time. Come on. - Get out of the house. - What about you? - I gotta find Carter. - He's probably dead. He may be looking for us. Now, go. Go. Howard? Carter? I couldn't find him. Come on. Howard! - They're all dead! - I know. I know. Even Carter. Are you OK? Howard! Howard! Help! Tanya! Oh! - Carter! - Quickly! I've seen it. I've really seen it. The unnamable. Please. It was hell down there, Howard. Shining light from the sky Light the tears in your eyes You can say you don't wanna be Left alone at night Cos I don't want to see, I don't want to see in the night Up there, I can feel up there Holier than night Up there, it can see your face Watching you, watching you, watching you Up there It's sad and lonely Up there I don't want to see inside Ooh, I don't want to see inside Staring hard at the world Wishing you had the words You can try to resist the call To accept the flow Cos you don't want to be, you don't want to be there tonight Up there I can see Up there Holier than night Up there It can see your face Watching you, watching you, watching you Up there It's sad and lonely Up there I don't want to see inside Up there Ooh, I don't want to see inside ?
