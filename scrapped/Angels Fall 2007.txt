 

                        1 Damn. This thing's a mess. Looks like she blew a gasket. What do you think? Yeah, well, I don't know. You heading into the park? I was but my car had other plans. Yeah, looks like you got yourself a blown head gasket. How much do you think that will cost? It's gonna be a couple of hundred dollars. And I gotta order the part in from Jackson, so that's gonna take a few days as well. - A few days? - Is there a problem with that? You gotta understand, Angels Fall is a small town. Yeah, served by stagecoach delivery, apparently. Sorry, I just wasn't expecting to stay. If you need a motel, the Mayfield's just down a ways. Clean, it's got reasonable rates. Well, reasonable is right in my price range. - Thanks, Mr... - Drubber. Mac Drubber. Call me Mac. Lynt can give you a ride. He's going right by the Mayfield. No. You know what? I've done enough driving. It's probably better that I walk. I can drop your bags off down at the motel for you. Thanks. Both of you, thanks. Bye. - Pretty thing. - Yeah. No meat on her, though. Women nowadays, you know, they just starve off all the curves. Meatloaf's the special today. Comes with mashed potatoes, green beans and a biscuit. I'll just have tea, thanks. You looking to make some money? I saw you staring at the sign. I'm just passing through. Are you really looking for a cook? Old one got fired a couple of days ago. - Joanie. - What? Someone here on the job. She's the owner. - I'm Linda-Gail, by the way. - I'm Reece. I saw your sign in the window. - Reece what? - Gilmore. - You cook, Reece Gilmore? - Yes. For a living, or just to put something in your mouth? Both. - Where you from? - Boston. Long way to come to look for a job. My car broke down, so I'm kind of stuck here. How long you been on the road? Is this relevant? A little over a year. Maybe it's time you got stuck somewhere. Next order, steak sandwich, medium well, fried onions, mushrooms, fries and slaw. If Doc doesn't drop dead after eating what you cook, you got the job. Come around the back. Hi. Order up! Ruben, club san, two side salads. Make it quick. I'll pay you $8 an hour. We open at 6:30, so you need to be here at 6:00. We serve breakfast all day. Joanie, I'm only staying until my car is fixed. Well, then what? How far are you gonna get with no money? You wouldn't be wanting a job if you were flush. Lunch is 11:00 to 3:00. Dinner's 5:00 to 7:00. Last shift, cook cleans the stove, the grill and does the lock-down. I don't pay overtime. Now, there's an apartment behind the restaurant. It ain't much, but if you want it, I'll deduct the rent from your pay. I can't close. I can open. I can work any shift. I can work doubles, I just... I can't close. I'm sorry. - Afraid of the dark? - Something like that. Well, fair enough. What about the apartment? I'm gonna check into the Mayfield. Well, you go get yourself settled there. You always hire strangers? Well, everyone's a stranger, one time or another. Have something to eat, on the house. - You need your room done? - No, thanks. Busier than usual for a Saturday afternoon. Everyone's here to check out the new cook. Mac. Doc. Even the sheriff's taking a look. Some of us have a bet going. Pete thinks you're on the run from the law. Mac thinks there's an abusive husband. Me? I think you got your heart broke back East. - Any of us hit? - Nope, sorry. Just at loose ends, traveling. Something in there. To my eye, you got heartbreak written all over you. Speaking of heartbreakers. His name's Brody. Comes in three times a week. Tips 20%. - He's a writer. - What kind? Folks say he worked for a paper in Chicago as a reporter but got fired. Now he writes mystery books. Where did you learn to cook like that, young lady? The Culinary Institute in Vermont. And a year in Paris. - It's Reece. - I'll be back for breakfast. Thanks, Doc. - See you, Doc. - See you, Doc. Thank you. Hey, there. You must be the new girl. You're in my way. Feisty new girl. - Reece. - Reece. Girl with a guy's name. I like that. William Butler. Works out at the Circle K Ranch. He goes by Lo, short for "Lothario," which he got labeled with when he was a teenager and proceeded in making it his life's work to bed every female within 100 miles. - And you're telling me this because... - Well, he's come here to have a look at you. I can't imagine there's much to see right now. You're young, female, as far as it goes, unattached. That's all it takes. Well, don't worry. I'm not looking for a man, temporarily or permanently, and especially one who uses his prick as a compass. - William. - Ma. - Hey, Brody. - Hey, Mac. - What do you think of Joanie's new cook? - The food's good. Not what I meant. Car broke down, she's putting up at motel. Pays cash by the day. No credit cards could mean she doesn't want to leave a trail. 10 bucks, he sweet-talks her and beds her within a week. I'll take your bet, just so it costs you. Heading home? - You're kind of jumpy. - No. Yeah, I didn't see you. Mind if I walk with you? I'm fine. We could go grab a beer. You could tell me your life story. My life story isn't worth the price of a drink. You're a tough sell. Maybe we'll do it some other time. Yeah? That would be great. - I'll hold you to that. - Okay, thanks for the offer. You're welcome. Got to go. Lo keep you up last night? He's got a reputation for endurance. I wouldn't know. He just walked me to the corner. - What's this, a coffee klatch? - Reece didn't sleep with Lo. No offense, but is this some sort of secret town tradition? I mean, if being a slut is part of the job, I'd better be making much more than 8 bucks an hour. The slut clause is voluntary. He's very cute, but nothing happened. Well, that's a first. - Is she upset with me? - No, she's upset with the whole situation. She's loved Lo ever since they were kids and he loves her, too. But his way of dealing with it is to dick around so he doesn't have to think about her. I wish they'd quit circling around, just get down to giving me some grandkids. Lynt called about your car. The part he needed is on back-order. Great. I'm guessing from your overwhelming response that you might be a few dollars short. How about a two-week cash advance? - Well, that's very generous. - Generous, hell. It's my way of making you stick, at least awhile. Well, if I stay, the motel isn't working for me. You want the apartment? - Let's go look. - Okay. It's right around back. Here it is. It could use some tidying. And it could use some paint. It's got decent light. And the rent's due on the first of the month. I'd rather pay by the week. - Doesn't matter to me. - Thank you, for everything. No need for gratitude. Let me get this said. I don't like depending on anyone, but you're the best cook I've ever had. And I figure on making use of that. Especially if you don't go rabbiting off on me some night and leave me flat. Now, I'm gonna ask you straight out. - You got the law after you? - No. I didn't think so. People around here get to speculating. Open it. Oh! It's beautiful. You know, a long time ago I made a mistake. I married a man who wasn't good for much but being handsome. He was damn good-looking, but he wasn't good for me and our boy. And once I was gone, he never came looking. No one will come looking for me. That's all I need to know. You got the key. I won't leave you flat. And if I need to go, I will tell you beforehand. Fair enough. I'll be right down. - I'll get you a box. - Oh, that's okay. Just take a second. Mac? Mr. Drubber? Oh! Thanks. I can open you an account. Joanie gave me an advance. You know, I don't need the camera, but I will take a map. Housewarming gift. - Be right with you, Brody. - Thank you. Reece is moving into the apartment behind Joanie's. For now. Why don't you help her haul this stuff back over there? - He sort of put you on the spot. - Yeah, he did. Well, you really are a city girl. That was just a truck backfiring. You should be here during hunting season. Sorry. And that completes the entertainment portion of this program. - I'm Reece, by the way. - I know. I'm Brody. I thank you for not asking any questions. - Would you have answered? - No. You're staring. Glancing. Connected glances equals a stare. Oh, I'm sorry. Professional pitfall. Writers observe. That was very rude of me. That's okay. You can dedicate your next book to me. Who decides what's rude, anyway? PRS. The Prevention of Rudeness Society. Didn't they disband? No. They continue their good work in secret locations across the country. - So, what do you write? - Mysteries. - Are you writing one now? - Researching right now. I'm trying to find the perfect spot for a murder. I'm thinking high up in the park. Nobody's on the trail this early in the spring. He gets her, he pushes her and she falls a long, long way. Don't kill the woman. I'm just trying to steer you away from the obvious clich?. Everybody thinks they're a writer. Oh. Thanks. Just put that there. Well, if you want me to leave, just ask. Would you? Leave? Can I use your bathroom? Sure. No, it can wait. What's the special at Joanie's tonight? Probably something fried with potatoes. Oh, forgot my milk. I'll catch you later. - Hey, Doc. - Hey, Brody. Hey. Here's that $10 I owe you. - God! Oh, God! - Reece, are you okay? He killed her. He killed her. I saw it. - I saw it. She's dead. - What? Who's dead? I saw it. I wasn't dreaming. It wasn't Ginny at the river. - Who's Ginny? - No, the other woman. I saw him kill her. Look, I can't understand you. What happened? Take a deep breath. I saw a hawk. I saw a hawk. I had the binoculars. I was looking around and there was this couple, and they were fighting, and he knocked her down. - I've got to get out of here. - Finish telling me. - I saw him strangle her. - Take me there. No. - She could still be alive. - No, she's dead. There's nothing we can do for her now. I'll call the sheriff from my cabin. It's right down the hill. I couldn't really see him. He had on sunglasses and a baseball cap. - It was orange like a hunter's hat. - Okay. And his back was to me. She had black or brown... I think it was brown. It was brown, straight hair. You said "Ginny." Did she look like Ginny? A friend of yours? No. No, there's no Ginny. Okay. What about the man? - Was he white? - Yes. What about his hair? Like I said, it was under a hat. I couldn't really tell. What about you, Brody? You see anything? No, I was coming down the mountain. I saw her running, but I didn't see anything else. Excuse me. Yeah. Yeah, I'm leaving right now. Sorry, I gotta get down there. - Did they find anything? - No. Nothing yet. Show me again on this map where you were. Here. - Right there? - Yeah. Well, that's a pretty good distance from where you were and the couple. No, that's... But that's the place. All right. I'll let my deputies know. I understand your car is in for repair. Yeah, it'll be done soon. Well, I'm gonna need you to stick around town for a little while. Hopefully no more than a few days. You think of anything, anything at all, you let me know. Don't worry about this, Reece. We're gonna get this sorted out. Thank you. I was on the Old Ridge trail about 100 yards from there when I ran into her. Okay, I'll call you later. Jeez. And they say deer are harmless. Come on, I'll take you home. - You wrote this. - Yeah. Keep it. You know, I can walk. Sorry, I've put you to a lot of trouble. You're damn right. Now get in. Can you be any more rude or insensitive? A woman was murdered today. You know, strangled to death? Do you get it? Instead of being outraged or sympathetic or anything even remotely human, you're snippy. Acting like it doesn't matter. Well, it matters. She matters. Go to hell. I was wondering if you had anything approaching a normal temper in there? And, FYI, guys are incapable of snippiness. Next time, use "callous." That works. - You're an irritating and confusing man. - That works, too. Aren't reporters supposed to be sort of personable? You know, to get information out of people? - You'll note, I'm not a reporter anymore. - Oh. I'm a snippy novelist. Teeth. I knew you had them, I just... I've never seen them. You know, are you hungry? 'Cause I can make something. - No. It's getting late. - It won't take long. Another time. I don't want to be alone. I don't know if anyone's ever told you this, but you can cook. I heard a rumor. - Where did you learn? - Paris. But you already know that 'cause Doc Wallace told you. Actually, it was Mac who told Doc. You haven't picked up the small town rhythm yet, have you? Well, you don't talk about yourself very much. I haven't noticed you ponying up any information. What do you want to know? - Have you ever been married? - Almost. No. Why almost? 'Cause I was too committed to my job. And she left me for a commodities broker. - And you? - No. Why not? Just too committed to my job. Period. Have you ever thought about opening your own restaurant? Oh, yeah, a long time ago, but I'm happy just cooking now. But I would be happier if I could get Joanie to get better ingredients. You know, everyone at Joanie's is talking about us right now. Yeah, they saw my car parked out front. What was a convenient parking job has now turned into a raging affair. Seems to be an intramural sport around here, speculating on people. Like you betting Mac that Lo would be sleeping with me within a week? - Maybe you are getting the rhythm. - Maybe. - Hey. - Rick. - Brody. - Did you find her? - We didn't find anything. - What do you mean? No body. Nothing. Well, maybe he threw her in the river or buried her. Well, we're gonna look into that, but there also wasn't a sign of any struggle. I don't understand. Look, it was dark out there, I'm gonna go back in the morning. Meanwhile, I'm gonna go to the station, make some calls, see if there's any female tourists or residents missing. You know, Joanie's cabins are up there. Maybe you should check there. Well, if someone was there, it'd be easy enough to tell. Look, I don't want you worrying about this, Reece. - Tonight there's nothing more you can do. - Okay. - Thanks, Rick. - Thank you. - Enjoy your dinner. - Thanks. Thanks. He might have been at the wrong location. He said it was getting dark. Look, if you want to go back, we'll go back tomorrow... - Really? - Yeah, but if you don't want to... No, no, I want to. I must have been off in my direction. - We'll figure this out. Okay? - Okay. See you. Hey, Brody. I didn't know you two were dating. Well, dinner's a loose interpretation of dating. Look, someone new comes to town, I gotta make sure they're clean. Right. There's something I need to tell you about Reece. It's not pretty. A couple of years ago she was working at a restaurant that got shot up in a spree killing. She's the only survivor. Jesus. Lead investigator said he stayed in contact with her for almost a year, but then she disappeared. Obviously, it's something she doesn't want people to know about. When people go through a trauma like that they... Hallucinate? Well, no, but they react in ways we can't understand. So you think she's lying about the murder? No. No, absolutely not. But I'm gonna need some evidence. A body, something. Meanwhile, all I can do is keep checking with missing persons, see if anyone turns up matching the description Reece gave me. Look, I gotta go. Deb's gonna have my head. I'm already late for dinner. I just... - I just wanted you to know. That's all. - Thanks. I can't be doing this again. - Morning. - Morning. - Hey. - Morning. - Lo told us. - Told you what? Rick was out at the guest ranch, where Lo works, asking about any missing guests. He told Lo about the murder you saw. All your friends killed like that. Wait. What did Rick tell Lo? Rick told him about the murder you saw by the river. - And the ones before, in Boston. - No wonder you ran away. - Nice job, Linda-Gail. - Why? What did I say? So, who knows? Now, how I'd approach that question is, who doesn't know? - So I guess, then, they also know that... - Rick didn't find a body yet. Doesn't mean he won't. I think what's got most people concerned, me included, is how you're doing. I wish you'd told me about Boston. - It's not something I like to talk about. - Fair enough. You leaving town now? I'm a stubborn bitch most of the time, but I know damn well what it's like to pick up and leave a bad situation. It takes time to find a place of your own. How did you know Angels Fall was yours? I didn't. It was just someplace better than where I'd been. And then one morning I woke up and it was mine. That's when I stopped looking behind. You need some time? Brody was gonna take me back to the river. Take the whole day. We'll manage. It's a good place to die. No place is. The sheriff was right. There's no sign of a struggle. Tell me what happened. - She was standing here... - No. Back in Boston. That night there was supposed to be a surprise going-away party. I was starting a new job as head chef at a new restaurant. I mean, I had no personal life, just the people at Maneo's. And that was my family. So when I came through the back door, I knew something was wrong, horribly wrong. Oh my God! No! He shot me. Twice. Then he shot my best friend, Ginny. And I did nothing. I watched her die. And then I waited to die. You know, there's nothing you could have done. Rick told you all this because he didn't believe me. - I'm gonna go talk to him. - I'm gonna go with you. No. Thanks. Morning. I wondered if you had any news. Well, on the good news front, everyone in Angels Fall is accounted for, as are the visitors, and there's been no missing persons matching the description of the woman you described. No one knows she's missing yet. It's only been a day. Well, I'm gonna keep checking. You think I'm imagining this. I think you've had a couple of bad years. It has no bearing on this. Well, you look good enough to eat there, yourself, Slim. What if what you saw triggered something in you? Something that made you project the past into the present. - Like what? - Something that scared and upset you. Like maybe an argument. Maybe that woman by the river, she just simply walked away as you went running down the trail. No. - Rick? - Hey, baby. Nice surprise. This is my wife, Debbie. Absolute sunshine of my life. Debbie, this is Reece Gilmore. It's nice to meet you, Reece. You know, I am so sorry to hear about your trouble. I know what I saw, Sheriff. That woman was dead. Reece, come on in. Hey, hey. What did Rick say? Nothing. Listen, let him do his job. Don't be depressed. Come on, I wanna show you something. Outside. You know, I thought I would just pass through, pick up a little work, move on. And now I'm stuck. No. If you want to go, go. Here, take my car. I can always buy another one. Seriously, you want to go, go. You worried about the murder? Just hire yourself a lawyer, give a detailed deposition, come back for the trial. Seriously, don't let anyone hold you back from your continued suffering. You know, sooner or later, you got to land somewhere. This is as good a place as any. You know, I'd just like to make it through the day. You know, when you're cooking, you're happy. What else is going to make you happy? - Brody. - Yeah? My mind hasn't been focused in this area in a long time. What area is that? I think we both know the neighborhood, you know, being intimate in terms of physical contact. Well, why don't you say you haven't been laid in a while? Obviously, I don't have your elegance with words. Right. No sex. How about food? Why don't you cook me dinner tonight? There's a lot you don't know about me. I have issues, lots of them. You don't want to get involved. It's just dinner, that's all. Make some small talk. We'll tell some lies, have some laughs. You know, not everything's life and death. Sometimes there's just fun. Lose something? Your door was open. You okay? Yeah. I mean, I'm just in a hurry. I'm going to Brody's for dinner. - Brody? - Yeah. Well, I guess you don't want to get a beer with me and Lo, then. He's making nice with me. Of course, all things considered, it seems like Brody's making real nice with you. It's just dinner, you know, meal, small talk, and laughs, lies. - Well, have fun, darling. - You, too. - So, where did you get these? - I made them, idiot. - Like, from flour? - From flour. Well, these are a lot better than you get from the kind that pop out of a can. Okay, let me guess what's in your kitchen. Frozen pizza, beer, for sure. A couple of cans of chili, hot dogs and, oh, Hungry-Man dinners. You forgot the mac and cheese. Okay. You know, it's been a long time since I've had candles at a dinner, or a tablecloth, or a beautiful woman to share it with. Everyone's beautiful in candlelight. What, am I not allowed to pay you a compliment? Oh, well, didn't you know that lack of confidence is the new black? But thank you. Were you always this difficult? "Were"? Like, as in past tense, as in before... No, no, no, like "were," as in "difficult," as in before the shooting? Yeah, something like that has got to change someone. It's got to affect you in ways that no one can understand. - So you know about the other thing. - Yeah. - And Rick told you? - No, Rick didn't tell me. - I did some research. - Wait a minute... I looked online. You went to whatever extent to find this out? What do you want know specifically? Like how long I was in the nuthouse? Or what it's actually like to get electroshock therapy? They still do it. Look, I didn't mean anything by that. But, Reece, talk to me. - You say that, but you don't really mean it. - Oh, you're right. I'm lying. I'm only interested in the sex. Oh, wait a minute. That's right. We're not having sex. Come on, Reece. You need somebody to talk to. I'm right here. Talk to me. After the shootings, I went to live with my aunt. I tried to grasp onto something, you know, work, religion. And every time I reached out, I ended up empty-handed. You know, then there was the flashbacks and the night terrors and the sleepwalking. I do things that I don't know. Then I was at... I was in the MacClean Psychiatric Hospital for six months. Right. Then after that, I just... I had to get out of there. I didn't want to be blank anymore. I didn't want to take the pills. So, I still have them, you know, just in case. Souvenirs from the edge. So now you're just neurotic and anal? Oh, yeah, and claustrophobic, obsessive-compulsive and a little bit paranoid. Strangely, it's kind of a turn-on. - You're not gonna tell Rick? - No, I'm not gonna tell Rick. But I'm sure he's gonna find out on his own. If he didn't believe me before, he's never gonna believe me now. Did you know Doc was a good artist? I mean, good is overstating. But if you give a description of the woman that was murdered, I bet he can make a sketch of it. Why are you doing this? - Why are you getting so involved? - It's a mystery. - I'm good at mysteries. - You really do believe me. Yeah, I do. We're in this together, Slim. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Well, somebody's in a good mood this morning. Yes, I am. And since I'm in such a good mood, I think it's time we have that little talk. - What talk? - The talk about fresh herbs. Joanie, this is not basil. This is a desiccated memory of basil. - We need to use fresh herbs. - "We"? You. Oh, man! A glass busted in the water. Well, don't be bleeding all over my kitchen floor. Like I have a choice. Where's... Where's Pete? - How many fingers? - Two. Getting a couple of stitches. Oh, you got a nice egg on the back of your head. I'm fine. Just let me stand up. - Only if you go home and rest. - No, I'm fine. - No. - I'm fine. Go, now. Slow. Okay. Not again. Tell me I didn't do this. The lips are a little fuller. The chin is a little pointier and her eyes aren't so round. They're a little longer. Is this the woman you saw murdered? - That's good. - Doesn't look like anyone I know. I'll make copies of this, then we'll pass it out. I like that you wear bowties. That's Susan's doing, my wife. She thought it made me look more the part, you know, small town doctor-like. I hate them. But I figured she might haunt me if I change things. The fact is, after a long day, I still talk things over with her. Some people might think that's crazy. I think it's just human. I appreciate you trying to put me at ease. Just making conversation. I was in a psychiatric hospital for six months. - Oh? - I was just trying to make conversation. You look tired. Do you need something to help you sleep? Is that why I'm really here? Brody thinks I need drugs? - I don't know what Brody thinks. - I won't do drugs. I won't go back there. - I'd rather deal with my anxiety. - Are you? Anxious? To the point that I want to leave town, every day, yeah, but I don't. I'm just scared. It's all happening again. What is? Lost time. Doing things I don't remember. Like, last night, I packed up everything, but I didn't go anywhere. I'm sure that's a big minus on my mental health chart, but I offset it with a plus, by unpacking. What you're describing sounds like classic post-traumatic stress. People who witness life-threatening events can relive the experience through nightmares and flashbacks. Didn't run yesterday. Didn't run today. That's big for me. - Good girl. - Yeah. So, I have something to tell you. I started your book. I like it. I mean, I like Jack, the screw-up. And I hope he doesn't end up dead, you know, 'cause I'm really rooting for him and Leah to end up together. It's great. It was orange. Like a hunter's cap. Hey. - What's your problem? - Where did you get that cap? They give them away at the guest ranch during hunting season. Everybody's got one. Come on. Is he a good kisser? I'm not telling. - Yes. - I knew it. I knew it. - Oh, hey, when's your next day off? - Wednesday. Then Wednesday, we're going to Jackson. I know a great salon. And, honey, no offense, but you could use some work. Come on, it'll be fun. Yeah, you know what? I'll think about it. I'll be right back. - Linda-Gail. How's it going? - Good. Yeah. I got a cancellation tomorrow out at the ranch. And I just... I thought maybe I could saddle up a couple of horses and we could check out the backcountry, if you're not busy. Yeah, if it's nice. - If it's nice, yeah. - Yeah. Okay, I'll see you. What? Reece, we know about the psychiatric hospital. You're gonna fire me? Well, if you keep cooking the way you've been cooking, I don't care if you come to work wearing only an aluminum foil hat and singing show tunes. - You're not on any drugs, are you? - No. I... So now you have a real reason not to believe me. It's not about what I believe. It's about facts. - The facts are I don't have a body. - Or the crazy woman made it up. - Reece, just... - Wait, look. - What? - Doc drew this. It's the woman I saw killed. I am not imagining things. - What do you want me to do with this? - Show it around. Reece, nothing against Doc's artistic talent, but this is rough. Without more detail, you're going to find loads of people think they recognize her. It's something. Yeah, it is. All right, I'll get it out. See what comes back. That's all I'm asking. - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing here? You're crushing my berries. Oh, God. Oh, it won't come off. Come on. - It won't come off. It's not coming off. - Reece. Reece. - It's happening all over again. - What is? This! Doing things I don't remember, like food in the closet! Packing! - Reece, when did this start happening? - After the murder. It started happening right after the murder. Just like after the shootings. - I need... I need to get back to the hospital. - You just need to calm down. No! No! No! This is what crazy people do! You're not crazy. You're not. - You didn't do this. - Yeah, then who did? Someone who wants you to think you're crazy. - What is this? - Scotch. Drink it. Oh. Okay, who would want to make me think I'm crazy? And why would someone want to do that to me? You ever seen the movie Gaslight? Oh, this is why I'm attracted to you. I'm regressing to a fugue state, writing all over my apartment, and you mention a 50-year-old movie? Is that a yes? Charles Boyer tries to drive his wife Ingrid Bergman crazy. Does that sound familiar? But why? Who would be the most invested person in wanting you to seem crazy? Who would want the whole town not to believe a word that you say? I don't know. - How about the killer? - Come on. A crime of passion is committed in the wilderness where no one's supposed to see it, but there's a witness. Then all the way across town the gossip starts. The witness has a history of psychological problems caused from a previous violent crime. But, damn, if she isn't plucky. She insists she saw something. So if you're the killer, you got to make it seem as though she's lying or nuts. Why not just kill me? 'Cause if you end up dead, then everyone's got to take you serious. It's better to push you into insanity, have everyone doubting you. - You actually make it seem plausible. - But wait, there's more. The map, the shoes in the refrigerator, the things on the wall, no one else was supposed to see them. They were intended for you and for you alone. You know I think it's easier to believe that I'm relapsing than to try and swallow your mystery writer plot. You don't make anything easy. That's an odd thing to say to a woman who's been trying to survive. A woman who survived after all her friends were killed. She was left in the dark, bleeding to death. Everything was taken from you for no rhyme or reason. It's a miracle you have any shred of sanity. So stop feeling sorry for yourself. Start fighting back. I don't know how. You're one of the strongest people I've ever met. Thank you. Brody painting your apartment? - How do you know these things? - Well, Mac came in for a cup of coffee. Said he saw Brody filling up for gas on his way to get paint. Now, Brody's car is out front. Okay. He's doing me a favor. Don't recall Brody doing the same for any other woman. - You recall him doing the same, Pete? - Can't say I do. - Fine. We've slept together. - Sweet. I don't recall Brody painting for any other woman he slept with. Maybe 'cause I'm better in bed. You ever paint a girl's apartment? No, but I did move a really big refrigerator once. Oh, yeah. For that married gal. Like I didn't know. Yeah, well, maybe Ma didn't. Lo, honey, there ain't nothing I can say that she hasn't already known or thought about you. So you had an affair with a married woman? - It was all so mysterious. - Shut up, Linda-Gail. A month ago, he disappeared for days. Then as fast as it started, I heard it was over. No name, no details whatsoever. Except someone saw them riding horses across the river once. Brown-haired girl. - What you laughing at, Pete? Huh? - Nothing. - It was a mistake, Linda-Gail. - The affair, or getting caught? So, what happened to the woman? Guess she got saddle sore. Something like that. - Hey. - Hey. Wow. It's... It's blue. - You're a regular Van Gogh. - Well, it isn't blue actually. It's azure. It's the color of the Caribbean. It's soothing. It's warm. - It's calming. - You're a very odd man. But thank you. That was sweet. I'll meet you back at your place. Where are you going? If someone's trying to do this to me, he's not gonna be stopped until he's found, and she's the key to getting him. - So you're gonna put those up? - No, I'm getting a facial. So, does everyone in town know I've been in a psychiatric hospital? Pretty much. And now they think I'm imagining seeing someone killed. Not everyone. Hey, did I tell you? Me and Lo are getting married. Course he don't know it yet, but I'm real good at projects. - Oh, you have amazing skin. - Thank you. - Hey, you see a lot of women. - Sweetheart, women see me. Yeah, anyway, could you show this around? She's missing. God, another runaway housewife? Yes, yes, yes. Now stop talking. You'll crack. Too late for that. I already cracked a couple of years ago. No way. I just filled this thing up. Shit. It's okay. It's all right. It's me. Reece, calm down. I didn't mean to scare you. - You all right? - Reece. Is everything okay? I saw your note at Brody's. I came looking for you. We found someone. A woman, a body. You were right, Reece. Come on, let's get out of here. We should tell him about your apartment and about the gas that was siphoned out of my car. I need to be a credible witness. That's what the police want, credibility. - It's all credible. - Oh, okay. "Hey Rick, you know how I was crazy before? "Well, the killer thinks I'm crazy, too. And he's trying to drive me insane." "Oh, how's that, Reece?" "Well, he got into my apartment, "he put day-glow paint all over, and he siphoned the gas out of Brody's car." And he put all those X's on the photographs. Actually I did that. Before. - I see your point. - Thank you. Sorry I scared you, Reece. Are those the pictures? They're not easy to look at, so take your time. She was in the woods for a couple of days before the kids found her. A day or two? It's been weeks since she was killed. That's if she was killed the day Reece saw her. She could have been taken some place, killed later. - She was younger. - Reece, you were a long ways away. This is not her. It's not the woman I saw killed. I heard about the woman they found. With your history, it must be a little rough on you. A lot rougher on her, I'd say. - At least you know they found her. - It isn't her. Have you ever tried aromatherapy? 'Cause nothing soothes me like a little lavender oil after a hot bath. I'm sure it would help with the confusion. - Anything else, Reece? - I think I've had about all I can take. Lunch is slow. Take your break. No. I owe you time. Plus, we're low on potato salad. You know, Joanie, we should really use some fresh dill. Customers don't give a rat's ass about fresh dill. Well, they should. And you should. No, we're in the make-do business. Not make-better, make-do. Oh, I'm tired of settling for less. What is stuck in your craw? Joanie, why would Lo be taking stuff out of a cabin near the lake? - You mean one of my cabins? - Yeah. Getting ready for hunting season, he does it every year. Oh. Well, have you ever met the married woman he had an affair with? - What? - Have you? Once. - What happened to her? - Get out of my kitchen. - I'm sorry. I... - Not my son. You cannot place your imaginary murder on my son. Get back to work. - You having a party? - Yep, I am. Care to join me? - What the occasion? - I quit. Oh, why? You know what your problem is? This. Just one chair. You actually live your life hoping that no one will ever show up. Well, you're in a fine mood. Yeah, well, if I left, the only thing you'd miss is a decent, hot meal. At least there's something. Screw you. - Where are you going? - I don't know. Come on. This is my mother's recipe. It's kind of famous. You open a can, you heat it, then you pour it in a bowl. Thank you. - I'm so sorry. - Shut up and eat. Brody, it's time for me to move on. I've overstayed my welcome. - On many levels. - Where would you go? - I don't know. - Good plan. I have feelings for you, and everything's great right now, but I'm worried that it won't be enough in the long run. - Well, I can't promise more. - More? Oh, my gosh, I would be happy if I could just leave my toothbrush and not feel guilty about it. - You can leave your toothbrush. - I'm not talking about my toothbrush. Well, why did you bring up your toothbrush? I don't... Listen. After the murder or because of... Because of the murder and my past, I think you're like protector guy, you know, like a hero from one of your books, and I... You want me to stay because I have no place to go. You want me to stay so you can take care of me. I want to stay because you need me. Forget it. - No, no, no, no. It's okay. - Stay. Stay. I made a list of possible suspects. - Lo and Debbie Marsden? - Yeah. I just... I put her there 'cause I don't really like her. Well, you can take Lo off the list, too. Lo had an affair with a married woman and it ended badly. - Doesn't make him a killer. - What about the hat? - Everyone in town has that hat. - Okay. After the killing, he wasn't as nice to me. Okay, I'll chalk that one up to being the town loony. But there's still the fact that I saw Lo cleaning out one of Joanie's cabins. And even Rick said it. You know, the killer might have put the woman somewhere. Maybe Lo took her there and then cleaned up all the evidence. Okay, what if it was Miss Scarlet in the library with the candlestick? It's not Lo. - How do you know? - I know Lo. "I know Lo." Reece? - Reece. - He's out there. Who? - Reece. - He's out there. Give me the knife. Give me the knife. Get inside. Lock the door. Lock the door. Reece, open up. It's okay. He's gone. It's okay. I called the sheriff. - He must have been watching the house. - What "he"? There's no evidence he was in the cabin or anywhere near the cabin. - You didn't see him, I didn't see him. - But Reece saw him. And you're sleeping with her, so you gotta believe her. To me, she's just a woman with an emotional disorder who claims she's seen the same man she saw kill some unknown woman only she's seen. Look, do us all a favor, Brody, talk her into getting some help. - I thought better of you, Rick. - I thought better of you, Brody. You know, I'm tired of answering every time Reece Gilmore cries wolf. Now you call me when there's a real crime. I've got better things to do. - Rick's not gonna be much help. - I don't care. Get your coat on. - Why? - We're spending the night in Jackson. Someone named Marlie called. She knows the girl in the sketch. We'll hook up with her first thing in the morning. I called you right away. The minute Serge showed me your drawing, I knew it was her. Deena James. She used to live in the apartment above me. Used to? Left town right before I started working here. Wrote a letter to the super, told him to sell all her stuff, she was gone. - How come? - We weren't exactly friends. - She was a stripper. - Stripper. Yeah, you know, takes clothes off for a living. Not the sort of person I want around my kid. Sure. Then she got a guy she called "Trout." Get it? Her fish on the line. - Did you ever see him? - Not him or his car. He bought her stuff, though. Deena used to go around showing off this necklace he gave her. She said it was mother of pearl and diamonds. Looked like a little half-circle surrounded by rhinestones to me. Was supposed to be the moon. Trout called Deena his dark side of the moon. - Well, whatever happened to the Trout? - I have no idea. Must have dropped her, I guess. Never saw him again. Deena Black is involved with a man who doesn't want to be seen with her yet he's in deep enough to buy her jewelry. - She didn't love him. - How do you know that? "The Trout"? No woman talks about a man she loves that way. He's married. He wants to break it off. Deena sees a good thing coming to an end and pushes him. - He pushes back. - Pushes until it kills her. How many jewelry stores do you think there are in Jackson Hole? Too many. ...travel advisories will be put into effect in the mountains and passes and the state transportation and safety crews will be upgraded to working in 24-hour shifts... Good afternoon. Is there something I might show you? Well, I certainly hope so. We've been to five other stores. A friend of mine had a necklace and I'm trying to find the same one. It's a moon pendant with mother of pearl and diamonds. Well, it could have been part of our Universe of Gems series. We had several pieces designed last year with moons, stars, suns, planets. Perhaps if your friend came in with the necklace? Her name is Deena James. She's missing. And the necklace is all we have on her. - Are you with the police? - No. Well, in that case, I'm afraid I can't give you any more information. - Is that Lo? - Where? Why would he be in Jackson Hole on the same day we are? - Well, a lot of people come to Jackson. - No, he was following us. Okay, finally I'm going to say it. You're crazy. If Lo didn't do it, who else did? Look, older men fall for women like Deena, not punks like Lo. I'm gonna talk to Rick, see if he can pull some strings with the Jackson police. But until then you need to cool your jets. - Why? - Because if it is Lo, things could get dicey if he knows how close we are. Hey. - Hey. - I hate men. They're all lying, cheating dogs, and Lo is the biggest liar-cheater of them all. Last night, he told me he had to stay at the ranch helping out a colicky mare. Was he? No. Ruben passed by not 15 minutes ago asking me how I liked the movie last night. The movie Lo supposedly took me to. He said he loved me and now he's out catting around. - I saw him in Jackson Hole. - With who? No one. - He was alone? - Yeah. - Alone alone? - I only saw him for a second. It must be part of the surprise. Lo said he had a surprise for me and not to tell anyone. Don't go. What are you talking about? Of course I'm gonna go. When you, when... When you get there, could you just call me when you get wherever and Lo tells you the surprise? Just call me. - What's wrong with you? - I'm worried. That's all. You're worried? About Lo? Why? Just... Please just call me, Linda-Gail. All right. Forecasters say this early winter storm will drop temperatures into the 20s and produce an average of six to 10 inches of snow across the state. With the 18 to 22 inches expected to come down in the local mountains... Hello? You got my message? Listen, I know this is going to sound crazy, but today at Jackson Hole with Reece... Where? Okay, sure. Joanie? I was really a bitch the other day. I had no right to insult you or Lo, and I just jumped on you and Brody because you're the closest, and I'm so, so sorry. I can take almost anything. But I will never hear you talk about Lo like that again. Unless things don't go so well with Linda-Gail. Then whatever you thought about Lo will be nothing to the pounding I give him for breaking that girl's heart. I'll tell you one thing. I hope they get their feelings all sorted. 'Cause this whole "Everything's sunshine, roses and moonbeams" is not working for me. Linda-Gail and Lo, you and Brody. What did you say? - You and Brody. - No, no, no. "Sunshine and moonbeams." God, I'm so stupid. I gotta go. Has this got anything to do with Lo? 'Cause if you're still suspecting him... Lo? You gotta promise me you're not gonna scream. Do you promise? Oh, my God. Is this why you were in Jackson yesterday? Buying all these flowers? How did you know that I was in Jackson? No, that's not why. This is why. Linda-Gail, I'm sick and tired of lurking outside of that restaurant, watching you close the place just so I can feel close to you. I'm done wasting my time on wild women. I love you. I really do, I love you. And I'm willing to work hard for the rest of my life to make you happy. - If you'll have me, I will. - Yes. - Yeah? - Yes, a million times, yes, yes! - Reece. - I knew it. That necklace. - What? - You're his sunshine. I heard him say it. He said you are the sunshine in his life. Brody? Where's Brody? - What happened? - His head ran into the back of a shovel. When he comes to, we're all gonna take a hike. - We're not going anywhere. - Oh, sure, you are. You see, it's part of your plan. Part of the murder-suicide pact you made after you snapped. First you drugged Brody. Here are your pills. Then you shot him, shot yourself with a gun you took from Joanie's desk. - I already called the state police. - No, you haven't. Why did you kill Deena James? - You just wouldn't let it go, would you? - Was she blackmailing you? - Or threatening you? - It was supposed to be sex. Just one night. Things a man can't do with his wife. Something about her got to me. The dark and the light. Asking, demanding money. I... The river, you were trying to let her go. - Yeah. - I saw that. She wouldn't listen. She wanted me to leave my wife. - Leave your wife! - It's over. It's not over! When I said I wouldn't, she came at me. I snapped. Then I buried her. I had to cover my tracks. I sent a letter to her super. If Deena was buried, then who was the woman the kids found in the woods? A 43-year-old burnout from Seattle. Almost matched the description of your victim perfectly. Except she wasn't beaten. Anybody else would have barely even looked at those forensic photographs. You. You had to look for details. Why couldn't you just leave? - That's all I wanted. - You didn't have a choice. Damn right, I didn't have a choice. Deena pushed you. I... You were trying to protect yourself and your family... You're right. Protecting my family. I'm on your side. Brody and me, we'll leave. We'll leave tonight. I wish you could. Run, Reece! Run! Get up. Go! You can't hide, Reece! This is my land! My turf! I can track you just as easy as walking down Main Street. Is this what you want? Blow his head off while you're out there hiding and watching? Huh? Now, wait a minute. That scenario sounds familiar, doesn't it? It's already happened to you once in Boston, right? Reece! Get up. Get up! I'm gonna do you a favor. I'm gonna shoot you first. That way you won't have to live through seeing another person die. This is over, Reece. Reece! Shoot me. My life's over anyway. It won't be that easy. You fought back, Reece. You fought back.
