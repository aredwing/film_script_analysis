 

                        Brilliant. Come on. Come on! Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Are you English? Yeah. You speak English? But of course. Oh. Are you alright? Oh, just a little accident. So, do you know that guy? I don't know how you say in English. Stop. How do you.. Stop. You understand? Yeah. No. My name is Veronique. Jack. Where do you go, Jack? I'm just trying to get home. Hmm. I've been down south, just hanging out. Thought it was time to get back. The journey should've taken me a couple of days But the lifts just dried up. Feels like I've walked halfway across France. What about you? You been traveling long? I'm always traveling. It's good for the soul, you know? Gotta keep moving. Yeah. I'm a... I'm a bit of a restless soul myself. Where you headed? Wherever I can get to. You don't have a home? No. Not anymore. I'm sorry. Again. What the fuck. Come on! What is wrong with these people? No, seriously, what the fuck? Je crois que c'est le tueur de la route. I think it's because of the killer of the road. How to translate? Road killer? Yeah, you've heard of him? No. He's famous though. He's a serious killer like, um, Jack the Ripper. You mean a serial killer. Like, really bad things have been happening. Pe... people are scared.. Toute la region est terrorisee, enfin. Like dead people on the road, do you understand? You're not scared? Well, you know.. Safety in numbers. Yes? Un, deux, trois.. Are you serious? And why would you stop? Yeah. Thanks. At least, I hope this is what you mean.. Ah. "Est-ce que tu veux une chaise?" Yeah. Good. It's a bit weird that.. To travel without bags? Well, I lost them. Lost them? Actually they were stolen In the train station in Nice. Worst day ever. Lost everything except my passport. Oh, come on. They don't like you smiling in those things. What's wrong with a little smile? They need to lighten up. I look proper.. - I'm older. - Cool. Ouais, c'est cool. You're not afraid of me? No. How do you know I'm not a killer? It's great. Wondered where you'd got to. Thought you just left. I'm not going anywhere. Cool. I mean, it's fine. Good. Uh, you know how I told you That I lost my, um.. Ouais? My girl.. Ex-girlfriend.. Never mind. S... she just dumped me for my best friend. We had this big plan to meet in Nice And travel all across Europe. Instead, I walked in on their Sweaty, naked bodies.. It was complicated. Like I said worst day ever. Uh, I don't give a shit about it anymore. Come on, let's go! British reg.. Please tell me you're going to England. I can take you as far as I can, but not so far. Oh. I just thought with the registration plate.. La voiture? It's the car of my wife is Anglaise. Veronique! Are you coming or what? Your girlfriend? Could you just give me one minute? Hmm. Veronique.. Safety in numbers, remember? Okay. All the way to England with nothing? Long story. Ah ah je vais pointer ah ah ah Pres d chez moue Ah ah ah dans mon caeur Thought it was a bit quiet. You know? This engine sounds beautiful. - What was that? - Mon die... Restez la, je vais aller voir.. What did he say? "- He said, Stay in the car." Sorry, I laugh from the nerves. Poor thing. Mistakes happen. We should bury it. I'll deal with it. I have nowhere to go. Fair enough. Hmm. Well, it's getting late. Weather may change. It's not safe on the road in the night. You can stay the night with me. My wife likes to have English company. That's very kind, but I've really got to get back. I'm supposed to be visiting my parents. They'll be worried. I understand. Parents worry. That's what they do. They're dead. Veronique, I'm so sorry. Don't be sorry. It was a long time ago. That is very sad. Parents.. They are important. Well, uh, Jack, here is my suggestion You come to my home, my wife, will make, uh, good, uh, food. Tomorrow I will take you where you need to go To Calais for the ferries. You'll be home in the afternoon. Sounds too good to be true, but you know what... Ah mais que je suis con! I forget completely there is a strike in Calais! - Strike? - Mm-hmm. No ferries. Oh, I didn't know. We'll figure something out. No, maybe better to come to my home And I will make you some nice, hot coffee. Actually, I could kill for a cup of tea. Tea? How very... English. Jack, this is a bad idea. Let's just get some food and clean up. We can leave after dinner, yeah? Please. Merci. My wife will be very happy to see you. Jack, and his friend is a poor orphan With nowhere to go. Entrer. Monsieur said you were English. Have you lived in France long? Too long. I lived in England for a while before I ended up here. But I am originally from the States. My husband seems to forget. Oh. It hasn't been used in a while. Your visit is.. Inattendu. Bon die... I didn't have time to clean the room properly. Well, why would I? I mean, you've only just arrived. Anyway.. I hope you'll at least be comfortable. Oh, believe me, anything beats sleeping rough. Oh, but you mustn't do that. It's very dangerous. Yeah, so everyone keeps telling me But it's not everyday you meet someone as kind as you, madame. You can call me Mary. Well, thank you, Mary. Is everything alright? I don't know why I did that, um.. Unexpected. That's the word I was looking for. Please.. Have a rest and freshen up. I'll see if I can find you some clean clothes. We can have a chat later. What do you think of this place? It's cozy. - Cozy? - Yeah. What's your room like? Who cares? Let's get out of this place. I really don't like these people. No. They're alright. I think they're just lonely. They are weird. They didn't even give us the same room. I think they're just a bit old-fashioned. And why do you want to stay in the same room as me anyway? I told you, I'm dangerous. Uh, um, I'm just finishing up here. As soon as you'll be ready. Old-fashioned? A votre sante. As we say in French. Mon amour. Bon appetit. You know, my wife is an excellent, uh.. What's the word in English to say.. I'm afraid my English is rusting. Uh, cuisiniere. - Cook. - Of course! Cook. It hits the nail right on the nose. You mean, on the head. You say tomato, I say open heart surgery. Uh, something wrong? I don't usually eat meat. - Though it does look very good! - Oh! - I'm sorry. I didn't know. - Why didn't you say? - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. - I'll take it off. Yes. Oui. Oh.. Um, we have some salad. No, it's fine, honestly. No. - Are you sure? - No. You don't know what you miss, young man. In life, meat is.. One of the most important pleasure. Not only pleasure, but, you know. We say in France, you know.. Like a truffle, chocolate, chocolate truffle. You should try. Try it. Anyway, how can you imagine such a handsome boy.. Being a Homme-lette. Don't mind him, he's just teasing. Well, no, no.. I.. She speaks. Merci. Oh, my God, what are you doing? Sorry. What's happening? Is there any problem? Or what? - No. - So, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? That's it. I, uh, really appreciate you taking us both in like this. It feels like we've been hitching forever With this road killer business. What did they call him? Le tueur de la route? You've, you've, you've heard of this killer? Well, he's famous. He's a serious killer. Serial killer. I don't. I don't want us to talk about it, okay? It, uh, upsets my wife, you know. They find a body close to here in the last weeks. Young man. Would be same age as you. Okay. I just wondered, you know, it's kind of freaky. He'd been cut up and buried in several pieces. I'm sorry, darling! Oh! - God, I am so sorry. - Oh! It's not your fault. It's not your problem, no. Everybody's upset. People have lost their loved ones.. In many ways. What... what do they know about the killer? Are they any leads? Nothing. But anyway, you're safe here, you know. Really, Jack, don't worry. I'm sorry, I... I must assist my wife. What the hell did you just say to him? Aah, t'es chiant! Look, I'm sorry, okay... I don't want to argue with you. How did you get that scar on your back? I saw it in the shower. Oh, my stepdad. Mum's boyfriend, whatever. Uh, we got into an argument when I was 12. We were on a road trip in France, actually. He lost it, and hit me with a metal bar. I got 10 stitches. Shit. I hit him back, in the face. He didn't bother me again after that. Never actually told anyone about that before. Well, my father never hit me, but.. How did they, you know.. Sorry. No, no, it's okay. They say it's good to talk about it. - Do you understand? - Yeah. You have a brother, right? Frere. It's silly, but I've never been to England. Why don't you come with me then? Yeah. It's not just an empty suggesture? No, it's not an empty gesture. Seriously, come with me. But just for the record.. I wanted to do that since I first saw you. - Liar. - Really. What, when you saw me in the car with that weirdo? Well, maybe it was just a minute after that. - See? - I'm not lying. Can't wait to get back on the road And get out of this weird place. Shit. It's lashing outside. We just missed it. Goodnight, Jack. Goodnight. Are you alright? I'm fine. Come here. I'll be alright, really. - Thanks. - It's the least I could do. I'm sorry. For what? Everything. Dinner. Don't be. It's not your fault. Thank you. What happened to you, Jack? It's complicated. Yeah. It always is. I like your tattoo, by the way. Oh. From when I was young and free. Like a butterfly. It somehow seemed personal to me Like a butterfly reminded me.. Of myself. What can I say? I was young. You're still young. And what's age anyway? Help yourself to anything in the kitchen, Jack. Make yourself at home. No. No. Fuck the medicine! Just fuck them! Do you hear me? I didn't mean to disturb you. You're not disturbing me at all. Come in! I'm sitting here in the dark Alone, by myself. I'm afraid you can no longer go home. I'm sorry? Tomorrow you'll have to stay. What do you mean? - The strike. - Oh, right. By the look of things, the ferries will run again In 2 or 3 days, maybe, at the best. Oh. But as I said, you stay here and make yourself comfortable. I'm not sure. I need to speak to Veronique. We'll see more in the morning. We say, demain est un autre jour. No need to worry. Oh. Well.. That's hardly a crime, is it? Anyway, he put it on the desk. It was just there. I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse me. I'm a bit of a night owl, you know. Anyway, I... I think it's time to go to sleep now. Beautiful house. Must get a bit lonely. Just you two with all this space. It's good for peace of mind. What about your children? Would you like a taste? Such is life. Some things you have, some things not. More than enough, thank you. But then she drinks wine. My wife's artwork is all over the house. Oh, I didn't even realize she was an artist. And you? I am a composer. It's a happy coincidence You two being artists. What kind of music do you compose? I don't believe in coincidence. Just destiny, or inevitability. Right. And you? - Me? - Sure. What do you do? I'm not really sure yet. Uh, I was thinking of studying archaeology. I'm fascinated by what societies from the past have left behind. Hmm. Well, I don't mean to be rude But I don't really understand what you're saying. I should probably go and get some sleep. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Keep your door.. Locked. Hello! Oh, wow! Oui? Hmm. Veronique? Is locked. I was just looking for Veronique. - Elle est partie. - What? I said your friend is gone. - What do you mean she's gone? - She left. She said to tell you goodbye and good luck. No. I don't understand. And you should also leave now. You said you'd give me a lift to Calais. I'm afraid, I won't. I'm changing my plans. - Have you a phone I could use? - No phone. What's that you've got there? Ah. Quoi? Ca.. Where is she? What have you done? Mais de quoi tu parles? What are you talking about? Hmm? What are you worrying about? No point. Relax, Jack. Veronique? - Why? Veronique, Veronique? - Veronique! I told you she left, Veronique. - Veronique! - Be tranquille! Veronique! Veronique? Veronique! - Jack, what are you afraid of? - Veronique! Read it! Hmm. - It's just.. - Probably for the best. - Where's Mary? - Madame Grizard. She is not here. You must leave now. Voila.. What the fuck? Quoi? Qu'est-ce qu'y a? Ah, pardon, pardon! What the fuck! Tiens! Please, I don't understand. Ne comprender pas. Please! What are you gonna do to me? Miam miam! No, fuck off. Si si si.. Tiens tiens tiens, vas-y allez. Oh, fuck! Wait, please.. Please! Stop! No! Why are you doing this? Please, please, don't do this, please! Plise don't do zise! Plise don't do zise! Stop, stop! No! Ben tu manges pas? No eat. Eat. Allez. Hey. Regarde moi. La. Voila. T'es un bon garcon. What do you mean.. Un homme-lette? No, no, no, no. Wait a second. Oh. You know Grizard! Allez. Aller, finissons-en une bonne fois pour toute! Oh, ou est ce que je les ai foutues? Et merde. Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? I need help! Hello? Something must be done. Listen to me! And then what? You think everything will suddenly be fixed? When are you going to wake up and be realistic? This is a terrible, awful mess. There's no way out. Not this time. It will be a hazy memory for Jack at the most. I spoke to Delacroix less than half an hour ago. And everything was under control. Ah, putain. Merde. We can go and check on them on the way. No, I don't want to do that. Veronique? Fuck! What have they done? I'm such a fool, I should've listened to you. They told me you had left! No! They tried to trick me. Where are those fucking weirdos? They've left. I don't know where to. Fuck! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Attends! That girl cannot leave this house. Shit. Aah! What the fuck are we gonna do? Drive. Just keep driving. - We need to call the police. - Jack, but there's no time! Putain, je pete les plombs! This is all my fucking fault! Jack, please don't say that. It's not your fault. I should've listened to you from the beginning. How am I so naive? I thought they were nice people. I'm always so fucking wrong! Fuck! He's trying to run us off the road. I can't believe it! Be careful for God's sake! This is nuts! Come on, this bloody engine! Jesus! What the fuck are they doing? Come on. Vous etes tares? Fuck, something's wrong! - Look out, Jack! - Oh, shit! Jack, ca va? Oh, merde. Faut qu'on se casse. Hurry. Allez viens. What happened? We are cursed. Come on, what are you waiting for? God! I knew this would happen. I knew it, didn't I? It's out of control! What are we supposed to do? I am calm. Don't tell me to be calm! Just unlucky. What's with you and all the bad luck, seriously? Ah, I don't know. It can't be all that bad though. I met you, didn't I? Ah. Oh. Are you okay? Everything's going to be okay. Y'a quelqu'un? Yeah. Oh! - Hey. - Don't you fucking touch her. Non, non, non, non, non. Attends, attends, attends, attends, attends. Arrete. A-a-ah! Ow! Fuck, my head really hurts. Jack? Jack! Ca fait un mal de chien putain. Aide moi. No! You listen to me, but you don't hear me! Come out! We know you're in there! Merde, merde. Come out! Come out! This is the last time I can do this for you. I hope you understand. How many times have I heard you say that? - Get out of the car! - Jack! I said get the fuck out of the fucking car! - Tu m'as bien dit qu'il s'etait barre? - Tu me crois toi. Get out of the fucking car! Give me the keys! Don't fucking move. Don't fucking move. You don't know what you're doing. Oh, really? Shall we see, shall we? - Please.. - Shall we fucking see? Please, put the gun down. Let's talk. Yes! We can explain everything. I know everything! You're trying to make her one of your mannequins You sick fucks! No, Jack, you have to understand. All of this, I was trying to protect you. - Stop talking! - Yes, Jack, there's something I've been... Shut the fuck up! Tie them up! Get down! Jack. Non! Veronique! Come here. Don't talk to those lunatics. Veronique! Un. Deux. Trois. Ciseaux! What did you say? Tu me fais revivre? I love it when you speak in French. Tu me fais revivre? You're so beautiful when you speak in French. You have to teach me. Un petit peu tous les jours, okay? Okay. What was that? Nothing. Just something I don't need anymore. - Calais? - Just drive. - But where are we going? - Anywhere! Anywhere but here. Shouldn't we go back to your family? - No. - They'll be worried, no? No. They never have. Anyway, I feel safe here.
