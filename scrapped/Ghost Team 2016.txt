 

                        2:46 a.m. I'm hearing what I believe to be footsteps in my living room. Proceed to move, slowly. I'm afraid that many kinds of intelligent hauntings are easily startled. I think the electro magnetic fields are disturbing the electrical. That would be consistent with intelligent hauntings of this sort. Okay. This is it. I'm going in. Hopefully, I'll catch it. My name is Louis Arnold. And I want to be the next ghost getter. Stan? What are you doing? Car got cold. You're sleeping in your car now? Trying to. You mind if I crash here tonight? What's with the counter? Just been working on the tapes for the Ghost Getters. How did you get stuck in the window? I didn't want to wake you by ringing the bell. This is way harder than it looks. Come on. There. I got your leg. No. That's not going to work. Make your body like a board. Plank it. Maybe we can take off your sweater. Don't take my clothes off. Don't take 'em off? No. It's cold. I know it's cold. That's why I left the car. I might as well have stayed in the car. This is amazing. If you are able to see how many investigators are here, can you tap that number out? Dude. The ghost getter team will stop at nothing to document evidence of the supernatural. Our team is made up of experts in every field. And soon, our team could include you. With H.J leaving to join the team Ghost Getters, Canada, we are on the hunt for a new member of our crew. You have just one month left to submit your best paranormal evidence, before it's too late. I want it so bad. You have a desire to communicate with loved ones who have crossed over. Bought a telescope. Yeah? Figured I'm on the loose end, you know? Think about it. The aliens that took Pam, They did whatever hypnosis or brainwashing thing they do on the police, so that the police don't file a police report. Meaning I'm the only one that's on to them. Meaning I'm the only one that knows. - Are you sure she was-- - Abducted? Seriously. How else... How else do you explain... a woman not showing up on her wedding day? There's so much... There's so much we don't understand. Yeah, I know. Holy shit, wow! I'm on a break. Oh, God! What's up? Do you remember when you were a little kid? You used to dream of growing up. Owning your very own print and copy shop? Nope. Yeah, me neither. Thank you. Can I help you? I need 15 of these "no trespassing" signs laminated, please. Teenagers swimming in your pool? No. I have a little property about an hour down route 199. Just a broken down old barn. I've been meaning to tear it down. It's dry rot, wet rot. There's all sorts of rotting you could get. Some children try to get in and stepping on nails. You know how they can get gas gangrene with the nails sticking through the bottom of their foot. You know, everyone's suing these days. I don't want to get a lawsuit. I don't want to sit in court for hours. I think theres rats too. I really would rather people steered clear of it. Is it haunted? Splint is, I don't want people getting a splinter either. Um, so what makes you think that it's haunted? It's just very very creepy. There's noises. I see lights. I'd really rather people steered clear of it. Do you do banners? Hey! We are going ghost hunting this weekend! I have plans. What plans? There's a pizza place... Stan! This guy came into my shop today to print up some "no trespassing" signs, for this place he owns because of how much mysterious activity is being going on there. I mean, this place is a virgin site. Aw man, I was pretty amped for the pizza! Are you serious? I'm telling you that this is our chance! To what? To do something! If we can document some awesome evidence, we can maybe get on the show and then actually, do something with our lives. Aren't you sick and tired of working shitty jobs just to make enough money to pay for our shitty lives? Maybe we can actually be great at something. Don't you want to know that you're not crazy? That there are unexplainable phenomenon out there? I'm not crazy. My fiance was abducted by aliens. I know, man. You in? I'm in. E.M.F. detector. Write that down. Got it. Hey, do we write down thermal camera? Check. All those jackets are sweet. I know. Sweet jackets. Okay. Read back to me what you have. Flashlight, mini D.V. cameras, boom mics, low level mics, laser thermometers, computer monitors, cables, thermal imaging cameras, night vision goggles, Geiger counters, ouija board, E.M.F. detectors, sweet jackets and new pants. Dammit, that's a lot of stuff. Yeah and we don't know how to use any of it. They have a tech specialist guy, computer genius type, you know? That's what we need. Let me ask you something, chief. When you watch the game, you want to feel the fuckin' sweat and blood fly off the screen and on to you? Hear the crowd cheer so loud it makes your brain vibrate in your skull? Do you want to be so close to the action that you can almost smell the cheerleader's breath? Let me tell you something. The resolution on this mother fucker is so intense, it'll literally knock your eyeballs. So, how many you want? He's a genius. He graduated from college two years early with an engineering degree. Zak! Hey, uncle Lou, what's up? Stan, what's going on? What do you guys need? A little phone. a little Tivo? We need some surveillance equipment. Yeah you do. How many stalls in the bathroom? - What? - What? No. We're gonna go ghost hunting. Sorry what? Ghost hunting. Oh, no. Are you serious? You're serious! That's cool. You know? That's really cool. Ghost hunting is very cool. What can I help you with? You need some... vacuums and backpack straps? Zak, would you stop? We're making sweet jackets. Cool. This is everything we need, alright? Damn! That's a lot of stuff. We have most of this but um... kinda depends on how much you're willing to spend. That's the thing, we're kind of... hoping that maybe you can rent it to us or something. We only need it for Saturday night. I can hook you up. What's in it for me? Well I thought you could come along, you know. Help us operate everything, I mean. We do kinda need a tech genius guy. - Well, I am a genius. - Yeah. You are the tech guy. You gotta set everything up, You gotta teach us how to operate the cameras, you gotta watch the monitors. Well look, if I come along with you, I'm not going to just sit around in front of a screen all night. You know I want to be in the front lines, killing zombies. There's not going to be any zombies. We are not gonna kill anything, we're just -capturing evidence of the paranormal. - And possible alien activity. I have nothing else to do, so okay, I'm in. - Yeah? - Yeah, but... Look if you want to get all this equipment pro boner, you're gonna need to color outside the lines, okay? Meet me at the loading dock at 10 p.m. Come alone but bring Stan. Man I feel more alive that I've felt in months! Yeah, me too. Sure we're not going to get in trouble for this? It seems like stealing. We're going to be fine. Just chill out. We just have to get everything back here by Sunday morning and we'll be fine. You guys grab the stuff in the aisles, I'm gonna grab the stuff from the back. We meet back here at 0400. Got it. - We need battery backup. - Battery back up. We could use that. - Make sure we tell Zak. - Yeah, we'll tell Zak. Hey man, do you feel a weird energy in here? - Like, a heaviness? - Yeah, I do. I feel heavy and sad and tired. No, no. A presence. - Did you see that? - No. Now keep your eyes open. There's definitely something here. On the ground! Now! Get on the ground! Go ahead and shoot me, that would be great. Get on the ground! All the way down. All the way down. Put your hands in the air! Put your hands above you! Stop being such a douche. Put your mace away. Zak? What are you doing? Are you stealing? No, asshole. We're borrowing equipment, alright? It's cool. I don't think it's cool. I don't think you're supposed to do that. Yeah, no duh! I think you are supposed to be watching some monitors and goofing off. Alright, I'm calling the cops. Wait, wait. No, look, look. - Ross, right? - Yes? I'm Louis and Zak's my nephew. We're actually putting together this whole team and we're looking for someone with your particular abilities. You were? - Yeah. - Which ones? Well, you're obviously tough, and used to dangerous situations and unknown threats. And you've got an eye for noticing suspicious activity on a security monitor. Your uncle's pretty observant. What's it for? We're um... We're going on a paranormal investigation. Like Ghost Getters? Yes. Exactly like Ghost Getters. I've got a season pass. It's one of my favorite shows. Ours too! Look, maybe instead of calling the cops, you could join our team for the weekend. We promise we'll have everything back by Sunday. - Right Zak? - Yeah. Please join us and also we'll have everything back. I should probably just call the cops. - Wait Ross, look. - What? I know I give you a lot of crap because you are a mall cop and your hair looks like a little girl but, we need you, okay? Might get really hairy out there. Unlike your legs. And well, we could use your help. Look, we need a bad-ass, Ross. And until we find one, you are here. It's true. What? - What'd he say? - He's fine, he's fine. Alright, I'll do it. But only because it sounds like you guys are going to be involved in a potentially dangerous activity and uh... rather not see civilians get hurt on my watch. You're a civilian though, because that badge is plastic and you work at a mall. I'm getting a very strong impression of a... couple. A young couple. This was... This was definitely their home. Maybe it still is. What do you mean? Maybe, they never left. It's the only thing missing you know? Someone who can communicate with lost souls who have crossed over. She's supposed to be awesome. Pam used to call her all the time and she used to tell her things no one could possibly know. Like one time, Pam called her, she said "You're gonna have your period". And then two weeks later, boom. - That's awesome - Yeah. Hey, hey! There she is. Excuse me? Miss Victoria? Yeah? My name is... Wait. You probably know that already. You probably know why we are here, don't you? Of course I do. So? So? You in? In? I mean, we'd love to have you come along with us. Yes, I can see that. I can also see... - Money. - You do? Yeah. I see money changing hands. Compensation for this. Does it resonate with either of you? She maybe means that we'll probably sell our evidence or something? You're amazing. So? Is that a yes? It is. Oh, great! Let me tell you the details. Wait. I'm sorry. I'm still getting used to this. - You already know. - I do. Well then it's all set. This is incredible. Look, I've got a pen. Why don't you write the details on a piece of paper. You got a piece of paper? And show this to noone! Do you understand? Show this to noone. Say nothing to anyone, ever. Those are the rules, you got it? Now read it out loud. Okay um, we're meeting at Arnold's printing copy, on Saturday, at 11 a.m. You knew all that, didn't you? This is unreal. I don't know what to say. We are so glad to have you on board. Take the piece of paper. Thanks, yeah. - Whoa well, we'll see you then? - Mm-hmm Man, my heart was beating so fast. Hello? Hey. Can I get a 100 copies of these? Are these two sets of eyebrows for the price of one? Two eyebrows, ten bucks. Got it. Yeah, no problem. What is this stuff? Oh uh, it's nothing, it's just... Ghosts. Hmm. I'm sorta into paranormal investigation. I used to think our house was haunted when I was a kid. I would hear all these sounds and footsteps and sometimes I would here this... voice of this woman. So my brother and I went to all of these sances and shit. Kinda like summon the spirit and communicate. We'd take to take polaroid pictures of each other and try to see if you saw anybody in the background. Yeah, we loved it. And? Well, it turns out my dad was porking his secretary in our game room. Oh. Yeah. But I swear it really did sound like a ghost. She was a moaner. Yeah. That was disgusting. Yeah, you probably wish it was a ghost. Yeah. Um... Would you ever want to come with us? Ghost hunting? Yeah, I mean... You've got way more experience than most of us. We can always use someone to do some research on the place, look into it's history. Okay. Okay. Stan, come on buddy. Time to get up. Got a big day. Morning, team! We all good? Yeah, Robocop helped me carry the equipment. - I'll see ya next week. - Yeah, that's normal. Hey, morning! - Hey! - That's called a girl. Ellie, this is Ross and Zak. You guys, this is Ellie. And Victoria! Hey! Guys, this is Victoria from Victoria's Visions, you know? - And Stan. - Is that him? Yeah, he's going through a rough time right now. Yeah. It was nice to meet you guys. - Ellie is our final piece of the puzzle. - How? - What? - How is she the final piece of the puzzle? She's going to be our researcher. She's dug up some pretty interesting stuff actually, right? I also do hair and make up. Oh! So does Ross. We're burning up some daylight so let's load up, people. I thought we agreed no women on this trip. We didn't agree to anything. They're weak. They are going to swallow us up and slow us down. - Okay wait, see... - Okay, it's your funeral. Ross, Ross, come here! How are we supposed to kill these zombies if we don't have any shotguns or sports equipment? We are not killing zombies, Zak. We are documenting evidence for the paranormal. We are called The Ghost Team. Not The Zombie Team. A Ghost Team? Spirit Catchers? Was that your team at cheer camp? - These are free, right? - Don't touch that stuff. Why? What's in there? It's uh, tactical equipment and probably safer for everyone if we-- Is this a paintball gun? What the frik is this for? Dude, I play on the weekends. Oh, you got too old for laser tag? Had to register as a pedophile? No. I did not have to do that. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Oh, please yes! Are these temporary tattoos? Duh. No, they are permanent. I know I make fun of you because you are a huge pansy, but that's too much. They give them for free when you win. So, I guess the joke's on you. It means I win a lot. - Oh wow, congrats, good job. - Thanks. Do me a favor, if you see a zombie. Don't shoot him in the chest. Aim for the head. Otherwise they are going to come after you like... Gotta grab a baseball bat, a hockey stick or a classic shotgun. Ah, this was still alive. Quit it. Stop it! - Hey! - What? - Knock it off. - He started it Louis. Let's chill for a minute, alright? Thank you. Oh, jeez. Are you serious? Can we please not play this song again? So why Ghost Team? It's a name I thought would be cute. Not cute, but cool. - The Poltergeist. - That's good. A really good name. The Night Bumpers. Bumpers of the Night. Okay, why do you do this to yourself? Better than Night Watchers. I think this is it. Guess we're going to walk from here. Should we start unloading? Yeah. But um... Hold on. Oh, you made T-shirts? Yeah. I thought we were making sweet jackets. Yeah, well... I thought it might be cool plus, hey, you can see with these things way easier in the dark. Oh! These are awesome! - Yeah. - Yes! Yeah, there's plenty. I didn't know what sizes everybody was, so... Maybe we should switch. Think I'm going to need some help. - Pull it down. - Pull it down? Look at this! This is great! This place is perfect. Oh, great! Found the murder hut. This is it! Hey, Zak! This is where we're going to set the comm check with Victoria. Ross, Stan, why don't you guys start rigging up the barn. Ellie, you and I can hit the workshops and the cabins. Oh and uh... Don't forget to take a walkie. There's no cellphone reception out here. Go to channel one and follow me. Did you say comm check? Well, this is fucking creepy. It's perfect. Let's get to it. Ooh, lovely. Put a camera right there. That way we get a full sweep of the room. Good vantage point. I'm glad you're here. Yeah, me too. So it smells like death. So that's good. Oh, Jesus! How are we looking, Zak? That should do it. The sun's about to go down. So let's all rendezvous, run a comm check and gear up! Did you say comm check again? Alright. I think we are ready to go. Zak, come out here and brief us on some of the equipment we have. You guys, listen carefully. This is military grade stuff we are using. Yeah, about that. I wasn't able to get all the equipment on your list. But I do have two digital cameras with night vision settings and I've duct taped them to a baseball helmet. Also reports everything you see too. I was able to score a thermal imaging camera. I had to fake an order. Some guy went home with a sub woofer. Who cares, right? Sound recorders, I got. And electro magnetic field detectors, also got, so... Hey, you're welcome. - No. This is going to work, I think. - Great. Alright. I think everyone understands this. For the first leg we are going to stick together and then we are going to split into teams. Everyone's going to get a different partner, different locations on the hour, every hour. Now remember, Most important part. It doesn't matter what you experience, If you don't catch any evidence of it. So, keep your cameras, your recorders rolling, always. With any luck, tomorrow morning we'll found some ghosts. - It looks like someone lived here. - Yeah. Maybe they never left. We must be very careful. Opening a doorway to the beyond can sometimes let things through that we just might not want to deal with. Spirits! Spirits! If there are any spirits present... let them make themselves known. Known! Come forward! It could take a while. Who's moving it? No one. X. J. Seven. What does it mean? That we just moved it through a bunch of random letters? - What if it's some sort of a code? - Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Something is trying to communicate with us. It's a... A spirit! A lost spirit! The connection is very weak, uh... It's like a bad transistor radio! I can, I can... I can hear the voice. It's a uh... The name... No, no, no. Yes. Alex was coming through till you distracted me and interrupted. Please. He says... He misses you. But he had a tough crossing over. But he's at peace. This is such bull. Is Ross an adult virgin? - No! - Whoa! Shut up, Alex! Grab your equipment, grab your stuff, we're gonna go check this out. Alright well, I think we should split up. Ross, Zak, why don't you guys take the comm channel for the first shift, you know? 10-four! Alright Zak, let's go. Follow my lead. Stay close behind. Victoria, Stan, you guys head out to the garage and... Ellie, I guess you are with me. Actually, can I go with Victoria? Uh, yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. No problem. Stan, you are going to be here with me. Be careful. Well, I'm not getting any EMF readings over here. Maybe we should uh... - Maybe we should-- - I got something. What? Check this out. What is that? It's like a vapor or something. That's warmer than everything else. Oh, my God! My heart is pounding. Mine too. - Get a little closer. - I don't want to spook it. Roger roger. We are almost in it now. It's all around us. Look at that. - Give it to me, give it to me. - Okay. Stop stop! You're right next to it. It's all around us. You smell that? Yeah. Smells like eggs. Rotten eggs. It's tangy. Definitely paranormal. Definitely paranormal. Clear so far. You don't have to report all clear. - What? - I didn't say anything. What? No! What is it? What? False alarm. Don't do that. Don't get your panties in a bunch. Can you really communicate with the dead? As easily as I can communicate with the living. Is there somebody you want to communicate with? No. You can talk to Puerto Ricans. First one's free. That's weird. It just spiked and then went back down. You and I will head to the stables, Zak and Stan try some EVP work in the cabin. Victoria, you and Ross man the comm check. Copy that. Copy that. I'm going to talk to you more about this, but I guess not now. Yeah. That's not what we are getting paid to do. Uh, well, we're not getting paid. You are not? Ugh, why do I get into these situations? I knew it. You know, for footprints. This all we get today? I'd be happy. Wait till the Ghost Getters see that! I guess we should go in there and do some EVP work. What is it again? We ask questions to the spirits. And then listen back to the audio recorders to see if anybody... said anything. So, talking to ourselves? Cool, okay. So what are we asking? Did you die in this room? Are you mad that you're dead? We should probably kill the flashlights. Electronics tend to uh, throw off electro magnetic field readings. Okay. Point seven, point eight, point nine. Uh, wait. I think I'm getting something here. Don't move - So who's Ace? - Oh. Sorry. It's just that you mentioned his name at the weekly session. - I didn't mean to... - No, it's fine. He's my brother. Oh! So, he's passed? He had a really... rough time. It sucks. He really got into drugs and couple of years ago, he od'ed. I guess I like to think that people still stick around, I don't know. I know it's silly but I feel we need these silly things to get you through the day. I don't think it's silly. You ghosts, suck. You can't make your shit visible. You do suck. You probably died because no one loved you. Well, one person loved you but then... But then she was abducted and then you... You realized... Well, no one would care if I was gone. So, why even take up space on the earth anymore? Or something? How come you work at Micro Center? How come you work at Micro Center? You graduated with a degree in engineering in two years. That's pretty impressive. Shouldn't you be doing research at MIT or something? Yeah, I mean, sure. That could have been my path. But I thought I'd get some experience first in consumer electronics. And then I could focus on, commercial engineering. Invent the next blu-ray, Ethernet. Look at that, the tape is out. We should probably get back to the shack and switch it out. You go. I want to... stay here and... try to tune into this energy. Okay. If you need to consume human life, take mine. Good luck with that. This is the place where we saw that thermo cloud we were telling you guys about. - Let's see if we can. - Are these yours? No! Louis to Ghost Team, come in. Has anyone been in the barn since Stan and I were here? Negative. No. Don't do that, you dick. - Dude, chill out, I'm just kidding. - I know. Do you? Where's miss Cleo? Who's that? The psychic woman? One of the four people on the trip with us? The lady with the hair? She said she felt energy coming from the barn. Energy? She's probably looking for spare change. She's about as psychic as I am. Hop up, I need to download this audio card. Alright, but I get it when you are done. Okay. What is that? - We did an EVP recording. It's where you record ghosts. - I know. It was the stupidest thing. We just talked to ourselves and sit around and Stan like... Wait. What's that? Rewind. What is that? I don't know. Holy shit! That is amazing. You guys, that's a great piece of evidence. - Can't hear what it's saying thought. - Play it again. Something then? We need to get... the cinnamon. We need to get the cinnamon. What the frik does that mean? I don't know. Maybe we should go to a grocery store. Ross is a pussy? Ross is a pussy? Yeah, I don't think so. Shut up, Zak. Just speaking the truth. We should get rid of them. Oh, God she's right. I don't think we are welcome here. Let's see what they want. Maybe we should get them cinnamon. Stay on track. We need to open up a line of communication. Hey, do you think we could... You guys, where's Victoria? - I don't know. Why are you looking at me? - She was with you! She said she wanted to look around. I thought she came in when I radioed everyone. Louis to Victoria, come in. Louis to Victoria. Press the button on the side, like we went over. Ross. Can you pause the surveillance cameras? She's probably in a place which we can't see. Rewind to see where she was heading. It's full speed. She's in the stables. - We should all go. - Yeah, yeah. We need to stick together. I don't think we are alone. Clear. Do you really have to walk like that? Yeah he does. It tells the other peacocks that he's looking to mate. It's a tactical entrance posture. It's standard police procedure but, I wouldn't expect you dorks to know anything about that. Well, you are not even a police officer. - Well, he almost was. - Shut up. Wait. You were a cop? - Almost. - Zak, shut up! Ross, I'm sorry. I have to tell them the story. Shut up, Zak! So he's in the police academy, right? And during the final exams there is a role play thing. It's a robbery scenario. So, people are firing blanks, the guys are taking hostages, Well, tell them what happened, Ross. - Nothing. - Ross? - Clear. - Be honest. They thought I cried, okay? Ha-ha. He cried. He bawled during his police exams. I wasn't bawling, I was just crying a lot. And it was because I was sleep deprived, okay? It was not on purpose. It was stress. And they flunked you because of that? They said I wasn't tough enough. Well, that's not true, right? Tell that to the ten-year-old he tackled him into the wall. Shut up, Zak. He was 12 and he was stealing. Just leave him alone. She's not here, it's all clear. We never saw her come out. Where is she? - Who knows... - Guys? Whoa, what was that? Hold on, hold on. That was definitely something. If there are any spirits who'd like to make contact, I'm here. It's cold, but I'm here. I'm willing to have a conversation. Let's do it. What is that? What the hell is that? It's cold but I'm here. I'm willing to have a conversation. Let's do it. It's a face. Stan! We got a face! A face? Like an alien face? No, no, no. What's wrong? Battery's dead. That's impossible. We didn't leave anything on. What? Well, one of the leading theories in the field is, they draw on a power source to manifest themselves, like... camera batteries or flashlights or generators but... I don't know. Draining an entire car battery. That's a... lot of energy. What are we supposed to do? We can't call anybody and we can't get out of here! We're just supposed to wait around till we get killed? No. I'm going back in. Look, I... I put the team together. I found the place, it's my fault one of us was taken. I said I wanted proof of the paranormal and... I'm not leaving without her. I'm staying too. So what if we get killed. Who cares? I'm in. Well, I'm not waiting alone. - I'm not going back in there either. - Thats fine. Zak, you're going to take the first shift in the comm shack. You tell us if you see anything at all on the surveillance camera and we'll come as fas as we can. Let's hunt some mother effing ghosts. That's what I thought... There's no electricity running through this place anymore. Exposed wiring can give out high EMF readings but, I don't know. I'm not getting a source for these readings. Holy fuck, holy shit. Come in! Somebody come in! Fuck! Help! Somebody help me! Zak, we're coming! Help me! We're all going to die! Watch out, watch out! Zak, Zak! Zak! He's gone. Louis, what do we do? Look, hey! Calm down. We are going to find him. Zak! Zak! Zak! Hey man, I've been thinking. This is like that scene, where Mel Gibson sees the aliens in signs. What if there are crop circles out there, man? Do you think it's the same ones that took... Just give the alien thing a rest for one second. Two of our friends just got taken by demons. So it's okay to believe in ghosts, but aliens are ridiculous? What if they got abducted? No one's been abducted. Grow up, Stan. Louis? What? Guys, guys, guys. Come here. Look, look, look. Go go! This is our chance! Go! I see the bastard. See him? Yeah. Wait, don't get too far. Hey, Louis. We're going around the back! Over here. Ross? Stan? Guys? - Oh, my God, oh, my God - No, no, no, no. Okay, so what do we do? Why won't it tell us what it wants? It wants us to leave. It wants us to get out of it's home. We've been catching EMF spikes, all night long. But no source. Usually with these kinds of malevolent hauntings, there's inner sanctum. A source for paranormal energy. It's spiking. What does it mean? Is that... What is this place? It's a meth lab. Ghosts are making meth. They aren't ghosts. They are drug dealers. Right. Yeah. We gotta keep going till we get some cell reception. - Are you going to leave them there? - What choice do I have? They are in there because of you. I get it. It's all my fault. I'm a looser, okay? I should have just stayed at the copy shop where I belong, because that's all I'm good for, right? That's not what I mean. At least I can go get some help. They'll be dead by then. What am I supposed to do? The only thing I'm good at is making copies and going on message boards, with other idiots who just want to talk about poltergeists all day while sitting on their fat asses at home. Alone. All I know is how to do hair and nails but you don't see me acting like a fucking pussy. Look, we may not be living large lives here, But it doesn't make us small people. How did your dad's secretary sound, again? What? Since there's no power running through the barn, I just assumed that readings were paranormal. I didn't think that there might be... another power source. Do you know the plan? I'll wait for your signal. - Can we at least get some water? - No. Not till you tell me how many of you are out there. Told you, it's just us. I don't think so. My boys tell me they saw at least five of you. What are you doing out here anyway? Doing a ghost hunt. What, like a... Paranormal Specialists? That show sucks. I like that show. Shut up! Shut the fuck up! You call your boys off, man. Call off your fucking guys. I will gut every one of you. I told you this place was haunted. Spirits! Spirits! Use me as a vessel. Deliver your message! You have angered us! Leave us alone! - What's wrong with her? - We're going to possess your soul. Hold on, hold on. Hey, guys! I thought you bailed on us. No. Not on your life. Come on. We've got to be really quiet. Oh! A back up generator! Who turned it on? You! You are the guy who printed all those "no trespassing" signs. Yes, I did. Which is technically what you are doing. What are you doing here, anyway? We are hunting ghosts. This is your lab? Mm-hmm. Why, I mean, why would you do something like this? Why are you hunting ghosts? Aw, thought you knocked him out. I don't know how hard you got to hit someone to knock em out. Do you? Come on, Stan. Back me up. We're all learning on the job, Zak. Take care of this. I can go to the boat, get a gun and shoot 'em in the head. No, come on. Don't! You don't have to do this. Shut up! Why don't you drown 'em one by one on the slop sink, then dump them in the marsh? It'll look more natural. You don't have to do this. We could help you escape. Escape? I get free rent, free board, all the free meth you want! We're living the dream, bro. Sorry, Ghost Team. - No no, There's got to be something we could do. - No, no. Please. You're right. It is time to say goodbye. But to yourselves. Kill him, Roberto. We got it, we did it. Awesome. This fool, is going to die. Everybody, chill. Shut the fuck up! - Drop it! - Eat a dick. You want to die? Yesterday, the answer would have been "yes". But today... it's just a " maybe". Hey! Not another step! Come on, let's go. You know what? I will kick you in the dick. Right in it. We're going to come for you. Open the door! Push it, push it! It's locked! Pull it! Pull it! Shit! Oh, yeah! Zak can hack the security code. - Come on, come on. - What? Yeah, you're the computer genius. I'm not a genius. I'm an idiot. No! You graduated from... I didn't graduate, okay? I failed out. I'm 27, I live with my mom and I work at micro center. - I'm a fuck up. - What? No! Look at us! We all are. We believe in you, okay? - You okay? - It's fine! You can do this! You can do it. I think if I can reverse the current, Oh, my God. Come on, come on. Go! Go! You go this way. We'll draw them this way. Come get us, you cock sucking motherfuckers! Come on, buddy. What do we do? I don't know. We've got to figure it out, really fast. Close the door! Through the window. - Do you see anything? - Nothing. Sure? We're dead. We are not dead. Maybe he didn't see us. Oh, shit! Go away! They are zombies. - Did you see their tattoos? - Yeah, what about em? You are wonderful people, alright? Yeah, ha-ha, very funny Zak. You are really good people, right? Are you okay? Don't be humble. I'm awesome. I'm fucking awesome. So let's kick some fucking ass. Hey! Do you believe in aliens? I do. On march 27th, my wife was abducted. Alright, girl... Come on! What was that!? What was that!? It was terrible. You alright? - Where's Louis? - We don't know. We don't know where he is. Here's how it's gonna work. I'm going to take this boat out on to the ocean. You're going to go home and forget about everything that happened here. Okay, but what about her? She's my collateral. If I see a police boat or anything else, I shoot her. And if we let you go? She lives. Fine. On second thought, I think I'll kill you all. No! Your father says he's sorry. He's sorry he wasn't there for you that day. That he didn't tell you that he loved you, more often. Because he did. He wanted you to grow up strong and independent. He'll never forget that thing you two did. That one time when you did it. Later, when things were different, he thought about the thing that you did. And the feelings that he felt while you did it, together. He wants you to know that in his heart, you'll always be thinging in that place together. Just you and him. And whoever else was there. Daddy! I love you! You do? Eh. Oh, yeah! Good shot! Oh, shoot! Uh-oh! Yeah, he's choking. You need the Heimlich or something? Throw down the gun! Any other weapons on you? No? Alright, here we go. Oh, come on! Hit my mouth! Shit, you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah. Sucks, doesn't it? Maybe you'll think twice before messing with the Ghost Team! Oh, my God. Left my utility belt in there. Pretty incredible. I gotta admit, Ross. You're pretty fucking bad-ass. Thanks. Oh, my God. Are you crying? No. It's the smoke from the fire. Shut up, shut up. Thanks. You really are psychic, aren't you? I've been listening to people whine about their problems over the phone for 20 years. I know daddy issues when I see them. I know what happened. It's just a cool looking fire. It's just a bad-ass fire. It's the heat, really. Just thinking about kicking ass. You get cell reception out here? We kicked so much zombie ass. They are coming at us like, "Die, you undead bastards." You really took those guys out without a real gun? Affirmative. Pretty bad-ass, son. Excuse me. Excuse me, I... I filed a missing person's report couple of months ago, missing person due to alien activity. I just wanted to cancel that. Yeah because um... Well, you can just radio the boys and... call off the search, you know? Bring the dogs back in. Yeah. Just tell those guys they can go home and get some sleep. See their families, and you're beautiful. Sorry. That's okay. But this is going to be the case that got away. So anyway, tell them to stand down. - Okay? - Right. Ma'am. I ran your license. It seems you have a warrant out for credit card fraud. Your father wants you to know that he loves you. Well, guess we are free to go. We should take off then. What's wrong? I guess, I'm just disappointed. For a while there, I really thought we had found something. There was, more out there. You know... The deadline to submit the tape isn't till the end of the month. You know, for the Ghost Getters? What are you guys doing next weekend? You know... I think the food court at the mall is haunted for real. Totally. I've heard noises coming from it. Smelt like, there might be ghosts or something. - If my bowels act up, I won't be there. - You'll be there. Oh, by the way, Zak, I just realized we kinda killed all of your equipment. Yeah, I'm pretty fucked. I guess I'll have to apply to college. At least I can crash at my uncle's couch. I have just closed My eyes again Climbed aboard The Dream Weaver train Driver take away My worries of today And leave tomorrow behind Dream Weaver I believe you can get me Through the night Dream Weaver I believe we can reach The morning light Fly me high Through the starry skies Or maybe To an astral plane Cross the highways Of fantasy Help me To forget today's pain Dream Weaver I believe you can get me Through the night Dream Weaver I believe we can reach The morning light Though the dawn May be coming soon There still may be Some time Fly me away To the bright side Of the moon And meet me On the other side Dream Weaver I believe you can get me Through the night Dream Weaver I believe you can get me Through the night Dream Weaver Dream Weaver
