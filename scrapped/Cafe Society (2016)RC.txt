believe my ears need to know that everything does not end there need to believe that a part of me remains We all have a soul Thats right First assassin And now Christian What have done to deserve this Whats worse There you explained The Jews have no life after death We all fear of death But it does not abandon the religion that we were born m not afraid to die Youre too stupid to understand what it means m not saying that like the idea And repulse death with all my strength But when the Angel of Death will take my last breath will go complain swear You hear me will go complaining to me Whose You will do what idiot letter to the Times will complain of silence Because all my life prayed tirelessly and never got an answer What are you talking about No answer is also an answer Its stupid that

scattered in Manhattan Bobby scattered them to an institution where Ben had spent many evenings of fun Bobbys friends Rad Taylor and her husband came to his aid that he bought the club and directs The scandal and the aura of gangsterism did not inflame the passion for the club Investors sent him to California to consider opening a club in Hollywood This time he could afford the luxury hotel where
