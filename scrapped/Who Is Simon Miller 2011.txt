How's your day? - Really good! I made a cold eggplant soup with an infusion of lavender and chamomile that was amazing. We sold out. Oh, congratulations! How's your oil well behaving? Oh, at least, tougher than I anticipated. I think we're good. Hello? Hello? Simon? You're breaking up. Honey, I can't hear you. Simon, are you there? Yeah, just a few more things to tie up. Is there a problem? Just anxious for you to come home, as always. - Yeah, thanks for checking in. I gotta run. I'll see you-- I'll see you regular time. Bonjour. Cheating? Sarah isn't alone. There's a whole group we're investigating. I don't believe it. I understand. Sarah's a great leader, an excellent student. Spanish and french honors societies, varsity gymnastics. She's the last one I expected to be involved. But Sarah's never had trouble with math before. AP calculus is a tough course. A lot of our students are struggling. Then maybe you should be looking, at how effective the teacher is. Our priority is to address these charges. We'll have a disciplinary board hearing Thursday night at 7:30. You and your husband should be there with Sarah. That won't be a problem. Not like anyone's ever gonna see it. You can straighten this out, Sarah. Just get your parents to go in and yell at miss Widmer. That's how Justin McAvoy stays on the football team. Maybe I should go change. I would. I didn't do it. Get your bag. - Mom, I didn't do it. But you must see how, it strikes your teacher as odd, Sarah. All 6 of you scoring than on any test this year. The sooner you start explaining, the better off you'll be. It'd be nice if I could start with you believing me. Honey, I wish I knew there wasn't something you were hiding from me. You gotta give me something, Sarah. Why can't you just believe me? And please let me find the right time to share this with your father. Ladies and gentlemen, security... Welcome home, mr. Miller. Ian, how are you, my friend? Your train ticket to Boston, and your presents for your family. - Thank you, Ian. By the way, Meredith really liked that jam from Charleston. I'll remember that the next time you use Charleston as your cover. Where did we say I was this time? Baton Rouge? Baton Rouge, right. I don't know how much longer I can take all this. You just need a little rest, mr. Miller. I heard your trip to Paris was, uh, agitated. That's a good word. I'll take you right to the train station. Hey. I'm sorry I couldn't get home sooner. Is Baton Rouge still in one piece? Left it better than I found it. How are things here? Hmm... Under control. Aw, thanks, honey. I thought it could do well with your baked ham with pineapple. Oh, it's a perfect match! I'm starving, actually. Oh! We're having pork tenderloin la Meredith. Ooh! Best pork tenderloin north of the equator. Ok, you ready? Ready to lose? Three, two, one. Jump! Hey, we're home! Hey, Einstein. Any news from the other side of the universe? Just a never-ending battle of good versus evil. Hi, dad. Where's your sister? Upstairs, plotting in her lair. Sarah, your dad's home. Hey, if the xbox is on, your homework better be done. To perfection. Oh. Uh, I'm almost there. Don't fall in the water. Buddy, I am here to save you from yourself. So does it? Absolutely. I'm gonna take you there sometime. Hey, dad. Hi, sweetie. Dad, that's water! Mmm! I missed you guys. No, no! Jump! Jump! Nothing ever changes around here. Ok, so what did I miss? Ok. Sarah, what's new with you? Got the garlic, Kevin? I'm ready to surprise the pork. Surprise everyone and order a pizza. We're committed. Would be nice to sit down to a real meal together. Vegetables? - Almost there. Thank you. Sarah, how's that new vault coming? I know you can do it, sweetie. I've seen you do it. Dad, I'm really trying. Believe me. Gotta keep at it. Two steps forward, one step back. Then try harder. Four steps forward, two steps back... Gets you there even faster. That's right. Ok, mushrooms. - All right. Come on, come on. Kevin, how's that gaming club? I'm sorry, are we done talking about Sarah already? Every day, a little more, this one. The guys in the club were boring, so I dropped out. I tried to stay long enough to develop an app to make my sister tolerable, but I gave up. Next time, you should try tweaking your own personality. Aw! Simon. I know. Committed. In 2 seconds, all right? What's it gonna be this time? Petroleum problem in Petaluma? Methane menace in Miami? Oil all over Omaha. Your father is the best geologist, north of the equator. It's a compliment that he is the man people call in an emergency. Ugh! Now I've got oil all over the stove. Somebody hand me a... Ugh! Never mind. Where? West Virginia. Natural gas pipeline. When? Ok! Well, we'll just make your pork panini-portable, and you'll be all set. Sweetheart, don't worry about me. You're not gonna eat healthy. - I'll manage. No, you won't. I know you. Ok, this is gonna go well with your panini. It's natural. Nothing artificial. I just wanna make sure I take care of you. Even though you're far away. You always take care of me. Thanks. I wish you weren't afraid to fly. You'd get home sooner. There's a meeting, um, at school this Thursday night. You should be there. Ok. What's the meeting? I'll just fill you in when you get back, but it's mandatory. Miss Widmer really wants both of us there, so... Well, anything for miss Widmer. Have fun in West Virginia. Do you have the material? I do, but the price has gone up. That's not... Jasmine, what are you doing here? Helping out a friend. This isn't your case. It is now. What? Why are you... So, any update on Simon? No, he's definitely off the grid. No news from our people on the ground in Geneva. Does he have other handlers he works there? I can reach out, see if they know anything. - Do it now. We're racing the clock. Ok. Aw! Dad's not with you? No, I was hoping I'd missed him and he came straight out to the car. Tried his phone. Let me try it again. Maybe he missed his train. And dropped his laptop and broke his phone. Kevin! - Aw! You told dad, didn't you, about what happened in school? No, I didn't tell him. We have to choose the perfect moment to tell dad bad news so we don't ruin the 15 minutes he's home, remember? Let it go to voicemail. Meredith's smart. We need to tell her something. You gonna tell a chef with no security clearance that her husband has vanished on a top-secret mission? Of course not, but... You know the drill. As soon as you get the cover story ok'd, call her, and make sure she doesn't get suspicious. Ugh! All right. Listen, we have 2 hours until the disciplinary hearing, ok? I can do everything everybody needs done, as long as I get a little cooperation, ok? Why are you looking at me like I'm crazy? Let's do this. No one's hungry, mom. We need to eat. You need to cook. There's a difference. It helps me think, all right? It's all about balance and harmony, neither of which we have right now. That's a recent development? Watch your step, young lady. You're already on thin ice. You are so unfair, mom! It's not what you think. Really? What... what do I think? Hello? Hello! Mrs. Miller, it's Pamela. Finally! Pamela, what is going on? Where's Simon? He's just been delayed. Yeah, obviously. What's going on? Some complications at the exploitation site. We're not sure when the situation will be stable enough for him to come home. Why hasn't he called me? He's out in the field. There isn't much development because of the pipelines, so cell phone service is actually really bad. But he got through to you. And asked me to call you. Ok, so, where...where... When is he coming back? We're not sure yet. Things are a little crazy over there. You mean "down there". Down there, yes. West Virginia is south of us, but it's west of us too. What did he say about the meeting? What meeting? The mandatory one at Sarah's school. He didn't mention anything. We got cut off. Ok, listen, thank you for calling. Let me know when you hear from him again, ok? Will do. Something's wrong. Pamela's nervous. She's never nervous. Now she's making me nervous. My mind-reading skills aren't what they could be, so I have to ask what's going on. I'm looking for a contact list, an itinerary, anything we can... Oh! Come on. There has to be a lock somewhere. Kevin, stop messing with your dad's things. Just never seen a remote with these buttons before. That's our song. That was the first dance at our wedding reception. This was your song? Yes, we were original ones. Kevin, what did you do? There are no alpha keys on this. So it must be numeric. What are you talking about? What's your wedding date? October... ...12th, 1990. Kevin, you did it. What's dad hiding with a lock like that? Where did dad get a lock like that? What are those to? You two stay here. Here? In the office? Ok... I'll have my cell. Where are you going? I'll be back as soon as I can. Mom! What about my hearing? Aw! Ok, um... I'll get you there, all right? We still have an hour and a half. We'll talk everything through in the car on the way there. I promise. - You... Do your homework. You get your jacket. Mom just said to stay put. Yeah, I think she could use a little support. Already in motion. This has got to be a mistake. What? What did I tell you? To clean my room. Am I on the wrong conversation? I cannot believe the two of you. You shouldn't be here alone. And if something is going on with dad, we need to know. Listen, I'm telling you, this is a waste of everybody's time. Take this. I mean, there's no way this key is gonna... We're committed. Mom, what is this? I wish I knew. All right... Password. If his desk at home is your anniversary, maybe Sarah's birthday. No, my birthday. Mom's. Sarah's birthday plus my birthday. Try the square root of weirdness divided by "you're a dork." Hey! Divided by... France, Belgium. Kenya? - So he does fly. Sarah, please. Your father will explain all of this to us, I'm sure. Would that be my father, Simon Miller, or my father, Thomas Shaughnessy. What? Or Brian Powers? What? Fernando Calderon. Who knew we were Spanish? Your father seems to have a life that we didn't know about. Wow! Encrypted government files. This doesn't make sense. Sure it does. Dad works with government agencies all the time. No, no, no. This is Tom Clancy kind of stuff. Mega-high clearance. - How do you know that? In gaming club, some of the guys were into hacking. You hacked dad? No, I figured out the password. Add the digits of your birthday to the digits of mine and divided by the sum of the digits of mom's birthday. Encryption 101. Wait, you saying that your dad has files he shouldn't have? He...he...hello? Meredith? Listen, sweetie. I love you very much. You and the kids have to stay together. Don't talk to anyone. Don't trust anyone, not even the authorities. I have to go. I love you. Was that dad? Where is he? I don't know. Is he ok? I don't know! Hmm! This a phone? And there's a camera in my navel. Way to live up to the legend. I want my family to know I'm ok. I understand. But you're not, are you? Ah! Ok, um, your father said: "trust no one, talk to no one, stay together." What does that even mean? - I don't know. Doesn't sound good, whatever it is. I'll get an explanation from your father, I promise. Whoa! Check this out. A credit card with no spending limit, and the last charge is from yesterday. "where?" you should ask. Where? Switzerland. A store that does custom t-shirts. Dad's order was sent to an address in Geneva. Bam! Ten hours ago. Miss Widmer, I apologize, but it's a family emergency and I have to leave immediately. No, I will not let Sarah attend alone. Listen, I'll call you when I get back, ok? I'm sorry. Thank you. What? No, absolutely not! You are staying here to look after your brother. Dad said to stay together and you said to trust him, so we have to do what he says. Honey, this could be a very dangerous trip. Yeah, which is why you can't go alone. I'm not buying you a ticket. - I'm 18. I can buy one myself. With the surplus college money I have. Who knows if I'm even going to college now, anyway? What? I'm at least taking a gap year. Come on, don't do this to me right now, ok? Please. Fine. We can talk about this later, after we go to Geneva. I have got my passport and my clean underwear. Let's go. No! You guys! Listen to me. I know what your father said about staying together, but taking the two of you is completely irresponsible. Ok? I will take care of this. You don't have to do everything yourself, mom. In fact, you can't. Have you read any Tom Clancy? Dad's broken his cover by warning us, which means he's in danger, which puts us in danger. That's why we need to stay together. To any enemy of dad's, we're valuable as leverage. If I were them, I'd so be stalking us right now. I can't believe I'm saying this. Let's go to Geneva. bGeneva, Switzerland/b This is the address from the t-shirt order. Simon? Simon, hello! Let me try something. You gonna whisper our birthdays into the keyhole? I'm gonna huff a puff and blow this house down. What are you doing? - Chill, mom. Do I even want to know where you learned that trick? It's like a puzzle, making the tumblers fit together like they're supposed to. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me, please. Simon? Simon! Hello? Simon! Ok. You were right. Here's dad's stuff. Here's the shirt dad bought with his credit card. It's french. "it is time." An ad for swiss watches or an existential statement. Well, he placed a custom order, so it has to mean something specific. What are you looking for? Hidden messages in the seams. It's a civil war spy trick. Hey, Einstein, you're a couple centuries behind. Ok! Nobody moves! Oh please, not now. What time does the clock say? When you're done "geeking" out, care to come back to reality? What time does it say? Which is? Which is? Come on, help me out, people! Which is 1:30. No! All right... You see this map? - Uh-huh. The map and the shirt go together. aviation or european time. What? A meet, dead drop, brush pass. Dad was supposed to meet at this point on the map. The shirt identifies him like a wearable password. Just admit it: For once, I am a genius. Yeah, you are a genius! Ok, it's 13:35 now, which means dad must've been delayed, couldn't get back here to get the shirt... And had to go straight to the meet. Going there is our best chance to find him. Hey, we are doing pretty good, the 3 of us! Let's go! Come on! All right. Oh, I'm so sorry. Sorry, sorry. Sarah, Sarah! No, trust her, mom. Hi... What's she saying? I don't have a clue. What's he saying to her? Uh, you are clearly a young lady of great intelligence who was raised by a wise and loving mother. Then again, I take latin, so I'm guessing. Merci beaucoup. Ok, I deserve extra credit in ap french for this. There was a band that was scheduled to play at 1:30, but apparently they're running late. Sarah, that's amazing! A band? Rock and roll spies? That would be so awesome. Or not. Here, let me put the shirt on. Uh-uh! I don't think so. Mom, this is how these things are done. Yeah, and it's also how people get hurt. I'm not gonna allow you to make yourself a target. I'll put it on. Mom, that's not any safer! You may have a point, but it's part of being a mom. Kevin! What... Kevin! Put that down, Kevin, this is not a bullfight. Kevin, give me the shirt now! What are you thinking? Where did you buy this t-shirt? I don't do eastern bloc. Sorry. I am Luka. Oh! I like your shirt. Where did you purchase? Oh, this is my husband's. I know your husband. He is a good man. He's coming to the fair, hmm? Oh! I... well, we hope so. Had you planned to meet up with him? You know what? I guess we got our wires crossed. I'm sorry. It was nice to have met you. Come, guys. Stay! Enjoy the atmosphere! We will wait for him together. It's ok, really. We have to go. Hey, let go! Hey! He's trying to steal my mother's purse! Simon says get in! Ok, ok! Get in, get in, get in! Go, go, go! Hello, Millers! So, you hungry? Thirsty? You must be. You were exposed to a little action down there, you must be a little hungry. I just wanna find my husband. I know, but Simon would never forgive me if I didn't care for his family. So what's it gonna be? You know dad? I know dad. Kids... Your dad is like an inspiration to me. He's efficient and he's reliable. He's a good guy. So, what's it gonna be? Chocolate? Cheese? I'll be back. Amanda, do you and Jeffrey work for my husband? Actually, he works for me. Is this about corporate secrets? I'm going to have to explain some things. I knew it! You're C.I.A. No, sweetie. We're not. See? D.I.A? N.S.A? Simon, Jeffrey and I are operatives in the Clandestine Activities Division, C.A.D answers to the executive branch only. You're making that up. I've never even heard of you. Well, then we're doing our job properly. So Simon is a... - Covert intelligence operative. A spy, mom. Wow! Um, ok, what... what about the geology? It's a passion of Simon's, which makes it a very effective cover for him. What lie do you tell your family? I don't have one. Few of us do. That's what makes your father so exceptional: His family. - So where is he? We're trying to determine that. He missed his last check-in. What was the mission? We are helping the dr. Roman Malinkov, a Chechen scientist, and his daughter, escape to the United States. Corrupt individuals in Chechnya threatened to hold his daughter hostage and force him to do his research for them. Malinkov reached out and we agreed to extract him. There you go. Dad's working for the good guys. I knew it. The girl is his daughter, Anya, reportedly a science prodigy, determined to follow in her father's footstep. His wife died 3 years ago. So Simon is bringing them to safety. Yeah. - What went wrong? - We don't know. He was supposed to go to the street fair and meet the Malinkovs and the last handler. But Simon wasn't there. - Mm-mmm. The Malinkovs weren't there. - No. Nobody has heard from either Simon or the Malinkovs, in over 12 hours. Well, if someone were holding Simon, they would've forced him to go to the square to pick up the Malinkovs. Simon, don't make me end this the wrong way. Hey. This is bogus. We can't sit here and wait. We've gotta get out there and find dad. I'm in. What? I agree with you. Wow. First my father's kidnapped, now my sister's replaced by a pod. Go ahead and joke, but you're the only one I have faith in now, Kevin. Dad is a professional liar. Mom is just being mom. And that leaves you. So be straight with me and I've got your back. I know you didn't cheat on your math exam. Thanks. Hey. Um, I wanted to give you this credit card. in case of an emergency. Ok. Oh, um, Jeffrey was able to get our things and your dad's. Look what I found. Hey! That's nag's head. Awesome. He travels with a picture of us. We're a prop, part of his cover. Sarah, please. You can't say you don't feel betrayed. Aren't you wondering how many times he's lied to you in all the years that you've known him? You're not angry? 'cause I am. No, Sarah, I'm not angry. I'm furious. I'm devastated. I'm barely holding it together. But I've been in love with your dad for... A very long time and... ...I just need to hear the truth from him. He still deserves a chance to explain. Don't we all? Sarah... Sorry, honey. - That's ok. What's this? What if dad's gone to the other side? I mean, that would explain why he's disappeared, right? I mean... Sweetheart, listen. I know how difficult all this has been... for both of you, but your dad... No, he would never do something like that, ok? Never. So then, let's go. I mean, we're not going to accomplish anything, just sitting around here. Such a spy. Why would I drag you here just to poison you? What do you want? Why did you interrupt my mission? My orders were to intercept and contain because you went rogue. And you believe that? Not completely. Then I find you off the grid and the target missing. What am I supposed to think? Malinkov took his daughter and went underground because someone betrayed them, put their lives in danger. Why didn't you report that? Jasmine, there's a traitor in C.A.D.! I don't know who, I don't know where, but I had to get off the grid. That's the only way I can figure out what's going on. How do I know you're not the snitch? Come on! I have a family. I have kids. You know me! Do I? You've been doing this job for years. Anything is possible. But I'm inclined to give you just enough rope to prove yourself. How much rope is that? I have to get to my contact's designated fallback. Amanda, what are you doing to find my husband? I've wanted to meet you. Though I do regret these circumstances. I've wondered about you. Why? Most of us don't have families. It's too hard, always putting the job first, lying to people that you care about. And so I wondered about the woman who made Simon feel that the struggle was worth it. Worth the lying but not worth the truth? Not really sure that's a compliment. We're not allowed to tell the truth. It's a given in our world. I'm sorry you had to find out this way Or at all. - I can't decide whether I'm glad I know or not. Hmm... Would there be any reason for Simon to take the Malinkovs back to Chechnya? No. We don't even want to contact the Chechens, much less take the Malinkovs back. Why? I'm just trying to understand how the game is played. And how well my husband plays it. This was in dad's suitcase, but I can't make sense of anything on it. You sure it's dad's? Oh yeah. The password is "blue beauty". The house we rented in nag's head. Figure he's carrying that picture around for a reason, don't you? He loves us, Sarah. We're not a prop. We're his family. And he can't always take the time to tell us, but we matter to him. Yeah. I hope you're right. I hope we get the chance to make sure. So, anyway, these are just basically cryptograms, but I haven't found a cipher that works. Well, you know what dad would say: "try harder. "four steps forward, Sarah, you just might have inadvertently stepped into the realm of total brilliance. Four steps forward, which is a net of 2 steps, so place every letter with 2 letters ahead and... And nothing. Ok. We can do this. All right, 4 up, 2 back. That's it. Use every 4th letter, then go and... Yeah, it's still gibberish. Wait, no, it's not. It's french. He's in Paris. Ha! Well? Sarah, you are a genius. I've got an address. Let's go tell mom. Mom! Mom! Mom! We cracked the code. If the transfer does not happen in Geneva, meet our friend in Paris. What? We found dad! bParis, France/b You sure this is the place? It's the address from the message. Apartment 4. All right... Whoa, whoa, whoa! He may have company, and they may not be friendly. Everybody ready? Come here, please. Thank you. Get over here. Ok, ok. Oh! Ma porte! What are you doing? We're so sorry, we made a mistake. Uh, there's been a mistake. Excusez-moi, madam. Excusez-moi. Bunch of vandals! What happened back there, hmm? He made a mistake. I know, but we just can't afford any mistakes right now. We don't want half the Paris police force chasing us. Ok, buddy, you're gonna have to fix this, ok? Everyone's counting on you, including your dad. What you got? Let me think. I decoded the address as 1241, apartment 4. But the 2 steps back aspect of the code could also mean it breaks 2 digits from the end. A 3-digit address with a 2-digit apartment number. Exactly. Which direction? Let's hope you're right. This should be it. All right. You guys ready? Uh, maybe I should handle this one? Please. Be my guest. Let me see... Um, I hear it's a lot like a puzzle. Oh! Ah! Good morning. What's your name? I don't speak English. Great. I spent my career on the russian desk. I don't speak spanish. - Neither do I. I can translate if you want. You speak spanish, too? - Yeah. Good! Find out what he knows. My name's is Sarah. What's your name? Andres. Andres Velasquez. He's Andres Velasquez and he says that we should leave here because it's dangerous. We're trying to find my father. Your father works with the government? Me too. I work with Jasmine. We were supposed to meet here. I got here early... someone hit me and took the USB drive I had for her. He works with Jasmine and they were supposed to meet here but he got here early and somebody knocked him out and stole the thumb drive that he was bringing her. Did he see his assailant? Um... Did you see your assailant's face? Do you know my father, Simon Miller? Or Thomas Shaughnessy, or Fernando Calderon. Kevin. I met him. But I didn't know he had a family. He's met dad, but surprise, didn't know he had a family. Meredith, may I speak with you? I don't want to worry you any further, but this Jasmine that he mentioned, she works for us. We suspect her of being a traitor. You think Simon could be with her? Part of Simon's assignment was to track her down. We're concerned that Jasmine is planning to trade the Malinkovs to another party for her own gain. Even return them to Chechnya? That would be the worst-case scenario. I think my father and your friend are together and in danger. What's the last update from headquarters? They're required to check in each hour when tracking a missing agent. And if they don't? Jasmine believes there is a traitor in the organization. Would a traitor check in? He just said Jasmine's name again. What is he saying about her? I don't know. Sounds like he's asking for coffee. Do you think there might be some in the kitchen? You want coffee? I got it, Jeffrey. You want anything? I don't want any coffee. I want some answers. Ask him again. Hey, genius. Check thoroughly before coming back and saying that you couldn't find any coffee. Ok. Ask him again. Slow down, slow down, slow down. Slow...slow down. What, what? Tell me. Tell me what he's saying. It's ok. Andres has to help us find Simon. We need to proceed carefully. Well, as long as we proceed. I need to get to my husband before he makes a terrible mistake. The new target has arrived. I'll trail them, and they should lead me to Malinkov. Perfect. Keep on it. It' s about time. When are you going to deliver them? He said something about Jasmine. I wanna know what he said. What did you say? Andres, Andres. Uh, no coffee. - Sorry. Sarah. - Mm-hmm? I'm gonna hurl. Ok. Mom, mom! Kevin's sick to his stomach. What? What happened? Where is he? He's in the bathroom. Oh! Tell me that's not your friend. - No. I know him. I used him on a pretty nasty job in Zagreb. Yeah. I came up against him in Mombasa once. I certainly didn't invite him to this party. Neither did I. So a 3rd party's looking to cut us off. I need to contact someone I trust at headquarters fast. But I don't want to go through the usual channels, ok? Simon, don't let this be the first time you let me down. Kevin, let us in. Come on. Uh... Ok, come on. Get in here, quick. What you find on Amanda's phone? Wait. You're not sick? What are up to? Andres says that Amanda should be checking in with headquarters on the hour. We wanted to make sure that she was, see if she's being straight with us. She's the only one helping us. Why don't you trust her? She's made a lot of calls to a guy speaking kind of russian. Is Kevin all right? Andres said that there is a traitor in C.A.D. I know. Amanda says it's Jasmine. What if it's Amanda? You sure you're all right? Um... I'm not sure. Can you give us a minute, please? She's been so helpful. She's been keeping us close. If you're ever gonna trust me again, trust me now. Your phone buzzed. Why did you hang up on me? I didn't hang up on you. I didn't call you at all. Do not play games with me. Can I come in? Oh! Get on the couch. Told you these guys are more trouble than they're worth. You can do what you want to me. Don't hurt my children! Need me to translate that? I thought I could use you to flush Simon out. But now you're in my way. There are consequences. Thought you'd never ask. No! Take him out of here. Come on, guys. Let's go! Jeff! Jeff, Jeff! Quick! Move, move! Go, go, go! Go! Go! Hurry! Go! No! Hurry! Go! Come on! Go! Go somewhere safe. Don't talk to anyone. I understood that! Oh! Go! Come on! Get out of the way! Now what? Message from Andres. "Amanda's radioactive. Beware." Welcome back, Simon. I was never gone. - I thought we could visit the crypts... Alain. Uh, sorry, mademoiselle, this section is closed for the moment. We came all the way from providence. What a disappointment. Oh! Providence! My nephew attends university there. Perhaps I can be of some small help. Hmm? This way. Where have you been? We've had people on the ground in Geneva, ever since you broke contact. And now you're in Paris? What are you doing in Paris? Just got here. Jasmine's with me. She just got word Amanda's dirty. Amanda brought Jasmine in to take me out. Wait, you think Amanda's involved in the Malikovs' disappearance? Appears to be the case. Boss, put yourself in my shoes. First you disappear, then you reappear with a suspicious freelancer, and now you're pointing fingers at your superior. What do you expect me to do? The only action you need to take, is to not tell anyone, not even Donna, that I've made contact, until I can contain the situation. Pamela, you know you can trust me. Ok, agreed. But if we're going this way, There's "intel" you should know. Amanda's in Paris with a woman and 2 teenagers. What? Are you positive? I'm afraid so, Simon. I'm tracking Meredith's credit card. No hits yet. If you get any new info, contact me immediately. Will do. I gotta go. Is that a secure phone? Yes, it is. - I'm taking it. No, no. It's impossible. I... I just don't know what we should do... ...where we should go. Who we can trust. You don't trust dad anymore? I want to. I really want to. Don't use the phone. They'll track you. Let them try. Mom, don't answer that. Hello? - Meredith? Simon. I love you. I know there's a lot you want to say to me right now, but I need you to listen to me. I'm listening. Are you and the kids all right? For the moment. Are you in Paris? - Yes. Go home now. Don't trust anyone, especially Amanda. Well, we could've used that advice a while ago. I can't explain everything right now. Just, sweetheart, please leave before it's too late. Simon, wait. Where are you? Just tell me what's going on, please. I got... I gotta go. We're not leaving without you. I am done with all this. What a mess. I am so sorry that I've put you through this. And now I'm crying. and I just don't want you to see me like this. It's ok, mom. You're entitled. Yeah, it's ok, mom. You guys have been so sweet, and smart... and beautiful. I just wish he could see you. Mom, we'll make it. Listen to me. We're gonna make it, the 3 of us. Yeah, we're here. I love you guys so much. Come here. Oh! Can you imagine if I had been alone? We can't stay here. We're going to the american embassy. Let's go. Ok, let's get this cab. Get in. Oh! No! Go, go, go! Oh! Mom! No, mom! Now what? You, um, were at the street fair to meet Christophe Meder. No, I was looking for my husband. Yes. Everyone's looking for your husband. We missed him in Geneva, so we came here to Paris, which was the next stop on our vacation. Hmm... What if dad's not looking for us? No! No, no, no. I'm going down this road. We're gonna track down dad until he gives us an explanation. He owes it to us. And meanwhile, we're gonna find mom. That's what we're gonna do. I need you. I can't do this on my own. Dude! I need you. Ok? Ethan McFarland was testing an app that could remotely access a phone and check its GPS. There were a few bugs, but it's worth a shot. An app to find mom? Nice work, Einstein. I've talked to our people in Budapest. Christophe Meder, have you worked with him? I know him by reputation. One of the finest operatives in europe. Meder picked up dr. Malinkov and the child in Budapest on schedule. He was supposed to escort them all the way to Geneva. But they didn't make it? Meder's body was retrieved from the Vlatva river Last communication we had from him was simply: "K at G-5." Was Meder scheduled to stop in Prague? - No. The Malinkovs? They are lost. Or worse. Stay calm. Stay calm. Look around. Don't stare at the ground. Look at people, but not too long. What do you see? No one is following us. Are you sure? What about the man in the blue jacket? He is just buying jewels. Watch. He'll pass us. I'm so sorry you have to learn these things. May we go to the baker again tonight? Of course. Of course. Voil. Merci. Come on. Come on, come on. Oui? Yeah. Good luck. Got 'em. Got 'em. Got mom. Taxi! Taxi! Ok, ok. Sorry. Thank you. My kids! My kids! We got... Suivez ce taxi. Now, what? Don't you have an app for that? Aaah! Da... dad! I am so glad to see you guys. You ok? No, dad! If that's even your name! I'm not ok. I'm furious! I know you are, sweetheart. Listen, first thing's first. Where's your mom? Is she ok? She inside in enemy hands. All right. Jasmine and I are gonna go in and get her. You two... Will come along and help. Ok, come on. I really, uh, need to go to the bathroom. Up to you. Hey! Come on! What are you doing? Oui, tout de suite. Come on. Room 203. She must be up there. I know it's mom. Ok, stay here. - We can't. They'll make us evacuate. All right, come with us. You guys stay behind us. S'il-vous-plait, Monsieur et madame! We are getting out of here. Hey, hey, hey. Shhh! You have to be smart. Do you understand? Please, you must exit immediately. Ok? Kids, take your mom. Go to the stairs. Go now! Go! Ah! Are you ok? Yes! Ah! My babies. Was that Jasmine? - Yes, she seems nice. Yeah, for a trained assassin. Guys, guys! Is everyone ok? Yeah. - Go down quickly. Quickly. Oh! Go! Now! Is it broken? I'm gonna get help, ok? Stay here. I'm gonna get help. Guys, gentlemen. Can I? I just need one minute. You gonna be all right? - Yeah. I'll come to you as soon as I get them on a plane. You think we're going without you? I need you to be safe so I can get back on mission. Your mission? What about us? I have to help the Malinkovs. The operative that was bringing them to Geneva is dead and they're in serious danger. Where was the operative killed? In Prague. Then the Malinkovs are in Prague. No, that's bad strategy. They would be on the move. Yeah, but Malinkov isn't a spy. He's a scientist. More importantly, he's a father, so his priority is protecting his daughter. I mean, he's probably gonna hide and wait for help to come. You go, mom. The last transmission could be a coded message About where the Malinkovs are hiding: "K at G-5". Then Prague, here we come. No, Kevin, it's not that simple. Yes, it is. Jasmine can't go with you and you need help. Besides, Amanda and Jeffrey are still out there somewhere. So we aren't safe anymore. Our odds are just better if we're with you. Meredith, help me out here. No. Because they're right. We got a short train ride to de gaulle airport and then... Off to Prague. This is so cool. Yeah, at least we get to fly, since... Ta-da! Dad will get on a plane. Honey, you ok? No, I'm not ok. This is not exactly the right place for this, but... Uh, I need to say it. A few years ago, I found myself in a situation where I could help someone. Kind of like what we're doing for the Malinkovs today. And it worked. I actually saved someone's life. And I realized that maybe that's why we're here, for those moments. Then C.A.D. approached me and I became a spy. Not because I wanted to, but because I wanted to make the world a safer place, for our family, for everyone's family. I wasn't allowed to tell you guys. And believe me, that's been the hardest part, but despite all my absences, and my lies, and the dangers I've just exposed you to. I'm still convinced that I did the right thing. But I just want to say that I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I'm grateful that, you know, after all I've put you through, you still believed in me. I didn't, dad. - What do you mean? Nobody was trying to believe in me, so I didn't try to believe in you and I'm so sorry. No, baby, it's all right. What are we talking about? - School. They accused her of cheating, but she didn't do it. Charlie Peterson told a bunch of us, that he could get a copy of the exam in advance. Oh, Sarah... Believe me, I thought about it, But I didn't look at it. I told Charlie to forget it. And then I paid Jenny Abraham to tutor me. And I studied harder than I ever have. Look, I'm sorry I even thought about it. Honey, I'm... I'm sorry. Uh, excuse me. Do you speak english? No, I don't. Man has a sense of humor. We're completely lost. What we're trying to do is to find the Eiffel Tower. Get lost! Give me one good reason, why I shouldn't shoot you myself? 'cause I'm the only friend you've got. Do you know what you have cost us? Nothing! We can find Malinkov before they do. Simon can also turn us in. Simon is focused on Malinkov so he can complete the mission and get his precious family back home. It's a momentary advantage and it's all we need. No, all we need is the $3 million from the Chechens for returning Malinkov to them. That and the Millers dead. Good night, sweetheart. Good night. Hey. I really am sorry about the whole calculus mess. Sweetheart... I'm sorry you had to go through all that because you felt like you couldn't talk to me. When we get back, your mom and I will go to miss Widmer with you, and get this resolved. Ok? Thanks. You're fighting a good fight. Proud you're my dad. Get some sleep. I'm the one who never really gave her a chance to explain. Why didn't you tell me? Because, I... I feel like it's my responsibility to figure out the right time to bring these kinds of things up. I never wanted you to feel like you had to judge the moment to tell me anything. I know, but I... I just wish you could know what it feels like, to be on this side, in the dark, knowing there's something... And then finding out like this. I mean, I'm just...I'm still trying to figure it all out. I'm gonna help you put the pieces together, ok? Ok. You guys hang onto these. These are for your mom. I can't believe she's still sleeping. Ha! Your mom's been through a lot, Kevin. So, what are we gonna do about the Malinkovs? None of our contacts here in Prague have seen the Malinkovs. They didn't even know Meder was here until his body was found. So "K at G-5" didn't mean anything to your contacts? I thought it might be a club or a restaurant, but they came up empty. Maybe "K at G-5" refers to something other than the Malinkov's location. Or it pinpoints their location. Come on, it's a classic! Sherlock Holmes, mr. Spock, all the greats have used chess as code. So K at G-5. The king and the G-5 square on the chessboard. Yeah. All right, let's see. G-5 is just north of here. Kevin, I think you're on to something, buddy. Thank you. He's a friend from college. We were supposed to meet near here, but I seem to have the wrong address. - Do you know him? Uh, sorry. I've not seen him. Thanks again. We're gonna go to every store in the neighborhood? Patience, sweetheart. This job takes a lot of patience, and a big appetite. Hey! - Yum! Thank you. We should do this more often. What? Chase scientists across Europe? No, go out for ice cream. Mmm! Mm-hmm! Localized. How can I help you? Uh, do you speak english? Ok. Um, do you know them? Yeah. You do? - Mm-hmm. So they've been in here. Here. 3 evenings. "Don't close! Don't close!" So they come in when you're closing? - Uh, yes. That... them? Yes. Diky. Thank you. They've been here. Wow! We... we found them. They're good kids. Thanks to you. I'm sorry you had to carry all that weight. Excuse me. Dr. Malinkov. You are mistaken. Dr. Malinkov? No. You are mistaken. No, I missed you at the street fair. Which... which fair was that? In Geneva, at the old clock tower, at 13:30. Yes. I'm sorry. We were not there. There's a flight to Paris at 11:00. We can make it. I thought we were lost. I knew I could not go back. But I wasn't sure how to move ahead on my own. No, you did the right thing. You protected yourself and Anya. And now they send a whole family for us, papa. Aren't you impressed? I am, Anya. So am I. Forgive the confusion, dr. Malinkov, But you and your daughter are gonna have to come with me. Not gonna happen, Amanda. Sorry, Simon, but it is. Dr. Malinkov, slowly, please. Your turn. Oh! Come on! Quick, quick! Go! Go! Quick, quick! Is everyone all right? Yeah. Our people are waiting for you at the embassy. We'll take the Malinkovs straight to the airport. I look forward to your full report. That was seriously awesome. I know. The look on Jeffrey's face, when mom took him out, priceless! Oh! Your mama's a lot cooler than you thought, huh? Oh yeah! Check it out. Oh my! Oh no! Check it out! I'm serious. She brought it out. There he is. Ah! - Ladies and gentlemen, this is dr. Roman Malinkov. Roman, these folks are from various agencies within the us government. This is the director of international relations... Hey, tell your dad to take the job at mit. Then you'd live in Boston and I... We...we could come see you easily. I would love to go mit and study biological engineering. Seriously? I'm taking a look at their electrical engineering program. It's so exciting to already have friends here in America. We're glad to have you here. I'll give you my email and cell, so as soon as they give you a phone, we can talk. Uh, I really enjoyed meeting you. Me too. Anya? Anya, come say hello. It's so quiet. Too quiet. This how you feel when you come home from a mission, dad? Kevin, when I come home, I feel grateful. Yep. Mmm! Sweetie. You all right? Yeah. Glad to be home. Me too. Mushrooms? Not quite there yet. You can break into encrypted computers, figure out the most complex algorithms and you can't chop mushrooms? Something's wrong. So we're going back to being normal just like that? Yeah, right! When do we do it again? Yeah, I must admit, these have been the most nerve-racking, frightening, exhilarating days of my life. Can't let all that greatness go to waste. We were a great team. Can't we just enjoy this masterpiece peacefully for once? It's not cooked yet. I was talking about my wonderful family. My talented, hard-working daughter and my very special Einstein here, and of course, my ever-beautiful wife. Hmm! Snap peas. Aren't you gonna answer that? No? What about making the world a safer place? For our family. - For everyone's family. Simon, I think you should answer the phone. I'll tell them I'll call them back. Wrong number. Oh! Oh yeah! We'll be in Geneva if you need us.
