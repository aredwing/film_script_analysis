 

                        The only thing I know for certain is that these are bad people. We look forward to working with the Blair Governnment to deal with the issue My parents went to Pakistan and they saw a bride for me. My mum come back said I should go out to Pakistan and get married. So I got a ticket and I went. Can I help? I'm all right. Have you got everything? -I'll be ten minutes. -Okay, hurry up, quickly. I didn't really wanna go because I had a job, I was working. But she was telling me "lt"s time for you to go to Pakistan" I left from Birmingham Airport. And from there I went straight to Faisalabad. And then I caught a taxi to my village. My father was there at the time. - Oh, Salaam. Hello, Asif, how are you? - Good. i'm alright. I was there for about four days. I saw the girl and I decided I would get married. So I phone Ruhel. -Hello, Ruhel? - Asif, what go on? I ain't heard from you in long, man. Well, when he asked me to go to his wedding, I thought "Yeah, why not?" "End of the day he's my friend and I should go!" And also, it' be great holiday. See you later, all right. - Come back soon. - All right. I'll come back soon. Bye. I wanted to go to Asif's wedding, plus I hadn't been to Pakistan for like 13 years And I wanted to see some of my family again. -You got a passport, yeah? Visa? everything? - Yeah, i got it, man. - You all right, Monir, yeah? - Yeah, i'm good, man. How are you? oh, Can't believe we're going to Pakistan, man. It's gonna be mad. Mlonir was a very nice guy He was Bengali like me He would never say anything bad against anybody. We landed at Karachi. We didn't want to stay in the hotel cos we thought it'd be expensive. So we went to a mosque. - Salaam alaikum. - Alaikum salaam. Crowds marching in the streets of Karachi today... ...organised by Pakistan's Islamic parties, they're supporters of the Taliban. It's one sign of the politcal turmoil that seems... certain to follow American military intervention in Afghanistan We spent about a week in Karachi. Walked around sightseeing. Going shopping, just chilling out. Shafiq went to visit his family... ...so me and Monir had a few days to ourselves. They were supposed to come to the Village, but, instead... ...I ended up going to Karachi. When Shafiq came back to Karachi, he brought his cousin Zahid with him. - Where are you from in Pakistan? - I'm from Multan. Ruhel was kind of like my best friend, yeah. Even though he was Bengali. I'Ve known Asif since the day he was born. - What's been going on, man? - Mainly I've just been shitting. It was Friday prayers and we were walking past the mosque. A lot of people were going in, so we went in with them The bombing of Afghanistan!... ...the forcible change of power in Afghanistan... ...this can only lead to chaos and terror. People get hyped. Then they start shouting slogans out. The preacher was saying "You should help the Afghani people wherever you can". And also was thinking of going to see what Afghanistan is really like. If everyone agrees to go, then we go. Because it's only 250 rupees. If we're going there, we're going, One: For experience and Two: To help You know the food there as well... You know the naans? Big naans, you know that. Big naans. I've seen naans this big. What language do they speak there? Can I speak Urdu to them or what? - I think they speak Pushtu there. - Pushtu? We don't know yeah, basically.... The only way we know is if we go and see it. Grab that cushion, man. Give him the rice and that. No-one's even eating it. If that's all we're doing in Afghanistan, that'll be a good thing, you know what i mean. Basically, while i was there, the two weeks, all the people I spoke to in Pakistan... ...they were saying, "Oh, Afghanistan's not gonna get attacked". So, we jumped on a bus and off we went. - Are you all right? - No. In Pakistan many people have beards. There are always good and bad people. Have you seen the flies up there? In the night, the bus driver hit someone. An we all got out to look. The bus driver just ran off. So we had to find another bus driver to drive us to Quetta. When we got to Quetta, we had to change buses. Just before we got to the border, we stopped at a mosque. That's how I got left behind. Where's Shaf? Stop! We've left someone! Can you take me to the Afghan border? Border trade continues unimpeded. Amongst those crossing are brave Afghan aid workers. The people rely on them for food and health care... ...and to explain their needs to the outside world. They come on motorbikes and we paid them, 200 rupees. An they took us across the border. - We'll come back for you tomorrow. - Shut up... I ended up walking across the border. No-one stopped me. Where the fuck were you?! You dickheads. How could you fucking leave without me, man? You love to shit, dldnt you? Next time you can shit in the van Hurry up. And when we crossed the border, it looked like "Oh, it's nothing... ...you just cross over", it's not even like going into a different country. But once we got there, it was a different situation. You see that? Soon as we got to Kandahar, that's when the bombings start happening. Fucking shit. Look at that. It's terrifying. You see something like that in the movies only. Please let me sleep. Why are you making noise? I feel like shit, man. Oi...Look at them naans. Fucking big. - Yeah, they're massive. - We'll get two. Give me some. Kandahar in the south of Afghanistan. The Taliban heartland. These pictures from Al-Jazeera show support for the Taliban... ...seems still strong here despite American bombing. Long live Osama Bin Laden! We just spent one day in Kandahar and then we left for Kabul. The journey to Kabul was terrible. Just go to sleep. By the time you wake up, we'll be there. Can we stop? He's really sick. No, we're not stopping. How far is it to Kabul? Ten to twelve hours away. Are you okay? You're fine. Don't worry so much. There's nothing wrong with you. Tell him to shut up, man, Asif, man Pull yourself together. - Is he hot, man? - Tell him to shut the fuck up, man. We'll stop a few minutes. US bombing raids continue around the clock... ...attacking Taliban tanks and trenches north of Kabul. We stayed in Kabul for about two and a half weeks. (RUHEL): Wait, I want to buy some... - Let's get out of here before we get mobbed. SHAFIQ: (MUMBLES) - Mad fucking shit, man. Do you want a bite,man? Do you want a bite? It stinks. It's just like spices and shit, man. (RUHEL) Enough of that shit, yeah? He went that bad in Afghanistan that I thought he was gonna die. - How are you feeling? - I'm cold, man. Put your head up, man. Put your head up. - This bread is shit. - Better than nothing. You know the stuffed crust pizzas... ...with the melted cheese in the crust,man. I think the naan's getting to you. What's wrong? What's wrong? Go on, eat it like a... Eye witnesses are describing the latest American raids on Afghanistan ...as the heaviest bombardment so far. Once again the capital Kabul is bearing the brunt of the attacks. Residents have described wave upon wave of aircraft... ...an a huge fire out near the city's airport. We were basically just chilling out. And we were just getting pissed off because we're not doing anything. This is not what we came for. Salam Alecum Do you speak Urdu? Is Sher Khan here? We want to talk about something. We want to go back to Pakistan. Why? We're not doing anything here. We're not helping, just lying around. Can you arrange something for us? Okay, I'll sort out a car for you. Really? Yes, no problem. - What did he say? - He'll sort out the car into Pakistan. - Sure. Yeah. For the first time bombs landed in the centre of the Afghan capital. This is said to be a residential area. No deaths were claimed here, but the Taliban say 15 people were killed... ...when a missile struck a mosque in Jalalabad. -Is this going to Pakistan? -Yes, let's go. Come on, let's go. We just got on it, assumed it was taking us in the right direction. We're buying these lot drinks now as well. Jacked us last time. An we ended up in this house in the middle of nowhere. That's when we was thinking, "Where the hell are we? What's happening?" This guy used to come to us and we used to ask him every day. Then one day he came and took us to Kunduz. The United Front soldiers on the road to Kunduz... ...were in high spirits this morning. Word was out that the city was about to fall... ...an these men hoped to be among the first to drive in. Everywhere you looked there was foreigners.. And you could tell... ...they were all fighters because they had the Kalashnikovs. Bombs never dropped in town, but they dropped on the outskirts. Once we were in Kunduz, we were trapped. Zahid, what's he saying? He's talking about the war. Two years ago in Dostum's jail... ...he had his fingers cut off one by one. His brother was killed. He was pulled apart by two tanks. Dostum? Who is it? Dostum, the guy who is bombing on us. They shouted: "Long life the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan" And 'Death to America'. Basically, I thought, "This is gonna be my last few days". Northern Alliance Commanders say this... ...is the last battle for the Taliban's last northern stronghold. News came that they have actually broke the front line in Kunduz... ...and had actually entered Kunduz and everyone started panicking. Everyone just ran towards the trucks. What's going on? We started looking for Monir, we couldn't find him. Wait, Shaf. We gotta get Monir. You've got to leave now. Where's my friend Monir? What's happening? Some have already gone. Let's go. ok, Let's go check in here, Shaf. Monir? Monir? Monir? Monir? Monir? we have to go now. Lets go! He's not here, cousin. Where's Monir? Let's just get on, man. We have safe passage. Monir! Is he on that one? Monir, where are you? An we ended up on the trucks and people going "Oh, You'll find him, you'll find him". But we never did So that's the last time I seen Monir. We just literally drove about a good hour, to the outskirts of Kunduz... ...and they dropped us off. They had to go back and collect the people left. We told each other that we're always gonna stick together. And then all of a sudden there was bombing. Wait there. Wait there, man. Ruhel. Ruhel! Ruhel! Fucking hell! Get up! Run! All night we went in a big circle and we came back from where we started off. Salaam. - Salaam alaikum. - Alaikum salaam. Yo Shaf! I'm going this way. Shafiq and Asif were on that truck. If I put my shoes on... and got on to the truck, then maybe we wouldnt be alive And you could hear people screaming, and every person I came across... ...basically either his legs or arms were blown away or his stomach was popping out, his arms come off. When someone's in agony and you can't do anything for them... ...it affects you in a big way. What's happened? Bomb blast. Are you hurt? Are you all right? Where's Shafiq? Over there. Water? Ok He was basically just covered in blood. Every part of his beard, his face, everywhere, was covered in blood... ...and you could smell the stench of blood on him. Ruhel! -Ruhel and the others were on the truck and I just jumped on - Asif! We watched as Taliban fighters crossed the front line... ...in a long stream of Vehicles. This is the largest single surrender of Taliban forces... ... that has been witnessed by outsiders such as ourselves. The United Front knows that the eyes of the outside world are upon them ...and especially on how they treat their prisoners, Afghans... ...but especially those from outside the country. We came out with this hope that they are our brothers, they are Muslims... ...and they would not abuse us or treat us badly, and that's also what they promised us. They did not take us far. It must have been about 3 or 4 miles Come on! Sit down! Take him. No talking! Everybody down. Silence! Search them! I thought the guy's gonna kill me, because he started pointing his gun at me. What is this? Huh? What's this? This one's Pakistani. That's for you. Pakistani! Come here! At that time I was thinking, they're gonna open fire on everybody. And in the distance they was like, they were making mass graves for people... ...and they were throwing bodies in. And you could see on the other side... ...there were people who had been injured and you could tell they were still alive... ...and they were throwing them into the ditch as well. They tied our hands behind our backs... ...really tight, so you'd lose circulation in your arms. Fuck. There's a massive ditch there. They sat everybody into the ditch, and around that ditch there were gunmen. An everyone thought "Yeah, they're gonna shoot everyone in this ditch, and kill us all". Me and Shaf managed to get on the same truck. Asif was with us, but because the truck was full he couldn't get on. It must have been about a day, a day and a half to Mazar-e-Sharif. Me an Shaf were lucky, we got on to the canvas container. It was ram-packed. After about five minutes, it started getting really humid. And it was starting to get difficult to breathe. Some people, they were screaming. Some were banging, some were praying. I got up and I started screaming. And, like, the guy who was next to me, he pulled me down. As he brought me down, it was, like, easier to breathe. All of a sudden I just, just got knocked out. A few hours later we heard shooting we didn"t know what it was It went on for about half an hour. Then, all of a sudden, it went quiet. Next time I woke up there was all light inside the container. And then I noticed there was a body next to me, there's a body underneath me. It was wet and really cold. And I had a, had a cloth.I ripped the cloth and I start.. ...wiping the water off and just squeezing it and drinking it. Check them. Get up! Aqu est. Get up! He's dead. Who's still alive? This one. Get up. They were taking bodies off the trucks, dead bodies... ...and throwing them on to a pile and searching their pockets. I didn't know what was happening. I was just like a zombie. Asif. You could smell the stench of, like, it was death you could smell on him. Are you all right? Is Asif okay? He's got a bullet wound. Sheberghan Prison, Northern Afghanistan. Hundreds of Afghan and foreign fighters are being held here... ...in extremely over-crowded conditions. These Taliban fighters are presume highly dangerous... ...after the recent riots in nearby Kalajangi prison... ...where several hundred Taliban prisoners... ...over-powered their Northern Alliance guards. You'd go for days without food or water. - The bread's here. The bread's here. - Bread! - I've got some,man. - Give me some! - Give some to Asif. - Yeah, I got it, I got it. At night it was so crowded that we had to take turns in sleeping. Once the Red Cross came, things started getting better. - Where are you from? - I'm from Pakistan. In the prison everyone told us "Just don't say you're British". - Ah, What's your name? - Ramesh. - Ruhel? Where are you from? - I'm from Pakistan. Give us one. (Asif) Here, man. Can I have one, please? - i think We should tell the journalist man our story. - Fucking sell him it, you know. Just stick to the story. We're from Pakistan. Then we'll get home quicker.

Okay, thank you. Listen, you're in US custody now. It's okay. - Take him away and search him. - Search me? Bring me Shafiq Rasul an Asif lqbal. - Get up. - Why search me? We're primarily looking at... ...detainees that we can use for collecting intelligence. Shafiq Rasul! - Get out! - Move it. Because you live in Britain, you got this thing about Americans, you think, "yeah, Americans, they're all right". - Name? - Asif lqbal. I thought, yeah, it's all right now... ...I mean, nothing's gonna happen. well, I was wrong. Where are you from? From Pakistan. Don't lie to me, Shafiq. Where are you from? From Pakistan, Karachi. Don't fucking lie to me! One more time now. Where are you from? I live in England, but I came from Pakistan. - Ah Okay. - Came here from Pakistan. Sit up straight!

See him on his knees, they think he's praying to the Queen... All right, all right, that's enough. Thanks, anyways. Get some sleep. Hey, sit down. - No walking around. - How come? No exercising.

Come on, move it, move it. We found a file in a cave in Afghanistan, says you're linked to Al Queda. That's bullshit. - We found your brother's file as well. - That is bullshit.

He's crazy, man, just leave him. - Sit the fuck down! - You shut up. - You're fucking mother's a bitch. He was mentally disturbed before he even came to Cuba. And he used to shout at everyone all the time. You've seen nothing yet, motherfucker. - Beat the shit out of him! - Hold him down, hold him down! He's mad okay, so just leave him! Sit the fuck down, you'll be next, motherfucker! Fucking leave him! - Get him out! - You're all fucking crazy monkeys... - Get him the fuck out of here! - Throw that shit on me, you're next! Get this shit outta here! That's only a taste, motherfucker I've been told we haven't found your file in Afghanistan... ...it was someone else's. So, what were you doing in Afghanistan? Hey, you. Wake up. There were rats, mice, there was snakes, you know scorpions... Man, don't move. Wake up. Don't move, Don't move, I'm coming in. - Don't move, I'm coming in. - Fuck. Don't move. Fucking hell!

All right, everybody, show's over, get back to sleep. Asif and Shafiq were kept in Camp X-Ray for three months. Ruhel Spent six weeks there. No talking The US Government announce today that prisoners... ...are being transferred to a new purpose built facility... ...in Guantanamo Bay, named Camp Delta. Put him in cell 11. Were you a member of Al Queda? No. How long were you in Afghanistan? You know I can speak English, yeah? - I'm British. - You speak English, you don't need a translator? Are you a good Muslim?

Fucking hell, you lot got a five star here. - They'd still have you in the dog kennel. - You fucker. Keep it down, keep it down. Oh, no, like toothbrush. fucking hell. We were in Camp Delta for about a year an nothing happened. Just the same questions over an over again, and then it all changed. I wanna show you something. You said you were wearing an Adidas tracksuit? Adidas tracksuit bottoms, yeah. That's not what you said. Why, what is this? This is your friend Asif lqbal... Who? No, it isn't. This is you, in your Adidias tracksuit. that ain't me, man. I've never worn an Adidas Tracksuits, I've told you, I wore Adidas bottoms. That's not what you said. Recognise him? Mohamed Allah?

I told you, that's a fucking good picture but that ain't me...becos that ain't me... Cell seven. Where the fuck did you go for so long? You must be Shafiq Rasul. I've come from Washington. This is a rally In Afghanistan. Do you remember being here? Watch closely, I want you to tell me if you recognise anybody here This is Osama Bin Laden. He's addressing the rally. These people sitting here, you recognised any of them? Asif...Ruhel, you... That says 2000 here. 2000, Is that the date? That's what is says. I wasn't even in Afghanistan in 2000. I was working at Currys all through the summer. It may not be 1st of August, it may be January 8th. It doesn't matter, I was working at Currys throughout the whole of 2000. I wasn't even in Afghanistan. I can see you on the tape in Afghanistan... in 2000 How can it be me if I wasn't even in the country? because I can see you on a Video with your friends Ruhel and Asif... ...listening to Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan. The woman who was in there said to me and... ..."We've put people in isolation for years and eventually they break". I was there about 3, 3 and a half months. Stand up. Stick your arms through. Have a nice day. Ruhel? - Who's that? - Is that you? - Asif? - Is that you? - What are you doing here? - You all right? Yeah, man... how are you? All right, man. It was a whole different story for us now. It was like we were getting punished, then it was nice for about two, three months. There's a hook on the floor... the leg irons are attached to a hook. Then they put your hands between your... ...ankles at the floor and chain you to the hook on the floor as well. They keep you there for an hour... ...sometimes two hours, five hours, six hours. You can't go to the toilet. You have to urinate and defecate where you are. Help! Hey, shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up, okay. - Have a look at it,man. - Fuck off. Are you a faggot? You can't handle this stuff? Fucking knob. Why don't you just sit there and jack-off for another four hours. - Do you drink water? - Yes. - Are you a member of Al Queda? - No. - Have you met Osama Bin Laden? - No. - Did you fight with the Taliban? - No. I was put in a room with AC on and then i was put in stress positions Help! They wanted me to say I was a fighter. Once I said that, the next thing is "You a member of Al Queda"? Once you say you're a member of Al Queda, that's it. - Did you say you were a fighter? - Yeah. Just get me out of here. - No, you're fucking staying right there. Are you admitting to me that you are a fucking fighter? Is that what you want? - Yes! - Yes! - You are a fighter? I said it was me. I said, "If I admit it, what will happen?" He says, "You will go to Court". I said, "Give me a pen and paper, I'll write it down for you". I said, "That's me in that photo and I was there". Hello, Asif. Your case is gonna be taken to a Tribunal. - How do you feel about that? - That's good. - Excuse me? - I said, "that's good". that's good? Why do you say that? January I'm in England. August I'm in England. It's not a problem, I can proved I was in England. I'm not bullshitting you. Go and check it out. For me and Asif the police were our alibi. All that year I was doing Community Service and Probation. One was for Violent disorder... and the Second one was for fraud and deception. So, even if it was January or August... ...I was still covered because the whole year I was in and out of Court and the police station.. I have some letters for you. - I'll give them to the Americans to censor. - Okay. I'm here about the Video. How many times do I have to answer these questions? If you're not here to help, I've got nothing to say to you, just go. -i am here to help you. - You came before, you did fuck all. I'm sorry. Fuck off, man. Just fuck off. - You guys fucked up. - What? You were belligerent and uncooperative. Where are my letters? They said they would give them to you. You're not gonna get your fucking letters back. You were uncooperative. Fuck off, man. After about three months, they dropped it. They said, "Okay we made a grave mistake". Congratulations, you've been cleared. Then we were all taken out of isolation and put together... ...and we started being called 'The Three Kings'... ...because we used to get four meals, double meals. Films every Sunday, McDonald's, Pizza Hut... I want you to help us. I want you to come, work for us. If you work for us, I'll get you out of here in a couple of weeks. Fuck that shit. Working for you. Fuck off. Ruhel, Shafiq an Asif were kept in Guantanamo for another 3 months. - Hello, how are you? - Okay. How are you? I am well, thank you. They were still not allowed to see or speak to their family or lawyers. Sign this piece of paper saying that you were detained in Guantanamo Bay... ...because you were linked to Al Queda and the Taliban. No. Go fuck yourself. Fuck you, I ain't fucking signing that. Then you're never going home. It was never confirmed. They never said "oh, It wasn't you". They never admitted to them being wrong. More than 750 people have been imprisoned in Guantanamo. It is estimate 500 are still there. Only 10 have ever been charged. None have ever been found guilty of any crime. CAMP DELTA - JTF GUANTANAMO hey, hey, Don't look out the window! Hey, princess... You hard of hearing? - What's your fucking problem? - Don't look out the fucking window. Do you want me to send you back? - Do you want me to send you right back?! - Want you to send me back, yeah?. Boys, this one wants to send me back yeah! You know one thing? You can't send me back. You don't fucking own me! Move the camera, man. Fucking move the camera! British detainees arrived home today from Guantanamo. They were flown by the RAF to Northolt where they were taken... ...by police to Puddington Green Station before being released. We went to a hotel. I got there first and I was waiting there for about... ...five, ten minutes, and then there was a knock on the door. It was my dad. We just kinda hugged... Didn't really say anything. It's completely changed my life. The way i look at things, the way i look at what's happening in the world The world's not a nice place. Looking back on it now, yes, it was an experience. And it has change my life for the better, so I don't really regret it. I haven't changed a great deal. Just that I practice my religion more. I mean, I didn't even practice at all before. I think it's best for me to like...to move on with my life. To start stepping forward instead of looking back. It's time to move on. Same smell. It's amazing. Didn't he say if we went straight from Lahore, we'd go a different way? Ask anyone and they'll tell you. Hello? Who's this? Is it getting hotter or is it me? We've reached our hotel in the town centre. Where's Merchung? It's that way. Keep going that way for Merchung. Chaudry Iqbal. From England. I'm here! WELCOME ---2nd JULY 2005---
