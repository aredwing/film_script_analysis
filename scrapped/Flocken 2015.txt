Our Father in heaven, we ask thee for this marriage that Fredrik Ostholm and Anna Granberg have joined into in front of you... Help them create an open and warm home where their children are safe and their friends comfortable. Help them forgive each other. Let them daily receive joy and power from your heart. In Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. They're coming! So far, so good. I'll kill anyone who stumbles. - You'll slaughter us, or what? - Turn right here. Here, girls. Careful! There's only one cake. - We'll die if the cake falls. - Our lives depend on the cake. It's swaying! Don't drop it! I'll go first. - Hold it really tight. - Damn, ifs swaying. I'll go first. Alex, could you serve this? I wasn't going to make a speech today. But when you get married you should thank everyone, so I'll give it a try. First Ian. Where are you'? Damn, Ian... I almost started believing in God today. It was so goddamned funny... I'm sorry, I swore again. That's not really my thing, so... But thanks, though. And before my brother finishes all our alcohol, I want to thank him as well. Bro, boss... Without you, I don't know what I would have done. You can still beat me at arm wrestling, but l bench press more than you. And I also want to thank Susanne. - Cheers, everyone! - Cheers! Right, one more person to thank! David! Remember when we were kids, and I drove that moped through the ice? Without you, I wouldn't be here today. And I am eternally grateful to you. Thank you. You're like a brother to me. I think I should shut up now and let the party carry on. - Thanks for coming. Cheers! - Cheers! Did she die, or something? Hello? - Come help me, damn it! We can't leave her lying here.

Are you all here to attend the court case B 2044-14'? - Yes. - I must tell you about a decision. The hearing will be held behind closed doors. Because of the ages of the involved parties. - What does this mean? - That only directly involved parties... wand custodians are allowed into the court room. - I don't understand this. - You can't be there. Jennifer, can you tell us what happens after Alexander gets you on your back'? You've said that he's sitting on you, holding your arms down. What happens after that'? He... He...'? It isn't easy to talk about this, but we have to move forward. Then what does Alexander do'? - He takes out... - He takes out? - He takes his penis out. - His penis? And what do you do then'? Does he do anything'? What happens after he takes his penis out'? Does he try to do anything with it'? He tries to push it into my mouth. He pushes it into your mouth. Do you do anything'? I try to get loose. He's holding me down. You try to get loose, but you cannot move at all? - No. - Does Alexander do anything else? He... - He jacks off, and... - He jacks off, you say. He comes on my face. He comes on your face. I have no further questions for Jennifer. Well, Jennifer, I also have a few questions to ask. Correct me if I'm wrong. Didn't you and Alexander often go to this bathroom together? - I mean before this event. - Yes. What did you do in the bathroom? - I don't know. - You don't know'? You have to remember something you did. Didn't you make out in there'? - Yes. - So you used to make out in there? - Only sometimes. - But not this particular day? - No. - So what did you do? - I don't know. - You don't know'? Then why are we here? You seem confused to me. Are you sure you remember what happened in there'? - He raped me. - So you used to make out in there? - But on this day, he raped you'? - Yes. - Have you ever feared Alexander before? - No. - Never felt threatened? - No. Alexander isn't a trouble maker, or someone who fights in the school yard. - No. - Yet, he suddenly raped you'? - Yes. - You're sure of this? Did he put his penis inside of you? - Did he put his penis in your vagina? - No. - So where was it'? - In my mouth. I have no further questions. We want to refer back to the first interview made with you, Alexander. - Okay. - Tell us what happens in the interview. He said we could go home if I confessed. - Who said you could go home? - The policeman. He said I could go home once we were done. To you, that meant that you had to say you did it. Yes. - Your statement then is not correct? - No. You felt forced to confess to something you didn't do. Yes. I have no further questions. Alexander, when you were interviewed, why did you tell the same version of events as Jennifer told the police and the court? Do you have any explanation for that'? - I just said something. - You "just said something". Something that exactly matches Jennifer's story. I don't know. Okay, Alexander, but... If we buy that, how do you explain that Jennifer was bruised in the places where she should for your first version of events to be true'? - I guess she fell, or something. - "Fell" '? Yeah. Well, in that case, I have no further questions. Thank you. I thereby declare today's court session finished. Sentencing will be carried out today at 2 PM. Don't look at her. They're vultures. - We should tell them to fuck off. - Never mind. Ifs five of. CORKYCORKY: Suspended sentence and a fine! SHOCK!
