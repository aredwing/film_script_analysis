 

                        MALE: What's up ladies? [CHATTER] Thanks. What's up ladies? I got beers! [WHOO] Here you go. One for the lady. Thank you. One of the gentleman. I got an idea. How about some day time skinny dipping? No way. Aww, come on babe. I'm gonna swim to that buoy and back. And I make it, you gotta go skinny dipping with me. [SCOFFS] [CHEERS-WHOO] A little further. [LAUGHS] Ha, Ha! Yeah! Told you he's make it. Unbelievable. Well, do you want to strip down now or wait till he gets back? MALE #1: Whoo-hoo! MALE #1: All of it. - Yeah. - Now the bottom. I don't think so. [SCREAMING] Polly! MALE #1: Polly! Polly! Male #2: Mark! Get back onto the sand! There's a shark in the water! Hey, what the hell is that? MALE #1: Get her out of the water! MALE #1: Get out! MARK: She was just here and now she's gone. [WHIMPERING] Get out of the water. Hey- MALE #1: MARK! MALE #1: [CRYING] Somebody. [SCREAMING] FEMALE: Mark! Polly! MALE #1: Oh my god. What is it? Do you hear screaming? Screaming? No. I'll go check it out though. [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [CRYING] [BEEP-INTERCOM] Calling Dr. Thomas. Maggie, the new intern has arrived at the island research facility. I will go up to meet her and will drop by your office in 30 minutes. [BEEP-INTERCOM] Actually lets make that 15 minutes. We're heading up there now. Hello, you must be our new intern. Maggie Peterson, I presume? And you must be Dr. Nelson. Please call me "Ted". Come inside. Okay. Watch your step. Oh, that's Dr. Leonard. He doesn't do well around people. Especially if they're new. But at any rate, welcome to Persephone. I'm thrilled to be here. Where can I start first? Testing Ph levels, or helping with today's specimen acquisition? Raring, to go, huh? I knew we hired you for a reason. But you've gotta crawl before you walk, so, let's start you with orientation. [FAKE ENTHUSIASM] Oh. Great. It's not like pulling teeth, I promise. So you really signed up to work in this godforsaken bunker, huh? An opportunity to study the Great Pacific Garbage patch up close and personal? I'd never pass that up. Besides, you get to do all the cool stuff here at Persephone. Deep-sea dives. Animal discovery. Save the ocean. Well most of the time, it's just paperwork. MAGGIE: Oh. Dr. Nelson: But don't worry. We'll find you something exciting to do. Come on. Let's store your gear and I'll give you the full tour. Perfect. Absolutely perfect. Professor Thomas? I've got someone here that you may like to meet. PROF. THOMAS: Oh! You must be Maggie. MAGGIE: Professor. It's such an honor to meet you. Please. All I do is study garbage. [LAUGHS] Oh, we're about to go on the big tour. Would you like to join us? Yeah! I'd love to. You know what, we have some visitors coming today. [RECEPTIONIST] Calling Dr. Thomas. The Earth Pact has just docked... DR. THOMAS: Actually, they've just arrived. So, why don't we all do the tour together. You 2 can come with me. MALE: Hey Brad, wait up top with the bags while we go down into the facility. Earth Pacters! Hello! Welcome! We're so glad you could make it. It's always nice when we can work with new, potential colleagues. I'm professor Laura Thomas. And this is Dr. Ted Nelson, and we have our newest inter- Greg?! [CHUCKLES] You've gotta be kidding me? Care to introduce us to your friend, Maggie? Uh... Sure. This is Greg. He's a, um... We us to date in college. Before I dropped out, that is. Naturally. I haven't seen you in what? 3 years? Yeah. Something like that. [CHUCKLES] You look great. PROF. THOMAS: Now that we're all acquainted, why don't you follow me. PROFESSOR THOMAS: So guys, currently we're half a mile under the ocean. This underwater station is so special to everyone that works here. With 45 qualified research staff. Selected by the worlds leading marine biology university programs and special interest groups. We have 2 state of the art underwater docks, and 3 submarine vehicles capable of collecting samples from the ocean floor. And Procuring specimens of local marine wildlife. I'd like to formally welcome you to the Persephone. It's truly one of a kind research station. We built this station on an island right next to the Garbage patch, and it features a central crater right down into the ocean. There are a group of smaller islands scattered around the facility, used for above water operations. It's the only research station that allows us to fully study oceanic, plant and avian life that could be impacted by the nearby pollution, as well as flora. We are so pleased that Earth Pact has agreed to send you all out here for the day, so you can collect all the information that you need. Yes. It's something that we've been pushing for a while. To get activist groups, like yourselves, involved and get that facts that you need. Yep! We believe that science and activism can go hand in hand, and be a powerful force for change. Well, why don't we get right down to the tour, shall we? Dr. Nelson I'm going to let you handle that. I'm gonna head to the control room. Have fun. Okay Maggie, why don't we take Greg and your friends and we start at the top floor? And that why we get your tour done as well. Sounds great. So, uh, we're with you? Looks that way. Guys, this is my old friend, Maggie. Maggie, this is Ryan, this is Allison, and this is Omar. MAGGIE: Did you gain some weight? Or something else. This place must have cost a fortune. GREG: I always expected I would see you again. GREG: I just didn't think it was going to be here. Well, surprise, I guess. I mean, I always figured you'd end up at a place like this, though. And? Yeah. You were always talking about being a scientist. Trying to invent something to save the planet. Yeah. And you were always saying, "the only way to change things, was to get out there and fight". I guess not much has changed there. Still. We both wanted the same thing, right? GREG: A better world? Sure. Just different... methodologies. We still ended up in the same place. Maggie. Greg. Try to keep up, please. DR. NELSON: In here we look very closely to how pollution is affecting the habitats surrounding the Garbage Patch. And what this means to the animal life native to those eco-systems. Most organisms we across are normal. But we've been seeing some anomalies appearing in some of the creatures. Every 4th or 5th specimen we pull out from the sea in this are manifests a mutation. We keep them all here to study. But enough of that and the facility. On to the people that make it all happen. DR. NELSON: This is the Specimen room. That's Betts and Sandoval over there, hard at work. This is where we study animal life native to the island and the waters both below and around the Garbage Patch. Check their pollution levels, look out for anomalies? You got it. ALLISON: Whoa, check these out behind you. RYAN: Weird. OMAR: That's crazy. These are amazing. Did you guys notice anything interesting? Yeah, they're mutations. Really unique ones, from the looks of things. DR. NELSON: That's correct. Every fourth or fifth specimen we pull from the ocean in this area, manifest a mutation. We keep them all here to study. MAGGIE: That's the grim truth of what pollution does. Well, one of the things, anyway. This is what happens when people can just toss their garbage wherever they want. For instance, take a look at this turtle specimen. Exhibits the duel cranium abnormality. Wow. Far out. Check out this little guy. Geez. [SCOFFS] Real nice place you guys have here. MAGGIE: I don't know what's going on or what's happening? DR. NELSON: Something's riling them up. What could be causing this? This sort of behaviors is normally triggered by the presence of a large predator. But this is a bit extreme, obviously. Excuse me. That thing is pissed. DR. THOMAS: Hey Steve! How's it looking? The pollution levels at the Patch are looking pretty elevated today, DR. THOMAS: Huh. Steve: Other than that, everything seems fine. How are the new kids? They're wonderful. [PHONE RINGS] Sorry. I need to take this. Okay. [PHONE RINGING] Steve here. DR. NELSON: Hey Steve, this is Ted. We're down here in the specimen room. Something's riling these creatures pretty badly. Can you see if there's any seismic activity happening? Any sort of weather anomaly? STEVE: I'll give'er a look. Give me two minutes. Okay, thanks. - [HANGS UP PHONE] - What's up? That was the specimen room, something's spooking the mutations. Just checking the tectonic plates activity, or maybe... [BEEPING] That's weird. What do you have? Something big. Right off the shoreline. [SCOFFS] Could it be a piece of the Garbage Patch that broke off? Maybe something from the current that's coming up? STEVE: Nothing this big would move so fast. STEVE: I don't know what the hell this is. It looks like it's heading to the surface. I'm gonna go topside and check it out, okay? Oh hey, Steve, enable low alert, just in case. Okay. [LAUGHS] No way! Is that - is that a whale? All right! [ALARM BLARING] Professor! Something up? I don't know. Something topside. Ted come with me. You guys, stay here. [ALARM BLARING] I mean, it seems like that's where all the action is. That's what I'm talking about. Let's go. [ALARM BLARING] Ah, dammit! [ACTIVIST GROUP SHOUTING] Brad! Hey! Brad! Get out of the water! MALE: Brad! Did you ditch us? What? No man. I just left something on the boat. Oh you guys just missed it though. There was a big whale or something out here, a minute ago. Brad! Get out of the water, now! Nah, it's fine Professor. We've all kicked it with whales before. Are you serious, Brad? Oh, hell yeah! Here it comes again. You guys gotta see the size of this thing. What was that? I have no idea. Everybody, get back inside. Brad, stop being an idiot and get out of the water. I don't think that's a whale. [SCREAMING] Oh! [EVERYONE SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Brad! MAGGIE: Professor. Dr. Thomas: We need to enable higher safety protocols, now! MAGGIE: Everybody, inside, now! Greg, come on! [PHONE RINGING] This is Brian. [STEVE ON PHONE] Brian, I need you to lock up down there. Right. Okay. I'll do the best I can. [METAL/CRASH] [RUMBLING] Come on. [RUMBLING] [SCREAMS] We've initiated stage one safety protocol. We need to move on to stage 2. Someone just died. Attention Persephone. We are now moving to Stage 2 safety protocol. Complete lockdown. [ALARM BLARING] STEVE: Attention Coast Guard, this is Persephone Research Station 1. Requesting assistance immediately. Over. [STATIC] Coast Guard, this is Persephone. Requesting immediate assistance. Over. [STATIC] Mayday! Mayday! Coast Guard? Anyone? Do you copy? [STATIC] Something's jamming the signal. Elevated radiation levels from the garbage patch. STEVE: They play hell with the radio signal from time to time. Not great timing, Steve. Yeah. Tell me about it. Right. Um... So now what? We just wait it out? We have ruptures in the hull. We're taking on water in some places on main level 2. But it looks like we're working on getting those sealed off. Okay. Stay on high alert. All of you. Follow our safety- [INTERRUPTS] Professor. Professor, LOOK! It's building speed. [RUMBLING] This doesn't make sense. Sharks are hunters, but this level of aggression? It's unheard of. Well, I've never heard of a giant 3 headed shark before, either. But, I guess all bets are off at this point. [CRASHING] We got to seal this section off before we take on too much water! Come on! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Give me that radio. [THUD/HISSING] [EXPLOSIONS] [ALARM BLARING] [EXPLOSION] [DISTORTED COMPUTER VOICE] ...overload. Full evacuation protocol initiated. Holy Hell. We need to evacuate, now! [ALARM BLARING] Everyone try to remain calm. Follow me. Remain calm? Come on! Dr. Nelson, get these kids up top. Move! Go, go, go! Level 2-B, I got you taking on water. Steve, A-4 is taking on water. Way too much water. BRIAN: We're evacuating down here. I'm going to try to seal it off. You've gotta get out of there, Brian. Get out! Get out now, Brian! [ON RADIO] BRIAN: There's no way out. We- [STATIC] [BRIAN SCREAMING] Level C? Anyone copy on level C? I've got fires all over down there. [STATIC] Come in. [STATIC] [CRASHING] No! [EXPNO! ION] Professor, is there another way? That's the only emergency path to the emergency skiffs. MAGGIE: There's another option. The earth pact boat. We can still get there from here, right? Back to the main entrance? DR. THOMAS: If we move fast. MAGGIE: Then we'll move fast. MAGGIE: Where's the Earth Pact boat you came in on? PROFESSOR THOMAS: The island is flooding. It's got to further out now. There! You're crazy. I'm not going out there with that thing in the water. With the getaway route blocked off, this is it. Your boat's the only chance we have. I'll go first. OMAR: No way, man. Let me go. GREG: No, no, wait. We're not fighting about this. I'll swim out there, I'll fire it up, and I'll bring it closer. MAGGIE: Greg, I don't think- GREG: Maggie... Trust me. OMAR: Greg. Greg! [SIGHS OF RELIEF] Oh my god. Come on. [ENGINE SPUTTERING] It's gonna take me a minute to get this peach of shoot started. Just hang tight! GREG: Oh my god! Where do I start? See, that's what I was talking about. He doesn't even know how to start the boat. I should have said something. I got this. Ryan! [EVERYONE SHOUTING] He'll be fine. Push! Push! Push! Get in here! Good. [SIGHS OF RELIEF] Thank god. RYAN: Get up there! GREG: Start the engine! So, what do you think, Doc? You think we got enough time to get out there and make it or what? Well, normally we would. But nothing seems normal to me about this. [EXPLOSION] Guys, I can't stay here. We're gonna die if we don't leave. [ALL SHOUTING] Allison! Wait! GREG: Allison! Allison! No no no! Stay on the island! OMAR: You're not going out there alone, Allison! GREG: Allison! Come on, come on, Allison! Come on, come on, come on! GREG: Omar, it's right behind you, bud! GREG: Oh, come on! Pick it up! GREG: Swim Omar. Faster! Omar! [SCREAMING] Omar! Nooooo! Omar! RYAN: Oh my god! Greg: Get this piece of crap going! GREG: Allison, swim! [SHOUTING] GREG: Come to me, now! ALLISON: Throttle, Greg! GREG: Go, go, go! Allison, go! Go! Hey look at me. Look at- Guys, go, go! GREG: Get on the horn. Call the Coast Guard, call anyone. Mayday! Mayday! Coast Guard?! Mayday! Coast Guard, are you there? Dammit! What do you think? Come on. Come on. Can you get any closer? I don't think I can get this thing any closer to the beach without running it aground. We'd never get this piece of started again. There's no straight shot. We gotta get out of here before that thing attacks the boat. The radio's almost fixed, I can call for help later, okay? The thing destroyed the whole station. Just imagine what it can do to our boat. We're not leaving them. We're not leaving anyone else to die. All right, there's no straight shot. So, just hang on a second, Let me - let me find a way to distract the shark. Hey, Allison! Allison! Do we have anything on board? Anything at all we can use? Greg, you know we travel light. We don't have any - anything thing that's gonna reach that far. Ryan? I got nothing. DR. THOMAS: We need to get that shark out of there! I have an idea. I'm all ears. I'm gonna run in. Create a distraction. Head over that way. I'll get just as far as I can. As soon as It goes for me, and I mean, the INSTANT it goes for me... run and get to the boat, and get as far way from here as possible. Maggie, there's NO WAY we're gonna let you do that. It's okay, Dr. Nelson. This way, I can give you two at least a chance of continuing your research. Maggie, I can't let you do that. I'm sorry, Professor. You don't have a choice in this. Yes I do. You're not going to be the distraction. DR. THOMAS: I am! [SCREAMING] No! What the hell? [WHIMPERING] Oh my god! Maggie, let's go! Now! Maggie? Maggie? [GRUNT] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Allison: Oh my god! [SCREAMING] No! Come on! You can do it! RYAN & ALLISON: Swim! Swim! Greg: Come on, Maggie! Swim! Swim! [SHOUTING] [COUGHING] Drive! -Yeah! Ryan! Let's go, Ryan! Let's go! GREG: Get on the horn. Look how fast that damn thing is. I don't know if we can out run it. I guess we'll find out. [STATIC] - I think the radio's working. - Go, go, now! [BEEP/ALARM] Mayday! Coast Guard? Anyone there? [STATIC] Mayday! Coast Guard? Is that you? [STATIC] RYAN: Mayday! Coast Guard? Does anyone read me? RYAN: Mayday! Coast Guard? Is anyone there? RYAN: Mayday! Coast Guard? Anybody? Help! RYAN: Mayday! Coast Guard? Coast Guard, please? This is Max Burns. You're on the wrong frequency. BURNS: You've reach a fishing boat. RYAN: It doesn't matter. We need help from someone. Anybody. We're coming from the Persephone Research Station, near the Garbage Patch. RYAN: The station's gone. A lot of people are dead. Can you help us? Whoa, whoa, slow down. What do you mean, "attacked?" Over. My name is Ryan Bennett. I'm hailing you from the Transport vessel, Ps-001. [STATIC] Ryan: The station was attacked by a giant... 3 headed shark. RYAN: Destroyed the station. Killed almost everyone. [LAUGHS] This better not be a joke. Over. RYAN: Listen, man, I know how it sounds. But it's a giant 3 headed shark. [RYAN ON RADIO] It attacked the station. It killed almost everybody. BURNS: A 3 headed shark? What have you been smoking, kid? [CHUCKLES] I don't know what you think you saw, but- My friends are dead, man. Dead. You got to send someone, now. Ships. The Navy. I don't care. Get somebody out here. 'Cause that thing is right on top of us! Wait, wait, wait! Where is it? It broke off. RYAN: Over there! Oh no. It's heading right for that boat. CAPTAIN: Ha, these damn kids get some crazy on these things. Crazy. [CHATTER] [CHATTER] Hey. [GUESTS CHATTER] There you go, sailors. Thank you, Tori. [CHUCKLES] Come on, Mrs. Grant. You know your money's no good here. I told you to call me Rosemarie. "Mrs. Grant" makes me sound like my mother. [LAUGHING] Okay, Rosemarie. Thanks. You gotta listen to us. [RYAN ON RADIO] That thing is headed for another boat. Some kind of booze cruise. A lot of passengers. You gotta come now because... they're all in danger. [BURNS ON RADIO] If you're making this up, kid, it's your ass. Well, we're on our way. Let's go. - Ship in distress. - Let's go. [SCREAMING AND YELLING] I think I know what's going on. What is it? It's being drawn towards the pollution of the larger vessel. What does that mean? It's making it insane. If it destroyed that island and the research station, that yacht doesn't stand a chance, does it? I'm afraid not. [SIGH] We have to do something, you guys. We have to stop it. Stop it? Stop it with what? We don't have anything but our wet clothes. We have to at least try to warn that boat, if nothing else. We can't let it happen again. Not after we just watched all our friends die. GREG: She's right. We have to try to warn them. Well, you've lost your mind. GREG: No. They're the ones thinking with clear heads. We just watched all our friends get eaten by that monster. All of them. You guys want to save our own asses, while we let innocent people die? What if we can save them? All right. All right. GREG: Here we go. [LAUGHTER/OHATTERIWHOOS] [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] That's odd. Whale, maybe? The tour company didn't say anything about whale season. RYAN: Hey Burns. Burns? It's Ryan again. We're headed right for the boat. We're going to try to warn them but, we can use your help as soon as you can get here. Over. Earth Pact. On our way. Hang tough. That is really good news. Just come as fast as you can, okay? SNORKELER: A big shadow moved past me under the water. Did you guys see anything from up there? [SCREAMING] [CHAOS] FEMALE: What was that? CO-CAPTAIN: It hit us pretty hard. We're taking on water. CAPTAIN: Yeah, we've lost power on the port side engine. You round out and check the engine room, alert the crew, I'm gonna call this in. Yes, sir. Mayday, mayday, mayday. We're going down. Need assistance immediately. [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [CHAOS] Oh my god! [SCREAMING] [PANICKED] Hold on. Hold on. Howard. [CHAOS] [SCREAMING] Hey, if I can have everyone's attention, please. We're going to pull anchor here in just a couple minutes. The Coast Guard is on their way. Captain, help us! Where are the life rafts?! CAPTAIN: I'm sorry. Male: We need to get off this boat! Just tell us where they are?! CAPTAIN: I'm sorry, we don't have anything. FEMALE: What? No life rafts?! Are you kidding me?! [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [CRASH] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMING] Howard. [SCREAMING] I got you! Give me your hand. Rosemarie, give me your hand. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy. I got you. [SCREAMING] Thank you so much. Thank you. It's all good. Don't mention it. - Oh. - Oh shoot. [SCREAMING AT A DISTANCE] Now what? We're a sitting duck down here. This heap's on its last legs. From the looks of this thing, isn't doing any better than we are. We're gonna do what we came here to do. Try to help. Let's take that ladder all the way up. Come on you guys. Let's go. [CRASH/RUMBLE] ROSEMARIE: Howard! [HOWARD SCREAMING] Where did you guys come from? We-we were at a nearby research station. That shark attacked us, wrecked the whole place. We saw it coming this way and tried to warn you guys, but... You were too late. ROSEMARIE: My fianc, Howard. Relax. We have to rescue Howard. Where is Howard? On the other side of this door. It's locked. We don't have a lot of time, you guys. What about life boats? There no life boats. RYAN: Your kidding me. MAGGIE: Oh my god. Greg, how many people can fit on the Earth Pact boat? Maybe 12. I don't know, the engine's on it's last legs. You know, any extra weigh- [ROSEMARIE SCREAMING] Howard! Fine, I'll go get him. I'm going with you. Fine, let's just be quick about it. Greg, you stay here. Make sure everyone stays safe. Be careful. Hey man, let me see that. I'm coming too. Step aside. [BANG] Oh my god. This is bad. Howard? Howard? Let's go topside. Stay calm. Come on, come on. Let's go. Oh shoot. [SCREAMING] Greg: Go, go. go! Let's go! Let's go! Howard, can you hear us? Hey bud? DR. NELSON: Howard? Howard? DR. NELSON: Howard, can you hear us? DR. NELSON: Howard, can you hear us? Howard? Howard? Hey bud? Hey, Howard? Howard? DR. NELSON: Howard? MAGGIE: Howard? STANLEY: Say something. DR. NELSON: I see legs! There! He's over there. Howard! [GRUNT] [GRUNTS] You'll be okay. You'll be okay. We're gonna get you out of here, okay? Okay, ready? 1... 2... 3. [GRUNTS] Up, up, up, up. There we go. There we go. Slowly. Slowly. Come on. You go first. You go first. Easy. DR. NELSON: Yep, got it. Slowly, slowly, slowly. [COUGHS] [MOANS AND GROANS] FEMALE: It's gonna be okay. GREG: Hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me. Right here. Stay right here, All right? [PANICKED CHATTER] [CHAOS] Allison, put pressure on the wound. Keep that tight. Come on! Come on! ALLISON: I don't know what else to do? [RUMBLE] [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] [GROWLING] [CHOMPING] Stanley! Help! [GROWLING] Hold on. Stanley. Stanley. Take my hand. [GROWLING] Stanley. [GROWLING] No! No! Stanley! [GROWLING] Hold on! [SCREAMING] [GROWLING] [CRYING] [CRYING/SCREAMING/CHAOS] [CRYING] Greg, I can't save him! Rosemarie! Look! There they are! [WHIMPERING] [CRYING] You okay? It can only stay out of water for so long. We have to get to the Earth Pact, now. You want me to get back in that water? Hey, wait a minute. What about all these people? We can't save all these people! In about 2 minutes we're gonna be in the water, no matter what we do. Might as well get into the only boat we know that works. She's right. We got go, now! Come on. We got to get down there. [GROWL] STANLEY: Got here? GREG: Yeah, yeah, yeah. [GROWL] It's just a little wobbly. ROSEMARIE: I'm scared. STANLEY: Easy. Easy. GREG: Foot here. ROSEMARIE: What if I go backwards? RYAN: Be careful. Be careful. RYAN: Just hold tight. [GROWL] Step over here? GREG: One more. One more. Come down all the way. ROSEMARIE: Here? Greg: You're good. You're good. Right here. Here you go. Come over here. GREG: I got you right here. Hey, give me the axe. RYAN: Give me. STANLEY: What are you doing? You take care of them all, okay? Good luck. [GREG SHOUTING] Guys, we got to go! Come on! GREG: What is going on? GREG: Where's Ryan? What is he doing? Stanley? Yeah? Go start the engine! All right. [STARTING ENGINE] [GROWL] ALLISON: What do you mean? Maggie: Ryan! GET IN THE BOAT! ALLISON: Ryan! I'll catch up with you guys, okay? Come on. Come on. [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING CONTINUES] [SCREAMING] Oh my god. [SCREAMING] RYAN: Get out of here! [SCREAMING] Oh my god. [GRUNTS/SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Ryan! [SCREAMING] [CRIES] [ALLISON CRYING] Maggie: Its okay. Its okay. [CRYING] I'm sorry. How's it looking? Not great. It's got maybe 20 miles, if we're lucky. You're heading north? Yeah. And we're east of Persephone? Yeah. I see it on the left, why? Head north. North-west, now! And keep it floored. Are you sure? On the way to the Persephone, I passed a small atoll. Looked like a party pier type of place. Should be 10, 15 miles out. Do you think we'll be safe there? I think it's the only land that we can reach. Right now, it's the only thing we have. Hold on. Engine's looking rough, man. Yeah, yeah. I know. Just got keep driving till it gives out. Yeah, that's usually my strategy. Hey! Heads up! That thing's coming back guys. Doesn't that thing ever give up? Why should it? It's winning. [GROWLING] There. There it is! Think we'll make it? I'm gonna do everything I possibly can. Hey, I think that's Burn's boat. Finally! We're almost there guys. Get ready. Keep it steady. You got it. Send that thing back to Hell, would you? [GROWLING] This is our only chance, you guys. We have to swim for it. [SPLASH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Madre de dios! [INDISTINCT DIALOGUE] Damn! [SPLASH] [SPLASH] [SCREAMS] [SPLASH] Come on. [SPLASH] On my mark... Open fire. Fire! [GUNFIRE] [GROWL] Fire! Fire! Let him have it! [GUNFIRE] [GROWL] Unload! Unload! [GUNFIRE] [GROWL] [GUNFIRE] [GUNFIRE] [GROWL] Where'd it go? I-I think we got 'em! [GROWL] [SCREAMING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Ay! En el nombre de dios. [GUNFIRE] [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] [GUNFIRE] [GROWLING] [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] [GUNFIRE] [GROWLING] [SHARK GROWLING] [GROANS/GRUNTS] [GROWLING] [SPLASH] Sir? Are you okay? Yeah. Is everybody here, all right? [EVERYONE] Yeah. Okay as we're gonna be, I guess. I've never seen anything like that before in my life. [GROWL] [SCREAMING] [CHOMPING] Who's is that? Allison, come on! Come on, Allison! Hey! Hey! - MALE: [CRYING] Is he gone? - Who are you? [MALE CRYING] Is he gone? Hey! How are you feeling? I feel like I just got chased by a shark. [LAUGHING] [MALE CRYING] Is he gone? STANLEY: Who are you? [MALE CRYING] Is he gone? Is he gone? STANLEY: Who are you? Hey! Hey! What happened here? STANLEY: Jesus. You mean they can come this far up the shore and do this kind of damage? You've seen exactly what It can do. That thing can get to us no matter where we are. They how the hell do we stop it? The only things we got going for us right now are that, it can stay out of water for too long. And as Dr. Nelson tried to explain, it may need polluted water to survive. And it maybe attracted to to higher levels of pollution. Right. STANLEY: There's one more thing you know know. It grows more heads every time you cut one off. Like some damn hydra. That actually might be something we can us. How? It's getting angrier. More violent. You saw how each head was fighting the other, back there. STANLEY: Can we use that against it? How long have you been here? So it's not gone, is it? The-the thing that killed everyone. The shark with all the heads. [CRYING] It's not gone. [CRYING] Did you kill it? It- It's not good. [CRYING] We're all gonna die. How-how did you guys get here? Did you guys take a boat? Did you guys get dropped off? [CRYING] We came in boats. Flat boats. Like Pontoons? Yeah. Pontoons. Whe - where the Pontoons? They docked them on the other side of the island. Do you think they're still here? Are you kidding me?! I wasn't going outside the cabana with that thing still in the water. [CRYING] I just hide. Stayed as quiet as I could. Till I heard voices. Where are the Pontoons? Point them out. We can go, together. [CRYING] They're on the other side of the island. STANLEY: Where at? Over there. Are you sure? Pretty sure. All right guys, let's go. [GROWLING] All right you guys. We need to head out of here as fast as we can. You four, take that boat. Greg, Stanley, and I will take the boat back here. Allison, check the engine. Got it. Guys get in. All right guys. If we're gonna go, we better go. Let's go. Allison! It's working! Do you hear that? [CHUCKLES] Haul ass! Don't worry, you're safe now. We'll be back home in no time. Okay? We're gonna be okay. ROSEMARIE: No more sharks. Finally. [SIGH] [GROWLING] Hey! MAGGIE: Allison! It's behind you! What are they trying to say? Shark! Look! What's wrong? MAGGIE: Allison! Shark! [GROWLING] Allison! Guys! We have to do something! Turn around! STANLEY: Behind you! Right behind you! It's coming! MAGGIE: Look behind you! Shark! [GROWLING] Allison! MAGGIE: Look behind! [GROWLING] [EXPLOSION] Shoot. Greg, what are you doing? Greg, what are you doing?! We have to go save them! They are gone! Maggie, we have to save ourselves! No! We have to help them! There's something we can do! Please! We have to help them! Those are our friends. We have to go save them! Greg! Fine. What are you doing? We might be able to save our friends, but we're gonna kill that shark. Yeah, she's right. GREG: All right. Well? How exactly do you plan on doing that? The garbage. It's been the pollution this whole time. It's attracted to pollution. If we can somehow lead it back to the Garbage Patch, maybe we can kill it. MAGGIE: There will be so much to eat, it will go into a feeding frenzy. We'll get it to eat itself alive. How fast can you get back there? [CHUCKLES] Hopefully fast enough. That party is what, 10, 15 miles from the patch? Yeah. We're already halfway there. Hey guys? Look at all this garbage. Should be able to eat it the whole way back. That's perfect. Come on, Greg. Let's drive. Go! Yeah. [STARTS ENGINE] [SPLASH] [SPLASH] Hey! It's working! You got it! Keep going. Go, go, go. Hurry, hurry, hurry! We're almost there! [SCREAMING] It got 'em! Maggie! Go, go, go! MAGGIE: Stanley! Stanley! [SCREAMING] Relax. Relax. [GRUNTS] Sorry. It ate the last bag. It's okay. We ran out of garbage. It's okay. Don't worry about it. He ate the last one. I think we lost him. Don't worry, We'll get him! [GROWLING] Hold it tight, keep the pressure on. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Hey, he's still a shark, right? Yeah. Sit. Stanley, relax! Fueled by garbage and pollution, right? Yes. Stanley, what are you doing? [BREATHING HEAVILY] I'm not gonna make it anyway. What? Stanley! No! No, no, no, no! Stanley! No! [GROWLING] Wait, wait, wait! What are you doing? I'm gonna go save him! Maggie, No! Listen! Remember you told me that I was always a fighter? You've done enough today. It's my turn. GREG: I'll get him back! STANLEY: Get back in the boat! I got this! GREG: Stanley! Get back here! MAGGIE: Stanley! Come back! GREG: It's too dangerous! Stanley: I think IT'S WORKING. MAGGIE: Turn back now! STANLEY: The shark is starting to follow. GREG: Don't do this! STANLEY: Take care of Maggie. [THUD] Greg! GREG: Stanley! [BREATHING HEAVILY] [WHISPERS] Stanley. [GASP] Oh my god. GREG: The shark! Oh, damn! Greg! Hurry! Come back! Hurry! Hurry! Swim! Swim! Swim! MAGGIE: Greg! Swim! Hurry! Hurry up! Swim! [INDISTINCT AUDIO] [GROWL/CHOMPING] [GROWL/CHOMPING] MAGGIE: Greg! Now's your chance. Get back onto the boat! [GROWL/CHOMPING] [GROWL/CHOMPING] [GROWL/CHOMPING] [GROWL/CHOMPING] It's working! It's working! [GROWL/CHOMPING] Oh! You did it! [GREG LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] MAGGIE: You did it. Sit down. [HELICOPTER APPROACHING] We did it. [HELICOPTER APPROACHING] Get your feet out the water. [LAUGHS] Out the water.
