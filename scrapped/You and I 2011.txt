Otherwise, God knows what'll happen with you. Words that aren't Russian take me away from this shitty place. Little people break to China, little people fall to pieces, ugly, pretty, major, minor, shoot to kill nobody misses. Prison labor. Every day my mother tells me how lucky we are we are not like them. We have jobs We are free. There is one difference between me and them. I can go to Moscow I was born here. In this town my choice is simple work in the slaughterhouse or sleep with Vadim. I hate this place. This place sucks. Asshole. Yes, Janie? So where is she now? More lies about being stuck in traffic I'm stuck in traffic. Is Moscow. Oh look, the bitch got a new Porsche. Fuck off.

You're going to be very excited when you hear this, Max. We're really onto something different here. Music reflects the world around us, doesn't it, Max? I mean you remember when the wall came down. It was Bruce Springsteen and David Hasselhoff and so on and so forth and such like. It was sex, drugs and rock and roll, wasn't it? I mean we loved it didn't we? Every night we're all alone. Every night, my only hope is the light. That's shining from inside you. Cause you believe in what what we are. You believe in what we'll be. Give me strength. So I can stand beside you. No truth to conf... I mean, it's raw emotion, Max Do you know what I mean? - That's what I brought- - We. We brought. That's what we brought you today... raw fucking emotion. Dima's found his soul. It is very good. I mean it's a smash It's a fucking smash. - You wrote it yourself? - Da. - Every word. - Do you have more? I mean the boy's on a roll, Maxie. - He's a fucking genius. - One thing. It sounds like a girl wrote it. Yes, I mean absolutely. And I think that was the big breakthrough... that Dima's got in touch with his inner woman. I don't know. But still, it's a girl song to me. No, of course. but what you don't realize here, Max, is that it takes a man with huge testicles to sing a power ballad, and that is what we've got here. Make no bones about it, it's a fucking power ballad I mean it's just so fucking sellable. Come on, Maxie, let's talk dollars. - It will be a big hit. - So let's talk big money. Absolutely. Handle this right, we can make a lot of money. Whoever created this should get their share. If we can find her. In what we'll be, give me strength. So I can stand beside you. No truth to confirm, no lies to deny... What's this, Max? That's our fucking tune Max, I'll tell you what... I'll tell you what's fucking happened here. Me and Dima had put the tune on YouTube for a bit of a tester and these fucking tarts have stolen it. I mean has no one got any fucking integrity any more? Can I tell you what I think? Fucking lies, Ian. This is heartfelt and honest. Unlike you, Ian. - Get out! - Max. And you? No conscience left whatsoever? Max, the percentages are there to be negotiated. Out! Right. Okay, Max. What I'll do is I'll give you a call tomorrow, okay? Give you a chance to sleep on it, okay, darling? Speak to you tomorrow, Max Yes? Ciao for now. Dima.
