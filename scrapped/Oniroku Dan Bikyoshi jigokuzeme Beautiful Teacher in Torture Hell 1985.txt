Produced by KOJI OKUMURA Novel by ONIROKU DAN Script by TOSHIMICHI SAEKI cinematography by NOBUMASA MIZUNOO Dynamite. Scare you? - Eh? This your first visit? Saeko, why did you call me? When my school director asked for a new teacher... I immediately thought of you. You're somebody I never forgot. You aren't excited about coming here? - Not much. The director is excited about seeing you. Your fencing expertise will bring popularity to the school. I'm not certain. I'm just a teacher. Nothing more than that. Starring RAN MASAKI, IZUMI SHIMA and SAORI MIZUNO NOBUTAKA MASUTOMI, NARIO TAKAYAMA, HIROSHI NAWA Directed by MASAHITO SEGAWA BEAUTIFUL TEACHER BEAUTIFUL TEACHER IN TORTURE HELL Lately, your heart has grown cold for me... Teacher. I've reached a limit with you. I can't help what you feel. Get out of here. First, you opened your legs and said 'Come on'. And now you don't know me. What are you doing? Stop this minute! - Saeko! What are you doing? Shut up! Don't! Oh - so you want to play? Let's see what you can do. Damn woman! Don't do this! Stop now! Stop! Saeko! Please wait. I was wrong. No more. Saeko, are you all right? Today we will examine the philosophy of the Hagakure. Some people think the most important part is... ...not being afraid... to actually hide from the enemy. But the author wants to hide in an honorable way... So he doesn't feel the shame connected with his act. This is a complicated matter, dealing with his love. Love is often confused with - Ma'am. Yuki Tanokura. When someone loves... but refuses to submit to sex... ...doesn't that force the person to hide rather than to engage? ...Isn't there honor in that? The director was watching my first lecture. I broke into a deep sweat. Listen, Saeko - About yesterday... What happened out there? If I can do something - Don't worry about it. It's my problem to deal with. This is a rural place. You'll find frogs everywhere. You should be hibernating. We'll have to search for your bed. Next. -Thank you, mistress. Miss Tanokura, what did you want to talk about? I want to become strong. -What? My body is weak. And I'm slow. I'm no good at fencing. That's not true. Teacher, will you be here for awhile? - What? Yes. Don't move. Rest a little more. You passed out in the exhibit room. Miss Tanokura, who hit me? What are you talking about? There was someone else in that room with us. Yuki found you in the room and she came to us. Somebody hit me from behind. You know who it was. I don't know what you're talking about. Come to my house today. You need to rest. This house is very old... ...but it's nice. Because it's quite homey. What kind of student is Yuki Tanokura? She is the granddaughter of the school director. She lost her parents when she was young. Now, she lives alone with him. Well, about the situation today... I'm sure someone was in the exhibit room. You're talking about that again? Yuki is a bit unusual. But she has no reason to lie. Couldn't you be mistaken? Oh, we lost power again. Noriko, do you pray? I want you to pray... for Takashi. What's going on, Saeko? So big. How many times did you sleep with Takashi? Why are you...? Nothing happened between Takashi and me. You're lying! Takashi drowned while trying to save you. I can't believe he would've done it... if he didn't love you. Believe me. In fact... I love Takashi... but... I would not betray you. What do you mean by 'betray'? Everything was going good before we met you. We were planning to marry in Autumn. I was going to have his baby! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Saeko. Please. Please. Is that what you want? At school you look down on me. Hurry. Don't make me wait. We can't live. We can't live anywhere. But living is better than death - Death is no substitute... and then before we can - I'm in the middle of class. Before - I want to apologize for the situation. This letter came for you. That's Yuki's handwriting... I'm sorry. Work on the assignment. It's time to tell the truth. I'm sorry. Yuki, what's the story here? I was threatened... It's very complicated. I was told to take the photos. Who told you this? The delinquent. The village delinquent. He said if you want to get the negatives... ...come to the fencing gym at 8 o'clock. Teacher, don't come here. - Yuki Now I know you are the Fencing Queen. Please release Yuki. If you obey me. Oh. You want these, don't you? It's quite a good collection. Don't move a muscle. Don't worry. Everything will be all right if you obey us. What do you want? After a man is beaten by a girl... He wants to get back his pride. I want to fight you. Do you know how to fence? I know how to fight. Fighting and Fencing are different. We don't need a fencing lecture. Just give us one handicap. I want you to wear the body pads on your naked body. What a stupid request - Yuki - If you obey my orders... you'll get both the negatives and Yuki. You're a bastard. You want to help your student, right? Teacher, help me. All right. But don't try to break your promise. The fight continues until one side gives up. And what about the panties? You cheated - What's wrong? Have you lost your bravery? Once you put on the pads... your naked shame is covered. But your ass is fully exposed to me - Help! Someone help me! This fight continues until you give up. We can continue poking you for a long time We can keep doing this until your asshole splits. And shit starts flying everywhere. If you simply give up... you'll feel better. I give up. -Eh? Your voice was too soft. Use the voice you make when you teach your class. I give up. I can't take anymore. What are you doing? I will return the negatives and Yuki, but... First, my dick has something important to say. - No! Teacher, are you still there? I'm coming inside. Please wait. I need to continue practicing a little longer. Okay. Please lock up when you're finished. Good job. As a prize, I'll give you some secret information. The Fencing Queen is gang raped by delinquents. This is a very rare underground video. Which is more important for you? Me or the negative? I think the negative. Yuki - If it were just for me... you wouldn't have done it. I'm sorry. You would've helped me. I'm not myself right now. Teacher, what should we do? Now they will blackmail you with the video. I never run from a fight. I'm never overpowered by brute behavior. I will get the video... I'll keep them from doing this again. Are you doing it alone? All alone? - Yes. I will help you as much as I can. Come to my house tomorrow... ...so my grandfather can say thank you. Okay? Of course, I love my granddaughter very much. Yuki is the only one left to carry on the family bloodline. Last night you helped my Yuki escape a bad situation. Not so bad. You beat the deliquents who have been bullying her. You are the famous Fencing Queen. Good job. Oh, I didn't - I know they are very cruel. It must have been difficult. Please tell me the brave story. Didn't Yuki already tell you? No. Not exactly. How is it? It's delicious. Not the wine... I want to hear about the fight... Describe how you felt when the pads touched your naked body. What did you feel when they stuck the pole into your bum? You were raped by three boys... to protect young Yuki. Right? You are very rude. You know all the details. Yes... I was... raped. The photos were good. But the video tape was most impressive. What are you saying? The exhibit room. The gym. Both traps were my idea. It's my hobby to play with people in this way. Yuki, what is he talking about? She is a very considerate child, who did her job very well. It's not just for my grandfather. I also - You trapped me! Did you enjoy Yuki's meal... filled with sleeping pills? Are you finally awake? The candle and clothes was Yuki's idea... she was right. Why should I tolerate this treatment? Because you are beautiful and proud. I've searched a long time for a woman like you. What do you want me to do? I will teach you that slowly. Don't come near me. He is the lowest... most reprehensible man I've found. He will do anything to teach a woman shame. I know you hate him... but he's a very useful man for me. Stop! If you don't remove your dirty hands... ...I won't ever forgive you. Your eyes are full of anger. Forgive me. Now you say 'forgive me'... But before you said you'd never forgive me! Forgive me. Suck it. That was quite funny. I'll never do what you want me to do. Noriko, how sad for you to keep embracing your pride. Girl, you must be mortified. The Fencing Queen... proud and strong... has her cunt licked... ...by somebody like me. Please forgive me. Don't shame me anymore. The only time you'll refuse me is the first time. Soon you won't be able to live without me. This will cool down your emotions. Beautiful... from the island of Yakushima. Come in. How's it going? Good. She was difficult, but - Noriko, today I will listen to your voice. I will never obey anything you say... even if I'm dying! Animal! I'm hurt by your words... Because... An animal would never construct such a complicated environment. I'll change what I said. You are below an animal. I see you still have a sense of pride. After her! Hey teacher! You're surrounded. Come out! Saeko - Help me, Saeko. I've been tortured. I cannot help you. I brought you here for this reason. Why are you letting her do that? It's fun to watch women play with each other. Sort of like watching dogs in the field. But director - - Shut up You make too many mistakes. I'm not using you now. I've got some information for you. Four years ago... I set a trap for you... a trap for your death. You almost drowned because of me ... that was my plan. I never imagined he would die while trying to save you. I can't believe it. What are you saying? Stop, Saeko. Don't do this. I never forgave you for destroying me. For making Takashi love you. Please end it and kill me. Please. I can't hold it. You are beautiful. I guess you probably blame me. Why... What did I ever do to you? I love you. I love you! I want to have you near me. Teacher - What are you doing, Yuki? Quiet. No. No. You are mine. I'll never let anyone have you. Morita, what are you doing? You are ugly and stupid. A special mixture. Spring water and aphrodisiac. You will become drunk with lust. You body... your pussy... will crave for a penis. Today we've prepared a very complicated but tasty event. Morita, do whatever you want. Whatever? You're a dog! Please. Please. What are you asking for? Please. Do you want him? Very good, then ask this man - If you don't want him... then why are you salvating so much? Please. You have become a true whore ...naked and vulnerable. Once you experience this feeling you can never be proud again. You become a female pig who will do anything for dirty lust. Do it. Now your first step to your new future. Today, let's have a memorable time. Teacher. Are you leaving now? Now everything has finished. Goodbye teacher. I'm back. I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
