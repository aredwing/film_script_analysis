 

                        How about this one, Mom? It's nice, but we need to keep it under 9 feet. Twelve-footer, ma'am. You won't find a prettier tree than that. Thanks, but our ceilings aren't that high. There's another one over here. How do we get the tree on top of the car? I don't know. Mom, I think we should call Dad. - Hi, Clare. - Why? To come put the tree on top of the car. No, Jess, we can do it. We can't reach. It's heavy, Mom. No, I'm listening. Stop talking about him. It makes her feel bad. I know we decided on a matte finish for the master bath. I thought you were in Tahiti. I didn't go. Henry had a meeting in China. How fast can you get here? You are so good to come, Jackie... ...but the painters took off. And I have this tasting... - Hi, kids. - Hi. ...with the caterer for Henry's Christmas party. I'm so sorry. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. We just drove a half an hour to get here. I know, sweetie. You should fire her. I can't fire her. She's my client. So, fire her anyway. No. She's my boss. It doesn't work that way. Come on, honey. Come on, Mom. Careful! - Mom... - Yeah, I'm fine. Take this, Will. Okay. Okay. This way. Okay. So, I'm gonna put this together. ...and then we'll put the Christmas tree through here. You guys will lift it up and hold it. ...and I will tighten the screws. Well, Daddy has a very smart one. Yeah, Dad has the new no-tip, no-tilt, tap-a-toe stand. Well, we have this perfectly lovely little Christmas tree stand. ...that's been around since before you were born. It's very old. Well, we don't trade it in. ...just because there's something new out there. So, we are gonna honor this Christmas tree stand. Even if it is old. There. Can we put the lights on? Yeah. You know, let's take a break and eat. No, not yet. Melinda lets us eat when we want. Well, that's because Melinda is Daddy's girlfriend and not your mother... ...and it's not her job to tell you when to eat. It's mine. So let's eat. I just think that when you're dealing with a print fabric... ...it's always best to coordinate from the background color. And keep the accents the same throughout? The magnolia white? Or Barcelona white, which is warmer. And one last thing I meant to ask you. This Christmas party, Jackie, we'd love to have you. I know it's your first Christmas since the divorce. Well, thank you. That's so sweet... ...but I'm spending Christmas Eve with my kids. But thanks for thinking of me. I know how the holidays can be. Yeah. I appreciate it. See you in the morning. Okay. That looks so good. Okay, we've got 10 minutes. Will, would you get the music? - Can I DJ? - Yes, you can. - Yes. - And Jess... - Okay, put these two in the dining room. - Okay. - And that on the bar. That'd be great. - Okay. - Hi, Daddy. - Hey, Jess. Merry Christmas! Hi, Melinda. Merry Christmas. Hi. Thought we would save some time in the morning. ...by delivering the presents tonight. Dan, my Christmas party's about to start. It is? Hi, Melinda. Hi, Jackie. Could you just put those presents under the Christmas tree? That'd be great. Okay. I see you got Will a snowboard. Yeah. I wanted him to have it for the trip. I thought we said no big gifts. We agreed. It's not a competition, Jackie. Can I turn this off? Yeah, you know what? I'm running late. Don't let the kids stay up too late tonight. I need them by 9:00. Flight's at noon. Jackie, this one's for you. Daniel said it's your birthday this week. It is. Thank you. Turning the big 4-0. Wow. It's designer sweats. Juicy Couture. I know how you totally live in your sweatshirt. So I thought maybe you'd like a new one. A fancier one? It's really comfy. Well, that's so thoughtful of you. Can I open this later? - Okay. Sure. - Yeah, sure. Okay. Well, merry Christmas. - Hey! - No, I'm listening. So, they're just standing there, waiting for me to open this gift. What a jerk. Hey, Will, don't forget next week. Your mom's birthday. I know. What a jerk. - You think it's jerky? - Absolutely. To come here unannounced with Melinda on Christmas Eve? Jackie, you're way too forgiving. I totally would've chewed his head off. Yeah, but do you think I totally live in this sweatshirt? You have been in it a lot lately... ...and I think I was with you when you bought it 20 years ago. Give me a break. I didn't have time to change. But do you... Do you agree with Melinda? Well, who cares? Clearly, you're in that "don't pay attention to me. "'cause I'm broken and healing... "and I'm closed for shop and mentally not interested in sex" phase. Trust me, you'll get over it. What are you talking about? Daniel's girlfriend. Oh, my God, I meant to tell you. I saw her at the supermarket last week. She's, like, 16. Nice, Annie, not helpful. What? I'm sorry, but it's true. Jackie's prettier, of course, and smarter. What was Daniel thinking? He's thinking she looks like she's 16. Is Melinda the one-night stand or the other one? Oh, no, no, no. She's the girlfriend. Six months, and she's not 16. She's 28. Does anybody want more champagne? No, thank you. I'm driving. No, we're having wine with dinner. Speaking of which, we gotta get going. You ready to roll? No, wait. Where are you going? Well, we have reservations at 8:00. Well, I made all of this food for... You're not leaving, right? Crap, I'm sorry, sweetie. Are you okay? You know what? Never mind. Brian and I will stay. - We can stay, too. - No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. You know what? I just didn't want my party to end. - It's okay. You guys go. - We understand. Just go. Have a good time. Sweetie, are you sure? You okay? You're doing great. - We'll make it up to you. - Okay. - Mischa! - Thank you. You know, we gotta get to the grandparents... ...but we'll be back for the leftovers. Hi, sweetie. Time to go. - Okay. - Okay. Yay, yay. Mom, I'll help. Oh, no, no. You need your sleep. It's an early morning tomorrow. Your birthday's coming up. December 30th? Yeah. Yeah. Thirtieth. Maybe we shouldn't go skiing. Why not? Maybe we should be here. For my birthday? Yeah. I mean, you shouldn't be alone... ...like, all by yourself on your birthday. I'm not gonna be alone. I'll be with my girlfriends. You don't have to worry about that. But shouldn't we have a party? You know what? We'll have cake when you get back. But you're gonna have some fun on the day, right? Yes. I am gonna have so much fun. ...that I'm gonna track you down, call you... ...and make you sing Happy Birthday to me. - Promise? - Promise. Go to bed. - Night, Mom. - Good night. - Love you. - Love you, too. This chocolate Santa was in your stocking. But you're not really eating sweets, right? No, you can have it. Just don't eat it for breakfast. - Yeah. I love you. - I love you. I love you. I love you. - Bye, Mom. - I love you, Mom. I love you, too. Have fun. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Hey, when are your kids back? The day before New Year's. I thought you guys were two-weeks on, two-weeks off? Yeah, usually we are. It's just, you know, the holidays. Why? Happy birthday. I'm taking you to Hawaii for your birthday. What? A quickie, three days, three nights... ...at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. We'll get tans and massages and drink pretty drinks poolside. - Kristine! - What? You're my best friend. You're turning 40, and so am I soon... ...and we absolutely deserve this. Thank you. I don't know if it can work, Jackie. We got a party that night. Well, can you hire a sitter? Think I'll find somebody on New Year's Eve? Dad totally sucks at board sports! Well, thank you, Will. Dad bailed seven times! Thank you. May I have my phone back, please? Listen, I'm gonna have to ask Melinda. What, wait. My first vacation in three years. ...is being held hostage by a 28-year-old? She's gonna be 29 in March. She's that old? All right, Jackie. I'll see what I can do. No, just let me know as soon as you can. - Jackie! Jackie. - Hey. My grandmother fell and broke her hip. Oh, my... Is she gonna be okay? I hope so. I've gotta go to the hospital. ...and speak with the doctors. There's no one else to do it. She sounds really scared. God. Okay, let's go. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna drive you. No, you're not. You're getting on this flight. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. No, I am not. - Jackie! - Kristine, I am not. Jackie, stop acting like a five-year-old. - But... - Everything is paid for. This is... This is your birthday present. What am I gonna do alone? Same thing we would do together. Get tanned, get massaged, sleep in. Besides, if you don't go, I'll feel really horrible. I know. You know, you're right. I have to go. I promised Will. You promised Will what? I promised him that I would do something fun on my birthday. So I told him I was going. And he was very excited. Great. Wonderful. Go for Will, then. You martyr. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Have fun. Okay. I'm gonna have fun. - Okay. You have fun. Yes. - Love to your grandma. Get on the plane. - Thank you! - Of course. Call me when you settle in. Give me all the details, so I can be jealous. Our friends hate that we got divorced. You know. But, I mean, me and Daniel, we had our differences. And not to mention that he was cheating. But my point is, is that I've never been on vacation by myself. Ever. Thank you. You get what I'm saying? Yes. I think I get it. Is that it? Yeah. My only point was is that I'm almost 40... ...and I feel like I'm my daughter starting school, you know? "Will it be fun? Will I make friends?" Have you ever felt that way? No. I like to travel alone. Right. You're working. I see that. I have a book. So I'll read my book. Quiet. Aloha, welcome to the Royal Hawaiian. Thank you. Aloha, Ms. Laurens. Ma'am, let me get you a lounge chair. Thank you. Ma'am. I didn't order a drink. This is from the gentleman across the pool. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Hi, I'm Michael. Hi, Michael. I sent the drink over. Yeah, thanks. So, you're on vacation? Yeah, yeah. Just got here. Yeah, we've... We've been here since before Christmas. Kind of a worklplay, sort of hybrid trip. Conventions and all that stuff. We're orthodontists. Okay. Did you have any work done on your teeth? They're perfect. Not since I was 12. That was what, last year? So, I don't think I caught your name. I don't think I threw it. Great. You're not one of those ladies. who's gonna go around giving guys a hard time? 'Cause I gotta tell you, I'm not getting off this chair. ...until you agree to have dinner with me. Excuse me, miss. I believe you signed up for a surf lesson today... ...and it looks like you're running late. So, I'll grab your bag and towel, but... If you want to come with me to the beach right now... Yeah. Surf lesson. That's why I came to Hawaii. To learn how to surf. Yeah, and I'm sorry I kept you. - Yeah. No worries at all. - Okay. Sorry, Michael. Nice to meet you. Thank you for saving me. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you, too. So, how about a lesson? - For real? - Why not? Why? You can't teach an old dog new tricks. What dog? And who's old? Well, thanks, but I... No. Okay. Well, if you change your mind, I'm around. By the way, the name's Kyle. Kyle. I'm Jackie. Thanks again for rescuing me. It was my pleasure. Shoot! What's happening? - Hi. Are you here for a lesson? - Yes. Let me take your name and room number. - Yeah, it's Jackie, Room 276. - Jackie. Jackie, 276. Do you have an instructor in mind? - No. - No? Good, I'll sign you up with Karen. Wait. You know what? There's someone I met. Kyle. Kyle's booked. Can I give you a call if someone cancels? No, no. Oh, no. That won't be necessary. - It's no bother. Really. - No. No bother. I'm good. "Old dog"? You actually said that? Well, he made me so nervous. Yeah, but that was your excuse? That you're 40 and you can't try something new? Well, it does sound stupid hearing it back. It is stupid. Okay. Hey, how is your grandmother? Scared. And hates hospitals. I'm really glad I stayed. I'm sorry. How's the room? The room is gorgeous, Kristine. Thank you so much. Jackie? Kris, can I call you back? Sure. Hi. - You were looking for me? - No. Really? 'Cause Tommy said you came by for a lesson. Yeah, that. Well, you convinced me. And you know, you're all booked. Actually, I have a cancellation tomorrow at 5:00. So, last session of the day? No, no. That's okay. I'm good. You know, surf wisdom says that you've gotta swim out. ...of your comfort zone to catch the wave that's gonna change your life. Surfing's going to change my life? See you tomorrow at 5:00. Great. Now, just keep your knees bent. ...and your head in the center of the board. Just like you're dancing. All right. It tips, remember? Yeah. You know, can't we go out when it's a little less wavy? No, no. See, we actually want waves. We're looking for that. Waves... Waves are good. That good? Remember to keep your head in the center of the board, and relax. Here we go. Watch your step. Scootch down on your board. - Little more. - More? - Little more. - More? - A little more. - More? You're good. Paddle. I want you to get to your knees, relax and paddle. All right, let's find you a good wave. One, two, three, go! Paddle. There you go. Paddle! Good job! Up on your knees, Jackie. Your knees. Nice. Your feet. Almost. What happened? I lost my balance. Right. 'Cause you didn't keep your head in the center of the board like I told you. Next time do as you're told. Come on. Paddle. Up on your feet, Jackie! Up! Yeah! Go! Go! All right, you're getting up next time. I guarantee it. What makes you say that? 'Cause there are guys who are 78 years old out here... ...doing this every day. Plus, you're a natural. Now, stop stalling already and get back on the board. Come on, up and at 'em. Let's go. How much have I taught you? What did we practice on the beach? Get on here. Up and at 'em. And start paddling. Let's go. - Paddling? - Paddling. - Me? - Yes. That's what you're for. I'm doing it. Go, Jackie! Are you watching? That was great! Awesome! How about a drink? On me. Yeah. Cool. So, what brings you to Hawaii? Vacation or work? Vacation. Actually, this was a gift from a friend of mine... ...but she couldn't come because her grandmother fell. It's for my birthday. My 40th. Nice. When's your birthday? Tomorrow. Or tonight in a few hours. Well, happy birthday. Thanks. - So, you're from Malibu? - Yeah. Why did you move to Hawaii? - The long version or the short? - I have time. Okay. Well, for starters, my dad is an avid sailor, right? So, when I was 12 years old... ...he competed in this race called the Transpacific. It goes from LA to Hawaii. And they brought me along. So, after we... Closer to the end of the race... - Hi, here you are. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Here you go. Yeah? It's 12 long days at sea. We're at the end of this race here. And we're sailing through the Molokai Channel... ...and there's just an incredible sunrise. And we go on, we see Diamond Head. It's amazing. We keep going. We just come up... we see rows and rows of surfers just hitting the curl at dawn. And as cheesy as this may sound... ...it was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in my life. So I said to myself that I had to live here someday. And now I do. Wow. It's a good story. It's definitely beautiful here. - What? - No. Nothing. No, what? You are really beautiful. Thank you. I remember that compliment long ago. You know, Kyle... When I asked you for a drink, I wasn't hitting on you. I mean, I haven't been with anyone but my husband since I was 26. You know, so this was a drink. That's it. Yeah. Get a room, will you? - Do you have a room? - Well, actually, I do. What's wrong? It feels like it's the first time. Because it is. With me. Did you have fun? I did. Thank you. It was my pleasure. Thank you. I gotta run. So, the door slams and he's gone. ...and I... I end up blubbering like a baby till 3:00 in the morning. And that's how I rang in my 40th. But, I mean, that's not the point. My point is, is that, as a grown-up... ...aren't I supposed to be able to handle. ...these ridiculously stupid decisions that I make... ...and not end up in a ball all wet and snotty all night? Okay. So, it's a sign of maturity to have zero feelings? Well, thank God my coffee's here. Hang on. - Hi. - Good morning. I'll call you back. Call me back. What are you doing here? I decided I would take the day off to help you celebrate your birthday. Well, I... I already ordered breakfast. Great. I'm starving. I had no idea fish could be so beautiful. - Gorgeous, huh? - Amazing. Buddy. He got stung by a jellyfish. I don't speak English very well. Hey, could you grab the bottle of vinegar from my bag, please? You're gonna be okay. Thank you very much. I know it stings. You're okay. Here you go, buddy. Will, that's so sweet of you to call. Happy birthday, Mom. Thanks, hun. Is Jessica there? It's Mom. Happy birthday! Hey, Jess! Are you having fun in Hawaii? Yes. I saw the most beautiful fish. And we saw a turtle, too. No way! A big one? You wouldn't believe how... Mom, I have to go because we're having hot chocolate. ...and Melinda's back. Okay. I wish you were here, but we got you a present. Well, I can't wait. I love you, honey. Love you. Happy birthday. Thank you. Bye-bye. Lunch. You were really good with that boy today. Thanks. I've seen that injury a few times. All right, so, I got my three favorite things... Mahi tacos with pineapple relish, Portuguese rolls with guava jelly. Amazing. And Kona coffee to wash it all down. I'm sorry. But I'm not that hungry. That's funny how you keep saying that, but I just don't believe it. Eat. There you go, see, got a mouthful. It's good. It's really good. - Really? - Really good. Okay, now try a bite of this Portuguese roll. Who's a big girl? Come on. Wow! Why does everything taste better outdoors? It does, right? - I think I'll have another bite. - Dig in. So, where'd you learn to speak French? I spent a year surfing in France. You? I took it in high school. Then, I went to the Sorbonne in Paris for grad school in design. You're ringing. It's a client. I have to take this. What do you mean you have to take it? It's your birthday. - Blow them off. - Yeah, I wish I could, but I can't. Wait, what? Why can't you? She's one of my biggest clients. Okay, well, then tell her you lost your phone in a waterfall. - What waterfall? - Waihi. Waihi? It's absolutely beautiful. I'm not gonna let you miss it. Unlike this call, which you just did. Come on, kook. Did you call me kook? Watch your step. Wow. It's beautiful. Check it out. This is it. Wow. It's really lovely. Yeah. All 800 square feet of it. No, it is. I mean, I like it. Takes a lot of thought to make a home clean and simple. Yeah. It's a choice. It is. You know, with space and light. I'm always telling my clients they need to get rid of the clutter. You know, let in the light. Exactly. You know, I think I'm gonna jump in the shower real quick. Why don't you? Speaking of clutter, do you make drugs? No. What is all this? This is all-natural, non-petroleum, non-toxic surf wax. - I make it from scratch. - Surf wax. You ever heard of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch? - No. What is it? - It's between California and Hawaii. And it's just essentially a gigantic heap of trash. ...caught in the vortex of all these currents, right? But the thing is massive. It's like the size of Texas. Sounds horrible. So, my stuff is biodegradable. That way it doesn't add to the mess. It's kind of like my way of, you know, chipping in. Check this out. It's a guy from LA, Michael Larkin. He wants to market it. He made me an offer up front. In fact, he still calls me every other day about it. Well, have you called him back? - No. - Why not? 'Cause I'm an amateur in life and I prefer to keep it that way. So, what are you saying? You don't like professionals? No, I'm saying that not everything needs to be exploited. I'm gonna take a shower. Yes, this is Kyle Hamilton's assistant, calling for Mr. Larkin. Yeah, can you tell him. ...that Mr. Hamilton would like to schedule a meeting. ...the next time he's in Hawaii? Thank you. What did you just do? Do you want me to do it for real? That was fake? It's 10:00 in LA. Because, you know, you have to swim out of your comfort zone. ...to catch the wave of your life. Or something like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's... That's it. So, what you're saying is that I should just get over it someday? Someday. So, nothing too dressy, right? Right. I don't get to watch you change? No. Why not? Because all of the lights are on, and I've had two children. I mean, not that I'm complaining. As you shouldn't because you happen to look beautiful. Thank you. Hey, how about this? That looks great. Thank you. How old are you? Does it matter? Am I breaking the law? Twenty-seven. I'm definitely not dressing in front of you. - Hey, you know what you need? - What do I need? A bikini. That's exactly what I don't need. Get over it. Someday. Maybe. Well, what went wrong? I don't know. We both met when we were 24 in Paris. And two years later, he proposed. We got the first house, had the first child. Then the second. And then I realized I wasn't seeing him anymore. He was working. I was working. But when we would go home... we'd spend more time with the kids than each other. And then? And then... My birthday cake came. Yeah, well, make a wish. Aloha, welcome to Honolulu International Airport. Passengers arriving for Flight ...please proceed to baggage area... Well, Kyle. Well, Jackie. It's really nice to meet you. Come here. I... I got you a little something. Just a token to remember your stay. Thank you. It's nice to meet you. - You already said that. - Right. Take care. - Okay. Have a safe flight. - Okay. Happy new year. Happy new year. - Nine, eight, seven, six... - Nine, eight, seven, six... ...five, four, three, two, one. ... Five, four, three, two, one. Happy new year! Will, I so know what you feel like on your board. I mean, I felt like a bird. Like I was flying. That's epic sick, Mom! You got up, brah? Yeah, brah. This is awesome. Look at me. I'm sick, too. You're so sick! Can I wear this to school? Yeah. With a long-sleeved shirt, so you don't freeze to death. Mom, we got you stuff. It's your birthday. - It's from both of us. - I drew the card. - Do I have to read it? - Mommy! I'm sorry. Okay. "To Mom. Happy Birthday, Mom. "Love, Jessica and William. " Beautiful. Thank you. So sweet. I love it. Wow! It's beautiful. That's an aspen leaf. It's for your keys. I love it. Thank you. That's so sweet of you guys. You know what? I missed you so much. Give me hugs. Come here. - We missed you, too, Mom. - We missed you, too, Mom. We're in the perfect position for tickle torture! It was fun. What more do you want? Details. Look at her, she's beaming! Is this about the one-night stand? You had a one-night stand? Yes. And one night turned into two. when he showed up at her room the next morning. - No way. - Start with his name. His name, Kyle Hamilton. - How old is he? - Twenty-seven. Twenty-seven? Twenty-seven and a surf instructor. My goodness! And you had sex with him? Two days and two nights of just amazing... It was amazing? You know, and I owe it all to Kristine. How does one go about paying you back? Well, I'm just glad to see you happy. You know, like my grandmama always said... "The only way to get over a man is to get under another. " Your grandmother said that? Yes, she did. - Happy birthday, Jackie. - Thank you. You're moving on. To moving on. - To moving on. - To moving on. When I was rushing to pack, I forgot my charger... ...and then I got there and my phone was dead. Couldn't you use the hotel phone? Excuse me. It's Jessica's school. Hello? What are you wearing? Jeans and a shirt. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Very busy. Sounds like you need a vacation. I think you should come back to Hawaii. I get vacations every five years. Come on, Jackie. That's no way to live. Probably not. But I'm with a client. Can I call you back? Yeah. Hey, but think about it. I'd really like to see you again. I'll call you back. It was a fling. Yeah. That's what I thought until he called. So, was it a fling? He's a kid, come on. He's young. I mean, maybe if he weren't in his 20s. Excuse me? Have you not heard of the Moore Phenomenon? Demi? Julianne Moore? They're both married to guys that are 10 years younger than them. And Katie Couric? She's in her Katie Couric's boyfriend is a banker, not a surfer. Yes. But Kyle is a surf instructor. A surf instructor who speaks French. - Did I tell you he speaks French? - You mentioned it. What if he's a psycho? What if he's stalking you? What if he's a psycho who stalks lonely, more mature women? Come on, 40 is not that mature. And she's not lonely. Well, I'm a little lonely. No, but you're not, you know, desperate, are you? No, maybe Nicole's right. I mean, maybe he just hits on a different tourist every week. Yeah, and chops them up into little pieces and puts them in his freezer. He was sweet. And he was very tender in a way. Tender, as in the way he cooks you, and then we never see you again. Yeah, exactly. Okay, you guys, give it up. Give it up. Maybe this guy is the love of Jackie's life. There's my baby! Hi, girls. So, you're taking the kids for break? Are you planning a trip? Not yet. Well, I am. So I thought I'd run this by you. You going to Hawaii to see your boy toy? Annie told Phil. Phil told me. God, Jackie. That's really beneath you. Actually, I was thinking of seeing my mom in Connecticut. It's my two weeks, so it's really none of your business where I go. Whatever, dude. Surf's up. Why do you even talk to him? - Who? - Dad. - What do you mean? - He always makes you upset. I saw you. Sweetheart, I'm sorry. You know, sometimes your dad and I have disagreements... ...and we have to compromise. I'm sorry you saw me grumpy. You were happy when you got back from your trip. Now you're sad again. I'm not sad. Really, I'm not. I like it better when you're happy. Hey, you've reached Kyle Hamilton. Leave it here. Hi, Kyle. It's Jackie Laurens. I was just thinking about what you said. ...and wondered if you were still interested in, you know, getting together again. So, there. Okay. Call me if you want. Bye. For your safety, please do not leave baggage. ...or personal belongings unattended. For your safety, please do not leave baggage. ...or personal belongings unattended. He's not even here. What am I doing? That's what I'm doing. Not bad. You're looking great. Thanks. Did I tell you Will's into snowboarding? He's crazy about it. He's obsessed with this Gretchen Bleiler girl. Yeah. She... She won the gold at the X Games, right? I don't know about the X Games, but blonde, cute, 17. So Will's into the older women, too? - Yeah. I guess so. - Smart kid. How about Jess? Jessica's more of the brain. And she's really smart, stubborn when she wants to be. I really miss them. I bet you do. No, but they would love it here. Will would love to learn how to surf. Why don't you bring them out next time? It's hot in downtown Denver this Fourth of July weekend. with temperatures reaching into the 90s. Stay out of the sun, please, girls. I can't wait till summer's over, and they're back in school. Nicole, you gotta see these photos from Jackie. - Did she e-mail you? - No. Well, apparently this guy's some kind of amateur photographer... She's gone, like, four times in the last six months. Wow. She's surfing. She looks like she's good at it, too. It's a six-hour flight. Half a day there, half a day back. This is a colossal waste of time, don't you think? I don't know. I've never been. Nicole, she's having a midlife crisis. But instead of dyeing her hair and taking yoga... ...she's flying halfway to Japan once a month. This is serious. Wow! Is that the guy? He's hot. I guess. No, he is. He's hot. My goodness. Look at those shoulders. Look at his pecs. Okay, okay. We have to talk some sense into her. You're probably right. Go back one. Hey, I wanna ask you something. Shoot. Well, actually, I've been meaning to ask you for a while, but... Back in Denver... You're not dating a bunch of mountain men, are you? 'Cause I just have this image of these guys in flannel shirts. with grizzly beards, and... No. Okay, good, 'cause I just... I don't like the idea of that. What are you saying? What am I saying? I guess I'm saying that. I really like you. And I want you to be my girl. You like me, and you want me to be your girl. Yeah. - And not date anyone else? - No. What about you? I'm gonna date whoever I want. No, but seriously. How about it? I'd love to be your girl. Wow, you look amazing. Thank you. I feel good. The gang's all here. Hey, you guys. Hi. How was your trip? It was fine. What's going on? You've been to Hawaii four times since Christmas. Do you know that? Yes, I do. What's the big deal? If it's not a big deal, why are you keeping it such a secret? You know. I'm not. It's just that I'm not kissing and telling all the time. How are you ever gonna get used to being single. ...if you keep running off to Hawaii? I'm not single. I have a boyfriend. He's your boyfriend now? Well, what about back here? There's lots of guys we could set you up with. You guys have never set me up, not once this whole year. We will now. Nicole's right. You belong here. Well, I like Hawaii and I like Kyle. So why don't I belong there? What you like is having sex in Hawaii. That is what you like. You know, Annie, you don't know the full story. He's 13 years younger than you. I mean, how can this possibly be going anywhere? Well, I'm sorry you can't wrap your head around it... ...but it's been going somewhere for seven months. Okay, everybody. Maybe Jackie is right and she knows what she's doing. Besides, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. ...if he were 40 and Jackie were the one that's 27. No, we shouldn't be having this conversation anyway. ...because it's really no one's business but mine. We're your friends. Your happiness is our business. And exactly what part of me doesn't seem happy? Because I've never been happier. It just seems scary, that's all. We don't want you to get hurt. And you have to think about your kids. Okay, all right, hold it right there. I consider my children in every decision I make. Jackie. Jackie, don't leave. No, you know what? I don't wanna say anything that I might regret. My children are happy when I'm happy. We just think you deserve better. Based on what? 'Cause you haven't even met Kyle. Or maybe it's about something else. Like, gee, suddenly my life as a single woman. ...seems fun instead of depressing or humiliating. And maybe my dangerous little vacations. ...are better than being in an office day and night. Jackie. That went well. Are you watching the sunset? It's about to dip under. Describe it, please. What are you looking at in the bathtub? Describe that in full detail. Hold on. Hi, Clare. I'm torn whether to go with Roman shades or pleated in the den. Roman shades in the den or pleated? Can... Can we go over this tomorrow? Henry's leaving early. Can you come now? Okay. I'll see you soon. Thank you. Sorry, Kyle. That was a client. I have to go meet her. So late on a Sunday night? Yeah. Her husband's leaving tomorrow. So she wants me to meet him. Henry and I have decided to build a second home in Jackson. - Hi, Jackie. - Here are the plans. - Hi, Henry. - Three-car garage and spa. Excuse me, ladies. We would like you to get a head start. ...and work with the architect. Oh, no. It's a dream job. One that can land me in magazines. - Well, congratulations. - Thank you. It's just the thought of working for this woman another year... Do you have to? Well, I mean, it's too amazing. But I have to figure out what to do with the kids. You know, they're starting school. All right, well, get a babysitter. Daniel won't let me. He doesn't trust strangers. Daniel won't let you? Well... Babe, why do you need Daniel's permission? You're right. I don't. Will, Jess, this is Lisa. - Hi. - Hey. She's gonna be helping us out for the rest of the summer. You know, driving carpool to camp, stuff like that. Why don't you show her your room? - Sure. - Sweet. Thanks. Mom? Yeah? - I have this girlfriend, Stephanie... - I didn't know you had a girlfriend. I do. I met her at the Fourth of July. And yesterday, when I came second in the swim meet... ...she said I didn't win 'cause I'm too small. She said I would swim faster if I wasn't so little. First of all, Will, you're exactly the size you're supposed to be. And everyone grows at different rates. You know, so no one can say who's too big and who's too small. And judging by your father... ...you're gonna be towering over all of us very soon. Yeah? And if Stephanie doesn't understand that, and doesn't appreciate you for you... ...and exactly who you are, then that's her loss. - Where'd you get this shirt? - Melinda got it for me. - It's cool. - Thanks. Hey, also, if Stephanie's your girlfriend... ...she shouldn't be saying mean things to you. She should be saying nice things. Supportive things. - I love you, Will. - I know. Come on, honey. I'm only gonna be gone for five days. - Jessica, you are being very rude. - No, I'm not. Yeah, you're acting like a three-year-old. Then go and leave me alone. I would like to say goodbye. A proper goodbye. You know, I don't... I don't know what you're so mad about. I thought you liked being here with Daddy and Melinda. I told you I don't. Well, we have an agreement. Go then. This is because you're going to Hawaii. - Shut up, Dad! - Will. She's our mom. You're not supposed to be mean to her. You're supposed to be supportive. Will! He's right, Daniel. I have something for you. - Really? - Yeah. For you. To inspire you. Thank you. "Small Business for Dummies. " That's sweet of you, babe. Are you calling me a dummy? No, no. I read that book before I went into business. Cover to cover. Let me ask you something. Would it be easier for you if I were a CEO instead of a surf instructor? Kyle, I'm not trying to change you. I'm trying to inspire you. Yeah, but you already do inspire me. And I really like you. No. I love you, Jackie. Do you think it's weird that neither one of us. ...have met each other's friends yet? Maybe a little. What do you think we're waiting for? What are you waiting for? Honestly? A part of me, I think, is waiting for you to turn 30. Are you embarrassed by my age? Are you? I mean, you could be dating girls 20 years younger than me. We're different generations. Am I too old for you? No, sometimes I actually think I'm too old for you. I'm happy to introduce you to my friends. I have no issue about it. Why would I? You're beautiful. I'm proud to call you my girlfriend. Now, women in their 20s... Well... What about my friends? That's a bit of a bigger problem. I just... I don't make it to the mainland that much. Ever? Once a year, tops. I mean, I don't know. Can I visit the mainland? Can I live on the mainland? Honestly? Yeah, honestly. I don't like to leave the rock. You think it's selfish, me not coming to see you in Denver? - Not yet. - No? Ask me again in a few months. You know, I don't know. All the hustle on the mainland just seems insane to me. I mean, you got this one life and you're spending it sitting in rush hour. ...or working under fluorescent lights. ...in a climate-controlled room, hunched over a computer... ...sucking back caffeine. And for what? You don't have to live like that. I know, but every time I go to the mainland... I'm afraid I'm gonna get sucked back into it. Well, you do live a more simple life than most people. I think simple's underrated. I'm being an idiot, right? Being a stubborn jerk? - Honestly? - Yeah, honestly. I think you're acting your age. I'll get us another beer. - You hanging out with Kyle? - Yeah. I'm Andrew Barry. Can I get you a drink? No, no, no. Kyle's... My son has that shirt. - This? - Yeah. Yeah, this is me. I'm a pro surfer. How old is your son? - Eleven. - Eleven. I've got some autographed T-shirts in my bag. Wow. Here's a nice one. Shame on you, Drew. You hitting on my girl? If that's okay? No, not unless you enjoy eating through a straw. - Thank you. - Take care. And if this doesn't work out... Yeah, yeah, beat it. Go peddle your shirts elsewhere. How old is he? Twenty-one, and very much into you. I could be arrested. Hey, look, I got this for Will. It's signed. Wow. What? It's your phone. Seven messages. All from Daniel. - What? - Something's happened. Hey, it's me. Where you been? I've been calling you for hours. I didn't have my phone. What is the point of having a cell... Daniel, what's going on? There's been an accident. Your babysitter was driving. - Will's fine. Jess is in surgery now. - Surgery? A broken arm. - Is it really bad? - No, she's gonna be fine. - What happened? - Some drunk ran a stop sign. Okay, you know what? I'II... I'll be out on the first flight. Well, she has been asking for you. Well, just tell her I love her. I'll be there as soon as I can. Okay? - Yeah. - Is Will there? No, he went home with Melinda. Look, it's after midnight. I wouldn't call now. He's probably sleeping. Okay. Okay. I'll call you back when I know about my flight. I don't care how many times I have to switch planes. Right now, I'm on a red-eye from Honolulu to San Francisco. Now, I just need San Francisco to Denver. Okay. Bye. They've got me on hold. They're working on it. Okay. I won't even call and bother you. Just let me know how she is when you come up for air. Thank you. You know what? I'll feel much better when I get home. Yeah. And I'll send you all your stuff. Take care, okay? ...is now scheduled to depart at 10:25. Dr. Ann Lynn, dial extension 2567. Extension 2567. Hey. I thought you were gonna catch the first flight out. I did. - It's almost noon. - No kidding. - What are you wearing? - It was the only top I had. Is that his? What is he, 12? I got this for Will. You know, feel free to leave. I can sit with Jess. Will is on his way. Melinda is picking him up from the swim meet. - No, I asked Lisa to pick him up. - Well, she's not. I fired her. - Yeah, she told me, and I rehired her. - I don't want her working for us. Daniel, it was an accident. And I have custody, so I get to make the decisions, not you. - Maybe you shouldn't have custody. - Be careful. You're an absent mother. You're off in Hawaii. So you on the road two weeks out of a month. ...doesn't make you an absent father? - That's me making a living. - That's you sleeping around in New York. Are we really gonna get into this here? Don't speak to my babysitter. She's my babysitter! Mr. And Mrs. Laurens? I'm Dr. Sonnet, I'm Jessica's surgeon. - Do you and your wife have a moment? - Ex-wife. Well, Jessica's doing great. But we'd like to keep her. ...for a couple of nights just for observation if that's okay. Fine. As long as she's doing great. - He's not always that charming. - Don't worry about it. - Thanks, Dr. Sonnet. - Okay. - Jessica. - Mommy! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Are you okay? Yeah, stop, Mommy. I feel better. I'm so glad. I'm so sorry I wasn't here. I know. I know. It's okay. Yeah. Well, when Daddy called, I went to the airport right away. Everyone sent me flowers. Everyone knows. Well, everyone was very concerned about you, I'm sure. Yeah. Oh, my gosh, look at your cast. You know what? We're going to have to get magic markers. ...and have people sign it. - Yeah, it's still a little sore. - Yeah. Well, when it feels better. Is there anything I can get you? - Can I please have my pillow from home? - Yes. And the food's pretty weird. There is a lot of JELL-O. Oh, my gosh, I'm so glad you're okay. It was scary. I bet it was. Look at all your balloons. Yeah, they're from Dad and Melinda. Jessica? Jessica, my friend in Hawaii sent you a gift. There. All the hula girls wear these. They're orchids. - They are? - Yeah. - You want me to read the card? - Sure. "To Jess from Kyle. " - "Dear Jessica... " - Mom? I'm sort of worried you're settling. Settling? Where'd you hear that? Maybe your boyfriend's not the best boyfriend for you. Maybe you're better than him. Oh, no, honey. That's not true. Kyle's a wonderful person, which is why he got you this lovely gift. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. He was so worried about you. And he felt bad that I was with him instead of here. when your accident happened. Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere, okay? - You're not? - I'm not. - Why? - I want to be here. So, you're not going back to Hawaii anymore? No. Good. I can't keep leaving my real life for a fantasy life. Fantasy life? That's what it feels like. - See you tomorrow. - Thanks, bud. Look, Jackie, you don't have to call it a fantasy life to end things. But don't pretend like what we had wasn't real. I'm not. I... I'm saying it feels that way. ...because you're on the other side of the world. You know what I think? I think your daughter got hurt and it scared the hell out of you. As it should have. But now you're feeling guilty for it, so you're crawling back into your hole. - You don't have children, Kyle. - So what? I mean, all of this is much more complicated for me. Life is simpler for you. That may be true. I don't know what to say. I'm not good at goodbyes. Then don't say goodbye. Say, "I'll see you later. " I don't think I'll see you later, Kyle. Take care, Jackie. You, too. - Where are you? - Sorry. When was the last time you spoke to him? Couple months ago. August. You know, all I want to say is that. I'm sorry we ever said anything. You were happy with him, Jackie. Jetlagged, but happy. Now lately you seem so... Kristine, I'm fine. Really. I mean, you know, just like Annie said... ...kids come first, and I need to be with them. You know that Will has a girlfriend? And not a two-week girlfriend. A girlfriend since July. I know we're mothers. But that doesn't mean that we should just lie down and die. Okay? I'm not gonna martyr myself for my husband and my kids 24l7. Besides, you know what she told me? She and Phil haven't had... ...in over a year. Yeah, well, we all make sacrifices. Come on. What about Kyle? Can't he come here? You know what? That's... That was becoming an issue, too. All I'm saying is just give him a call. Touch base. Happy Halloween. You know you want to. Hello? Hi, is Kyle there, please? He is, but he's in the shower right now. Can I take a message? No, I'll call back. Hi, sorry I'm late. Is something wrong? You seem preoccupied. Preoccupied? Clare, I see you every day. I see you more than all of my other clients put together. Well, I asked you to be here at noon. Yeah, you called me at 10:00 last night to change the 4:00 meeting to 12:00. - I got here as soon as I could. - Fine. Actually, it's not fine. I don't think you realize how much I bend over backwards. ...to accommodate you. From now on you can call me at home up until 6:00. But not after and not before 8:00 in the morning. And if you want to pay me less, then that's fine. - Done? - Yes. Feel better? Yes. And then I found out they'd given partner to that infuriating little creep. - No. - What? And I yelled... At the top of my lungs, right? And everybody turned around and looked at me like these people here... ...and I said, "Excuse me, gentlemen... "that was just the sound of my head hitting the glass ceiling. " So take that shattered glass and add that to 300 times. ...my annual salary, and you'll get what it will cost. ...to retrain and recruit my replacement. - Wow. Smarty. - Yes! Gosh, you are so brave. You said that? No. But, well, you quit? Yeah? No. No, but that's what I wanted to say to those bastards. They're jerks. They're jerks. I mean, seriously. It's okay, I'm fine. I'm over it. Let us drink and be merry. Okay? Party like we agreed. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, Annie. Annie, your quarter, your quarter. My quarter. Phil's leaving me. We haven't had sex in seven months, one week and one day. He said that it's my weight. That it's irresponsible to our marriage for me. ...to have "let myself go" the way I have. What? That's bull. - Drink. - Hell, yeah. Any other crappy news, anyone? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I called Kyle. A woman answered the phone. - Said he was in the shower. So, hang up. - No. Jackie. I'm so sorry I was so hard on you. No, you were just jealous. I was. I was. That young hard body jumping your puny little bones. All that sex. All that sex! Oh, my... Chad wants to set you up with someone at Thanksgiving. - He's coming. - Who? They play golf. And he's your age with a six-figure salary. Maybe even seven. I met him once, and he's totally cute. Golf? - Here you go, Will. Silly girl. - Thank you. Okay. Hey, Amelie, give the kids some pie when they're done. And for the big table. - Are you sure we haven't met? - Yeah. No, actually we have. Okay. Where? My daughter was in an accident this summer. You were her surgeon. Jessica. - Jessica. It was a leg, right? - No. The arm. I'm sorry. It's okay. You know, I'm sure she'd be glad to see you. How is she doing? - Great. - Yeah? You know, she missed tennis lessons during the summer... ...but other than that, you did a great job. Phew. Phew is right. Well, you know what? I'm gonna check on the kids. Okay. Sure. So, how's Suzie doing? Hey. Did you hear? Daniel and Melinda broke up. Really? No, he didn't mention it. Yeah. Phil told Annie, Annie told me. How's the doctor? You're not gonna believe this. He was Jessica's surgeon this summer. You like him? Stop. For instance, if you take a procedure. ...like a laparoscopic splenectomy, for instance... which you would use for certain immunological disorders. ...like an idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, for instance... I'm sorry. Am I boring you? - No. - You sure? - No. - Great. Well, it's something you can only do on... Could I interest you in a dessert menu? Oh, no, thank you very much. I don't think we're gonna have any dessert. I really gotta watch my calories. Check, please. - Very well, sir. - Thank you. Where was I? Hey. I'm so glad you're here. I take it the date didn't go well. Oh, my gosh, he wouldn't let me order dessert or coffee. - What's that? What are you doing? - I'm making lists. Excuse me? Lists of possibilities. Lists of things that I gave up on, like Kyle. You didn't give up on Kyle. Okay. Okay. You did. Did I ever tell you I had this fantasy of going to Argentina. ...to live there for a month and learn to tango? And one day, I just thought it wasn't practical. But you know what? I'm doing it. Summer vacation. Taking the kids. - Good. - Yeah. - And may I? - Yeah. I have 59 things. Learning to cook French. "Climb Mount Rainier. " "Save the environment. " That's a big one. Yeah. But you know what? We can do something about it. We're only 40. I mean, we might have 60 more years of life. I'm not gonna spend the rest of it. ...pretending that I care about something when I don't... ...like skipping dessert. No. Not when I can be... When you could be what? Surfing. I'm open. I'm open. Over here! That's it. Attaboy! Yeah, good teamwork! I'm open. I heard you and Melinda broke up. I'm sorry. Sure you are. No, I am. I care about you. Let's not get into it. Get into what? Wait... I care about you. And you care about me. You just talk to me with such... What? Contempt. You know, I hate what you're doing to the memory of us. Acting like what we had together wasn't real, and it was real. You know, maybe it didn't last, but it was real at the time. Stick with 'em. Stick with 'em. I know it was real. You're right. When Melinda left me, she said the same thing. She said that... Said she didn't like the way I spoke to her. - She wants to have kids. - Wow. Can I do that? I'm 42. Can I be having babies now? Of course you can. You're a great father, you know. Why wouldn't you? I thought you'd freak. If she makes you happy, just try and work things out. Don't do what I did. You're not seeing your guy anymore? No. And one and two and three and four. And one and two and three and four. You know, I'm going to Hawaii for Christmas. - You are? - What? - You are? - I'm taking the kids. - Are you going to Oahu? - Yeah. Did you call Kyle? You know, I haven't yet. Maybe I will when I get there. What if he's still with someone? You know, if he's moved on, then that's fine. We'll still have a wonderful week there. And Will will get to surf, and so will I. - So, how's packing going? - Good. Jess wants to know if Santa will be able to find us in Hawaii. - What did you tell her? - I told her yes. Smart move. Here's sunblock. - Kyle called. - Kyle called? About an hour ago. Kyle Hamilton? Did he leave a message? He said not to try him. He said he'd call back. Thanks. So, the surfer closer to the break gets the right of way. And the break is the white part of the wave. - I know what the break is, Mom. - Do you, now? Merry Christmas! - Hey! - Hi. Thank you for having us. I'm keeping it simple this year. I ordered pizza. Pizza! That's perfect. It's freezing. There it is. Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no. I'm getting it. You guys are not gonna believe this. Jackie, you have guests. Hi. - Hey. - Hi. Hi. I'm... I'm taking Will and Jess to Hawaii tomorrow for Christmas. You're kidding me. No. The whole Christmas vacation. And my friends came over early to celebrate Christmas. And this is Annie. - Hey. It's a pleasure to meet you, Annie. - And you. Yeah. Jackie, this is Sabrina. I'm sorry. Hello. My sister. - Hi. - So nice to meet you. You, too. I've heard so much about you. What are you doing here? Business. There was a surf and ski expo at the Denver Center. I love this. Oh, my God, you are lit up. I've never seen you look happier. - He does that to me. - He is beautiful. - What is today? - Today? What is today, my fine fellow? Today? Why, it's Christmas Day. It's Christmas Day! Yes! Excuse me. Take a look. - What is it? - Open it. Wow! Is this yours? It's beautiful. I didn't think you were ever going to leave the rock. Well, you weren't coming back, so I had to figure something out. The surf expo was a good excuse to come find you. Well, you look so professional. - What have you been doing? - Acting my age, I guess. Me, too. You look great. I can't believe that we're going to Hawaii, and you're not gonna be there. I'll be there. Good sticks. I learned it in high school. Is that what I say? So, where did you... So, where did you... Where did you learn to take... I'm sorry. I can't do it that way. Marker. What? Take the sunglasses off. Thank you. - I said... Yeah. - What do I say? Does that hurt? - No, it doesn't hurt. - Does that? Or does that? That's sweet. That's cool. Sorry. And look like this? Hi, hi. Is it great? Does it look great? I forgot I was working with him. Sorry. Sorry. Not home. So good. Look who has their commercial on Logo Channel. - Scene. - And cut!
