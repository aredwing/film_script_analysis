The show will start in just a moment. Great! Get higher, fatso! Great! That's the Female Warrior spear-kick. She's going against eight spears at once! When I saw the famous Shao Juhong last year, he only did four! Great! I can tell Zhiqiu is going to be famous someday! That's right! Let's go! Master's here! I told you to stay home and be a lady. But you won't listen to me! No success can come to a woman in opera. You'll never find a husband! I promised Mom on her deathbed... ...that I would fulfill her dream. I must play the Female Warrior role on stage... ...and show her that I can kick eight spears. Kick?! Kick?! Go on, kick! That's enough, Ye. Bring me my knife. Kneel for an hour. Think about what you've done! Come on...she's just a child. Take it easy. She never listens to me! Zhiqiu. Why is the best moment in life always the shortest? So we will learn to appreciate it. Zhiqiu, do you have any dream? Of course I do. But I'm not telling you. You're terrible. You should've just told me. You're so terrible. My dream is to leave this tiny place, make a name for myself in Shanghai... ...with you by my side. What's your dream? I want to study opera in Beijing. If I keep learning secretly, I won't get anywhere. I must go there and find a good teacher. You'll definitely succeed. You'll be in Shanghai, and I'll be in Beijing. We won't see each other. The moment I find success, I'll come and see you in Beijing. Even if that's a lie, I'm happy to hear you say that. I'm not lying to you. Zhiqiu, I promise you. I will never lie to you. Daqi. Daqi, follow me! What's going on, Boss? My wife is having an affair. I'll catch them in the act. But this is murder. Captain Pei of the police is my sworn brother. He can settle anything. He's collecting debt in Pudong. He won't be back tonight. You dash in and tackle him from behind. I'll chop him up. Hurry! Who is it? Daqi? Cap...Captain Pei? Go to Hell! You're up? Where am I? Death row. Why am I here? Because you've killed someone. Who did I kill? The owner of the fruit stall. My boss is dead? You tried to rape his wife. Your boss returned home from drinking with Pei. You two fought, and you killed him. But Captain Pei was the adulterer! The truth doesn't matter. It's the outcome that counts. Let me out! It's useless to scream. Let me out! There's no way you're getting out. Why aren't you nervous at all? First of all, I really did kill someone. Secondly, I'm not going to die. Why? Nobody can decide whether you'd die. Only you can. Of course I don't want to die. Do as I say. I guarantee you won't die. I'll do whatever you say. Sir... Who are you exactly? I'm a soldier. Why did the police arrest you? Aren't you guys on the same side? Don't ask. It does you no good to know too much. They're here. Stand over there. Who's here? Stand over there. Sir! He's with me. I have to pay Pei a visit. Let me out. Don't kill me! You'll be in big trouble! Do you know who I am? Aren't you a gangster? I'm a soldier. The people I killed were underground rebels. You made a big mistake arresting me. Take this. I didn't know! Time to return the favor. Don't! Kill him. No...Don't kill me! He wants you dead. So, you have to kill him first! No, don't kill me! Don't! I don't want to kill anyone. Don't! Then you'll die! I'll count to three. No, don't kill me! One. Good man! How does it feel to kill someone? Not good. You'll get the hang of it after a few more. Relax. You're a real murderer now, so you can't stay here anymore. Come to Shanghai with me. Can I refuse? It's a playground for the adventurous. You'll find a lot of opportunities there. Think about it! My name is Mao Zai. I saved your life. See you in Shanghai. Daqi, Zhiqiu left with her father after you were arrested. She said they were going to Beijing. I'm off to study opera in Beijing. Come and find me. OK, stand upright. Look into the camera. One, two, three. Want to have some fun? Come on, Fatso! Come on, baby. Honey. Look. It's Shanghai's most prosperous place. The Grand Shanghai Nightclub. You'll find all the rich and famous here. One day, I will stand on that rooftop with the Grand Shanghai under my feet. I know you can do it. Mr. Hong. This is the French ambassador. He wishes you a happy birthday. Come, let's take a photo. All Pong Hand. Don't lose, OK? Mr. Hong, the president of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. A small gift for you. Hello, Mr. Cheng. Hello. Honey. Where's Master? He's playing mahjong. Husheng keeps asking why you're late. Master. I wish you a most auspicious birthday. Allow me to give you a proper greeting. We're sworn brothers. There's no need to bow. Then I wish your home be filled with gold... ...and your days be spent smiling like the Buddha. Exceen A smile like Buddha! And I wish the same for all of you! Hooray! Mr. Hong. Since it's your 60th birthday. I know that anyone with any prestige in Shanghai... ...has come to celebrate. Can this simple country boy stay... ...and witness this eye-opening occasion? I'm glad you're here, General Mao! Happy birthday! Yes, we're truly honored by your presence, General Mao. Right, Shouting? That's right. Daqi. How have you been? Very well, thanks to you. A man will come to Shanghai from Beijing. He's a scholar on the surface. But he's actually an underground rebel. Who is he? Cheng Zhaimei. I've heard of him, but I don't know him. You may not know him, but you definitely know his wife. Ye Zhiqiu. Of course, she's famous. Daqi. I work in intelligence. Ye Zhiqiu may just be a famous opera performer to us. But she's something else to you, isn't she? What do you want me to do? Her husband has a list... ...of all the rebels around the country. That's what I want. I'll see what I can do. Daqi. With your power and influence... ...surely there isn't much you can do? Our nation and party will remember... ...everything you've done for us. Great! Sis? Bao, allow me. Great! I'm heading home. I have a headache. If I'm not around... ...he'll have more fun. Let me walk you out. There's no need. Remember. Don't let the old man drink too much. I won't. Goodbye. Bao, I need go to my office. I have something urgent to attend to Are you OK? Take care of things for me here. Don't let Master know. Are you exhausted? A little. Let's go back and rest. Wait for the next one. Lin. Let them in. Where do you want to go, Boss? I want to take a walk. Sure. Fatso. Yes? Guess who I just ran into? Who? Zhiqiu. Did she recognize you? I don't know. That's great news. Your old flame's back. I'm happy for you! Zhiqiu. Zhiqiu. Do you know the man in the elevator earlier? Which one are you talking about? One of them was Cheng Daqi. The top gangster in the Bund. I don't know him. He was looking at you in such a strange way. "The Ye Zhiqiu Opera Compilation" Hello? Hello? Who is it? Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm sorry, sir. This seat is reserved for someone else. What?! Sir. Do you know who I am, you little brat? Asshole! D0993'- Daqi, Bao has saved this seat for you. Thanks, Doggy- You are welcome. Have all our men arrived? Almost. You're Cheng Daqi? Which pier are you from? Did you shut down Fan Ha's gambling stall at the temple? That's right. You cut off both of Fan's thumbs? He cheated! Why? Are you here to avenge him? Someone hired me to take his arm. After searching for two weeks, I found him already a deformed man. You took my job. You need a job? You've got one. Come fight with us. Sure. It's been weeks since I last flexed my muscles. What's your name? I'll tell you if we both make it out alive. Don't pretend to be a lady! I'll pay if you let me cop a feel. Stop it! That's enough! Go to Hell! Are you OK? Yes, thanks to you! I was talking about your bench. Pack up and leave. It's going to get messy here. OK, Daqi. Everyone's here. Don't say I never gave you a chance, Iron. Hand over your turf while you still can. Brothers! Here! Kill them all! Attack! Here! Over here! Kill him! Scar! Iron! This turf here... ...it belongs to neither of you! I'm in charge now! Who's that fat man? He's got so much power! Hong Shouting. The police captain of the French Concession. Also the criminal kingpin of Shanghai. Those who died... So, that's him... pay their family. Look at him. A few words and everything is solved. That's a natural leader. And the rest If only I could work for him. collect your money and leave! Looks like you're still alive. What's your name? I'm Lin Huai. "Huai" as in "villain". The apprenticeship ceremony will now begin. Master, Hong Shouting. Apprentice, Cheng Daqi. Our ten rules. Rule number one, never disgrace your master. You're in charge here from today. Two, no disrespect to family elders. Three, obey the street moral code. Move. Four, be loyal to one master only. There will be no gambling on my turf from now on. Get going! No opium den and prostitution. Hookers, gambling and drugs are now banned. Eight, no bullying the orphaned and the weak. Nine, no favored recruitment. Listen carefully. Once you're in the family, you must play by the rules. Anyone who breaks the rules... ...goes to the bottom of the Huangpu River. Got that? I understand, Ma'am. I really hope you'll make a name for yourself, Daqi. I won't disappoint you and Madam. I've done all kinds of business. Everything except banking. I'm hoping to have your assistance on this. What do you think, Daqi? You have many businesses on both sides of the law. But we're in a period of unrest. If war does break out, we can lose everything overnight. A bank, however, is different. You'll be taking in other people's money. Build alliances with foreign businessmen as a banker. I think it's a win-win situation. Your analysis today was excellent. Thank you, ma'am. I've already decided on your Master's behalf... ...you'll get 10% of the bank's profits. I can't accept it, ma'am! It's OK, sit down. It's already been decided, OK? Eat up. You look beautiful today. I have to wear this for work. Work? My aunt sent me to the Paramount as a dance girl. I've already worked there for two months. Well, it's just dancing. It's really just dancing, Daqi. I refuse to do other things. What other things? You must know! Alright, alright. Just live a good, upright life. Let's both work hard. One day, I'll make a name for myself in Shanghai. Daqi. Can I be your girl? Remember that bench you used to save me? It's sitting at home now. Zhiqiu. You're wet. I'm off to the bookstore. Take a stroll around. Don't go far. I'll be back soon. My boss asked me to protect you. Zhiqiu. Zhiqiu. Are you hurt? Let's go! Boss, I've looked into those who tried to nab Zhiqiu, they're all Japanese. They may be related to her husband's underground activities. General Nishino, this is my boss. Hello, Mr. Nishino. Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Are you a fan of the Peking Opera, Mr. Nishino? I am. I can even sing a few lines. When I meet with my opera friends again, Mr. Nishino should come and offer some critiques I'm also into Chinese poetry... ...and your Four Books and Five Classics. I'm guessing you don't know much about them? I'm not too familar with them... ...because I wasn't properly educated. Actually, you're quite well-known... ...among the Japanese business community. If we can truly collaborate, I think we can make a fortune. I wonder what the Japanese people mean by... ..."truly collaborate"? A true friend should speak on our behalf. Tone down those talks about anti-Japanese movements. But our nations are indeed at war. The correct perspective is that the Japanese Imperial Army... ...is building a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity nation. It'll bring peace to the people of Asia. You Chinese are like those men on stage. Fighting blindly in the dark. You don't know who the real enemy is. Bravo! I think we all know very well deep down. The Japanese is not a race of hypocrites. We'll treat our friends well. But those who are not friends, will be our enemies. What are you laughing at? I'm laughing... ...because someone in Shanghai... ...still has the guts to threaten me. We have over ten battalions surrounding Shanghai. We can take over Shanghai in three days. But there are only three of you here today. What do you mean? Even if your battalions can take Shanghai in one day, they will never, ever find you again. Cheng Daqi. How dare you threaten me? I have never been afraid of anything in my life... ...except of being a traitor. Good day, Mr. Nishino. Let's go. How are you? Hi. That man saved me the other day. I still don't understand what is going on. They were after your husband. Why? He never told you about his real identity? Call me if you run into trouble. My phone number is 32337. Daqi. Promise me one thing. Say it. I don't want my husband to know about our past. We barely know each other, Mrs. Cheng. What past are you speaking of? Thank you. I thought I would never see you again. I got into business with some friends. I came to Beijing for you once I made some money. Who is he? My good friend. Lin Huai, there's a confession chamber for bad people. You can be forgiven by talking to the priest in there. Really? I'm going in, then. I'll go there in a bit. How's your father? Father died of illness a year ago. Before he died, he regretted not letting me learn opera. He told me to work hard. Since then, I'd come here whenever I feel down. I feel at peace... ...just by sitting here. Zhiqiu. Let's never be apart again. OK? If I ever let Zhiqiu down, I will get struck by lightning. So help me God. Drop the gun, or I'll kill your girl! Drop it! Drop it! Zhiqiu. Zhiqiu! It's OK, Zhiqiu. Don't be afraid. They're all dead... Why did you kill them? Because they were bad men. What bad men?! They're human. Didn't you say you're in business? What are you really doing? I'll tell you in time. As long as I'm here, I won't let anyone hurt you. Liar! You can't even protect yourself! How can you protect me? I'm so scared. He pointed a gun at my head. I thought I was going to die. I thought I was going to die! Zhiqiu. You won't die! He was standing so close. Were you sure the bullet wouldn't hit me? Daqi. How come... I suddenly don't know you anymore? No! You're just shook up, Zhiqiu. Everything will be fine tomorrow. Daqi, I'm leaving. Only two years have passed, but we're already living in such different worlds. I can't handle a recurrence of what happened yesterday. Nor can I stand to see my man... ...fighting in a world like that. I just want a stable life as an opera performer. Please don't look for me anymore. Zhiqiu. Why would Zhiqiu pick this guy? She should've married you, Boss. Be mine. Master has so many men around him. How did he get captured? Is my ring ready? Yes, Mr. Lu, your ring is ready. How beautiful. Thank you. I meant the ring on your finger, not you. You're so rude! But you're beautiful, too. Let me see that. Why haven't I seen this before? Because last time, the diamond did not arrive yet. I'll take it. How can it be yours? I had my eye on it first. Why are you so nervous, missy? Perhaps I'm buying this ring for you. You just have to be my girlfriend. Bastard, are your eyes down at your ass? How dare you move in on my girl? Do you know who I am? Now you know who I am. I'm Lu Xiaojia, son of the Zhejiang army commander. Take him away! Move! I've already sent Mr. Yu. He's close to the commander. I also know that Commander Lu's... ...70-year-old mother is a devout Buddhist. So I paid her a visit yesterday... ...along with a jade Guanyin statue. And they're still keeping him? Cheng Daqi. Come here. I didn't say walk here. I meant kneel all the whole way here. If I kneel, will you let my master go? What did you say? I couldn't hear a thing. Only Cheng Daqi can kneel. You have guts just like your master, Daqi. I hear there's nothing you can't settle. Here's a test for you. I have three requests. Even if you have 3,000 requests, I only have two words for you. "No problem." Very well. One, Lanchun will spend three days with me. Two, have Hong issue an apology... ...on all of Shanghai's newspapers. Three, you and your master... ...will kneel your way out. And bow to me every three steps. OK? That's fine, but not good enough. May I offer some alternatives, Marshal? One, Lanchun is already taken. Let's not make her choose. Spring Garden is filled with beauties. You can have any one of them. Two, my master can hold a banquet of 100 tables... ...at Xing Hua Restaurant. Make it your grandmother's The photos will be on the newspapers. Wouldn't that look good on your family? As for the third request, I would like to offer a substitute. Tell me. Your father may have military authority, but authority can't make you money. You have power, but not fortune. You can't maintain such a large force with just power. My master recently invested in Liyuan Bank. We would like you and the commander to join us... ...and become shareholders. Our turf can expand beyond the French Concession. With Zhejiang and Jiangsu, our profits will grow exponentially. We can make a profit of 30 million in a year. Even with just a 30% share you can make over 10 million. Let's become allies and turn our grudge into cash. Isn't that a better solution? You think I'm going to buy into your bullshit? Stop it, all of you! Dad, don't believe him! Shut your mouth! Mao Zai tells me you're his friend. Is that right? Yes. We've known each other for a long time. Regarding the bank's shares, I want 50%. You're right. Maintaining harmony can bring us fortune. Then I'll decide on Master's behalf. I'll take 10% of his share, plus 10% of my own. That's 50% for Commander Lu. No, father. I must have Lanchun! I was right about you. Talent is the key to survival. If you hadn't put in a good word with Commander Lu, Master wouldn't have gotten out so easily. You're mistaken. That's not what I meant. Remember the Beijing church? Those assassins were my men. You certainly have a unique way of doing things. Fortunately, I had already collected my money beforehand. Your climb was far quicker and higher than I had expected. You must be used to killing people by now? General Mao, you truly are... the devil. That's right. I am the devil on your shoulder. Don't forget, your life belongs to me. Let's work together from now on. Get some rest. Daqi, you've really saved me this time. The formal apprentice request you gave me... ...I'm burning it right now. We'll make a vow today. From now on, we're sworn brothers! Come forward, guests! Mr. Cheng. This way! Crab accompanied by Huadiao wine. Delicious! General Mao, cheers! Shanghai today... ...is succulent just like this crab. But it is also bound, unable to move. It's waiting to be eaten up by the Japanese. Can the 87th and 88th divisions hold them back? That's exactly why I called you two here today. In addition to the standard army, my superior hopes to form a civilian militia in Shanghai. They will be used for sneak attacks. How large do you expect this militia to be? At least 10,000 men. Master and I have a lot of men, but they don't have military training. To have them fight the well-armed Japanese army... ...is like sending them to their deaths. Both civilians and soldiers are obligated to fight. This is a 10,000-men militia. Who will provide the weapons and rations? We're hoping Shanghai will provide for its own. That's absurd! With Mr. Cheng and Mr. Hong's social connections... ...and your bank clients, this shouldn't be a challenge. You're just looking to rip us off! Eat up, Shouting. The war is everyone's business. It's only natural that you take up this responsibility. Unless you two... ...have other plans. General Mao, Hong and I have hustled in Shanghai for years. We're earned a bit of vanity and fame, but we still have the guts to do three things. One, the guts... ...to drink up what we pour. Two, the guts... ...to love any pretty lady we see. But everyone seems to have forgotten... ...that we still have the guts to stay loyal at all costs. If your boss thinks this highly of us... ...then we shall oblige. Please inform them that Master Hong and I... will donate two fighter jets... ...to protect Shanghai. Truly an honorable man, Mr. Cheng. Let me offer you two a toast. I thank you on behalf of my superior. Great! Thank you. Dear commanders and guests. In honor of Mr. Cheng and Mr. Hong's generous donation... ...of two fighter jets. Let's welcome General Mao to accept on behalf of the army. Come here! Here! Look that way. Everyone says you and your master are just two criminal tycoons. But I can see that you two are completely different people. That little whore almost killed him, but he's still head over heels for her. He's hopeless. I'm sure Master is just confused. Daqi. I'm planning to divorce him. Why? Why? If he marries that slut, how would that make me look? Let me talk some sense into him. Don't. Listen to me. Be good to Bao. Do you understand what I mean? I understand. The planes have been donated, and the militia's on the front line. But if the Japanese were to attack, we can't hold them back for even three days. They won't dare to take over the French Concession. Nishino is using all kinds of ways to set up a meeting with me. I have a bad feeling about this. We may be criminals, Daqi, but we must do the right thing... ...at critical moments. I understand. There's something I would like to ask. Are you really getting a divorce? Which respectable man in Shanghai doesn't have concubines? I haven't even married Lanchun yet. If she wants a divorce, do you think I'm going to beg her to stay? I'm already 60 years old. I don't have much time left. Can't I just enjoy these last few years? You think I don't know what kind of woman Lanchun is? I've had enough of those fighting days. Just let me lose my senses for a few years. I understand. August 13th, 1937. The Battle of Songhu begins Run. Where have you been? Are you bleeding? There's no time to explain. I'll tell you later. Come over and help me, Zhiqiu. The Japanese are attacking Shanghai. We have to leave quickly. The Japanese's abduction list. Wait here. I'll go find a car! Be careful! Don't go anywhere! Hello? Honey, drop whatever you're doing. Pack up and go to Master's house. I'll be right there. I got it. Stay safe! Sir, we have to go! There's no time, Boss! It'll just be a minute. Hello? Hello? Daqi! Zhiqiu. Where are you? I'm at the hotel. Listen! The Japanese are planning to abduct you. How do you know? The Japanese are after you. Be careful! Who told you? Don't ask. Just protect yourself, OK? Hello? Zhiqiu... Zhiqiu. Who were you calling? Did you call Cheng Daqi? You two know each other, don't you?! That's right. I do know him. I don't want you to be associated with someone like him! But that's my past. I can't just abandon it. Forget it. Just don't ever contact him again. OK?! Do you know that the reason... you haven't met any harm in Shanghai... ...is because of Daqi's protection? I don't need a thug to protect me! And I don't want you to have anything to do with him! Zhiqiu...Zhiqiu! Mr. Cheng. You should leave. Mr. Cheng. General Nishino would like to see you. Zhiqiu! I'm waiting for you I'm waiting for you to come to me slowly Stay with me all night Don't let me be alone I'm waiting for you I'm waiting for you to look at me silently Tell me your future belongs to me I want nothing else All my life I've only cared for you I don't care about what they think I don't care about what they see what they say All my life I've been waiting only for you My love for you is so deep It means so much to me I'm waiting for you I'm waiting for you to embrace me Tell me I'm the only one in your heart Love me forever I'm waiting for you Mr. Cheng, thank you for saving Zhiqiu. Have some tea. To be honest, If you can use your influence on fighting the Japanese, I'm sure people will heed the call. My master and I... ...have already fulfilled our obligation. But your donation just went to lining people's pockets. The militia is just on a suicide mission. You still can't see the truth? The government you trust isn't trustworthy! You should know that people like me are clueless about politics. That's not true. You know politics very well. You're just afraid. You're afraid of losing what you have. Mr. Cheng, you're a patriot. I hope we can do something... ...for the nation together someday. I will not hesitate when that chance comes. You're late. Five more minutes, and I would've left. I have to leave Shanghai. My superior thinks so, too. You can fly to Hong Kong, then Chongqing. But I can only arrange for you to go. No. It has to be four people! Hong Shouting is too hooked on opium. He can't leave. It'll be me, Bao, Ye Zhiqiu, and her husband. Daqi. You donated the plane. You should know how big it is. With the pilot, there are only two seats. I'll let you bring one more. You decide who to bring on your own. Tough choice? I'll help you decide. You take Zhiqiu on the plane. I'll take care of Bao for you. What did you say? You said so yourself, Daqi. A man must have the guts to love. You take Zhiqiu on the plane. I'll get rid of her husband for you. Leave Bao to me. It's a win-win situation. If you wish to leave, take-off is at 9 pm, sharp. I hear the Japanese will bomb Shanghai again the day after tomorrow. I won't be able to help you then. Can't sleep, honey? I'm thinking. What are you thinking about? You're still thinking... ...about Mao's offer? I've been with you everyday since I was 16. You think I wouldn't know what's on your mind? I can't stand to see those people bully my husband. Let me go with Mao. Trust me. I know I can take care of myself. Daqi, the first day I saw you, I told myself: No matter where I am, I will always be your woman. Don't worry. Someday, I'll make that bastard pay back... ...everything he owes us. Please take Mr. and Mrs. Cheng to a safe place. I understand. Thank you. You should go now. What about you? Nobody can hold me back if I wish to leave, but you two will die if you stay. But you're in a lot of danger! Mr. Cheng, it's time to act like a man. If anything happens to her, I will never forgive you! NOW, go! Very well. Take care. Are you sure you have a way to leave, sir? I can still go to Hong Kong if I can't make it to Beijing. Lin. Come with me. I want to help you from here. I understand. This blade is my lucky charm. Take it for protection. Thank you. The Battle of Songhu leftover The air force has lost 40 planes. The navy is almost completely perished. August 15, 1937. These are the headlines: The Japanese cabinet votes to cease the "non-expansion" plan. The Japanese army plans to expand its presence in China. The navy announces a blockade of all Chinese ports. The Japanese government also announced that... ...all anti-Japanese movements in China will be suppressed. On November 12, 1937. The last band of Nationalist army will evacuate Shanghai. Nanjing will be declared fallen on December 12. With the taking of the Southern district and French Concession. Shanghai is declared fallen. I can't believe Mao betrayed the nation... ...and turned to the Japanese. The Japanese promised him... ...the governorship of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. So he shows his true nature... ...and becomes a traitorous dog. I hear Lin Huai is working for him. How about Master? What's happened to him? Mr. Hong, we've tried to meet you for a long time. But you're always avoiding us. We have no choice but to pay you a visit in person. Forget about it. I'm too ill to be mayor. Find someone else. Mr. Hong, we have no wish to make you Shanghai's mayor. Our ideal choice is still Cheng Daqi. Besides, we've already chosen someone else. This kid has guts. He killed his father... ...for going against the Imperial Army. We've decided to make him the mayor for now. Thank you for the honor, Governor Mao. This is his new girlfriend... ...but I guess you won't need any introduction. Hong, do you think you're smart? You think Ling Husheng can escape with your assets in tow? She's been captured by the Imperial Army. I now have custody of your assets. General Nishino is here to see... ...how he can renovate this house into his new home. Also, he wanted me to tell you that... ...your wife is quite enchanting. He wants to thank you on behalf of the Imperial Army. She's currently in the comfort women quarters. What are you doing?! Boss! Let him go! Your master's wife is in the interrogation department. Zhaimei is there, too. He thought things had calmed down... ...and returned to intelligence work. But it was a trap. Mr. Hong, General Nishino is here to see you. Hello, Mr. Hong. I'm sorry. Ever since the stroke... ...our boss hasn't been well. Has he really gone crazy? He gets fevers in the day and the chills at night. Not even the doctor knows why. We should feed him to the dogs. I say We keep him until Cheng Daqi returns. Let's g;! Listen up, Hong. I don't care if you're really crazy or not. I'll keep your worthless life around for now. Since you like being in that bath so much, you're to stay in it from dawn to dusk. Every day from now on! The New Asia Peace Association is honored... ...to announce this year's charity activity. Renowned artiste Ms. Ye Zhiqiu... ...will perform for the Shanghai Children's Foundation. And the organizer of our charity performance... ...is Shanghai's next mayor, Mr. Cheng Daqi! He has returned to welcome the new East Asia Era! Bravo! Thank you. Thank you for the support. The moment Mr. Cheng returns to Shanghai... ...so does the great weather! You're too kind, Mr. Nishino! Cheers! Long time no see, Governor Mao. Welcome back. With me as governor and you as mayor, we can make a lot of money together. Cheers! Cheers! When do you want to visit Hong Shouting? I've been busy since my return. Maybe another time. You should see his wife, too. I'd better not. I don't want to get an earful from her. They're no longer worth keeping alive, then. Not necessarily. That's a matter of perspectives. One is my Master, and the other is his wife. I respect them both greatly. Be sure to arrive early on the day of the show. I Will. Best of luck to you. Excuse me. Traitor! Traitor! Damn traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Boss. The Japanese army's detention centre and arsenal Speak! Tell us the truth! Where are they?! Where are they?! Speak now! Move! They were screaming like pigs out there. I hope they didn't disturb your rest, Mrs. Hong. I'm used to it already. I would pay a lot more attention... ...if you're the one screaming. When are you going to kill me? I'm only keeping you alive for Cheng Daqi's sake. Daqi won't let you off easily... ...when he comes back. He's already back. He promised General Nishino to be Shanghai's mayor. You know why he let me have Bao? Because he's back with his old flame Ye Zhiqiu. They even agreed to raise funds for our government... ...with a performance of Lady General at War. Zhiqiu, can you promise me something? What is it? Fulfill your mother's wish for me. Thank you for coming. Before we begin... ...I would like to represent the children of Shanghai... ...and thank the sponsor of this charity show. Mr. Cheng Daqi! Bravo! Bravo!

Hurry! Here. Hurry! Free us! Let us out! Let us out! Hurry UP! Ma'am, it's me, Daqi! Ma'am! I'm sorry. I arrived too late. Ma'am! Daqi... ...I've been waiting for you. Take care of yourself... ...be good. Ma'am! Ma'am. Sir, we should go. Sir. Over there! Where are you going? You're not watching? Stay with me! Stay here. Excuse me. Over there! Hurry! Sir, Farewell. I've never been afraid of death. But I am afraid of dying in vein. Remember, I'm Lin Huai. "Huai" as in "villain"! Be careful! Go! Bravo! She's really great! Bravo! Where's Lin? I think he's gone to where he wants to be. Governor Mao, I have something to tell you. All of you, leave the room. Yes, sir. Governor, I just saw a friend. She asked me to send her regards. Who? My master's wife. Ling Husheng. Go to hell! Go down and help! Yes, sir! Get out of the way! Go, Bao! Give way! Don't kill me! I'm sorry, Mr. Cheng! You bitch! I'm sorry! Don't kill me! Fire, Daqi. Don't worry about me. Kill the traitor. Don't move! Fire! Try it. Do you have the guts? Just try it. Don't put it down! You can't kill me. I taught you how to kill. Kick the gun over. Kick the gun over! Bao! Am...am I still your woman? You'll always be the love of my life. L...love... Bao! Let's go. Zhiqiu! Let's g;! You taught me this! Cheng Daqi, I order you to surrender! We'll count to three, and then we'll fire! Qne! TWO! Fatso. Let's go. OK, boss. An accomplished life in grand Shanghai Despite ups and downs, I have led a dignified life Fire! How many years have you spent by my side? A fierce fight through a journey full of obstacles Bumps on the road while flowers blossom and wither Seasons have come and gone but the curtain call has yet to arrive?? Another difficult year has passed The peace I so desire has yet to appear If success is right in front of me Why are there still promises I don't dare fulfill? I have been righteous and loyal all my life I have seen the most formidable of situations I have ridden on the roughest seas Yet, you are the only one that I will forever remember impeccable beauty is no match for practical imperfections A sumptious feast is no match for a bowl of noodles Even water from the well can be sweet
