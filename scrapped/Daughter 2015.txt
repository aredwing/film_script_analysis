What about her son? Her son has already seen quite a lot of psychiatrists but still don't have any improvement. That's why she always thinks her son is possessed by the demons. Possession? I never believe that there are ghosts in this world. The technology nowadays is that well-developed, if there really are ghosts, picture of showing both human being and ghost together should have been taken. But, is there any? How about you tell your friend to have her son comes here, I definitely can help him. Ok, I am relieved, I'll let you know once it is confirmed, Sharon. OK, see you then, goodbye.

How is it possible? It's true! I saw it today. I saw that a child was following her. Well... How about I ask Father Wong to talk to her. But, Sharon is a psychiatrist, I am afraid that she won't believe it. Well, we just try our best to help... Good Morning. Sharon, I see a kid has been following you in these few days. A kid? We don't have a kid. It's not a real kid, it's a ghost. My husband's friend, he is a priest, we can introduce him to you, see if he can help you. My daughter's might have been being frustrated recently, but I don't think it is related to ghosts. Father Wong. Look at the mirror. Did she have an abortion before? Why are you still here? Why can't I be here? So can I go back to my room? Have we ever had a rule that we cannot excuse ourselves from the table if they finish the meal first? You always leave the table first for every meal. I haven't finished yet. So we now exorcise the demon from her. Open the curtains. Ok. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I command you to come out of her! You are wicked and filthy, You will be thrown into the lake of fire! Has to make her awake! Do you have the perfume? Who are you? You hath no power in this human! We now will throw you out, every satanic power, every incursion of the infernal adversary, with the power of our Lord Jesus Chris, atone the lamb of God! You cunning snake! In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we command you! The word of the living God, to save us and unwilling to give up. Jenny. In The Name Of The Father, Son And Holy Spirit, I command you, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you. Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: whom withstand steadfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world. The demons in Jenny have been exorcised. Take a look of yours... why don't we take a picture... like a couple Mother and daughter, Mother and daughter leaf can accessorize... Look at me...
