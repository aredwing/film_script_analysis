 

                        I cannot tell you anything, Lord, Really, I cannot. I do not know. Father is waiting for you. Orense, spring 1940 Why did you send me to war, Father? What a question! Because you had to go. Good God if you were not. Wasn't it a Crusade? There, the very first ones... ... raising the flag high, son, with pride. You say with pride? But it is not easy, you know? It is that... It's that... some things are seen, Father, some things are lived. Ideals are what they are. No doubts on ours, for sure. But the war... ... the day-to-day death. They are the instincts. How? They are the instincts. Are you going to talk to me about them? Bestiality... ... terrible topics... ... enormous sins, also. Yes, this is the truth. However, let me tell you These re the same instincts... ... that make heroism arise. To start with, you must be alive if you want to fight. and more alive still, if you wants to succeed. A dead soldier dead does not win battles. Yes, of course, but... Life, Salvador... life. Would you be get shocked if I tell you that life includes sin? It's not that is shocks me or not, These days, any shocking Not. My problem is that... You've got problems or sins? All together, Father. Problems and sins. One gets out of the seminary and enters the world this way... ... in the war. For this, there is no valid preparation. You can see me: deacon, one year singing mass. Is your vocation still alive? I don't know, Father. I've done all type of nonsense. I killed. I shot people. I kill them off, in the floor, while they looked at my eyes. I had to close me eyes. My hand shook. I did not get it right, and had to shot again. and I sinned a lot. Don't worry about that. I mean, don't worry more than what's necessary. About the sins, we will worry both Our Lord Jesus Christ... ... who had already His war in the cross, and I. About the problems... ... you... ... and I, again. You are confused. And I understand it. We all have been confused at some point in our lives. Therefore... ... you need some time to see things clear. The Bible, which is very wise... ... is also very pretty, beautiful, very poetical. At some point... ... to mention those who lost their way, ... it compares them to the "blind sunflowers." They can't see the sunlight, they're lost. But the sun exists. There is light, Salvador, and it guides us. I'm going to send you to a school to teach until the end of the course. It's a more benign war. To battle with the children. Good night. Good night. Why do you need to go? So that the policy does not arrest Lalo. What did he do? Nothing. To write verses scathing priests and rich people. If they ever know they're his, they'll kill him. And why doesn't he hide with dad? Because... Wait. Barley. and we do not have sugar. Mom, do you think I should carry this coat? It is a little big. It's too much, the weather is getting better. Spring is very treacherous, you shouldn't trust it. Have it, dear. Come on, let's have breakfast, it's getting late. Are you sure you know what you're doing? If it weren't, I wouldn't stay here. You do not trust me? It's not that. The problem is that Oliveira Salazar is in very good terms with Franco. Portugal could be a trap. Let's go. Now. Good morning. Sorry, I was in the bathroom. Good morning. My aunt, you know how she is She's asking me to ask you again for the rent. It's already the 15th. On Friday. I'm delivering some work. If it was me, there would be no problem. But, I'm just following orders. I know. I have to take the boy to school. Duty comes first. I'm now going to mass. Then, can I tell her that Friday for sure? Yes, yes. It was the landlady's niece. And this people, are they reliable? Two friends of mine have already crossed. We will cross the border during the night. They will give us false documents and they will help us getting to Lisbon. Lisbon, of all places. I didn't know you wanted to go so far. And with Elenita this way, are you crazy? She is my woman and she comes with me. She will be your woman when you marry. Elena, please, please. We will marry in America. America. But what is there for you in America? Enough, fuck! Whatever is for us in America... America, that's what's for us there. Do you want me to stay here and be hunted like a rabbit. Come on, Lorenzo, it's getting late. The kid is right. If I could, I would do the same. Should you think things a little, it would be better for all. You'll see how everything ends up well. My daughter. Take this too. We don't need it, and it weights a lot. Trust me. I'll carry it. Do not cry. Mom! Enough, enough. Everything will end up well, my daughter. Very well. Do not cry. Come on. And you take care of them for me. Take care of them. Victorious flags will come back "... to the glad step of the peace..." "... they will have five roses..." "... to the arrows of my pack." "The spring will laugh again..." "... that for sky, land and sea it waits." "Go squadrons, be successful..." "... in Spain the dawn starts." - Spain! - One! - Spain! - Great! - Spain! - Free! - Long Live Franco! - Long Live! - Long Live Spain! - Long Live! To the classroom. Let's go. Whatever they tell you at home, ... you don't come to school just to learn how ... to earn a life. It is important to know how to make buildings... ... to take care of a shop, to cure the sick... ... but the most important thing, after all, ... is to be formed as people. I.e., as Christians... ... and as Spaniards. And we will do it together. Are we going to do it? Are we going to do it together? Yes! What's your name? Lorenzo Mazo Martinez. And what do you say? Will we all manage to be good Christians and good Spaniards? I think so, Father. OK... Tuesday... Arithmetic. Do you already know the four basic operations? Yes! Lorenzo, can you multiply? Yes, Father. And I can divide. How old are you? Seven. So let's see, Mr. seven years, go to the blackboard. Let's see. Twenty and four divided by six. Perfect. Who taught you to divide? My mom. What, you dad doesn't know? He died. During the war. My mother does not want to talk to me about this. Is your mother the lady that brought you to school this morning? Any brothers? Not. I cannot anymore. Come on, come on. Really, I cannot anymore. We are almost there. On the other side of the forest lies the Portuguese border. We must cross it before it dawns. I am cold, and I'm hurting. We won't do it. Rest. Be careful, don't get cut. OK. Then, where are you going? Hunt birds. With rifle? Not, with something called "liga". Come on, they are waiting for me. Going. When you're going to eat, offer them some tortilla. And if they accept? That won't happen. You only do this to be polite. Go, give a kiss to dad. Dad. I'm leaving. Where? To the countryside, with his friends. Ah. What about school? In which world you're living? It's Thursday. Mr. Camilo, Paquito's father, is taking us. Be careful, ok? Yes, dad. How's everything? I am finishing. You can take it tomorrow. Let's see if they pay me. Why won't they pay you? Yes, actually. Prepare a dose for me, come on. Another one, another one! You screwed it again! You must wait for all to seat, fuck! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Twelve plus one, thirteen. A Father's dozen. But this one is not for eating. He just sings. Somebody wants it? Me, me, me! It's yours. You all, collect firewood. Stand up! Let's see. He shouldn't water nor canary seed, ok? And now to work. Can you pluck them? What? Fuck! The birds. In order to fry them, we first need to pluck them, right? Good afternoon. Hello, hello. Blessed be the eyes! How are you doing, dear lady? Well, very well, and you? Not as beautiful as you. and so prompt. This way it's a pleasure. A thorough job. Clean, without a blot. You are very gentile. I brought the receipt. I must make some payments tomorrow, and if you could... But of course. Love is paid with love. Please take advantage and make your call, lady. You don't mind? I don't mind at all. It is my pleasure. Yes? Aunt Lola? What's up, Elena, how are you doing? So so, aunt. Elena left. If you're alone, just Lorencillo and you... ... and without the girl, wouldn't you be better with me? I think about it many times, auntie. I have to leave you now. A very strong kiss, aunt. Thanks a lot. You are German? Not, not. I am from Betanzos. But as the adage goes: Motherland is where you earn a life from. And you, how do you know German? During the war I exchanged mail with a pilot from the Condor Legion. But this cannot be true! How can you learn German by writing letters? He was killed by the reds. My condolences. The truth is... I do not know what would have happened with us... ... without the generous aid of the German comrades. Now, with our Wolfram... ... the Fhrer will conquer Europe. That's life, my son, what can you do about it? Between the cage and the frying-pan, would it choose the frying-pan? I know. But I'm sad. The water is still cold... Paquito says that we will soon be able to swim in the river. Of course. The summer is almost here. Yes, but as I can't swim... You will learn soon. Paquito was taught by his father. Wouldn't you like going to the river? Yes, of course. And when will you be able to go? We'll go. OK? We'll go. And Portugal, where is it? That way. Let's go, supper is ready. Do you think he will sing? Of course. Here we are, mom. Going. Soon. What's there for supper, mom? Marinated sardines and salad. Come on, put the table. You know, mom? Paquito says that I never let then come to play at home. What do we do? If people start gossiping, it's bad news. Let them come. Offer them a snack and that's it. Yes, something will have to be done. Lorenzo... Elenita is not here. Oops! I forgot. Come on, fuck. What was it, what was it? I'm still without milk. Well, we already have milk. "Face to the sun with the new shirt..." "... that you embroidered in red yesterday..." "... death will find me, if it reaches me..." "... and I do not come back to see you..." I will form next to my friends..." Why aren't you singing, son? Yes, I'm singing. You singing? Do you think I'm an idiot? You don't know the letter, or it is that you do not like it? He doesn't understand it. What did you say? I'm saying that my son does not want to die... ... because he wants to live. To live for me. For his mother. Good, I understand, but the homeland... The homeland is also a mother, lady, as much as any other. Of course. I say this to him some times... But the kid was absent-minded. Please forgive him. OK, but we need to talk, Ok? What's your name? Elena. Let me do, brother Tenancies, he is my pupil. A good pupil. "Go, swords, be successful..." "In Spain the dawn starts." - Spain! - One! - Spain! - Great! - Spain! - Free! - Long Live Franco! - Long Live! - Avnet Spain! - Avnet! It was the kid's mistake. It won't happen again. Do not worry, it's nothing serious. His age, poor thing, he had no malice. None. None. Believe me, brother... Salvador. It is my given name. It's not related with my having saved you... ... from the patriotic claws of brother Venancio. What is the name? Lorenzo. Not, woman, yours. Ah! Elena. How silly! Come on! Go to the classroom. Elena, we should talk about Lorenzo. I promise he will learn "Face to the sun" thoroughly. I know he does not have problems to learn what he needs. He is intelligent. He is endowed for studying. But there is something... ... strange. Strange? Yes. I do not know... ... absences, perhaps. I catch him some times absent minded. As in, sometimes yes and sometimes not. Am I clear, Elena? Well, I do not know, maybe it's... shyness. He is still a boy, and you know, in this age... And now that brother Venancio priest cannot hear us, Patriotic spirit, ha has none. Is there any reason? What reason could it be? I do not believe that a boy in this age can... Excuse me, you're right. And in the studies, he's an example. Just check the results. I know you help him with his homework. Without a father, of course... I will try to help you. It's no effort for me to give him a little attention. Lorenzo and you deserve it. And, from time to time, I'll let you know, Elena, so you know what's going on. I do not know, we can have a snack, or take a walk. I can go to your place, if it's more convenient for you. I do not know, I am not used to this type of situations and... at home, not, for sure. What is more convenient for you, of course. Whatever you prefer. Of course. Now please forgive me. I have duties. Yes. The classroom is waiting for me. ORIGINAL SIN. God had allowed them to eat all the fruits... but one. And this one, exactly this one... was the one they ate. The woman, Eve, came... and offered it to the man, Adam. and Adam bit the fruit. Look, it's here. Adam's apple. Can you see? And at this very moment... God sent its archangelic infantry.. and banished our first parents from Paradise. It banished them, and everybody else, for ever. It was the end of life without working and giving birth without pain. There came wars and death. Sin went into our blood. Do you want to come up to my house? My mother made a snack. Yeah! Oh, how pretty! - I want to see. Not, I had just had it. And what is this? A theater. Look, when I start the show, they talk. What do they talk about? See. "Good morning, I am a shepherd, and I fear the wolf". Which wolf? "Auuuu" "Auuuu" "Auuuuu" Does he kill the shepherd? No way. Here it comes the hunter... And he shots the wolf. And he dies. The snack. Cool! Are you hungry? Yes! When are you going to sing? Learn. When you finish playing, you must keep the toys. I know. And this? How come it's here? I don't use it anymore. It is warm. You can also keep it. "INFAMOUS MOB OF NOCTURNAL BIRDS" "Ite, misa est". (Go, the mass is over) Let me go. Please bring me a cup of water with sugar. We were in the part where the vision of that woman... upsets you. Her memory... I can't take it out of my head. I, ... She leaves, I see her, ... she moves her hips... She moves them as ... She wobbles. That is, she wobbles. Does she flirt? Do you think she's insinuating? Insinuating... No. I do not think so. I do not know, I am confused. But what's clear is that she does not dress with modesty. She uses light, tight clothes... Well... The heat started already, right? I mean the weather. Yes, but as I did not have... I do not know how to say it... Any dealings Any frequent, normal, dealing with sin, until the war... What happens to you comes with the age, not with the wars. As you want, Father, but I expected... that returning to the seminary will free... me from the nightmare. And why would you? The daemon does not rest, it's his business. Yes, but I think I use all the weapons that religion gives us. I want to see each woman as... ... Eve, mother of us all before the sin. Or as martyrs... who allowed the circus lions to tore their flesh... and eat them alive, before losing their virtue. This is not a good way, son. You will see no Eves in the streets You agree, none walks around naked. You see them naked when you see them, right? About the martyrs... forget about them. You risk feeling like a lion. Confession teaches a lot, you'll see. And what can I do? Hold to the demon by the horns, boy! I fear that woman beats me, Father. I think, Salvador, that in this game... you are the board, the pieces, and the dice. Maybe you don't want to see it. Let's go to take some air. Well, you can breath here. Tell me... This Elena, how did you meet her? She is a widower, a pupil's mother. An intelligent boy. A little reserved, perhaps shy. It seems sometimes yes, and sometimes not. Silence, doubts, something of a revolt, back in the deep one. The mother, the mother. She brings the boy to school, it's when I see her. She brings the boy, attends the flag raising... Sings "Face to the sun". Sings or not, because the other day brother Venancio... The mother. The mother also comes to pick him up. The same happens again. Everybody falls in, sings the song... and when they go, she moves the hips while walking. Yes. She wobbles. I get stressed. Son, you get stressed... because you look at it. You so look at it. The only remedy for that situation is to pulling the rope stronger than the devil. And if you, who has to do it, don't do it, then it's the end. What if I can't? How come you cannot? What do you pretend, to run away and come back here, to the seminary? You want to get refuge in the seminary? It would be useless. Because there's no wall, or trench... that cannot be crossed by luxury, understand? And that's what's happening to you: Luxury. Are you going to give up? Never! What would happen to the flock, to the faithful, ... ran away from the wolf, instead of fighting with him? Temptation hurts more than sin, son. Because sin ends up with forgiveness. But temptation is interminable, perennial. Can't you see with what deep art, God manages pain into us? You are in the world to vanquish the demon, the flesh... the "sursum corda", and even you. Above all, you. Then, Salvador... Then, my son... Come back to your old seminary. Not to hide, but to sing Mass... Triumphant, invicto! I've never asked you something... And I'm curious about it. Yes, Father? Have you ever seen the Caudillo [Franco] closely? Yes, once. He smiled to me. - Spain! - One! - Spain! - Great! - Spain! - Free! - Long Live Franco! - Long Live! - Avante Spain! - Avante! - I'm leaving you here - Why? Because I have to deliver this. Come on, run. I see that the two of us got late. Yes. I was thinking about you Wait a second, I'll be back soon. I cannot, I must deliver this to "Bujanda Fashions". I'll go with you. Father. Father. What happens? A tooth. I couldn't sleep at all. Can I go to the dentist? A tooth? If you didn't have any, as I do. Come on, go. Not, Father. Thank you, Father. Do you find it wrong that I have breakfast by myself? Not. Why should I? From today on I will be the last one to have breakfast, alone. And tell brother Enrique to take care of his class. "My mother is called Elena, and she cooks very well. "and she can also sew and embroider." "She hardly cries, and she hides so that I can't see her." Watchman! Watchman! Watchman! Dad, mom, are going up! Go to the bed and don't move. Going! I'm going! Who is this? Police. Open! Let's go. Sit. Here we are, again. Have you heard about the son of a bitch of your husband? We do. He is in France. Are you happy? In Toulouse. Safe. The problem... for you, I mean... w is that he's got a relationship with a prostitute. You drink? A cousin brought it. During Christmas. Drink. Drink, woman. Hey, you... Get out from there. Get out! Get out! What about your daughter? Do you know anything? We do. It seems she ran away with her lover, that Communist... who played the revolutionary poet. I am talking to you. Look at me. But they will fall. They will. Leave my son! Enough! I will take it to my mother. She likes them. Wait for me outside. The Toulouse thing was a joke. Now I'm serious. The bastard of your husband was guillotined as a thief and a murderer. He stole banks. And don't be sad, fuck. You're a free woman. You should be happy with the visit. Do you want to see the boys? I'll let you choose. Your loss. The window. I do not want to go to school, dad. Why? He says a priest dislikes him. The new one I told you about. He won't stop asking things to me. When you died, if I have any brothers. He asks the same to everybody, right? No. Come here. And you, what do you answer? First I told him I didn't know, ... Later that you went on a trip and the reds killed you, ... And that mom goes to mass. And that I want to be an airman. But he says the good thing is to be very Spanish and very Christian... And the best at all is to be a priest. OK. Don't listen to him, eh? Come, get your bag. I do not want to go, mom. Come on. Dad... Dad has many problems. You must be strong to help him. Because you must never, never lose the faith. Eh? Come on, go. Alas, what a coincidence! Yes, of course. It is that I went to the dentist. For a tooth ... And you, how are you? Well, very well, thank you. I'm very sorry. About the dentist, I mean. I'll accompany you. We can talk about Lorenzo. As the other day you didn't wait for me. I didn't know how long it would take you. And you know, the haste, to have a house, errands, ... I want to be in charge of Lorenzo, more directly. I do not know if he would accept. He's really spoiled, you know? I do not think... A man close to him will be good for him. Your husband was assassinated, I believe. Yes. War surprised him in the Republican zone. In the red zone, I mean. In the red zone. Have you thought about getting Lorenzo some study? Yes, of course. In your situation it will not be easy, I mean... that you may have problems, economic ones, I mean. I could also help you on that. Do you want an ice cream? An ice cream? Come on, what flavor do you want? Two. One vanilla. But at this time of the day... Do you like vanilla? Two vanilla. As I was saying, I could help you. I could get a fellowship for Lorenzo. Ah. In the seminary he would study for free. Lorenzo in the seminary? I do not guarantee him making it to Pope, but... Wouldnt you like to see him, I don't know, prebendary, bishop... ... cardinal? Who knows. Lorenzo does not have vocation. Good, we'll have to scratch. Because scratching... I didn't have it, either, but I found it. Don't you like it? Yes, yes. Very much. Lorenzo is still very young. I never thought about it. So, you have to think about it. Well, I already arrived. If it will not be too long, I'll wait for you. This morning I am a truant. Not, not. Don't worry. Moreover, to talk about seminary in the street, not... Thanks a lot anyway. I'll think about it. I will talk to Lorenzo. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. What do you want? The lady who just entered, do you know where to? Mrs. Elena helps here, she sews for fashion house. Why? Not, nothing, I thought she went to visit somebody, some gentleman I know in this house. I got confused, just that. Good morning. "I was an adventurer". Four. Very dangerous. I won the bet. Come on, the cards. Mine. You, you, you, and you, let's go to the theater. What about me? You can't. You didn't have any cards. But... Come on, you'll learn with the movie. Come on. - Hey, hey! Where do you go? - To the movies! Dont get dirty, or your mother will give me hell. "Come, Mariana, we will be better here." "We lie down on the grass." Not, not, not! Stop! One kiss, woman. - I've never kissed a man. - But you said you love me. This is different. - You would leave me. - I swear I won't. OK, but only one. She gave him a kiss. Fernando, not, not, not that, Fernando. She's lying in the grass. Now he's laid down too. What happens when they lie down? Don't you know that men and women lie down... -... because they like it a lot? - And they cry and scream out of pleasure. Not, Fernando! Not this! She's is eating her alive! Right? Lalo was right... I will be hunted as a rabbit. What it this about, Ricardo? Don't you understand it? This friar, priest or whatever he is... The bastard smells something. Not, it is not that. It is something else. Something else? What? I do not know... He's a mystic. This idea to turn Lorenzo into a priest. But I am sure he has no idea of whether you're alive. I am sure. "Assassinated by the reds", he said himself. And the fellowship? Lorenzo won't return to that school. No. It would be worse. Then he would start inquiring, and not about your past. Moreover, vacation time is coming soon. Next year, we can find another school. It hurts you. Cognac? No, I know what hurts me. and I know what it making me crazy. That those sons of bitches hunt me, and then shot me. That they want to kill me for what I believe. This... This is what hurts me. A lot. More than cognac, for sure. I do not want to continue living in that mouse hole. Fuck! I do not have to. and I won't translate more this Wolfram shit. so that that Hitler bastard becomes the master of Europe. And my son, nobody will turn him into a priest! Fuck God! Ricardo! Fuck God! Fuck, fuck, fuck! The famous 2nd lieutenant Salvador... Which I already knew was a seminarist, but to see you dresses as a priest. with his dress, your hair cut, ... Fuck! The truth is, it's really impressive. Should I call you Father? Not, not, I'm still a deacon. Ah. And when will sing mass? Gods willing, next year. No, thank you, I do not drink. A cigar? I don't smoke either. You see, I drink, smoke... In war and peace, the same vices. But, even you can't believe it... now I even read. Look, it's here. A great poet. And no need to be a faggot. D. Jose Maria Peman. Good writer. Even to me, sometimes he makes me cry. And when you sing mass, how do you celebrate? Like a wedding? No. As a first communion? Or as a burial? No. Fuck, it was a joke. You. I know it's not a burial. Listen, can I send you a flamenco group? Stop the bullshit... I can't forget how much you liked hookers, and now like this. What are you saying? And to see you with a clerical collar. Come in. Thank you. Let's see. Hmmm! What a guy, Ricardo Mazo Torralba. Literature teacher in the High School. Mason, joined the Republican Left. Why are you interested in this citizen? I teach in a primary school, and one of my pupils... ... is the son of this Ricardo. He died, right? "Missing person in July 1936". According to his wife, he was assassinated by the reds. This is strange. What about the woman? The mother of my pupil. Anything? "His concubine, Elena Lopez Reinares..." That is, civil marriage, ... two children..." Two children? "Elena, born in 1922, lover of the Communist poet... "... Eulalio Pecia, both fugitives from justice and in search and capture... "... and Lorenzo ". Born in 1933. None of the two has been baptized. Even I think it's crazy... If you don't want to get out, don't do it, But you need to eat. We cannot continue like this. It's Lorenzo. Can I come in? Sorry. It's the heat. One moment. It's the priest! Well, you tell me. It's about Lorenzo. I already told you my son does not have a vocation. And I learnt of something that worries me more than that. That worries you? I don't understand. Could you give a glass of water, please? Sure. Sorry... ... I have the pressure low, would you have a little wine? Wine? Not, I do not have wine. OK! Cognac? Better, better. Left-overs from Christmas, a cousin brought it. Lorenzo told me he was an only child, and I learnt he has a sister. Well, yes. But she does not live with us. and I also know that neither Lorenzo nor she are baptized. and that the girl and her lover are looked by the policy. and that your husband was a red. Mason and Republican. What a guy. Do you realize that, if Lorenzo dies... ... - this is just an example, God willing - ... he would be condemned to hell for all the eternity? I already thought about baptizing it. Do not justify yourself. I understand you. There's no malice in your face, Elena. I understand, and I pity you. What you must have been through. Hell. A mason, Republican husband... who doesn't allow you baptizing your children. A daughter escaping with a Communist poet. You're a martyr. Poor thing. How do you know all this? I know everything. But now you can be calm, you have me. I'll baptize Lorenzo will prepare him... ... for his first communion. I'll prepare some coffee for you. Good idea, while I go to the bathroom. I'll show you. In any in case, let me tell you that, if he ends up not having a... ... he can leave the seminary. I myself, so close to singing mass, I'm through a crisis... I myself feel disoriented... like the "blind sunflowers", as the Bible says. And now I do not know if I want or not to be priest. But you are not a priest? No. Deacon, just a deacon. Maximum Orders. The last one before singing mass. The bathroom. Who knows... There's no coffee. We ran out of it. I am thankful for what you're making for us. I'll talk to Lorenzo, that's the only thing I can tell you. Did you tell him you're looking for a father? Give this to me. But what are you thinking? What should I think? A woman like you... young, alone and... It's clear you know nothing about women. They never told you that, during the summer we shave our legs? You? You shave... Of course, like all. Look, this way, you see? Shave, shave, shave... They are soft. Light. But firm as steel. Please don't do this. Do not continue, please. It's Lorenzo! We still need to talk about your daughter. What was he doing here? Nothing, just talking. What did the priest want? He is not a priest, he's a deacon. But where do we go? And how? We leave Lorenzo with your aunt Lola. I am not staying with nobody. Yes, my love. Aunt Lola has a mustache, and it's itchy. Stop it. We leave the three of us. But where, Ricardo? Where? Portugal. With Elenita and Lalo? We'll travel by bus, one village to another. For short trips they do not ask for documents. What about the money? Furniture, typewriter, books, we sell everything. Mom, we are late. You're not going to school. Never again? Never. And brother Salvador? Brother Salvador, fu... Ricardo, please. Five times two, ten, five times three, fifteen... ... five times four, twenty... ... five times five, twenty five... ... five times six, thirty... ... five times seven, thirty five... Come in. Hail Mary. What's going on, now? Priest, a pupil didn't come to class, and he's an exemplary boy. I fear something has happened to him. And? I thought I should go to his house and check about him. You will not learn. Any excuse is good to go take a walk. This is the last warning, young man. If you don't show more zeal in the fulfillment of your duties... ... I'll send you back to the seminary. And now... ... this pupil you talk about. Is he called Lorenzo Mazo? Yes, priest. He's sick. Tonsils. Go back to your classroom. It's been without you for long enough. And these, why are they hidden? Because if the police finds them, they will burn them. Look. This is by Antonio Machado. He also had to run away. "Dedicated to my friend, Ricardo Maza. With the affection of its Antonio Machado". "Run away from the sad love... "Prudish love... " "Without risk, bandage, or adventure, "which expects from love a safe token, "Because in love, madness is the sensible thing "The one where the chest avoids the blind boy "And which blasphemed the fire of the life "Of a thought, not lighted flame "Which want ash that keeps the fire to it "And ash it will find, not from its flame "When it discovers the vile nonsense which it asked for, without a flower "Fruit in the branch "With a black key "the cold room of its time will open up "Wake up, bed, blurred mirror "And empty heart". Did you like it? You did not understand it. Soon you will understand. What did brother Salvador brother say? I didn't see it. Won't you regret it? Of course. But what do you want, leaving them here? Maybe Ferrndiz decides to denounce me. With all the first editions I sent him, autographed. Greed will be more powerful than fear of being caught. Complete trust. Asturians. Very clean people. And you can't imagine the bean stews they make. What about the price? Second floor, left. Watchman! Coming! Death in the Portuguese border. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Ricardo, are you there? Yes. Did you finish the book list? One moment. Yes. I'm going. What? Am I fine? You're beautiful. And what do I say to this Ferrndiz guy? You tell him you're going abroad, and you cannot take my books. But? Lorenzo is not here... My son is not here. So what? I warned the director you will beat me. Is it bad that I want to your son and you? I'm ready to abandon my career because of you? What are you saying? This is a madness! A madness where you got me into. Brother Salvador, I haven't made anything. Think about it. What are you doing? What are you doing? No, no! You cannot do this, please, don't. I will marry you Because I am free and I can go back to the army. No! Please! Please, no! No, no, no! I know you want me, you desire me. You're begging for this! No, no, no! Let her go, you son of a bitch! Aaaah! Let him go! Don't touch him! Who is this man? He's my dad, son of a bitch! Call the police! There's a red, here! There's a Communist here. Call the police! Please! Call the police, there's a hidden red here! Enough, it's enough! There's a red here, call the police! Not! What happens, mom? Ricardo! She come to me, needy, cunningly, she deceived me completely. She deceived you? Without a doubt. She did not need me as father for her son... nor as sustenance for her family. She showed fragility to attract me... She fished me, as a trout. And... If she did not want to you to add you to her family... Which is completely impossible, after the facts, What did she want you for? Who knows? To feel herself desired. Or... To hide with our friendship any suspicion about her husband's fate. Or because of lasciviousness. The easiest thing is to think that. I am certain that, outside of the house, and far from the husband... We would have had sex. And you, Salvador... Do you blame yourself at all? I should have realized what was happening. I do not know... I will not come back to the seminary, Father. I will not sing mass. I'll try to live a Christian life outside priesthood. Do not rush things, Salvador. Give it some time. When I denounced them, asking for help? He was a red, Father. A red who refused to baptize his children. Who wasn't married in Church. Who facilitated the escape of her daughter with another blasphemous one... And pushed them to death. Relax, son. Relax. I do not know if I am a good Christian, Father. Or better, I know I'm not. But I also know that I am a good Spaniard. And that red, with his suicide... He just wanted to blame me for that last impulse that send him to the emptiness. But I, Father, did not want. Come. Come, son. Come. As penance, you will pray the breviary on your knees... For the next three years. I absolve you of your sins... On behalf of the Father... The Son... And the Holy Ghost. Amen.
