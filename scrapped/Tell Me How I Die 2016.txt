 

                        1 Life, is mankind's most precious resource. It's the one thing that every living creature on this earth wants more than anything else. Now, the primary purpose of medical science has always been to heal, to extend life. But, what about improving the life we have? Shouldn't that receive just as much attention and effort? We are stimulus response creatures at our core. We do something that makes us feel good, we want to do it again. We do something that makes us feel bad and we want to avoid it. But, when the memory of these feelings fade, especially the good ones, we have to seek out this stimulus all over again. Like some drug addict looking for another fix. But what if we could change all that? What if you could not only remember the first time you fell in love, but re-experience it in full sensory detail. As if it was happening all over again. A revolutionary new memory enhancement formula from Hallorann pharmaceuticals is about to make that dream a reality. Memory increases of up to 300% have been recorded in 85% of all test subjects. And not mere static memory, no. Full memory recall. Sight, smell, taste, touch, sound. With a9913, we can relive our finest moments any time we want. It's instant access to unlimited joy. Now, how's that for improving life? Dr. Jerum, thank you for coming. Did you enjoy the presentation? It was entertaining. Walk with me. I understand your position doctor that as a man of science you prefer to focus on the details of your work rather than the big picture. But where is Dr. Rasmussen by the way? I asked him to be here as well. We aren't social. You are one of the most brilliant researchers in your field and the progress you've made on a9913 is nothing short of miraculous. But the board doesn't understand the ebb and flow of scientific discovery. They require results. And well, testing on the new compound has been quite promising. Hypothalamus stimulation has been greatly improved. Mortality rates stabilized and side effects have been reduced to a reasonable level. None of which will matter to the FDA unless they're supported by more human trials. The results from this weekends study will be ready to submit to the FDA. Good. Don't let me down doctor. In fact, don't let humanity down. How ya been? All right. Coming to beg tom for your job back? Didn't you hear? I won the lottery! Yeah I bought this place. You work for me now. Well, then I need a raise asap. Not after I caught you giving away free beer. All right boss lady. Tell me what my next customer's gonna order. Pi colada. All right. Hi, can I get like a pi colada? Sorry, we don't have a blender. Maybe a daiquiri? Still no blender. But why don't you go down there and check out our specialty. Let me know. How 'bout this guy? Ooh, Manhattan and a fake ID. Excuse me. Hey. Hey man. Do you have a Manhattan? A Manhattan? Yeah. Do you have a real ID I can see? Well at least you still haven't lost your touch. I have a gift. Only if it would help me get another job. How about this guy? Mind erasers. Hey man, that girl's pretty wasted. Can you call her a cab? Yeah, what's her name? I didn't ask, I'll go check. What was that? What? That cute little look. Look, I came here to ask if you know of anyone hiring. Do you have an idea or not? Actually yeah. There's this. Buddy of mines done it a couple of times. Says it's easy money. Unless you really wanna beg for your job back. I'd rather sell my body to science. Let's begin shall we? My name is Dr. Jerums. I'm the lead researcher for your study. Thank you for making the long drive this morning. I'm sure it's rather early for most of you. There are some formalities we must attend to. You're welcome to read along or just listen. Hey, I'm here for the study. You have agreed to participate in a phase three clinical drug trial of a9913 Olympic simulator designed to enhance memory. As this is a blinded trial... 50% of the subjects will receive the test serum. The remaining 50% will receive a placebo. During the study you will be confined to the upstairs dorms where you will be continuously monitored by the Hallorann staff. It is imperative that every volunteer reports any atypical sensation experienced. However, volunteers shall not discuss these sensations with other volunteers. Now, if you'll please pass forward your signed non-disclosure agreements along with any keys, cellphones, or other devices. Why do you need our cellphones? Umm, this is a very confidential study. Miss? Nichols. Miss Nichols, communication is tightly regulated. And our keys? Leaving the facility before the completion of this study is strictly forbidden. We can't have you go out on any joyride. Thank you for your participation. The study tech Curtis will take you to the dorms. The campus is spread over 20 acres and provides research facilities for over 1,800 employees. At any given time there might be 10 to 15 studies going on. Then, why do you guys let me come in once a month? But, due to the upcoming holiday, we are running on a skeleton crew. So please, don't make my life difficult. We're also one of the only privately owned biosafety level four facilities in the country. Which means there are thousands of drugs, and chemicals, and pathogens here that can literally kill you. So don't wander off. Right this way. Hey, two to six. Thank you sir. No buttons. I guess they really don't want us to leave. Who'd wanna leave? Go ahead and find your bags and follow me. Right this way, come on in. Come on in guys, don't be shy. Claimed. All right, you have your common room here up front. Your bunkrooms are in the back. Girls you're straight ahead. Gusy you're down the hall to the left. Get comfortable, go ahead and store your things. We'll begin calling your names for dosing in about an hour. Watch Movies And Series! So do you go to state? Yeah. My name's Kristen, with a k. What sorority are you in? Beta? No, I'm not in a - sorority. - - Kapa. I knew it, you look like a Kapa girl. They're always really pretty. And kinda smart. Men and Yola? God, I never thought I'd do one of these in a million years. But daddy cut my Christmas budget in half so. Can you believe that? He likes you. What? Chayendy rock, I caught him checking you out. What if we were doing one of those 30 day trials. I bet everybody will be hooking up. It's like summer camp. Yeah, summer camp with drugs. I don't do drugs. Where do you think we are exactly? These are prescription drugs, there's a difference. They've been tested. Yeah, tested on us. This ain't exactly your mothers medicine cabinet. Hibbard and Ruskin. Whatever, it's my time to dose. Whatever, enjoy your drugs. Newbies. So how many of these have you done? Let's see, one, two, three, carry the four, divide it by seven. A lot. Yeah, but at the end of those pharmaceutical commercials there's always this long list of disclaimers, should I be worried? Look, this is the best gig in town. We get free food, you can play pool, video games, you can even read a book if you're into that stuff. We basically get paid to do nothing. Seems like you have it all figured out. Yes I do. All while being absolutely colorblind. Sir. Still no word from Dr. Rasmussen. Do you want me to keep trying him? No, but let me know when he calls. Here, you watch them for a while. So am I supposed to believe this a coincidence? I don't know. Would you believe that? Look, the bartender gave me a flyer too. Look, I'm not like a stalker, I'm just broke. I guess I'm not the only college student who needs money. Den Fergusen. Den? Yeah, like a comfy room. Or a shelter for woodland animals. Guess my parents wanted to make life just slightly more awkward for me. Anna. Nice to stalk you Anna. Miss. What is this supposed to do again? It's a hippocampus stimulator. What does that mean though? It stimulates the hippocampus. It works on a part of your brain that's associated with memory. The hope is it may help cure Alzheimer's. Among other things. Wait. What if someone walks out? Well, you're welcome to leave of course. But the time to make that decision is now. Once you've received the injection you have to stay on site 'til the end of the study. No exceptions. For your own safety of course. And how long will it take 'til I start to feel something? Absorption rates differ according to a range of variables. Tissue density, metabolic rates, cellular efficiency. It varies per test subject. How long will it last? Again miss, that depends on the individual's physiology. The variables I just mentioned and a host of other factors. On average, six to eight hours. If you don't want to, don't. Don't forget, there's a 50% chance you'll get the placebo. And exhibit no effects whatsoever. Look at that, perfectly lined up. Gonna have to put you out of your misery man. Okay. Who's next Come on, I'll put up 60, the challenger only loses 20. Hey, if you're such the pool shark then why do a research study? Well, I heard I could meet desperate hotties who can pass an std test. Ew. It's a joke, I'm joking. Well, my dad says nobody really jokes. A persons joke actually tells you exactly what they're thinking. Let me paint a picture for you. I'm in a hold 'em game, tuition stakes. I go all in with a Jack high because I know the other guy only has queen high. A queen's better. Yeah, it is, very good. But, you don't call a $2,500 bet when you only have a queen okay. Nobody does that. But he did. Yeah, he did. So, here I am. All right come on, who's next Somebody. All right, how about you? Yeah, you want a shot at the champ? I don't play. Yup, she doesn't play. I can teach you. Come on, just in here it'll be fine. I could break that cue across your face. That would be fun. Yeah, yeah. But then you'd have to kiss it. Make it a little better. I'll play you. What, you wanna kiss me too? I like her idea better. All right big boy, I'll play ya. Bet you're pretty good too. You wouldn't risk losing in front of the girls. I guess we'll see. That's good, that's good. Don't cry everybody, it's gonna be over soon. Come on! What, okay, yeah I messed up. How did you do that? Do what? How did you put the balls back? He missed, it's your turn. You didn't just see me shoot? Okay fine. Whatever man, your loss. Doctor wants to see you. Yeah. How do you feel? Fine. Maybe a little strange I guess. He's so cocky and braggadocios. And like he thinks he's so cute because of his tiny t-shirt, and his spiky hair, and his muscly arms. And he flirts with all the girls and like, they believe it. And he's not a good pool player. It's like he had a mental breakdown. Are you okay? I don't feel so well. Is everything okay? Do you mind? He's so cocky and braggadocios, and like he thinks he's so cute because of his tiny t-shirt, and his spiky hair, and his muscly arms. And he flirts with all the girls and like, they believe it. And he's not a good pool player. It's like he had a mental breakdown. Are you okay? I don't feel so well. Is everything okay? Do you mind?! I missed a shot. And it was exactly like, I don't know, like I saw it happen I guess. Please be specific. Did you see it happen or did you experience it in full sensory detail. Sight, smell, taste. Yeah. It was like it really happened, twice. We have been testing this drug for almost three years. It's a very refined version. Any side effects should be minimal. Would you say you are predisposed to this sort of thing? To what? Seeing the future? More like intuition. Well I'm a hell of a card player. But of course that comes from counting cards. So would you say you have an above average memory? Sure. But I'm above average in most things. Okay. I'm gonna send you back but with one condition. I don't want you to discuss this with anyone. And these studies... yeah I get it. One person gets a headache, everybody thinks they got a headache. Exactly. But this was no headache. Once we had a drug study volunteer who was suddenly hit with the worst back pain you could imagine. He was in agony, couldn't even stand up. You know what he took? Nothing, placebo. Physically he was fine. There is no sensation, sight, smell, taste, that the mind cannot experience as real. Remember, keep it to yourself. It's getting worse out here, be careful. Thanks Allen, I'll try. All right, and if you have any trouble just call me, I'll come running. You better come running with some snow shoes. Whatever it takes darling. Drive safe. And then it happened again. Right after I left the doctor's office I came out here with all of you. Except, I guess I didn't because I was, just like that right back in the doctors office again. Like deja vu? No, no, it's like it happens once and then it happens again, the exact same way. It's so weird. First trippy drug study I've been a part of and I get the placebo. It's not fun okay, it's scary. Like even now, in this conversation, is this really happening or am I just about to jump back to the beginning again? It's like I don't know when now is. None of you are feeling anything? Lights out in five. Could you just give us a little longer? I don't make the rules. Lights out in five. You're not even my real dad! You know, this drug is supposed to help increase our memory. What if you're just remembering the future? Remembering the future. On a quantum level, time is not linear. Our brain's just perceive it that way so that we can differentiate between past, present, and future. I watch a lot of Dr. who. Look, I don't care what it is. I just want it to stop, now! Marcus tell them! I'm okay. That's not what you said earlier. Well that's what I'm saying now. That wasn't five minutes Curtis! Go to sleep! All I know, is I didn't sign up for this. I'm getting out of here first thing in the morning before they can give us anything else. Jerums. Dr. Jerums. How are things progressing? Fine, good. Busy. Dr. Rasmussen never showed. Well actually, that's why I'm calling. I'm afraid that Dr. Rasmussen was found dead outside of his home this morning. Do you know what happened? Not really, no, but the police are treating it as a homicide. They found some odd details at the scene. Some, sketches. Does that mean anything to you? Sketches. Dr. Jerums? Dr. Jerums are you there? Dr. Jerums are you there? Strange. Change of plans. Take me to the research facility. Ooh! Open the door please! Come on! Come on! Come on, come on! Come on! Come on! Hello! Hey! Hey, hey! Stop that! I saw them dying! Who? Her, all of them, everyone! Okay, okay, okay, just come with me we'll talk to Dr. Jerum. No way, I am done, I'm leaving! I can't let you do that! Stop, you're just making it worse! What are you doing?! They are all going to die! Are you listening to me?! Something is going to happen in that bunk and they are going to die! Let me go! Let her go! Look, step back all right. You can't just keep her here. I don't want to hurt you kid but there's a blizzard out there. If she's exhibiting side effects then she needs to be here where we can help her. You understand? I'm gonna take her to see the doctor. I'll keep you informed okay? What happened? Just acting crazy. Said she saw them dead. Saw who dead? I don't know, all of them. I had to sedate her to calm her down. Let's leave that for now. Is it happening again? I'll take it from here. Just keep an eye on the others. Right. Please, let me go. You are experiencing a very rare but very powerful side effect. Tell me what you saw. They were screaming. And gagging. I saw them dead on the floor. I'm sorry to say things are about to get much worse for you. Please. We'll talk more when you feel better. Hal that you? Hal. Www.ZooCine.CoM Watch movies and series! Shh, shh, I'm leaving. You wanna come? Come on, get your things. Where are you two going? Hey, well if we're lucky we can make it to the casino by morning. You're leaving to go gamble? We can see the future. What do you think? Look, I don't care where we're going, as long as it's not here. You should come. Well how do we get down? The doors are locked. Well I saw the scratch guy go through there. It's gotta go somewhere. Are you coming or not? Yeah, let's go. Hey, we're not splitting the money with that guy. Wait, we're really going to a casino? Awe man. Wait, do you know where we are? Sixth floor. Yeah, but do you know how to get down? Wait, wait, what just happened? Why did all the doors unlock? Shh, because my luck is on fire right now. Let's go before they switch back. Okay. Hey, the exit's this way! You're kidding me, that's why you came? Den, there are a million doors in this place man. You're never gonna find her. And if you do, what then? Marcus let's just go please. What are you doing? This is where we just came from. Behind the looking glass. Snap we're busted. No, no, he can't see us. Hello? Would you stop it. Show him your boobs. No. He can't see, go do it. Do you take anything seriously? You guys. They've been watching us the whole time. We should go. Yeah, that's what I've been saying. Shh shh. Come on! Come on, come on, come on! Don't let go! Come on! Hurry! Come on! Gotta go, go, go, go! My! Go, go, go, go, go! Hey, this way! What are you guys doing!? We're going this way! It's freezing! For your own safety of course. Heat, heat, heat, turn on the heat! It'll take a second. Was it you You little punk?! What the hell are you doing?! Hey, let him go! Did you see someone? Anyone?! I saw you guys running like hell and next thing I know I'm in a blizzard in my freaking pj's! Obviously I should have just minded my own business. Somebody murdered that nurse guy. Curtis? He's dead? Damn, I actually liked that guy. We didn't see who did it. Look, I'm not used to being the least medicated guy in a group situation. Are you sure it just wasn't one of your little visions? This really happened! Besides, we took that drug like hours ago anyway. And I didn't take it at all. If you weren't leaving why were you downstairs? Just looking around, you know, whatever. Come on, he's lying! Okay. Scratch it's okay. He's fine all right! Can we stop talking about this so that we can get the hell out of here?! We can't leave. My, I swear to god I'm gonna punch you in the face! We can't leave everybody up there not knowing what's going on! But we don't know what's going on! Can't leave everyone or just one girl? Everybody includes Anna. I'm not going back. Let's just call the cops when we make it to town. Nah in this weather that could take hours. If we could make it at all. Hey, what are you doing?! Those flashes you saw, you really think they were real? Do you really saw events before they happened? What if Anna's right too? What if they're all gonna die?! How are we supposed to do anything about that? Even Curtis couldn't do anything. They are asleep man. If there is even a chance, we can't just let them die. I mean what if it was us?! But it's not us! We're out here, so we have to go! I could take it from here. How 'bout you, you wanna come? Yeah, I'm more of a stand back and make witty observations kind of guy, so. All right, well you know this place. Any idea where they might have taken Anna? Probably the hospital ward. Just make a right on the fifth floor. Wait, can you like, leave the keys just so we could keep the heater on? This won't take long. And you are a coward. Son of a bitch. Marcus, what are you doing?! We should probably share body heat. We need to take off all our clothes. Marcus, wait up! Hey! Well we tried man. We have to go upstairs. What is that smell? Bleach, ammonia. Yeah, cleaning supplies. No, nobody cleans with both. Not if they wanna keep breathing. Basically makes mustard gas. Whatever, we going up or what? Freight elevator, yeah that'll work. I'm gonna go find Anna. You wake the others when we. Be safe. Yeah, no... (Anna panting please please. Come on! Come on! Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! They are dying god damn you! No, it's too late! It's mustard gas, they're gone! What happened?! Somebody... They're all gone, the guys too. Anna, are you okay? They are dead, it came true! It is all going to come true! I think we need to go. Right now, okay? No wait, what do you mean it's all it all came true. It doesn't matter, we have to go. It does matter. She saw them die like that and it happened. What else have you seen? Where's Kristen? That was her! Where is she?! This way! Kristen! My god! We gotta find out where this ends. Awe come on! There! Kristen! Jesus. Is she still up there? Well where is she, what did he do with her? Who? You tell me, you're the one with all the messed up visions! We saw someone kill Curtis. And we found a guards body. It has to be the same one who killed the others. And you had visions too. Yeah, of a freaking pool shot man! Not dead bodies and this! Did you see this or not? No I thought I saw her on the tile, but I never saw her face. I mean maybe this isn't her. Guys. It was a trap, he knew she'd be here. No, that's impossible. How can someone know? Someone who's taken the drug would know. Who scratch? No, no, he got the placebo like me. Yeah, well, everyone else is dead man! But this isn't the first time this drug has been tested. It could have been someone from a previous study. What else did you see? Guys. We gotta go! Who locks an emergency exit?! I didn't even know you could do that! We need to find another way out. You think?! Now! Let's try the lobby. Scratch! Is he still there? Do you see him? Scratch! Scratch! Where are they? Warm thoughts okay, think warm thoughts. Beaches, soup. That's right. I almost forgot. Let's see, we got some uppers. Some downers. Laxatives? Some future seeing things. I'm gonna say, hallucinogens. Yeah. Maybe we can open the doors from there, come on. We need an access card. Great. I can't believe you made us come back in here man. Come back? Yeah, we were gone out the door. But then team Anna here had to come back just for you. You came back for me? And the others. But yeah. Yeah, so since you're the only reason we're here, what have you seen that could help us get out? Nothing, it doesn't work like that. No, apparently it does work that way because this other nut job knows exactly what we're gonna do before we do it! Well then why don't you go find him and ask him because I don't know! Whoa. What, was that him? Maybe we can stay here and watch him coming? He's killing the cameras. Yeah, of course he is because he knew we'd be watching. We need to find the doctor. Maybe he can get us out of here. Well that's the point man. Where's he been through all this? Track that guy down. Here, Dr. Jerums, 237. Seriously? Look it's better than waiting here to die. Fine, let's go. What's happening? Why aren't we moving? It's a storm sir, freeway's backed up for miles. Damnit. Come on Jerums, pick up. Yes, this is Dr. Redmond Layton from Hallorann pharmaceuticals. I need you to send someone to our research facility. It seems as if we've lost contact with them. Yes I'm well aware of the storm. In fact I'm stuck in it right now which is why I've called you. No, I'm not asking you to rescue me. I'm asking you to send someone because I fear something may have happened to someone at my facility! Why am I saving humanity again? Okay. Thank god. Hell yeah. A key. Key, key. He's not here, I'm shocked! Look for anything that might help. Access cards, maybe our cellphones. Yeah phone's dead. Are you sure, because at some point I think I remember a phone ringing. Well if the phone rings we'll know it's working again won't we? Guys. This is Dr. Rasmussen, Dr. Jerums. Interview 21 patient eight, paskell dern. Tell us about another one of these experiences you're having. Why? Because it'll help us understand what's happened to you. Paskell are you... I'll tell you but it won't help. You figure out the writing on the bunkroom wall yet den? Okay den, what does den mean? To go den, to go. I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand. You will. That file was created six months ago. No, I don't understand. How is he talking to you? Because he saw it. He already knew that we'd be here watching this video. Probably even a sketch of it somewhere. What was he saying? To go? That doesn't make any sense. I need a wall. They weren't numbers. It wasn't 60, it was go. What? 52 go? No it's five. You, Kristen, scratch, den, and me. Five to go. Hello? Hey it's me. Scratch. Hang up, I need to call the cops. I already tried that. It's an inside line, I've been dialing extensions looking for you guys. I'm with Marcus and Anna. All the others are dead. Anna's vision came true. You understand? Now all the doors are locked and we can't get out. Okay, they're all dead? Really? Where are you? Some old garage. Hey listen, I found a bunch of sketches. They're actually pretty good. But it's weird 'cause one of them kinda looks like me. I mean, other than the eyes. My eyes are pretty off. Yeah we found some too. We think the killer drew 'em he was a patient. So a drug made him see us? Wow, that's. Hey, could you ask Anna if she had any visions about me? He wants to know if you've had any visions about him. No. But you are telling me that there is a crazy murderist, somewhat decently talented artist stalking this place? Who knows exactly what we're gonna do before we do it? Yup. Okay, good to know. Listen, scratch is there any other way out of here? I don't know. But Curtis once threatened to lock me in some biohazard clean room in the basement. Maybe you guys could hide out there 'til morning? Okay, we'll check it out. What are you gonna de? I'll think of something. I say we go to the shelter. No forget it. Marcus, Marcus, it might be safer. What?! What aren't you telling us? Back off. What are you gonna do? Hey quit it! - Come on, come on! - - Hey, hey, hey! Guys! Quit it, I saw something okay! I saw a lot of things. Like what? Shit, okay. Who gets it, him or me? Tell us. We deserve to know. Both of you. Dead? No, no, just because you see it happen doesn't mean it will. Yeah, I know, maybe it won't happen. But everything else has come true. Hasn't it? Some of them are small like the phones ringing and the doors locking. But no matter what I do, they keep coming true! And the other ones like the girls in the bunker, and the number on the wall, I don't think I can stop them. Are you still having the visions? No. But I think I only saw things I'm actually going to see. So maybe if we can go somewhere I haven't seen. Like the shelter. Somehow derail the path we're on, change fate. It's worth a shot isn't it? And what about you? You see what happens to you? No. The shelter? Yeah. Hey, maybe we should just leave that here. Why? He probably left it for us to take. Or maybe he wants us to leave it so someone else can take it. Or have you seen that too? Yeah. Well I went in the dorm first. I'll do it. I don't think you have to worry. Wait. Why doesn't he have to worry? When you saw me. How do I? You drown. What? How could I drown? I just know what I saw. What about me? You die in a hallway. Hallway? This place is nothing but hallways. I'm gonna find the damn shelter. Asshole, open the door. Open the door or I'm gonna beat your ass! Just stop being a dick and open the damn door! No. At least help us figure out what we're up against. Tell us about paskell. Should have seen that coming. My partner and I had been testing memory formula for many years. But, paskell was the first who had visions as a side effect. And not just visions, but his actual future. His foresight. So you gave him more, didn't you? It was very promising. We continued experimenting as we modified it. Yes of course. And? We discovered the effects are cumulative. He had a psychotic break and began experiencing visions of violence. So you stopped dosing him? Yes, but, the visions continued. His brain somehow began producing the effects. Much like an addicts produce an opiate response. And he stopped experiencing time as linear. Past, present, future, it all existed simultaneously. It drove him mad, he had to be committed. And that didn't stop you from putting that stuff into us? Every worthwhile discovery has risk. The goal is to make that risk, in this case, side effects, reasonable. Yeah, yeah, very reasonable. So side effects may include hallucinations, psychosis, killing everyone you've ever met. Hey, but at least there's no anal leakage right? Not in this version no. I wanna kill this guy! Remember this? He's not after us is he? He's just using us to try to force you to kill yourself. It would seem so. My partner died last night. Probably trying to save his family. And yet you're hiding out in a bomb shelter leaving us to die. You're not my family. Has it not occurred to you that paskell might know you'd hide out in here? Well yes of course, but there aren't many options are there? I'll take my chances in here. You bastard! This is your problem not ours! I'm in here and you're out there. So, actually this is very much your problem. See the future. See the future. This stupid drug doesn't even work. Okay, okay. You know what I don't understand? Why paskell doesn't just kill that guy? Yeah, why doesn't he just walk up and shoot him in the face? I don't know. Maybe it's like Anna. He sees things that are gonna happen but he doesn't control them. How 'bout it asshole? Does he control the visions or do they control him? It's impossible to say. What if somebody were to kill him? Would his visions still come true after he's dead? That's an excellent question. So I'm thinking we just stay here. Arm up the best we can and make our stand. Look, at least we'll see him coming. And there's no water down here. Why'd you come back? What do you mean? Marcus said you were outside. Why'd you come back for me? You hardly know me. I mean we came back for everyone. But, I'd like to know you Anna. Well that can't happen. Not anymore, not after that asshole sentenced us to die. No, don't give up. Whatever happens we can't give up. Why not? We're just prolonging the inevitable. What are you talking about? He knows everything. Remember? Why would he go through all of this trouble just make Jerums commit suicide? He's getting rid of the drug den. Every last trace. And that includes us. Not you. You took a placebo. You could just hide in a corner, wait for the Calvary. He doesn't know that. Sure he does, she just said it. He knows everything. Which is why we need to do something that he doesn't expect. Okay, so I was talking to dickless over there and I got an idea. What if we can get one step ahead of these visions and do something that hasn't been seen yet? Well that's a big if. I mean we don't know what his visions are. Or where he is. I know but, think about it. She told us how she saw us die. So, what if, she didn't see it, would it still happen? Are we talking about paskell or Anna? I'm not saying we hurt her, we just, we tie her up. It's practically self defense man. Step back now. Relax, just relax. It's just an idea. We're figuring stuff out. Figure something else. Yeah. Look around, see if there's any way out! No, is it happening now? Is it my turn now? Hey come on man, come on. Please let us in. We won't tell the cops that you saved us! You'll be a hero! Come on! You guys there's another door over here! Come on! He's gonna kill me now isn't he?! I don't know Marcus, I don't know! Marcus help me! Did you see that coming?! Marcus! Marcus no. No! Marcus! Marcus! No, no, no, no. Is he? Yeah. Where's paskell, why would he just leave? He never meant to come down. He knew he didn't need to. He knew. There's no way. No, no, no, listen to me. You cannot give up. There has to be something. What, some way to change the future? What if Marcus was right? I should kill you?! No, no, no, no, I mean, if we are nowhere near each other how can I see you die? And if I can't see you die... will it still happen? No, no it's too dangerous being trapped inside like this. Den. Anna, even if it means I'm going to die, I'm not leaving you in here alone with him. It can't be that simple. What? Come on, we're getting out of here. Not more stairs. Come on! Here, here. No, no, are you crazy?! This is way too high, we cannot jump. Maybe, come on. Look at that snow drift. It's deep Anna, we can make it. Come on. I can't do this. Anna, look at me. We jump on three. One, two, three. What are you doing?! You said you wouldn't leave me alone! I said I wouldn't leave you alone in here! My keys are in the jacket! Go get help! Den, den! My god I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, my god. Okay. What did you do? What are you waiting for?! You already know where I'm going. That makes one of us. Son of a bitch. Paskell! I was wrong. Hey! I saw Kristen dead in the bathroom but I just found her outside. These visions don't always come true do they? Did you tell the others how they died? Everyone except Kristen. This isn't fate is it? It's more like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Well, certainly by telling them you influence their behavior. And therefore the outcome. And what about paskell? Do his visions always come true? It's hard to say. He sees so much. Because the drug is cumulative right? And he's had a lot. He has. What are you looking for? That's not your drug you use. That's the property of this facility. Stop and listen to me, the dosage is too high. You won't be able to control your visions. Remind me to tell you how you die. Paskell! Let's get this over with. Hello den. Don't move or I'll... take my head off. I know. I know. Don't swing so hard. You'll tire yourself out. You won't be able to run. Watch your step. Get off, get off me! I'll kill you! Why are you doing this? I really wish you could surprise me. Paskell! Why are you doing this? Paskell! Den! Why have I not been able to contact you? What are you doing here?! Are you aware there's a car parked in my lobby?! Please, shut the door. Forget the door! Shut the door! Have you finally lost your mind?! Why are you here? Why do you think I'm here? I've been calling you all night! Driving through a blinding snow storm to find out what the hell's been going on with my study! It's gonna be okay. Hold on, hold on! Okay? It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay, hold on.
