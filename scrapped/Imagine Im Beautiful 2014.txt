 

                        What?! Hi... I called about the apartment. Shit. I forgot. Shit, hang on. Come on in! You know I'm just showing the apartment, right? Yeah, I just got here. Great. Bathroom; Kitchen; Living room; My room; Empty room. Sorry about that. I'm Lana! Kate. It's nice. Yeah, um... so, I don't need any references and I won't run a credit check. That's what you said on the phone. So here's the room. I used to use it as an office but... so you said you just moved to the city? Yeah. From where? Utah. So do you have a job or what? No, but I'll find one. And I can pay the security deposit and the first month's rent in cash. Are you a serial killer? No. That's been happening a lot. I have NO idea what they're doing up there. Okay. Okay what? Do you want the room? Are you a serial killer? Look, my ex-boyfriend just moved out and Friday's the first of the month and the woman who came to look at the room yesterday had a ferret who took a shit on my couch so... if you want the room, it's yours. Whatever. Uh, yeah. Great. Okay. You probably shouldn't be carrying around this much cash in New York. I'm really excited to live in Brooklyn. You know this is south Brooklyn, it's not like Williamsburg or, whatever. I've wanted to live here my whole life. So, are you an actress? No. Yeah... uh... make yourself at home. I'll be in my room if you need anything. Okay. Good morning. Do you not work? No. Oh. You didn't say you were a smoker. I'm not. Excuse me? Uh... I wanted to interview for the waitressing job? Thanks. Are you the owner? No. Hey gorgeous, sorry to keep you waiting, it'll just be two more seconds. Oh, no, Tommy, take your time. Seriously. Okay. Hey. Do you think it's going to be a really big problem that I don't have any waitressing experience? Nice dress. Thank you. Where are you from? Uh, Utah. Utah? Wow. Your shoes are amazing. Aww! Thank you! Good luck with the job. Hey Utah? How long have you been in the city? Five days. Wow. Well, a bunch of us are going to be hanging out on the lower east side tonight. Maybe I can introduce you to some people. Great! Natasha. Come into my office, young lady. Ten o'clock. Text me. Oh, uh, Kate? No, I'm Lana. I just moved in. Oh, I am Joe, the super. Hi. I'm so, so, so sorry. Could you turn down the music? Oh, yeah. It's uh... yes. I'm sorry. Somebody call. Yes, I'm sorry. No problem, just somebody call. - Okay... thanks. - Geoff here? No? He moved out. They get married? No? I don't think so. Oh, she have baby? No? No. Oh... okay. Turn it down. Okay, thanks. Kate? Kate? Can you turn down the music? The super came; Somebody complained. Hi Natasha? It's Lana. We met at the restaurant earlier? I'm at the address you gave me. Uh... so call me! Okay, bye. Hey? Club's there. Oh, okay. Oh, Natasha! Hey! It's Lana! Lana, hi! Hi! It's good to see you! Are you okay? Yeah, no, I'm fine, it's just fucking Tommy bailed on me, asshole. Oh... um, this place looks cool. Yeah, it's amazing, right? I thought you said ten o'clock... So how are you? Did you meet anyone in New York yet? Oh, no. Um... I thought you were going to introduce me. He looks like he wants to get to know you. Oh, yeah. We're on the list. Hey. How's it going? We're going in here. DJ's lame. We're headed out. Oh yeah? Where you headed? Hey guys, I'll catch ya later. Yeah, have fun. Why don't you get us a cab? Wait a minute, I thought that we were... You look so hot. I'll call you! That's a beautiful dress. We could go back to my place. Yeah... uh... Hot. What's the matter with your mouth? I just get jaw tension. You should relax. Rough night? Are you alright? What? It's 7am. I have job interviews all day but I'm going to be home tonight. Just so you know. Hi Natasha, it's Lana. I just wanted to make sure we got home alright last night. I would love if we could hang out sometime. Okay. Uh, call me. Bye. Kate? Yeah? Would you move your stuff out of the kitchen? I need to make dinner. Just give me like... twenty minutes. Could you do it now? I'm really hungry. Hello, Mom? Hello? Oh my God. Mom! Momma! No! Momma! Oh my God! What did you do?! Mom! Hello? Lana? Natasha? Are you okay? No, they took my purse, and I can't find my keys! I don't know where I am! Why don't you come over? I don't know where you live! Yeah, no, no, I'll text you the address. Hey... Hi. I thought they took my purse but... then I found it again! Come on in. Sorry. It's okay. I'm so sorry for coming over like this. Oh! It's just, I don't think that I have my keys. Hey, what are friends for! Oh God. God! What is that awful music? Oh, um... I'm sorry, I... I took some Molly. I feel like shit. It's okay. I'll take care of you. Let me get you some water. Can I use your bathroom? Oh yeah, it's the door on the left. Oh, no, no, no, it's not that one! Holy shit, man, are you burning yourself? Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you?! She's my friend. Nice! You need to get her the hell out of my apartment! It's my apartment too. Hey, what's your name? Natasha. Hey, Natasha, get out of my apartment! What kind of psycho tries to burn them self? Get out! Shit. She's clearly really fucked up. You can't say that! Chill out! I'm so, so, sorry about this. I got her in a cab. Thanks. You have awesome taste in friends. Just throw them out, they're really shitty anyway. I saw the razor. Look, you don't want to get into this. I lost my mom. Right before I moved to New York. She killed herself. I have another job interview today but I'll see you tonight? Okay. I got a job. At a chocolate restaurant. Yay! Let's get you into bed. You scared me! You cook. Yeah. Do you? No... Geoff, my ex, did. He was a really good cook. Did you, uh... put me in bed? That's embarrassing. It's fine. I saw your photos. You're very talented. Please stay out of my room. I was putting in bed. Do you still take pictures? No. Why not? I don't think my camera still works... I don't even know where it is. You mostly paint now? Oh... no. I'm not a painter. That was me just... wigging out. Those deserved to be thrown up on. I really can't even say how sorry I am about that. They were terrible. You're a better photographer. You should have some of this! No. Mop up that alcohol? What do you do now? Um... I'm a financial consultant. Or... was. It's complicated. I've always wanted to have my picture taken. What do you... No, I mean, for real. Okay... I think that when you see a photo of someone, you can kind of tell who they are. So, why do you need a photo of yourself? Oh my God. I've been living off ramen and takeout since Geoff left. Mmm... Mmm... thank you. You can't just stay home for the rest of your life! Kate? Your mom won't stop calling me because you won't even return her phone calls. Why is she calling you? That's not the point! I think maybe it will be a good idea for you to talk to someone. Oh, who... someone? You... someone? No, like... Just because I don't want to be with you doesn't mean I need to see a shrink. I love you. We can still be a family. Okay! I just want you to be okay. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... You must be? Lana, we met before. Can we just talk about this? I don't know what else there is to say. Fine. Look, just call me if you need anything. Enjoy the croissant. It was nice to meet you. He seems nice. You want a croissant? What are you doing up there?! Maybe I do need therapy. Therapy's where people send you when they can't be bothered to help you themselves. Who said that? No one. You know he's actually really great. He's really fucking nice to me. I'm supposed to be going to work but... I can call out. No... don't do that. It's not your job to take care of me. I'm really sorry about your mom. That must have been really shitty. Hang on. There wasn't really anything wrong with it but they did clean up the lens a little bit. What?! What is all this? It's just a couple of things I picked up. They're for you. Lana, this is way too much. I have a job now. Yeah, as a hostess. I make good tips. You don't have to use them. No, no, thank you... very much. I was... that was really sweet of you. You're my first friend in New York. Are we friends? Sorry! I'm sorry. Let's go on an adventure. Where? Bring your camera. You always wear that scarf. My mom used to have one just like it. Do you mind if I ask what happened? You don't have to... It's fine. Um... I came home one day and the house was quiet. It was weirdly quiet. And... when I got to the living room... she was there. You found her? How did she...? She slit her wrists. Do you miss her? All the time. Who keeps calling you? Someone I don't want to talk to. From home? My mom. You don't like your mom? Uh, she made me grow up in New Jersey. Let's go get drunk. No. Don't you want to experience reality? Not really. This is my favourite place in the whole world. You're a really nice person. You don't meet too many of those in New York. I think you're nice too. Yeah... You must be the new guy. The one we always hear banging around up there? What? We're 2B? Oh! Sorry. I'm Massi. Kate. This is my room-mate, Lana. Do they only let beautiful people live in 2B? Yeah, there's a clause in the lease. Well, if you ever need a cup of sugar, you know where to find me. Do you want some tea? Thank you. You photograph very well. You're very pretty. Thanks. They're very beautiful. That should be your job. How far along were you? You were gonna have a baby, right? How did you...? The super said something. Um... Five months. What happened? Um... I... I started bleeding, um, a little bit. And then I started bleeding a lot and... then, by the time we got to the doctor's the next morning, there was no heartbeat and... and... then they had to take it out. I'm so sorry. Shit happens. Were you trying? No... no. You guys were gonna get married? Yeah. Why didn't you? What is this, 20 questions? I don't know. He got sad. I got mean. I wouldn't have sex with him anymore and it just kind of... exploded. Fuck him, you know. It's okay, it's okay... it's okay, it's okay. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay... it's fine. Hey, it's fine. It's fine. It's okay. It's okay. I couldn't remember if you liked your eggs totally cooked, or a little runny. You're all dressed up? Where are you going? Back to work! Oh! Yeah, I emailed my boss two days ago and he's letting me come back. Oh, thank you! I thought you were going to think about going back to photography? Oh my God. That doesn't pay the rent. But you hated that job. Um, are you working at the restaurant tonight? No. Shall I come meet you after work? I might be late. Why don't I bring home dinner to celebrate? Great. No, no, I'll do it. Thank you. Okay! Bye. Bye! Get your shoes! Hello. How'd it go? It was boring. I brought home dinner. I liked him first. I'm so sorry. I was joking! God, why would I do that? Have you seen him? I think a lot of people would. You liked him and I slept with him. I met him once in the hallway. I can move out if you want. Why would I want you to move out because of some guy? You're not moving out! Are you sure? Yes! I don't have to see him again. See him again! I mean, I'm not going to be responsible for fucking up your relationship too. He's nice. He has his own wine company. A hot foreign guy with his own wine company. I mean, he sounds made up. Now this sauce is almost perfect. We have the garlic, the tomatoes, the onions. I forgot the cheese! Okay, add a little cheese. Sprinkle. Hey! Hi! Smells great. Mmm... Mmm... mmm... Come eat! I'm fine. Have a good night. Hey! I didn't mean to make you sad. I know, it's just, Geoff and... I can stop if it's too much. No, no, no, it's just me being dumb. Can we hangout tomorrow? Yeah. Good. Oh! You crazy girl! That's a good thing, like nobody else. Why is everyone I work with such a douchebag? It just makes me want to punch everyone in the face all the time. I wish you'd stop smoking. I'm not smoking, I'm quitting. Don't be mad. I called him. What?! I got his number off your phone, I'm sorry, I called him. Why would... Come on. Come on in! I can't be everything for you, Katie. Lana... I don't want you to be sad about me and Massi. You love him! Do you still love her? Yeah. Well then you have to try! Can you believe her? Just talk about it. We're having a picnic on Saturday... you should come. Why did you leave Argentina? Things were messy there. What are you thinking so hard about? Do you miss your family? Sometimes. I've got you now. Move in with me. With you? And Kate? And leave that whole two-bedroom that I have all to myself? Let's not mess this up. I like being around you. Bye. Where's Geoff? He left. You shouldn't have called him. Why not? It's none of your business. It's some of my business, you're my friend. You deal with your shit; I'll deal with mine. Yeah, that was going so well for you before. I'm just trying to help. He's coming on Saturday. So, do you bottle the wine yourself, or? No, we just import it. Wow, that's really cool. It's something to do. Can I have a grape? Geoff is a great graphic designer. Oh yeah? Not really... I work at a coffee bar in Williamsburg. He's good... that's how we met. Freshman year art class. Yeah, okay, don't get all sentimental on me. Katie's an amazing photographer. She is! I guess we're the only ones without any talent. This may be the best day of my whole life. Of your whole life? Uh-huh. Sorry. Will you just come here? I'm not having sex with you. I know, will you come here? Could you at least try? There. Happy? No. What do you want from me? Just talk to me about it. Why? Maybe it will help! Is it going to change what happened? No! I'm sad too. You keep saying that like I don't know that. I know you're sad. It was awful. But you gotta get over it. You get over it! I'm trying! We could have another one! I don't want another one! Geoff, do you want to know what I felt like when I lost it? Our daughter? I felt relieved, Geoff! I felt relieved that it wasn't going to be born and mess up my life! I have to go. See you later. What is wrong with me?! It is going to get better. I mean, I thought I was getting better! I can't have sex with my own boyfriend. He understands. Yeah, well, he's only going to understand for so long. I thought... I thought maybe it could work again, but I don't know. I'll see you later. Let me come with you. No, I just need to be by myself right now. Where's Kate? She went for a walk. Rough day, huh? Yeah, we've been having a lot of those. Do you want some wine? What ya got? Mmmm, well, I have Massi's. I cannot pronounce it but I'm sure it's amazing. She hates me. I don't think she meant what she said. I think she probably did. We would have been shitty parents. You would have loved her. You probably think I'm a total loser, hanging around with this girl who doesn't want me anymore. She still wants you. No wonder she was relieved, she got out of marrying me! Look at me, I've never really tried to do anything and I'm pretty sure I'm going bald. I think you're pretty great. You're just saying that because you know I'm right. She says she's going to her parents' in New Jersey for the night. Awesome! She'd rather spend the night in Jersey than with me. I guess I'll go. I rented Sharktopus. Kate and I were going to watch it but... if you're interested? Bad movies pair very well with expensive wine. That was awful. I don't even know what just happened. God I get so hot in this apartment. Yeah I know, I used to live here. Oh. Duh. So how's this city working out for you? I love it. Good. She still doesn't want to have sex. I know. Sorry. Shit. You don't want to hear about this. It's fine. It's not even about the sex... it's just... I just want... I just want her to like me again. Did Kate tell you what happened to my mom? Yeah. I'm really sorry about that. Do you think I'm beautiful, Geoff? Yeah. You don't have to lie about it. No, I do. I do. You could have me while you wait for her. What? While you're waiting for her to get better, you could have me. Lana... No, look... she loves you! I don't want her to lose you! So just take me while you wait for her. Lana, what... You don't want me? No, no... it's... I'm not sure. Imagine I'm her. How long has it been? What about Massi? We're a family. Families do whatever they have to to take care of each other. Just imagine I'm her. Call me Katie. Katie... Good morning. You waited. That's really nice. I'm sorry. Me too. Do you hate me? No. We'll figure it out. I'm sorry I've been such an asshole. It's okay. You were always pretty much an asshole. I love you. I love you too. I gotta get to work. I just wanted to make sure you got home okay. Katie? It's all gonna be okay. Hello? Hey, can I come up? Kate won't be home until seven. Yeah, I know. Hi, can I come in? I just want you to know I've never cheated on anyone before. I'm not the kind of guy who does that. I know. Is this okay? We're going to have to tell Katie, you know. It'll be okay. Buh buh buh buh buh bah! Happy birthday! Oh my God. No one has made me a birthday cake since I was like 15. Yay! Nice job! Okay, I have an announcement to make! Let's have a toast. So... when I moved to New York, I had just lost my mom and I was really sad and lonely and then I met Katie and she was evil. And she was nice. And now I'm not sad and I'm not lonely. It's true. But, I know that there's been one thing that's been really hard for you. And I know it's been hurting you a lot so... Geoff and I have started sleeping together. I don't mind, and this way, you can take as much time as you need. What are you talking about? Katie... I mean, I know it's a bit of a surprise but... Are you serious? You're sleeping with him? Only until Katie gets better. For how long? About a week. A week. Massi! I thought you knew! You thought I knew? You were sleeping with my girlfriend! And I just didn't care?! How many times? Answer me... how many times?! Stop it! That is no way to behave! I think you should go! You're just going to sit there? It doesn't mean anything. He's your boyfriend. Katie... Could you just go stand in the fucking hallway or something? Yeah. Sure. How many times? Twice. Where? In my bedroom. Is it good for you? I'm not going to answer that. Does he make you cum? Stop. This way, you don't have to worry about it. He's not going to go looking for it somewhere else and you don't have to do it until you're ready. Come here. Kiss her. What? Kiss her. Let's go get a drink. Okay. Do you want to come? No. Did you have a nice time? We did. We had a nice time. I just want you to be happy. Okay. Okay. Hi. Hi. I'm fine. No. I've been going to our park a lot; I've been thinking about you. I'm sorry you're dead. I miss you. Okay. I'm gonna go for a walk. Do you want me to come? No. Lana? Sorry... I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else. Wait, did you call me Lana? Yeah, I'm sorry, I thought you were my friend. I have a daughter. Lana. She's run away. I'm sorry... I... Do you know where she is? Who are you? I'm her mother. Her mother's dead. I'm not dead. I'm sorry... did you just come here from Utah? I live on the upper east side. Oh, hey. I've been calling you. What is she doing here? You told me your mother was dead. She is! Lana, don't say that. My mother is dead! I watched her die. Lana! Hello Lana. It's nice to see you. Lana, please, open the door! It's your mother. What's going on? What's he doing here? Your mother would like you to come see me again. I just want to talk to you, honey, just for a few minutes. Please, just open the door. Sweetheart, sweetheart, it's me! Stop it! I do not know who you are! I'm Dorothy Bower. I'm your mother! You're Lana Bower! We'd like you to agree to an inpatient program. Is that true? Dr. Whitaker, I have been so much better. Stop it! You're lying now! This is what you do! - You... - Dorothy... Does she know? Did you know that this is what she always does? I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you prey on people until you become everything they need! No! Isn't that right? You will do or say anything, just as long as people love you and think you're perfect! Help me! You have to help me! Oh yes, my perfect little Lana! That's not true! Then what is true? Lana! I tried to have her committed. Stop! I don't know what else to do. Lana. How about it? She's right. Dr. Whitaker. I think it probably is best if I go with you. That's what you want, isn't it Momma? Do you think I'm beautiful? Can I at least spend one last night in my own room? That'll be fine. I'll expect you both at 8am tomorrow. What?! Hi. I called about the apartment.
