had to help wash him so saw him naked never realised he was so small so short Yes Inspector Judge Varga used to come here every Sunday He liked talking to the mummies Hed make the dead reveal the secrets of the living Hed talk to the mummies Of course Youre from Rome There are some things you cant understand Open it See him Bernardo da Corleone a great th century lawyer In those days the dead persons family would come and tell the deceased their secrets And our Don Bernardo who at the time was still alive would come down to the crypt at night and get the corpses to tell him everything So he knew everthing about everybody Everything about everybody Let me talk about little white jasmines This fataljustpicked blossom symbolises the purity of his existence And its scent evokes the goodness he brought to the courts and to his family It was this Spring blossom which caught the last breath of Judge Varga who will now appear before the ultimate Judge and be admitted to His Kingdom For thirty years he fought against crime and the Mafia and the Mafia has killed him He was the Mafia He was the Mafia Organised crime has never been so daring before Its the first time a judge has been murdered Mafia Youre the Mafia Youre the Mafia Its an appalling crime aimed against the whole judiciary and its a challenge to the States authority Why is your name linked to the dead judge and garbage They attack me because was his best friend What about the garbage Come and have a look Hear that Theyre not striking for more pay They even have cars to come to work Theyre starting a cholera epidemic just to screw me Where does Judge Varga come into it Varga was murdered because he was about to arrest them Not these wretches but their puppeteers Give me a hand This guys dead He has no

with good reason Three judges have been killed in twenty days in three towns quite near each other All killed the same way by bullets from the same gun which must be a rifle and silencer Enough evidence to suggest a vendetta vendetta By whom victim of a judicial error Do you know whether the three judges were ever on the same case YesThey worked together for eight years Doctor The plane is ready to take off Let me say one more thing Actually knew thered be another killing in this town havent made a mistake was here when they shot Calamo Then the papers are right Youre a jinx Anyway ve

This is the wife of Cres She used animal welfare to frame him Do you think Cres was innocent too He prepared the chocolate rice He cooked it quite ofter Yes my husband Well then do any doubts still linger No Not unless we think this poor woman designed a diabolical scheme to incriminate her husband Even to the extent of sacrificing a life of a poor innocent cat For years the only companion in her lonely existence That would be absurd He wanted to murder his wife He set up a fake suicide You must find him guilty The woman where is she now Your guess is as good as mine She took off while he was still in jail She stripped half the house and left him with her portrait And hes placed it in front of his bed Doctor Is the headless figure Cres think so Maybe his wife did it out of spite Who

in vain to see Mr Cres the chemist But his house is locked And no one is answering What do you want with the chemist Nothing in particular looked up his file a strange case indeed need to put a face to it want to meet the man But the Cres trial has no link with anything nowadays It was much talked about And the sentence was very controversial Werent you one of the judges was only the recorder The decision was made by Judge Varga and Chief Judge Sanza And theyve both been killed Forty metres They fired from over there Who lives there Its a condemned building fire was lit in one of the rooms The killer must have spent the night there He must have known the judges habit pretty well Arent they removing the corpse Doctor theres an ambulance strike We cant find a vehicle Use one of our cars Do

gronies think ll tell you a story off the record nice story Its about a man his wife and a cat This one No This one No m afraid not This one believe this one resembles him a little But its only a drawing not a photograph Enough times spent on this we have to finish You Give me your description again Wanted man cm tall stocky with greying brown hair perfect teeth slightly aquiline nose These brutal and appalling crimes are an attack on law and order They are the diabolical fruit of the actions of groups of young agitators who preach violence as a means to an end and sow seeds of delirium

do think he was innocent but cant be sure see You cant be sure about it Yes have a doubt think it was an error a judicial error Judicial errors dont exist Youre a practising Catholic Pracising no Catholic nevertheless Sure like everyone else presume you go to mass from time to time Ever considered the issue of bread and wine turning into the body and blood of Christ Each time Each time the priest eats that bread and drinks that wine the mystery is fulfilled That must always happen It can never be otherwise The priest may be unworthy in thought or deed but simply due to the status he holds each time the mass is celebrated the mystery is fulfilled When a judge delivers the law he is exactly like a priest officiating at mass judge may have doubts he may question himself even torment himself but at the very moment he delivers judgement he cant harbour doubts At that moment justice is done Always One priest celebrating mass had blood on his hands Because he had doubts That has never happened to me No judgement has ever left blood on my hands No conviction has ever left blood on my gown Its obviously a question of faith dont think youve quite understood m not a Catholic Nor am a Christian However ve never had any of these weaknesses ve never believed in Voltaires Tratado sobre la tolerancia on tolerance and judicial error Virtue pity innocent victims of judicial errors What errors judge who can freely kill with his sentencesBa Voltaire was the first to sow doubt about the judicial system When a religion allows for peoples doubt that religion is dead Thats why we had Sartre Bertrand Russell Marcuse and the delirium of todays youth You mean Voltaire is to blame Yes But Voltaire had an excuse In his day they didnt realise the danger of those ideas but todays mass culture has made that danger mortal If things go on like this the only viable form of justice will be a form of punishment known in war as decimation The way punish is to kill one soldier in ten Today there are no more individuals Today there is no more individual responsibility Your job my dear friend has become ridiculous It was fine in peace time but now were at war Robberies kidnappings sabotage This is war And as in war the answer is decimation One two three four five Out One two three four five Cres convicted Cres has a calibre rifle and it is loaded with a bullet for you Keep

here proves my case Is this right Not that know of How amazing Did he expect to get any other answer know nothing about phone tapping It is done sometimes but always with prior judicial approval and only criminal suspects are tapped It is never done for political reasons Never That means m a criminal suspect because my phone is definately tapped In fact its not even my phone The phone belongs to my host Norcio Thereheres the great progressive writer No No Youre not my guest youre the guest of my wife d never take an arsehole like you into my house a provincial intellectual like you They brag on about permanent revolution You wish the inspector had come here to arrest you Then youd be a hero Wilfredo Dont be ridiculous Shut your mouth What a reactionary remark Shut your mouth Just because m your wife because youre my husband No Because youre a parrot not a woman Theres nothing can be done Youre a typical communist catholic bourgeois Yes for a long time not to keep up with the latest fashion Now that we are winning communists catholics the bourgeoisie youre all queueing up to jump on the bandwagon No my dear dont like it Including you and that arsehole who wanted revolution Hellohello ladies and gentlemen Mo more of these family quarrels Were here to enjoy ourselves to eat Champagne a whisky No thanks Have a drink Rogas Youre not on duty Your assignment here is over Come with me To them its a game game wouldnt say so Yes yes a game Including me m playing the game too m like a umpire delivering both protection and threats Dont let appearances fool you Rogas Despite the confidence theyre still scared More scared than theyve ever been When the partys over theyll flee in all directions No one will sleep in their beds tonight Who do they fear They think you coming here was part of a plot and your sudden appearance was planned My dear Rogas subversive groups like Calanos are useful to us And to our Communist Party friends Friends Your know what the situation is like My party which has run the country for years will be forced to rule with the Communists Your own job would be easier Rogas if Mr Amar that partys leader was in my chair This ministry would work Itd be fun to see Mr Amar and his party grappling with these groups Yes well And what should we do Continue harassing these groups as much as you can Arests controls searches but always with the approval of the judges Before theyre all killed If youre here to arrest Galano At least give us back our minister Hang around Rogas We will continue our conversation Hot coffee and cold milk Waiter a whisky Find out who they are and what they want from me How can Were always being watched If they find out m finished didnt tell you to do it inside Why not use your own lab You did it with the oil bosses Give me a cigarette Come on give me one Thanks Placing a bug under the commissioners arse m fucked And now Minister allow me to address a burning issue Ever since left the house of the president of the Supreme Court have the feeling that m being followed by professionals By people specifically suited to that task As if trained in a state or private police corps If people in high places deem it necessary to give me protection can only be grateful but should point out that such surveillance which is very expensive with so many officers involved would be better directed at protecting the judges Youll never get out of here unless you confess first And that goes for everbody To the Security Minister Its the tanks Their motors run all night The meetings at the armoured division barracks Listen this is him Take it easier with those judges Rewind Rewind Play it again Those judges Take it easier with those judges Rogas is on our back Hes smelt a rat Come on once more Those judges Take it easier with those judges Rogas is on our back Hes smelt a rat Is that it Isnt that enough Is that you Rogas Yes good evening doctor Why did you visit Riches To warn him hes in danger So youre still insisting in chasing your lunatic The judge will be killed whether its by my lunatic or your group The judge is well protected know Today saw all the security forces at Riches even spotted your car Its a plot The chemist Cres killed his judges and now they keep killing the others We come across so many plots they prepare one a day Weve managed to keep them in check so far But this time youve got to do something fast We must wait We cant risk everything by behaving rashly You dont understand m not saying you preempt their counterrevolution but just inform parliament or the press We cant alarm everyone because you have certain impressions What impressions have proof Theyre all implicated If thats the case its no use discussing it any further You must see Amar Only the party secretary can decide Amar is like all the others In a room of the National Gallery a groupe of visitors discovered two bodies The police have now identified the victims Mr Amar the secretary of the Communist Party and police inspector Amerigo Rogas Both victims were probably shot with the same weapon a gun which Inspector Rogas was still holding in his hand Heres the chief of polices interpretation Inspector Rogas had just return from a very stressful mission to find the judges killer When he returned to the capital he showed signs of mental imbalance As a result he was placed on leave He was seeing plots everywhere and started looking for nonexistent evidence Perhaps he thought even the secretary of the Communist Party was part of some imaginary plot He killed him and then turned the gun on himself So it seems weve accepted their version Everything points to him being the killer dont believe it knew Rogas well He was no lunatic There was a plot They felt so confident they went all the way And now they have invented the ultimate provocation police inspector kills the party secretary Even if thats so what do you want civil war confrontation No But we wont be accomplices Incite the people in the square This is what they want So people will never know the truth Truth is not always revolutionary
