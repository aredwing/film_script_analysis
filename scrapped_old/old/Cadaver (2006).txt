 

                        Kids these day are always late for school. While, we leave for school before sunrise. I have warmed up some food... It's on the table. Anybody upstairs? Yes, a lady came here last night. She's about 20 years old... What does she do? I didn't get that much detail from her. She seemed to be working nearby. I have to go... How much? 20 Baht. To prevent decompose, we inject the cadaver... with Formalin, Phenol... or carbolic acid... During autopsy, these compositions... prevents the cadaver from decomposing... Inject the mixture into the leg's aorta then soak the cadaver into the Formalin... This will harden both the cells and cadaver. ...we can do autopsy after 8 to 12 months. Who would donate a cadaver for experiment? Never mind... Think about it... Ok, let's continue from here. This is different parts of the human's bones. And this forms the shape of a human... This is the brain which we have discussed. This is the skull, it's... the command centre of all nervous systems. Class, don't forget... donating cadaver for scientific experiment... benefits both the donor and researcher. In medical science, we believe in... donating body to someone you don't know... is an act of charity and saving lives... It's the greatest sacrifice we can do. We believed in every cadaver before death... would do their best to do a good deed, without in the least expecting repayment, or any rewards in return. It's just for the sake of sacrificing. Mai, think about it in another way... Are you still afraid? Students learn this every year... and every year there's students possessed. They have never told you before... ...Thep... Shut Up! You will understand... Worst! Was the nightmare I had this morning. Everyone, please look at the notice board. To see which group you're in... which cadaver has been assigned to you... which work desk you're given to. Mai, we're at work desk 10. The smell of Formalin is a little strong, If you can't take it, go to your work desk... and put on your mask. This is a female's cadaver. Her name is Dawan. When performing autopsy... Two students of each team will do dissection. The other two will refer to the text book... to appraise each organ... The bigger group students at combined desk... will research on 2 different sexes' cadaver. You will take turn to examine the cadavers to know their difference, you'll learn more. This is Professor Prakit. He's in charge of this curriculum, and share his knowledge with you Professor Prakit and I will take turn. This is his last semester with us He'll be consultant of Kongdon Institute next year Today, you'll learn the basic of autopsy. We're not going to dissect the cadaver yet. Instead, all of you will... take time to get used to the environment... and the cadaver. Ok, try touching the cadaver with your hand. Come on, try it... Come, touch it... What are you doing? Cover the cadaver if you're afraid. ...Mai? Why did you uncover the face? We're not allowed to do that. Oh, you're awake... You have fainted in the lab... Professor felt that you're pale, and wants you to rest for a while. Are you feeling any better? Just now... While I was in the lab... I... This is your first contact with a cadaver This happens every year, you'll get used. Your friend wants to see you... But I have asked them to go home. Come, have some water... Stay here and rest for a while... I'm going to get something. If you're not well, I shall send you home. What happened? Mai, what happened? I think I should send you home. No... No need... Hello? Hello, Jen! I am Mai... ...Mai? Are you alright? Professor had dismissed us earlier. He told us he will send you home. I felt like... When I was looking at the cadaver... I felt... the presence of the ghost... The cadaver's soul? I don't know. It's probably... I'd uncover her face without her permission It's just your imagination. The rest of them had not seen it. Are you unwell? You have fainted just now. Mai, I'm busy with something... I'm hanging up now, I'll call you tonight. Ok... My nephew is unwell. His father called me and... wants me to take care of him for a few days I shall leave this place under your care. The new tenant is called Noi. Please keep the house clean. Noi leaves for work vey early... and return home late. She has no time for house chores. So please settle all these when we're not in. Who's there? Noi, is that you? Mai... ...Mai I called you last night, but no one answered I must have fallen asleep. Is there anything wrong? Are you still upset over yesterday? There's nothing wrong. I just felt a little weird. What's so weird? Hey, Mai... are you feeling better? Last night... I smelled like Formalin. Yes, here too... While I was about to sleep... But we will get used to it. I hope so... By the way... last night, I watched a show about ghost. One was related to cadaver... Impossible! When one died... Their hands tight up to let the soul leave. But for those who donated the cadaver... was not tight up, as they're trapped here... The soul is trapped... That means? That means the soul of the cadaver... has never leaves the body... Stop your nonsense, Thep! What? It's true! No, it's not true... Everyone of them... has donated the cadaver for our research And, we have not done anything wrong... So, why would they want to hurt us? Enough, change a topic... It's kind of scary, isn't it? Change topic! We can see from this brain scan... On the vey of top of this part... This top part is called the cerebrum. Jen... If we dissect the head... we'll see... it's powder! What? Sawdust... see that! In the fold, is called the sulcus This is the lateral surface of the brain This is formed by the upper Cerebrum... ...and the lower part of Cerebrum. Cerebrum is divided into 2 parts... The right and the left part... This is the forebrain structure... ...with the under surface of Cerebrum... ...formed the Occipital. This is the visual processing center. This small part of the lower surface... ...is the Cerebellum. It coordinates movement, by sending nerve transmissions down motor nerve outputs. There's two group of nerves in the brain. We shall rest for 10 minutes... We'll begin dissection this afternoon. Mai, anything wrong? Has anything happened again? It's probably your imagination. Jen... is that real? Yesterday... When I fainted in the lab... at the clinic... and just now... Mai, calm down! If you had really seen a ghost... this might help. Probably we should stop here today. No, I'm ok. If you can't take it anymore... let me know. Ok... Everyone, check the apparatus in front of you. These apparatus... is for us to do dissection. There's many apparatus here... but the 4 main ones are... ...scalpel... forceps and probe... These are the apparatus we used to research the nervous systems... and the scalpel's razor blade... These're vey sharp blades, so be careful. Get familiar with the apparatus. Let's begin the dissection... and research part by part... We'll start from the thoracic cavity... lung and the heart... We check the stomach from here. It plays an important role in digestion. Gastric... Intestines... Next, we look at the arm's muscle. Leg's muscle... and the reproductive system. As for the brain... we'll leave to the last. We shall go through page by page. Ok, everyone... slowly pull aside the cover, expose only the chest... Firstly, we should understand... the most outer organs of a human... skin... Skin is the largest organs... It protects out internal organs. Mai, answer this... Besides the emotions transmissions... to our brain and body... what else gives us life? Soul? Mai, listen... Tell me... From all you have learnt... Where's the position of the soul? Look... It's in the brain. Soul is located here? How about here? Or on the top of the head? But, professor... Is there a text book about that... That writes where's the soul located? Has any professor taught you that? I had really seen those things. I don't think you're ready to be a doctor. Umm, doctor... Can I say something? Mai... We're all professionals... We know what the people out there believe in. Those simple beliefs... are all the same... What matters most is... you're here now. We're doctors... We're scientists... Similarly... if we want to come into here... we must leave this beliefs out there. We should only believe... in things that is reality in life. I shall try... Cadaver is only a shell... all the cells are dead... all the nerves has stopped working... just regard the cadaver in front of you as... an organism... provided by the nature for your experiment. Ok, I understand now... You have to calm yourself down... and accept these things. Even the slightest fear you have shown... you will affect those of your age... to be afraid... In the past, there are some students... who can't pass this curriculum. The university... has to ask them to major in other subjects Mai... I don't want this to happen to you. I've seen her profile... She's the perfect student... She's vey hardworking... with vey good results... Some students need more time than others, to get used to these curriculum. Can I initiate to tell the committee... to let me take care of this student for now? Don't worry, Mai... This happens almost every year. The situation will get better. If anything that makes you feel uneasy... you can call me. You have not thank me. Are you still using the same number? You can send me till here... I'll continue the remaining of the journey. Noi, is that you? Where's the soul located? You've probably know it. How about here? Or on the top of the head? Help!!! Room for rent... You're a student, I like... If all are female students, that will be good The house will be vey clean. The landlord likes this house. He doesn't like too many people. You go upstairs and take a look. Hello, I'm calling to ask about the room... Any room for rent? Oh, yes... yes... Are you the landlord? No... The landlord is out of town. I'm the manager. I'm free this evening. - Can I come over and take a look? - Of course Great, we shall meet in another half an hour. Ok, but make it fast. Many people had come to view today. So, there's possibility to rent to them. That's the landlord's daughter's room. I have not clean it up. But if you like this room... I'll talk to the landlord. Can I take a look? Sure, let me unlock it. So, do you like it? If you like... You must call me 3 days in advance. I'll clean up the room for you. Ok... If you're sharing with some friends... The rent is not expensive. Is the landlord's daughter... also staying in the overseas? Oh, she's studying in Bangkok. But she had an argument with her parents... I've not heard from her for one year. Without uttering a sound, she has disappeared without a trace. Her things are still there. I have not clean it up. How about her parents? They were here to look for her... I don't know what to tell them. They have called the police... and have checked with every hospitals... but still not a trace of her. Do you know her boyfriend? They're in the same school... But they major in different subject. Then... she wrote to one of the professors... she had left the city with her boyfriend. Tos, you have to leave... Sorry, Mai... You have another appointment? No! Look... I don't love you. Why? Why won't you love me? Bye, Mai. Tos! Mai? Mai? Mai? Mai? The slide shows a liver with cancer. This part is colored. The royal purple are the cancer cells. Let's look at the next slide. Can you wait? I'm vey busy... No, I want to talk now... You can't disturb me, just because... I have agreed to take care of you. I want to know about Ning. ...Ning? The girl who was in love with Tos. Someone said... you sent the letter to Ning's parents. Oh, I remembered, what is it then? I want to know the truth. That letter wrote... she had run away with her boyfriend. Don't lie to me... You know where is Tos. That was one year ago... Everyone has forgotten about it. That means... what's written in the letter is not true... Mai... You wrote the letter, didn't you? Mai, what do you want? It happened all because of you. Can't we revive this matter? Too late, Mai. No! There must be a way... Mai... It's not that you don't know... No matter what happened... What I have done, I did it for you. Mai... Can we go back to where we used to be? ...Can we? Please! Please! He fell down himself or you pushed him? Please help me... That was an accident... Please! Please! Tos, will you forgive me? That was an accident... Please forgive me. Hello? I am Mai... Yes, Mai? I'm taking Tos and Ning's cadaver to the temple. Mai, don't worry. Listen... You don't know my situation. They have been pestering me. Oh, is that so? They must have something to ask from you? They've been dead for a year, why now? I don't know. But I must think of a way. Mai, this has happened a long time ago. Please don't reveal this matter... Don't believe in souls. I think you've over reacted... You don't understand... This has really happened on me... I want to arrange for a burial ceremony. Don't do this, Mai... Remember, it happened because I was helping you If you revealed this, we will be arrested. If we had accepted her a year ago, she would have been sent to study. Your sister probably would not be here. Can you check... where was she sent to? How're you related with Miss Priyathida? I'm her sister... If you're her sister, why aren't you sure... if your sister has stayed here? I've checked the registration book... I didn't see your sister's name. She was probably sent here last year... yes... This is last year's registration book. If this is so, she should be here. Can I take a look? Tell me frankly... What do you want to know? Miss Monrudee, have you found the documents? I'll send the documents over later. Oh? I've left the documents here. This is part of it... This is also part of it... Hey, stop her... This document is not right... Let me take a look at this document. Sure... Is there a name like this? Which one? What have you guessed? We'll wait for a while more. What's happening? Her, what are you doing? Sorry! Was that Ning on work desk 10? Mai, I told you to stay out of this. But Ning has not forgotten it... Someone wants to end this matter. I want to reveal the truth. Mai... I thought you truly care for me? I remember... I've put under Professor Prakit's guidance... But I must tell you. Professor Prakit is involved too... Didn't he take good care of you? Ok... This is something related to a student... She left the school last year... then had suddenly disappeared without a trace I remembered left under normal circumstances But the truth is... That's the truth. Our evidence can proof the truth... We have these signatures. The university has been notified. Do you have something to tell me? Professor, what do you mean? Let's put it this way... The thing that you want to tell me... I don't want to know... So is the university. Listen... I'd rather forget about last year's... As for you... If you want a normal, happy life... you'd better forget this matter. Is this what you want to say? What's happening? You're Noi? Yes... I've just returned from work. I heard some loud knocking. I want to know what happened. The lady landlord mentioned before... you're a medical student, right? Yes... Then you must be studying vey hard. I see your friend studying with you everyday. What? I realised you're awake every night. When I left work in the morning... your light are still on... I can see both of you still studying. Hello... Do you still remember me? I'm Swai... Professor Prakit is dead. He's been hit by a car. I thought it would happen on me. I didn't expect it to happen on Prof Prakit So, are you alright? I could still remember it... like it only happened yesterday. Please help me... That was an accident... Did you see what happened? Lf, that day... I had been stronger... I would not agree to it. However, I had done... And so I have do it secretly... I put his cadaver into the preserved case... together with other cadaver... This is too simple... No one ever thought to check on the cadaver. No one wants to involve in cadavers' matter Till today, Tos is still in the preserved box Next week, I'll send him to Chiang Mai Medical School What about that girl? I don't Tos... have told her... But she found the lead and look for Prof Prakit Prof Prakit was worried the truth being known, and decided to donate the cadaver. But it wasn't intentionally... And that has provoked the souls. Any solutions? Only one... Move the cadaver out of the case... and tie up their hands... and perform ceremony one by one for their souls to go to heaven. They will then not return to haunt us. That's my thought... Aren't you afraid? Come in... come in! This way... Then... Where's Tos? I think it's case 14. But first, help me with this. I realised that girl... Did you see that trolley? It's there, help me... Pull her up and lock up. I'll find the boy's cadaver. Swai... Why didn't you listen to me? It's all for you... Why was it only you can escape being convicted murder? Stop running, Mai! Please, don't be like this... Faster, you idiot! You think you're smart? It's time you get together with Tos! ...Professor? Help me, fool! Donating your cadaver for medical study... and benefit both donor and researcher. In medical science, we believe in... donating body to someone you don't know... is an act of charity and saving lives... It's the greatest sacrifice we can do. We believed in every cadaver before death... would do their best to do a good deed, without in the least expecting repayment, or any rewards in return. It's just for the sake of sacrificing.
