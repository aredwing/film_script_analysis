white horse that one Sunday started out happy He went with the intention of reaching the north having left Guadalajara His noble rider took off the rein he took off the saddle and went bareback crossed like a flash lands of Nayarit between green hills and the blue of the sky At a much slower pace they arrived at Esquinapa and through Culiacn already walked haltingly they say that in Mochis already he was falling that he had his whole muzzle bleeding But they watched him pass through Sonora and the Yaqui Valley gave him its tenderness they say that he limped on his left leg and despite everything continued his adventure He arrived in Hermosillo continued to Caborca and through Mexicali felt like he was dying came up step by step through the Rumorosa arriving in Tijuana with the light of the day Having completed his feat he left for Rosarito and didnt want to lie down until seeing Ensenada and this was the ballad of the white horse that left one Sunday from Guadalajara Ocotln
