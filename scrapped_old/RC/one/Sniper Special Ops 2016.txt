street from the hotel Looks to me like it was a real intense closequarter battle They lost Then we headed over to the hotel They had the congressman strung up there like a damn worm on a hook and we took the bait Then what Request to speak freely Shoot How in the hell does a nonmilitary observer like the congressman get authorization to go on some sightseeing tour in Matubahk and then fall into a damn ambush that is so perfectly laid out that not one of the team members of the personal security detail survives or radios for help Dont smell right sir dont have a good answer for you Sergeant Mosby What about the congressman Why was he spared Who the hell knows Maybe they were planning to stage some Internet extravaganza with him or trade him for something they want Hell they only had him for a day Maybe they didnt have any plan at all Maybe All right sir look as far Chandler and Cannon go If youre talking about going back into Matubahk today negative Why Those are my men sir Because m short of people and ammunition Heres the deal Mosby Renegade got hit hard last night and theyre still under pressure All available air assets have been committed to that fight In the meantime get word a major Taliban force is headed in our direction If thats the case dont have the people and dont have the ammo to stage an effective defense So am not authorizing anything outside the wire until we

skivvies and playing horseshoes Hmm have to ride along on a mission see feel your pain But that is not my call Now maam if you will excuse me ve got some skivvies to wash Its funny My girl back home

Star out of this when its all over and youll have all the girlfriends you want Yeah right Sergeant Jackson wants to see you He send you to look for me Thats the memo Damn Stand by Never waste a good cigar Colonel Gents we got an update on what happened to our resupply This is Bashir Hes a terp from Renegade Seems Bashir and a specialist by the name of Tyler were on one of the supply trucks Escort hits an ambush followed by a ground attack Bashir and Tyler take off crosscountry in the truck They reach a point about eight clicks from here Truck breaks down Bashir dismounted walked the rest of the way in to bring us the information Whats the current status Well Specialist Tyler seems to think that its a relatively minor mechanical problem something like a broken fuel line Hes standing security there but he cant call for help No radio in the truck Well from Renegade should be handling that Yeah and maybe they haul his truck back to Renegade We need that fuel and ammo more than they do right now So want you to get out there find that truck help Tyler get it fixed and roll it back here Take Vasquez take Jennings Bashir will show you the way Any questions got one sir Yeah What about Abdul Azim Abad What about him Hes on our top ten hit list of bad guys and hes operating in that How do you know that Folks talk in their sleep sir Look you might as well know When Congressman Cooper came up here he had an agenda The whole idea was to prove that all our efforts are just a big waste of time and money He insisted on visiting an isolated or abandoned village and we only had one of those in our Matubahk Yeah Now you get out there and find that truck Yes sir Vic If you cant get that truck rolling pull what cargo you can and blow the rest in place We got very little time
