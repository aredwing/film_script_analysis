Shes um Well shes something a little strange Thats what you notice that shes not a woman like all the others She seems all wrapped up in herself Lost in a world she carries deep inside her but surrounded by a world of luxury sumptuous boudoir Her bed all quilted satin Chiffon drapes From her window you can see the Eiffel Tower Suddenly her maid brings in a giftwrapped box token from an admirer Shes a cabaret star of the highest rank She opens the box Its a diamond bracelet But she sends it back Men are really at her feet Shes known a few But not the one shes been waiting for all her life real man Her maid has prepared her a foam bath The star takes a towel and wraps it around her hair like a turban Her fingernails painted a rosy peach she unfastens her taffeta nightgown and lets it slide smoothly down her thighs to the tile floor Her skin glistens Her petite ankle slips into the perfumed water Then her sensuous legs until finally her whole body is caressed with foam told you No erotic descriptions Whatever but shes a ravishing woman Do you know what mean mean the most ravishing woman in the world Yeah sure She really is Perfect figure Classical features But with these big green eyes Theyre black m the one who saw the movie but if thats what you want big black eyes Kind eyes Tender eyes But beware They can see everything Theres nothing you can hide from them No matter how lonely she may be she keeps men at a distance Shes probably got bad breath or something If youre going to crack jokes about a film that happen to be fond of theres no reason to go on All right all right go ahead Suddenly were in Paris Troops are marching right underneath the Arc de Triomphe Really handsome soldiers and the French girls are applauding as they pass by Then we are on this typical Parisian back street Dead end sort of sort of looking up a hill and these really weirdlooking Frenchmen not the typical ones with the berets are unloading a truck Its wartime of course and the boxes contain contraband delicacies like canned meat the best cheeses mm peaches in syrup Dont talk about food Not to mention the hams and the pats m serious No food and no naked women You still feeling

beautiful Now suddenly this military convoy rushes forward Marvelous German soldiers catch those weird smugglers in the act and arrest them all But watching nearby is this small truck With these two French thugs from the Resistance who are spying on the Germans This hulking clubfoot and his halfdeaf flunky Wait a minute Those weird guys the Germans arrested Yes What do you mean they didnt look

waiting in the moonlight behind the cabaret is Werners limousine Werners eyes are locked on the backstage exit La sortie des artistes He signals his chauffeur to open the door for her Maybe because Leni sees a chance to help Michelle or maybe because Leni wants to know what kind of man is hidden inside this enemy invader she decides to join him for the evening Madame To a great artiste Michelle hurries to meet her secret love But dark forces have already decided the fate of this sweet girl this girl from the French Resistance in love with a German lieutenant Her time is up What Because

without a chance of parole for a period of not less than eight years Poor Mama Her eyes filled with tears as if someone had died life full of humiliation and then the humiliation of a son steeped in vice but she never gave me that black look Her heart broken by too much suffering too much forgiving Because of me she could die If he ever says one unkind word about her ll strangle the son of a

glass across the room and says refuse to love a man who is the butcher of my country Oh my love Come with me and you will understand Werner takes her to this government archive filled with photos and documents about famine throughout the world He shows her how the elite create false shortages to enslave the masses Leni is deeply moved and begins to see things through Werners eyes From that moment on Leni understood Werners mission to liberate humanity from injustice and domination As they leave the baroque archive Leni feels the anguish in her heart being transformed back to her previous admiration but this time with the depth of a love reborn Oh my love How could ever have doubted you She begs him to forgive her and promises to help ensnare his enemies She arranges this secret meeting with the head of the Resistance by telling him that she will give the map Remember the map Only to him believe this is what you want Yes Well done So often was tempted to steal it from him myself but some things are best done by a woman a woman who betrays the man she loves And there is something else have wanted almost as much as the map What You know very well Hmm ve prepared a lavish banquet for two m not hungry am for you Aah Leni Werner hears her sing She sings like never before She sings of her eternal love for him and begs him not to cry because her sacrifice was not in vain
