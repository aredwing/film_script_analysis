been sterilized couldve left you there but didnt Dont you understand For once did the right thing When came back you knew me You were sitting by the door You looked up and you reached for me It was as if youd been waiting for me all along was always waiting for you Thats the constant in my life Waiting for you Will you come back Will you forget that you tied me up in front of a store or left me on a bus Are you still waiting No stopped when Claire showed me what it felt like to be loved What did you think That would amuse you Thats what babies are like Mother Did you think wed talk about Joseph Brodsky thought Klaus and would live happily ever after Adam and Eve in a vinecovered shack was crazy You were in love with him was all right was in love with him baby makes three and all that crap Then why did you leave him Why did you leave him didnt leave him He left me You wanna know about your father He left us when you were six months old for another woman never saw him again until he came looking for you when you were He came to see me Yes he did But it was too late Why should let him see you after what he did to me It wasnt about you It was about me and wanted to see him My whole life ve wanted to see him That decision was mine not yours Everythings always been about you never about me knew you were gonna kill Barry but you didnt even care You didnt give a damn about what that would do to me ll say whatever Susan wants but gotta go You dont just walk away from me made you m in your blood You dont go anywhere until let you go Then let me go You look at me and you dont like what you see But this is the price Mother The price of belonging to you If could d take it all back would Then tell me you dont want me to testify Tell me you dont want me like this Tell me you would sacrifice the rest of your life to have me back the way was Listen forget it deals a deal Lets just leave it at that Excuse me Its probably a waste of time but m looking for someone who used to come here His names Paul Trout You Astrid Yeah He said youd turn up Thanks Whats going on dont know Excuse me Is it a recess No Jurys out Dont you need me to testify Your mother told me to leave you alone What happened She let me go Two years after Paul and moved to New York received a letter from my mother In it was the Los Angeles Times Magazine my mother on the cover Santa Monica gallery had mounted a showing of her work The Times included seven pages of her hauntingly distant prison collages She stares out from the cover the bars of her cell behind her Beautiful Dangerous Proud The Times said she was close to winning a retrial after a first failed appeal They called her show a triumph Its too much to imagine her tempering her joy with a moment of grief a moment for what that triumph had cost These suitcases are a map of that country a terrible country will never revisit Even so find myself thinking of her wanting to feel that wind Its a secret wanting like a song cant stop humming or loving someone you can never have No matter how much shes damaged me no matter how flawed she is know my mother loves me
