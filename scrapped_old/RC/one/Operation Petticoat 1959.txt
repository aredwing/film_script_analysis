Sherman Hes the boss of Submarines Pacific He was the first captain of this boat Yes know that Then you should be able to figure out what he is doing here If you were the first skipper of the Sea Tiger and you ordered her sent to the junkyard at nine what would you be doing at six December Moored starboard side to Machina Wharf Cavite Navy Yard Philippine Islands for provisions and fuel

Tiger could be put back in commission functioning Navy yard might do it Sir My chiefs are pretty good hands They know theyre on their own and what were up against But we think we can get Sea Tiger back in the war Yes on whos side Were due to evacuate back to Bataan on the th two weeks to do a job a yard couldnt do in two months We dont think we can get her into fighting trim right away repair it just enough to reach the nearest sub tender That would be the Bushnell in Darwin almost two thousand miles of ocean with the Japanese Navy roaming over it And youre going to make it in a sub held together with spit and bailing wire Sir the Sea Tiger deserves a better epitaph than commissioned sunk Engagements none Shots fired none You cant let her go that way its like a beautiful woman dying
