This a story of tomorrow or the day after tomorrow when men have built a station in space constructed in the form of a great wheel and set a thousand miles out from the Earth fixed by gravity and turning about the world every two hours serving a double purpose An observation post in the heavens and a place where a spaceship can be assembled and then launched to explore other planets and the vast universe itself in the last and greatest adventure of mankind a plunge toward the conquest of space Rocket coming up sir Its the transport right on schedule eh captain No sir theyre Iate a minute and seconds Its a minute and seconds captain Its not important of course but it could be In celestial navigation one second can be the difference between Iife and death Gee hope they dont forget to bring up the ice cream this time thought issued an order to the effect that food was never to be a subject of conversation on the Wheel m sorry sir forgot There are some men aboard who are not permitted to enjoy the food that you eat corporal And unless youre anxious to share their diet d advise you not to forget again wont sir The moon Barney few days a month and we be on it Do you realize

hives hallucination headache Ioss of speech paralysis total insanity anything of us up here suffer from the same disease to some degree It is to be expected Man has never before Iived in space Fortunately most of the cases are so minor they present no problem But Cooper Cooper will be perfectly normal as soon as you return him to Earth That bad What he experienced was simply a warning If it happens again it could be permanent see How about the others Andre Imoto excellent As for Siegle Sanella and Donkersgoed every day with them it is a new set of horrible afflictions Some of them completely unknown to medical science Furthermore they all seem to have an absolute Ioathing for the Wheel its commanding officer its doctor and the Space Corps in general Everythingwith the possible exception of good food and women In other words theyre normal Thank you very much major Whats the matter sir are you ill No No m all right Carry on My Rosie Thank heaven science aint found no way to put you up in capsules The future Mrs Siegle Pedro Howd you Iike to paddle that around in your gondola For a wife too skinny Too skinny Thats beautiful skin boy Andre what did they say m not out am

Tests Iectures Watched every second Never any Ieave You fellows know how How tough its been Now just because had a bad couple of minutes out there Thats funny didnt think to have a bad couple of

heaven they sent you How are you boy bit rocky but all right otherwise And you Sam Oh fit as a fiddle Its against regulations to feel any other way on the Wheel My own orders Come on sit down Thanks will didnt know until a half hour ago that they were sending you up You remember my son Barney dont you Dr Fenton helped to plan every detail of this Wheel Barney They thought we were insane then didnt they George Well frankly thought so too but here it is You put it up here You know for once the International Authority has really sent up somebody who knows what its all about And since you are one of the geniuses responsible for thatmonstrosity would you mind telling me what it is We assembled this thing piece by piece as it came up according to your brilliant specifications Its a masterpiece of technology and electronics But it doesnt make one particle of sense In just what way do you mean Well here Take these wings for instance What in blazes are wings doing on this ship Theres no atmosphere on the moon The moon And this booster that power What are we gonna do go up to the moon or going through it Or maybe were supposed to tow it back with us so those bright boys from every nation on Earth can have a better Iook at it Is that the idea Working for one government was bad enough but now weve got all of them on our backs think youd better read your orders general General Your promotion is among these dispatches Congratulations sir general Your orders Sam And for you captain your transfer You be attached to Muroc believe as you requested You can return with me if you Iike Mars Mars sir George this is fantastic No more so than going to the moon Mars isnt the moon Theres a slight difference of several million miles Not one word No warning Justtake off and Ieave Its just across the solar system tell you were not ready George Why wasnt consulted We only reached the decision yesterday There was some discussion about your age and well General Cronin convinced the Authority And who convinced Cronin You Iong time ago the Supreme Council issued an order that the final objective of this project was to be the planet Mars You were present at all those discussions The moon was never anything more than just a test hop Now the orders are to eliminate the test and proceed with the original plan Time makes it imperative Theres only one man who can take that ship to another planet and bring it back the man who built the Wheel To gamble the Iives of a crew of men on as senseless a mission as this is callous Its stupid Stupid or callous it may seem to be at this time It is not senseless Mans very survival on Earth depends upon the success of this or some future search for a new source of raw materials General Samuel Merritt very imposing title for a tombstone The orders are naturally contingent to your acceptance general You can refuse When do we Ieave Youre going ve never refused to obey an order captain never have either sir until now When do we Ieave Our previous orders were to Ieave the Wheel proceed to the moon orbit for observation make a Ianding and return to base These orders have now been cancelled Were not going to the moon Mr Fenton has brought us a new directive Our time of departure will be tomorrow morning Our destination the planet Mars Now that time of departure both for the outer trip from the Wheel to Mars and for the return from Mars to the Wheel is most important We must arrive at the Martian orbit at the exact time when it is occupied by the planet Obviously the same precision of timing applies for our return Now you five men have been chosen after intensive competitive examinations For the past year you have been receiving special training and instruction for travel into outer space The ship however can accommodate only two officers and three crew men have been assigned as commanding officer other service on this trip will be voluntary Since Captain Merritt has already volunteered there are only three berths Ieft open Two of you then are going to be disappointed can take it sir Before ask for volunteers should Iike to state my own preferences Youre all fine men Final selection will be made on the basis of special qualifications Sergeant Siegle Yes sir dont think theres a man on the Wheel with Iess formal education than you possess Yes sir m sure ignorant sir Nor one with a better knowledge of advanced electronics should Iike to have you along Sergeant Imoto youre a graduate of Osaka University with two years of postgraduate work at the Colorado School of Mines That knowledge is valuable Sergeant Fodor two years of medicine in Vienna right Youre both needed Before any of you accept should Iike to make it unmistakably clear that the dangers of this journey are above and beyond anything that the Space Corps or your own governments have any right to ask of you can give you confounded Iittle reason for this attempt to reach Mars and no assurance at all that it will even be successful Its my personal conviction that no one but an idiot would volunteer And shall strongly suspect the sanity of anyone who does right Weve all got it straight Who wants to go Is it permitted to disagree with the general sir Of course sergeant In my humble opinion sir there is an excellent reason for this voyage Well suppose you tell us about it Some years ago my country chose to fight a terrible war It was bad do not defend it But there were reasons Somehow those reasons are never spoken of To the Western world at that time Japan was a fairybook nation Little people Iiving in a strange Iand of ricepaper houses People who had almost no furniture who sat on the floor and ate with chopsticks The quaint houses of rice paper sir they were made of paper because there was no other material available And the winters in Japan are as cold as they are in Boston And the chopsticks There was no metal for forks and knives and spoons where slivers of wood could suffice So it was with the Iittle people of Japan Iittle as am now Because for countless generations we have not been able to produce the food to make us bigger Japans yesterday will be the worlds tomorrow Too many people and too Iittle Iand That is why say sir there is urgent need for us to reach Mars to provide the resources the human race will need if they are to survive That is also why am most grateful to be found acceptable sir volunteer Thank you Sergeant Imoto Youre not a Iittle man Anyone else Look general sir you wouldnt want these helpless infants along on a mission Iike this Now a couple of tough old soldiers Iike ourselves Youre not going Mahoney m within me rights to demand a reason Youre years too old Too old am three months younger than you Sam Merritt and with twice the endurance Who was it carried you on his back for seven miles after the battle of Ioody Hill in when all the breath you had Ieft in you wasnt enough to blow out a candle in a Halloween pumpkin Now said no Mahoney Now you angled your way onto this Wheel against my specific orders and youre not gonna bull your way onto the Spaceship And if you say another word m gonna have you thrown into solitary for a month And tied to a wheelchair when you get out go sir Well sir Well d hate to see everybody eat with chopsticks so Check To you men our thanks for your patience and all your sacrifices The Earth rocket Ieaves in two hours Get packed huh Dismissed Speechmaker Chopstick Get down in front m mad about a sheik must have his embrace When hes near me Dear me ll tell him to his face Oh Ali Baba be my

we doing George Good general Youre getting a bigger push from Earth than we anticipated however Is our cotangential orbit correct Were computing it now Keep your radio open Well be in constant communication as long as possible Incidentally has d relay broadcasts for morale Your boys like to hear some mood music Thanks For this mood there is no music Stand by the radio Yes sir Sergeant Imoto

have no unnecessary floating aboard this ship No sir General Look Grab him Put him over there Mahoney Dont just stand there Get some water Yes sir Of all the stupid harebrained things to do Stowing away on a spaceship What a beating he must have taken during the blastoff Wake up you insubordinate Iunatic Thirty years in the Army and still too brainless to obey an order Wake up so can have you shot Hes coming to What are you doing aboard this ship You forgot your toothbrush dont remember you reading the Bible so often sir Its the one book you never really get through reading Mans every move his every thought his every action is in there somewhere recorded or predicted Every move except this one According to the Bible Man was created on the Earth Nothing is ever mentioned of his going to other planets Not one blessed word At the time the Bible was written it wouldnt have made much sense would it Does it now The Biblical Iimitations of Mans wanderings are set down as being the four corners of the Earth Not Mars or Jupiter or infinity The question is Barney what are we Explorers or invaders Invaders Of what sir Of the sacred domain of God his heavens To Man God gave the Earth Nothing else But this taking of Of other planets its almost Iike an act of blasphemy But why They belong to no one else We dont know that But Iook sir it couldnt be just an accident that at the very time when Mans resources on Earth are reaching an end Man develops the ability to Ieave his own world and seek replenishment on other planets The timing is what fascinates me Its too perfect to be accidental Those other planets might already be tenanted dont think so The universe was put here for Man to conquer dont know just dont know Why dont you try to get a Iittle sleep sir Huh Oh Yes think will Good night Barney Good night Father Topside viewers jammed Cant move it Sergeant Siegle Sergeant Fodor get out there and free that pickup Out sir But the ship is going miles an hour sir So are

hell This voyage is a cursed abomination If it were possible d come back now return the ship to Earth and blow it up General please Together with all plans in existence for building another Were committing Mans greatest sacrilege And we cant stop Professor the general isnt well Fatigue Hes been suffering from severe headaches and insomnia Hes very tired almost exhausted We Iost a crew member Andre Fodor struck by a meteor The general took it very hard m sure its only temporary He be all right dont worry Everything else is under control Hey you guys were in trouble Off our course No the general You ought to hear the blast he just threw at the Wheel Not just that Bible talk hes been spouting Iately Crazy stuff Things Iike blowing up the ship Things Iike that Gone Just Iike Cooper Listen you slimy Iittle calumniator If you were onetenth the man the general is youd be twice the man you are What he says or how he acts is not for you to criticize And if catch you doing it again

Beanstalk Be wonderful to try and see what could happen have some flower seed been carrying them ever since Ieft Hawaii was gonna try them on the moon but here in this soil Youd need a pipeline from the Colorado River to water them Captain Iook Must have damaged the pipes when we Ianded Wait here General stop As wax melteth before the fire so Iet the wicked perish at the presence of God Father

slight detail The Earth wouldnt be there when we arrived How very unpleasant So how Iong we gotta stick around this crummy planet How old are you Sergeant Siegle Just turned When you turn again you can start packing You and Sergeant Mahoney start draining the pipes of the heating system Well he says we gotta squeeze the water So Iets get to squeezing Its gonna be a cold dry winter God rest ye merry gentlemen Let nothing you dismay Remember Christ our Savior Was born on Christmas Day Call the Wheel again sergeant What for To wish them a merry Christmas Spaceship to Wheel Come in Wheel Over How Iong you gonna keep doing this We aint heard from the Wheel in months And supposing they answer so what Maybe we ask for room service and have them send up some ice water Weve done what no men in the world have done before us Weve got to Iet them know before its too Iate If its humanly possible weve got to report Report what That the operation was a big success but the patients are dying on a Iousy driedup ball in the corner pocket of nowhere We could report a murder captain ve told you everything that happened sergeant Yes captain that you have And you can tell it to me from now until doomsday but dont forget was there and saw everything with me own eyes Spaceship calling the Wheel Spaceship to Wheel Over The general wasnt crazy he was right We asked for it Theres a curse on this ship and everybody in it Baloney You can Ieave that stuff back on Earth but it dont operate past a thousandmile Iimit Only God can make a tree Where is it Wheres the trees and the flowers and the

anything unessential to the voyage Everything up there sir secure By this time tomorrow we be on our way home Just about finished captain think these soil and mineral samples will prove that Iife is possible on Mars It can be done sir the elements are in those sacks Even air and water in other forms Until now this Iittle planet has been alone friendless all drawn up into itself So its crusty driedup and unyielding But with patience and understanding and hard work it could be made to blossom wish had your faith Imoto Hey fellas Come Captain come Look Look Look It grew flower seed from Earth growing here Look at it flower on Mars It is a flower Hey captain the ship is tilted We wont be able to take off That sand Iook at it Its draining Must be caves or crevices underneath This whole section is honeycombed We drilled into a Iot of pockets Caves caverns If we could crack them open the sand would pour in Iike water We might draw off enough to Iower that side of the ship Straighten her up Its possible But how do we crack open the cavities With the engines We blast Hammer the ground with the rockets Great But what happens if we open some cracks on the wrong side We fall over Weve got exactly minutes to come up with a miracle and say goodbye to this planet or we never Ieave it You were saying sergeant m sold Punch it captain Again sir Its moving Its working Try it again captain Thats it dont dare to Were perpendicular Protect yourselves Were blasting off You did it date is a date sergeant It was a glorious way the general died Sacrificing his Iife as he did to bring his ship

Would you be caring for a cup of tea captain Thanks
