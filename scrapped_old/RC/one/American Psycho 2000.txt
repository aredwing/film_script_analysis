get for you two live in the American Gardens building on West st Street on the th floor My name is Patrick Bateman m years old believe in taking care of myself in a balanced diet in a rigorous exercise routine In the morning if my face is a little puffy ll put on an icepack while doing my stomach crunches can do a thousand now After remove the icepack use a deep pore cleanser lotion In the shower use a wateractivated gel cleanser Then a honeyalmond body scrub And on the face an exfoliating gel scrub Then apply an herb mint facial masque which leave on for ten minutes while prepare the rest of my routine always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older Then moisturizer then an antiaging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman Some kind of abstraction but there is no real me Only an entity something illusory And though can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and may be you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable simply am not there Good morning Good morning Hamilton Nice tan Late Aerobics

Paul You like Huey Lewis and the News Um theyre okay Theyre early work was a little too new wave for my taste But when Sports came out in think they really came into their own commercially and artistically The whole album has a clear crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost Hes been compared to Elvis Costello but think Huey has a far more bitter cynical sense of humor Hey Halberstram Yes Allen Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place Do you Do you have a dog little chow or something No Allen Is that a raincoat Yes it is In Huey released this Fore their most accomplished album think their undisputed masterpiece is Hip To Be Square The songs so catchy most people probably dont listen to the lyrics But they should because its not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends Its also a personal statement about the band itself Hey Paul Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now you fuckin stupid bastard You fucking bastard He was completely naked and standing up on the table He had no clothes on what so ever and he Patrick Patrick Is that you No Luis its not me Youre mistaken

Your address The American Gardens Building West st Street Nice Very nice Thanks What can you tell me about Paul Allen m at a loss He was part of that whole Yale thing Yale thing Yeah Yale thing What

anyone seen him in London Actually yes Hmm But ve had a hard time getting actual verification Stephen Hughes said he saw him at a restaurant there But checked it out and what happened is he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth for Paul so Had his apartment been burglarized No actually it hadnt Toiletries were missing a suit was gone so was some luggage Thats it mean no ones dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything right No not yet As said were not sure Basically no ones seen or heard anything So typical isnt it Its just strange One day someones walking around going to work alive and then Nothing People just disappear The earth just opens up and swallows them Eerie Really eerie Listen youll have to excuse me have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in minutes The Four Seasons

assure you it certainly wasnt cheap No No smoking Not in here Varda truffle dont want you to get drunk but thats a very fine chardonnay youre not drinking Do you like Phil Collins ve been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their album Duke Before that really didnt understand any of their work It was too artsy too intellectual It was on Duke where Phil Collins presence became more apparent think Invisible Touch is the groups undisputed masterpiece Its an epic meditation on intangibility At the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums Christie take off the robe Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks Collins and Rutherford You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument Sabrina remove your dress In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer songwriting this album hits a new peak of professionalism Sabrina why dont you uh dance a little Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion In this song Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the s about monogamy and commitment The song is extremely uplifting Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as uh anything ve heard in rock Christie get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole Phil Collins solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds Sabrina dont just stare at it Eat it also think that Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group than as a solo artist And stress the word artist This is Sussudio great great song personal favorite Look at the camera Christie look at the camera Dont touch the watch Can we go now Were not through yet If they have a good personality and they are not great looking then who fucking cares Lets just say hypothetically okay What if they have a good personality know know There are no girls with good personalities good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented though God knows what the fuck that means are ugly chicks Absolutely And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are Do you know what Ed Gein said about women Maitre d at Canal Bar No serial killer Wisconsin in the s And what did Ed say When see a pretty girl walking down the street think two things One part of me wants to take her out and talk to her be real nice and sweet and treat her right And what did the other part of him think What her head would look like on a stick Hi guys wanna get your opinion on something Its my business card decided to get a new one too Oh its Very nice Luis Thank you Listen what about dinner Is that all you ever have to contribute Van

barriers to cross All have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane the vicious and the evil all the mayhem have caused and my utter indifference toward it have now surpassed My pain is constant and sharp and do not hope for a better world for anyone In fact want my pain to be inflicted on others want no one to escape But even after admitting this there is no catharsis My punishment continues to elude me and gain no deeper knowledge of myself No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling This confession has meant nothing Word Come on
