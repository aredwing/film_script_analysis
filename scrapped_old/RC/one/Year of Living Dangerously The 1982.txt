normal intelligence capable of having normal children but whose body is a joke But the one great advantage of being a dwarf is that you can be wiser than other people and no one envies you Youre not a dwarf Thats what like about you Guy You dont care do you Or maybe you just dont see Want some tea Love some This picture of Sukarno Its me Its you Yeah dressed for the part Hes quite a hero of mine think hes a genius Hes really trying to do something for his people To them hes a god Thats the real Jakarta Scrounging for handfuls of rice to keep alive another day Thats a story you journos dont tell in your reports Nobody wants to hear it Tell them anyway Why dont you exhibit these dont care about the photographs care about the content m not very aesthetically minded That explains all those terrible shirts you get around in You like my puppets If you want to understand Java you have to understand the wajang the sacred shadow play The puppet master was a priest Thats why they call Sukarno the great puppet master balancing the left with the right Their shadows are souls and the screen is heaven You must watch their shadows not the puppets The right in constant struggle with the left The forces of light and darkness in endless balance In the West we want answers for everything Everything is right or wrong or good or bad But in the wajang no such final conclusions exist Look at Prince Arjuna Hes a hero But he can also be fickle and selfish Krishna says to him All is clouded by desire Arjuna as a fire by smoke as a mirror by dust Through these it blinds the soul Pretty good stuff
