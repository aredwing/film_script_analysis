approval Your son gave his consent to a new protocol He was trying out a new molecule that they withdrew after testing it on him They dont use human guinea pigs these days Oh yeah In Tuskegee Alabama the Health Service experimented with syphilis They left black men untreated and watched them grow sick Clinton was forced to apologize in When the media woke up in the s the labs moved their tests to the Third World They produce vaccines fig leaf One percent of their business What they produce is sickness Twice their budget goes on marketing Why Theyd rather prove youre sick than cure you This

Barbies trial The only way to drag Barbie into court was by sacrificing himself So did it work He went to La Paz did the interview He had Barbie right there But he didnt draw the gun Too much to lose guess life a family a job The culprits name Thats all need Its not enough name to start with How did you get Franks name From Pleynel the boss of Nextys swiped a printout ve had him in my sights His

the forests Theyre monsters They want us all to be sick Stop it William Diane Did you analyze those pills Hes here ll put him on have the results for your sons pills Theyre a placebo What Theyre medically inert Why would they give him that Can we discuss it face to face where Same place as before Right Keep walking Police Hold it Quick Run Come on Come on dont understand Why would William say its a placebo Because he knew the cops were onto him Because killed their buddy Not because of Hexalor Are you sure Absolutely sure The question is how do we use the time before they catch us didnt want this Fuck Listen We know Verneuil is in Davos We could grab her there Are you crazy Isnt this enough Arent we in enough shit Tum yourself in You thought the cop was a thug He may not be dead You did it for me Theyll be lenient But ask yourself first were they lenient with your son They kill kids in Africa every day Why not here Hang this up in your cell Come on Are you Youre hit Take it easy Where are you hit Calm down Youll be Breathe Breathe calmly Breathe calmly Youll be Breathe m Raoul Kraft Pleynels aggressor Frank Krafts father know what happened Talk May asked to see his file He was taking a placebo It wasnt to blame The police spun me that Its true All know is they chose your son for his migraines but then realized he was depressive They should have taken him off the protocol But now hes dead and youre saying it wasnt an accident It cant have been Not on that bend on that road Its impossible believe you Believe me too Our drug didnt do it You had him killed You dont believe it If your son wasnt the victim of a murder or a medicine or as you say an accident theres only one explanation Isnt there It must be very hard to face But deep down think you know We always know these things despite ourselves Most probably he took his own life m sincerely sorry Pleynels lab was in charge of the trials They shouldnt have picked your son He was too fragile They were vilely chasing profits Weve canceled their contract ll quite understand if you sue them We would willingly help you reach a settlement dont understand My son is dead and youre offering me money because you pretended to treat him Dont blame clinical trials They save countless lives In a faithless world we cant lose faith in medicine It would be agonizing Youre not a murderer But in a way you are In order to live rich long lives we let millions die Thats the only protocol Weve all signed it Including you Were on in two minutes Krafts in my room with a gun You here Why blame me The boy killed himself the dad went nuts m sorry but not guilty You are It could happen to anyone You were in charge Its a tougher battle than we expected but we fight on day after day to invent new drugs The launch of a new medicine the fruit of years of research Ten years of work intricate formulas costly research millions of dollars devoted to curing people Our modest contribution What does the Alternative collective think of Louise Verneuils murder Of course we cannot condone such acts but Kraft is not the true defendant here The true defendant is the drug industry and the way it works All the pandemics in the world are due to a lack of global healthcare Why Because the system is profit driven Will this trial change things hope so Recently after the World Health Organization conducted an inquiry in Sudan they stopped hosting clinical trials Its a step in the right direction Translation by Nigel Palmer
