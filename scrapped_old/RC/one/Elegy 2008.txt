Were not all descended from the Puritans No There was another colony Its not on the maps today Merrymount Ah right you mentioned in your book The colony where anything goes went There was booze There was booze fornication there was music They even you name it They even danced round the Maypole once a month wearing masks worshiping god knows what Whites and Indians together all going for broke Who was responsible for all of this character by the name of Thomas Morton Ah The Hugh Hefner of the Puritans You can say that will read you a quote of what the Puritans thought of Mortons followers Debauched aliens and atheists falling into great licentiousness and leading degenerate lives When heard that packed my bags left Oxford came straight to America America the licentious So what happened to all of those people The Puritans shut them down they sent in Miles Standish Leading the militia who chopped down the Maypole cut down those coloured ribbons Banners everything The party was over And we became a nation of straitlaced Puritans Well Isnt that your point though The Puritans won They stamped out all things sexual How would you say Sexual happiness Exactly Until the s Until the s where it all exploded again all over the place Right everyone was dancing around the Maypole then make love not war If you remember only a decade earlier If you wanted to have sex if you wanted to make love in the s You had to beg for it you had to cop a feel Or get married As did in the s Any regrets Plenty But thats my secret Dont tell anybody Thats just between you and me think it was Bette Davis who said Old age is not for sissies But it was Tolstoy who said that the biggest surprise in a mans life is old age Old age sneaks up on you and the next thing you know youre asking yourself m asking myself Why cant an old man act his real age How is it possible for me to still be involved in the carnal aspects of the human comedy Because in my head nothing has changed Her name was Consuela Castillo and she was my student This course is called Practical Criticism So Lets go Right to the big question shall we Does War and Peace become a different book because we read it Yes of course But why Because we bring something to the book We bring ourselves Whats more if you read the book again in years it will change again because youve changed Beauty is in the eye of the beholder ve always been vulnerable to female beauty Ms Castillo was different her posture was perfect And she dressed like a young associate of a prestigious law firm There was a sophistication that set her apart She knows shes beautiful But shes not yet sure what to do with her beauty No dont take notes Because honestly its not worth it Really dont give it a thought work of art reminds you of who you are now

together All three of you Well when youre You do a lot of things just to feel secure and emotional Right Consuela My whole life was dedicated to independence and at some cost had achieved my goal Nevertheless it was in that moment That my terrible jealousy was born That is when realised that would never ever really possess her feel anxious unless speak to her on the phone every day and then feel anxious after weve spoken What are you wearing Where are you knew its only a matter of time before a young man found her and took her away knew Because was once that young man who would have done it Well at least does it makes you feel young Its like playing soccer with a bunch of year olds It doesnt make you feel because youre playing with huge difference every second of the game You have to leave her Your hands will always be tied by this girl Shes going to leave you sooner or later anyway So its always better to keep one step ahead Take her to a nice romantic spot tell her its over Thats what d do My parents talk about all these places they wanted to go to They have all the money to go wherever they want but leaving Cuba was their first and last trip dont want my life to be like that Let me take you places What the hell are you saying You brought her here to say goodbye Where would we go Europe We could go to Paris this summer or Rome or Madrid We can visit the Prado and see the real Velasquez the real Goya The Prado Do you mean it Of course meant it And we can finish our trip in Venice youll love Venice And you would ride a gondola with me Maybe Maybe Maybe may be your

my God Hello David its Consuela During the last two days ve been thinking a bit about us Have you Yes And what were you thinking That its all over What do you really want from me What do really want from you You spend you whole life going through relationships without ever really bonding with anyone So at least would like to know who am for you The fact that youre jealous and possessive doesnt help me at all Even little kids are jealous of their toys until they get tired of them and want new ones So is that how its going to be between us two Have you ever imagined a future with me future with you scares me It scares you Yes Why Because theres a odd year age difference between you and me and you have your whole life ahead of you Its just a matter of time before you realise it too didnt ask you what was going to do asked what you wanted to do with me When you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life spent my whole life jumping from one relationship to another because this made me believe that was never alone and that time was not passing ve always surmised for example that Lawrence when he was writing Lady Chatterleys Lover Who am for you she asked me one day was to afraid to ask who was for her How long could it have lasted Surprise Yes Let me wow Thank God for Carolyn Carolyn is my only point of contact with the selfconfident man used to be How was that play Which play The one you took George to Oh unremarkable just Here go Oh hit and run Just the way you like it Good thing dont have pets Only you Which one was Carlos Alonzo From high school What was his thing What did he want you to do He liked to watch me menstruate What He liked to watch me menstruate dont believe this The respectable CubanAmerican girl whose parents worship Ronald Reagan who enforce an oclock curfew on their daughter in summer time no less there she is in high school aged m so sorry That makes all the difference think youre being ridiculous How did you manage it David m really curious What do you do You find yourself having your period pick up a phone you ask him to come over Hey Carlos m starting And then he appears all Cuban and respectable And the pair of you retire to the bathroom where you have the ceremony of the pulling down of the tampon Yeah its just like you were there Just filling in the missing just filling in the blanks Which blanks Five Now were down to Because of the two guys who have to go sorry What is this What This Youre fucking other women had two husbands who fucked other women didnt like it then dont like it now least of all with you You have everything with me David Pure fucking No hidden agendas No icky entanglements How could you do this There arent many like me actually understand you am one in a million How could you possibly fuck dont know whose that is Why dont you put it on a bagel and eat it have a pretty good idea m sure you do You know my friend George Hearn the poet George uses tampons Since when No listen George has the keys to this apartment He gives poetry readings he meets girls He cant bring them home to his wife in New Rochelle And since hes always short on funds And since some of them are married George fucks all these women in your bed Not all some He uses the bed in the guest room His marriage isnt paradise Probably a bit like mine and he wasnt desperate enough to get out dont believe a fucking word youre saying Everything in your life is so meticulous Its so orderly dont know whose tampon this is You have to believe me Youre all m holding on to In this at least was telling the truth Of course the whole situation was ridiculous Do snore Yes Its worse What Well You drool Yes You drool on Not true You drool in your sleep Beautiful women are invisible Invisible What the hell does that mean Invisible They jump out at you beautiful woman stands out stands apart You cant miss her But we never actually see the person We see the beautiful shell Were blocked by the beauty barrier Look at you What What did you say Youre deaf Mr Kepesh No What Or maybe you do not want to hear Maybe thats the problem with you Yes Were so dazzled by the outside we never make it inside Do you always work in black and white Mainly like the theatricality Is that how you see the world In black and white No That distinction belongs to my son You always speak of him with such bitterness In my family that would be so strange Take a look Beautiful picture Beautiful woman Look my hands are huge want you so much David Your fridge is empty If we are staying in we have to go shopping Excuse me Professor but your Spanish is awful Then teach me Yeah ll teach you ll teach you maana Isnt that your poet friend Keep walking That woman is not his wife Thats right find that disgusting It isnt our business And thats the end of it Lets not discuss it here Are you with that With what For all you know hes just having a cup of coffee with a friend You know youre jumping to conclusions David being younger than you doesnt make me a child In any event its not our business You keep saying that but what do you think about it What think is that marriage is a problematic institution at best Which is why you married your wife Which is why dont cheat on her But you were married once Yes yes Yes Yes What do you want me to say was married It was a mistake Did you try Did you really try Where come from know where you come from the rules are different but theyre not Youre such a cynic m such a realist think youre just infantile m sure youre right hung in

with it Plenty Anyway Dana isnt one of your little starstruck students If you want my advice Lisa mustnt know a word of this until youve made up your mind Lisa already knows Why on earth did you tell Lisa You expect me to lie to my wife Now you cant retreat even if you want to God dont know why came here dont know what help you could possibly be Except maybe maybe hoped that you might relate to me

dont know when goodbye means goodbye And for this you owe me bigtime Now expect you to do this in the name of our friendship Now would you fuckin eat something The Poetry of George Hearn makes no apology for itself As Housman wrote in his celebrated essay dont know what poetry is but recognize it when hear it There can be no question that this evenings guest writes what we all instantly recognise as poetry Since the publication years ago of his first work in the New Yorker George Hearns vigorously masculine voice has become a fixture of the American poetic landscape Poetry which is one and the same time the language of the street potent urban and impatient But also the unselfcentered promptings of an unquiet heart In that unique combination of sensibilities earned George Hearn The Pulitzer Prize But rather than procrastinate further or damn him with praise he will inevitably consider feint turn the proceedings over to New Yorks own or should say Americas own George Hearn George ll call an ambulance Hi David He just woke up a little while ago Hi David George Its Kepesh m here George m here George owe you wonder who he thought was think he knew perfectly well Youre sweet took him as he was He so appreciated that He took me the same Youre going where just told you Florida To meet her parents just for the weekend The girls Her name is Dana Youre going to meet her folks Well think they should know m not just some kind of pervert Kenny youre nearly years old You dont need the approval of the parents of a girl who has three children of her own Does she want her parents approval If you want my approval fine youve got it just wanted you to understand This doesnt mean that dont love Lisa Kenny what are you doing Youre going to escape from one prison and race headlong into another maximum security facility Where did you get the idea that marriage is a prison From serving time It wasnt about your mom just wasnt cut out for it Is this your version of approval Kenny listen to me m the only father you have m the only one youll ever have What a comfort that is know disappointed you But youre not a child youve got to get past this rage If you ever

Hows everything Seattle is a great place to build a business m exhausted But love it Whatre you thinking about Dave Nothing We kept acting like teenagers all our life thats all Whos we Me and you Yes you and We spent our life chasing after what The only time you got pregnant you had an abortion because the time wasnt right That was years ago Did the right time ever come Not the right person Do you remember that tampon you found in my bathroom That thing belonged to a young girl was in love with What What kind of chance did we have She and None At best we could have dragged it out a couple of years but in the end shed have realized there was little room in her life for a man thirty odd years older than she Nothing ever should have happened between me and that girl It was just a mistake Youre getting old David The way men look at me changes every day There are women my age a lot of women who are on these dating websites Youre guaranteed a certain number of dates per year And you pay for the silence and the same conversation every time like them like that Is it possible that this is really the first time we talked to each other Well After years of sleeping together its not bad know a lot of people who never got that far in years of marriage What time is your flight ll take you No Why start now concentrated on my work kept asking myself if it was right not to go to that fucked up graduation party of hers It took two years but finally got past the death of George even accepted the loss of Consuela recovered my equilibrium and my independence Who am kidding The paintings and sculptures of the day would literally and figuratively absorb the energy They were almost a selfcontained slice of life if you will That you put beautifully in your opening chapter But also youre making a comment on the relationship between art and ownership Well thats exactly right The people who buy these paintings they think that they own the pictures But in reality the pictures own them The pictures own them theyre allowed to live theyre allowed to house them all Theyre really custodians for a period of time Theyre free to admire it theyre free to worship it if they like In theory you could purchase the Great Pyramid take your point But at the end of the day the pyramid will still be around and youll be With the Pharaohs My guest today is Susan Reese her novel is Blue

ever start to panic during the night or during the day or any time youll phone me What can do What can do Its Its like not being able to get into a a comfortable position because no matter which way
