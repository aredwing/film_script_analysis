the victims body prove you had sex with her within a halfhour of her death Otis claims you had a obsessive fixation on his wife And the murder weapon has your prints on it We played softball that afternoon Yes Meanwhile Otis says that your story about crossing back and forth during the night Etcetera is nonsense And says that immediately after dinner Around p he departed for Appalachia Lake leaving his wife behind Now thats a fivehour trip Luke Watkins of Watkins Fishing Lodge says Otis woke him at am for the keys Its a lie Now the time of death has been set between and am Now if Otiss story is true The closest he could have been to his wife at the time she was killed was somewhere in the middle of the Chattahoochee National Forest m telling you Its a lie If were you d consider some kind of plea Otherwise Unless we can break Eddys alibi you could be in deep Deep shit Kneel down Hands behind your head Please Okay Are they treating you okay Dont worry about me Hows Lori What do

your husband enter your room the night of the murder No No Of course not That was your story Richard thought that was something the papers made up You please You please think of some other defence

all of this want my name back want a divorce Lori is in hell Richard And cant save you both What this does is define the financial terms of the divorce to the satisfaction of the bondsman Along with your car and musical instruments this pays my initial fee and secures the bond Shes being very generous acting so fast Well You have hours to remove whatever personal effects you want from the house The rest will be sold at auction to pay for your defence And dont get into any trouble Oh Jesus Who the hell are you My name is David Duttonville m a private investigator Um m gonna sit down now You scared me Door was open used to live next door was just Yes know who you are thought you were still in the Uh made bail Great My company Duttonville Research its been hired by three insurance companies to investigate a total million double indemnity claim by Eddy Otis on his wife Kay Otis In fact We were hopin that you might be able to help us million Yes Thats the point It is rather a lot to take out on a wouldbe lounge singer who never earned a cent in her entire life However Theres no law against it She had a policy on him in the same amount Eddys explanation is that they loved each other so much he figured if either of them got killed theyd need a lot of compensation Its a funny attitude The world is a funny place So he went back in there and he beat her to death for money Just as simple as that Isnt that amazing even think he liked her Youre saying he killed Kay Otis Of course he killed her But what a setup The whole thing just so he could million checked his alibi Its gonna hold What about the people at the lodge wonder how much he paid them Me too But who is Eddy Whered he come from was hoping you knew He told me he was a financial advisor Great Now know m on this for a week Theres a limit to what one can do in a week need something solid You got anything Just what already told them The police know about the insurance suppose Theyre not interested think they feel comfortable with you Comfortable You know what mean They got a good case Look You got my card You think of anything you give me a call Oh And by the way in case youre interested when interviewed Otis he was with your spouse The grieving widower comforting the lonely wife m gonna get going Goodbye m Richard Parker Why are you doing this to me Who is it Call the police Get my gun then call the police ve lost my wife my child My home m facing a death sentence or life imprisonment Call the police How do you sleep at night Damn it Woman call the police Didnt he pay you enough to kill me
