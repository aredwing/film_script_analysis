This was my body On December lay in bed all day Whether was asleep or in a coma later became a subject of dispute When my breathing became obstructed Maria my husband Claus von Bulow finally did as my maid had been urging all day he summoned a physician Dr Paultees stopped breathing My heart stopped beating By this time was certainly in a deep coma from which awoke several hours later By the next morning was myself again Theres no reason for all this fuss never felt better in my whole life This first coma aroused suspicion and fear in the minds of my personal maid Maria my son Alex and my elder daughter Ala From this time on though they never voiced their suspicions to me they kept a vigilant eye on Claus year later just before Christmas their darkest fears seemed justified Has Mummy had breakfast yet No we havent seen her My husband did not want our daughter Cosima to see what he had found so he motioned to his stepson Alex Second coma My pulse was my temperature degrees Did you call an ambulance Nicholas ask Robert to open the main gates Were expecting an ambulance Send an ambulance immediately Keep her in something warm blanket or anything you can find All this activity was pointless Wed better do an never woke from this coma and never will am what doctors call persistent vegetative a vegetable According to medical experts could stay like this for a very long time braindead body better than ever Enter Robert Brillhoffer former Manhattan district attorney My two children from my first marriage Alex and Ala von Auersberg hired Brillhoffer to investigate the case He put a do not resuscitate order on her hospital chart They sent Alex and a private investigator back to my Newport cottage Clarendon Court to search for drugs They found plenty in Clauss closet On top of that the hospital lab reported that my blood insulin on admission was times normal a level almost surely caused by injection Insulin injection could readily cause coma or death This encrusted needle tested positive for insulin Alex couldnt wait to get back and show Brillhoffer Now they felt they had the murder weapon All they lacked was the motive At that moment my husband was vacationing with his mistress the very beautiful soapopera actress Alexandra Isles Oh God Mrs Isles a divorce was the daughter of an old friend Count Billy Botsky Brillhoffer also discovered that at my death Claus whose own net worth was only a million dollars stood to inherit million from me Alexandra later testified that Claus showed her a legal analysis of my will On the evidence collected by Alex Ala and their lawyer Brillhoffer my husband was accused of twice trying to murder me with injections of insulin On March he was found guilty on both counts committed on December Even Alexandra Isles testified against him Guilty As to count two charged the defendant committed on December a crime of assault with intent to murder How do you find Guilty You are about to see how Claus von Bulow sought to reverse or escape from that jurys verdict You tell me And two Here it comes Here we go taking you downtown And Dersh Take it in Foul here go Watch the hands Watch the hands Yeah hello What Oh shit Bottom line Aw shit Hi Lets try that again Hi Dad Remember Maggie Hi Maggie Theyre gonna fry The Johnson brothers What But Two black kids broke their father out of prison The father shot two people the sons are convicted of murder lawyer prays for an innocent client Finally get two Both of them are gonna get zapped No more appeals This was the best shot Whoa Its the press You dont want to talk to the press Dershowitz Psychiatric Institute Hang on a second Claus von Bulow Its a reporter With an English accent What paper do you represent If cant save two innocent kids whats the point Yeah one second Sorry He really seems to think hes von Bulow Hello This is Alan Dershowitz Who are you What do you want It is von Bulow Back in business Can help you Claus von Bulow Elevators to the left Holy shit Hello Hello Professor Dershowitz Hello hello How good of you to come Pleasure Wont you sit down Do you play That No Most people think its a game of luck Actually its largely a matter of nerve Erm Nothing thank you Charles Why dont we go to Delmonicos and have a proper lunch Whatever have the greatest respect for the intelligence and integrity of the Jewish people When married Sunny she was the most beautiful divorce in the world and one of the wealthiest Even so we never got this table Professor Dershowitz Dr von Bulow Two injections of insulin already m a doctor In America its fame rather than class Now after all this unpleasantness always get the best table Speaking of the unpleasantness Oh yes Wed better discuss your fee an hour Good Lord You know used to be a lawyer in London That sounds a bit steep Its average for a case like this Besides do a lot of pro bono work Youd pay for that Plus have to pay students associates Are you saying that if agree to pay you will handle my appeal No not so far Doesnt look like my kind of case m not a hired gun gotta feel a moral or constitutional issue is at stake But m absolutely innocent And my civil liberties have been egregiously violated Two black kids are facing the electric chair for a crime they did not commit They are innocent Well before you assume m guilty wont you hear my story No Never let defendants explain Puts most of them in an awkward position How do you mean Lying But give you my word as a gentleman Oh Well Wont you at least read the record and see if you can find something constitutional You do have one thing in your favor Everybody hates you Well thats a start Come on Maxwell Yeah Come on Max It was a hit Yes So what do you think Oh he did it He did it Of course he did it Can we win hundred to one against The maid schmeared him on both comas Look at this It says here After you realized that Mrs von Bulow had not gotten up what did you do came downstairs and Mr von Bulow said that Madame had a very sore throat and didnt have to do any work and she was in bed all day What are you doing Did we ring for you Shes icecold Madame Mrs von Bulow Leave her alone Shes sleeping She drank last night We didnt get any rest Shes not sleeping Shes unconscious You must call a doctor Maria Go on halfhour later she had not moved went back and forth all morning Finally midafternoon Mr von Bulow spoke to Dr Paultees But he lied to doctor Shes sleeping now but earlier she was up to the bathroom and had a soft drink so theres no cause for alarm But she never moved Never got up She was lying in the same position all day Later her heart stops and Dr Paultees he comes and saves her After they go to the hospital change the sheets find a puddle of urine If Madame went to the bathroom she would not have peed in her bed Right Why would Claus lie about that Its suspicious but hardly criminal How about the second coma Maria wasnt in Newport for that one But shortly before the second coma m cleaning up their room when find Mr von Bulows canvas bag packed for Newport Inside theres a little black bag bottle of insulin a syringe and needles Alexander Alexander come here Insulin For what insulin My ladys not diabetic Three weeks later Sunnys lying unconscious in a freezing bathroom with her nightgown hiked over her waist If was on that jury wouldve voted to convict Then youre taking the case Reminds me of my Hitler dream Hitler calls up hes alive needs a lawyer say Sure Come on over Then have to decide do take the case or do kill him You No question would take the case Then kill him m a maniac need your judgment someone to watch what m doing and occasionally remind me about the law When can see the transcripts Youre a former prosecutor conservative We agree on nothing But youre smarter than the If can beat your arguments can destroy his Rhode Island is corrupt Everything is political dont think that way You do have to see the big picture cant immerse myself in facts But we must know the facts No one can assimilate information as quickly as you two agree with that assessment Youre out of your mind only have days to file cant do it without you know you dont wanna come back Is this strictly professional It better be Thats wonderful want the best people in the world on our side the most prestigious experts Nobel prizewinning scientists some of your colleagues at Harvard Wait a minute Claus We got a little problem People like that we cant control They find one incriminating fact theyll tell the world m not afraid Alan Let the chips fall where they may Thats what an innocent man would say know That just came for you Daddy My daughter Cosima She never doubted me She loves Alex and Ala dearly Siding with me has cost her their affections dont know what wouldve done dont want to hear your story but do need some information Of course gather the older children deny Sunny had a problem with pills and alcohol Spectacular understatement So there must be somebody who saw it witness a friend You want affidavits Yes ll get them Youll get them The drugs prescribed for me were taken by Sunny Thats a lot of drugs But the prosecutions allegation that knew about syringes injections totally accurate Sunny and gave ourselves injections in the late s It was quite the fad Can explain something The less know from you the more options have When you tell me the truth you limit me to a defense that fits with what you say But isnt the truth the simplest way Alan mean why did stay all day at Sunnys side without calling a doctor Because Sunny detested doctors If we called one without her approval she went berserk Once she broke her hip and didnt go to hospital for two days Did you hear what just said Did you hear the judge sentence me Sorry years is a pretty stiff sentence Twice trying to murder ones wife anything less would be monstrous But for a man like myself who did nothing What wanted to ask if we lose the appeal will have the chance later to set my affairs in order before m incarcerated In Europe a gentleman is given the opportunity to end things properly Come on Claus We are each the keeper of our own soul Two big problems the case against him is very strong and the legal conviction isnt the only conviction that weve got to reverse The more dangerous conviction is the absolute certainty of the American people that Claus is guilty Finding grounds for reversal wont be enough here Judges on the Rhode Island Supreme Court will have to go home to their spouses and explain why they reversed To get them to do that we have to obliterate every aspect of the states case Destroy the medical case and their witnesses so the judges have no possible way to affirm Total victory or we are dead in the water Now assume that youve all had an opportunity to look at the transcripts First impressions think this whole thing stinks think Claus von Bulow stinks Hes obviously guilty of something pretty despicable and if we free him we become partners in his crime accessories after the fact m shocked with your record defending the poor and oppressed that youve taken this case wont have anything to do with it And hope my fellow students wont either Goodbye My exercise my First Amendment right to free speech If lawyers only defended the innocent thered be just ten lawyers in the country Why help guilty people get off Youre sure hes guilty sure He had a lawyer He had a trial He was convicted Are you sure he had a fair trial Come on Its the basis of the whole legal system Everyone gets a defense So the system is there for the one innocent person who was falsely accused look Say its you You decide to get a divorce Youre gonna divorce your husband week later youre accused of molesting your son Dont give me that look Stuff like this happens all the time Suddenly youre alone You hate it Its a nightmare Everyone assumes that you are guilty Even the mailman is beginning to look at you a little funny You only got one person who believes in you Theres only one person you can trust your lawyer Yeah So someones gotta defend Claus But why you Why us Look youre my student You have a choice You dont have to do anything you dont want to That is your choice The reason take cases and here m unlike most other lawyers who are not professors and have to make a living take cases cos get pissed off And am pissed off here The family hired a private prosecutor Unacceptable They conducted a private search Now we let em get away with that rich people wont go to the cops any more You know what theyll do Get their own lawyers to collect evidence And then they are going to choose which evidence they feel like passing on to the And the next victim isnt gonna be rich like von Bulow but is gonna be some poor schnook who cant afford or cant find a decent lawyer think its a little more complicated than your simple moral superiority No agree von Bulow is guilty but thats the fun mean thats the challenge See Now there is a lawyer What have Mr von Bulow for you put him on Alan a rather unsavory character called David Marriott contacted me claiming to have information about a drug delivery at Clarendon Court Where does he live Somewhere in Wakefield well get on it Tom want you to get a private investigator to dig into a David Marriott lives in Wakefield How are we gonna win this case The judge made lots of mistakes Judges always make mistakes How will we win One issue leaps up This lawyer Brillhoffer interviewed Alex Maria everybody He was the first to hear their stories He took notes and used them at trial against a defense witness But the defense never saw the notes The judge wouldnt let us have them Its perfect Brady why dont you draft a letter writing to Brillhoffer asking him very nicely to send us his notes Yeah right Hell fax them right over Yeah right We could win on this issue alone You know it know it Just make sure he knows it Now Nancy and Dobbs Yes Theyre going to attack the medical testimony Our Rhode Island counsel Peter Macintosh he will analyze the state supreme court The rest of us should begin dissecting the transcript Errors inconsistencies great Now remember most cases are won in the field not in court Minnie You wanna work with Sarah on this You may learn something Come on Minnie Minnie Please Come on dont trust Marriott dont know him But if he knew Alex von Auersberg Youre crazy dont know who you think you are Perry Mason Let our private investigator interview him Its stupid and unprofessional Its fun Fun This guy is a sleaze You dont know what hes gonna try What is he gonna shoot me Come on m from Brooklyn ll stand by the window every ten minutes That way you can know m safe had this friend Gilbert Jackson Interior decorator Flaming queen but a very excellent guy He introduced me to Alex von Auersberg Sure it was Alex We had dinner a few times drinks All knew Alex was some rich kid So sometimes this is like summer of d motor to Newport for some and Gilbert asked me to bring Alex a package figured interior decoration Maybe drapes Like six times So d call Alex How did you get his phone number From Gilbert You still have it Maybe m that kind of guy Here One night got curious Opened the package Fuckin pharmacy man Needles syringes white powder nice selection of pills Demerol Like a drugstore You delivered drugs six times and didnt know it Stupid huh Then Gilbert asked me again couldnt say no but this time made Alex open the package in front of me Voil go Awful lot of pharmaceuticals for one person He goes Oh give some to my mom to keep her off my back few weeks later Gilbert gets mistaken for a softball Two guys bash his head in Alex calls me totally urinary Will the cops find his phone number and fuck up his trust fund or something Well thats the fat Thats the skinny You like it You traffic with drug dealers and drag queens you have a parttime job you ride in rented limos All in all d say youre probably the least impressive witness ve ever seen Wait a minute You think m scum dont you Blow it out your ass You want a witness to back me up ll get one And hey maybe ll see you at the Celtics huh am not going to let them execute you Youre not gonna die Look Johnny this is gonna be a lot easier on you if you dont cry know your brothers hysterical Number one they always set a date for the execution and they always postpone it Hes great like this just wish he had something left for those around him Why are you talking to me about money Anyway its nice to have you back here Say hello to your brother Right whos got what Marias testimony She says Sunny did take Valium prescribed for Claus Score one for von Bulow And this Jamie Smather prescription Whos Jamie Smather pound redheaded hooker in white boots She supplied Claus with Valium He had a gorgeous mistress and went to an ugly whore There are some things even mistresses wont do Like what am not telling Anyway Maria swears she first saw this Jamie Smather prescription February th and then again February th So It wasnt prescribed till the th Youre not suggesting shes lying How about Marias insulin Anything more on that Not yet Something about that bothers me whos next Brillhoffer wrote back Hes very attached to his notes am satisfied that there is not a scrap of paper in my files that might even arguably be viewed as exculpatory Translation He says he has nothing thatd help us You with me Pay dirt What Hes a lawyer If he didnt have anything hed give it to us But theres something there and hell fight to hold on to it will bet my fee that no one remembered seeing insulin until after the lab report came back So youre suggesting Memory enhancement It might be more than that Possibly frameup You mean by the kids Where dyou get this Brillhoffers letter Pure deduction good lawyer is part psychiatrist detective logician great lawyer Never would have taken this case If theres nothing more Has anybody read this Its an interview with Truman Capote He says when she was Sunny von Bulow taught him how to inject drugs Let me see that Well well well The famous professor My new girlfriend Andrea Reynolds m not his girlfriend m his savior Perfectly true Two days after the trial we fell in love It was really very dramatic Andrea Andrea Andrea come on Since then ve devoted my life to clearing his name made him hire you Get the Jew said Darling Can the Jew get down to business Weve got an affidavit Smythe Mrs Ruth Smythe gave us an affidavit corroborating Truman Capote have affidavits too Newport people They describe Sunny taking pills getting drunk and falling down thumping into doorways smearing lipstick all over her face Not a very pretty picture She did it didnt she Dont be a priss Sunny was a lovely woman Spoiled rotten Yes but lovely Till she drank Two drinks and she became nasty irrational All women are irrational Did we mention the priest Oh Marriott apparently confided in a priest whos consented to talk to us Father Capello from Providence priest priest is the ideal witness Its like getting the word of God checked God is unavailable lf if the priest comes through and we can get documentation on Sunnys drug use selfinjection may be a plausible theory Theres no insulin in this case But people do use insulin They use it for dieting Sunny was concerned about her weight Maybe but believe me Alan theres no insulin here Really How can you be so sure You realize with this case m looking for evidence to exonerate you But at the same time m also wondering what really happened Who you are Who would you like me to be Your mothers death What happened believe she had a heart problem The rumor in England is you killed her Hey Alan Statute of limitations ran out on that years ago Theres rumors also that killed my aunt And that m a necrophiliac who injected Sunny with insulin so that could have my way with her Please Did Claus drive me crazy Even dont know But its true that took up to laxatives daily popped aspirin like s smoked three packs of cigarettes a day had a problem with alcohol took Valium and Seconal frequently and consumed large quantities of sweets despite a medical condition hypoglycemia which made them hazardous As for my state of mind had not had sex with my husband for years My schedule was woke at did a little exercise and shopping and returned to bed at oclock for the remainder of the afternoon liked to be in bed didnt much like anything else Hold on here will you Come in Alan Welcome to my humble law firm In the kitchen our insulinontheneedle team Theyre cooking up some surprise for us This is our Brillhoffernotes team Mr von Bulow Where are the paper towels Ask Sarah Sarah used to live here This guess he was up all night This sort of commune you do it on every case Never before days to write pages Only way to get it done Heres the blackbag team Illegalsearch team My son Elon lost his room Actually this is another case that youre paying for And this is my team You wish cant find the damn thing Hi m Sarah And a very lovely Sarah you are Does that really work Flattery Absolutely Like Chinese food What do you give a wife who has everything An injection of insulin How Ah my prawns How can one define a fear of insulin Claustrophobia Is there anything more you can tell us about Alexandra Isles Is it true that she gave you a deadline of Christmas to be together Not really No she knew was looking for fulltime work worked for Getty in London Alexandra assumed that when you did find a job youd marry her Oh she assumed it Did you sense that she wanted to get back together Very much so In fact at the trial she said loved him but was still caught up in my own anger And m sorry acted that way then loved him then was angry Let me ask you this Maybe you cant answer Do you still love him dont know That means yes It would seem so In fact after the trial she wrote me a letter saying so explicitly very passionate letter Passionate and jealous But that was the relationship from the outset That was Alexandra She was your love slave Ah think now ll have my own individual order of ginger prawns Three weeks before her final coma Sunny overdosed on aspirin Can you tell us about that had nothing to do with that Of course not m asking you what happened Sunny had been unwell Are you all right Just a bit dizzy If youre dizzy dont go wandering Sunny Oh my God Come on my darling Youre all right Put your arm around my shoulder No youre all right Come on well get you back into bed Something happened to my head Youre all right Its just a little cut Come on lets get you lying down There you are There Shall call a doctor No No dont want a doctor Just dont want a doctor just wanna be left alone wanna be left alone with all those beautiful letters What did you do with those letters Why did you write those letters Later the doctor said we neednt have gone to hospital but wasnt going to take any chances Why did she take so much aspirin Sunny always took aspirin Shed been taking a lot for several days Thats not what our doctor said Dr Lucus Lupardus chief forensic toxicologist Suffolk County says people who take lots of aspirin every day never reach that level He also said the average blood level in cases of death is Hers was So So it was obviously a suicide attempt Why Yeah Why Why Alan do they all want to be prosecutors Were waiting presume she was unhappy How about we all finish up and go back to the house Were not gonna win this on a technicality Peter ve read every recent case where the Rhode Island Supreme Court reversed They dont like to make new law or discuss broad legal issues When they do reverse the grounds are technical but the reason seems to be they suspect a convicted defendant may be innocent everybody get that True or not weve gotta convince the judges that you are innocent Claus now do wanna hear your side of the story With pleasure Innocence has always been my position First coma what preceded it Sunny loved Christmas It was her favorite season really You see what you must understand about Sunny is that she loved giving more than anything else Each year she always made a big bowl of fresh eggnog On that year she drank a lot of it How much or glasses With her hypoglycemia Did she always drink like that Never She never touched alcohol at all except on social occasions to overcome her shyness or when she was upset This was not a social occasion No Wed been discussing divorce all afternoon This whole subject of your work coming between us isnt it just a pretext when the real subject is her Certainly not m thinking of redecorating this whole fucking house Then she knew about Alexandra Yes How did she find out Er told her the previous summer Oh ve been meaning to mention our understanding about my extracurricular activities Mm ve been involved with someone who falls outside the parameters of our agreement Really Someone peripherally in our circle Billy Botskys daughter Alexandra Isles Well That must be better for you than what youve had to put up with Youre referring to the call girls Yes mean that is where youve gone previously isnt it Yes it is And isnt this better Or is Billy Botskys daughter a call girl too This is much better That was what July August Now its Christmastime and you were still squabbling over Alexandra No we were fighting about my work Sunny was Well by the evening shed drunk so much eggnog that had to help her into the bedroom Time for bed darling There we are Please dont hold my arm Darling you know when you get like this Do you remember You fell and broke your hip That was years ago It was two years ago Get me a Scotch and soda May at least urinate alone She runs the water every time she goes in there If she was soused why get the Scotch Because she asked for it Sunny got what Sunny wanted Its Good night Daddy Good night darling Good night Claus Good night Alex Hasnt my mother given us enough money Claus That night we hardly slept Your age is perfectly acceptable to retire m already retired havent worked fulltime since Getty Exactly Its your ego Youve never had a career not really m going to have one now Come on Sunny Your father worked Do you want the children to think a males place is in a deck chair You marry me for my money then demand to work Youre the prince of perversion Are you trying to destroy our family No of course not simply want some intercourse with the world Shut up Pan Oh what does it matter So is that it Another divorce ll divorce you will Oh God Twotime loser ll divorce everybody dont want a divorce dont want to marry Billy Botskys daughter want to stay with you and want to work need that as a man Its hopeless Oh God need my beauty sleep Why do you believe its hopeless just because its some Good night Claus Sunny you know love you Good night and the next day Well Marias testimony was wildly exaggerated Sunny was never moaning Maybe the occasional slur but And Maria shook Sunny Nobody ever shook Sunny What happened when she became conscious After the first coma it was kind of absurd Everybody was angry at me Cant you ever leave me alone Why did you do it wouldve been better off You wouldve been better off What do you want me to say m sorry saved your life Yes Say it Of course m not sorry Claus What am going to do with myself When phoned Alexandra to tell her she said the same thing She said Why did you do it Why did you call the doctor Are you saying she wanted you to let Sunny die No no no no no It was more Everybody says Sunnys such an unhappy woman and has nothing to live for Well so much for the first coma The second of course was much more theatrical Theatrical What is this a fucking game This is life and death Your wife is laying in a coma You dont even make a pretence at caring do you Of course care Alan Its just dont wear my heart on my sleeve Lets call it a night As you wish Three drugs on the needle amobarbital Valium insulin We cant all be you Alan Get a doctor to prepare five needles One with nothing two with Valium amobarbital and insulin two with just Valium and amobarbital We send them to the lab that our famous needle went to See if we get a falsepositive result If we dont If we dont clean the latrines Youre not gonna believe this David Marriott wants money Who doesnt His memory might fail Forget him He has lost his job and he is running around trying to find evidence for us Lets do what the government does with witnesses Pay him for his time Whats his time worth Buck and a half Dersh Your teams on You gonna pass to me this game No Their investigator said the needle had an encrustation near the tip Doctors tell us this is inconsistent with injection So how did it get there Oh If inject this needle the skin acts as a kind of a swab It cleans the needle off leaving the tip completely free of liquid But if just dip the needle into the liquid what do you see Dry this out you have an encrustation So its a frameup Its Desdemonas handkerchief My stepchildren thought was guilty didnt have evidence so concocted some This should win us the case no No Were maybe halfway home Theres still a lot of weird stuff Did you love Sunny married her Of course loved her She was beautiful Rich Why not What ve seen of the rich you can have em do The black bag Was it yours Sunny appropriated it But to understand that you must understand that after the first coma she went into a complete rage Did you take them Certainly not Take what My pills you moron Valium Seconal You took them didnt you ve long since stopped interfering Well who My children wouldnt dare Oh know who Where are you going Maria She soon found them Its my lovely mother isnt it Shes behind all this Shes in cahoots with Maria Well just because she had all the money before had all the money does not mean shes my lord and master Of course not am your lord and master Just kidding Maria loves me too much Its unhealthy for her and its certainly no fun for me There Well see if that ugly little maid of mine can sniff this one out And what are you going to do with all that m not gonna tell you assure you its not gonna be among my affairs Odd she used that word affairs The prosecution thinks you ground up the drugs to inject Sunny And this nosedrop business is pretty farfetched But consider the pattern Alan Its public record that Sunny used drugs Her behavior here of hiding them in liquid so that no one will find them is your classic alcoholic stashing pints of whiskey all over the house Youre right Of course Youve always been right havent you This is the most dangerous case ever worked on You find that exhilarating No do not am breaking every rule The best way to win is to proclaim your innocence and have never done that for anybody And the problem got is see who you are Youd do anything to win So would you Yeah but you dont trust the legal system Youre saying d manufacture witnesses affidavits No but you would sacrifice me Oh please Alan The more believe that you are innocent then more nervous am go out on a limb for you youre proven guilty look like an asshole My reputation my credibility my career destroyed Thats the risk youre taking Well fuck you Fuck you man m glad we understand one another Its easy to forget all this is about me lying here To most of you my name means coma My second marriage means attempted murder Everything before everything beautiful does not exist in the public mind No one thinks of how loved my children Look at Cosima And Alex of course And Ala And certainly no one cares about Claus the way he was when fell in love with him When Claus and first met was married to the dashing young Prince Alfred Eduard Friederich Vincenz Martin Maria von Auersberg It was seven years into my first marriage It seems that my first husband Alfie as he was called had vowed to be unfaithful with every pretty girl in Europe He was having quite a success And so was unfaithful with Claus Psst Wildly unfaithful Happy memories But its not the passion remember most Its the tenderness Good God whats that Just one of Franks pets Oh my God Come on silly never liked people much not as a rule But Claus was somehow different Not a normal person guess Its all right Do it again Give him some more One of those things you never forget Of course now he lives in my apartment my bedroom my bed Cold isnt it Cold and brutish and the way of the world Looking at him now the issue seems simple Is he the devil If so can the devil get justice And all this legal activity is it in Satans service Sunny von Bulow was totally vulnerable to Claus von Bulow Cant argue with that But its speculation exaggeration You keep working on it Totally inflammatory good Lets go over this we went over it once just want you to see if it Oh shit What is this Illegal search technicality a guilty mans argument This is different Usual Fourth Amendment case youre trying to exclude evidence Same thing here No this search destroyed evidence No fingerprints no inventory Whats left hurts Claus but the state has to The cops tested the drugs from the illegal search Yes And we are saying that that test constituted a second illegal search There are precedents know there are m not debating that What m trying to do Youre debating me personally Why m debating strategy m not debating you Were all on the same team arent we dont know We seem to be Then why dont feel it thought this was professional It was Thats bullshit Alan asked you to work on this case because think you are a good lawyer You too but you give all you have to the law and forget the people you care about My clients are the people that care about Obviously What care about all fuckin care about is this This case And making the best possible appeal that were capable of doing You can make your argument better You know that know that So why dont you just do it and cut all the bullshit You always have to have the last word dont you What Were gonna lose Why do you think this case fascinates people Cos one time or other every man is driven crazy by his wife and in his heart he wants to do exactly what Claus is accused of Kill her in some sly silent way that cant be detected Claus is a scapegoat Someone has to suffer for the sin that we all wanna commit Alan thats ridiculous Its ridiculous Youre right What have you got Prosecutions case is based on a theory The needle in the bag insulin on the needle insulin in her blood Right right right fine In Derek this Rhode Island Supreme Court these same judges said that in a case based on circumstantial theory the case falls apart if any part of the theory is weak If theres a weak link then you throw the whole chain out Exactly Peter thats good Thats very good Oh yeah this is good Thank you What do you want me to do now want you to find as many alternative theories as possible Hey Come on Theres only seven days left Dersh Youd better come downstairs Hey Dersh Sorry to get you out of bed What do you want More money Can you get more Can have a glass of water please No The reason m here my affidavit is inaccurate Great Just what need right now Its slow Yeah left something out something incredibly important Remember gave Alexs drugs to a woman at Clarendon Court Yeah So That bitch was definitely Sunny von Bulow David this is bad It looks bad ve met with you five times now and all of a sudden No its not sudden think always knew but became convinced by staring at pictures of her We cant use your affidavit unless its truthful Are you sure this time swear on the body and soul of my mother Poor woman Put in this change and make him go over every word of the affidavit Uh can use your mens room More money Can you get more If Claus had injected her he wouldve thrown away the needle right Sure If he threw away the insulin why keep the needle Claus is strange but he aint stupid He is arrogant Is that a crime Sometimes Why are we even discussing this Its obvious the kids framed him Whoa You changed your tune frameup doesnt mean hes innocent The kids couldve framed the guilty man Dersh Telephone Its Peter Macintosh Yeah Do you know what it is Word in Rhode Island is that the state cant lose Got an ace up their sleeve What is it Hes gonna try to find out All right my friend Friend like that Nothing personal no students no witnesses Second coma lets hear it Strange as it may seem now in retrospect Claus cut the bullshit December Sunny was unwell Wed been arguing all afternoon d been offered a new position in the oil business which wouldve meant my spending some time in Europe The discussion mustve escalated because went to talk to the children This will bring gold florin from any rebels worth the name florin Thats a pretty good take Lets vote on it All those in favor If youll forgive my interruption ve something to tell you both Were heading for the best pirate days ever It looks as if as though Mummy and are going to have to split up because my work is something she cannot tolerate Mummy says things like that but she always gets over it Yes but this has been going on for too long m going to Europe in the new year This will probably lead to a split Oh Its all right Shell get over it Alex says you said that the next day Is anything more absurd than announcing your intention to divorce a woman whos just fallen into a coma No That evening everything seemed normal enough Not cheerful But then we didnt usually giggle at mealtimes Despite her doctors warnings about sweets the only thing Sunny consumed was a sundae After supper went to finish off some work in my study The others decided to chat in the living room That would be lovely but first need to go to my room for just a minute After about an hour dropped in on them Darling would you care for anything Mm lf theres some chicken bouillon left ll look There you are darling Thank you How is your work coming m totally flummoxed cant get the figures to make any sense Why dont you call your friend Deborah doubt shed be in Saturday night So Deborah think youll agree thats Right Now But Deborah was home and we did talk for some time until Claus come quick Mummys not well Deborah can call you back in the morning Thanks Her voice got very weak and she almost fell down had to help her Somebody open a window find the chill reassuring Now must speak with Claus Good night Mummy Good night Good night darling Good night Alex That is if Claus has time to talk Or are you going to work every spare moment right through Christmas Is your work so fascinating Or are you trying to drive me away Because if you are youre succeeding because dont want this didnt marry you for this couldve had anybody With my money Anybody Well Say something Do something Be a man already have a butler Do something dont want this dont dont want this dont dont want this The same conversation as the previous year only this time with greater venom Youve always been afraid of me Its not because of my money Its basically because youre a coward Your pitiful masculinity is so fragile you cant stand confrontation so you go off with Miss Botsky Good night As was usual was awakened before dawn let the dogs out as was customary went back through the bedroom to my study as quietly as possible did not notice if my wife was in bed did not notice if the light was on under the bathroom door Had it been on wouldnt have given it a thought did my exercises showered and then called Deborah Knowles Well mean its stable and its profitable Can anyone really believe if was trying to murder my wife that would spend an hour going over a tedious set of figures After the call passed through the bedroom again It was freezing By this time Sunny was certainly not in bed And heard water running in the bathroom had breakfast walked the dogs and on my return asked the children where Mummy was Has Mummy had breakfast yet We havent seen her Sunny Her bathroom was her private sanctuary No one entered it Except the maid of course to clean up Sometimes she stayed there for hours or so it seemed One can only speculate what goes on behind a closed door Sunny are you there hesitated even to knock Darling Sunny Oh God Once d ascertained she was breathing went to fetch Alexander Why not call an ambulance first Panic Alan panic mean needed to talk to somebody wasnt worried if she was breathing normally It wasnt like the year before In retrospect it seems absurd but looked at her upper lip She had blood on it thought shed broken a tooth That was my concern And thats really all can thats really all can say But is it the truth Of course But not the whole truth dont know the whole truth dont know what happened to her wish didnt believe you Its very hard to trust someone you dont understand Youre a very strange man You have no idea Everybody here Macintosh says hes got bad news There he is Well found out what the state has Their ace in the hole Its you Its me David Marriott taped all his conversations with you Oh great The scuttlebutt is if we win the case you go to prison What did say Good old corrupt Rhode Island friend got me an excerpt The reason m here My affidavit is inaccurate David this is bad It looks bad What do you want More money Can you get more Yeah That is not what said Its on tape Alan dont care Thats not what said What do we do dont know ll tell you what we do We ignore it Alan with that tape its your whole career now believe Claus is innocent so weve decided no tricks no technicalities We are going to base our appeal directly and explicitly on Clauss innocence Appeals must be based on judicial error The judge shouldve thrown out the case You cant say there wasnt sufficient evidence He was convicted Good point Thats what we are saying If the rules dont work you change them Red Auerbach changed the jumpball rule when the Celtics had a short team But its dangerous politically If the judges feel insulted Wait State supreme court shouldnt even look at an appeal based on new evidence Hey guys ll take care of that You just leave it to me Look know youre all exhausted We got four days left What we do now will decide this thing Do you wanna win or not Alan Weve got something Weve hit the jackpot Our needles that had amobarbital and Valium But no insulin Both came back with falsepositive readings for insulin One was the other Weve knocked out every piece of their medical case now all theyve got left is my neck Anybody know anything about editing audio tapes Defense Defense Come on Come on baby Come on baby All right Alan Come on Pass it Alan Wait a minute got it Wheres Raj Hes upstairs Where are you going Raj Raj got it got it Remember Maria She could have said it like this Insulin For what insulin My lady is not diabetic You see My lady is not diabetic She is assuming that the bag is Sunnys Her first reaction not part of a legal strategy devised later is that the stuff in the black bag belonged to Sunny not Claus Whod know better than she Start writing You are not God You are a prosecutor Alabama cant execute those Johnson kids before the Supreme Court rules You heard me right You got two hours to make Rhode Island You want me to speed No Theyll stop you and you wont make the deadline m telling you right now those kids fry youre next Youre damn right Some startling developments in the von Bulow case Professor Alan Dershowitz had been accused of paying for falsified testimony but those accusations were discredited today by the attorney general who announced that David Marriotts tape was doctored and that Marriott is not a reliable witness So what was he up to Alan Who was he working for Damned if know Hope they dont think he worked for you No ones going to Look dont think you did it But at the Chinese restaurant you did duck the big question Chuck is our Alexandra Isles expert Sunnys aspirin overdose Why did she take so many What happened Sunny had a headache The headache was Alexandra right Lets hear it Claus Alexandra was spiteful On the day of Sunnys aspirin overdose she returned some presents d given her some photographs Love letters She dropped them off in a shopping bag Did Sunny see them Sunny was home was not Alexandra neglected to address the package to me wanna be left alone with all those beautiful letters What did you do with those letters Why did you write those letters Theres a big difference between knowing about an affair and having love letters crammed down your throat It seems that Sunny did care about your affair She cared a lot Why didnt you tell us Everything was openbook Get the best experts m not afraid of the truth Looks to me like Alexandra tried to force Sunny into suicide Or they plotted it together Either way hes protecting Alexandra because he still loves her And why not Hey shes a babe Of course still love her And hate her Alexandra Sunny Andrea love them all Being a human being is very literal Youre trapped Time moves in only one direction forward Its stupid and boring and results in a lot of silliness Example the legal process In this particular case a vast amount of time effort and money was spent trying to determine what happened on those two nights so close to Christmas December December Happened right here Even now it all looks the same feels the same smells the same If you could just go back in time and take a peek youd know And all this would be unnecessary All rise Hear ye hear ye All persons having business before the Supreme Court holding in province within and for the State of Rhode Island may now draw near Then again everyone enjoys a circus Be seated If the appellant is ready you may proceed Oral argument will be made by outofstate counsel Professor Alan Dershowitz Your Honors you may not like Claus von Bulow You may think he is guilty of something But am here to tell you he is innocent Our new evidence Professor You know there is no case which allows you to introduce new evidence on appeal There is one Your Honor And you wrote it Derek In Derek you yourself said that a case based on circumstantial theory rather than fact only stands up if no other theory makes sense The only way to show a better theory is to present it Get on with it counselor The first issue is the encrusted needle hope you will have the courage to free an innocent man and remedy a grave injustice This will never work Too smart for his own good Alan says it will work If the prosecutor takes the bait What do you mean bait Argues the evidence Your Honors introduction of new evidence on appeal violates every principle of jurisprudence every statute every precedent every rule of ethics Hes nailing us am not going to stand before you and argue Mr von Bulows guilt However have no choice but to address Mr Dershowitzs arguments one by one Bingo First the encrusted needle So now its up to the judges Tell me what you really think think its easier to love somebody than to live with them Love is fantasy Living is work ll say And those people dont like to work But if you dont do the work the love dies and nobody wants to deal with that one Whoa whoa whoa The love died Sunny couldnt accept it so Claus tried to kill her Maybe dont agree Face it All we had to do was prove the state made a lousy case We didnt prove Claus was innocent We couldnt and he probably isnt You mean you think So he didnt inject Sunny with insulin So what First coma no problem The attending doctor thought it was caused by hypoglycemia All right But what about the second coma mean why does Claus act so guilty Wouldnt any man feel guilty if his wife was suicidal Yeah So maybe she took the sleeping pills with the intention of killing herself But how did she end up lying on a marble floor in a freezing bathroom with her head under the toilet How about this Sunny wakes up miserable Second marriage is over children are leaving home Whats to live for But when she was found her nightgown was hiked over her waist Exactly How did it get there lets say shes standing at the sink She has to pee At exactly the same instant the drugs hit her body convulses she grabs the nightgown dont buy that It does seem farfetched So is the truth sometimes Bull think she took the drugs the previous night Maybe he saw her take them Or she told him she was going to before they fell asleep This time he wants her to succeed Sunny Maybe theres some way he can help her along Of course The open window Zero degrees But somebody might see her there The action of dragging her would naturally pull up the nightgown In this cold how long could she survive Remember what Sunny said wouldve been better off You wouldve been better off because the law is a blunt instrument It is not a rapier It is a cudgel Tomorrow death penalty Which reminds me of the comedian who said Why do they call it the death penalty Its no penalty Youre out of the game Good news And more good news The decision came They just announced it Fivezip We murdered em Grounds They got the Brillhoffer notes And that guiltymans argument search and seizure Federal or state Both If its federal they could appeal but as its Rhode Island they cant We win Dont get too excited till we see Brillhoffers notes We destroyed their medical case but their witnesses still carry emotional weight Unless the Brillhoffer notes show that theyve changed their stories Good afternoon sir Let me get that for you Thank you You have Brillhoffers notes Yes Well Theyre not what we hoped knew it Theyre much better No one mentioned insulin when they first talked to Brillhoffer Plus Maria told him that when she supposedly first saw insulin she couldnt even read any of the labels They were all scraped off What does this mean It means that if there is a second trial we can be confident Both the medical case and their witnesses are now highly suspect Ah Darling this is Alan Dershowitz Yes know Hello Alan tells me Well things look very hopeful knew it would come out all right Thank you Yes Alan thank you am eternally grateful Hey this means well be getting back your bail million dollars know still owe you Alan Please send me your bill And maybe when youre in New York we can meet for lunch d enjoy that One thing Claus Legally this was an important victory Morally youre on your own Claus von Bulow was given a second trial and acquitted on both counts This is all you can know all you can be told When you get where am you will know the rest Claus von Bulow is still married to Sunny von Bulow He is presently living and working in London The Johnson brothers remain on death row Sunny von Bulow has not spoken since she fell into her final coma This film is based upon Alan Dershowitzs book Reversal Of Fortune and public records Dialogue and certain events and characters contained in the film were created for the purpose of dramatization Two packs of Vantage please Anything else Yes a vial of insulin Just kidding
