Since time began a war has been waged in the shadows between the armies of Good and Evil It may be fought on a grand scale or within the heart of a single individual or even a child The Evil has taken many forms and used the darkest of arts In our time they call themselves simply the Hand The Good follow the way of kimagure Its masters can see the future and perhaps even bring back the dead Legend tells of a unique warrior a lost soul This warrior is a woman a motherless daughter And it is her destiny to tip the balance between Good and Evil She is a treasure and both sides seek her out as a final weapon in an ancient war Perimeter whats your status Delta team clear Alpha clear Bravo secure It doesnt matter You cant stop her Nobody can stop her Her was afraid if told you you wouldnt take the job never shouldve hired you Who do you thinks coming for you You may have heard of her Her name is Elektra You find that funny Shes an urban legend sir That woman died years ago Really Well then somebody must have brought her back from the dead You know Bauer when youve done the things ve done you make a lot of enemies My private security detail the best money could buy This nonexistent woman killed of them in half an hour barely got away Spent the next two days in Monte Carlo wondering why she let me go Then she came for me was under the protection of the Hand itself who sent their best Although they seemed more interested in killing Elektra than in protecting me She cut em down like wheat Took maybe minutes max Didnt really think why kept gettin away So here am And now understand her She wanted me to feel this what its like to have nowhere to go nowhere to turn Hows your perimeter doing now Delta whats your status Theres no signal Son of a bitch You know the better the

kill me straight out Just cold Dont worry Deaths not that bad Yeah How do you know died once So am to understand that with all the power of the Hand that the Treasure continues to elude us Yes Perhaps if we had pursued it sooner and more aggressively You dare to blame Master Roshi Seems our methods are too mild for Kirigi Not at all sensei But if we cannot have the weapon ourselves allow me to make sure it does not fall into the hands of those who may use it against us Master allow me Things like this must be handled smoothly quietly Then work smoothly Meizumi but quickly Kirigi Yes Father
