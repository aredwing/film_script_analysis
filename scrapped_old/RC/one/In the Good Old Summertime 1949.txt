so But dont try to change him Dont you go putting him on any diet Would you say he was fat wouldnt no Personally like that little tummy of his It gives him a nice homey look After all thats what you want in a husband isnt it Yeah thats what want And as for his being bald dont think anyone would know it Its very clever the way he lets those few hairs at the back grow long and then combs it forward over the top of his head coming down over his ears Its real genius What About his mind Didnt you find that he was very intelligent and witty No not witty As a matter of fact found him quite depressed But then of course you cant judge a man when hes out of a job Out of a job Why yes Why he never said anything about that to me As you say hes very sensitive But he thinks you can both live comfortably on what you make Did he ask you what make After all he is your fianc He was a little worried at first but promised him d try to get you a raise think this is ridiculous outrageous wish you could read his letters and youd find out that he has such a lofty point of view Lofty And now to find out that hes so materialistic Materialistic too m sorry hate to think that ve spoiled your Christmas You havent spoiled it suppose should be thanking you No you dont have to do that But you know what wish you would do wish youd send this Newspickle about his business and concentrate on me instead cant
