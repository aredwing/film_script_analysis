say lets keep the aesthetic It has integrity history street credibility Lets look at some of the print that used to move it off the shelves dont know It has to be hip What George is saying is that Doop is already hip and the campaign will simply reinforce that fact Other products may come and go sir but Doop Doop Doop has always been there Bring back the old ads huh Why would pay you for that The mans got a point Not the old ads exactly sir We would uh feather the campaign We need a new fresh campaign want youngsters in clubs and malls and on street corners talking about Doop talking about how it holds your hair just so want blogs and podcasts and viral wanna go viral Well why dont Jack and George draw up some proposals and give you some options want options Okay just a couple more

Doopy do Who fucking cares Great Its coming along nicely Here Read this Okay We hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Right So So it doesnt make sense You cant pursue happiness mean if it read you have the right to pursue your dreams and God willing that makes you happy that could buy Semantics No no No no no Its philosophy Happiness is intangible an emotion You cant pursue it Okay so youre saying that one of our core values is flawed Thats exactly what m saying Okay so rule would be Abandon the pursuit of happiness and its false promise Okay read em back to me Rule Be honest Good Believe in fairy tales Rule Accept time as your friend and not our enemy Okay Rule Make sure the nookies good Rule Promote beauty Wage a sustained campaign against ugliness And rule Abandon the pursuit of happiness Are you all right of
