truth Frank they just get better at lying So tell me do you really want another child All know is what feel And anyone else in their right mind would feel the same way April But Ive had two children Doesnt that count in my favor Christ The fact that you even put it that way You make it seemed as having children is some sort of goddamn punishment love my children Frank And youre sure about that

entire fucking family down the toilet No Thats not true Of course didnt But how do know April Please stop Please just stop Frank April a normal woman a normal sane mother doesnt buy a piece of rubber tubing to give herself an abortion so she can live out some kind of God damn fantasy Look all Im saying is you dont seem entirely rational about this thing And think its about time we found somebody
