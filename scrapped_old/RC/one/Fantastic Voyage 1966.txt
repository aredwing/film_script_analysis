Sorry we gotyou up at this hour Mr Grant thought was on vacation Whats it all about cant tell you Where are we goin cant tell you that either Youre to stay inside Mr Grant and wait Your card please Thank you Hello Grant General Carter Good to see you again The Pentagon wasnt it Come on Benes What the devil happened The other side got to him How bad off is he Brain injury Hes in a coma Before or after what he wanted to say Before he could breathe a word Hes the only scientist who knows what were after Thats why we have to operate And why we need you Me cant even put a BandAid on my finger Heres the surgeon Duval Dr Peter Duval Top brain man in the country Ever hear of him m rusty on surgeons Whos the girl Cora Peterson his technical assistant Youll be joining Duval and the others What can do Except pass out Mike Yes Alan Meet Grant Dr Michaels chief of the medical section Glad to have you with us wish knew why Tell him where he fits in ve got a fewthings to check out We need youfor security purposes Mr Grant At an operation They know they failed to kill Benes Security thinks theyll try again Were afraid of sabotage surgical assassination Surgical assassination You suspect Duval Thats right dont agree Just because hes diffiicult Hes impossible Its no reason to suspect disloyalty There must be other doctors Duvals the most skilful brain surgeon in the country and hes right here at hand wouldnt know if hes trying to kill him ll be standing by would know Youre to take orders only from Dr Michaels Understand Right sir Come along Theyll be operating shortly See you later Mike His technician In addition to the looks No question of her loyalty ll take that Corporal Yes sir dont mean to be inquisitive but this For all know it could stand for Consolidated Mobilisation of Delinquent Females Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces Say that again We can reduce anything down to any size People ships tanks planes ve heard some wild ones but this takes it We can shrink an army Put it in a bottle cap Thats why we call it Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces If the other side gets that They have But we both have the same problem lack of control They can only miniaturise things for exactly minutes After that everything starts growing back to its original size assume Benes knows howto control it Yes He wanted us to have the secret Thats why they tried to kill him Theyll try again No wonder you want me to stand by at the operation And take a little trip with him Trip Where to The only way we can reach that clot is from inside the brain So well put a surgical team and crew into a submarine reduce it way down in size and inject it into an artery You mean m going along As part of the crew yes Wait a minute They cant shrink me We can shrink anything dont want to be miniaturised Its just for an hour Not even for a minute Sir really think you should reconsider just dont think m right for this job Grant youre going to a briefing Miss Peterson volunteered to come So did every male technician woman has no place on a mission of this kind insist on taking my technician Youll take along who assign Dont tell me who m going to work with not on this operation ll do what think is best without interference Dr Duval has relied on Miss Peterson for years And since she wants to come along think its for the best Dr Reid Well disagree with you Since youre in charge do as you please But want it on record m against it Grant Colonel Reid operational commander You met our medical chief Dr Duval head surgeon ve heard of you Miss Peterson his assistant And Captain Bill Owens designer of an experimental submarine for the Navys research programme Out of your element Captain Sort of That makes two of us Grant is uniquely suited to this mission Hes a communications expert and he was a frogman during the war Besides he brought Benes into this country The fewer people who knowthat the better Youll find Grant invaluable should anything go wrong once youre underway Don Heres the overall target area Doctor Beness brain As near as we can map it stereotaxically The clot is right here Its impossible to get at without damage to the intervening tissue which would prove fatal to Benes The only way to reach it is via the arterial system Phase one calls for miniaturising a submarine with crew and surgical team and injecting it into the carotid artery How small will it be About the size of a microbe Were putting Benes in deep hypothermia What Thats freezing him as low as is compatible with human life Itll slow down his heartbeat circulation and all other physical processes Even so Colonel because of our size mean the lack of it well still be cruising pretty fast Well be smashed to bits if theres turbulence The only danger of turbulence is in the heart and were not going through it Once in the carotid artery we remain within the arterial system until we reach the point of the damage where Dr Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam Thank you After the operation we return by way of the venous system until we reach the base of the neck where well be removed right here With a hypodermic How will you know where the sub is at any moment Dr Michaels is a circulatory specialist and will act as your navigator Hell know where you are and you can communicate directly with us by wireless Also the sub is nuclear powered Well track it just as we would any radioactive tracer Therell be surgeons standing by to remove you immediately should anything happen In any event you must be out within minutes After that youre in danger of attack Attack Who Or should say what from Beness natural defences White corpuscles antibodies You see once you begin to grow you become a menace to the body and youll trigger them off And there may be other unknown factors We cant be certain of anything Any further questions Anybody Just one General Whats that Where do get a cab backto town Dr Michaels proceed to the sterilisation section Yes sir Will you follow me How much can a man give to his country Your attention please Make the final preparations Heart Hows it look Henry Holding steady per minute Respiration Jack whats the report Respiration is down to six a minute wouldnt take him down any further Hypothermia Any problems Dr Sawyer No sir Were holding him at degrees Centigrade How do we stand Ready Theyre now entering the sterilisation corridor sir Please board and check all your equipment immediately Heres the particle sir Everything aboard All squared away Dr Michaels Yes Heres your chart table right here All the maps and charts are in sequence from left to right And heres your checklist Dr Duval and will checkthe charts Fine Mr Grant This is your wireless station here Good Ocular motor nerve see Need any help skipper Oh yeah Well save some time Open this would you Set it down there Where On the deck here Yeah right there Thats radioactive material Its atomic fuel Is it all right to open it Perfectly safe Theres a microscopic radioactive particle inside Nothing big enough to be seen with the naked eye If its no military secret how can a sub run on a microscopic particle They cant reduce nuclear fuel But once the reactors been miniaturised a microscopic particle should put out enough energy to activate it Thats cutting it close for a perfect fit Well it should work theoretically If it doesnt the whole missions off You see this craft is nuclear powered All except for your wireless All in all quite a canoe Designed for piscatorial research spawning habits of deepsea fish That reminds me d better spawn a radio message Test message from the Proteus sir Miss Peterson has smiled Well thats an auspicious sign Confirm receiving Captain How will you be able to follow my charts from up there Theres no power on now but once there is May have this chart please You just place the chart here and it will come through on that repeater Repeater Yeah the devi Come on ll show you There thats it Oh yes It all seems quite simple to operate Actually it is although the controls are highly sophisticated Look here Theres a button and a switch for everything Bet youre pretty handy around the house Can you cook Were pushing oxygen today ll have some laughing gas Youre not looking forward to it Its not exactly a pleasure cruise think its very exciting Were going to see things no one has ever seen before Not just something under a microscope Think about it Thats the trouble am Being shrunk You may learn to like it Excuse me For a nice young lady you play with the damnedest toys Miss Peterson Thatll teach you where to keep your hand Now know That could be quite a lethal weapon It could kill not cure Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr Duval The beam from this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimetre Youve been Dr Duvals assistant for some time He must have snatched you out of a cradle ve been with him since got out of school He brought me into the over five years ago Thats a long time with one man Not working with someone like Dr Duval Hes Well Prepare for miniaturisation Positions please still have something to check Right Mr Grant There are two seats under the chart table Would you pull them out please Secure your safety belts Miss Peterson this is your chair right here Doctor let me help you No its all right can manage Doctor Yes Cora wanted to say that What is it Is anything wrong No nothing just wanted to say thank you for taking me along Thank you for volunteering Right Mr Grant You can tell them the Proteus is ready The Proteus Whats that The name of this vessel Sounds better than calling it the Proteus reports all secured sir Miniaturiser All stations stand by All medical posts stand by Check scanner Computer Checks out on radar Instruct computer for a plus Phase one Colonel to proceed Phase two Elevate zero module Lower zero module Halt and transfer in order Elevate zero module Well submerge manually Mr Grant open induction valves one and two Where are they Theres one port and one starboard On the bulkhead right behind you ll get the other Fine You ready Yeah Induction valve open Valve open Close valves Valve closed Right Thats all for the present cant breathe Dr Michaels Dr Michaels ve got to get out Its too late for that Now we must go on m sorry ve got claustrophobia was was buried alive in an air raid in England Two days thought d got over it Please forgive me ll really be all right now Come on Youll feel better once were underway Thank you Lock and hold Colonel Phase three All stations and counting Inform Proteusthey are at full reduction Yes sir At full reduction Right That air feels good Yes Are you all right Yes m Mr Grant tell them the Proteus is on power Proteus on power sir Don its all yours Phase four Elevate zero module Check thermal blanket Tracking Contact Proteus Stand by for injection Right Inject Tracking post The medieval philosophers were right Man is the centre of the universe We stand in the middle of infinity between outer and inner space And theres no limit to either never imagined it could be anything like this No always thought it was nothing but red Only to the naked eye Those corpuscles carrying oxygen give the stream its colour The rest of the plasmas very much like sea water An ocean of life End to end miles long Dr Duval What could those be That looks like the molecular structure of proteins dont agree We should stop and investigate m afraid we havent time Captain keep your present heading until were in the clear Arterial wall to the left Whats our speed knots You should reach the main branching artery in two minutes Keep the wall at this distance when you turn That should bring you safely into the middle of the branch Captain correctyour course and speed She wont respond Were in a current That isnt possible Not in a sealed vessel like an artery Theres something wrong with your controls No its a current Its too strong cant seem to break out of it Whirlpool Strap yourselves in Anyone hurt Cora m all right Thank you Doctor Where are we The corpuscles are blue Captain whats your compass heading Proteus off course Theyve theyve crossed over into the jugular vein That cant be Theres no direct connection between the two Well normally not Unless theres an arteriovenous fistula what Its a forced joining of a vein and an artery It must have happened when Benes was hurt Yes a fistula too small to show up in the tests But big enough for us Can you head back into the artery No we cant fight that current Its impossible Well try not to drift down any further ll do what can Is there an alternate route We can go forward on this course but that means going directly through the heart No we cant do that either We decided in the briefing This craft couldnt stand the turbulence It would be a hundred times worse than the whirlpool Thats just dandy We cant go forward and we cant go back Theres only one thing we can do Call off the mission Weve no choice Weve got to take them out No Weve still got minutes Leave em in But its hopeless They cant go back and they cant go on Theres no choice but to remove them Not until the last second We gotta think of something to save the situation Proteus reports trapped in venous system Requests removal sir Well there it is What do tell them General Doctor Without killing him how long could we stop his heart The less time the better know but whats the maximum In his comatose state and everything slowed down no more than seconds At top speed adjusting distance for degree of miniaturisation that sub should get through the heart in exactly seconds Thats only three seconds to revive him What are the problems involved in stopping the heart Nothing compared with starting it up again Were wasting time Lets get on with it Message to Proteus Cardiac red alert Maintaining maximum speed the sub should get through the heart in seconds This will allow us three seconds to spare in which to revive him To minimise the turbulence we will have to arrest the heart Prepare for cardiac shock Remove the radar The Proteus will proceed to the entrance of the right atrium at which point the heart will be stopped by electric shock And if it takes longer to get through We cant take a second more Captain head in the direction of the flow and then drift with it Well that looks pretty complicated shall be able to guide you once were inside Ready for cardiac shock Cardioscope Tracking Listen The heart Yes Its slowed down a great deal Sounds like heavy artillery It lays down quite a barrage Over million beats in a year And every beat separates a man from eternity Stand by Theyre about to stop the heart Full power when we enter the valve Hit it The semilunar valve should be on our left any second now Stand by to revive There it is Bear to your left Can you see it Captain Yes see it now Brace yourselves Therell be a tremendous surge when the heart starts up again If it does Eight seconds left Now Theyre in the pulmonary artery Theyll make up time once they get through that and reach the pleural cavity Respiration post Whats his rate Jack Back to six per minute Dammit just had them cleaned They all lead to the same place the lungs Dr Michaels the channel is getting awfully narrow Yes were entering a capillary Try to stay in the middle The walls transparent Its less than one tenthousandth of an inch thick And porous Doctor just think of it Were the first ones to actually see it happen The living process Mind letting me in on whats going on out there Its just a simple exchange Mr Grant Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide in return for oxygen coming through on the other side Dont tell me theyre refuelling Oxygenation Weve known it exists even though we never saw it Like the structure of the atom But to actually see one of the miracles of the universe the engineering of the cycle of a breath wouldnt call it a miracle Just an interchange of gases The end product of million years of evolution You cant believe all that is accidental That there isnt a creative intelligence at work Well the creative Mr Grant Yes skipper m losing pressure in the flotation tanks Check the manual control panel Its aft on the starboard side The left tanks losing pressure There must be a short in the electrical valve circuit system Yeah That takes care of the valves suppose it happened because of that electric shock Is there any damage Not to the valve But weve lost so much air we cant make it the rest of the way What do you propose to do Captain Theres nothing we can do We cant continue without full tanks Any reserve air Enough to breathe but thats all Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber one of the countless alveoli of the lung and we cant get enough air to fill a microscopic tank Maybe we can Skipper is there a snorkel on this sub Yes there is Could run a tube through that wall without harming Benes At our present size should think so certainly If those corpuscles can take on air theres no reason why we cant All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber and when Benes inhales there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank Hows that sound to you skipper Well its a dangerous procedure If miss the timing we could explode the air tanks but m willing to try it think we should Yes of course We must try it One more thing Itll be safer if everybody leaves the sub but me ll get the equipment Cora You didnt fasten it down too well But did m positive Then how come it worked loose ve no idea How badly is it damaged dont know Well have to test it Thatll have to wait until after were refuelled cant imagine how it could have happened distinctly remember fastening it down Mustve been jarred loose during the whirlpool Better get these on as quickly as possible Theyve stopped on the outer limits of the left lung Another delay with only minutes left Itll be close but theres still a margin of safety Lets find out whats holding them up Contact the Proteus Must be some kind of mechanical difficulty told you to cut down on the sugar Oh cant help it m just weak guess Shouldntyou answer that Not now We need air not greetings Its full of rocks Those are impurities embedded in the lung Carbon from smoke and specks of dust Well wed better get on with it Careful Theres a tremendous air pressure in there in relation to our size ll hold her from the other side of the wall Maybe that will do it Tie my safety line to the sub Here Let me have it All right now Push the snorkel through as soon as get inside Wait for the lull between the time he inhales and exhales Now Full Hes gone What can we do Delay caused by stop to refuel air Proceeding through pleural cavity Refuel air Why not They had a choice of over a billion alveoli And a broken trigger wire smashed transistor No way to fire the lamp Well thats the end of the laser You must carry spare parts Nothing thats built into the chassis If it only hadnt come loose Thats beside the point now Isnt there another operation you could try No No theres no other way dont see the sense in going on with this But we must With no laser If you had a transistor about this size and power output and a thin enough wire could you mend it Yes but it requires absolute precision surgeon might Yes Yes could do it Well if had the parts ve got a source All we have to do is tap it Grant just a minute Youre surely not going to dismantle the wireless Its just one transistor and a circuit wire Thatll knock out our communications Well be cutting ourselves off Theyd still be able to track us by radar because of the radioactive fuel Whats it to be The wireless or Beness life Send a message to the control tower Message from the Proteus sir Cannibalising wireless to repair laser Theyre what This is our last message Incommunicado Now theyre really on their own We can track em but thats all we can do Something told me got into the wrong end of this business Inner space The transistor will do but the wire is much too thick Theres nothing closer Let me see might be able to scrape it thin enough Cora would you bring me a number scalpel please Yes Doctor Looks like the sea at dawn Were safe as long as it remains that colour Were in the pleural sac It keeps the lungs from rubbing against the wall of the chest Up there When those membranes become inflamed we get pleurisy and a racking cough Cough If he can kick up a storm by just breathing His pleuras in fine condition Should be plain sailing from here on Lets hope so So far someones tried to sabotage this mission twice Sabotage dont quite understand sawthe laser before we started It was fastened down securely What happened was no accident Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub Surely you dont suspect Duval That line was tampered with dont know what to say know hes under a cloud but theres not a more dedicated man in medicine We still never know anyones mind dont believe it It was an accident Two in a row Its possible Look at those walls up ahead Were entering the lymphatic system Those are nuclei of cells lining a duct always had an idea there was only one system the circulatory The lymphatic system drains off excess fluid from the tissues Without it wed all blow up like balloons Looks like quite a navigation problem Only until we get through the nodes The lymphatic glands Keep your present compass heading Right Were picking up seaweed or whatever that is Reticular fibres We ought to be clear of them soon Well hope so Doctor Because if that stuff clogs the vents the engines will overheat Whats causing all this Looks like somebody declared war Thats exactly what it is Antibodies destroying bacteria or any other foreign invader that threatens the system Look Its taken on its exact shape Its like hand in glove Much closer Like two atoms Well never get there in time at this rate Isnt there another route to bypass all this No Yes Theres no other suitable route Yes there is We can transfer to the inner ear And go by way of the endolymphatic duct Why dont we take it Because its more hazardous than the route were following now You see once in the ear any noise at all in the operating theatre would be disastrous At our reduced size any vibrations inside the ear would have a shattering effect Well theyre tracking us Once they see where were going theyll take precautions All right Lets hope they realise the danger Captain ll give you a new heading Proteus turning in quadrant Finally Theyre heading for the inner ear About time they realised theyd never make it the other way Your attention please Proteus is about to enter the inner ear You are not to walk talk or make a sound of any kind Absolute silence must be maintained until they are out of the danger area Whats wrong skipper What was afraid would happen That stuff we passed through that looks like seaweed Yes reticular fibres It clogged the intake vents Were not getting any propulsion Well theres only one thing to do What ll see if maybe theres some way can clear those vents How long do you think itll take Quite some time Wouldnt it be quicker if we all helped Youre right We havent a minute to spare Would you Oh yes ll stay behind d better use the time to finish repairing the laser Why dontyou start on the engines Report no movement of the Proteus since entering quadrant at level This is just what we need Another delay Youll wind up a Hindu They respect all forms of life however small Help Please help There she is Shes damaging those fibres Antibodies will attack any moment Grant The pressure cant Get backto the sub ll get her out Hurry Where are they Theyre belowthe cells of Hensen If the antibodies reach her theyll attack as if she were bacteria Open it Open it before they get here cant till the hatch is flooded Theyre tightening Please cant breathe cant Theyve crystallised Its all right Cora Its all right Theyre on their way again What a time to run out of sugar Looks like quite a way Well reach the base of the brain soon From there its not far to the site of the injury But were running out of time Wheres that light coming from Its from the outside world Filtering in through Beness eardrum That puts us right here Which means we can head for the subarachnoid cavity The Proteus has passed the inner ear and is now in the channel leading to the brain thought d die when the scissors dropped on the floor Its against my better judgement To wait until it may be too late ve done all could with the laser All ask m only asking him that he test it beforehand If it doesnt work its beyond my power to fix it But if it does theres no telling how long itll stand up Its a jury rig at best and well need every second of use we can get out of it Thats why dont want to put extra strain on it by running unnecessary tests Dr Duval insist thatyou test the laser ll do nothing of the sort The operation is my responsibility wont do it All right As usual you want ityour own way Only this time theres more at stake know whats at stake Dr Michaels Imagine Theyre in the human mind Yet all the suns that light the corridors of the universe shine dim before the blazing of a single thought proclaiming an incandescent glory the myriad mind of Man Quite poetic gentlemen Let me know when we pass the soul The soul The finite mind cannot comprehend infinity and the soul which comes from God is infinite Yes but our time isnt If my calculations are correct Doctor whats that up ahead Thats it Thats the site of the injury that dark spot Wed better get prepared There isnt time dont see how you could operate and get out of here before the hours up Captain head for the removal point Removal point What are you talking about Weve only six minutes left Hold it skipper What happens if we overstay Once times up deminiaturisation begins Then within seconds this ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the system Then white corpuscles will destroy it as they would any other invader How long will it take to get from here to the removal point About two minutes That still leaves me four minutes to operate All youll succeed in doing is getting us trapped simply wont hear of it Captain return to the removal point All right Grant what are you doing My powers gone Dr Duval get the laser m in charge You were instructed to take orders not to give them The situation has changed Nothing has so far as my authority goes Weve got to get out of here now Its suicide m not going to let him operate Youre in no condition to make any decision Youre not going through with this forbid it wont allow anyone to leave this ship m going to do all can to save Benes Dont you see whatyouve done Youve given him a perfect opportunity to kill Benes dont believe that Because of all his gibberish about the soul Camouflage thats all that is to blind the gullible and cover up his real identity fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes And now youve made it possible ve come up against fanatics before and Duval doesnt fit the pattern Skipper m going out there to help Remember we need at least two minutes to get out How does it look Doctor If can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels Doctor weve had it If can clear this central nerve that may be enough Captain theres something wrong with the escape hatch What do you mean Fluid is seeping through Have a look at it Fluid There shouldnt be any fluid Yes youll see it underneath the door That should do it Look Its heading for the nerve dont understand The laser Let me have the laser Give me your widest beam Full power The ships finished Well have to get out on our own Is there a quick way out What about Dr Michaels White corpuscles Weve got to get them out Theyll ingest the ship and everything in it Stay here both of you Hold them off if you can What happened Dr Michaels went berserk Berserk nothing Get me out Get this on quick If a window blows well lose this airlock Grant help m trapped Help me Grant cant get my Cant get my hands out Get me out of here My hands are trapped cant move cant move my hands cant move my hands cant move my hands Get me out Get me out of here Get me out Come on its no use Thats the end of the laser You said there was a quick way out We could followthe optic nerve to the corner of the eye Times up Well have to take them out immediately It means killing Benes For all we know they may have completed the operation Damn it to hell Attention please You will remove the Proteus immediately Remove the radar Prepare for trephination Light impulses On the way to the brain Were nearing the eye Hold it Doctor What is it That blip were picking up might only be a radioactive particle The Proteus may already be destroyed What are you getting at If were in their place running out of time d abandon ship before grewto dangerous size and use the extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible On my own Along the optic nerve to the eye Wait seconds Glass slide quick Open that door please
