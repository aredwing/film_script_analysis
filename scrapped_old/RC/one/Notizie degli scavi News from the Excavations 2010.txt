because the Professor wasnt there and neither was his assistant Oh well you can tell me later Yes of course It was really hilarious What are you looking at No was just thinking that sometimes they dont even know if something was there before or if it was made afterward For instance in this academy theres a building thats still standing and theres a flock of sheep now Then there is another building in ruins and sat on them So you start thinking Maybe this one was built before They dont know But what about the sheep There was nobody there What do you mean the sheep You said there were sheep inside the other building Nobody took care of them The dogs were there Why Whats this got to do with anything No nothing You started talking about the sheep thats why asked wasnt talking about the sheep was saying that since sometimes you cant trace back a building even its identification will be arbitrary understand that but since you said that Youre such a bore Most of the time they dont leave them all in one place and whoever takes care of them cant be around so they are left with the dogs know because even in Maglianello in the province of Rieti Wait wait let me Thank you youre very kind Youll be more comfortable this way Thank you So youre from Rieti From the province of Rieti But now live in Rome work at my brotherinlaws company Are you both from Rome Yes or maybe not The
