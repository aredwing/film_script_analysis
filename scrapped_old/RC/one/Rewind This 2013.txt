Thank you Thank you Something about dental movies animated things that they make forabout uhdental hygiene always seem to be really creepy Frank Gorshin is in this movie What Frank Gorshin was of course The Riddler on the original Batman So hate to say it but Were gonna have to buy Game Day starring Richard Lewis Uh the Gorsh factor just hit It just sunk in Titanic Two tape Titanic set again Always You know youre gonna have to rewind it Why not just go ahead and buy a rewinder And there was this thing in the corner next to the that my parents said Its for playing and recording movies saw this thing and thought Well How does it work This sounds like heaven tapes were so widespread and they were so common and so prevalent that think for most people they were just sort of part of the everyday you know background of your life growing up Or if you were an adult during that time frame theyre just something that you had It wasnt until a little you know maybe by or where everybody and their mother had the machine Because wed had just enough Christmases to get the machines in everybodys home Videocassette got me you know hooked on movies loved going to movies as a kid but the tapes bringing those movies home could watch them any time wanted Getting us all together to go to the theater was a big deal and it didnt happen very often We had to get there pay get popcorn all that So home video was the standard for me They opened in our neighborhood this uh video store And it was called Pop Go And my mom is from Mexico and she would call it PoPing So she would alway say Oh Lets go to PoPing And the popcorn was so good remember going and the giant like cardboard cutouts of like movies coming soon And thats the first time ever saw The Toxic Avenger in the giant cutout And was a little kid and was like ve gotta watch this Back then it was huge It was like the Friday night thing to do And it was you know mean you really took your time thinking cause youit was to join You know so it wasnt free to join So d spend my Saturdays get on my little bicycle my Ninja Turtles bicycle and go from one store to the next like looking for this title Whatever it might be And remember specifically really wanted to see Basket Case And none of the video stores had it And so for like months would go to every one and be like Did yous guys get Basket Case yet wanna see Basket Case saw Apocalypse Now is out and went Oh need that And then saw Blood Feast was out And went Oh my God need that And saw Beyond the Valley of the Dolls was out Oh my God need that So bought my first Betamax you know with the top loader with the big piano keys and the remote was attached to a wire You know so it really wasnt even a remote Well video took cinema out of the movie theater So you know it takes a lot of money to build a movie theater It takes a lot of seats You put the seats in you have to get all the people to sit in the seats to make it profitable And so think If you If you say worldwide yeah think it was kind of like a democratization It was a form of wider exposure Its Friday night youre with your friends youre having a sleepover youre at the video store You wanna make each other laugh by finding the dumbest thing possible think that was a huge huge part of it really Sitting around with your friends laughing eating pizza What is better than that It was a very special time where you could all of a sudden be introduced to all of this stuff that never never would have been available Never would have shown on Um never would have been in your movie theater Certainly in a place like Nottingham which is kind of a small city in England grew up on nd Street So had access to movies the average person normally wouldnt have unless guess you lived next door to a drivein or something So loved the fact that was seeing crap that no one had even heard of What surprised me was how much of that crap came out on m very proud to say that have movies that start with dead death and deadly So ve really made it m really a great success in life Above you can see that have my big boxes my oversize clamshells Things like that Um have things alphabetical to keep things simple The way ve done it is color Because to me it looks the most aesthetically pleasing just tried doing it in a Roy Biv kind of way And just came all the way down to black and white also do my books that way And for me its a system that totally works You can ask me any video and can be like Okay that ones green and pick it out And its really easy for me and think it looks really nice This is one of my all time favorites though Corey Haim Me Myself and So good know Corey passed ya know And love Corey m not really even making fun of him but this is the awesomest thing ever The direction in my life right now guess proceed with um in the business is gradually um from being the little boy from a younger you know brother trying to get to be the older brother or the only brother dont know if this is the pride of my collection This is the tape that ve gotten the most fun out of recently Its called Bubba Until it Hurts Its for men and women Its not just another pretty workout and and and and Unlike many exercise programs Bubba Until it Hurts utilizes a minimum of jumping The lack of jumping up and down makes this program ideal for apartment house dwellers Its just like why would you put that on your Like why would that ever be a marketing point And at the end he goes hes like Now that youve met my friends lets get to work love you He says love you love you now lets get to work It is like Whoa Bubba Smith not until it hurts please In order to get to it Youve got to go through it love you and welcome to Until it Hurts We have my favorite movie here have Heavenly Bodies Three copies of it If you love aerobics if you love Canadian features this is exactly where you need to go Rolling Vengeance see its coming right at ya there Its even got a drill right in front because its fuckin badass This is one of my prized possessions The Leslie Nielsen Bad Golf Made Easier signed by Leslie Nielsen dont know if you can get in on the gold signature of the man himself Stand directly in your opponents line and lean imperceptibly to one side or another as he tries to read the break This is a movie called Death Rider This is a shotonvideo western And it is really one of the most impossibly hypnotically awkward things that you will ever see thought you were dead Clayton No thats my brother youre talkin about And its kind of a passion project by this guy Ronald Koontz who is the lead actor writer director editor cameraman and he proudced the film Probably my favorite proudcer is Ronald Koontz Now m getting into all the ones that gasp about The Windows Easy Instruction Video Guide featuring Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston in character Because this was right when Friends started So its all this like Oh really You click on the start window That is pathetic When first started was like Oh man dude have movies It was just like phenomenal to me that could like pick through movies But then got to and pretty soon go to Zombies occult supernatural slasher movies got a slasher closet over there If theres at least three movies that can categorize together m like Okay that can be a subgenre So have one right now its got four movies and its about homeless horror Get a job loser you shit your fuckin pants So thats a little subgenre have ve learned a lot about culture in general just by doing all these little subsections Theres a lot of things you have to search out lot of things you have to look for not even knowing what youre looking for And you might find something that you never knew was out there The video revolution began in Japan in the mids when the engineers at Sony began to develop a tape format And at the same time the engineers at they developed their own Back then you know everything was Betamax And so you went to a store there was always both formats Ridiculously they used to charge more for a tape because you were buying more plastic Really nothing happened in any numbers until when it began to explode Both formats were originally headtohead fighting for the supremacy And it was sort of thought that maybe both could exist together Which proved not to be the case of course bought Beta So you know wasted all these zillions of videos that bought in the Beta format And of course Beta went byebye very soon after If youre looking at videocassette recorders and youre confused by all your choices just look at the most important feature of all The picture And Sony Betamax records a sharper picture than Beta was technically superior but it had one huge flaw which was that it was only one hour long format was two hours long videocassettes play longer which can save you money Big deal One of my closest friends is Robert Harris the restorationist And he was always talking about the latest technologies He was keeping me alerted about the war between Beta and and how the cheaper one was gonna win because the public just doesnt give a shit He was correct When rented The Last Unicorn on Beta and stuck it in my grandmothers player That was not good Thats when understood the difference between and Beta Cause didnt get to watch The Last Unicorn that night For any show like whatever any new show thats out right now of course their goal is Well this is gonna be on its gonna be on Hulu its gonna be watched forever and ever But back then they didnt really realize that Oh and youve missed your football on Anything for you Mom Oh you are a good boy Bye When you have a Phillips television recorder you dont have to miss anything The Phillips television recorder records when you cant watch So you can replay anytime Who the The Phillips television recorder Mums dont think any member of the audience actually said Gee need a machine that will help me control my schedule But once the machine was made then they came up with concept of timeshifting and that was a concept that really worked That you could actually shift the schedule around Theyve made it so simple to use the cat can operate it Kitties want you to record an program at Sony So simple the cat can use it The TiVo age only exists because we were raised with Because we were the first generation that could be sent to bed with a promise Itll be here tomorrow when you get up That changed our relationship with television discovered that uh could program the That was like a big day You know for me Like as a nine yearold to get around the parental controls and tape rated things You can watch your shows when you wanna watch it Thats the advertising campaign that really pushed Betamax to the top of the heap and was a big success for two years until caught up with them With an even better reason to buy it because they could record longer Suppose its over three hours Relax Panasonic tapes up to four hours of sports movies specials on one cassette used that to actually win out in the format war with Sony At a certain moment in time people were like dont like that you can share this thing with people wanna control the mechanism of distribution You know Only programmed on television right you know Only available in movie theaters So when the tape comes out for a ton of the people involved on the manufacturing side its a watershed But theres people in content and distribution before everyone has decks and they can monetize it theyre like dont know if this is a good thing or not So this whole notion of selling something where you lost control entirely was a new notion And it made major movie studios very very nervous Box office kept increasing so its not like people are staying home and avoiding the movie theater Its a new bunch of people putting new money into home video And thats whats really driving this incredible explosion of the film industry in the s The guy who financed Brain Damage for me was a man named Andre Blay and hes credited with starting this He had a company in Michigan called Magnetic Video that was dealing mainly with inch tapes for industrial use And he got the idea one day Wow wonder if could put Hollywood movies on half inch When made the decision to buy movie rights said Well gotta go to all the Hollywood studios And wrote them a letter saying that the home video revolution is about to begin And could help start this new industry So he writes a letter to all the major studios about you know mon give me a film ll put it on tape and well see what happens And no studio was interested They thought it was a crazy idea they thought it was a stupid idea They thought it would devalue the films But Fox said Eh fine let this guy do it If he fails he fails You know who cares Well get some money out of it This is preStar Wars so th Century Fox is probably a company thats not doing that well In any case they hedged their bet They gave him films that were at least four years old The Sound of Music and you know Patton and all that stuff And uh they sold for an exorbitant rate They were like dollars The only world we recognized was getting our films in the theaters Charlie Band was the only one in our circle that was thinking about the home video market So what did was thought Well let me go find or license the rights to other successful independent films Even my lawyer had no real idea of how to write the document cause no documents had been written prior to license these video rights You know what is the territory what is the price No idea It was a pioneering time because nothing existed Next step lets not sell them the prerecorded tapes lets actually rent it to them Andre never anticipated the rental market And he said he remembers the day he got a phone call from a store saying Hey can rent this And he went No And the store says Well my lawyer said can And it was like Oh no You know so that started it And uh the punch line to Andres story was eventually all the studios saw how lucrative the market was They all came out with their own you know label Except for Fox of course So Fox had to buy Andre out They had to buySo he Whatever he bought it for boy he quadrupled that okay The video at that point was kind of taking over for the drivein circuit Video was the new market for the kids to rent the horror films and the films they wouldnt see at the mainstream theater Well definitely dont think that my career would have gone where it had without video My movie was released in all kinds of foreign countries on video If it wasnt for video for me know my popularity would be much much smaller than it is When videocassettes first came in we jumped in we loved it We thought it was great And in fact it was great And there were mom and pop shops there were video stores opening up all over the country all over the world that needed movies In the early days the appetite for video was so pervasive people could pick the wrong location they could pick the wrong videocassette titles they could hire surly staff they could have terrible hours and horrible policies and people were still gravitating to these stores It was just there was such a hunger for it So the idea of having movies that were at your disposal when you wanted them was kind of remarkable And there was no talk of picture quality or aspect ratio or any of that It was just availability So you had to kind of be aware that as much as you wanna use that frame right to the edge you wouldnt Youd kind of give yourself a little cheat on either side cause you knew that when it went to video the edges would be cut off looked at a few of them was appalled at the improper aspect ratios And the lack of rich contrasts and resolution and uh never did buy one And predicted they wouldnt catch on Original aspect ratio never caught on cause people thought they were being gypped ve got black bars on the top and bottom of my picture Yeah Thats so you see the sides They neit never sunk in Now know people that have the widescreen s so if they watch Casablanca they zoom in on it to fill up the picture dont get it dont get it dont get it Sometimes it looks better than the widescreen If you get the of Pat Garrett Billy The Kid its horribly pan and scanned and like they zoom in at times But its got this interesting aesthetic to it which like and actually prefer that You cant make that camera movement with a camera like it only exists in however they used to make the pan and scan So when you saw stuff like that you just thought like That was a weird camera movement dont know enjoy pan and scan It doesnt bother me dont like it when its completely cropped Like where they just cut it off Where they just dont give a shit They just cut the left and right off and then stuff is missing Or when they smoosh it dont like that But like that weird the the weird ones where it moves back and forth think thats pretty good Oh fantastic Closer closer The warmth the wetness Unbelievable This is what its all about This is heat Thisll make me famous We gotta talk about the movement And ve been lucky ve been there at all the innovations ve been here at all the changes We went from a qualitative media to a quantitative media The video concept made it easier but did it make it better dont know It was the very tailend of the theatrical distribution and it was more of um video stores were just popping up all over So you had a lot of independent adult bookstores and business was thriving The video boom came out of the facility to watch this material at home and no longer have to be ashamed theoretically to go to a theater And knew that once this door was open it would never be closed Why dont you move the teddy bear and come sit by me Nah got a better idea why dont you come over here Pardon me Teddy Any major consumer electronics medium its success or failure in the market will be determined based on its relationship with the adult entertainment business And think is where we learned that like the way a film looks but think that video probably makes the end consumer feel like hes a part of the experience What video did change about the porn industry was the idea that since were distributing on video we can shoot on video Changed the economics of that business And made the business so much bigger than it had ever been before What if we took these big boxes you know in their trays and made them smaller and maybe even we could attempt to sell them in alternative markets like airports or bookstores And they were selling like hot cakes And the business took off And thats how we created the sellthrough title Media had this crazy idea of releasing tapes at the then shocking price of They were calling it sellthrough Every other company was going Oh thats a stupid idea its ridiculous You know cause they thought the more money it cost the more money youd make Gee wish theyd sell Basket Case for that Because it would be the only film like that disreputable unrated blood and gore film out on the market And teenagers which were my core audience they couldnt afford but they could all afford bucks Media thought it was a terrible idea They thought it was such a bad idea they said Well do it but if it doesnt move were gonna go right back to the regular price By the time Halloween came around my god Basket Case was everywhere We made a fortune It did spectacular mean bought this apartment This was my down payment that needed from the bank to buy this apartment Suddenly the sellthrough market was born d like to think Basket Case had a lot to do with that It was great for independents because the major studios really caught on very slowly to video And there were so many examples of independent films that were brand new to that audience that were more desirable than the big studio films So many times those little pictures would outperform Not theatrical on and other deals that were happening But when it came to the video market in those early days it was incredible Its the return of cult hero Freddie Krueger And for the past two summers Freddies nightmares have been the nations top video rental titles Now its Freddies third time around and hes all set to claw his way beyond the mark The advent of home video also made companies very successful Very small companies very successful And think thats largely why we have so many insane oddities now is because there would be a huge Hollywood movie that would hit like Indiana Jones or Friday the th and you would get a whole plethora of films that were aping that made for cents Production price tag you know Terminator million Puppetmaster Its like you know its not an even playing field but in the video store theyre all on the same shelf theyre all in the same size boxes Look if idiots like Troma can make a movie that sells million and millions of dollars of videocassettes well then anybody can do it Distribution was handled very differently There were a lot more distributers There were people that were willing to experiment in home video It was so new that it felt like the wild west It felt like anybody could get a foothold and be a major player in distribution was approached by a couple of producers who Wanted to produce a video which would go straight to home video And this was something new My idea was would create an electronic aquarium People found this intriguing Here was this new thing that used this new medium that had been created What really think caused the early explosion in video was Jane Fondas workout tape And now count to four Heels forward And then one two three So this was a tape that did something original which was gave you an opportunity to exercise in your home in front of your by yourself Dont need to go to a gym It was a very good concept And it had never really been done before Well the early days of video it was a sellers market It was great mean they couldnt get enough This was a worldwide exposure and there was a window where if you made a clever movie and it was relatively well done and it was in the right genre you know it was an action film or horror or scifi you would make some money So it was Toei which is one of the traditional major studios in Japan that sort of launched this straighttovideo market Whereas in the largely video was for a very long time sort of demonized by the traditional studios Vestron Video they were very aggressive If you had a movie and you went to some place life the American Film Market or Cannes and the video rights for your movie were not locked up almost immediately youd be visited by a salesperson from Vestron saying Here heres a million dollars right up front give me the movie In the initial stages you would go into a store and find something that you wanted You wouldnt see a commercial you wouldnt read anything in the magazine or newspaper mean it was just that new All these stores were opening up and they needed to fill the shelves with new titles So there was this huge demand It didnt matter if they were good or bad You have a pretty flourishing industry thats based on renting video tapes to thousand video rental stores across the country Most often mom and pop operations Charlie would have title contests for his employees And if you came up with a title that he used youd get So everybody would come up with or titles and he would narrow it down to like a hundred and then he would commission box art And then Austin Furst would come in from Vestron He would just come into the room and hed go around and say ll take that one and that one and that one and that one And then Charlie would bring the writers and directors in and then say want you to do this one and that one That was an era of great equivalency at video stores think people would rent anything with a cover that interested them It wasnt about studio it wasnt about movie star it wasnt about budget When youre looking at a shelf its very democratic The best cover catches your eye One thing do is go to video stores whenever m in them and find the movie and pick it out and put it flat so its facing front little extra advertising cant hurt really do m like looking around to see that nobody looks lot of them picked just on the cover art Malone Thats a cover buy Have watched it m not gonna lie to you and tell you ve watched this movie But if this happens somewhere in it then its a good movie Also theres something to be said about something so large you could kill a small child with this Like you could bludgeon somebody to death with this That was a handful when you bought one of those And it left a lot of space for a really good artist to actually create something that in itself was a work of art When you did a major film it was fun to see it Its the kind of job that a lot of illustrators really cherish and love to do It used to have a battery and youd press the button and then Frankenhooker says Wanna date Um Because thats one of her catchlines catchphrases in the movie Wanna date Shes a Frankenhooker have the box but it doesnt work anymore But it was this talking box And youd press here and youd hear a voice go Wanna date When you push the button on the box she goes Wanna date It was obsessive You just sat there Wanna date Wanna date Wanna date Wanna date When this was in the stores thats all people were doing think the talking box did more to sell the movie than the movie did If you only see one movie this year it should be Frankenhooker Of course it should be mean you see things that are like wow this box art is not selling And especially being a buyer for as long as have can really look at stuff and go This box art will sell this movie Looking at those like Maniacs just the blood coming out of the mouth or the Color Me Blood Red with the woman like just totally splayed Guts hanging out was just like That is for me People have a certain amount of nostalgia for kinda old stuff And some of it was pretty great Most of it was awful mean if youre objective about it There are terrible terrible unspeakably bad movies that have some of the best covers ve ever seen admire the fact that those companies figured out Man all we gotta do is wrap it nicely This was ultimately used as a video cover for Chevy Chase Funny Farm Sometimes its just the simpler image that read better It was a great way for so many artists to make a living and there was a lot of great art produced especially during the s and s We would fight to get our name in there and some would allow it and others would take it out And so wed kinda hide it in somewhere My name is in the hair If you turn it upsidedown and have a look at it youll see it When somebody does kind of a cheap fast photoshop heres a bunch of floating heads you know buy it because these actors are in it Like that artwork isnt gonna move the needle at all dunno what happened mean they actually used to use color dont see color all that frequently Its like theyre designing shit for dogs think that everyone forgot how awesome a painted cover is of a dude with his shirt off holding a machine gun Why would you take a photo of that when you can paint a beautiful portrait of it Thats the stuff thats gonna keep it out of the mainstream You know the big box stores dont want that painted artwork The amount of work was given from the movie studios really started to slow down in the early s Then all of a sudden they said that had to learn how to do it on a computer or they couldnt use me anymore Once mastered the tool of the computer was able to create what did before maybe even a bit better Dont give me art cant stand art The worst covers on the planet Criterion m sorry guys Theyre the most boring covers ever made How could you not wanna see this How could you not wanna own this My god you know this this is a cover Yeah Yeah Criterion go fuck yourself This is how you sell it So by home video is giving as much money to Hollywood as the box office And its all new money th Century Fox is bought up by the News Corporation Paramount is bought up by Viacom Because of home video you actually have Sony an electronics manufacturer deciding never to lose a format war again And the way to do that was to buy up a film studio So they bought Columbia So by the s you have a new landscape of media conglomerates And they represented that film was switching over to a major brand That you can spinoff from film into many different markets with the sales of videos music toy action figures etcetera etcetera etcetera You know were down now to the same basic five or six corporate pipelines that supply almost all of our media and unfortunately theyre not voracious enough to sort of reach outside their own catalogues So you dont have that sort of hunger in the marketplace anymore Blockbuster came in and they took over And they really got rid of all the mom and pop chains Its name says it all It was about blockbusters Thats all they were interested in Video rental is gone You know that was the dominant way of seeing films you know years ago And its dead Even though we lost all that yes we have the internet m not gonna say that the internet isnt great Its incredible In some ways its almost worth it Yeah theres definitely a sense of loss of course think But its awesome to see the places that are still around like Cinefile Odd Obsession Scarecrow Heart Video Vulcan Theyre still going strong This is our video tape costume that we have someone who uh gets in and jumps around during the trivia contests that we do And its pretty easy to get on you just slide it Kinda like this And jumps around like that We were thinking of hiring some guy to just be on the sidewalk and just waving at people But nobody wants to do that for minimum wage What had because it dominated for so long was just an appetite They had to fill those shelves They had to have new product out And so distributers reached deep into their catalogues and they had to That was think the greatest era of discovery had an unusually long life for a home video format And think that is something that well never see happen again Well never see BluRay dominate the market for years It just wont happen When first started it was like m a college grad ve had a business and now m gonna work in a flea market People would ask me in church or whatever sell movies at the flea market And its like Ugghh The funny thing about digging through all of Waynes stuff at the house Is that theres no separation whatsoever between genres Basically youll have like The Brave Little Toaster and then Enormous Wangs of The Northern Yukon er whatever and theyre just like right next to each other cause theyre both oversize boxes Thats a great film you should check that one out Were The Picture Show Been here since Got lots of customers that were kids would come in their parents would buy em kids movies are now married and bringin in their kids So thats the biggest thing that keeps me goin And so have people comin in most of them over or that still like still buy thats what they want And then young guys like you who are collectors and they want the old stuff and they wanna get into all that This is a typical buyer Uh kind of lowclass Heres a movie about a donkey named Paco Hell steal your heart and your wallets Wayne charges a lot for his Like you know way more than anyone else in America probably charges for their Its like a flat rate of bucks if he likes you bucks if he doesnt And theres no way on earth that Paco is worth bucks He actually is stealing my wallets You gotta have the real movie people The people that know you cant get this stuff on Netflix or whatever Yeah And those people are fewer and fewer ve just kept on keepin on But you have a personal fondness for m sure Oh sure Yeah still watch And if ve got a choice to watch somethin got all this new stuff around here but ll end up watchin an old movie You know to me its like an old friend We display about titles on We display about titles on Probably up there have another duplicates and around here in the two rooms probably have close to another So thats over yeah probably at least maybe And dont really know m not countin em This is the video room inside Waynes house which is like total chaos Like the earth has vomited up you know video stores You do the best out in the country You dont wanna be in town Youre fightin all the Best Buys and the WalMarts and on and on Up there m the biggest movie thing to a lot of people comin in from a or mile radius We can talk intelligently about percent of the movies up there and weve probably seen three percent of em If you dont know then you go hear its a good movie Or Yeah thats a real good thats a pretty good movie Are you ever honest and say hear its terrible No no no no no no Thats absolutely a nono And you go Its a pretty box look at the box Well most of it youve just heard people tell you it sucks but you dont know it cause havent seen it Nothin was more depressing to me than to wake up on January first and know exactly what youre gonna make want to at least have the possibility of makin or makin But at least dont know Its still out there This home video system has every single function you will ever need It was made by the people who invented home video system so advanced its used in more sets around the world than any other But the best invention is our cordless remote control unit which puts every function of the machine itself into the palm of your hand came out and the rewind button was introduced That was pretty much revolutionary for filmmakers cause you could just easily with the press of a button just go back and constantly rewatch how Tom Savini stuck an arrow through someones chest You could go back and pause it and look at it closely Also understand and dissect the structure of editing Because usually editing is designed to be very seamless and you couldnt figure out how shots would be put together to create a flow and an effect and a gag especially or a stunt Its really increased the ability for people to understand the language of film kind of think taught a lot of people about the nature of film the nature of editing the nature of sound and how those things mattered Not on purpose but on accident like Oh okay this tape is falling apart Oh cause its a physical medium Well why is that Oh because its just magnetic oxide stuck to a tape in a predetermined pattern Oh okay Instead of having stacks of film books we had stacks of tapes Thats what helped us discover our love for cinema its what inspired us to go start shooting our own movies And remember even cutting my first films on two players Everyone had a deck in their house in the s That was mean everyone that knew did So you record something you put it on a tape you can share it with everybody You could just leave the camera running and you were also aware that it was easy to record sound Um so that was really revolutionary And for someone who was raised on home movies on film the idea of video was almost magical it felt like this was too good to be true Think about film history classes Film Whatever university youve been in whatever high school the first films you looked at were the Lumiere films Youve got a train coming into a station Youve got factory workers leaving a factory and youre feeding a baby These are the canonical titles of early cinema that every textbook has And they are home movies made my first feature on when was would dress up my brothers in like a gorilla costume or we made fake guts that came out or we did a fake episode of Cops Its mostly unwatchable and its mostly deeply embarrassing Papa was a rolling stone Yes he was He was a rolling stoone Before that it seemed like well making a movie is like this whole different thing Theres no way that you could ever do that Thats what people in Hollywood do But then when figured out you can just get a video camera and you make this movie and you can show it to your friends like the next week that was so exciting And then was kinda hooked Well this sucks Come on lets go have a party or something Eh this is dumb m bored Waste of time But think it was the fact that it was so accessible it was the fact that it was universal Its like Alright well lets go skate and m just gonna bring the camera with me It wasnt like this whole production You know and think in the grand scheme of things well understand that there was the invention of film and that that became domestic at one point but that distinction between what was mm film and what was home video think was just this weird you know maybe year blip in our evolution was saw the movie when it first came out and really was overcome by just Indiana Jones the character himself and the world that he inhabited You know being a single kid and kinda nerdy you know wanted to create worlds for myself That was my motivation And then getting together with my friend Eric Zala we wanted to recreate this Raiders film And of course when you have a passionate idea you find the tools to do it Eric had more of a drive to see a shotforshot remake of Raiders in its entirety think for myself maybe it was that idea But think for me it was more just wanna play Indiana Jones We worked from memory for the first three years Video stores werent as readily available You just couldnt get stuff And so you were left to your own to go back to the theater and see the film again We bought the script that was published we bought fan magazines snuck a tape recorder into the movie theater just to get sound effects and ended up getting thrown out And then when the film came out on laserdisc in or we watched it and realized we were pretty close The whole seven year project really we just did it for ourselves But theres a nostalgia there for this generation of filmmakers that were teaching themselves on Betamax Something as simple as setting up your Barbie dolls you know or that could be something as complicated as wanting to remake Raiders of the Lost Ark in its entirety will always have a historical place because it was the first way in which images were circulated and duplicated in a costeffective way There were not the economic constraints that were associated with imagemaking before Thats revolutionary remember renting some of those sort of lowrent titles in the mom and pop video stores But then you would get em home and they would have this look like This doesnt look like a real movie this doesnt look like a real film Kinda looks like news or something And youd get like a shotonvideo movie that would give every appearance of being a real movie but it wouldnt be Wake up bitch No No This isnt real Theres something about like watching something shotonvideo It makes you feel mofor me like couldit feels theres more of like a voyeuristic thing cause you associate it with home movies And so then when you see a movie made on video you kinda get this feeling like youre seeing something that maybe you werent supposed to Everybody was like You know you gotta shoot it on film what are you doing You cant shoot a feature on video m gonna take my time with this were gonna treat this like a movie Just the fact that its being shot on Super is gonna be irrelevant Sledgehammer they made it on for And think as far as know its the first one like that And made with a sense of professionalism like Maybe this is the new way was here in Ohio doing it and guys like Tim Ritter were down in Florida you know doing the same thing and he was going doortodoor to video stores But eventually you had guys that cracked the nut at Blockbuster and were getting stuff on Blockbuster store shelves The unprofessional quality of the shotonvideo movies to me is what makes them beautiful and makes them dunno its weird its like they were trashy back then but now theres an artistic quality Aaaaaaah

constructive with your time said Mom you cant stop me from makin movies because you know m gonna do it anyway The infamous glitch that all video store owners know When youre watching and theres a glitch and youre like Oh its gonna get nude in two seconds Heres a news flash nudity was gigantic with teenage boys It was a big thing back in the s Watching a video tape as a kid when you can start to see the lines rolling through the picture you know that someones watched it a lot at that point and you know that theres gonna be tits coming on soon You get ready you sit up in your chair cause you think Holy shit some fuckin weird pervert has watched this part so many times that m ready for the money shot When you watch a tape theres almost like a archeology Where theres history written into the physical material of the thing itself You get to see the parts that are really beat up You know that someone rewound that and watched it over and over Its like the part where theres boobs or the part where the guy explodes You know that was someones favorite part and they couldnt get enough That was the first think anybody had the power over being able to see boobs again and again and again and again and again Cable had been a reality in our lives so you could see boobs but then they were gone And they were just a golden memory had a video tape of Kentucky Fried Movie and lent it to a friend And when he gave it back it was like every minutes or something it would just go And d be like You watched all those nude scenes over and over again in one weekend Because now my tape is ruined But its also kind of funny And whenever watch it can think of you being gross and hilarious My Ghostbusters tape bet people cant even make out the whole scene where he goes came saw kicked some ass because thought that was the greatest shit ever rewound that scene was like Whoa he kicked some ass that is what Ghostbusters do We had a guy at one of our video stores that worked at where we eventually had to cancel his membership because we figured out it was him But his hobby was renting childrens movies and then splicing in pornography in the middle of them and returning them to us So theyd go back on our rental shelves have finished planting detonators We have less than two minutes It entertained this guy And with that was a tangible thing he could do it to My friend lent me a tape of a movie he taped for me recently went all the way to the end of the tape just to see how many layers of things has he taped over And you kinda catch the tailend of a movie from Cinemax or like a music video or this show all the way to the something that was taped originally from And it was really great just to see who this guyyou know what he was watching for the past years Lawrence of Arabia is one of my favorite films And when go see a print of that in the theater every scratch every break every place you see a splice theres a story behind that Something happened with that movie something happened with that print when it was shown to an audience And theres something about that that to me cause you know that prints had some life and some legs on it could do that Its almost like has a builtin hit counter In that like you can tell how many times its been copied by the way that it looks And so you knew that when you got a tape if you were in tape trading like the shittier it looked and the worse it sounded you just knew it was gonna be gold because that meant that people before you had copied it and thought that it was funny enough or great enough or weird enough to make a copy and then pass it to their friends who thought the same thing So it was like this vetting process you know where Uh this distillery of images or something So that by the time you got it it was like potent and you know gonna get you high Priest is bad man Priest is number one in heavy metal man And then who comes next Iron Maiden man What would you say if you saw Rob Halford right now d jump his bones What do you think uh What do you like about him Hes great man he sings great Groups great How bout Dokken Great Excellent Are you fucked up The Southpark Christmas Special never had a copy of that and somebody knew had it and they were like Really You dont have a copy Thats crazy Everybody has a copy of this And so was like Well make me a copy You know just come on if everybody has it give me one remember the guy being like Well what do you have for me And that was the first moment where was like Oh Thats right tape trading The Winnebago concepts and engineering departments have developed a multifunctional bathroom privacy dont even know what the fuck m reading wonder what the fuck the real dialogue is What the fuck is this thing Oh the windshield for fucks sake gave that guy a collection had gotten from somebody else that had Winnebago Man on it That had Larry Williams it had Jesco It had the Jackass pilot The best of the worst of Star Search which was really awesome And got the Southpark Christmas Special Dude What Dont put the magic hat on the snowman Cause if you do hes gonna come to life Cool No its not cool My sister in Minnesota put a hat on a snowman and it tried to kill her Fuck him lets do it anyway Yeah decided to get in this business One it was economics didnt have really a job was working at a porno theater d just had a son What am gonna do with my life So the very first thing did was the obvious took out a little ad titles Mexican horror titles and some other obscurities ran that ad for a couple months The first week got like in the mail was like Oh my god Make my copies send em out And then the next week the next week Oh my god this is insane So quit my job and started being a bootlegger Youd read someones ad in a magazine and youd respond and you would write down what you had and what he had and you would trade And youd make a copy and it was usually bad four or five generations later but youd still get to see the movie you wanted And what started happening as started to get into more and more extreme type of films is things would be taken by customs It was really funny because theyve got this checklist and it said Your product has been seized by Canada customs And remember twice ordered tapes that got seized at the border And one of them was Nekromantik The necrophilia box was checked If you were ordering a movie that was banned or prohibited youd have the guy tape like an episode of All in the Family for like the first five or ten minutes Of course youre not gonna have the tape labeled Degradation of the Shit Eaters Volume Hes gonna put you know All in the Family Reruns or something like that That was a pretty solid trick To me it wasnt offensive in any way because these films were impossible to find And what they were doing was helping spread these movies and getting them out to people to actually see them think thats why in the market in the beginning you were seeing large units of things move because they could go to a convention like this and say Oh okay those guys were moving that many bootlegs or that many trades amongst them Its a safe bet to put out a nice remastered copy But think it was an important time and a lot of movies were discovered by trading And in the case specifically of Dead Next Door there was such a long window of time from the time it was made to the time it actually came out that it was bootlegged a lot But it benefitted the movie because everybody found out about it that way We didnt have to go out and do a bunch of publicity the publicity came to us Its kinda funny you know m dealing with these companies think they know maybe they dont but feel kinda gyou know maybe bootlegged some of their stuff in the past and now m dealing with them on a professional level playing their movies in the theater but these guys all know mean any guy thats gonna be hypocritical and say you know well the first time you saw Cannibal Holocaust was via a pirated tape And talk about cruelty to animals McDonalds has to be on top of the list mean when you think about those poor little McChickens walking around without their McNuggets think the appeal of this type of material that definitely encouraged and helped spread these viral videos are that they capture something authentic that wasnt meant to be captured We finally go to the point think in the last five years where just everything truly is ours now Where when you put something out there m sorry its justits not yours anymore Its everyones Before you would have and in a way it was patriarchal and it was problematic cause you would have to wait for someone else to approve of what you were saying and presenting and have to go through that whole dance But in that there was a pre selection process so that by the time something got to the screen you knew that someone thought that it was worth something You look at YouTube and youre like love cat videos could spend a good portion of and perhaps do spend a good portion of my day watching cat videos Cat videos have always been important If you look at what people were shooting on film for home movies in the s and s they were filming their cats But think the incredible pressure now is to understand what it is you need to watch And the orthodoxy comes really from what other people are clicking into And then the question is Well how do they find that And how is that discovered Duane was wondering what fashion trends do you follow Well usually look in magazines or see what the kids at school are wearing Duane Already you can see a remix culture appropriating different clips to do different things with it besides just what the producers in a centralized industry such as Hollywood or the New York television networks do with it dont watch stuff that hate and then put it on there which think a lot of people think for Everything is Terrible They think Oh it sucks so you gotta put it up there Its like no dont wanna put anything up unless its incredible Crack cocaine Coke And this is what you smoke it in Its awesome Makes you feel good all over Yes some of the stuff we do doesnt show people in the best light ever But they did produce that stuff to begin with were just spitting it back out m Fabio m Micky Dolenz m Al Michaels m retarded Hey Toby you da man Oh Mr White m just a tire Theres so much undiscovered stuff still How can we share that with everybody Lets just organize this as best we can because thats really all it is is just kind of taking control over those tapes Whoo Thats right little buddy Get away Oh my god So its fascinating that these technologies you know leapfrog each other building new uses And none of this is driven by people really anticipating what the new use will be Its almost like you have to build a machine and then see what people do with it Theres really no need for archaic things like cable anymore Stuff like that Its like Why would you do that when you can literally watch whatever you want at any time guess there are people that are collectors and put things on their shelves and it reflects who they are and think that thats a loss But um think that therell be virtual ways for us to collect and were gonna figure that out m sure studios are really excited about the way things are going about the fact that theres not going to be physical media mean the Walt Disney corporation you know is made up of lovely people but that whole idea of The Disney Vault Were putting The Lion King back in the Disney Video Vault so you cant buy it again for a while Its a completely artificial sense of scarcity designed to create a completely artificial sense of demand Studios are now completely dominating what is available to you And they are completely in control of what you can have And they can give that to you and they can take that away like a malevolent god It infuriates me The notion of somebody else having control over my access to media in general bothers me When read the story about the Kindle and how all the people who had purchased it couldnt have been a more ironic title George Orwells woke up one morning because of a licensing disagreement it was gone It just wasnt on their Kindle anymore Thats terrifying That is absolutely not in the spirit of purchasing something That word becomes meaningless at that point You dont purchase digital media You rent it And its at their pleasure The reality is all physical media is going away All of it On a business standpoint if it takes off itll be good for us because we wont have manufacturing We wont have to do all those extras and the supplements and the interviews and the documentaries and the paper labeling and the shipping So you think about it and it sounds like a great idea But then it kinda goes against what like And you know collecting With Netflix with torrenting its hard to want to go out to a video store Like its hard for me at this point dont really go to the video store as much as d like to anymore This is where we keep most of our video tapes Sadly had to the other day move them all to make room for BluRay boo ray If was a short lifespan BluRays gonna be like gone before you know it Honestly the primary reason to keep something physical is nostalgia Well continue to put out physical media until the plants close My year old students who love film are passionate about film seem to have no interest in having a video collection You cant begrudge this generation not wanting to collect this because its too accessible It seems to be splitting down the middle to people who are going to go to the ends of the earth to keep the old stuff the old ways And then its the other side that are just they dont want anything anymore Its gotta be nonphysical media that they can keep on a hard drive or just have it streamed to em and forget about it And then the other guys that are going to build a shrine have more than enough to keep me busy for lifetimes Um for future generations dont give a fuck about those people love streaming as a technology m gonna hang on to my Ds m gonna hang on to my BluRays Just as as much as love iTunes and Spotify still have a record player because like it People stopped buying video as soon as the content was cheaper and even easier to consume And then we found out that the masses dont care about bonus features or optimum quality Its only the collector market that does Netflix Instant is a really important step towards what the studios want And think what youll eventually do is youll have a pipe that comes into your house and you will subscribe to whichever libraries you want The library the Warner Brothers library the Sony library Thats where were headed were headed towards no money on their end in terms of physical units mean imagine its just all gonna be on access eventually Well technically it already is but people some people dont wanna admit it Were talking about but only have video tapes because thats the way that can find that movie And if that came out in a different manner like if that was available on a or only on BluRay d watch it mean now that m a film programmer m more aware theres films where the filmmaker doesnt have any other materials So essentially until somebody finds a negative finds a print the best source in the world is a Which is a little scary Video preservation is the nightmare in the closet that no one is talking about Everybody likes to talk about film preservation Martin Scorsese is out there you know proclaiming the love of film and all this but in actual fact everybody knows that in Scorseses back closet hes got a lot of videos that are just a hot mess think that most people that really started collecting in the s are probably going to see at least two out of ten tapes begin now years on years on to really not be playable And maybe thats one of the reasons that nostalgia for video is going to be so incredibly poignant think going forward is that were gonna have such a great great statistic of loss It seems like with each iteration in home video technology we lose a chunk of the library of amazing films that are out there dont understand how people can ignore because theres such a huge huge percentage of movies that never came out any other way So if youre even like a casual fan of movies at all you should have a You should be actively watching stuff on There are hundreds of thousands of thousands of movies that never made the jump to Think that the fact that it never jumped to that they were poor quality to begin with No matter what genre of film youre interested in youre going to find things that are only on within that realm of interest So if you like silent film theres gonna be some obscure Russian short thats only on some tape on a back shelf of a video store If you like s comedies theres gonna be hundreds and hundreds of just the most ridiculous boner jams that you can only watch on tape To select what you love by its format cuts you off from something that you might enjoy more than anything youve ever seen in your entire life think that stuff is the stands outside of my objections Thats very important that there is a document of all those countless hours of rare stuff In any form whatsoever even When it struck us that other people could have fun watching movies that were only on video we started Video Hate Squad And we had our first show and we got the whole audience there we have a on the stage so we always put the tape in the in front of the audience so theyre all part of that moment Even better than that is that all over the world theres other people that did the same thing at the same time cause theres this kind of a zeitgeist where people are realizing Hey theres a lot of value in this stuff that weve been ignoring mean for example a movie like Deadly Prey dont think anyone ever knew it even came out It was meant to be this fleeting thing Lets just fill these stores with content We dont have to worry about if theres theatrical releases or not What they didnt realize is that there were so many works of art Grrrrrr Aaaaaaah Thats an incredible incredible film and we played a copy cause its not available on film or or anything No other format We had Ted Prior come and we had a talk with him and it was just incredible to see this movie with a bunch of people and just realize no one knows whats gonna happen next this is completely unpredictable knew that collecting was kind of becoming popular again The House of the Devil you gotta give a lot of due to that just the fact that a new movie was released on it started making me think about a lot other films like this You know had a modest collection but this kinda kick started it for me a lot Okay well theres people who have this kind of interest so lets market to them as well The revolution is still evolving Um think mean youre making a documentary about video tapes right now think that theres a huge resurgence For example Mondo putting out all these new video tapes that are selling through hundreds of copies in a two hour period Clearly theres still a market out there for video tapes The boom thats going on today with the tapes m going on now m seeing these tape prices going for It makes me regret getting rid of some of the stuff that had at one time you know could be putting my kids through college dont know When s had a resurgence in the s what was amazing about that is that it didnt go away Like theres still stores that really just exist to sell records But dont think that is going to have that same permanent resurgence We can make arguments for the quality of a vinyl and why that presents a better experience of the music But its never going to be a better experience of the raw materials its just the qualities associated around it think that theres a nostalgic need to sort of go back and also reevaluate It was in when History of Violence came out on and kind of marked the end of everything That was the last widely distributed film on My friend Zack called me and was like Hey were thinking about getting some tattoos cause they just stopped making And d never had a tattoo before but it took me less than two seconds to be like Yep m with you guys m gettin that right there And we all got ours a little differently like some got like never forget on it some got the year that it started and ended just wanted just the video on its own just like the coldjust the nice It looks so strong and great And people ask me all the time theyll be like What is that on your arm ll just show it to them and theyll be like and m like You forgot obviously When you find some of these stores that have big box video tapes you know theyre gonna be mutant owners who have been surrounded by these relics for so many years And they are part of their life story and am slowly trying to drain them of them And like an archeologist every once in a while youd pull all these tapes out and at the very bottom covered in dust mean literally your hands would be just caked in this dust you pull out a video thats pure gold If see a flea market a swap meet an antique store a Goodwill Its getting stopped and its getting pillaged That entails looking in the phone book looking on the internet Literally driving up and down every single street that see ve driven probably a three hour drive radius every direction And honestly think that is what the legacy of the era is its made us all much more film savvy Its kind of made people much more aware of other movies beyond the ones that were fed by the richest companies The fact that it made accessible all these generations of films which were utterly gone mean just gone No one could see them You know the studios kept them in the vaults sometimes they got rid of the negatives didnt think it mattered anymore You know home video restored all that for us you know and perhaps not always in the greatest looking form mean perhaps not always the way we remembered it but it was accessible dont think theres any lasting impact think its been just a passing parade Its like whats the lasting impact of radio Right Eh You know it got us to the next step the next step These are not just entertainment and theyre also indications of what life was like and is like and is possibly going to be like again These movies by being in a way the record of our dreams are a way to look at our culture and say Ahhh thats why that civilization ate itself spectacularly Thats why it all fell apart Hmm Or Thats what it could have been thats where the dream could have gone When you look at a tape and it has the be kind rewind sticker on it theres something deeply moving about that Its such a call to arms and a suggestion or an imperative about a way to live your life To be kind and rewind Go back and like hang on to these things that are important to you and not let them disappear and not let other people take them a way from you But find whats important and preserve that and help it to endure
