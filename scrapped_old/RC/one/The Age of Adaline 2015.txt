cottage where year old Fleming was waiting up for her when something highly unusual occurred something almost magical snow fell in Sonoma County California The immersion in the frigid water caused Adalines body to go into an anoxic reflex instantly stopping her breathing and slowing her heartbeat Within minutes Adaline Bowmans core temperature had dropped to degrees her heart stopped beating At a bolt of lightning struck the vehicle discharging half a billion volts of electricity and producing amperes of current Its effect was threefold First the charge defibrillated Adaline Bowmans heart Second she was jolted out of her anoxic state causing her to draw her first breath in minutes Third based on Von Lehmans principle of electron compression in deoxyribonucleic acid which will be discovered in the year two thousand thirtyfive Adaline Bowman will henceforth be immune to the ravages of time she will never age another day As the years passed Adaline credited her unchanging appearance to a combination of a healthy diet exercise heredity and good luck Adaline Miriam hello My god you havent changed a bit Oh thats very kind of you to say Fleming youre all grown up Thats
