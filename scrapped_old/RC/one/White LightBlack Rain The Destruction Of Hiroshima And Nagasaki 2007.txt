c BitShockorg What historical event occurred on August l dont know Do you lm bad at history l dont know l dont know l dont know l dont know Do you We dont know Something important happened An earthquake For a very long time l was afraid to talk about my experience Why did l survive l was so close to ground zero lve come to realize the reason lm alive is to tell people what happened so theyll understand popular magazine asked me to create a comic about my life The response was so great the editor asked me to turn it into a fulllength project Thats how Barefoot Gen got started The bright flash We were hit by the blast l was years old l remember it so well lt had such a huge impact on my life l remember every detail lf l had to recreate it as a movie set l could At the time l was years old And l was Our orphanage had about babies We were the oldest kids so we had to help with the infants washing and folding the diapers We were friends before the bomb Since we were little right We grew up together Our bond comes from eating out of the same pot everyday l was in the first grade when the war began The war dominates every single memory l really dont have any happy memories All l remember is the fear and the running and hiding The memory of being with my family has faded away l carried this pain in my heart that l couldnt talk about Even now l cant say my sisters name aloud lt hurts too much l was at the time No one was allowed to see the emperors face He was considered a descendant of God At school there was a portrait of him We would bow and pay our respects That was the Japanese way l was years old l was a university student As men lt was our duty to go to war to die to fall like petals off a flower that was our destiny The army was in Hiroshima so whenever the soldiers passed us we had to bow to them The air was full of patriotism Bravely l left my hometown and went off to war ln l was a doctor at Hiroshima Army Hospital At the start of the war with America many Japanese were excited believing that we were winning But then their sons began dying one after another Mothers and wives began to feel an increasing anxiety as the war continued Though the government kept saying we were winning the people realized Japan couldnt win Even as kids we understood we were losing the war Any fool could see it We didnt have anything We needed everything We didnt even have shoes How could we win the war Lets see at the time l was years old During the war Japan confiscated all of Koreas rice So there was nothing for Koreans to eat They had to come here or starve Thats how l encountered the bomb There was a slogan that said Desire nothing until we win the war Everyday combat planes flew over but we just continued playing Each airplane had a particular sound l could tell the difference Everyday from morning to night we heard air raid sirens but Hiroshima wasnt bombed l wasnt afraid Even when the s flew over l would just say Oh theres an airplane Hiroshima was fairly safe until the atomic bomb On the day of the bomb the air raid siren sounded but then it was cancelled So everyone came out and went on with the day l was years old l was digging out an air raid shelter in preparation for a possible attack so wed have a place to hide l was years old at the time l worked at the post office sorting and delivering the mail At that moment l was on my bicycle about to deliver a letter When l woke up that morning l was already late for work l had to get back to the hospital ld just arrived at school and l realized ld forgotten my books At ld just arrived at school and l was changing my shoes Since we were Catholic we were at church We had just given confession My mother was on the second floor putting the laundry on the clothes line Downstairs my older sister was getting ready for school My father was also downstairs reading the newspaper before he went to work My little brother Susumu was years old He was sitting by the front door playing with his toy boats We were eating and suddenly we saw the flash Everything was enveloped in this enormous flash People talk about the flash and the thunderous sound l didnt hear anything The light streamed in and filled the room Suddenly we felt the blast and were thrown into the air We tumbled hit the wall Then l passed out l was buried under the house and knocked unconscious The heat blast knocked me down l flew through the house l knew l was flying because l could see the floor moving below me l flew feet past a field over a road and into a rice field My mind was blank The only thing l knew was l had to find a safe place Those who saw it up close they all died Few people saw it as l did from a safe distance Out of nowhere a bright red circle of fire formed ring white cloud formed lt grew huge and kept expanding until it touched the ring and turned into a ball of fire Everyone calls it a mushroom cloud But it wasnt a cloud lt was a pillar of fire huge pillar of fire l woke up and looked around l saw an incredible sight People with their eyes hanging out People who were completely burned Their skin was shredded and hanging off their bodies Please help me please help me they cried out People with no arms no legs their intestines spilling out brains spilling out of their crushed skulls And near ground zero there were black carbonized bodies burned beyond recognition People in unimaginable states So many dead One woman was carrying a baby The baby had no head l was so scared The woman said Give me water l felt paralyzed What could l do l was years old l had to take care of my sister So l left the woman and went to help my sister At our orphanage there were a lot of little babies Most of them died instantly crushed when the building collapsed Although some were alive for awhile they did not survive My sister had passed out l tapped on her head and yelled at her until she came to She started crying for our mother Mommy help us Mommy help us We huddled together calling Mommy We cried for help but no one came From under the rubble my father cried for help My sister was already dead She was crushed to death when the house collapsed My little brother was trapped under the house Flames swallowed our house My little brother was screaming Mother lts hot lts so hot You could hear him as he died My mother told my brother l will die with you Luckily a neighbor came by and pulled her away He said Please Mrs Nakazawa you cant die with them We walked out onto the playground lt was a sea of fire All Hiroshima was burning There was no escape except to the river The flames were jumping at us so l put my head underwater The river was full of dead bodies We stayed there and watched the city burn When the hysteria died down l realized my skin was dangling off my arm and the clothes on my back were gone l said lm burned With all my might l tried to get up but l couldnt stand much less walk Someone carried me on his back and laid me down under a tree All around me people were dying They told us their names and asked us to contact their families Then they asked for water and they died The children were crying Even though their parents were dead they still cried for their mothers Mama please give me water Then theyd fall over and suddenly they were silent Thats how l killed two people l gave them water and they died You cant drink it that fast when youre completely dehydrated The body gives out But l didnt know that As l was getting the water black rain started falling lt covered everything turning everything black Of course we didnt know it was radioactive l wanted water so badly but l couldnt speak When night came it drizzled So l licked the water off the tree and fell asleep The next morning there was no one alive around me Back then during the war we had water tanks for putting out fires One after another people piled in to escape the fire The tanks were stuffed with bodies l cant describe what l witnessed l dont have the words lts like when you burn a fish on the grill Thats what they looked like to me as a child The boys face was swollen His eyes were gone His body was completely burned His skin was shredded and falling off l couldnt believe it was my brother We used a wooden door for a stretcher and looked for help My mother tried to comfort him My brother was fortunate because he got to hear my mothers voice before he went to heaven l found the bones of two people my mother and my grandmother Also my older sister My older brother disappeared My other brother too My little brother and a little sister and one more brother lm the only one who lived We were all Catholics Ours was the biggest Christian church in Asia How could they drop the bomb on us lf theres a God lt was difficult to identify the bodies As we searched we cried Mommy l saw two burnt bodies not too far away l saw that one of the bodies had holes where the eyes should be and one gold tooth My mother had one gold tooth so l knew it was her Hurry l found her l yelled to my sister My sister said lm too scared l said Come here now So my sister ran over Together we looked at the body We reached out and said Mommy Before our eyes it crumbled into ashes This happened years ago But lll never forget it Mommy The only things that moved in Hiroshima were the flies circling over the dead godforsaken place covered with dead bodies At first you feel completely overwhelmed Then you become numb and you cant feel anything One after another they died At first hardly anyone survived We needed to make room for those who could be saved l walked among all the dead bodies looking for someone who was alive Our faces were swollen and bandaged No one could recognize me My mother was looking for me but there were so many people She walked through the entire place whispering my name in peoples ears Finally she found me This is what l looked like after they took off the bandages and the bleeding stopped l regained consciousness You see my burned and infected body They had to pull the bandages off and on regularly The pain was so intense ld pass out The worst thing was the maggots eating my flesh That was pure hell The patients in the hospital both the adults and the children would hear the nurses coming down the hall and as they approached everyone would beg to be killed lt hurt so much l lay in bed immobile for months l developed wounds from the bed sores Also on the side of my face These are my ribs You can see my heart beating between the ribs The heat rays melted my arm and my skin was hanging down My back was burned all the way down lt hurt everywhere They ripped the gauze off my back l tried to bear the pain but at that moment l started yelling at them to kill me Everyday the pain was unbearable All l could think about was dying The doctors were clueless about how to treat me They still dont know After a year and a half l left the hospital They drove me to the train station The station was crowded with people Suddenly they noticed my burnt face They all stared at me with horror l didnt have the courage to stare back l just looked down and cried l hid in a corner until the train arrived l cried the entire When l got home l wouldnt leave the house l wouldnt go outside ever l was very stubborn about it l told my mother that l would rather die As l cried my mother looked away She just ignored me When my crying turned into a whimper she swooped in next to me She said lf it makes you feel better to cry then cry all you want Mommy will be by your side no matter what happens l think it was her love that saved me But then people who shouldve been getting better came down with atomic bomb disease No doctor had seen this before l had a high fever but there was no treatment for it On the outside people looked normal but they were very lethargic ld collapse lose consciousness Everything became blurry and ld faint There were many strange symptoms hair loss bleeding purple spots People said that we had some kind of contagious disease No one would come near us So many health problems l would bleed from my ass from my gums My liver swelled up My kidneys stopped working life of sickness Tens of thousands got sick And they were dying left and right We didnt know what it was For a doctor its frightening not to know what youre treating My sister Kuniko was Her gums were bleeding All of her hair fell out Her body was covered with purple spots She was writhing in pain After the bomb she seemed fine so we didnt understand what was happening to her Then she died lt was me who convinced my parents that the family should be together in Nagasaki few months later they were dead My siblings never got to try chocolate and the other wonderful things of life l truly wish l could have died instead of them l felt so much guilt l wanted to kill myself My sister stopped talking l told her Hang on Life is worth living But she missed our mother and fell deeper into despair She jumped in front of a train going at full speed l just couldnt go on So l went to the train tracks and stood where my sister had stood l heard the train whistle and waited as the train rushed towards me But l became afraid and jumped aside l realized there are two kinds of courage the courage to live and the courage to die My sister had the courage to die Me l chose the courage to live Even if lm alone l still want to live l dont hold a grudge Japan lost the war But how do we live tomorrow What do we eat The basic things How do we survive We didnt know about radiation We called it pika don Pika don was like a dirty word for the bomb And the pika don people became the untouchables We were treated like dirt But we still had to eat We stole corn from peoples fields We didnt know everything was irradiated The only things l didnt eat were cats mice and humans There were no mice The cats were too quick to catch The humans well we wouldnt Besides they were covered with maggots after days We found a way to survive When l felt like giving up which l often did ld remember l was Catholic and suicide isnt allowed so ld better just suck it up Our shelter was a hole on the side of a mountain with water dripping on us lt was hard to stay dry or sleep ln front of our shack they built an airstrip for the Americans There were skeletons all over the area So when they built the airfield the bones were crushed into dust When the Americans came we were scared to see all the jeeps But they were kind to us They gave us chocolate and chewing gum ln no time we were yelling Hello hello We were just kids l asked them Why Why did you kill my family Why did they deserve to die Of course they didnt understand Japanese They just smiled at me Give them back to me l shouted lt pains me to think we were guinea pigs The American doctors picked us up at school and put us in jeeps We went into a room and stripped naked lf you had purple spots or diarrhea they examined you but they didnt treat us Even though we survived we couldnt live or die like human beings ln Nagasaki the government did nothing for the survivors The streets were full of orphans We had no housing or food Children were killing themselves Something needed to be done Friends l met at the hospital people hurt like me burned disabled with missing limbs We talked about our problems and decided to form an organization for survivors We proposed that since Japan started the war it should take responsibility for the victims of the bombings Thats what we wanted We were angry at the government So we became activists The death and destruction was horrible but sometimes its harder to survive Most survivors look fine on the outside but they live with the bomb everyday Other people cant begin to understand what they go through ln Japan if people find out youre an atomic bomb survivor nothing good will happen They face discrimination They cant get jobs lf they get married they could have deformed children My wife is also a survivor Thank God our children are normal but it could show up later What about my grandchildren l still worry The bomb is still with me lve had miscarriages because of it l had abnormalities with my reproductive system and was told l couldnt have children lve had so many tumors One turned out to be colon cancer They found tumors in my pancreas tumors in my thyroid tumors on my back They seem to pop up everywhere Their children boys or girls will face obstacles in marriage if people find out This is the reality even today lm already years old lf you ask me theyre just waiting for us to die Soon the Japanese government wont have to worry about us For a long time l didnt want to think about it l avoided anything related to the war newspaper stories television shows lts over years since the bomb lt still haunts me l cant forgive myself for what happened to my brother and sister Not a single day goes by that l dont think of them lm sorry lm sorry My bones are so thin and brittle theyll break if l cough violently lve shown you my wounds because l want you to know this cant happen again lts painful how people react when they see me l cant change what happened lt doesnt matter how much l cry my body will never be normal l must accept this and be part of the world Since Japan lost the war the Occupation force wrote our constitution Article of the constitution says No navy No army No air force No weapons production lts an extraordinary document No matter what we must protect it All this pain we carry in our hearts and in our bodies it must end with us c BitShockorg
