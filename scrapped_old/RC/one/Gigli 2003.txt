the appearance of due diligence What didnt say nothing You know your friend Louis his supervisor back in the home office is about to fold his napkin right Sorry Starkman in New York Hes through Looking at huge federal time Big ugly dark dungeon underground No chance of parole never ever Time Yep m sorry to say hear hes a good guy but you know In any event heres my problem and if you know any of this feel free jump in shut me up This federal prosecutor out here the one with Starkmans testicular matter clutched in his fist this very federal prosecutors little brother Any of this sound familiar To me No No Well This very federal prosecutors little brother a bit dopey from what gather may have been absconded with which as you can imagine would be to the dismay of our prosecutor think But could be wrong about this because its almost too stupid for a mind to grasp But think maybe someone in your professional community might be participating in these shenanigans to dont know help squeeze a little friendship altruism whatever out of this particular federal official Maybe in the hopes that Starkman will wake up one morning And wake up one morning to find all charges mysteriously dropped The school of thought of my colleagues is that this kid is already way out of town alone am of the opposite school think hes still here Thats what think But whats important is what you think What do you think As a friend whos got his ear to the street Seriously never You know know You dont know nothing can tell just by looking at you The whole things probably alien abduction like said before Man you know what d love to do right now Go down to Marie Callenders get me a big bowl pie some ice cream on it Good Put some on your head your tongue would slap your brains out trying to get

a bad thing Yeah thats right Why dont you come here so we can kick your ass What happened Let me Okay Go ahead You know what you boys need is to develop better people skills However in the meantime Excuse me You ever heard of Tai Moi Chai No Okay In traditional Tai Moi Chai there are five levels of digital orb extrusion Thats the gouging out of your opponents eyeball with ones finger The highest and most difficult to master is my personal favorite Kai Toi Mai Loosely translated thats the rip that takes the past Now once the thumb liquefies the eye it is deftly and immediately replaced by the forefinger Deep thrust hooking around and securing the ocular nerve and then removing it with such force as to bring with it by suction a vital portion of the visual cortex The part of the brain as m sure you may know that stores visual memory The extraordinary element of this move the genius of it the absolute poetry of it is that aside from the obvious wound ones opponent is left with no memory of anything he has ever seen Family friends nothing Hence Kai Toi Mai The rip that takes the past As you can imagine very difficult to practice in the United States but felt well worth the trips to the Chang Rai Province People skills See knowing how to properly judge character knowing how and when to make a move in short knowing who to and who not to fuck with These are things you boys are gonna wanna work on in the future Okay And one more thing Sports are all well and good but very hard to earn a living at So want you guys to study hard and keep your grades up all right Okay Everyone yes Yes Okay Good Brian lets go Nice computer Heres suckmydick Com So can you really do all that kung fu shit you said back there with the eye and that No That was all bullshit Sun Tzu said that in a war the best victory is that which requires no battle Is this some more bullshit now m getting No Whos Sun Tzu Chinese military theoretician who pointed out that in a conflict getting angry which you seem to do a lot of is a tactically and strategically stupid move It clouds your ability to reason It gives your adversary the upper hand You wanna cloud your adversarys ability to reason thus gaining the upper hand yourself Whatever You know given how unhappy you seem to be can see how that wouldnt be the easiest thing for you to do What is that supposed to mean Just that mean when men are boys theyre encouraged not to cry not to show their sadness so theyre forced to find other ways to let those feelings out As m sure you know fighting and getting angry are much more acceptable male behaviors So when these boys grow up guess what outlet they use to express their sadness guy whos miserable at work or depressed about his life comes home at night what does he do He doesnt usually cry in front of the wife and kids He usually yells at them So Larry What What is it exactly youre so sad about No m serious Yeah What about your friend Mrs Leonard Whatever her name is Look cant right

and New South Wales is bringing showers and theres very little activity over the rest of the continent But there is some lowlevel cloud over Southern Victoria which will bring isolated showers mainly to the coastal areas Another chilly night in Melbournes suburbs with the mercury What are you doing now and Avalon falling as low Brian told you this is very expensive Its not expensive Dont argue with me Why are you doing this What do you care about the weather in fucking England for Australia Whatever Its not England Whatever Brian Why do you keep calling there really like her voice Okay Try

need to be dipping into the sisterhood But m just curious because all of a sudden now you say youve been with guys have But they have their shortcomings Besides the fact that they give terrible head See right there that tells me something know the guys youve been with obviously didnt know how to bring home the pearls when they were diving for oysters was actually just joking Well since were letting it all hang out now let me tell you something else Okay when it comes to pleasing a woman your girlfriends theyre just theyre at a natural disadvantage Its like they might try hard but theyre just not backed up with millions of years of genetic engineering programming instinct Nature has evolved man for that purpose Satisfy Lead the pack Thats why lesbians are always buying spending their dough on you know sexual appliances erotic monkey wrenches and shit trying to compensate for what they dont have What theyre not getting The penis Thats right Its very design tells you everything you need to know Forward motion With advancements Fucking progress into the dark deep mysterious unknown Its like adventureseeking frontierconquering obstacleeradicating And you tried to create the impression you didnt read books Youre settling for second best Thats all m saying So in review youre saying that its men that are at the top of the mustfuck pyramid Thats all m telling you Loving caring sensitive giving men Thats right Youre entitled to your opinion But let us reconsider women for a minute Shall we Sure Their form Neck Shoulders Legs Hips think pretty cool Now as far as your famous penis goes The penis is like some sort of bizarre sea slug or like a really long toe mean its handy important even But the pinnacle of sexual design The top of the list of erotic destinations dont think so Ones first impulse is to kiss what To kiss the lips Firm delicious lips Sweet lips Surrounding a warm moist dizzyingly scented mouth Thats what everyone wants to kiss Not a toe Not a sea slug mouth And why do you think that is stupid Because the mouth is the twin sister the almost exact lookalike of the what Not the toe The mouth is the twin sister of the vagina And all creatures big and small seek the orifice The opening To be taken in engulfed To be squeezed and lovingly crushed by what is truly the allpowerful allencompassing Now if its design youre concerned with hidden meanings symbolism and power forget the top of Mount Everest Forget the bottom of the sea the moon the stars There is no place nowhere that has been the object of more ambitions more battles than the sweet sacred mystery between a womans legs that am proud to call my pussy So guess this is just my roundabout way of saying that it is women who are in fact the most desirable form Wouldnt you agree agree And so do Hello Is somebody there Yes Whos this dont find this funny Is this the retard Brian what are you doing now Give me the fucking phone Hello Who the fuck is this What the fuck is going

fine What You dont like my fingernails now Look have no idea if this is true or not but ve heard it said that those who are balanced more toward the masculine of either sex check their fingernails this way And those balanced more toward the feminine check them that way had a feeling that even though you have this tough guy thing going on that you are wrestling with some very strong feminine leanings Thats fucking bullshit cant see m farsighted Nearsighted whatever it is So hold them out here but cant see them up close To find out how somebodys balanced toward a masculine look at me cant

not kidding All right Larry All right See you later Bye Ricki Bye Brian What Nothing You know got this fantasy About making it with a guy No Thats not it Going somewhere you know like somewhere really clean Clean Yeah No scumbags telling you what to do Nobody yelling at you all the time Someplace you could just be Be yourself No bad stuff That sounds good Whats up We have a visitor from New York Follow me Hello Welcome Nice to meet you Hello sir Finally Nice to meet you too Come Look at you Beautiful Come on in Here Grab a couch Sit sit say everything twice In in Sit sit m so glad you could come on such a short notice too Thank you really appreciate it really thank you appreciate it Here ve got some stuff m sorry if m a bit of a mess but just got in a few hours ago m sure Louis told you you know m having some little legal problems out here right now What are you gonna do Its a nuisance but what are you going to do got to fight it right mean cant go to jail That just cant happen m used to the finer things Louis am right You are right It cant be So think we can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that its not gonna happen Somewhere a mistake has been made Did you know that apparently some people do not regard the thumb technically to be a finger Curious for myself turned to Louis here who with his newfound dictionary skills looked it up for me You know what it said No Tell him what it said Louis It said quote The short thick inner digit of the hand next to the forefinger Unquote Now it said digit not finger So still dont really know technically if its considered a finger or not Right Right Right Look at him love him love this guy He eats no matter what love you Louis Whats this What is this Louis ve been subpoenaed cant be consorting with armed felons little consideration please Besides you think something like this is necessary anyway to intimidate people say intimidation comes from within There are a multitude of qualities an individual can possess that make them intimidating Not only this this is the outside Then theres the inside But you know whats the most intimidating quality Not that you asked But the absolutely most intimidating in my opinion When an individual just doesnt give a shit Louis you want to go to medical school Medical school Yes Students there can always use something to learn on feel like m floating feel released dont give a shit dont have no compunctions none whatsoever And am very concerned about the way things have turned out here How was the bleeding The bleeding No not him The retard when you cut his thumb off Louis told me you were concerned Bleeding was fine Fine It was all right Okay Good didnt need your help you know could have beaten these charges What were you thinking You were gonna extort a federal prosecutor You thought you could say Kidnapped your little brother drop all charges and the guyd roll over You didnt think all hell wouldnt break loose You didnt think every fucking fed wouldnt drop what they were doing and dive in to protect one of their own What do you morons think this is Little Italy Wake up This is the twentyfuckingfirst century So now things are bad And whether you wanna call a thumb a finger or a digit for the sake of this discussion it doesnt really matter You know why Because whatever you choose to call it a thumb has a fingerprint and the one you sent had the wrong fucking one Mr Starkman know my fucking name you piece of shit You dont try to extort a federal fucking prosecutor And if you do you dont fuck around Fuck this Cutting off his thumb was a stupid order We would have been derelict in our responsibilities if we had followed it Hello How long could we have kept below radar with a thumbless bleeding halfwit You see sometimes one has to use their professional prerogative to override a dumb request With all due respect even at this point if you were to ask us to pursue a course of action that would be lets say contrary to your best interests then as awkward as it might be we would have to take exception Aside from those of us in this room theres only one person really that can link you to this fuckup And feel that we should rectify that problem as soon as we can think d much prefer just to you know end it right here And that would be your professional prerogative If you think that having that kid picked up by the authorities and telling them all about being kidnapped in an attempt to save your ass makes sense If you think thats the best tactic to keep you out of jail If you think thats any less dumb than asking to have his finger cut off well then that would be the thing that you should do But if you dont then let us take the thorn out of your side Let us make sure that kid will never be able to testify against anybody And if after that youre still not happy then we can all talk again You were kidding right What do you think Well take Brian back to where you found him and get out of here Are we going to the Baywatch now No we cant go to the Baywatch now Take you later Maybe this is it Maybe this is the thing Maybe this is a sign coming from nowhere from out of the blue just telling me its time Its time to get out Its time to do it When m alone in my room Sometimes stare at the wall and in the back of my mind hear my conscience call telling me need a girl whos as sweet as a dove For the first time in my life see need love So if you know who you are why dont you make yourself seen take a chance with my love youll find out what mean need love need love Let me ask you something You got a girlfriend No dont Let me do something for you You know make up for all the problems caused you Because see youre a little nervous around women Right Let me tell you something You got no reason to be shy Theres no magic to it Let me tell you this thing that heard and m starting to believe that its true You know Its that the thing youre most afraid of in life if you do it if you step up good things will happen You see
