We dedicate this picture to those who came to our land ago and made it their homeand and our inheritance For us they faced the unknown For us they hungered and toiled Their endurance is our prosperity their struggle is our freedom their dream is our certainty their dawn is our day From their dust we spring and reaping the great harvest of their lives and works we remember them with blessings Lake George Florida April came across this lake once some years ago in a boat that brought me home after the war with the Yankees Came down this river going back into the wilderness away from civilization looking for a place to settle a place to live back into the scrub country It got wilder as got deeper into the woods liked it Vegetation was denser The trees had to struggle for a breath of air Even wilder here as got back closer to the sources to the beginning of things further away from towns and wars And then left the river went right into the woods themselves And here was the scrub country
