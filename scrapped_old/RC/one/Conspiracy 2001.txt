Adolph Hitler invaded Poland in September starting By the winter of his armies were freezing and starving in the snows of Russia where his best general had died of a heart attack and America had entered the war For the first time Hitlers dream of a German empire to last years was in doubt While he hired and fired generals and the winter grew colder of his officials were ordered from their commands and ministries to meet in a quiet lakeside residence in Wannsee in Berlin far from the crisis at the front In two hours these men changed the world forever Only one record of what was said

stating to me and to my superiors It will be Gen Hofmann Race and Settlement Main Office We deal with matters of race and settlement Is it me Leibbrandt the Political Office of the Ministry for all we hold and administer in Eastern Poland the Baltics and in the Soviet Union am the State Secretary for the Ministry as a whole Give them your name Meyer Dr sorry Stuckart Interior Ministry Martin Luther Undersecretary of the Foreign Ministry met almost everybody My name is Neumann Director Office of the FourYear Plan Lange Deputy Commander of Task Forces in Latvia Among other things We all have other

Polish winters Not the case Schngarth assigned to the General Government Dr Freisler Ministry of Justice Also hold rank in the Storm Troopers So that is who am Adolf Eichmann Gestapo Office of Jewish Affairs and that should be Yes thats all And am Heydrich Chief of Reich Security Main Office and Reichsprotector of Bohemia and Moravia And welcome You have each been given some papers These are for you alone No copies to be made not to be seen or discussed with others except superiors How we deal with matters here must be held secret from our enemies We control events better when we control opinion Today each of us becomes a bearer of secrets And our secretary will be discreet He agrees He agrees Excellent Communication between us after today will pass in both directions through Lt Col Eichmann my deputy for all Jewish matters He is your focal point To begin we have a storage problem in Germany with these Jews There have been conversations for a year about this Jew and that Jew and the complexities of the law and this problem as you m sure know has tormented us We first undertook to expel them from all means by which our people would have to deal with them every sphere of life of German people The laws enacted at Nuremberg and we should drink a toast to Dr Stuckart for devising them Coauthor in all modesty am the coauthor They established the fundamental legality for the creation of a Jewfree society a Jewfree economy for the world to see And we indeed have eliminated the Jew from our national life Now more than that the Jew himself must be physically eradicated from our living space Clarification Absolutely There will be a moment for that But if may we pursued a vigorous policy of emigration but who would take more of them Who would want them Was the policys ultimate limitation Every border in Europe rejects them or charges outrageously to accept them America Even America thank you where Jews constantly whisper in Roosevelts ear still turns them away Then in acquiring Poland we acquired two and a half million more By last July we were met with a new situation we would in very short order be acquiring some we would in very short order be acquiring some five million Jews as we conquered Russia The dimensions of this problem have magnified astoundingly Five million Exactly the problem Our ghettos are full All those ghettos yes with Polish names Fully occupied but hold for now please if you would At that time last July confronting this new situation Reichsmarshal Gring prepared a directive you have a copy The operative words if youll permit me to read hereby charge you with making all preparations in regard to organizational and financial matters for bringing about a complete solution of the Jewish question in the German sphere of influence in Europe Now for that read the cleansing of the entire continent of Europe You see the word cleansing An accurate word think If may go on in the second paragraph Wherever other governmental agencies are involved these are to cooperate with you hope So on so on as necessary for the accomplishment of the desired solution of the Jewish question This is our mandate all of us May say in fairness the Jewish question falls within the responsibilities of my department the Reich Chancellery and we received no directive If you will give me a moment or two The document is in your folder Yes it is in your folder m sure it is Finally what has happened since that directive Succinctly now we are standing still in Russia the Americans have joined the war Both events are a further drain on our military our economy our manpower our food supply We cannot store these Jews Emigration is over And the inevitable solution is what we together at this table will discuss this afternoon Well go on Youll find a document listing the remaining Jewish population by country in Europe and whatever the or Russia calls itself for the time it has left As mentioned emigration policy will stop apologize sir call for Gen Heydrich See who it is and end the calls Yes sir We will take but a moment Please sit Dr Kritzinger Make us all comfortable Where is this going Yes this is Lt Col Eichmann understand Major but the General is to be free of calls at this time If you wish to explain the matter to me Yes Yes m sure if you call his office you Yes Heil Hitler This meeting is not taking place You are to take no phone calls for anyone at this meeting Anyone Unless the Fhrer calls and he wont Understood Yes sir Here is Field Marshall Reichenau strapped to a chair and put convulsing on the plane where he dies He wanted to retreat as deeply as Rundstedt did but Rundstedt got his medal and Reichenau the hereafter Maj Schussheim was reluctant to give me any message He does not appreciate you as do He does not appreciate you as do Emigration The policy to replace that of emigration and we have enough experience to do it well is evacuation Which differs from emigration in what way Evacuation to where Let us postpone that question for a while To hell one hopes Many already have Do they even have a hell They do now We provide it We have received assurances that these Jews are held in livable conditions You are postponing that is your prerogative Will have an opportunity to be heard on this On my word of honor If may Austria Occupied Eastern Territories General Government Bialystok and Moravia Estonia Not a one The best thing ve heard about Estonia You have the list wont read it all Plenty in France Romania England million In what is or will be soon our sphere of control over million chosen people The changing definitions Yes go ahead Except that there are countries that define Jewishness nonracially merely as a religious practice England America Therefore by our racial principles there may be many additional uncounted Israelites And he speaks Jewish He does He does What then confronts us here in open discussion which will inform the choices we must make is what to do to deal with this staggering number of Jews overwhelming us My suggestion is to take all ablebodied Jews separated according to sex to the East to work in units specifically for road building Yes Can we be practical You are hardly describing the promised livable conditions for these people On the face of it your plan excuse me does not succeed It is fanciful You have in this collection here five million RussoEuropean Jews urban workers tradesmen Almost bureaucrats Almost doctors writers journalists actors and so on Almost doctors writers journalists actors and so on Almost Building roads picked up anything heavier than a pencil Yes and most will be casualties eliminated by natural causes We intend to be complete We will comb Europe from west to east starting with the protectorates Bohemia and Moravia We will evacuate them first All tobeevacuated Jews group by group will be sent to call them transit ghettos and then transported to the east Please You want yours first understand Let me make my case youll be heard When in your plan do you take their women away How they love to make the beast Control yourself Jews who have beyond years will be moved into oldage ghettos possibly Theresienstadt will be chosen where they can expire at their own speed We will sweep all wounded Jewish veterans and those given military decorations The Iron Cross first class that fine distinction will be abandoned They go too into the oldage ghettos or we will be drowning in requests for exemptions and interventions was referring to intervention of another kind below the waist This is all very beguiling but when you include privileges for certain Jews the Party Chancellery sees its interest a certain way And Martin Bormann can speak for him has his authority as well from the Fhrer We do not just surrender our prerogative to decide Jew questions Everyones point of view will be considered Did you ever see an animal with two heads They do not live Want to see Bormann and Gring fight it out We are not trying to roll over anyone quite the opposite Does anyone else want to raise this question now Because have been asked to direct the release of Germany and all of Europe from the Jewish stranglehold and believe together we will But the brief remains clear All of Europe England from Lapland to Libya from Vladivostok to Belfast no Jews Not one propose that the appropriate expert from the Foreign Ministry act as channel to the security police in each country m counting on you to be my link to the Foreign Ministry think having explained in general what we are challenged to do would be grateful for comments and questions Let us have some refreshment in here Pretend we are the directors of Farben Thats how they do it yes That is how we do it My friend have read your recommendations appreciate the effort and the thought heard some of what wrote in what you already said think not hear that Heydrich has a little Jew blood in him Why dont you ask him The numbers are misleading Misleading Who is a Jew is another question Theyre not a heterogeneous Not a heterogeneous population And how is it that you can speak Hebrew Or is it only Yiddish you speak lived among them worked among them and picked up a few words Jewish Yiddish what they were not enough to speak So went in search of a rabbi Rabbi means teacher came to find out May tell you the Lords honest truth So many of our highest ranking officers whose responsibility it is to deal with the Israelites they make no attempt to get inside the Jewish head went to visit this rabbi old man long beard in his oneroom flat And when he saw me his eyes grew as large as hens eggs asked him to teach me his language and he agreed And he said that he would but that he would charge me of course applied to my commander for funds and was denied ve run into this opposition all my life so paid my own money Very little not much And he taught me some vocabulary and letters of the alphabet Looking back realize it was poor judgment on my part because couldve so easily had the old man put into prison and demanded lessons from him in his cell free of charge One day he went out He was rounded up and shipped off because he had gone out unadvisedly And thought Thats so stupid Why are they so stupid Didnt he know that wouldve protected him At least until my lessons were complete want to be through by or earlier Theres no reason why we cant continue prefer you all at the table There will be a buffet lunch Excellent Settle down were moving along You have the overall idea but its clear some areas will evacuate swiftly What about our friends the Italians The Italians We must all trust the good Lord to save us from our Italian friends In the last analysis if they dont purge their Jews well go down and accomplish it and put their priorities in order In France even where we arent occupying theyll ship their Jews out Here is another problem The Foreign Ministry sees difficulty in evacuating too fast in Scandinavia as you say Lapland Unless we tie up a lot more troops there troops which we need for the Russian campaign Moscow the Scandinavians will not cooperate What do you see for the rest of Europe The Foreign Ministry sees no difficulty with the Balkans Southeast and Western Europe This is very good Southeast and Western Europe This is very good Sir Yes The Race and Settlement main office is planning on sending an expert to Hungary for general orientation on our policies think that should take place at the same time as you send your advisor It will put some iron in the glove so to speak The glove is iron and there should be no confusion as to where policy emanates should hope that established relationships will be maintained If they are productive but not if they are not if may speak for the group It is not my intention What is your intention The work done by our department Our particular expert is prepared We both serve the Fhrer he gave me the command suggest your advisor serve as an assistant to my man That preserves the relative powers of our offices does it not Yes it certainly does That is how it should be will leave it to you then to be in touch with Col Eichmann Yes Settled Moving along Now a difficult problem My instinct is to be Alexandrian and solve a difficult tangle with a sharp clean stroke this afternoon All our actions must be predicated on law Everything weve done is from the Nuremberg Laws which Dr Stuckart brought forth to the Reichstag in We now have to examine the Blood and Honor laws in regard to the problems of mixed marriages and persons of mixed blood Not only who is a Jew but how in each defined circumstance the Jew is expunged from society the government the economy through ordinances The tapestry if youll permit some pride The exemptions written into the law allow too many Jews to remain among us We address that problem by examining each category and every exemption Theres been communication with the Chancellery Head Lammers who discussed these questions with the Fhrer You asked why you are here You represent him And your own opinion We would like that too Lammers has indeed met with the Fhrer or his staff on this question and reached an understanding Dr Kritzinger can we come to a further understanding here What can we all agree on What would like agreed here is that mixedblood persons of the first degree they have two Jewish grandparents they are halfJews they are just Jews They go Their children go There are in the law as of now two exceptions If you would For firstdegree mixed if married to Germans with children theyre exempted Their children seconddegree mixed would be treated as Germans The other exception is firstdegree mixed who the Reich has chosen to honor with privilege for whatever reason We are talking here of men and women who live as Germans They do not worship or behave as Jews but have some quantity of blood The genetic Jew In those cases well examine each determination and perhaps revoke their exemption The Nuremberg Laws Whoever receives exemption better have extraordinary merits not just a German parent husband or wife Those who are exempt from evacuation they too will fall in certain categories Could you General Sorry have the real feeling evacuated Jews already by shooting them at Riga Is what did evacuation When they fell were they evacuated There are another at least waiting for similar evacuation just think it is helpful to know what words mean With all respect If might think its unnecessary to burden the record Yes In my personal opinion they are evacuated Explain have just done so That is contrary to what the Chancellery has been told have directly been assured Purge the Jews yes But to annihilate them That we have undertaken to systematically annihilate all the Jews of Europe No That possibility has personally been denied to me by the Fhrer And it will continue to be Yes understand Yes He will continue to deny it My apologies Do you accept my apologies Of course So very kind So very kind Close the doors please Those mixed in the first degree Yes those mixed in the first degree who are exempted will be sterilized May just point out in regard to special exemptions its widely known ve heard the opinion expressed myself that there are million good Germans and each one knows his decent Jew even if he regards all the rest as vermin If there are decent Jews then before they are decent and indeed after they are Jews No Firstdegree exempted will be sterilized No more children and eventually no more mixed blood once and for all It is important to know what words mean It is important to know what words mean But its important to remember in years no matter who holds the power history will be written in those words Do you expect the men serenely to submit to being sterilized Why not Theyve already had their cocks clipped Its voluntary One can lose ones possibility to reproduce or one can be evacuated If a firstmixed is sterilized of course the Nuremberg restrictions dont apply The Nuremberg Laws are very specific When am done Thank you Please As to seconddegree mixed those born to a halfJew and German or onequarter Jew threequarters German equals German With exceptions If both parents are mixedblood the childs a Jew If the child looks or sounds Jewish even with only onequarter mixed When that blood is dominant Then he is a Jew Third mixedsecond with a criminal or political record Excuse me sir is this a second or a third mixedsecond Third exception Third exception In other words he that behaves like a Jew will be considered as such If any of these secondmixed exceptions marry a German then they will be evacuated no special dispensations The marriage laws are very complex Mixed marriages include German relatives They have a vested interest in the couple also in children born to the marriage So here it is Marriages between mixedfirsts and Germans if they have had no children depending on repercussions on the German side either the halfJew is evacuated or to the oldage ghetto Theresienstadt Possibly Somewhere The same holds true for the fullblood Jew with a German wife or husband If there are children if the rules classify them as Jews they go with the Jew parent evacuation or ghetto depending on the case If theyre classified as German that spares both the child and the Jew parent Jews of firstmixed married to firstmixed are Jews Children as well treated as such Firstmixed married to secondmixed and children the same Unless theyre exempted by special considerations they are gone Otherwise to the ghetto possibly Theresienstadt In all cases the will be the determining agency No question lingers in your mind about that does it Sterilization will be a growth industry Who would not choose infertility to avoid evacuation They would never know Would never know what If you use a word other than sterilize You think they would never know It is simply a matter of secrecy The smell of blood carries very far find the plan unworkable find the plan personally insulting have given years to codifying the laws regarding interracial marriage Now m presented with this clumsy forgive me unworkable structure My work these laws any legal code worthy of the name restricts the enforcers of law as well as its subjects There are some things you cannot do As you see it What see is all have to contribute here Let me offer a modification a simple change we can all accept Maybe this helps the outline Sir what you have suggested and not to put too fine a point on it you have said the halfmixed will be eliminated Evacuated Evacuated My mistake That is a wholesale departure from the law But my suggestion Yes which is say the halfmixed should get the choice we talked about to be either sterilized or taken away Does that not come closer to the spirit at least of the Nuremberg Law Dr Stuckart does it No Sorry no Sterilization is promising but attempting a supersession of what are clearly defined laws in order to impose all these subjective evaluations its like Forgive me it is like the imposing of ad hoc law Depending on subjective evaluations as to if he looks Jewish or has a Jewish personality or whatever else is subject to interpretation and variation including the assertions of the damned Jew himself What does this do It subverts the Nuremberg Laws and perpetuates disrespect for the law think we are basing our proposals carefully No with all due respect and all frankness its a tangle And this is not pride of authorship m simply reacting to the bureaucratic train wreck thats to follow Please it is simply solved Sterilize them all We could call it medical resocialization or something We can find ways The biological necessities are all met My The Nuremberg Laws are respected a simple procedure snip here a snip there This is not a joke It is not rays That is how you do it Exactly how You have this ray machine built into a counter or a desk Some unfortunate Jew stands at attention in front of the desk and am not coming to your office So you either raise the desk or lower the desk depending on certain subterfuge do not know if it sterilizes the female technical question Not voluntary youre saying Every Jew of whatever degree whoever betrothed to however mixed whatever service to the state Youre saying we dont need to evacuate them We pinch off the race at this generation The Reichs law We make the law we need Why am telling you this How many lawyers are in this room Raise your hand Jesus Christ Its worse than thought The children what then for them You just line them up in front of their desks and rays toast their little gonads If might for perspective If might for perspective We have already been using sterilization for the mentally defective since in our program Euthanasia is the correct term yes Yes Reichsfhrer Himmler discussed it with the General Apparently a doctor at the biological institute in Dresden has a simple injection You can father no children Where can get it It would be useful with the ladies am fixed my dear Of course it is as yet only tested with mice and rats Actually you would not need the injection just the papers to say that you had had it have figures but theyre not exact Between and roughly and by now to date possibly under the Law for the Protection of German Blood have been sterilized by various methods rays injecting some corrosive chemical directly into the womb Yes this was only for the Reich itself not occupied territories Yes Yes Are they fit for labor after these methods With the rays its a problem of dosage Less a problem think with the women Less a problem with the women Secretary Bhler makes an important point Labor Yes exactly Labor m not implying that our problems are the same as in the Eastern Territories but the need for workers as the military need men the need for production is only growing That is why sterilization is the preferred option It leaves our captive workforce what remains of it do not think our people want to wait a generation to end this problem We have deferred Jews by the thousands in armaments construction Wait can give you an exemplar Its just a quote from a letter from the Debruder Public Company but there are many companies The sound of his voice and the sun goes down The specialist for Farben do not think you understand Over Jews in the metal industry alone about altogether in Berlin and thats just Berlin failing our production goals even now for the war He makes a point We are moving too fast here Nothing has been thought through The questions of sterilization and deportation are separate Yes but linked Deportation evacuation elimination Where am we have to move them out now quickly wipe them away Yeah not to return Never to return There are labor shortages in the Reich and elsewhere we control There is no argument about that Everywhere and in our fouryear plan Not that fucking fouryear plan again But our war is against the Jews do not see the logic We wont sterilize them and wait until they die or sterilize and exterminate the race Thats farcical Dead people dont hump or get pregnant Death is the most reliable form of sterilization Put it that way So who is deferred Firstdegree mixed married to Germans with seconddegree children are exempt Individually firstdegree mixed who have special privilege For labor if needed cant give a rule for everything Can just say one word more In the obligation to maintain a lawful society Another lecture what we would be saying to those Where we depart from the law in deporting a Jew married Good Deport them new law will be required Write it Why dont you write it Consider The Jews are taken away The German spouses will inherit the property of the Jewish spouses go to court and apply for a death certificate What happens to your secret killings then No matter what you call them the secret is out dear friends Perhaps not inheritance Perhaps divorce freedom to remarry So a requisite divorce mechanism dealing with these marriages to be terminated becomes the Reichs responsibility to its German citizens Fuck am speaking Except for those initiated before the spouse is deported the courts will be so busy with divorces theyll be on hour shifts The litigation wait will be decades Or longer have no sympathy with Germans who climbed in bed with members of the tribe Nor do ask myself What is his concern When the ruling principle of our government and our party is to make Germany Jewfree you are arguing to let these Yids stay To influence to operate freely with the exception that you neuter them They are not free The law restricts them it isolates them am merely speaking of Perhaps the judge has love for them Yes special love For whom For Jews Wonderful You dont have my credentials Forgive me From your uniform can see that youre shallow ignorant and naive about the Jews Your line what the Party rants on about is how inferior they are some subspecies and keep saying how wrong that is They are sublimely clever And they are intelligent as well My indictments to them are stronger because they are real not your uneducated ideology They are arrogant selfobsessed calculating and reject the Christ wont have them pollute German blood Please Doctor He doesnt understand And neither do his people Deal with the reality of the Jew and the world will applaud us Treat them as imaginary phantoms evil inhuman fantasies and the world will have justified contempt for us To kill them without regard for the law martyrs them which will be their victory Sterilization recognizes them as a part of our species but prevents them from being a part of our race Theyll disappear soon enough And we will have acted in defense of our race and of our species and by the law He spoke of the Law for the Protection of German Blood He spoke of the Law for the Protection of German Blood wrote that law When you have my credentials then well discuss who loves the Jews and who hates them Pigs dont know how to hate know too when it comes to the halfmixed that to kill them abandons that half of their blood which is German ll remember you You should m very well known We should take a moment just to Absolutely If may for a moment Dr Stuckart has raised the question of administrative consequences of evacuation He is a very brilliant scholar of the law and m sure just as totally committed to a Jewfree Europe as any of us Let us take a moment Go on with the food More lemon If you are suggesting that you have dominion over me just remember this Even the Party which have served loyally since answers to the government They both answer to the Fhrer You may be a friend of Gring but if youre a betting man put your money on Bormann Hear youve been flying that little plane of yours This morning yes m never comfortable off the ground Not me admit Nietzsche advises the secret to enjoying life is to live dangerously He enjoyed it so much he went mad Look at the world and tell me the pleasures of sanity Excuse me Doctor Would you join me for a moment Thank you We will accomplish this will not allow administrative technicalities to slow it down Every agency will jump to follow my order or arses will sting And there are no shortages of meat hooks on which to hang enemies of the state This will be an operation And as the war goes on the will more and more command the agenda and put marks against the names of the less than cooperative You have a choice to make You understand that respect the Please You will still have to make your choice Do not let a strutting imbecilic porcine prick like Klopfer make it for you d rather not see the bullies admit we have more than our share of them in the take too much of an interest in you Interest in me Do you not think And all want from this meeting is unanimity and no trouble getting what has to be done done With you at my side so much is possible ve done this arithmetic The real size of the labor force is already a million less than the figures show The economic considerations are not the only considerations ll say theyre not Have you done the extrapolations My friend with due respect may say Fuck the extrapolations hope you understand want to be as useful as can We must be in contact Exactly No one listens From where he sits he does not have the ghettoes or the stink And hes burglarizing administrative control from the GovernorGeneral Privileges of rank dont hear any urgency Privileges of rank The higher you go the more infallibility is bestowed But dont hear any cutthebureaucracy solutions Our problems Youre right He does not have our problems Crap The privileges of rank All that matters is the blood group tattooed under your arm Thats a secret password for you people What are these suspicions will tell you this When cholera hits the ghettoes and typhoid your tattoos wont protect you from shitting your guts out until you dry up and die Then tell me about infallibility Those little Nuremberg country sausages the gritty little ones You can keep your oysters What is that Can you get them here Lange Yes sir Who were those you say you shot when you say you shot In Riga Latvia And stood by with my men and allowed Latvian civilians to kill in mobs received memos directing the one would say evacuation of Jews who shot and buried in soil and corpses managed to crawl out still alive Not exactly war is it And gas chambers about to come What gas chambers Gas chambers hear rumors yes This is more than war Must be a different word for this Try chaos Yes The rest is argument the curse of my profession studied law as well studied law as well How do you apply that education to what you do It has made me distrustful of language gun means what it says Do we need all this discussion He has his style Yes Very persuasive Is there a problem Doctor He is non compos mentis Its your boss On your feet Beautiful lake Is it not m sorry After the war shall live in this house and rise to see that lake every day and dream comforting things am a dreamer as think you are Yes it is a dream world Maj Lange how can help you Politics is a nasty game think soldiering requires the discipline to do the unthinkable and politics requires the skill to get someone else to do the unthinkable for you But we need the politics so we put up with them At least for now Yes We look forward to a better day peaceful world German culture triumphant That is what we work for appreciate the words sir We are servantsoldiers are we not Yes that is what we are Indeed Did you ask him Ask him what Does he have a little Jewish blood No not yet Inform me when he answers Thats what heard grandmother or a grandfather His father Thats the rumor and if it is true how happy would he be to tell you want a work document in two days Yes No more than copies Yes sir numbered And those spools the stenotype record have it destroyed Yes sir Lets get them back in here All right Whos up there sir Dr Klopfer Kritzinger is The gentleman outside walking Find him Sir It has got colder What a pretty little maid would like to remind all of you that our Fhrer enunciates the goals It is our task to turn his vision into reality We can debate the how and the when up to a point We can not debate the if Dr Stuckart am not purposely contentious Nor was trying to be insulting would like to try We will now discuss method Who would like to speak on this What is being advocated here law dissolving all marriages between mixed and German Why not Courts adjust As we all do That is not the point Youre too inflexible my friend You know damn well the courts will be happy to be rid of the problem m pointing out a problem of casting every Jew and nonJew into a sausage machine If thats the plan m asking that some legal framework be built Lets do it If we skip a few steps so be it Skip a few steps When you plane down a piece of wood a few chips go flying Jews or judges who are the chips would like to say in this discussion regarding the tone first abandon your misperception that Dr Stuckart has affection for the Jews m sure he does not and his heart is pure He believes in supremacy of law Jews in any event will vanish soon enough from Germany But the method yes You accept casually the obliteration of legal distinctions and the use of extreme inconceivable measures that say again that our Chancellery was assured would not be used That is where we have come soldier cannot decide where he chooses to fight Where are we here Gen Heydrich invited your opinions on the methodology Indeed can say this Youre going to have your work cut out with the Catholic church with the Reich divorcing all those Catholics Thats not going to make our priests very comfortable or the Vatican The Vatican has no love for the Jew Why should they interfere The Lutherans would not object either agree with Dr Stuckart The problems outweigh the shortterm ideological satisfactions Military necessity comes first Am wrong Why can this not be simpler The Ministry of Justice which represent can live with it gladly Maj Lange an opinion General accept the chain of command have no other gods before it The politics of it all No nothing We are more than a nation of armies hope General If Dr Stuckart is saying we should turn a few Jewloving Germans against us would happily throw them all on the same transport It is however a political decision not mine particularly to make Can you step back from trying to settle these details today Other agencies will want to be heard Now that is wisdom from my neighbor favor sterilization think but not wholesale what Gen Heydrich outlined earlier Why not what Gen Heydrich outlined earlier Why not rays injections Why are we discussing theoretical solutions Goethe said that theories are gray but that real life is green Stop chattering and be realists here insist as have before that the best way is the quickest way Purge them totally off our land ideally off our planet And for the Eastern Territories leave us ablebodied workers If they are separated the men from the women no babies And evacuate the others as you outlined Get it done All right weve gone around have your opinions want to move on Lets have the food in here wish to keep going We can eat while we work To clarify what agree with and what do not agree with the doctor about the complications of all the variations But favor deportation or sausagemaking right hear talk from some of you who live here in Germany about labor force What is the reality at least for the Polish Jews Damn few of them are fit for labor of any kind You do not find Jews with dirt under their fingernails so who is this labor force What we have are ghettoes filled and overfilled with the scabrous the rotting We do not have the food for them The stink of their diseases does not stop at the walls And you ship them up to us by the thousands to deal with What are we to do We have no place to put them We have no more place to put our own We cannot shoot million Jews We cannot poison them and we cannot use them Youll have Maj Lange and his men come in with their special methods How many Rigas do we have to have Build the wall higher What we are asking before you flood us with all of these Jews let us first clean out ours empty our ghettoes into whatever you have for them Military too Mass shootings by our groups create morale problems especially when the Jew is a German Jew who is intellectually superior to the Russian Jew Even with local civilians cooperating mass slaughter leaves a bad taste can so testify Weve had to deal with the backlash when it comes to German ones If your method of disposing all the Jews diverts military units and rolling stock from the Eastern Front then it is a stupid choice Recognizing the priority for ridding ourselves of the Jews m not arguing priority but method and expediency m sorry why cant you shoot them Didnt you hear him It is the worst thing for our soldiers to be doing They are women and children and soldiers have a sense of honor Plenty of honor in following orders Would you like to volunteer Enthusiastically will You will not Eleven million even half that executed in small batches would be asinine for the reasons Dr Meyer mentioned Inefficient use of time troops equipment bullets No As Maj Lange will learn using gas is much cheaper and less public Please The euthanasia program has used injections but most effectively a carbonmonoxide gas We began using it on Polish mental patients in Brandenburg in January An area is constructed that resembles a shower room or a bath The subjects are brought in naked as though for a shower and outside stainlesssteel tanks pump in pure carbon monoxide which what it does is have figures In May this program was extended to Hartheim and in June at Sonnenstein In the first six months of By the end of a total of By the end of August last year another We terminated this particular program however on September In the end At this time we began the advanced program The General Government knew nothing Keep going Last summer we ordered the construction of mobile gassing trucks using their redirected exhaust back into the chamber Three such trucks have been in use since last month But the Chelmno camp now Kulmhof Already constructed under our noses In each truck you can get in to Jews at a time In fact the more you have in the faster it works And the carbon monoxide what it does is The bodies come out pink The gas turns them pink Thats a nice touch If it is already built what is this meeting Why bother The system has shown that it works It will work for you It is settling in The method is now defined The Jews go in red and come out pink That is progress should never mix wine with whiskey Whats the matter think will be all right Dont make excuses if you have to leave for a minute Sort of a headache Hurry Eat Fucking ridiculous Not at all sir It could not be the mixing The cigar Everything all right sir Could be the cigar could never abide them And my father would chew them His mouth was always full of evil juice and pulp It would fill up and he would have to spit It would fill up and he would have to spit would leave it there sir Cigarettes they calm me down Settle my stomach They calm me down The problem is there are not enough of them in the world We should be in there should we not Yes Sir Is this clean Yes sir Let me have a glass of water brought some out sir m not addressing you And a bromide tablet of some kind You did not like the food did not eat know of no philosophy Philosophy clutters your argument We have to countenance the suffocating glut of this parasitic people consuming our food contaminating our professions controlling our currency None of that is true In your philosophy Perhaps thats what the chosen people were chosen for No apologize You take a position you deserve a response It is a cold winter The war in spite of the rallies posters and the radio looks like a longer harder war The Jews are in the way And how can one rather peripheral figure in your grand plan be in your way You underestimate your influence do not You would be a hard man to bring down But certainly not impossible Did hear you say earlier Be practical Yes Then this is the moment to be practical until a time when Germany can afford your philosophy which is what Hound them impoverish them exploit them imprison them just do not kill them And you are Gods noblest of men find that truly remarkable Sitting at that table will ask for your agreement to what has been proposed And must answer now You will answer now or you will answer later will not oppose you want more than that Of course Good We understand each other May tell you a story good one true one Tell me the story It was told to me by a friend of mine Yes He knew a man Do you realize how much thought and effort has gone into the FourYear Plan Plenty m sure Reichsmarshal Gring is very clear The necessities of the war mean that the Jew question has to wait Theres been a new directive That says nothing about a change in priorities It is implied Not by me Why is it your way or nothing mean the Now you understand do not You have stated it When report to the Reichsmarshal There has been a new directive It has to be as the directs You cant sail a ship with two captains The Fhrer is the captain And for this he has given Heydrich the command Even Gring has given it Resign yourself Resign Yourself to how its going to be done soldier cannot decide Yeah spare me Communist by definition has a defect of reason The Russian is not a Communist my friend The Russian does not give a damn who runs things have lived amongst them The Russian only cares he has a bottle of vodka to suck and some form of domestic animal life to fuck Then he will happily sit in shit his whole life That is his politics know those people That is the distinction absolve the Jews of that What did Kritzinger say Told me a story Which was Later He made his point he feels better Nothing to eat Lf theres time later We shouldve had music There must be a piano here string trio would add to the experience Yes should have m sorry Food wine brandy no music little lovely late Beethoven m sorry It would not have been practical Yes m teasing take it that you do not get good food up in Cracow If all Berlin eats like you no wonder we have shortages Was it Mussolini who said War reveals mans nobler character Are we ready Feeling better Thank you yes Something you ate m fine The cigar The cigar Unexpected We will forego cigars That should be no great trial Where did we stop The last remark was by Gen Freisler The Jews go in red and come out pink That is progress The sideeffect of gas Theres more to say on that Were studying something faster other faster and cheaper gases that could be used Cyanide is being tested various forms Electrocution too There is research being done to see whether electrocution can even more effectively quietly put an end a period to the end of the sentence Say one truckload an hour including putting the contents in running the engines removing the contents cleaning the inevitable soiling on a hour schedule Thats a day in one year But cannot imagine you could operate consistently at that rate Not to mention disposal Gas vans are a shortterm field solution We have three camps where permanent gas chambers will be operational m sorry Yes was about to mention Belzec Sobibor and Treblinka before Gen Hofmann was taken ill It was a fine cigar Ultimately the camps will be the primary locations Last summer Reichsfhrer Himmler asked me to visit a camp Last summer Reichsfhrer Himmler asked me to visit a camp up in Upper Silesia called Auschwitz which is very well isolated and close to significant rail access We are turning that camp into a major center solid structures Heres where your Jewish labor comes into play Herr Neumann The Jews hold the bricks and build the buildings themselves When the structures are complete we expect to be able to process an hour not a day An hour And those numbers look a lot better At hours a day that is Thats million Jews a year if ever there were that many We are also constructing the means of disposal which will obviously depend upon the process of combustion Yes industrial in nature large commercial gasfed ovens no residue to speak of go up in smoke We can achieve that Imagine Assembly line Yes the clever Americans have shown us that but we put it to the purpose of a triumphant German vision Triumphant German vision So this is my command to you here Link arms your units your ministries apply your intelligence apply your energies The machinery is waiting feed it Get them on the trains Keep the trains rolling And history will honor us for having the will and the vision to advance the human race to greater purity in a space of time so short Charles Darwin would be astonished want to bring this meeting to a close One matter we postponed is the point at which mixed becomes wholly German or wholly Jew That line will be drawn quickly am not trying to rewrite your law but am invoking Fhrers princip His word is above all written law Do we have any disputes left to face here either with my authority or with what we have agreed General Let us astonish Charles Darwin second the motion It is our most important war Sir We are discussing the inevitable and bringing it about in the most practical way under one command have no dispute with that understand the realities With the understanding that And indeed count on my support With the understanding that consideration will be given to my proposal yes proceed defer to the If you are to do it then force feed it Speed it along Our situation such as in Warsaw is difficult edging towards disastrous Thank you Yes what can say My enthusiasm is boundless Obviously Sorry trust my enthusiasm is clear is apparent Yes Neumann d like to know that adequate labor will still be available especially skilled On a casebycase basis Maj Lange Yes urge that speed that Dr Meyer asked of you The Poles are not as disciplined a population as we Germans will report our will to the GovernorGeneral Hell understand m relieving him of a burden Colonel thoroughly approve and am anxious to start look forward to working with your office and yours Colonel The sooner the better The notetaking General think we can now dispense with him Many of you took notes ll give you the day to memorize them They are to be burned Col Eichmann will prepare a discrete transcript of this meeting You will each receive a copy It may be shown to superiors but to no one at a lower level All comments are to be sent in the most privileged way to me through Col Eichmann Good We have accomplished something thank all of you gentlemen Heil Hitler There is plenty of food left for those of you and please Are you off General have a few minutes Come Leave him His Fhrer lied to him think he got the message General just a word In here Stop it Stop it You What are you doing Youre in uniform m sorry sir it just seemed to happen Not in uniform Nothing ever just happens If you prefer we can send you to the Russian front Clean off these cars Are you leaving tonight Yes Not another night in Berlin You have nothing to do sir have You surprised me at the end Dr Stuckart Not my intention Leave the paper tapes with me Well begin transcribing tomorrow but leave the tapes with me now You want all the tapes sir Yes all of them Dr Stuckarts car Are you unwell Good night Dr Stuckart My car Gen Hofmanns car It is night in Moscow already Soon it will be dark here Do you think well ever see the dawn in our lifetime Come spring well be on the move again Keep you spirits up Doctor The GovernorGeneral has specifically been told that we would be the first area to have our ghettos emptied the Jews evacuated The possible know the conditions but you are wrong The first to be cleansed is Germany Then you Germany first The bureaucratic This is my operation no bureaucrat with his nose in the rule book and hand on his cock will slow it down Well be moving Jews in days not weeks You can start writing up your train schedules Schubert Quintet in Major The adagio will tear your heart out Tell the GovernorGeneral to expect my call Have we helped your problem Yes hope so Good You sir m sure trains will be available Anything else You have been very patient Dont count on it Have a good ride to Cracow Thank you Well done Colonel Fine meeting Thank you Thank you as well admire your gift for organization The meeting was very economical Now Do either of you think we would have that final solution That in a year there wouldnt be a Jew left on the continent That we control Why not You drink Eichmann Yes sir Were you ever drunk From time to time Well then take a fucking drink am on duty sir Then its an order Thank you And tell us again about the pink bodies Sir d rather not The sounds the screams He will faint again did not faint had a physical symptom What was the story you were going to tell me Story Kritzinger Yes he told me a story about a man hed known all his life a boyhood friend This man hated his father Loved his mother fiercely The mother was devoted to him but the father beat him demeaned him disinherited him Anyway this boy grew to manhood and was still in his s when the mother died this mother who had nurtured and protected him She died The man stood as they lowered her casket and tried to cry but no tears came The mans father lived to old age died when the son was in his s At the fathers funeral much to his sons surprise he could not control his tears He was wailing sobbing He was apparently inconsolable Lost even That was the story Kritzinger told me dont understand No The man had been driven his whole life by hatred of his father When the mother died that was a loss When the father died when the hate had lost its object then the mans life was empty Over Interesting That was Kritzingers warning What That we should not hate the Israelites No that it should not so fill our lives that when they are gone we have nothing left to live for So says the story will not miss them Time You have to take me up in that plane of yours sometime Yes we should do that Not right after youve eaten Friday Everything will be prepared One working copy edited by me for your approval No other records guarantee Good You certainly know how to throw a party Thank you Shalom Does it tear your heart out Beautiful sir ve never understood the passion for Schuberts sentimental Viennese shit Col Eichmann carefully edited the stenographic record of the conference Copies were distributed to the participants to be read and then destroyed Gen Heydrich flew back to his headquarters in Czechoslovakia where in a few terrible weeks he had earned the nickname The Butcher of Prague In the spring two Czech patriots trained to assassinate him and dropped from a British bomber succeeded in wounding him In reprisal thousands of Czechs were rounded up and shot Heydrichs wounds grew infected he fell into a coma and died Eichmann as Heydrichs deputy for Jewish affairs was left to finish what they had begun at Wannsee He considered it a matter of honor
