The first Kurosawa film think ever saw was Throne of Blood on the Channel Fellini film Vitteloni There was a picture called Spiders Stratagem Sam Peckinpahs The Wild Bunch The Straw Dogs Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia The Story of Adele City Lights Rear Window Midnight Cowboy Ikiru Song Remains the Same Johnny Guitar The Onion Field Los Olvidados The Man Who Fell to Earth Every film that Marlon Brando was ever in Channel Channel Channel Our salvation Uncharted territory Like tomtoms in the jungle Jerry Harvey Jerry Harvey Programmer Obsessive programmer Dark and negative Maverick Nurturing Skating that line between insanity and genius What do you think the secret of the Channels success is dont know If told you then it wouldnt be a secret My father says theres only right and wrong Good and evil Nothing in between It isnt that simple is it No it isnt It should be but it isnt News time Hollywood story with a tragic ending this morning The bodies of Channel programmer Jerry Harvey and his wife Deri Rudulph were discovered Saturday Night in their Westwood home Police report Harvey shot and killed Rudulph his wife of two years before turning the gun on himself The motive is unknown Harvey had been chief programmer at Channel which is known throughout Los Angeles for its eclectic and innovative programming Both Harvey and Rudulph were years old So it was back in and had just started selling cable television and the Channel had just started So we came up here to the Hollywood hills And it was really great because these people had terrible reception They couldnt see anything on their television and not only were we offering good reception we gave them movies uncut and no commercials in their bedroom in their living room wherever they wanted it They ate it up It was very very successful It was amazing had friends over all the time because they showed two movies a night as recall And they were uncut uninterrupted It was this phenomenon no one had ever seen Theta the Channel was the only one in the major cities In other words New York did not have it at the time Los Angeles was the first one to do that That this actually existed you could see this stuff was incredible So was like Weve got to get this was living in El Segundo at the time And my mom called up and no Channel wasnt in our area Not only was Theta in that area along the foothills but it was who was in the homes along the foothills and those were the folks that ran the movie industry They were films for the whole family but thought slanted to adults a little bit And those were the films tried to get Chinatown was on a lot in those days They used to run it a lot And that was one of my favorite movies And ended up seeing it or times a week at certain points publicized the shows that we were doing in the Hollywood trade papers Variety and Reporter and gradually word began to spread think its interesting too to note that in that time its hard to remember this told my kids about it and they dont believe me but there was a time when there was no Blockbuster stores There was no videocassettes None of that existed The thing you have to understand this is before before Showtime before any of that and it was really really groundbreaking When left Hal Kaufman he took my place remember he had an assistant who he hired Jerry Harvey And that was my first contact with Jerry Harvey The Channel hired a person that really made the Channel probably put the Channel on the map and thats Jerry Harvey Jerry probably is one of those students that a teacher encounters every so often and thinks think this students probably smarter than am had just broken up with my girlfriend and so was standing at the Dickson Art Center Iooking rather forlorn apparently and he kind of recognized the look and walked up to me and said recognize the look And so we started talking and we spent the entire day having lunch and talking about movies and thats how we met So many of my students when theyre interested in movies are only interested in the art movies the indies Jerry loved them all and hated them all when they were bad With Jerry you always talked about movies Everything that he his entire frame of reference was films started getting these weekly telephone calls toward the end of each week from this obviously very young intense young man asking me for a rundown of what the good pictures were going to be that particular week think the first contact or memory have of Jerry Harvey was when he was booking the Beverly Canon heard about Jerrys work long before heard about Jerry because heard about his work for the Beverly Canon was going to Cal Arts an art school miles north of Los Angeles and everybody was talking about the Beverly Canon especially when he ran the uncut Wild Bunch mean that was like missile blast Everybody anybody who loved film knew about this And on a rainy day in the Beverly Canon theater people or however many people showed up for the screening think a great coup in his life happened because Peckinpah arrived with the print And it certainly was momentous because it his bond with Peckinpah just extended from there Jerry certainly was one of the people that looked up to Sam as guess kind of a father figure Jerry felt that way about a number of creative people that he admired and appreciated He was always surprising me It was Sam this and Bob that and thought Whoa How did you get to meet these people That he arranged a screening for Some Call It Loving there you cant help but respect someone who has taken all the time and effort to educate himself become familiar with with not only my films ones did with Kubrick of course werent obscure but Some Call It Loving was kind of an obscure film met Jerry Harvey in my mothers living room She worked with Jim Harris at the time and they were friends And came bounding into her house and he was standing there It was kind of love at first sight think We stayed on the phone that night after he left my house for hours He came over the next night after that and dont think he ever left for years He had aspirations to be a filmmaker or at least to start out as a screenwriter We wrote a script together about two college kids who were witness to a murder And thats how we really started writing together And we ended up getting the agency off of that meeting Monte Hellman Jerry was also involved in the making of a film a western that he had written believe and that he was able to raise the financing and went over to Italy to do it Are you satisfied now You aint gonna last long son There aint no softhearted gunfighters China was really great fun always remember we flew into Rome Landed in Rome was picked up by the limo at the airport and then went to Almeria Had a great group of people Warren Oates was there Fabio Testi Jenny Agutter Sam Peckinpah Monte Hellman We just had the best time one of the best times of my life There was of course a tremendous black period when his sister Anne committed suicide Jerry spoke to his sister all the time They were very very close Great friends And he adored her Anne checked herself into a hospital when Jerry was gone And believe that she was waiting for him to come back She had left a suicide tape that was her talking to Jerry while she died explaining everything that had transpired in her life that led to this decision She was really his anchor and not only did she go mad but now she was gone And he came back to have this happen And by the time saw him he was crazy had never seen him so crazy We got married pretty quickly after that We got married in February Part of what was really attractive about it at the time was that we had already been having this affair but then he was just so vulnerable in reaching out And so blamed the things that saw that seemed dark and scary to me blamed on the fact that he was in mourning over his sister and assumed that my loving him would make those things go away and be better We were still very close friends but we werent really partners in activity We didnt write anything together after that We never did At the time there was only Select and On as cable sources in the area that lived We had gotten Select And in the middle of the night he would wake me up yelling at the television because the programming sucked And at some point in time just said If you hate it so much either dont watch it or write a letter And so he wrote a letter to them telling them what was wrong with the programming And they called him and said How do you know so much and who are you And We want to talk to you And Jerry had said he had found these movies that since we were playing eclectic things heres some wanted to show me something Greece withdraws from The third guarantor power Britain with air force and troops on the spot sticks to her policy of strict noninvolvement It was a documentary about the invasion of Greece by the Turks and political content It was an interesting movie It had just been this guy whod written in this letter who was reading the reaction and was like Well that didnt get them so let me try one more and think it was like a Laura Antonelli film who had never seen before who was staggeringly gorgeous And thought anybody who could go to these kind of those poles to the utter pure documentary political documentary to sex is worth having so hired him And so that sort of set Jerry on his path which seemed really hopeful because then there was something that really was about his passion something that he could do that was positive and that would give him something to focus on besides his own struggle with himself Hal Kaufman the guy running at the time called Jerry and approached him about a job left Select and weeks after got to the head of programming fell ill and left and never came back Everything that predated and his own eminence over was merely the prep It was the years in the desert Suddenly Jerry arrives in the early eighties and hes known all through town He got me on the phone and he said Jerry he said ve been hired and want to do a new spin on the pictures that were showing think got a call from somebody once picked up the phone and somebody on the phone said to me This is Jerry Harvey buy movies Do you have soandso think soandso was probably Black Orpheus When you first met him think he was cold and distant We had to generate a mutual respect which came quickly because we found out that each of us had an interest in old movies different movies movies that were unloved movies that had been unscreened Telephone Ms Gray Thank you Excuse Shell take it here No never mind Ask them to call me at home later please Bring the phone What was so brilliant about what Jerry was doing was mixing the art film with commercial fare had to see everything on this crash course It was like the Schick Center for movie addiction And then had to hear him recite to me Dr Strangelove There was a month when heard scenes from Dr Strangelove from the moment woke up to the moment went to sleep agree with you Its great to be fine Now then Dimitri you know how weve always talked about the possibility of something going wrong with the bomb was great for him was Jerry sort of found his place there because he could come in Jerrys favorite way of dressing was a business shirt not tucked in a nice jacket baggy dirty jeans and Frye boots And he couldnt do that working in a corporate situation So at Channel he could do what he liked to do best which is sit crosslegged on the floor and make his phone calls that way smoking When did you start looking at films To be honest with you when was remember vividly a film saw at and the impact it had on me For a great period in my life that meant more to me than anything else movies The history of the movies seeing them This man Jerry Harvey this very sweet very odd man called me up and very tentatively asked me would like Safe Place my first film to be on television was sure he made a mistake because it was a film that was so trashed by all the critics when it opened that nobody wanted to play it Yes Yes have missed you Do you want to know why Because youre very simpleminded Screw you had a film called lmages that had done in shot in Ireland in And he was particularly Jerry liked that film a lot He said Lets run that on the Channel But we couldnt find who owned the title He said Well ll run it if youll run it said Well ll run it if youll run it So heres the print Katherine What are you talking about Katherine love you You dont These films get lost in a hurry And would get calls They just played your movie on Channel m naked now mean that was like a big release for me If you couldnt get a studio to release your picture your picture did not get seen One of the big things that changed that was the Channel The Channel to me was the first time could speak French Channel It was the first time you could turn on your television and see something that you would have to go to the cinema for What he was doing was coming up with films that had never heard of or didnt know existed People saw movies that they wouldnt have gone to see in a theater if they were free And consequently think it was both a pleasurable experience and an educational experience and think it widened everybodys horizons It made think even the powers that be realize that there was this alternate audience that was much larger than anybody knew Jerry found all these films and was able to program them on the Channel And it sort of built a big following just think that he in a sense had blinders on in which all he could see through his blinders was film And you grew up where grew up in Bakersfield How would you describe Bakersfield In how many words Kind of a cross between American Graffiti and TwoLane Blacktop Did you have an enjoyable childhood No When Jerry came aboard it was also the moment when Showtime and The Movie Channel all showed up in He was a formidable competitor And he didnt say nice things about people he was competing against because he lived and slept this job They thought they were going to carve up the territory that belonged to Channel Channel was the only one in town at that time But all the others thought Well were gonna roll over this guy And in fact a lot of people had told Jerry to his face Well you run a nice little channel Its too bad you know And he said Well well see And what happened was of course that and those guys really couldnt get a toehold Channel had what was called a zero churn rate which means that nobody would cancel the service Jerry loved Channel He loved everything it was about but he felt a lot of pressure to perform He would call you in the middle of the night on a Saturday night On a Sunday morning at in the morning he would call you and say Youve got to get me this The channel will go under It was always the sky is falling if you dont get me this got to get this So he tried to take it all on and what he would always do to compensate in those kind of situations is that he would selfmedicate So he would go around with hed drink and then hed have NoDoze in his pocket He was manic but he was an obsessive programmer want to say that thats not a bad thing by the way Basically he would come back from work at Channel and order pizza and fall asleep on the floor because he was taking a lot of medication So he wasnt really functioning at home but nobody knew it at work because he would function in the morning Met Jerry on the telephone He called me in London Woke me up in the morning because he got all the times wrong His first words to me were How come dont know you So get this lunatic on the phone at in the morning giving me this long monologue about what other films have made He wants to see everything Can send everything over to him What documentaries have made And all that Will you have a dance with me please dont mind if do Come on then In the case of Overlord you have a World War film which actually incorporates footage from World War but incorporates it so artfully that you cant tell the staged footage from the actual footage We began a process of developing a screenplay based on real material both documented material and footage And began to construct a dramatized documentary about a young English soldier He said Well start by having a month of Stuart Cooper Well show all the features Well do the documentaries later Well show all your feature work during the month different times But the deal is you have to come a month ahead and do oneonone screenings with the or key critics and have lunch with them or dinner and talk about the work Gary Prebula called me up said theyre showing two films by Stuart Cooper who had never heard of He said Nobodys ever heard of him Channel is gonna premiere them said theres still a Channel He said Oh yeah was debating whether or not to go When got there was glad showed up because was the only one there that knew of There was this other guy named Jerry Harvey who didnt know who thought might be a fellow critic was fascinated by this guy Stuart Cooper because had just seen Overlord for the first time and was blown away by it But m sitting there with Jerry and Jerry is the one whos talking to me in this mild way and m getting along with him and were laughing at each others jokes It was really a great kismet moment because then he started doing some reviews for Channel for Jerry It coincided with the period that my mother was dying got the news of my mothers death And within a halfanhour the phone rings and its Jerry Harvey Hes like the first call m getting dont know how he found out But he called me and he was consoling me He said Look ve been through several deaths in my family and look you can make it It doesnt have to kill you And said It wont kill me was feeling super strong was not hearing what he was saying Now its unbearably poignant And that was the beginning of their relationship And to the day Jerry died And he were very close When Jerry brought me aboard my concern was as a critic didnt want to be paid to say good things about a movie hated And Jerry liked my style of reviewing because wouldnt so much punish the movie for not succeeding would come from a place of Well tried to like it read Magazine religiously used to write nasty letters to Feeney used to get the angriest letters The angriest letters of my life got from Channel subscribers Yes think did write letters to the Mag which had forgotten until contacted to participate in this documentary wrote think complaining about the letterboxing bars werent big enough for Kurosawas High and Low and thats how got this tshirt remember couldnt wait when my Channel Magazine would come every month because wanted to read all the reviews which werent always good The people that wrote it knew that their audience was keenly interested in what they had to say And what they had to say was a whole series of original and highly controversial observations about the films that were being shown It wasnt the usual pap that you get in fan magazines My belief and know that this is Jerrys belief too is that if you appeal to the most intelligent member of the audience everybody else follows along Theres this feeling that you have to appeal to the common denominator Jerry and hit on the phrase the uncommon denominator thats what we want because we want to go for the smart folks because everybody is smart Thats my man dont think well make it past the cops Well make it past the cops just hope we dont see no Muslims Listen you owe Ben Angelelli You tell Ben Angelelli to suck my cock Wait a minute You lost that money you should pay your debts double suck The first couple years of Jerrys stewardship of are marked by just the ability to do the unexpected So he was able to make simple but effective use of his position there And then suddenly his reputation started to take care of itself have this fantasy that in the year or the year theyre gonna read about the furor that attacked Heavens Gate the furor that came down upon Heavens Gate and theyre not gonna believe it Its gonna seem like science fiction The Stock Growers Association has the names of some of you people on a list hundred and twentyfive names The thencurrent Management decided to make the film at a budget of million The million turned out to be before they were through The picture was a commercial disaster Hastings Beak Jerry would get very heated about what had happened to a movie what had happened to a director or how a film had kind of gotten off track or how somebody had been slighted when they shouldnt have been slighted or beaten up when they shouldnt have been beaten up Heavens Gate was not only clobbered it was basically burned at the stake The critics ganged up on it It became this huge set of headlines It was in every paper The Herald Examiner ran a story about it every day for months Every day was depressed for a year after that movie was depressed about it Really it was just You do a work and you think its good and then nobody likes it no critics like it And it goes down in the drain after two weeks they pull it out of the theaters and it disappears It was just It was cut immediately and lay there until such time as Jerry approached Cimino and talked about reconstructing his long version Without Jerrys prompting it would never have occurred to me to try to find an intact print of the original Heavens Gate It was his question that set the whole process in motion It became a hour special We had the first screening of Heavens Gate which was really an event and everybody tuned into it They wanted to know what all the fuss was about And in a different atmosphere a different cultural climate the reassembled Heavens Gate got marvelous reviews It was a big event and it was the beginning of sort of big events happening on cable It was really the first time anything like that had happened You got to see the directors vision of what the movie was Even after the fact its very hard to get out but in some ways that put him years ahead of his time We had a great relationship with Michael Cimino because of that because he really gave life to a film that had been so unfairly whether in the end you liked the movie or not it had been so unfairly treated The effort to do something like that was a gargantuan effort It would be like saving a great edifice that was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright or something Jerry took great risks in the films that he bought and thats why he was so respected Suddenly he had this position where he was being interviewed and quoted and it was nice because he had this moment of feeling like people were acknowledging him for what he wanted to be acknowledged for But he would have liked to think be making movies Instead he had such great respect for great filmmakers that he provided a place to showcase their works remember walking behind him one day as we were just taking a break d turned in a bunch of stuff and hed just made a bunch of buys and just done a bunch of business And he wanted to go out and get some ice cream So we file out of this little garden spot office that we had which was the first office that knew And were hiking up along Bundy And m walking behind him Its just this very hot California day Hes wearing a tweed jacket Hes got that cigarette lighter around his neck and hes just bopping along m looking at him and m walking behind him and m thinking weve just come off of several months of really happy work and m thinking This is actually one of the happiest times of my life What were your mother and father doing when you were growing up My father was a judge My mother was a personnel director for a hospital Were you able to see your parents very often They sound as though they were very busy people They were around Maybe too much was at Select and Jerry called and said that he would like to talk to me Would be interested And would meet him for dinner to discuss working at the Channel We talked about what the duties would entail and most of all he talked about his personality And he said to me m crazy you know And said Oh yeah sure Jerry would be very honest with you about his own needs He would say Got to go to my shrink And he would just say it in that plain way like Got to go see my doctor Got a doctors appointment But it would happen to be a shrinks appointment And he would go often You knew that he was devoting maybe a couple of afternoons a week to going over there One day everything would be fine Wed be having a conversation Maybe hed go to the bathroom or go get a glass of water and hed come back and he would be incredibly depressed because he had looked at the corner of the room and realized that the workmanship was shoddy and start getting depressed about how people dont care about anything anymore And somehow in those moments that he would have had that revelation it would sink him into this depression about how the planet was doomed and nobody gave a shit about anything anymore And he said in a very serious intense way m really crazy m paranoid He wrote letters to me at the time talking about what eventually would happen to him that one day he would lose the struggle Not in a threatening way but he talked about it And in rare moments of lucidity what frightened him was something inside of him that he didnt know how to deal with dont know how got around the m crazy and m paranoid line but went to work there and found that to be pretty true Its Black Flag made the movie The guys that paid for it were a couple of independent businessmen from the valley who wanted to make a porno movie And went in to talk to them and they didnt know was gonna come in and pitch a punk rock movie but told them that punk rock was the next best thing to porno So Hey lets sign a check And they did We showed the film one night midnight They had to shut down Hollywood Boulevard And motorcycle cops came We had a letter from afterwards from Darryl Gates the Chief of Police saying Please dont ever show that movie in Los Angeles again When go to concerts its like my friends get beat up by my friends And its like Fuck Its because like theyre not beating up the right people Theyre not beating up the fucking posers Theyre beating up just my friends Its fucked The cops recognized Eugene from having been in The Decline and arrested him Because they saw it on Yeah because they saw it on Channel Took you a little longer than thought m afraid its going to take a little longer than that m leaving now Roads wet It wasnt raining when got here No Too bad People really did not understand that film They didnt get it and the critics didnt get it You fucker hate you Stop that Blow it out your ass Fuck you was up for an audition to go do Star Wars of all things And so was reading Star Wars and my agent was pressuring me Go read for Star Wars This is gonna be this thing And m going dont know always said as my little actress prayer If somebody just gave me the chance could just show them know it could Please God give me this chance And then Bad Timing fell in my lap and was like Holy Should do this Alex You want me Come on Do it now Alex Here it is Alex Here it is look at it Alex Dont you want it There it is Alex Come here Take it Thats what you want Here it is come on In terms of the Channel showing it so much because it had such a small release theatrically especially in this country that was really where everybody had a chance to see it swear even to this day ll have people come up to me and tell me how much that that movie affected them How did you go about finding those films Because obviously it took some effort No one else was doing it You look at a lot of things that you think might be interesting based on somebody not everybody that was involved in it or what its about or what its based on or where it was filmed Theres a million reasons Just like anything in life you say Gee that sounds interesting Showtime The Movie Channel all of us are at this big convention in some hotel Big table dais pitchers of water nameplates Jerrys down at the other end And everybodys going down the list talking about how many committees theyve got how many market research We hired this firm from New York Weve got this firm from Chicago Jerry how many firms do you draw on to choose your programs He says dont consult anybody just see movies just show good movies Yeah but your decisionmaking process Whos your committee dont have a committee We have people in the office we talk we like movies but basically its just whatever we want to see Jerry was an early and passionate admirer of a film called The lmportant Thing Is to Love directed by Andrezej Zulawski That film had a huge cult in Europe in the midseventies would sometimes seeing European films see clips from it because other European directors were so in awe of The lmportant Thing Is to Love that they would run little clips in their movies Lovers in French films would often be going to see The lmportant Thing Is to Love It became this immediate touchstone that automatically was being quoted in other films But it only opened briefly It only opened for a week And it just was misunderstood by the first critics who dealt with it And so it didnt go anywhere It didnt form the cult that it could have here in the United States The thing about the Channel is that the sensibility was offbeat and a little bit dont know mean they showed everything It was really appropriate that it was in In a way because in New York we did have a lot of venues to find those kind of movies When started working at this video store in Manhattan Beach called Video Archives and the guy who owned the store Lance Lawson would ask Hey do you have this movie Do you have that movie And hed pull them out And as d watch them d realize that these were the old Channel tapes And still have probably hundreds of hours of films that recorded off the Channel saw Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street from Channel had a whole and he just lent me the film and then watch it and then it just It makes me go like this because at the beginning of it Our Tribute to Sam Fuller All right And you see all the other movies that they also showed but Lance only taped Dead Pigeon all right m like Damn want to see Fixed Bayonets Park Row God damn it Tape Park fucking Row In those days that was the only game in town you know It was the only cable channel that you can watch real good movies that totally disappeared from the screen And some of them were my movies and of course always liked to see my movies just to see if it works on television When McCabe Mrs Miller first came out it was a flop It made less money grossed less money think than Stiggs or some of these films of mine that were really flops And its become a little kind of a miniclassic You do a film and its so Its just different from what the standard thing is they just dont succeed until the audiences have time to let themselves catch up with it Its hard to keep the audiences attention when you show them everything And the problem with most films is is that you hear it you see exactly what it is If youre talking theres a big closeup of your face So we know that youre talking And we hear it So think the mandate in film is to hide that to make the audience Whats going on dont quite see that Do you think thats So that the goose bumps can come out Otherwise youre sitting there drinking Coca Cola and eating a hotdog knew Jerry personally so well he would say Hey want to sneak your film on my channel And d say Oh thats good Because otherwise they didnt play anywhere They just didnt play anywhere The Channel did great film festivals Wed put on Truffaut film festivals and Kurosawa film festivals and Australian film festivals French film festivals English film festivals anything that we could sort of highlight maybe a lesserknown movie around The cool thing about Channel was investigating somebodys work Jacqueline Bisset seemed like a fetish in a way which thought was pretty cool Jacqueline Bisset is so much a figure of Channel think because her great beauty lent itself to Day for Night by Truffaut It lent itself to a wonderful film called Le Magnifique which was the quintessential movie that is to say a European movie that few people knew about stateside but which had a great deal of Americanstyle entertainment value built into it You got JeanPaul Belmondo as a poor writer whos fantasizing himself the superhero of his own pulp novel And the girl downstairs Jackie Bisset is like the iconic star of this pulp novel in this guys head When did Le Magnifique Philippe De Broca asked me to play this part which is one part was this student and one part was this sort of Bondtype character Doing Le Magnifique was interesting But it was a lot to do Interesting for me was to watch JeanPaul Belmondo because he was the most coordinated actor ve ever worked with and he could do or things comb his hair machinegun somebody jump from rock to rock like a lightfooted leper Not a leper leopard Like a person of like an animal Like a beautiful animal It was like having a film festival in your house every single night a film festival That you would you wouldnt have to go to Rotterdam and you wouldnt have to go to Berlin and you wouldnt have to go to Cannes you wouldnt have to go to Venice It was just like your own private film festival and the programming was eccentric and odd and mixed was angry at it many times thought Why are you playing that Youre the only voice on television Play only the kind of art films that like But it was very good in not catering just to me It really gave you a kind of smorgasbord It gave you a kind of openended view of all kinds of cinema and it gave you a sense of the size and scope that cinema has Antonioni is not necessarily about the logical structure of a dramatic story but about atmosphere and nuance and a kind of emotional tension that exists more like weather One of the most striking things for me in my memory is Monica Vitti walking across a piazza And then you see above about guys just watching her move And it says so much about Italian culture about visual imagery about femininity about sex about just being a human and then being in a place like kind of classical piazza somewhere very Italian and Mediterranean dont know Its just kind of haunting Jeanne Moreau walking down the street in La Notte did it for me said This is a woman This is a job Whatever this womans doing have no idea why shes so depressed She is obviously terribly depressed and this man is not treating her well Dont care about him She is fascinating dont know what that all that means Its just unknown material For someone to sit and think want to show the final break in a relationship want to see that actual the crack the how What about they attend an allnight party And somehow its the attending of that party that makes them finally realize that the relationship is dead And thats the film he set out to write Have you ever been married Yeah Yes Yeah think so By the fall of it was really clear to me that couldnt stay in this relationship anymore The psychiatry that had had so much hope for wasnt gonna solve the problem Jerry wasnt ready to solve the problem or perhaps capable but didnt care anymore went into work one day and Jerry wasnt there And he was gone as it would prove for weeks d understood that it was a contract dispute and he was holding a firm line Well he surfaced weeks later and in that time he had divorced Vera He continued to be in touch with me We saw one another a few times a couple of times that were really illfated because we sort of had a little moment together and then that would just make it worse because it would give him hope Jerry you know spoke bitterly of that period Not bitterly of Vera but just of being married and being in that zone and it was just somehow that was something we didnt discuss except to acknowledge that love was hell In that weeks in which he had disappeared from the face of the earth he had dissolved his marriage to Vera and started dating the landlady at his new apartment who was Deri Rudulph who eventually met a couple months later Jerry Harvey loved a movie that Henry Fonda did with his exwife Margaret Sullavan It was called The Moons Our Home and its basically a New Years Eve picture And Jerry wanted to play it as his New Years Eve movie one year Very hard to get a hold of Do you Sarah Brown take John Smith suppose youd want me to wait around doing nothing while youre making up your mind certainly do To have and to hold from this day forward Then if thats the way you feel about it you want to call the whole thing off certainly do Do you promise to love honor and obey him Do you really mean that most certainly do As Justice of the Peace m sick of being made a fool of m through never want to see you again as long as live wouldnt marry you if you were the la Now all you got to do is kiss the bride and its It was a favorite picture of his and the audience got to see it Well can see that youre definitely in love with films Certainly its your life But it seems to be totally your life Do you do anything outside of film for instance What do you mean Jerry was a creature of habit and he had his watering holes and think the favorite of all his watering holes was Guidos And he very often went there with Michael Cimino When was introduced to Cimino for the first time it was at Guidos Jerry knew all the waiters They all knew Jerry The waiters all knew Cimino In fact when Cimino walked through the door two waiters at once reached out with cigarette lighters remember going to Guidos one afternoon for it was kind of a late late late lunch And Jerry was there and pretty wound up And remember the thing remember the most about it is he was perspiring kind of profusely in the restaurant And he was wound cant remember exactly what he was wound up about but he was wound up about something Something was going on or something was bothering him But we had a few drinks And remember the waiter or one of the guys came around and adjusted his neck for him right there at the restaurant Kind of got behind him and said Jerry youre way overstressed here and kind of did a cracked his neck thought Oh my God He was a really moody guy The days that he would walk into his office sort of skulk into his office and shut the door we knew not to approach him know he fought with his demons an awful lot At the same time those demons were kind of what drove him on because he was insistent persistent and he refused to take no for an answer and he was constantly trying to make things right remember when Jerry bought Bertoluccis film and played the entire film not cut And it was so exciting got the hour from Lance when he taped it off of Channel still have because it took me two tapes still have the full recorded off of was a very jinxed film in the sense that Bertolucci had spent too much money on it The Grimaldis were unhappy with him for spending too much money on it and so his version was under lock and key for many years almost in a fit of pique Jerry insisted to the Grimaldis for years that they had an uncut a hour version of They used to say No no it no longer exists Maybe it existed once but it no longer exists And he pressed them and pressed them and eventually he managed to get it released And so we showed it on Channel And there you could see in all its splendor what Bertolucci had intended Its another amazing thing about the Channel to me dont even know how you could get the rights to show these things with all those politics involved But to just have access to the vision of the director is amazing invaluable You just never know when youre living in a golden age saw Berlin Alexanderplatz Now that was the most extraordinary revelation Where else are you going to see this or hours of this magnificent novel turned into this extraordinarily brilliant film which nobody in commercial filmmaking to this day will ever put on television It was like some enormous meal that kept coming and you saw the whole thing It was breathtaking One day he walked into the office and said Come into my office please and went into his office And he said he sat back in his chair and he said dont like the air that you breathe dont like the ground that you walk on cant stand to be in the same room as you are You are a horse unreigned And looked at him and was completely flabbergasted and shocked think even laughed because it was so out of nowhere And remember laughing remember at one point laughing and saying Well guess theres no room for me to grow in this organization And he told me hed write a letter of recommendation or something The day Peckinpah died Jerry had to leave work early Jerry got the phone call that Peckinpah had died and someone who knew Jerry well just came over to the office and took him out for the rest of the day It was just understood that that was just gonna be something Jerry couldnt work past for a bit He was like family Sam and Jerry And Jerry had a very strong sense of family that you dont see that much anymore He felt that you were part of this undefinable idea of a family You could turn your back and hed cover it We were all quite devastated over Sam passing and the fact that he wasnt able to get work there was nobody in this town that would finance him at all for anything think the last thing he did was a Julian Lennon video Peckinpahs recent years had been so difficult that one could see one could sense that he was moving toward that one way or another As a receptionist was literally sitting right outside Jerrys door So quietly sat there and occasionally would bring up some film talk with him And he began to realize that knew a little bit about film Then he brought me into the programming department He usually had Tim Ryerson in with him And theyd be like two guys bailing hay on an intellectual level It would just be Why dont we do this Why dont we do that And theyd be moving their way down the board trying ideas out on each other He stood at that board and moved those magnetic stripes around that represented the different films can remember many times just it was like standing there and looking at it and was just dreaming about all the wonderful possibilities that you could do Claude Chabrol In fact that was one of the other directors all right that Lance gave me had never seen This Man Must Die all right and they showed it on Channel and got it from him You still cant see that goddamned movie It was the great thing about right from the getgo that they were running European films That was how they got the reputation that they programmed them well and they were making a hit with it Who knew One interesting aspect of Das Boot you know it had a career as a film in theaters where it really wowed audiences around the country but then we discovered that it had been a miniseries in Germany that it was actually hours long and that there were hourlong episodes Makes sense We showed it Watch out Check periscope alignment ll be in the engine room Trim gauge isnt safe sir Zero six zero Check Whats going on Look out Theres this tragic irony under Das Boot that these guys who are just hardworking guys who dont think politically who just love the sea and are under it and in it and involved with their work and whose reality is one another They have no idea that theyre in a sense like the Monty Python characters about to be crushed by a big foot from the sky And in a way because its played in slow motion we can feel the tragic melancholy behind that was a thorn in the side of everyone who worked at Channel because they feared that would muscle them off the dial had buying power so they could give monies to studios which were very alluring The Channel had budgets that that restricted on you couldnt just pay for everything that you really wanted to do There was always somebody saying to him Do we have to spend money on this program guide Gee if we didnt have the program guide then we could be more profitable Do you have to spend so much money on the movies Do we have to spend so much in marketing the Channel There were all these pressures on him Sometimes they would take money away from him that he couldnt spend next year He had to figure out what his limitations were and Jerry was very good about doing that He had a very strong business sense so he knew what he could do and what he couldnt do but he realized that what he could do was a lot based on simply his own knowledge of movies Not only did Jerry champion the full version of Heavens Gate but he also felt the same way about Leones Once Upon a Time in America Because you still think like some schmuck from the streets Now if we listened to you wed still be rolling drunks for a living You broke Dont bust my balls Noodles You broke am talking about real money This is real money to me Its a lot of money Do you want any of it Youll carry that stink of the streets with you the rest of your life Well when we did Once Upon Time in America it was clearly from a personal point of view an extraordinary opportunity mean this was you know one of the potentially one of the greatest movies one of the great epics ever made mean it was you know Bob DeNiro was at the height of his career mean he still is Hes always great But mean he had just come off Raging Bull and you know Sergio Leone was a genius It was a year project for him We shot for months and because of one test screening Warner Bros And the Ladd Company decided to take the three hour and minute version of Once Upon a Time in America and cut it down to hours and something and they used the assistant editor of Police Academy ll or something to cut it It broke the directors heart It was cut by a group of people who should never have been allowed in the cutting room and they massacred it they ruined it They made a test showing of it in Chicago or Illinois something on a cold night They didnt get the results they wanted Any trouble No trouble Kid stuff It was a really grueling miserable experience but was really it was hugely frustrating and disappointing and discouraging The full version was a masterpiece as compared to like a routine film in a butchered shortened version Come here Look at this Come here Sudden death Fucking tragedy huh Twentysix years old Twentysix What a shame Great stiff She died of an overdose And m ready for another Jerry actually showed both versions side by side on the Channel and mean there was no doubt no doubt how stunning it is to allow your creation when youre an artist to be manhandled by other people who are maybe not as adept at understanding the vision as you the filmmaker is Your brothers a real friend Hes a romantic When it came out in its aborted version Sheila Benson who was then also a critic for the Times called it the worst movie of the year and then it was restored to the directors cut which was also shown and years later she picked it as either the best or one of the or best pictures of the decade which goes to show you what a little editing can do In a way what Channel was and what Jerry did is it became an alternative voice a voice which said not only Youre wrong but Heres why youre wrong Heres how it should play and heres how they played it And then they shut up because a pictures worth a million words And do you feel youve arrived where you are by accident or by design Initially by accident And then by and then subsequently by design Deri was so warm she was so bright and met her at her at her house She had a party for Jerry at her house and that was in itself was a very welcoming gesture It was a birthday party at the end of She was a lovely woman both in spirit and in physical beauty actually And immediately felt glad that if Jerry had to leave Vera for anybody that at least hed found his way to Deri because she seemed to be such a positive spirit Deri grew up with a mother who had been in an iron lung and needed an awful lot from Deri As recall her mother had been in a wheelchair a lot So Deri grew up taking care of people Thats what she tried to do with Jerry To know her was to just you know have a crush on her She was just so amazing and she was becoming a standup comedian she was starting a newspaper in Westwood She owned a lot of property in Westwood shed inherited a lot of property and she felt a great loyalty to the community She was a very optimistic open outgoing person and wanted sincerely to support Jerry and give him what he needed emotionally Are there any points in your life where you can look back and say that you might have done something else at that particular point Many many times Really Yeah think there are myriads of crossroads in ones life where one stops Do go this way or do go that way was very happy when had heard that he had remarried You know thought Well since it finally didnt work out with Vera after you know a substantial number of years together thought Well this is nice that hes met somebody else you know Their marriage was a very colorful affair held at the Westwood Marquis and Jerry in his contribution to the ceremony was to add lines from Ride the High Country You know he had the minister say am not a man of the cloth and this is not a religious ceremony Its a civil marriage but its not to be entered into unadvisedly but reverently and soberly good marriage has a kind of well a simple glory about it good marriage is like a rare animal Its hard to find Its almost impossible to keep You see people change Thats important for you to know at the beginning People change It was an occasion at which you know Jerrys circle of friends was small but very potent and in attendance There was me Michael Cimino was best man at the wedding and lets see there was James Harris There were a whole group of really terrific people there and Deris very large family they all were in love with Deri You know and who wouldnt be mean it was just a really terrific gathering The market had been created after Heavens Gate for directors cuts and The Leopard had been in a botched cut and even the studio knew it to be a botched cut And so The Leopard was restored to its full strength with an eye toward the video market and Jerry was there the night they screened it for the first time and he made sure there was an offer on the table and that when we showed it on Channel we highlighted it have seen the uncut version of it and they restored it to more or less its Technicolor stature and oh its fantastic The Leopard is about one night in the life of a Sicilian prince and this prince may be dying Theres a feeling of mortality thats plaguing him You know hes got a bad heart it seems and hes just sort of moving through the chambers of his life in a kind of melancholy way but really whats happening is that an era is ending around him Because of the length that Visconti gave to that story that prince in this single night of his life we actually feel the world moving through this man and we feel that you know when he goes a world goes with him met Jerry in or met Jerry in or was working at a video store in Westwood called Video Tech and that was going to college here at and was a clerk there and Jerry was one of the many industry customers who used to come in He made me a bit uncomfortable He just seemed very strange very just he gave off an uncomfortable vibe His wife on the other hand was a sweet charming woman and she gave off a great vibe Jerry would go in there and rent videos and they would get into conversations and Jerry realized Hey this guy knows what hes talking about And he asked me if was if d be interested in working at as a programming assistant and at that point my attitude changed greatly was very happy to see him think one reason Jerry was such a great programmer was the knowledge and the taste the showmanship the creativity and then the passion to do it or the commitment to do it and Showtime each launched a second channel that was more moviefocused more film bufffocused Showtime did the Movie Channel did Cinemax and you know they certainly were aware of Channel and tried to steal some of our thunder We didnt think they were doing a very good job of it mean if we ran it even certain foreign films would end up running on the other places They would have to be pretty sexy usually Our Night Owl films tended to show up a lot on Movie Channel and Showtime and just because thats like well tits and ass Much to my surprise when asked Jerry what was the most successful aspect of our programming he said the Night Owl series said You got to be kidding He said No were killing Nightline Were killing the News Night Owl programs were our late night kind of softcore things movies with sex stuff like that My objectivity breaks right the fuck down when think of those Night Owl films because those girls the women in those films were so pretty mean they always found you know even in the lamest of the Night Owls you know even in the one that has like no plot or its just like How why am watching this know m only watching this till the next nude scene but m gonna stay in there you know You know the one The Lady on the Bus remember Someone like Laura Antonelli or Sonia Braga would hit it big with a respectable film but their backlog was full of all kinds of early nudey kind of films and we would get them all So basically we would have Laura Antonelli festivals that had every last movie shed made you know with all the nude scenes Laura Antonelli its like what ever happened to her think she was like the first actress that ever like fell in love with in a movie that went to like see her films and they were genuinely sexy mean dont think knew what sexy was before then had crushes on actresses and was like thought was in love with them all right But m watching Wifemistress Theres a scene and shes with this actor Hes trying to get her to his room and theyre making out on the stairs and he reaches and grabs her in her crotch and it was really sexy to see that And when he did it she went and she almost like collapsed in his arms Please take me to bed Please And then they didnt go into the room and was pissed The great divergence between European cinema and American cinema really is about sex If you want to do nudity in a movie you have to do it in a certain way Thats or because its interesting because its so natural because you see things with that people do with other that you were not aware of that could be done mean we got many many calls after Turkish Delight saying You enriched our sex life So Turkish Delight well it was a great book You know loved the book It was like in Holland was doing Gone With the Wind in the United States you know Everybody was interested and was having an opinion if it should be Vivian Leigh or not isnt it And who should be her lover Clark Gable or anybody else And this was like this is our book It was so phenomenally important that book in Holland at that time had worked with Rutger Hauer on the television series was called Floris Because he was a television person didnt even think about him strangely enough My producer Rob Houwer said you know Well what about this nice guy that he used in Floris you know Yeah hes a nice guy and he seems sympathetic Why dont you test him said You know hes more a farmer And he was like he was like that And he said Yeah but you never know You have to test him And so tested everybody and at the end tested Rutger Hauer too and then realized that Rutger Hauer is phenomenal you know that it was absolutely l that couldnt have been more wrong in thinking that he couldnt do it We cast it with Rutger Hauer and that was of course for everybody that knew the book was like Are you an idiot You know How can you do this wonderful character of Eric hes called that is so beautiful and has all these feelings for this woman So was right was right ve been right a couple of times ve been wrong many times you know The fact that immigrated to the United States in had to do not only with the fact that got a job here but with the fact that people got me the job because they knew my work and they knew it because of Channel Is there anything else you would have liked to have done with your life than what youre doing at the moment Oh theres a million things Be president run a major studio More than anything though think would like to have been able to play professional football throw passes be a quarterback lot of things like that Jerry felt excited about what he was doing Hed be excited about a new deal Hed be excited about being able to announce a Warners deal or something along those lines but at the same time always felt that Jerry felt beaten think he felt he was fighting that uphill battle The whole time or just later think the whole time always felt that way with Jerry You know when you were a friend of Jerrys you were kind of immersed in his whole being his whole life and that was you know that was quite a lot of stuff When Deri suggested marriage Jerry said ve got to ll be honest with you dont want children mean if youre with that then we can then we can talk but you just need to know that before you get your hopes up Jerry was so hurt by his family it was difficult for him to get married and when he did get married initially inconceivable to have children so much so that he had had a vasectomy He certainly did give me the outlines of a very very dysfunctional family life Very tormented His father was a judge who at some point in his career had sent more people to death in the county of whatever Bakersfield County is than any other judge mean this was a family full of pain and darkness and strangeness Jerrys father was a fundamentalist Catholic someone who was so much a traditionalist so hidebound that he wasnt even close to his family You know when his own daughter was coming to him in a suicidal state he slammed the door in her face From what Jerry said Jerrys father was a drunk rather sadistic towards his kids Jerry didnt really have a lot of nice things to say He would tell stories about his father coming in and throwing water on him to wake him up in the morning and there were no specifics specific references to specific abuse or anything else but it was something he really didnt talk about that much He expressed actually more active active anger toward his mother She was a extremely monotone person never saw her angry never saw her cry never saw her really laugh that much It was like she was almost in a drug state Maybe she was shut off emotionally because she had done things and not been there for them or allowed abuse to happen to them Well never know He told me that he had another sister that the family really did not know what had happened to but had come to the feeling that she had committed suicide Jerry never really made that big of a point about it except that Mary had disappeared and he kind of just said that as a tossaway line and thats all he would refer to it Its the only way he would refer to it He had told me stories of struggling with depression and what he sort of identified as evil thoughts and dark thoughts when he was growing up Jerry was always volatile He always had a very bad temper but he didnt drink until in the late seventies when he started drinking When Jerry drank he was dangerous can remember once in Rome we were all having a great time we were drinking and made the comment God created whiskey to keep the Irish from ruling the world And Jerry took a cigarette and flicked it right at my face from across the table and hit me in the eye Fortunately wear glasses We both looked for him for a therapist and found this doctor that he went to that we were really excited about He was smart he was as smart as Jerry he could challenge him and it started out to be a really good thing and Jerry really looked forward to it because he could talk to somebody He found somebody that could really challenge him and talk to him Unfortunately along the way it fell into other traps and dont think in the end it was such a good thing didnt live in fear mean the day was afraid it was over The day got afraid and something happened to make me afraid we werent together anymore just had this really bad feeling and tried to call the house because he should have been there and he didnt answer the phone and just had a bad feeling so got in my car and drove back to the house And came in and he had taken a lot of pills and he was waving a gun that was the gun that Sam Peckinpah had given him and just went to look for his doctors phone number because just thought This is like something terrible is happening here And when came back he held the gun on me And basically in one form or another you know had the gun at my head and in my mouth and up against my head for the next or hours He had called the doctor before and left him a message that he was in trouble So he had reached out already The doctor had arranged to come and take him to the hospital and it was basically from that moment we were never together didnt see Jerry for years while he was married to Vera When Vera and Jerry started to break up guess was the first phone call And Jerry showed back up in my life and it was it was like the thing had dreamed of for all of those years One night we were having dinner somewhere in Westwood and remember Jerry starting to get angry for no reason mean it was we were having a very pedestrian conversation about something and out of nowhere he started to become infuriated So he got to the point where he stood up and he walked out of the restaurant So went trailing after him and when got up behind him remember grabbing him by the shirt going Whats the matter what did say what happened And he turned around and all of a sudden found like his fist was in the air and he was about to pummel me with it And he looked up at his hand and he looked down at me and he looked up at his hand and he kind of caught it and he and he pulled it back to himself and it was as if it was somebody elses hand Jerry and changed the nature of our relationship after that think on some level he was trying to back off and protect me from being subjected to that but the subtext to all of that also is that he had moved out from his place with Vera into another apartment and the landlady was Deri What the fuck is this Mace Mace For what Oh wild dogs Yeah wild dogs Thats bullshit Boyle Youve lied to me straight through havent you You want me to be honest with you No Salvador was not the kind of picture you would expect It wasnt a studio picture It didnt have any studio juggernaut behind it There was no money to promote it It showed for weeks as said in theaters in February months ago so it was forgotten Shit Holy shit Holy shit Theyre gonna fucking kill us now Boyle Goddamn it thought you knew your way around here Boyle Theyre gonna fucking kill us now goddamn it Theyre gonna fucking kill us Shut the fuck up Just be cool It was clear that both Jerry and Chuck Champlin thought it was just a terrific picture and the kind of picture that should have gotten attention but didnt Charles Champlin wrote a frontpage article in the Times It was a twopage article about this great forgotten classic And then Jerry Harvey called up and said Hey that was great that Chuck did that He said really believe in this film And he said believe Channel can have a little bit of influence He said m going to give this film a shot He said m gonna show it during December So he said While all the studios are screening their movies at every private screening room on the Bel whats called the Bel Air Beverly Hills circuit and while theyre showing them at theaters and so on this film which is not being shown anywhere is going to be shown on the Channel So there was the cover of Channel which everybody in the business got and everybody now saw Salvador this month right And the next thing you know Paul Newman in The Color of Money James Woods in Salvador get nominated for an Academy Award for best actor and Oliver and Richard Boyle who cowrote the screenplay got nominated for best screenplay Whats the most exciting thing for you about movie making Tonight Tonight is the most exciting thing about movie making believe me It was an amazing year and had Jerry not sort of pushed to have Chuck do the interview at the right time put Channel Magazine out with the Salvador picture on the cover with the whole cover shown it during that month that picture would have been completely forgotten and the kind of work that m most proud of just personally would never have been seen Are you kidding So you know think that personally ve always felt that that particular day with Chuck Champlin and with Jerry Harvey and what came of it was really the turning point in my career Without a doubt and the other competitors you know they had been wanting they had been wanting Channel gone for a long time It was many people were taking bets on when Channel would finally slide off the cliff And it was Jerrys tenacity and the stubborn reputation of Channel the fact that it was really beloved in the community those things worked together to keep kind of like floating like a castle in the air beyond its normal mortality Channel had at his peak think about paying subscribers There were others who think were stealing it We had people calling up to say Would it be possible to subscribe to the magazine without subscribing to the channel You know its like Why would you like to do that remember we had some new owners come in The ordered Channel for his home The cable man drove up to the home and said to the s wife not knowing who she was Give me bucks or whatever and ll give you Channel for free Jerry was very stressed at that time and unhappy at that time and l and guess somewhere in there is where the Salute to became a something we intended to do The Tribute in January of was a real highlight in think Jerrys life and think in the life of Channel We were about to be sold This was a moment of marshalling the troops Everybody who had benefited because of Channels existence was invited to come take part in a daylong series of panels One person that Jerry became very close to in the last couple of months of his life was film director Richard Brooks who directed Elmer Gantry In Cold Blood Looking for Mr Goodbar Jerry located certain films of Richard Brooks that had been forgotten such as Something of Value with Rock Hudson and Sidney Poitier When it comes time to kill the lion want to shoot the gun too Its Just show and you know how he feels about Africans and guns want to shoot the gun too m sorry Mithayla Always when we hunt it is the same You have all the fun do all the work but when we were little and played together But were big now and things are not the same Hit him Hit him hit him hard Do what he says Now And in a hurry Something of Value was a movie from the early fifties which deals with Apartheid It deals with the Mau Mau uprisings of the s in Africa which is a topic so relevant to contemporary history It was painfully relevant to the situation that was in South Africa at the in the late s You know Nelson Mandela was still in prison when we played Something of Value on Channel Remember me Kimani What do you want ve come home Jeff When Richard Brooks did Something of Value he managed to get Winston Churchill to do a short prologue Winston Churchill said The situation in South Africa is the most important thing in the world today blah blah you know turning a globe or something very important The problems of East Africa are the problems of the world This was true in and it is true today But you know the studio had said Get rid of the old fat guy right Its like Get rid of the old fat guy Its Winston Churchill So Winston Churchill got cut out of the picture right Its a small bit but you know Churchill had done him a huge favor so it did Richard Brooks heart a lot of good to see that put back in the picture There was a cause for hope in about September when the Rock Group bought the Channel and they had very ambitious plans They came to all the studios and said Were going to take it national we need your support Were going to really grow the subscriber base The vision was to do a sort of national satellite channel that would compete with and Showtime Jerry was happy He felt like hed found the right kind of wildcatters the right kind of cowboys that would understand his temperament and it just the future looked golden What do they call this place Just go over the rise there big town called Tombstone Fine town Tombstone Yeah heard of it Well me and my brothers might ride in there tonight get ourselves a shave maybe Glass of beer Yeah you would enjoy yourselves Wide awake wide open town Tombstone Get anything you want there Thank you Any children No They had agreed not to have kids They were both content with it And there was a point when Jerry made an ironic remark late in He said Well could have predicted this would happen You know and said What do you mean He said Well m gonna have to go in and have my vasectomy undone said Really Whats up And well Deri wants kids And you know reverse vasectomies you know usually dont work And so there was some frustration going on there between Deri and Jerry Jerry had told the doctors Look have a problem used to have a drinking problem Please dont give me any painkillers after the surgery is over You know that way can recover faster And they agreed He had the topical anesthetic but after that he was cold turkey just surviving it with gritted teeth the pain of what followed Unfortunately an infection followed and this time the doctors told him Look we have to perform the entire operation all over again And he said All right This time you use painkillers though He had the binge that he predicted but he was able to manage it because he saw it coming and he and Deri went off to Bora Bora and you know within a week and a half he was back up on top And it was he arrived from Bora Bora pretty much in time for the stock market crash Sadly just after the Rock Group bought the Channel the stock market went south in a big way in October of and all those ambitious plans were backburnered and unfortunately they were ultimately never realized could see the stress but he really did he was more concerned about his staff and that they not be worried or afraid or what have you than he you know seemed to be about himself One night in October of go to the movies with Jerry and Deri and we watch The Sicilian directed by Michael Cimino Its about to come out the next week Its a preview screening Were watching this film Its got very witty dialogue Its got tremendous energy to it but you know the official opinion on Cimino was hes a downer or something and Jerry said You know the hour minute cut is actually opening next week in Paris said It is He said Yeah m going You know Deri and have just made plans to go over And said Oh well m there too Oh it was such a wonderful time that we spent there in terms of getting to know them both It was again to be you know in Deris company mean she just loved being in Paris and it was just all positive and there was a special screening for us because wed come all this way and my feeling was that it was one of the best films of the year but the film was getting clobbered back in the United States And when he came back he called me to tell me that he was back and relayed to me how upset he was mean it almost went beyond you know like you had to say Jerry Jerry relax calm down Its youre making yourself sick over someone elses trials and tribulations You know one has to worry about themselves a little more Stop killing yourself worrying about other filmmakers problems Jerry had been receiving these inquiries from Joe Cohen who was an executive with Spectacor which owned Prism which had some success back east showing sports and movies combining them in one channel and it was Joes idea that the same could be done for Channel Given the conditions of that month of October it made a lot of sense The way to salvage all of this was to add sports programming and that was it And thus was born Plus which was everything you love about Channel plus the Dodgers and Angels The movie The Wild Bunch had a pretty profound effect upon my life It was about men in a changing world where the values were changing and they had kind of outlived a different world March of we all went to Guidos and that was another great evening That was like the Parisian trip all over again This time Michael Cimino was there and because had sort of gone to the wall for The Sicilian you know he and were now very comfortable with each other and so you know we were all all of us there and there was a cake that Deri had ordered from like this really special bakery mean it was the most amazing chocolate cake ve ever had and Michael had chosen the inscription which comes from John Ford from She Wore a Yellow Ribbon which is Lest we forget So that was on the cake And it was Michaels way of thanking you know me and Jerry both and boy you know its so amazing how the fates work because this was the last time we were all together and you know they could not have been luminous as a pair we could not have all been happier mean that night is now surrounded by a strange aura for me because it was so happy and we were all so together and the cake says Lest we forget One of the risks of taking on a partnership with a sports channel is that sporting events often run commercials Because there was this precedent and premium or pay television was defined as not having commercials we got into a battle with which escalated unfortunately into a lawsuit Channel felt that had teamed up with of the studios to prevent Channel from getting access to their films and Channel instituted a restraint of tradetype lawsuit against them Jerry was going to be the star witness in this lawsuit and was preparing to testify When try to understand what Jerrys state of mind was in the last couple of weeks of his life think that it had a lot to do with the fact that he was going up against his friends and old collaborators old business partners in court was quite worried about him the last time saw him and expressed concern to my partner and anyone else that would listen about it and didnt know what to do but he seemed that he was imploding The night that we inaugurated the sports channel mean they had all these baseball players up at the building and Jerry and took a long kind of Socratic walk around the block We walked we circled the block several times just talking it through and was full of dread and apprehension about how things were going to work and Jerry was being very positive Jerry was very ill at ease at the party and he had to say a few words and a lot of us all showed up in support of Jerry Up to the end he was telling me and other people Its going to be all right You know were going to prevail Its you know its good And he had the flu and basically that was it He had the flu he stayed home and then we did not see him again My college girlfriend the day of Jerrys death saw him kind of wandering through the sculpture gardens here at Didnt talk to him or anything but she knew him and she saw him just kind of walking through the sculpture gardens in a melancholy way The day he died you know m sure when she saw him he didnt know it was gonna be the day he died We got a call to come into the office on Sunday Somebody called me at home and said You need to come into the office right now It was at On a Sunday Yeah can be there Jerry didnt kill himself for an hour after he killed Deri and know that during that time the lucid part of him probably resurfaced know he called his psychiatrist know in a very sort of eerily calm way he described what he had done to his psychiatrist And its interesting know Jerry so well that didnt even need to read the police report to corroborate the vision that had in my head but knew he would go to his bed and knew he would sit down in that spot in a sort of slumped position that he always sat in and know that he must have spent an hour contemplating what it was that he had done and that he had come to the conclusion there was just no way that what he had done was acceptable enough to go on living and he put the gun to his temple and he selfexecuted himself think one of the more painful events in my life was sitting at the breakfast table cup of tea in front of me picking up the Times and thats how learned what happened to Jerry People are always asking why when something dreadful happens Truth is it doesnt matter why It happened was angry at him was angry at him for doing that and think many other people felt the same way and that may be one of the reasons this story hasnt been told for so many years Maybe people needed to go through a healing process for that But did see it coming When Jerry died his mother called me that day and a few months after that started to see her on a regular basis Maybe just wanted to know the answer Maybe there was a reason why everyone at a certain age came to this realization that they had come from a bad seed We dont know And maybe part of my association with her was sort of because was really curious to know as well because as much as pushed Jerry away wanted to understand the story After Jerry died it was right at the time within a week or two of when Channel started broadcasting sports and guess you could say Channel died when Jerry died Channel died when sports came on Well there was a year between Jerrys death and the end of Channel So while those events were certainly clearly linked in peoples minds they werent directly linked perhaps We were showing The Silence by Ingmar Berman The end a very climactic scene Its all about the quest for God Is there God or is there just silence And here we reach you know the climax of the movie Then comes on at the bottom of the frame a yellow Chyron that says Dont miss the Dodgers game coming up next at on Channel Well The Channel was really about content Heres what we love We love movies and heres a whole bunch of them and heres some really interesting people talking about them To be included within all these great filmmakers and to hopefully have opened somebody elses eyes out there you know mean because thats what Channel did do just show the ordinary filmgoer that there was a whole other world out there And so feel very privileged to be a part of that Theres been no place since in my mind that has done quite what Channel has done in sort of bringing all different kinds of film together in a way that really brings out the best in films by showing it in a context of everything that is movies The Channel being what it was and being a remarkable achievement if you compare that with what Jerry eventually did and how he died and what he did prior to his death theres this sense of creating a hero where perhaps one is inappropriate and have problems with that Whatever think sort of positive feelings there were about Jerry at that point and it sort of trumped everything You werent going to get around the fact that he murdered his wife had a feeling in my mind that Jerry had other options that there was other options for him That doesnt make it right m not saying anything about how you leave this Earth or dont leave this Earth just always had in the back of my mind and still do that there would he had other options They cant be diminished when we all stand up and have to say our names about who is responsible for this piece of shit or this masterpiece whos responsible You know everybody wants to take credit but he was an intricate part of all of those films that he touched Even though he had nothing to do with them when they were made there was still a living nurturing that brought those films that otherwise think would been lost forever like him Louise Brooks one of Jerrys favorite actresses and one of mine always liked to quote Goethe Goethe would say human life remains of consequence not because of what we leave behind but because we act and inspire and rouse others Damn it Sorry human life remains of consequence not because of what we leave behind but because we act and inspire and rouse others to action and inspiration We act and inspire and rouse others to action and enjoyment And so when think of the legacy of Jerry Harveys life think of it in those terms think you know hes not a guy who left much behind What he left behind was in a lot of ways wreckage and very tragic and costly wreckage The films that got left behind that he midwifed are part of the action and inspiration of his life He acted and inspired others to value these things of beauty Youre listening to Castaways Choice m John McNally Our castaway this week is Jerry Harvey
