When l saw them at the theatre l never imaged ld be one of them Then it just happened l am a buffoon My last television appearance caused a terrible uproar Demonstrations insults protests This can be a source of honour to someone in my field But the applause wasnt only for me lt was also for Silvio Berlusconi and mostly to the people who allowed him to go so far Before being elected he swore he would never take advantage of his overwhelming power over the media But less than a year later he delivered his Sofia Edict The use that Biagi the other guy Santoro okay but the other one and Luttazzi have made of public television paid for with public money is criminal You work for a public service Control yourself Santoro Right l work for a public service not for you Berlusconi lve been inviting Berlusconi on the show for two months but he wont come lve even written letters but he wont reply lts a pity because my first question would be about his past ld ask him Berlusconi where did you get your money Because no one knows But luckily this book has just come out its called The Scent of Money and sheds light on this mystery Tonights guest is the author Marco Travaglio l think the new administration has the duty of preventing this from happening again After the Travaglio interview four lawsuits were filed one by Silvio Berlusconi for billion one by his party Forza ltalia for and his two corporations Fininvest for and Mediaset also for total of billion lve been trying to go back to work for over two years lve done everything humanly possible lve been through every court in ltaly and even been proved right magistrate has requested that l be reinstated in my job l havent heard from anyone since Mr Sacc sent the letter that terminated my contract with advice of delivery which is the thing l find most offensive l was fired by advice of delivery So l wouldnt be able to say no one told me To make sure l really knew l was fired l on behalf of my electors Youre only one person Yes our coalition Casa delle Libert We believe its a matter of freedom to not have to hear someone compare us to the Mafia or Berlusconi to Mussolini on public Biagi did a show in which l was present so l can tell you l heard him compare Berlusconi to Mussolini That cannot happen its a matter of freedom Why cant it happen Why cant someone compare Berlusconi to Mussolini Why cant someone compare at pm or pm or pm or midnight Berlusconi to Mussolini Santoro had been a successful talk show host for years and was replaced by a Berlusconi employee Enzo Biagi the most popular journalist in ltaly a Al employee for more than years the one who announced the end of fascism and Nazism was replaced by someone from Berlusconis press office The only questions allowed now are like this ls Kerrys defeat and Bushs victory a lesson for the Left God willing Current affairs shows are full of recipes ln ltaly the production of olive oil is very important even in Lazio Ovenbaked pasta a classic ltalian family recipe From starter to dessert foie gras And a certain Bruno Vespa has been entrusted with of the indepth analysis of the news The Virgin Mary crying blood is quite shocking as it is When did your daughter first see the Virgin Mary The nd of February The day the statue of Mary cried You mean the tears No the statue crying is one thing the vision of the Holy Virgin is another lsnt this whole thing surprising No because it goes along with the other things that are happening ls it serious What does it mean lt means that theres no real opposition l dont mean regarding the basic ideals l mean daily life the protection of our citizens the freedom of the people So why didnt the previous centreleft government pass a law to protect its citizens from Berlusconis overwhelming power over the media And when asked for an explanation why did they always seem annoyed This has been said at least times now As in all of human behaviour mistakes happen law like that would have looked like Hed just lost the election and his coalition was saying that Berlusconi was washed up and they wanted to bet on another horse At that stage to attack him with a law on conflict of interest would have been a risk not worth running lt was a mistake The effects of that mistake were devastating to our country One of them is that the parliament is constantly bogged down with Silvio Berlusconis dilemmas People protest but the opposition is never behind the organization of those protests They actually react hostile to mass mobilization One law Berlusconi made for himself is the notorious Gasparri law lt guarantees Berlusconis right to keep his monopoly of ltalian removes the requirement he give up one of his three channels and enlarges his possibilities of future gain and expansion So when Paolo Ruffini the general manager of Al chosen by the opposition among a list the majority felt cozy with asked me to do a new satire show l decided to dedicate the first episode to the Gasparri law And to make it known l wouldnt go along with the current trend l called it Alot Four days before it was to air a press conference took place Ruffini expressed his satisfaction of Alot lm especially pleased with this show lt explores satire with intelligence and innovation The writing skill is really exceptional here But the same person a few hours before transmission called and said hed decided to cancel the show We went into this little room and he asked me if l wanted to sit down And then he said Theyve cancelled the show l thought it was a joke He said that the political climate probably wasnt appropriate it wasnt right it was too risky l was extremely perplexed My collaborators and l scheduled a press conference to protest this injustice Ruffini changed his mind again and the first episode was aired Ladies and gentlemen good evening l chose to appear with a sword as to say if its my turn to kick the bucket lm ready You know that ltaly is ranked rd worldwide for freedom of information Has anyone mentioned that on Was it on the news No lf it had been we wouldnt be in rd position Minister Gasparri many say your law legitimises the existing monopolies instead of solving problems lts beneficial to Berlusconis corporation Mediaset Thats paranoia There was always someone at school who got straight s and said the teacher had it in for him People always find controversy l must not have explained myself Many people criticize your Sl integrated communication system Lets use CocaCola as an example CocaCola has a dominant position among carbonated drinks So does orange soda Orange soda isnt in a dominant position To stop CocaCola from being dominant l extend the definition drink to all liquids like whiskey river water sea water and ocean water Then l say Look at all the water in the world CocaCola is no longer the dominant liquid But thats a trick But its also a shame l like CocaCola as it is l dont want river or sea or ocean water in it Coke is good as it is Why add other things to it message to all channels While travelling and meeting many other important people throughout the global world lve been told that in ltaly mass media is in the hands of a single person l want you to know were looking and we will find him The public was enthusiastic viewing figures skyrocketed None of the following episodes was ever aired Rai l Bl How can satire be outlawed in the year lt goes against Article of our constitution against international law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights How can something be censored despite the peoples protests Heres a practical example of conflict of interest Al needs an excuse to cancel the programme Mediaset Berlusconis corporation gives them one announcing a million euro lawsuit Als governmentappointed managers suspend the show even before reading the lawsuit claiming to protect the station from damages The Al Board of Directors is made up of an executive officer Cattaneo with ties to a postfascist party and also a friend of the Berlusconi family four advisors chosen by Berlusconis administration and a president chosen by the opposition among a list of names the majority felt cozy with Every member of the Board including the president Annunziata signed the motion suspending Alot forever Why didnt you say you cant cancel the show This is a democracy But we also had to find a way You would have been cancelled Why Because it was four against one But theres no legal basis You made me look crosseyed speak dialect and count for fuckall Your opinion of me isnt going to change So l havent made myself clear As president of Al its my duty to say no more satire unless its rigorously fenced in lm president and l was chosen by both the Left and the Right l dont count for anything but l see fences clearly We need fences they must be established intuitively l studied a long time in America and theres a professional who establishes fences the Double Watcher Sadly in ltaly we have to get by using intuition But we can do it Ones freedom ends where the freedom of others starts There are about five billion others With one fence per person that means five billion fences lf you cant establish them it means you dont have the sensitivity to work in a public office The American language has a lovely word for fence Guantanamo The debate was brought to parliament to the Watchdog Commission over which Berlusconi has a huge majority As far as Alot is concerned there was no censorship because there was no satire What we saw on Al was a long series of insults to the prime minister to the majority that supports him in parliament and the companies hes set up Therefore its Als duty to safeguard itself from the legal consequences of what it airs Guzzanti was wrong to stage a political rally and not the satire for which she was paid Shes an actress Guzzanti should be satisfied just being a clown an actress lf she wants to change jobs and join parliament theres plenty of room And l must say that the average intelligence of ltalian Ps is such that she would undoubtedly be a great success Maybe that should be off the record Too late Who has the institutional power to prevent such an abuse of power The president of the Watchdog Commission He could go with his commission to the ltalian President Ciampi and the leaders of the Chambers and say law has been broken Something must be done But Petruccioli chosen by the opposition among a list of names the majority felt cozy with did nothing Thats not true Many things happened with Alot We intervened and forced the executives and Board of Directors to publicly deal with the problem The problem is much more general l would call it a misinterpretation of satire in ltaly News isnt meant to be reported by jokers but by reporters And if reporters fail to do it correctly and thoroughly we cant just put comedians on to do it Thats the problem we have to face if we want to work out this matter Petrucciolis opinion is included in Mediasets court case along with opinions of critics from the major ltalian newspapers Censuring satire is inconceivable but Alot isnt satire According to Mediasets attorneys satire should make politicians appear more human more appealing and relieve social tensions ln no way whatsoever is satire given the right to contribute to public opinion This means that satire mustnt and cannot make people think l was told Theres a difference between satire and making fun People often get confused between what satire is and simply making fun of someone Making fun of someone is ridiculing their mishaps For example someone tripping an old lady falling messing up words someone eating too much someone grabbing a girls bum someone being obnoxious etc What isnt satire is making fun Whats the criteria for saying somethings not satire You cant just say its insulting Well it has to be funny lt was very funny lf it makes you cry Satire can be bitter too At least make one smile lt did At least include something humorous lt was Yes it was But whats your point News reporters must accept the rules of reporting Satirists must accept the rules of satire What are these rules of satire lts not a matter of rules its the kind of show you did Why are you talking about rules Dario Fo says its satire everyone says its satire satirists and professors who teach it say it is Satire without information doesnt make sense You cant have political satire without presenting facts Aristophanes incorporated political rallies in his comedies And they were called parabases The best of the chorus was the choryphaeus and hed step away from the chorus get in the front row so everyone could see and say l now talk to the city Hed say anything he wanted about war or politics Satire must touch the tragic situations in a persons life lt has to be about politics All important plays from Shakespeare to Marlowe are full of situations dealing with politics Yet lve been prevented from doing it so many times l was told to act like an artist an actor Dont bother meddling in Let politicians do politics you stick to making us laugh l started doing sketches on a popular French show called Nul Par Ailleurs l did political sketches not journalism Seven or eight years later l got tired of just sketches Since it was pure entertainment the public didnt get the reasons behind my sketches the real meaning of my work So l talked to the programmers at Canal and suggested a news programme that would provide the news through reporting as well as sketches ln one of these sketches we killed President Chirac lt was a parody of Tarantinos film Pulp Fiction We called it Peuple Fiction People Fiction The people wanted to know what happened to Chiracs promises See lt went off by itself Why have you screwed with us Why have you fucked over your people Look Have you read the Bible l will fight social injustice so our nation shall prosper lf l fail the sovereign people shall inflict their punishment Yes l said that France For All Page Line The skill lies in accepting excess lf you say You can go this far but no further thats negotiating but then its not satire anymore Satire might upset you it might be controversial but it relies on the maturity and the intellectual capacity of its intended public The most popular shows in France right now are the satirical ones and thats the case throughout Europe Politics are looked down on so much that satire works great Theres one show that makes fun of Chirac in a very harsh way His character is ridiculous and an impulsive liar populist a very nonserious person This goes on in France every evening When democracy is afraid of caricature fears criticism and fears being laughed at it is that democracy that has problems democracy thats strong and selfconfident fair and honest isnt afraid of being laughed at lt says Youre right l messed up About people work at the guignol laboratory Organizers dubbers puppeteers makeup artists and writers lt is a satirists paradise Theres a caricature of everyone with no boundaries whatsoever Even Berlusconi is here They know about him and listen to our story very attentively One man has power media and business ls that right Can you talk about it or not Not according to Berlusconi According to the Left you can but comedians cant So whos going to talk about it No one All that matters is Berlusconis opinion People mock power in France no matter who it is But thats nonexistent in ltaly ln ltaly the main trend of the press and political commentators is to fear the powerful and to show reverence no matter who they are left or rightwinged Berlusconi or Alema You said no more satire against the royal family l said satire is okay because freedom of opinion is allowed As long as its performed with taste When the Dutch Prime Minister dared make a comment about a satirical programme because he said it offended the queen he was ridiculed by every newspaper lt only led to yet another sketch being inspired Every week we enjoy watching yours as well as other satirical programmes Theres only one problem lts too polite not harsh enough and too politically correct But how did the ltalian press react to our situation They dedicated a lot of space to it hundreds of articles were printed Mostly saying the problem wasnt censorship it was the programme l expected Santoro Biagi Luttazzi and Guzzantis getting fired would result in a revolt of Al journalists lnterventions television strikes But none of that happened Maybe since at first no phone calls are being made it looks like everyone is against censorship But the people up high have the ability to make a few phone calls as long as its all done in hours lts always that way a few calls come in and then the diversionary tactics start The diversionary tactic this time was lt was obscene smut Hl Hl lts not humour its journalism Then controversy grows and the facts get altered lts easier to see now as you look back at the series of events that occurred We should have considered the event as a whole instead of focussing on one aspect or another of the programme When the press feels that a certain thing isnt worth the fight for politicians they end up letting it go even when they react positively at first like in this case defamatory campaign was started in order to change the way censorship was seen by the public Sl lGl KlLl Ll Ll Sl Even the Riformista took part in the defamatory campaign and its supposed to be a leftwinged paper They said hysterical soliloquy against the Good thing it was cancelled public isnt Hyde Park Corner where anyone can voice their opinion lt was political propaganda just dying to get censored The point is this lm against mixing news and satire actually lm against substituting one for the other due to the particular abnormality of ltalian media You cant say that since ltalian news is ridiculous comedians can broadcast the news lm not saying that the problem with news on is Alot or Sabina Guzzanti lm not saying that lm saying that Alot is not the solution to the problem But they cancelled it anyway You said it wasnt censorship so they had a right to cancel it Thats what amazes me Not the right to cancel it just not air it l remember l was upset right then but then l started a tour And during rehearsals some good news came in lt wasnt going to take years to find out who won The judge filed the case on grounds that Berlusconis lawsuit was unfounded There was no defamation because it was a satirical programme and therefore can make use of sarcasm ln addition everything that was said was basically true The problem is that according to our constitution monopolies cannot exist No one is allowed to control such a large amount of mass media or advertising resources Then how did Berlusconi manage to do that His political connections and especially his friendship with Craxi Because of these political connections Berlusconi enjoyed unlimited credit from banks and the market went crazy He bought Thorn Birds for an unbelievable amount of money and no one said a word And his membership in the Masonic lodge was a great advantage to Berlusconi because a lot of men in key positions at major ltalian banks belonged to the Masonic lodge runamok Even Tax Police generals belonged to the ones who were supposed to do tax inspections Not all of them obviously but many of them This brief introduction may help answer the question How could Silvio Berlusconi be so good at his business matters but be so untalented when dealing with our issues The answer is that he isnt really a selfmade man lt has little to do with his business capacities So if the things that were said are true lf what was said were true lmplicitly what can we deduce from that That our parliament is full of previous offenders What can we deduce from this That our prime minister uses his position for personal wealth lf these horrible things were true then our leaders who allow and have allowed him to do that what kind of leaders are they Leaders who we should kick out immediately And if their intentions were good why then after the case was dropped why didnt the censors let us back on Good morning can we interview you lf youd asked me minutes ago minutes minutes ago ld have said yes Good morning can we interview you please Were conducting an inquiry about Alot We wanted your opinion No opinion So you cant say lm not giving you a chance to justify your actions lm busy Excuse me can we ask you a few questions about Alot Seeing as the show was cancelled because of legal problems and that the case was dismissed do you think l could go back on air Do you realise that youve violated article of the Constitution that says everyone has the right to free expression and that you made up an excuse to cancel the show Your position is very interesting lm not sure whether l agree on everything you say but there must be something lf it got cancelled there must be a reason What l think it was just an excuse The Mediaset lawsuit You think they were excuses The executives and Board evaluated the situation and found the show damaging to the stations interests Thats why it was closed But the lawsuit was unfounded People should evaluate the grounds of their case first Or l could just sue any programme and youd shut it down but you cant There were even some papers not rightwinged ones that emphasized Al must defend itself if theyre sued They wanted billions Al cant take such a big risk Lets wait and let the courts make a decision first l read that lts insane isnt it lts outrageous because you should make decisions based on facts not probabilities Otherwise the risk of blackmail would halt all forms of expression lf you make comments on things you got from papers but they dont want you to talk about it they sue you for billions Therefore you can never mention it again and youre dragged into a long case involving time money etc One can conclude then that currently in ltaly theyre admitting that corporations have gagged mass media Have you been sued Yes lt was just to scare me or they would have sued the paper too But it doesnt explain why one person was picked on out of a larger context Usually the case is made against the paper who published it but they only sued me so l assume it was just a threat which l can deal with in my work Youre used to it Yes Agnes wanted million euros million euros Yes because of the pay number issue And Telecom wanted billions This time were talking about euros Cut it down just a little and lll pay gladly since l can afford to do it a couple times a year At least l write about the things you should So its our fault little Youre avoiding the responsibility So we have to join Alex Zanotelli Luigi Ciotti and a few rock singers because theyre the only ones who talk about facts anymore Theres no point in writing for the Corriere they wont publish it lts happened at least times l get angry on your behalf They send you out on a job you wait in lines You take notes and they only publish a few words of what you wrote Maybe You should get angry Who said l dont But You should rebel lf what l said was true why did audiences learn about them on a satire show Maybe Alot was the proof that ltalian news is a farce The surprise Good evening Can we hear a duet between Apicella and Berlusconi Lets do a world premiere something never done before like Jealousy Did you write the lyrics This song is dedicated to my wife Lets put the mike here or the sound will be distorted Move the mike away l have to teach you everything l just cant describe Bruno Vespas Porta a Porta My paper asked me to do a piece on programmes and freedom of the press l just cant describe Porta a Porta to the French public Theres no equivalent There is no single figure who manages so much of the media so much real power not virtual power That doesnt exist so lve never been able to write about it For me journalism doesnt mean talking about cheese or giving the microphone to whoevers in power at the moment Journalism is independent it means asking questions And above all following up on them politician from the Left or the Right can talk rubbish but the second question is crucial because it exposes him lt exposes him ltalian journalists today have a huge responsibility but they often end up being cowards lts sad to say but this way of keeping a low profile of not getting to the bottom of things and not making a decision makes journalism in ltaly as despicable a profession as politics is Hello Minister Can we talk for a minute lts the one year anniversary since Alot was axed The judge threw the case out and what we said was true so why cant we go back on the air The show being suspended didnt depend on me l think you said questionable things but there was no facetoface discussion lt was satire that isnt required This is a serious matter Satire is one thing debate is another And that was satire lts like that in every country No it isnt You mentioned this law without letting anyone stick up for it That was your choice so its a matter of being fair law the President did not sign lt was approved by parliament then signed by him The law l mentioned was found unconstitutional and wasnt signed Not because of the reasons you gave Turn off the cameras Okay its true l didnt write or even read my law l just cant l start reading it at night and fall asleep You pass out Yes lts crazy Can you do me a favour Of course Could you write a summary or Cliff Notes of my law Just like twenty pages so l know what it says And while youre at it since some of your questions put me on the spot write down some hard questions and the answers too okay Like People say someone from Mediaset wrote the law Exactly l wouldnt know what to say lt would put you on the spot Like totally ld have to say Mediaset like whats that People dont want to hear insults and gratuitous spite But viewing figures were high people liked it People dont want to hear The cameras not on me anymore so Here it is l was waiting for it to come back The public doesnt want to hear But people do theres no doubt Satire cant be insulting People want that you cant deny it lts you lot who dont The public liked it No l dont think people want to see vulgar and coarse satire Have you asked the public Because people protested Thousands of people Look lm a colleague of your fathers and hes from the CentreRight You asked to cancel it not the public l discussed it with your father whos a CentreRight senator lm an adult l dont ask my fathers permission No but since hes a senator one might want to consult him too Whats your point My point is we all represent our electorate The electorate didnt elect you to cancel shows you dont like and to monopolize the media They wouldnt have voted for you Of course But thats what youve done Santoro Biagi Luttazzi me Tagliafico anyone who has a different opinion than you Those who cant express themselves in like me are in parliament or somewhere else saying what theres no point in saying on Why is there no point Who says you cant express yourself on Lilli Gruber Santoro and the others youve mentioned all use as a means of breaking into politics l was politically active outside parliament for years so you can do the same But lm not active in a party lm fighting for people to know what laws our parliament passes lm fighting so people can exercise their right to criticise l want to exercise my right to criticize on People have a right to express other opinions on dont they And l want to exercise my right to criticize saying You dont criticize you cancel shows that l dont agree with your idea of what satire is That isnt satire its gratuitous vulgarity Name one vulgar thing Forget it l wont forget it Vulgar is not an appropriate term Can you guarantee that everything l say will go on the programme lf you say something interesting Go ahead We havent finished Tell me something Havent you found anything worth including Goodbye and good luck Good luck to all us ltalians under the fascist regime See you when you get your show back and l can criticize it again How will l get it back when youve thrown us all out As soon as possible because l like criticizing it But you cancelled my show you didnt criticize it You cancelled the show lt didnt work out for you lt wasnt a coming into office it was a seizing of power l always wrote in my editorials that in this sense their concept is revolutionary Technically Revolutionary in the Thatcherist or Reaganist meaning of the word Or even more the beginning of a new era This man is the prime minister of ltaly lts all mine ltalian newspapers l pass the laws l want everything Of course l am a fascist So what Fascism is good Fuck everyone Such a catastrophe could even happen here in France We had the habit in our house to bind the newspapers according to year When l was little ld climb my fathers bookshelf and get these big books of newspapers down l used to wonder why they didnt understand At first there were so many people who later became antifascist and even joined the Resistance who took part Theyd say very weak things like Despite everything ltaly is still democratic etc And that is how l realized how fascism came to be Going through all the pages of these newspapers l saw the rise of fascism as a comic strip Each volume got more and more fascist And so on And at the final issue of that year it was fullblown fascism l Pl Back then persuasion meant intimidating physically scaring Now persuasion is intimidating and psychologically scaring until you realize your career is on the line along with your future the jobs you might have You see people who get rewarded while youre left behind so you decide to jump on the bandwagon Then the European Parliament and the lnternational Press Federation and even the in expressed great concern for the diminishing freedom of expression in ltaly Freedom House an important international observer ranked ltaly at th place in the world for freedom of expression after several South American and African countries Up until ltaly was considered a free country but became a partly free country in regime wins points when the opposition keeps quiet They think that by keeping quiet and putting up with minor violations of a democracy l dont mean deportations or assassinations but instances of censorship and aggression towards individuals Believing that being the opposition means complaining too much Lowering your tone etc This strengthens the regime and its power of impunity That is historical experience Can we list some cases of censorship you included in your book We all know the personal cases They chose a few to teach everyone a lesson Like Biagi Santoro Luttazzi Freccero Sabina Guzzanti and Paolo Rossi More money Money Money More and more money l took this farce of Molires and adapted it to our situation lm one of you so dont forget it Someone who used to be where you are now and whos now where youll never be lm here but especially We had million viewers at am on the first night The next day the ltalian Associated Press called asking why it was interrupted after the first act l called Al but no one seemed to know why ln the first press release they said it was blasphemous and in the second that my words were too harsh We believe in freedom in all its multiple and vital forms Even taking away freedoms is a form of freedom For the first time l decided to break the cycle of censor censuring and the censured complaining and refuse to let the thing die So l decided to file a lawsuit Ferruccio De Bortoli is a perfect example in the world of press They established a precedent They can fire the editorinchief of a newspaper even if they dont own it l gave up the editorship of Corriere della Sera a year ago lt was a completely personal decision lts no secret that l had problems with the prime minister and its no secret that his lawyers are persisting with various lawsuits l must say that l find this to be rather significant of a pathology in the system Unfortunately in ltaly the phenomenon exists of who doesnt agree with me is the enemy therefore allied with those who are against me You cant have professionals who are allowed to perform their job fairly sometimes bravely Weve lost the Corriere and ltalian democracy has lost its most important newspaper The newspaper is lost The new editorinchief is honest and respectable but he is not like my friend exeditor De Bortoli lts a scandal that they fired Biagi and Santoro Excuse me lf theyre capable of firing Biagi and Santoro they could easily fire us were less important And no one could do anything not even raise an eyebrow because Berlusconi is ruthless Then we got involved with the daily cases of censorship at radio news reports Often editors say to their reporters l got a phone call We cant talk about this anymore lt happens all the time its a matter of numbers This seriously Never so violently Entire stories were not allowed to be mentioned Even page formats News stories arent prioritised according to journalistic standards lts a completely different matter its political And there are cases of structural censorship like what happened with Channel it was preventive Since Channel is an independent station lets kill it from the start so it cant be independent Well have someone who we can control buy it well do favours for him and hell do some for us Well make sure he doesnt call the people we kick off other channels otherwise its pointless ls the prime minister happy about the new independent channel Are you happy What the hell What the hell are you saying But its a forprofit station lts a disgrace Why ls the profit for me or someone else Someone else Well then l see Thats a conflict of interest How lt is all right But Mr Prime Minister You either have democracy or censorship The two things cannot coexist lf what happened to people like Santoro Biagi Luttazzi Tagliafico Rossi etc etc was censorship all our members of parliament would have nailed themselves to their seats They would have gone on hunger strike Yet our members of parliament still hesitate to use the word censorship Lets say right now Al is noticing some restriction on pluralism that lll have to explain better The opposition is somehow going along with the rules of the game because they accepted them Because theyre playing the game Because from that point of view l think one side decided to stop attacking for real To stop pressing the question as long as they could keep the little they had l dont think the opposition has any idea whats going on lf tomorrow all the present party leaders came back theyd still make of the same mistakes they made in and would still be trying to get their men back in The opposition has to realize they need a new concept a revolution of the ltalian television and radio system They need to give up control of television Zapatero was elected and immediately started abolishing the law that let the prime minister appoint public executives l hope that is irreversible and that people in ltaly want it too once the regime has fallen if it ever does Because its not tolerable that political parties appoint public television The problem goes beyond Berlusconi because politicians took possession of Al long before Berlusconi ever got into politics He got involved and took advantage of a situation other people had created Thats why CentreLeft parties dont say a word about this kind of logic they see nothing strange about it ln a Left party leader made shocking declarations to the House Very few ltalians were ever aware of it Berlusconi knows that in he was guaranteed that his corporation wouldnt be touched if the government changed He knows and and so does Honourable Letta But you called us a regime back then even though we didnt pass a law against conflict of interest we allowed Berlusconi to run for office despite his media license and Mediasets sales jumped while we had the majority On behalf of which of your voters were these decisions made And in the interest of whom Some of the laws most detrimental to the CentreLeft and most favourable to Berlusconi and his cronies were made when the CentreLeft had majority lm talking about whitecollar crime laws laws regarding public television that saved Mediasets Channel the shelving of the AntiCorruption Commission the laws on conflict of interest Why did Berlusconi cause the twoChamber commission to fail after the CentreLeft made laws that were not in the interest of the general public but were laws that Berlusconi and his cronies asked for ln February Furio Colombo after a long struggle with leftwing leaders was forced to resign from the leftist paper Unit since it questioned Berlusconis legitimacy more than any other newspaper Why were so many of them persuaded that its wrong and damaging to so passionately deal with the man that is so determined to ruin the country freedom and the constitution and regurgitate fascism moral psychological and political poverty as well as preNazi thought like that of the Northern League Why must one want to communicate with someone we dont want to listen to because he has nothing to tell us This is the mystery l leave you with Freedom means saying lf that is granted all else follows said Orwell What is obvious ridiculous and true must be defended lts obvious that if our freedom of expression is restricted whoever governs can do whatever he wants Think about me who by law cannot run for office or even become a representative is now prime minister of the country That is so exhilarating This should give every citizen lots of hope Just relax Using money nobody knows where it came from And even though everyone knew it no one stopped me The opposition was elected so theyd pass a law against conflict of interest and they didnt even do it They see all my china and drop to their knees So l generously tell them Help yourselves Yes When they axed Alot we performed it live and fellow artists jokesters and musicians all came For the first time more than small stations tuned in by satellite so it was seen all over ltaly on and the lnternet ln many towns public viewings were organized in theatres We raised hell l want to be free to talk and listen Since Al wont let us watch it we had to go somewhere where we could Were here to protect what freedom we have left The funny thing is that we didnt come to laugh but were having fun lve gone up and down this corridor ten times You cant imagine whats going on out there message for the people outside the auditorium Please do not push and ruin this celebration Thank you Tell them theres no more room But theres a giant screen They can see it there Do you see it Thats outside Hello and thanks for coming ld like to tell all the people outside the gate that you alone are people They go all the way to the bus stop Revolution is possible here in the corridor ln this white light lts not a coincidence that were like a spaceship The CentreLeft has to get a move on They should run a freedom of information campaign lf they dont its their problem not the Rights When the Left was in power they didnt do anything For future memory the freedom we have now we fought for ourselves And freedom isnt the chance to vote against ourselves For future memory so many people came it looked like a miracle So many people came there was no reason to worry anymore l am a buffoon and l did my job so seeing the people was the reward And l wasnt the only one to see There were many witnesses including you lt wasnt funny at all
