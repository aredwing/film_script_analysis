dont often confess but must admit that until recently d never read Paul Nizan Nizan was an angry young man raging against all the injuries that the world inflicted then and now Hes angry with the philosophers he heard lecturing at the Sorbonne talking about Man with a capital but never about men with a small m men starving to death or murdered in wars or beaten up in police stations all over the world Hes angry with the liberal bourgeois writers of his time whose names we all know great writers who spend so much time contemplating every nook and cranny of their souls that the yre always years too old to tell the young who ask the m when to act and how Paul Nizan is a wakeup call Thats why you should read him You may say Why introduce us to such a rude young man His rudeness is why you should read him We dont lack polite writers What we lack and need are rude ones This plea for a writer raging against the establishment was broadcast in prime time on one of Frances two channels In the s government control over the news was not always very subtle The information Minister felt free to invite himself on air to unveil his revamped news program Weve invited Minister Alain Peyrefitte to present the new format that he has commissioned Minister would you like to explain to our viewers why you ordered the se changes to the news program First because all recipes grow stale Unless we change we become boring For example the idea of illustrating the Council of Ministers meeting with scenes of their cars arriving at the Elyse Palace was new at first but after ten years of repetition the festival of car doors opening and closing has grown a little tedious For the journalists of today the se scenes from April epitomize a dark age the prehistory of their profession Happily most of them agree things are very different now ve been in since ve seen a censorship that went unsaid ve seen selfcensorship that went unsaid and ve seen the gradual rise under President Mitterrand mostly during the powersharing period of a total freedom thats never been revoked The Government had to open up or lose its credibility In the old days Alain Peyrefitte had a direct line to every office in the public broadcasting Thats all history Weve come a long way no question Weve come a long way Since then has burst into color There are many more channels For most journalists news reporting today rests on three pillars Independence Objectivity and Pluralism which safeguard the medias democratic role So Should we like Paul Nizan rage against the watchdogs the se journalists press pundits and media stars who like the writers of the s bow down to the powers that be Of course not All that has changed So we have taken steps to ensure that the French news accurately mirrors every highway and byway of France and the world What a classic Its extraordinary to see the Information Minister telling the public These are the steps that we the Government have taken to improve the news It seems long ago It seems antiquated or Soviet Antiquated or Soviet Anne Sinclair and Christine Ockrent two celebrity news anchors agree that their profession has moved on The guests are unanimous These days journalists have no ties with politicians They do their job free of any outside influence We tested this the ory at the National Assembly at the Political Book Prize ceremony a rare occasion when top journalists agree to mix with politicians Dont be surprised to see the former Head of News of Frances key public channel kissing an exinterior Minister convicted of breach of trust Its all an act Behind the se social smiles and kisses the newshounds are ready to pounce The Fourth Estate knows that independence is a daily struggle Todays journalists take no prisoners Raphalle Bacqu the prizewinner for her book on recent prime ministers doesnt mince words know no other country where you could find twelve such eminent politicians so skilled at analyzing and explaining what power is about France can rest easy Its still the great country of politics Used to parrying such deadly blows the Speaker of the National Assembly has the perfect riposte how much we appreciate the intelligence and judgment of the se great writers and voices of French political journalism The Speaker knows hes not among friends Take Laurent Joffrin exchief editor of an opposition newspaper that prides itself on keeping politicians at arms length Saying tu means youre too friendly People call their workmates tu As working journalists we say tu to many people who arent our friends Talking to the French President is a different matter There has to be a respectable distance Sincere belief or sales pitch few years ago Laurent Joffrin said say tu to Sarko like he does to everybody So what It doesnt stop me bawling him out When it comes to bawling out Sarkozy Laurent Joffrin knows his stuff About economic policy Frances economy is performing somewhat better than its neighbors It would be unfair to deny the Government credit for it Given the se good results my question is My week is starting well m here to help What comes next Wait for it After what you just said Get it off your chest Honestly We respect the facts even if they favor you Does it hurt Doctor The director of Libration has needled French presidents for years with his nononsense almost impudent style Monsieur Chirac my question may offend you but presidential candidates have to face tough questions Absolutely storm of debate has been raised by a newspaper article concerning an apartment that you or your family rents in central Paris do You do Youve been criticized for benefiting in a way from a disproportionately low rent considering the amenities and nature of the apartment You have said its all legal and above board and nobody has doubted your word but isnt it awkward imagewise You risk being regarded as someone who benefits in all honesty as everyone agrees who benefits as others do too from privileges that ordinary citizens dont have since you seem to pay a very low rent for that apartment Your question doesnt shock me at all One minute and two seconds to ask a question Chirac is on the ropes always admire and feel grateful We thank you ladies and gentlemen of the political press who substantially shape our compatriots opinions To all of you extend my deepest thanks You play a clear role in keeping our democracy alive These people arent freelance or parttime journalists Theyre the stars of the trade They shape the news and the political and economic debate in France If you look at the se celebrities you see the yre very similar to politicians and business leaders They have many social traits in common They share the same social background Looking at famous French journalists you see very few from workingclass or rural families You find plenty of doctors children diplomats and industrialists children Coming from similar backgrounds the yre familiar with each other Theyve also had the same education We think most journalists went to journalism school but Ockrent Pujadas and Elkabbach for example all graduated from Sciences Po Claire Chazal and Emmanuel Chain are alumni So the se star journalists arent ordinary reporters Theyre tight with the people they interview When it comes down to it the yre all from the same world Theyre like one big family Some went into politics some into business some into journalism Thats the feeling you get They share the same lifestyle the same values the same friendships They stay at the same hotels they vacation in the same places It really is a family ll roar and claw to defend my husband This closeness is so real that it sometimes turns to passion Overt love affairs displayed and sold in glossy magazines Where else but in France the homeland of love Christine Ockrent went one step further In when her husband was Foreign Minister she was appointed deputy chief of foreign broadcasting by the French President himself France Monde Frances new world broadcasting service will oversee newborn channel France Frenchspeaking Monde and Radio France Internationale Alain de Pouzilhac will head the group seconded by Christine Ockrent Pouzilhac is a presidential appointee as is his deputy Christine Ockrent years after Peyrefitte the freedom of the press has made great strides The Minister no longer needs to hype his governments policy on His wife does it for him every day It seems antiquated or Soviet In my opinion Claire Chazal money and politics should be kept separate Neither should control the other especially if the money also owns big media companies This news program made history For the first time since it was privatized a party leader challenged s independence live on air Not because its journalists were in league with politicians but because Frances top channel was funded by big business Believe me the country is in trouble when very big financial and industrial interests are combined with very big media interests and also have very close links with the Government Attacked by a parliamentarian who voted to privatize in Claire Chazal fights back The channels star anchor wont let anyone slander her employer the Bouygues Group And shes not the only journalist to be employed by a conglomerate Heres an example this time from public Tonight theres a meeting of two big media stars One is a famous variety show host the other a former news anchor Michel Drucker past and future employee of the Lagardere Group plays host to JeanPierre Elkabbach past and present employee of the same Group And who is their guest Arnaud Lagardere their boss Arnaud thanks a million We rarely see you You keep a low profile You usually avoid the limelight Youre here for JeanPierre whom youve known since he advised your father But first a word about the Group Lagardere is one of the worlds biggest media and hitech conglomerates Our viewers have no idea how deeply it penetrates their daily lives Books magazines radio stations airplanes Careful the yll quote you Am far off Not far off but keep it quiet Above all the Group is a fantastic human adventure involving people all around the world Arnaud Lagardere is right to correct Michel Drucker The Group he heads is a fantastic human adventure not an allinvading monopoly To prove it we will show that its perfectly possible to spend a day without the Lagardere Group Lets take an average Frenchman Monsieur Lambert He wakes up to Europe Lagarderes flagship radio station But equally well he can listen to Radio Classique owned by Going to work he can buy a paper from one of Lagarderes outlets or pick up a free sheet published by the Bollor Group At the office his workmates can browse a Lagardere website or a Lagardere magazine but Lambert can read the Dassault Groups newspaper On his way home Lambert can buy one of Lagarderes magazines or one owned by the Group Back home Lambert can surf Lagarderes eight channels or watch the evening news on Bouyguesowned In my opinion money and politics should be kept separate day without Arnaud Lagardere comes at the price of consorting with a similar bunch of big business bosses all with big media holdings and all jockeying for government contracts Selling information gives them two things Political clout and money France is unusual in having large media corporations that live off government contracts Bricks and Bullets Bouygues and Lagardere This is clearly an unhealthy situation for the media but very profitable for the companies The political leverage it gives the m is deeply corrupting Martin Bouygues Frances th richest man The concentration and financialization of the media has a big impact Obviously economics cant explain everything but no explanation is complete without it We cant understand the impoverishment of information if we ignore the relentless drive to cut costs much more savagely than the printed press especially the national dailies which are happy to clear just enough profit to invest moderately and pay their workers wages The profithunters aim to make the media as profitable as any cuttingedge economic sector Claire Chazal am not criticizing Nicolas Sarkozy for his closeness to some very powerful business leaders He makes no secret of it He even flaunts it in the papers as you know Bayrou had good reason to begrudge the se tycoons friendship with his rival presidential candidate Sarkozy On May th no less than four of the se media magnates gathered at Fouquets restaurant to toast the new presidents victory The wellpublicized familiarity between our dear President Sarkozy and the media barons is troublesome It is plainly deeply corrupting But when we probe beyond the friendships the yacht parties and backslapping we see that the backslapping is based primarily on a shared set of values and political beliefs Because they agree on the society they want to construct and the economic interests they support the se friendships can be quite effective The interests of the people who really run this country reach far beyond the person of Sarkozy himself Sarkozy is there because today he seems to be the best guardian of their financial and ideological interests But if for any reason he becomes a liability tomorrow the yll back another horse without blinking They have plenty of runners to choose from On the right wing naturally but also on the left word about your neighbor JeanPierre your fathers former adviser Do you listen to him every morning Sometimes even see him You drop in Its a show in itself He drops in around and we have a chat we have a chat we have a chat The viewers of Druckers show believe every word When the boss of a conglomerate employing people drops in at the radio station he owns its to have a chat Certainly not to give orders Elkabbach and Drucker assert that for their employers the freedom of the press is sacred And not only freedom He has other qualities m not saying it to flatter you saw you metamorphose into a great European manager Its amazing Once or twice ve watched him negotiate Can say this Hes so focused and so still you wonder if hes there He bides his time All of a sudden he strikes He grabs the strategic initiative He can even surprise you by switching strategies Negotiators beware Dont tell Its a good thing came Its good that he drops in its a good thing he came It takes great journalistic skill to praise a boss so fulsomely He grabs the strategic initiative He can even surprise you by switching strategies Lie Sit Stand Journalists have two ways of not contesting the power that media owners exert on them They can simply deny it as Elkabbach and many others do or they can say its natural for this power to exert itself Back to our two famous editorial writers Whats their take on the subject Do you feel the Lagardere media are under orders in thrall to business interests and arms dealers No It varies for each magazine each part of the Lagardere empire Theres always a nebulous power Some people are so powerful that they dont need to speak but they do set guidelines obviously If you start up a newspaper you dont hand over control to a handpicked team of journalists It makes sense that the owner sets guidelines Have you ever been censored Has Robert Hersant ever phoned you before you went to press and say Scrap that article or Change that headline It happens on every newspaper It seems very natural to me think every owner has rights over his paper In a way hes the one with the power My power pardon the expression is one big joke Lets call it responsibility then Real power exists Its the enduring power of capital Thats real power Power naturally exerts itself So power naturally exerts itself But how in practice Back to the news Frances most watched news program The countrys in trouble Harsh words Can you give any practical examples Shes right Lets take a practical example Not just any example An important issue involving public safety and Frances future How to Handle Boozefests Should Boozefests be Banned Nothing quite so serious Lets take the safety of nuclear power plants On May th an wire story reported that serious faults had prompted the Nuclear Safety Authority to halt the pouring of concrete at the Flamanville reactor site Various media picked up the story during the day Work on the nuclear plant is on hold Faults have been found in the concrete reinforcing rods The wire story reported that the grading work and pouring of concrete were contracted to the Bouygues Group Lets see how owned by Martin Bouygues reported the event that evening Good evening Our top stories today President Sarkozy visits Rungis market to greet Frances early risers who want to make a decent living This evening s seven million viewers are told nothing about the nuclear site Lets try tomorrow Todays top stories Still nothing Lets watch Claire Chazal Good evening The headlines today The floods continue Not a word from Claire Chazal about her employers trouble In recent years the nuclear sector has been a key business area for the Bouygues Group Real power exists Its the enduring power of capital Thats real power Power naturally exerts itself Power naturally exerts itself Naturally therefore theres a place in Paris where the media stars dine once a month with the political and financial elite Le Siecle is a private club which picks its members from among the French elite Business leaders top civil servants journalists intellectuals politicians all follow the golden rule Never breathe a word outside about whats said in here Free from prying eyes and oversight the media stars learn the manners of power and hear whats on its mind Former government minister Crdit Agricole board member Editorial writer for Le Figaro etc and former minister Head of Calyon bank Speaker of the National Assembly Le Monde board member ViceChairman of Arte Former government minister Lurking documentary filmmaker All the se clubs are a motley crew of journalists pseudointellectuals semieconomists real economists top civil servants politicians and business leaders naturally The whole bunch are as thick as thieves VicePresident of the French Banks Association etc Government minister Adviser to the Mayor of Paris Chair of Supervisory Board Board member of Gucci Le Point Bouygues Air France etc Joining this kind of club and belonging to it involves how can put it Forfeiting freedom of speech and critical judgment in order to fit the norm adapt adjust and censor yourself Very soon you dont need to be told You know what you can and cant say the questions you can and cant ask Joining the Siecle means that you fit in with the French ruling class As a member you have to respect its interests at least and not interfere with its political and economic agenda Thanks boss Its such fun to work for you Were as happy as larks Thanks boss For what you do here on earth One day God will reward you The media dislike the business world Your audience the general public arent curious about business They have no taste for it Its also because businesspeople keep quiet Its a struggle to get the m to participate in debates on this program for example Were happy to have you Maybe youll persuade others to follow suit Youre right theres a fear For some prominent journalists frequenting business leaders fosters a love of business that is more than quietly platonic It jingles like gold As we all know we live in a globalized world of which well see a spectacular example tonight As you probably know Microsoft When journalists use their reputation to plug a product or a company for financial reward its called doubledipping Conflict of interest is an obvious risk and journalisms Code of Ethics sternly reproves doubledipping But pick up the phone and youll find plenty who do it Theres one for every purse Lets assume that Monsieur Lambert manages a company called Finance He phones up a specialized agency to hire a wellknown journalist to celebrate their sales figures d like to hire a journalist guest speaker Lets see what would happen Somebody highend Weve got a decent budget but want good value What sort of budget Were thinking about euros Thats a good budget We work with lots of journalists at lots of different prices Whom did you have in mind Ideally Patrick Poivre dArvor or Christine Ockrent She doesnt do it any more She got told off She did but she stopped She got caught you might say Guillaume Durand does it How much or And Poivre dArvor Hes more like But Pujadas Durand etc Theyre possible Not Pujadas Basically forget about news anchors Theyre too exposed Exposed to what Getting paid serious money to appear at a corporate function is something they keep quiet about Is it Its hypocritical All journalists do it or lets say half of them But their management disapproves if they use the celebrity the yve gained on the job to make money elsewhere dont suppose you have a list of journalists to choose from what list to choose from No It would be too long and besides Monsieur Lambert keeps trying Soon he has the list he wants He is deluged with the Vs of journalists willing to doubledip Full Vs including their fees and the names of satisfied companies From among the flood of candidates Lambert makes his choice Fortunately he can afford her But does a champion of consumer rights on France Inter radio know how to boost the corporate culture of his workforce The reply comes quickly Isabelle Giordano isnt hidebound Shes a true pro So pro in fact that she happily doubledips for a consumer credit company and invites its Chief Communications Officer to speak on her consumer protection show on public radio The Difference Is Independence The Difference Is Vigilance Paul Nizan The Watchdogs Bourgeois thought always says to the people Take my word for it Whatever tell you is true All the thinkers nourish have labored for you You cannot restudy all the problems they resolved or retrace the same paths but you can accept the findings of the se pure and selfless people the se men who bear the stamp of greatness and hold aloft from the common folk for whom they labor the keys to truth and justice Most television viewers would like the news to be presented not always by the same reader but by experts in the relevant field nternational economic social legal or parliamentary In future the news presenter will act as a kind of ringmaster standing back to make way either for pictures or for specialists on the topic hope and believe that all honest viewers that is almost all will agree that this new format involving less commentary and letting the pictures the facts and arguments speak for the mselves will be a step towards objectivity and depoliticization The information Ministers dream came true The specialist vouching for unbiased and depoliticized news is now a permanent guest in the studio radio newsroom and newspaper columns They call him the expert Economist sociologist political scientist or intellectual his academic credentials give his words the gloss of science But the clique of experts is small scarcely in all the media combined They zigzag from show to show relaying each other answering the questions that the host thinks we should ask With us tonight is an expert French economist Alain Minc you wrote a book What about Christian First its interesting Weve lost touch with the young and the overs Monsieur Lorenzi Its as clear as daylight JeanHerv Lorenzi m amazed we cant agree Nicolas Baverez d like to ask you first Nicolas Baverez historian and economist Jacques Attali President of Planete Finance Jacques Attali its We should see it as part of a worldwide trend Elie Cohen good morning Thank you for coming Youre a research director Research director and professor at Sciences Po Michel Godet economics lecturer Lets focus on one of them Averagely intelligent averagely well known like the others he is often asked his opinion on shows talk radio and in the columns of a major daily paper This ordinary experts name is Michel Godet Without noticing it France has practically grown up with him In a changing world the rules must change too We cant afford our old industrial relations our collective agreements our little habits In future we may have to agree to take Wednesdays off but work on Saturdays We cant face the future with agreements signed in or even for railway workers In a changing world the rules must change How many hours do how many people work in a lifetime How much work gets done If France goes on having so few people in work doing so little and retiring so young it doesnt add up In countries where theres less unemployment more people work and for longer Rowing less hard wont get you there faster We must work earlier work later work parttime and be more flexible Our onesizefitsall system must change We have too few workers especially young and old and they dont work enough Work creates jobs Over the years his exhortations to the French to work more have enabled our expert at least to earn more Thanks to his fame in the media he can charge high fees for lecturing to companies and institutions As introductions go that was fairly complimentary but unnerving If he gives a lecture a month thats euros per year Plus his salary as teacher at the National Engineering School lets say plus his fees as director of a multinational company Bongrain around Michel Godet earns about euros per year Bravo Michel euros About ten times the minimum legal wage You can get a of my lecture wage which Michel Godet thinks is too high Michel Godet you think we should dare to lower the minimum legal wage Logically yes If we cant touch the labor unions privileges then we cant adjust the minimum wage although in an increasingly global market it kills jobs because the worldwide cost of unskilled labor keeps falling Michel Godet is typical of the odd experts who dominate the media Like him nearly all of the m are board members of big companies they work with banks and advise investment companies But the se activities are never mentioned When the media invite them it is always due to their academic credentials Why do the mass media keep so quiet about the collusions which call dangerous liaisons between their regular guest economists and the business world The general public radio listeners and watchers would regard a brilliant academic economist very differently if they knew that this economist is paid handsomely by banks insurance firms and private companies to sit on their boards at the heart of decisionmaking Elie Cohen thank you for coming Youre a research director and economics professor dont see how anyone can claim to be intellectually independent while being deeply embedded in the world of business Nowadays we consider that if an expert is a member of the Food Safety Agency and also on the board of a big agribusiness company theres conflict of interest think everyone agrees on that Why doesnt the same criticism apply to economists who are paid by banks insurance companies and big businesses to increase their profits and interests Isnt that a conflict of interest Professor JeanHerv Lorenzi These people say Were intellectually independent but we cant believe them It may be hard to believe that the se experts are unbiased but its easy to guess where they dine once a month Freelance economist Freelance economists Freelance economist Very tangibly their job is to promote including in the mainstream media which they virtually monopolize the prevailing economic dogma that is capitalism For the past thirty years a debate has raged between worshippers of market forces and worshippers of market forces m delighted to see the revival of the idea of enterprise profit and the market m thrilled to hear Alain Minc say it Thats good is it And new The market has always existed but we couldnt boast about it We couldnt boast and now we can If you want a longer more comfortable life which most people on this planet want history shows that capitalism works What is a financial market As say in my book its rather like a farmers market Some people bring melons others bring chickens and they trade melons for chickens Christian de Boissieu thank you for coming Speaking of Christmas shopping what about financial products If theres a glut of chickens and too few melons the melon grower wins out Are the Socialists reformists Yes at long last The wording isnt fixed but its there in writing The Socialist Party is in the market in globalization To regulate and improve it of course Not endure it But its in there between social democracy and social liberalism For the past years the market and democracy have advanced hand in hand They are not only compatible but mutually beneficial Your newspaper Le Monde hasnt changed much in years Are we witnessing a revolution In the mids the champions of an unfettered market were happy to welcome a strong new ally the daily newspaper Le Monde Headed by a triumvirate of JeanMarie Colombani Edwy Plenel and Alain Minc the famously independent French newspaper of record opened its columns to experts and journalists preaching the gospel of neoliberal economics When Le Monde joins the free market chorus it affects the whole media scene If Le Monde which is often called the newspaper of record defends the same ideas that Libration has defended since the s under Joffrin and which the leftist fringe of Le Figaro also defends we obviously get a standardization of economic opinion Its liberalize or die Le Monde is still the paper of record Its regarded as such even though its editorial line has changed considerably So when those ideas are spread proclaimed and upheld with almost militant fervor by the newspaper of record the yre legitimized In a second section of the paper we aim to repair another of our weaknesses this time in the field of business news As you know the strategies of large industrial and banking groups nowadays are at least as influential as public spending We want to keep up in that area so business financial and market news will have a central place in the paper They want to convert society to a new way of living together a new form of economic and social life But basically society refuses it For very good reasons It has everything to lose Its plain and simple As the foreseeable resistance took shape persuasion and conviction had to be deployed in equal measure It was time to start teaching We havent been good enough teachers We need to explain As the media started teaching some journalists discovered a priestly vocation for educating the masses Perhaps this country needs to be taught Workers employers politicians and the media too at our own humble level must all do a better job of explaining the complex choices In newsspeak Explaining the complex choices is a fancy way of explaining the need for reform The word reform is now on everyones lips Good evening Why cant we reform in France when everyone else is doing it That is our topic tonight Can France reform itself Can it afford not to in this globalized era How can the French be convinced of the need for reform Do you accept the need for reform Why is it so hard for France to make reforms Why doesnt it work here in France People are starting to realize that growth cant resume until we give up some historic privileges In the recent past weve fallen behind with reforms Thats what worries me today We cant introduce a mass of painful but necessary reforms Were at the end of a cycle The end of a system People are scared and dont want change Have the French become ultraconservative overnight They say no They fear change Its not just the fear of losing entitlements losing what one has its the fear of any change at all Why does public debate always revolve around concepts such as reform outdated methods the fall of France decline the French model etc ve noticed theres a small vocabulary of about or words without which all the se journalists and experts couldnt make a single sentence Its true Without the word reform the yre speechless They cant put three words together In order to persuade you need methods of persuasion The media have their champions tirelessly working the cameras and mikes In the past six years Frdric Lordon and Jean Gadrey have been guests on radio and shows times During the same period Jacques Attali Lorenzi and Michel Godet have made Hello and welcome to the and politics show with Eric Zemmour and Claude Imbert Even though the journalists and experts agree on the basics we still have to go through the motions of debate The phone lines are open the contest can begin The media regularly stage fierce duels between bitterly opposed debaters In this talk show on leftwing intellectual Jacques Julliard locks horns each week with rightwing philosopher Luc Ferry Be warned their words are shockingly violent m sorry Luc cant disagree with you there wish could d go the other way Youll agree with me here as agreed with you there Like you m glad that public opinion is so strong agree with Jacques Luc is absolutely right We need to explain about globalization Youre stealing my words have to agree about austerity Youre right On that point Luc and wont argue very fiercely agree with Jacques The constitutional treaty should have come first before enlargement Give me credit for thinking like you do m not a government minister but its still my opinion rather agree with Jacques except on one point which you kindly left open wouldnt equate liberalism with communism On that point quite agree with you What we also need as m sure Jacques agrees is something even tougher People say we disagree too much They worry about our relationship In fact its excellent This week we entirely agree and were not ashamed of it Some articles of faith are never questioned Europe in its present shape the general trend towards market deregulation also known as globalization and the general scaling back and in France especially the quiet dismantling of the welfare state Thats the boundary line Some people debate within the box Others try to change it The opponents who want to change it are simply locked out Those who are happy to paddle around in the sandbox are allowed in But the resulting political debate is terribly stunted For convincing the public a favorite rhetorical device is the foreign example Out there abroad in nearby or distant countries we see brave choices the example to follow Among the foreign countries that wisely and bravely bit the bullet of reform the country most cited by French journalists and experts was Great Britain Its freemarket swing begun by Margaret Thatcher was fervently admired political talk show on June th on French public television summed up the arguments in favor of the British model Journalist Thierry Thuillier future Head of News at France preaches the free market with evangelical zeal But can we be sure that the free market model would be bad for France Objectively we cant help noticing that it has won Tony Blair a third term in office and the British economy is thriving In France the Polish plumber is a bogeyman In England hes a welcome guest We report on the British model of integration To see for ourselves how the economy is thriving we went to London to meet an expert who is never invited by French journalists Sir Michael Marmot chaired the World Health Organizations on social determinants and life expectancy Professor of Epidemiology and expert Seeing it works should we copy the English Stay with us Four years later the recession showed how well the economy was working State to the rescue The Big Slide Free Fall On the morning of Sept th the media woke up aghast to a huge financial crisis which threw over million people into deep poverty all over the world Too busy hailing the rosy dawn of liberalism the experts were caught napping One of their bestknown and influential faces and equally caught napping was Alain Minc While Michel Godet has been playing Joe Expert for years Alain Minc has been batting in a different league Alain Minc on page you call yourself a leftwing liberal What does that mean Good question Alain Minc is one of the brightest This berexpert advises business leaders ministers and heads of state In the media he is onstage and also backstage Onstage he appears on book programs and political talk shows Backstage he chairs the supervisory board of Le Monde and is the brains behind many media group managers In his friend Vincent Bollor friend of his friend Nicolas Sarkozy gave him a show on his newly created channel Good evening and Happy New Year January th Minc invited the inevitable Christian de Boissieu They discussed the American sub primes crisis that led months later as we know to the financial market meltdown in September d like to qualify your comments m with you but ll use my of intellectual freedom to point out the amazing flexibility of the system It goes to show that the financial system is so finely regulated that it averted a crisis which could have been as bad as the big financial crises weve seen in the past Deep down its a very resilient system Its not regulated by any visible body but its very well regulated all the same The interplay between central banks and governments In reality empiricism prevails over ideological stances and the world economy is pretty well run Thats vintage Minc Hes in top form Everything points to the recession of the century all the signs are there but the system is resilient it will take it in its stride well glide on through and growth will resume Theres a body of intellectual speculation that always makes the same enormous mistakes It ought to be punished Not financially but there should come a point when the democratic system bans those people from the positions they hold as top experts high priests and speakers of truth Theyre anything but This crisis is a prime example It took by surprise as that clip shows very well all those people whod been saying for years that deregulation was the best system Its a vivid demonstration of a colossal mistake Six months later on June th Alain Minc displayed the same optimism He invited another famous expert Daniel Cohen editorial writer for Le Monde and adviser to Lazard bank June th was three months before the September crash probably shouldnt call him the best economist in France after Giscard dEstaing gave that title to Raymond Barre d be going too far but d be glad to hear his diagnosis of this peculiar economic moment agree with you that the financial crisis is not entirely finished but the worst is over That is the risk The risk that the financial crisis would spark a systemic crisis with banks going down like dominoes seems to be averted Here again the situation makes us ask if Frances best economist in the eyes of Alain Minc can be so far wrong in June is the whole profession doomed Did nobody see it coming No In all fairness it has to be said that some people including some economists had seen it coming for years Thereal question is why are the people who get interviewed always the ones least critical of the basis of the system Daniel Cohen didnt see it coming Theres a persistence in error that is met with persistent leniency They can say whatever they like Those guys are rustproof You wonder what the yd have to come out with to make the media finally say Youre a good old boy but lets face it we cant ask you here again Of course the opposite happened The same experts glossed the collapse of a system the yd previously praised They spoke even more than before From September to December Alain Minc Christian de Boissieu and Daniel Cohen between the m spoke times on the radio and Frdric Lordon and Jean Gadrey were invited only times Clearly because the unions are behind the times were the only big country which refuses to tackle the issue of workers privileges Until we grasp the basic problem that the French cannot accept the fact that society needs deep reform the question will always remain French rigidity stops us developing towards the gradual expansion of the market and democracy So France is in a strange position where some people bring melons and others bring chickens and they trade melons for chickens When bourgeois ideas came to be seen as products of timeless reason and no longer as shaky historical constructs they had the best chance of surviving and resisting attack Everyone forgot the circumstances that engendered the m and also made them mortal When the Government wishes to defend its point of view it will do it openly through a qualified spokesman How will this spokesman express himself In a televised speech a statement or what He might make a statement but whenever possible we will hold an open debate between the various points of view in order to respect the freedom of information and opinion of all French people We may smile to see Alain Peyrefitte defending pluralism of opinion while imposing his Governments changes on the news Fifty years on journalists still hark back to that era when they praise the socalled pluralism of todays media We had the De Gaulle era the Ministry of Information era We still have a Minister of Culture and Communication but hes not so important now No thank goodness Nowadays they have to contend with competition Back then we had only two channels Now there are dozens We had three important radio stations Now there are hundreds Now theres the Internet Nothing can be hushed up for long Theres always competition and therefore logically necessarily theres more real independence than back then Not because politicians are more virtuous or journalists are smarter but competition has forced it on them thank God Now the news cant do without it For Alain Duhamel and most other journalists competition is the ideal model that safeguards their independence But its no wonder that Alain Duhamel sees only good in the news market He is one of those who have reaped the richest rewards from the growth of the news media Every news show appear on He started out in public broadcasting in the days of Alain Peyrefitte While pursuing a rustproof career as a presidential interviewer he embodied his own variety of media pluralism In the early s he sold his editorials to ten media outlets at a time France Canal Libration Le Point Nice Matin Les Le Maine Libre Le Courrier de Ouest Presse Ocan Hes unlikely to bite the hand of a market thats fed him so well For Renaud Lambert please What do you do studied journalism Youve always been an example We watched and listened to you a lot and discussed you in class m very pleased to meet you Why did you ask him to sign your book m studying journalism Alain Duhamel is one of my heroes His trademark style is asking questions that let people get on with the job Like when Nicolas Sarkozy met the press Its a school in itself Your first questioner is Alain Duhamel Unfortunately the market has no feelings and Alain Duhamel has reached his sellby date If may Will you cap public borrowing With competition the media have to keep trading new faces for old Ageing stars are usually replaced by equivalent models who talk the same talk But to win other audiences and gain market share the media sometimes bank on more impetuous outspoken characters Even rebels if need be Michel Field is one such journalist chosen for his rebellious image His career is the banal story of the rebel who fell into line As militant revolutionaries we believe well change society The people were fighting will make us use force We dont rule out armed struggle Michel Field sells his militant image on public television We see him late at night discussing philosopher Flix Guattari with former Red Brigades member Toni Negri Ten years later his talk show guests have changed He picks up the phone live on air and calls in the police Theres a growing demand from our fellow citizens for a basic right to law and order Over time Michel Field has skillfully adopted the habits of his fellow stars Casino is a great group Its yours We cant wait to see the se new products on the shelves Michel heres a standard checkout sign recognize it And heres our new one Next Smile Five years on Michel Field hosts a party rally urging Yes to the European Constitution Please welcome Arnaud Lagardere He brings on Arnaud Lagardere the owner of the radio station for which he works Michel Field welcomes you to the Discovery Caf on Europe We find him in the early afternoon swapping childhood dreams with Claire Chazal What started your love of dance Since was young Youve guessed where Michel Field has dinner once a month Pseudorebel Naturally Michel Field is not the only pseudorebel on the airwaves The market churns them out Revolutionaries of the world disunite With no leader or star you cant be caught Get your kicks demolishing power One of the most successful is Philippe Val His image as a protest singer earned him the top job at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo The press is sad Its sad because its full of lukewarm cautious boring stuff Theres not much humor in the press We see him late at night with Michel Field boasting about making fun of You stitched them up They got it in the ass Twenty years later Media news Val is named head of France Inter radio by the director of Radio France himself directly appointed by President Sarkozy He quickly fired two humorists who were deemed too cocky by the powers that be You can mix genres but you have to be careful Give me one example of a journalist who started out as you might say a rebel a nonconformist who wasnt either quietly dropped or bought Theres no alternative The system spits out everything it cant digest You cant sit in the presenters chair without paying for it somehow All the top channels for all the family Seven sports channels by satellite The news market instead of providing pluralism manufactures a handful of celebrity journalists that the media compete to grab to boost their market share For the se roving journalists hopping between public and private outlets to suit their careers there are two rules Push the brand but never disparage a potential future employer The Difference Is Independence Why did you move from France Inter to Europe after saying dont accept offers from privatelyowned stations get up at am because like it and believe in public broadcasting Dont you know Europe is owned by Lagardere friend at Radio France once said to me Your family is the radio first and foremost Didnt you know it two years ago Of course did But youve followed the same path MarcOlivier Fogiel career is made of accelerations some splits and continuity Weve heard you speak out for public broadcasting too But didnt say like you did that it fascinated me didnt say its the only place want to work There are certainly big differences between public and private broadcasters but the gap is shrinking One symptom of the situation is the way the celebrities of private and radio networks casually transfer the mselves to the public networks and viceversa When the leading players care so little about the role of public broadcasting it signifies a big step backwards Speaking of players and transfers winter was a transfer window that would have envied Jacques Julliard kicked off Disappointed by Denis Olivennes he left Le Nouvel Observateur to join Marianne Laurent Joffrin quit Libration to replace Olivennes who took over the captaincy of Europe from Alexandre Bompard who became of La Fnac the job vacated by Denis Olivennes a few months earlier Early in the New Year Nicolas Poincar left France Info for Europe replacing Nicolas Demorand who took the helm of Libration while Arlette Chabot left France to become editorinchief at Europe At the same time Erik Izraelewicz after stints at Les Echos and La Tribune returned to Le Monde to replace Eric Fottorino as director That is what pluralism of information is made of game of musical chairs by a few interchangeable journalists who feel at home everywhere At first we had only two channels Now there are dozens We had three important radio stations Now there are hundreds Now theres the Internet Nothing can be hushed up for long As Duhamel keeps saying the multiplication of media outlets ensures pluralism of information But when competition is king news is a product that has to be sold One kind of information is easy to make very costeffective and sold everywhere Delinquency and violence are rarely out of the news nowadays worrying rise in violence in nursery and elementary schools Baby thugs the rarely reported issue of violent to yearolds The police call the rise alarming As we all know delinquency has risen this year rise in casual crimes with violence But this trend has not dispelled the sense of insecurity In Cherbourg for example the shopkeepers are sick of robberies and vandalism Dont panic but the holiday period is fraught with danger First this horrific murder ghastly tragedy in Marseilles The women were savagely murdered For planning to kidnap rape and torture a young girl Missing Kidnapped Alive or dead Casual crime is a key issue five months before the elections Over the years crime stories have come to hog the headlines of newspapers radio and This was confirmed by a report published in June by the National Audiovisual institutes statistics office In the past ten years on the six terrestrial networks coverage of murders and other forms of violence has increased fourfold The sickening case of pedophilia in Boulogne where several siblings were rented out for sex They look like ordinary people Taxi driver bakers wife clergyman Seventeen adults have been charged with raping up to twenty children for years and perhaps even prostituting them The Outreau pedophilia trial was easily the most reported case in the past ten years During the eightweek trial the four main national dailies Le Monde Le Figaro Libration and Le Parisien led with the crime story times and devoted articles to it Over the same period they printed just three articles on a report by the establishing that bad air and water kill over three million children under five each year Court hearing in camera Dominique Weil was one of defendants who were acquitted Hes a worker priest who lived for years in the housing complex that featured so largely in the news This was in Le Parisien The Outreau drama is set against a backdrop of social deprivation in an area where alcoholism incestuous behavior and pedophilia are almost part of the culture In Le Monde There are five or six similar cases in Boulogne Its like a gangrenous infection in the housing complexes You toss back a kid like you toss back a beer Is Outreaus drab housing complex under a curse More probably like many similar complexes in northwest France and elsewhere its the victim of an explosive blend of unemployment alcohol idleness and squalor Incest is never far away That was in Le Figaro No comment It reveals a general state of mind They distort the reality of that housing complex and the people living there and portray it as a ghetto full of the scum of the earth Its classic classic case When they write about La Courneuve or VauxenVelin thats the way journalists describe whole neighborhoods When they say the suburbs thats what people think The criminal class think were seeing a revival of this kind of language Even if its never said its implied In speeches articles conversations Its never said clearly but its implied The sensitive Madeleine district is still controlled by rioters Ariane a sensitive district in Nice is deserted At pm yesterday in the sensitive district of Orgemont The Police Intelligence Service sets the number of sensitive districts much higher The areas where the poorest classes live have become a well of crime stories Day after day year after year the media have ignored the social and economic facts and focused entirely on stories about drugs delinquency immigration and violence Soon this block will be torn down Meanwhile its the biggest cannabis market in France This housing complex in the south of Paris has been the scene of daily violence for months Burned cars muggings supermarket robberies In a housing complex rife with poverty unemployment lawlessness and inwardlooking communities the social and moral rules are set by the majority religion in this town which is Islam ClichysousBois is ablaze again When revolts break out in the se poor areas as in October and November the media send in a barrage of cameras mikes and reporters to film the burning cars and flashball volleys The media have pondered the causes of such violence Organized criminal gangs or idle uneducated youths accustomed to poverty and gratuitous violence The causes suggested by the journalists rarely contradict the image that they carefully construct of disoriented youth and sectarian communities breaking the law The call for law and order is never far behind Samir Mihi can you say right now to the young people of Clichy Stop the burning We say it every day Can we hear you say it Can you tell them Go home tonight and well get things done later The ones in the street arent watching so whats the point Joking aside m not joking What youre asking me is People in Clichy will see cars burning and have horrible experiences Youre implying we didnt We already said it Are you afraid to call for a state of calm m calm You are You know what m saying You seem unable to say clearly to the kids who are probably on the streets as we speak Go home Dont burn the town down You agree it makes sense when young people are on the streets and its dangerous to say Go home Editorial chieftains think and behave like elites They think and behave like elites who are above the people and have the job of educating them Educating the people means teaching them to keep quiet teaching the status quo ignoring the violence of social injustice but condemning such violent acts of revolt as breaking a shop window These editorial chieftains are the more or less efficient more or less convincing but always visible guardians of the existing social order Tonight will you repeat your call for calm in all the troubled neighborhoods Can we allow that the illegitimate exploitation and scorn heaped on the se people may be matched by a legitimate violence the necessary violence of revolt Thats the crux of it The symbolic violence is considered legal and the physical group violence is considered illegal The dividing line between them is drawn by class interests to coin an old phrase Xavier Mathieu youre a shop steward at the Continental factory Youre understandably upset but arent you going too far Do you regret this violence You must be joking Does the end justify the means The end is only days away We hear your anger but are you calling for calm tonight No way m not calling for calm The people are angry and anger has to come out Theres a marching slogan that says Sow the seeds of misery and reap the grapes of wrath On April st the France news anchor hit a snag The union rep at the Continental plant in Clairoix refused to echo his call for calm That year the recession forced hundreds of laidoff workers to set aside the usual means of protest The media quickly raised the alarm of a workers revolt and decreed its limits Its an upward spiral Waving placards in front of the National Assembly will get you a minute of news Locking up the manager gets you two minutes Threaten to blow up a building and youll be a media celebrity Were fed up Youre angry Yes and getting angrier What can be done to prevent it Is it legitimate or is it outrageous for workers about to be laid off to lock their bosses or managers in their offices even nonviolently and for only a short time Its obviously unacceptable Bossnapping as the English call it holding a manager hostage is intolerable Locking people into their offices cant be allowed Think how scared they must feel and their families Its criminal Next time well have to hit hard Harder and harder To most if not all journalists the working class is like an Indian reservation They dont know them the yre not from there they dont know their customs and concerns their living conditions their culture or their traditions As soon as the workers step out of their role as part of the scenery as picturesque folk easily labeled with ideological clichs as soon as they stop being Indians on their reservation they become dangerous because they break with the soft consensus of soft democracy They break the rules They burn tires occupy factories and lock up their bosses Theyre beyond the pale Then the ideological apparatus bares its fangs and bites viciously and class mockery can escalate to ostracism or class hatred Has legitimate protest given way to mob rule as you call it echoing Sartre Yes Today its the bosses tomorrow it will be a lawyer who pleads an unpopular case and the day after that a teacher whos too fond of La Princesse de Cleves or Le Rouge et le Noir One day it will be you for airing an unpopular opinion think that today some minority fringe groups pose a real threat of violence and mob rule We cant allow it However poor and painful a workers life may be however bad it is to be unemployed there are so many ways to be heard so many ways to fight and protest without resorting to mob rule and attacking people even if the yre bosses BernardHenri Levy thank you The bourgeois plays at treating the people like his own children He reproves advises and assists them for they are obviously incapable of controlling their own fate He punishes the people as he would his own children for their own good He says Spare the rod and spoil the child When they revolt he calls them ingrates We believe it is right for a democracy like ours to lay down certain rules and reaffirm certain principles to which all democrats should unhesitatingly adhere Reaffirm the need for pluralism in the media Back in November Pierre Mauroy put before the National Assembly a Freedom of the Press bill President Mitterrand had pledged that a leftwing government would enact the autonomy and pluralism of the media transparently administered Restrict concentration and secure the means to enforce the se provisions The stated enemies at the time were concentration and the power of money The power of the press does not frighten us but we will not tolerate the power of money On May th JeanPierre Elkabbach the Lagardere Groups key journalist was decorated by exPresident Chirac The admiring guests included the cream of the media financial leaders and top politicians from right and left In the meantime the left in power had spent thirty years giving up Thirty years of failing to legislate for an independent press Thirty years of increased concentration Thirty years of allowing industrial and financial conglomerates to take over the printed press radio and networks Thirty years of not trying to provide a good free public news service Thirty years of not treating the media as a crucial political issue So Must we wait thirty more years for the democratization of the media that is a prerequisite for economic and social change Must we let the watchdogs think and act for us for more years The gap between their ideas and the grim world widens each week each day yet nothing alerts the m and they alert no one The gap between their promises and real life is more outrageous than ever Yet they do not move They stay behind the barricade They hold the same meetings and publish the same books All those who foolishly waited on their words are starting to revolt or laugh Paul Nizan The Watchdogs
