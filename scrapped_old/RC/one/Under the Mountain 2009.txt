Cover for us okay Hold on to me as tight as you can And whatever you do do not let go am in charge No one is going anywhere How did you do that How did you do that Inside Inside Now listen And listen very carefully was not always what you see Youre right Theo am the fireraiser And am not of this world Just as they are not of this world They can take human form but human they are not What are they The ones you call the Wilberforces were a predatory species Merciless cunning greedy Their hunger for power was great All they lacked was the strength to conquer until they met the gargantua Gargantua The gargantua are immense beings with the power to lay waste to entire worlds The Wilberforces tamed them and together they were unstoppable They learned to travel through space To make whole worlds their own And they did it again and again To your world Yes It was a catastrophe But a few of us escaped and we gathered our strength and we followed them here And we imprisoned them under millions of tons of rock The volcanoes The volcanoes The largest gargantua the mother under Rangitoto Island Her children under North Head Mount Victoria One Tree Hill Mount Wellington Lake Pupuke and Mount Eden Seven Wilberforces Seven gargantua Seven volcanoes But now the Wilberforces have freed themselves And the gargantua will follow Together they will make the Earth a festering wasteland where only they can survive When Soon Then Lets call the Army The New Zealand Army No The Wilberforces can only be defeated with these Rocks These are weapons of a strength you can only begin to imagine When we realised that the Wilberforces were waking up we knew we had to destroy them We captured the last of our fire within these stones And my twin and were chosen to wield them Your twin All of my people were twins We shared everything The journey here was hard on us both and my twin did not survive My only hope was to find other twins who could use the stones They must be thrown together into the crater of Rangitoto The fire will be unleashed the Wilberforces will perish and the seven gargantua will be destroyed This alone can save your world But only twinness can ignite the power Twinness Yes You know what m talking about Not all twins have it but think you do But your twinness must be strong for you to have any chance of defeating the Wilberforces So Theo one of these is for you This one And this one is for you Pick it up Theo Its heavy Warm Open to your mind to the stone Feel its power And let it feel yours saw other twins Yes They tried to use the stones Many years ago What happened to them They failed Now try yours She looked really upset He just dragged them inside And you you saw them arrive Yes Theo if you believed in your twinness Rachel would be able to hold her stone She needs you And you need her Do you understand You need to fix this What are you so afraid of Theo Rach m sorry m sorry left you this morning thought was going to die wont ever let that happen Rach can take care of you can be strong enough for both of us Is that what you think want Its them Its alright It seems these officers want a word with us at the station think we should do as they say Theo yours believe Alright son Youre not in trouble We just want a word All were concerned about is that we dont know who this man is Or what he wanted from you He gave us these stones Theyre weapons Ah please sit down Theo Whats going on We leave you for one day you destroy the house The front door is ruined What are we going to do with you Were going to the beach house What There wont be any trouble there for you to get into We have to stay Uncle Cliff please We realise youve been through a lot the last few months but we cant watch you every second of the day Especially if youre going to run off with complete strangers He wasnt a stranger Dad saw it Rachel wasnt going to And you are coming too Bit of time without cell phone coverage might be good for you You know what Sometimes you have no idea Get an early night Well be off first thing As soon as theyre asleep m going to find Mr Jones What if Mr Wilberforce comes Then ll deal to him No passport Drivers License or date of birth Not even a Christian name Frankly Mr Jones were puzzled as to just who you are When did you first make contact with Rachel and Theo Matheson They found me But you didnt discourage them Two impressionable teenagers vulnerable open to suggestion They were a means to an end Just like the others Others They were frail weak You all are We all who All you humans see Without me theyll be dead

free was wrong Johan Johan Mr Jones Help us Please help us Mr Jones Please You just left them there had no choice They had Johan Lenart alone was useless to me If d risked myself to save them who wouldve been left to find more twins You dont need twins can make enough fire for both of us Rachel believes in your twinness It is her belief that gives you power But at the beach they were afraid of me You were weak No They were afraid Only because she believes Youre wrong old man ll prove it Theo Come back We have to throw the stones together need you need you Theo need your help Theres no one
