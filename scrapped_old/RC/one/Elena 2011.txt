December would give everything to wake up not here and now but there and then No matter how you look at it appendicitis is still better than a heart attack That was hardly appendicitis More like peritonitis born nurse Of course it was better If only because you were looking after me Though the girls here arent bad Go on keep talking ll cut off your oxygen well see what happens then Youd do it

heart attack got that part Hes very weak Hes conscious though Yes conscious thank God Hes probably felt his way through all the nurses already Katya Yes Elena want to ask you to go easy on him Right now he needs rest He needs your love Show him that you love him You see each other so rarely which dont understand at all but thats your business Indeed it is Katya you never call him You should Maybe

Sure to death do you part dont doubt it Like a true nurse youre trying to cure me but m fine dont need your treatment am what am Are you not at all sorry for your father understand thats a rhetorical question but as far as youre concerned dont give a flying fuck Oh my Lord What room is he in Maybe its not such a good idea for you to see him today Another time When hes better Well thats interesting Why call me yesterday and not when hes better Your father asked me to What room is Dad in Excuse me Hello Could you tell me Please cover your head in the house of the Lord wanted to ask which saint should light a candle to For health or for one who has passed on My husbands in hospital prayer for health then Write his name on a slip of paper and the priest will pray for his health during service And place a candle in front of Saint Nicholas and Mother of God And while youre lighting it ask the Lord to bring him health and assistance Could you tell me where those icons are Straight ahead and to the right of the altar Thank you barely see you Katya You can barely see me cos m standing against the sun didnt mean it in that sense Dad you know that nothing like sense even exists Looking at you sometimes think that might even be true So its that you barely see me was never your reason to live And thank God as they say Youre wrong about that Money Dad has always been your only reason for living What are you tallying up my life Moneys important to you too Not that important Maybe thats because youve never earned any yourself Maybe thats because you spoiled me gave me everything on a plate Sounds like a complaint Come on Dad you know adore you Keep it coming please dont know why do this You dont know what youre paying for What ve been paying through the nose for Well just dont start sniffling on me Youve always loved those word games Games help children come to terms with the cruel laws of reality Children Nope Not going to happen m not pregnant if thats what you were asking Too bad Itd sort you out m sorted Alcohol and drugs only on the weekends Its clean living now Of all the pleasures m still getting sex and food under control but m working on myself trust me What are you going to smoke in here Why not Its a hospital Katya So what You paid for the big suite you can do whatever you like Are you serious Fine ll go smoke where m allowed to Hold on What now Where does all this come from Where do you think Genes Dad heritage Rotten seed Were all bad seeds Subhuman Go on and have some babies Maybe theyll turn out different Different from everyone else Theres no such thing as different And dont feel like experimenting in that area Its painful and expensive and pointless What is it with you and pointless Dumb excuses Youre just trying to avoid being responsible Dad its irresponsible to produce offsprings that you know are going to be sick and doomed since the parents are just as sick and doomed And only because cosi fan tutte because there is some apparently higher meaning to it all which is not ours to comprehend After all we are merely the executors of this higher purpose Shits gotta be tasty millions of flies cant be wrong And anyway the world will end soon enough in case you havent heard You know its strange but listening to you feel a lot better See thats exactly why you breed To suck the life from your children And then youre surprised Where does all this come from Katya youre such a twit sometimes Thanks love you very much Can we do without that What one wont do for money See Now at last youre starting to see the point Just dont loose sight of it yourself Parasite Oh thought it was a heart attack Get over here let me give you a kiss Dialling mama Go on give her a ring Lets see whats going on in the kitchen Have a look outside and see whats there See if there are any sparrows about Needs to boil some more Right Where are those sparrows at Bless you Above all observe the medication schedule closely Next diet is critical And take it easy nothing stressful Plus would recommend hiring a qualified caretaker worked in a hospital looking after patients for years So the better See you around doctor You too Take care of yourself All the best So long think were seeing our refs m not talking about todays refs but all this talk about referees mistakes its making them hedge their bets If we filed the tapes of this show and watched them in years time The country would be shocked at the way its all repeating Youll pay for what you have done You wont get away with it either But wish you our audience all the best Goodbye Elena have something need to tell you Your pills In short ve decided to write a will Volodya m sorry but this makes me really uncomfortable Elena this is important need to be straight with you Its the right thing to do and after all everyones thinking about whatll happen after m gone right No its not like that All the same its a talk we need to have Fair enough Except for you and my daughter dont have anyone else in this world After die my daughter will inherit almost everything And you as my spouse will receive a lifeannuity monthly payments And m confident they will be more than enough Thats it really built up to this for so long and fired it all out in seconds Is there something you want to say Yes there is Its not about what you were saying but it seems like the right time What is it The thing What thing The thing with Sasha think that his father your son should be taking care of his own son Volodya What were they thinking when they had him It was an accident Both times Dont make me laugh Its no laughing matter It just happened like it does with everybody First one kid by accident then another And now m supposed to feed them Elena its not the money that bothers me Of course not Youre giving all of it to your thoughtless daughter Here we go again First of all not all of it And second of all you dont know her Shes actually quite sensible Thoughtless and derailed dont want to hear it And apparently infertile too Nonsense Shes just different Shes not like you and me Of course shes nothing like my son and his children You said it Dear God what gives you the right What What right do you have to think youre special Why Just because you have more money More things All that can change What exactly can change and the last shall be the first Ah heard that one Biblical fairytales for poor foolish people Equality and fraternity are only to be found in your Heavenly Kingdom Elena Well you probably have a lot to do Yes quite a lot Do you want anything only want for you to have understood me did Elena lets deal with this like adults We are adults Well get through it And m glad you understand Can you please bring me a pen and paper The lawyer is coming tomorrow and want to sketch out a draft of the will Sergei hi Fine thanks Better but still weak Listen talked to him about Sasha m afraid well have to deal with this on our own Yes thats it He says its yourjob as a father to deal with the problem Stop it Stop would you m upset myself But think theres some truth to what he says Well figure it out ourselves Well think of something ll call later Shit The Tightass Tanya wheres my beer Did you get the babys formula There was a damn bottle in here Did you finish your homework Yeah Did you do you homework did it already What a mess in here cant concentrate it all just comes out wrong Medicine first Hes through He shoots Many of you are probably wondering if everything here is strictly aboveboard Elena ve had enough Thanks Do you want to take a nap Think will cant believe it You really werent warned no one told you to abstain Drugs like this are strictly prohibited after a heart attack m telling you didnt even know that he had it Like little kids swear Dumb teenagers have more sense You could be a bit more tactful How much more tactful Dear friends relatives and colleagues of the deceased its time to say farewell Final farewells Sausage number is the best though its too salty for me think the one closest to milk sausage is number Its got some sausage taste unlike number Well tastes differ vote for number Please Our jurors here are regular shoppers They can only vote for one sausage All of the labels have been covered up voted for the sixth it was pretty edible mean you dont even notice the breadrusk theres no starch and theres no taste of cardboard So its an Ksausage This ones too moist too watery Cook it a little more Its a sign that it wasnt made right Sausage just shouldnt be like that The contest will continue in the laboratory where the winner will be chosen liked number m not sure m not sure about number or what they made it from but d never buy a sausage that looked like that Number five is a waste dont spend your money on plastic like that Hello Yes Thank you ll be right down Hello Good afternoon Well he sensed his demise ahead of time As his personal attorney know how he wished to dispose of his property He himself requested that visit him in the hospital and we discussed the matter Alas we failed to document his wishes in writing as required by law am therefore forced to acknowledge the following He did not leave a will So the principle of legal succession enters into force First of all would like to advise that he left no debts Otherwise you would be liable to creditors for his debts Further it is my duty to inform you that under the law should one spouse die the surviving spouse has the right to a portion of the property acquired during the marriage That is to their share of the property held in common by the spouses during the marriage on an equal basis along with the other heirs This portion is included in the inheritance along with the personal property of the deceased However in this case during the time that you were formally married which was just over two years no common property was acquired Therefore there can be no talk of a spousal share here You will inherit a portion of the property of the deceased on an equal basis with Katya Since to the best of my knowledge there are no other heirs besides the two of you the entire estate will be equally divided between you If anything is unclear or you have any questions can explain further know that my father always kept a sizeable amount of cash in his home safe What happens to that already checked theres nothing Right Believe me Katya Of course Anything else Weve only started ve described the overall situation Lets look at the details If you like we can take a break No need lets go on Right Elena Yes lets go on Lets get started So how shall we carve up Dads pad Well be carving according to the law Thats that Mama We should drink to this agree Have we got anything Of course we do Well come on then Dont cry mamall be right back You know what Lets drink to Volodya He did at least one decent thing in his life Better still to Sasha Sasha Sash What Dont you what me Get in here
