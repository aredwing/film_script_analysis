didnt grow with you There are many talents like that not only in painting The more training youve had the more technique youve acquired why the more evident its become you werent going to make it Maybe its the life you lead Thats it You go to one party and you see a few people who seem strange to you and you find out m not the simple untouched girl was when left home and you recoil in horror m not ashamed of anything ve done And if the paintings are no good its not because ve gone to parties or had lovers or almost gotten married know what youre going to say next Youre going to say that ought to leave Paris That ought to come home like a good little girl and be a nice demure hypocritical piece of merchandise on the marriage market pretending dont know which end of a man is up Are you

were then they must be very free indeed Heres your drink As for your friends found them lively and amusing And m sure for the most part theyre industrious and useful members of society But theyre not for you They belong here Theyre doing something here and youre not The better they are the worse they are for you Youre their victim even if each and every one of them thinks he loves you from the bottom of his heart Victim What are they after my enormous fortune No After your gaiety and beauty and goodness of heart They recognize that you dont really belong here That youre an emotional transient And they They use you frivolously for their spare hours know what youre saying That ve wasted my years that m corrupted that should have stayed home like everyone else and never even taken a chance No no no Chris m not saying anything like that at all You havent wasted your years here Youre not corrupt dont want you to be like everybody else m proud of you for having taken a chance These years have done you a world of good So But now its time to come home city like Paris is a form of education one of the best of educations But its important to know when to quit school to know when the
