desk Who do you think did it Ideas or actionable intel Whats your gut say Simpson Got the raw talent He just got back from Afghanistan a couple months ago Spent time in the psych ward at Landstuhl Hes been in the shit too long We think hes somewhere in Syria tracking one of our members Shope And we think your boy Beckett might also be on his list Why would he want Brandon Because last night there

mayor He was working with the police to try to stop local farmers from growing heroin poppy One day the girl came home from school She found her fathers severed head on the front steps The police who had been hired to protect him assassinated him m sorry My mom picked up our lives and moved us to Chicago Never looked back And you joined the Corps Actually where realized could shoot Which brings me here back in the Middle East shooting longguns with you at the command of Major Bidwell actually learned a lot from him He taught me that no matter what country youre in You dont really know who the bad guys are So you find a shooter who you trust and join forces with him Gunny Get dressed need a minute Major m not good at small talking over the facts of things so m just gonna come out and say it sniper went rogue and killed several military officers One of those men was your father My father m sorry kid How Who Thats need to know know you never knew him and maybe it doesnt matter to you but he was the best shooter ever knew He wouldve been proud of you Is that it No m gonna take a small team and tie this thing off cant take you with me because the Colonel says so Besides you wouldnt know how to keep on the trigger without making it personal This isnt personal for you Yes it is But know how to make it a job Our training teaches us not to personalize killing myself think theres something to be said for revenge So what are you saying What m saying is hope you dont sneak off the base and take this thing into your own hands Because if you do you will be on loanout to yourself

Brandon Beckett left him back at the base Bullshit he was here Hes a resourceful kid So this is how you take care of my son Your son is a force recon Marine Scout Sniper highly skilled in field craft

If the assassin thought was dead figured hed do what you did And what would do Go to the next man on the list So who is the sniper Army Ranger David Simpson Simpson Now thats a damn shame put some lead on him but he was too far for me to put his lights out Master Guns word Whats on your mind Major To say youre along way from home is an understatement Were in the middle of the Middle East Allah

the wrong reasons You should go talk to him dont even know him And the next thing knew became him m not sure where to begin Where the fuck you been my whole life Start there Dont let this moment pass you Look here know theres some questions you want to ask me Gunny And m afraid youre not gonna like the answers sniper is just not a father walked It happened Should go on or can we skip this sad story with all its tears Lets skip it Lets talk about the mission Okay Simpson the assassin Simpsons working alone Major No he was never with them How do you know that Well my guy turned out to be quite talkative So how do we catch him Question Who sent all of you out here Who else The last thing Simpson said to me was that he was gunning for you and the Colonel Sounds like a trap to me Or a misdirection Maybe he wants us to lead him there The Colonels in Santorini In Greece Thats his new pivot point Nice Well looks like well need a cruise ship Him Hes the only one we didnt take on the mission Welcome to the shit Reese All right lets load up Reese we good m good Unless you wanna go again Not really But we can Lets not You kicked my ass the first time Are these scanners operational They should be What do you got in mind You said this shooter uses a remote control firing platform Remotefiring systems are linked in the cell signals With a celltuned scanner could pinpoint the exact location of his firing platform Get on that So who is this guy anyway Hes working for someone Or hes crazy Or both hunted this kid once He did the hero side of Afghanistan from the Fifth Stryker Brigade month deployment in the Helmand River Valley Heavy action really heavy You know he was a good Marine but it got to his soul Messed him up really good The psychs tagged him with but they didnt discharge him They didnt really treat him either For three months he wandered the base with a weapon January first he went into his hooch grabbed his weapon and he shot up a New Years Party Then he trekked up to Yosemite National Forest No food no shelter temperatures dropping below freezing When we finally spotted him he was up the mountain above the snow line Just sitting there staring into dawns early light And then he ate his gun If Simpsons broken he makes a perfect puppet for the Colonel What You think hes in on this sure hope to God hes not You dont drink coffee Not much No bad habits like cars Thats a bad habit It is if theyre expensive How about you like to fish Well maybe well cast a line someday Hey Dad Yeah Might want to get square if youre gonna go see a colonel Right If you get this Simpson in your sights you put some hot lead into him One shot one kill Yes sir Brandon You hold my weapon Master Guns Excuse me sir You have a phone call Excuse me please Yes whos

General Phil Daniels the esteemed Senator from North Dakota and the Syrian Rebel Forces And from the looks of it a couple of Playboy Bunnies Well We dont all wear a ghillie suit and creep around Question Did you send an assassin to track me and the other members of Mission Sentinel If sent a kill squad for you you would not be here having this conversation Damn Thomas we go back a long way Yeah yep Twentyfive years Thats right So if you think m gonna stand here and let you point your finger in my face you can go to straight to hell Beckett Well then tell me whats happening Whats

Get the fuck up Youre enjoying this arent you Why shouldnt This is my last hurrah The field sniper is a dinosaur Youre extinct and youre right in my kill zone Now youre right in my kill zone Fucking Beckett Two shots one kill You slipping Master Guns It was intended The first shot was just to let him know Let him know Yeah let him know he was about to die You got a phone call Hello Gunnery Sergeant Beckett Yes Colonel wanted to thank you for being a good Marine Not necessary sir We tied this off you did most of the heavy lifting That kind of work hits my radar Thank you sir Is that all
