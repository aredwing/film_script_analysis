belt But he didnt come At first was relieved but then realized that he was ashamed and that he hated me heard my parents argue for the first time They were whispering so that could not hear think my mother defended me The next morning was was standing right there watched my father as he crossed the street and he seemed so He seemed so small Some Jews hid some fled Others were shot right in the middle of the street Our upstairs neighbor was thrown out the window and all my father could think of was that his son had stolen a cake stupid cake So he went to apologize And never saw him again
