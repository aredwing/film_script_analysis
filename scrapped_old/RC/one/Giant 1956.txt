time Come to see us Thank you Byebye Come see us think youll agree your sister was a very generous woman She wanted that boy to have something worthwhile Now that little piece of land is worth at most

yourself comfortable Its a real bad wind that doesnt blow somebody some good dont have to tell you that Luz was a woman of strong sentimental feeling She prepared a list of things she wanted to give all the people on Reata Yes We find that she wanted to We find that her bequest to you was in the nature of a little piece of ground Its the little piece we used to call Buffalo Wallow She wanted to give you something know she did Its always been my aim to try to keep Reata intact within the family Now that little piece is worth at most How much Bale At the most d say or Bick Mr Benedict wanting to honor his sisters wishes and of course right along with his own personal feeling for you He wants to see to it that you get something really worthwhile Now to get down to the point Mr Rink were prepared to place in your hands in cash the sum of which any of these gentlemen here m sure will be happy to tell you is twice the value of that land Definitely At least twice the value of that land Thats a lot of money What are you aiming do with all of it Youre in the chips now boy There it is There it is boy And its all yours dont know what to say She sure was a fine lady Yes she was a fine lady Hallelujah Amen want you to know that appreciate her generosity Yours too Bick And you all want to thank you for it You know something Bick dont know but it might not be a pretty good idea to gamble along with old Madama How do you mean Just gamble on Just keep what she gave me m sentimental too Bick think its good to gamble on with her know that land aint worth much but then someday just might up and put my own fence around her and call her Little Reata See you Theres one thing on this earth more important than money and thats land heard Luz say it a thousand times Pa said it and Bick
