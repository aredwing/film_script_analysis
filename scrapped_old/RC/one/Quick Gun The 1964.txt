to commit suicide you couldve found a lot easier way Youre one of the few people around who ever cared whether did or not Clint there hasnt been a shooting in Shelby since you left Who gets the medal You or the town All right know how you feel But when you rode out of here two years ago they thought your guns were gone for good When rode back here today couldve used that on Rick Morrison but didnt Now that should tell you where stand m not the one you have to convince Do you think for one minute that Tom Morrisons forgotten that you killed his two sons It was them or me you know it and this town knows it And they know this Your guns got too fast and too sudden And from what hear about your reputation theyve got a lot faster and a lot suddener in the last two years Scotty sounds to me like youre letting some of this towns hate rub off on you ve got a job to do Friendship or not cant let a gunslinger stay here You might just have to put up with it My fathers dead now Scotty aim to claim the ranch And start another battle with the Morrisons No deal Clint Now water your horse and get out dont want any trouble here Youre going to get it whether you want it or not Jud Spangler will be raiding Shelby before the days over Spangler He knows most of the men are away on a cattle drive and the banks full of cattle buying money You seem to have an awful lot of information He wanted me with him Soon as he finds the two dead men left at Big Rock Canyon hell be coming Big Rock If they ride their horses into the ground they could be here by sundown Most likely night depends on how long it takes them to find the two deadmans Theres something dont understand Knowing how you feel about this town you still came here to warn us Finding out how the town still feels about me shouldve saved myself the ride Schools letting out have those kids to worry about could use every gun hand could get You asking me to stay now Scotty didnt hear you making any offer Thats right didnt If do say itll be for my own reasons You mean Helen Shes over at the schoolhouse Thanks Clint dont mention Spangler er dont want a panic in this town You took a long time Sheriff When are you getting Cooper out of here When have to answer to you ll turn in my badge Sheriff wed like to know Youll know when m ready this doesnt concern any of you Now go on about your business Keely As soon as get the other council

you want to be the first one to say youre glad m back glad Clint It makes it worth some of the thinking ve been doing about you the past two years Yeah What did you think Clint That might change my mind about us Kind of a hope had with me What kind of a hope could have Youre still wearing that gun you havent stopped killing ve had time to think about that too think could leave the law in Scottys hands now Helen the past can be forgotten Theres still a lot of future for us if we want it You have no right to expect anything of me Clint What did you think That this schoolhouse could be my whole life When you left you left me nothing to love needed something Now its too late No it isnt too late Now you listen to me My fathers ranch sits on good land we can turn that into one of the best cow outfits in this country Something wed be proud of something wed be proud to hand on to our children Why didnt you think of that two years ago Now listen to me and let this end it One week from Sunday Scotty and are being married Its kind of funny always kind of thought the difference between Scottys job and mine was a badge guess was wrong If it had to happen m glad its Scotty He deserves someone like you Bang bang bang bang Are you trying to ride the flesh off that horse or did you forget he belongs to me If ever forgot youd remind me Thats right ll also remind you that youre only living by the grace of God and Tom Morrison Anything to say to that Yes m glad m only your nephew and not one of your sons You talk about my boys like that again and ll run you right off this ranch Youll get nothing from me do you hear Nothing Youve been taking out on me since Clint Cooper left You can stop now hes back Where In town just rode in Get our guns You going for him now in broad daylight Two years ve waited two years Get our guns promise you there will be a grave for Clint Cooper too Theres two of us You make him draw first do you understand that want him dead legal Like an execution Mrs Swanson Been a long time Mike Clint please got to ask you to leave It wouldnt be good business for me Whisky Leave it Welcome back Cooper Mr Morrison please You think your guns fast enough for the two of us have had to answer that question many times This will be the last time Is that what you thought when you sent your sons gunning for me You stood in my way You tried to steal our land Morrison Why are we talking so much You gonna draw Cooper Awfully anxious to have me draw first Thats so Mike can tell the sheriff we killed you legal Are you ready to take your chances didnt come looking for you Now leave me alone Cooper youre yellow Now draw Sorry Cant oblige you Not today anyway Are you weaselling out of it Cooper Thats the only kind of trouble can afford Morrison Thats enough If you started this No no Scotty ve got to be honest The kid was just having a peaceful drink when they started all this And m not finished Damn fool We got other trouble Thats your trouble Coopers mine Keely and Mitch are over at my office right now for a meeting called Are you going to be there or not m going to that meeting right now Am gonna tell that council youre staying on and helping us or not You think of any reason why should No cant Then thats what you tell them All right good luck Get started without me Youre a mess Clint got to admit the Morrisons didnt look much better was going to drop by to see you Dan but guess just needed a drink first know Clint Scotty told me that you saw Helen got some cold water and liniment at the hotel or dont you even want to stay long enough to make repairs Take a look Hes dead Rockheaded idiot got himself killed That looks like Dex Well It looks like they both was in no condition to come back and warn us That gunslinging snake Spang hes got a big headstart on that money That he has That he has Now in that case were just going to have to figure if the law dont catch him we will Come on around here reckon this liniment wont do much good for the kind of hurt you think you have Theres nothing holding me here When you left Shelby you spit on the town All of us didnt spit back In my business you cant have any friends found that out today So youd rather just ride out of here and keep on using those guns for something that cant ever matter didnt want it that way Dan See you Clint Is that what youll be saying tomorrow when youre wondering what Spangler did to this town Spangler will want more than money can tell you that m sure you all remember what he did to Big Ben Iron Bill and Frank When he wanted women he took them After his men got liquored up they burned the towns to the ground And that is what he has in mind for Shelby What can we do Well never be able to get our ranch hands back from the drive Theyre too far away Why are we taking Coopers word for it He and Spangler rode together this could be a trick Are you out of your head Am You got some kind of guarantee Cooper wont be a paid killer behind our backs while Spangler hits us from the front said d stay here and help fight Spangler If wanted to kill you Morrison youd be dead already Back off Morrison Were wasting a lot of time we havent got Spangler might be miles from this town right now How do we vote Mitchell Well Scotty youre the law If you think we should stay its your decision We need help thats all know You know how vote Theres four against you Morrison You know Spangler best you got any ideas The town is fairly well protected from both sides by the hills Why dont we build a barricade on each end of the street Keely you spread the word without getting the women hysterical Mitchell tell the Reverend to put the women and children up in the church Make sure theres water food and plenty of blankets Morrison you got extra guns at your place bring them in All right Sheriff its your party But m going to tell you something ll remember not to turn my back on Cooper What do do Get all the extra men and drag out everything you can use for the barricades Scotty what about the money Are you going to leave it in the bank Why Seems to me that would be the first place Spangler would look You are right ll see that it is moved Good if he breaks through it might give us the extra time we need The town knows what it has to face now And its doing its job The men are tensing up can see how scared the women are wish could tell them were a lot smarter than Spangler but cant In the end thats going to make the big difference Get those bales off that wagon Food and waters in the church Helens getting the blankets now May as well will bring out that kerosene Setting fire to a barricade like that is liable to blow up the whole town If we dont Spangler will Go inside and take a seat Everybody stay calm Reverend how come were having church on a Thursday If it was up to me young fellow wed have it every day Reverend if my husband and the other men knew what was happening here m sure they could get back in time The sheriff is the best judge of how much time we have bet there is going to be a lot of shooting around here huh Reverend Get moving the Reverend is busy Theres more blankets if you need them May as well go ahead and douse it Clint dont know who else has thanked you for helping but d like to As long as was coming back anyway Sorry couldnt have brought better news Right there There you are Helen Are we going to sleep on those dont see why not During the Sunday sermons Pa sleeps without a bed You go back and stay with your mother Where can set all this up Well lets see guess maybe this would be the safest place Mitchell Yes Scotty Help me put this table up here will you Some other things want to bring in Is everything getting organised Best we can Helen theres something think you ought to know This note was left on my desk Clint left it there Clint It says that if we get out of this mess that he wants us to take his ranch as a wedding present Oh Scotty no How do you refuse a fellow that gives you the only thing he owns Then hes planning to leave Shelby You dont want him to do you Do you Scotty said would marry you That hasnt changed Hasnt it Sooner or later guess we had to find out You loved him before you still love him Nobodys to blame for that This stuff go to the sheriffs office Yeah guns for a bunch of old men farmers storekeepers and they wont even know what to do with them You think we havent got a chance against Spangler Itd be a miracle Coopers guns could make a difference And if that happens the town will change its thinking about Cooper Hell get to be a big man If youd been smart enough to make him draw in the first place everything would be settled by now He wont be so big hell be cut down to size before this nights over Load up How is it going got the women and children in the church found that note you left Why didnt you tell me about you and Helen before went to see her You know how many times asked her before she agreed to marry me She was always hoping youd come back Youve been drinking She wants no part of me just left her Helen and wont be getting married Does that answer your question Did you get that money moved out of the bank Theres a trapdoor in the jail That ought to keep Spangler guessing for a little while Diego since you and Donovan are the only two around with honest faces seems like you should be the ones to ride into Shelby and find out if the laws caught up with our old friend Clint Cooper And what if we find Clint just kind of hanging around on a tree Well now that would be a good way of knowing for sure he aint got to the bank ahead of us The main thing for you to find out is the money still there Well be over in them rocks until you get back Been a long week Seems to me he should have been here by now Cant depend on Spangler doing what you expect him to ll go down and see how Dans making out Make sure theres enough kerosene on that barricade Keep walking Cooper No noise You picked a hell of a time to start something Morrison waited too long to let Spangler have the pleasure of killing you One shot would bring everybody running You aint worth going to jail for Cooper Besides a gun makes it too fast Get the rope You really work hard at hating dont you Morrison Did you ever see a man dancing at the end of a rope with his feet just barely off the ground He dies slow Cooper so slow It would make my waiting worth these last two years You take away a mans sons you take away everything hes got to live for Too bad your father cant be here to see his son die Wait No guns He wants it that way let him have it that way Circle him ll get him from this side All right Cooper you want to hate me for killing you Thats the way its gonna be Get those women back in the church Get back to your posts What the hell didnt get any choice Scotty Toms dead What are you men doing here Are you trying to make it easy for Spangler Get back to your posts Reverend you get back to the church Coopers going to hang for this Hes a killer just like we all said never thought Cooper would gun em down at a time like this told you get back to your posts mean it You cant believe went gunning for the Morrisons They wanted to string me up Well dont believe it Clint Helen you stay out of this Give me the gun Clint Youre not going to arrest him What do you want me to do dont make the laws The man has to stand trial whether want him to not Lets go Dan youve got no business here had to see if youd really do it youre locking Clint up You think ve got a choice Dont you think want him out there on the barricade with us His gun gave us a chance And youre letting a lot of backbiting idiots talk you out of it Sheriff something something up the road Scotty good luck Thanks ll need it ll see you later boy The Lord willing Theres only two of them Hold it right there Howdy Sheriff Looks like you fellas are getting ready for some kind of a turkey shoot You might even say that a turkey wouldnt be safe here tonight You folks expecting some kind of trouble Nothing we cant handle Where you boys from Mountain country Up around Butte We holed up last night at Goose Egg Joe Wylies trading post Thats right We figured wed head out to the summer grass country Better you keep heading We were figuring on leaving some of our money over to the saloon Theres a creek back about five miles Best you stick to water Well thats mighty inhospitable Sheriff We just dont want any strangers staying in our town and getting shot at by Spangler and his mob Spangler Names enough to give you the creeps With that critter coming should think youd want us to stay around and give you some help You just move back there slow and easy back down the road wouldnt want any of my men to mistake you for a turkey Now now Sheriff we aint ready to be stuck yet so thank you very much for the warning We could have used them Why did you say we had plenty of men Think we should have told Spangler we dont Spangler They just came in to look the situation over tell Spangler which way to move Youre just guessing They were two more guns we couldve used They didnt come from Goose Egg Joe Wylie hasnt had that trading post for six months Then why didnt you jail them thought they might serve us better if they went back and told Spangler we were ready for them You think thatll stop him from coming With those two showing up the gang must be close by Well take them on get back to Spangler and give him the news But thats all the time weve got to find out whether hes coming or not Youd better get back to the other barricade That sheriff was bluffing They give you a big song and dance about having a lot of men guess your faces aint as honest as thought they was They had you figured He sure wasnt bluffing about them barricades But them gun hands hes got behind him Gun hands There aint ten men and the whole town know which end of the gun they shooting Yeah Well sure aint finding out by having them practising on me Listen to me ll tell you just when you get shot and when not do you understand that Dont forget it Hes been around too long Now hes figuring hell die of old age So you dont like them barricades Theyve got to be took Spang and it aint going to be easy You think my brains are drying up or something See anything of Clint Cooper No not a sign Dirty yellowlivered rat Give him a warning All right Mount up were moving in All my life ve had to fight for something or against it Now cant do either All can do is wait Wait and try not to think about what Spanglers going to do to this town We didnt bluff him God have mercy on us All right boys this is where we split up Lacey you take your men and circle the town You know when to come in on the other side Just keep them pinned down at that barricade Remember well take care
