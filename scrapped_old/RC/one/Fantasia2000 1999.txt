Its my verypleasantduty to welcomeyouhere onbehalfofall the otherartists andmusicians whose combinedtalents wentinto the creation ofthis new form ofentertainment Fantasia Whatyou willsee on thescreen is apicture ofthe various abstractimages thatmightpass throughyourmind ifyousatin a concerthall listening to this music Now there are threekinds ofmusic on this Fantasia program First theres thekind that tells a definitestory Then theres thekindthat while ithas nospecificplot doespaintaseries ofmore orless definitepictures Then theres a thirdkind music thatexists simply forits own sake Thenumberthatopens our Fantasia program is music ofthis thirdkind You know whats amazing is that many ofthese musicians are playing for the very fi rst time thanks to Steve Martins TwoWeek Master Musician Home Study course More about that later Hello and welcome to Fantasia Its been more than years since Walt Disney and his artists teamed up with maestro Leopold Stokowski to create a fi lm they titled The ConcertFeature thinkwere all glad that they changed the name to Fantasia You know Fantasia was meant to be a perpetual work in progress Every timeyou went to see it youd experience some new pieces along with some old familiar favorites But that idea fell by the wayside until now So let me turn things over to the great ltzhak Perlman who havejust been informed plays the violin Well so do l Big deal Could have myviolin please Ah thankyou All right boys lets Oh sorry Could have another stick thingy please Oh and camera back on me Camera back on me When you hear a title like Pines of Rome you might think oftreelined streets and romantic ruins But when the Disney animators heard this music they thought ofsomething completely different Here is the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by maestroJames Levine performing Ottorino Respighis Pines of Rome Beautiful Ralph Hi Next were gonna takeyou to the streets of New York City for a piece thats inspired by a couple ofmy favorite artists First theres the illustrator Hirschfeld whos been drawing celebrities and Broadway stars for most ofthe th century And then theres composersongwriter George Gershwin who tookjazz off the streets dressed her up and took her to the concert hall My friend Ralph Grierson plays piano on this next number And it all starts with a single slinky note on a clarinet and a simple line on a piece ofpaper Ladies and gentlemen Rhapsody ln Blue Hi You may not know this but over theyears the Disney artists have cooked up dozens ofideas for new Fantasia segments Some ofthem made it to the big screen this time but others Iots ofothers how can put this politely didnt For example the Danish illustrator Kay Nielsen drew these sketches for a segment inspired byWagners Ride ofthe Valkyries Here they are and there they go Now Salvador Dali you know the limp watches guy he got into the act with an idea that featured baseball as a metaphor for life How come that didnt work Makes perfect sense to me Lets see Then we had a bug ballet and a baby ballet and for a time they even considered a sequence inspired by The Polka and The Fugue from Weinbergers Schwanda the Bagpiper But fi nally a success The Disney artists wanted to create a short fi lm based on Hans Christian Andersens wonderful fairy tale TheSteadfast Tin Soldier but they could never fi nd the perfect musical match until now Here is Yefi m Bronfman playing the Shostakovich Piano Concerto Number and TheSteadfast Tin Soldier These drawing boards have been the birthplace ofsome ofthe most beloved animal characters ofall time So its no surprise that the artists chose for our next segment The Carnival ofthe Animals by Camille SaintSans Here the sensitive strains ofimpressionistic music combine with the subtle artistry ofthe animator to fi nally answer that ageold question What is mans relationship to nature Oh sorry That ageold question What would happen ifyou gave a yoyo to a flock offlamingos Who wrote this Ladies and gentlemen wed like to take a moment ifwe may to talk about a little something we like to refer to as magic Uh picture this Youre at home hosting a birthday party foryour daughter and youve just shelled out bucks so some pathetic loser can pull a mangy rabbit out ofa flea market hat At fi rst you might wonder toyourself How did he do that But then you would probably just dismiss it as some sort ofa trick And you know something Youd be right Itsjust a trick Its an example ofwhat we laughingly refer to as stage magic Were here to tell you that all stage magic is a fraud a hoax a sham Its all based on deception and yep lyin All ofit Sleight ofhand Iies Transformations fraud Dismemberment ripoff Fake All are illusions What were here to talk about is real magic Were gonna bring on a guy now whos the real deal the genuine article In fact he taught us everything we know And he is featured prominently in the next sequence from the original Fantasia The Sorcerers Apprentice You know come to think ofit The Sorcerers Apprentice is a is is a little guy who uh who never speaks andjust kinda messes everything up Iike him And now Wha And now the Oh Hi Hi little fella gotta gotta And now The Sorcerers Apprentice Mr Stokowski Mr Stokowski Just wanted to offer my congratulations sir Congratulations toyou Mickey Aw gee thanks Well gotta run now So long Mr Levine Okay Mr Levine Everybodys in

Noahs Ark with one slight twist Oh Donald Duck Who is it Donald its me Mickey Youre on in seconds Hurry What You gotta be kidding m not even dressed OkayJim hes on his way Go to the intro Ladies and gentlemen Pomp and Circumstance starring Donald Duck Walt Disney described the art ofanimation as a voyage ofdiscovery into the realms ofcolor sound and motion The music from lgor Stravinskys ballet The Firebird inspires such a voyage And so we conclude this version of Fantasia with a mythical story oflife death and renewal Camera back onme Uh camera back onme please AnyoneHelloHello
