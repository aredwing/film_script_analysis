way Sorry about that Ugh What kind of kingdom allows its royalty to dress like that Ugh Sweetheart how many times do have to say this dont care if you offer me triple what its worth am not selling my camp In fact m branching out Thats absurd Darling this lake isnt big enough for both of us to expand And lets be honest music is a fickle business One day youre on top the next youre a hasbeen Perhaps you should cut your losses now and get out Oh at least m developing real talent over here while youre doing What exactly eh Running an outdated charm school How dare you We have a situation We have a situation This conversation is over Nope Not a princess Duchess Nah Uhuh Not even a countess by marriage m only a teenager so no You dont know who am do you Not a clue Hmm Cool Exactly how did this happen Oh Uh Her name was on the list And when was called just went where was told Yeah well it looks like theres been some sort of system glitch knew we shouldnt have switched to the same datasharing network Ugh Typical of the royals Always trying to make my life difficult Sorry for the mixup Princess But clearly youre at the wrong camp So what do do now First well need to verify your enrollment status then correct the administrative error in order to process your transfer Trouble is its getting kind of late So theres nothing we can do right now You mean have to stay here Clive here will find you some accommodations for the evening Off you go now Well take care of this as soon as we possibly can High five Here Stevie will take care of your lodging okay Okay And dont look so worried Its

Camp Pop Yeah Everybody knows that didnt know Sorry Whoa Listen hope you dont mind me saying this but Uh m sorry whats your name Courtney m Rayna and this is Zia Hello Pleased to meet you Anyway No

whats your style dont really have one m a princess Who isnt around here am right Wait youre not kidding Shes not kidding No m not So are we supposed to bow in your presence or something Oh that wont be necessary Do you have any evil stepsisters Well one is a little bossy Have you ever yelled Off with their head No Royal life isnt nearly as exciting as that trust me Do you live in a castle Are you cursed by a witch Have you ever turned a frog into a handsome prince Zia come on now thats just in fairy tales Wait have you royal tree house Whoa check it out Hello Anyone here Wow Fancyschmancy May help you Oh Hi Well m Ooh You must be here to give us our manis What do you think Genevieve was thinking about French tips but maybe should go with something more daring Aubray unless our guest has a giant emery board in there dont think thats why shes here Do you Well thats disappointing because these cuticles are a mess My names Erika Lady Anne said could stay here But dont worry it wont be for long m moving to the other side of the lake Wait youre a pop star Wait a second Youre Erika Juno Oh Yeah am wanted you to play at my sweet Daddy said No Youre not going to trash our room are you What No Sign my magazine Um sure Blare loud music all night long Uh brought headphones Is it true you get to fly in a private jet and go all over the world Sometimes And what about an entourage d love my own entourage Youre a princess Aubray you already have an entourage Oh Right Have you ever smashed a guitar on stage saw that in a movie once It looked so much like fun cant find it Zia You sure you packed it Of course m sure never go anywhere without it Were gonna be late Uh Got it So what do you think Very uh colorful Its just that you already have such amazing hair Hmm guess youre right Besides we have to stop by wardrobe later anyway Maybe ll find something better You mean you can wear whatever you want Nobody picks your clothes for you Not since was three No Anyway sorry to bolt but band practice starts in like five minutes And then weve got a strut your stuff dance class after that And this year we get to learn special effects Lasers lighting sparkles you name it Come on Zia m guessing thats probably not her kind of thing Unless you wanna check it out mean as long as youre here Uh dont know No worries just thought itd be fun Hmm Fun Yes mean that sounds lovely dont know Genevieve Are you certain we dont have tea party etiquette first Positive Hold on how did you do that With my scepter of course All royals have one Whoa Scepter training starts at after that its tea time Oh And then we get to groom the unicorns Yeah right And when do we get to ride the centaurs Wait does Camp Pop have centaurs That is so unfair Right Unicorns suppose we could bring you along to meet them Wait what Theyre really beautiful Unless you have to get going Yeah probably should Okay Hey wait up The size of his ego is nothing short of astounding mean honestly who in their right mind thinks teaching a bunch of misfits how to bang on a cowbell is more important than cultivating the finest royal traditions hmm The man is delusional Lady Anne What you provide to these budding monarchs is truly a gift It is isnt it Think Clive Think Hmm There must be a way to acquire his property and teach him a lesson at the same time Does it have to be legal How lovely One of our new campers perhaps Shall we See told you it was her cant believe it Wow Why have never heard such a powerful voice Pity it will go to waste under Finns mediocre guidance Lady Anne dont you know who that is Thats Erika Juno Shes the coolest thing ever Look Are you thinking what m thinking romantic dinner followed by a walk by the lake Oh Clive you are a cutup Whoa Boss phone call Hmm Its the Royal Pain About time Calling me back so soon mean ve only left you five messages about this camper mixup But whos counting eh Oh charming as always Finn But unfortunately rectifying our little situation will have to wait as ve been informed that our computer system has mysteriously gone dead Much like your career suspect How nice You just think that up At least we have a skill the world actually needs So in other words your protgs are more deserving than mine is that it Then why not prove it And how do you suggest we do that Well let me think Perhaps a singoff Camp Royalty versus Camp Pop My kids against yours You cant be serious Perfectly The winning camp shall be awarded all of the property surrounding the lake The losing camp shall close its doors for good Why do get the feeling that youre up to something Eh After all youve got one of my pop kids over there Please And you have an entire camp full of them So why worry Unless youre not up for the challenge Lady youre on Excellent Clive will be in touch to work out the details How it is possible that you and that man were ever romantically involved will never know Oh It was a long time ago Clive Before realized that rock and royalty do not mix Youre not serious Courtney No really And then when she unveiled her portrait it was a donkey in a dress You pranked the Duchess Did she ever find out Nope ve never told anyone that before Well were truly honored To Courtney Princess of Pranks And so long story short thats when got to sing my very first solo At the Paris Palladium When you were five could barely dress myself at that age Youre not that great at it now Edmund Greetings everyone have a thrilling announcement At the conclusion of this years session we shall participate in what promises to be another glorious moment in our storied history Were talking about the biggest challenge ever to hit this lake competition to end all competitions singoff between Camp Pop and Camp Royalty Yeah Yeah And check out whos

song selection You guys must be psyched about going headtohead with Camp Pop Of course Absolutely Actually no Not really Were good but not that good Were really not Guys dont underestimate yourselves Listen whenever get nervous in front of a large crowd You picture everyone in their underwear No Gross just close my eyes and imagine m singing all by myself Then m fine You can do this And while m here ll help how can Really You would do that for us Totally Oh Thats what friends do Okay gang take five Hey Courtney Uh yeah Listen m sorry for the holdup but havent been able to make any headway

Absolutely Its been cool ve made some great friends Lovely And speaking of that had the absolute pleasure of hearing you sing yesterday We are all huge huge fans of your work Thanks No thank you talent like yours is a rare find indeed In fact only wish you could remain here and compete in the singoff as a member of Camp Royaltys a cappella group As our featured vocalist What an honor that would be Wow dont know what to say mean guess could Splendid Run along now our star Tata Bye Hello Is anyone here Hmm must be early spend too much time thinking about Who m supposed to be play by everybodys rules That dont seem right to me m cool and polite on the outside But when get a chance run and hide If your eyes are closed Its hard to see What if back down now Cause m afraid of what might happen What if they turn away When show them who truly am What if lose my breath When throw those big doors open Or tonight Just tonight What if shine Should even care Theyre all sitting there And everyones staring at me If step out in the spotlight Maybe ll be set free What if back down now Cause m afraid of what might happen What if they turn away When show them who truly am What if lose my breath When throw those big doors open Or tonight Just tonight What if shine Shine ve spent too much time thinking about Who m supposed to be But what if sing out loud Because anything can happen What if stand up proud And show them who truly am Theyre gonna call my name And ll throw these big doors open Cause tonight Just tonight m gonna shine Shine Whoa What was that Where did you learn that kind of wrote it You wrote that That was off the hook m not really allowed to play it at the castle Its kind of a classical music only zone Do you have any more More But you guys are so good Why would you want to play my music My thoughts exactly As our friend Marcus here said What was that think its called making music Sloane Its a little something we do around here And it was slamming Who knew Courtney could sing like that Hello We have a competition coming up So maybe you should skip the sappy singalongs and practice the actual number were going to perform Okay with you Princess Or would you rather go across the lake where you belong Courtney dont listen to Sloane You were awesome So good Thanks appreciate it Sorry just need some fresh air We are at camp Isnt all the air fresh Zia It is the role of a princess To hold her head up high An honor a privilege Today and days gone by princess is loyal smile upon her face Wherever she may travel The worlds a better place When youre a princess Its all up to you When youre a princess The good that you do And now were together For summer in the sun Were dancing and singing The day is never done Tea parties tiaras The finest lines of lace Whenever were together The worlds a better place When youre a princess Ooh Its all up to you When youre a princess The good that you do When youre a princess The way that you live When youre a princess You get what you give Attend the royal ball Be kind to one and all Make sure to set your sights Higher Strive to be true to be true This is our responsibility When youre a princess Its all up to you Youre a leader When youre a princess The good that you do When youre a princess The way that you live Youre in charge When youre a princess Youre in charge yes you are Youre in charge You get what you give When youre a princess Cut What may ask was that Just a little improv thought the song could use more edge Oh see And you just decided that all on your own did you Yeah did You can solo all you want at Camp Pop but at Camp Royalty we do things as an ensemble The whole point is to blend in not stand out Olivia maybe Erika has a point Updating our material might not be a bad thing After all were competing with Camp Pop And were going to lose Sorry did say that out loud The song is perfect the way it is We dont need to change a thing Are we clear Crystal Maybe you might be more comfortable across the lake Erika Ugh cant work with these people Erika Not now Clive No Lady Anne cannot lose because of some unpredictable pop star Okay Clive its hero time What if sing out loud Because anything can happen What if stand up proud And show them who truly am Theyre gonna call my Thats really beautiful m sorry didnt see you there Happens to me all the time getting lost in a song Hey know you We met on the dock Right when was trying to make the boat The wrong boat by the way Wait youre the one whos supposed to be at Camp Pop Cause youre the one whos supposed to be at Camp Royalty m Erika Pleasure to meet you m Courtney Princess Courtney Just Courtney Should call you Princess Erika Nice ball gown Oh right No was just trying to royal it up guess Thats a cool outfit too Thanks It was a nice change mean was just trying to liven up the song But Olivia wasnt having any of it m sorry to hear that Tradition can be really important to royals Change is scary So are angry princesses know what you mean though Some of the Pop kids didnt take kindly to me singing one of my songs Music can be really competitive She probably feels threatened by you Youre good Thanks guess we were just fooling ourselves thinking we could fit in So its a plan We just do it Switch camps right now dont see why we cant Okay lets do this Just follow the lakeshore till you reach a bunch of castles You too But stop at the big piano That sounds cool It is youre going to love Camp Pop Its so much fun And think youll really like Camp Royalty mean thought it was gonna be awful But some of the people ve met are really awesome The friends made at Camp Pop are really nice too Thats what ll miss the friends Well now feel worse than before You know we could always not switch camps Keep things the way they are And make the best of it After all theres only a week left See you at the singoff Wouldnt miss it So as was saying Miss Petranova Allegra James will most likely side with Camp Pop while Prince Reginald will undoubtedly remain loyal to Camp Royalty Which leaves one vote still in play So we have a deal Ugh Because its a waste of our time thats why But how do you know if you wont even listen to it Listen to what Nothing Lady Anne Just an artistic difference of opinion Its just a new song ve been playing around with May see thought it might give us a fresher sound But as was just explaining to our guest Camp Royaltys performance piece has already been selected And given what little rehearsal time we have left say you do it m sorry do what now Perform Erikas song Shes absolutely right its fresh Its original Its got pizzazz And it will provide the perfect spotlight for her superstar talent which is our key to victory over Camp Pop Thanks Lady Anne My pleasure Now get to work and make Camp Royalty proud No no no Are you serious Thats the best you can do Rayna you missed the key change on the bridge Zia you missed the bridge entirely And you guys were flatter than a pancake Unbelievable You dont have to be so mean about it m sorry did you say something said you dont have to be so mean Everybodys just trying to do their best Yeah And what would you know about it Princess Sloane nobodys feeling this number Maybe we should try one of Courtneys songs instead Are you kidding me princess cant write songs Says who good song can come from anywhere And from anyone You write songs She sure does Theyre really good Well lets hear one Princess Oh dont know Come on Courtney But which one The one we played this morning Yeah You have got to be kidding me Creativity should always be encouraged Sloane Judgment can wait want to turn it up so dont you turn me down Cause when we get together We got a rockin sound Dont need to follow In somebody elses steps We make our own moves think you know the rest Just look around now Look what you got now Find yourself in the song Bring out the beat and the melody melody Find yourself in the song When were together its meant to be All it takes is one big dream You better find yourself in the song When were together its meant to be Yeah This is insane If you think were going to play a song by a princess d say

Tonight Nothing is what it seems No Okay that was better But your harmonies have got to be way tighter Perhaps were not the problem Meaning what Theres something wrong with the song That and the fact that youve given yourself every single solo reducing the rest of us into backup singers m sorry Olivia but did you not hear what Lady Anne said Camp Royalty needs my voice to win the competition Its a singoff not a tea party So maybe you should stick to what you know and leave the music to a professional Perhaps its slipped your mind but this camp is for royalty and we dont need some onehit wonder telling us what to do or how to do it Fine You wanna go down in flames be my guest Oh no Come quickly Erika Please dont walk away Dont go Erika come back Lets figure something out Guys Olivias never

Erika Ooh knew youd come to your senses Cant breathe Sorry Okay First you were right let that stuff Lady Anne said go to my head and made everything all about me So m really sorry about that But second you guys are not gonna believe what just found out Camp Pop really does have centaurs Uh no Oh Lady Anne made some kind of bet with Camp Pop and the loser has to shut down for good Oh no What

dreams You and me Yeah you and me Unlock our dreams No No no no no Oh sorry You were amazing We were amazing That was spectacular but whatre we supposed to do now How can we pick a winner if both camps competed together My dear am equally flummoxed Surely there must be some sort of protocol to follow in the event of such a predicament The entire point of any competition is to declare a winner and a loser Am right Miss Petranova By the way love the necklace Its absolutely stunning No we must vote Never in my life have witnessed such a travesty Judges must insist you disqualify Camp Pop immediately and declare Camp Royalty the victor Disqualify On what grounds Vocal sabotage No doubt orchestrated by Finn Oxford himself You are out of your mind had nothing to do with this Awkward Please we both know youd do anything to get back at me for ending our courtship Trust me call that a favor My only regret was not sending a thank you note Clive Clive Wow That was a bold move Princess Thanks Now what Lady Anne Lady Anne Lady Anne Never fear ll get you out of there Must you make that racket Oh m sorry is my trying to break us out of here bothering you Oh hate to tell you darling but youre not strong enough to open a jar of jam let alone break out of anything What is taking them so long Not a clue all dont think theyre actually gonna vote Out of the question They cant Can they No way They couldnt possibly Why am not surprised eh You never did believe in me Thats not true always had faith in your talent If you thought was so great then whyd you dump me Because knew when you hit it big you would have run off and left me behind Wait You knew d hit it big Yes And that d never fit into that life Rock and royalty dont mix Finn There was always room for you in my life Annie There always has been Oh May we have everyones attention The judges have made their decision After your somewhat unorthodox but amazing performance ve decided that cant possibly pick a winner Nor can however can Camp Royalty is the victor We won We won we won Well we tried our best It totally stinks that we couldnt save both camps suppose we should let them out of there Oh Thats not right Ew Aw Youre just saying that Am not Are too What happened This magic is more powerful than thought Lady Anne did you hear Victory is ours Camp Royalty has won And Camp Pop is through Done In your face Actually Clive thats where youre wrong m sorry what now The situation has changed Uh Lady Anne perhaps youre disoriented maybe even a bit woozy from your ordeal Because the judges have made their decision understand that Clive But Finn and are overruling that decision What No you cant We can As a result we have a tie Tie It means theres no winner And no loser So both camps are saved How could you do this to me To us And why are you holding his hand It turns out rock and royalty can mix We let assumptions about each other keep us from having something special and we pushed you guys to take sides But those days are over Therefore starting next summer our two camps will merge into one creating a place that will celebrate rock and royalty alike No We were supposed to win Now Clive bribed a judge for you You You What Nothing Which judge Oh Clive You might want to make yourself scarce about now No no no No no The thing is mean No you dont understand Lady Anne did it all for So any plans for next summer Going on tour Actually think m done with the whole pop star solo act thing Really Maybe you should start a band Maybe should Know anyone sure do Yes Yes am in Oh That was fun Yes well anyway knew it Now all we need is a killer name How about Rock n Royals Thats a great name Brilliant Love it Cant wait Cant wait Cant wait One two three four Cant wait to jam by the lake So many memories to make Bet well be staying awake You will be staying awake All night Gotta gotta gotta get to camp Oh Gotta gotta gotta get to camp Gotta gotta gotta get to camp Okay Now Sometimes you gotta shine spend too much time thinking about Who m supposed to be play by everybody elses rules That dont seem right to me Cause m cool and polite on the outside But when get the chance just run and hide But if your eyes are closed Then it gets too hard to see What if get afraid Dont be afraid What if just turn away Dont just turn away What if hide my face Dont you hide your face What if lose my breath my breath But then think Wait What if shine shine shine shine shine Shine shine shine What if shine shine shine shine shine Shine shine shine What if Should even care Theyre all sitting there And everybodys staring at me At me Maybe if step into the spotlight can be set free Cause m cool and polite on the outside Outside But when get the chance just run and hide But if you never try Then guess youll never see What if get afraid Dont be afraid What if just turn away Dont just turn away What if hide my face Dont you hide your face What if lose my breath my breath But then think Wait What if shine shine shine shine shine Shine shine shine What if shine shine shine shine shine Shine shine shine
