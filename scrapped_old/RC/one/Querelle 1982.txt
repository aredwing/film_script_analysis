The thought of murder often evokes thoughts of the sea and of sailors What naturally follows thoughts of the sea and murder is the thought of love or sexuality Hey Closing time Didnt you understand me Robert Its closing time Then lock the door Robert is staying with me What did you say You heard me Robert is staying here with me tonight What do you think of that Of what After all shes still your wife You think should be jealous It would be normal Maybe but whats normal We got a deal Lysiane does what she feels like and leaves me free to do what want understand Thats important for me Chicago Indeed Anyway want to read his cards Right kiddo Hope you know what youre doing You know know what want Youve lost Mario Then lets have another drink You have a brother So what You never mentioned him Why should Youre very much alike arent you Thats what other people say but it isnt true Querelle is a sailor Maybe its true And you love one another more than youd like to Bullshit Were brothers and thats all there is to it Why are you shaking your head dont know why but your brother is in great danger In danger What kind of danger In danger of finding himself Its difficult to brush past those shoulders profiles curls those strong and supple boys without imagining them capable of murder Finally land And broads Juicy cunts Hot and wet Have you been in Brest before Why Because theyve got the raunchiest whorehouse in the world The Feria Right Thats the name of the place Any of you guys know it Yeah but only from what ve heard And what have you heard Nothing specific They say every trick has to throw dice with the boss if he wants to catch a hooker Nono Thats the name of the Feria boss Thats right Nono Why do they have to throw dice Thats the rule When you win you get to have your pick When you lose you have to let the boss fuck you first Really Really and m damn sure theres plenty of guys who kinda like losing If it turns them on So what Once have suffered the solitude caused by my peculiarity long enough it may be that naked will hold these boys who shatter me with their audacity and strength against my body Though hardly dare believe it With tears in my eyes thank God for granting me this bliss My tears soften me melt with their wetness on my cheeks toss roll in waves of tenderness for these boys and their hard shallow cheeks Querelles great passion is his own body in repose It is as if hes reflecting himself in his own image Hes looking at himself as if through a magnifying glass Hes scrutinizing the minute events like an etymologist But how shining is his body in the glory of his proud movements Your boots sir Leave them there Anything else sir No thank you Since they themselves wished to deny it the strange resemblance of the two brothers seemed attractive only to others They met only in the evenings as late as possible in the one bed of a room near the one in which their mother had lived in poverty Perhaps they met again in their love for their mother but at such a deep level that they could not see it at all How long have you been in Brest Since yesterday Never thought d run into you here m the lover of the boss Lysiane and have been for the last six months What about her husband Hes got interests of his own Why did you come here Got a little business to take care of m looking for a customer Opium Yeah thats right No sweat Nonos the contact you want ll introduce you What about the cop with him Hes part of the furniture He aint a cop in here Just the opposite Hes our safety guarantee This is Querelle my brother He has a deal for you Hes all right Hello Good evening Whats the deal Opium Five ks Ten thousand dollars You got it Cash Of course Querelle was frozen by Marios gaze More than indifferent Marios gaze and stance were glacial At the same time Querelle was struck by the owners extraordinary strength and the cops beauty Never before had he experienced true rivalry with which he had faced in these two Theres nothing fishy about this is there You dont have anything to worry about with me You bring the merchandise and you get the bread Okay buster And dont let Mario worry you Marios part of the furniture Querelle had no doubt that the realm over which this fellow ruled was a terrestrial one But was it possible the police could be so handsome so rich Lets have a drink When will you be here got to figure how m gonna get the stuff out but ll manage that dont want to get involved in no shit Dont wanna burn my fingers You want to dance with me Sure why not My names Lysiane own the place You dont say m Roberts brother know penny for your thoughts Querelle acknowledge the existence of authority in Mario note his objective gestures Objectivity is the companion of total power It holds sway over unchallengeable moral authority Its a perfect social organization You win get the feeling youre pissed off It isnt my fault my sister didnt show up You could have arranged for her to get here couldnt Gil swear it You know perfectly well how much like Paulette You like her eh And you think thats funny Roger Tell me if you think thats funny You know really want to make it with your sister Can you imagine how d fuck her if held her like m holding you now Youre Gil Gilbert Turko a Pole You havent been working too long as a mason and you often lose your temper She really turns me on Man would screw her You got the same chops You got the same eyes Pity youre not her What are you going to tell her ll do my best to get her to come tomorrow Querelle was not used to the idea that he was a monster Ayoung man he knew the terror of being alone caught in the world of the living Bravo Bravo You know for a little girl you sing that song just like a big boy Hurry up baby Go on after your girl Otherwise shes gonna drown herself Good to see you Why Got a job for you like the one back in Beirut Opium Right m going ashore tomorrow afternoon At night ll drop a rope over the wall to the dock to the right of the customs house At you take a boat tie the package to the rope then go back through customs Well meet later back above How much Three hundred Its okay with me Perhaps love is a den of killers and if this is true will Querelle draw me into it And When the time comes for me to drown in my emotion for Querelle will there be an alarm ringing for me Wed like you to perceive that the sailor Querelle born of that solitude in which the officer himself remained isolated was a figure comparable to the angel of the Apocalypse whose feet rest upon the waters How ardently desire Querelle to reveal himself as a scoundrel beneath that royal surface And then to lie at his feet to kiss his toes Little by little we realized that Querelle already inside our flesh was growing developing in our soul feeding off the best within us After discovering this about Querelle we want him to become the very hero of those who are contemptuous Your papers please Pursuing his destiny his development within us we shall see how he goes about realizing one single end which seems to be his own will and his own destiny The scene we shall relate is a transposition of the event which revealed Querelle to us We can say that it is comparable to the Visitation Okay you can go now My brother will take care of everything No need to worry about him Hes in Brest in the Feria In the Feria You got to be kidding They say the Ferias a pretty weird place You cant believe every line of bullshit you hear You know just as well as do what they say What of it Hes making it with the patronne That cop is covered with jewels ve got my jewels but dont show em off hear the boss is helping himself too So what if he digs it If he asked you would you do it with him Why not if felt like it ve done worse shit than that before If you saw my brother hed turn you on too Youd get together with him wouldnt dig it m telling you you would Want a smoke Nono would like you Youre a cute chicken He wouldnt have a chance with me And me Would have better luck with you Cut that shit out Querelle listened to the drums and pipes performing for him alone The offices for the dead He wrapped himself in prudence waited for the angel to strike In a very indistinct way Querelle sensed that everything was not finished He still had to accomplish the final formality his own execution Tell me what turns you on about Lysiane that makes you all excited Explain it to me Thats simple enough like her Okay you know the rules of the game If you win Lysiane is yours If win youre mine Twentynine Twentyfive You lose Death sentence What did you say

brother Look at Nono Sometimes theres something so female about him especially when he does one of those sweet silly gestures But this Querelle is an okay guy Hi Nono Lets go outside Is that what you wanted Cornholer Cornholer Letting a nigger fuck you The two brothers resembled each other more and more The combat in which they were engaged was more like a loversquarrel Say it one more time Call me a cornholer again Say it one more time wont say it cross the river of creeping vines Help me m coming to your shore That will be hard brother can feel your resistance What do you say can hardly hear it Jump on my laugh Hold tight to it Dont worry about my pain Jump Be yourself m becoming myself Talk more quietly m closer now love you more than myself My hate was simply a camouflage dangerous melancholy draws me close to you but my battles separate us My laughter is the sun It drives away the shadows you cast on me seek out the daggers of the night set up barricades My laughter locks me in It draws me away from you You are beautiful You are beautiful too Be quiet We mustnt lose ourselves in an all too perfect unity Set your hounds and wolves on me To what avail Every fight crowns you with a painful glow Dont lose courage Work love him The officers all bore me Why cant be a sailor remain standing in the wind Cold and headache clamp my forehead and crown me with an iron tiara am growing and melting naval officer When was a young man even when chose this career didnt realize what a perfect alibi a naval career provides It justifies celibacy Women dont ask Why arent you married They pity you for knowing only the transient affairs and never the true love The sea the solitude Nobody asks me whether or not m engaged Neither my comrades nor my mother From the time fell in love with Querelle ve become less of a disciplinarian My love makes me softer The more love Querelle the more gentle and definite the sadder the woman in myself becomes because she cannot achieve fulfillment During one of these strange revelations defining my relationship with Querelle think amidst all these sorrows and inner defeats Whats the point That sailor got his throat slit Yeah Nobody knows who killed him Did you know him Querelle Yeah We all know each other didnt know him well There is a masculine passivity which is expressed in the indifference towards courtship the completely relaxed anticipation of the body concerning his role in the taking or giving of passion Want to shoot dice orders pays and s gotta drink okay Want to play too Querelle Sure why not Stop the fighting Stop the fighting Between such men and for them alone a universe is established from which the idea of woman is banished The absence of woman forces the two males to draw a little femininity from within each other to invent the woman You know know Just ask him m okay You can ask anybody you want You know know Just ask him m okay You can ask anybody you want And you Youre in the navy ve met plenty of sailors who were into that That didnt stop them from being real men Maybe And if you let Nono fuck you why not me But you shouldnt believe everything you hear about Nono know all about life Believe me Okay did it with Nono But dont start getting any funny ideas m no fairy know that But Nono did the fucking right Right So Forget it You dont have to prove to me that youre a man We know were both men You went to bed with Nono and thats no crime Just as long as he took good care of you hope you got your share of the pleasure wont say no could do any guy a lot of good You see if its fun theres nothing wrong with it m sure Nono enjoyed it just as much Hes a pretty hot number And youre very pretty look just like the next guy Bullshit can just see Nono now He mustve had a hardon the first moment he saw you Tell me is he good at it Cut it Tell me is he a master of his craft Whats so interesting about it for you Gets you all excited doesnt it Maybe youd like a little taste of it yourself Why not if its nice Tell me how does he do it He does it well Are you satisfied now Did you come Was it super Try it yourself Tell me Is it nice Its not bad When he first puts it in thats a little painful then its okay Seriously is it nice just did it for the first time Its different than thought ll bet hes got a big prick Did you like his prick didnt pay any attention to that Well if its bugging you we can stop talking about it No its not bugging me When talk about this stuff get a mother of a hardon Believe me Youre kidding Dont you believe me What this gives you a hardon Check it out Come on Touch it Bullshit You havent got one Go on Touch it Youll feel it all right Nothing You call that a hardon Come on Press it Its a monster Sure the cloth makes it bigger Reach inside

thats what that is You need vegetables in soup but vegetables are getting harder and harder to find Maybe we have to tighten up our belts a little more Maybe we could find some vegetables around here somewhere Do you think so Maybe someone shoved some up his ass There are people who dig that Eat through their assholes You thought out this little number didnt you Theo Well let me tell you one thing m not going to put up with this shit much longer What are you talking about Gets you horny turns you on doesnt it But dont worry ll always be here when you need me You want to fuck me Dont be embarrassed Go ahead And you guys laugh You think its funny Is there anybody else who wants to fuck me Please Cut it out Gil Your hassle with Theos none of our business What ve got no hassle with Gil dont give a shit about him Not one little shit Why didnt smack Theo in the mouth right then and there Why didnt push that motherfuckers face in Just cause the guy keeps paying for my drinks hate him because he has power over me wanted to be his friend but not like that He made a fool of me in front of all of them And all because didnt smash him in the mouth soon enough Why didnt push that motherfuckers face in Paulette you sweet little piglet with that adorable pussy Youre going to get another taste of my rod m a man even fuck guys And fuck you too Theo Why didnt push that motherfuckers face in can put you away Theo Whenever feel like it Roger Hi Gil Roger Hi Gil Roger my mate lets have a drink together Hows it going Okay guess You dont have to worry about me There aint no Theo anymore You dont have to put me in the same boat as him m no faggot but he aint a man Hes a whore a cocksucker You and me were friends And weve got a right to be But hes just a dirty motherfucker think youve had a little bit too much to drink Dont get in a state paid for it with my own money He can take his money and shove it right up his ass tell you hes nothing and m going to crush him Hello Gil Its you Theo Are you buying m here with a friend Sure Why not honey And now youre not with us anymore How did you meet Gil How did you meet Gil Easy just like that He was after my sister Did he have an affair with your sister With Paulette No Why Because we found these pictures under his pillow ve nothing to say to that Did you make it with him Did you and he have an affair Never Inspector swear it And this Theo the one Gil murdered did you make it with him Jesus Christ only knew him from seeing him around But this Gil must surely have tried to seduce you No never Inspector Whatever gave you that idea Simply because Gil is gay Thats not true How could you be so goddamn sure Because he was after my sister thats why He never tried to touch you What do you mean touch me You know what mean Did he do anything indecent to you already told you nothing Did he ever run his hands over your pants Didnt he even try to touch your crotch No He never did Its like said He never touched me Okay They couldnt pull anything out of him who now loved Gil all the more At first he loved him as a child whose imagination is quick and exhilarating Crime enabled him to penetrate a world where feelings are violent You can go now What sudden desire am nothing but desire At first only mechanically my hands formed female breasts on my chest as if they had been grafted there was happy went through the motions again and feel happy am filled take my hands away am filled Are you looking for me Yes we are That is if youre Lieutenant Seblon Yes am We are from the police It has to do with that murdered sailor You mean Vic Thats what thought You dont say Yes were investigating this Vic Rivette case and so far we havent made much progress Really Yes But maybe you could tell me if this Vic Rivette had a special relationship with any of his mates How do you think a love relationship like that could be recognized didnt say anything about a love relationship No Then probably misunderstood you Probably but perhaps you know more about this Vics associations The physical relationships of my boys have nothing to do with me And even if someone had killed Vic in connection with one of these adventures wouldnt be informed Of course Lieutenant but it would be possible that you might have heard something about it wouldnt it You must be joking dont spy on my men Besides take it from me These young people when they get involved with shady individuals they certainly dont like to talk about it believe these meetings are enveloped in dark secrets These shady characters are extremely wellorganized You seem to have given this particular matter quite a bit of thought It only seems like it Basically m not at all interested in this kind of thing Really By the way has your alibi been checked out yet My alibi But of course You can check your files on that Are you sure All the best Lieutenant All the best Do have charms which might conquer another And who besides myself has been conquered by Querelles charms How could become him push up my pajama sleeves to keep them from getting in my way when jerk off This simple motion makes a man out of me Thus appear as a lion tamer before Querelle But all of this will end tragically Have the cops questioned you Yeah but didnt say a word What was there to say Right And Paulette Whats Paulette doing now Nothing special She still hasnt gone back to work She just sits around the house Did you talk to her about me dont think thats a good idea Its too dangerous Paulette cant always keep her trap shut Your picture was in the paper They say youve got that sailor on your conscience too Says who The police It was in the paper Bullshit They dont believe that fairy tale themselves They found your lighter next to the corpse My lighter God must have lost that ages ago didnt think so There you see Boy your sister Could do with a piece of her right now Shes so cute She looks like me know But shes prettier If were holding her like m holding you now d make out with her like crazy Too bad youre not a girl Really Youre definitely as pretty as a girl Whats the matter Scared No What then What do you think want You dont feel safe with a guy like me do you What do you mean If didnt wouldnt have come here would Right Youve got to see Robert ve been thinking this over He and his friends might be able to help me get out of here Okay Gil ll try to get in contact with Robert think its better you leave now Yes Come over here know you Youre that friend ofTurkos Gil Turko the one who committed the murder Dont you know me Yeah youre Querelle Roberts brother Right Thought might be able to help your friend if hes still in Brest What do you think Well since youre Roberts brother ll be right back An uneasiness filled Querelle troubling his mind For the first time he was going to meet another criminal a murderer of his own stature with whom he would be able to talk business met Querelle You know Roberts brother He wants to help you Should bring him here Sure Why didnt you bring him in the first place thought that Hurry up Get him Its okay Come with me Thanks kid My names Roger Roger Bataille Thanks Roger Roger Bataille Now in this abandoned prison Querelle was to meet a young fellow who had killed This thought filled him with tenderness The murderer was an awkward kid a murderer for nothing fool But thanks to Querelle he would be adorned with a true murder Tell me why did you knock that sailor off dont understand that Come on Tell me Why did you do that to the sailor He didnt do it If he didnt who did Word of honor didnt do it cant tell you who did it but swear it wasnt me The paper said you did it believe you but youll never convince the police They found your lighter next to the body Get out Roger Get lost cant stand another minute of you today Get the hell out lost my lighter didnt even notice it How can a lighter be so important Finally know why you wont let the other girls wear black lingerie Why Because you alone are ennobled by this black It makes you so beautiful gives you a solemn air and at the same time you are unbearably hot Do make you hot Want to see Okay get started Youre alone in the world The night lies over the solitude of an endless space Like a double mirror image of your brother you live in your double solitude You upset me Theres no reason to hide it Your similarity does me in m sick of your obscenities Right Your obscenities Dont you think know m sick of it All you ever look at is yourselves m not even there for you Who am then Where do fit in You only live in your brothers eyes Inside your brother and he lives inside of you Theres no room for me in between m at the door m too fat Thats it m too fat Her mind was clouded by the extreme precise indescribable melting of those two muscular sinewy bodies She tried to force the soft dissolving mass of her own sumptuous body between them Robert my hearts delight wish youd be alone with me once You make me unhappy m afraid for you Afraid you might not be free anymore When Madame Lysiane found herself before Querelle her gaze went to his fly in spite of herself Perhaps this evening the cloth would be less stiff would clearly outline his cock and balls allowing Madame Lysiane to note a difference between the two brothers She still hoped that the sailors cock would be smaller than Roberts Lysiane waited a long time for love Men never did get her all that excited It wasnt until she was around that she developed an appetite for men with hard muscles When she enjoyed happiness she started to get horribly jealous But she didnt admit it She loves your brother Robert is her man The first real one think But when they make love they make it like gays and Lysiane despises gays You love each other You love each other with your beauty cant break you up Youll always find your way back to each other You love your brother more than me No way can get around that Thats the kind of misery that can only happen to a woman my age always remained indifferent to the desires the others showed me but my mental chastity has built a field inside of me a field that can be easily sown with the seeds of the miraculous Having seen her that first day Querelle no longer thought of looking at Lysiane But bit by bit with her usual authority she imposed herself upon him and took possession of him Neither my brother nor is sufficiently in love with love to seek new experiences Nor do we need to satisfy some hygienic urge Nono sees in his game with Querelle an energetic somewhat boastful manifestation of a horniness which he believes to have discovered in Querelle Theres nothing more to it than there would be to an orgy in a monastery a bit of pleasant fun in which Nono is also indulging because of his powerful shoulders know m risking nothing because absolutely no emotion clouds the purity of my game No passion Its a game without weight Two men having the time of their lives by virtue of one of them without complication offering the other his ass Nono agreed to fuck Querelle more or less to be nice It doesnt seem to him that the sailor was in love with him but he needed that to continue living Because of Querelles strength Nono did not feel contempt for him You like fucking me dont you Why not It isnt bad If were to say felt for you that would be a lie ve never understood how anybody could fall in love with a man could never fall in love with a guy let myself get fucked cause like it Have you tried to fuck a guy Never Not the least bit interested either But you dont mind other guys fucking you Why not Like said its just for the fun of it Nono doesnt love me but feel more and more that something new is happening feeling binds me to Nono would never admit that Nono dominates me just because he fucks me But you cant keep playing the same game every day without subsequently giving in to it Beyond that theres Lysiane My friendship with you makes me happy For these reasons ve lost the desire to continue playing this game with Nono Gil felt a strange emotion when for the first time in his life Gil felt a strange emotion when for the first time in his life he saw his name in the headlines It was on the front page At first he thought the story was about someone else and at the same time about himself alone Nevertheless the judges will realize Realize what What judges Youre not thinking of giving yourself up now That would be really idiotic Youve been hiding out too long for them not to believe youre guilty His name exposed him and exposed him completely naked This was glory terrible to be ashamed of it of entering it through the door of contempt What have you got to lose If you steal something now it wont even go on your record Whats a robbery next to a murder There isnt much a sailor like me can do but ve done it looked for a likely safe place and ve found one Really If you had money you could buy some different clothes and get out of here safely Whats the plan My lieutenant has an appointment today He always has lots of cash on him And hows this supposed to come out Easy Easy On his way hell pass a pissoir he always uses He turns on to the dirty graffiti in there Change into these No one will ever suspect you What if he tries to fight me off mean He never fights Hes too chicken for that Hes just a big queen What if he does fight thought of that You have to think of everything Thats why brought this gun Only if push comes to shove You wont need it m sure of that That suit looks perfect on you You think so If say so m gonna give you a mustache Perfect Its the pissoir between the dock and the Catholic church Double brandy Hands up Whats all this about Shut up Just hand over your briefcase or ll shoot wouldnt do that if were you Shut up and dont move Give me your cash or ll blow a hole in your guts Go ahead Shoot Come on Shoot Come on Okay Almost Almost Whats that supposed to mean He didnt want to hand over the cash had to shoot And is he Just wounded him Hit him in the shoulder How much cash did he have Fifty thousand threw the briefcase in the sea Thats good Thats very good And now bought you a ticket to Bordeaux For when Today Already Today Every second you stay in Brest is dangerous Now youve got money You can take care of yourself Fifty thousand ought to do you for a while m so lucky you helped me out Querelle You know Forget it You still gotta be careful they dont catch you Can trust you to keep your trap shut if you do get nabbed Sure you can The cops will never get anything out of me never even heard of you Well better leave now Yeah guess you better Sorry about this old buddy Really liked you like you too But well meet again ll never forget you You say that now Life happens fast Youve already forgotten me No way pal Not at all m not that kind of guy Really You wont forget me If say wont you know wont Funny what good friends weve become We were friends right from the start hope nothing happens to you Querelles friendship for Gil developed to the brink of love Like himself Gil had killed He was a little Querelle for whom Querelle maintained a strange feeling of respect and curiosity As though he was standing before the fetus of a baby Querelle He wanted to make love to him because he believed his tenderness would be strengthened by it Because he would be more closely linked to Gil whom he would then link more closely to himself But he didnt know how to go about it since he having always been fucked didnt know how to fuck a guy gesture would have embarrassed him Youre sweet you know that Why You let me kiss you like this without complaining about it Why should told you you are my friend This isnt bothering you is it No Youve got to be my very special friend forever Do you understand Yes And will you Yes In some obscure way Querelle understood that love is voluntary You have to want it When you dont love men letting yourself get fucked can give you pleasure but to fuck men you have to love them even if only at the moment youre fucking So if he was to love Gil he would have to give up his passivity Querelle tried My friend What a shame we cant stay together forever But well meet again To be together like here d like that The vision of the solitude in which their love had developed increased his love for Gil And he felt to be everything for him his one friend his one family never loved a boy before Youre the first one Truly Truly Gil had finally resigned himself to the other crime Little by little he assumed responsibility for the sailors murder Hi You want something from me Depends On what On you ve got a tip for Mario But youve got to promise me you wont tell anybody where it came from Nobody Never Is that clear promise you Thats all can say Thatll do You can tell Mario that this Polack this Gil Turko will be on the train that leaves for Bordeaux at Ciao But loved by Querelle would be loved by every sailor in France because Querelle is a compendium of all their masculine and naive virtues If desire authority this admirable form which evokes love and fear then must awaken a feeling for this authority in the heart of the sailors They ought to love me want to be their father and injure them shall mark them They will hate me In the face of their misery shall remain unmoved More and more the feeling of perfect power will fill my being Having conquered my compassion shall be strong and sad when regard my pathetic disguise know that will never leave Querelle My whole life will be dedicated to him Good morning When suffer can not believe in God In pain all can count on is myself in the misfortune for which have someone else to thank always knew you were a murderer Come on Stab me We haveJesus to thank that we are able to glorify humility for He made it the sign of the divine The godhead in our innermost depths For why should we renounce the violence of this world If this Godhead is to confront violence then it must be strong if it is to achieve the victory And humility can only be born of humiliation Otherwise it is nothing but vanity Put away your knife Good morning Lieutenant Good morning What can do for you Would you be good enough to come with me to the police station Certainly For what reason want you to look at a suspect It concerns the robbery You have a suspect then do you We have Is that a fact Then ll be glad to come along with you Lets go Querelle was now Lysianes lover The excitement she felt thinking about the identity of the two brothers exasperated her to such a degree that she felt lost What did you hope to achieve by attacking your fellow worker Theo Celine wanted to kill him You did So you already thought of killing him when you broke the bottle with which you mortally wounded him Yes wanted to kill him So before you hit him it was clear that you might kill him with the bottle Absolutely Inspector wanted to kill him Why did you want to do that He hurt my honor and my soul How did he do that He made fun of me in front of everybody including myself And that was reason enough for you to kill a man Can one man do anything worse to another than hurting his honor Well suppose there are some differences of opinion on that subject repeat once again you killed the sailor Vic Rivette to rob him of his money and you killed Theo Celine because he hurt your honor Is that correct Yes Thats correct And the robbery of Naval Lieutenant Seblon Its exactly as told you had nothing to do with that one Youre sticking to your story on that Fine Marcellin Yes Inspector Well Lieutenant here he is Do you recognize him You take off your hat And get up No its not him m sorry Lieutenant must ask you to think this one over very carefully Maybe you do remember this young man dont understand what youre getting at m concerned with justice too cant accuse an innocent man Are you absolutely certain Absolutely would have recognized him right away because his face was right next to mine Lieutenant you may go now You havent even got a decent hardon It doesnt stay up forever Buy yourself a rubber one You know ve dreamt a lot about your prick lately Yeah Was it nicer in your dreams No m very satisfied You have a solid heavy massive prick Not elegant but strong And so different from Roberts Different how Your prick has more character Why did you refuse me for so long didnt refuse you Its just that you were my brothers woman And now Now m getting revenge on my brother So thats the reason And me And me You Youre just a woman Each man kills the thing he loves Some do it with a bitter look Some with a flattering word The coward does it with a kiss Careful Querelle If you lose your footing you can sometimes fall very far Thanks Inspector How about it Throw dice with me No ll never throw dice with you again Give me a double scotch They even have to get drunk on the same day The Holy Brothers said a double Some kill their love when they are young And some when they are old Some strangle with the hands of lust Some with the hands of gold Where are you going Thats nobodys business Do you hear me Hey you wanna get fucked Come on baby You wanna get fucked by me There Motherfucker Hitting a defenseless girl If you were a real man Watch out guys hes got a knife Dont be crazy This is pure madness dont want you to get involved in this kind of business Put away your knife Come on Come with me Youre a pal All the others are assholes but youre a pal Whatever you want from me its yours Be quiet If an officer were to come along dont give a fuck As far as m concerned youre all there is Stop yelling Youre going to wind up in the brig d be very sad if you went to prison Really Youre just saying that Youre an officer What do you care You know perfectly well it isnt so m on the brink of a shame from which no man ever rises But only in that shame will find my everlasting peace am so weak ve been conquered Totally conquered And my thoughts are sad have feelings of autumn soilings fine mortal wounds in me will never find peace until you take me It must be done so that afterwards can lie across your thighs like a Piet cradling
