To my friend Thanos Ari Onassis Well Lets see When the first symptoms appeared both in body and mind my mother took me to the best pediatrician of Athens Again He used to know Greek mythology inside out But now he gets confused and mixes things up When did it happen few days ago all of a sudden While he was listening at the radio his breath started to get heavier He said something weird He asked whether the Trojan Horse was a mare or a stallion Did he use this word What did he want to know He mixes mythology with the news Doctor He asked me how the Greek Allies got out from the Trojan Horse Whether it had an emergency exit a latch or a lock And he fell into depression What made you sad Stavros Now listen ll ask you to tell us a story so that we see whether you know it or not ok Stavros Hey Stavros The Professor is talking to you my son Tell us how we won the Trojan War We lost the Trojan War Who told you that No one thought it by myself And Hercules didnt perform any labor The snakes ate him up in his cradle when he was a baby You see Doctor With this nonsense his friends dont play with him anymore He gives them nicknames of villains and they get angry Such as Cyclops Polyphemus Procrustes Pinebender You see When Theodore had the same symptoms his family put the blame on me Hello Mrs Tzevoula How are you Theodore Your son is making fun of my nephew He has really upset us He told me a wild story What story He said that the Minotaur grabbed Theseus and pulled his hair out one by one and then ate him Is that what he said The Minotaur devoured Theseus With all this nonsense the kid gets upset and has bad dreams And in the morning there is hair all over the sheets Can say the other one too Say it He told me that Ulysses didnt go back to his wife and son He became a pirate sailing in rough seas along with the Cyclops He gets up at night all nauseous Ulysses along with the Cyclops in the rough seas Stavros when did you make up all this stuff started

first great love Her Majesty the Queen Anne Marie of Greece visited the town of Thessaloniki for the National Day celebration where she laid a foundation stone for the construction of a house As soon as saw her that tantalizing yet sweet force arose between my legs turning things upside down We became inseparable ever since The News on the radio would talk about her all the time taking on mythical proportions in my mind When playing tag was helping the Allies to chase Prince Paris When playing hide andseek d live the adventures of Ulysses was challenging the mistresses of gods while the South Wind was pushing us into the Queens cove where she was waiting for us wet and dampened by the hot breeze Until the day the bad news broke After the fruitless countercoup against the Revolutionary Government and after wandering from village to village the Royal Couple ended up in Rome seeking political asylum When heard that the Greek Army instead of bringing back Helen of Troy banned the Queen from Greece killed all the mythical heroes known to everyone around me You can put on your clothes Stavros What has come upon us Professor Is it serious Its nothing Children often make up stories They

back again to the dark places Years went by and was jumping to the other side of the screen so could live the new myths while life was creating its own myths in the sidewalks of Athens Bread education freedom when Mr Konstantinos Karamanlis came back to Greece from exile to assume the government of the country Politicians were promising a bright future for our country while some other people were worrying about my own future He became a communist Winter He comes home late he stays up all night writing weird stuff And where does he go To the movies Where else He spends all his time in the dark like rats do Does he have any friends Of course he has Some longhaired and bearded men He brings them home and they force us to buy their newspapers We want to change the world they say They lock

to say to women so that they shine on the film Please stay still and hold your breath Dont move and dont talk until tell you Ready Youll become very popular Youll be adored by more men than the ones you adored And your dancing will be way more famous than Salomes Reed Insurgent Mexico As soon as we closed the studio d hurry to the movie theater to see Stelios and Alice a couple of progressive intellectuals had met in the lobby of the theater The western films are just an allegory of the Odyssey Their heroes wander in the Wild West in a symbolic journey What do the cowboys have to do with Ulysses Just like Ulysses in the oceans The director uses the wide angle Come on now with the wide angle For the villains he uses a tight lens All these directors were cogs of a reactionary production system They were oppressed intellectuals using allegories You underestimate the producers part in it The Capital imposed on the directors what to shoot They had no choice No The directors had the final word on what lenses theyd use Godard said that the cameras position is a question of morality Their arguments taught me that the old myths could be seen from a different angle admired Stelios and Alice because they could analyze the film without seeing the whole of it And when it was my turn to show what was worth tried hard to impress them He wanders in the Amazon jungle and suddenly he discovers a tribe in a clearing where children see things with a quite different perspective Where do you see these films In Alcyonis Movie Theater The Third World Cinema Till the age of eighteen they see things completely flat Then they learn to see like grownups in three dimensions Quite a reactionary point of view How come The revisionists say such things to their silly bimbos And then wed end up in the tavern of Alices uncle a meeting place for intellectuals and aspiring politicians where she was waiting tables for some extra money Baked beans cod with garlic dip tomato spaghetti or bolognese Mixed grill goat stew and tripe soup How many tripe soups Two From yesterday An exciting new world They were talking about old myths with a new language always ready and willing for a profound analysis would easily appear in the nude if the role required it Stanislavski said that its easier to show a naked body than a naked look in the eyes For the first you have to wear some cloths For the second you have to travel back and dig deep into your past Cheers Cheers guys To the good things to come Who is that Efstathiou a socialist The presidents sidekick Hell go places Fill

rehearsal tomorrow What is the actors task To dig up inside him trigger all the secret and dark emotions he or she had in the past and transfer them to the role Its only then that we have what we call truth Pravda When the actors past meets the roles past and the audiences present Shall we do it again Oh wretched fruit of a womb enslaved to the vain human nature Hi there Hi Stelios Everything good Were getting ready Hello how are you doing Good Vangelis Makis and Stavros Were making our first short film with Makis Hes in charge Stavros wants to join the team An accomplished photographer He also writes very well and plays the guitar Welcome Welcome And stay with us Well read the script Since you write wed like to hear you opinion Lets go What is it about Astudent from a small town wanders in modern Athens facing the cruel reality Our hero realizes that a monster is stalking everywhere Now Greece except the Americans has new allies the Europeans who also threaten our national sovereignty and independence while people around him search for new myths and heroes Well First scene Establishing shots of Athens in the preelection period We follow the hero with a wide angle as he wanders in streets heavily guarded by the police Myths everywhere On the screen on the stage in the books as well as in the stories we wanted to tell But the way they ought to be told had to be approved by the majority Again with a wide angle lens Shes waiting for him in some beach of the island staring at the horizon full of hope Objection Comrade Stelios has an objection Dont forget that the wide angle is the bourgeoisies favorite lens It creates the illusion that everything belongs to everybody And that everything can be gained think wed better use a telephoto lens as a master lens Objection m talking Telephoto lens forces us to segment reality into various different angles It disorients the audience and doesnt let them see the general idea we want to show suggest we vote on it Comrades thank you Well lets vote on it Who are for the use of telephoto lens as a master lens Four Who are for the use of wide angle lens as a master lens The use of wide angle lens as our master lens is approved Write it down We can go on now comrades Lets hear Stavros our new member The hero faces the monster you said Shall we show the monster The monster comrade is the bureaucracy the isolation the food in the Student Club the constant police surveillance Its a symbol The whole story seemed symbolic to me Athens is a symbolic city a labyrinth hiding the monstrous Minotaur or a Troy where the Allies are stalking into the Trojan Horse and an Ulysses trying to save his home from the suitors of power My old craft came in handy at last When you rely on myths acceptance is guaranteed Who are for comrade Stavros symbols And unanimous We unanimously approve the lliad the Odyssey and Theseus against the Minotaur We come to the roles now Who is going to play Penelope Any nude scenes Only the last one with you walking on the beach Shall show my panties Only your thighs Youll wear a short tunic Its a symbolic scene Penelope waiting for Ulysses Saying what Its mute scene You stare at the horizon and Wide Angle as a master follows you wont show my thighs to strangers Strangers But you know them all And whos this Master Its a lens not a man So why do you call him Master Its our jargon So says the script Wide Angle as a master catches Penelope and a seagull disappearing far away Whats disappearing Aseagull Shall show my face No just your thighs Just my thighs wont waste my thighs for a seagull

to work on that role The trip to Cuba is a life decision for me America can wait She said you should wait for her here Once more in the history of world art Oedipus found himself in the arms of his mother who could be his daughter in real life But she was my girlfriend too as always Oh wretched fruit of a womb enslaved to the vain human nature You never found out about the secret that the fate hid from you And madly you loved the fruit of your own root Well split in small groups well be filming like guerillas and well beat it because the streets will be full of cops What if they chase us away Therell be other film crews covering the demonstration We are in preelection period They wouldnt try any rough stuff on us Welcome Hi Well set the Trojan Horse on the Attica Hill Stavros you and will be the Allies soldiers that threaten our country Cheers When lose something love lose the ground under my feet And everything turns upside down So the Trojan Horse was a mare or a stallion Does it matter Of course it does Those inside where did they come out from Where was the door Was there an emergency exit Cant answer that comrade Suppose that someone decided to jump out How could he do that Suppose he wanted to tell the secret to the enemy and change the course of the war The script says different The Allies soldiers should join the Trojans and celebrate with them They realize who wants them to be heroes and they ignore them The soldiers The Allies Hes right Inside the Horse they discuss what theyve been through all these years and realize who they are and what they are about to do We are making a simple film so people can understand our message The world changes if we change the stories that support it Thats how the great change begins in their lives The heroes become allies with the enemy Theseus sides with the Minotaur Ulysses sides with Polyphemus They must join the Trojans agree Its a subversive idea agree too Me too Your friend is quite right couldnt have put it better myself If we want a real Change we must abolish the old world in the minds of people But that takes hard work We must change all the stereotypes we have concerning our past You are the ones who can do it The young people With the power of the image Excuse me Come in finished You were incredible cant agree more with what you said Efstathiou was writing it down You speak beautifully Lets leave Alice Lets go find new places All this time Stop it Youve gone crazy What are you saying keep thinking of you and want us to leave Lets go together escape How was the rehearsal Stavros Amess found Betty in Andreis arms And you want another mess here Betty never hid how she wants to live have to go back Just a minute Come in Good evening How was the shooting Telephoto lens Careful Its a rare lens Costs a fortune Not that way You wont see anything that way Its a dangerous lens Dangerous Why It shows things you cant see with a naked eye Unseen truths Youll waste many rolls of film before you see something you like But this one here No matter where you look at it sees beauty in everything The wide angle lens fools everyone At your age they all shoot with this Does age have to do with the lens Of course it does Look how beautiful things seemed when was young shot this when was your age And this And this And here m getting a bit older was about thirty When youre young life is beautiful you keep on shooting And you dont care if the light goes and you have to stop But afterwards you see that theres something missing Whats missing The subject You have no subject In this picture theres nothing you want to see over and over again And one day quite unexpectedly the landscape changes because it hides the subject The frame changes and your life as well And then you have to change the lens You want to go closer to explore the hidden beauty Eyes lips The poses where she smiles Even the whisper if possible And then quite unexpectedly again the subject vanishes from the frame and from the life itself When was the last time you took a picture out of your shop Watch it knew about the bags but not The day opened the shop couldnt wait to see my first client getting in was waiting to see artists actors Waiting for hours for someone to start with The first one to come was your dad holding a suitcase And he asked me to photograph it Asuitcase My first client was a suitcase wanted to send him away but then thought it was bad luck to send away your first client He brought me luck after all And we became good friends And then invented the story with After all my dads suitcases were not empty and not cheap too The words that filled them before they left the window were my own precious heritage What are you doing here Hello Hi Sorry What for For the kiss and the trip The kiss and the trip You are a poet You are all funny You leave as men and you come back as little boys Stelios will Forget about him He dwells in his lair and we come in and out If he let us When is a kiss worthy Before or after the trip Both before and after took you with me secretly Where We slept in each others arms on a bench in the Paris airport We took off at daybreak and twelve hours later we landed in Havana We stayed with friends for three days cutting sugarcanes Then we went to Mexico We strolled in the beach And we went to Santiago Sleepless There we parted for two days like a couple of wanted outlaws We got together again in Valparaiso And then Nicaragua Bogota Montevideo You were bitten by mosquitoes And asked the guerillas if they had some repellent Then with a rowboat in the Amazon And you wanted to meet the kids who see only one dimension And now what What have we brought back from such a trip So we can tell about it in the years to come To enchant them all Men women our children This for the takeoff For Mexico Valparaiso Bogota The Amazon Is your camera loaded Always Dont forget comrade The cameras position is a question of morality Now where are we flying to Ladies and gentlemen The sign fasten your seat belts and no smoking is on We started our descent to the Athens airport You in the tavern and me in the darkroom But now we have the journey want to see them when you develop them ll bring them to you tomorrow at the tavern As of tomorrow no more tavern Quiet comrades Lets vote now Who are for the Allies leaving the Horse and joining the Trojans Stavros idea is approved unanimously Write it down Well who is the monster Bureaucracy isolation The food in the Student Club Why Whats wrong with the food in the Student Club eat there and although have a weak stomach it didnt hurt me at all The food in the Student Club is excellent Sir Well what happens in the end Stavros Some of those in the Trojan Horse think of the hardship Interesting And then They decide to join the enemies They warn them revealing the secret of the Trojan Horse At reason If this happens ten years of hard work will be wasted Whats the reason for a war Whats the message you convey to people That the conciliation of peoples will abolish the wars Sir Young men If the Greeks tell the secret to the Trojans you wont have a story to tell your children Ulysses did not invent the Trojan Horse in order to win the war Homer invented it so we can have stories to tell The fall of Troy The journey to Ithaca We see the myths differently Sir What if Ulysses discovered that his wife was cheating on him and decided to ravage everything he would find in his way see where you are getting at As a student in Paris did my thesis on the myth of Atlas was fascinated by the idea that everything around us is nothing but a burden on someones shoulders We see it differently What would have happened if the Earth fell off Atlas shoulders Suppose he hurt his

friends only saw a few of them in festive days saw Alice the night the Socialists came into power strolling along the alleys of her own myths Change has won November few years later saw Betty who cutting short a rehearsal climbed on a wall that would come tumbling down And when the time came to change the lens saw things couldnt see with a naked eye Now had my own story too Of course tamper

What a great thing to say
