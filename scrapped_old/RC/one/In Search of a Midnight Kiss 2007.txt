Paradise with You by Hot Club of Downtown man The midnight kiss Its not just another kiss Its all the hope of romance of the year culminating in just one moment And that overhyped kiss in which there is so much calling texting Ming planning hurrying drinking to make happen is all set at a moment when time itself takes center stage when you can feel the weight of the year to come mixed with the loneliness and missed opportunities of the years gone by For years used to work at a video store and on New Years would always deal with what thought were my people those brokenhearted souls that hated the whole pageantry of the night the ones who wanted to quietly and privately wallow in selfpity getting drunk on the fictional romance and heartbreak of others That was me the lonely hunkereddown type waiting for the night to blow over But some times are so low you can no longer follow that routine anymore Paradise with You by Hot Club of Downtown continues grunting Oh jeez m
