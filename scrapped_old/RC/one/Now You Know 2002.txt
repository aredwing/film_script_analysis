the end of the year Out of the closet am not gay Yeah m just saying that the homosexual lifestyle in theory is ideal Uhhuh Youre gay Scoffs You know what m saying No dont m just saying guys and girls are just two different animals Cats and dogs if you will Guys are like the dogs not too bright they like to take rides in cars and they hump anyones leg two seconds after they meet them Accurate For arguments sake okay All right Now girls are like the cats a little mysterious kind of standoffish It takes a long time to win em over right But once you do win em over theyre all rubbing on your leg and purring they love you and shit Now do cats love dogs For the most part no Why Because theyre two different animals Its unnatural Thats not to say there arent cats and dogs that do get along But that takes special circumstances They need to be raised together One of them needs to be blind or something fucked up Now do dogs like dogs They sure do Two dogs meet two minutes later theyre going at it wherever they are Why Because theyre the same animal They already know what each other wants Theres no games Guys all know what other guys want sex Thats it No romance no long strolls on the beach Just straightup nasty sex You guys follow this Allow me macho man Thank you Thank you very much Fruitcake cant believe left a gay guy in charge of the bachelor party am not gay just know what works

each others clothes You wouldnt have to buy that fatfree shit at the supermarket It just works man Are you done Thered be no more laboring over fancy pickup lines Its just Hi m Biscuit Wanna fuck Will you For Christ sakes man Once you guys come out of the closet its gay this and gay that Where the hell is Jeremy At least hes getting married dont have to worry about him turning gay on me Aha m glad you brought up getting married Oh believe weddings are the only reason girls and guys are together Weddings a strictly female thing Guys could give a shit about a wedding or if they ever get married Thats why girls marry guys so they can be the center of attention If girls were to marry girls theyd have to share the spotlight And theyre not about to do that So they marry guys Do you think Jeremy knows anything about his wedding No He could care less ll bet Can buy you two drunks a beer Gil Hey Biscuit Hey man You guys havent left these stools since left you last huh Yeah we like it here Whats going on You just missed it Biscuit just came out of the closet Really Did you pay Al had to am not gay Jeremy what color are the bridesmaid dresses dont know See he could give a shit Uhhuh Jeremy how

talk about the wedding know you guys tried to tell me it was a mistake Gil Oh knew this was gonna come up sooner or later Jer Biscuit and were just being selfish You know we wanted you to stay one of the guys Since you and Kerri went away to school together and stuck it out and made a life for yourselves mean we couldnt be happier for you Kerri is a beautiful gorgeous girl and quite frankly m a little jealous Me too Et tu Biscuit mean Kerris a great catch Shes smart shes funny shes beautiful What more could a man ask for Sighs know we should have said this to you sooner but you guys live in Vegas Its not like we see you a lot cant believe you guys want me to get married Yeah of course we do man Kerri and broke up The weddings off Really Yeah really Were not getting married Thats fuckin great No man should ever get married Really This Its off Yeah its off Ladies and gentlemen we have a stay of execution Thank you Governor Close call You guys are happy about this Of course were happy wouldnt wish marriage on my worst enemy What about all that youre lucky stuff and m jealous shit Dude it almost killed me to say that shit to you But we thought this is what you wanted so we should encourage you Biscuit and practiced all day yesterday We were pretty good huh Yeah So whyd you dump her Because she was smothering the shit out of him Biscuit Either that or you hooked up with one of them Vegas showgirls right Ooh forgot about the showgirls Chuckles Actually she sort of called off the wedding She called it off Why Because she found someone new asshole Whos better than Jeremy Come on dont know Somebody with a better future more money better looks Bigger dick Ooh Hey come on got a big dick Uhhuh So whyd she do it then dont know She said she just wasnt happy Together Small dick Hey will you guys shut up please Can we drop it All right look Were sorry Who cares why she did it Lets just be happy she did Yeah You uh need another beer little man Chuckles Are you sure Marty please of course m sure Who have been spilling my guts to all week long anyway Me but was sure that when got you home youd tell me all about your new man with the big prick Sorry to disappoint you but this certainly isnt about anybody with a big prick That tells us a little bit about Jeremy and that alone is grounds for calling off the wedding Oh God wish it was that easy Then at least people would understand Kerri people do understand Theyre just in shock Even was a little surprised when you called off the wedding When you first told me about it just thought you had cold feet Yeah thought so too Thats why it went on for so long Knocking Come in Boy Hey Marty Mom wants to know if you can eat over Oh thanks stud but dont think so havent been feeling so good lately Shut up Tell Mom she will Cliff Make sure m sitting next to you Absolutely Door Closes What do you think would happen if just grabbed his little pecker underneath the table He would probably combust Yeah So anyway just dont see anything wrong with not wanting to marry a guy whos not in love with me anymore want somebody who after years still looks at me like hes lucky to have me God Marty thought you out of all people in the world would understand that But it sounds like you think made a mistake too dont think you made a mistake m just saying that sometimes it might be nice to have someone who Marty you dont even understand Youve never been in a relationship for more than a month You dont know what its like to date a guy who treats you more like a sister than a lover You break off every relationship before it even gets to that Marty no really dont think anythings wrong with that actually think all women should break up with guys after two months to avoid having to feel the way did with Jeremy When things started cooling down felt like it was my fault like wasnt attractive enough like wasnt good enough know m not but anyway really didnt mean it as a putdown No know you didnt Listen if thought you were putting me down d kick your ass So whats wrong m pregnant Are you sure Do you know whose it is Of course know whose it is Just because ve been out with a lot of guys doesnt mean ve slept with them all Can ask You dont know him Hes just some guy Did you tell him No dont even know what m gonna do yet Oh God Marty m so sorry Here am going on and on about myself No its fine really mean it helped me get

what happened Arent you a little curious really didnt wanna get into this with you just wanted to buy you a drink Hows a man just walk away from the woman he loves and just shrug it off m not Theres a lot more to it that dont care to get into right now dont understand mean you say that you love this woman And you must because you asked her to marry you but then when things get a little strained you just walk away What the fuck is that You Wait Maybe just got cold feet all right Maybe wasnt sure was ready to get married yet But apparently she wasnt either because she was the one that called it off Oh well how convenient for you She was probably just scared or nervous and needed a little bit of reassurance from you bet she would have loved to have known you were having doubts and were nervous too so that you guys could overcome them together or at least try But You did not love this girl Now wait a minute did Yes did love still do What is with you should have sent Biscuit over here Youre right up his alley just wanted to buy you a drink and then tell my friends you were married so they wouldnt bother you was helping you out believe it or not So just You know what Good night Can still have that drink ThatThat was the original plan right Uh Yeah yeah guess could use one anyway Tim Whatll it be Alabama slammer and a shot of tequila Uh yeah two of those You are full of surprises never would have guessed that would be your order Oh Anything you wanna talk about No just like to have fun thats all This seems to help Well here is to fun Woman No You asshole What the fuck did you

friends Lea come on No wanna stay Come on wanna stay Fuck guess were not gonna hook up tonight huh hope Kerris better at the single life than he is think you chipped a tooth Disco Hey How you doing Good How are you Marty please can we go home You said you wanted to get a couple of drinks Come on Can we just get them somewhere else You also said you wanted to go somewhere where we wouldnt see Jeremy And can guarantee you we wont see Jeremy here Although knowing his friends you never know What are you looking at Shes with me Oh my God Come on Relax really think youre gonna like it here You can just kick back and be yourself and have a couple of drinks and not feel like a piece of meat mean for the most part people are really respectful when they see that youre with someone Do you come here a lot Well not a lot but ve been here a couple of times yeah Is this where you met the father Who do you think am Madonna Chuckles No dont think any of the men here would be interested in making babies with me just figured given our two situations this would be a pretty cool place to hang out Besides you know what Being a lesbian is considered very chic nowadays When word gets out you were here youre gonna be beating men off with a hammer Word gets out dont want anybody to know What if Jeremy finds out Hes gonna think that left him because m a lesbian Dont worry mean no offense Ker but Jeremy doesnt exactly hang out with people high on the social ladder Do you think Muffin knows anything about girls at all guess you have a point just dont want Jeremy thinking he somehow turned me off to men you know Like If she cant have me she might as well go lesbian you know Okay stop You are not a lesbian We are just out for a couple of drinks and some pleasant conversation Thats all okay Okay Okay This kid is doing the jig on my bladder gotta go pee Go up to the bar and get us drinks ll have a Shirley Temple with a cherry think m gonna come with you to the ladies room Gee youre really getting into the swing of this place arent you Okay dont touch anything So you think theyll get back together Sighs dont know man mean part of me wants em to but part of me doesnt What do you mean Well Listen know shes out of my league Its just shes my dream girl like knowing that shes available dont know Maybe someday well bump into each other and therell be a spark and ll get to have her On the other hand if they did get back together they might whip out the old video camera and start taping some kinky sex And then d be able to enjoy her at least through that again What are you talkin about Pamela and Tommy Lee What are you talkin about Kerri and Jeremy ass head Oh them dont know Jesus He cant even figure out why they broke up Scoffs Well thats obvious She cheated on him She did How do you know that Gil Well think about it These two have been together since high school They went away to college together They were living together They were probably taking shits with the bathroom door open Chuckles Thats already married in my book You expect me to believe she just flipped out one day and called it quits without so much as an explanation think not When you catch somebody cheating on somebody its the only time an explanation is just not necessary Jesus youre right Mmhmm ll bet it was a magician Why a magician Cause thats all they have in Vegas Magicians pit bosses and those guys that pass out the dirty fliers Now Jeremys probably better than the flier guys and Nah dont see her with a pit boss So it had to have been a magician Hmm And thats why he doesnt wanna talk about it with us because hes embarrassed Jesus Christ No the reason dont wanna talk about it with you guys is because dont wanna hear any of your screwy theories What screwy theories How about the one where Kerris screwing Siegfried and Roy No man dont think it was them They might be gay Chuckles love the way you guys talk about me like m not even here Feel free to take part in the conversation dont wanna take part in it Then what are you complaining about just wanna have a good time Is this your idea of fun Sitting around theorizing about Kerri and Chuckles No man Hes right Lets do it dude Okay suppose its late enough Did you bring your hat and gloves Yes Well put em on Right What the fuck is that What Mittens What you think were gonna make a snowman have no idea You told me to get gloves and a hat didnt know you wanted an Disguise What are we gonna whack somebody No were just gonna do a little thats all What What are you guys robbing peoples houses for little extra Were not robbing peoples houses Were just gonna go in and rearrange things a little Rearrange things Why Because its funny Imagine you wake up and your living room is in your dining room Or every single light bulb in your house is unscrewed and lying on the floor for no reason Thats fuckin funny And you dont take anything Not a thing So what about the ex extra Thats just a little bonus You remember Chris Newman Yeah Well he took over his dads business Right Newman Home Security Oh Yeah Still dont get it Sighs We live in the burbs Not the best place for a home security business When Chris took over his dads company it was headed down the tubes So he asked Biscuit and to scare up a little business for him We may be a lot of things but we are not thieves So we thought of this little plan We get a few kicks we help Chris out a little bit and its kind of thrilling being in peoples houses What if you get caught Oh no man you cant get caught Sure you can No you cant get caught Dont get caught Oh So are you in Am in Sure ve been making some pretty stellar decisions lately m sure this will be another one Cool Lets go Disco Women Laughing Man Does he have both testicles Well that is until Marty saw him Man Oh Is his penis super glued to his stomach so when he has to piss he has to stand on his head All Laughing No Then you shouldnt be upset Sounds to me like you had a pretty reasonable breakup Its not the breakup that m so upset about dont know if it was the right thing to do You know mean felt had to do it at the time but now just dont know Well look mean you obviously had planned on marrying this guy Everything was done and ready But in your heart something inside told you not to To stop right Yeah well l dont know Its weird because Jeremy all in all is a pretty good guy You know hes Hes not mean People like him And he didnt cheat on me He never brought you flowers He never did anything romantic for you And he always put everything else before you m right arent Hey look know exactly what youre going through Well didnt always live my life as a gay woman Before met Shelly here was married was married for years to this man who much like Jeremy was a pretty good guy But then about the third year of our marriage everything changed Uhhuh Well we were still in love but it just wasnt the same He slipped into like this comfortable place you know where he didnt think that he needed to woo me anymore And sex as infrequent as it was was boring and predictable swear think guys have some sort of builtin timer Uhhuh Apparently everyone thinks this because asked all my married friends at the time you know Was this normal And they said Yeah it was Yeah Thats why my marriage lasted years So what either have to accept this fact about men or become a lesbian All Laughing No No You just need to find someone who will love you the way you wanna be loved You know in my case its just that person happened to be a woman And for you it could be anybody

at first And when we were sitting on the couch and asked you if you wanted to call off the wedding thought was being pretty ridiculous too But imagine my surprise when you answered back Why Is that what you want Those are the words of a guy who couldnt give a shit And you further proved that and blew me away when you moved out without a care in the world You keep saying that m the one that broke off the wedding We both know thats not true m just the first one who said it out loud Well its just uh Just say it Jeremy You cant hurt me anymore was just scared Scared of what Scared of marrying you Scared of being married Weve been together a long time Kerri since we were kids Weve missed out on a lot When get married m only gonna do it once Its forever dont want you or me five or years from now to wonder if there was something better out there never wondered Jeremy Neither did just thought that maybe we werent ready to get married and you felt it too thought after we called off the wedding everything would go back to the way it was Oh So we were just supposed to pretend that nothing happened So get it Youre not cold and callous Youre just stupid never intended to lose you Kerri Youve gotta believe that Do you have Do you have any idea what you put me through Why couldnt you just share your big idea with me Instead you acted indifferent through the whole thing and made me feel like was living in some fucking dream world m so sorry Ker m so sorry Please give me another chance ve given you chances Jeremy And if youre asking me for another one the answers no Because you lost me long before you called off the wedding What are you talking about Sighs When was the last time you bought me flowers or or sent me a love note or said love you before did Jesus just because didnt do those things doesnt mean dont love you You know love you know Jeremy But just because you send someone flowers or a little note doesnt mean you love them But its those things combined with everything else that reassures a person just needed to be reassured Kerri my God if knew would lose you by not doing those things would buy you flowers every day will do whatever it takes to show you love you not just today or tomorrow but every day would marry you right now if even thought for a second you would have me swear would And dont expect you to take me back but please let me try and prove myself
