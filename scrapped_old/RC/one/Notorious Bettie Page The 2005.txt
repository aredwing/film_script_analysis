difficulties you mentioned had a letter from the postal inspector warning me about sending some of my pictures through the mail What do you know about getting around that The only court ruling that know of on that issue is the case of this fellow Al Urban The post office tried to prevent him from sending photographs of nude men through the mail They got the Civil Liberties Union involved And the Chicago court eventually ruled that the materials were not obscene We dont even have nudes He just had to be careful he was only sending his stuff to adults Tell me what do you think of all this tyingup business You seem to have a knack for posing And m always on the lookout for comely wenches who dont mind a bit of the old rope and gag Well it certainly was different liked what you did with

What say we give this charming creature a role in Sallys Punishment bet shes a dab hand with the cords Could you stop there please These films include bondage spanking and flagellation all illegal to send through the mails will need you to sign a stipulation stating that you will agree not to sell any films photographs or drawings depicting these acts Sir if may my client sells a number of photographs of stills from Hollywood films Take one for example from Tarzan and the Slave Girl a scantily clad actress is tied up Lash marks are visible on her back Now this film passed the National Board of Review What is your point Mr Gangel Well certainly you cant intend for my client to stop selling these Hollywood film stills Inspector Those images represent a minute part of a featurelength film intended as harmless entertainment Mr Klaws films and photographs are created with the deliberate intention of inciting lust and lascivious thoughts and should therefore be barred from being sent through the mails If you do not cease and desist this will become a matter for the courts Hi girls That looks very artistic Whats it called Betties Clown Dance Very nice Howd it go Not good You look

Klaw Would never let me pose with my top off Irving Klaw Yeah you know him No think heard his name on last night though Some government investigation Irving on television Yeah think hes in a little bit of trouble What kind of trouble m sure its nothing Its probably just some senators blowing a lot of hot air Eyes to the camera please How about a wink We shall show by these hearings that a large portion of the market for this material is with inquisitive and impressionable teenagers There is a peculiar resemblance to narcotics addiction in exposure of juveniles to pornography but there is one difference however the injection of heroin into the veins of an addict stops with the addict but the contaminative effects of pornography in the hands of just one minor are incapable of measuring Irving says they cant shoot anymore until they sort this out Yeah Maybe its time stopped modeling and just worked hard at my acting People are getting tired of taking pictures of me anyhow Never What are you gonna do got a plan You do You know Frank and Charlie from the camera club Yeah couple of months ago they asked to borrow my apartment for a private session So said Whats in it for me So they paid me a little something And then it became a regular thing every Thursday Then another couple of guys asked and thought Why not go into business for myself How Well got myself a white fur rug Nice Well not real fur but good enough for pictures And a couple of pillars Thats on one side And on another wall m gonna get a mural painted of an Italian lake And maybe a fake fireplace on another wall so can shoot three sides and get the most out of the space Do you think Paula will be upset Maybe Its competition Mmm But you got to look after yourself in this world And you cant be a model forever was reading the theater section of the goddamned New York Times today and a drawing of this guy Petruchio swinging a whip in The Taming of the Shrew the play by Shakespeare is all over the first page Nobody cares Theyre all hypocrites Then see this illustration in the New York Times Magazine Of Kiss Me Kate a Broadway musical What does it show Spanking They wanna shut me down for distributing images almost identical to these Shh Dont say too much Remember what the lawyer said m beginning to get a persecution fear complex Dont You are Mr Klaw Yes Mr Klaw were you Sir in accordance with your suggestion we dont want any pictures Thank you very much We appreciate your cooperation Uh Mr Klaw were you requested to bring any books or records Yes do you have them sir decline to make them available under the th amendment of the constitution that they may tend to degrade or incriminate me and under the th amendment of the constitution that the subpoena is vague and illegal Do you wish to make any statement as to why you think producing any books or records called for here might tend to incriminate you decline to answer under the th amendment of the constitution that an answer may tend to incriminate me Dr Henry direct your attention to a booklet entitled Cartoon and Model Parade published by Irving Klaw of east th street specifically call your attention to the movie Negligee Fight The heading reads that this mm movie shows the terrific battle that ensues when both girls claim a black negligee Is this the masochistic type of perversion to which we just referred It is Is there a sexual deviation known as bondage where a person is trussed up with rope and chains Yes That is fairly common You say that that bondage is fairly common Fairly common in this particular group that is the group of sexual deviants Tell us more about that uh bondage being fairly common Among those that are familiar with this variety of sexual deviation it is a matter of common knowledge to them You mean they like to see someone who is bound up Yes they do Pictures of them Some of them do Now direct your attention to a series of photographs called New Specially Posed Bettie can only feel fear as she is unable to see her captors Now that the pole was bound to her body Bettie had to crawl on all fours like an animal The floor made Betties knees red and sore The unwieldy steel brank kept slipping back and forth Irritating the tender flesh at Betties neck thus making the cold steel an added menace It was most exhausting But Betties strength and endurance were equal to the task Doctor could ask you could could could children be sexually perverted by looking at photos of this nature Yes Would you say it is a fair statement that suicide murder and psychosis is the result of this type of trash In some instances yes Mr Grimm want say as Chairman of this Subcommittee know the embarrassment and the distaste you have in coming here to talk about the tragic happening to your son on August th of last year We appreciate your cooperation Mr Gaughan you may proceed Can you Mr Grimm tell the subcommittee how it was that your boy met his sudden end on the evening of August th Now realize it is an unsolved murder but tell us what you know Hed worked all day for me come home dirty and tired in his work clothes He was away all evening which was unusual He never left the house without telling us found him the next morning in a very grotesque weird situation that ve never been able to cope with or understand yet He was um trussed up in a very unnatural position Looked like it had been planned in some way He wasnt hung like most people hang themselves by the neck from a rope And the fact that he didnt have any clothes on he was a modest boy led me immediately to believe that there was some sex angle to it Mr Grimm do you recognize sir that booklet entitled Cartoon and Model Parade published by Irving Klaw the Pinup King Yes Would you tell the Subcommittee how you first came across a copy of this book Through a mutual friend who was interested in the case found very similar pictures of tying people up in this book that reminded me of my sons case ve never come across anything like that before was looking for a clue Sir let me direct your attention specifically to page four That picture illustrates a model named Bettie Page Does that accurately reflect how your boy was found Its more or less the same a very similar position havent had the police into it They let the case rest They said it was some sort of accident due to some impulse on the part of the boy dont care what the police think The way he was tied it wasnt anything any youngster like him with his character could concoct himself There wasnt any history of that no similar action on his part
