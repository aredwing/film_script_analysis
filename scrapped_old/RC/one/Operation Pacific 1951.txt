home run in the ninth inning the papers were full of you and the raising of that sunken sub Remember dives on that job made of them know but youre the guy they talked about And then when joined up got

zing Now youre talking like a jealous husband Exhusband and dont evade the question Its not a fair question girl cant spend the rest of her life kissing Its a good thing to fall back on when you run

you So you ran into me What now dont know Its not as simple as thought It took a war to make me understand Or maybe its just that m four years older But there hasnt a day you werent with me or a night

still running Those fish had time to get to Hoboken More duds Down scope Secure tubes Secure the tubes Take over Duke lets get some coffee If got a kind of a halfbaked idea about this thing that might get it cleared up So could tell it to somebody and help them to work it out wish d had the time to take one of these warheads apart and play around with the firing pin Get this off urgent priority In attack on two freighters torpedoes fired at ideal angle hit target but failed to explode Torpedoes fired at wide angle sank target All torpedoes issued Pearl Harbor Will keep trying charted the last four attacks By the way got answer to my torpedo message ve been ordered back home to help them find the bugs It will be kind of tough to leave the Thunder But really think can do some good

Theyll bring her in if shes afloat Thank you sir No luck sir The sets damaged too bad Keep trying Engineer and First Lieutenants reports sir All hands Heres the story The damage to our bow has cut our surface speed in half We can submerge but we cant make much headway That means well do most of our running at night Well be a little late getting back to Pearl but sit tight well make it Thats all And Ma in her kerchief and in my cap had just settled ourselves for a long winters nap What are we waiting for that huddle in the wardroom The board of investigation has to decide what happened before anybody goes ashore faulty torpedo cost Captain Perry his life otherwise the target would have been disabled The Thunder wouldnt have been forced into an emergency dive After the dive acted according to my understanding of the Thunders mission which was to destroy enemy shipping After the Jap ship went down we cruised the area for the rest of the day searching for Captain Perry What was the condition of the Thunder at that time Heavily damaged Barely able to make headway sir You and your men performed an outstanding submarine feat in getting the Thunder back to port We realize you had a rough patrol and need little time to unwind Were recommending that you be sent back to the States for a while d rather stay here and see to the Thunders refit Sorry Thats our recommendation Good day ve been waiting Another day ve got a little business thatll keep me busy for days Hey Camel Sorry m headed for a hot bath and a bottle Hey Mosconi Look d love to go with you baby but m always booked solid Hey Chief Not now Junior Why didnt you tell me didnt know all these guys would be here just dropped in Looks like a lot of us had the same idea guess its up to me to say something The most appropriate thing can think of is the last part of the burial at sea In the Navy prayer book it goes like this We commend their souls to God and commit their bodies to the deep in sure and certain hope of the resurrection into eternal life through Jesus Christ at whose coming to judge the world the sea shall give up her dead Pop wasnt killed in action Duke took that boat down from under him know how you must feel But how do you suppose Duke feels Hes secondincommand He was responsible for the safety of the Thunder and the lives of the crew So he took it down where it was safe But he didnt stay down where it was safe He brought it up again to fight Why m not the only one asking questions Theyre sending him back to the States Why dont know Bob But m sure Duke did what he thought was the right thing Dont try to defend him Mary Stuart Nothing means a thing to Duke except the chance to be a hero again Bob was over at your quarters looking for you wanted to tell you about Pop and how we all felt Whats the use of talking All can think of is Pop out there helpless while you went gloryhunting Too bad Dont be upset darling Lets sit down over here and you can tell me what happened In time Bob will forgive you Forgive me For what We didnt abandon Pop He ordered the Thunder down knowing he couldnt make it Knowing shed be under in less than a minute He gave his life for his crew and his boat Bob doesnt understand that After all Pop was his brother He was my best friend ll miss him His kindness and his gruff humor But the missing is all mixed with such a fierce pride in what he did that have no room for mourning think Pop understands But that doesnt lessen the hurt Wait a minute ve told you how feel If youre offering me a shoulder to cry on dont need it have nothing to cry about m only trying to help But you cant help me in this My problem is to stay aboard the Thunder and keep the crew together better get started on it right now See you later Whats the matter guess know now where stand Is the Admiral in Yes sir think he is expecting you Captain Gifford of the Thunderfish sir Come in Duke Thank you for seeing me sir Sit down Relax What can do for you d like to talk to you sir about the Thunder could say the crew is so wellcoordinated that it should be kept intact Thatd be true could tell you about Pop and the promise made to him Therere many things What are you trying to tell me dont want to go back to the States The Board says you had a strenuous time know they said that sir but thought perhaps you could There is one possibility for you to stay have been given permission to conduct experiments out here to find out why torpedoes dont explode wouldnt be any good for that m no theory man am a line officer belong aboard the Thunder Youre a practical submariner and this is a big job However Flag Lieutenant sir Arrange transportation for Captain Gifford on the next plane to the States hadnt finished sir meant to say was belong aboard a boat but ll do anything can thought youd feel that way gather from Pops messages he had some ideas of what was wrong Yes sir He started to explain to me but never finished You think anybody aboard the Thunder would have any ideas My chief might Matter of fact the whole crew are fine torpedo men Go into a huddle with the base Torpedo Officer See what you cook up Well give you all the help we can from the shops Thank you Its all right Find the answer for me You know dont enjoy sending out boats and crews with torpedoes that dont get the job done It looks all right here in the shop But it doesnt explode Weve figured out the force of impact If we could approximate the number of tons with which it hits the side of a ship Why dont you take it up high some place and drop it No luck Ten straight duds That sends me back to the States Me too This thing is a must for the admiral Chief is there anything we havent tried No sir Except the aluminum firing pins the base sent over but they look too light sir Put one in Yes sir Stand clear Let her go Hold it right there Turn around twice and give me all the angles Then get your hat coat stick and gloves cause were going out ve got something to say But do you have to say it right now Yes right now because m not going to enjoy it want to get it over with Please dont touch me Just listen The last time saw you was probably the most unselfish moment in my life was practically glowing with things wanted to do for you But you didnt give me a chance Sorry Now that everything is cleared up You want somebody to howl with you Not just somebody want you m not available Duke That night in front of the nurses quarters and then again at the pier forgot for a moment why we split up But you reminded me The old trouble came charging back It wasnt the Navy the wet winters bad quarters or your being away so much Those things just made it more wonderful when you got home Sure we did we had some great times together But a marriage isnt all laughs wanted to cry with you sometimes too wanted to comfort you when you lost your best friend But you wouldnt let me wanted to comfort you when we lost our son But you went off into some corner of your own never realizing by comforting you could have helped my own grief Maybe its my fault Maybe shouldnt have let you shut me out But you have no corner on pride If cant be a part of everything in your life cant be a part of anything So there it is The trouble between us You dont need me Duke You never have You dont need anybody but yourself fine boy Take good care of him will you mans got a lot to learn heard every word you said ve tried to keep my nose out of your business but cant stand by anymore and watch you make a fool of yourself Commander Steele Keep quiet and listen Of course he comes to you when he wants to play Or do you want him to go to some another woman You married him for what he is then tried to make something else of him When you couldnt and you never will you began to feel sorry for yourself How long would you love him if he did cry on your shoulder You dont need me Maybe shouldnt have let you shut me out What kind of talk is that And what has pride got to do with love Dont worry He wont be happy But what is more important he wont be back Skip it seaman Whats the matter Junior Getting some fresh air No sir was just sitting up here thinking about women How you miss them till you get ashore And then how you wonder why And how soon you start missing them again reckon its just a vicious circle Its a mighty cynical observation for a gentleman from Georgia Alabama sir beg

grandpappy was with Dewey at Manila My pappy was with Admiral Sims chasing boats Why even the town come from is named Decatur Indications lead to an allout Japanese effort to destroy the recently obtained United States base at Leyte and prevent support and supply by our fleet The Imperial Japanese Fleet is known to have left its base headed south Several courses are open to them Consequently initial contact is of vital importance Our submarines are located along this general line And its our job to locate them Will the Japs take a gamble like that Theyll have to The Philippine landing was a ticklish job We bypassed a lot of places to jump in there If they let us stay theyre gone geese What is it Message from the Corvena Theyve got gear trouble in number four main engine and want help from us Check with the engineer officer and if we can spare the parts arrange a rendezvous How long have you been out Freddie days Didnt even see a rowboat Did you guys bring any new pictures with you
