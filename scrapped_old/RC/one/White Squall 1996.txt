please Frank get him to call it off m sorry Wait What is this You do what youve gotta do Frank The United States Coast Guard has been asked to conduct this maritime hearing to consider the revocation of Captain Christopher Sheldons Master Seamans Certificate All right Captain Sanders you may begin The Albatross By all accounts a sound vessel An experienced captain an able crew And yet it lies out there on the bottom in fathoms with its back broken There are serious questions that demand our most serious consideration so that we might understand so that perhaps we may prevent such a sad event from ever taking place again freak accident one in a million meteorological anomaly Or was it inexperience misjudgment Negligence Well see Please Thank you Captain Sheldon Captain Sheldon would you consider yourself a good judge of character when it came to the boys Yes And it would be important would it not in your position to have some sense of their strengths and weaknesses Yes of course Do you recall an incident involving Gil Martin What incident would you be referring to Well is it true that you forced Gil Martin to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic He climbed when he was ready Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall Yes was Sir were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among your crew Yes was You didnt do anything about it No did not Had you ever seen a white squall before this incident No And what makes you so sure it was one cant be sure You really felt that your crew was up to the conditions We had come miles together through every kind of seas imaginable Except a white squall Now with all due respect Captain theyre only boys Theyre much more than that sir Is it true that the reason you expelled Frank Beaumont For killing a dolphin And that you invited him to strike you to fight it out on the deck of the ship Yes that is true So you allowed the use of alcohol among things to go unpunished and yet you expelled this boy for killing a fish mammal mammal It would appear to me sir with all due respect that your stewardship as captain of the Albatross could be characterized as reckless unbalanced with no discipline whatsoever Do you find this funny Some kind of joke dont think one second of this is funny sir The National Weather Service says white squalls are a meteorological phenomenon of the imagination What do you say to that What happened to my ship was not imagined It was not a dream sir No Captain Sheldon it was not It was a nightmare Now Shay need you to help me out On the day of the accident do you remember where you were when the lightning first struck was on deck Mmm midships During this squall that ensued why didnt you drop any sail Skipper called us out of the rigging But your instinct was to lose sail Skippers instinct was to not get any any of us electrocuted How old are you son Fifteen And you were the first mate of the Albatross Is that correct am the first mate of the Albatross Thats correct And are you a professional sailor son No m not a professional sailor You say you turned hard to starboard when the gust hit thought wed have a better chance if headed into the wind But the captain ordered you hard to port Twice m sorry Twice Is that what you were trained to do No Speak up son cant hear you said No And what did you think he was trying to do Put her off To let the blow drive the boat downwind By the blow youre referring to the force of the storm Is that right Let the blow drive the boat downwind and neutralize our canvas So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training you thought he was making a mistake No Then why son Why didnt you follow his order Because panicked You know thats not true Tod Do you believe he panicked What the hell is he doing Quiet please Maybe you cant see whats happening here but can Tod appreciate what youre trying to do here Maybe you could live with it but couldnt If you think m gonna let a then you underestimate me The Albatross was my ship The Ocean Academy was my school Her responsibility is mine and mine alone cant bring your sons back If you want my ticket if that will ease your pain thats the least that can do This this is easy Captain Sheldon Captain No Order please order This proceeding is not over have further questions No for this witness Order Dont you walk out on us Skipper You dont You tell me Was it all just a lie Was it Because we listened to you we believed you And we are still here Bad things happen sometimes and there is nothing that you can do about it It wasnt you or Tod It wasnt you Tod It was all of us everyone in this room Because we all knew the risks we were taking going out there You paid our tuition and you told us to go So why do we just have to invent some reason now for why this happened just pin it on one person Why Then shame on you Skipper Shame on you Mr Gieg was in command of the Albatross And was responsible for precious cargo It was my job to get you all home safely with my knowledge and my skill Thats the contract that made with your parents But something happened out there lost control Maybe just for an instant maybe all along m not sure But know this never saw it coming It was like just woke up and a hand came down and pushed my sails into the sea It got away for me the whole thing And people died Now youre young and strong Everythings ahead of you You told us Where we go one we go all Well we believed you We lived by it sir And and now youre saying that where you go we cant follow Mr Gieg The Albatross wasnt just a ship or a school It was something that we made Something thats inside of us Thats who you are Skipper What you gave us You carried us Now let us carry this together Let us carry this together Let it go Just go home They didnt take his ticket today But wonder if hell ever go to sea again know one thing If he did wed all go with him To a man No doubt Not even a question Today he joined the circle he created by allowing us to share his burden The burden of sea captains and fathers the burden of men In the end it just comes down to one thing You cant run from the wind You face the music you trim your sails and keep going Shes the dark star over the sea Go where my true love is waiting for me Rode the south wind Canvas the stars Harness the moonlight so she can safely go Round the Cape Horn to Valpariso Red the port light Starboard the green How will she know of the devils ve seen Cross in the sky Star of the sea Under the moonlight There she can safely go Round the Cape Horn to Valpariso Valpariso Though every road walk will take me down to the sea With every breath of promise in my sack Every love will always send the ship of my heart Over the rolling sea If should die Waters my grave Shell never know if m damned or m saved See the ghosts fly over the sea Under the moonlight there she can safely go Round the Cape Horn to Valpariso Valpariso Valpariso
