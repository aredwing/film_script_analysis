This is an unusual case My Lord The accused was at an unmanned station under the influence of a strong fortified wine Railway personnel from some miles away manning security cameras saw him staggering towards the stations edge Lovely jubbly Would all passengers stand back from the edge of the platform You with the trainers on You with the blue tracksuit Get back Theres a train coming through here any minute Stand back Is somebody taking the piss here When will you do what youre told and stand back Stand back Thats right you heard me Stand back If you say so pal Oh shit See Look what youve done now you fucking imbecile Get off that track Theres a train coming through here in seconds What the fuck was that you arsehole fucking nearly broke my bottle Fuck the bottle Get off the track Hurry up Get a fucking move on cannot find my glasses This is God calling Get off the fucking track will you Get a fucking move on or youre gonna die Fuck me Move it you fucking arsehole Oh thank fuck Oh Shit It seems to me young man that your profound stupidity is matched only by your good fortune sentence you to hours of Community Payback If you dont carry out the required work you will come back here before me and receive a custodial sentence Is that clear No not really The accused stole a yellow and blue macaw from a pet shop in the Gallowgate area of the city The bird was stuffed inside a Marks Spencers carrier bag with tail protruding On being asked for an explanation by a police constable the accused replied Why dont you piss off and start hunting rapists mass murderers and perverts grumpy twat The damage to the vending machine was not as great as first feared My Lord and it has been repaired at very little cost It seems clear this of fence was committed unfortunately through depression and this recent violent outburst is a desperate attempt to get back inside the prison system This is a public order of fence My Lord Climbing the statue of the Duke of Wellington in the city centre The accused was under the influence of drink and drugs He seems to bear a grudge against public monuments On previous occasions he has put a Scottish flag around Queen Victoria and urinated on Donald Dewar The accused had a parttime cleaning job three days a week But during this time she continued to claim Social Security benefits Your Lordship will note there is a considerable history of fraudulent claims from the accused She seems unable to change her behaviour of claiming benefits shes not entitled to As you will recall My Lord this young man has pleaded guilty to a violent and prolonged assault Now it is accepted that the accuseds rivals in this case provoked the incident but at the same time the severity and viciousness of the accuseds reaction went far beyond selfdefence Both the accuseds rivals were assaulted to their severe and permanent disfigurement Given his chaotic childhood My Lord both Mr Emmersons parents were frequently in and out of custody during his formative years Um he perhaps didnt have the best start in life Your Lordship will note that following Mr Emmersons release from Polmont Young Offenders Institution the last months have been troublefree My Lord albeit apart from this one very serious incident He has formed a stable relationship with his girlfriend She continues to be a positive and stabilizing influence in his life The reason for that is clear Within days my client will become a father for the first time My Lord the prospects of fatherhood have changed this young man and he would grasp one last opportunity with both hands He has clashed with his girlfriends father on several occasions which gives rise to serious concern Stand up Your record is appalling For much of your short life you have behaved like a thug and the violent incidents in this case have proven to me that you are still a dangerous individual But you are obviously a young man with energy and talent You have escaped a significant custodial sentence by the skin of your teeth sentence you to hours of Community Payback Silence there Silence Silence there Silence in court Silence Quiet Oh fuck cannot believe that man Its okay Leonie God

house This is the mash tun here and its massive Come on have a look at it Its really big It takes and a half tons of malted barley and to that we add liters of hot water What were doing at this stage is mixing the barley and the hot water for the conversion of starch to sugar Here we are in the fermentation room This is where we ferment the wort weve just extracted from the mash tun Its also where we take the third ingredient the third of the three simple ingredients which is yeast and we add it to the mix And as soon as we add the yeast because its been dehydrated as soon as we add it to the wort it starts to ferment ll show you it Fuck me thats strong aint it man Actually need a volunteer Whos got a sensitive nose Aye ll do it ll do it ll do it ll take you What want you to do is just get your head in there and have a good sniff Youre at it This is called the still house It really is such a beautiful room Be careful you dont touch anything though Its really hot and you could burn yourself Come on up So this is the still house and its such an important room in the house Its kinda like the heart of the distillery Its where all the magic really does happen and it happens in these four stills here If was to change one of these stills d have to make sure every single dent every nook and cranny was the exact same otherwise it could alter the flavour of the whisky Come on follow me Shes got the body of a goddess Come on round this one here Now theres a subtle reaction between the wood and the spirit because the wood actually flavours and colours the spirit Its amazing And they were crafted so beautifully that they actually breathe m sorry you cant actually smoke in here Sorry man Fucks sake you Give us it m sorry You stupid You no go to school no No Its my last fag man Dont give a fuck youll blow us all up man Sake man Stupid cunt Sorry about that Mairi Thank you How long do you keep the whisky in the casks for Ten twenty thirty years It just depends Whats the most

Unbelievable Its a lot of money Andrew can you show us how to flog the bung Flogging the bungs not something you do up the dancing on a Saturday night Its actually how we traditionally open a cask

you would Come on well go back to the visitor centre The angels share like that Thats good Aye that is good There we are Now our noses are so sensitive we can actually detect scents that have been diluted to onemillionth of a part Its our most primitive sense Right here goes back to when we used to crawl about as reptiles on our bellies Well some people will never change eh Did youse know and this is fact by the way the sexual behaviour of mice is driven by what they sniff What are youse laughing at Is that serious Yeah serious So when they smell cheese they get a hardon is that it Fuck off What want you to do is have a little nose of the whisky Thats basically a wee smell And tell me what you think it reminds you of My Das breath when was wee thats what it reminds me of Reminds me

do think would be a a out of It was the most incredible whisky Can you tell us what it was Come on please But it will come to auction within the next couple of weeks and my goodness itll be all over the all over the press Erm It was a strange story associated with it because the distillery itself closed in the early s and the cask was discovered in a warehouse a long long way from where the original making distillery was located And its supposed that it might have been an exchange on marriage between the manager of the distillery which made this whisky and the manager of the distillery where it was found You said its going to public auction Can you give me an idea a rough idea of how much a bottle would be worth This whisky is so rare that erm its unknown And a cask of it is simply beyond price Never judge a book by its cover eh Can ask you something Try this What do you think Thats easy Where did you pick that up Youve got a very good nose Here Take my card You never know

What Malt Mill have you ever tried it No havent no Its Its the Holy Grail This is without doubt a genuine Malt Mill the only cask left in existence and since there are only three known bottles and two of these are suspected fakes every serious collector in the world would pay a fortune In my view it is likely that the sale could raise in excess of a million pounds What No way Fuck me million smackeroonies My body is pure shaking honestly If you were a man youd have a hardon Have a wee seat guys Please Just till we have a serious think about this mean what is that Like a quarter of a million each or something Right this is whats happening Theyre gonna have the auction where the cask is away up North in Dornoch Firth Then what theyll do is invite the richest collectors dealers to
