In Britain celebrated Queen Victorias Diamond Jubilee years on the throne But the show of pomp and majesty on Londons streets concealed a very different royal story Behind palace gates a secret war was raging over Queen Victorias shocking relationship with a servant Some said he was on the make Others that he was a spy But worst of all he was an Indian It was a relationship that violated Victorian taboos of race and class and set the Queen on a collision course with her royal household who made their feelings plain You are an impostor You are from a very low class and can never be called a gentleman This just enraged Victoria The worse the attacks got the more she defended him There was a place for everyone and everyone had place but Karim didnt have a place If one knew him today he would be a pain in the arse Abdul was not greedy Abdul was brown And therefore he was a threat And the Queen loved him more than she loved them That really is what it was about This is a tale of love and loathing at the heart of the British court over the extraordinary relationship between the most powerful empress on earth and her Indian servant Abdul Karim In June in the th year of Queen Victorias reign a tall handsome stranger walked into the Queens life And years of trouble began Abdul when he was young when he first appeared at court looked wonderful Queen Victoria always had a great appreciation of male beauty and so when she saw these gorgeous clothes of sashes and turbans um kissing her feet how could she resist them Abdul Karim was one of two Indian servants who had arrived as gifts from Her Majestys Indian empire His role was to serve as the Queens khitmagar or table hand But Victoria soon found Abdul was a man of many talents We dont know exactly what Abdul said in that first year when he starts to really come to her attention All we know is that somehow he must have appealed to her romantic interest in the Orient He started to tell her stories of India and that hooked her As the Empress of India Victoria had long been fascinated by the most exotic and important jewel in her crown The dangers of the long sea voyage made a visit to India impossible But now Abdul brought India to her think Victoria was just enchanted and enraptured with the idea of being Empress of India He told her stories about India Fables about India India for her was exotic it was a place of spices and saris and a place of peacocks It was the India of her imagination which was a colourful and gay and exotic space And Abdul satisfied her imaginative curiosity She really desperately wanted to know about her empire He certainly would have given her aspects of Muslim history and one of the great stories of Indian Mogul history is of course Shah Jahan the Emperor and thats how the Taj Mahal was built She must have fallen for those great romantic tales Young Abdul didnt just feed the Queens romantic imagination Within a few weeks of his arrival he was also adding some zing to the royal taste buds Evidence of Karims kitchen revolution is recorded in the archives at Osborne House Her Majestys favourite residence on the Isle of Wight Well this is a ledger and it gives a fantastic account of the mountains of food that were consumed here The influence of Abdul Karim is very clear In the luncheon menu here for instance every Sunday at lunchtime there was always a curry dish provided on the menu And here on the th of February it was a chicken curry th of August Had some excellent curry prepared by one of my Indian servants And we know that Abdul Karim and some of the Indian attendants cooked these curries they prepared the meat and procured their own spices and so on and were given a corner of the main kitchen here at Osborne where they could prepare these authentic curry dishes suspect she rather enjoyed it With Karim in her kitchens the Queens palaces were transformed into some of Britains first and finest curry houses But Abdul had ambitions to be more than just a novelty chef Given his class background which was fairly humble think most people in that position would have been fairly reticent Abdul Karim was not What he says to the Queen is that he is a very educated man to the point of implying that he can be a teacher Abdul was eyeing promotion And in Queen Victoria the wouldbe teacher found an eager pupil At the age of the Queen was a figure of great authority and much revered by her subjects But her private life was marked by tragedy Victoria had never fully recovered from the death of her beloved German husband Prince Albert For two decades John Brown her Scottish servant had been the Queens most intimate male companion But in Brown died And in Abdul Karim the Queen found the ideal replacement He was a very warm man he was very entertaining he was jolly he was a very human person as such And maybe those were the traits that er attracted the Queen to him eventually because he was a man who came across as a man of flesh and blood and dont think she was used to real people around her She wanted somebody with whom she could relate directly um and she craved this kind of intimacy You know theres that famous quote after Albert dies she says Theres nobody who can call me Victoria now Certainly she was very needy she was emotionally hungry and she grew up without a father and with a mother that she believed didnt love her She did not have an easy childhood at all So in later life what she really really needed was someone to give her unconditional attention In Abdul Karim she found a man ready willing and able to provide it Just weeks after Abduls arrival at court the Queen made a startling announcement am learning a few words of Hindustani Young Abdul teaches me Hes a very strict master and a perfect gentleman No more pots and pans for Abdul The yearold kitchen boy was now to be known as the Queens munshi or teacher Entrusted with the honour of instructing the monarch in the official language of her Indian subjects For the rest of her life the Queen kept a daily record of her studies in a series of journals Well here we have an example from the Queens Hindustani diary Aaj ka din bohat atchaa rahaa Shah Persia aaj hamaari mulakaatko meh chandvasiroh keh aayi The day was very fine The Shah of Persia came to see me today with some of his ministers at two oclock The script has been written with a certain amount of fluency in a very enthusiastic way Shes trying to come to grips with something which is actually very alien And the skill that is needed for that to be done at a competent level is going to be very very significant So what see is actually m very impressed with what she was able to achieve only what about a year after she had started learning Hindustani Over the years the Queens Hindustani journals would become a secret channel of communication between the monarch and her munshi Some of the vocabulary seems quite suggestive Theres things like The Queen will miss Abdul Translate Give me a hug Translate dont think it is actually that but its stuff that seems quite personal and intimate that they felt the need to be able to say to each other With his daily doses of Hindustani his tales from the Taj and his mango chutney Abdul had become the Queens undisputed favourite And she didnt care who knew it Abdul was kind of like a pet really like a beautiful tiger or something walking along beside the Queen and sometimes when they were on the continent people were quite confused about who he was because he would follow her carriage in his own carriage And it was said in France for example that he was a captured Indian prince that she paraded around just to show the might of the British Empire But not everybody was so taken with the Palace new boy On entering royal service Abdul had landed in a world governed by strict codes of class and protocol At the top of the court hierarchy were the ladies and gentlemen of the royal household When Abdul arrived at the English court it was like entering a labyrinth with layers and layers of people going out and out and out At the heart of it are the lords and ladies in waiting These are aristocrats then you get the actual servants who do the cooking and cleaning So the idea that somebody whos a servant who is an outsider who has none of this pedigree none of this background can suddenly leapfrog into a position of great closeness to the Queen is something that they find well not only threatening but wrong Abdul soon found himself at odds with the royal household led by the Queens Private Secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby and Her Majestys doctor Sir James Reid The household had never been used to Indian servants and um they really didnt like it Sir James had to deal with them medically but there was much more to it than that because the Queen was obsessed by their clothes and comfort She was always worrying and Sir James had to have special tweeds made for them but they had to be in Indian styles because she wanted them to look exotic She gave Henry Ponsonby a dictionary which can just see his wry face you know can imagine him going back to the family and saying Oh shes given me a Imagine shes given me a Hindustani dictionary and ve got to learn Urdu now Had Abdul just been pleased or happy with his position as a khitmagar which is a waiter at table and all that they mightnt have minded so much But it was that he was getting special treatment The Palace simmered with quiet rage over the servant who didnt know his place But the discontent was about to boil over into an unprecedented civil war between the Queen and her own court Christmas At Osborne House the Queens staff and family were looking forward to the traditional highlight of the festive season There is this rather strange form of Victorian house party entertainment think its a shame that its fallen by the wayside the tableau What you do is that you get all your unwilling family and friends you get them to dress up you build your own scenery But it doesnt really matter if nobody can act or sing You just arrange yourselves into a sort of staging of an old master painting or a biblical scene And then all sorts of people carry props representing this that and the other and theres slightly wonky palm trees in the background The royal amdrams had been a fixture in the household from the early years of Victorias marriage years on the Queens children were still providing the onstage talent as were the aristocrats of the royal household Usually the more important positions in the theme would be held by the more important people and the members of the royal family The arrival of Abdul Karim and the Indian servants changed everything Once Victoria had the Indians at Osborne this was a great boon for the staging of tableaux because now they could do scenes from the East and that sort of thing with genuinelooking characters If you needed wise men for a nativity scene here you had them Straight from the East the real thing It wasnt only the royal repertoire that was transformed by Karims arrival With each performance Abdul himself inched closer to the limelight Its quite interesting to chart his rise to power from the early ones where hes kind of an extra Just a servant in the background But as time goes on he gets promoted if you like This was something think he was known to be very fond of understand he would be the main star the director the overall and beall Theres one called The King Of Egypt where hes hes on a throne He has his own slaves fanning him Hes clearly the top guy now This man was a waiter but here he is as the king of Egypt And although it was only on the stage you know it actually meant something in real life too The costumed capers mirrored a reallife palace promotion By Abdul was already a regular presence at royal receptions Now he was to be officially elevated by Queen Victoria to the position of Her Majestys Indian Secretary As for Abdul Karim the Queen can never praise him highly enough He is zealous and attentive a thorough gentleman in feelings and manners Karim had crossed a line No longer a mere servant he was now elevated into the top rank of the palace hierarchy as a member of the royal household itself The Queens gentlemen were not amused In the household at the time status is terribly important and someone who came from India who was Indian probably wouldnt have held positional rank below stairs above the most junior parlour maids housemaids and junior boot boys And so suddenly when the Queen chooses this individual and places him not just in a position of special servant to her but ultimately as her private secretary this really upset everyone Karim was not only overturning the established order inside the royal household he was also about to fall out with the most powerful man in the empire the Viceroy of India himself It all started with a Christmas card Hearty greetings to His Excellency the Earl of Elgin To wish you a happy Christmas From Mh Abdul Karim at Windsor Castle Flowrets fair as the morning light wake for you the earth be white With hearts of gold and a breath of may and a wish from my heart to yours today Its hardly likely that the earth was going to be white in India but never mind At the Viceroys Mansion in Calcutta Abduls attempt to ingratiate himself cut no ice For somebody to start writing in that very personal way to the Viceroy of India an aristocrat of incredible standing was extraordinary Imagine it youve been made Viceroy of India youre dealing with the massive problems of the subcontinent youre constantly dealing with people at the highest level of that society and then suddenly out of the blue a Christmas card arrives from Abdul Karim What do you do with it Whys he written it Who is he Although Christmas was important it was very much a family thing and an intrusion from outside was not think really expected just dont think that anybody really felt that you really ought to use Christmas for sending some sort of a greeting Well why not just send an ordinary letter But it was wrong and difficult therefore to make a reply and it was better overlooked dont think it was a question of snobbery or anything like that It was just incomprehensible somehow Karims card was returned and quietly buried in government files in Whitehall When Queen Victoria learnt of the slight she leapt to Abduls defence Victoria liked to stir things up you know We know this because although she knew that the Viceroy despised Abdul she insisted that the Viceroy should reply You know now the Viceroy was perplexed He would not deign to write to a lower a creature from the lower orders but he had to respond you know There was a place for everyone and everyone had a place But Karim didnt have a place And so it made life complicated An intruder any dirt that sort of got into the machinery it was difficult to know how to remove it The Christmas card fiasco and Karims promotion as the Queens Secretary stung the royal household into attack They used as a weapon Lord Elgins former assistant Fritz Ponsonby the son of Victorias private secretary Fritz had been despatched to Abduls hometown of Agra His mission to investigate Karims family credentials and he came up with some powerful ammunition At court Abdul had given the impression that his father was a highflying surgeongeneral in the Indian army The truth was rather less glamorous Abdul was lets say slightly economical with the truth about his family background and he pretended that his father had had a position in the Indian Army been a glamorous surgeon Fritz Ponsonby discovers that Abduls father was in fact a lowly apothecary at the jail in Agra and that Abduls background was not nearly as exalted as Abdul pretended Ponsonbys enquiries revealed that Abdul was the second of six children from a family of decidedly modest means His father was a hakim or native doctor at Agra Jail young man of limited education Abdul had also been employed at the jail as a lowly clerk but used his fathers connections with the British authorities to push himself forward for royal duty When news reached the British court the feathers began to fly Here was a man who in the view of the Victorian was of a very low class and in the view of the Victorian was from a lesser race By your presumption and arrogance youve created for yourself a situation that can no longer be permitted to exist You are an impostor On the subject of your origin we have a certificate from India about your father You are from a very low class and can never be called a gentleman To be called Secretary is perfectly ridiculous Abduls embellishment of his past deepened the households hostility But the QueenEmpress herself took a radically different view As the household began to make their attacks on Abdul researching his family background saying he made grandiose claims saying he was dishonest and that sort of thing this just enraged Victoria The worse the attacks got the more she defended him The Queen comes out with an interesting statement for the time that its race prejudice because there are a lot of people at the time who thought that well the world is organised into races and some are better than others mean this was an era of social Darwinism so she was definitely taking a stand on that To make out the Munshi is low is really outrageous Abdul feels cut to the heart at being thus spoken of The Queen is so sorry for the poor Munshis sensitive feelings Under royal protection Abdul prospered The Queen gave him not one but three houses at Balmoral Windsor and this one in the grounds at Osborne She brought Karims Indian wife to live at court and even offered intimate marital advice My dear Abdul spoke to Dr Reid about your dear wife It may be she has twisted something inside which would account for things not being regular have had nine children myself and there is nothing would not do to help you both As the Queens favourite and as an Indian Karim was almost universally despised by Victorias staff and family And it wasnt only the colour of his skin that made Abdul the subject of bitter resentment If one knew him today he would be a pain in the arse He was pompous conceited you can see it in his face and absolutely did not think of knowing his place He pushed for whatever he could get and he was a bit of a rogue He was so pushy and he was always trying to get more and more You know he got a huge amount of money out of the Queen Obviously you know he got a bit too big for his boots You know he wanted to be given his what he considered his correct status And when he was on the train he wanted to have a whole carriage for himself mean he always wanted to be the top And then the other Indian servants didnt like him either because he was domineering and unkind to them He certainly doesnt come out of it terribly well He was manipulative He simply abused the dignity in a way that he shouldnt have had as a personal servant to the Queen He abused it Karim was so confident of his own importance that by the year of Victorias Diamond Jubilee he appeared to regard himself not as Her Majestys servant but as her master In October a photograph is published in The Graphic of Queen Victoria sitting at a table with Abdul standing right in the centre of the photograph So the Queen in the photograph is a little old lady with a rather bent back Abdul is looking straight to camera a strong big solid figure and much more dominant than the Queen and the whole iconography of the photograph suggests that the Queen is basically subservient At every level the photograph seems to offend ideas about hierarchy This photograph produced absolute horrified reaction and think its important to make the point that Abdul organises for this photograph to be taken and also think sends it to the press In their efforts to rid themselves of the upstart Indian Abduls enemies had failed to make his character his class or his race count against him in the Queens eyes As her Diamond Jubilee approached they hit upon a powerful new weapon Abduls religion In Abdul Karim set out for the short drive from Windsor to the sleepy village of Woking He was on a visit to a controversial new building the first of its kind in Britain The Queens Munshi Abdul Karim went on Sunday to his devotions at the Mohammedan mosque at Woking This custom he observes every year and is met by Mohammedans from all parts of England who come to see the Munshi and join him in prayers Britains first purposebuilt mosque had opened its doors for business in But that didnt mean Victorian Britain welcomed Muslims Across the globe Britains imperial interests were in conflict with Islam There were military adventures in Egypt and the Sudan tensions in the Middle East with the Ottoman sultan and seemingly endless wars in Afghanistan Thered been a certain amount of fear of Islam for centuries It became much much more explicit in the late th century So we have people like William Gladstone talking about the unspeakable and wicked Turk He referred to the Koran as that accursed book When congregations actually took place there were indeed assaults physical assaults missiles bricks people who were actually worshipping got badly injured With Britain in the grip of Islamophobia the presence of a Muslim within the inner sanctum of the Empire was potential dynamite Those responsible for running the Empire soon found cause to be worried The Queen thinks Mohammedans do require more protection than Hindus They are decidedly and by far the most loyal Abdul Karim was very influential on Queen Victorias view of India She seems to take a decided proMuslim stance In particular there is a clash of festivals and she actually suggests to the Viceroy that he should cancel the Hindu festival And the Viceroys reply is to point out this would be just as difficult to do as cancelling Christmas in England Karim was not only feeding the Queen with inflammatory advice over religious tensions in India increasingly he was seen as a security risk in his own right As the Queens secretary Karim had access to secret documents on vital matters of foreign policy in Russia Afghanistan and the Middle East Government officials feared he was feeding state secrets to Britains enemies in the Islamic world One of his jobs is to blot her signature as she writes her endless letters but when people start saying Abdul Abdul is allowed to read the letters of Lord Elgin with important information about the running of the great Empire then this is new territory think For a personal servant to be close to the monarchy is one thing for him to get involved in politics is another The question was of course is whether Karim in fact could read And nobody really ever resolved that one But at the same time of course Grandfather had to arrange for a certain amount of surveillance of a most careful nature In Abdul set sail for India on his annual holiday But he was not alone The Munshi is coming out m not sure about the exact date but about this time But we should like to know if any of the intriguers in native states and elsewhere make any attempt to approach him Do what you can with as little stir as possible Tipped off by the Viceroy intelligent officers were following Abduls every move Karims name even appeared on a secret dossier monitoring the political views of every prominent Muslim in the But the Munshi was no militant British agents concluded that on his holiday Abdul was plotting nothing more than his own enrichment Karim had travelled to India to take ownership of more than acres of prime government land in Agra a gift from the Queen as a reward for his loyal service It was land that made Karims family one of the richest and most powerful in the region This whole area was allotted to him He came with two ships loaned off or gifts from England and very nice gifts from England The whole area was known as Karim Lodge Now we enter his home This is the room where he used to receive his guests He was a very important person am told that even the GovernorGeneral also came here On his trips home the man who had left India as a humble waiter now enjoyed the libertine lifestyle of a Maharaja His life was very lively He loved music and dances wines he was very fond of Indian festivals and parties here He used to arrange dances of beautiful women and all the time there was drinking going on And he loved music And then he used to take these big people hunting But Victoria couldnt last for long without her Abdul By the Queen had become completely dependent upon him to the almost total exclusion of her own staff and family As the Diamond Jubilee approached Karim took his place at Her Majestys side The household were beside themselves over the pairs growing intimacy think Queen Victoria actually loved Abdul as a son We know from her letters They were deeply affectionate her letters to him and they were signed your loving mother And so therefore Abdul was there and he became like her son When Abdul became ill Queen Victoria insisted on visiting him And she would visit him in his bedroom This is the Queen going into the bedroom of a servant twice a day She would sort of straighten his pillows and stroke his hand and make sure his fever was you know held his forehead et cetera And this was breaking all sorts of taboos But Abduls life of luxury had left him increasingly plagued by illness In at the start of Victorias Diamond Jubilee year the Queens doctor Sir James Reid seized his opportunity to strike Dr Reid who was charged with looking after Abdul told the household that Abdul had what he called gleet which was his name for think gonorrhoea Its extraordinary when you think about it really that Dr Reid should have breached his doctors confidentiality and broadcast this fact but he did And when the household are told this is totally unacceptable this is really the last straw For the members of the Royal household consorting with an Indian was bad enough consorting with a diseased Indian was beyond the pale Drastic measures were called for As the household prepared for their traditional Easter break in the South of France it fell to the Queens Lady of the Bedchamber Harriet Phipps to deliver an ultimatum The household said Look if Abduls coming to France with us this year then we resign We dont want him And the Queen flies into a wonderfully a rage that only a monarch is allowed to do She was in such a rage she swept all the papers off her desk It would have made a wonderful bang all this stuff going on the floor It was a physical expression of fury In the face of the royal tantrum the household was forced into a humiliating climbdown Desperate to bring an end to the Munshi mania Victorias own son Bertie the Prince of Wales now stepped into the fray with an unprecedented attack on the monarch herself In the world came to London From across the Empire representatives of Her Majestys colonies arrived for the Diamond Jubilee But as the Queens family and staff prepared for the ceremonies the Palace was mired in crisis over the monarch and her Munshi So its its the Queens Diamond Jubilee and the Olympic Games and all the world are coming to London Youve got to think of and Queen Victorias Diamond Jubilee as the same kind of scale of occasion All the eyes of the world were going to be on London and most of the world had come to London It was going to be the biggest thing that had happened to the monarchy And yet at the same time this was the year of Munshi mania With just weeks to go until the celebrations Victoria and Abdul dropped a bombshell over the Jubilee honours Karim was a gogetter and Queen Victoria was willing to facilitate this to a great extent Up to the point that eventually late in his career she is going along with the suggestion that he should be knighted After a decade at court Karim already boasted a chestful of prestigious medals gifts from his everadmiring Queen Empress and one from the German Kaiser But for the Queens ministers the prospect of Sir Abdul Karim was one step too far She was in danger of undermining the monarchy itself If somebody who was the son of a hospital orderly could be elevated to the position of a knight then the message its sending to all the other Indian princes is that all these different gun salutes these orders of precedence theyre meaningless Determined to put an end to the crisis Abduls old adversary the Viceroy of India joined forces with the Prime Minister Lord Salisbury to oppose Karims knighthood Victoria refused to back down Queen Victoria was very lukewarm about the Diamond Jubilee She was undergoing to borrow a phrase from her descendant her annus horribilis terrible year She refused to wear a crown and she at one point threatened to pull out of the thing altogether With the success of the Jubilee hanging in the balance in April Queen Victorias son the Prince of Wales stepped into the fray After a fraught discussions with her Majestys doctor Sir James Reid the pair came up with a plan The following day Reid visited the Queen and made his play There are people in high places who know Your Majesty well who say to me that the only charitable explanation that can be given is that Your Majesty is not sane And that the time will come when to save Your Majestys memory and reputation it will be necessary for me to come forward and say so have seen the Prince of Wales yesterday and he says hes quite made up his mind to come forward if necessary because it affects the throne think for the household actually to stand up in this way is very remarkable And think that perhaps at the back of their minds or maybe at the front of their minds is that the Queen is going to appear in public very shortly the monarchy is going to be exposed to public view with the Jubilee so its important that things should be in order The threat to have the Queen declared insane appeared to hit home For once in her life Victoria admitted defeat Abdul would remain plain Mr Karim On the nd of June the palace gates opened and Britain celebrated the Queens years on the throne But Victoria had the last laugh Throughout the celebrations the man who had become her rock remained at her side rubbing shoulders with Indian princes and European royalty Ever the industrious student Victoria ended the day with an entry in her Hindustani journal For the remaining four years of the Queens life Victoria and Abdul were inseparable But in the Queen died and Abduls protection came to an end Just days after the Queens funeral Karim received a visit at his home on the royal estate Abdul and my grandfather were in Karim Lodge and there was this group that came out from the palace My grandfather was asked to go into the cottage and lay his hands on any documents which had the royal crest on it And think there was a concerted effort to erase him It was something that he was extremely hurt about Karims treasured collection of letters and mementos from the Queen was destroyed He was turned out of his houses and banished to India The royal familys treatment of Abdul Karim after Queen Victorias death was far too heavyhanded and unjustified Er the fact is that he had had this friendship with the Queen To deny that friendship was to deny really the last years of the Queens life With Karims departure the traditional order and its stuffy harmony were restored in the royal household And as for Abdul he retired to his estates in Agra But the local boymadegood didnt live to enjoy his celebrity The high life had taken its toll on Abduls health He died in at the age of This is the last resting place of Hafiz Mohammed Abdul Karim He is now alone in the world His caste was the highest in Hindustan None can compare with him like his chutzpah Here was an Indian pushing himself and politically would say its extremely good to cock a snook at the royal household When you look at Abduls sort of meteoric ascent in the court think hes a very clever operator Hes incredibly impressive actually You know full marks to Abdul
