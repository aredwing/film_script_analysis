young you know Hi there old buddybud Come on Hi honey did we wake you Do you realize its in the morning Well didnt want to disturb you and Hogan very considerately asked me out Swell Swell So you just left me on the couch over there passed out like cold mashed potatoes on the couch No hard feelings pal Lets all step in and discuss it over a friendly stirring cup No were not stepping in Youre stepping out Thats no way to treat a brother Out Hogan Youre angry arent you No Why should be angry My girl out with another man leaves me without even a note to tell me where shes going to be Why should be angry Who collapsed on the couch after slaved all day over that lovely dinner was pooped Whats the matter Its a kink If you had been through what have been through today and no sleep last night Were fighting again Youre very good at definitions This is a fight All right m sorry Its my fault shouldnt have gone out Rob honey its more my fault than it was yours m exhausted and got angry No no got angry Because of that nut No got angry No it was my fault No really did Hey lets not get into a fight over who started the fight Okay Anyway were both sorry Yes Rob wed better knock that off tell you m tired and my resistance to you is low Well if youre so tired how could you even think of sex Well m not that tired Dave you get to bed And want you to get a lot of rest Yeah Rob And sleep well cause you have to go to school bright and early tomorrow morning and ve kept you up so late already Good night you gorgeous thing Whats that Nothing honey Just stubbed my toe Go to sleep now Good night Okay Sorry its just the water pipes Good night Sleep tight ll give it the big try Dont strike a match thought smelled gas Gas scurried over as fast as could to warn you Okay thanks Hogan When did you first smell the gas was out watering my flowers Theres nothing more frightening than the smell of gas She probably left this oven on Thought smelled electricity Cant be too careful Hey now that youre wide awake its as good a time as any to get into this situation between you and Robin indepth Now listen Look You got a match Early in the morning have examinations and How the hell do you keep getting in here Well your door was open It was not open Youve got a nerve What m spending all my free time trying to help you win the girl of your choice Youre standing on a legal technicality Give me the key Youre touchy Come on Come on Hogan am going to bed No no no youre not Now look you want to marry that girl am going to show you how Where do you keep your matches around here There we are Now lets get down to business First of all take the subject herself Robin dont want you to take offense son but that girl has got her clock worked in backwards So yours are perfectly all right Which confirming my earlier opinions means that what she actually seeks is a man who doesnt pamper her every desire do you follow Now Hogan at am in the morning have examinations Now gotta get some sleep okay Yeah youre darn right Now the problem is how to set the stage so that Now pay attention to me boy ve had a lot of experience in this field ll be an inestimable help How lucky can get Since this dear sweet child cannot face up to her unconscious desires its up to you to make it easy for her to face up to the unfaceable What was that again And in such a way as to make it seem to her that she herself and not you has dispelled her resistance Now you follow that Of course of course Itd never do to simply go upstairs and attack That shed be bound to look upon that with disfavor Then how about sneaking up behind her with a handkerchief soaked in chloroform What are you talking about Or a firm grip on a soft throat Brother dont think youre taking this thing seriously Now you have got to listen to me boy Its imperative Give me the key What have planned for you is a program of feigned indifference policy of reverse English shall we call it And hardly a woman alive can resist it Yeah how many more of these things do you have The supply is inexhaustible Now the thing is you are going to have to adhere to this with strict discipline boy There is to be no compliments and no whispered sweet nothings into her ear And no flowers and no candy And most important of all you must abstain from all those little niceties that women adore Do you follow me Am going too fast It sounds irresistible short period of treatment like that and she is primed for the kill if you get the picture Do you get any use out of this thing What dont understand is how youve managed to live so long Unseen forces watch over me Well your luck just ran out What do you mean Boy what is the matter with you Why do you do that Cant you see m trying to help you This girl has got cravings and desires burning deep within her Let her burn Its attitudes like that callous attitudes that make it tough on me Well might as well tell you m sick What m sick Shes going to turn to me to put out the fire and m sick of playing patsy to the entire female contingent of central California You cant go on like this Not again Look son you dont understand Look start your program right away as soon as she gets out of the shower Show your indifference by leaving her alone with me Welcome to my apartment hope you like it because want you to know that it is available to you at any time mean you might want to pop over here and do some homework or maybe get some uninterrupted sleep And ll just toot along back in and continue to lavish her with attention Of course that rules me out right away as a love object doesnt it Here simple huh Bye Be careful what youre grabbing there boy Grind away you little devil The key to happiness Please God Irene Irene Honey Irene Dave what happen Irene What happened Dave

over the head with a bottle or whatever it is didnt do it on purpose What do you think am m not sure now Well find it doesnt pay to get panicky in these situations Women are very tough you know They got much more fiber than you think Can make a suggestion The best place for this girl obviously is her own bed so why dont you just pick her up and take her home And in the meantime ll do my level best to try and calm poor Robin down You are full of helpful ideas arent you Why do you There you go again Now whats simple suggestion am going to do now Hogan what should have done the minute you stuck your nose in our lives There you go again lack of emotional control People are gonna talk about you Youd better pull yourself together Youre going to be a lousy architect Lines all zigzaggy
