military mystery that lasts for years years after Gaozu of Hans death The grand tutor Liu Xuan took his students to the site of Hongmen Banquet To look at the place where Gaozu outwitted Xiang Yu Emperor Gaozu had great reputation and authority His civil officials were all of great talents His military officials were all heroes Look Why are there are no characters on these tablets Thats weird Lets not care about those tablets start to preparing for the memorial ceremony Lets go Gaozu cornered Xiang Yu with a clever plan He mobilized his forces to Xianyang Which was unparalleled in the world By ambushing Xiang Yu on all sides in the end Gaozu totally beaten Xiang Yu And force him to commit suicide by the Wujiang River He Tutor Whose memorial tablets are these for How dare you raise such a random question while m talking Hurry up Are the sacrificial offerings for the ceremony ready yet Yes Tutor where should Emperor Gaozu sit Kid this is the result of not paying attention to my class The monarch should face south Xiang Yu used to call himself the monarch back in the days So he surely faces south Then Gaozu could only face north Since it is impossible to sit next to Xiang Yu Come here now and prepare to bow down Hurry up Your majesty Gaozu we are here to salute you Ghost dont mean to meddle Its just that saw you paying tribute To the wrong direction So feel have to You are a human being Who are you You dont think Gaozu should face north This is the memorial tablet for Gaozu Sir Then whose memorial tablets are behind Gaozus for They are the most important people in Gaozus life Then why are there no names on the tablets Right If possible Emperor Gaozu would love to write their names on Whose tablet is it on the opposite for No one other than Xiang Yu Why did Gaozu make a tablet for his biggest enemy in his life Thats nonsense The story of Liu and Xiang Should begin with the first time they met First Qin Emperor was planned to conduct imperial that day Since he got independence with violence Since people were angry about his tyranny The guarding soldiers were extraordinarily vigilant Xiang Yu and his people pretended to be Qin officials And were prepared assassinate the Qin Emperor Action My Lord Who are they Theres no time if we dont take action now Protect his majesty Who is he Take the assassins Lets shoot arrows Your Majesty Retreat Even though the assassination failed Liu and Xiang appreciated each other And formed the insurgent army together If King Huai of Chu hadnt sown discord between them They might never become enemies King Huai of Chu was just a temporary king How could he manipulate Liu and Xiang As the head of insurgent army King Huai of Chu knew that Liu and Xiang were quite ambitious Once Qin was defeated He would be useless and eliminated by them So he quickly sought help from three goddesses of war Your goddess please give me some advices to save my country Even though Xiang and Liu are fighting against Qin together now Their powers have been fully developed They will both surely covet the Qin imperial seal am now offering a stratagem where Theres only benefits for us in both situations You could issue a decree Who ever take the Qin capital Xianyang First would be the Lord of Qin They will compete for that position So you could benefit from their fight days after the issuance of decree Xiang and Liu jointly chased Qin army Forward general Xiang Bo is here find out that Jin Hu Have already taken reinforcements to outflank us They have taken off and will be here within hours If we are outflanked at both front and back We will definitely lose We have to take Chengyang Guan before they come Otherwise Left general Liu Bang will be here any minute Long Ju Pass my order to him Xiang Yu has thousands

Qin ve heard about it Zhang Han leads the last troop of Qins army He is preparing to travel fast and overnight to Xianyang to provide assistance Therefore decided to send out my troops immediately to

you Right It is my fault to make such a rash arrangements dont know how to treat intellectuals properly apologize on behalf of my lord If you want my assistance need to know your General Lius ambition The only wish of my life ls to save the country and help its people Is General Liu treating me as a three years old kid Your taking over of Xianyang city Would never save the country and help its people But the other way round The decree of the first one entering in Xianyang is the Lord of Qin Was King Huais of Chus has plan to Take advantage of the fight between you and Xiang Yu You have already put the people of Xianyang in danger of massacre But how dare Xiang Yu to violate King Huais of Chus order King Huai of Chu is only the puppet king of Xiangs family But arent all the eight vassals serving King Huai of Chu None of them would offend Xiang Yu for General Liu can close the gates of Xianyang Theres no way we will lose to Xiang Yu General Lius fight against his soldiers ls just like throwing eggs against rocks Liu Bangs only wish is to advocate justice And save common people from danger Please tell me the way to save them for the sake of common people do have a solution But dont know if you will take if or not will do whatever you say to save the people You must leave here immediately If you return this city to Xiang Yu Xiang may be happy and spare the peoples life

return the seal to Xiang tomorrow and will then leave Xianyang My Lord please reconsider Anyone violating this order will be executed General Liu you really deserve your reputation You have the benevolence of sages And magnanimity of emperors What said just now is to test you Its about peoples life have no choice but to do this Arent you one of the men sent by Xiang Yu Xiang Yu is replacing Qins tyranny with his own If he is the emperor The people will still suffer a lot Xiang Yu is about to surround Xianyang with his soldiers and attack Do you have any solution Put all the treasures away Post a royal list to let the world know that You are only taking Xianyang temporally And Xiang Yu will soon come to massacre the people of the city Xiang Yu will come to massacre the people of the city What does massacre mean It means killing everyone in the city What shall we do Lets protect our city to death Then we gather common people And military force together to protect Xianyang The common people This is a tactics to buy time Xiang Yus military counselor Fan Zeng masters the art of war If he sees the common people guarding the city He will stop Xiang Yu from attacking Xiang yang by force have a trusted friend working for Xiang Yu Who could send information for me also have six great warriors Let me introduce them to you Stop Yafu Yu have found out that Liu Bang has invited the common people to guard the Xianyang If we attack the city He will gain peoples support by fighting against Chu for common people On the other hand if we do not attack Liu Bang will enjoy Xianyangs geographical advantage This is a very good move Its from Zhang Liang Liu also make a law that all Qins All Qins treasure will be given to the people Theres only one reason for him to keep his hands off the treasure He has a bigger ambition He wants to be the emperor You have grown up son Now that Liu Bang claims he is taking Xianyang temporarily We can set up a trap We can invite him to a banquet in Xianyang Ask him to hand over the seal of Qin And assassinate him on the spot Itll be a good plan If we kill Liu Bang How are we going to explain this to King Huai of Chu havent thought about this In this case We could send somebody to assassinate King Huai of Chu first And claim its Liu who kills him Because he wants to be the emperor Then we can justify our attack in the name of revenging for King Huai thought you havent thought about this still recalled the delicious braised fish in Xianyang should eat more before losing all my teeth This is the best plan Assassin Protect Majesty Xiahou Ying Drink Fan Kuai Xiahou Ying Both of you are quite good indeed Stop Who is Zhang Liang Fan Zeng has deployed army And three days later No one can escape from Xianyang Xiang Yu will set a meeting with General Liu The place of which is still a secret So as general couldnt be prepared Clearly he wants to kill his lord On the day of Xiangs arrival at Xianyang Your friend will meet you at Zhanshen Gang You should know the place when Xiang Yu meets with Liu Bang ve found out that King Huai of Chu will rehearse the throne ceremony And Fan Zeng has already sent someone to assassinate him And then blame general Liu for it Since they want to kill King Huai of Chu We could rescue him and ask for a medallion To spare our lives Han Xin as you already know Xiang Yus assassination plan ll entrust you to accomplish this important task used to serve Xiang Yu But he doesnt appreciate me This time will help you But must get something deserve after this Its a deal How can you guarantee your promise How dare you The destiny of all the people Will be decided by the meeting between me and Xiang Yu But the result lies in three persons hands The first person is my counselor Zhang Liang Second of all is Xiang Yus Fan Zeng And the third one is you General Han My betrayal to you means betrayal to all my generals Soldiers and even the whole world General Han Do you still need my guarantee We have strong military power Why dont we attack the city right now Yu ve told you many times You should see the essence of everything What you need to take is not the city alone But the support of its people The one you should defeat is not Liu Bang alone But also yourself Yafu You have been with me once was young and You have always helped me in solving any difficulties and made decisions m not worried so long as you are here It seems that have spoiled you Does it mean that have to retire so that you could really grow up Does General Liu mention the reason he wants to see me No my lad What a pity Why Although the lutes are valuable It makes me to miss my old lute more Yes My lute How did you find it Thank you heard that Lord Xiang is coming to Xianyang Xiang Yu and have set up a meeting Do you know the cost of going to the banquet Thank you Xiang Bo for helping me You dont need to thank your sworn friend My only wish is that after conquering the violent Qin Xiang Yu and Liu Bang can both survive They can complement to each other So common people could have peace Then have you found out the place of tomorrows meeting yet Its the Hongmen Palace at Hongmen Ban My Lord Theyll be in charge of the weapons hidden in Hongmen Palace Yes Time is running out Please go back and to help General Liu Counselor the flag fell down for no reason Its Kun Gua on the upper sixth section It is an ill omen Somebody will assassinate us tonight Warriors reside in Qian while intellectuals reside in Kun The assassin is coming after me Fans wisdom is much better than mine If we can eliminate him We can defeat Xiang Yu without a fight We should focus on the key point And take the initiative to attack really want to meet this Zhang Liang Send my order to soldiers that They do not need to guard tonight In order not to alert the assassin will stay here and meet the visitor by myself have just cooked some noodles My Lord you havent eaten anything for the whole night You must eat something no matter what happens The curlybeard man hasnt returned yet He must have encountered something bad Weve heard nothing about Han Xins rescue of King Huai of Chu What should we do My Lord you must endure all the humiliation to secure the bigger picture The more advantages Xiang Yu owns The more likely he will be eaten up by his pride We should take this opportunity To tempt him to make the key mistake My lord Lord Xiangs envoy asks Lord Liu to attend the banquet now All your military forces must stay in the city and wait for order Xiao He My Lord Xiao He The result of this meeting is uncertain You should get my seal if anything bad happens Make yourself the Lord and start the undertaking again My lord All soldiers kneel down My Lord youre blessed by God And will guard Xianyang till my last breath would rather die than surrender Never surrender Never surrender Xiao He thank you so much Very good Great Protect Majesty The assassins are sent from Xiang Yu Liu Bang sent me to rescue you Who are you m Han Xin Be careful Wait All the guests to the Hongmen Banquet Are required to hand over their weapons Liu Bang is here to meet Lord

treat her carelessly Now she is being taken care by my men Liu Bang who is the owner of todays world Of course its you my Lord Do you know you have made a mistake Yes do Since Liu Bang knows his

in a good order The advance and retreat are in the right way Since we are sharing the same vision have some thoughts to share with you It has been years since Qin beat Chu However the nature has its own order and everything is repetitive Now Qin is beaten by Chu again We should also observe And implement the will of God Since Mr Zhang is so diligent and clever Why do you have to go through this trouble And act against the will of God Thank you for your advice Yi said there are good and bad times Sometimes we act sometimes we dont The winner could become loser And the good things may become

fourth round Lets fight My Lord Yu kill Liu Bang now Watch out Lord have said that earlier There is only one winner on battlefield Today god has put us together Which means there is only one of us can survive Dont blame me Liu bang My Lord Stop King Huai of Chus decree His majesty spares Liu Bangs life Liu Bang should leave Xianyang immediately and go back to Hanzhong King Huai of Chu has invited eight vassals to Xianyang To celebrate Lord Xiang becoming owner of Xianyang Yafu Zhang Liang has sent people to kill my counselor You have to kill him So we could call it even then ll let you go cant do that Today win You lose Xiang Zhuang Yes My Lord Please dont Action My lord You are making the biggest mistake Liu Bang you do know how to survive We have lost our counselor What should we do Counselor said that we have to tempt Xiang Yu To a big mistake in order to win thought weve already lost to Xiang Yu The game is not over yet The real Hongmen Banquet has finally begin Do you know The reason why Liu Bang by keep you beside him He is using you as a bargaining chip always choose to believe in others Just like you said you liked me when we first met Even though Liu Bang overstepped his authority He brought me my lute back was thinking could sing Chu songs to you again If you still have trust me Sir Yu Mr Zhangs wound has just recovered Do you think its appropriate for him to attend our meeting could leave if its inconvenient Wait Mr Zhang has chosen the right Lord to serve sincerely appreciate your help Now the war is over and your highness Becomes the owner of Qin Palace It is only you to blame if this opportunity is missed You should take the supremacy now What are you waiting for The world has just settled down And we dont yet have a good reason to claim the throne yet Besides the eight vassals would refuse to obey We still need to wait for right timing If the vassals disobey Why cant send troops to fight against them Liu Bang has just became the lord of Hanzhong It is uncertain what his moves are If he strikes us by surprise while our army is away We cant fight both ends and well lose Based on lord Xiangs military force We can totally divide the troops Since Mr Zhang is so knowledgeable How could one conquer the world on his own Why do you give us such an incomplete plan do have a plan Since Liu Bang has conceded his allegiance to you You could order him to invade the vassals Then you could use the vassals help to kill Liu Bang And be the Emperor Do you still think this is an incomplete plan Please welcome the messenger from Chu Since Lord Xiang asks us to send the army How can we disobey him Xiao He its a not easy for me to be here Please stay at Hanzhong days Well be a good host Bring up the best feast Yes He is the messenger sent by Lord Xiang Treat him nicely Yes General Serve the dishes now Fan Kuai Why are you serving the best feast Hes the envoy sent by Lord Xiang Of course we should serve the best If he is sent by counselor Fan Zeng Of course its alright He has saved my lord in numerous situations My lord owes him a great debt of gratitude However the envoy visiting now is just sent by Lord Xiang Theres no need to waste our best feast Put them away We couldnt fully trust the envoy What does Mr Zhang think We should test Fan Zeng again So as not to blame the wrong guy Counselor Our scout said Liu Bang is sorting out his army think we should take a preemptive attack To spare future troubles After all Liu Bang has special amnesty from King Huai of Chu We need to find an excuse to kill Liu Bang King Huai of Chu is always a trouble Why dont we kill him first You mean killing King Huai of Chu Didnt you ask me to kill King Huai of Chu during Hongmen Banquet Yu times has changed Counselor Does it apply to your loyalty to our Xiang family too You are making the biggest mistake Lord Xiang wants to see you My lord You and your family Have always treated me with respect And listened to my opinions Thats all our counselors want The fact that you want to see me today Means that you still cherish our relation Thats enough for me All good things must come to an end want to give you a bag of tips before go If you experience danger Or think of me in the future You could open it and have a look Yafu Sir Zhang Liang you are here know youll come cant wait too long My apology have pushed the limit too far this time Zhang Liang You have made a brilliant move this time knew you were special during the Hongmen Banguet can tell you now You are just like the me when was young Dont feel bad for me ve been waiting for an opponent like you my whole life Enemies are like the two sides of a mirror Just like Xiang Yu and Liu Bang or you and me Dont waste any more time Lets finish the fifth game Sir sir Sir Zhang Liang There is a kind of chess game May Zhang Liang a survivor of Han Present to my Lord that the general Should be able to distinguish peoples qualities before he learns the art of war Counselor Fan Zeng has served three generations of Xiang family But he was discarded like a homeless dog We all feel bitterly disappointed for this Good birds choose the best trees to rest will go back to Liu Bangs camp Hope Lord Xiang will make careful decisions So as not to die alone Get the army and horses ready Lets act now Yes my Lord My lord Liu Bang is at Hanzhong Based on his army force even if he has Zhang Liang to assist him He wont be a threat to us as long as we dont act rashly Xiang Bo know you are kind Even if dont eliminate Liu today He will eventually eliminate me one day said it was all meant to be at the Hongmen Banquet There is only one could survive between Liu Bang and What if King Huai of Chu stops us again General Han My Lord Xiang Yu has killed King Huai of Chu People all hate him The eight vassals would like to help me to suppress him General Han How many soldiers can my Lord lead at most Less than Then how can you control the eight vassals How about you For me the more the merrier Having completed the mission need to get what should deserve It seems like have underestimated Liu Bang know cant stop you from fighting But ll go through the war with you Stop chasing Itll be too late if you dont leave now How dare you all try and stop me Please dont go My Lord Whats that place in the front of us It is Wu River Heres Wu city My Lord Your ladyship This is Liu Bangs secret order He has ordered the allies to attack tomorrow He persuades me not to make this unnecessary sacrifice Youve surrendered to Liu Bang just want peace in the world And good relations between the Xiang Yu and Liu Bang Theres nothing can do now Its meaningless to stay in this war Success or failure is all depending on an attitude Theres only you Yu Ji who can persuade Xiangyu to leave really regret that havent held your hand like this more often We could start again Yu Ji We have come to the end Look at this land It will be full of Liu Bangs army very soon have asked Xiang Bo to take you to a safe place Where no one can find you including me But you have promised that could stay with you think You should have a second Chance to choose Prepare to fight This
