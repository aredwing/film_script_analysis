Christmas Next Christmas If we fell glorious with a bit of a flourish we would have a respectable end and not dwindle away at some nameless paltry secondSundayafter such and such When we introduce the harmonium into the church it will not be that fiddles were bad but that a harmonium was better Next Christmas then No no Thats far too late for me You will have a few weeks grace before Miss Day is
