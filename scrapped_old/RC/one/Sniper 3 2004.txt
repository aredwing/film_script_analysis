suffered nerve damage when you lost the finger The condition has been steadily deteriorating ever since The digitorum tendon when functioning normally flexes and extends the finger But here on the

Thanks Tom His body was shipped home What was left of the body body Its a long story Tom Let me try to explain some of it During the last days before the fall of Saigon Paul Finnegan was recruited Recruited by who The His first op was to help the Khmer Rouge run heroin out of the highlands His cut financed the covert operations As the years passed our interests changed Finnegan was offered a new op but the jungle had changed him That patriotic fervor had changed into something else something that makes him dangerous Hes a threat To you me his family and his country Welcome to the tunnels Tommy What the hells he doing here Is there any other way to handle this deal or an arrangement Theres no other way Weve learned the Ho Chi Minh Police have set up a sting to capture him That cannot happen If he is identified you can imagine the problems that we might face The explanations Not to mention the effect on his family his son Youre asking me to kill the man who saved my life know how incredibly bizarre this must seem to you Tom but believe me this is not the man that you once knew Over the years he has become a coldblooded killer And m ashamed to say we bear some responsibility for that and an obligation to rectify the mistake As a sniper you have the option to refuse the mission But need an answer Tom By ll understand if you cant do this ll find somebody else No ll do it Alone want no observer with me dont want anybody elses hand in it How can you be so sure hell do it when the time comes One way or another he will get the job done Its all hes got left His life isnt

were higher than kites Smoking and hunting for three days without sleep There was nine of them Six men and three women When it was done we started getting paranoid Wed make York destroy the film But as the days passed Gaylor and Avery kept getting more and more psycho on me So we made a pact the three of us And then we killed Stevie and made it look like the did it So what now Tommy Whats our next move Tell you what You could just walk out of here and go home If leave the cop goes with me Go get out Beckett You know cant let that happen Youre going to have to kill me The only way see it from here is to kill him Whats your old saying One shot one kill How about one shot two kills milliontoone Isnt that what they used to say Do it Theyre gonna kill me anyway Hes right Tommy Take your best shot The digitorum tendon flexes and extends the finger Times running out for one of us Come on Tommy make your move Whats happening here They say youre the Mongoose Come again The Mongoose Its

theres not a chopper to evac me out then ll guess was wrong about you You too Youre one hell of a shot Was In breaking news today it was learned that Senator John Gaylor from Texas has resigned his seat in the Senate In his statement read by a spokesman the Senator said he has decided to end his political aspirations and enter the private sector His resignation came as a complete surprise to the
