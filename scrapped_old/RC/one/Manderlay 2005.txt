It was in the year of and Grace and her father were heading southward with their army of gangsters After leaving Dogville they had returned to Denver only to find that the mice had been well and truly playing while the cat was away and new forces had taken over their former possessions The result was a particularly unappealing retreat that had brought them through the state of Alabama this spring in search of new hunting grounds Now they will not admit it but its a fact Deep down inside there isnt a woman alive who doesnt nurture these fantasies whether they involve harems being hunted through the jungle by torchbearing natives However much they go on and on about civilization and democracy sexy it aint Grace and her father had resumed their legendary discord even as they pulled out of Dogville and although Grace had been employing the technique of letting things go in one ear and out the other for a pretty long time now she was to be frank somewhat weary of her unbearably overweening daddy who still believed any nagging woman could be pacified with a good old bouquet of carnations bet you wouldnt have had the guts to talk like that if Mother had been alive No Youre right my girl would not Were goins boss Miss Lady Can talk to you Can talk to you Miss They gonna whip him knew they would It just aint true he aint stole nothin They put that Rhenish wine from Mams bedside table in his cabin just to give em something to whip him for Thats the law one bottle and its a whippin Thats Mams law What are you talking about Who Who are they gonna whip Timothy Why Thats how they do us slaves Slaves Yes maam Surely you heard of slaves Its what we is at Manderlay This godforsaken place Thats how got out When a whippins in the offin they take out a section of the fence Listen Grace its a local matter Its not for us to poke our noses in Why should we not poke our noses in just because its a local matter Its certainly not our responsibility You think the Negroes wanted to leave their homes in Africa Wasnt it us who brought them to America We have done them a great wrong Its our abuse that has made them what they are Untie him Stop Fraid not lady Slavery was abolished years ago If you wont obey that law of your own accord we will compel you to do so Help me get her inside Get water for Mam Act quickly Rose Spare me your hypocrisy You dumb old slave Get out Leave us alone If youre looking for sympathy dont expect any from me Listen m very old unfortunately dying should like to ask you for a favor If it involves allowing you to go on exploiting these people like slaves m sorry ll just have to say no no matter how dying you are Slaverys over now can see that It had to come one day All right ll probably refuse you but you might as well ask Theres a book under my mattress should like you to retrieve it and burn it for me It would be best for everyone m sure you think so But its my view that anything no matter what is best served by being brought out into the open beg you one woman to another Woman to woman makes no difference to me The sins of the past are sins cannot and do not wish to help you erase Now must leave you believe my fathers men have unlocked the gates Now everybody can come and go as they please Please let everyone else know on the plantation that from now on they can all enjoy the same freedoms as any other citizen of this country The Constitution can be found at any courthouse And heres a tip for when you sue the family Theres a weighty written evidence concealed in this very room Shes dead The old devil Oh m sorry didnt mean it Missy No no if any of us deserves an apology its not me m afraid Theres nothing to be afraid of Weve taken all the familys weapons No m afraid of what will happen now fear we aint ready for a completely new way of life At Manderlay we slaves took supper at When do people take supper when theyre free We dont know these things Free men eat when theyre hungry Free women as well Considering the times and the situation Graces words in the dead womans room on mealtimes for free citizens might have seemed a trifle overspirited We should not believe that there lay any content in these words for the wretched and starving people of America Grace rejoined the gangsters who had indeed concluded their disarmament of the plantations powers that had been though their findings were meager the shotgun and an old toy pistol All right we can go Lets just wait a moment What are you waiting for For them to come and thank you Or for them to burn the whole place down and dance some tribal dance on the ruins by the glow of the torchlight You are a bigot Daddy and you always have been We owe these people We brought them here we abused them we made them what they are admit dont do deals with the Japs Cant trust em when theres big money at stake But a bigot Well why dont they come out Thats exactly what you said last time Last time Remember when you were six You thought it was so sad that your beloved Tweety was all shut up in a cage and nobody could persuade you not to let him out Tweety was a proud little bird Well his dignified exit didnt do Tweety a hell of a lot of good We found him the next morning underneath your window frozen to death know Hed been bred as an indoor bird He really didnt have a chance And what do you think those Negroes in there are How many generations do you think those families made their homes behind that fence bet you most of them have taken up employment in their former jobs with the family contracts and all Of course now theyll get a few dollars for their efforts but theyll soon drink that up and maybe theyll borrow a bit more from their employers who have no doubt opened a little store full of colorful wares just for them And of course theyll never be able to pay back the money and theyll be trapped yet again What you did was all very noble my girl but when push comes to shove youve just made everything far worse just as you did with Tweety So all we can do is hope theres no frost What you said about contracts and loans thats fraud Fraud See ve read that Yes freed slaves are given a mule and a plot of land so that they can establish themselves Yep thats true But when it came down to it the fella who owned the mule and the land had rather keep it all for himself so nothing really ever happened with it Anyhow it may take them a while to gather the evidence against the plantation for when the family goes on trial Trial Taterpie there are times when you seem even less with it than your dear mother Oh seem to have underestimated em Weve at least one man with a genuine thirst for freedom and hes gettin out and hes in a hurry Yeah hes hightailin it all right Yeah thats Gramps Pardon me Not a lot of dignity there Hes scared out of his wits Would it be possible to have a word with the young lady Yes yes Dont mean to inconvenience you Thats exactly what youre doin Youre not inconveniencing anyone This is a grave day for everyone know that just thought we mustve seemed a mite bit ungrateful We should like to thank you properly for what youve done Itll only take a moment Yes of course Ten minutes Then m gone Not a second longer Grace was conducted through the wretched living quarters bestowed upon the slaves with their pitiful leaky cabins Her actions would comprise an unconditional enrichment of these peoples lives There was no doubt about that Or was there Actually Grace did not see much of the glow she had hoped for the glow that couldve convinced her that no one would end up like her little pale yellow canary These were human beings but of the kind on whom pain had been inflicted Grace thought as she was suddenly interrupted by a strangely exotic accent When we were slaves we were not required to offer thanks for our supper and for the water we drink and the air we breathed Nobody needs to say thank you but But what mean there is something we ought to be thankful for didnt mean but meant and And Theres no reason to be grateful for anything as natural as your freedom m the first to apologize for everything you and your people have been subjected to See those gates shouldve been unlocked years ago Only years ago But before that of course they were completely justified No No no you misunderstand me What can say You need say nothing at all Weve heard of your kind Youre a society lady who spends her time rescuing wretched niggers should like to say thank you Missy done give her time and effort to helpin us Time ll bet she couldve spent on all kinds of different things Cause was perfect justice when God made some of us slaves and not others The nigra is vile by nature know it aint popular to say so and it aint cause of Bert that say so Hmm No Victoria did not base her perception exclusively on her experience of her husband though God knows it weighed heavily Bert was a useless eejit whose character Victoria regrettably so far in vain had done her best to improve by hitting him with any implement at hand on any given occasion no matter how much he had threatened to take his own life by throwing himself into Manderlays deep well Grace looked at Wilhelm the old house slave and understood He had not brought her here for anybody to thank her He just wanted her to see them all the unfortunate flock that he very rightly feared would have few chances beyond the perimeter fence Living proof of the devastating power of oppression Listen up Yes sir This has all been put on paper just needed to check the wording first again as these things are legal and binding Bingo What are these Dont rightly know maam Theyre the contracts maam The family has been so considerate to offer us all employment Grace was not a lawyer and unqualified to assess the validity of the contract she held in her hand but she feared that unfortunately any judge in the county would deem it fair and proper It appeared to Grace that instead of employee they might just as well have retained the old term of slave body would only sign it if he or she was utterly ignorant of life in liberal society or if he or she really had no choice Folks suppose that youre in urgent need of cash Mark Cash once knew this fella from a little township nobody know the name of so there aint no grounds to mention what it was called He had cash Not piles of it We are prepared to lend you some money as covered by this other piece of paper and we can also set up a little store here if you like After all its a long way to town And if you buy enough for all of us bet youre liable to get a real nice bulk discount and the goodsll be cheaper than in town Aint that right Miss Grace have no idea Please sign everybody What this be What it is All right Lets go Turn it off Damn it Daddy you said that didnt have the power to help Tweety You were right was a child then So what is it this time This time have the power to act You said so back in Dogville that your power would be mine too and that could use it in my own way That power was to carry on the family farm That was open to new ideas The power you ask for now will undoubtedly be applied to something thats foolish at best Daddy you promised Oh You were a bastard to Mother but when you promised her something she got it Okay Youve been given what promised you Maybe things havent been split right down the middle but this is as far as m prepared to go want nothing to do with your plans And you wont be able to get in touch with me if anything goes wrong and you need me as usual to get you out of trouble because fortunately my dear youll have no idea where am Daddy d like to take Joseph as well No need a lawyer to sort out some paperwork No No Never Never d never let Joseph go Hes the only man know who can draw up a contract so theres only one possible interpretation and though havent needed that talent as of yet still might need it one day ll give you Viggo and Bruno for him Never ve given you my best associates and you know it Daddy was meant to have been given half If Mother had been alive Oh damn it Grace So that very day and into the early hours Joseph employed the celebrated unambiguous phrases his previous employer had given him so wretchedly little opportunity to practice New contracts needed drawing up and old ones needed nullifying all with the astonishing good will that parties always evince in the company of rapidfiring machine pistols These were the deeds of gift You transfer the property to the former slaves in joint ownership The last document is your contract of employment by this community Employment dont quite get what you mean by that Itll be without pay and the right of termination is rather onesidedly in the hands of the employer but nevertheless Manual labor for you and your family and Mr Mays Hard labor Say something Bingo My fathers back aint so strong He climbed up to reach the chandelier one Christmas day and he fell off the banister and struck a table Well thats what happens when youve got chandeliers When consider that your understanding of the worth of other human beings has reached the desirable stage you and Mr Mays and your family will be allowed to go Go And leave our home Yes And assure you that even starting from scratch your prospects will be a lot better than your former labors would have been With regards to the presence of me and my men well only act as your counselors The guns are merely a precaution in case of any threats to the new community We intend to stay here but only until the first harvest is home after which any of the new shareholders who wishes to do so may cash in his or her deed of gift and receive a dividend All right will you collect your deeds Mark Nobody was particularly enthusiastic or confident about these latenight legal formalities Victoria Flora But Grace could see beyond this and if she saw little else than fear and disquiet in all these eyes at least she saw gratitude in one single pair namely in Wilhelms mild old gaze Bert Got a deed of gift here that aint been accepted Will Mr Bert approach forthwith and take delivery of his deed of gift Mr Bert Mr Berr Bert had actually prepared his escape from his ferocious wife Despite her lack of faith in his abilities Bert had succeeded in meeting a woman through the fence and she had agreed to help him to abscond And there he was waiting at the agreed place at the agreed time helping hand the woman had said What a peculiar coincidence that two women should come to the aid of the Manderlay slaves at the same time Grace and Berts helping hand And the similarities between them were also peculiar Young beautiful white in male company Actually male company in alarming numbers Wheres the nigger Grace had moved into the freed plantation among its new shareholders She was there as a guard no more But no one could stop her from using this beautiful spring to make her own little observations on the people of Manderlay in the hope of spotting the burgeoning change in character that freedom ought to bring But unfortunately she saw little of just that She saw Victoria for the third time looking down the well in hope of a glimpse of the body of Bert She saw Flora and Elizabeth swooning for Timothy as ever She saw the men spending their time on card games playing for tufts of blue cotton under their leaky roof And she saw how everybody would ignore the eager Mark whenever he opened his mouth not knowing that he was notorious for never being able to give an intelligible answer to anything Well we called him Puddin Head but his real name wasnt Puddin Head Grace saw Victoria beating her eldest son for stealing a moldy cookie And she saw the unstoppable irrevocable hierarchy of the beatings Victoria beating Ed Ed beating Milton and Milton Willie who finally vented his frustration further down the food chain on Claire who far too rarely managed to make use of the window with the outside handle that her loving father Jack had installed as an emergency entrance Which also allowed her to fall asleep every night to her favorite view of the twinkling stars Every noontide Grace witnessed with pity how the former slaves were arrayed on the parade ground with mysterious numbers and marks beneath Mams balcony as if nothing at Manderlay had changed However one of them did not submit to this alltoosoothing power of habit Timothy of course In a flash his exotic pride almost took Graces breath away This day Grace walked on past the old peach house where the whites were now detained put to work on sundry more or less needless little repairs on her way to the barn housing her gangsters So hows everyone doing m afraid the men got nothing to do and its not so good for the morale In situations like that your father always came up with something bet he did But its patience thats required Not this much patience Niels says Niels grandpa was a cotton grower and he says the cotton should have been sown ages ago The soil doesnt look ready Might be because nobodys plowed it Maybe things are different here from where your grandpa lived No maam Dont reckon so Well if if it shouldve been sown surely the people here would be the first to know As she did not want to impose Graces intercourse with the former slaves had been limited to brief greetings and the like But now it was time for a talk with some meat to it Excuse me Sir Mark May ask you something Its about planting the cotton ve been around for sowin and harvestin and birth and death Right So when should the cotton be planted Theres strict rules for that You cant mess around with that sort of thing Manderlay has always been renown for the precision of its harvest The swallows always migrate right afterwards They settle here for the night on their way across the marshes But the planting Its a science my dear lady and the weather which you might have expected plays a fearsome role Yes yes And when will it be time this year Not too soon and not too late Yes but when Should the cotton have already been planted m not the sort of fella to pass on information unless m damn sure of it Unless the facts of the matter are In other words the facts need be beyond dispute You know when to plant No better ask Wilhelm Is he in his cabin This mornin he went down to the bathhouse Hed gotten a little frayed around the edges as they say Its a funny thing m sorry ll go find him myself Excuse me Wilhelm ve come about the fields The fields shouldve been plowed and harrowed three weeks ago and the cotton planted two weeks ago But does everybody know that Oh yes But reckon they thinkin somebody else oughta go out in the field first In the old days Overseer Mays wouldve driven us out there Maybe its because nobody really trusts you Missy Yeah But Wilhelm they could be doing something else instead Repairs to their homes They badly need it The cabins have always been a sore spot But Mam said we aint got no materials to fix em up But were going to need what we make on the cotton How else will people survive on their own Yeah if folks felt they was given somethin something brought out by this these new times that made their lives better in a convincing way right here and now dont know what that might be but But we dont have time for that Weve been forced to sow late before The harvest might be improved if we planted a bit late Even says that in Mams Law Mams Law Yes Mams Law Its all the rules for running the plantation But we werent allowed to read it It was just for Mam and the family Only for Mam and the family Grace thought Certainly no more And there on Mams bed skimming through the old book wellfilled with bizarre and vicious regulations she came upon a page that looked strangely familiar table with numbers from one to seven Somewhere Grace had seen something similar for sure Mams Law revealed it all The Manderlay plantation with its glamorous front mansion and pitiful rear where the slaves had their quarters had been kept in an iron grip by these very numbers They represented the psychological division of the Manderlay slaves Sammy was a Group a Clownin Nigger The formidable Victoria was of course a Number a Hittin Nigger No wonder her husband Bert had found it necessary to accept a helping hand even if it was another color from his own Wilma and Mark were Losin Niggers Wilhelm was a a Talkin Nigger Flora was a Weepin Nigger Et cetera et cetera There were Pleasin Niggers and Crazy Niggers by the dozen The final category Number Proudy Niggers consisted nowadays of Timothy as expected who was of course not there And Elizabeth No It said not She was a Pleasin Nigger also known as a chameleon a person of the kind who could transform herself into exactly the type the beholder wanted to see This was how the slave system had been kept alive for so long at Manderlay bondage even through psychology As Grace in deep thought gazed across the fields of Manderlay she recalled another page in Mams Law dealing exclusively with the weeding of the paths in the romantic Old Ladys Garden the name of the narrow band of woodland that skirted the plantation Trees and tree trunks Grace thought So there were materials at Manderlay after all Excuse me May ask you all something Isnt it true that somebody whos even poor and colored can still take the trouble to maintain their home How dare you You think colored folks prefer holes in their roofs and wallowing in mud Then all you need to do is to mend those holes But told you There aint never been no materials for that kind of thing at Manderlay No materials Thats not true When m in the fields see timber wherever look just waiting to be turned into boards for a roof or an extension or maybe even a whole new cabin That be Mams garden You cant cut that down Then why cant we cut down The Old Ladys Garden Have you really spent that many happy hours up there on your knees weeding her romantic paths Thats true Theres loads of timber We aint seen it as anything but The Old Ladys Garden dont know what you think but to me it sounds like a splendid idea And at a stroke these seated reclining resting people had turned into people going full tilt walking running working people without anyone having to threaten them in the slightest with The Ladys Hand as Grace had been told the great whip was called And Grace had won a kind of victory small beginning of something that would one day erase all the negative inherited behavior patterns of Manderlay But as Grace had suspected the appetite for improving the living quarters unfortunately exceeded that for preparing the fields few of the former slaves had volunteered and with the white family and Grace herself they made up a sort of gang to prepare the soil for the seeds under the gaze of a demonstratively hostile Timothy with his mysterious white handkerchief He wasnt born here Hes a Munsi Its a line of African royalty Its a very proud line He dont drink either or gamble like the others be doin with their little blue tufts of cotton money It was Mams Law We werent allowed no real money Grace knew about the clever system of currency in Mams Law Not real money that you could use in the outside world The Munsi dont gamble cause they dont believe in winnings They believe you have to be humble to your crops and only take whats absolutely necessary ve never heard of these Munsi before but do believe once heard of the Mansi They different They was slaves of African kings They gamble They is true mischief Timothy say So Timothy has prejudices as well What Oh nothing was just thinking aloud So you find company Flora No no was on my way out anyway Timothy Let me tell you one thing know you dont like me and dont trust me and can see why Although our ideals differ you have a pride within you that believe will one day be the salvation of everybody at Manderlay Let me tell you one thing too You got fine words a posse of gangsters and your white skin somethin folks here seem to fall for but aint fooled Youre not interested in us not as human beings After all its tough telling people apart when theyre from another race We whites have committed an irreparable crime against an entire people Manderlay is a moral obligation because we made you Luckily m just a nigger who dont understand such words Now if youll excuse me ve come here for the company of my girl and that aint nothing for you to see Black hides meeting And if were you would leave now before things get too nasty Grace regarded Timothys hostility as a challenge and the very next day she took a step to dispel his claim that as a white she was incapable of caring for blacks as individuals Shed had a chat with Venus about her somewhat maladjusted son Jim Venus had revealed that Jims behavior was merely that of a budding but frustrated artist Tell me have you seen Venus Nobody here wants your charity have something for Jim ve had a really good look at his face since our little chat and youre right It does possess an artists sensitivity This is far too much No no no Go on call him These are for him Jim come on out here with me and Miss Grace baby These are for you because we believe in you Now run along and paint your fantastic pictures Never mind those closeminded folks who think they know what art is meant to look like Give them hell from me Jim Excuse me but aint Jim m Jack Thats Jim It is tricky As a matter of fact ve never been able to tell them apart either Theyre both colored and they both got curly hair Why look any deeper than that To be honest Grace had never been quite sure which was Jim and which was Jack a blunder that would in her former life among her fellow whites merely have occasioned a little laughter Thank you maam In her life at Manderlay it was disastrous But like her father she did not take long to transform a defeat into anger energy and a counterattack This this is what has created all this resistance Even you regard it as almost sacred dont you must admit its played a right important part in my life That will be my next move They shall be allowed to see it and understand that it cant do them any more harm wouldnt advise it Missy Presenting it to them would be like showing the child the rod with which its been beaten agree it must be made public but we aint all ripe for it All right Then we shall have to see about ripening you and quickly m not talking about the couple of cozy meetings ve organized to which hardly anybody turned up mean teaching with a timetable oldfashioned handson schooling All right ve got something for you to do at last It even involves bossing people about At noon tomorrow m going to give my first lesson to all of the former slaves of Manderlay Itll be your job to make sure theyre there No excuse for not showing up And the family No theyre pretty well teaching themselves Are you listening to me Its cause Niels just got a great hand What Who are you My name is Dr Hector Do excuse me a moment ll have to pay my way out of this round God knows dont believe you possess any cards of real significance You have a poker players face You can see here my entire enterprise must say ve never gained access to Manderlay before So when drove by today and saw the gates were open took it as a sign of new times What exactly do you do entertain Party games card games and the like Well nowadays mainly the latter You play for money But do more than play cheat And you have no objections to revealing this business secret of yours Oh to some people but not to you No no you see if you and establish the business relationship m anticipating youll be happy to know exactly what to expect And what can expect Eighty percent You certainly know all the problems that arose when our beloved New Deal was imposed in Plantation owners had plenty of land but nobody to work it So they contracted with the former slaves But they just didnt have the same hold on the rascals that they had in the old days Of course they lent them money But quite a few of the nigras actually saved up and paid off their debts So the plantation owners got worried bet they did Oh yeah Thats where my idea came in went from plantation to plantation with the full backing of the plantation owners to entertain their employees and they were sorely in need of diversion let me tell ya We just had a little game of cards If anyone was close to repaying his debt would take the shirt off their back And am prepared to offer you that very same service today maam You are not convinced Let me give you another token of my profound loyalty have here a letter from a man by the name of Stanley He asked me to smuggle it out Thought perhaps youd like to see it before its mailed Listen Mr Hector Let me just say that have never met a man whom have instantly despised so wholeheartedly both for his personality and his occupation Does that mean youre turning down my offer never want to see you here again All right Well am disappointed shall nevertheless bestow upon you my thought for the day indulge in word games like to give my clients something to laugh or think about when leave The best technique for a card sharp is dealing from the bottom Look as if youre dealing from the top of the deck but instead you just take the bottom card one that you know Taking from the bottom means something else entirely in social terms But it is what do take from the bottom It wont be hard to find me if you change your mind The letter was aimed at a Mr Miller one of the truckers who picked up cotton from Manderlay and the plantations only real contact with the outside world It was short and to the point We are being held prisoner by gangsters and coloreds at Manderlay Inform the police and please come to our aid with all due dispatch Indignation is a rare emotion for a gangster but a state of just that was what Graces men experienced while they herded the colored people in for their lesson that day as Grace had reported on Dr Hectors cheap trick of taking from the bottom It was hardly the sophisticated ambiguity of the term that had affected them so dramatically Welcome to our lesson Yes call it a lesson as the term meeting seems to have scared some people out of attending was comin but was late Very late You hadnt made it by the time we finished In the old days we could hear the bell from the old clock in the hall It was easy to keep up with time but we never hear it no more Probably because nobody winds it up But now for the topic of this lesson Working together Only four people from your wing helped to prepare the fields and only five helped to plant m not a shareholder in this enterprise but if had been and if d also been one of the five would have felt cheated Democracy means government by the people But as its not practical for everyone to sit in Congress a method by which people may express their views is required This method is called a ballot All right So lets try it out We should choose a problem Anything anyone cant decide on If may suggest a small matter Please do reckon the little broken rake is mine but Flora reckons its hers Its my rake Thats an excellent suggestion Its a great example assume you all know of this dispute and all feel able to have an opinion on it Who does the community think owns the rake It could turn out to belong to both parties equally That would correspond nicely with the subject of this lesson Working together sharing together All right so who thinks its Elizabeths rake Sammy think think its Elizabeths rake All right all right Slowly the point of Graces edifying discourse dawned on the majority Most of them thought the rake was definitely Elizabeths few that it was Floras and nobody that it could be shared still remain undecided whether the rake is Elizabeths or Floras Right So not surprisingly neither party receives Marks vote From now on the little broken rake belongs to Elizabeth Thats what ballots are like there are winners and there are losers But the community has spoken And now Grace embarked on a protracted explanation of Floras difficulties raking without a rake and that owning things together could have its advantages To make sure that everyone understood the democratic principle the meeting carried out another ballot at Jims suggestion wanna talk about the fact that Sammy be laughin so loud at his own jokes and they aint funny And m tryin to get some sleep and cant get no sleep cause he laughs so loud Mmmm Maybe perhaps there can be a time when he can stop his jokes and stop laughin so we can get some sleep You cant vote on a mans laughter You cant vote on a mans laughter surely m hearing that its at sundown At sundown Thats what m hearing So lets do a vote All right so thats settled Yeah it is It is Thats democracy Finally Wilhelm proposed that it would be practical if somebody was responsible for winding up the clock with its small but penetrating chimes And for mysterious reasons the probing though fairly passive artist Jim was appointed despite the song and dance his mother kicked up He cant do it Grace wound up the lesson by announcing that the topic for the next day would be Our anger and how to communicate it Maybe somebody would at least tell me what the time is Ask Timothy He always know what time it is He tell by the sun He always do that Or we can always ask Wilhelm Hes so old hes from before the clock ever got here So Wilhelm and Timothy each made his own suggestion as to what the time was and they were astonishingly close Wilhelm thought it was eight minutes to Timothy thought it was five minutes to Grace rejoiced quietly at this natural ability they found so straightforward But rapidly two factions emerged one which insisted it was eight minutes to and the other would not hear of anything but five minutes to They were thus able to draw on the days learning and put it to the vote The result was five minutes to by a small majority And so it was decided The official time at Manderlay was five minutes to Five Graces first lesson of the day took place in relative good humor But the second onethe one that had unfortunately proved unavoidable was severer in character Read Daily ration of food for slaves from Category Oh Oh no is Six ounces of solid food And theyve always been given just that no matter how little there was in the stores Thats a lot less than Category for example Why should a Proudy Nigger have less to eat than an EyePleasin one How can the way your head seems to be arranged have anything to do whatsoever with the amount people are given to eat really dont know either Not precisely Do you Mr Mays It could be just to punish them for their pride No just did what it said It mattered a lot to my mother that we follow these rules know of many places where everybody got quite a bit less than six ounces and where they began to eat dirt Its a kind of custom coloreds have when foods scarce round here But it was forbidden under Mams Law Thats not what were discussing here Dont you see what an affront it is to divide people up like that Folks is different Oxen and rabbits dont need equal shares of fodder neither Both parties would come down with bellyaches Stop it m not at all satisfied with what ve heard here today Youre all speaking up for this foolishness m going to have to penalize you because so little effort has been made in these lessons That evening Grace thought that her idea of making the whites make up their faces which had seemed so just and edifying in her flash of anger that afternoon was perhaps a tad too much in the wrong direction Even though Philomena herself in her own childhood would not have dreamt of going to the toilet without the entertainment of her black nanny Look at your Uncle Jim Hes in the bathtub learning how to swim Can we clean our faces now Yes Yes of course Well Here comes the dust Then none of this will matter anymore What do you mean Theres gonna be a dust storm The plants have only just begun to grow It couldnt be worse But Manderlays fields have never been harmed by a dust storm Cause the windbreak was still in place Grace was not inclined to go into what the former overseer meant by these mysterious words Soon she had convinced herself they had no meaning at all apart from spreading disquiet and despondency The next days lesson on the importance of unleashing ones anger met little understanding from the assembly It was when they wound up with a series of ballots and the community had rapidly decided to use Wilmas potatoes for seed as she was so old and did not have to eat that much that they heard the wind Jack where you goin He goin to get Lucifer The dust had come at this time for as long as anybody could remember But every year from time immemorial it had spared the newly planted cotton as the plantation had been cleverly shielded by a narrow band of trees known in common parlance as The Old Ladys Garden In the midst of the almost biblical darkness that descended on Manderlay Grace knew all too well that even hand in hand with all the races of the world no army of gangsters could counter this Natures extravagant demonstration of power All she could do was watch as row upon row of the seedlings she had so welcomed disappeared beneath the devastating dust Nobody could do a thing But apparently it did not mean that no one would try for now Grace discerned a rider out there He was riding like crazy As he progressed across the fields wherever he spotted a pile of dust beginning to grow he would break it up with his horses hooves Whether it would make the slightest dent in the grand scale of things was hard to tell but it was a battle no matter how senseless it might be heroic and dangerous Timothy Come back Come back Timothy Timothy Timothys gonna be all right He knows these storms Miss Grace yous head over heels for him Yous a fool Miss Grace Whered you find him He was behind the house Is he alive do believe know what you mean by that question But what does it mean to be alive It means is he breathing Forget it Is he dead We colored folks can be awfully hard to kill if we want it that way That very afternoon strong Timothy was back on his feet surveying the buildings for damage caused by the storm The dust had struck a devastating blow Unfortunately hardest hit were the food stores in the dilapidated Peach House which had lost its roof Almost all of their provisions were now inedible On top of that the pneumonia brought by the dust was inevitable The dust had got in everywhere particularly where no new boards could have provided weatherproofing namely through the cracked glass in the window on the stars above Claires bed Valuables not to mention cash were nonexistent at Manderlay since the elegant clock miraculously still ticking merrily away on the mantelpiece turned out to be not Swiss as Mam believed but a copy made quite locally and worth practically nothing The Freed Enterprise of Manderlay was bust Wilhelm and Grace were therefore under no illusions that anybody would attend class this day But then one by one the Manderlay flock began to appear m happy youre all here But dont really have a lecture for you today d just like to say how badly feel about this hopeless situation But of course words arent much use to you No Missy has learned that much at least But as regards hopelessness it is something we do know a bit about There are a million plants out there beneath the dust If we can save but of them perhaps we can grow a small quantity of great quality and get a better price for it reckon we should make a move And that is how the greatest disaster turned into a stroke of luck for Grace and how the people with a common foe the dust as their excuse suddenly found themselves working shoulder to shoulder with their deadliest enemy to achieve the common goal as free grownup Americans Stanley and Bertie had sown the fields with little sticks so people could tell where to uncover the tender seedlings While Flora ever so childishly kept teasing Grace with her digs at Graces supposed romantic feelings towards Timothy Good night old Wilma Good night child We can lie down and talk for a while before we go to sleep No thank you Wilma m not weary enough to go to bed yet little walk helps walk when a body aint sleepy is a very good thing do the same myself Good night Good night That everything seemed as moving along on its own could be nothing but welcomed by Grace But her lack of an active part to play had suddenly left her in a kind of vacuum and allowed other things inside her to claim attention Human things like instincts and emotions An ominous sense of homelessness and loneliness struck Grace this evening As she wandered about Grace suddenly found herself outside the wooden rear of the bath house Without warning the homelessness transferred into a strange desire to move up that rusty pipe against the flow of dirty water into where naked bodies were being washed in cheap soap Black skin Male and black manhood What Grace had felt at the bath house was undignified shameful Her mind was meant to be devoted to policy at Manderlay a matter in which these thoughts had no business whatsoever Grace had forced herself to sleep to rid her thoughts of those black bodies an achievement that was actually possible thanks to the stubbornness that flourished in Graces family But the cotton seedling in her lovestarved body did not give up It manifested itself as a dream Grace was in southern climes There were women in exotic costumes and men in turbans Even in her sleep she hated with a passion any idea of allowing that her father might be right But it was a harem group of black slaves appeared bearing a huge charger piled with dates and in a twinkling Grace lay among the dates trembling with pleasure as a flock of Bedouin satisfied her one by one with their noses And it was even more confusing when Timothy appeared and was both the slave bearing wine hands shaking and the sheik himself whose authoritative hands tested the size of Graces most intimate orifices must have overslept m sorry Claires had another turn Yeah Yeah shes running a bad fever again Has she had anything to eat Oh sure Pork chops and baked chicken Shes taken a little oatmeal but its hard to get it into her She had this trouble with her lungs last year when the dust come too But theres far more dust this year Honestly Missy you oughta go back home to the clean air and larders full of food Were all in this together no matter how hard it gets And hard it will get ve seen whats left around here though some folks are still filling their bellies Right Weve got to talk about that Come on itll be all right Rose propose that we ration what we have left and spread our provisions over a month until we can harvest more from the vegetable gardens And as hear that there are so very few beans and potatoes left think we should give them to Rose who needs them for Claire Whats left will be shared out equally among the rest of us Excuse me Mmhm The rest of us That goes for us too Yes of course it does Weve already eaten things your father would never have put up with Joseph swears they couldnt be described as food at all legally speakin Your father used to let us obtain stuff when the coffers were empty Surely we could steal something from somewhere But suppose thats no good either Miss Grace m afraid youre one tough cookie Maybe am Sadly the most nourishing fare the estate could still provide had not improved Claires condition much But she needed meat and Timothy knew it So henceforth they would have to do without the loyal old donkey on the treadmill It was not a good portent of the level of morale that the gangsters were now trying hard to fix the car from the ravages of the dust But luckily Joseph a legal expert with the ability to interpret the most incomprehensible of texts had met his match in the Ford owners manual Timothy thank you For Claire As time went by the scattered cotton plants at Manderlay grew side by side with its denizens hunger now that the little that was left of the donkey meat was reserved for Claire And Grace found herself in the peculiar situation of joining Wilma and the other women in what had been completely forbidden under Mams Law namely the Southern tradition of eating dirt Having given up on the automobile manuals Joseph had found a quaint turn of phrase in the agreement into which he had originally entered with Graces father regarding his employment The wording could with a little good will be interpreted to mean that certain circumstances obliged an employee to obey a higher authority than his boss the authority in this case being his stomach The good news was that although the drought had been hard on the fields Stanley and Timothy had invented a weapon to deploy against it Wait wait Watch out Its coming Why didnt we think of it before But the best news of all was Claire who had miraculously gained so much strength that she could empty her plate of good food Always in the middle of the night and when everyone was asleep when nobody was looking but even so If Grace had thought hunger would put paid to her forbidden sensual fantasies actually the opposite was more the case Flora whats going on with the chickens Are they fighting You mean the four whites after the black You want should open the door and have a peek No Mind you that little black hen real proud Wouldnt surprise me if them others took the chance to give her the odd peck Now dont you tease me Flora Good night then Good night Flora had teased Grace before with the little black hen But they were hurting it in there No doubt about it And to make everything far worse that heat in her loins seemed to come back in spite of that poor chickens cry for help or even intensified by it Devastated humiliated and overcome by fear for her sanity she fled In a fit of madness or what others would simply call horniness she threw herself onto her bed on her tummy and for a moment forgot all about shame and political correctness and did what she had not done since her childhood when she had not yet known it was so infinitely wrong She pressed herself onto the knot she had rapidly and instinctively formed by bunching her quilt Whether it was pleasurable or painful is hard to tell but she kept at it It was beyond her control With no regard for the sleep of the women around her or common decency in general the pulsating explosions in her nether regions took over her world And who knows how it would have concluded had there not appeared at that very moment fortunately for Grace a person shaking her back to a reasonable state of selfdefense Miss Grace You gotta come quick Miss Grace She dead took such care of her fed her the good meat Shed been eatin She dead Now shes dead Wilma wanna show you Come outside now Youre hurtin me said come on Shed been eatin Youre hurtin my arm No She hadnt been eatin This un had Ya gonna tell em Wilma was so hungry get so dizzy And my legs hurt when m hungry Our good friend and Claires beloved old Wilma been visiting the windowsill while we slept She emptied Claires plate every single night was easy as pie considerin that there window could be opened from the outside ve eaten so much dirt in my time My teeth cant take it no more She killed our little girl Jack Jack she was sick Miss Grace She was sick Jack Rose didnt worry too much about feeding her during the day cause she ate so much at night want Wilma punished for killin my little girl want this matter put to the vote want Wilma punished for killin my little girl want justice or ll kill her myself right now Let me go home Stop stop stop We will talk about this tomorrow She killed my little girl Stop it And so the very next evening a gathering took place under the magnificent clear twinkling starry sky of Manderlay Now weve heard em all Wilhelm Wilma showed no mercy to our Claire so no mercy oughta be shown to her She must die Jack Killing old Wilma wont bring Claire back All we want is justice Youve said so many times that were entitled to it propose that that she be banished from Manderlay for stealing food in an emergency She probably wont survive that anyway as old as she is After all we dont know if the matter of the food made any difference at all in Claires fate Wilma cant have known whether it would kill her But she didnt care a bit when it came to riskin somebody elses life that of our little girl All Wilma saw was a plate nobody was touching She was hungry What do you think the rest of us was All of us here ate what wed agreed What do you think little Claire was We all hungry and that just makes it far far worse d like to ask yall to vote on Jack and Roses motion All those who believe that Wilma deserves to die raise your hands Thank you Thank yall Stop Grace thought we were the ones who made the decisions here Thats what you always told us Or maybe its only sometimes Of course not Its always Then theys the decisions youre here to defend aint they So let me go across and do it No If anybody is going to do it its going to be me It must not be an act of vengeance Thats all right by me As long as she suffers as much as Claire That will be up to me ll let you know when its over Grace Be so kind as to tell me What they decide Am gonna die No Wilma youre not going to die What you mean mean the ballot did not go Jacks way Youre not gonna die See they didnt think Claire would have eaten the food on her plate anyway And anyhow shed certainly have died from pneumonia from the dust Did they really say that Yes They really said that If you knew how terrible the waitin was m just so weary know know you are But now you can sleep easy Yes can Lie down and get some sleep You are the daughter might have had Lie down Will you stay till sleep ll do that Wilma Here Lie down Wilma Sheep sheep Yes my Lord Sheep sheep Yes my Lord Harvest time finally did arrive and the cotton went safe into the sacks Yes know Despite the fewer bushes the harvest was splendid Yes know It was as if all the trials and tribulations had made the cotton extra white and the fibers extra strong And even at current prices it would bring in a record sum Yes my Lord And although nothing was the way it had ever been the harvest was as precise as always at Manderlay The moment the last tuft of cotton was in the sack the swallows arrived dropping from the skies towards the marshes Everyone observed the sight in awe and for a moment it was greater than all the words and politics in the world The old gin was as ready as ever It had been for a week Greased and stripped down and reassembled by Sammy who had teamed up with Niels They worked well in harness Niels had never found a joke funny in his life so Sammy the Clownin Nigger had given up not unrelieved trying to entertain him with his somewhat weak material Thats fine Thats fine All right Miss Grace Miss Grace Edward hardly recognized you Youve certainly changed the way you dress Yes Your father thought it was time for a change Hes on his way into a new area of business Is Daddy here No he sent me on ahead to give you a message Your father says hell be by a week Monday at in the evening He told me to tell you he will wait in the car outside the gates for a quarter of an hour not a second longer the way he did in Dogville he says and the way he did with your mother think it was When he asked her to marry him Yeah something like that If you want to go with him you better be there cause he says hell just push on know get the message All right m on my way Take care Miss Grace You too Edward Oh Edward Hmm Just tell Dad that new times have come to Manderlay But no Grace had no intention of going with her father when he arrived She had her own life to lead now and it suited her just fine But shed be at the gates anyhow She just had to show him what she had achieved a new and better Manderlay It was examination day for Stanley and the family Because even though things had been going well recently when Stanley partook of his traditional beer with Mr Miller nobody would be able to prevent him from revealing what had happened on the plantation and thereby ruin it all Wilhelm had been highly skeptical about letting the whites talk to the drivers at all But Grace had insisted She trusted them Oh Sammy Oh Lord Sam Eejit nigger Are you totally useless Sorry Mr Mays Ha ha m jokin Stanley Mays and the family passed That very evening Grace pronounced them graduate Americans Bertie And although they were free to go they had elected to stay as there was talk of hiring the family and Stanley Mays on a permanent basis And before anybody knew it the days had passed and the money was in the bank from where it had been picked up by proud Timothy on horseback Niels and Sammy had fixed the car wisely without reference to the manual Thank you for everything Thank you What are you gonna do now dont know You could always go back to gangstering Wheres Mr Robinson Hes been down in the cabin shakin hands Grace was touched by Mr Robinsons sudden social interest in the former slaves But it felt right when the car left It was time for Grace to say goodbye to power Brave and strong thy men and women Better this than corn and wine Make us worthy God in Heaven Of this goodly land of Thine Hearts as open as our doorways Liberal hands and spirits free Alabama Alabama We will aye be true to thee Hes watching you No hes not Hes watching you No hes not reckon it have somethin to do with them gangsters leavin See honey when you was boss he was visitin your kingdom Now youre visitin his reckon he wants you now He should have some dinner m gonna go get him You gonna go get him Uhhuh Youve gotta come get some dinner Be quiet woman In Mams bedroom Grace recalled Floras worrying intimate little details Sexual intercourse amongst the Munsi was determined by ancient traditions It would not appeal to Grace Flora had said Not with Graces modern ideas of equality of people and the sexes But Grace seemed to have left her progressive attitudes at the table Now actually in the situation she had dreamed of it was all more bizarre than erotic Anyway Grace decided to hang on to this opinion Timothy wake up Timothys horse had got out of the stable when fires had been lit around the Manderlay slave quarters while Grace was asleep What happened cant tell you If you want a clear answer youre gonna have to ask somebody else The gangsters took the money What The gangsters took the money Thats the answer And reckon its a pretty clear answer too It certainly is very clear What makes you think so When the party ended we all left the table to go and take a look at the money Timothy had hid it behind the red slope Timothy was meant to be keepin an eye on the place but he wasnt there And the box had been pulled up It was empty One of the gangsters dug up the money when he was pretendin to say goodbye But he couldnt have done it alone Someone must have told him where the box was And Sammy refused to admit it was him although hed spent a whole lot of time with Niels And then everybody started yellin and screamin and and folks is angry and no ones listenin Stanley Mays and the family got away believe Although Philomena and Bertie got cut up real bad Elizabeth is dead too although that was mostly by accident It was too soon to send the guns away We werent quite ready yet For once Grace had nothing to say She could but reproach herself in silence for her tasteless joke to the gangsters about resorting to their former occupations if things got tight Wilhelm cant rouse Timothy No bet you cant He drank three bottles of hooch before we ate The Munsi dont drink Well maybe they do on special occasions Well it certainly is lively around here Didnt tell you didnt want to see you here again Yes but ve not come to do a deal ve come to conclude one And in the hope of course youll see that am an honest man neednt have come back here to settle up at all This is your Quite a tidy little sum it is too as you can see Its the money from our harvest expect so Its that time of year See had a little game with a young man who came to see me knew hed come from here so ve made my humble return Dont you think you just might have been wrong about me Who did you play for all this money Well it was a day ago now d have come sooner but passed this black car with some gentlemen in dark coats They began to follow me shouting the whole time that was going to die that was a con man who dealt from the bottom What an accusation eh It just took me a while to get away Who was it The nigra fellow arrived on horseback What was his name Timothy That was it Timothy yeah that was his name Hes a Munsi They dont gamble Well know Munsi dont gamble m a bit of an expert in this field You have a devil time gettin them to the gamin table No Hes no Munsi In fact hes what d call a splendid fella at the card table He just stayed bein splendid no matter how much he lost But he told everyone he was a Munsi Of course See all the girls were wild about the tales he told All the Munsi tales The proud African the royal line You know all that oldfashioned morality And the accent of course So on account of that the girls was easy to bed m not even going to avail myself of your gratitude Thats just the kind of fella am Hey ho Now bless me if can come up with a motto for today They say the Mansi are better hung than the Munsi Or the Munsi are so upstuck but the Mansi how they fuck Well ll be seein you We can talk business another day Grace went straight to the last pages with the tables of personal details on the slaves of Manderlay Where was Timothy now Yes his name had a beside it Proudy Slave as shed read earlier Or did it She looked more closely at the handwritten number She compared it to the next to Elizabeths name The Pleasin Nigger of the chameleon type An expert in changing character according to whatever was opportune and what would titillate and enthrall the other person And then Grace could see it Timothys number was not a but a She had only wanted to read it as a There was even a note beside Timothys name Caution Diabolically clever Grace had called a final meeting for everybody at Manderlay for that evening she had decided to leave the place forever with her father when he arrived Oh youre all here persuaded the community to assemble extraordinarily for two ballots Whatever they involve they can scarcely have anything to do with me anymore Dont be too certain of that Miss Grace Well am certain ve come to say goodbye If youve had two ballots today oddly enough that coincides with the two presents ve brought Farewell presents if you like The first is this Its the money from our harvest Actually its of it card shark kept the other as commission He scammed the money off somebody from Manderlay in a game of cards So the gangsters didnt take it No No they didnt And wont prolong the tension It was the treasurer who did it The man charged with looking after the money He was overcome by his eagerness to play Probably because he isnt a Munsi at all but a Mansi However unimportant that may sound Which brings me to my second present This one Painful to you or not it has to come out In this book which still regard as the most abominable contemptible document ever written Timothy is listed as a Pleasin Nigger person who can change his appearance to please the beholder as he has done Let me find the page Its on page How do you know thought no slave had ever seen this book How do you know whats on page of Mams Law Cause wrote it Its all in my meticulous hand Mam and were very young when the war suddenly ended and this new statute terrified us Terrified you We tried to imagine what kind of world would these slaves be let out into Were they ready for it Or more correctly Was it ready for them Legislators promised all kind of things but we didnt believe them It was then that Mam urged me to commit to paper the way thought things should be done here if everyone stayed on at Manderlay But its the prolongation of slavery You might call it that You also might call it the lesser of two evils But did the others know that you wrote this book Groups and always knew few members of the other groups were better off not knowing But everyone knows now wrote Mams Law for the good of everyone For the good of everyone For the good of everyone How dare you Its a recipe for oppression and humiliation from start to finish think youve been reading it through the wrong spectacles Miss Grace if may take the liberty of saying so And then Wilhelm initiated Grace into the humane qualities of the lesser of two evils Mams Law How it guaranteed food and shelter and allowed anybody the privilege of complaining about their masters instead of having to blame themselves for the life of no hope that they would surely have to lead in the outside world How the noonday parade was a blessing since the parade ground was the only place with shade at the warmest time of day How the numbered groups were determined according to the patterns of behavior that human beings resort to in order to survive in an oppressive community so that life could be made easier for each of them Since a Proudy Nigger not that Manderlay had seen many if any of these survives by perceiving himself as proud and could be helped by this system to believe that he was a bit more persecuted and punished than the others Since a Clowning Nigger would benefit greatly from the laughter that Mams Law strictly demanded of his master just as any other groups benefited from similar obligations How cash was forbidden so that gambling had to be done with cotton money to prevent ruination and misery for the families Et cetera et cetera Until Graces head felt fair ready to explode Damn it Wilhelm theyre not free Thats what matters d call that a philosophical argument which neatly brings me to the two ballots just mentioned Was Mams Law still relevant We agreed that unfortunately it was as relevant now as it ever was America was not ready to welcome us Negroes as equals seventy years ago and it still aint And the way things are goin it wont be in years from now So we agreed wed like to take one step backward at Manderlay and reimpose the old law Excuse me but m going As for your going d better tell you about the second of our ballots As you know sadly we lost Mam and unfortunately weve good and well frightened off her descendants In short we lack a Mam No neednt tell you that you received every single vote Never With all your idealism think you could enjoy being the guardian for a kind of menagerie of creatures who have no chance in the wild Just as you thought the notion of community would be good for us You were so sure you permitted yourself to use force to convince us d be sorry if we had to do likewise What do you mean Do you intend to keep me prisoner Only until you understand the way you wanted us to understand The gate has been repaired and is closed The fences are in good shape but of course they aint particularly high Those fences come on Two men with a rusty shotgun and a toy pistol How dumb do you really think we are Too dumb to build a ladder if we really wants to get away Grace had spent a great deal of time on this meeting which from her point of view didnt seem to be getting anywhere Her father and his car would be at the gate at That was in half an hour She had no ladder and she was on her own and guarded by many Just how was she to get out of Manderlay When was a section of the fence always down Grace would have to change her tactics rapidly if she was to make the rendezvous All right ll do as you want Not from my heart though surely none of you could expect that but as my only option And you neednt be scared ll obey your beloved law So wed better start by dealing with the present matter Timothy slave from Group has committed a theft that almost ruined us all As ve determined that Mams Law does not prescribe any punishment for stealing money shall have to be creative What was it you once said Flora Something about planting a bottle of Rhenish wine do believe theres a bottle of Rhenish wine under Timothys saddle Dont you So thats what seen when went there yesterday If it wasnt a bottle of Rhenish wine There was still ten minutes until her slavishly punctual father would arrive outside to wait for his minutes and not a second longer Just enough time for a verbal farewell salute Timothy you can stop being proud and silent Cry and shout and beg for mercy like the Mansi you are The Mansi who you despise so much And its that hatred Timothy and the rest of you bear towards yourselves that youll never make me accept You are a cheat of the lowest kind And Wilhelm and all of you who follow him are nothing but a bunch of traitors to your race hope that your fellow Negroes will one day uncover your betrayal and punish you for it You make me sick m sure youre quite right Miss Grace Most likely its impossible to revile us niggers enough But what dont get is why it makes you so angry What do you mean Arent you forgetting something You made us Probably the only thing that could have stopped the lady with the whip from carrying on forever was the cheerful tinkle that announced her fathers presence She needed his support now Manderlay too really was a place the world would be better off without Grace recognized her fathers handwriting Dear Girlit said Dear Girl So you tricked your father yet again waited the minutes first but am too kindhearted So popped over to the fence behind the bushes and peeked inside to check that you were okay To my great surprise it really did look as if you had a good grip on things for once m proud of you my girl hope we meet up some day so you can tell me what you actually meant by new times at Manderlay Love Your dumb old Dad Ballots could be unrivaled but determining the time by public debate was rarely feasible That was quite apparent Grace had but a few seconds to choose the direction in which to flee away from her swarthy pursuers who as her father had so teasingly predicted were carrying torches Grace was in a hurry and did not notice Bert the former fugitive with a liberal attitude to other races who never did make it far Grace was angry Manderlay had fossilized in a picture of this country that was far far too negative America was a manyfaceted place no doubt about it But not ready to accept black people You really could not say that America had proffered its hand discreetly perhaps but if anybody refused to see a helping hand he really only had himself to blame They pulled in just behind the bridge He lays her down he frowns Gee my lifes a funny thing am still too young He kissed her then and there She took his ring took his babies It took him minutes took her nowhere Heaven knows shed have taken anything but All night She wants a young American Young American young American She wants the young American All night She wants the young American Scanning life through the picture windows She finds the slinky vagabond He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang But Heaven forbid shell take anything But the freak and his type all for nothing He misses a step and cuts his hand but Showing nothing he swoops like a song she cries Where have all Papas heroes gone All night She wants the young American Young American young American She wants the young American All night Well she wants the young American All the way from Washington Her breadwinner begs off the bathroom floor We live for just these years Do we have to die for the more All night He wants the young American Young American young American He wants

idol singing falsetto about Leather leather everywhere And not a myth left from the ghetto Well well well would you carry a razor In case just in case of depression Sit on your hands on the bus of survivors Blushing at all the AfroSheerners Aint that close to love Well aint that poster love Well it aint that Barbie doll Her hearts been broken just like you have All night All night you want the young American Young American young American You want the young American All night You want the young American You aint a pimp and you aint a hustler pimps got a Caddy and a ladys got a Chrysler
