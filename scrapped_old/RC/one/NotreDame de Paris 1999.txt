Val damour they close the door they give you what youre looking for No pretty words no diamond rings but you can buy most anything Just pay the price and love is yours behind the doors of Val damour

Behind the doors of Val damour Behind the doors of Val damour Light of delight when everythings alright The first man to hold you tight and show love in all its might May no hands other than mine ever

your love will risk all my life for you Take me take me if it is my destiny Come see come see if its your destiny Phoebus Esmeralda Oh destiny you are the master of man Oh destiny you write our lives in the sand Oh destiny though we do all that we can Oh destiny you say if we fall or stand Oh destiny you hold our lives in your hand Oh destiny Oh destiny Oh destiny Talk to me of Florence and of the renaissance And of Bramante tell and of great Dantes hell In Florence they have found that the world is really round And theres a new unknown continent to be found They tell me ships have sailed upon the open sea For new ways to the East wherever they may be Luther will give the world the true New Testament The old world falls apart mankind learns discontent And Gutenberg with his books will change the world again In Nuremberg on his press books pour forth day out day in Novels poems and songs men can read of right and wrong New ideas come along who knows where we belong The little things all come with great things to descend The little words are strong they bring down monuments The books they read in school will kill cathedrals all The bible kills the church and man will make God fall The new will kill the old They tell me ships have sailed upon the ocean sea For new ways to the east wherever they may be Luther will give the world the true New Testament The old world falls apart mankind learns discontent The new will kill the old The new will kill the old The bells do not play in NotreDame today Quasimodo hides up above Quasimodo is sick with love The bells have lost their voice for three days by his choice Quasimodo is sad Quasimodo is going mad Quasimodo dies for love The bells that make ring they are my loves they love me well want to hear them sing loud as they swing my pretty bells In thunder or hail or in wind or in rain Their song will never fail singing through joy singing through pain Bells that ring when were born bells that ring when we die Bells that ring every day every night every hour Bells that ring when we pray bells that ring when we cry Bells that ring to wake us up when the sun lights the sky For the feast of Rameaux for the Quasimodo For a bright Christmas day and for the day of all saints For annunciation for the resurrection For St valentine day and for when Good Friday comes Celebrations they sing all processions they ring The most beautiful day it is the feast of our lord Days of years days of kings Easter day my bells ring And on Pentecost day they sing with bright tongues of flame Confirmation they sing and communions they ring Bells that toll for our death dies Irae dies illa For ascension they sing for assumption they ring Bells that bring us hosanna and sing hallelujah The bells hold most dear of the beauties have here They are my Marys three all best friends to me When my little Mary rings when children die she sets them free And my big Mary rings when sailors set forth on the sea But when my great Mary sings when lovers exchange wedding rings Then something in me always cries then something in me always dies To see their happiness to see their tenderness When a woman will not give me a single caress My bells marry and blend and take wings on the wind In the midst of the stars up in the vaults of the sky All these bells that sound Kyrie Elieson Hosanna Hallelujah Dies irae dies illa Bells that mourn with the sad bells that laugh with the glad all these bells that have never not once rung out for me The bells that make ring they are my loves such joy they bring want to hear them sing if Esmeralda does still live To tell the world that Quasimodo loves Esmeralda Gringoire where has your lady gone never see her dance at NotreDame dont really know where she has gone priests and poets are not one In women see love the church puts them below and my poems above Where is she your Esmeralda The small Paris streets cant sing without her song Shes alone in a tower of stone far from those who fear all her powers unknown Poet what do you say is it this or that way Do not use your words to play have you seen her today Where is she my Esmeralda The kingdom rule has lost all its splendour She is like a swallow of spring that someone has caught and tied down the wings She is there in the prison called laSonte If she cant get away that is where she will stay until she is hung You need tell me no more Where is she your Esmeralda The small Paris streets cant sing without her song She is like a swallow of spring that someone has caught and tied down the wings Will the birds they put in cages ever ride upon the wind Will the children life outrages ever learn to love again lived my life like a swallow arrived here in the springtime All the little streets d follow all the gypsy songs were mine Wheres my friend who rings the church bells Where are you my Quasimodo They will hang me as the light swells you can break these bars know Esmeralda have you left me Do you hide yourself away have counted every hour have missed you every day Have you left upon a journey with your handsome shining soldier With no marriage taking love free like the gypsy girl you are Have you died out in the small streets with no prayer to get to heaven Theres a priest who counts your heartbeat if he comes near you must run You remember at the street fair When they hurt me on the great wheel When you begged gave you water At your feet had to kneel On that day our friendship started it will last as long as we live Once together never parted all well have to give well give Will the birds they put in cages ever ride upon the wind Will the children life outrages ever learn to love again Cast away souls at bay Its our dreams they betray Now they say we cant stay Prayers we pray lost today Put the shade of your skin with the shade of my skin Put the song that you sing with the dance that bring Refugees downward bound Fill the streets of your town Cant we make a world to which everyone belongs Cant we make a world without fears without frontiers Were called names we are blamed Were kept down we are shamed In the night torture comes Try to speak without tongues My homeland hold here In my heart ever near In your land find tears Words that hurt things to fear In my heart summer dies From your grey winter skies Cant we make a world to which everyone belongs Cant we make a world without fears without frontiers Cast away souls at bay Its our dreams they betray Now they say we cant stay Prayers we pray lost today Cast away Cast away Esmeralda this high court charges you with having wounded a soldier true If he is wounded hes living still oh let me see him one time if the court will You have seduced him with foul sorcery stabbed him to kill him its plain to see It wasnt me on my

the day appointed you will be led from your cell to the Place de Greve where you will be hanged May God have mercy on your soul Phoebus if hes alive then its Gods will Please tell him that love him still Phoebus if you can hear please come to me Tell them the truth and set me free Phoebus tell them so they will let me be Phoebus when we went in and closed the door laid my knife upon the floor Phoebus the man in black saw him there He came behind you from somewhere Phoebus saw my knife move through the air Phoebus hope by everything above Esmeralda does still have your love Phoebus the girl who danced once on the square who gave her life to you out there Phoebus each night in my dreams you appear Please come and take me far from here Phoebus was a happy man until saw her face hid my need away in some dark secret place All that power of sex kept down and never let go had only one design the truth of god and man to know Oh m a priest and love this girl love with a love that destroys my

light Bright on the Paris night See how a man suffers all for love Clear solitary star So far when the day returns Please hear up there so high the cry of the world Please hear the cry of a man in pain For whom all those million stars dont shine like those shining eyes He loves with a mortal love Moon Moon please dont disappear Before you have time to hear Just hear how cries the heart of the human beast Please hear the cry Quasimodo cries He cries for his heart is full His voice over mountains flies So high that know it flies to you Moon See how this man aspires To join his poor voice with angels Moon you who shine your light For poets as they write See how a man suffers all for love for love This small whistle ll leave so you can call on me Days youll hide from the light but you
