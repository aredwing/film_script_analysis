since morning Oh God That means these people are keeping a vigil on us Then how shall we meet Mehmood We will meet But after the night falls See The curtain has also been slide think the dingdong starts now They might be trying to forget the pain of the kid brother Yes Sawant Sawant Sawant get up Follow them Tan Tanatan tan tan tara Lets go along for the last show How fortunate these people are buddy Now they will sit in some dark corner and put their arms around each other and start their own show And well have to wait here like watchdogs till their show ends If our destinies are broke in itself then what the hell shall Should we do this or should we do that what sort of mess is it Oh My brother Oh My brother Oh My brother Stop it here Sir where does Mr Mehmood stay Until the climax they are not going to come out Give me a cigarette That means you will testify in the court against them will That day though refused to do so in the Irani hotel But believe me wasnt able to sleep the whole night Because felt that by not helping you am committing the same sin that and those two have committed They killed you brother and threw his body on the streets And m liable for the same thing by not telling the truth Whats the difference between me and those people uniform is a uniform Be it a constables or an s And by disrespecting it am committing the sin that they did am grateful to you that you gave me a chance to repent When do have to come to the court Very soon If the case is admitted early morning then we will need your testimony very soon But till then no one should suspect you You go to your home without bothering about that If the Lord wishes then the case might get admitted Your honor Anuj Srivastav is one among those criminals who are trying to vitiate the youth of this county for the sake of money Anuj Srivastav was a drug runner Yes drug runner He was killed in a police encounter on the night of th December at oclock when he was trying to flee with drugs in his possession Your honor such cases end with the life of the criminal To get them restarted amounts to putting back life in a corpse In fact will say it is something like wasting the courts time So request the court that it shouldnt admit this case Because its not a case at all Thank you your honor Your honor am aware that the courts time is precious Therefore instead of giving a lengthy speech would like to show something to the court Take this Your honor these are the snaps of the car which according to the police was being driven by Anuj Srivastav And this is the police report which has a clear statement that Anuj Srivastav was trying to escape along with the drugs The police followed him They tried to stop him They warned him twice And when he didnt stop They fired on him And he died on the spot Your honor if at all Anuj was trying to flee from the police then his cars speed must have been around kmph But want to attract your attention to a simple fact that if the driver of a car which is moving with a speed of kmph dies on the spot after being hit by a bullet shouldnt the car had met with an accident Neither the car got hopped upside down Neither it broke down Neither it suffered any damage Instead it stopped in the middle of the road Your honor on behalf of my client request you to admit the case for the sake of justice Thank you After going through these photographs the court is convinced by the prosecution that there is definitely some difference between the police report and the actual incident The court admits this case and gives the prosecution a chance to produce its witnesses The case is admitted The hearing of this case will begin on Monday from pm onwards Mr Malkani are you her guru or its the other way round think the girl will make the going tough Dont worry sir If a new driver honks the horn too much then it doesnt mean that he is gonna win the race Winning needs experience And experience is right ahead of you The city is free from any danger in my presence Yashwant Thakur He is trying to ruin the respect that earned in so many years He will accuse me Accuse me He will accuse Yashwant Thakur Sir you wont spare that rascal You are not in your senses You will bring me back to my senses You will do that Thakur sir what are you doing am your associate Shut up Shut up If you had been my associate then you would have tolerated my insult in the court That bitch was accusing me in front of that judge and you were seated like a mute spectator Sir am your associate You bloody liar You are a liar Sir leave him Sir leave him Sir please listen to me Sir have the record room register The Anuj Srivastav police report hasnt been issued to anybody It means someone has stolen it from there and given it to them Yes That means someone from our police station sneaked in to the record room and worked against us It also means that there is a traitor in our own department Come in Mr Mehmood you have to stay away from your family for some days These are some eatables for you You dont bother about me am aware of your hardships have spent years in this police force very well know as to what am doing You go Go Mr Agnihotri you are the principal of the college Yes Anuj Shrivastav used to study in your college Yes Mr Agnihotri can you tell the court that the night that Anuj Shrivastav was killed in a police encounter the same morning you were about to rusticate him from the college Yes Can you tell us why you were about to do that Because Anuj was caught red handed along with his friends Can you tell us doing what He was removing the copies of the question paper from my locker That means He was stealing Milord He was stealing Mr Agnihotri can you tell the court why he was doing like this Maybe to copy or To earn money For his leisure activities Anuj Shrivastav wanted to earn money he needed money now and then Milord And therefore he tried to steal the papers from the college and tried to earn money and he was unsuccessful in it and therefore he went back to his old profession The profession of selling drugs But Milord maybe that day was very unlucky for him He was caught red handed on that day too He knew what a serious crime he had committed and therefore even though the police warned him twice he did not stop and therefore the police were forced to shoot him And he was killed Does the Prosecution wish question the witness Mr Agnihotri how many students must be there in your college Roundabout two thousand five hundred And you know everyone of these personally No The truth is that dont even know the names of many of these students But you knew Anuj very well even before this incident Yes Will you please tell the court the reason for that Because Anuj was one of those students whom not only me but the whole staff of the college knew very well Mr Agnihotri are these the reports of Anuj Yes He always used to score more than ninety percent Not only this in sports dramatics dance competitions everywhere everywhere he was number one So Mr Agnihotri do you think that a student like Anuj can do a serious crime like drug trafficking Instead of speaking to my witness on the basis of proof she is asking him guess Your Honor the defense lawyer wishes to tell us something about Anujs character with the help of his witness Even am doing the same Yes so Mr Agnihotri do you think that a student like Anuj Shrivastav deal in drugs The point be noted Milord The witness that has been brought by the defense lawyer to accuse Anuj Shrivastav hes not sure Milord my next witness is a fast friend of Anuj Shrivastav Mohit Bhattacharya Yes tell me Yadav Since the time the police reports copy has disappeared from the police station Yes Since that time everybody has come to the police station Except one person Who Mehmoodbhai He hasnt come on duty since two days nor has he gone home Hey Let him go sir he is a kid Mehmoodbhai Friend what had we done to him understood now How the copy of the police report disappeared from the police station He has offered water for too long But you wont get any water He used to drink he used to gamble he used to visit discos he hosted parties he used to do many things Milord These habits of his had increased so much that he had to be admitted in the hospital once Now for all these things he couldnt ask his elder brother for money every other day Therefore he took up a short cut for this Milord But that poor man didnt know that this isnt the shortcut of earning money but it is a shortcut to death Shortcut to death Was Anuj your friend Yes He was my best friend am very sorry that Did you go with Anuj to discos frequently Yes So can you tell us that in a disco how many people of your age go Yes maybe some four hundred or five hundred And how many such discos exist in Mumbai city Counting all the small and big ones maybe That means with the calculation of of your age some boys and girls go to discos Yes So did you always tell at home and go No So it is obvious that the others didnt tell at home and go too Yes So even they must be facing problems to take money from home So then No There are no problems something or the other is managed Please point this note Milord That in Mumbai city everyday almost lakh boys and girls visit discos without informing their homes and managing something from somewhere So does the defense lawyer wish to say that everyday almost lakhs deal in drugs just to visit discos As for the question of smoking and drinking hiding from the elder brother dont think that it is a crime but Indian tradition And Anuj was a good Indian who respected his elder brother Todays day was pretty good You silenced everybody Wont you come inside have too much work to do have to go home first have to give Mehmoodbhai his food and also have to remind him that tomorrow in the court Enough You dont have to make so many excuses Okay listen Bring Mehmoodbhai on time tomorrow Tomorrow once he testifies then no one can stop us from winning Theres nothing to be ashamed in this son If a person is scared that doesnt mean that he isnt brave He is brave who even after being scared reaches his destination What will we do now son Hey move the car Hey Move them aside Please give me alms for the sake of God Please come out Taxi How much is it Fifty rupees Take this How much longer will you make us wait Miss Payal You told us that you dont want to tell the name of your witness the court accepted it You said that you wish to keep his identity a secret the court accepted that too But you are really wasting the courts time

present my witness If the witness exists only then he will be presented Milord If there is no witness how will he be presented in the court Miss Payal is wasting the courts time and throwing muck on

police station Try to remember Ramona yes Tell us and Anuj were sitting and chatting in the car He was very worried What was he saying He was saying that he loved his brother immensely He said that he didnt like fighting with his brother was trying to make him understand when when those people came Which people Those people took us to the police station And there There There what Those people with Anuj With Anuj what What did they do with Anuj They with Anuj Ramona dont be scared You are standing in the court Say whatever you want to clearly What did they do with Anuj mon Ramona tell us What

witness left before she could complete what she was about to say She was badly scared seeing some people present here But before she left she took the name of those people who had killed Anuj The prosecution lawyer is trying brand my client murderers When she hasnt been able to present even a single witness who can prove that my clients are murderers Milord when her witness has ran away from court before could cross question her Milord will present such a witness now whom Miss Payal can ask countless questions He will answer every question He wont run away from court My next witness is Dr Bansal who is a psychiatrist in Hospital Dr Bansal Can you please tell the court since how many Years are you curing such patients who are mentally unsound Yes since the past ten to twelve years Ten to twelve years that means you have a lot of experience Yes Do you know Ramona Was she your patient Yes she used to come to me for cure And since her boyfriends death she used to stay very worried She used to stay worried that means her illness must have gone to her mind and therefore her father brought her to you Yes She had lost her confidence She had lost her confidence That means in medical or technical terms we can say that she was mentally weak You can say like that The prosecution lawyer wants to present a mad girl as a witness and chance the direction of the case Milord Such a girl who thinks up anything after the death of her lover she makes up any stories But our friend lawyer Payal should know that the court doesnt believe in stories but valid proof Therefore it is my request to the court instead of troubling my clients any further please deem this case null and void here itself The proof that the prosecution has presented is not enough to deem Yashwant Thakur and his two friends guilty Therefore this court stops this case right here and honorably releases these three from his accusation Well done Well done You didnt need to worry See a dog barks makes no difference to the path of an elephant The decision is out isnt it It is crystal clear And if you ask me dont have any complaints against anybody in this matter Not even against those people who tried to throw muck on our spotless uniform And the fact is that dont feel angry on such people but feel pity Anybody can lose his senses on seeing his younger brothers corpse And then he was a son more than a younger brother And a son may be a wretch of the third order but he is a son What are you doing One day had thrown away my weapons for an innocent Today am taking up my weapons once again Aditya listen to me We will appeal in the High Court We will go to the Supreme court with proof We will get justice Who will give us justice Who will give us justice dead constable scared girl runaway soldier or a broken

Today am going to fight a war and that too for my brother Why are you stopping me today Because was wrong then today you are wrong have lost you because of that mistake once dont want to lose you

right was deemed a coward and sacked tolerated it The one who loved the most left me in the middle of the journey tolerated it They falsely accused my brother and gave him a dogs death tolerated it With the same hands that brought him up with those hands had to set afire his funeral pyre tolerated it But now wont tolerate to see my brothers killer roaming around The people who snatched my Anuj from me will snatch away their life from them Adi listen to me what are you going to do Adi listen to me Adi please wait Hey dont let him come inside That wretched dog has come again You will repent
