It is better to settle these matters in the courts than on the streets And new laws are needed at every level But law alone cannot make men see right We are confronted primarily with a moral issue The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities whether we treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated If an American because his skin is dark cannot eat lunch in a restaurant open to the public if he cannot send his children to the best public school available if he cannot vote for the officials who represent him if in short he cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed Who among us would then be content with the counsels of patience and delay One hundred years of delay have passed since President Lincoln freed the slaves yet their heirs their grandsons are not fully free They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice They are not yet freed from social and economic oppression That looks like a police car And this nation for all its hopes and all its boasts will not be fully free until all its citizens are free We preach freedom around the world and we mean it And we cherish our freedom here at home Are we to say to the world and much more importantly to each other that this is a land of the free except for the Negroes That we have no secondclass citizens except Negroes That we have no class or caste system no ghettos no master race except with respect to Negroes Now the time has come for this nation to fulfill its promise The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them The fires of frustration and discord are burning in every city North and South where legal remedies are not at hand Redress is sought in the streets We face a moral crisis as a country and a people It cannot be met by repressive police action It is a time to act in the Congress in your state and local legislative body and above all in all of our daily lives great change is at hand and our task our obligation is to make that revolution that change peaceful and constructive for all Those who do nothing are inviting shame as well as violence Those who act boldly are recognizing right as well as reality Medgar Get down Get the baby Medgar Oh my God Daddy Daddy Daddy love you Daddy dont die want my daddy Turn me loose Turn me loose Medgar Evers believed in this country It now remains to be seen whether his country believed in him The Citizens Councils raised thousands for your defense Moneys pouring in from all over the South Nice likeness What do you think boys Mr Beckwith glad to see you Mighty glad to be here And isnt it true your husband was the first to attempt to integrate the University of Mississippi At the time of his death he was involved in a lawsuit to integrate the public school system wasnt he Your husband mustve had quite a few enemies would you agree Yes he did Your eldest boy his name is Kenyatta isnt it Darrell Kenyatta Evers Kenyattas a Mau Mau name isnt it Objection Sustained Isnt it true that over people were arrested during a demonstration that your husband organized boycotting a department store in downtown Jackson known as Kenningtons Whos that Ross Barnett Youre kidding Nope You dont see that every day of the week former governor shaking hands with an assassin in front of the jury Theres not a court in America that would stand for that Whats America got to do with anything This is Mississippi Byron De La Beckwith You live in Greenwood Mississippi es sir My mother was a Yerger Her mother was Susan Yerger a close personal friend of Mrs Jefferson Davis You shoot Medgar Evers No sir Your Honor may l Mr Beckwith is this your rifle Lets see Well it bears a similarity but couldnt say for certain dont record the serial numbers of my weapons and my gun was stolen from my home several days before this whole business How do you feel Delay got tears in my eyes For Dixie huh In summation not only did surveillance cameras provide us with a visual record of the crime being committed but four eyewitnesses observed the defendant removing his mask upon exiting the convenience store Short of you ladies and gentlemen attending the actual event we dont feel the state could have a stronger case Thank you Counsel Hey Bobby Howd it go Through a combination of superior lawyering and a less than stellar performance by our criminal got a conviction Congratulations My rape victims reluctant to testify Can you handle the Harrison motion You bet Youre a lifesaver DeLaughter your wife just called Whatd she want To remind you youre having lunch with her mother and your parents at How could forget Bobby You seen this Yes have Evers widow is calling for the reprosecution of De La Beckwith Ed this guy was killed over years ago Dig up whatever you can on Medgar Evers and be in my office at Ed this is ridiculous Well sure it is But if we try to bury this shell have every black politician climbing all over me My office Do we have any files here on Medgar Evers Who The civil rights leader that got himself shot in the s just saw that file It was next to the one on the Lindbergh baby Clara just bring me what we have Good afternoon sir Did you make Hinds County safer today You know how it is with criminals Its like finding a gray hair You pull one and two more pop up to take its place love those earrings Have you worn them before ve had them for quite some time just never wear them during the day You see that nonsense about the Sovereignty Commission Yeah isnt that awful That fool Rea Hederman Since he took over that paper Iiberals like Jerry Mitchell been trying to rewrite history The Sovereignty Commission was a fine organization that did a lot of good Dixie would you pass me the butter Why do they dig up things that happened years ago anyway Medgar Evers widow wants to reopen the case You cant be serious Ed asked me to look into it You just tell him No thank you When will these people get it through their heads that the s are over The s and the s thought they found that Beckwith fella not guilty Actually there were two hung juries The reason know is because my late husband Judge Moore was a spectator at both those trials Hed never miss a day And he told me that theyd never convict Beckwith no matter how many trials they had Its just political dont think anything will come of it Son for your sake it had better not You want to be a judge someday You persecute a yearold man guilty or not over some nigger youll have everybody in Mississippi lined up against you Hey Howard How you doing all got any of that crawdad chowder today Yes sir How many for crawdad chowder Oh come on Mrs Evers Mr Dees m Jerry Mitchell from The ClarionLedger broke the story on the jury tampering in your husbands case talked to you on the phone Thats right Thank you for your good work cant tell you how much its appreciated m just doing my job maam What do you think your chances are of getting the to reopen the case ve passed this way before Lets just say ve adopted an attitude of tempered optimism DeLaughter hear the news President Lincoln just got shot Some guy named Booth did it The Sovereignty Commission a state agency worked against the to ensure the jury had Beckwith sympathizers to keep him out of jail Thats grounds for a new trial With all due respect those old files have been leaking out for years They only ran background checks which while unethical was not illegal We cant prove jury tampering d like you to meet Bob DeLaughter How do you do Pleasure Mr Morris Dees the Southern Poverty Law Center How you doing was explaining that in order for us to pursue this well need more than an article in a newspaper Well need new evidence In you had a mountain of evidence All you gotta do is retry Beckwith On the basis of that alone youll get a conviction As you can see the mountain has crumbled a bit Whats this Thats all thats left of the states case against De La Beckwith Just a few pages of the old police report Wheres the gun Where Wheres the bullet Wheres the original trial transcript Where are the files Beats me Are you telling us it is lost m telling you we dont have it Well thats outrageous Even if we had the evidence wed never get around to the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial Mr Dees would agree that years isnt exactly what youd call speedy May see that Mrs Evers this is pretty strong stuff d like to see it June To the Jackson Police Department When you catch whoever killed the nigger pin a medal on him because he just did Mississippi one hell of a favor June female who refused to identify herself stated that shed heard a rumor that Medgar Evers wife had gotten jealous of Lena Horne who appeared with Evers at a rally and might have gotten her brotherinlaw to kill Evers Who wouldnt be jealous of Lena Horne What a beautiful woman es maam The cops wrote that garbage down because they actually took it seriously Mr Dees Do you think the police in Washington would have written it up if some nitwit said Jackie Kennedy had a hand in s death because her husband ran around with Marilyn Monroe Whats your point The murder of Medgar Evers was a race crime a political crime An assassination Beckwith is free today thanks to a racist jury a racist police department and a racist s office Twentyfive years ago Waller and this office went after Beckwith not once but twice dont need to sit here and listen Twentyfive years ago sat on the witness stand and watched as the former governor of this state shook hands with the man who murdered my husband while was on the stand dont expect you to understand the pain and suffering my family went through but did come here thinking that this office might want to see justice finally served Youve given me all the reasons why you cant pursue this Perhaps you can find one reason why you can Good afternoon gentlemen Ed Peters is a good man but as you can see we simply dont have a case know youve been living with this thing for a long while but maybe its just time you Let it go can understand why youd think that Mr DeLaughter For years said the same thing to Medgar Let it go Lets get out of Mississippi Do you know what he said to me dont know if m going to heaven or to hell but m going from Jackson Good afternoon Mr DeLaughter Hey everybody m home Hey tiger Hi Dad You sure you got enough distractions can go get your Game Boy Dad Hi Daddy Hi Dad Did you bring me a lollipop did got one for Claire too Thanks Daddy How was school today sweetie Did Miss Collins like the bracelet you made Daddy tell us a story real scary one Claire you want to hear a story Okay but not too scary Lets go to Mommy and Daddys room because we dont wanna disturb Burt You want something to eat No got something at the office Thanks for letting me know Honey what are you doing up cant sleep The ghost is back ll go ll go The ghost is back Where is he this time In my bed Really Well just have to see about that You were right Hes right there on the bed No Daddy Now hes over by the window see Your bottle tree was supposed to keep him away Maybe dont have the right kind of bottles You know baby when we lived in Natchez there was a ghost that lived right next door in the remains of this house that got burned during the war And sometimes hed come over and get right in my closet Howd you make him go away Granny would come in and sing a song and before you knew it he was gone Whatd she sing She sang the song every ghost from Mississippi loves Sing it Daddy All right wish was in the land of cotton Old times there are not forgotten Look away Look away Look away Dixieland In Dixieland where was born Early on one frosty morn Look away look away Look away Dixieland Oh wish was in Dixie Hooray hooray In Dixieland ll take my stand To live and die in Dixie Away away Away down South In Dixie d ask whats new but m afraid youd tell me My readers are on the edge of their collective seat Will Mr DeLaughter go after Byron De La Beckwith The s office will investigate the possibility of reopening the case didnt go to law school but that sounds like bullshit Nice talking to you Have a nice day Can you tell me how can get ahold of Lewis Skinner or Fred Sanders If you want Lewis Skinner youll need a shovel and six hours of digging time Whats Freds status As far as know hes still aboveground Back in none of those houses were there That was all vacant lot And this here was all covered over with brush got out here eight minutes after the call came in The way Mrs Evers yelled at me youd think was the one who done it This is where they found the gun hidden in some honeysuckle vines Any idea where that gun might be today Hell no Back in those days evidence had a habit of disappearing after the trials Look at that My grandmother could have picked Evers off from over here Thats where he was shot That big tree wasnt there at the time There was blood everywhere All over the driveway all over the car It was as if somebody had butchered a hog But Evers mustve been one hell of a strong man because somehow he managed to drag himself all the way up to his door After that bullet tore through his back it slammed through that window crashed through a wall ricocheted off the refrigerator and busted the coffeepot We found it on the kitchen counter next to a watermelon Youre kidding me No sir Did he have any kids If my memory serves believe there were three little ones there that night What kind of man shoots another man in the back in front of his family love the land of my birth do not mean just America as a country but Mississippi the state in which was born So the deplorable things speak of here today will be said to you in hopes of a future where such will not be the case in Mississippi In the horrific deaths of Emmett Till Reverend Lee Lamar Smith and a variety of other atrocities no one has been convicted And we feel those guilty of having committed these ungodly acts had the feeling of assurance that nothing ever would be done For you see ladies and gentlemen white juries have yet to convict a white man in Mississippi guilty of a crime against a Negro The failure of the socalled decent or moderate white person to take a positive and uncompromising stand Whos that Medgar Evers Why are you looking at it just wanted to get an idea of who he was d like to get an idea of who you are Whats that supposed to mean was willing to go down that road with you when you got out of law school and did that pro bono work And when you worked for that Jew lawyer who ran you ragged minded a little when you turned down that offer from Morse Braggs so you could be assistant at onefourth the salary But ll be damned if spent years supporting your career just so you can humiliate me Youre gonna pursue this arent you Youre gonna humiliate me in front of my friends my family and the entire state m just looking at a couple of tapes Fine Look at your tapes Thats all youd better do Why not Because you cant win Who says The Sixth Amendment Suppose could get around it Its one thing for the grieving widow to carry on Suppose an argument could be made that the Sixth Amendment doesnt apply You want to retry Beckwith Fine Dig up yearold physical evidence which probably no longer exists identify it and then youll have to locate the key witnesses who if you find them are probably dead or senile Their testimony could be read from the transcript We havent seen a certified transcript in over years What if found one Lets say by some miracle you found one got an indictment Then by some greater miracle the state Supreme Court and Supreme Court didnt throw it out and you actually got to trial What if you lose The whole state which is supposed to have changed so much will be facing the worst public relations disaster since that black kid Emmett Till bobbed up out of the river Are you telling me cant go after this m telling you youre dealing with the past Mississippis not a place you wanna be Hopefully Jerry Mitchell can keep this thing alive for us Jerry Mitchells fine but what we need is national press Darrell wont run a major story about how the of Hinds County is refusing to reprosecute a case thats a quarter of a century old Stop annoying your grandmama The greatest joy in your mothers life is being annoyed by her grandchildren Next to being annoyed by you Walter ll get it m not here no matter who it is Who Just a minute please want you to eat those beans Its long distance from Jackson man by the name of DeLaughter You want me to take it No ll take it Eat those beans dont eat beans Hello Mrs Evers know you probably left here feeling pretty discouraged but hope you understand Mr Peters was just being realistic understand perfectly also wanted you to know that we are going to be keeping this case open Mrs Evers Did it suddenly occur to Mr Peters that hed better start making nice with the black community before November Mrs Evers He made it clear to me that in addition to having no evidence and no witnesses he also had no interest Looking into this wasnt so much Mr Peters idea as it was mine Yours Yes maam Judge Russel Moore was perhaps the most racist judge in the history of the state of Mississippi Why would his soninlaw be interested in this case Mrs Evers m years old just like Medgar was and ve got three kids like he did was years old when your husband was killed and hardly remember him at all But went by your house the other day and could see him there watering his lawn working on his roof playing with his children No man has the right to take another man away from his children appreciate the call Mr DeLaughter ll keep in touch Mrs Evers Did you plan on telling me or was just gonna read about it in the papers We should be at the Walkers house in minutes Well ve got a lot of work to do here Suit yourself Nobody gives a goddamn what Byron De La Beckwith did to some Medgar Evers years ago Hell Larry Smith got shot down in his own driveway just last week And it wasnt for no civil rights It was for his spare change could have had any investigator wanted and asked for you Am meant to be flattered by that Were supposed to nail Eddie Williams for killing Wendell Washington or that guy Pierson for shooting Donny Brown Thats why were only gonna work on this case in our spare time Holy shit Will you look at this You could buy a whole damn General Electric refrigerator for alk about your good old days Thats my daddy didnt know he was on the force too Sure Detective Bennett He was there when they found Beckwiths rifle but ve never seen this John Goza is dead Herbert Speight is dead Pittman is dead Is anybody alive This is pointless Its Jerry Mitchell Jerry dont have the gun yet dont have anything If find the gun youll be the first to know Pain in my ass Its funny came by to see if you could use some help on this case and youve got a picture of my daddy We sure could use some help Can you bring people back from the dead Youre joking but thats exactly what we have to do We have to make the past start living again This whole case is one big resurrection want you to go through all the literature from every organization Beckwith was part of White Citizens Council Sons of the American Revolution Good always loved homework Well start by paying these boys a little visit Whos that Two cops They saw Beckwith miles away at the time of the murder You think Holley and Cresswell will admit they lied under oath Time has a way of cleaning up peoples memories love the Delta Its the best place on earth If youre a mosquito ake care now Thank you Mr Holley Sometimes you cant win for losing asked you boys to meet me out here so as to avoid running into any of my constituents How long have you been an alderman up here Mr Holley Must be going on about five years ll tell you this If word got out that testified on behalf of Byron De La Beckwith suppose in a way your boss and me got the same problem Sir If we want to keep our jobs well have to kiss an awful lot of black behind Mr Holley Evers was killed shortly after midnight miles away in Jackson Theres no way the killer could have been here at am pumping gas No sir thatd be impossible It was a long while ago but d like you to think back and tell me are you sure about the time you saw Mr Beckwith at that gas station This old memory of mine gets worse and worse with each passing year but theres two things am pretty sure about It was approximately in the morning and old Delay was gassing up that Valiant of his Lying son of a bitch You thought youd hear something different Maybe well have better luck with his partner all wanna subpoena me then you go right ahead and do it But if see you Byron De La Beckwith or the blackest nigger in this country putting gas in his car at the time of a murder then thats what ll say d say hes in our camp wish had better news for her today Whos that Mrs Evers Fill it up for me would you buddy call her every Friday and let her know how the case is progressing Got a flash for you This case aint progressing think about her keeping this thing alive all this time Imagine a woman loving a man so much cant even get a woman to love me while m still alive Know what did after my last divorce took up golf Man needs a hobby to occupy his mind or hell start doing crazy things Iike drinking too much or chasing yearold murder cases across the Mississippi Delta told you d call you every Friday And its Friday Mrs Evers so m calling This really isnt necessary Its important to me you know were doing what we can wish had better news for you today but we still havent been able to locate the autopsy report Most of the physical evidence is still missing number of the witnesses have died which really hurts us and weve had no luck finding the original trial transcript ve just spoke with both Holley and Cresswell and theyre sticking by their stories m sure as the assistant district attorney of Hinds County youre doing everything in your power to see that justice is done ll call you next Friday ll be on pins and needles till then waited for you to come home m not taking the children with me just need to be on my own for a while was just wondering when we stopped loving each other dont know What happened Bobby People change You saying ve changed m saying you havent Its a beautiful area Mr Beckwith Its heaven on earth Of course like everywhere else we do get the occasional stray nigger moving in But their houses always seem to burn down You know how careless niggers are with their cigarettes real beauty Whered you get this Ed Bryson at Channel Theyre running a piece on Beckwith Do you think its a crime for a white man to kill a black man God put the white man here to rule over all the dusky races It says so in the Bible Is there a chance youd be indicted again for the murder of Medgar Evers Why would be Do you know of any new evidence Are you a Jew Catholic told you wont talk to no Jew Anybody who knows anything about Jews and niggers knows that Jews put the niggers up to all this foolishness This and and If you were indicted again Well m just gonna tend to my business Iike always have m gonna look out for my God my family and the whole state of Christs church That dont encompass anybody but white Christians All these other races and colors and creeds and sissies they are antiChrists See many of them believe in human sacrifices and voodoo and such According to your way of thinking how could justice be done in the Medgar Evers murder First find out who killed the nigger Then you just do whatever the law says that you can do if youre big enough to do it Hes daring us to get him We still aint got nothing know what youll say Did kill Medgar Evers Did you did not kill him But he sure is dead And he aint coming back What did you think when you heard hed been killed didnt shed a tear No sir Here The latest literary efforts from the Hate Group of the Month Club For people who got one thing on

Friday calls so shed trust you lf she finds out cant have her find out This cant leave the office The only way were gonna get a new indictment is if we find something they didnt have years ago The way see it that something will come from Beckwith Right now hes on his mountaintop shooting his mouth off to anyone wholl listen No telling what incriminating things liable to come out of that man But if he knows we have something like this hell know were serious and clam up doubt that Beckwith and Myrlie speak all that often Myrlie speaks to Jerry Mitchell Jerry Mitchell speaks to the world You best stop wasting our taxpayers money Enjoy your drive home Nice to see Jackson still has some concerned citizens Well heck son what did you expect expect people to act like decent lawabiding citizens This is for crying out loud Of course it is And we got blacks and whites playing ball together and on the police force in the government on We are a fully evolved society Arent we son Let me tell you

the case together No maam thats about it wish had more to report Hang up the phone Hang up the phone hope ll have something a little more exciting next Friday You too Hang up ll call you next Friday Mrs Evers Thank you Goodbye What is going on Would a confession by Mr Beckwith qualify as exciting What do you got You know Jack Ables The lawyer Hes representing a movie studio in a defamation of character suit brought by a couple Klansmen While he was doing his research he came across that Klandestine It was written years ago about this Klan titan turned Bl informant Delmar Dennis On page he talks about attending a Klan rally in August of Guess who was a motivational speaker Beckwith Our boy Listen to this And quote Killing that nigger gave me no more discomfort than our wives endure when they give birth to our children Sounds like a confession to me Lets run down this Delmar Dennis We need to have a chat with him says old Delmar chickens out on us Hes probably hiding in the woods shitting in his drawers Where the hell is this place This guy informed on the Klan He could have made a deal with them to save his butt by delivering us Thats a happy thought One of you Bobby DeLaughter Holding rallies and burning crosses is one thing but when they killed them three kids up in Neshoba County freedom riders Goodman Chaney Schwerner That made a lot of people come to their senses Thats why decided to go undercover for the Bl need to ask you if what you say in that book happened That part about Beckwiths speech at that Klan rally Is that a fact Its a fact was shocked and remember thinking how stupid he was shooting off his mouth like that in front of men Did you report that to the Bl Sure did But Beckwith was a white man accused of killing a black The Bl wasnt gonna blow my cover on a case they couldnt win They were saving me for Neshoba because Two of the victims were white Mr Dennis if cant build the case give you my word that we never had this conversation But if can will you testify Byron De La Beckwith is the craziest most dangerous son of a bitch ever come across Hes so crazy even the Klans afraid of him Hes an old man now That old man is probably more dangerous today than he was years ago Mr Dennis we need your help cant make no promises You know something Mr Dennis Six months ve worked this case lot of people have told me to give it up Its years old Let sleeping dogs lie But dont see what difference it makes if a man was bushwhacked yesterday today or damn years ago Murder is murder Its still my job to bring the son of a bitch to justice Its still your job to help me No did my job testified against the Klan They shot out my windows blew up my car They hunted and harassed me for years Dont that get me even for the wrong done We never get even for the wrong weve done If do this thing you gotta promise me protection Whats going on Stop that Stop that Knock it off Enough of that Whats going on Eddy called you a nigger lover My dad says youre after a man for something that isnt even a crime Thats enough fighting son You get on home Go on home Let me take a look at you My God Get in this house Whats gotten into you All this fighting All this namecalling Is this what you want To drag your children into this What would you have me do Let a murderer go free d never tell you your business m thinking about the children dont understand why every decent person in this state isnt sickened by what happened here years ago Oh Bobby Youre not are you Not in front of the children Why not was just a kid and still remember you and your friends discussing it And recollect someone saying That nigger needed to be shot never said a hateful thing like that You didnt cry did you cant say that shed any tears Had it been our beloved governor Ross Barnett got himself shot you wouldve been bawling your eyes out Evers left a young widow and three little kids Why didnt you cry dont wanna discuss this now Why Because he tried to destroy our way of life And he succeeded all too well This states going to hell on account of integration Thats a fact If you think they appreciate one thing we gave them youre crazy Tiger how do you feel m all right Your son has one tough nose So its not broken Itll be tender for a couple days then itll be good as new Thank you appreciate it Youre welcome Thank you maam Are you the one involved in this Medgar Evers thing Yes am think what youre trying to do is very important Thank you very much dont want you kids getting into anymore fights But he called you a dont care what he called me It doesnt bother me You gotta learn not to let it bother you lot of people around here dont like what Daddys doing now What are you doing Daddy m trying to put a bad man in jail Mama says what youre doing is wrong Grandma said Edgar Mevers is ruining our life Medgar Evers was a good guy who tried to help people Did he try to beat the bad guys Yes he did He fought so that black people could eat in the same restaurants swim in the same pools shop in the same stores and go to the same schools as white people Whats wrong with that Nothing But youll hear people say all kinds of bad things about what your daddys doing Theyre gonna tease you try to pick fights But no matter what they do want you to walk away What if they say something really mean Theyre only words They cant hurt you unless you let them Is this about sticks and stones Thats exactly what this is about all understand what m saying Yes sir All right All yall get on to bed now Good night heard you had a little visit with my friend Delmar Mr Beckwith Next time you see old Delmar you tell him for me there are a lot of dark winding roads between the backwoods of Louisiana and a courtroom in Mississippi man could get lost Claire whats the matter The ghosts in my room again Lets see what we can do Where is he Sitting right there Oh right Daddy sing Dixie Hop into bed sweetie Sing You know sweetie maybe Dixie is not the right song Maybe thats why this ghost keeps coming back But you said know baby But m not so sure that all ghosts like Dixie But how do we know what this ghost likes Seeing as this is your special

boo there Here a boo there a boo Everywhere a boo boo You wanted to have lunch to talk about Burts nose No actually l didnt think so So then this is a date Apparently In the hospital cafeteria took a chance thought it would either be stupid or charming What do you think Is there a third choice Extremely charming Thats the one Howd you get into all this You want the standard answer or the truth How about a little of both always liked helping people and like the hours Which answer was that little of both But do like that work one week on and one week off Cant beat that Have to be careful not to shop too much in that week off That can kill you What about you wanted to be a lawyer since was a little kid watched Perry Mason all the time identified with him But he was a defense attorney know Later realized the only way he ever won a case is if some guy jumped up and yelled did it That didnt happen often so switched to the other side think its a good thing you did You would be in the minority these days There are a lot more people on your side than you think Youre not saying that because bought you a lime Jell Well it is the way to a womans heart But if you could pull this off itd do Mississippi a whole lot of good And if dont ll pretend never met you have renewed faith in the institution of marriage cant get enough of my hunk of burning love Not now Clara May Clara Mayfield Its Jerry Mitchell ll take it know you have the gun Weve been over this know you found it in Russel Moores den Therell be a story about how the Iied to the people of Jackson and how Bobby DeLaughter lied to Myrlie Evers m calling to see if you care to comment Youve explained why you lied to the press You still have not explained why you lied to me told you Jerry Mitchell is a loose cannon This case was so delicate didnt want to take chances m the last person on earth who would jeopardize this investigation Theres something youre not telling me swear to God there is no coverup You fully intend to seek an indictment and a new trial Thats what weve been working toward thought so Mr DeLaughter thought so This latest revelation only proves what weve suspected all along Peters and DeLaughter are just putting on a show for the black community As far as m concerned theyre nothing but a pair of lying racists who never repeat never had any intention of prosecuting this case You wanted to see me Come on sit down You dont mind being seen in the same room with a lying racist dont mind if you dont You know Pat Bennett Sure shes one of the best lawyers in the state Why are we talking about her thought she might be able to help you on the case ve got it under control Ed You have your share of the capital murder cases we have waiting for trial under control What new excuse would you suggest give to the families as to why those whove murdered their loved ones have yet to see a courtroom m just curious The fact that Pat Bennett is black wouldnt have anything to do with

about to hear the testimony of a fingerprint expert concerning evidence he claims to have identified in a certain glass Youre entitled to consider the prosecutions failure to make the glass available

doesnt want my help m just another white man putting her in her place She sees no difference between me and Beckwith You didnt tell her about the gun Right If had it to do over again still wouldnt have told her Keeping the discovery of the murder weapon a secret was a good strategy It wouldnt bother her a lick if was black d just be a smart lawyer You cant have it both ways What do you mean by that You said the reason you didnt tell her about the gun was that you were afraid she would leak the story You cant expect her to trust you if you dont trust her want you to meet with Pat Bennett and

Byron De La Beckwith continues to cause controversy Citizens of Jackson are concerned that taxpayers money is being used to dig up the past The grand jury handed down an indictment of Byron De La Beckwith in the murder of civil rights leader Medgar Evers Extradition in the Beckwith case is seen as a stumbling block for the s office plan to fight repossession Whats the word Extradition tooth nail and claw In an attempt to replace a lost autopsy report the s office of Hinds County today received permission by the Evers family to exhume the body of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers The body buried in Arlington National Cemetery in was found in remarkably nearperfect condition After months extradition was finally granted in the case of Byron De La Beckwith the man accused of slaying civil rights leader Medgar Evers Beckwith will face murder charges years after the initial two trials for the same offense ended in hung juries Thank you son first received the call at p m on the night of June My partner and responded and proceeded to the crime scene Iocated at Guynes Street Thats pretty good Benny but just because you read the part of a dead witness doesnt mean you have to

same reason know if ever got in the same room with Byron De La Beckwith as God is my witness d wrap my hands around his chicken neck and snap it in half And nobody be able to stop me wouldnt blame you Nobody hardly ever remembers Medgar anymore Whites or blacks And thats a goddamn shame Because whatever rights the black man has now hes got because of something called the Civil Rights Movement And

friend and your friend Assistant District Attorney Bobby DeLaughter Were talking about my brother Medgar Evers and were gonna play the blues for Medgar all night long You and my sisterinlaw you get justice for my brother Devil if you listening wont sell my soul for no guitar lessons but ll sell my soul for that Are you surprised bail was granted so quickly Mr Beckwith was being held as a political prisoner Hes not been found guilty Why should he be kept in jail Mr Scott youre an officer of the Nationalist Movement correct Is that where the money came from to secure his bond Mr Beckwith has a lot of friends here Well do whatever it takes Suppose he doesnt show for the trial Suppose he leaves the country If he runs well find him How long will that take Another five years

but m going from Jackson Were on record in the matter of Mississippi v Byron De La Beckwith Does prosecution have its opening statement We do Your Honor Ladies and gentlemen this is a very simple case Its about a man whose life was snuffed out on June the th of by a bullet that tore through his body bullet aimed out of prejudice propelled by hatred and fired by a backshooting coward from ambush at night The evidence will overwhelmingly show that Byron De La Beckwith a selfproclaimed rabid racist on a lifelong mission to purge society of anyone and anything that stood for integration is the man that fired that bullet Evidence will show how when he thought he beat the system he bragged about what hed done Bragged about getting away with murder The evidence will undeniably show that the person who pulled the trigger and ended the life of Medgar Evers is this defendant Byron De La Beckwith Mr Coxwell Good morning ladies and gentlemen My name is Merrida Coxwell This is James Kitchens and we are representing Mr Beckwith Mr DeLaughter started his opening statement by saying that this was a very simple case agree with him But what Mr DeLaughter is going to rely on is for you to convict Mr Beckwith simply because of his opinions Thats because he knows that the state cannot prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime By the time this trial is over you will have seen it was physically impossible for Mr Byron De La Beckwith to have killed Medgar Evers Mr Beckwith is not guilty Thats what the proof will show Thank you The state may call its first witness The state calls Myrlie Evers Raise your right hand Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth so help you God do Be seated Will you tell us your name My name is Myrlie Evers Going back to were you married at that time Yes was And to whom were you married Medgar Wylie Evers When was the last time you saw your husband alive June d fallen behind in my housework and got up early that morning to iron some shirts for Medgar By the time he woke had freshly ironed shirts neatly hung on hangers He said thank you for ironing these shirts but m not going to need them Before he left for work that morning he kissed us all goodbye and then left But then he came back and took me aside He said If anything should happen to me want you to promise me you will take care of my babies said Of course Theyre my babies too He then kissed us all goodbye again and left Could you tell the jury what you remember seeing and hearing when your husband returned home that night It was just after midnight when he got home We heard the car And then there was this horrible blast The children fell to the floor as their father had taught them bolted to the front door Medgar was lying in the carport He still had his keys in his hand Blood everywhere The children came out shortly after did and they were screaming Daddy Daddy get up Daddy please get up But knew he would never get up again Nothing further Your Honor Mr McIntyre have you ever owned a Enfield rifle Yes have Did you own that rifle in Sometime believe in traded it to Mr Beckwith Mr McIntyre want to show you this firearm and ask if you would read the serial number on the barrel please Thank you Going back to exhibit would you read the serial number on the invoice of the gun that you purchased and later traded to Mr Beckwith Ms Holder were you at Joes DriveIn on the night of June Yes sir wasnt working but was there hanging out with my friends ell the jury if there came a time when your attention was directed towards any particular automobile Being a carhop you notice cars This one had a long antenna on the side of it We thought at first it was a patrol car It was white and it had a lot of mud on it It was a Plymouth Valiant Mr Hargrove were you employed by the Jackson Police Department in June Yes was In charge of the ldentification Division for years Did you reach a conclusion as to whose fingerprint was on the telescopic side of the gun recovered in your presence on June Yes sir did With points of identification theres more than enough to identify the fingerprint of Mr Byron De La Beckwith After four days of testimony in the trial of white supremacist Beckwith the prosecution thus far has presented essentially the same case as was offered up in the two original trials However this time there are two significant differences First the makeup of the jury In Beckwith faced two allmale allwhite juries Today he faces a jury made up of eight blacks and four whites Tomorrow the prosecution is expected to introduce three new witnesses who did not testify in the first two trials State your name for the record Delmar Dennis Mr Dennis in March of were you a member of an organization known as the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan was In September of that year did you become a paid informant for the Bl did And in your capacity as informant did you ever encounter the defendant Byron De La Beckwith did What were the circumstances of that encounter On August met Mr Beckwith at a Klan meeting in Byram Mississippi He was a featured speaker that night Now during that talk would you tell the jury what if anything the defendant said about the murder or shooting death of Medgar Evers He said Killing that nigger gave me no more inner discomfort than our wives endure giving birth to our children We gotta kill those enemies including the President from the top down Did he say anything else Yes sir He said Youre gonna get away with it like did Thank you Mr Dennis Your witness You have seen Bl reports about your activities as a paid informant havent you Mr DeLaughters office furnished me with copies In fact there are pages and pages of dialogue that you reported to the Bl of things that various people said over lunch over dinner riding in cars meetings Isnt that right Yet nowhere in all those reports does the quotation that you attributed to Mr Beckwith appear Does it Maybe the pages got lost over the years And maybe they never existed Objection Sustained Dog ate my homework Mr Dennis did Byron De La Beckwith ever specifically say that he killed Medgar Evers He never said killed Medgar Evers Thats true No further questions Thats what he meant We ask that the witnesss unsolicited opinion be stricken and that the jury disregard it The jury will disregard Mr Dennis last statement was standing out in the yard and he said something to me about having been tried twice in Mississippi for killing that nigger And whatd he say about that He said had a job to do and did it Thank you Mr Prince Nothing further Back in when Mr Beckwith allegedly made this statement to you you went straight to the authorities didnt you Well you mustve told some of your buddies You didnt tell anybody you were renting a house from a man who admitted to you that hed killed somebody didnt at that time no Mr and Mrs Beckwith had you thrown out of the house because you had a drinking problem right had a drinking problem but thats not why they You dont particularly like Mr Beckwith for throwing you out do you Mrs Morgan when you lived in Greenwood Mississippi in the early s did you and your husband give the defendant a ride to Parchman Prison Yes sir Me and my husband Lloyd was going to see Lloyds brother Jimmy Dale Morgan and Mr Beckwith was going to see some friend of his whose name he wouldnt tell us During that time did he make any statements concerning the murder of Medgar Evers Yes sir He said that he had killed Medgar Evers a nigger and said wed better not say anything about us driving him up to Parchman because he wasnt scared to kill again Thank you Mrs Morgan You have had some very traumatic things happen to you in your life havent you Most definitely Your estranged husband Lloyd Morgan was very abusive to you Objection Irrelevant Where are you going with this If youll allow me this line of questioning speaks directly to this witnesss credibility Overruled Your husband you told us carried on an incestuous relationship with one of his children Yes he did And your father was very abusive to you when you were a child Yes sir And as a result of all this you have been diagnosed by psychiatrists as having an anxiety disorder Yes sir have have nothing further If this jury wants to believe a lying drunk a paid informant and a damn loony bird then might be in a bit of trouble But not as much trouble as our beloved justice system And this Prince fella still owes me worth of rent How do you account for the matching numbers on the gun My rifle was stolen days before this nigger turned up dead Turn those lights off Mom how can you stand watching this idiot When your father died carried around such hatred for that man actually made inquiries into having him killed But in time was able to let that hatred go dont know how remembered something your father once said to me He said When you hate the only person who suffers is you Because most of the people you hate dont know it and the others dont care The big question here is will Beckwith testify as he did so confidently back in Everybody wants to see the Byron De La Beckwith Show What if putting him on is too risky You kidding Hell wanna tell that cockandbull story about his gun being stolen two days before the murder Besides this is Byron De La Beckwith were talking about Summoned from his mountain by God Almighty to give us the word according to Delay Hell testify ll see you upstairs Something happen to you in your boyhood make you meanspirited enough to turn on your own Do what the good Lord and Mississippi got every right to expect you to do Which is Putting niggers away for killing white people instead of the other way around Mr Peters and yall should be run out of this state for this foolishness and yall probably will be This is not some deer you brought down This is a human being deer Mr DeLaughter is a beautiful animal Its one of Gods creatures would never kill a deer nigger on the other hand thats another matter entirely Are you standing here admitting to me that you Killed Medgar Evers What if did Its not like theres anything you nor anybody else can do about it Is there Well see about that Oh that we will That we will You know it only takes but one of them doesnt it The question is which one will it be Maybe that chubby white gal whod be sorely vexed to let one of her own kind be put away no matter what she told you Or maybe that old nigger minister who wont want sending a sick old man to prison on his conscience You aint never gonna get people to convict me of killing a nigger in the state of Mississippi No sir Hell dont even have to take the stand Couple more days ll be heading back to my home in ennessee where will sit on my porch and live out my days in peace and prosperity What are you gonna do What are you gonna do Free at last free at last Great God Almighty m free at last The defense calls James Holley Relax Hes just needling you Hell testify Raise your right hand You swear the testimony youll give is the whole truth so help you God do Be seated Mr Holley did you have a personal relationship with the defendant No sir None whatsoever just kind of knew who he was Mr Holley in the early morning of June th did you have occasion to see Mr Beckwith He was standing outside at a Shell station while the attendant was putting gas in his car ell the jury what time you saw him At approximately in the morning About how many miles is it from Greenwood to Jackson Must be around miles So you saw the defendant less than an hour after the murder calmly standing by his car some miles away from the scene of the crime have nothing further Mr Holley on the night you say you saw Byron De La Beckwith in Greenwood Delay as you call him believe Is that right Delay Beckwith yes sir Why do you call him Delay Are yall firstname buddies No sir call him Mr Beckwith most of the time We just noted Delays car and Delay and the attendant Isnt that exactly what you told me and my investigators when we asked what you were doing that night Delay Your buddy My friend And how long has he been your friend Just shortly after World War ll When you said you had no personal relationship with him that wasnt entirely true Youve known him a long time and been friends a long time right Well sure were friends Just like hope you and are friends Pardon said just like would hope you and are friends m flattered Let me ask you this At the time the defendant was arrested there were a whole lot of law enforcement people trying to gather information am right Bl Jackson Police Do you remember that Did you speak to Detective Sanders one of the investigators mightve spoken a word with him Then you told him you saw Beckwith in Greenwood the night of the killing ls that right did not Why not had no reason to tell unless he asked You had no reason as a sworn police officer to tell an investigator in an important murder case that you knew the suspect was miles away at the time of the murder d have been butting into his investigation Youd have been butting into his investigation by telling him an alibi Sure Did you ever go to the and tell them what was going on Did you tell the Bl what was going on The only person you spoke to about this case was Hardy Lott Mr Beckwiths defense attorney When he called me How long was the defendant in jail by then couple of weeks dont remember exactly Well let me help you out It was over eight months Eight months You let your buddy sit in jail all that time and never once told anyone Youve got the wrong guy Youre asking this jury to believe that Yes sir Earlier in your testimony you said that you and are friends right Said what That were friends You and are friends You still think were friends Sure As my friend if ever go to jail for murder dont leave me there for eight months if you know where was when the murder took place Objection That was a thing of beauty Nothing further Will you redirect Thank you Your Honor Would you lie for Mr Beckwith Did he ask you to As a former police officer you know perjury is a serious crime m gonna ask you this one last time On the night that Medgar Evers was killed did you or did you not see Beckwith some miles away from where the murder took place saw him As God is your judge As God is my judge Thank you Mr Holley We have nothing further No further questions You may step down Is the defense prepared to call its next witness Your Honor the defense rests What Damn Quiet Ladies and gentlemen Quiet or ll order the bailiff to clear the courtroom Coward to the end To my knowledge this jury is being asked to look further into the past than any jury in the history of American jurisprudence That places you folks at a considerable disadvantage Evidence has been lost They dont have the bullet They dont have the spent cartridge case that was found in the gun They dont have the live ammunition that was found in the gun Where is it Nobody knows Does this create reasonable doubt Of course it does And you have heard a number of witnesses testify that years after the crime Mr Beckwith said this or Mr Beckwith said that But the defense has presented you with an eyewitness sworn officer of the law who has testified under oath that he saw the defendant in Greenwood Mississippi over miles from Jackson Iess than an hour after the murder Does that create reasonable doubt You bet it does And reasonable doubt means one thing and one thing only By law you must render a not guilty verdict Forget that its Byron Delay Beckwith Forget that you may not like him that you may not agree with him Judge the evidence and judge it fairly Because in the United States we dont do that for people we just like and admire We do that for everybody thats on trial in an American court of law Because if the system doesnt work for Byron De La Beckwith it doesnt work for anyone ask you to let the system work and once and for all find the defendant Byron De La Beckwith not guilty Thank you An unarmed man arrives home in the late hours of the night home to his family his wife and three small children gets out of his car and with his back turned is gunned down by a coward That coward is Byron De La Beckwith His gun His scope His fingerprint His car And lastly but certainly not least his mouth When he thought he got away with it he couldnt keep his mouth shut with people he wanted to impress And now his venom has come back to do him in because ladies and gentlemen there is no statute of limitations on murder The law doesnt say that if you killed someone years ago or years ago or even years ago that you dont have to pay the price The law doesnt say that if you are years old or years old or years old that you dont have to pay the price No man is above the law And for what reason was Medgar Evers life taken For wanting some degree of equality for himself his family and his fellow man Ladies and gentlemen when that kind of murder happens no matter who the victim no matter what his race there is a gaping wound Iaid open on society as a whole Justice has sometimes been referred to as the soothing balm to be applied to the wounds inflicted on society But when there is no justice those wounds can never be cleansed Those wounds can never be healed When addressed you in my opening statement said that this was a simple case Well was right and was wrong The evidence is simple and the conclusion is more than obvious But the reason we are all sitting in this courtroom so many years after this disgraceful assassination took place is anything but simple President John Kennedy in his landmark civil rights speech to the nation delivered on the very night Medgar Evers was murdered said We face a moral crisis as a country and as a people Those who do nothing are inviting shame as well as violence Those who act boldly are recognizing right as well as reality Today years later on behalf of the state of Mississippi m asking you ladies and gentlemen to act boldly To hold this defendant accountable and find him guilty simply because it is right it is just and Lord knows it is time Is it ever too late to do the right thing For the sake of justice and for the hope of us as a civilized society sincerely pray that it is not Thank you How long do you think theyll be out All know is a short time is good and a long time is not so good Then ll pray for a short time This reminds me of Medgars office on Lynch Street You know used to be Medgars secretary He insisted that we behave in the office strictly as employeremployee Hed call me Mrs Evers and d have to call him Mr Evers Is that right Everybody thought he was crazy But he was just so determined to do a good job You remind me of Medgar Thank you maam Would you like a cup of coffee No thanks As many trials as ve been through and can never take the waiting Wanna go for a walk No you go ahead ve gotten pretty good at waiting That Judge Hilburn he dont have a lot of patience That jury aint back with a verdict in a few hours hell declare a mistrial m not sure got that Would you mind repeating that please You did say mistrial didnt you m gonna snooch you All rise When the verdict is read there will be no demonstrations or any emotional outbursts of any type Has the jury reached a verdict It has Your Honor If the bailiff will hand me the verdict ll ask the jury at this time to stand and face the defendant The defendant will face the jury The jury foreman will now read the verdict We the jury find the defendant Byron De La Beckwith guilty as charged Quiet in this courtroom Guilty Mrs Evers how did you feel when the verdict came in Its been a long journey Medgar ve gone the last mile of the way ve gone the last mile of the way And all want to say is yea Medgar
