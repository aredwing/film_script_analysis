joyful beneath his trembling that he should wear the mark of the king Yet is he not more mindful of his trembling For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun And what is it to cease breathing but to free the breath from its restless tides that it may rise and expand and see God unencumbered Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing And when you have reached the mountaintop then you shall begin to climb And when the earth shall claim your limbs then shall you truly dance Can get you anything Wheres Ruth She went to lie down Matt

Yeah want to Then tell them yes thought you might be busy getting the girls ready Al right The next matter is the state of Maine vs Richard Strout The record should reflect the defendant was incarcerated in Knox County Jail without bail since the th of July Were here for a bail hearing Mr Davis given the fact we have a very crowded trial calendar suggest we do both bail hearing and probable cause hearing today at So unless hear any objection on the contrary d like to set it for and we will take testimony of your witness at that time closed the door walked through my room heard some yelling heard yelling Heard yelling got to the stairs and then heard heard the shot And Richard m sorry Richard Could we go back just a minute Mrs Strout you said you heard the shot You heard the shot Did you actually witness the accident Objection There are no grounds to indicate this was an accident Sustained Strike the word accident from the record Rephrase your sentence Ms Keyes Mrs Strout in the police report you stated that you had witnessed the firearm discharge Did you witness the firearm discharge thought you said thered be a jury trial sometime in October If he was incarcerated the judge would have set an October court date to save the county the cost of housing him as an inmate But with bail unfortunately the court date is always later You mean theres nothing we can do about this You let him walk out and were supposed to sit here We cant appeal bail Its just not set up that way The states bail code is to ensure future court appearances In this case Strouts family put up a great amount of property as bail That along with his ties to the community made it hard to convince the judge there was a risk of flight Now you can file a civil suit recommend it But not now After the criminal trial And when will that be Well honestly could be anywhere from to months My God Youre confident you can put him away for good then right The things she said in there Whats the damage The way this is going potentially manslaughter Jesus Christ He killed our son He It was no accident Ruth Ruth How long will he be sent away for Thats hard to say Anywhere from to years But were confident well get the maximum So even with good behavior years Are you crazy Dr Fowler Mrs Fowler m sorry understand No you dont No you dont Doctor what were you expecting have no idea Dr Fowler how

from the Earth and encircling it an endless line As she got closer she saw that it was made up of mothers traveling forward She felt into line and began walking with them When they reached a certain point the line divided and she said she knew that all the millions of women on her side were the mothers who had lost children She seemed to find great comfort in that How did the little girl die drowning some kind of swimming accident The name of the game is Texas Chase Em Oh jeez Is there a problem Why delude yourself with that crap What Were not in Vegas Its acard draw or card stud Thats what said Carl Asshole ll bet a buck Raise a buck Say something for Christ sake Quit pussyfooting around me You want me to stare at these cards all night There are things of which may not speak There
