Spooky by Dusty Springfield In the cool of the evening When everything is getting kind of groovy The Mini supreme symbol of British style design and ingenuity In more than were sold around the world ve got some plans for tonight And then stop And the great thing about it is that more than years after the first Mini rolled off the assembly lines theyre still made here in Oxford at the Cowley plant the place the Mini was born Its a global phenomenon and one still proudly made in Britain But you know the irony You know who actually owns this great British icon built in a plant years old The Germans Fade To Grey by Visage We are living in an age of German empire Amid extraordinary turmoil in the capitals of Europe Germany commands more raw power than at any time since the Second World War This is an empire of German engineering German expertise and German exports built not on the Panzer but on the Polo and the Passat new order symbolised by the speed power and beauty of the automobile Buying a car in Germany is not just a grubby transaction its engaging in an immensely serious culturallyrich and occasionally rather beautiful and moving event This isnt just a story about cars its about economic power and political clout because in todays Europe its Germany that calls the shots And as we confront the new challenges of the st century an age of cutthroat competition on a dizzyingly global scale what can we learn form our failures and their successes What did we get wrong and what did the Germans get so right We fade to grey Mr Blue Sky by Sun is shining in the sky When was growing up in the s and s my dad had a Rover the quintessential British car So did his father Its a beautiful new day But although think of myself as pretty patriotic dont drive a British car today drive a German one Mr Blue Sky is living here today And m not alone few months ago a poll asked people what brand of car theyd most like to drive Now number one was Volkswagen theyre German Number two was Audi theyre German Number three was Mercedes theyre German Are you beginning to spot the trend Cars by Gary Numan havent driven another type of car its been Volkswagens Audis or Mercedes The fit and finish of the car in a German car for the comparable car is a lot better Well went off to buy a new Rover and they told me had to wait about six months for delivery this was years ago And this was in the garage opposite Well not this one but the new was in the garage opposite so bought the and ve bought them ever since Germany exports more cars to Britain than to any other country in the world So why dont we buy British Well how could we What is a British car Bentley for instance is owned by the Germans RollsRoyce German Jaguar Indian Land Rover Indian Rover belongs to the Chinese And even James Bonds favourite car the Aston Martin is owned by the Kuwaitis and Italians Only a handful of tiny specialist carmakers remain Does this matter though Isnt a car just a means of getting from to In many ways the motor car has usurped the role of the work of art in our modern age In that it represents collective yearnings it represents you know desire It represents an idea of progress of faith in technology and theres noone whos got that more correct and more powerful and made it more articulate than the German motor industry The first car ever bought didnt come from an iconic British factory like Cowley or Longbridge but from the German heartland of Lower Saxony Welcome to Wolfsburg the home of Volkswagen a factory the size of Gibraltar has come an awfully long way since it was set up in under the Nazis to build peoples cars Volkswagen for Germanys masses Here in Wolfsburg theyve even set up this Autostadt a theme park dedicated to the car visited by more than two million people every year Its a temple not just to the automobile but to the technological glamour of German modernity and to the success of Germanys economic model With its gleaming futuristic towers this Car City is German capitalism incarnate And as s steely commanderinchief puts it they want to leave their stamp on every country on earth We have a clear strategy called Strategy In the year we want to become the worlds number one The number one in volume with more than ten million cars the number one in customer satisfaction the number one in employee satisfaction even the number one in making money Under the generalship of Herr Winterkorn are inching ever closer to their goal Last year they made a record profit a cool billion But the irony is that just as the Mini has now become a German story so Volkswagens postwar success began as a British story and its hero was the most unlikely person imaginable His name was Ivan Hirst and he was a major in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers And in August a few weeks after the fall of the Third Reich Major Hirst arrived here in Wolfsburg with orders to secure this factory on behalf of the victorious Allies Much of Germanys industrial base once the most impressive infrastructure in Europe had been destroyed In the ruins millions of starving survivors scavenged for food And with the country divided into four occupied zones Germanys revival let alone its rise to mastery in Europe seemed a very remote prospect indeed When Ivan Hirst arrived in Wolfsburg things were worse than he had ever imagined In the factory itself the conditions were very grim In the press shops for instance the roof was off And we had to sling tarpaulins over each press on wooden poles to keep the snow off And yet it was at this moment at Germanys lowest ebb that Ivan Hirst laid the foundations for the triumph of the German automobile Many of Hirsts superiors thought there was no point saving the factory You think youre opening a car plant here said the British car magnate Sir William Rootes Then youre a bloody fool But Ivan Hirst could see the potential here And he thought that the Germans should be given a chance to reshape their future as a prosperous peaceful nation His priority was to restart production of a car originally designed in the s by the Nazis This car he thought would be the key to getting Germany back on its feet And today we call it the Beetle AcCentTchuAte the Positive by Bing Crosby with The Andrews Sisters There was nothing very radical or exciting about the little Beetle it was round and it was cute But by March the factory at the limits of its capacity was producing Beetles a month for the occupying forces and for Germanys public services were on the road to recovery Accentuate the positive My chief Colonel Charles Radclyffe said think weve got a worldbeater here its another Model And he spotted that as early as And yet the early Beetles were far from perfect We always think of German cars as ultra reliable But the interesting thing about the original Beetle is that it wasnt As one of s top executives put it it had More faults than a dog has fleas but they fixed it and they went on fixing it And it was that obsessive attention to detail that determination to put the customer first that lifted Germanys carmakers well ahead of their British rivals People asked us did we not think we were damaging British interests by developing Volkswagen but our job was to help get the German economy back onto its feet for political reasons of course and that was what we were doing By the time Hirst left the company already had global ambitions And its first conquest would be of all places America Have you ever wondered how the man who drives a snowplough drives to the snowplough This one drives a Volkswagen So you can stop wondering Thanks to a canny marketing campaign thousands of American drivers tired of their massive macho cars began to fall in love with the Beetle They were persuaded that small was beautiful And by when this cheeky film The Love Bug hit the screens the Americans had taken the Beetle to their hearts Jim thats water Wenn by Peter Kraus Meanwhile Germany itself or at least the western half now cut off from the Communist east was booming Unemployment was down production was up Ordinary Germans were now richer and more comfortable than ever They called it the Wirtschaftswunder the Economic Miracle The traumas of the past were forgotten Technicolor consumerism would sew up the wounds of wartime The priority was to look forward to buy new homes new appliances and of course new cars This was a crucial period in Germanys modern history By the end of the s they hadnt just staged an extraordinary recovery they had done the groundwork for what is today one of the most productive and powerful economies on the planet But you might well be wondering where was Britain in all this After all we had won the war Surely we had a head start didnt we On Wednesday His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester opened the first postwar motor show at Earls Court with congratulations to the industry on its magnificent achievement of million worth of cars exported since the war ended s Britain had never had it so good We were now making and selling more cars than ever At the start of the decade we were behind only the Americans in the league table of world carexporters But things werent quite as rosy as they seemed in the English country garden We always think of the s as the decade when things started to go wrong for British industry But dont think thats right By then it was already too late the rot had set in earlier think it was in the affluent comfortable s that the problems really began We were think a bit affluent and comfortable a bit complacent utterly oblivious to the rise of our competitors Here she is a wee Scots lassie Yes its Molly Weir So youre a Morris Minor fan too Molly Och aye our Minor takes all the family and our luggage in comfort Its very economical too but you see its a Morris We might have had a big car industry but size isnt everything The men running Britains car companies were getting old And by the jetage s their autocratic amateur spirit looked increasingly oldfashioned The English idea of gentlemanly behaviour It involves a certain amount of selfdeprecation a certain bit of casualness we sort of distrust seriousness and professionalism in some ways but not in our motor cars and the Germans were able to provide us with magnificent tokens of professionalism and seriousness which our native manufacturers could not They also worked rather better We did still make good cars like the Morris Minor that m driving now but we didnt market them as successfully as the Germans we didnt push them aggressively enough overseas You know how many Morris Minors we sold Over a million But do you know how many Volkswagen Beetles the Germans sold million The real problem was that we were blind to the expanding market right on our doorstep Europe More than two thirds of our car exports went to the British Commonwealth One of the biggest mistakes we ever made as a country was to overestimate the importance of our Empire In those crucial two decades after the Second World War our politicians and our businessmen thought that we didnt really need to worry about Europe because Britain had wider horizons Our carmakers they thought would always be able to rely on the captive markets of our old colonies To put it bluntly wed always be able to flog them our dregs The Standard Vanguard was designed for export Its naval name was meant to recall the great days of Britains Empire There was only one problem the suspension When the Vanguards proud new owners took it out for a spin the car began to fall apart Good evening The Suez Canal is a name familiar to everyone ve come to talk to you tonight about whats happened there in the last few day and what it means to us And Britains Empire too was on the brink of collapse In Britain made a desperate bid to recapture the Suez Canal the vital artery for Middle Eastern oil But when the operation backfired petrol prices went through the roof Sound the trumpets Beat the drums Wave the flags British flags for the fabulous twins the Austin and the Morris Mini Minor Say Little Prayer by Burt Bacharach As a result designers for the British Motor Corporation came up with a new car that was smaller and needed less petrol They called it the Mini We got to make a car a very small car for the housewife which is economical to run and has lots of shopping space inside and therefore it doesnt need a big boot Everything stows away so neatly and easily Four happy people in a big big little car Everybody Be Happy by The Kinks The Mini is probably the most celebrated car in British history But while the Beetle was the cornerstone of Germanys stcentury empire the Mini was a result of Britains imperial decline The Mini had been designed for ordinary workingclass families But by the late s it was being driven by models actors and pop singers Even its marketing was less Coronation Street more Carnaby Street The Mini cheap on petrol British made Small on the outside Big on the inside Dont just wave the flag drive it The Mini was stylish but it was also cheap basic model cost just But as a rival firm discovered the British Motor Corporation were losing for every Mini they sold Ford are very good at costing what a car cost to make and discovered that they must be making it for a loss they couldnt see how it was possible So they actually sent their report to the chairman and said We think you need to be charging more for this And it was ignored and think this pervades a lot of the story of the postwar British car industry Arrogance pervaded it There was a feeling you know Britain had won the war it still had It was coming out of its Empire It very often knew best or thought it did And they felt Well we dont need to be told by Ford what were doing right and what were doing wrong But in fact they were doing it very wrong Son Of My Father by Chicory Tip Moulded was folded was preform dried Son of my father Commanded was branded in a plastic vac Surrounded and confounded by statistic facts Far from being a symbol of s cool the Mini was really a symbol of something rotten at the heart of the s economy a brilliantlydesigned metaphor for a managerial industry crippled by a complacent leadership dreadful salesmanship and a fatal culture of selfsatisfaction Theme from Are You Being Served Today were used to the idea that when it comes to manufacturing from your kitchen fridge to your bathroom shower nobody does it better than the Germans But at the time Germanys economic revival brought back bad memories Guten Morgen mein Herring There you are then Another load of Kraut chitfers Thats hats with shaving brushes on the side Well never sell them you know Captain Peacock It is not for us to reason why Mr Humphries Young Mr Grace in his wisdom has seen fit to mount a sales campaign to push German goods Well its difficult enough to sell English goods without a lot of rubbish from the damned Boche But the battle for drivers hearts and minds was about to move onto the home front As the Germans prepared to launch their invasion of Britain they had a new weapon up their sleeve The Volkswagen Golf It was a hatchback which was still something of a novelty at the time so it was far more practical a Mini did not have a hatchback at all It was a very clever move by Volkswagen as well because it had Volkswagen engineering but it had Italian style The bodywork was designed by a company called Italdesign a very wellknown designer called Giugiaro It was just a stunning sort of angular and very efficient and practical car The Golf in every test one of the best British drivers didnt get their hands on the Golf until But in its way it was an enormously symbolic moment Remember wed only joined the Common Market what became the European Union a year earlier But we were becoming a much more selfconsciously European country We went on Spanish holidays We drank French wine we ate Italian food And now more and more of us were driving German cars The ugly whine of foreign engines rent the peaceful autumn air of the English countryside All ready one traitor in eight has traded with the enemy Are you one Have you bought foreign What about you sir could ask why youre driving a foreign car Well this particular model is because find it very reliable good performance and ve had it for three years now and had no trouble whatsoever with it Youve had some bad experiences with British cars Yeah Ford the bottom dropped out with rust after about nine months or something Have you tried British cars Yes had a Jag before that and Fords before that and it was the usual trip down to the garage every fortnight It really did hit home when my brother came home with an Audi That was quite a shocking thing cos he had owned British cars forever and then he bought an Audi but it was an astoundingly different car Leading the blitzkrieg was Volkswagens hatchback sold Golfs in the first year and in the second To British motorists its reliability seemed simply extraordinary Even today if you dont own a Golf yourself theres bound to be one in a drive near you Hes off in that new car again Hmm Wouldnt catch me in a Volkswagen Whats wrong with a Golf Well its not exactly big is it Actually its bigger than it looks Hell never get that lot in there Anyway dont like rearengine cars The engines in the front its watercooled The back seats fold down too What was it that the Golf did that British cars didnt It worked for a start It was a very very practical car so think people could see it as a car that they could use we could get working with straight away Lift up the back put our shopping in fold the seat down For most British buyers that was great but it also helped that it was a Volkswagen so that means that its related to the Beetle and that was the beginning of our love affair with cars which werent British which did work Mama Weer All Crazee Now by Slade the year the Golf was launched was a great year to be German On the football field they won the World Cup at home in Munich We didnt even qualify said Mama but were all crazy now And while Slades lurid costumes were getting rather old hat the German synthpop band Kraftwerk were reaching for the future with their breakthrough album Autobahn Autobahn by Kraftwerk Nothing better captured modern Germanys infatuation with the machine their love affair with das Auto Britains motorway system was only years old But the autobahns mostly free from speed limits dated back to the s Here was the supreme symbol of Germanys commitment to power speed and modernity itself The autobahn was just such a symbol of the German character in that it looks utterly rational and theyre magnificently engineered wonderful roads But they look rational but theyre also vaguely mysterious and romantic Its not just transport its Its you know its philosophy and religion as well For many people in Britain especially those who remembered the war the Germans newfound success was deeply disturbing You know how me dad feels about the Germans wont even accept a lift in our Audreys Volkswagen So what was the secret of the Germans success How did they do it It wasnt just about the design and branding There was something deeper something that goes to the very heart of the story about why British manufacturing declined whereas our German competitors went from strength to strength and are still going strong today Ever since the s German firms have been renowned for their excellent labour relations and tremendous productivity Even today they make extraordinary allowances for their workers as the top union negotiator Stephan Wolf explains very quickly We have come to a clear agreement with the company that employees can switch off their smartphones after working hours so they can enjoy their spare time This initially was a contentious issue between the company and the work councils but we managed to push our opinion through as the company profits from employees who are able to relax and recover after work So if you work for Volkswagen you clock off and after theres no danger of getting a call an email or even a text from the office until just before your shift the next day Somehow cant imagine many British businesses agreeing to that one In all major German companies the workers representative is provided with the staff car and an executive office And despite the management trappings of his office hes very much a union man German law has long required that every firm has its own works council And that instead of fighting the management they work together in a spirit of mutual trust They even hold board meetings with s management discussing the future of the company Again hard to imagine many British firms signing up to that Rock On by Rex Now this is the key to the difference between the Germans and us And its all a question of class Postwar Britain was a society drenched in class consciousness all the way from the factory floor to the woodpanelled boardroom and the men who led our car unions saw themselves as class warriors standing up to the bosses on behalf of the workers But their German counterparts were very different they saw themselves as partners working with the management and responsible not just to their members but to the national good We wants deeds not words you see otherwise were coming out will not yield to threats by politicallymotivated scum Ah dont think my members would appreciate that nomenclature Well thats what they are isnt it Marxist scum Oh yeah Reds under the handbags ll flush em out Right were all coming out then Youre all sacked Right you bastard Inside Britains troubled car factories there wasnt much talk of the national good In our remaining carmakers had been merged into one gigantic company British Leyland With factories and workers this would be our secret weapon to fend off the foreign invaders Instead of having the scattering of Rover agents Triumph agents agents Leyland agents and so on well be able to provide a tight compact organisation which will enable you to get parts service and sales anywhere throughout the world Saw The Light by Todd Rundgren Right from the start ran into trouble Almost every week saw more strikes led by a new generation of union militants Immediately the decision for action is endorsed by the membership All of those in favour please show Yeah Wed have preferred not to have gone on strike We had no alternative In the Midlands the motor industry is of course the big employer But recently well its been going through a pretty bleak time Last month for the first time ever foreign carmakers grabbed half the British market Of course there were strikes in German car plants too But you could count them on the fingers on one hand and still hitch a lift home in a new Golf Its easy to blame Leylands woes on a handful of union extremists But Britains car workers didnt just want more money they often wanted more professional respect The problem that weve had in the country for so many years is that being an engineer or being a mechanic is not a respected profession its seen as somebody who bashes a hammer against a piece of metal its not credited with any skill at all and not regarded Whereas in other countries and Germany in particular you will find theyre all professors and doctors and they are so highly qualified While Britains car workers sick of their primitive conditions were fighting the class war Germanys factories were being radically modernised David Buckle worked on the steel press line in the Cowley plant in the mids On behalf of his union he went on a factfinding mission to s Wolfsburg plant in And what he saw there blew his mind Unlike here where we worked on individual cars they had a huge round table and there was a car door on each point of the crucifix that was one set of car doors While one operator was working on one door robots were working on the other We hadnt had robots in this factory we knew nothing about robots Right Today Cowleys Mini plant has more than its fair share of robots Of course we could have installed robots earlier if wed wanted The tragedy though was that British Leyland shrank from radical modernisation not least because they knew that the unions would never stand for it Meanwhile the Germans were racing ahead Mercedes for example were already working on cruise control airbags and antilock braking You could even buy a bulletproof Mercedes British Leylands cars werent even rustproof This was our answer the Austin Allegro Unfortunately the ads were the best thing about them Allegro has vroom for five Allegro has vroom for five By now British Leyland had become the embodiment of what the Germans were calling the British disease Every year cars like this one the infamous Austin Allegro with its square steering wheel and Spanish Rose interior were making thumping losses Every week there were more strikes And what made the Allegros failure so resonant was that across much of British industry it was the same story complacent management chaotic production militant workers and yet more strikes Indeed if theres one statistic that speaks volumes of the difference between Britain and Germany in the s its this one In for every day that German manufactures lost to industrial action we lost ten We lack the commitment we lack the discipline and we lack the interest in being industrially competitive My honest feelings is its not in the English soul to massproduce motor cars Whereas the massproduced motor car is think the most complete expression of the German psyche And while cars like the Mercedes were testament to Germanys new ambitions British cars were notorious for slow delivery and shoddy workmanship Who can forget this wedgeshaped beauty The Austin Princess Take The Long Way Home by Supertramp That wedge shape that it has was very much in vogue in the s It was car to have God youre beautiful Oh what finish what style Cos youre the joke of the neighbourhood What undermined it was think there a strike almost straight away and then there were a couple of significant quality issues that came about because it hadnt been sufficiently well engineered One was and it sounds rather dramatic and in a way it was the rear suspension would collapse New car George Certainly is Much room inside Mustnt grumble you know average Goes well does it Well average When British Leyland launched the Princess in the slogan ran not the car for Mr Average That was a shame Because the key to the Golfs appeal was that Mr Average rather liked it The Floral Dance Desperate to save the company the government brought in a new man to run British Leyland a ruthless South African called Michael Edwardes Did you hesitate for some time about taking the job One of the decisions had to make was whether the job was doable at all And came to the conclusion that somebody could do it And that maybe could do it So could Michael Edwardes really turn British Leyland around These are newlydeclassified documents from the first months of Margaret Thatchers new administration in and they give you a real sense of the despondency at the top about British Leylands prospects Now were asking for an extra million from the taxpayer in just to keep going and this is a memo from Thatchers Cabinet Secretary Sir Robert Armstrong in which he says Every year things get worse instead of better The productivity is atrocious Their market share has slumped from in to just in the last two months It begins to look as if the illness is terminal Now if you think thats bad this one is from her Chief Policy Advisor Sir John Hoskins And he says British Leylands prospects are nearly zero but they have to give British Leyland the money he says because the public demands support for Edwardes Its an intriguing sign of the sheer importance of the car industry in the public mind in the s that even Margaret Thatcher the arch privatiser shrank from cutting it or closing it down because the car industry was seen an indication of our national virility If the car industry went we would be impotent on the industrial stage s But British Leyland had one card left car theyd been working on for almost a decade modern competitive young sexy and heavily subsidised by the taxpayer The Mini Metro Launched in British car to beat the world Some of you may have noticed that for the past few years Britain has been invaded by the Italians the Germans the Japanese and the French Now we have the means to fight back Rule Britannia The new Austin Metro British car to beat the world The Look Of Love by The Metro cost and sold more than a million It became almost fashionable Even Prince Charless fiancee Lady Diana Spencer drove one But although the Metro was one of the bestselling cars of the s it was never going to be enough to fend off the German competition My parents had a Mini Metro a lot of people did It was on the surface it looks like quite a successful car but was it The sales figures predicted for it were wildly optimistic They really did think they were going to sell a year and it never came anywhere near that think they sold in the first year The Metro was up against the Volkswagen Polo and it was up against the Ford Fiesta so the Metro was in a way an afterthought it was something that came very late Now Alan youre going to have to trade down your Rover for a smaller car Go on picked up these brochures for the new Metro Its Its a lovely car Lynn And if you do Lynn m not driving a Mini Metro But you do have to make substantial savings Lynn m not driving a Mini Metro But if you do you can keep Pear Tree Productions with a skeleton staff of two Theres no point finishing the sentence because m not driving a Mini Metro Dont You Want Me by The Human League The truth is that the Mini Metro never really stood a chance British Leyland had fallen into the trap of fighting the last war not the current one Their adverts harked back to the past when they should have been looking forward And crucially they never really understood the importance of an uptodate brand It was in the s that we really began to define ourselves by what we bought and what we drove This was the decade of Levis the Walkman Nike and Armani The decade when ad men sold us designer sunglasses and a motor to match In Germany one carmarker more than any other realised that for people making money in the s and there were lots of them the priority was to look good And to look good you needed the right badge on your motor Now you wanted your car to have sex appeal but you also wanted it to be reliable It is after all quite hard to look good when youre standing by the side of the road waiting for the German equivalent of the This is the Munich headquarters of the Bavarian Motor Works Its their equivalent of Volkswagens Autostadt They call it Die Welt the world An appropriate hub for a company with global ambitions This is where young Bavarian families come to worship at the altar of the automobile And thats the point This is where suck you in This is where they get you gigantic tribute to the allure of the brand All the German manufacturers theyve built these cathedrals these temples to themselves Its somewhere between a department store and a museum And a cathedral You go there to visit and to desire or you can go there to purchase Its again its another Its again more emphasis on seriousness mean buying a car in Germany is not just a grubby transaction which involves transferring money from one account to another Its engaging in an immensely serious culturally rich and occasionally rather beautiful and moving event Feel Love by Donna Summer The car that really made s name was their iconic Series It was slick sporty and stylish Along with the Germanmade Porsche it was car of the s But the key to its appeal wasnt the engineering it was the idea When you bought a you were buying into that archetypal s concept a lifestyle What does having a mean to you Comfort Status Yes suppose so yes Status Sounds awful doesnt it So its status suppose it does status Yes success One of s thrusting young salesman put it this way The he said was not just a capitalists car it was an entrepreneurs one a risktaking ambitious individuals way of saying that they were doing rather well Saab he said was a socialist dentists car Volvos were for dabblers in antiques Mercedes belonged to the company secretary An Audi suggested that you didnt quite have enough money for a Mercedes And a Rover was a cry for help In Margaret Thatchers Britain the badge became a status symbol as one young salesman discovered Now this is where a dashing young salesman called James Ruppert enters the story Because you were a salesman on Park Lane think Thats right It really was when the yuppie was born and you would have people coming from from the city and they would sort of make a pilgrimage up to Park Lane in their lunch hour or after hours and drive a car and want to buy it delivered more cars to the centre of the city than any other place can remember that so Almost every day d be driving a car Early morning d pick it up drop it off and another banker very happy indeed with his braces But as the Welshman behind s marketing freely admits a brand is all in the mind In the premium segment were clearly selling an emotional product You know it comes with a strong brand but you know what is a brand brand is effectively a promise you know its a promise of innovation Its a promise of outstanding design its a promise of fantastic materials Its a promise of technology on board Its a promise of safety Of course it is still a car But thats not what want you to think Theyre selling an idea an illusion that the right car will make you happy But there is genuinely good engineering beneath the hype And behind the wheel of a even grumpy old men can get carried away Honestly havent driven anything this sort of perfect since dont know since the original Golf in fact But the real story of the s wasnt just the triumph of individual German car brands It was the rebranding of Germany itself Thanks largely to the success of its cars the land of sausages sauerkraut and lederhosen was now becoming distinctly cool Even the German language so often dismissed as guttural and ugly was now a potent weapon Every year the Schmidts the Mullers and the Reinharts drive to their holiday villas The Schmidts car is slow and rather noisy The Vorsprung Technik campaign is one of the cleverest advertising campaigns ever The Mullers drive a big thirsty car It allowed us to mock the Germans The Germans always have tried to be first on the beach and the Germans always You know theyre domineering bossy people The Reinharts drive an Audi But at the same time they quietly acknowledged that Germany was also a source of excellence And the moral of the story is if you want to get on the beach before the Germans youd better buy an Audi Vorsprung durch Technik as they say in Germany British Leyland has announced a loss of over million for the first half of the year more than the loss for the whole of last year By now British Leyland were dead The company had been split up and sold off and in the last heir to British tradition of mass car production the last company to make the Metro the Rover Group passed into the hands of Well of all people the Germans as part of s expanding empire But you know the really humiliating thing that not even the Germans could turn Rover around It carried on losing money and after just six years they got rid of it Of course the fact that had bought Rover was enormously revealing For by the s our factories were becoming offshore outposts of Germanys automotive empire Now not even Britains greatest hero could resist the allure of a German motor Right now pay attention First your new car agile five forward gears allpoints radar Selfdestruct system and naturally all the usual refinements And as the supreme symbol of their continental ambitions the Germans were all too keen to embrace Europes new single currency the Euro With trade barriers down and their neighbours borrowing and spending as though thered be no tomorrow Germanys manufacturers were laughing all the way to the bank Of course thered be a sting in the tail for the Spanish the Greeks and all the rest a whopping great bill But by then the only people who could bail them out were the Germans The Euro has been good for the Germans Theyve never sold so many Audis to Athens so many Mercedes to Madrid But as their ads suggest Germanys carmakers now have genuinely global ambitions Hot Coool Eight out of ten German cars are actually sold outside Germany Now not just to their traditional customers in Europe and America which incidentally have carried on growing but to some of the most dynamic developing countries in the world Brazil Korea India Russia Last year you know they sold half a million cars just in China Now heres the interesting thing What are some of the most prestigious brands Theyre British Brands Take when they got rid of Rover they did something very very clever they kept hold of Mini and in they relaunched Mini to tremendous acclaim We took on Mini which in essence was a small car you know great character Was over years old and had a history in the Effectively the growing up of many many people and not just in the all around the world But more importantly we turned it into a brand And now there are seven members of a family but very very clearly under the brand of Mini In just years have sold over two million Minis in more than countries But the Germans didnt stop with Mini own RollsRoyce too Even Bentley perhaps the most prestigious of all British brands answers to Volkswagens steely commanderinchief Bentley is a good example of how its still possible in your country to make beautiful cars and sell them for a profit And the Crewe factory is an example of how to fire up your workers for a car often go to Crewe where we make a beautiful car and the people there have a real passion for cars They are very productive and they make great cars with great quality leather really nicely designed And thats a good lesson for Great Britain in how to save British industrial jobs You could hardly want a more dispiriting symbol of how things have changed than a German chief executive patting Britains car workers on the head Weve all come a long way since the days of Ivan Hirst What Crewe and Cowley and the other surviving British car plants prove is that there was never anything inherently wrong with our workers We always had the skills What we didnt have though was the right management the right unions the right branding or the right instincts And in the end we paid the price Of course there is a bright side We do still make one and a half million cars a year most of them for export And thanks not least to the Germans thousands of people do still have jobs in Britains remaining car factories But theres no escaping the fact that we are making cars for our old rivals the profits lining the pockets of Germanys economic titans What an irony Once our car industry was one of the Germans chief competitors now its one of their biggest assets an essential prop of Germanys new economic empire But you know rather admire them for it They were down on the knees and they worked their way back For more than years they got things right and we didnt And now from their car showrooms to their national finances the Germans are the envy of the world And that is why like so many of the cars on Britains roads Europes st century may well end up being made in Germany Still at least one drivers back in a Britishmade car Were changing vehicles James Bond Theme by Monty Newman and John Barry And if you cant quite run
