Drangheta a hard word to get your tongue around So lets just call it what it is The Calabrian Mafia They arrived in Australia early last century and established a power base in the farming country of New South Wales because thats what they were peasant farmers They grew fruit and vegies alright But that wasnt their only cash crop When marijuana came along They coudnt believe their luck They went into the dope business bigtime and made a fortune and like Mafia back home in Italy They protected their pot of gold with tooth and claw swear didnt do it Didnt we pay you enough Plenty never took the stuff Just tell the truth You stole from the crop we pay you to look after Youre gonna knock me anyway Just tell me the truth And you wont knock me There is a chance pinched plants Youve got hundreds of thousands out here Listen sold them but ll get them back to you Its not a problem got a bit now and ll give you a bit No please told the truth told the truth Yes you did And you will go to heaven Arggh Ohh with a limp And when God says Why do you limp You tell him the truth too you thieved No Antonio Over the years They notched up dozens of violent murders Police coudnt ignore them forever But how do you crack open an organisation like the Mafia Theyre a family They dont trust outsiders They never talk business on the phone and they never roll over For a long time His name Colin McLaren Its a jungle out there In the s The Australian Government set up police operations across the country to find out ex actly what the Mafia was up to and stop them was part of the Victorian task force and thats the man m talking about Colin McLaren And thats his team investigators Italian translator Squirrels including me was a squirrel Nothing to do with acorns It was our nickname for surveillance operatives And there were the bean counters Loyalty is the core of Dranghetas success You cant simply join Drangheta You have to be born into an Drangheta family Drangheta grows by marriages between the families Antonio Russo is married to Maria Ricci Shes the daughter of Carlo Ricci Hes been the boss of the Griffith shebang for aeons Antonio has inherited the reins from Carlo Blood gives Drangheta its strength Blood and absolutely no mercy Arggh Hi Dad Hey Love you Got soccer tomorrow Dad When was the last time forgot Never Come on Ciao We started by buggering up their marijuana business using satellite surveillance to bust their crops years before Google Earth Three fucking crops in a month Fucking satellite How can the fucking thing see a marijuana crop from outer fucking

Excuse me Have you got a sec Um m a bit lost m looking for uh What is it Market Street Do you know where that is Oh Market Street that one So they must have unloaded little marijuana babies But they cant be going to grow them in there Theres not enough room No Mr Russos got somewhere else in mind Antonios plan hydroponics on a massive scale Which needed a huge shed Tons of equipment and some poor fool who was desperate enough to let his property be used by the Mafia Theyre tooling up to grow under lights Theyre shifting the marijuana babies into this shed here out of sight of the satellites Put them under growing lights turn on the irrigation million worth Antonio Russo connected to the plants Rosario Torcaso connected to the shed So weve got more than enough to do them for conspiracy to cultivate Conspiracys pissweak Roger This is the top Drangheta brass As soon as theyre in that shed with the growing lights turned on theyre up to their eyeballs in cultivation possession and distribution years years to serve That cuts the Drangheta head off So were looking at what a month When theyre in well move ll pencil a month into the time line The clocks ticking remember month Even

the box Hes bright bastard Mmm the Shepparton farmer he er he telephone to Antonio Russo The farmer says his wife now change her mind She wants nothing to do with Drangheta full stop And Antonio says
