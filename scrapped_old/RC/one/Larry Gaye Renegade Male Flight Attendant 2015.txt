life the greatest the greatest was the time spent with you Then why did you leave Because was an idiot who thought that not being tied down and going from woman to woman to woman to in some cases women plural Go on Would be a fun fulfilling lifestyle but the truth is it was soulless and empty All that meaningless sex was just filling a hole And by hole dont mean vagina Or in some cases guess do mean vagina know what you mean April Is there any chance you could see your way clear to taking this idiot back Oh gosh Larry Did you really think you could just waltz back into my life because you were finally ready and d be sitting here waiting for you Kind of yeah Oh no Its too late Youve moved on You were the one thing in my life that was real and true and blew it Gah How could have thought

Karl Oh Larry Listen when you left and never heard from you again that hurt me But when you left Donnie that didnt just hurt me that hurt him know and didnt want to leave But didnt believe could be any better at fatherhood than my own father was But then landed that plane safely and realized that can take care of my son And being with him and being with you thatll keep me on the ground for good So youll really not fly anymore Oh Well that is shockingly painful Like more than would have ever imagined Come here Larry Elizabeth Gaye m coming April Elizabeth Fornicowsky And by coming mean approaching not ejaculating know what you mean Aww Donnie Donnie Daddys staying Really Yes really Its okay guys You can go And so retired my apron leaving the door open for someone else to finally win the Golden Coffee Pot And because of the way the wiring interfered with the planes radios Federated Airlines was forced to abandon the Flightpal project Three weeks after that fateful flight landed April my beautiful bride and mother of my wonderful and no longer bastard son Donnie And the feeling of crushing empty loneliness that dogged me through the years well turned out to be a gluten allergy Six months later found myself at a bookstore in downtown reading this last chapter of my book And then something unbelievable happened looked up and saw Dad Dad Its me Larry Larry Larry You look wonderful Son You too Dad You must have come to ask my forgiveness for walking out all those years ago and to beg me to allow you back into my life Thats exactly right Larry thats why m here Well

closed the book to thunderous applause Uh it said thunderous applause Four seems like plenty Fine
