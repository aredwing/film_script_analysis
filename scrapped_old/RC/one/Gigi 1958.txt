lack of tact And when did l display any lack of tact lt was a most congenial weekend So congenial that Gaston returned canceled all engagements and left Paris that same evening for Monte Carlo He did For how long For what they describe as an extended stay But why lt doesnt matter why lt may be a blessing in disguise lt gives us time Time for what For Gigis lessons of course See to it that shes here every day Do you really think lts a chance But a chance that we must take From now on dear sister its work work work lessons lessons lessons Pick up the coffeepot with one hand and the cup and saucer with the other Always both Never the coffeepot alone Like this Aunt Your grip on the saucer must be firm but not obviously so The saucer must seem so much a part of your fingers that one would think it could only be removed by surgery Now pour and be sure the coffeepot is upright before you take the cup away There must be no drops Now give it to me l dont take any but be sure and always ask about cream and sugar Now serve yourself And remember the firm grip No the coffeepot first Now you will try it once more Remember you will go to the door properly turn walk in properly and sit down properly Now go on And not like a marionette Keep your shoulders level Now turn walk back and sit down And dont flop into the chair lnsinuate yourself Thats better Now rise and exit the same way Dont

bore One has to be as rich as you to be bored at Monte Carlo l brought Gigi some caramels Really Gaston you spoil her too much Would you like a cup of chamomile tea Please Please Mamita Look Gaston Four yards of material in the skirt Well dont l look great ladyish You look like an organgrinders monkey An organgrinders monkey What happened to your little Scotch dress And that ridiculous collar

and your sister My congratulations to you both What have you done Why did he fly off the handle He knew ld answer him back You ungrateful little thing How can you be rude to Gaston when hes been so good to us And just when we were trying so hard to make an elegant young lady out of you To show you off to your best advantage You must admit one doesnt have to turn oneself inside out for an old friend like Gaston lts silly lts absolutely silly lve decided your new dress may not be as bad as all that l didnt see it properly and perhaps l was a bit cruel To prove it lll take you for a drive for tea at the Reservoirs in Versailles Would you like that ld love it Gaston wants to take me to tea at the Reservoirs Youve come back Gaston How tolerant you are l hadnt really gone Were going to tea at the Reservoirs No youre not lm sorry Gaston What do you mean Grandmama please Gigi go to your room for a moment l have to talk to Gaston about something No Grandmama Gigi do as youre told Mamita what does this mean Something has changed here lately l can feel it Sit down Gaston Please Gaston you know my friendship for you My friendship and my gratitude But l must not forget my duty Gigis mother has neither the time nor the mind to take care of her And Gigi isnt just another girl Shes special Of course For years youve been giving her candies and trinkets and she adores you Now you want to take her in your automobile to the Reservoirs for tea lf it were just you and l l would say Take Gigi wherever you want l would trust her with you anywhere But there are others Gaston You are known everywhere For a woman to go out with you alone now with the eyes of Paris on you Are you trying to make me believe that if Gigi goes out with me shell be compromised Let us say she would be labeled young girl who goes out with you is no longer an ordinary young girl Not even a respectable young girl Mamita this is absurd As far as you are concerned it would be just another news item But in this case l would not have the heart to laugh when l read it in the newspapers This is too ridiculous to discuss any further l dont want to contradict you and l dont want to argue about it lf you feel youre protecting Gigi from some cruel fate thats your affair l understand responsibility to Gigi better than you lll do all l can to entrust her only to a man wholl be able to say lll take care of her lll answer for her future Now can l get you your chamomile tea Gaston No thank you l have an appointment and lm late already But forgive me if l wonder madame whom you are keeping her for Some underpaid bank clerk wholl marry her and give her four children in three years Youre upset Please To see her married in white in a dingy little church to a plumber wholl only give her a worthless name and the squalor of good intentions Very well madame Very well lf thats your ambition inflict your misery in the name of respectability l pity you l pity you all Upset What utter rubbish Pierre do l look upset Yes monsieur you do Upset Upset indeed Shes a babe Just a babe Still cavorting in her crib Eating breakfast with a bib With her baby teeth And all her baby curls Shes a tot Just a tot Good for bouncing on your knee am positive that she Doesn t even know That boys aren t girls Shes a snip Just a snip Making dreadful baby noise Having fun with all her toys Just a chickadee Who needs a mother hen Shes a cub a papoose You could never turn her loose Shes too infantile To take her from her pen Of course that weekend in Trouville In spite of all her youthful zeal She was exceedingly polite And on the whole a sheer delight And if it wasn t joy galore At least not once was she a bore That recall No not at all Shes a child silly child Adolescent to her toes And good heaven how it shows Sticky thumbs are all the fingers She has got Shes a child clumsy child Shes as swollen as a grape And she doesn t have a shape Where her figure ought to be It is not Just a child growing child But so backward for her years If a boy her age appears am certain He will never call again Shes a scamp and a brat Doesn t know where she is at Unequipped and undesirable to men Of course must in truth confess That in her brandnew little dress She looked surprisingly mature And had a definite allure It was a shock in fact to me most amazing shock to see The way it clung On one so young Shes a girl little girl Getting older it is true Which is what they always do Till that unexpected hour When they blossom like a flower Oh no Oh no But Theres sweeter music When she speaks Isn t there different bloom About her cheeks Isn t there Could be wrong Could it be so Oh where Oh where did Gigi go Gigi Am a fool without a mind Or have merely been too blind To realize Oh Gigi Why youve been growing up Before my eyes Gigi Youre not at all That funny awkward little girl knew Oh no Overnight Theres been breathless change In you Oh Gigi While you were trembling On the brink Was out yonder somewhere Blinking at a star Oh Gigi Have been standing up too close Or back too far When did your sparkle Turn to fire And your warmth Become desire Oh what miracle Has made you the way you are Gigi Gigi Gigi Oh no was mad not to have seen The change in you Oh Gigi While you were trembling On the brink Was out yonder somewhere Blinking at a star Oh Gigi Have been standing up too close Or back to far When did your sparkle Turn to fire And your warmth Become desire Oh what miracle Has made you the way You are Mamita are you alone Good l have an important business matter to discuss with you Now let us recapitulate To begin with he said she would be spoiled as no other He said she would be spoiled as no other woman has been before lts all right but its vague l like everything spelled out Did he say precisely where she would live He said a suitable house on the Avenue du Bois Youre sure Of course Well very good Servants Yes he mentioned servants What about an automobile l think so lm not quite sure She must have an automobile and a chauffeur lm sure he didnt mean to be evasive or ungenerous He suggested that you and l and our lawyer meet at his lawyer tomorrow and draw it up in detail You call him and tell him to bring his lawyer to our lawyer Well draw it up in detail You mustnt be suspicious Alicia Gigi doesnt know yet How could she He just left But he wants to have dinner with her this evening When you speak to Gigi be sure and stress the difficulties of the situation not the delights The role she will have to play Shes a naive thoughtless girl You must warn her not to ask for the moon Not only will he not give it Dont worry about her You think shes like you Actually you dont know her Theres no meanness in her at all Thank you very much l mean she has no material ambition l understand He should send a present before tonight Let me know what it is Yes l will Wont you sit down You know why lm here Yes l know Do you want to or dont you l dont want to l dont know what you want You told Grandmama l know what l told your grandmother We dont have to repeat it Just tell me simply what you dont want and tell me what you do want Do you mean that Of course You told Grandmama that you wanted to take care of me To take care of you beautifully Beautifully That is if l like it Theyve pounded into my head lm backward for my age but l know what all this means To take care of me beautifully means l shall go away with you and that l shall sleep in your bed Please Gigi l beg of you you embarrass me You werent embarrassed to talk to Grandmama about it And Grandmama wasnt embarrassed to talk to me about it But l know more than she told me To take care of me means that l shall have my photograph in the papers That l shall go to the Riviera To the races at Deauville And when we fight it will be in all the columns the next day And when youd give me up as you did with lns des Cvennes Whos been filling your head with all these old stories How do you know about that Why shouldnt l know Youre world famous l know about the woman who stole from you The contessa who wanted to shoot you The American who wanted to marry you l know what everybody knows These arent the things we have to talk about together Thats all in the past over and done with Yes Gaston Until it begins again lts not your fault youre world famous lts just that l havent got a world famous sort of nature When its over Gaston Lachaille goes off with another lady And l have only to go into another gentlemans bed That wont do for me lm not changeable That wont do for me Grandmama and Aunt Alicia are on your side but this concerns me too And l think l should have something to say about it And what l say is it wont work lt wont work Are you trying to find a way to tell me that l dont please you That you dont like me Oh no Gaston Oh no l do like you lm so happy when lm with you Gaston couldnt we go on just as we are Maybe seeing each other a little more often Youre a friend of the family Nobody would think anything of it You could go on bringing me licorice and caramels and champagne on my birthday And on Sundays we can have an extra special game of cards Wouldnt that be a lovely little life wonderful little life Except that you forget one thing lm in love with you You never told me l havent known it very long l discovered it when l was away from you ln Monte Carlo You are a wicked man Youre in love with me and you want to drag me into a life that will make me suffer You think nothing of exposing me to all sorts of terrible adventures ending in quarrels separations pistol shots Sandomirs and poison Please listen to me l should never have believed this of you Never Whats the matter Whats happened She doesnt seem to want to What do you mean l mean she doesnt want to Are you going out of your mind As God is my witness l explained it to her Believe me You explained too much Youve trained her to know nothing but the sordid and the vulgar But what about kindness sweetness benevolence What of the tender heart bulging with generosity These things exist too madame Or have you never heard of them Uncle lll tell you Europe is breeding a generation of vandals and ingrates Children are coming into the world with icecovered souls and hatchets in their hands And before they have finished theyll smash everything beautiful and decent Have a piece of cheese No thank you l envy you Uncle l envy you your age For you it was different Youve been clean and good and its been appreciated But not anymore lts over All over lm sorry to hear it little salad No thank you lmagine this if you can Here is a girl living in a moldy apartment decaying walls wormridden furniture surrounded by filth Youre ruining my lunch Nothing to look forward to but abject poverty My heart was touched l wanted to help her l offered her everything House car servants clothes and me And She turned me down Turned you down Turned me down lts impossible lts not impossible lt just happened Obviously that disgusting apartment she lives in has driven her mad Her grandmother was delighted Grandmother Yes Mamita But Gigi No no no Not Gigi She refused me She turned me down l was refused rejected rebuffed and repudiated Theyre a very peculiar family with peculiar ideas l negotiated with them myself once With me one casual bit of grazing in another pasture and the gate was slammed behind me What did you do l left immediately Bravo The absolutely right thing to do Of course And when she sends for you which you realize she will Of course l know she will This is plainly a maneuver for better terms Dont you go back l wouldnt go back for anything in the world After all you behaved like a perfect gentleman No question about it You made your offer in good faith before any emotional advance An act of the purest chivalry l dont know any other way And if she doesnt appreciate the nobility of your conduct if she uses the beauty of your nature as a weapon for bargaining then shes obviously not worth the chivalry or the nobility lts no ones fault Youre too good for her Do you know how long it will take you to forget her By tomorrow noon at the latest Why not consult your little book and meet me at Maxims tonight Splendid idea l would suggest a redhead Try Michle l saw her last night She looked heavenly lll call her at once You should She doesnt have many good years left See you at Nine sharp Goodbye Honor Poor boy Poor boy Downhearted and depressed And in a spin Poor boy Poor boy Oh youth can really Do a fellow in How lovely to sit here In the shade With none of the woes Of man and maid m glad m not young anymore The rivals that don t exist at all The feeling youre only feet tall m glad that m not young anymore No more confusion No morningafter surprise No selfdelusion That when youre telling those lies She isn t wise And even if love Comes through the door The kind that goes on forevermore Forevermore is shorter than before Oh m so glad That m not young anymore The tiny remark that tortures you The fear that your friends Won t like her too m glad m not young anymore The longing to end a stale affair Until you find out she doesn t care m glad that m not young anymore No more frustration No starcrossed lover am No aggravation Just one reluctant reply Lady goodbye The fountain of youth Is dull as paint Methuselah is my patron saint ve never been so comfortable before Oh m so glad That m not young anymore Yes madame Charles lm going out Order me a carriage immediately Yes madame Right away madame Would you repeat that again please She doesnt want to She doesnt want to She doesnt want to Such stupidity is without equal in the entire history of human relations lt must be your fault lt must be You mustve emphasized the difficulties instead of the delights What did you say to the little monster Gigi is perhaps a little slow about certain things but just because shes not attracted to Gaston doesnt make her a monster lt doesnt make her a princess What did you say to her Did you tell her about love travel moonlight ltaly About hummingbirds in all the flowers and making love in a gardeniascented garden l couldnt tell her that lve never been further than the Riviera Couldnt you have invented it No Alicia l could not lts incredible lncredible Where is she Perhaps l should talk to her and tell her what shes missing lts the glory of romance forgetting everything in the arms of the man who adores you listening to the music of love in an eternal spring And when eternal spring is over What difference does that make lt makes a difference to Gigi And lll tell you something lm not sure l dont agree with her Youre a fool And your granddaughter takes after you When l think of the time and effort lve lavished on that idiotic
