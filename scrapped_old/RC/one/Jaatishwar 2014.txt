right leg and his fathers huge business From childhood itself he did not get along with his brother Kelly Outside his bedroom there was a Banyan tree That was Antonys only friend When water dripped

Library Salary ten thousand rupees have rice in the morning and go to work Are you trying to mean what the fu Rebirth Dont be so flabbergasted Rohit The first time saw myself too was shocked choked out of fear For a few hours had no memory from either of the births complete black out was at Asansol back then had a good job at a private firm The doctor said was getting nightmares due to work pressure So took leave for a few days and went to Hazaribag One evening had gone for a walk Far away at some temple the evening chants were going on Suddenly had this vision saw the royal family of Debs in Kolkata The courtyard Kabigaan am singing So many people Lights The hall the applause And a hefty looking man came and put a garland a garland around my neck a garland Mr Kushal Mr Kushal No Mr Kushal The same story the same visual year after year like a movie My birth my childhood getting addicted to Marijuana then getting out of it And Saudamini And then Kabigaan Gorokhhonath Learning Bengali writing songs in it In the end in the end What Nothing was used to the visions by then And through books and investigation came across some names and places through which figured out who was in my last birth also understood that cant continue with the job in Asansol for long because my senior manager had come to know that had been visiting a psychiatrist They created such a fuss so quit the job and came and settled here And this new job am mad Yes no mean not quite err but You dont believe me No too could not believe After all m a rational middle class Bengali engineer may be proud of Ritwik Ghatak having written the film on reincarnation Madhumati or even be excited to watch Rays film on reincarnation Sonar Kella Heard of lan Stevenson Famous Canadian biochemist and psychiatrist Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation No The case of Shanti Devi who was declared to be a Jatiswar by a scienctific commission set up by Mahatma Gandhi Jatis Jatiswar Someone who has memories from previous birth But know Not just Shanti Devi hundreds of such cases or thousands of scientific reports would still keep wouldve not had any effect on my cynicism had this not happened to

dont know what the cure is how long ll be able to survive this way dont even know how long ll be able to remember that m Kushal Hajra My previous births memories are spreading in my mind like cancer m melting in to the dark and still youll say am m sorry didnt mean to Can suggest something Come to Kolkata with me You know the disease not the remedy So lets go and see the best psychiatrist in town Then lets see if we can save Kushal Hajra from Antony Phiringi Dont worry about the expenses ll take care of it And in any case in return need something from you So dont worry No favors are being done here What Youll have to tell me the entire story of Antony need it for my dissertation And may be for my life Intermission Hello were now with the fifth documentation of the coursework It has been about seven days weve come to Kolkata have already had two sessions with Mr Kushal And weve covered most of Antonys early life The plan is to gather as much information as possible about Antony before we can crosscheck for authenticity with historical sources So today well look into the musical career of Heynsman Antony Somehow Antony had been able to come out of the infamous company of weedsmokers Slowly he had started with his music Kabigaan was very popular back in those times So to listen to Kabigaan for the first time Antony went to Raja zamindar Gopi Mohan Debs court Shovabajar courtyard The Kabigaan fight was between veteran bard Horu Thakur and his exstudents Nilu Thakur and Bhawani Benes group Inspite of having many students Horu Thakurs favourite student was Bhola Moyra sweetmeat maker Which is why Nilu Thakur and Bhawani Benes were very jealous of him So the group of students disintegrated They formed a new group It was midnight Horu Thakur started singing Only if had known beforehand my friend That Lord Krishnas emotion is indeed a venomous potion Only if had known beforehand my friend That Lord Krishnas emotion is mixed with a venomous potion Only if had known beforehand my friend The Honoured my friends in all innocence Wouldnt have been deceived in this way The Honoured my friends in all innocence Wouldnt have been deceived in this way Only if had known beforehand my friend That Lord Krishnas emotion is indeed a venomous potion Only if had known beforehand my friend Just after Horu Thakurs Sakhisangbad got over Sorry Sakhisangbad whats that part of Kabigaan There were mainly five rounds in a Kabigaan duel Bhawani bishayak where various songs were sung about Goddess Uma or Durga Sakhisangbad which was about Radha and Krishnas love story in Vrindavan Viraha written about normal people sad love songs Kheur songs about gods and goddesses which had frivolous sometimes rather indecent lyrics And Lahar direct personal attack Insulting the opponent by singing the most indecent of verses Thanks Please continue Brilliant Salutations Nilu Thakur realized that Horu Thakur had impressed the Raja and the audience much before he reached Kheur round So instead of singing Kheur he sang Lahar and started insulting Horuthakur with his vulgar verses But that did not help According to the Raja and the publics verdict Horu Thakur won And Antony acquired a new passion Kabigaan But it must have been very difficult Err mean know that Antony had been hearing Bengali all around him since childhood he could even speak it But writing songs in that language Of course it was difficult Initially he used to speak Sanskritized Bengali because he had learn it from the books Later by interacting with the natives as in the villagers he learnt the colloquial version too He had written songs but in Protuguese not yet in Bengali And then something struck him The main topic of songs back then were Vaishnav and Shakto Padabali as in Radha Krishna Uma Menoka and many more of such gods and goddesses from the Puranas He began by learning Sanskrit from a tutor at home After all the Language of the Gods It took time But he had learnt Latin from his father as a kid so though he faced problems initially gradually he picked up After learning Sanskrit Antony felt like he had opened a door with a key He discovered a huge ancient magical universe He had heard of it but never seen it But he could see it now He started reading Shastras holy scriptures Vedas Upanishads Puranas Upapuranans he read everthing He had music in him He learnt the topic and the language of the songs But to understand how that language morphed into lyrics of a song he started listening to Bengali folk music Jhumur Panchali Murshidi Bhawaiya hed go land up anywhere and everywhere He listened carefully And hed be on the look out for Kabigaan duels Hed rush to the venue wherever it was village or the city Bhola Moyra Keshta Muchi cobbler Thakur Singha Ram Basu these guys were the masters Is he a Hindu God Or a Muslim Peer Oh tell me tell me tell me Oh tell me tell me tell me So now you understand this Horu Thakur of yours is not the Lord Krishna we know Hes the universe while this ones a retard dense and slow This ones a retard dense and slow This ones a retard dense and slow During that time Antony had been to Kumarkhali to listen to Fakiri music student of Shiraj Shah had become very famous No ones interested in the truth No ones interested in the truth Only brouhaha meaningless Rancour in the name of caste Is indeed a strange business Rancour in the name of caste One who visits the whore on the sly Is called faithless wonder why Listening to his music Antony understood even after the melody the lyrics and the topic of the song a huge component remains The philosophy Lalon wonders what indeed is caste Lalon wonders Fakir Lalon wonders Lalon wonders Lalon wonders what indeed is caste strange deception which never ceases Rancour in the name of caste Is indeed a strange business Rancour in the name of caste No ones interested in the truth At a point he realized a Dnarakabi group was Sorry Dnarakabi Ameteur bards As in you could say an amateur group So Antony thought of forming an amateur group Which is when he met an upcoming Bnadhandaar Gorokhhonath Sorry Bnadhandar was the person who would compose the lyrics for the bard Its not that all bards would sing songs written by themselves The groups often had Bnadhandars So youre coming Hope there will be some depressing snacks for lunch For sure And some fat books on Bengali literature to be used as paper weights Fine then ll have a look at my schedule We need to screen a lot of bands We need to separate the wheat from the chaff Yes More than a thousand bands have registered And the judges will be divided into groups to screen them Your remuneration Everything depends on my work pressure There will be a bit of work pressure at that time but ll definitely try to make it ll be happy to judge Okay listen when you go to meet Rupam please take me with you think hes very cute You havent heard Rupam Islam music enough to find him cute Shut up moron Oh please Hello brother were hungry Come fast Listen get us one Keema Matar one Chicken Bharta two boneleess Mutton tadkas and Nan for any of you None of us Four Tawa rotis well tell you if we need more And one Masala cold drink without lime Salad Onions No You can find mouth freshners in India you know No you see onions arent good for health Dont overdo it Youll have to see a doctor eventually What you need more than a doctor Mr Hajra is rest These hallucinations visions or nightmares whatever you call them if they keep increasing then its going to take a toll on your Heart Tell me something new doctor Something dont know Like will this ever get cured Will it ever See ve spoken to three internationally acclaimed parapsychologists regarding your problem ve had a detailed discussion with Dr Debasish Ghosh here as well Let me explain This part of the brain is called Hippocampal gyrus This is our memory centre New and old all memories are stored here Now this Hippocampalgyrus can be aroused in many ways Like ringing bells in temple chants chanting of the word Om etc all of these generate Hz brainwave At this Hz Hippocampal gyrusstarts resonating During that the old memory even past life memory may come back Now the second possible explanation Theres a gland called the Pineal gland here which is called the Third eye Now we dont know how or why this gets aroused but if it does your lost memory may suddenly come back The third explanation is genetic memory Carl Jung said Collective unconscious Were all connected to each other in some way or the other via our This too is possible that you may have a genetic connect with the person whose memories have come back to you Whatever that may be now the problem is the memories that are coming back to you if they keep increasing in frequency and intensity it may subvert your present memory and turn these memories into your dominant memories And during this not only schizophrenia and split personality theres a chance of identity crisis or memory replacement too Just a minute Can you explain this in an easier language As in how long will his normal memory last As in before he Before lose himself Well difficult to say Matters of the brain you see May take weeks or even a year Depends on the rate of replacement by the dominant memory See due to the neural plasticity of the Hippocampus a consolidation of memory occurs May lead to a regression too As in this growth may become slower It may even come to a halt one fine day Yes But how Avery common and easy way is reconciliation As in revisiting the places and the people whom you see in the visions No thats not working Thats why shifted to Chandannagore from Asansol but it increased Next as in is there another way There is another way Past life regression Do you have any trauma from your past life that had given you a big shock Or a very important task that you couldnt complete Mr Hajra were you looking for someone or something Or are you still searching Dont worry think whatever had happened think you must not worry about this Things will get better You Hey wait Stop the car Stop What happened What happened Mr Kushal where are you going Mr Kushal Dont go

is like a commencement with instruments like dhol and kasha As in like musically challenging your opponent As soon as that happened as in Antony started getting tense It was the first duel after all But the moment mean Antony stood up the moment he started singing the Viraha written by Gorokkho that was it The public the judge and the opponet went mute The first time when you went on stage did

Bengal and Bengal belongs to me belong to the soil of Bengal and Bengal belongs to me Bengal belongs to him Bengal belongs to him Not only Viraha Kheur and Lahar my most popular genre was the the welcome songs of Mother Goddess Durga Hail Goddess Mahamaya Your endless clemency Hail Goddess Mahamaya Your endless clemency One who invokes you Mother Durga You take care of his destiny Hence cry out to you Mother in this mortal world cry out in distress But you pay no heed to your son Mother Why are you so heartless Admitted have been a bad son But why will you be a bad mother Like you were

Hello brother When Where How Slow down Too many questions at one go Holy Christ Youve got a huge place So Mr Disco Dandia whats up with you Your Mr Disco Dandia has taken to Raybne she dancing now Oh my God What have you done Which Bengali cleansed your Bengali pronunciation m surely sending Gaby to you Not a Bengali Portuguese What Close your mouth a fly may get in Can you give me some weed Though after this a couple of reefers wouldve had the same effect Hey listen just want to meet Uncle Reincarnate once please Please He is sleeping And he isnt keeping well too Okay Obviously that happens later then And whats going on with your music Have you been able to serenade Maya yet ve got a chance Okay As in like a show You know Radio Mirchi Theyre doing a concert Shes the main organizer ve been selected also But theres a hitch Hitch lied during the registration that have a band Or they wouldnt allow And dont know anybody in the band circuit At least if could get some musicians Or leave it to the hands Right Dont worry Well arrange something will take you to someone My senior from the Medical college days here Like a friend think hell be able to guide you well Dont worry The decision has to be taken today itself Of course Weve to Thats why came We need to finish this Remember everybody Listen to me everyone Lets listen to what he has to say Then we speak Here he comes Wait Hello brothers Listen you untouchable youve married a Hindu girl rescuing her from the Sati pyre Weve not said anything Youve been breaking all rules Respected people in the village have lost their caste because of you We didnt say anything But today when we heard Will you stop listing his blasphemies and get to the point Fine ll get to it Today we heard youre planning to organize a Durga Puja Thats true Then listen this Puja will not happen Why Were staying here at the outskirts of the village without bothering anyone Shut up Weve already told you this puja wont Go inside Mini Go in Listen Antony Sahib ll tell you why this Puja cannot happen Youre a Christian by birth Moreover youre poking your nose into our traditions our customs even our festivals Even the Viceroy would not have dared that crow doesnt turn into a peacock putting on a peacocks feather And an amateur poet doesnt become a Bengali by singing a few Kheur songs And Durga Puja Thats our very own Bengali festival Therefore Listen brothers Goddess Mahamaya herself decides who is a Bengali and who isnt am just a humble devotee Worshipping her is my duty will do that You may do anything you want to dont mind at all Goodbye What am thinking is am a judge at the same competition Will it be correct if guide you dont have any interest in in competing there just want to sing this song for someone there If need be declare an out of competition Just a minute Sing it for someone as in The same cardiac case everywhere Well well Good In that case ll say that your song is very nice really liked it unique composition got a very special feeling in it So its better not to approach it with a typical drums bass guitar guitar keyboard set up So what do you suggest How you should arrange this song how you should present it think there is only one person in Kolkata If he agrees to help you youre done Youll get a set of musicians and then if he agrees to play along nothing like it Do one thing ll give him a call and speak to him Then you can go meet him Sing him your songs And thats it Thank you Sidhu didnt imagine youll help us like this Dont be so formal ve been in college too isnt it And in such cardiac cases my emotion works a little more Rita from and Bodhi from National college when they had just begun ve contributed a lot in that Fine Whos this person All arrangements will be made on time Only you wont be there know youve become very famous now Youre very busy Fine one day when you come back youll find my dead body lying here Then ll kill myself and lie down in the grave beside you No That wont happen Why will be buried because married you will be cremated Will you stop have duels on all the three evenings of Durga Puja And on the last night m competing with Bhola Moyra at Sovabajar And thats a duel had to fight With this the last chapter of my life began My last Kabigaan duel Even a birth later when those incidents emerge in my mind just like a film When reached Raja Gopi Mohan Debs palace that evening saw it was a huge affair Bhola Moyra was waiting therewith his group to attack me We took our seats The competition began As the night fell the fight became tougher Both sides got equal appreciation from the Raja and public in Bhawani Bishayak Sakhisangbad and Viraha So it was obvious that the judgement would be made in the Kheur and Lahar rounds Here you are needed to talk to you theres a problem ll have to reach the venue directly from the airport on that day No problem There will be a car waiting Thats very good nothing thing the main thing hows the participation looking like Some very good bands have registered Looks like itll be a tough fight Come Love engulfs the soul Love engulfs the soul In faraway lands you roam come back to an empty home In faraway lands you roam come back to an empty home The heart explodes worry and fret And grapple with my lovesick state Love engulfs the soul As the mind is on a roll Love engulfs the soul Love

once more have Embraced this rebirths trap Time and again we have come back To the Earth the callings strong Sometime Gangur or Kopai even In Kopotakhkhos song Gangur turned into Cauvery and Often Mississipi too Rhine and Congo as rivers wrote Their music whole life through will not have never written Down music ever before Let wanting you reflect in folk Songs unwritten score When fell in love with you thousand births ago Buddha painted his loneliness In the evening glow His kindness had you wander in Solitude begging for alms And yearned for an yearning you As met those outstretched palms On my knees those times found me am still on my knees Come bewitch with eyes with palms Outstretched in dreams come please Place your lips on my parched lips Lets build a barricade new swear by the Revolt and Love only desire you Enchanted by my dreams you had Taken births endlessly was your scream your desire and Revolution your fury Whenever pain had touched you know That that touch was my hand am your man am your roots am your motherland Whenever you had borne a child Its father was my desire Lost count of our children who Have lit our crimson pyre We come back n we come again Each time we go back too Will come again declare again only desire you We come back n we come again Each time we go back too Will come again declare again only desire you
