railroad the world has ever seen Well completely understand our distress sir Whats going on Well sir two weeks ago we managed to have the army hang one of the local farmers Thats good No unfortunately not sir Uh a group of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows Not only did this inspire resistance in the other farmers but the redoubtable Allan Pinkerton was seriously injured in the incident Leaving you in charge of operations until he should return further impediment is that the army garrison has been ordered to move on away from Liberty so we no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers You see the army leaving you see the loss of a tool see a power vacuum to be filled As we have the most power we may move with impunity see sir ll get together

have done that all right but d have made sure killed em all first want them arrested and hanged Do you think a jury in these parts would convict one of their own Uhuh doubt it Were beginning a very interesting game here Mr Rains This is no game Well m afraid our adversaries dont agree Rock Island Pacific Railroad Depot was robbed just outside of St Louis Missouri The brave and daring JamesYounger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West Fine piece of writin The gang destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land Who wrote this ll see em hanged every Tuesday for a month Oh thats the
