grandchildren What is happening now dont know cant hear Everyones shouting Thanks for coming in The ambassador from Paris Good evening sir Yes ve just spoken to our ambassador in Paris maam m afraid its not good news No No No No No No Diana Princess of Wales has died after a car crash in Paris The French government announced her death this morning What have got on this week Writing your conference speeches Well lets cancel everything else This is going to be massive Her death was confirmed by the French ll make a statement in the morning ve started coming up with ideas Shes only been dead an hour Would you prefer didnt Try and be very brave Its Mummy Shes dead Theyre going to go back to sleep Try anyway My private secretarys office have found a travel agency in New York that will sell me a flight to Paris with an hours stopover in Manchester Perhaps you might consider if its an extravagance to bring back the mother of the future king of England in one of our planes All right Of course John dont want the boys to see the news and get upset Take the radio from the bedroom and the from the nursery Yes maam Well well well Yes Are you all right Your sister called from Tuscany hope you told her to cut her holiday short did cant imagine she was pleased Thats putting it mildly What did she say Something about Diana being more annoying dead than alive Never let the boys hear you talk like that Of course Something to help you go down No think ll write my diary a little longer Fine m going to bed Weve heard nothing official from the palace We dont know when well get any statements from the palace or when the royal family are due Thats how she will remain in our minds our hearts forever Got it Where will you do it At the church on the way in ll organise it Viscount Althorp Dianas brother Hang on want to watch this This is not a time for recriminations but for sadness However would say always believed the press would kill her in the end Not even imagined they would take such a direct hand in her death as seems to be the case It would appear that every proprietor and editor of every publication that paid for intrusive photographs of her has blood on his hands today Not the press mate Youve got the wrong villain Tony Oh Got to go You about to speak to the Queen Yeah Ask her if she greased the brakes Now now Thanks Hello Putting you through Oh Right Is the Prince of Wales with the boys Yes maam Good And hes going to Paris Yes m sorry to disturb maam Maam but have the Prime Minister for you from his constituency Lucky you Thank you Robin ll take it in the study Your Majesty Prime Minister May say how very sorry am The thoughts and prayers of my family are with you at this terrible time and with the princes in particular Thank you Is it your intention to make some kind of appearance or statement No No certainly not Noone in the royal family will speak publicly This is a private matter We would appreciate it if it could be respected as such see dont suppose anyones thought about the funeral Weve spoken with the Spencer family and it is their express wish that this should be a private funeral with a memorial service to follow Right As Diana was no longer a member of the royal family we must respect their wishes see You dont feel that in view of her high profile and popularity it might be an idea to pay tribute to her life and achievements or even just to her as a mother Well as said its her familys wish And the public maam the British people You dont think that might be denying them a chance chance to what To share in the grief This is a family funeral Mr Blair not a fairground attraction think the Princess has already paid a high enough price for exposure to the press dont you If theres nothing else the children have to be looked after Of course Goodbye Your Maj Her instinct is to do nothing say nothing and give her a private funeral Are you surprised She hated her guts think its a mistake They screwed up her life hope they dont screw up her death Where can get a black tie Oh the chaplain called He asked if he should make any changes in the service any special mention of Diana What did you say told him not to change a thing Quite right The less attention drawn to it the better for the boys Yes We should find some company for them some young people ll take them for a long walk up Craggy Head Yes but no guns Philip It is Sunday Were going believe to Sedgefield the Prime Ministers constituency where he is about to make a statement Yes the Prime Minister coming now with his wife Cherie Yeah well apart from that Hes on Alastair hes on Come on Though her own life was often sadly touched by tragedy she touched the lives of so many others in Britain and throughout the worid with joy and with comfort The people everywhere not just here in Britain everywhere they kept faith with Princess Diana They liked her They loved her They regarded her as one of the people She was the peoples princess and thats how she will stay how she will remain in our hearts and in our memories forever bit over the top dont you think The Prime Minister paying his tribute to the Princess of Wales The people of Britain he said kept faith with Princess Diana They loved her She was the peoples princess Do we have the Royal Standard Yes sir And flowers Yes sir If we left it to the royal undertakers theyd bring her back in a crate Hello This is Lord Airlie May speak to the Prime Minister One moment please Lord Airlie The Lord Chamberlain in charge of the funeral Youre meeting him at the airport Lord Airlie Good afternoon Prime Minister Its my job to organise all the ceremonial events Theres no precedent for the funeral of an ex Perhaps we should plan for any contingency propose a meeting tomorrow morning at Buckingham Palace officials from all three palaces representatives of the Spencer family the emergency services and your people Absolutely Of course Precedent Where do they find these people Thank you Brigadier Sir Charles Wood Air Commodore Wessex Prime Minister m so sorry sir If theres anything or my government can do They stood up as we drove past in cafs in restaurants removed their hats This was Paris and you could hear a pin drop imagine it will be the same here The palace prefers a private funeral What are your feelings on that think thatll present us with difficulties So do My mother The Queen comes from a generation not best equipped She grew up in the war think what we need what this country needs is a more modern perspective if you follow Balmoral is think understand An aircraft of the Queens Flight brought the Princesss body home where the Prime Minister gathered with members of his government black hearse crossed the Tarmac and a Royal Air Force guard of honour moved forward Has anyone heard from the Spencers Did they say when the funeral will be Hmm dont know Nobody tells me anything President Clinton heard the news last night We liked her very much We admired her work for children for people with for ending the scourge of land mines On our walk today one of the gillies said hed seen a stag up Craggy Head He reckoned points Oh We havent had one as big as that on the estate for years No Quite and was tremendously impressed Anyway thought it might be a good distraction For the boys What stalking You dont think its too soon Anything that gets them out is good as their relationship deteriorated she became increasingly unhappy The couple divorced in August of last year Their love story brought crowds into the streets They came to see the Queen and the Prince but most of all they came to see Diana m going to bed But the fairytale was destined ll ring the Lord Chamberlains office to say well send representatives to the meeting Thank you Stephen She gave us so much Why couldnt we have given her something and left her alone It just hurts me so much ve never experienced anything like this wait to wake up like its a bad dream Right its ten oclock Lets get started Thank you all for coming at such short notice think we all agree that this is a sensitive occasion which presents us with tremendous challenges logistically constitutionally practically diplomatically and procedurally Oh Christ After years of opposition am proud to stand before you as the new Prime Minister Labour Prime Minister want to set an ambitious course to modernise this country to breathe new life into old institutions to make privilege something for the many not the few You think the royals are nutters You should meet their flunkies Two and a half hours to choose between a hearse or a gun carriage You got raves in the press This calls you The nations mourner in chief This lot says you correctly judged the countrys mood Hello Even The Mail was impressed Peoples princess mate You owe me Gordon for you Tell him to hang on Alastair Is it going to be a public funeral Yeah Saturday Its a whopper The Abbey the works Great Has anyone told the Queen dont know No doubt some flunky will be dispatched grovelling on all fours Do you think its wise for the boys to go stalking Anything that gets them out is good Maybe they shouldnt take guns If a photographer saw them it might send the wrong signal If there is a photographer out there he could be the first kill of the day see Mr Fayed was buried last night At midnight No cameras no fuss Very dignified Why do they do that Why do they bury the bodies so soon after death Islamic tradition Something to do with the heat Mmm It stops the body decomposing Come in Good morning maam Maam Yes Robin What can we do for you Er maam there was a meeting at the palace this morning About the funeral arrangements Yes The Lord Chamberlain faxed these plans for you to consider There is now general agreement maam that a public funeral would be more appropriate see And what form will this funeral take At the moment theyre suggesting and of course these are early days basing it on Tay Bridge Tay Bridge What Tay Bridge is the code name for my funeral Indeed maam but it would be for practical reasons only Its the only one which has been rehearsed the only one that could be put together in time But supervised those plans myself Indeed and the Lord Chamberlain was at pains to stress that the spirit of the occasion will be quite different For example the suggestion is that instead of soldiers charities march behind the coffin And instead of foreign heads of state and crowned heads of Europe the guests would include a sprinkling of actors of stage and screen fashion designers and other celebrities Celebrities Oh Er was there anything else No maam Oh yes one other thing The police commissioner was keen that you consider the idea of a condolence book It would give the growing crowds something to do make marshalling them easier Oh yes Yes of course Oh and the flowers What flowers The flowers outside Buckingham Palace Theyre blocking the main gate and making things difficult for the changing of the guard Fine Just move them away The Lord Chamberlain was wondering whether we shouldnt leave the flowers and send the guards through the north gate Oh yes Yes of course Yes quite right Stephen Lamport on One Who Prince of Waless private secretary Balmoral He says its urgent Its all right Good morning Good morning Prime Minister The Prince of Wales has asked me to thank you for your kind words Not at all The Prince feels that you and he are both modern men of similar mind who could work well together at this difficult time Er well please thank His Highness and assure him he can count on my full support at all times Was that it Er yes Goodbye Bizarre Why is Charles doing this What Creeping up to me like this banging on about being modern He did it at the airport He knows that if the Queen gets it wrong over Diana the royals will become public enemy Number One Hes terrified of being shot Who Charles His people have asked for extra protection He thinks if hes seen to be on our side that will leave the Queen in the firing line So its for his mother to take the bullet and not him What a family Wait Where are they Up at Craggy Head ll come with you In you go Do you want me to drive No Certainly not thought you were getting a new one What for Its perfectly all right was thinking what Diana might have done had it been me that died in the tunnel in Paris She would have taken the boys to Paris regret not doing that What and expose them to the media That would have been dreadful Theyre better off here Its private Theyre protected Whatever you thought of Diana she was a wonderful mother She adored those boys and never let them forget it Always warm physical never afraid to show her feelings Especially if a photographer was in sight She may have encouraged all that but still that was the extraordinary thing about her her weaknesses and transgressions only made the public love her more Yet ours only make them hate us Why do they hate us Not us dear What Yesterday when we brought the coffin back there was a noise a bang and thought it was a gun thought someone had taken a shot at me think m going to walk back dont feel like stalking Are you sure ll take the dogs Walkies Yes Who knows the way home Come on Do you think you will ever be queen No dont No Why do you think that d like to be a queen of peoples hearts in peoples hearts but dont see myself being queen of this country dont think many people want me to be queen By many people mean the establishment married into because theyve decided that m a nonstarter Charles and had a talk in the car today He was good enough to share his thoughts on motherhood What did he say How wonderful Diana was Thats changing his tune He thought her natural They see me as a threat of some kind Oh for Gods sake Maybe hes got a point Maybe we are partly to blame Oh cant watch this No no Wait Please no leave it dont go by a rule book lead from the heart not the head and its got me into trouble in my work We encouraged the match We signed off on it both of us You were very enthusiastic remember She was a nice girl Then And was sure hed give the other one up or at least make sure his wife toed the line Isnt that what everyone does Is it Was Mrs Parker Bowles a factor in the breakdown of your marriage There were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded cant bear it If youre watching ll sleep next door Early start tomorrow Any luck with your stag No But close a couple of hundred yards at one point One of the boys even got a shot off Well get him tomorrow See you in the morning Not to worry Nightnight and with her obsession with the belief that Charles loved a woman hed fallen for years before Camilla Heaven Must be missing an ngel Missing an ngel child Cos youre here with me right now The good news is the palace agreed to video screens And the bad news Crash barriers What about them They expect over two million people There arent enough barriers so weve gone cap in hand to the French for theirs Theres something else think you should see Can we run that piece again Of course Youll love this find their behaviour disgraceful What do you think think its disgusting that theyve not said a word relating to all this Look know all this Wait for it not to have a flag up think its a disgrace on the royal family the Queens not in residence but where is the flag Do you see what m saying about the establishment Dont tell me there isnt a flag at half mast over Buckingham Palace Dodi when them two were together it was a fairy tale come true Will someone please save these people from themselves Fine ll call Balmoral Planet Zog ve really got nothing better to do Come on dogs Come on Those fire lighters all right bit damp Oh well brought some stew just in case Its lamb We can have that cold No well be all right Stay Robin had a call from the Prime Minister who expressed his concern About what The flag above Buckingham Palace He thinks it should be flying at half mast hope Robin said there isnt a flag above Buckingham Palace Theres the Royal Standard which flies to denote the presence of the monarch Since youre here the flagpole is bare just as it should be Isnt it possible that for some people the Royal Standard is just a flag and the flagpole being bare sends out the wrong signal No thats not the point The point is its over years old Its never been lowered for anyone Your grandfather didnt get the flat at half mast when he died and if your mother died tomorrow she wouldnt either Yes Granny but in a situation like this one has to be flexible It is just a flag What about the Union Jack Was Mr Blairs next suggestion For heavens sake Next hell suggest you change your name to Hilda Who does the think hes talking to Youre the sovereign You dont get dictated to You conceded the idea of a public funeral Youve opened the parks Thats enough Ssh The boys You wait In hours this will all have calmed down In one sense its comforting Now my parents can see what its been like for me being up against her popularity Theyre still making the mistake of thinking the Diana they knew will eventually be the one seen by the public but it wont The two Dianas the publics and ours bear no relation to one another at all The flag of St George it is at half mast over Highgrove Yes sir Get a picture of that in the papers ll get onto it call in a few favours What about a statement of gratitude to the crowds Something heartfelt from myself and the boys thanking people for the flowers and so on Right Di was wonderful because she stood up to the establishment She said Youre elitist people we are paying to be better than us and you have to get out among the people We have a wonderful Prime Minister Tony Blair a compassionate young man who after is such a breath of fresh air and feel he will do something Is this the stirrings of What dont know Something more interesting Maybe people will see them for what they are Which is bunch of freeloading emotionally retarded nutters Thats just absurd Why They live in a cocoon of wealth and they dont pay tax Yes they do The Queen costs us million a year If you want a serious conversation about the constitution We dont have one About ways in which we could phase out hereditary privileges then fine If youre leaving take the plates Forget the off with their heads bit Why It insults your intelligence The Queen cannot be expected to change Its unimaginable this country being a republic Certainly in her lifetime Why Because noone would wear it Noone wants it Its just daft Its not a mother thing is it What Well if she were alive now your mother would be the same age You always say how stoical she was oldfashioned uncomplaining lived through the war Who does that sound like m going to do the washing up Thats the stalking party off Right wed better have a look at those papers Show us theres a heart in the house of Windsor says The Sun Its proof the royals are not like us The Mirror Time to change the old guard at Buckingham Palace Express One cant help wondering whose advice they are taking for its clearly the wrong advice ll try not to take that personally People have yearned for change in this country The result is a quiet revolution led by the real modernisers the British people Revolution Who wrote this Where does this come from Where does it come from Youve won a huge majority People want a change Why What did you think it meant Hurry dear Your teas getting cold Is that it Yes maam Just the letter of condolence to the widow of the ambassador to Brazil Thank you Tea Mr Janvrin the Prime Minister wishes to speak to Her Majesty Maam apparently the Prime Minister is on the phone Tell him to call back No no Its all right ll take it Prime Minister Good morning Your Majesty Sorry to disturb but was wondering if youd seen todays papers Weve managed to look at one or two yes In which case my next question would be whether you felt some kind of response might be necessary No believe a few overeager editors are doing their best to sell newspapers It would be a mistake to dance to their tune Under normal circumstances would agree but Well my advisors have been taking the temperature among people on the streets and well the information m getting is that the mood is quite delicate So what would you suggest Prime Minister Some kind of a statement No maam believe the moment for statements has passed would suggest flying the flag at half mast above Buckingham Palace and coming down to London at the earliest opportunity It would be of great comfort to your people And would help them with their grief Their grief If you imagine m going to come to London before attend to my grandchildren whove just lost their mother then youre mistaken doubt there is anyone who knows the British people more than do nor who has greater faith in their wisdom and judgement And it is my belief that they will at any moment reject this this mood which is being stirred up by the press in favour of a period of restrained grief and sober private mourning Thats the way we do things in this country quietly with dignity Its what the rest of the worid admires us for If thats your decision maam the government will support it Lets keep in touch Yes lets Bloody fool And now your teas gone cold Tony Robin Janvrin on One He was listening in Robin understand how difficult her behaviour must seem to you but try and see it from her perspective Shes been brought up to believe its Gods will She is who she is think we should leave God out of it Its just not helpful She hasnt seen anything like this since the abdication and cannot emphasise the effect that had Unexpectedly becoming king as good as killed her father m afraid shes in a state of shock This public reaction has completely thrown her All right but first we have to deal with these terrible headlines ll do what can with the press m grateful Prime Minister cant promise anything Its not me they want to see Ask Alastair to come and see me Cancel what m doing tonight Good morning Your Majesty Thomas where have they gone Up to Abergannie Ridge maam All that way Remind me thats right at the fork Thats right maam You follow the track for about a mile and you come to The river One of the lads will drive you No ll manage Thank you Bugger it Oh how stupid Hello Thomas Hello maam ve done something foolish ve broken the prop shaft Are you sure maam Yes of course m sure Its the front one Lost the fourwheel drive Dont forget was a mechanic during the war Are you all right m fine Well come out straight away Thank you very much ll wait by the car You are kind Bye Oh youre a beauty Shoo Shoo Go on Go on Go on There are news crews outside waiting for you to speak to the people Yes Whats all that about told the Queens private secretary d try to help with the press Why Dont you think she deserves it sitting up there on her acres Yes but allowing her to hang herself might not be in our best interests either Besides think theres something ugly about the way everyones started to bully her The first thing that you obviously think about is the rest of your family and Whens she coming to London Mr Blair Shes our figurehead She is She wanted me to pass on to the people crowding around In a spare moment the Prime Minister went down Downing Street How are the boys Not so good tonight lot of slamming doors think they saw the papers Oh no ll take them out early again tomorrow morning Perhaps theyll take it out on the stag What do you think of the royal family Theyve made a mistake Pardon Theyve made a mistake Why What do you mean Well they shouldve came The family should have come down to Buckingham Palace on Sunday all of them That girls been left on her own Shes on her own and the place is empty Oh please Sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair For someone they never knew And they think were mad Have you seen the funeral guest list No suggest you keep it that way chorus line of soap stars and homosexuals Apparently Elton John is going to be singing Thatll be a first for Westminster Abbey Condolence books are being signed in embassies all over the worid and in London alone the number has reached It reminds me of one of those films a few of us in a fort hordes of Zulus outside So its vital you hold firm Stick to your guns You wait They will come to their senses soon They have to Come on move over Cabbage Its six oclock on Thursday th September As people start camping out on the route of Princess Dianas funeral cortge people are asking why the Queen hasnt addressed her subjects This is what the newspapers are saying Where is our Queen Where is her flag The Express Show us you care picture of a grumpy Queen The Mail Let the flag fly at half mast and inside The Queen should be here to show her respects But the flip side is Blair more popular now than Churchill Did they pick up on our statement of support Just the one Statements of support dont sell papers Right Maam Maam The Prime minister for you maam m afraid hes rather insisting ll take it in the kitchen Good morning Sorry to disturb you m expecting a phone call to be put through Out Oh there it is Thank you Peter Good morning Prime Minister Good morning maam Youve seen todays headlines Yes have Then m sure youll agree the situation has become quite critical Maam poll thats to be published in tomorrows papers suggests that of people believe your actions have damaged the monarchy and that one in four are now in favour of abolishing the monarchy altogether As your Prime Minister believe it is my constitutional responsibility to advise the following Is Queen Elizabeth up yet Mummy One fly the flag at half mast above Buckingham Palace and all other royal residences Two leave Balmoral and fly to London at the earliest opportunity Three pay our respects in person at Dianas coffin And four make a statement via live television to my people and the worid Swift prosecution of these matters might he felt just might avert disaster You will have to talk to the Lord Chamberlain have and to Robert Fellowes They both agree with Mr Blair Oh see Somethings happened Theres been a change some shift in values When you no longer understand your people maybe it is time to hand over Oh dont be ridiculous Remember the vow you took declare that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service Your whole life That is a commitment to God as well as your people What if my actions are damaging the Crown Damaging it Youre the greatest asset this institution has one of the greatest it has ever had No The problem will come when you leave but you mustnt think about that now not today Oh Mummy You must show your strength reassert your authority You sit on the most powerful throne in Europe head of an unbroken line that goes back more than a thousand years Do you think any of your predecessors would have dropped everything and gone to London because a bunch of hysterics carrying candles needed help with their grief As for that silly Mr Blair with his Cheshire cat grin Mr Janvrin on the phone for you sir Yes What cant hear Well thats madness The whole thing Bloody madness ve just been told youve decided were to follow the Prime Ministers advice just want to say admire think its the right decision Lets hope we havent left it too late These are historic shots of the Windsors The Queen has had a change of heart Shes clearly responding to the need to feel that the royal family is somehow engaged These flowers have been brought to Balmoral so she can see some token of whats been expressed in London Fish fingers Do you want any ll be right there Thank God for that m afraid theyre a bit burnt From International this is Worid News with Ralitsa Vassileva from Center Queen Elizabeth will deliver a televised address Friday The royal family has been accused of showing little grief over the Princesss death Where are the boys Have they left Yes They left for London after breakfast with Charles Its not right you know No but further discussion is no longer helpful either Oh well It gives the gillies time to find another stag for the boys now theirs has been shot What Havent you heard He wandered over to a neighbouring estate where one of the commercial guests got him Oh Really Which estate Heres your box Theres some policy unit stuff thats important Have you seen the papers thought d skip them Of course ve seen them Not bad eh Your Majesty come to London Who says so Tony Blair Mr Father of the Nation Maam Good morning maam Good morning Is it his lordship you came to see No please dont disturb him came on another matter hope you dont mind There he is Hes a beauty isnt he An imperial maam Fourteenpointer He

he didnt suffer too much Pass my congratulations to your guest will maam God bless you maam Thank you Maam Yes Robin ve done a draft of your television address Thank you Was there anything else No maam Landing in minutes ve got the Queens speech Shall give Tony a copy Let me look at it first Hes next door and the anger as somebody said earlier perhaps was that people grieving need to target their anger at somebody and royal protocol might have got in the way but royal protocol is being swept aside en masse today Come back Diana very serious Her Majesty and the Duke Normally it is a happy occasion when they arrive here and normally when theyre out the front on days like Trooping the Colour Day or Day This is a tragic occasion The Queen is getting out to talk to people Its very unusual This is unprecedented think perhaps the last time the Queen was among her people outside the palace was the day the war in Europe ended Its really as if the public and the royal family the monarchy have had a bit of a quarrel and now its being healed in some measure Like a family spat not unlike the spats they acknowledged with Diana Jenny is quite right to say that whatever the professional ups and downs between the Queen and the Princess They sent a copy of the Queens speech You might want to scrape the frost off it first think the queen was generous in recognising that her oldest son wasnt the easiest chap to be married to sent some suggestions to make it seem like it came from a human Yeah all right Alastair At least the old bat agreed to visit Dianas coffin When you get it wrong you really get it wrong That woman has given her whole life in service to her people a job she watched kill her father Shes executed it with honour dignity and without a single blemish and now were all baying for her blood Shes leading the worid in mourning for someone who threw all she offered in her face and who for years seemed committed to destroying everything she holds most dear Hello Would you like me to place those for you No Oh These are for you For me Thank you Thank you very much Maam theres been a lastminute addition from Downing Street Theyre suggesting adding and as a grandmother here Right So what say to you now as your Queen and as a grandmother say from my heart Do you think you can say it Do have a choice Theyre ready for you Your Majesty Just to confirm this is live Fine Youll be at the front of the six oclock news on all channels Yes Thank you nice and quiet Ten seconds We cross now live to Buckingham Palace for the Queens tribute to Princess Diana Since last Sundays dreadful news we have seen throughout Britain and around the worid an overwhelming expression of sadness at Dianas death We have all been trying in our different ways to cope It is not easy to express a sense of loss since the initial shock is often succeeded by other feelings disbelief incomprehension anger and concern for those who remain We have all felt those emotions in these last few days so what say to you now as your Queen and as a grandmother say from my heart Heart What heart She doesnt mean a word of this Thats not the point What shes doing is extraordinary In good times and bad Thats how to survive Listen to you week ago you were the great moderniser making speeches about the peoples princess Now youve gone weak at the knees Ssh and for her devotion to her two boys dont know why m so surprised At the end of the day all Labour prime ministers go gaga for the Queen What Millions who never met her but felt they knew her will remember her for one believe there are lessons to be drawn from her life and from the extraordinary and moving reaction to her death share in your determination to cherish her memory hope that tomorrow we can all wherever we are join in expressing our grief at Dianas loss and gratitude for her alltooshort life May those who died rest in peace and may we each and every one of us thank God for someone who made many many people happy Dianas coffin now on the move the short distance from St Jamess Palace to her home at Kensington Palace before her burial tomorrow Its incredible Less than a week Who could have imagined such scenes Requiem Requiem Aeternam Dona eis Dona eis Eis Domine Dominus Dominus Domine Domine Diana was the very essence of compassion of duty of style of beauty a very British girl who transcended nationality someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who proved that she needed no royal title to continue to generate her brand of magic would like to end by thanking God for the mercies hes shown us at this dreadful time for taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant and when she had joy in her life Above all we give thanks for the life of a woman m so proud to be able to call my sister the unique the complex the extraordinary and irreplaceable Diana whose beauty both internal and external will never be extinguished from our minds So off to see your girlfriend Now now hope she shows you some respect this time Its quite a debt of gratitude she owes you Mr Saviour of the Monarchy doubt shell see it that way Robin Prime Minister Tony please The Prime Minister Your Majesty Do sit down Thank you Its good to see you again after whats been quite a summer m referring to your visit to India and Pakistan where your comments on ending historic disagreements went down well At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting spoke to the prime minister of Malawi He said how much he appreciated your tough stance on Nigeria meant to tell you at the time but er you were being monopolised rather imagine those occasions must be quite difficult clamouring for a private audience Also we havent had a chance to speak since that week wanted to offer my apologies Whatever for In case you felt manhandled or managed in any way No not at all dont think shall ever understand what happened this summer Well the circumstances were exceptional maam and in the end you showed great strength courage and humility You mistake humility for humiliation Thats not true You didnt read the cards on the flowers outside the palace think history will show it was a good week for you And an even better one for you Mr Blair But there are weeks in the year maam and two and a half thousand in the time since youve been Queen When people assess your legacy they wont remember those days Oh really You dont think that what affection people once had for for this institution has been diminished No Not at all Youre more respected now than ever gather some of your advisors were less fulsome in their support One or two but as a leader could never add my voice to that chorus You saw the headlines and thought One day it might be me And it will Mr Blair quite suddenly and without warning So shall we get on with the business in hand Oh look Oh do love this time of day Shall we walk while theres light The clocks go back next week Itll be dark before five do hope youre a walker am Good think meetings have a greater chance of success if the Prime Minister is a walker Its how think best on my feet ve never been one for sitting around good walk in fresh air sorts everything out One in four you said wanted to get rid of me For about half an hour but then you came down to London and all that went away ve never been hated like that before It must have been difficult Yes Very Nowadays people want glamour and tears the grand performance m not very good at that never have been prefer to keep my feelings to myself and foolishly believed that was what people wanted from their Queen not to make a fuss nor wear ones heart on ones sleeve Duty first self second Thats how was brought up Thats all ve ever known You were so young when you became Queen Yes Yes a girl But can see that the worid has changed and one must modernise Well perhaps thats where can help Dont get ahead of yourself Prime Minister m the one supposed to be advising you Come dogs Tell me Mr Blair what might we expect from our first parliament Er well maam top of the list is education We want to reduce classroom sizes Yes And create a lower teacherpupil ratio Broadcast Facilities
