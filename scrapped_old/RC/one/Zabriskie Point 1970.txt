Its the same story for years if youre so clever why didnt you join us from the beginning Now our only choice is to tell them were sorry the university is closed on strike Well blow a whistle when its over What about boycotting military recruitment at the university Theres only one thing to do go to the recruitment offices take a bottle fill it with petrol cork it Yeah but what if we want to blow up sociology instead Listen a molotov is a mix of petrol and kerosene a radical white man is a mix of chat and shit Listen m not here to show you my revolutionary credentials but there are plenty of white students fighting on the street just as you in the ghetto And there are plenty of unsatisfied whites who are potential revolutionaries Here we go again with the same discussion guys When they put you in jail because of a bit of marjuana you become revolutionary But when they smash your face break your head prevent you from living going to school from getting a job then you must become revolutionary Thats why you people say we negroes are living in another Wait a moment Youre talking to white students think we understand Yes a lot of us understand what makes negroes revolutionary but what makes white people revolutionary The same fucking thing that makes negroes revolutionary But it doesnt happen the same way Itll happen dont worry You wont need to do anything to make it happen You can prevent it sure You can break it off You can do everything but you cant For example This country is falling into Fascism cant you see mean now we have police at the university and then Where next Sitting with us in class Inside our homes And then On the street when you go out Are you waiting for that to become revolutionary What mean is that we should close the univeristy thats it and nobody should break our chops if they do itll be at their risk And when they decide to reopen theyll do it on our conditions But why stop people from going to class Why Because theyre against us They prevent us from getting what we deserve Weve tried everything begged negotiated written programs but we havent gotten a damn think and m not alone that everyone knows that the main point of every guerrilla is that the enemy is invisible Things happen and they dont know how and where People who act to draw attention on themselves do it on purpose to divert it from others dont think weve reached this point yet Weve just begun to involve people If you want to close the university what do you want to We dont even have the support of white people Hey listen to me We need mass demonstrations Just a moment The side of the black students doesnt want to give a show We just close the univesity and thats it Speaking of what you say dont agree you know mean about the help from white people It doesnt matter so much Because if tomorrow our agitation is successful every student demonstrator or not black or white will be considered an enemy and itll be easier to keep this tension that weve became a public threat Well then share your opinion There is no more coffee Can you make some more Isnt there any man who can make coffee Now lets listen to you suggest that we form some groups of or that should stay out of the university and that at some given moment should move behind the police Please Yes mean as distracting tactics So the others could have time to reach Just a moment Are cars good to build barricades Cars Inside the university As tactics to Why dont you bring your own here Its a sport car is it ok Bring it here then ll take care of it Is it possible that you dont understand that until Silence Theres only one way to talk with white men and thats in their language if they talk with weapons you answer with weapons its easy But are you ready to die Many black men already did and many others are now dying in this country if were on the top of the movement its because we pay personally m also ready to die Alone But not of boredom Who the hell is he No no its alright he lives with me Maybe meetings arent his forte Sorry but if it wasnt to join us why did he come Why Who has the right to say if he wants to stay here or not What kind of bullshit is that If he wants to be a revolutionary he has to stay with other people otherwise Thats why he came here There is no revolutionary without other people Who was Lenin with no organisation or Castro Even anarchists spent their life in meetings what the hell Tell that guy to start reading the Little Red Book the first page where it says that the revolution cannot break out anywhere without a revolutionary party And that if he continues his middleclass individualism hell lose his life To the end against the middleclass individualism There was an open door on the third floor now its ok Is it allowed to go on the roof mean do you let me go up Regulations have to take a book forgot it upstairs at lunchtime Which book Why dont you eat at the cafeteria How was your holiday Well well meet us later Who can give me
