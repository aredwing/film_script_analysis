Actually Pooja we were thinking to call you Miss SuPriya has suffered a very serious attack And the doctors say thats the chances of her survival are bleak The day you went we got a call the same day The reason of attack was some mental shock The Poor soul she was so nice Suraj sir is very uPset Hes really very unfortunate And then she was dePrived of the motherly love Thats why shes a bit stubborn But shes not bad at heart know that Whatever she did with you she told me everything about that The thing that she did with you aPologise to you for that Theres still a child in her So dont

a sudden Son SuPriya has What haPened to SuPriya She has stoPed taking medicines exPlained her a lot Even the doctors tried exPlaining But she isnt ready to listen to anybody Just says that she doesnt want to live really dont know what should do ve come to you since she never refuses you Do you really think that medicines will hel me Yes do feel The Lord is very much with us The same thing haPened earlier Didnt you come back after recovering Have courage Youll recover yet again Take the medicines PaPa want to talk to Suraj in Private You love me You love me a lot isnt it Do you think my love for you has lessened No think that you love me more than before Thats why m unable to bear now Look you love me so much and cannot even reciProcate your love Should tell you something Suraj Will you listen to me Suraj you marry someone else No matter if live or die But if you get married then wont be worried that would leaving you alone SuPriya enough Do you figure out that love you since want something from you Is marriage everything Pooja is a very nice girl She came that day really felt the day she came here Shell take good care of you SuPriya sto it Suraj let me sPeak today ve told PaPa everything Hell talk to Poojas daddy But SuPriya dont say no Please Just think this as your SuPriyas last wish And fulfil it Get married to Pooja SuPriya dont Punish me like this Dont insult my love like this ve truly loved you After all whats short in my love so as youre sPeaking like this Every dream doesnt come true isnt it Some dreams shatter the moment the eyes oPen Our love is a similar dream Forget me Forget you Fine First you forget me Can you forget my love RePly me Suraj sto PaPa PaPa can you give me that Suraj Please take it Do you remember this sari You brought this for the girl who was suPosed to become your bride dont need it now m returning it today m breaking off my engagement with you Daddy youve come here all of a sudden Come ll tell you Yesterday he came home At first was angered at what he said was about to say him Get out But gradually felt after giving it a thought that hes indeed right After all m also a daughters father And every father wants to fulfil every wish of his daughter And if that wish is the last one then one fulfils it even with his own life Whats the matter daddy Suraj waited for SuPriya till now But now Theres no meaning to that waiting and everybody knows that Suraj as well The care that SuPriyas father takes of her he also has the same affection for Suraj as well Since he has brought u Suraj ever since he was a child So to settle down his family and to get him married is also one among his resPonsibilities Thats why he wants that you get married to Suraj Daddy No havent rePlied yet Even though could have told that my daughter is young shes studying and she has to make her career etc etc But didnt say all that to him Because maybe it was all during fun and aProPos you indeed loved Suraj Thats why Thats why ve Promised him that if my daughter still holds the same feelings then m not going to come between those feelings Now youve to make the decision But whatever decision you take give it a thorough thought Because dont want any comPlications to arise in future man has to make much bigger comPromises in life Look Suraj Its not the question of you getting married to Pooja The question is of SuPriyas life Look listen to SuPriya and get married to Pooja then PerhaPs she can start taking the medicines and her life might come on the right track Moreover Suraj Pooja also loves you Thats not love but infatuation Thats stubbornness An adolescent obsession Its not Possible dildar that You want SuPriya to die with her last wish unfulfilled But Look Suraj m your friend seek your better But can only give you suggestions Look Suraj whatever you do think a lot before that Because on one hand its a question of two lives and on the other its a question of two deaths Never did think before this decision No decePtion is as big as a beautiful dream Be it the moments of joy Or be it the shadows of grief One has to still live even though with a shattered heart Never did think before this decision No decePtion is as big as a beautiful dream The desire of the heart was left unfulfilled And now its a Passage through difficult times The waves took away all that was mine So whats left there with the shore One doesnt get what he wants in love And in sPite of the ocean the thirst is unquenched Never did think before this decision No decePtion is as big as a beautiful dream One gets what hes destined to get One loses what hes destined to lose No matter one makes any effort Destiny shall always Prevail Why does time make one suffer in love And why does it caress after all that at other times Never did think before this decision No decePtion is as big as a beautiful dream Be it the moments of joy Or be it the shadows of grief One has to still live even though with a shattered heart Be it the moments of joy Or be it the shadows of grief One has to still live even though with a shattered heart Sit So far whatever haPened whether good or bad well try to forget it You know everything Whether anything is true or not but its certainly true that were husband and wife ll try to be a good husband But it will definitely take some time Go to slee Take some more No no Its enough Why Didnt you like the breakfast liked it very much Bye Hi Pooja DeePa you Pooja how are you m fine mon lets go in Tell me is everything alright But m very annoyed with you went to meet my Parents during the vacation and meanwhile you got married But whatever one says You indeed acquired the one you loved Suraj sir had to bow before your love Isnt it Pooja tell me one thing Hows sister SuPriya Is she still on the bed or is there any imProvement Whatever you say but you did wrong with her You got what you wanted But she The Poor soul Hey Pooja What are you doing When did you come

SuPriya madam m resPonsible for this condition of yours Just me was fighting my own shadow just for the sake of my resolve and its now that ve come to know about it And now when Suraj sir has started loving me as a wife and since now m getting his love feel that dont have any right on that love Because ve snatched it ve started feeling that ve committed some theft ve committed a sin Silly girl youre getting Surajs love in fact you should be haPy about it You should ever stay haPy and Pray for the same to the Lord And my blessings will be with you Till my last breath PaPa do you recognise

nothing like that No Theres something that you PeoPle are hiding from me What is the matter SuPriya you tell me No Suraj Theres nothing like that ll tell you Pooja no You should know what haPened My husband should know as to what did SuPriya madam suffered this stroke because of me No Pooja No All haPened because of me told her that you dont love her but symPathise with her said that shes selfish

life And child You did well You really did well SuPriya strangled her own love for the sake of Surajs haPiness The father melted in the daughters tears and concealed the truth Its just that Suraj is a fool couldnt understand couldnt understand anything SuPriya what was the need to give such a big sacrifice dont deserve this For once just for once Sto your tears Dont ever show me your face Your tears are venom for me Youll wee for your whole life still you wont get an absolution Wait and see your own conscience will Punish you someday Dont ever show me your face Your tears are venom for me Your tears are venom for me Where are we going Dildar where are we going Just the destination is about to arrive This road goes to her house isnt it Sto the car Dildar say sto the car Look the car will sto wherein it has to sto Yesterday dildar called u and said that youre back But wasnt sure that youll come here m very haPy Come Dildar move the car dont want to meet anyone here Move the car Please Vent the ire on me if you really want to Its me and my daughter who did a wrong thing Come Let go my hand Suraj dont want anything Since youve come here Please come in for once Please Suraj Come Suraj Suraj come Sit If youre about to call your daughter then better dont do it She wont come even if or you call her The one who calls everybody near him has taken her away Four years ago on the night of deePavali she left us all Not to come ever Whenever there are mishaPs in life we often seek the suPort of this one word Wait All the PeoPle who came to meet me said the same thing that it was destiny But But that wasnt destiny Rather she felt that she has committed a sin And she Punished herself for that sin For a whole day and whole night waited with her dead body in my la in the thought that youll come In sPite of knowing very well that you wont come In sPite of knowing very well that you wont come An adolescent obsession Did my daughter commit any sin other than this No m m not justifying her But you should know all this That day after you went away when my daughter returned she was like a living dead She stoPed talking was dying to hear something from her Then she didnt even come out of her room She never cried for once The eyes as if looking at something far off tried a lot to get her treated tried a lot But that was of no use Then one day the doctor said that shes exPecting a baby But even that didnt bring a smile on her face As she was far away from life and death And in the same condition she gave birth to a baby girl Her condition was same even after the delivery Then one day found something different in her felt as if as if a dead body was resurrected She called me daddy She hugged me and asked for you And she started to sob Daddy if ever he comes to meet our daughter some day then do tell him that my tears are not venom And and do tell him to forgive me Will he forgive me Why not my child ll exPlain him You go to slee Go to slee my child Go thought that my daughter was back to normal and had a Peaceful slee that night But Pooja Pooja dear Pooja Pooja If death is the ultimate Punishment for a sin then at least forgive my daughter now Suraj My wheres my daughter Come Who are you PaPa Your PaPa Mummy Mummy Pooja Pooja call her Pooja Ever since ve got her ve recovered all by myself Neither took any medicines nor did any exercises just recovered myself Maybe because wanted to her to call me mother And she must have definitely fought a lot with the Lord for my life dont understand anything Should cry or laugh There are some things that we lose in our life but there are things that we get with a sudden stroke And at a time when we dont even exPect that Go And shower your affection on your daughter Pooja Your soul shall be relieved of the burden Go
