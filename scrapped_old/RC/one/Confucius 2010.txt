General its getting late you should be on your way Go My lord and Ministers Everyone has come to observe the Winter Sacrifice But before we can begin strange occurrence demands explanation Yesterday the officer responsible for the sacrifice of birds reported that one of the ten pheasants prepaired for the ceremony has pecked off its own tail So today must seek your exalted opinions Ought we to cancel the ceremony Or make a delay wish to speak You can speak Su Sunwu Su Sunwu minister of Lu belong to Noble Families In my opinion since the Winter Sacrifice marks the most important sacrifice at year end it must not be delayed nor canceled We address the gods throught this ceremony the omen reflects a message from Heaven therefore the pheasant should be set to fly out from sacrifice To do otherwise would be seen as a disrespect for the Spirit We must obey the will of heaven And allow this bird to live Kong Qiu what is your view Your Majesty your humble servant fully agrees with Minister Shus opinion Then you ministers Your humble servants also agrees with the two ministers opinion Since all are in agreement So be it Let the pheasant be released Into the mountain forests Your Majesty your humble servant wished to speak Speak have a request at the end to the evil ritual of burial of living being with their deceased Master Kong Qiu Why do you have such respect Because today your humble servant Is pleading for this little slaves life Which little slave There he is Uncle Inst that the slave who ran away from your home Kong Qiu He was my familys slave and you took him into

Surely you also to speakup for this wounded boy Today we come here Only for discussing about the Winter Sacrifice This matter is unrelated No there is a close relationship The Zhou Book of Ethic tells us to value a human life above all the burial of slave was praticed in wicked ways It was outlawed since the commencement of the Zhou throne in this Dynasty Our Kingdom of Lu is the ancient home of the Duke of Zhu And know for its ethic We should be innovative with our system and abandon outdated traditions Your Majesty everybody Kong Qiu on my own life ask you spare this young slave Kong Qiu It was Lord Yirus dying wish that those he loved should be die with him It is not cruel to bury this slave Rather it demonstrates the Prime Ministers filiat piety and his love to his father General Gong know You served Lord Yuri for years heard he said many times that he could not live without you Yeah Thats right Given how close you were to him he must still need you that he has passed to the next life If you were willing to accompany your lord in death could not object you to taking this little slave with you You Can you say anything You Bastard It seems the General is not willing to serve his

to Qi King of Qi For almost one hundred years All rulers of Qi have dreamed of conquering Lu and clearing our way to the western border Kong Qiu has already asserted his authority in the Lu court Your Highest perhaps we should celebrate a meeting to congratulate Lu We could invite the King of Lu and Kong Qiu to meet at our border Kong Qiu is a man of literature and not familiar with military affairs He knows about Ethics not bravery During the ceremony well take the King of Lu as hostage then we could discuss how the ruler end the three Noble Families can submit to Qis will What an excellent proposal Minister Li prepare a formal invitation to The King of Lu About having a meeting in Jiagu on forming an alliance between the two kingdoms despatch immediately Yes This meeting at

and slaves than any other city of Lu Be advised those who shriked labor within three days will be dragged out and put on public display Complete at what Archery Please The meeting between Lu and Qi is a serious matter Can your Lordship provide army chariots to protect our king To show our might How many chariots Isnt it supposed to be an alliance meeting Why do you neet suck a show of force As Duke of Zhou taught us Must backup Words with Force Qi is a barbarous country which has long wanted to conquer Lu so we must be prepaired We must be prepaired Good Let us have a match My teacher respectfully request a match and drink to you If you win ll grant you chariots The archery match will begin Please get in the shooting area You have my word If you win theyre yours If you lose youll get nothing Agreed pure heart makes a pure shot Right full score new minister with high ambitions Who would thought BiYi cidatel walls were more than feet high Built to conceal their injustices use

real enemy is from within not across the border hear you had no father Who taught you the shooting skill My father was a warrior but he left this world before his time diligent student needs no teacher learned myself Good Right wins Thanks Prime Minister So you need chariots for the alliance talks Ask him yourself General Gong We have a kingdom because we have an army Who raised and trained

could we dishonour our guest Your Highest Qi and Lu share a close retationship Our ruler has come to rebuild our brotherly alliance Please Please Please It is our desire to respect each other and forever abandon war Although the two kingdoms dont share the same surname but we are like the brother After this alliance the two countries are like one What Master Li said is interesting All the people in the whole world is one family the ministers and officers are just the servants of our kings Therefore both of you excellencies have the responsibility to protect our Emperor Zhous dynasty Excellencies your humble servant advised When this alliance is formed Each state must commit to aiding the other Should Qi oneday find itself at war Lu would be asked to provide chariots to supplement our army Excellent ideas Excellencies Your humble servant would also like to make a request An alliance between us should be found on sincerity We have a request The return of the Three Cities of Whenshang won from Lu years ago in war Let me think about request Your Majesty Your Majesty gentlemens word is golden your highest Thanks for returning our land to us lets drink to it Kong Qiu it

woman to be involved in state affair and control it Madam you are back Your Majesty What so important that the prince need to see you such in a hurry Theres a message from General GongShan Niu wasnt asking you This GongShan Niu he is an army general For the Ji family in Lu He wants to know If we give him refuge in our kingdom So Wei is to become a heaven for castoff now Thats exactly why i dint approve GongShan Niu is ready to serve us Why cant we give him refuge Giving him refuge would give no benefit to the Kingdom of Wei GongShan Niu has served the Ji family for many years anh the Late Ji Yiru was good to him Not only the BiYi cidatel was granted to him taxes were exempted for years And now he turn his back on his Boss What use to have for a turncoat like that could control him Learn to control yourselves first The kingdom of Lu and Wei depend on each other for their survival If we took GongShan Niu wouldnt we offend Lu Have you forgotten The mighty Kingdom of Jin is to our west and the rough Kingdom of Chu is to the South We have enemy on four sides If we lose our main ally What then Get out Next time do not If theres a next time youll no longer be the prince of Wei The prince cant even weigh up gains and losses How can make him the regent Invite Kong Qiu here to teach your prince Then Wei will be safe Your Majesty please write a formal invitation to Master Kong Do you think Kong Qiu would come Master Kongs talents are not recognized the three Noble Families in Lu keep his talent in check Our invitation will be seen as an application of his talent If he comes thats great If he doesnt Lu will put him to better use Lu will prosper and will bring Qi to heel That will suit us too What is this Two invitations from both Wei and Qi We should start using Kong Qiu better or others will take him So how should we make use of his talents One moment This Kong Qiu has no proper line of ancestry Your Majesty gave him a role in court less than a year ago First he was the mayor of ZhongDu Then he was appointed Minister of Law And now were supported to promote him even higher Does Your Majesty plan to make him a living god At the LuQi alliance meeting Kong Qiu regained territory and enhanced our national prestige The whole country praise him for that Kong Qiu was born a commoner however your father had admitted He is an offspring of a Song noble family He won back the Three Cities without using a soldier or chariot He may be a mere commoner but his idead of civilty in government works When my father died Kong Qiu was made the Minister of Law Now could vacate the post of Interior Minister for him when the emperor approves would only serve as the Prime Minister Very well am glad our Prime Minister respects talents as much Good This is wonderful It is the time for talents when countries are in turmoil Besides Kong Qiu most of his disciples are available to serve our country Master Kong this is an outdated tradition The servant dispatched to the palace has reported secretly Minister of the Interior Kong Qiu is not focusing on government work He has been busy to building the Wuzi high platform He claimed the platform is built to protect us from flooding didnt he Yes that is what he said do not trust him and think he has other things in mind Kong Qiu is a mere commoner The Majesty already appointed him as the Minister of Law Now he has

the short term Minister of the Interor Kong Qiu is here to see His Majesty Tomorrow in court will call for Razing the Three City Walls Razing What exactly does that mean When the Duke of Zhou ruled these lands it was established that no fiefdom should build walls around its city higher than feet in height The aim was to prevent the nobles from abrogating power to themselves But in recent decades these three noble families have turned their cities to be their own so have their city walls grown taller humbly propose that the walls of these three cities be razed and to break the separatis That is a serious matter It will stir up discontent Could you win this If you fail youll unleashed chaos everywhere Your humble servant did a fortune reading The reading was Headless Dragon That is very auspicious To strengthen the throne the power of the nobles must be reduced we must cut off the dragons head Serve my man here with the best wine and meal Thanks Minister thank you Didnt say this

of the threee cities how can we abandon the last one Do you know Li Chu has Qi troops amassed on our border ready to invade Once they from an alliance with the city of Chengyi we will be encircled But the razing of the three cities is a proclaimed policy Your Majesty Those with high principle would rather die to protect their belief It is wrong to beg for ones life but to compromise on the principles Who will be left to care about ethics if weve defeated in battle Victory and defeat are what matter not ethics Dont you remember My father prince Zhao was driven out of Lu by the three families and die in exile If the three families turn against me now my fate will be much worse than his Your Majesty Do not say anymore for the past days have been always supporting you So had the Ji

anything Kong Qiu today the laws are not in order Everything is in chaos Yet you still insist on praticing your ethics musics humanity and harmony feel ashamed Not achieving anything Then just let go Lao Zi the founder of the gentle philosophy Taoism Fame and Authority are properties that all people try to obtain One should not take profession of it for long Then what should your pupil do Afterall one cannot hang uselessly on the door like a drinkup wine gourd not contributing to this world How do you know the lack of contribution is not the true contribution The weak one compatible and the mild one linger on Nothing is as soft as water and yet the agressive and the forceful one never triump over it The protect one always resemble water the masters words is profound but am loyal to my choosen path The Masters way is magnificent and shapeless Which trancends the cosmos And is not contrained to the material world My way however is within a dream of mankind Then you should not mind the lack of understanding by others Unlike those what are rich have no gold to give only this simple advice The sacrifice for the year end ceremony is over Has the sacrifice meat been distributed to the nobles and everybody Yes it has And as you ordered none went to Kong Qius household Father Have some of this No point in waiting dont think we will be getting sacrificial meat this year My lord

To be honest have no idea where am heading for Teacher Yan Hui you are very talented You will have no trouble in finding a good position in court If you come with me you will have to leave your home and family behind You will regret it No Never Yan Hui look There is only brambly roads ahead And no prospect for a life of fortune Only a vast wilderness Arent you afraid Tell me what have done wrong May speak Of course Teacher you were wrong to have put all your faith in the King Teacher you once told me that if a man cannot change the world then at least he should try to change himself from within Good well said The humanity taught is right before me why should still complaint Teacher Ran Qiu and had to finish some works before we could come hence we are delayed Thats right teacher Look Weve brought all your scrolls Teacher who will drive your cart if am not around Besides nobody would dare to to be rude to my teacher with me alongside you Thats true Teacher Who would have thought the snore louder than do Lets go In Confucius left Lu with his pupil and began the journey from country to other countries the Kingdom of Wei is in front of us am instructed by His Majesty and his Lady to greeat Scholar Kong The Kingdom of Wei welcomes your delegation Master Kong what is your impression of Wei so far Compared to Lu Wei has a larger population Yes a larger population makes it more difficult to govern and has more potential for chaos Tell me how shall govern in order to prevent the risk of being chaotic By making sure the people all have a prosperous life The vast majority of them are quite prosperous And yet they are signs of social disorder everywhere Then it be the lack of a good social moral surrounding and the people need to be educated Well said The master is truly a sage Then hereby invite the scholar to teach in our country Also land will be provided to build a school for this purpose together with stones of grains every year that should be enough shouldnt it Thank you Your Majesty There is yet a matter that would like you to advice on As you can see Our kingdom Wei is vulnerable on all four sides Every one of our neighbors would want to conquer us So d like to invite you to train Weis military As a wandering exile dare even speak of soldiering at all But have heard from somewhere Master is knowledgeable in warfare If Your Majesty speaks of sacrifical rituals do claim to have some knowledge of them But on military matters m afraid they are not my speciality at all So let it be then But theres one thing you absolately must agree to Your humble servant is a guest here your wish is my command My royal consort Nanzi is eager to see you You wont say no will you Yes ly lord Better not to see her Does the teacher not know that Nanzi has ill repulation This woman is great beauty But she is a succubus She had bad repulation in the Kingdom of Wei Teacher You do not know about her past story This woman was raised in the house of the Songs ruler In Song she had an affair with the prince there was a scandal This kind of gossip is trivial Do you know who manages the Kingdom of Wei now The King Who else dont think so Weis internal politics are very chaotic there are many seats of power But can see that the real power behind the throne is Nanzi What kind of a man is this Kong Qiu In my view he is just a poor and disheveled scholar He is just a bookworm full of ethics and musics Poor he may be but we could build up friendship This Kong Qiu is a worthy man so you must treat him well still hope one day we could ask him to be the teacher of our prince have already promised him stones of corn every year Please be seated Master Our Lady would be here soon Your humble servant Kong Qiu greets Our Lady Are you the famous scholar Kong Qiu Scholar Kong please be seated Thank you our Lady have heard one of your axioms is true benevolence is the love of mankind Does this benevolence extend to a woman with a repulation like mine heard that you are teaching The Book of Odes here Yes am also love poetry There is one poem Beauty is what a gentleman seek out for Could you tell me what that means The poem means Even while courting a gentleman observes all proprieties Of the poeams in The Book of Odes so many pieces speak of love All pieces we could use one sentence to explain In true love there is no evil Since was a child have taken a liking to poetry Will you take me as your student have taken on a new student in Wei his name is Bu Shang Although still quite young he is some sort of prodigy While studying The Book of Odes under me he was shown much insight So humbly recommend that he becomes your studycompanion Our Ministers consider your theories of civilty in government to be impracticable Do you truly beleive they can work Ruling with civilty will benefit the state its community and its people Why couldnt be out into practice Without civilty a state will descent into chaos It is human nature to be lascivious and greedy and will rage wars to these ends Since this is human nature it will be quite a task to overcome them Then it will be the true measure of a gentlemans worth Master do you really beleive a gentleman should carry himself as someone with high morality standard And all this seems to be really important to you It is my belief that when one is converted to a life of civilty in the morning he wouldnt mind to give up his life Teacher will you stay longer in our country so we can meet again That would not be convenient How so Why inconvenient For have never encountered anyone who loves a little virtue as much as love worldly beauties Worldly people could probably come to understand the masters sufferings But few will ever truly grasp the depth and breath of those sufferings It seems we should leave Wei now Whys that This land will soon descend into chaos Worldly people could probably come to understand the masters sufferings But few will ever truly grasp the depth and breath of those sufferings Scholar Kong is there lets go and take a look at him Commander Huan Kui have order Kong Qiu must leave Song Second bow third bow Teacher you may commence your class Poetry books ethics musics these must be studied by all gentlemen So today we start to study together Duke should treat their minister with courtes and minister serve their Duke with loyalty If our belief is based on love to our parents and the emperror The the world would be harmonious All trades would prosper Take it simply we could serve our parents well we could placate our neighbor countries we could also learn a lot including name of birds animals and plants This is the order of Commander Huan Kui Get out of Song Stop Trees are going to fall Watch out Teacher let leave here quickly Teacher lets go Excuse me master which way to the river crossing The river crossing Whos that man sitting on the cart He is scholar Kong Scholar Kong The famous scholar Kong Qiu from Lu Indeed Itsnt he suppossed to know everythings Then he should know where the river crossing is Would it better for you to stay here and farm rather than drifting around with him and you could also stay away from the chaos Thats right Stay here and be a farmer Thats right Stay here and be a farmer like us No work no one food Please stay here Lets go Move on well ask for the direction later Fei is there any news of Kong Qiu They say spent some time in Wei then went to Zheng and now in the Kingdom of Chen When the country at war we miss the good generals and when the country is in the difficult time we miss our great minister At that year when we talked about the alliance with Qi Kong Qiu won back the three city peacefully But we sent him into exile It is now clear we were misguided by the Qi Now that the Duke of Lu is dead and a child has inherited his throne Qi wants to take this opportunity to invade us Our strength is no longer what we used to be If we go into war we are lack of good commander Now have a mission for you Bring Kong Qiu back to Lu Father we treated him bad and force him into exile If we are going to invite him back People will mock at us Why dont we invite his disciple Ran Qiu back first He is the head pupil of Kong Qiu and a proven capable commander He would be more than capable to confront the Qi Army That would be fine Lets invite Ran Qiu back at once Wake up Quick Teacher wake up something terrible happens The Wu is invading Chen we must leave at once Have you seen an old foreigner stranger is outside the citys eastern gate Qis army is at the doorsteps of Lu Teacher Master Ji ask for your consent to allow Ran Qiu return to fight for Lu Master For the sake of Lu you must consent Teacher we must not let Ran Qiu go Only when they are in trouble they start thinking of us Remember how terrible they have treated us How did you find me An old farmer told us he has seen a foreigner at the east side forehead resembles King Yaos shoulders looks like Zichans Had the air of an important man but looked as scaggy as a stray dog We guessed it must be you dont dare to be an important person and actually dont resemble anyone famous The old farmer got it just right when he said of a stray dog though Teacher you have taugh us to practice what we learn and our motherland is in peril The Prime Minister is asking Ran Qiu to return That proves it is a matter of life and death for Lu As natives of Lu we cannot just standby and watch Well said Yan Hui Lu is in danger should allow you to return and save Lu from disaster Ran Qiu You should go will wait for the good news Teacher once the battle is won will come and bring you back to Lu Kill em Greetings Prime Minister Father General has lived up to our hope He
