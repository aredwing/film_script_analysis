back then We had records and comics in common Check it out man Pretty scary You dont know the half of it man Eventually people got hip to Crumbs artwork and he started hanging out with the bohemian crowd After a while he got sick of greeting cards and moved away to San Francisco where he got the whole underground comic scene off the ground Hed come back to Cleveland every few years and people would treat him like a celebrity Once he came to visit when was feeling real bad It was right after my wife left me She got so mean to me at the end like l tried to keep her captive or anything like

done l figure the guys who are doing animal comics and superhero stuff theyre really limited Because they got to try to appeal to kids And underground stuff like yours has been really subversive and its opened things up politically but theres still plenty more to be done with them too Pass the ketchup The words the pictures they could be more of an art form You know like those French movies or De Sica over in ltaly So anyway l tried l tried writing some stuff about real life stuff that the everymans got to deal with These are all about you Yeah Youve turned yourself into a comic hero Sort of but theres no idealized shit Theres no phony bullshit This is the real thing man You know ordinary life is pretty complex stuff These are really good Really you think so Yeah this is great stuff l dig

called Revenge of the Nerds lts about a group of nerd college students who are being picked on all the time by the Jocks So they decide to take revenge So what youre saying is you identify with those nerds Yes l consider myself a nerd and this movie has uplifted me Theres this one scene where a nerd grabs the microphone during a pep rally and announces that he is a nerd and that he is proud of it

l noticed that a third Harvey Pekar was listed in the phone book Now this filled me with curiosity How can there be three people with such an unusual name in the world let alone in one city Then one day a person l work with expressed her sympathy to me concerning what she thought was the death of my father She pointed out an obituary notice in the newspaper for a man named Harvey Pekar And one of his sons was named Harvey These were the other Harvey Pekars And six months later Harvey Pekar jr died Although ld met neither man l was filled with sadness What were they like l thought lt seemed our lives had been linked in some indefinable way But the story does not end there For two years later another Harvey Pekar appeared in the phone book Who are these people Where do they come from What do they do Whats in a name Who is Harvey Pekar Weve got shirts for sale upstairs if youre interested Heres our man a year later Somehow made it through the treatments and the doctors are optimistic guess
