that we would not want anything like this to jeopardize the warm relation and successful economic ties shared by our two countries So we have assigned our best man to supervise this case He handled the Tehran incident for us masterfully There is no one more qualified to bring this to a mutually beneficial conclusion Inspector Richard Bonjour Sir Minister This is Minister Tang our liaison from the Peoples Republic of China Its an honor to meet you sir The honor is ours The minister tells us you are the best of the best Well the minister is too kind If that were true might have been able to avoid this tragedy m hoping that you might help us understand what went wrong so that we can avoid further bloodshed And hopefully bring this matter to a quick and satisfactory conclusion If we could be showed the facts Yes of course Please Uh as you know as soon as you informed us of the criminal activities of the gangster Sung we set our operation in motion We identified his heroin smuggling routes into France And in the spirit of cooperation we graciously accepted your offer to have one of your people Liu Jian come over to assist us in Sungs arrest as he was meeting with his French contact who unfortunately we havent yet identified Here he is surveilling Sung as we were waiting for the contact to arrive And here hes observing along with us And then for some reason we still cant understand he went completely insane Left the room to pee and next thing we know hes knocked out the bodyguards killed Sung and the prostitute This is the gun he used to murder Sung Chinese police issue Do you recognize it Yes Good Oh we have also verified his fingerprints on the weapon Well please feel free to verify our findings with your own people We assume that your man was part of the conspiracy that he murdered Sung to keep him from being captured and testifying in your courts as you had requested But that is only an assumption We are hoping you could give us some background on him which would help us in his capture Inspector Liu Jian was top in all his classes at the academy He received the highest training in martial arts weapons and police tactics Hes been decorated for bravery in the line of duty six times been promoted five times and has never lost a case He has no wife no children His only dedication is to his work Hes our best which is why this is all so
