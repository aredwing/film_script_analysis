My name is Turkish Funny name for an Englishman know My parents were on the same plane when it crashed Thats how they met They named me after the plane Not many people are named after a plane crash Thats Tommy He tells people he was named after a gun But know he was really named after a famous th century ballet dancer Known him for as long as can remember Hes my partner Doesnt mean we hold hands or take walks It means try to keep him out of as much trouble as he inflicts on me give him a hard time Keeps him in check But really hes like my brother What do know about diamonds m a boxing promoter was a happy boxing promoter until a week ago and then What do know about diamonds Dont they come from Antwerp Himy would you listen to this Do we have a choice It wasnt meant to be taken literally Its a nice story Adam and Eve Its bound with moral fibre but asking a grown man to believe it What is it Well what is it What you want should do drop my pants Okay go through Its a nice story Its just that Just a story Catholic religion is based on a mistranslation Enough already Ruben say something Listen Are you busy ll tell you the whole story The Septuagint scholars mistranslated the Hebrew word for young woman into the Greek word for virgin It was an easy mistake to make because there was only a subtle difference in the spelling So they came up with a prophecy Behold the virgin shall conceive and bear us a son You understand It was virgin that caught peoples attention Its not everyday a virgin conceives and bears a son But leave that for a couple of hundred years to stew and next thing you know you have the Holy Catholic Church Oy vay what are you saying m saying just because its written doesnt make it so Gives them hope Its not important whether its fact or fiction People like to believe dont want to hear anymore Anyway who is it that were seeing Michael Hello Mutti Rudy Rud Rud let them in please Rud its okay let them through Michael Mutti Youve kept us

governor Goody gumdrops Get us a cup of tea would you Errol Grab hold of his legs What do you think m gonna grab him by his ears Hope this is not a bad moment Do you know who am do Good That will save me some time then Well dont Youre always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece Apparently the best thing to do is cut up a corpse into six pieces and pile it all together Would someone mind telling me who are you When you got your six pieces you gotta get rid of them Its no good leaving it in the freezer for your mum to discover Then hear the best thing to do is feed them to pigs You gotta starve the pigs for a few days then the choppedup body will look like curry to a pisshead You gotta shave the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out for the piggies digestion You could do this afterwards of course but you dont want to sieve through pigshit do you They will go through bone like butter You need at least pigs to finish the job in one sitting so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm They will go through a body that weighs pounds in about eight minutes That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute Hence the expression as greedy as a pig Well thank you for that Thats a great weight off me mind Now if you wouldnt mind telling me who the fuck you are apart from someone who feeds people to pigs of course Do you know what nemesis means righteous infliction of retribution manifested by an appropriate agent Personified in this case by a horrible cunt Me Gentlemen Why cant you find me Franky Doug Avi what do you want me to do m

its gonna be the same for us Ever cross the road and look the wrong way Give me that fucking shooter And hey presto theres a car nearly on you So what do you do Something very silly You freeze And your life doesnt flash before you because youre too scared to think You just freeze and pull a stupid face But the pikey didnt Why Because he had plans on running the car over It had previously occurred to me that hed taken the demise of his mother rather lightly For every action there is a reaction And a pikey reaction is quite a fucking thing Pete talk to me If you want your friend to hear you talk a lot louder than that Give me that fucking shooter ll give you your shooter you cunt That is when thought the pikey had money riding on himself Thats why the bastard never goes down when hes supposed to Weve been tucked up while hes been cleaning up Were worse off now than when we started The next day we went to the campsite but the gypsies had disappeared during the night Which was probably a good thing considering theyd just buried Where is he He aint fucking here thats for sure We cant ask a man to fight for us if we cant find him can we You wont find a pikey that doesnt want to be found He could be in a campsite in Kampufuckingchea by now Bollocks Come on What you doing here Whats it got to do with you So what you doing here m taking the dog for a walk Whats the problem Whats in the car Seats and a steering wheel What do you know about gypsies know theyre not to be trusted All right get your dog On your way Get the dog Tommy The dog All right boy Come on Come on
