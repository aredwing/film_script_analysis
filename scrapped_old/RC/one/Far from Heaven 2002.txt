Like this dont know how to pronounce it Mira Mir Mir dont know why but just adore it feeling it gives know that sounds terribly vague No no actually it confirms something ve always wondered about modern art abstract art What is that That perhaps its just picking up where religious art left off somehow trying to show you divinity The modern artist just pares it down to the basic elements of shape and color But when you look at that Mir you feel it just the same Why thats lovely Raymond o tell the truth ve always preferred the work of the Masters Rembrandt Michelangelo Would you excuse me a moment Oh certainly Cathleen Oh El honey everything looks just marvellous Cathy who on Earth is that man You have this whole place in a clamour For heaven sakes why Because of that ridiculous story Who is he Hes Raymond Deagan Otis Deagans son Your gardener He passed away and Raymonds taken over his business You certainly seem on familiar terms with him Oh familiar terms What does that mean He

nonsense when he snuck away from his desk to phone me today Good heavens He says the whole friggin towns talking Frank please Sybil will hear you sent her out Christ Cathleen do you even have the slightest idea about what this could mean Dont you realize the effect its gonna have on me and the reputation have spent the past eight years trying to build for you and the children and for the company Frank swear to you whatever Mona Lauder saw or thought she saw was entirely a figment of that womans hateful imagination Yes have spoken to Raymond Deagan on occasion He brought his little girl to Eleanors art show But But apparently even here in Hartford the idea of a white woman even speaking to a colored man Oh please Just save me the Negro rights You know what that woman is capable
