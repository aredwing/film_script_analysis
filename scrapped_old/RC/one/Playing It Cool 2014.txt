Did you know that when someone attractive enters your sightline your pupils dilate percent Or when someone falls in love their brain floods with dopamine You know what else causes that chemical reaction Narcotics Its crazy right But thats the fun shit m learning right now See ve been hired to write this romantic comedy screenplay and the problem is ve never actually you know been in love so its slowgoing Yeah intelligent To help rely on this writers trick When other people tell me their tales of romance try to imagine myself as the characters in the story You know the ones in love Its kind of a desperate attempt to feel something suppose Anything really Its a little narcissistic but it works think the closest ever came would be the summer of Kristin my babysitter We were deeply passionately madly in love for one glorious night Until my granddad came home early from poker God could she dance think since then all of my experiences involving love usually start out something like this You know always did think you were pretty cute You still got that boyfriend Yeah You guys in love Then they lead somewhere like this And then usually end up something like this How about some back story No its a RomCom No romance Its a favor for the producer because the studio hates the third act This is gonna be huge Okay They have Ashley Tisdale from High School Musical and Matthew Morrison from Glee Its gonna be huge can see the poster now man MorrAsh Thats not a thing just made it a thing Come on play along Work your magic on this one because the same producer has a huge action job coming up All right Set in Malaysia You know m dying to write action So do the RomCom and will get you the action job Its six weeks in Malaysia Malaysian women You ever bang a Malaysian chick before No Man this cigarette is like an elephants dick to them Theyre sweet and warm and genuine Theyre caring beautiful women that you can rip apart Yeah And Swayze says to her for the first time because hes never been able to say this before love you Molly ve always loved you And then Demi Moore says to him Ditto Remember thats what he said to her at the beginning of the movie Okay Its no Terminator but What m s wait what m sorry you think Terminator is more romantic than Ghost Yeah Okay youre messing with me Oh my God youre not messing with me Okay Terminator Okay Its the same guy who did Titanic Okay this is my heads gonna explode ll be back And thats not a reference to many people have said that in the history of time This is my buddy Scott Wed been friends since the day we met Excuse me You left your Hey You left your package Hey Hey wait up Shit Shit Dont hurt me m a writer m not gonna hurt you Why are you running Because you were chasing me Because you left your package On purpose Oh my God Who leaves packages on purpose You cant do that shit post you know Its my favorite novel Love in the Time of Cholera leave it random places for people to find Its Its my art Youre insane Yeah Whats your name m Scott All right Lets get your bag Holy shit All right whats up word So the guy character has multiple personalities He meets the girl character who has multiple personalities And one of his personalities falls in love with one of her personalities That sounds really good Its terrible Its full of clichs It has a gay best friend personality It has a bitch girlfriend personality It has a feisty Hispanic personality It has a black female detective personality Oh theres even an act three runningthroughanairport scene God love runningthroughtheairport scenes Okay we gotta top that Put them on a bridge How romantic is that You got two people on a bridge maybe theres like a whole crowd following them and cheering and like you know maybe one guys doing Yeah m not doing any of that But like a slow clap like m not doing any of that Scott Well then youre not really making a RomCom Look if m gonna do this just wanna write something that shows love how it really is you know Not funny not romantic Okay but that kind of sounds like a downer Let me explain Love starts out like this m sorry my palms get kind of sweaty dont care love you And then he threw up He tried to say it was food poisoning but havent been able to make love with the lights on since You are so beautiful m just lucky to have you But then quickly becomes more like this work with her What do you want me to do baby Quit my job No want you to keep eyehumping her all night Baby stop Dont touch me with your sticky disgusting reptile hands You give away your most personal information only to have your secrets come back to destroy you Stop being melodramatic Maybe if youd hit the gym once in a while you wouldnt need that sob story No wonder he threw up How do know this Well take my story for example Theres no stronger force than a mothers love love you She keeps you safe secure Its unconditional right And then without warning the bottom falls out And youre left to watch helplessly as your world comes crashing down Mom wheres the prize Moms not here son Thats what love does it leaves you with Granddad to go to Chile with Phillip and ruins a perfectly good cereal And thats the last time saw her Thats why every time someone has said love you love you love you love you love you My response has been just dont see myself ever feeling the same way about you And there you have me By the way thats my heart You know how some people wear their hearts on their sleeve Well kicked mine out a long time ago and now he just follows me around chain smoking Okay so like said its been my life But then met this girl Come on Scott Lets go man These people are obnoxious Well sorry there arent any perfect tens here but were staying until they auction off that couples Champagne bath dont care if theyre all fours but if have to hear one more four talk about her vegan pet my sperm are gonna start eating each other Shit Colorful Its a gift No please continue think made my point No dont think youre drunk enough mean were fours now but a couple drinks from now we might be sixes Point well taken cutting myself off think the rest of my night is going to involve online shopping and eating my feelings Online shopping would have taken you for a porn guy No m off porn It objectifies women Oh so thats a bad thing now No no m not against women being objectified per se guess m just sick of men not being objectified Oh m sick of women not being judged by how much money we make mean if spend an hour and change getting ready want to be ogled m pretty much begging for it Exactly and m tired of being wanted for my body but not my pocket book Were drinking wine here My money is no good Oh God this girls dangerous Do you want to do a social experiment Nice

Well d love to travel more but have crushing student debt God sorry m sorry Oh God look at this guy so stuffy Do the the blow job the tongueinthecheek thing No hes my boyfriend Hi honey Darling there you are have no idea what Stuffy said because went temporarily deaf Whered you go homey was looking for you You dont look too good Oh did you have the crab Yeah had the crab Its probably why was on the shitter for so long Okay that sucked Shake it off Time to randomly text some chicks Hey m so glad you called didnt found that love is like a leak in a boat It starts slow with a drip and if you dont plug it it gets worse until you drown And to fix it you should really find an expert want to tell him No Mr Policeman this is not a thumbsup moment But yeah it is We all have different patches for the leak and mine is sex Which is about to erase all the traces of that girl from the charity event right out of my brain Wait Stop Stop Stop m sorry What the hell Good question Question for you there was a girl here she had brown hair just a great great girl height Perfect smile red dress kind of a whole happy thing going on Ringing any bells No Sorry Shit Hey What the hell were you doing Listen Erin youre amazing but is there somewhere could drop you She would go on to say her name was Regan At least think it was Wow m not good with names Teresa she could be a Teresa Jenn with two s no never Mary too plain Shantiqua highly unlikely Chastity fuck hope not If theres one thing you should know about writers is that we dont suffer alone very well Its why we write Its why we form little groups This is mine in action Lyle single harmless deviant The proud writer of the first pages of screenplays and novels He needs a shower Samson married graphic novelist poems short stories kind of too old to be hanging out with us but we dont give a shit Mallory she writes and performs intensely personal onewoman shows she drags the rest of us to We fuck sometimes for research Scott you met him Why do you need to know her name guess kind of wanted to say her name out loud Oh stop its a passing infatuation thats allowed Gee wish some guy thought about saying my name out loud You mean like while hes playing with his dangly bits Yes Who says there are no more romantics No actually think the whole idea of love is kind of unrealistic and outdated Thats touching Well make sure that goes in your RomCom You know how kill infatuation With a gun When meet a hot girl ll just look for one flaw whether shes pigeontoed or knockkneed or just not very polite focus on that one flaw until m not attracted anymore You know Works perfectly How do you think dont cheat on my wife thought you did No wonder your marriage is so happy Dont talk to me about happiness okay Because thanks happiness and marriage dont coexist Bullshit Theres a reason that Romeo killed himself Suicide was the best option for this guy Why No Romeo set the standard for love No Shakespeare didnt know anything about love The guy was a sexual deviant He couldnt keep his hands off of himself Thats why his name was Shakespeare Its true Hardy Dickens Longfellow all sexstarved pen names Cummings Updike Margaret Atewood Dean Kuuntz Atwood and Koontz Balzac Yeah see your point Whiny teens killing themselves isnt love Love is what keeps fucking you long after the sex has dried up Stop You guys are terrible Love is a real thing was watching this Korean soap opera last night Stop watching that shit No no no you guys are hearing this It was an episode of When the Pear Tree Blossoms It Also Weeps So basically theres this girl Hana and this guy Da ejung And theyve been reunited after years of separation Theyre like crazy in love mean its all tea pouring and furtive glances but you can tell theyre like two seconds away from just ripping each others kimonos off and getting seriously freaky Oh God remember how told you how put myself in other peoples stories Well And why is she here But now theyre finally back together And she realizes she has to tell him her secret Shed been born a man So she had to get this operation to be what she always knew she was in her heart woman This is the part that literally blew my mind Instead of rejecting her he matches her confession He had biologically been a woman but had science give him what he always felt he should have you know dude parts And they just touch hands Thats love Fuck Love will always find a way Now thats Excuse me Oh sorry Scott could be right but then Scott will also say that theres someone for everyone And as much as you may think thats right you can always find that one person thats so unusual to the natural order of things you think that cant be true But then youre wrong again Then everywhere you look its like googling awkward engagement photos And you realize youre wrong a third time Youre that one person youre the exception Theres someone for everyone everyone except you Is something on your mind Oh its nothing Its Whenever you say its nothing it is never nothing Can we talk about something else Well yeah sure m gonna have another prostate exam tomorrow morning Jesus Would you rather talk about that No Its a girl Its nothing If youre thinking about her but you cant figure out how to talk about her it is not nothing met her at some random fundraiser have no idea how to find her so nothing Boy didnt know

come and do some research with me All right get your head in the game Got your tie on feeling smart looking good Lets find this girl Charities are ridiculous They like to fatten you up with their luncheons and hors doeuvres and their dinners and drinks and then they want to sweat it back out of you with their Ks Oh hey there see you at a lot of these Youre a very caring person We need more

drift out to sea until the end And it makes you realize there are people in your life so important that they dwarf everything else And its up to you to figure out who they are If you had to give up everything else and spend the rest of your days on a boat who are the musthaves The ones you cant live without Figure out your own list and then do everything you can to let them know how much they mean to you hope its not too late for me Okay first things first Splitpersonality RomCom lets do it Just because wear a badge doesnt mean cant feel Its too late hes Heismaned you into the friend zone

hate you love you too really hate you hate you Everybody has their own ideas about love They have their philosophies and facts and rules of how it works and what youre supposed to do but none of that shit matters because love isnt a thinking thing its a feeling thing and this is what it felt like for me Live your own story and dont worry promise wont put myself in it Pour some honey on the world

Oh my mind You know love to see you smile Each and every time It blows my mind Hearts and rainbows in the sky For you and Oh my mind You know love to see you smile woman Each and every time woman It blows my mind
