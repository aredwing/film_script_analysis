At am On Friday May Hitler invaded Holland So began a weekend destined to become one of the most momentous in history The following day Saturday May Winston Churchill became Prime Minister a mission was mounted with such speed and secrecy that no written word of it ever appeared in the official files of the War Cabinet The purpose of the mission to get all the industrial diamonds out of Amsterdam before the Germans took over the city In a room above a shop in one of Londons back streets two of the three men chosen for such a dangerous task met for their final briefing One was Walter Keyser a Dutch diamond expert a quiet man whod lived in England for years The other Maj Dillon an experienced intelligence officer who was to be in charge of the party But the key man on Operation Amsterdam was Jan Smit a friend of Walter Keyser and another diamond expert who knew practically every Dutch merchant in Amsterdam He was also a man in love with life Jan Smit knew that the value of the stocks held in Amsterdam was between and million pounds He also knew there was no figure big enough to describe their worth to the German war effort For without industrial diamonds to cut and bore tanks and airplanes could not be built Sorry m late sir You know Councilor De Mattos of the Netherlands Legation Of course Maj Dillon here will be in charge of the party How do you do Have you heard from your father Nothing from Holland All we know is German agents give great prices for industrial diamonds The time is short gentlemen so ll get straight to the point Operation Amsterdam has been given the highest possible priority The government considers it so important theyre placing a destroyer at your disposal It will take you to ljmuiden Thats the nearest port to Amsterdam Magnetic mines have been sown at all the harbor entrances and German parachutists are established around three sides of The Hague number of them have been killed already in Amsterdam Many were wearing Dutch uniforms Fifth columnists are everywhere It can no longer be assumed that a Dutch uniform contains a loyal Dutch soldier One final thing gentlemen We know the German troops have been ordered to cut off Amsterdam by tomorrow Incidentally if youre caught we cannot help you Dillon Your job is to get the Amsterdam stocks My job is to bring you and the diamonds back safely And want no dead heroes on this trip Gentlemen these documents state that your journey is at the request of the British Government and has the full approval of the Netherlands Legation here in London May for the benefit of both our peoples wish you Godspeed and success to your mission Going on holiday Major ve got another little job to do But dont worry it wont interfere with our plans Shall take the cases No thanks can manage

a miracle Gentlemen have something of importance to tell you My son and Mijnheer Keyser came over this morning with Maj Dillon Theyre here at the request of Mr Churchill and the Netherlands Legation in London They want to prevent our diamonds particularly our industrial stocks from falling into enemy hands Are you suggesting we send our diamond stocks to England for safekeeping Yes gentlemen You must decide whether to send them to England with my son or overland to Paris or Switzerland The other alternative is to keep them here for the Germans How do we know the Germans will take the city Amsterdam will fall within a few hours Tonight at the latest How do you propose returning to England Have you a plane Mr Churchill has given them a destroyer That is the value he places on our diamonds This is a very grave issue gentlemen suggest we call all the board for a meeting at noon neednt stress the urgency We are agreed to call a board meeting Good That Lieutenant has a disturbing habit of disappearing Do you think Annas a traitor What do you think Shes a Dutch girl in love with a Jewish soldier girl whod rather commit suicide than face the hurt in her fiancs eyes Its hardly the role of a collaborator suppose she was going to commit suicide Walter Keyser Jan Smit Maj Dillon Its not difficult to guess what theyre after Youve done well Thank you Colonel want you to get back Keep in touch with me and dont worry about the Lieutenant ll try and make some arrangements in the Smit area We must afford our guests every hospitality ll have the outposts warned at ljmuiden ready for tonight Whats the number of your car Take great care Trust no one And dont do anything silly like shooting yourself Is there any news of Josephs unit It was overrun last night And Joseph Casualty lists have stopped coming through Josephs a brave man Hell be all right Youll see Sometimes people can be too brave Colonel Good luck Gentlemen this is an emergency meeting Mijnheer Smit Youve all had time to speak with the Major Walter and my son You know why theyre here and why you are here Do you realize what youre asking us to do Johan Only too well What will you do with your stock shall send every stone possess to England If we give our diamonds to your son and his friends to take to London how will they be covered What about insurance have not insured my son Even in a destroyer it would be a great risk Surely it is safer overland to Paris Holland may fall But it is inconceivable that the French army will be beaten Gentlemen the noise you can hear is the German army There is no safe overland route to Paris The only road out of Amsterdam leads to the sea and it may be cut at any moment What do you think Walter Its a question of faith and courage ll call this afternoon and hand over my entire stocks Unfortunately many members have their stocks in the vaults Today is Whitmonday The vaults will be under time lock until tomorrow Then blow them out Isaac Johan my friend in the eyes of the Nazis many of us here have already committed one crime that of being a Jew Life under the occupation will be bad enough But if they discover that we have sent all our diamonds to England we can expect no mercy If we give you our diamonds we may be giving you our lives You must decide for yourselves Those who wish to follow Spiers example will find me in my office this afternoon You cant blame them Father for feeling as they do dont blame them More people about More troops you mean There she is back Major Where have you been thought you deserted me No shopping Come inside Anna ll stay in the car If you dont get out ll shoot you ll take that Why did you go away Anna Come on were wasting time This wasnt in your bag this morning Where did you get it While you were being so sorry

Major what he wants to know dont like being threatened But youre the one who told us not to trust anyone Do you think would help those who killed Joseph When did this happen Last night His unit was overrun He may still be alive Probably a prisoner Who gave you the information went to see Col Jansen at the War Ministry told you work there went there to try to get help for you Does he know why were here He can guess Did he give you this Yes What about the soldiers in the street told him about the Lieutenant so they were sent in case of trouble The Colonel also promised to warn the outposts

Leave the outer door open See that she gets safely home Wed better wait outside for Anna We dont want to miss her They say a lot of the German parachutists are mere boys When captured they cry for their mothers In Waalhaven they dropped some disguised as nuns This morning saw some police beating up two nuns The only trouble was they were real nuns Thats all right Lock it Sorry Alms please gentlemen Dont forget the pierement Keep to the rear of the organ Stop Come back Drive on anywhere Whats funny My father asked me to look after you The Major was right about the reception committee Theyre early Shopping bags still empty The Lieutenant wouldnt know that He may try again think its a good idea if we keep away from the office for a while Walter how would you like to pay a visit to your mother Come right through please Are you alone Yes see you have already had visitors Just one Spier The others are mine would like to add mine to those but must make up my mind Its not easy you

frightened but only for my wife They separate you you know What are you trying to say my friend ll give you all my diamonds All ask in exchange is that the British destroyer takes Miriam to England

know what to say Youve risked your lives by coming here today You risked them again by the decision you made But its the right one Miriam thinks these diamonds ought to go to England ll give you all receipts before you leave No receipts please It would incriminate everybody As you see very few of us came The others have their stocks under time lock in the vaults There was no point in their coming Instead they sent a message They too would like their stocks to go to England Goodbye gentlemen Goodbye This is better Thank you sir Jan from now on the head office of the family firm will be in London You will be in charge suppose theres no point in asking you to leave Amsterdam m part of Holland Major patrol has been changed The flashes are different Can you check Amsterdam please Col
