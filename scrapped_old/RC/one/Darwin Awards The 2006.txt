The peaceful moment It doesnt really exist By the time finish this sentence about seven people around the world will make a huge mistake They call them the Darwin Awards In the late s they started giving out an award each year for the person who died in the most idiotic way The idea being these peoples actions are so moronic theyre actually improving the gene pool by removing themselves from it For instance Trip Hansen an ad executive was showing off his new penthouse office Oh man Instant fuck pad You lucky bastard That glass Fourply Bulletproof Bullshit All right What are you doing Walkin the talk No no no no He runs at the window You know to prove it was shatterproof Holy shit Turns out it wasnt Everybodys gotta have a hobby For me it was the Darwin Awards There we are Okay guess you

provided a job We got plenty of Polaroids These are digital m takin a extra set You know for Burrows If that little shit wants to help out with this investigation let him get his ass down here just like everybody else He did Hes outside So what made you choose me for this project anyway You were the only one on the force who agreed to do it Oh Five dead in four weeks It seemed like a serial case and no one could solve it That meant it fell in my lap Hi Bill Okay Give me perps under six feet with size shoes Check the clothing records at Quentin and Folsom here Working overtime Just ignore the camera Its not all doughnuts and broads Oh please Dont encourage him Nobody under six feets gonna have size Whoa Look at this At least people do Those footprints were half as deep as the others Guy

Whats that You cant follow me What did you say this was for Student film Its also a helpful research tool Mr Burrows First Fidelity Life and Casualty already has the most complete profiles in the business Yeah youve got risk profiles for heart disease cancer even drunk driving But nothing for these Darwin Award types But you have no experience in insurance profiles was the best on the force at personality profiles Predicting peoples behavior Yeah but we already have a full staff of actuaries can tell you what kind of underwear youre wearing Excuse me Bikinicut briefs Color Probably red No make that black How do you If that were the case how would you You have pictures of your wife on your desk but not of children Bikinicut briefs drastically reduce a mans fertility Being in the insurance industry my guess is youre aware of this and your fertility restriction is by design Probably cause youre having an affair Given your age andjob status theres a But the two gifts in your office make it a certainty One from Gumps obviously for your wife probably bought out of guilt The other from Sugarpuss on Haight Street which lets just say is not where one shops for their wife According to psychological studies black is the color chosen by men in midlife crisis trying to rebel but who in fact are simply terrified of death Damn Could you turn the camera off please You got it Why Why should First Fidelity care about these Darwin cases The cases describe in my report cost your company million per annum Thats last year alone Jesus You said theres no profile Right Well we create one You can predict a persons fate based on three traits For instance if you weigh over pounds use bar soap rather than liquid and dont have a nonskid surface in your shower you have a chance of Thats worldwide Sad thing is of these accidents are preventable Just requires a little precaution Get someone to study these Darwin Award types find three common risk factors you got your profile Screen against this profile youll save million per annum Okay Okay You begin immediately and um you start with with those These cases are all over the country See dont travel ve never been out of San Francisco Well thats a dealbreaker You have four weeks to prove your theory If youre right you have a job If not Four weeks isnt nearly enough time m gonna pair you with a claims investigator And she

the trees You fell Fine yeah fell Falling Something you wouldnt have thought to do because youre too chickenshit to go out on the ice in the first place Laughing is not objective Before these Darwin cases werejust a puzzle to solve Now was connecting them to names and faces wasnt satisfiedjust studying these accidents anymore wanted to find a way to prevent them Sorry Nurse Can you speed up a little bit Twolane highways with broken lines are the most dangerous roads Seventy percent of accidents occur over the speed limit Youre going in a Most studies have a plus or minus error m correcting

to think something leaving a mile skid mark was going inexplicably fast Listen we searched a hundredyard radius on both sides of the skids and found nothing No mean really fast Theres metal in the skid marks melted to the pavement From what Melted wheels When a man oflimited means has a milliondollar life insurance policy it raises questions Foul play by the beneficiary must always be considered Suicide if proven is cause for cancellation You like her dont you Thats a bullshit question Now why is it a bullshit question You see your whole film school objective observer theory is bullshit Youre trying to get me to say certain things to create some kind of story Hey its all real footage man No Its the minutes of footage youre gonna choose from hundreds of hours of tape Then youre gonna edit it to make someone look like the bad guy or someone look like the hero The only problem is there are no heroes here Ow Harvey Will you cut that racket out In many ways Harvey was a model factor candidate He had the classic secondchild personalities Stan do you ever get the feeling theres a whole other world out there What Like Europe On the surface a second child is a responsible citizen Premium right No Midgrades fine Thanks This has got fuel injection You want it to run clean Just midgrade But boiling just below the exterior of the second child is a competitive

trouble Were gonna be on Okay Harvey youre not gonna get yourself hurt right Nah dont worry m not gonna let anything happen Harvey Am good or am bad Youre just a little bit bad But whats wrong with that The rocket is designed to add thrust Careful to overloaded transport planes like s which fully loaded weigh in excess of tons Harveys Chevy weighed less than two Harvey accelerated to miles per hour before he began the ignition sequence The first two switches mixed the fluids Once mixed they become one of the most potent rocket fuels on earth unleashing a force beyond the imagination of Harvey Wedstone Okay Harvey should be here in about five minutes m not sure if this is gonna work By the time Harvey hit the brakes the car was already going miles per hour Then the peak burn hit Oh my God Harvey managed to pull the parking brake This would have been of no use because at miles per hour the tires melted Tellis Pearlman saw his fate coming from the east at miles per hour Forces usually reserved for wind tunnel tests were now ripping the car apart The more learn about this man the more feel a strange admiration Harvey made a brave decision With three seconds ofburn left Harvey veered out of the Pearlmansway hitting the sloped shoulder The trajectory sent Harvey to an apex of feet did it fucking did something What happened Nothing fell asleep at the wheel Kids kids Quiet Your fathers lost his mind again Two days later Pearlman reported to the air force a that came and went in the blink of an eye Mama Stan reverting to his criminal instincts ran Mama Okay well um it was coming toward It was like a flashlight and there was an explosion It was going about miles an hour miles an hour At least miles Very fast Mr Pearlman could it have been your imagination He has no imagination Hes completely insane He ordered cases of paper towels Had them shipped to the house And you dont have a history of narcotics It happened was driving with my family in the car had my children in the back and it happened One more second and we would have just been in an accident Siri he saved the Pearlmanslives Hes actually kind of a hero What Listen Two years ago in Louisiana a single mother and her three kids lost their house in a flood had to look her in the eyes and deny that claim am sure as hell not gonna give a million dollars to some idiot who strapped a rocket to the back of his Chevy Look at the trajectory He was home free The rocket was burned out then he swerved The claim is rejected What Man you are losing it Weve got like minutes Come on Jesus Dont you have

purposes What the hell are you doing Research Ah Well good to see youre holdin up Neither of them is a second child So So that was the one solid trait had linking the cases Look with the amount of money youre saving Simmons and the company believe me youre gonna get the job new job doesnt matter anymore If m gonna find a way to prevent these deaths have to know why they do it ll tell you why Do you know that companies intentionally build in mistakes to monthly bills hoping you wont notice just so they can save a few pennies And insurance firms like the one work for we have a policy of rejecting every claim right off the bat And if you call to dispute that claim you get put on hold And then you get sent through an endless maze of voice mail menus until you just give up All these minor insults they build up over the years Finally people just People just lose their shit And you feel powerless and faceless and and you end up strapping a rocket to the back of your Chevy Lets get
