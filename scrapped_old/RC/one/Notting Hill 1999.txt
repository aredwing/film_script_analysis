So stay with us because later this afternoon were lucky enough to be talking to Anna Scott Hollywoods biggest star by far Miss Scotts latest film is once again topping the charts She may be the face cant forget trace of pleasure or regret May be my treasure or the price have to pay She may be the mirror Of my dream smile reflected in a stream She may not be what she may seem inside her shell She who always seems so happy in a crowd Whose eyes can be so private and so proud No ones allowed to see them when they cry She may be the love that cannot hope to last May come to me from shadows of the past That ll remember till the day die She may be the reason survive The why and wherefore m alive The one ll care for through the rough And ready years Me ll take her laughter and her tears And make them all my souvenirs For where she goes ve got to be The meaning of my life is She She Oh she Of course ve seen her films Of course ve seen her films and always thought she was well fabulous But you know a million million miles from the world live in which is here Notting Hill my favorite bit of London Theres the market on weekdays selling every fruit and vegetable known to man Rock hard bananas five for a pound The tattoo parlor with a guy outside who got drunk and now cant remember why he chose love Ken The radical hairdressers where everyone comes out looking like the Cookie Monster whether they want to or not And then suddenly its the weekend and from break of day hundreds of stalls appear out of nowhere filling Portobello Road right up to Notting Hill Gate And wherever you look thousands of people are buying millions of antiques some genuine and some not quite so genuine And whats great is that lots of friends have ended up in this part of London Thats Tony for example architect turned chef who recently invested all the money he ever earned in a new restaurant And so this is where spend my days and years in this small village in the middle of the city in a house with a blue door that my wife and bought together before she left me for a man who looked exactly like Harrison Ford And where lead a strange halflife with a lodger called Spike You couldnt help me
