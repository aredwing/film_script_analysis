Sharkboy was not always half shark half boy He was a marine biologist or at least in training His father studied great white sharks and called his son Sharkboy because of how much he loved to care for the sharks He made them sushi and had given them all names Goodmilk Peggy Eggbat and Crackett But one day an incredible mysterious storm appeared It swept away the entire laboratory Sharkboy Thanks to their life rafts Sharkboy and his father survived But they survived on different sides of the wreckage each floating off in a different direction Sharkboy Sharkboy was completely alone Almost completely But one of the sharks recognized him Hey its Sharkboy Dont take a bite outta him boys hes a friend They took Sharkboy to their cave home where hed be safe and dry His new family were sharks Hundreds of sharks The sharks raised him as one of their own training him in the ways of the shark You must keep moving to survive Always go forward never back To live by instinct and instinct alone Eventually he grew gills and sharp talons for claws His teeth sharpened themselves to a point He grew fins all sorts of fins But that was years ago first met Sharkboy while fishing on the dock this summer He seemed lost You have to get a job No have a job So snuck him home Then maybe you should just leave when my parents were too busy to notice kept him fed and in water He had been traveling the universe in search of his father He told me of his latest adventures on a planet so cool it makes you drool He said too could go to Planet Drool someday Then one night was visited by a glowing light An amazing girl with purple flames for hair and skin of molten lava rock appeared called her Lavagirl She smiled at me for that seemed to be her name She told me she needed Sharkboy to return to Planet Drool with her for a great crisis was developing She asked if could go with them told her have school tomorrow She gave me a sad look and flamed away taking Sharkboy with her havent seen Sharkboy or Lavagirl since then And thats what did this summer Enough Someone is picking that up And its not gonna be me We were supposed to tell true stories That is a true story Does Lavagirl have special powers Theres no such thing as Lavagirl She can She can shoot lava out of her hands Cool How many people think Maxs story is true Not true Made up Not true Its just a madeup story If its true
