have been in the same room as him and everything Many times Arent you the girl who just moved into the Swenska house Well m Lola Steppe didnt know our home had a name Is that supposed to be that famous New York sense of humor New Yorkers learn to laugh at themselves and everything else when theyre very young My parents took me to New York for my birthday thought it was beautiful The lights and everything know why they call it the greatest city in the world Ella Gerard you are the sister of my soul You should see Park Avenue at Christmas Its like walking through the Milky Way Except nobody gets mugged in the Milky Way Well take our seats now Miss Baggoli Yes We have a new girl from New York City We do Miss Steppe Miss Steppe Miss Baggoli know it must show on your records that my name is Mary but everyone has referred to me as Lola since was a squealing infant in my mothers arms dont even know who this Mary is like that name Lola Lola This is Lola Lola you should know that youre sitting in my favorite seat in history class like to be dead center Me too and didnt think we had anything in common ve earned the center seat Besides if you want to fit in you probably shouldnt draw attention to yourself In case you havent noticed like the attention Chill Also wouldnt hang out with Ella Never Had a Fella She doesnt really have your potential now does she Look at her She dresses like a politicians wife with the hair and the shoes Shes so random And what about those glasses They are so minutes ago But m gonna stop myself before get nasty want to let you know that if youre careful you could be chilling with us Chilling with you is what ve always dreamed of Hey Ella wait up Do you mind if sit with you Oh no thats fine This is great When you eat outside in New York your food gets dirty So whats with the Great Santini Shes beautiful Shes popular Shes rich In kindergarten she used to bite the heads off dolls Ew Whos that guy smiling at us Thats Sam Sam Sam Lola Lola Sam Hi Hey Its your first day here right Yeah Well its good to meet you You too ll see you later couldnt possibly have a boyfriend mean have to focus on my acting career After three weeks m getting used to the rich part of town Gated dull Armaniridden You know m the kind of riffraff they try to keep out When Stu Wolff sings Theres something in me that always wants more More moons and stars and music in the wind its as though hes just talking to me like Steve bet Stu is hard to get along with You can tell hes sort of moody Haunted All true geniuses are haunted Its part of what they have to suffer for their art Popovers ladies Wow This is just like eating in a diner Thank you Well surely you have popovers at home just popped them in the microwave My mother doesnt approve of microwaves She has very strong opinions ve never heard of anyone taking a stance on an appliance before Why doesnt your mother like me She likes you She just thinks youre a little strange mean you are a little Lola Lola m sorry Its really your mother she thinks is strange My mom saw your mother in the supermarket wearing dirty overalls with chopsticks in her hair and arguing with the butcher Its not important Not important Shes the woman who gave me life Whose milk fed my fragile body Whose blood flows through my veins Of course its important My parents are square Neither of them is too happy about the fact that your mother has three children and no husband Single motherhood is a transitory state Karen used to be married It could happen again But thought you said you were a love child Well was a love child Mom and Dad were married and passionately in love My parents were mad for each other as soon as their eyes met Dad was like a rock star Mom was a babe The rest was destiny They got married And then they camped in the desert and counted the stars One million and three One million and four Jeez My parents went on a cruise to Bermuda but they were afraid to get off the boat Mine were in love Deeply movingly The only thing that could have made their lives better was having me Even as an infant aspired to have a relationship just like theirs And then the twins were conceived and we couldnt have been more thrilled Upon hearing the news my father mounted his really cool motorcycle to buy the mother of his child and future children her favorite flowers Suddenly Aah They found him strewn across th Avenue And th Lola m so sorry had no idea Ironic isnt it Your parents think my mother is the destroyer of our social order Shes merely a victim of fate What Nothing like the chopsticks in your hair Because Carla Santini thinks shes Julia Roberts and the universe is interested in everything she says you cant help overhearing her So had this really long talk with Miss Baggoli yesterday about the drama clubs production of Pygmalion told her think its really rigid to stick to the original Not stick to the original Not stick to the exquisite words of Mr George Bernard Shaw Were not English and this isnt the th century so think we should adapt the classics to reflect our times Theyre classics because theyre classic Then told her about my idea to move the location to presentday New York and make Eliza a checkout girl Youre gonna be playing Eliza Well of course ve already got the part When moved to Deadwood really felt that a legend was about to be born Was Carla Santini going to stand in the way of that birth Miss Baggoli Miss Baggoli didnt know Pygmalion had already been cast would have loved to be Eliza Doolittle Maybe if could just prove it to you now Oh no no Lola just put the notice up on the board Auditions are not until Friday Thank you Miss Baggoli George Bernard Shaw is a great playwright And hes also a vegetarian Youre just in time Lola Quickly m telling all the others about this idea that have had for our production of Pygmalion Now as you know Pygmalion is a play which takes place in oldtimey London My idea is that we will set our production of Pygmalion in modernday New York And Eliza will be a checkout girl at a supermarket And Professor Higgins will be a professor at That is such a brilliant idea Thats gonna give the play new resonance and immediacy for today You mean it was your idea Yes Lola its my idea know m just a teacher but am capable of thought Now since were going hip and modern have also added contemporary songs And am calling it Eliza Rocks Now each of you will be singing a song for me of your choice and then youll be reading a scene for me But havent rehearsed a song or anything m simply not prepared Thats fine You can just wing it But acting is my chosen career mean intend to be in theater dont want anyone remembering a substandard audition Then how are we to proceed guess ll try of course Perhaps you could try now You could go first Okay Take a spot on the stage Anywhere youre comfortable Maybe if were lucky shell fall d like to sing a song by my favorite band Sidarthur Selfdoubt didnt kick in until the morning when woke up with a heart as cold and heavy as Mt Everest It was the day the cast list went up Why had been so certain was going to get the lead Miss Baggoli didnt say anything encouraging Carla smiled Well look what the wind blew in Look what the cat dragged in Ladies After you Right After me Unh Ow Well once again got the part that wanted Oh Oh There are no small parts only small actors You can quote me m your new Eliza Aah Amazing didnt think d get it but did didnt think that because knew youd get it No cause was Actually my part the one of Mrs Higgins is much more interesting than Elizas in many ways mean even though shes not the female lead its a part with depth and true contemporary resonance Its the one that wanted Good cause thats the one you got ll show you what its like to be in my school Is that a threat Absolutely To Eliza Rocks To Eliza Rocks Oh man Congratulations This is the best day cant imagine that Carla got beat out Hey Sidarthur fans how about some big news You heard it here first The band is breaking up What Yep Sidarthur is no more repeat no more Stu Wolff is moving on and saying Never never will work with them again So in memory of the band Iets hear a track from Always Morning No It cant be It just cant be Aah Aah Aah What Whats the matter cant breathe Mom cant breathe heard Thanks for being here at a time like this dont want to believe it made these flyers to hand out to fans urging them to protest As these balloons go to the heavens so do the stars of our Sidarthur mix among the stars of our universe Symbolically of course Can you believe this One of the most catastrophic events in the history of the universe has occurred and everyones acting as if nothing has happened Great Me again of course So whos next Me Are you crazy Carlas the alltime champion So Theres gonna be a new alltime champion think youve peaked Hop on Round one My father who as you know is the lawyer for Sidarthur just called me to tell me what he found out about the band Oh really What he told me isnt available to the public yet Sidarthurs having a farewell concert in New York next month Daddy already has seats but thats not the best part didnt think it would be Theres gonna be a party afterwards at Stus loft for all of Sidarthurs closest friends So ve heard And guess who already has an invitation It just so happens that Ella and do Oh really Yeah really Howd you manage that Same way you did Through parental connections What connections do you have other than the phone Winner Me again Loser Games not over yet Round two Actually my mother has the connections Marsh Warner bought a piece from her last summer And Marshie as call him is their manager know who he is He remembered was crazy about Sidarthur so he got us invited Wow your mom must be some potter Winner Me Lola Steppe Remember that name Loser Awesome Why did you tell Carla that we were invited to his party You would have done the exact same thing if you were me wouldnt have lied would have thought before spoke cant even imagine being you Carla Santini drives me insane Dont even say that Two of her nannies were institutionalized Not to worry You just handed her exactly what she needs to ridicule you and humiliate you for the rest of your life and me too guess it depends doesnt it Depends on what Well on whether we go To the concert In New York And the party We havent exactly been invited You dont have to be invited to a party like that There are people in New York that dont go out unless its to crash a celebrity bash My mother would never let me go We can work around your mother Ella Tell the truth Are you partially insane You know we have to go Its a matter of pride Is there something wrong with the salmon No just not very hungry In too much pain m in pain too My tooths coming out Oh Its not that kind of pain Its pain of the heart Sidarthurs broken up Theyre having one last concert in New York Thats it Theyre done Good night sweet princes May choirs of rock angels sing you to sleep have no reason to live without them Let me take a wild guess You want to go to the concert If could just see them play live d have the memory to carry me through the long empty years that lie ahead like a road in Kansas Okay dont think that kids and rock concerts are a great mix How can you treat me like this was your firstborn You leaned over my crib to make sure was breathing Thats why want to keep you alive She wouldnt even stop for the tiniest most subatomic second to consider my fragile hopes and dreams What did Ellas mother say She didnt ask her She said her mom would bite off a acrylic nail if she even brought it up So guess thats that No m not exactly a que ser ser kind of person Right like your necklace Thanks
