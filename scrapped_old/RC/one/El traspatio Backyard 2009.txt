surreal sky we live under surreal circumstances case in point remember that serial killer the one whose capture our valiant Governor pinned on his chest like a medal Well you may recall that after he went behind bars the bodies of another eight women appeared within days and since then every week another body like goddamn clockwork But incredibly enough this alleged serial killer is still in jail

didnt answer He wanted to ask you a favor What was it didnt talk to him dont know The Sultan that well hired him then fired him for the same reason you think hes the killer Which is Which is that hes sick with hatred He hit a secretary picture that can picture him doing something as awful as biting off a teenagers nipple before killing her You two met in jail in El Paso In the sex offenders area Thats official If its official dont see what your question is Are you familiar with the word rehabilitate Some say there are jails where prisoners are rehabilitated and jails where theyre punished say

around in circles When is this raid going to happen Jurez doesnt have the officers and victims arent a priority so its never going to happen Theres a story read town in India holds a ceremony once every full moon Until one night a tiger shows up and eats someone They flee in terror month later they gather again scared this time Same story the tiger jumps out devours someone and escapes The next month the town gathers again but this time theyre not scared because now the tiger is part of the ceremony He forms part of the ritual Easy for the world to say how can this be Just like these murders

so no one sees you Sir Well done Chief Now get this After this display the Governor wants results From you personally From me personally ll make sure we get convictions In every interrogation really appreciate this Sir Dead men triple raped women and theres no police raids Besides what city doesnt have both dead men and women Problem is that new cop is more interested in dead women than men Reverse sexism dude But the dead men are always armed Theyre mostly dealers right And they get shot in the crossfire But not the dead women They take them so they can screw them And they bite them or cut off a breast some skin between their legs If they were armed at least theyd have a chance We gotta give these goddamn broads guns Keep talking Oaxaca You know a man by how he treats women and children Oh Oaxaca Thats why she done you wrong Youre a loser Ma Gimme more salsa Estela give Ma a hand Move Look at her Move it mon its gonna get cold Take a hit Oaxaca m gonna explain this real slow That woman disgraced you And in public to boot You gave her everything You gave it your all and the ungrateful bitch stabbed you in the back So now you got two choices Like seeing yourself double in these shades You see yourself double Or you forgive her and keep moaning or you dont forgive shit and quit being such a fag Street lamps all over the city Public transportation where workers live a bigger and better police force m getting to that With publicity from big business and the government you can launch a program making Ciudad Jurez a model city Like the Marshall Plan the created in Germany and Japan after World War Were not your enemies like Germany and Japan back then Were your neighbors But its no good for you to have poor neighbors because that means trouble It makes us a bad market You gave us bucks per body Just like we agreed Sultan That was the price per woman joked about sales tax We had to bring you underwear and a news clipping for each body You paid us dollars Thats why the brand names are moving their factories to China or India Unless We offer highly trained labor here Or less expensive Not more dont know that fucker We have records of the Cheros visiting you in jail Theyre bringing them in now We want to eradicate this kind of situation We want some answers Here comes Captain Blanca What can you tell us about this situation Nothing right now thanks No comment thank you Youre famous now right dont have press clearance Lets talk off the record What do you want To offer you rebuttal Because what m saying is it doesnt fit What doesnt fit The results of your investigation The Cheros didnt kill the last women They confessed you heard them They confessed The Sultan hired them months ago to kill women So how come three victims were missing over a year It doesnt fit Did you interrogate them Were you even there ll say on the air the cops told them what to confess and the evidence was tainted by their use of brute force And in the middle of this cesspool youre a peculiar figure Do me a favor leave me out of it cop who has used illegal methods in pursuit of a legitimate goal ending the murders of women in Jurez cop moved by holy rebellion because holy rebellions do exist but within an impossible context of corruption and inefficiency only someone in power could change Lets say the Governor Nice man good Catholic but totally incapable of making his Christian will be done in the real world Turn it off You all know him a man whos deeply Hey Just a minute This is my cooling system Fantastic You never smile Not when you take me to see something awful the same day get fired Is that the Governors plan So they say My goodness Hallelujah praise be to God This very day our Lord Governor arrives in Jurez to and quote establish order and keep the peace which means chopping off Captain Blanca Bravos head for the sin of meddling with our very well organized crime Take notice as he descends from that powerful silver Pullman bus Hit me Right in the face Mrgara mon Go for the face or balls dont waste time See why its got to be the face or balls from the start Because if not ve already immobilized you just like that Thanks Mrgara Juana your turn approach What do you say Stop right there But Right there not another step But come closer Dont go how come you told him youd go Oh Mrgara poor Cutberto really liked him feel bad hes not over me yet Every night theres a full moon the wind carries the screams And if there isnt a full moon Well its quiet and abandoned like Its next to the border fence Tell me where to go Yes ll just make nice and catch up with you at home Rent some videos You got it If youre in trouble you call me Hey hot Mama call me instead m your man princess Ooo m scared Take it easy Juana One oclock on the dot you hear Dont worry cuz Not just pretty bilingual too But where the hell did go wrong Nowhere want to meet more people Theres another name for that If youre going to disrespect me m leaving Wait Since when do you smoke Since you broke my heart Juana Can tell you something Cut Youre making me sleepy Whats it gonna be Juana You gonna dance with me too Or like the song says with everyone else but me Careful Cut You cant touch me unless say so Stay away from me Stay back not one step closer Lets go Whats inside Whats inside big freezer Down in the basement What do you mean a freezer Like from a slaughterhouse Anything in it No Empty An empty freezer in the middle of the desert Goodbye princess mon go for it Did get you in trouble Blanca Thats your job right Judging what others do what they dont do what they should do how they should do it Sitting next to a microphone having an opinion Yes thats my job criticizing next to an open mike Is the Governor in town yet You think hes firing me heard you yesterday Thats right Maybe instead of talking to me hell just give the Chief orders that affect me Anyway given the situation want you to know a few things so you can have an opinion later on m listening The Sultan and the Cheros Its true The evidence is flimsy They may or may not have murdered women And there are several others Several These deaths wont stop because a serial killer is still on the loose murderer with a fixed method Maybe and this is just a hypothesis he captures his victims every full moon and stores them in a basement in an industrial freezer Then after a few months he throws them into the desert So what is he Narcosatanic Who knows someone connected to the Cheros put bodies in that vacant lot the ones that didnt fit Why give the Cheros bodies To get rid of them and to confuse things or as a favor between accomplices And there are other killers Snuff pornographers Could be Organ traffickers Could be too Wannabes killing for sport Yes it could be any of those theories or all of them at once Then theres domestic violence husband kills his wife because she didnt cook dinner or an uncle rapes his niece and makes sure she wont talk So what are the facts Blanca Murder a woman in Jurez throw her into the desert and you have a license to kill Itll be buried on a crime sheet because the cops wont investigate Not thoroughly anyway No one will be charged with anything that sticks and no judge will ever hand down a sentence Explain the circumstances to the Governor mere Give me five ten minutes Hang on You can come in You made an arrest with no evidence Thats right And you kept him in jail Thats right You used torture to get false confessions No Sir No torture was used you say wouldnt know The Chief wouldnt You plea bargained with these Cheros to frame this Sultan Sentencing for murder You coerced a woman to abort informed her Unsolicited information You offered her shelter and a job if she had an abortion You forced her to kill her own child Thats a serious accusation one that merits time in prison Let me explain What the hell is going on out there You know what gets my goat Youre proud of what you did Doing nothing is worse These are yearold women Ramrez go see what the fuck is going on out there Now hear this you broke the law and there is no justification Let me explain Shut up Youre going to lose your job your badge and your freedom That Peralta is on the radio inciting people to protest by honking To protest Protest what He says youre putting this woman behind bars How many people would you say hundred Three hundred How many people are peacefully at home this Saturday watching Any idea Chief Most people The ones who matter trust well do what it takes to keep the peace The others the ones who like the streets Iet them go on making noise and killing each other Well have her badge But watch the timing do it after m back in Chihuahua Yes Sir Keep downtown clear for me tonight Yes Sir And find the connection between Captain Bravo and this Peralta And were taking you away from here m promoting you to Secretary of Public Safety in the state capital m most grateful Mr Governor These murders are a

all the way on shit Sir a couple of questions Are you changing the police force Were starting an investigation and steps will be taken by the book Whats that in plain Spanish Ask me about the economy m here to talk to investors When will the killing stop The media focus on these murders is ruining tourism in Jurez What tourism Its unfair that whenever you talk about Jurez people ask themselves Jurez The dead women And you reporters dont stress that theres a lot of good things going on What about the term femicide They should use that term around the world not just in Jurez Just cross the border On the road to Houston Theyve got their murdered women too Thats your response Lets welcome the Governor of the State of Chihuahua Mr lvarez How are you Governor Welcome Sir Thanks very much Thats him Yes Go Wheres your girlfriend dont know You dont know Where is she They kidnapped both of us dont believe you Where is she The next one goes in your head Where is she Answer me dont know It

bulletin says although that would be a first for Mickey Santos Anyway he was found dead a week ago and here in Jurez the one thing thats certain is Death Well on a somewhat lighter note Earlier today Kikay a Toyota subsidiary moved out of the Jurez Industrial Park How about that The good thing about being a transnational when things get ugly you vacate the premises and ciaooo Youre off to the other side of the world to find the same cheap labor the same cheap proletariat back to crime excavation continued today at the clandestine grave found just three days ago right there a top Lomas de Poleo It comes as no surprise that next to nothing is known about how when or who found the site not to mention the when or why of this gra ve from which womens bodies are still being removed Stop the killing Stop the killing Predictably some journalists showed up and just as predictably the Mothers in Mourning You know the ones women related to murdered or missing women Likewise our brandnew Chief of Police made an appearance The guy who ever since his appointment in a sinister way looks more and more like the old Chief All right then Good morning Jurez And with these latest deaths the number of murders has risen to With these latest deaths the number of murdered women has risen to the unbelievable total of To Captain Blanca Bravo relieved of her position since we may never meet again this
