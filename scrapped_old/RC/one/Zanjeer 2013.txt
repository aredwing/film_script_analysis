Every day around Hires of petrol Is stolen from every tanker We adulterate the petrol with kerosene and naphtha And later we sell the adulterated petrol at industries and small petrol pumps The Oil Mafia isnt just restricted to stealing petrol In fact their business runs deeper than the ocean The Oil Mafia calls it Paani Kana Huge ships transporting oil from rigs and refineries Have to stop at a point Its called Bravo Anchorage miles away from Mumbai harbour The waters beyond that arent too deep And so small transporters carry them ahead The Oil Mafia have an understanding with the captain They alert the mafia As soon as the ship reaches Bravo Anchorage If the coastal guards are on a strict vigilance The small ships are directed towards Alibaug And then they wait For the right time Trucks already wait at the tugs that carry this oil anchorage Places like Wadala Antop Hill and Kurla From there its sent to Indian Oil Nagar Taloja Deonar And even smuggled outside the state To escape police checkposts the drivers are handed fake bills In most cases the polices cut is decided According to an underworld source Winning a lottery is sheer luck But oil smuggling can make you a millionaire overnight Diesel bought at Are sold at Rs to petrol pumps If you add up all the entire nexus has a turnover of billion rupees every year Sir Vijays taking Kataria to court tomorrow Just
