You could have been critically injured or worse Its no big deal m fine Now can we please talk about something more important Like the fact that found the best spot ever for my community garden project

understand that you just risked your life looking for a spot to grow cucumbers No Not just cucumbers m pretty sure well plant zucchini turnips Maybe even some pea pods This isnt amusing Kara Mom Dad m sorry didnt mean to scare you like that just want to contribute something to the kingdom Of course my dear Ah You could act as Grand Marshal at the annual parade Ow meant something important Representing the royal family with a wellplaced wave is important And safe More like boring Kara you and your sisters are the future of this kingdom and the world is a much more dangerous place than you realize Isnt that so Baron Without question Your majesty These are troubling times indeed See There Ha Our most wise and insightful advisor agrees And he has never been wrong before Thats me reliable to a fault Faithful servant to the Crown But no more Bruce Now shall finally claim what is rightfully mine Everyone knows it was my family who first claimed the Kingdom of Windemere centuries ago Granted my greatgreat Grandfather lost it during a rather foolish game of rockpaperscissors But Still It should belong to me want to sit in the big chair and wear the big crown Not merely because can do a much better job but because deserve it And With this shall finally seize my Destiny Ahhh Huh Ha ha Uhoh Why you Do you have any idea how long it took me to find the ingredients for that elixir All for naught Down the drain And now must start all over again should truss you up with that tongue and roast you like a Cornish game hen Who would like some tea Oh you guys have to try the jam its delicious Mmm good jam yum Have seen the latest in molecular gastronomy Gabby we should take Corinne to the new zoo It wasnt open yet when she came to visit last summer You like animals right Of course she likes animals Zooey Who doesnt like animals dont Its getting out of control At the museum opening a couple of days ago My mom wouldnt let me cut the ribbon because she thought the safety scissors were too sharp Not funny If my parents had their way d spend the rest of my life throwing galas and perfecting my curtsey Its called being a Princess Kara Whats wrong with that m just saying that hosting royal teas and going to parties sounds pretty great to most people And dont get me started on all the shoes Corinne never said my life isnt great But all the ceremonial stuff its not enough And my parents are overreacting theres nothing dangerous about planting a garden What am gonna do get ambushed by a gang of Brussel sprouts Ugh Get away from me you little Corinne Dont Sorry Talk about overreacting Me You just tried to flatten a harmless butterfly Its a bug theyre all disgusting Even ladybugs You cant hate ladybugs Theyre so cute Theyre the kittens of the insect world Uh Kara You okay dont know feel kind of weird Whats that buzzing sound You guys hear that Do you have a fever Headache Muscle fatigue Did you eat the egg salad Intestinal discomfort could be an early

time you enter a room expect you to croak or ribbit or whatever it is you do are we clear Uhhuh Why are you even here Youre supposed to be out tracking down the ingredients for my new potion If it wasnt for you would already possess the power to destroy the King and seize the throne So unless youd like to go back to that swamp you came from find what need and do it quickly Uhhuh Huh Maybe should just leave these in seeing as that tree and are like magnets So any idea whats happening Not yet But weve devised a diagnostic protocol guaranteed to figure it out We already know you can fly so we can skip question one and move straight to question two Are you exhibiting any other powers Like superstrength Whoa Check Agility Check Anything else Uh invisibility Heat vision Ancient crowbar of destiny Ha Hmm Hmm Hmm guess not Huh That would be a check Ooh what about your hair Swing your head back and forth Looks good But m pretty sure it looked good before True But d say its bouncier No doubt about it Youre a superhero Youve got Princess Power But how Hmm origins can be tricky lot of superheroes are born on distant planets but were almost sure that youre from Windemere More like to be statistically accurate You werent by any chance bitten by a radioactive spider were you Cause that would make things easy Always one of my favorites Thats m You were bit by a mutant spider No that butterfly at the picnic It didnt exactly bite me but it did kind of kiss my cheek That sounds weird right No weirder than the rest of it So got kissed by a magical bug and now have superpowers Are you guys thinking what m thinking Test drive Whoohoo Wow Whoo Ow This is amazing Ooh Whoa No not again Hmm Hmm That was close Kara You okay Yeah m fine But this tree has got to go cant That would be a violation of the superhero code of conduct Theres a code Powers cannot be used for personal gain They can only be used to help others Oh What we need to do is find you a mission Like battling an alien invasion Or better yet stopping a runaway comet from hitting Earth How is that better Because aliens dont exist Comets actually do Guys maybe should start with something smaller and closer to home Like maybe The community garden Perfect Normally something like that would take weeks Lots of equipment Tons of manpower But with your powers you could whip it together in no time Whats wrong My parents Theres no way could pull it off without them finding out Somebody would recognize the Flying Princess of Windemere And then d be grounded for life Thats true the King and Queen would never let you do it But they might let Super Sparkle Super Sparkle You cant say it like that Youve got to give it some flair like this Super Sparkle See Much better And well design you a costume so nobody will know its you Its got to be aerodynamically efficient and strong Yet lightweight and breathable And sparkly Really sparkly Lets get to work Mmm Mmmmmm Mmmmmm Yeah All Right Meet you at the garden Last

rockslide Ha Total rookie mistake Maybe so But you were a rookie like last week was never that bad And why are you taking her side Kara chill The new girl messed up but maybe she could be an ally Theres room in the kingdom for more than one hero right Two might be even better It works for us Hmm Whoa Big deal she saved a statue m the one who caught the bad guys Wheres my picture Dont worry defenseless creatures ll save you No ll save you Dark Sparkle to the rescue Mmmmmm Those glittery nuisances will not stand in our way But as a precaution m doubling the ingredients to intensify my powers And once rid this realm of its King shall put an end to its heroes as well Hmm Wait a second Hmm No way cant believe youve been doing this behind our back all this time Intentionally putting yourself in danger day after day Its completely irresponsible Is it true Youre Super Sparkle Huh Zooey Gabby youre excused This nonsense stops here and now do you understand But you both said you were proud of Super Sparkles bravery That Windemere was lucky to have such a valiant hero That was before we knew it was our daughter Who lied to us never lied Not exactly just didnt tell you because knew this would happen Besides what difference does it make Unless youre planning to keep me locked up here forever you cant keep me safe from every single thing that might go wrong And even if the worlds as dangerous as you think which it isnt by the way have super powers to handle it Young lady stop that floating this instant Kara you may not understand this until youre older but its a parents job to decide whats best for their children and protect them no matter what Darling one day youll be an adult and when that time comes you can make your own choices But while you live under our roof under our rules you are forbidden to act as Super Sparkle Are we clear Mom Dad please dont do this That is final Ah ah ah Bruce we cant afford a repeat of last time can we Uhuh Hmm Good depth of color
