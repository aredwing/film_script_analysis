One thing ve learned in the last seven years in every game and con there is always an opponent and there is always a victim The trick is to know when youre the latter so you can become the former How deep did you bury that shareholder Paul Deep Are you sure this is a good idea He has to pay us something doesnt he But youve got more money than you could ever spend Thats all you think about nowadays He owes me and he owes you Now he has to pay Its cause and effect Sorry sir this table is closed Send him up m not sure thats a good idea Mr Hes got better mean a lot better All the tables are closed Send him up Paul Hold on think well take the stairs eh Billy You want to walk flights Jake Dont be silly dont like to feel trapped Never did never will Why should a man do what he doesnt like to do Jake if you want to take the stairs well take the stairs Theres always a choice Whats wrong with the stairs Come on youll be all right ve got to spend the next two minutes shaking and sweating like a crack whore clucking for a fix Should have taken the stairs cos its getting very very tight in here m afraid its only two at the table Mr Green Freddy youre done Have a seat Mr Green hear youve done very well for yourself and against all the odds They do say the harder the battle the sweeter the victory wise man once told me theres only one rule in this world a small question that drives all success The more a man invests in that question the more powerful that man will become Can you guess what that question is Mr Green Whats in it for me ve been warned if let you sit down at this table might regret it They say youve become very ambitious in your maturing and you now wish to acquire yourself a business a business like my business But we both know what you are dont we Jake Youre a man who needs a master Youre an employee So whats in it for me The pleasure of doing an old employee a favor by reminding him of the position nature chose for him Rade how much have you got Whats that got

the color spectrum between blue and white Always a royal winner Billy do the honors Dont you fucking move Dont let your mouth put you in more trouble than your body could handle ll tell you what ll do ll exercise a bit of charity Double or quits Youre on Come on Mr Green Mr Macha would appreciate it if you came back to the table havent finished with him yet Now would be a good time think its time to fly dont you Jake Excuse me Were coming through here Relax Youre in trouble Mr Green We could help Thank you take the stairs He got lucky Mr thats all Fuck luck the mans a danger Since hes been out hes made a fortune Mr Hes fat and comfortable Hes got what he wanted m sure we wont be hearing from him again He ate seven years Paul Seven years doesnt taste nice Not to mention the accident with his brothers wife And what the fuck does havent finished with him yet mean Get rid of him And dont want any mistakes No crackheads with sharp sticks acting like silly fucking gangsters You take Sorter and Slim Biggins You do it quickly you do it quietly We dont know what caused the blackout But weve run some blood tests and well have the results within a few hours Its a miracle you didnt sustain any damage from your fall Can go now Once youve put your clothes back on Well call you back with the results All right look ll take your man back Billy You go home Its late Go easy now yeah Joe Joe Jake Move Joe Move Get the hell out of here Al drive the fucking car Sit down and hold on Get in the car If wanted you dead would have shot you already Sit back and be quiet What He missed Sorter never fucking misses dont know what happened Something went wrong had him in my sights three times You never miss let alone three times Somebody told him we was coming Something is very wrong here Yeah somethings fucking wrong all right Dont make me angry Slim might have missed him but aint going to miss you not at this range Maybe its better you just drive Doreen Mr Green Mr Green Doreen Good morning Mr Green Avi Mr Green Mr Green Avi Sit down gather youre quite the player m a bit of an enthusiast myself thought maybe we could have a few games think you should tell me what is going on dont you We have your medical results from the hospital Its not important how we got them What is important however is what it has to say You will die within three days from a very unpleasant ailment that contaminates your blood and organs Thanks fellas ll get back to you on this one yeah Mr Green The longer you listen the sweeter the pitch Weve already saved your life once The next time will not be for free We shall assist you under two conditions These conditions are not negotiable Oh m being grafted Condition one We will bleed you dry You have to put on a better shirt before you bleed me dry my friend You will give us every penny you have got This is a con Its only natural that you think that you are somehow being conned but think a little harder and you will realize that this is not a trick Now condition two You will do as we tell you without argument This includes answering any questions that are asked You dont have a lot of time and in reality you dont have a choice Now the most sensible thing to do would be to get a second opinion Macha has unleashed his legions We can protect you from the dangers you face That is our deal You have three hours to decide After that you will be beyond our help Think m going to part with my hardearned cash for a set of homemade hospital results dont think so Not today dont have good news m afraid Mr Green Theyve thought this one through all right Oh theyre smart Smart as a pair of a little boys shoes She has to be in on it Thats how they got the results Got to find someone they couldnt have got to Well Jake m sorry theres theres no easy way to tell you this You have a rare blood disease How did they get to him Hes in on it After a few days think How much did they pay you What Who How much What are you talking about have no idea what you mean Youve got five seconds Five have no idea what youre talking about Four Wh Three Two dont know what you mean God No no When youre winning who thinks about losing But when youre faced with what m looking at a new and cold reality dawns fact we like to ignore You can not win The only prize they guarantee when you play this game is that you will lose Its only a question of when made a mistake You never miss so why now and why three times had a bad feeling Feeling m not sure if paid you to have feelings now did Sorter paid you because youre the best in the business Why would you let feelings confuse that relationship Listen to me Urgency has become something of an issue So if you could restrain those feelings until youve completed the mission would be most grateful Do you think you could do that for me Sure d appreciate it If there is one thing have learnt about experts theyre experts on fuck all If theres a rule you can bend it If theres a law it can be broken From now on am breaking all the rules because desperate men do desperate deeds Cash just seems to remain king doesnt it New bills Not too many of them in this town love a new bill Represents so much hope Look how clean and stiff it is It even smells proud Your work starts now Youll be driving We are and apologize for the unnecessarily dramatic moniker loan sharks People hate and fear us just like you will learn to hate and fear us We know how much you love a dollar bill and it wont be easy watching them fall through your hands because it will be your money that we will be loaning Dont say a word Just hold the bag and if we nod leave it on the table Theres nothing left Thats a very sad story Mr Horowitz My sympathies are with you and your colleague Maybe am being conned maybe am being fooled Excuse us for having to know the reason for your loan but we have to assess our clients very carefully They say the sentence has been passed the certificate signed so whats the point The point is this is the only option If you snap those fingers at me again ll fucking break em You know our rates right And our policies No offence gentlemen but you have a reputation wouldnt be speaking to you if had a choice Its a strange thing but still dont like to give it away know cant take it with me so why the pain Why the fuck does it still hurt And greasing the sheaths of these two pricks isnt making it any easier We need to know your history with Macha How much of it All of it Macha had these three clowns working for him called the three Eddies Flash loud proud and stupid They were looking after these shitty little games going on all over the city They were wild and dangerous but if you won they paid well Macha had lost his card man just before a big game Anyway they knew could play so they wanted me to take his place Like any man who was thinking refused So they started to lean on my brother and his family Hed just had a little girl at the time and the whole situation was getting messy How many legs has daddy longlegs got So for the sake of keeping the peace rolled over and agreed to play won and was done Thats very good Mr Green but tell me does your mum from a donkey Then some cowboy starts mouthing off wasnt having any of that shit m not having any of that shit ve got a funny one for you too George Very funny George This one will make you laugh Next thing you know its a gunfight people get hurt and money disappears Two weeks later someone drops my name and m being questioned The Eddies thought might talk so they threatened my brothers daughter The mother reacted badly like they do when their little ones are in danger They got into a fight and she took an angry stray bullet My brother lost his wife and his daughter lost her mother lost my sense of humor and seven years because wouldnt tell the authorities that Macha had organized the games Sometime after that the Eddies upset Macha in some way so he had them used as aggregate and mixed into some concrete on one of his buildings Macha had to pay something didnt he And know nothing hurts more than humiliation and a little money loss employ hundreds of people They have to be paid tomorrow We need three more days Try to understand What did sign up for Dont try to make sense out of it not now cos it doesnt make sense just know if you start a job then finish it promise Yes you will Goddamn right Their idea of discretion is to choose a motel whose only clients are blood come and afro sheen Make yourself at home Youll be hearing from us We cant see Gold What are you talking about ve been here for an hour m not the one who asked for a fucking meeting Apparently noone sees Gold Weve got one of his representatives Walker Lilly Walker Thats right Mr Macha dont think weve met m Miss Walker work for Mr Gold Do you mind if we walk understand you have been commissioned to do some work for us thought it might be a good idea if we had a little chat to make sure you understand the gravity of the endeavor you have undertaken Yeah do understand Everythings set The date hasnt changed youll get the powder by Friday Good Mr Gold has put his faith in you and he has people to please Weve heard you might be having some problems No no We dont like publicity Mr Macha No neither do wont let you down wont let Mr Gold down So were clear Mr Gold doesnt give more time or second chances As you can appreciate there is no shortage of people who wish to do business with Mr Gold Good day Heres your money What now Have a seat We need to know how much time you did and who you did it with Why Why The deal is we ask the questions had two choices inside chose the solitary spent hours a day locked up in between two salty convicts who had been down there for more years than they cared to remember One was a chess master the other a master conman They had never seen or spoken to each other but they might as well have been married they knew so much about one another Once a day the library on wheels would be pushed around by a pair of axemurdering twins that had pushed the trolley for years My neighbors used to write down chess moves and concepts of the con in the back pages of books based on subjects like Theoretical Astrophysics Part Four The Mathematics Of Quantum Mechanics They just used them for the con used to intercept the books because was sandwiched in between their cells Its a dangerous combination chess and cons These boys were locked up on their own for ten years with no distractions Nothing to do but think about how to steal one anothers pieces Yeah they thought They really thought was under the impression that was the clever bastard before went in But these boys were a completely different class Head tricksters of the premier division Their sole ambition was to create the ultimate con and win the ultimate game always thinking quicker always thinking bigger Gradually they thought theyd found a formula to the con Check formula to win the ultimate win the formula couldnt understand the depth of it but they were confident it was real and believed them After all theyd been right on everything else so now they felt theyd had their moment and it was time for them to leave the confines of their cell The concrete and steel wasnt even mentioned didnt even doubt them They got whatever they wanted anyway could smell their food through inches of concrete Bastards knew it used to drive me mad You bastards We were all going to go together they swore to me Youre coming with us Jake And trusted them Never for a second did doubt them Next day they were gone without a trace For the next week the authorities tore the place apart Couldnt find evidence of their existence let alone their exit They just evaporated Check Two years later was out But those two knew everything about me Everything All my dirty little secrets how much money had where kept it The hustling bastards cleaned me out They didnt leave so much as a pair of socks only a note Rule one You can only get smarter by playing a smarter opponent But had their formula and it worked It really worked Not doing you much good now is it Checkmate He needs to get moving Give him the addresses Why are they dragging this on They could just clean me out in one hit They want me to suffer These twisted bastards are making me pay Pay for my own pain Hands down thats the most radical concept have ever heard of and a part of me dies every time think about it told myself if this is my last round theyll have to tear me out piece by piece but this cant take Theyve found a weakness Caught me fair and square crosshaired blindfolded one foot in the grave and two hands on the coffin m cooked well done stick a fork in me and see if bleed Checkmate Youre quite good at this game Mr Green am stuck in a trance somewhere between hell and a hard place in a gear that doesnt exist and all want now is a little peace Where are you At the old ladys house Does she have it Of course she doesnt have it Shes barely got a heartbeat How the hell is this woman going to get that kind of money Thats what she owes Any furniture No Take the dog am not taking the dog Then take the The dont work Then get your ass over here How do you sleep at night How are we doing Ask the man No thanks darling Times up lets go Mr Green you took your time Did you get anything from the old lady No Did you get anything from Horowitz No Why not Because he didnt have it Listen pal either he pays or you pay pay anyway Dont be a smartass Look man we are not sending you out to polish door knobs Youve got to get with it man Doreen take his car Come with us What is this Where was security They gassed them We found them tied up Hold tight Mr Green It was a ton Hermann and Ziegler safe Mr It was impossible to break into Times up lets go Obviously it wasnt fucking impossible to move was it Paul What did anyone take it for We dont even use that safe do we Paul Checkmate How in the hell did you do that Not usually no Sam Golds powder was in there It came in yesterday No Paul youre wrong Try again You stupid motherfucker That should rattle him What the fuck was it doing on one of our properties Why dont you just fucking rape me Paul Pull the troops together Break some bones hurt some people results You hear me ll take care of it Youre damn straight youre going to fucking take care of it The word excuse does not exist in Sam Golds lexicon We are the walking dead until you fucking remedy this situation Do you understand ll take care of it said do you understand Yes Youd better In the meantime get some more powder dont care where it comes from or how much it costs just get it Theres only one man who can get us that amount on such short notice Who Lord John No way m not nourishing the competition Thats twice the market price Sorry we cant help Mr Paul Tonyll show you the way out All right Hold on hold on am prepared to talk What do you want to talk about get it What Am having djvu Paul Didnt just say get it This is Sam Gold have found myself chained to Mr Black Magic Mr lrunthisgame Gold Not some plastic gangster with a pocketknife for backup Gold doesnt give second chances Paul want in and want rewards Got it Paul when you make the deal keep both eyes on that untrustworthy greedy motherfucker If anyone asks you dont speak the language After you Mr Green m taking the stairs Whats the problem Mr Green dont like elevators What are you scared of Are you fucking deaf said just dont like them Tough because youre getting in Everything If he wants a fucking war m going to give him a fucking war dont think it was Lord John Mr He knows youd come looking for him Hes not far from wrong Because that is exactly what m going to fucking do ll take the stairs Before we do anything Mr we have to get Sam Gold his powder Dont pull the trigger Shut your fucking mouth ll get out You aint going nowhere said youre staying right here Get rid of the Lord there will be consequences Do look like m afraid of the consequences m taking the stairs You aint going nowhere You motherfucking listen Look at me You think m afraid of the fucking consequences Take the stairs You listen to me You open your mouth one more fucking time ll blow your fucking head off Fuck him Fuck the consequences Fuck them all Do look like m afraid No Do you understand me Do you Lou whats going on Were here How many Were doing a deal in the next room When do you make the trade Ten minutes Ten minutes Dont trust those yellow dogs dont trust anyone Lou Talk to me you motherfucker Or ll kill you myself The consequences can kiss my black ass This has become a large problem Avi Theres no such thing as problems Mr Green only situations Wake up Mr Green Checkmate How How what Weve kept you alive now you can tell me How do you keep winning Its very simple You do all the hard work just help you along The art is for me to feed pieces to you and make you believe you took those pieces because you are smarter and am dumber In every game and con there is always an opponent and there is always a victim The more control the victim thinks he has the less control he actually has Gradually he will hang himself as the opponent just help him along Is that the treasured formula The formula has infinite depth in its efficacy and application but it is staggeringly simple and completely consistent Rule one of any game or con You can only get smarter by playing a smarter opponent Rule number two The more sophisticated the game the more sophisticated the opponent If the opponent is very good he will place his victim inside an environment he can control The bigger the environment the easier the control Toss the dog a bone find their weakness and give them just a little of what they think they want Check So the opponent simply distracts their victim by getting them consumed with their own consumption Check The word snake springs to mind Dont knock it You only get smarter by playing a snake The bigger the trick and older the trick the easier it is to pull Based on two principles They think it cant be that old and they think it cant be that big for so many people to have fallen for it Eventually when the opponent is challenged or questioned it means the victims investment and thus his intelligence is questioned Noone can accept that not even to themselves Checkmate aint playing you again Youll always find a good opponent in the very last place you would ever look Youve got more tricks than a clowns pocket dont you Mr Green Everything all right Can they hear you Two minutes Youre Get out Jake as soon as you can had to dig very deep to find someone whod talk Theyre the last resort Theyre the last resort When no other loan sharks will lend them your boys move in They stepped on Golds toes and he wouldnt touch em Gold Yes the Gold Sam Gold Mr Clandestine Mr Ambiguous Mr Mystery Get out of there Get out of there Jake Noone lives and displeases Gold Noone but your two friends Got to be something wrong with em if Gold wont touch em Got to be something wrong if the Goldfather wont touch em Noone sees Gold but Gold sees everything The smoke signals say Dodge em like an angry bullet Tell your friend to get out of there Jake get out of there Get out of there Get out of there Tomorrow Youre worse than a stuck record Tomorrow tomorrow Tomorrow is never going to come is it Hello its warming up Zach kick him see if that jogs him on You want me to play mother took care of Horowitz Its your turn Change of plan can see whats coming Give it to Mr Green Mr Green Shoot Fred for me Not dead stupid just in the back of the knee aint shooting Fred Zach Sometimes a little voice tells you to think about number one Told you Avi Never had the gumption never going to have what it takes Its easier than you think Its one little squeeze just like a tube of toothpaste Who the fuck are you two You cant see whats right in front of you Youre supposed to be stiff cold and horizontal and you

out Is she all right Dont you worry about her You just look after yourself Mr Green dont know how to tell you this Our first results they must have been wrong cannot apologize enough for this error Youre not a well man but We have to assess our clients very carefully There is something about yourself that you dont know Something that you will deny even exists until its too late to do anything about it Its the only reason you get up in the morning the only reason you suffer the shitty boss the blood the sweat and the tears This is because you want people to know how good attractive generous funny wild and clever you really are Fear or revere me but please think m special We share an addiction Were approval junkies Were all in it for the slap on the back and the gold watch The hip hip hoofuckingrah Look at the clever boy with the badge polishing his trophy Shine on you crazy diamond Cos were just monkeys wrapped in suits begging for the approval of others If we knew this we wouldnt do this Someone is hiding it from us And if you had a second chance you would ask Why Why what Why am still alive Why did you give my money away Why didnt you want em to know Why didnt you want me to know Youll find out soon enough Whilst ve been digging around on Lord John came across a couple of cashtalking shitsniffers who came up with the name Green Thats right Jake Green Go on m working for his brother Patrick couple of opportunists looking after his older brother got a little bit greedy Want to impress you All right you take Sorter and Slim Biggins and enough men to avoid an excuse Its

Move Youve got to tell the boss Why me Because youre the one who ordered the pizza This time youre going to tell me whats going on Two sugars am right Forget the tea Avi Thank you Jenny that will be all You didnt tell us the truth about the three Eddies did you Mr Green The Eddies upset Macha in some way so he had them used as aggregate and mixed into some concrete on one of his buildings Would you like us to remind you of what really happened The Eddies were waiting for you when you got out of prison It was Machas fault They didnt work for him any more and wanted to compensate you What they really meant was they wanted to put grams of angry lead in the back of your fucking head But you gave them an offer they couldnt refuse Noone kills a man whos going to make em money So you would give them a month on any money they would lend you You needed the money quickly for some small but profitable deal that youd made on the inside In fact it was more profitable than any rate they can get anywhere legal or illegal So one of them said m in month later he got his money back Plus your Now nobody kills a man whos going to make him money They always protect their investment can give you a month You know this is just between us Thats right Eddie Next deal this time theyre all in give you a month For two years you always came through regular like clockwork But there was no deal You would take money off of one Eddie and repay the other Eddie plus the Plus your On top You were not greedy you did it nice and slow You were paying for their trust This is just between us right Jake Thats right Eddie It was the easiest money theyd known Soon they couldnt give you their money fast enough few months later they didnt have enough of their own to lend so they started to borrow money off Macha Plus your Plus your Macha became interested How could the Eddies have such a good little earner They hid you like a dirty little secret Find out whos behind this Whos behind this Ask no questions hear no lies They tell anything but the truth Find out if Green is behind this Is Jake Green behind this ll tell you no its not Jake Green Theyd do anything to protect their investment m not sharing the golden goose But Macha got his interest so he kept loaning them more and more Lend them the money You were back gambling making more money than you knew what to do with You were rich am rich Seriously fucking rich After a year you had enough of the Eddies money or should say Machas money Now m richer lot fucking richer to buy a chain of hotels So you went on a discreet threemonth holiday You took your brother his daughter Machas money and you enjoyed yourself bit of the old sun sand sea and sausages The Eddies meanwhile were having a terminal argument about how they were going to pay back Macha that obscene amount of cash they owed him want my money back Paul Those boys really suffered Jake The more they told the truth the more they suffered Its Jake Green Hes telling the fucking truth They told me that story already Give me the truth You gave them just enough rope to hang themselves Youre a good little conman Jake And you think youre smart and you are just not as smart as you think you are Elvis Come here If wanted vinegar would have ordered French fries Get me something with a price tag on it Mr Green What did he do anyway Hamish Its were among friends Come on what have you got for me What am going to tell him Thats your problem but it had better be good turned up to pick them up and that is what saw Thats a fascinating story have one question for you How How what How what There were six of us plus Slim Biggins who counts as another six How many were there of him One One So how exactly did this one manage to disarm and overpower a fourtime national bodybuilding champion drag him half a block throw him over a sixfoot wall and then get him to eat his own gun Get down boss Just find the gunman Dont fucking move Lou Lou Keep the boss down What the fucks going on dont know Sorter just shot the and he went in the kitchen Nobody fucking move Bastard Keep the fucking boss down She shot my finger off The bitch shot my finger off Who is it Happy Tony Lord Johns man Not looking so happy now is he Check shes dead Lou Greed gets them all in the end Now shoot straight Sorter Glad to see youve got those feelings in check Find a couple of Lord Johns boys and persuade them to tell you where my powder is What is the first rule of any game Mr Green The only way to get smarter is by playing a smarter opponent Whats rule two of any game The more sophisticated the game the more sophisticated the opponent Almost the same but where does it stop Mr Green Where does this game stop It stops when you start to give me answers Dont let them play head games with you Jake Is it me thats playing head games with you Mr Green Youve heard their voice for so long you believe it to be you You believe it to be your best friend They should believe their opponent to be their best friend Wheres the best place an opponent should hide In the very last place you would ever look Do you know who Sam Gold is Mr Green You should because he knows who you are The Gold Sam Gold Mr Clandestine Mr Ambiguous Mr Mystery Hes all up here pretending to be you Noone sees Gold but Gold sees everything Youre in a game Jake Youre in the game Everyones in his game and nobody knows it And all of this this is his world He owns it He controls it ve had enough of this shit Tell him youve had enough He tells you what to do Look thats enough and when to do it Tell him said thats enough Avi Eventually when the opponent is challenged or questioned it means the victims investment and thus his intelligence is questioned Noone can accept that not even to themselves Hes behind all the pain there ever was Behind every crime ever committed How can be behind all the pain all the crime if dont even exist And right now hes telling you that he doesnt even exist Noone lives and displeases Gold Noone but your two friends We just put you to war with the only enemy that ever existed and you you think hes your best friend And they will protect their best friend with everything theyve got Youre protecting him Mr Green but with what Wheres the best place an opponent should hide In the very last place youd ever look Hes hiding behind your pain Jake Youre protecting him with your pain Embrace the pain and you will win this game And know nothing hurts more than humiliation and a little money loss If you change the rules on what controls you you will change the rules on what you can control How radical are you prepared to be Mr Green The more power you think you have in Golds world the less power you have in the real world You are still in prison Jake In fact you never left Remember who they are Jake Head tricksters word slicksters You wanted answers and they gave you riddles You know the rules the longer you listened the sweeter the pitch Hes got all
