remember things Her If could just see her If could just understand how it happened think could put this All back together There are many different techniques for hypnosis Some are like guided meditations or are conscious of everything around you What do is deep trance hypnosis lead you into your subconscious with an intention and there we reconnect the memories How does it sound If it

the best approach Why Have you ever kept a secret really kept one Something about yourself you cant discuss The mind works the same way dont understand Whatever secret your mind is hiding Ginny is not the one with the answers It lies elsewhere Then how do we find it d like to try a different technique to put you under simple handshake Action learned as a single chunk of behavior Tying your shoelaces is another example When that action is diverted The mind responds by suspending itself in trance What is this Element Why did you bring me here What do you want me to see Take me back to my office need to understand why the accounts were changed Element Theres nothing else Tell me why you brought me here North North How long Nearly two hours You cant force your mind to travel places it
