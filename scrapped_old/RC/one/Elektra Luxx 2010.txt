Hi m Bert Rodriguez from En Pelotas Magazine the Latins world numero uno source for breaking sexy news Chronicler if you will of the secret history of Hollywood Humble memorialist of the vertiginous ups and precipitous downs of the worlds greatest female porn stars because porn stars are people too And dont mean objectifying them No sir En Pelotas is about paying tribute to those Amazon creatures walking among us who make the term sex goddess sound woefully undernourished And in a world increasingly known for its surgical enhancements and questionable pubic hairstyles one performer stands Or is it stoodtaller than the rest And that is the initimable And that is the ininim And that is the inimitable Elektra Luxx Let me take you back to a time before all the acclaim the drug busts before the highprofile affair with Nick Chapel and the detritus of their ensuing sex tape Let me deposit you in the wasteland of adult entertainment in the s dark era in which the silicone craze erupted like a Macedonic volcano and gonzo slayed the plotdriven pictures of yesteryear Even in that toxic environment she managed to elevate standard mature programmers such as Sticky Sweet Volume and Natural Born Killer Naturals Eventually earning herself an unprecedented five consecutive Fox of the Year awards from the But if one performance perfectly captures the moment where she turned the page and went from promising sex kitten to behemothic superstar it would have to be her turn as twin nymphomaniac sisters in the precisely titled It is here that Elektra first puts into play her looktothecamera theory The rest as they say is history Take a look With this seemingly harmless breaking of the proverbial fourth wall Miss Luxx pretty much started a revolution Seems immaterial now but at the time there were rumors she had looked at the camera awaiting direction or simply thought the camera was in another place altogether Nonsense Take a look at Dial for Super Sex Am interrupting something Its her Its Super Sex Huh What do you bad boys want all that money for To get some pussy Buy some beer Lets deal with the beer later First things first And here she is in The Best Girl Scout Cookies Were lost totally lost Itll be hours before they send out a search party will gather some sticks to make a fire know a better way to keep warm We cant asked your group leader Stacey to marry me So marry her Group Leader Stacey taught me to share and we share everything The success of Nymphomaniac Twin Sisters was such that the producers signed her up for the hotter sequel Wetter Than Seattle This is the one with the famous orgy scene in which Elektra joins herself in bed for what Adult World News called the big bang of all sex scenes Berto What You told me you took out the trash did did take it out It won every major award at the show including two best actress statuettes for Miss Luxx You didnt take it out Mom please not now Please The industry being as literal as it is Elektra soon starred as the worlds most jawdroppingly curvilinear astrophysicist in The Big Bang earning herself another nomination for best group sex scene but losing to newcomer Venus Azucar in what is still a hotly debated decision When are you going to take it out When you begin to mount the edge of the most fantastic shivering spasm its not bad form to look him in the eye and say dont know where m going but if you move will kill you And if youre with a woman you might also compliment her hair Nothing makes us more insecure even with our ankles behind our ears than our hair looking
