coming in on such short notice Henry You look marvelous Just grand You get younger every day Thank you Victor You met Detective Owens yesterday at the house Happy San Sebastian to you Same to you Mr Hearst ll burn us some coffee Nonfat milk if you have it dont think he heard me actually He reminds me a lot of you Only listens when it suits him Thats unfair Henry Not only am a good listener but keep it all in here Anyway we should have this cleared up in no time Perhaps under the circumstances should be calling you Captain Oh no No need for that formality do apologize about the timing know youre due across the street We just need to clarify some of the details from your report Your superintendent is one of the charitys biggest supporters know know So if youll help us put an end to some of these nagging questions why well have you on your way wouldve thought youd be at the party already You do know how to have fun dont you Victor Tuxedos all ready to go must say Henry you seem in high spirits what with all this on your doorstep How should behave Hows Chantal Waiting noble quality in that young woman Something mine didnt seem to want to do was sad to hear that We always thought you made a charming couple Charming perhaps but dull apparently You see the children much Both of my daughters are living with their mother back in New York City Must be hard during the holidays and all We should get on with it No milk m sorry No thanks Youre into charity Why dont you fundraise us up a cappuccino machine so all the lowlifes that come through here can enjoy a solid cup of coffee was just going to ask Mr Hearst about the dog Oh yeah Right The mystery dog Actually like ghost dog Thats got a nice ring to it Can we start again come in here like you ask and Mr Congeniality here is taking a hostile manner with me Its this case Henry It has everyone on edge But its just This business is strange going by whats in the record But lets see Here January Yesterday afternoon You say you were out jogging with a dog Yes Mans best friend Belonging to a neighbor of yours named Ricardi You ever own one When was a boy my family had Great Danes But you dont own one now Chantal prefers cats So do you have a cat Too unsanitary Chantal would want a cat but only if it could be sanitized What do you mean Cats are always licking themselves dumped a girlfriend once because of her damn cat Thing had me up all night slurping away dog is a lot more unsanitary but at least when theyre sleeping they sleep Thank you for that Anyway the messiest is a canary She refused that too But for once stuck to my guns can be quite firm if need to be What was his name again Tango Do you write that just like tango How else would you write it like waltz or foxtrot When you were questioned you said discovered the girl What were not clear about here is what the dog was doing So Logically you would expect that the dog would have found the girl Well suppose it did But you say you found her Well me the dog We were together We found the body What difference does it make called the police Unless perhaps you think the dog called and disguised his voice Mr Hearst two young girls have been found strangled within the past days It is my job to find the murderer Youre a principal witness to the crime scene Now have to make sure that the facts of your statements agree with the other facts of the case Mr Hearst doesnt appear to be as distressed today m a guest here ll be treated with respect Sergeant Opie Owens Thats Detective Owens Please Please Lets all Lets all relax Everyone has somewhere else theyd like to be Now Henry if you dont mind please tell us one more time how you came upon the girl jogged up to Ricardis like always do grabbed the dog Better run him a little faster Henry Hes getting a belly as round as yours Fuckin old geezer Come on boy Lets go Lets go This dog He was definitely with you What dialect do you need this in Yes the dog was with me The dog was with me Got it Youre saying Tango He was there Good Youre catching on Tangos all right Keeps me company on my runs We took the path by my house like always Suddenly Tango wasnt there Tango come on boy called to him but he wouldnt come could hear him He was growling barking acting peculiar Thats when turned back kept calling Tango come on boy The dog wouldnt come You couldnt see the girl at this point Obviously not from the path But could see Tango in there moving around So you ventured off into the grove Thats when saw her At first thought she was asleep She was almost want to say angelic The way she just lay there Her eyes They were dark brown They were still open Sue Ellen Huddy She was three days shy of her th birthday How did you discern she was dead touched her mean put my head on her chest There was no heartbeat That was that The dog found the body Thats correct Mr Ricardi states firmly that you did not run the dog yesterday He admits that on most days you do but not yesterday Well he just doesnt remember right Well that may be but in that case your neighbor Miss Lazzo doesnt remember either And another neighbor Mr Irwin also suffers memory loss In the whole area youre the only one who remembers correctly Who am to believe Them naturally Come on Youre taking this personally m just trying to find the truth You know you enjoy hounding me How is that Henry You forget know all your tricks murder by some thug or nutcase Thats average But when its a pillar of the legal community thats more than just a witness Then its banner headlines television Itd help in your push to become our next police superintendent right Come on Victor Confess See got you Lets say youre right Everything you say bag a prominent attorney hang his pelt on the trophy wall of my new luxurious offices What about your neighbors then Are you saying that theyre all out to get you too How would know Why would they be Maybe because m very rich Because have a big house and a glamorous wife have these things and it happens dont deserve them My looks are entirely ordinary and m no genius Mediocre people tolerate success when it comes to someone exceptional like a movie star or an athlete but when it comes to one of their own then it strikes them as being an injustice You agree think were getting a little far a field Interesting thing is there were no dog prints found at the murder scene and we know that without the dog you never wouldve seen the body In other words your ghost dog story reeks There were dead leaves everywhere How do you make dog prints in dead leaves Detective Opie dont know Tell me Youre a tax attorney Good at making up fantasies Thats what they pay you for right The dog was there Jesus Hold it now Hold it Hold on Yesterday Damn Theyre all correct about Tango didnt pick him up at Ricardis met him out on the path Geez Really had me going there for a sec Good He gets out sometimes and he runs around the gardens Half the time Ricardi doesnt even know hes missing until bring him back remember now that called him Tango come here boy Come on You just went off with him Yeah Tangos my buddy Arent you Go on Go on Run Perhaps youll understand how our ears prick up every time your story changes Yes and certainly hope this one works because m banking on this lame dog story to get me off the hook Crap How much longer do gotta put up with this Owens Youre out of line Good boy Speaking of dogs you keep yours on a leash You dont need a lawsuit Now you listen to me Victor This is getting ridiculous When you called me you told me it was gonna be ten minutes Now look at this m afraid its gonna take a little longer can see the notion of civic duty and being a good citizen is just a myth dont remember who said it You dont seem to remember very much dont remember who said the police will ensure public safety everywhere except inside a police station You called before anyone knew Sue Ellen was missing Well does that make me the murderer It says right here ran home and called the police My God there must have been several places closer wasnt thinking just ran home Or maybe you thought d better wash up first dont like your tone And frankly m beginning to find yours more and more interesting What are you recording Do you have any idea why youre still here Maybe you should call a lawyer down here am a fucking lawyer This is January San Juan Police Headquarters m Captain Benezet With me is Detective Owens Were talking to Mr Henry Hearst Do you have your permission to tape this interview Henry Why not have nothing to hide Thank you Now thenyour name age profession and marital status Come on Name age profession and marital status please You just said my name Fine Whatever Hearst Henry Buchanan Hearst m Your house is called The Ilado up on Old San Juan

difference does it make You ever hear of adopting You walk somebody elses dog Thats true tact Thats very elegant Do you think thats elegant This is what think remember that you couldnt afford law school remember you waiting on tables Wed swagger in drunk trotting along hotlooking dolls spending money you know we didnt earn think the matter at hand is payback Thats what think When Detective Owens arrived at your house at Yesterday he noted that you were not wearing jogging clothes showered Before you called Of course not called as soon as came home want to report a dead body Officers also noted that your wife had not yet been told about the girl She was in the bedroom It says here you called from the bedroom You had to lie down You were distraught Wed had an argument When you got home No earlier Please dont go into this now Victor Its none of your business Damn it Henry Chantal was in the bedroom She was not The dog was with you The dog was not Tell me one thing that adds up so we can go across the street and have a good time Its a pity that youve never been to our home Then youd understand But was was there Downstairs theres that Upstairs it gets instructive Theres nothing real special about it Mr Hearst didnt say special He said instructive Thank you Well lets see Upstairs Theres a hallway right Theres along hallway Sixty feet Possibly Definitely count five rooms up here The extra bedrooms were for the children which were never used The guest bedroom was redecorated for my wife Our old room is now mine In between the hallway Sixty feet long You have separate bedrooms My lovely Chantals affliction is the greeneyed monster They say that jealousy is all the fun you think somebody else is having Chantal can be unbearable promise you She have reason to be Regardless of what you think of me do love my wife ve always loved her The only thing ever wanted was to be happy with Chantal and have children But the pitterpatter of little feet was not to be Check those out certainly would like to It certainly pays to advertise Ben Thomas caught you in the act Married men should be more subtle Wheres Henry Hell be right along Had a business matter to tidy up thought saw him walking into the police station as we drove up to the valet Hell be right along Well what do we discuss now Weve pretty much exhausted canaries and dogs Lets talk about the first murder if you dont mind down in La Perla Happened not too long ago just over two weeks Little girls body was found Paulina Valera Twelve years old Poor island girl Mother was a street hooker living in a motel not too far away We think it started somewhere in the streets Paulina was lured or she ran Either way the killer left her body in the dump Yeah Tell him ll be right out When get back Henry want you to tell me what you were doing in La Perla the night Paulina Valera was killed Superintendent m waiting to introduce good citizen Henry Hearst in lets see minutes And m told hes still in there Thats right Victor do you realize how important this fundraising event is Yes we have two dead girls But we also have countless children whose homes were blown away in the hurricane We have open sewers We have a cholera epidemic Sir realize You obviously do not How will the sponsors react if Henrys accused imagine extremely grateful that their children are safe Just have him across the street by okay What time you got Time to go Your pulse is racing m due to give my speech Speech Yes know ve been told Two patrol officers wrote down the license plate number of your Range Rover which was parked in the vicinity of the crime scene Your expensive vehicle attracted attention Officers thought it might be stolen called it in That puts you in the area Henry Any time youre ready Me m just hoping this is as good as ghost dog You know where you were three weeks ago Sergeant Opie was right here serving coffee to standup citizens like yourself was at my sisterinlaws had knocked back a few at the club and had this inspiration to drop off some Christmas gifts for the kids Name and address Henry dont know the exact address but know where it is Its Maria and Paco Rodriguez Should be in the book Chantals older sister Great kids How are you Fine Marias done a fabulous job with them Merry Christmas Why didnt Chantal go with you Its her sister Its complicated Paco Merry Christmas need to know more about this No you dont talked to her She gave up a little bit of dirt She says that its the first time that either Henry or Chantal had stopped by in a long time She didnt sound too friendly Why you pick that night to thaw the ice It has nothing to do with anything Whered you go next went home Police reported your car at You see this is what we here at the police We call it a window of opportunity was driving drunk was just driving terribly most definitely needed to walk off the liquor La Perlas not a good idea for a man wearing Armani It was a beautiful night This place doesnt scare me Well it should So Where did you go found a bench sat down found a bench sat down fell asleep Found a bench Woke up dont know when Felt better went home Whats gonna stop me from shoving my fist down his throat The police would rather that drove home drunk All right Henry Lets revisit this bench later First want an answer to my question as to why Chantal didnt accompany you that night Its between the sisters met Paco Rodriguez Hes a hot local artist Busted him once smoking grass Who doesnt on this island You smoke a little grass Henry Do you God knows it would help with your sunny disposition m thinking you dont fancy Chantal hanging out with a handsome successful younger man Do you Is this necessary How old was Chantal when you married her Twenty Right Henry Youre what right m Goddamn it This is a fucking outrage You know that Youve no right to pry into my private affairs with these soap opera insinuations Look at you Victor Doing a bangup job policing the island Drugs everywhere Just Crime is rampant Superintendent my butt Youll be lucky if you still have a job m sorry m really sorry This is really rather unbearable for me dont suppose that Detective Owens could get me a cold drink If you would Detective My pleasure All right Henry Whats going on here Do you have anything a little stronger stashed away around here Okay Victor Whats it gonna take to get me out of here We both know that could march in an army of attorneys m intrigued theyre not here already Henry Youre hiding something something you dont want to get outside this room Now its just you and me Tell me about Chantal You tell me about Kate and Consuelo If having a difficult marriage makes me a murderer youd be Son of Sam Touch Kate and married too young She grew to want somebody better man with a real job money to buy things she came to know that other men were only too happy to buy for her And Consuelo Consuelo just hates me being a cop You stuck with your guns You cant tell me being a cop isnt exciting And you obviously enjoy harassing people You dont see folks running up to me at cocktail soirees saying Gee whiz a tax attorney Wow What a cool job Wish could do that Wouldnt mind what you got Henry Used to be enough Chantals green monster extends to her sisters marriage You see Maria married for other more tried and true reasons despite her mothers objections Married a man closer to her own age man of modest means Dashing young artist Beautiful women They are a breed unto themselves Wouldnt you agree beautiful woman moves through life unchallenged men giving them everything that they want First their daddies then their boyfriends and husbands ll drink to that For some beauty is their only talent Theres always somebody more beautiful Somebody younger Chantals mother taught her that Why are you doing this to me Victor certainly hope youve gotten your petty thrill pulling back the curtain But theres nothing more to see ll tell you what see Henry see the bodies of two young girls murdered The man who did thats going to answer to me You make me sick Why do you keep saying The man who did it the one responsible the killer Why dont you put a name to this

of questions anymore But m sure youre going to tell me We have reason to believe he was in La Perla where a young girl named Paulina Valera was raped and murdered and left on a garbage dump need to know whose name the house is in The house was a gift Then may have your permission to search the house You may not You said you were hungry Whatd she say You all set Castillo Yes sir Start recording was talking to you Thats right Victor only listens when it suits Victor listen Henry was listening when you told me you left your sisterinlaws and drove to La Perla that you went for a walk and fell asleep on a bench Now d like to hear something that vaguely resembles the truth That is the truth Chantal says you got home at told you went for a walk was drunk may have had another drink You happen onto Via Del Mar Boulevard Do you want to party with me What do you want Did you see any hookers No You didnt talk to any hookers No Spend time with one perhaps Absolutely not Youre lying Henry Your carotid artery is pumping like crazy And your eyes They turn down and to the left Thats what liars do Its a fact Our bodies give us away Do you know what these do They keep me awake havent been sleeping much Since you found Sue Ellen Huddys body ve been working straight through And ve got so much to share with you For instance accompanied those two officers who phoned in the license number from your Range Rover We went back to La Perla They showed me exactly where you parked We conducted some interviews Imagine my surprise when several prostitutes recognized your photo said youd been coming around for months Jesus Christ Victor shes in the next room m talking about street hookers needle users crackheads not highclass call girls Curb crawlers for Gods sake My God That old carotid artery is pumping like gangbusters God damn you Chantal cant hear you not with the door closed Unless turn the speaker on Please She was blond Obviously peroxide being Hispanic She would truly have been beautiful without all that makeup never knew her name Do you miss me huh Yes you do left my sisterinlaws house to have sex in an alley with a prostitute be a good little girl for you Little girl finished myself off drinking any goddamn thing wanted at the Sunshine Cafe whiskey What do you think That d spend my life banging on my wifes my wifes door d find a substitute someone just the opposite from Chantal prostitute is a woman who will give you a great deal for relatively little money Well as an alibi dont know Henry lot of women in Puerto Rico die their hair blond especially in that profession but ll tell you what do know One of them admitted shed been with you last week Her name was Reina Do you know this man No Yes She was young much younger than the others And she says thats why you like her But this must be an old picture Why The guys bald now Bald Mmhmm You remove your hairpiece down there as well dont you Henry It seems nobody remembers you with the rug Trying not to be recognized Thats smart Pick em up in your car somebody might catch a license plate This one likes it quick From behind He pumps me hard At least he comes fast Then goes like he doesnt want to be here But like it fast Gets me back into my corner But a week ago is no alibi is it Henry Why Henry Why here like this in the dirt Think of the highclass escorts you can buy Suites at the Ritz Don Perignon And you choose this Dont tell her will you Victor Please imagine Chantal will be thrilled to learn you were with a prostitute instead of what you were really doing Rapists leave bodily fluids semen Your testll prove that it wasnt me You use condoms with your prostitutes Of course What kind dont know Trojans Whatever they have The killer used condoms Chemical lubricants were found in the victims Hes smart like you Knows all about our lab tests Both victims were raped from behind Both victims were strangled from behind Thumb and fingerprints on the victims necks confirmed this Are you here all by yourself Then you put the clothes back on Dirt and leaves inside the garments confirmed this as well Pretty blouse you have on there Then you pose them Each on the side little heads resting on cupped hands And you combed their hair The lack of debris suggests this And we have reason to believe you took their photograph Stop it Photography is your hobby isnt it Isnt it Stop it Whats wrong You all right m fine You want some water No m perfectly fine ve never been better m just tired You dont look exactly fresh as a daisy yourself You surf Henry The Internet This is a statement from your webbrowser provider Your mail address is hhearstelpuerto Com You sometimes use an online alias Hard Body Hank Very catchy God does this ever end simple yes or no Henry Yes Yes It seems that Hard Body Hank has visited several pornography sites one of which is called Barely Legal It features young ladies posed as schoolgirls That website features women not children Christ Every time check mail theres a new message from some electronic bimbo luring me to her site So checked it out a few times Whats the big deal And the prostitutes What does that prove That m lonely That dont get it at home That my wife makes me sleep down the hall And all this makes me a pedophile a rapist a killer of children Why would do such a thing dont know Henry Not yet Lets talk about this glamorous wife who keeps poor Henry shivering in the hall You know what Chantal says Shes lying Whatever she said never touched Camille Whos Camille All right Mrs Hearst Lets talk about your separate bedrooms Henry says it was his choice he moved out Hes wrong Hes wrong or hes lying Lets not quibble over words But words can be very amusing Words like conjugal duty for instance which Henry claims you have not been performing with willing good spirits To be honest he says youre not performing at all He has been revealing things hasnt he d like to hear your side The most interesting things Those m sure he kept to himself Not Camille m afraid That is the reason you sent him down the hall with his toothbrush and wash cloth Hes out there afraid hoping for a miracle that one day things will turn out all right as long as nobody speaks of them Hes right to To what Hope To be afraid Christmas Day two years ago We always used to spend Christmas with Maria and Paco Of course this was before Yeah Thats what understand couldnt wait to see my niece Camille Their children were special with an extra share of magic and grace and purity Camille was one of them Henry and were extremely fond of her How are you They seem very close Dont they You look great You too We were all having a good time the way families should beat Christmas But then Henry got drunk Red anybody No thanks Youve already poured it out have He started making remarks Please excuse my husband About me and Paco Excuse the husband yeah Something Paco seems very adept at It was embarrassing Henry was angry This the first time No Is it some kind of secret that Paco finds my Chantal enchanting Henry dont So what did you do Dont what told him to shut up Just dont After dinner Maria and opened our presents Books for me Thanks She wanted to read and jewelry for her that wanted to wear Why got up when did dont know Unless you call intuition a reason But he wasnt there Something led me toward the bedrooms dont get it Come here They were there Let me see In her room Yes Thank you He was talking and she was listening couldnt tell you what he was saying but the way he talked to her was the way you talk to a woman remember how she smiled the look in her eyes He had no right to make her smile that way And you continued to stay together each at your own separate ends of the hall And you never had sex since Youre putting on quite a show for Henry arent you Right now he cant hear you Once a woman decides thats its not important Even when would try to get things back to normal that image was always with me And since you cant have children Of course can Would you mind telling me how old you were when you and Henry met think was about when we came over from Europe Henry became my fathers attorney here They sailed together He was always around In our families you could always find some friend of your fathers with a boat in St Thomas or a penthouse in Manhattan And that man was Henry Now your father He died when you were what Fourteen And Henry became your surrogate father He paid for my college And thats when you became lovers wasnt interested in boys my age Spring break couldnt wait We did it on Henrys yacht then in hotels in cars on beaches everywhere He was different with me He was tender We had a time Henry and can imagine So can you imagine his anger at not being able to make love to you now ve seen it Youve seen it As in he raped you Rape is an act of anger Its about control not about sex Henry was a very angry man Do you think hes guilty Do you That night he visited your sisters home Did you notice any scratches on him signs of struggle cant remember need to get my hands on the clothes he was wearing that night Please Give me permission to search your house Because you saw your husband talking to your niece on Christmas Eve youve thrown him out of your bedroom and havent slept with him in two years Now dont you think thats a little bit harsh Stop trying to bait me What do you call a beautiful young woman whos jealous of her yearold niece Honest Honest dont know whos more fucked up you or him m sorry But dont you want to know youve been right about him Dont you Dont make a mess Castillo Take a squad of men Escort Mrs Hearst back to her house Yes sir Castillo search the house Yes sir Say it Go on Say it She tells you about Camille everything falls into place

All right Lets go Sit down Henry Going man to man now are we Shall roll up my sleeves Christmas Two years ago You and Camille Let me see dont get it It was nothing absolutely nothing Camille dragged me into her room to show off a Christmas gift from her mother Even a knucklehead should be able to She was high on a sugar rush from pumpkin pie This would look good on you Couldnt keep still Smile So Chantal overreacted Chantal never let you touch her after that You know there are many things that separate couples Infidelity money long illness m separated from my wife by a hallway a foot hallway In fact its a desert that hallway And at the very end theres a door And when its locked you can knock all you want but that door wont open Why do you hold on Why not just get a divorce Just trade one nightmare for another Lets add it up Half my money the house d end up living over somebodys reconverted garage Oh yeah and then theres half my share of the law firm Thats bullshit Henry Its vanity pure and simple Being with her puts you on everybodys list Youre Puerto Ricos glamour couple Ah Henry and Chantal Hearst Theyre so in love Just full of compliments arent we Thats why you stay married At our age finding another woman like thats not so easy Not so easy if youre taking them back to your thirdfloor walkup piece of shit amonth studio apartment Is that what you mean Victor Well we cant all afford to wine and dine classy sophisticated ladies we meet in La Perla can we Just whod your wife find you with before she relocated in such a hurry Fuck you Henry Whoops Tell me Sue Ellen Huddy
