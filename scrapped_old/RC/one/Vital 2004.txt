drying For today remove the whole cover Inspect your sub ject Are there any operation scars Make a thorough inspection Make a long vertical incision here Then make a lateral incision Take this corner piece Is it usual f or a subject to be so young No its very rare wonder how she died Youll find out as you dissect Whats wrong Because its her neck No Dont peel too thickly The tendons will stick to the skin We use those when we say ee There beneath the skin in the neck Shes hopeless Remember her spectacular speech in class Human body as being an antenna and such What a joke You want this How many times did this heart beat Seventy times a minute is times an hour So in a day Well times that Then times f or a year How many times if you live to And yet my broke after years Was anything wrong with this heart Theres something wrong in the lungs See cant get my hand in very far There are or white lumps in the liver And look at the colon This person had a colostomy Cancer of the colon can

false memories What chance do have against all those Mr Takagi Please Mr Takagi Please step back Be careful Mr Takagi Look out m confused about time What is my consciousness Is it like the story of the future robots Thats it People programmed robots with their memories After that all the humans died out robot was stranded on Mars Bef ore the end there was a huge electrical memory surge So me being here and the times when meet Ryoko its like the robot is showing me An electrical broadcast of my final moments Hiroshi Its because your memory is returning Theyre memories As f or Ryoko Well shes gone now No thats wrong They arent memories Its not as clearcut as that think No good to think too much about her And the dissection You should stop doing it No way Youve done your best But its time to give up No dont care what you say ll tell Dr Kashiwabuchi to take Ryokos body away You do that and ll kill you wanted to think you had killed her But the light had gone from her eyes long bef ore that It was when she was in high school She was fine before then Why did she lose it wonder Even we didnt know And well never know now only saw the light one other time Just after the accident It was after the operation at the local hospital Your dad suggested she be moved to the university hospital That was it She was fully conscious f or or hours It was then she mentioned leaving her body to science After she died her body should be tak en to the university hospital she told ve never seen her so serious But that wasnt easy to accept f or me No way Why should she want to inflict more wounds even after she died couldnt understand why she wanted this How could agree to that when she was still there alive in front of me Soon after that she lost consciousness vegetable according to the doctor She was moved to a private room My wif e and were beside her It f eels like a dream now Just when thought Its all over saw Ryoko sitting up in bed thought she had recovered My wif e was asleep saw the curtain at the window It was moving gently in the wind Ryoko looked so refreshed She looked out of the window Then she turned slowly to me Dont f orget my request she said She spoke as plain as day She died that same evening When shes finally laid out Put these in her coffin Its okay now You can f orget about her You must be tired too Not at all still have a long way to go yet Its not right dont care that his memory was aff ected Its not natural Its unforgivable In a way it reminds me how you were when they brought you here How could they refuse when you were so serious All the memories of you came flooding back It was frightening have to finish up now Just another minute Well All right you can take her No hold on Just another minute Why putting it off think its better that
