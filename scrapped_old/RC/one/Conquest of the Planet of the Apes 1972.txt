talking chimpanzee on Earth The child of the two talking apes Cornelius and Zira who came to us years ago out of the future and were murdered for fear that one distant day apes might dominate the

months eight years ago Every dog and cat in the world It was like a plague The disease that killed them was a virus brought back from space by an astronaut Didnt the disease affect humans We were immune And so it was discovered were simians even the smallest ones Thats how it began Humans wanting little household pets to replace the ones they had lost Then when people realized how quick they were to learn how easy to train the pets became larger and larger until now Its monstrous Now you understand why ve kept you away Yes Lisa Young Queen Falls for Mrs Riley No Lisa Yes Could you

the only safe hiding place for you is among your own kind shouldnt be long Why would you say human Human Thats a very odd thing for another human being to say didnt say human Mr Governor said inhuman Lousy inhuman bastards And by the blessed St Francis who loved all animals meant it You see run a circus We know that From years back Since the talking apes arrived on Earth and conceived a baby whose survival could have threatened the future of the human race Mr Governor understand the baby was shot dead with its parents Or so it was believed Mr MacDonald However since this morning m beginning to wonder if they shot the right baby The apes could have switched their baby with one from the zoo Or perhaps a circus Surely Mr Governor you cant be serious Hoskyns the cassette please These are the recommendations made to the then president of the United States by the chairman of the Presidential Committee And we believe that the male and female talking apes Cornelius and Zira have come to us out of the future We believe their spoken testimony that some years hence their descendants will have all but exterminated the human race from Earth And we know that the female ape is now pregnant with child The commission therefore recommends that the birth of the female apes unborn child should be prevented and that both the male and the female should be rendered incapable of begetting another But Mr Governor every zoo public and private was searched by the police and every circus including my own But a small chimpanzee was found The only one ever to be born in a circus and legally certified to have been born a month a month before the talking apes arrived on earth Where is he now wish knew ve searched everywhere Seor Armando Let me remind you of the seriousness of our problem Now Your circus travels mainly in the provinces Yes sir Then undoubtedly you are unaware of the rising tide of disobedience the outright defiance among the servant apes in our cities Mr Governor on investigation many of the offenses have been proved minor The ape killed while trying to escape from the city last night Would you call his offense minor No sir would not He physically assaulted his own master But only after what must have been severe provocation The apes body was covered with welts and bruises inflicted by a beating Which he no doubt richly deserved How many more of them out there are just like that ape All burning with resentment Or waiting Waiting for an ape with enough intelligence with enough will to lead them Waiting for an ape who can think Who can talk Seor Armando has your ape ever talked or shown any signs of being articulate in your presence Never in my presence or anyone elses You can question my circus hands We intend to Meanwhile you will remain in custody

encouraged amongst slaves Oh dont be so touchy Mr MacDonald All of us were slaves once in one sense of the word or another If you feel the apes unsatisfactory we can have him reconditioned That isnt necessary Youre quite right Mr MacDonald But not for any of your bleedingheart reasons Reconditioning Thats all any of you ever think of isnt it Dont you realize if we were to take every ape who disobeyed an order and sent him back for reconditioning Ape Management would become overcrowded Its the only thing that has any effect Just makes them worse Some of them couldnt be worse ve been

disobedient The charge against them is nonsense It will do for my purposes They constitute the hard core of our problem and m going to crush them once and for all Sir you will only further aggravate the problem This action is folly and wish to protest it in the strongest possible terms Very well Mr MacDonald Your protest has been duly noted From now on you have but one assignment to find that

understand We cannot be free until we have power How else can we achieve it Go Ah Mr MacDonald have an order from the governor to take Caesar into custody know ve been looking for him Hes not in the Command Post No Issue an order to round up all unaccompanied apes still dont see why he made a run for it Its really quite simple Mr MacDonald The ape has intelligence He knew that his friend Armando was dead He assumed the man first betrayed him under torture But we dont do that to humans Now Talk Talk Talk Talk Talk Have Ha Have pity Thats incredible Well theres your proof Were convinced Mr Governor Its fantastic Absolutely fantastic Have him say something else You heard the governor Answer We could persuade him No Hes not responsible for what he is Still seeing him there its like

Management Until theyve been rounded up by the police all citizens are requested to remain indoors further announcement will be made as soon as recapture is effected And guess here it is Ape Management is in the hands of the apes Many officials are either dead or held hostage The main band of rioting apes are at this very moment marching on the city Its been established that the ape mob is under the command of a supernormally intelligent chimpanzee who has acquired the power of speech That idiot Get out a retraction immediately Announce that the talking ape has been put to death the child of the two talking chimpanzees Cornelius and Zira who came to us from outer space years ago As such he constitutes a threat to the future of the whole human race Governor Breck has just issued this order to all civilians go to your homes Stay in your home and lock your doors Above all do not panic Repeat go to your homes Stay in your homes and lock your doors The situation can be kept under

such tools Shoot them Shoot them all This is the Communication Center We have no defense If we lose this battle thats the end of the world as we know it We will have proved ourselves inferior Weak And all the groveling cowards left alive when the battle is over will be the weakest of all This will be the end of human civilization and the world will belong to a planet of apes No No go Go Caesar Your servant Your creature Your animal But saw you die The king is dead Long live the king Tell me Breck before you die how do we differ from the dogs and cats you and your kind used to love Why did you turn us from pets into slaves Because your kind were once our ancestors Man was born of the ape And theres still an ape curled up inside of every man The beast that must be whipped into submission The savage that has to be shackled in chains You are that beast Caesar You taint us You poison our guts When When we hate you were were hating the dark side of ourselves Take him Go Caesar Caesar This is not how it was to be In your view or mine Violence prolongs hate Hate prolongs violence By what right are you spilling blood The slaves right to punish his persecutors Caesar a descendant of slaves am asking you to show humanity But was not born human know The child of the evolved apes Whose children shall rule the Earth For better or for worse Do you think it could be worse Do you think this riot will win freedom for all your kind By tomorrow By tomorrow it will be too late tiny mindless insect like the emperor moth can communicate with another over a distance of miles An emperor ape might do slightly better Slightly What you have seen here today apes on the five continents will be imitating tomorrow With knives against guns With kerosene cans against flamethrowers Where there is fire there is smoke And in that smoke from this day forward my people will crouch and conspire and plot and plan for the inevitable day of mans downfall The day when he finally and selfdestructively turns his weapons against his own kind The day of the writing in the sky when your cities lie buried under radioactive rubble When the sea is a dead sea and the land is a wasteland out of which will lead my people from their captivity And we shall build our own cities in which there will be no place for humans except to serve our ends And we shall found our own armies our own religion our own dynasty And that day is upon you now But now Now we will put away our hatred Now we will put down our weapons We have passed through the Night of the Fires And those who were our masters are now our servants And we who are not human can afford to be humane Destiny is the will of God And if it is mans destiny to be dominated it is Gods will that he be dominated with compassion and understanding So cast out your vengeance Tonight we have seen the birth of the Planet of the Apes
