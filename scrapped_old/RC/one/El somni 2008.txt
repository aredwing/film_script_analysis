communal taxes we pay for everywhere pay euros of communal taxes Well godfather here we are It took some work but we finally made it Summertime at the mountain At this rate wouldnt recommend it to anyone Back then things were different d like someone to do it but not at this rate Nobody can live like this The government doesnt understand anything because it always does the same thing When it passes a law its for all of Spain Empord is one world La Plana de Lleida is one world This is another world Pardines is another world Each sector is a world But they dont understand that They apply everything to one single world and its not all one world They dont understand Its not the same to move sheep in the mountains of Ogassa or move them in Empord Here they must be kept one way and in Pardines another Each mountain has its own way Each mountain has its own slopes When God well maybe not God but when nature made the mountains they werent designed for cows They were made for sheep So whats going on in the mountains ve never seen these thorns here before but today we have thorns thanks to the cows These paths through the mountains are all dry because of the cows Its the cows that are fucking up the mountains If they asked me what thought first thing d do is outlaw electrical lines in the mountains If they want fences theyd have to make them out wood But no electrical lines in the mountains And d love to say that to the Minister of Agriculture Why doesnt anybody do anything Because Ministers dont even know what a mountain is anyway Then dad passed away mom passed away And took charge of everything and thought Either you use machines or no had gotten married by then If you buy machines youll be more tied down If you like animals You have to choose one way or the other So chose animals When was ten wed move the lambs over there at night secretly Wed put them on our shoulders and cross through the mountains taking shortcuts so we wouldnt get caught by the police We

mess so you will sleep on the kitchen ground Some salt for the dogs omelette The dog doesnt have high blood pressure Mallorca and all those islands used to be full of whorehouses They were full of whores Here as well we used to have whorehouses But now you will not find any in the city centre Long ago Girona was full of them Nowadays it is full of hot spots outside on the roads What about those girls that were by the highway last spring Holy shit Going towards Valentis farm theres one that looks like the Virgin Mary herself Didnt they want to get them off the roads God no They must not be Why Youre out of your mind They do favours to people No young man in his right mind wants to be in the mountains all day chasing after sheep If he did no woman would ever want him What did your son do He seemed to love the tractor but found a betterjob Well good for him Get a glass of vine for you and another for Alfonso hes thirsty and finally the female goat gets hot But it takes a bit of doing And the male goat follows her And itjumps and jumps And the female donkey It doesnt allow being covered just like that Itjumps around until at least it stays still And the male donkey with a hard on this long had a great voice and was a great falsetto admire Jorge Negrette Pedro Vargas and others But of that great voice all have left is a spurt Rose of April darkskinned virgin of the mountains of Montserrat Rose of April darkskinned virgin of the mountains of Montserrat Lead us And enlighten the land of Catalonia Catalonia triumphant will once again be rich and beautiful Drive them back these people so conceited and so arrogant good blow with the sickle a good blow with the sickle Come on Lets go now All Guardia Civil are military And military are no good First of all there was not one Catalonian guy here No no Catalonians They were all The Guardia Civil were very nasty God damn them When Quico Sabat came here he was killed in St Celoni The year was in the service He came back and the entire other side was with him And they were going to blow up two towers of power stations that supplied Barcelona They were going to free Francos prisoners During the power shortage they would empty the prison But were unable to Quico was unable to do it It was an attempt Much like an attempt And thats what happened at the Twin Towers and in Madrid And now in London this summer Another slaughter And all that lead whoever took part in that fuckin war They kill everybody over there in IranIraq If what they show on television is true that war must be hell for that country That must be hell because everyone is dead there They still kill people Bush said the war was over but the war came afterwards That bastard didnt do a thing Not a thing Just spend millions on weapons and nothing else And the other countries also We are all lame on that Were all lame for sure were all lame Damn it Bush blew it there Did they ever catch that Bin Laden guy Hes the one who takes all the money under the table Hes there right next to Bush in his ranch m sure he is m sure Theyd catch him if they wanted to but They have to shut people up They have to say theyre doing something If Quei is in a good mood hell tell you all about the civil war Because Quei and old Picola were kids during the war They remember it all This little lamb is nice What will happen years from now Where will the herds go through On roads only Maybe theyll be a fire or a drought and kill it all Someone said that the last time it all ended in a fire In a fire or a flood and now it will have to end in a fire They say the world will end in about million years Will we still be alive Sure well be reincarnated People always say we never really die Do you know a cure got stuck with a bow Look at that finger It really hurts Try arnica oil Oh women Joan Theyre a lost cause Joan lost cause Joan women have become ferocious He told me that if you dont sign these bonuses theyll become part of your single pay But if you do sign them they get withdrawn and wont be part of your single pay Youd lose it And what is a single pay dont know what single pay is Its probably just one payment Years ago here in Vall del Bac wed see herds go through Theyd start at the beginning of May and end sometime in July And to get down they finished for Christmas ve got this blanket and do like that Youll be fine ll sleep like a king Do you want a pillow How about another one Okay The pillows should be high dont want a dish just a piece of bread Come on eat Eat man Take some beans had breakfast at home The bread basket the bag Well put the bag there Well put that here Since Joan Pipa is a nomadic shepherd in the Catalan Pyrenees We accompany him on his lastjourney Springtime at home Thats the end of it Thats the end of it Shouldnt you have left for the mountain today d have left today d have left today Wed have left today Do you miss the journey Of course miss it Come Cristobal Lets have dinner Summer at home Autumn at home You see Cristobal Here is where have to spend summer and winter Everything is gone as you can imagine What should do with the sheep ll have to feed them with the rake Or on the contrary sell them But no one wants any Just like this land is in bad shape other neighbours other shepherds are in the same solution Here in Catalonia well be left without land and animals You can see how rotten all this is In summertime you cant go to the mountains because the weather has ruined the grass And down here the machines are killing it all off Weve reached the conclusion that our work is over And all this is due to the train which will not benefit us at all Well see it go by and thats it But well never take the train But also understand that if they do it its for their own needs or to cover up some money They know their own reasons There was plenty of water flowing in the mountains all year long But for the last or years there isnt a drop People seem to take the climate change as a joke but its a very serious problem Its getting worse and worse Its started in the mountains but will soon reach the plains There will be neither water nor grass Moving livestock is a dead job Years ago these cattle paths were crossed by thousands of sheep but now they are crossed by thirty million cars Shepherds lost it all because they remained silent they didnt protest road was built here a motorway there another road here and the livestock paths have been destroyed And that breaks my heart have done this all my life following cattle paths from Port de la Selva to Ripolls Thats the alarm that means its time to move
