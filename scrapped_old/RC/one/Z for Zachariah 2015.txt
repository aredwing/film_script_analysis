underground in a government facility a bunker m a research engineer Well was mean like a Does that mean youre a scientist or something Yeah Oh really Wellwell was Thats cool was on the design team for that suit was wearing But its the only reason was able to survive as long as did They werent supposed to be used longterm though Its beat up now Its damaged So whyd you leave the bunker Just wasnt

That was just a girl from a long time ago really You know the reason left Honestly what think was looking for was a place like this without ever believing for a second that it could exist John never thought d eat fresh fish again Ann Oh the pond is full of them We used to get yellow bullhead from the creek but obviously they died out But this pond comes from the same water as the well does Dad says it comes from an underground pocket of water Reckons its a big part of what kept this place from dying out An aquifer Yeah Makes a lot of sense Hes a smart man Oh could eat this every every day of the week We can eat it as much as you want till the pond freezes over What happened last winter It snow a lot Yeah l stayed in the house mostly bundled up with Faro mean saved food but we went through most of it Truth is uh almost almost froze and starved Itit was bad Well thats a good reason to plant the entire field Yeah mean even if we could just get the freezers up and running we could stock up on fish just wish the generator hadnt broken you know Wait You got a generator Engines fried Its my fault lts When it stopped working was goofing around was just was was playing a Damn it just wanted to hear people talk Well dont beat yourself up This things old Looks like its been repaired a couple of times already It was liable to blow no matter what Well its too bad we cant just do like a science fair thing and just run all our clocks and everything off a potato Thats a good idea Come on Yeah thats a good flow of water We need to build a race at the top but its enough to spin a generator John As long as theres enough cable to reach the house we have power The lights might flicker but we could get the freezer going Wait it doesnt It doesnt matter that the waters radioactive

no No no no its all right Its all right Its fine Its okay its fine Ann Why would you steal our eggs Caleb m sorry maam Not everyones hospitable like yall are You say you come from miles from here Yes sir worked in the mines about three counties over near Big Sandy Creek We used to play their school in soccer John Uhhuh Like you Mr Loomis was underground when the shit hit the fan Excuse the language maam Its okay Most of the guys had families They went up looking never came back Finally ran out of food Decided to take my chances How long were you outside the mine Too long been laid up since found this hollow a few days ago You know that cave in the in the ridge back round there Oh yeah know it Yeah theres a cave in Claypole Canyon Me and my brother used to go there when we were little and build forts and things ls that right Yeah So whats your plan Hmm Gonna keep heading south Yes sir thats the idea If could stay in your land for a night ll be out of your hair by tomorrow morning Well like said you picked up some radiation figured m kind of weak Even puked a couple times How bad do you think it is John Oh its nothing like what had but you should probably rest up a couple days d appreciate that Thank you What do you think mean m not sure about the stealing thing but dont hold that against him Figures hed be cautious about how wed react So youre okay with it then Look if the guy wants to camp out for a couple of days John are we really not gonna invite him inside Amen Amen keep thinking m gonna wake up on the side of the road out there You know its funny out there d never take the main roads Always take the country trails or the railroad tracks Just scared of seeing anybody One day see this warehouse by the main road Theres some water jugs on the outside m hoping for water Readings were low When come out theres someone in my wagon Its a boy maybe maybe even years old He mustve been on the main road coming from the south was scared of going south back then dont know why The fallout was Hes the reason came this way He was sick Filthy His belly distended stealing my food Everything he put down he just was throwing up couldnt help him get him out of the wagon Hes grabbing for the door so we get into it Pulls out a knife Swinging at me weakly Thats when took out my gun Soon as he saw it he gave up Just started crying He was on his knees just begging me to kill him couldnt do anything just put him off to the side of the road and left him there to die You know how said the people worked with in the mine left and never came back Thats not really true It was me and four others They were older guys family men like said You know the first weeks down there were awful Phones were down Radio station went off one by one Started getting claustrophobic thinking everybodys plotting against you One of them Micah hes this really big dude but a gentle fellow Well he just snapped Says hes got to get out of the mine no matter what but the others wont let him Thought the radiation would leak inside if the safe room hatch was open Well he he threw himself on the others They ripped each other to shreds just using their hands In the end only Micah was left covered in blood and m sure hes gonna kill me too But just met his glance looked him back in the eye And he backed away from me Collapsed few hours later he was dead m so sorry Caleb And we keep some water here in the house if you need any tonight Easier than waking up and walking out to the well huh Yeah right Ann And up here is your room These pictures of you Yeah its me Bathroom And this is you Hmm Middle school football Man oh man d rather be in hell with my back broke than be back there again Well ll ll clear away all this stuff in the morning No dont like it like this wont be here long What are you doing What do you mean We dont know anything about this guy Could be anybody for all we know was just showing him his room John you wanted him to stay No no no no you invited him into the house You cooked him dinner You set him up down the hall from us You know what mean its not like hes a bad man Right mean You really believe that dont know what to think yet You never told me about that boy in the wagon Look dont want to dont want to talk about that okay Well wish you would Truth is dont think youd understand Why wouldnt understand lived through this too remember Know how said was gonna plant the fields back before summer actually started to and then just thought wouldnt even bother mean m sure what what you went through out there was horrible ml but it mean it wasnt wasnteasy here kept kept this calendar for the first few months after they left And then after awhile just realized it didnt it didnt matter They werent coming back Just seemed stupid stopped stopped thinking about how many days were going by just was really sick of being on my own you know just didnt want to be on my own anymore What m saying is that you come and made me want to go through it all again And not just somebody You killed him The boy think it was your brother dont know Looked like him m sorry m sorry Its okay So we got kale down there soybeans up by the house Round here theres cucumber tomato squash milk from the cows obviously and eggs and occasionally meat from the chickens She seems older than she is huh Yeah You know what you also got Turkey You hungry Mr Loomis Oh Damn it Just missed So whats your plan Early on when the radio stations were still broadcasting there was talk about a lot of people heading south Well there was plenty of old recordings hoping over and over on the Yeah we heard all those We could tell the difference No you most certainly misheard mean the ancillary fallout Especially in the South No Mr Loomis Mr Loomis its a town called Anson near the Gulf Theres no one left out there The guy on the radio said therere about three dozen all family of military You were military right Mr Loomis was a civil contractor Shh You fancy a wager on which one of us bags him All right What do we stake Ann m joking Mr Loomis For bragging rights is all So youre gonna put the platform down there Mmhmm Waters radioactive but we got the suit Put the wheel on the platform to stabilize it then we get some kind of some kind of race to divert the water into the buckets and spin it fast enough to power the generator And you know how to do all that Yeah See we dont need Anson We could be Anson Its pretty cool Mr Loomis So why havent you started building it yet Well the issue is the raw materials Ann has a sentimental attachment to her church Father was the pastor there dont know She says shes okay with it but didnt want to upset her Good shot Ann Okay whos gonna carve it Mr Loomis should He shot it All right So thats your daddys chapel Mmhmm Well hed say its Gods chapel and he just works there Mr Loomis says you have to tear it down to build his water project up Thats not what said said we didnt have to do the water project at least not right away Hmm Ann you probably want to wait Well you know rebuildings important think we should plan for it Well m confused now You sound like Mr Loomis Excuse me Its just a project Itll happen when it needs to happen okay mean we have wood coming out of our ears here with the trees and Ann theres no way to cut the trees m sure we can come up with a way to take them down Dont you think No its its not even the taking them down Its the milling them thats the problem Would you ever consider another building Maybe one not so near to her We had this conversation We had this conversation Theres not another building You want to drop it now Hmm guess the Its the only way Yeah guess so Well lets get to it then Ha Ann Yeah Sure Why not John All right Whoo Come on lift it up Mr Loomis little more Thats good saw that meant to do that No you didnt Yes did We should get a tarp At least until we know what we want to do with it Would you like to take a walk Caleb Yeah my daddy dabbled in preaching too Oh yeah think he liked the women and liquor more though went from going to church every day to never going at all But uhitll never leave you Why were you okay with taking the chapel down know why John was mean hes not religious but That church it was only holy because of what you brought to it That cant be taken down Thats a nice way of looking at it Thats the truth Thank you Do you talk about your belief with Mr Loomis No He doesnt like try to make me stop or anything Its justjust not something that we share But thats okay And what does he say about what happened out there Oh you know just You havent really talked about it Well not really no What do you think think He has a plan and all three of us are part of it somehow But it was us believers dont you think Just like this valley why it survived why you and did because we have faith What if you dont have faith You have to Not everybody does You have to Its the only way youll survive Ann Hey Look
