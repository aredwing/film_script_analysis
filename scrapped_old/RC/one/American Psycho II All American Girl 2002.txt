Clara was my babysitter was only years old naive and somewhat trusting But all that was about to change Some babysitters take you to the movies or rollerblading in the park Mine brought me on a date with a serial killer Patrick Bateman Not my idea of a romantic evening God look at her All drugged up and tied to a chair knew we should have gone to the movies At first was scared wanted to get out of there as fast as could But then something came over me As soon as was free got really pissed He was about to make a real mess of my babysitter So did what many of you would have done took matters into my own hands And it changed my life forever Is everything all right in there thought heard a crash Yes everythings fine Thanks They found Bateman and his final victim a few days later The quickly uncovered a psychopath and a few extra unsolved murders and he became an instant celebrity an overnight sensation They even wrote a book about him Only in America As for me was never tied to the scene And rather than selfdestruct or spend the rest of my life on some shrinks couch told no one of what had happened silently vowed to devote my life to stopping other psycho killers couldnt wait to grow up The next six years of my life were a blur My parents wrote me off emotionally My mom became a raging alcoholic and my dad was busy fucking the secretary Pretty clich huh So here am today attending the most renowned behavioral studies program in the nation Here they focus on profiling the art craft and science of tracking serial killers The subject matter itself attracts some weirdos Hey Rachael But then again maybe its just me The problem is dont have time for games have got to focus on my work You can do better than that Thats what your mama said And what can say Studying murder often brings out the best in people Thought you quit Getting into West Washington wasnt easy busted my ass in high school and maintained a perfect grade point average All this so could study with the best mind in the field Professor Robert Starkman Possibly the most revered hunter of serial killers the ever produced After solving every high profile crime ever thrown at him he suddenly made a startling life change and became a teacher Some say it was his last case the mysterious death of serial killer Patrick Bateman Good morning Funny how life works isnt it Good morning Starkman never discusses the

Ordinary girl know Were different But am stranger in the world Ordinary girl Ordinary Excuse me Bite me Barbie The Anthony Perkins character in Psycho was modeled on Ed Gein My heart rate nearly

think you will get the job dont think know Okay Rachael Worst case scenario you dont get the job What then What are you talking about Dr Daniels Its mine You want me to come up with some idea of whats wrong with me but will be honest came here to tell you am not coming back next week Dont worry have every intention to pay for your time However feel the problem we have connecting lies mostly with you Look this is a small town My guess is you know almost everyone here You were born here right It must be so disappointing to see all these college kids come in and out of your town every year moving on to bigger and better opportunities while you stay here year after year getting older and older And all while taking care of your dear old mom And on top of this youre divorced God The female population in this town aside from the sexy little college girls running around must be pretty weak This alone would cripple any man Your level of frustration must be through the roof deadend job with no love life all while taking care of your sick mom Just the other day noticed you were judging me Is that fair mean really is that dont think so Your life is very similar to Ed Geins Ed Gein Yes Ed Gein Very famous serial killer bachelor raised by his domineering mother until she died when he was roughly your age God he went nuts He couldnt handle the loss What would you do without your mother Okay Rachael thats enough You dont know me and dont know you We were getting to know each other These sessions are a process So dont go jumping to conclusions No am not jumping to any conclusions here If you just open up your eyes youd see am already there Have a good day Doctor Lets talk about Ted Bundy for a minute shall we What kind of a killer was he How was he perceived Mr Lawson wishes to participate Please lets hear it He was perceived as a very organized killer Very calculated Hmphf You dont agree Miss Newman Yes and no Come on this guy planned each and every detail in advance He chose his victims with extreme accuracy stalked them meticulously and waited for the precise moment to attack All while maintaining an air of patience not even the s greatest could penetrate No offense sir None taken But still dont agree And he picked all his dumping sites with the outmost caution He was unquestionably an organized killer Premeditated with a capital Capital Its a letter in the alphabet Between and You have something to say Miss Newman He started out organized but spiraled down late in his socalled career He began to keep bodies for days washing their hair and even applying makeup before disposing of them And he littered the dumping sites with evidence using the outmost caution However his last victim and his youngest girl ever fell out of his typical victim selection She was chosen out of sheer availability The sheer need to kill He was both an organized killer and offthecharts lunatic With a capital Youre right He was both Very impressive Miss Newman Now Professor Starkman how would you classify a killer whose downward spiral was actually calculated into their grand scheme Thats a very interesting hypothesis Miss Newman Unfortunately in this class we stick to the facts And theres no known casestudy of that nature Keiths little display of brainpower was totally unacceptable Its a day before Starkman announces his new This could be catastrophic wasnt about to watch years of hard work go down the drain It was time to pick Keiths brain You know that feeling you get when you realize that there are people out there just like you It almost makes you feel normal All this time thought he was taking notes But no Look at his work his sketches Theyre absolutely brilliant This may be a waste of a rare mind But a girls got to do what a girls got to do Hi Professor Starkman Hey Miss Brown How are you Good So the big days tomorrow right What do you mean For the position Youre announcing it tomorrow Yes of course At noon in my classroom cant wait My chances are much better this year than they were last would think so Its a very tight race this year Mmmhmm Were you looking for Cassandra She wasnt in class She probably left for Spring Break Well

leave a quickie and will get back to you Hello Eric for Gods sakes Shes dead Who is She is The she whose name we agreed not to say aloud My patient Dead How She hung herself You didnt say she was suicidal She had suicidal tendencies but was more concerned for the sociopathic and homicidal patterns that were emerging Spare me your psychobabble bullshit This girl she may have been a little forward but she wasnt crazy am sorry but you didnt see what saw She was not a pretty picture Listen Eric spent a lot of time with her and have to say dont agree on this one There are tons of kids in your classes How could you know her as well as you think you did Were bound by the guidelines of doctorpatient privilege right You didnt Bob You werent sleeping with her No wonder she was obsessing

identified Rachael Newmans killing spree is believed to have begun Wednesday evening with the murder of Gertrude Fleck The body of Cassandra Blair was found hanging in her Brian Leeds body from the Leeds family Keith Lawson was The bodies of a West Washington security guards were found within hours Once a typical girl Rachael Newmans death leaves many questions unanswered The most burning question of all Why As a casestudy Rachael Newman was as rare as they come She was more obsessed than Dahmer she was more calculating than Bundy and certainly more faceless than Bateman In a perfect world shed still be alive But for her it all ended in a blaze of fire in which she and her final victim a friend of mine Robert Starkman they burned to death wish had a chance to study her mind more but all we ended up with were dental records All in all she killed eight people Eight people which we know of Rachael Newman is one in a billion One in a billion Shes in a league of her own But she will remain a constant and strong reminder that people arent always what they seem to be Thanks for taking the time to come out Thank you for coming Doctor Its a pleasure Who should make it out to
