okay too Times up Okay So long Eleanor Goodbye Blackie Everybody rise The prosecution will proceed Your Honor District Attorney Wade intended to make the closing address himself but as you know he is in the midst of his campaign for governor He apparently has been delayed We expect him any minute Well the court sees no reason why politics should be permitted to hinder or delay the conduct of such an important case The prosecution will proceed With or without Mr Wade Just a moment please Your Honor What a break for us shall insist on starting without Wade Sit down Well wait But itll gives us a chance to Chance my eye As far as youre concerned this trial is over ll hand you one thing though youve been licked by the best Now keep your eyes open and learn something Your Honor Gentlemen of the jury ve started beg the courts pardon for this unfortunate delay We were about to proceed without you Mr Wade Hereafter trust you will not again allow your political activities to cause delay trust not Your Honor Class its written all over him Class Your Honor Gentlemen theres very little more that can say to you The state has tried Blackie Gallagher for the murder of Richard Snow The defense was quick to point out as their only defense that we could establish no clear indisputable motive for the crime Well gentlemen murder without motive seems to be the fashion of the day And it is just this vicious practice which we must stamp out For years men and women in this country tolerated racketeers and murderers Because of their own hatred of prohibition they felt in sympathy with those who broke a law they felt to be oppressive Crime and criminals became popular Killers became heroes But gentlemen prohibition has gone and these gangsters and killers who came with it must go with it The defense has pointed out Snows shady character has indicated his large number of personal enemies concur with their opinion found it necessary myself to dismiss him from public office But Richard Snow was a man killed by another man The law makes no distinctions Murder cannot go unpunished Our testimony against Blackie Gallagher could not have been more complete if we had had an eyewitness to the murder We have proved that he was practically caught in the act You have heard a fake blind beggar testify He heard the shot and saw Gallagher come out of the room in which he had been alone with Snow There is conflicting testimony from various parties at the Garden that night But Gallaghers own party is the only one to insist that he did not leave his box We have eight witnesses to the fact that he did Gentlemen in finding Blackie Gallagher guilty of murder we are faced with more than the avenging of one death We are faced with the choice which we must make Either we can surrender to an epidemic of crime and violence which will destroy our homes and our community or we can give warning to the host of other gangsters and murderers that they are through In when the General Slocum burned made a boyish effort to save Blackie Gallaghers life Today demand from you his death Gentlemen of the jury you are instructed that the defendant is under the laws of the State of New York presumed to be innocent of the crime with which he is charged Who Oh yeah until he is proven guilty to your satisfaction by competent evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt This presumption remains with the defendant throughout the trial And unless you are satisfied that he is guilty of the crime charged and this beyond any reasonable doubt then you must acquit him of the charge reasonable doubt is such a doubt as a man of reasonable intelligence can give some good reason for entertaining if he is called upon to do so Is he coming Have you heard from him havent heard a word Not a word Weve been waiting more than half an hour outside Mr Wade the district attorneys office wants you on the phone right away Hello This is Wade The jury just came in on the Blackie Gallagher case Verdict

conviction of your own friend Certainly more than any other governor in the history of this state you Your Excellency can afford in this case to be merciful No one can be more conscious than am of my present position here It has troubled me more deeply than it could anyone else The men and women of this state elected me partly because was instrumental in the sentencing of Blackie Gallagher to the

wouldnt even let me tell you He thought that if you knew youd ruin your own chances of being elected Do you realize what this means It means that if it werent for Blackie Gallagher you wouldnt be

What Goodbye Blackie So long Jim Hey hey dont be silly This way out Governor There he goes Theyre giving it to him Quiet Ladies and gentlemen quiet please quiet His Excellency the Governor Mr Speaker ladies and gentlemen of the Assembly and the Senate joint session of your two bodies called by me as governor of the state is an unusual procedure It is necessitated by unusual circumstances few nights ago as you all know Edward Gallagher was put to death in the electric chair at Sing Sing for the crime of murder What you do not know is that he committed the murder to silence scandal about me which very likely would have cost my election to the governorship The scandal is now unimportant But what is important is that when learned of what Gallagher had done for me let my affection for him blind me in my sworn duty to the people of this state offered him a commutation of his death sentence The fact that he refused my offer is no mitigation of my offense My election was won with murder and have proven myself unworthy of my trust And can do nothing less than tender you my resignation as governor of the State of New York No Governor No No No No Hello Jim Hello Eleanor Jim owe you an apology once said didnt think you were honest with yourself That you couldnt apply your rules of conduct to yourself Today you proved how wrong was What are you going to do now dont know Try again maybe something else May try with you
