Aesthetic deprivation and so on Right Bravo How do you come up with interesting ideas every week Did you really like it It was good Its not about wealth and poverty Poverty existed in the past too If you only have three olives you can place them nicely on a plate or gobble them out of the plastic bag know what you mean told you we went to the hodjas You know our tenant Yes If you saw how filthy it was how messy Did you go in No mean the garden Theyve ruined it woman lives there too but you wouldnt think so First of all you are a man of God You should be a model to your community Shouldnt you be neat and tidy Who is he Do know him No you wouldnt An old tenant from back in my fathers day d walk past him in the street Just a crooked shabby guy dont know Shouldnt men of God be a model to the public Especially in rural areas Perhaps should write about that next week The very thought of him gets on my nerves Of course write about anything you want But Wouldnt it be better to write for a bigger paper instead of a local one nobody reads Then at least it would be worth all your efforts dont feel m making any efforts mean hear you typing away in front of your computer all week Thats why If you didnt bring me that paper wouldnt even know it existed Thats what mean Frankly dont give a damn about big papers My kingdom may be small but at least m the king there mean whos going to read this paper Whos going to buy it dont agree with you my dear Necla On the contrary Sometimes receive letters from my readers that prove to me m on the right path Even my efforts as you say feel more than worth it Take yesterday Yes but sometimes on the Internet some awful writers get praised to high heaven Everyone has their fans somehow Thats why think one shouldnt take such praise so seriously mean that shouldnt be your reference Anyway keep on writing Dont let me distract you ll just lie down here In silence The mud makes driving up here hard Why dont you lay some gravel The tourists like it this way its more natural didnt say asphalt said gravel Thats natural too With gravel half the tourists wouldnt come Very few clients in winter in fact Wouldnt be worth it Of course nobody comes with this mud Dont want everyone here anyway just want those who value a natural setting Fancy a sprint Fine Good Ready Yes Were off Did you put on weight What You put on weight What weight man My

if Nihals your daughter Come on m not that bad What about that mass suicide around your hairline then Its no big deal but You know that village Garip near your farm Yes but ve never been Whatever girl from the public education office wrote to me dont usually care much for that kind of thing But for some reason was touched Maybe m just getting old wanted to ask you whether should take it seriously Whats she after donation Nothing much the main thing is Come in Fatma couldnt make out if shes sincere or after something else Being a good judge of character youll easily see whats what from the letter wanted to ask you Where shall put your tea On the tables fine Where is the letter On the computer Read it out then Right listen Thanks Fatma Nihal loves charity like this Should we call her as well Go ahead If you like We should shouldnt we Yes dont know if shes free Nihal Suavis here were discussing something was wondering if youre free to join us We need your opinion Yes were in my study Alright dear Shes coming Good Mr Suavi how are you Fine thanks and you Fine thank you Its been a long time Are you doing m fine No problems dont leave the farm anyway What problems could there be How are your activities doing As usual The same old routine But tell me whats your secret for looking younger and more beautiful every time Thats very kind of you Thanks very much How is your daughter Does she come to visit Well you know She came once when she graduated And when we lost her mother That was it really Shes still in London Yes Why dont you join her Why stay here all alone Me Heaven forbid cant stand that English husband saying Oh lovely to everything Just dont talk like that So let me tell Nihal was saying to Suavi got a letter the other day young girl who teaches needlecraft in a local village In short shes asking for help m not sure how to respond so thought d ask you two What kind of help does she want Actually the letter is here Shall read it Sure Go ahead Alright then will Let me see Yes here it is Dear Mr Aydin would like you to know that am a great admirer of you and your articles m always eager to read your weekly column in our local paper Voice of the Steppe impatient to benefit from your vast experience and courageous ideas We the teachers at the Technical School for Girls are proud that our town has such a valued citizen Blah blah we can skip all this Yes lets continue from there We a group of teachers wanted to build a small building in Garip one of the areas poorest villages to teach crafts and writing to the women of the village The mukhtar helped as much as he could However despite all our efforts our resources ran out with the work not finished We applied for support to the municipality but we were rejected We have been left helpless all alone in the middle of this steppe with all our good intentions and hopes While we sat disheartened seeking a solution suddenly remembered your article Flowers of the Steppes It felt as if you were describing us Me and my friends read that article again in tears Believe me my intention is not emotional blackmail want you to know that would never feel ashamed to bow in front of a good person like you to beg for help for the unfortunate people of these arid steppes where am proud to be born ll be brief Since we heard about your connections with the wealthy people of the region and the administration and we know you are well connected even as far away as Istanbul we wanted to tell you of our situation We would like to thank you however you respond Yours sincerely So well Thats it dont know She appears to be a wellintentioned decent intelligent girl Clearly an idealist bold and courageous Seems like she deserves some support What do you think Nihal Frankly it didnt sound to me very get this every day from all over What exactly didnt sound right to you Well Isnt it a bit of a luxury to build a new place just for this Its a tiny village after all Normally the mukhtar gives a space for these things You decorate it a bit and you manage So felt it sounded a bit too much Even the municipality refused to help them Well have a hard time finding common sense in municipal decisions Well dont know And you Suavi really dont know Dont you think you and and a few other local worthies could get together Dear Aydin do really look like a worthy My belly is my only worthy feature and its now independent However must say you surprised me Nihal Why Well Because thanks to you this hotel has been run like a charity for years What are you trying to say Well When a chronic philanthropist who has helped almost every school in the area opposes this idea so firmly fail to understand What is there to understand Its a matter of urgency There are primary schools with leaky roofs and rotten windows Little kids studying with their gloves on Isnt it more logical to solve these problems first Weve been collecting donations for this for a long time now But it never attracted your attention So dont understand your sudden charity Anyway m expecting guests have to go Mr Suavi could you come and see me for a minute before you leave Sure ll drop by Then wont say goodbye See you shortly You know what All this poverty and hardship is like a natural disaster In a sense its the will of God You cant oppose destiny But God also gave us intelligence to fight such things Thats true Thats true however there are people specially created for such tasks You should leave these tasks to them Youre a creative man You are an artist Why bother yourself with such things Stick to your own work Mr Aydin Hamdi is here Whos Hamdi Hamdi hodja the imam Fine was leaving anyway Stay a little bit more have loads of work to do Loads of work to do on the farm ll show Suavi out Bring Hamdi hodja in here Alright Welcome Hamdi hodja Thank you Mr Aydin You couldve kept your shoes on Its not that clean No Mr Aydin My shoes got muddy Its better like this Some slippers then No m fine Hold on The floor is very cold in here Fatma bring me a pair of slippers And some tea and cookies Take a seat Hamdi hodja Yes Hamdi hodja m listening To tell you the truth dont know where to begin When you came the other day it was a bit Sorry just a minute Its a bit stuffy in here If you dont mind ll open a window Yes Honestly dont know how to put it It was embarrassing for us m sorry but we didnt mean badly of course The kid made a mistake because he was upset by what happened But hes just a kid after all Of course he is But have you asked him why he did it After all the incident could have had quite serious consequences Yes of course asked him And what did he say Well Mr Aydin the kid was upset by the debt collector so he went and did such a stupid thing Especially seeing his father get beaten up Beaten up When the debt collectors came Ismail tried to stop them obviously And the police were there So things got out of hand see So our car paid the price right More or less Mr Aydin apologize But now the boy feels really bad about it He wants to come over and kiss your hand for forgiveness No No need for that He regrets it Really But as said the other day we always pay our debts actually have some money now So came to pay for the car window How much was it It doesnt matter Sort it out with Hidayet dont know much about it think it was liras or something But its best you talk with Hidayet liras liras for just one window Thats right And it is not the brandname one If it had been Hidayet can show you the bill Well m not sure if have enough on me Let me just ask Hidayet how much it was Its no big deal Theres no rush After all its just a window You think so In that case d better not pay in installments ll pay it all in one go then Just to prevent any confusion Hello You there Nothing just wanted to ask how much the window cost remember you saying liras Really got it wrong then alright Fine no problem Never mind was wrong Its not liras But how come Thats how much it cost Hidayet can show you the bill forgot to ask if he took a bill though Thats strange Its just a window Really strange There must be some mistake surely Whats this Are there no mens slippers No we dont use any at the hotel Fatma had these at home No worries these will do As long as they keep the cold off Where shall put the tea Here Let me move this Hamdi hodja come here Thank you Now Hamdi listen ve got various houses and shops in town Not just mine actually Theyre my sister Neclas too If tried to look after them all myself d have no time to work on my book and articles See what mean So let Hidayet and the lawyers deal with the rent and lawsuits often dont even know what theyre doing And if they tell me tend to forget The other day your younger or older brother Older He said some inappropriate things But insist not to mention the debt collectors wasnt even aware you were my tenants When the rent is not paid lawyers do these things automatically Understand Of course Mr Aydin Its obvious You have to do these things Youve been very patient with us But since Ismail came out of prison he hasnt sorted himself out yet Nobody gives him a job dont see why not but they dont Thats why we need time to get back on our feet So Mr Aydin if you could just step in to stop the eviction We will sort something out as soon as possible We really dont want to lose the house spent my entire childhood in that house So if you could give us more time What do you expect me to say see your point but you need to discuss it with Hidayet dont know anything about it Did you talk to him No Talk to Hidayet mean Theres Hidayet and the lawyers You dont need to come to me They know more about it Dont come to me again dont want to mislead you In a country with a Muslim population dont the people deserve men of God who are cultivated neat whose very presence is reassuring The weekly sermon prepared by our imams from their reading will be heard with pleasure and admiration and will elevate the people Islam is a religion of civilization and high culture Hows that Fine Its not too harsh No Nothing that might be misunderstood No You dont say anything about religion itself You talk about the practices of those who apply it And also say Islam is a religion of high culture Of course dont really care for these things But you know its delicate But the guy annoys me so much cant stop myself writing So he managed to become the subject of an article With his shabbiness slyness vagueness You know once played an imam in a play and got good reviews Now when see him tend to think wasnt that good missed so many details Did you see that play Sorry Which play The one where played an imam Wounded Birds Cant remember He comes running out in the first scene bursting for the toilet It must have been when was abroad He comes running on Wheres the loo No Was it a comedy Yes And first dont remember want to ask you something Not resisting evil What does that mean to you What Not resisting evil said What do you think that means Not resisting evil How do you understand it Well One day thieves attack you and you dont resist suppose thats it dont want an example Give me a logical definition wonder if there is any logic in it logical definition of not resisting evil Not resisting evil is to remain indifferent to incidents defined as evil within an ethical framework Hows that For instance if we were to make this idea of not resisting evil the basis of our behavior what kind of life would we have What kind of life What would it be like Thieves murderers psychos would prosper Chaos would reign everywhere What would be left then Left Cripples and madhouses How should know Maybe youre right But couldnt take the easy way out like you What easy way out Maybe you should think about it You went a bit too fast didnt Its simple Someone does wrong you dont resist Thats it What else is there still feel were fooling ourselves when were fighting evil As if we didnt want to look at every aspect we hide some Like what Fatma this honey is frozen You got another ll check If not just put it in warm water Instead of struggling against evil why not do the exact opposite Say you dont want a painting to be stolen Its maybe better to hand it to the thief Maybe its a better solution Say want to marry an heiress because her father is rich To foil my sneaky plot she should throw herself in my arms Is that it But maybe he would be ashamed feel remorse and admit his fault Shouldnt we allow for that What a ridiculous idea Should we allow mass murders because some killers could regret it Even soaps dont produce such nonsense Well dont care what you think have my solution see no reason to resist an evil act aimed at me personally Does someone want to kill me Be my guest Because if were to defend myself that wouldnt make the murderer a better person But if you defend yourself you may not die Isnt that worth it Trust me it isnt Lets drop it feel depressed already What do you think Nihal To be honest dont quite grasp it Where does this need come from Why do you feel like this Its not a need just an idea She wants to help evil get done Hold on Is that how you want to end evil in the world Or do you want to find peace that way She wants to help the baddies do bad more comfortably m just saying we should give evildoers a chance to feel regret chance for the bad guys great You pretend not to understand Thats how understood it sweetie How did you manage that sweetie Shes saying evildoers regret it if you help them do it No Thats what understand How can you understand that So how do you understand it It is very clear what shes saying If someone does me harm a thief or someone dont resist and by doing so stir his conscience Stop it Whats got into you two this morning Whats this about helping evildoers do evil Who said that Is that how you plan to end evil Youre trying to provoke us now m just saying what understood Am wrong Its easy to understand She says if something bad is done to us by not resisting the evildoer may be sorry and give up Is that possible Thats not the question m just saying one could try So the Jews should deport themselves So that Hitler doesnt get tired Hed say Here they are no point gassing them You joking No Thats what understand Help evildoers do evil so they stop doing evil Never heard such nonsense before misunderstand or you arent making yourself clear enough Mr Aydin theyre here again Who Hamdi What Hamdi Hamdi hodja Yes Hes here Yes hes upstairs What for He already came the other day dont know he wont say Hes acting all mysterious Not him not now Did you tell him m here Of course not said d see If he wants to leave something you take it He came yesterday too He didnt leave anything Yesterday too Yes Why didnt you tell me We talked about it You were in bed You had me say you werent in Really That boy is here too What boy The window one He was here yesterday too begin to smell trouble Why not speak to him Theyve come all that way Whats so frightening Nothing Its not that my dear But hes whiney annoying never finishes a sentence But theyre here now We cant send them away Alright Let them in Lets see what hes after ll do it your way to see if got you right Hamdis coming ll say yes to everything he wants But he has done no evil to you Maybe he will We dont know why hes here yet But wont protest Evil or good lets see knife in his pocket Who knows Come in Hamdi hodja welcome Welcome Mr Hamdi Thank you Sorry for disturbing you during breakfast Youre not disturbing us at all Would you like some breakfast Thank you madam Were not hungry Please have a seat Fatma some tea for our guests And cookies for the boy The valley is muddy m sorry were covered in mud Why were you in the valley Which way did you take We took the shortcut saw two figures over there Was that you Probably Really You walked all the way from town Yes we did Why Its quite a long way Yes its far It is Isnt it Did you walk the last time too mean yesterday Yes My goodness Why didnt you say so Hidayet could have given you a lift back feel sorry now No need to apologize Its like exercise for us Dont worry Aydin show them a seat Fatma bring my tea over there Please have a seat You dont even have a moped ll get one when things start looking up That would be great God willing Luckily the house is next to the mosque Five round trips a day would have been hard God bless you Is he your son He looks like you No Hes my nephew My brothers son dont have any children Struggling to make ends meet couldnt get married My fate guess You will eventually Youre still young But Ilyas is like a son to me Of course Which class are you in Ilyas Speak up son which grade Fifth Mr Aydin m off to the industrial zone What for To get the car door fixed Whats so urgent about it Nothing But the engine too is making a noise What noise kind of zheeee Could be the cylinders dont want to ruin the engine Alright go Mr Aydin as said before after that incident the boy felt terribly sorry Which incident That stone he threw Thats over and done with mean the poor boy feels so bad hes been all upset and worried ever since Now Mr Aydin apologizing is not easy As for repentance its a matter of maturity But while theres still resentment one cant feel truly at peace Our Prophet said Repentance is penitence If a person convinces you that theyre really sorry then we have no choice except to forgive them Thats how it is And our Ilyas is such a smart and goldenhearted boy that young as he is he listened to me He thought about it and agreed Thats why he wanted to come today to kiss your hand said That would be the right thing my boy Youll see show regret and Mr Aydin will surely forgive you Right Its really not necessary It doesnt matter at all Of course its necessary Otherwise hell get away with what hes done Thats the biggest danger Ilyas Isnt that right my dear dont like getting my hand kissed My father never allowed it either Wed struggle to kiss his hand Wouldnt we Necla No He cant find real peace then Isnt that so dear Come on now son kiss Mr Aydins hand Ilyas Didnt we say wed go and do this without telling your dad Dont embarrass me in front of everyone Come on son Kiss Mr Aydins hand Fine then Ilyas come on Mr Aydin is waiting Dont pull keep it loose Pull now Let it rest a bit Dont get too close Wasabi Oh my God Brings tears to your eyes doesnt it In Japan also hot is beautiful You dont eat that in Japan When was a child didnt like it But just now love wasabi Oh its freezing m chilled to the bone What are you doing Not much Wheres Aydin No idea Must have gone into town Hes not in his room No he isnt ll make more coffee Want some Coffee said want some Yes ll have one dont know what to do with the new maid Nihal She put glasses love in the dishwasher Two got smashed know she told me Theyre obviously too thin for the dishwasher They broke m thinking of taking it out of her wages to teach her Thats a bit much Forget it m not exaggerating There are things you love and value bought them in Istanbul You cant get them anymore know but theyre just glasses Maybe youre right dont know No maybe youre right m aware m a bit nervy lately Its because worry too much Worry about what Theres so much going around in my head My ex has become a real alcoholic Who Necdet Yes But he always drank a lot didnt he He did indeed but hes been drinking much more since we separated He starts the minute he gets up But theres nothing you can do about that know but sometimes cant help thinking were worse off after splitting up Him over there in that state me here miserable Is that what you really think Well Maybe m just trying to figure out where went wrong What did that made us end up like this But if youve still found nothing years later maybe its not your fault at all Dont you agree You want me to join the herd that believes all badness comes from others No But it still doesnt have to be your mistake Thats what m saying Why do you never want to think like that Because dont see any good in it sensible person should only be interested in her own share of guilt see no harm in some selfdeception to protect yourself But well Where do you think youre wrong dont know but m just saying it as an example If d overlooked all the evil stuff Necdet did to me if hadnt resisted if hadnt divorced him say If could have made him face his own evil side dont know wonder what wouldve happened if had acted differently You mean if you hadnt resisted all the bad things he did he wouldve finally felt ashamed Yes Yes Exactly You put it well know it sounds absurd but it isnt believe me Sorry Necla but find it hard to believe People dont change that much after a certain age On the contrary all their bad habits get even worse So remaining silent in the face of evil does nothing but make the other feel even more justified think he regrets it now too Thats why say this feel it If he could find an excuse hed come here right away If were living somewhere else hed definitely do that But after all that happened he is a bit scared of Aydin now But you know what sometimes feel like Going and asking him for forgiveness Necdet Yes But you did nothing wrong Precisely In fact thats the beauty of it Making the other really ashamed And in this way maybe bringing out the good in him Necla have you been watching too many soap operas recently What do you mean Such things only happen there Theres nothing to say Its your decision think its utter nonsense but if thats what you want to do nobody is going to stop you You can do what you like But then youre the one who has to face the consequences Keep that in mind too Thats how see it Those petty multiplemeaning sarcastic words and those little cynical lip movements realize now how sick am of it how much hate it Necla youre going too far Please The real reason d apologize to Necdet is maybe to get away from all of you and all of this Its pretty clear now Nobody is going to stop me Of course not dont need anybodys permission for that This is my fathers house too ll stay or go as please Besides ve already paid the price for telling the truth to your face price none of you has paid Isnt that Omar Sharif What The photo Its Omar Sharif Yes They shot a movie here At this hotel No mean in this area Hes such a humble man Hed take a picture with anybody Really Yes You dont expect that of a big star But hes not like that What film was it cant remember dont want to mislead you Hello What was the movie Omar Sharif shot here Monsieur Ibrahim Thats it ve heard about it Where exactly did they shoot it Around here In Ishtar and other places Ishtar Yes Interesting Lets see where it is Where is everybody You mean Mrs Nihal and Necla They were here a minute ago Doing what Talking Here in the lobby Really went out and when came back theyd left Were they talking normally What do you mean normally Whatever Would you like some tea Please Could you make us some tea Ishtar is very near Right opposite Akky No found it Its kilometers away Well done you know better than us No dont What do you do mean whats your job Are you a guide No m not explore Isnt a motorbike hard in winter The harder it is the better we like it Whos we Motocross bikers see did something like that in my student days Really Hitchhiked across Europe with friends When the going got tough we hopped on a train Those were the days Sleeping wherever we ended up The world was our oyster It felt like life would never end Full of the energy of youth dont care much for hitchhiking need to be more selfsufficient should always have the gear to get by Thats why a bike suits me better So you check into a hotel for the night have a tent and stuff but didnt want to pitch it here This place is a bit like a cave and natural like a tent And also had some stuff to write Really What are you writing My experiences Like a travel journal There are travel notes as well Lets call them essays Soon to be published as a book Really Thats good m writing a book too Really It will be a serious thick book History of Turkish Theatre There is no serious study on the topic Unfortunately So m doing research Theres loads to read Old documents articles books and so on ve nearly finished all have to do now is start writing Getting started is half the job Thats true You used to be an actor believe Thats right That explains your topic Yes thats right prefer the term thespiar though Acting has fallen from grace a little lately was on stage for years And am proud to say never did any soap operas Despite some very attractive offers remember something Omar Sharif told me When we met he learned was an actor He gave me this look and said Acting is all about honesty It really is Awesome By the way we got a horse Really Can ride it now Not yet It has to settle in a few days How long will you be staying Here Yes Dont know havent decided yet live from day to day dont plan ahead much Otherwise its not a real journey anymore You lose the sense of adventure How can put it The way a wellplanned life doesnt feel like a real life As the saying goes life passes by while were busy making plans True Very true Werent you going to the market with Fatma told Fatma to go didnt feel like it Have you finished the book lent you while ago So What did you think Worth translating No dont think its worth the bother If m not interrupting can ask you something Of course But please nothing about not resisting evil found a good source should finish this and send it quick Judging from your excitement you struck gold Not really Its a sequel to my previous article It aroused lots of interest Really Yes So Vehbi said He said the paper got abusive phone calls You know Vehbi He loves to exaggerate reactions to make his paper look influential The article wasnt provocative agree but m not so sure Why do you get involved in such things in the first place Youre an actor Write what you know about But dear Necla often you dont choose what you write In a sense the subject chooses you Of course everyone has the right to talk or write about what they like But you have to accept that the product will match its maker Meaning mean there will be a big difference between the views of a lifelong expert and an amateurs But cant an outsider sometimes see things more clearly Frankly not in this case Which case Let me put it like this The other day carefully read that article you gave me Then couldnt stop and read some others And probably hadnt paid enough attention before but they felt quite different this time Different in what sense dont know Has Nihal read them No dont think so She doesnt care much for my articles Shouldnt a wife read what her husband writes dont know Should she Maybe she reads them in secret believe she does Shes an expert at criticizing by remaining silent dont believe shed be objective enough anyway Whatever So Well honestly probably couldnt be so daring About what mean Pontificating in a column on matters dont know much about Pontificating see you found my articles worse than thought No m not saying theyre bad Its something else Something else Like what mean theyre like Mediocre Bloodless cant find the right term Harmless Is that what you mean dont know Maybe Your words are sweeter than honey today m trying to be realistic Well bravo what else can say If you want can stop being realistic Too late The genie is out of the bottle Well if you ask for opinions you have to face the consequences What can say Thats true In the old days we admired you We thought youd do great things become quite famous even But it didnt happen The elephant gave birth to a mouse Sorry to disappoint you Thats obviously not your fault Its us who set the bar so high So should feel comforted What about Flowers of the Steppes What did you think of it To be honest thats the article that actually made me think like this Really In what way How can put it This soppy romanticism This nave unconvincing selfbelief Takes no risks for one thing It looks like the writer adopts positive values accepted by all just to endear himself Sometimes the disguise of lyricism makes it stink of sentimentality You really are annoyed must confess dont like this style much If what you say is true should just quit writing No dear This is just my point of view Luckily not everybody thinks like you Naturally Who are they see youre curious No Its just because you mentioned it havent offended you have Not at all Are you sure Maybe a little writer can be very sensitive regarding his work But dont worry can handle it But dear youre not coming up with coherent constructive criticism Like your remarks are always hiding something Thats whats annoying So get to thinking its me you hate not the articles Thats absurd But thats the case And of course weve become very different now We must accept that We see things life itself quite differently Thats probably natural The older you get the more particular rigid you get After a while it seems normal you dont like them Thats maybe how it should be In fact this might even be something should be pleased about You see Anyway dont want to go into it any further Its incredible how you always float to the surface like olive oil You find a way to justify yourself as usual Necla please can we drop it You wanted to ask me something when you came in Its done No What were you going to ask The subject of the article youve just sent No it wasnt that Yes thats what it was Religion morals this and that Nothing of your interest Now see You found a victim and youre making the most of it Stop harassing the poor man Necla m losing my temper What does it have to do with it should ask what religion faith spirituality have to do with you Have you ever set foot in a mosque Have you ever prayed so that you can talk about it Do have to go to a mosque to write about religion How absurd is that You keep saying the imams feet stink Whats it to you The man walked km in this cold And he had to enter the room with those feet What exactly are you trying to say You know damn well what m saying No dont Then let me explain find it insincere to talk about spirituality when you havent shed a single tear on your parents grave and never even visited them There are ways of crying you dont know Mrs Necla Fine alright Go on then wish my threshold of selfdeception was as low as yours Then could easily find things worth doing and escape this boredom perhaps dont understand how you dont get fed up harping on like that Applying yourself being persistent is a precondition to penetrating deeper and creating new things Second what boredom are you talking about ve never had a spare second to feel bored And in the present circumstances believe boredom is quite a luxury So it wasnt a luxury in the past and now it is Fine ll put it like this Boredom is always a luxury Happy We are so different we have such opposite souls Its hard to believe were related Thats normal Siblings are never alike If one is hardworking the other is lazy One is clever the other is a fool One is sociable the other introverted Thats just how it is So So its normal cant believe how left a place like Istanbul and agreed to come and live with you My souls withering here feel at home wherever my room and my books are feel no need for another place You must be able to create a world for yourself find an occupation Youre bored because you sit around doing nothing Youve really let yourself go You used to do translations You stopped even that Of course youre bored We must work have a passion You know what they say an idle life is far from honor and honesty It depends on how you define working It doesnt mean running around pointlessly So what does it mean People who think a lot are actually more active than the others Even if they dont do anything So you mean youre busy thinking Maybe dont know what to do ve no passion to give me direction But then what do you do You waste your best years with things that are irrelevant to you Are you not tired of tinkering uselessly like an alchemist Seeing you like this depresses me Necla what are you raving about for Gods sake You having a bad night or what The more try to humor you the harsher you get Calm down Come on please m not surprised you got divorced after all these years No man would put up with this sharp tongue of yours It takes one to know one so true What do you mean Well Who are we talking about Your other half Youre becoming both the same You have to get at Nihal too right know what you two think of me But dont care These are my own thoughts nothing to do with Nihal She walks around like she was a guardian angel but in reality she doesnt do shit Glaring at people with that contemptuous look Are we now guilty because you do nothing Do something Nobodys stopping you Charitys now what they call showing off in this house The salvation ritual of a woman whos never earned her living God knows what salvation What do you want her to do Philanthropy isnt tossing a bone to a hungry dog Its sharing it when youre just as hungry Everybody does what he can how he can Whats wrong with that Ask yourself what you get from this kind of work Youre not listening Whats that got to do with it Others found what youre digging for in that hole years ago Stop flogging a dead horse Its a waste of time Nothing new will come of it So you tell me then What is new You are the man of ideas not me cant teach you m interested in the universal even if it might not seem new For Gods sake Aydin Be realistic for once Please Just this once Look whos talking about realism Dealing with art struggling for peoples spiritual development is alchemy you say No dear what m saying is this If all you thinkers thought about solving the big problems all this trivia you fuss about now would solve itself in the process If you go up in a balloon to see a town youll incidentally see the trees rivers and meadows too But no you focus on one tiny spot Lazy cowardly conservative Were in an endless cycle again We dont have to agree Why do we keep arguing You know what your problem is In order not to suffer you prefer to fool yourself Yes thats it But one has to have the courage to face the truth If youre looking for something more real youll have to be destructive when necessary dear Aydin But since youre an actor you forgot about being real being yourself You jump from one personality to another just like a grasshopper But theres something called living with yourself So you want me to be realistic Alright listen then Youre a person sentenced to Ioneliness and boredom for life Because youre a coward because youre lazy Me Yes Youre used to living like a parasite expecting everyone to help you You act as if the whole world owes you something Easy calm down m calm Whatever you do whatever you say you expect indulgence You think thats possible Thats certainly not what want Where do you get such ideas Youre not realistic yourself without being aware of it Me Yes Wonderful swear every time you come through that door find myself praying you wont say something irritating While you sit silently behind me feel your gaze on my back seeking trouble just to escape boredom My back goes numb ve got unsuspected powers Its as if somebody is rubbing his calloused hand on my back feel cold inside cant write Aydin what are you saying Do you always have to be that irritating Youre angry Look this drives everybody away No husband no friend nobody Youre left all alone Am wrong Is that realistic enough or shall continue Yes that was a very personal realism Youre right Thinking more important than action There we go The ageold excuse of cowards and slackers Are you counting on that Marvelous tirade Hi Hello How are you m alright thanks How are you m fine thank you want to check out Just now Oh really Because we want to

meeting So In this meeting well try to finalize months of effort So ll have to ask you to leave us alone Discuss whatever you like Are you hiding something from me Its not a matter of secrecy But Nihal dont you think youre being a bit impolite Why impolite All m saying is that this is a private meeting Nobody in this country would believe it Men everywhere but the husband banned Dont be ridiculous There are women inside And some more will come But with you around things get complicated thats all You stick your nose into everything Just let us do things our own way If organized a meeting like this and you came in d never treat you like this really dont get it Its beyond my understanding Weve been working for a year now You never showed the slightest interest and you show up at the end m the one who doesnt get what youre after m not after anything d have soon got it and left anyway What makes me angry is your nerve to actually tell me this didnt say it in front of people asked you to come here and m asking you nicely What else can do dont know But know very well that d never do such a thing to you Thats for sure Playing the old scenes over again cant stand it Alright then Have it your way ll leave you can stay Whats up m leaving So soon When youve got to go youve got to go There might be black ice Could be dangerous dont mind We love danger Awesome So where are

journey Thank you Dont forget us Nihal am disturbing you Dont hide it wont look just wanted to ask something Then ask Aydin heard you raised funds last night Is that true Yes we did So what Why didnt you tell me Did have to You didnt have to but d have appreciated it might have wanted to make a significant contribution dont think its a good idea Were doing fine on our own We dont need you thanks Come on One always needs more After all m a wealthy man Whats more natural than helping an educational project But nobody expects anything from you From you neither darling Yet you created a huge committee in our house without me knowing Didnt you Listen to me Aydin please Weve lived in peace for two years each to his own affairs Whats suddenly changed Yesterday your aim was to humiliate me and the guests Think didnt notice Me Never even crossed my mind Come on for Gods sake was so angry couldnt sleep last night If we start fighting and quarreling again like we used to then its clear cant stay here Is that a threat Why would threaten you m just saying what could happen say you left Where would you go Wherever could dont know d go to Istanbul Find a job and work Nihal my darling You havent got tired of banging the same old drum for years As if m keeping you here by force ve never stopped you have Go whenever you like Maybe you should Try it Find a job with the minimum wage From to After work you can go on saving the world if you have energy left ll do it if necessary Much better than wasting my life living like a parasite with an arrogant man like you Thanks to you m drifting in vain here m sponging off you spend your money But pay for it with my freedom and my useless loyalty Do you know how donating even a little of someone elses money feels No dont And why Because ve worked like a dog all my life not to know couldnt enjoy my childhood or youth Too much of an easy life thats your trouble You have no idea what gratitude means Besides m asking you Stop these secret meetings and gatherings at my house only allow close acquaintances into my house If that lot want to do charity work they should find somewhere else Nobody can come here yelling away in the middle of the night wont allow it And that bum of a teacher doesnt give a damn The school needs this or that His real aim is to trap bored neurotics like you Why dont you understand me Nihal Why are you being unfair swear my only intention when showed up was to help you support you Please leave me alone Aydin m begging you Lets stay away from each other for a while You go or me Or lets break up dont know why all the shouting m going anyway made this decision some time ago m off to Istanbul for a while have things to do for my book too But have doubts about your donations campaign find it very important cant leave before sorting it out So please lets just sit And talk calmly like two civilized people Come on please Nihal m asking you kindly Come and sit here Come on Nihal will you come over here Nihal darling Its obvious you started such an organization because of your love of people and your conscientiousness m not looking for a conspiracy In fact will support you all the way Although respect your intelligence and your feelings especially your feelings cant allow such a tricky business which could cause us big problems we cant predict now to be ruined at the hands of you and those rascals However pure your intentions Remember The road to hell is paved with good intentions For a start youve no experience You know nothing of life Youre too impetuous You are easily deceived You trust people instantly Youve gathered all these strange assistants around you This is very dangerous business Nihal To tell you the truth under these conditions any efforts will lead to two bad outcomes First nothing gets done for the schools Second youll lose a fortune because of all the shoddy work And your name will be stained One can say the money doesnt matter can cover it But what about your name our name Once things get out of hand you cant imagine all the gossip Theyll all accuse us of embezzling the donations And youll suddenly be all alone Theyll all vanish And well get blamed Just get to the point My point is this was glad you were collecting donations But to be honest was worried too You need more than enthusiasm in this kind of affair So felt the urge to step in so we dont have problems in the future The urge Yes Otherwise d have gone to Istanbul But cant until sort this out This is a risky business Nihal Its not a game There have been all these fraud cases recently and all the new laws Do you know them Get to the point What do you want want to see all the donations and expenditures And the list of your helpers am sure theyre trustworthy but better safe than sorry Are you serious Nihal lets be reasonable please Dont you trust my experience and my honesty m still not sure what youre after What could be after What could possibly be after m just trying to prevent any problems for my family have the right dont Now Let me see the donations and your expenses Itll take me a minute to spot any problems just want to see your situation have nothing to hide Anyone can look There they are take a look These m sorry but dont understand any of this Dont you have a table showing donations We have the signed documents Nihal dearest Its obvious you havent a clue How is that possible How come you dont have a chart showing everything at once You should also have a copy of the receipts for donations Do you have them No For money or goods in kind you have to prepare an invoice or receipt Have they been issued dont think so But all this is very important Very important What if they want to deduct the donation from taxes Or if they try to dodge taxes Youd get blamed and end up in jail Sorry but these are very important details Another thing Receipts should be numbered and listed separately Has that been done dont think so Never mind ll start doing that to save you worrying Yes do so Do as you wish Alright Then lets do it like this Let me take this pile of books and papers to my study have some software ll run them through ll let you know my thoughts once ve had a good look Is this part of it too Alright Are you sure thats it If theres more let me take it Take them Take them all Dont leave anything That was all had left in life You can have them too Take everything have Dear Nihal why are you talking like that Take them all Take them they can all be yours Take these too Here Take them What are you doing Oh my dear Nihal Youre acting like a child What can say When you understand how important this is youll come and thank me Wait and see Nihal listen Here are all your documents back didnt look at them much Because ve changed my mind m not going to get involved stick my nose in To tell the truth felt a little bit lazy have enough work already So you do whatever suits you In the meantime m leaving tomorrow ve decided to go At least till the end of winter The hotels never too busy in winter Hidayet is here Tomorrow m going to Istanbul Nihal cut it out for Gods sake said m leaving what more do you want Your altruism brings tears to my eyes Do you remember You once told me that if could change some of my behavior you would forgive me completely Remember Which means for you m guilty of something Therefore calmly and briefly in terms can understand ask you to tell me what m guilty of m too tired cant talk now Later maybe What kind of guilt is that What have done to you Is that youre young beautiful and would like to live your life m much older than you and you hate me for that Is that my guilt didnt force you to marry me never restricted your freedom You live as you wish independently in your part of the house You have even set up a huge committee here If you want even more freedom its yours No ones stopping you mean it If you want a divorce wont stop you either dont want anything like that Of course wanted to marry you Its not that m young and youre old or could love someone else if was free always felt m older than you anyway But youre an unbearable man You are selfish spiteful cynical Thats what youre guilty of Possible Maybe m like that dont know At least can admit my mistakes from time to time But ve never once seen you take the blame for anything Am wrong If you intend to nag all night should let you know dont have the strength to answer back anymore dont want to nag at all But have to ask again need to know What am guilty of What kind of guilt is it What have done to you True Youre actually a welleducated honest fair and conscientious man Generally you are like that wont deny it But you sometimes use these virtues to suffocate people to crush and humiliate them Your high principles make you hate the whole world You hate believers because for you believing is a sign of underdevelopment and ignorance But you also hate nonbelievers for their lack of faith or ideals You dislike the old for being conservative bigots and not thinking freely And you dislike the young for thinking freely and abandoning the traditions You defend the virtues of community But you suspect everyone of being a thief or a bandit so you hate the people too You hate practically everybody Just once d like you to defend something that might cost you and have feelings that dont benefit yourself But thats not possible In the past you stopped us splitting up using various methods Well maybe it worked both ways was too young to leave didnt have the courage or the money Or anywhere better to go But didnt you feel any remorse seeing a young healthy proud lively woman wither away in emptiness boredom and fear felt fear in our first years Now feel ashamed My best years have been wasted shed all my good qualities to struggle with you ve become tough coarse timid and suspicious What else can say m not even sure could express anything But our paths have now parted even if its under one roof We should each go our own way We couldve had a better life But its too late now You wouldnt know but people like me who grew up in villages with not even electricity understand the joy and pleasure of being in a small warm cosy room like this listening to my wifes voice even if she is screaming in my face how bad am Our youth was very dull Nihal We didnt know how to be happy So we may not know how to make others happy But as said we had no bad intentions We set out with good intentions pure innocent dreams We wanted a better life and society Sorry but dont believe you ve heard it all before Youre not on stage anymore We all start with good intentions But as you said the road to hell is paved with good intentions So all this means nothing All these fine words sound ridiculous to me now When you start talking like this feel like youre pulling trick number two to get your way Yet ve never understood what you really want from me Even so ll ask you one more time Whatever you call my activity selfdeception or feminine logic leave me alone Because this is my only consolation spent my entire youth fighting with you Now thanks to this work believe in myself again have found a meaning to my dull life here purpose that makes me feel proud So at least allow me that Nihal darling Youre a goodhearted smart rational sensible woman Everything you say and do is very reasonable It really is But not seeing a man for what he is idolizing him like a god and then being mad at him because hes not a god Do you think thats fair wish were the successful charismatic actor you dreamed of But am not m a simple man And whats worse d like to stay that way Anyway m leaving in the morning Dont worry wont be back before spring But give me that list so can make a small donation Do as you please dont care The list is there write what you want signed it an anonymous donor And left the money here Alright hope things turn out as youd like Do as you want And dont forget m there if you need any help But beware of that teacher He looked like the sneaky scheming type to me can smell his kind a mile away suggest you work with people who are conscientious principled and have moral sense One day youll understand better Conscience Morals Ideals principles The purpose of life Youre always saying these words The words you always use to humiliate hurt or denigrate someone But if you ask me if someone uses these words this much hes the one to suspect Anyway m tired d like to sleep if you dont mind Necla Go on Should we check again before we set off called already No flights but the trains are running Are you sure just called them The train is running Dont worry Fine Lets get going then Hello The Istanbul train is running isnt it No problem Its on its way Any

Aydins father Mr Sami So now we have three rooms This is my room It gets a bit colder than the other rooms But we built a fireplace for when it gets very cold Fortunately not this year Thats right Mr Hamdi d like to ask you something please Please do Mr Ismail your younger brother Older brother Sorry What exactly does he do He hasnt worked for some time He used to work at the mine in Tozlu But unfortunately he got into some trouble He was in prison for six months And hasnt worked since If you dont mind me asking why was he jailed What did he do God knows this is very embarrassing d rather you didnt know us like this But wont hide something known to God Everyone probably knows anyway few louts in town were pestering his wife Sevda We only found this out later One night a loud noise woke us Ismail had stormed out of bed to chase someone in the street m ashamed to say they were stealing Sevdas underwear off the line Ismail couldnt catch anybody But he took it out on Sevda The poor girl didnt even know Next day in the market a few of the louts laughed at Ismail Ismail pulled out a knife and stabbed one of them Thats why he served six months in jail Well Ismail was always wild He was never really close to anyone But when he got out he became even more suspicious and wild He even stopped speaking to people And then they fired him He became more introverted and started drinking He doesnt drink at home though So hes not working now We had to pay for the guys operation and compensation And our debts grew With only my salary and Ismail not working it got difficult We couldnt pay the rent Mr Aydin is right of course We couldnt pay for a few months causing him problems But hopefully ll find a second job understand hope it all works out actually came to talk about something related wont take too much of your time Its already late Please take this and accept it What is this Open it What is this Mrs Nihal Please dont misunderstand want to give you this money Please take it Yes but dont understand mean what is it for Why did you bring it to us Dont worry dont want anything in return And dont expect you to pay it back Think of it as help from a friend and please accept it m terribly sorry Mrs Nihal really dont know what to say But this is a huge amount of money How can accept this Theres enough to buy a house What would people think Mr Hamdi No one needs to know This can stay between you and me Welcome Thank you Sorry for disturbing you so late Not at all Mrs Nihal is Mr Aydins wife our landlord know They just told me Whats up Ismail why dont you come and sit down Come have a seat Mrs Nihal was worried about Ilyas She came to wish him good health Thats why she came Whats this Mrs Nihal brought that money to give us Very kind of her For what reason Please dont get me wrong No special reason thought you might need it and so you could get your stuff back What does Mr Aydin say about it He doesnt know He doesnt need to know either Good But all this money isnt it a bit too much On what basis What made you think of this much Look didnt think anything Sorry apologize Hes surprised too Ismael why not go and wash your face or something No need Then ll get you a coffee You better have one Mrs Nihal let me get you another tea This one has gone cold Dont bother Please Sevda Now Lets see if the math is right Now if this amount is for little Ilyas who risked his life to mend his fathers broken pride And if this is for selfsacrificing brother Hamdi who had to go handkissing because he looks after people And if this is for the drunkard father Ismail who got beaten up in front of his son disgracing himself and his family Theres still some left If that is for our heroine Mrs Nihal who tries to ease her conscience by doling out charity to those less fortunate than her then this money is just enough You got the sums right truly kind thought but you forgot something Mrs Nihal The person in front of you is a filthy drunkard incapable of appreciating all your kindness m now looking at these m looking And m thinking man this isnt a life Its a fire scene in a stage act No fucking life its something else True very true Am wrong Right We have to stand straight Well keep standing standing upright Well say Come on hit me here Hit me here Well stand straight as befits a man We wont bend cry Wont sob like a baby Stand upright Thats what befits us Mr Aydin There are certain moral values and beliefs today They derived from religions which have already been rejected by many people in the world If reject the basis of such values why live a life based on them Our life would be a lie then Either support the foundation of these values or consolidate or create new ones Suavi my brother then youll have to create them Its great if you can create mate But listen We want to live life to the full but other people can criticize you for that You clash you collide with them when your paths cross But curious innovative people with strong personalities do it different Oddly enough this conflict nourishes them In a way it stretches them Conflicts expand their minds and feed their creativity Now when look at them they ignore the critics because they have courage Thats the way we should be They could come to us and say You drink all that wine stuff your faces then talk about helping the schools of the poor say we should ignore it and move forward For example after the earthquake six years ago when you didnt open your hotel to victims but to aid organizations maybe to line your pockets mean thats what some people might think Thats quite interesting what he says Or they might reproach you for being wellheeled They might Hold on Just a minute Whats that got to do with it How did you bring this up m giving an example Are you trying to imply something If we didnt allow victims in there was obviously a good reason Its easy to make unfounded allegations with no knowledge Hundreds of people came from abroad Where were they supposed to stay Where were they to stay Who was supposed to save people under the rubble didnt deny that Nobody thinks about that It was just an example Come on these judgments you make dont suit you Mr Blent Whos judging was saying Thats no good maybe didnt express myself right meant something else Levent you said it wrong didnt There is some truth in what you said but you expressed it badly m just saying these people exist Whats your example got to do with my case just said people could talk like that And another thing hold on m saying the same thing Theres no counting the donations ve made over the

himself But still cant get rid of the sarcasm and snide remarks Is it fair just because weve got money All m saying is there are people like that They exist God damn them d say God damn them too but judging like that is unacceptable before understanding all this failed to express myself call for some morality some conscience please Speak up son Tell him you put it wrong Whats that got to do with it Its irrelevant Its not what he meant dont see what its got to do with morality and conscience No cant accept such a judgment Implicating him is a problem Look ve been silent for years My words come out before my thoughts If had shut up Is it fair to accuse me just because we have a few bucks Did create this world Thats how the system is This is how God created it What can do about it Justice
