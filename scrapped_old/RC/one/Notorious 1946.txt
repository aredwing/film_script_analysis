across the ocean very soon You can expect many strange things See a good movie this afternoon Eric No was disappointed Hmm must have been a comedy You know Eric loves to go to the movies to cry Hes very sentimental It takes nearly as long to go from the city to the airport as it does to cross over the Atlantic m afraid gentlemen that something must be done about Emil dont know It was an understandable slip The man was tired No It was a very dangerous slip Its not the first one There have been several other lapses before Therell be more if we permit them Thats bad Thats very bad think gentlemen you can leave it to me to find some way When you drive up to Petropolis the road winds quite a bit It is very high There are some very awkward turns m sure will not have any difficulty in getting Emil to give me a lift in his car Its quite a trick to jump clear ll just have to be careful that is all Turned my ankle the last time Madame says will you join the others or will you take your coffee in here Oh think well take coffee in here Emil m very sorry gentlemen to make such an exhibition Ah nonsense We all have nerves You have been overworking Dont you think so Rossner You need a rest Your health is very important to us Oh thats very considerate am very tired So now think perhaps ifif youll make my pardon to the ladies Alex for my leaving so early then Maybe Emil it would be better if came with you think that perhaps if you try to drive yourself all the way up to Petropolis it might be too much for you shall drive you No That would be too much for you All that way Thats too much to ask Nonsense d love to go Come on Emil Good night gentlemen Good night Alex hope youll feel better in the morning Emil Thank you And m very sorry to make a scene before strangers Very sorry Thank you Alex for an excellent dinner And please tell your mother for me that the dessert was superb Miss Huberman has been gone a long time Mother is it necessary for you to always address
