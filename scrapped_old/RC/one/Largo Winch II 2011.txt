Youre an angel My leg barely hurts anymore One last drop Thanks What if Nazatchov were simply the financier of the operation What if someone else were hiding behind him To dream up a plot like that

was vengeance Hatred My son was a lobbyist for Nerio Thomas Thomas Jung He used my personal contacts to help the Group win new markets and concessions Nerio never balked at paying bribes Thats what Pandora was for Each time he won a contract Nerio paid my son Thomas a commission But all that money went to his head He wanted more and more When saw you for the first time so young so handsome and rich so completely alive was approaching death but you gave me a reason to live Vengeance Nazatchov is an idiot He merely obeys and pays Tonight you shall kill Prosecutor Francken The only person who can prove your innocence Give him another shot There are more vials in the car Do what tell you Sugar Here Call the police fast Alexandre Dont do it did the same begged Nerio to save my son All he had
