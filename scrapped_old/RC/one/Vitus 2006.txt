Great No wonder a lot of people would rather do without a hearing aid and give up some quality of life instead of carrying a snailshell behind their ears You know that we generate percent of our turnover with these snails l know that but if Phonaxis wants to become a global player Young people should wear our hearing aids as fashion items then Maybe in fluorescent colours Yes thats exactly what l think We have to beat the competition which isnt sleeping either with highly intelligent and pretty hearing computers That means Dont hide your hearing aid but show it off And present it like jewellery On the table you can see my prototypes The CatEar and the BatEar The design might need a few changes but this is all about the idea isnt it Sounds like you want to lead the project yourself Thats exactly what l think Why should l believe in you You even dropped out of university Because otherwise lll go to the competition Thanks for the presentation Youll be hearing from us The other day
