said there was too much bad in this world He took a bullet put it in his gun spun the chamber and then took it in turns clicking it at each of us until he finally blew the back of his head off with the final click Understand this There is nothing on this earth that frightens me now Nothing l have to go shouldnt have come here Who are you Let me go apologise for my undignified behaviour but sometimes its hard to get a drink around here was only a kid when l hitched up with Herod He singled me out because was a little smarter a little faster than most First completely fearless man l met and he wanted me to be the same as him We used to go revenue collecting along the border the two of us like some families go on picnics We were down in Nogales taking the bank and walked out to a street of federal soldiers and got shot up so bad This padre hid us in his mission tended our wounds fed us talked to us both for hours When we were strong enough to head home Herod told me to shoot him When said no he put a gun to the back of my head and started to count down from So l killed the priest It doesnt matter what l do now m already damned know that Dont go down that road You dont have to become like me Why did you call me up here Well l wanted to ask you one simple question Who brought you here to fight me Mr Herod m just a gentleman adventurer moseying into town for the
