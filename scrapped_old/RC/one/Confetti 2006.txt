afternoon Three weddings Its easy All you have to do is hold up a card and say Ten out of ten or Nil points We were going to do another Bride of the Year competition but we thought that would just end up being given to a woman in a white dress again So we thought wed do The Most Original Wedding as an idea Were giving away a house to the couple with the most original wedding Not everyone wants to

fucking loved it didnt you You love the train You know she was tremendously pretty We could partner her up with somebody else Well what we had in mind was a kind of ancient Roman wedding Great It starts with the sacrifice of a pig at the brides house Fuck me But maybe with some hairstyle around it and prescription lens Oh Next Get out If we were producing a sort of updated version of The Joy of Sex you two would be perfect Naturists or The Joy of Sex The Joy of Sex are betterlooking but the naturists Well its more Its more Confetti Well dont want them at all d rather have the Romans Thats as may be Naturists tennis musicals Our submission was accepted and our submission by the way we should probably say is musicals musical wedding Hollywood musicals Thats what were going for The idea that we picked is its in the style of the sort of Busby Berkeley so its a big kind of production number Were having the sort of bridesmaids as the chorus girls You know they have the sweeping kind of staircase of bridesmaids in those films and Jen my sister obviously shell be bridesmaid of honor wont she Absolutely Shes away at the moment Shes a dancer Shes in Bahrain with a cruise She travels around a lot we dont always know where she is Erm work in a care home for the elderly Sam comes along sometimes and helps out She sings for them lovely m slightly tonedeaf but Matts always said if

Tennis Yeah Whoo Come on Josef mean we are gonna win If youre listening losers the other people in the competition give it up Stop Stop now cos were gonna win Its not about how good our wedding is its

what again Serve so you can miss it Jesus is uh exceptionally an exceptionally mediocre coach Oh well my name is Jesus and m from Spain Um Yup Thats the difficulties of my name cos its also called Jesus mean if anyone goes around calling himself Jesus frankly its a bit sad There must be a deep well of insecurity in there will hurt if they getting married because think he is not the appropriate man for her Yeah thats character mean she needs more love she needs more smiling and she needs a little bit more of sweetness Back Its really helping And front Dont stop think this is good Whats good

Whos he No thats a painting by Botticelli Oh sorry And it just You said nature It explores some of the themes of nature Youve got these apples pears and things and the elements blowing on her and

walk in and take their clothes off Arent they Yes You think we should allow that If thats what they want Good think that too If they want to do that they should be allowed to do that To ask them to get married in you know clothed is contrary to everything we believe in So yes they must be naked people as they get married because thats who they are Right Lovely So Musical Musicals The King And Oh its not The King And Why does it have to be The King And i King And this King And that It offers so much designwise Its East meets West theres a fantastic opportunity for food there you know can can

Imagine youre the congregation and were Right And were sort of looking that way What Lets give them a chance You never know The parade of the ball boys On they come Go Go Oof And then from the back come your gigantic balls All the way down on the tramlines hm Right And then you perform your vows Then youre married And thats the start What do you think Thats not We need to speak to someone professional mean you move beautifully both of you but we need someone who knows what theyre doing Properly Well With um ball boys and ball girls dont we Yeah So a choreographer We think that the choreographer really should be the remit of the wedding couple We cant have the choreographer cos theyve got one Well because their dance is sort of key central to their Its central to ours ve worked a lot on it Right before you guys came in was working on the moves She does dancing saw that thought youd injured yourself Yeah whatever whatever We need a We asked for Ahem The problem Oh for fucks sake its Jesus Can you get rid of him Get rid of him Um have to explain something We must win this competition Theres no question of if but or maybe we have to win it We are in severe financial What are you doing invited him along Can you go away No invited him here want him to go want him to stay want him to go Listen speak nice to her Shes going to be your wife No can you go Whats it like being

got won this ten years ago Hold this Come on hold it Look at me Hnngh Come on Come on Josef gimme that Thats it Hello there Gregory how you doing All right Hello Sam how are you Hi hi This is Jen my sister Oh hello Nice to meet you So if you two lovebirds would like to flutter down with me Do you want to come as well Jens coming as well Jens really interested Jens a professional choreographer Professional dancer and choreographer choreographer Shed like to Shes going to be choreographing the show Oh ve got loads of ideas cos ve done loads You know ve been dancing for years so ve got loads of ideas worked out Were sorry about the other lady but Jen really wants to do it Well we have the best dance choreographer in the country You do realize that was just explaining Well we were just explaining m actually a professional choreographer Oh really So weve kind of come up with a few ideas Yeah And what were kind of thinking is weve kind of got it wrapped up really mean can show you a few m not quite sure what the ideas are originally m a bit new to this Well shall Can you explain what it is Cos dont know that it is all wrapped up yet Its like the theme that weve gone after right is a kind of s and s musical Right Fred Astaire and all that Exactly Exactly Whos the water woman Oh its sort of like an Esther Williams style Oh right yes With hundreds of girls and all of that Obviously a smaller version of that mean its like You know just might as well hop up Jens worked some moves out Right Two rows of girls Is she allowed on the stage Busby Berkeley all the tinfoil dresses And then its like out the next girl out the next girl out On the other side simultaneously all at the same time out next girl out next girl out Jen And then Matt and Sam can sink down and you know like the dream ballet in Oklahoma Dream Laurey comes out me same costume wig So m Sam Jen You know it just gives you an idea we do stuff like it on the ships all the time If shed like to do it then thats fine You dont need me She is not Do you like What do you think about the dream ballet Cos Sam you know physical dyslexia and that shes going to be all nervous What Sorry Well Sams got physical dyslexia Whats that Well shes like clumsy Clumsy She cant dance No of course she can dance We did a lot of dancing as kids mean did a lot of dancing think its great that weve got Jen here cos she can play a really strong role in this but really feel that weve got Jenny here who is an expert in choreography as opposed to a dancer and we should be using her like we said Shes done cruise ships for years Cruise ships exactly Who works out all the dances She does Right Whos a professional dancer She is And this choreographers not All she wants to do is help her sister on her wedding day Something wrong with that But this isnt just an ordinary wedding Weve entered a competition Weve got to abide by the rules Its her wedding day Yeah and its my wedding day as well Its my important day as well ll be your sister Have you thought of that Jesus every night know youre stressed and tired and youve been getting up really You know know youre working hard and and m totally amazed m about to get married in a competition Of course m stressed But youre being so lovely and youre really putting your heart and soul into it Yeah for you And know that But they dont know that Yeah but they should know it Why dont they know it Yeah because theyve not met Theyve not met me ve lived with your flippin mum for nine months They will see it they will Christ All m saying is that you need to go and be a bit Do a bit of diplomacy Oh yeah will You know But love you and m completely with you and m totally day by day m just amazed at how wonderful you are And and m so pleased to be marrying you come down the aisle youre waiting at the altar in your top hat and tails with Snoopy you know doing the sway whatever come down you know shuffling down the aisle whatever In time hopefully And then meet you at the altar The other question that m worried about as well is whos going to take me down there What about your dad dont You know m not sure if hes gonna be there to be honest At the moment it doesnt look like hell be there Why Well because hes obviously havent invited him Mum hasnt Do you not want him d like him to be there but obviously m not in a position to To invite your dad to your wedding m not in a position to m not in a position to to do that You do want him there dont you All right your dad being at your wedding is more important than anything else Or that your family being at your wedding is more important than getting the song right think your mums going to have to lump it for four hours of her life Feel this bit Thats it Out And run to each other and round And turn out And back Hold his face Not quite like that Should hold Wheres Snoopys bit Wheres We havent done any of the music Its not all it cant be this surely you know Cos weve got a thing La la Not that its bigger Snoop can do that bit can do the twiddly bit Thats er not good But That mean thought that could be the big Thats great Steel its called Steel Still ill Steel Theres lots But whats it got to do with the wedding Shining Is that what you think am m a girl on the cover of a porno magazine With a steel tongue Is that what youre saying No m not saying that m saying er Youre saying its nomothetic Yeah yeah good idea It makes me sick Our relationship makes you sick No no Well Snoopy if you sing that song at our wedding thats what it sounds like m not m saying everyone elses relationships normal nomothetic This is There is no nomothetic What does pedantic mean Thats the Snoopy thats an interesting question but its not the time to work it out here Snoopy can do the lyrics Were going to have Snoopy has a vital part to play in this wedding theres no doubt about that He is Matts best friend and hes musically talented and hes going to be there But this will be their dream wedding and am prepared to kill or maim for them to have that wedding Do you understand me Out you come my honey Bless look at that Oh shes looking a bit ragged actually She didnt quite make the journey Now which way are we round Were all moving around now its like Dunsinane like the idea Kind of Midsummer Nights Dream That kind of thing Fairies Midsummer Nights Dream They arrive Wheres the couple There think theyre hiding Theyre hiding Well theyre not going to be naked Well this is the problem Its tricky convincing them m not interested in convincing them This is what we need for our front cover We cant have nude people Vivien Theyre not going to be on the front cover cos theyre not gonna win think we all know that Well they may do Well they may not Dont write them off cos theyve got no clothes on What about having a little bush if youll pardon the language a bush area that covers the Well we had thought bush How elegant is that going to be Well if its If the topiary is done properly think it could be rather lovely Well theyre wearing gave you an agenda Agenda is no nudes To begin with the dance is very formal Then more country Suddenly bright lights Whats that rumble The rumble of something What What it is is the arrival of your camper van And inside you are the queen of the fairies Me Oberonlike as the king of the fairies emerge from the camper van The green man guides them comforts them And he is of course our green manregistrar And youre married Well just think that completely sucks mean that whole thing is rubbish mean this is our wedding We cant be prancing around like berks We have a little problem here that think we ought to share with you That is that our brief if you like is that your naturist wedding must not be naked And thats come right from the top really have to apologize chose these people And it was after lunch they were the best of a bad lot d had a couple of glasses of wine and think ve made an error of judgment All right we just need to deal with it now yeah We just need to get them in a dress We do We absolutely do Lovely to see you Come on in This gentleman is James Thursk Hes our lawyer And he sorts things out believe weve got some sorting out to do today Yeah Well er weve been talking and the problem is that we were asked for an idea for an original wedding and our idea was a naturist wedding and we found out recently that this is going to be a naturist wedding featuring no nudity Mr Thursk You cant really expect anyone to put naked people on the cover of a magazine if they win m talking about our wedding Dont put us on the cover And as naturists we know that you cant be a bit naked Youre either naked or youre not Youre not naked now you seem comfortable enough Is that some kind of challenge All right fine dont think Michael hardly think its appropriate This isnt going to help Youre naked or youre not Stop it there please Were trying to have a civilized discussion m having a civilized discussion can still have a civilized discussion whether m dressed or not Hes becoming impossible to live with m going to stay here until we write a new contract that says that we can have the wedding that you said that we can have ve got to tell you now thats just not going to happen We cannot put out a magazine with people in it naked m sorry we simply cannot do it Well uh That is the end of it Yeah guess that is the end of it What we do after that Mr Collier Joanna maybe if you just wore a wedding dress m not even sure that want to get married This is not what dreamt of since was a little girl It is not becoming what wanted for a wedding He sleeps in the kitchen at the moment What if you dressed yourself up to allure him Maybe youve just been naked too much Maybe youve become immune to each other Being so naked the whole time youve got used to your bodies Theres no sort of magic James Yes Theres something very romantic about a wedding dress Well if can just start by simply explaining why were here and what its all about Were here today to talk about what it means to actually be getting married Theres not really much to talk about mean you know felt that what we were going to do was have a naturist wedding and that would involve people acting like naturists aka being naked Its not aka And Apparently not everybody feels the same way Including the person was hoping to marry have expressed a Not just a madeup problem but a real issue with me is that being naked in front of nonnaturists is not as easy keep saying nobodys going to laugh Your body is the most eloquent expression of how beautiful you are Get it into your thick head how much respect you If we take thick out for the moment there were some very nice words there Right We can pop one out and put another one in Lets take thick out then Lets take thick out Good Good Could you could you Are you ready to shuffle up a bit yet on the settee Well done Lovely The wedding planners are not giving us the same service They get a choreographer Were not allowed a choreographer Next Next point Well she had a makeover at the wedding fair before we made a fuss and got Isabelle one You did make a fuss Theyre getting resources that we are not Theyre getting Is it rigged Oh please Is it rigged mean Just tell us because we Absolutely not Well it doesnt seem like that from where were sitting m the chair of the judging panel ve got the casting vote It will not be fixed You have the casting vote Yes So what are you uh what do you w What are you looking for So Isabelle Lets have a look at your nose Shall Yes please Can you look in the mirror So love that nose What see in your nose is that the dorsum here the bridge is a little bit too wide and too flat The nose a little bit too short and is pointing up too much And when look at you see inside your nostrils And personally dont like that Yeah Have to check what that countrys called dont think its that Thats really all ve got at the moment just think thats beautiful Here we go So voil Thats your basic set as it were Er your wedding area Dark innit Itll be lit Obviously its not just this dark Here its peopled with as you described to us before about maybe a little canopy of people dont know what you think It just looks so dark dont like it But itll be lit Is the floor going to be black m saying itll be lit You dont want black walls and a black floor These are star lights all around here Do you No Star lights like little stars dont care Thats a black floor and its not right for a wedding Thats my opinion It makes it easier for you to stand out in whatever in your white or what thought was using a color just dont like the sound of it Well carry on Thank you Cheers Carry on dont like it at all Matt What if Few flowers or something Looks like a morgue Flowers dont exist in this theme Yeah Busby Berkeley was not full of flowers What are you doing Its about angles Geometrics Art Deco Shapes bodies of Shes nodding She knows What are the lights for The great thing
