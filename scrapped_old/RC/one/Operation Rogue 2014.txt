metro Manila area One of those targets is this weekends CounterTerrorism Conference Wont the American be present there sir Yes he will Along with a lot of other very important people in the same field Right now we have no credible intelligence as to his plan of attack Consequently it is imperative that you guys bring in both Nassif and Malek alive for questioning dont want any loose cannons out
