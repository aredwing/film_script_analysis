When was in high school got a job as a busboy at this place in the village Dantes caf But that was uh that was a big big thing for me made some money and got my first camera and could watch all the people There was this very beautiful model who started coming in her name was Ashley Montgomery would save her used cigarettes with that perfect lipstick smudge faintest trace of her perfume on them

surprisingly happy together And this one night when um when Simon didnt come home got worried But didnt call the police because knew Simon would be pissed if did Three days went by and it was pretty clear then that something was wrong Look Caroline if the police cant figure out how or why Simon died honestly dont think can But you found that little girl Dont people tell you all kinds of things Honestly found that little girl by mistake It was random luck didnt deserve any credit for that Mostly people tell me stories never press them They just tell me cause they want to be known You seem to

building where Simons body had been found Excuse me east th street was now just a vacant lot And it held no answers to the questions that were troubling me Did Simon die in the rubble or was he in the building before it was demolished And if he was in the building why And how did he get in there if he didnt have the key In the building next door the super Luis didnt have anything to add since the investigation months ago Any reason you can think of why the victim might have a key Sure Lots of reasons Its a big city Thank you for your time With my nagging guilt growing needed some time to think this whole thing over told myself d never see Caroline again And yet when she called told her d meet her for lunch Well dont feel guilty You know Porter m actually kind of alone have Charlie but cant

who Simon was m going to need you to understand this Simon was very unhappy all of his life He was always Searching for the truth On each of these video cards is some truth that he was proud to have captured And if he wasnt happy with it he would throw it out He used to treat these like original film in a camera He would never reuse or copy them He likes them being completely individual as a single source of the truth Okay So which do we watch first m not staying m sorry ve seen them all so many times its exhausting ll let them know up front that youll be here a while Okay Thank you

someone with less than her usual skill Malpractice suits are the ruin of many good doctors Yes yes Thats what youll find motivating Youre famous for your investigative skills You found the little girl

our last time Yes last night Did you think of me when you were with her Yes mean think of me not just cause you felt guilty Yeah mean you were fucking her but actually thinking about fucking me Yes Do you look down at your wife when youre fucking her and think m going to be with you until die Yes How do you feel about that Its both comforting and terrifying at the same time Do you love me Ever since the first moment saw you What are you thinking about Trying to decide if its better to Snoop around your apartment while youre not here Or ask you pointblank where it is Where what is Hobbs expects me to deliver a video he believes youre sending him Oh fuck What Oh god dont fucking believe this Jesus Christ What wanted you to find that video for me What ve been through my whole apartment my computer They watch me everywhere Theyve been threatening me with all kinds of things dont have much time and wanted you to help me find that video Wait you know whats on that video ve never watched it but was there for the taping yes All right come on dont bullshit me If youre not the one sending that video to Hobbs then who is hmm dont know was hoping you could find that out too Okay Well maybe you want to share with me what the fuck is going on Its not good Okay you have to understand that Simon was always testing me became like a science experiment for him m willing to do anything you ask as long as it doesnt involve hurting someone if you are willing to do anything ask Fuck you Si can keep up with you You can Mmhmm So you accept the challenge Yeah So what do you want me to do want you to be holding the hand of someone just as they die Challenge accepted want you to have sex With someone most unexpected Challenge accepted m gonna need proof Hmm If youre really going to play this kind of game it gets really Interesting It gets um gets exciting sort of dont know Maybe m not explaining it What So he set off with his camera to be with somebody when they died in the hospital or something and then set off with mine to have sex with someone most unexpected Meaning Meaning like a cab driver or a woman wouldnt do because thats too predictable for Simon You know always had to push back Simon had a way of making me want to show him everything just to just to see if it was enough sat down in the lobby to think could go to the mayors place Gracie mansion thought of trying to get to one of the Yankees And then in walked Hobbs thought recognized him from the report of his last megabuyout merger whatever but wasnt sure The bellhop confirmed he was the billionaire media mogul Hobbs and bucks later he gave me his room number And you taped the whole thing Yeah it was easy just had my camera peeking out from the purse that left on the table The next morning Simon tears into my purse and he took the flash drive and he never let me see it And he never kept his end of the bargain up either And fucking hated him for that took a shower for like three hours and promised myself would never care what Simon thought about me ever again And then he saw the video and he freaked out and we had a big fight And after he died thought that the That the video would be in his collection and it wasnt Look why me Come on You know youre perfect for this So all this between us This is all for me to help you get back some video file Just tell me Yes Do you forgive me No Or me You have to understand that initially asked you for help and then got to know you and really liked you Porter youve got to believe me Hobbs is serious about getting this video Hes going to take everything away from me You know youre saying a lot of things but youre not telling me what need to know ve told you everything No There is a reason why Hobbs is so adamant about getting this flashcard back because a guy his age would be proud to have proof of fucking a woman as young and beautiful as you without paying for it And if Simon told you to go have sex with somebody theres a reason why he got so upset when he saw the footage So tell me the truth Now Or m leaving ve told you everything promise you promise Please help me Porter please help Porter please Wren Okay okay okay What can do for your fellows on this lovely evening huh Give us the file dont have it yet Are you sure about that You just came from her apartment Hey What the fuck How come youre not answering

by moment This is a copy for you The original is somewhere you will never find If you ever contact my wife in any way see Keep me in check Will you tell it to me The horse story When was nine really wanted a horse And my stepfather Ron was not into giving me one And my mother was so powerless in the relationship that she didnt even bother to argue for me As my birthday got closer used to beg and beg for that horse And every time begged Ron would slap me across the face It would only make me beg more the next day One night he came into my room and he said if could keep his visit a secret And if he could do whatever he wanted then he would buy me a horse for my birthday And this went on for about a week And when my birthday rolled around there was no horse So that night when he came into my room told him that was going to go tell my mother what he had been doing to me And he promised me that hed kept his end of the deal And that there would be a horse waiting for me the next day Happy birthday Caroline Heres your horse Why did you look in the elevator think you wanted me to Caroline Goodbye Caroline Well dont just go Say something to me Be well As well as you can be The ugliness of who ve been and who am now is strongest when get to see my wife and children never told Lisa the truth choosing instead to let her imagine the worst of me think she decided that whatever was in me now was dark and ugly and better left where it was as long as it was not near her and the kids What was doing here Maybe because it made me feel safer to know Caroline was far away from me as if alone were not responsible for the wreckage to my marriage Maybe to see her in her new life would bring me some kind of closure Maybe m just feeling stupidly sentimental like the asshole that am As the old reporter told me on my first day its all one story kid Its all one big story
