Youre four minutes ahead of schedule Ahead Gee thats unprecedented dont know what to do with myself Mr Maclnerney asked me to tell you Oh right the meeting Rest assured your concerns are not falling on deaf ears The environmental lobby has known no greater ally than President Shepherd Hardly an impressive distinction Sydney we should leave Mr Maclnerney alone now Hes given us Mr Maclnerney doesnt

the report of the Quebec Conference Youre right havent read it Yesterday d have told you the Quebec Conference was made up of six professional hockey teams But what do know is that its time for the president to run for reelection Leon Kodak is as good as it gets when it comes to electoral strategy and m sure hes told the president exactly what d tell him Nail down Michigan and California where they burn plenty of fossil fuels but if d read these pages would have discovered that burning fossil fuels is whats mostly responsible for global warming and that the recommended reduction is a necessary first step toward arresting the greenhouse effect which this administration has ignored Its time for us The White House chief of staff will not let us leave here until hes broken the bad news m afraid Sydneys right although not about Michigan and California The president has asked me to tell you that his proposed energy bill calls for a ten percent reduction The president is willing to go it alone on this but hes asking for and frankly hes expecting the full support of the Our full support Yes he is The presidents dreaming He has critically misjudged reality If he honestly thinks the environmental community is going to whistle happily while rallying support around this mockery of environmental leadership just because hes a nice guy and hes done better than his predecessors then your boss is the chief executive of Fantasyland Lets take him out back and beat the shit out of him Good morning Mr President How are you today Couldnt be better My apologies for the interruption

life Because when its the president its not personal hired your reputation hired a pit bull not a prom queen Thats unfair Its incredibly unfair But youve spent a lot of time over the years telling me

sitting at the grownups table You have a chance to get everything you want run a national campaign be a major player inside the party But this relationship had better go all the way because with the leader of the free world theres no halfway Politics is perception If this doesnt work out the time itll take you to go from being a hired gun to a cocktail party joke can be clocked with an egg timer Leo theres no relationship It was one night Its done This was just delivered by White House messenger Its marked perishable The White House sent me something perishable Its for Miss Wade Oh well here

ham Dig it Miss Wade Youre the presidents girlfriend Theres never an egg timer around when you need one Thanks Theyre going to be pressing today about whether the White House is prepared to soften the crime bill Theres no need to entertain that at this point How do you want me to handle the Sydney issue The Sydney issue We should have a consensus on how the White House is gonna handle it certainly

no Sydney issue Good morning Thanks for seeing me on such short notice No problem Did you get the ham Yes got the ham wanted to send you some flowers but there are some kinks in the system m so glad

upper bicuspid region You have a shortrange weapons system outside Tel Aviv think somebody told on me Dad Youre overthinking this Voters arent interested in how to achieve economic growth They dont want to hear our plans to strengthen foreign policy So it comes down to character The press like him The networks the newspapers Reporters like him Networks and newspapers like ratings and circulation For all the bitching we do about liberal bias in the press when it comes to a good character debate The press is an unwitting accomplice The character debate didnt work for us Because it couldnt Our polling told us that attacking his character less than a year after hed lost his wife was gonna make people feel sorry for him We couldnt run the campaign we wanted because the opponent was a widower But hes still a widower Times passed but Youll have to forgive my friend here Hes been on a hunting trip Hes been cut off from the world Why Whats going on The presidents got a girlfriend Your dad says youre studying the Constitutional Convention Shes not having any fun though Dad Youre not having any fun This is a nightmare This is a social studies nightmare Theyre doing a mock congress Each

about their own All right Thats enough Mr President youve raised a daughter almost entirely on your own and shes terrific So what does it say to you that in the past seven weeks fiftynine percent of this country has begun to question your family values The president doesnt answer to you Oh yes he does m a citizen This is my president In this country it is not only permissible to question our leaders its our responsibility But you already know that dont you Mr President You have a deeper love of this country than any man ve ever known and want to know what it says to you that in the past seven weeks fiftynine percent of Americans have begun to question your patriotism If people want to listen to Bob They dont have a choice Bob Rumson is the only one doing the talking People want leadership and in the absence of genuine leadership theyll listen to anyone who steps up to the microphone They want leadership Theyre so thirsty for it theyll crawl toward a mirage And when they discover theres no water theyll drink the sand Lewis we have had presidents who were beloved who couldnt find a coherent sentence with two hands and a flashlight People dont drink the sand because theyre thirsty They drink the sand because they dont know the difference Mr President what do you want to do about Make the deal Yes sir Make the deal Yes sir just want to go on record and apologize

not clean air then its clean water Its not good enough that m on the cover of People magazine ll call him You mean youll call him yourself personally Itll come from the president Thats a great idea You should call Leo and make a deal He hires me back for say days go around scaring Congress making them think the presidents about to drive through a very costly bill Theyll believe me right Because m the presidents Friday night girl dont know if you can dip into that well twice since ve lost credibility But you never know might pull it off again might give you just the leverage you need to pass some groundbreaking piece of crime legislation Iike a mandatory day waiting period before a fiveyearold can buy an Uzi Fuck the sweater Shell have to live with disappointment What do you think went on here today know exactly what went on here today got screwed You saw the poll needed the bill couldnt get it so got screwed The environment got screwed Sydney Nothing happened to you Governing is choosing Governing is prioritizing made no secret of the fact the crime bill was my top priority Well congratulations Its only taken you three years to put together crime prevention legislation that has no hope of preventing crime Syd please dont want to lose you over this Mr President you got bigger problems than losing me You just lost my vote Whats in Hartford Richard Reynolds district office Shes thinking of running his campaign Twelve in the corner Hartford insurance capital of the world Have a good time Syd Listen m gonna have Janie clear your schedule for the weekend You need rest You handling me No Good But will if you dont start taking your head out of your ass Excuse me Lewis is right Go after this guy Has he lied What Has Rumson lied in the past weeks Has he lied Other than not knowing the difference between Harvard and Stanford has he said something that isnt true Am not a commander in chief whos never served in the military Am not opposed to a constitutional amendment banning flag burning Am not an unmarried father who shared a bed with a liberal lobbyist down the hall from his yearold daughter And you think youre wrong You dont win elections by telling people that they are We fight the fights we can win You fight the fights that need fighting Is the view pretty good from the cheap seats beg your pardon Because it occurs to me that in years ve never seen your name on a ballot Why are you always one step behind me Because if wasnt youd be the most popular professor at the University of Wisconsin Fuck you Have Lewis put the final draft of the State of the Union on my desk in the morning Yes sir If Mary hadnt died would we have won three years ago Would we have won If we had to go through a character debate three years ago would we have won dont know But would have liked that campaign If my friend Andy Shepherd had shown up would have liked that campaign very much Because the president feels theres no value in this kind of character debate Will the president ever respond to Rumsons question about being a member of the American Civil Liberties Union Yes he will Good morning Please keep your seats Good morning For the last couple of months Senator Rumson has suggested that being president was to a certain extent about character Although have not been willing to engage in his attacks on me ve been here three years and three days and can tell you without hesitation being president of this country is entirely about character For the record Yes am a cardcarrying member of the But the more important question is why arent you Bob Now this is an organization whose sole purpose is to defend the Bill of Rights So it begs the question Why would a senator his partys most powerful spokesman and a candidate for president choose to reject upholding the Constitution If you can answer that question youre smarter than am because didnt understand it until a few hours ago America isnt easy America is advanced citizenship Youve gotta want it bad cause its gonna put up a fight Its gonna say You want free speech Lets see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil whos standing center stage and advocating at the top of his lungs that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours You want to claim this land as the land of the free Then the symbol of your country cannot just be a flag The symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest Now show me that defend that celebrate that in your classrooms Then you can stand up and sing about the land of the free ve known Bob Rumson for years and ve operated under the assumption that the reason Bob devotes so much energy to shouting at the rain was that he simply didnt get it Well was wrong Bobs problem isnt that he doesnt get it Bobs problem is that he cant sell it We have serious problems to solve and we need serious people to solve them Whatever your particular problem is promise you Bob Rumsons not the least bit interested in solving it He is interested in two things and two things only making you afraid of it and telling you whos to blame for it That ladies and gentlemen is how you win elections You gather a group of middleage middleclass middleincome voters who remember with longing an easier time and you talk to them about family and American values and character You wave an old photo of the presidents girlfriend and you scream about patriotism and you tell them Shes to blame for their lot in life And you go on television and you call her a whore Sydney Ellen Wade has done nothing to you Bob She has done nothing but put herself through school represent the interests of public school teachers and lobby for the safety of our natural resources You want a character debate Bob you better stick with me Cause Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your league ve loved two women in my life lost one to cancer And lost the other cause was so busy keeping my job forgot to do my job Well that ends right now Tomorrow morning the White House is sending a bill to Congress for its consideration Its White House Resolution an energy bill requiring a reduction of the emission of fossil fuels over the next ten years It is by far the most aggressive stride ever taken in the fight to reverse the effects of global warming The other piece of legislation is the crime bill As of today it no longer exists m throwing it out m throwing it out and writing a law that makes sense You cannot address crime prevention without getting rid of assault weapons and handguns consider them a threat to national security and will go door to door if have to but m gonna convince Americans that m right and m gonna get the guns Weve got serious problems and we need serious people If you want to talk about
