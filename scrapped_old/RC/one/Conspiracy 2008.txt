Carly was He drove headon into a uh bar that he just spent a weeks salary in And Rhodes After Jerry died the only thing had left was unpaid bills The only family had in the world was Carly and my brother Donnie and he couldnt hold on to a job if it had a handle on it And then Rhodes came to town and he was rich and kind and smart and he courted me for months After we started seeing each other he set me up in my own store and he was He was good to Carly and me He was so gentle And then he decided to make Lago his home and no one could believe that a man like that would want to stay here And he started to throw money into everything and he started to rebuild the town And everyone felt safe Hell felt safe for the first time in my life For a while And then suddenly the rules started and couldnt go anywhere without him knowing about it And before we knew who John Rhodes really was he had owned us and in a blink there were no more business owners there were just employees stay here because know hell hurt my child And know theres nowhere that can run that his money will not find us How many times have you been out here to check on me few Doesnt Rhodes know youre here No No uh

think that you killed Miguels family and he should get a medal for bringing the killer to justice You dont understand how powerful he is Him and his government cronies they make an excuse to go to war and suddenly he has contracts for tanks and planes to destroy an entire nation Then when its time to rebuild he gets paid to To fix exactly what hes knocked down Then with that money he buys more and more of America and does he put any money in the pockets of Americans No He hires slaves and doesnt pay them an honest days wage Then with that money he puts up a private border guard and convinces people hes stopping terrorists from crossing the border And its just an excuse to start another war and it all goes around again So was it worth it Losing your leg for a lie to line John Rhodes
