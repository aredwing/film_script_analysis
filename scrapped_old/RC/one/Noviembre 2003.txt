parents got killed You were there right Why do you ask dont know was thinking its hard to believe always thought had rotten luck but some people have even worse Dani was lying Bullshit It was all a lie None of what said was true made up the whole story No shit swear What dont believe you What a bastard Excuse me You did that scene with Lucia right Yeah thats me Congratulations hadnt seen anything that good in ages Thats all have to say Thanks Bye Of course heard about it The entire school did In just a few days time from poor orphan to total jerk Is acting not an exercise in bringing credibility to fiction Well he did exactly that And in such a way that everyone fell for it as if it were absolutely true Of course perfectly remember it perfectly had a scene prepared but he was asked up instead Yuta was near the stage He called on Alfredo who seemed a bit uneasy He went on stage and sat on one of those crates we used to use as props And Yuta said Alfredo Why are you here What What for Why acting school Whats your aim Me To study To study what Acting Why What do you mean Why acting You must have a reason Or was it just either this or computers Because enjoy it What do you enjoy Acting enjoy acting Sure Tell me What do you think is the point of acting dont know Sometimes it seems like there isnt one But you think there should be right Yes Selfimprovement at least To make us more selfconscious guess You dont give a fuck about that What You heard me You dont give a fuck about improving yourself Youre worried about other things Thats your problem What the hell is this about The other day you humiliated me Me and everyone else You lied to us all telling us that fable about your life Look were not your marionettes People come here to commit themselves They reveal fuckedup things about themselves Horrible things They take risks But not you And on top of that you ridicule us Youre a scumbag You respect nothing and no one Get off that stage Get down Thats not true It isnt Which part isnt true wasnt ridiculing anyone Well think you were Its the only reason you came Youre wrong Then why are you here Are you going to answer You know why acting Actually m extremely interested in finding out why youre here ll tell you why To do something for me and for others Acting because its a form of human communication a way to reach understanding and comprehension Thats why So you want to change the world Thats right d love to change this fuckedup world And think theres still time Alfredo Alfredo Wait Where are you going dont know Anywhere but here thats for sure Come back inside Theyre all waiting for you No m leaving Youll get kicked out dont care could care less Fine But dont be upset Are you going home Yeah ll go with you Let me get my things d like to change the world too you know d love to change this fuckedup world hate having the audience just sitting there unable to participate or interact It reminds me of him They should do something anything They just sit there like statues want to see people respond dont know somehow How strange What always liked theater for just the opposite Why Because hated my sister wanted to be different from her wanted to feel special unique When we were little she was better at everything My parents always said she was prettier smarter And hated her hated her guts You should come with Daniel and me Where When we act in the streets ln the streets No way not me Why not Because In the street No way In a theater or a movie Even on which hate But in the street No In a theater but not in the street Its different Why In the street anything can happen People react in unexpected ways In a theater the audience knows youre acting Its less unpredictable Thats the whole point to acting in the streets The same people always see plays The only way to reach everyone else is to take the show to the streets Well l ll see m quitting school What quit m not going back Table still needs clearing This guy is clueless Orders for table and Is table s food ready yet Are these mine Three coffees one whisky shot two with cognac Sergio need the veal and that pasta for table Sergio for the love of God need the desserts for Thanks Whats up Alfredo Who are you left right after you did was sick of it All that damn psychoanalysis They said my problem was confused ego with selfesteem So quit d put up with enough It wasnt acting it was some kind of selfhelp or group therapy Anything but acting It was an insane asylum No wonder people go nuts m much better off in the street So am l By the way Dani and are doing a little street show Its unreal People are really amazed did theater at university Theres no comparison love acting in the streets so much you wont believe this but sometimes get a hard on No way m serious get hard as a rock You know what happens to me What shouldnt say this Tell me Hey who cares get like this tingly feeling in my ass right before Bullshit swear Nerves probably Because its right before It fades once get going Unbelievable There was no trick to it Well there was sort of had a friend who lived upstairs This guy named Pablo actually That was the trick d hang the chair from his place We went out drinking We hit every bar in the area Discussing heaven and earth as they say We stayed out until ten the next morning ending up sloshed in some bar in Lavapies It was the start of a great friendship and of everything else Not only the first shows but also what would later become the November company It was miraculous It really worked What we did and how we did it really made us feel special Especially asking for nothing in exchange That was unthinkable back then when nothing was free No explanation was necessary People came up with their own They came up with much more interesting stuff than could have Most people when we refused their money were baffled They didnt understand They were little skits in most cases without any plot Just simple improvisation Provocative situations where the key was spontaneity The first time very nervous cant explain it It was so exciting Especially right before Good morning Dont be alarmed Hey you all look scared You think we want money Are we thieves Beggars You think were hooligans right Wrong Youre all very mistaken We dont want money We hate money Right kids Were here today for a more human cause much nobler more revealing cause much wiser than cash We have a gift for all of you Thats right Well put an end to your misery An end to your suffering An end to your pain baby Get with it You cant just get up every morning Iike zombies Look at you Sleepwalking to the same office You need a gift right Something different something to lift your spirits to make you feel alive to make you feel young again

Helena Three at least And lmanol How about it Vanesa Anything for a buck What do you mean could use the cash Not a penny No thanks How can you be so cheap Were not making a dime The November Manifesto We had several principles The first was to create a free independent theater The second was to avoid all forms of both public and private aid No closed premises where entry could be limited What will you call it November What November Could you pass the water All established acting methods were prohibited How about October Its more revolutionary The November revolution came after dream of changing the world Right Alfredo Bitch The Fifth Commandment as Alfredo described it was the law of Mohammed which meant we had to go wherever the audience was That damn Seventh Commandment The Seventh Commandment prohibited anyone from joining who had in any way been involved in film or Cant feed off the wind my diets pretty thin But can say my piece without money cant remember Well dont know dont remember any manifesto swear Its the first ve heard of it When joined What Are you pulling my leg The creation of original material with adaption of all existing text strictly forbidden And the Tenth and final to never betray the Manifesto under any circumstances dont want to bring misfortune swear when joined the group never signed any manifesto Hell didnt even want to be an actor went because

Well do something else Like what Well come up with something Sure were all in such a creative mood We have to do another show Have you got any ideas ldeas My head is fucking full of them just have to pick one thats all So Lets go Well my minds a total blank Our first show and we get arrested And all our props get confiscated As you can imagine it didnt look promising Wed thought of everything except the permit What mattered was getting out there and doing something So they wanted to play rough did they November is a tight group of desperate actors They may not have a dime but they feel oh so oh so oh so very wellpaid Help me Help me m hungry What a cutie Can borrow your cell to call home Have you got a cell phone Have you got one Here use this to call Thank you Were in the same boat Good afternoon Have you a free moment Get off me Dont fucking touch me Asshole Asshole yourself We had to live inside the very skin of each character in a realistic way with the street as our stage When we came up with the idea to break with mainstream acting methods and interpret characters whose credibility could be measured in a real situation thats when we realized how far we could go with it Alicia played the junkie Lucia played a Romanian gypsy and Alfredo the gypsy patriarch Imanol played the bum Helena and Pedro played the battered wife and the blind man And beyond that we went from popular holidaystyle theater to a more social style of theater more critical It was much harsher more aggressive It was the start of though we were unaware at the time of what we later came to call Documentary Theater We were all This realized later We had become a reflection of Alfredos brother Thats what it boils down to We were a reflection of Alejandro You cant say you werent begging this time Its part of the act They were playing beggars Go on sit Just part of the script right Yes More or less Youve got some nerve kid You made this all up to make a buck without getting in trouble Unbelievable What That you think so lt wouldnt surprise me Isnt there somewhere else you can go and act This is the best area We cant do this out in the desert No cash to be made Its not about the cash You know what we planned to do with the money Dont tell me Give it to the poor How did you know Come on Cut the crap already You dont believe me No dont In any case it still wouldnt make any difference What was your name Alfredo Baeza With a got it What next You know the routine Thank you What about the wheelchair Next month Okay For the poor eh swear to God Youre crazier than thought It was frustrating you know pain in the ass All our effort would disappear in a second It left an empty feeling inside Above all a profound sense of impotence dont know as if we were literally stunned Stilts diapers bedding sheets a microphone Whats the use With a little cash we could cover our expenses Some stilts and a few rags Is that the price of our dignity We said we wouldnt turn back We need ideas Thats not all they took from us Theres more The strollers took forever to make Manus wigs Pablos chair lots of stuff All that is trivial Sure none of it was yours Juan Its the truth Lets not get into whose is what okay smartass Take a look around you Its not an issue People contributed whatever they could We all knew nobody was getting paid If were throwing away our principles to hell with it Making a profit is one thing paying expenses is another Dani Wed end up doing commercial theater just like everyone else This was supposed to be different Dani nobodys proposing that No but this is how it all begins You know what we should do We should steal our stuff back From the cops Yeah right Well maybe not There must be a way Unless someones got a better idea say we move on Juan you remember Marble Sure do Didnt he study acting at one of our workshops Hes still at the Royal Theater Sure he had a contract He said he hated it but hes still there Why Well he said to call him if we needed anything So Well rob the Royal Theater instead of the cops How many people fit in here Well seats plus the boxes Can you imagine acting here with a full house It must be amazing d shit myself couldnt go through with it Wait keep quiet a second What Be quiet Dani hold still Its unreal isnt it Yeah but prefer the streets Marble was a stage director at the Royal Theater and a big fan of independent theater He directed The Fleas who worked small playhouses in Madrid back in the nineties His job gave him time for the group but he was ready to move on He used to give us all the gossip about the Royal Theater Like the initial budget for renovation and how it ended up costing seven times that He hated their policies He said disgraceful sums of money were going to only a few people He said we could have anything we wanted that it was ours for the taking because somehow wed earned it and we couldnt steal from ourselves So its actually yours for the taking Its better off with you than rotting here We can take anything we want Sure Help yourselves This too Kl Tl Rl Kl SlTl Tl Wl Watch it Can we go now Wait want to see something Whats so funny cant say Why not Because ll tell you later Look at the painting Come on tell me No Asshole Airhead You fucking faggot Bitch You filthy swine Scumsucking son of a bitch You nasty whore hope some pig rapes you dry and infects you with

at The Maids of Honour And was the first audience to endure it still hadnt told Alfredo was pregnant You scared me didnt understand There its over thought you were joking at first but later thought it was serious For a second there even thought you might die Tl Somebody help me Please somebody help me Shooting was the first of a series of performances designed around current events The idea was to incorporate fiction into reality and have the audience take part without their knowing it We thought it would help people understand modern issues like terrorism Please everyone get back This way please Please move back Quickly that way please It was around ten in the morning The shops had just opened It wasnt crowded but there were people around Goddamnit had to get out of there Howd it go Fine except for the stroller What ran it over didnt see it Someone even had to be attended to An older woman we were told later who fainted when she saw Alfredo get shot Holy shit This is getting ugly Give me an update We put on a neckbrace massage And we took his pulse Saline and adrenaline Get the Lifepack Wait hold it What the fuck Were actors What Were a theatrical group Were performing here What m sorry but weve no choice but to file charges We were most tense not when the verdict was read but when the read the charges Thats when we realized the trial was going to be much more complicated than we had anticipated We were accused of simulating a crime and of justifying terrorism We were told later that the fact it all took place the year of the ceasefire with was the reason it all got buried and the sentences were suspended Anything to do with terrorism was kept quiet They wanted the ceasefire to give people a sense of peace and calm No never agreed with Shooting The ends never justify the means think we made a mistake We went too far Ana was born the day of the verdict remember because we all celebrated at the hospital Alfredo Lucia and the baby moved to an apartment in Chueca Daniel never forgave them for leaving He didnt understand why they had to leave We felt differently about what had happened and about how it would affect the future Not being allowed to act anywhere in public for years ruined all our plans told you Daniel Theres nothing we can do What are you talking about m sorry but no m not going to explain it again Alfredo m coming Because m at work and its busy Excuse me Are you Alfredo Baeza Yes So you work here Congratulations ve seen you guys and youre great Thanks Do you know when the next performance is Actually have no

problem know where that is Tuesday at noon ll be there Okay Goodbye Eduardo Ever heard of a producer named Eduardo Echevarria How many shows would it be Right now cant say But need you to do as many shows per day as possible Why No reason dont know What Is there a problem No d have to talk to the others and check the dates Look this might sound absurd but weve never worked professionally Its our first time dont know if were capable There isnt much of a difference assure you Youll be doing the same act Well weve never been paid know but try to understand have to pay you something Otherwise cant sign you guys Dont worry it wont be much Dont expect to make millions Theater doesnt pay the rent Its not the amount It really isnt know it sounds strange but its a deal we made from the start We wanted to be free to stay independent Thats why Look just think it over You can let me know ll call you after talk to the others Hi Hi ls she asleep Yeah barely Well What did he say Nothing He wants to hire us to work at festivals Hed give us total freedom Any show we want Old stuff of ours or new Starting when At the Alcala Festival think its in July What did you say That d talk to the others But m going to say no anyway What You have nothing to say think you said it all m sorry What do you think You really want to know Yes tell me think it would be a lot of fun And legally this is the only way Who the hell cares if were professionals or not You should talk to the others before deciding They have a right to know Weve never done it for money So why start now Done what Get paid to act Lucia Well think you secretly want to What does that matter It does It would be great if for once instead of your head you used this didnt say that You did But you said youd do it Yes d like to So what Its the only way disagree Fine tell me how told you No thats too risky Come on Dani Nobody here wants to break probation and risk a real jail term Its better than selling out agree Fine but the others dont see where this is going have eyes cant believe it Just like that our whole method goes out the window Its a matter of principle Principle We just want to act Its been eight months You might not think so but do Thats all can say Nobodys forcing you know that Dont worry well be there dont care what you do What is it Can say something Go ahead Why not do what Helena said think its for the best Besides this is leading us nowhere m in No It seemed reasonable enough to me said no let the others decide You guys decide Yes Yes Sl Who wants the blood of Christ You You want it You want the blood of Christ Dani What the fuck are you doing What weve always done thats what You prick Go fuck yourself Youll ruin everything Really hope do No Dani You want blood You fucking idiot You want blood Watch the eyes asshole Dont push If it gets in your eyes tough shit Dani Goddamnit Dani Stop Dani Oh Lord Why have you forsaken us Its the only way out There still may be time Yeah When would we need the text ready by Its in October If were ready by September ll have time to send the paperwork to the Ministry of Culture Do we really have a chance think so But have another project going so thats the best can offer you You cant convince them No ve been trying all morning Its a lost cause ve got to go Start preparing and think about what said If you want to keep acting that is cant work with someone like that its too complicated This is my livelihood cant gamble on a lunatic m leaving on my own accord You got that asshole Would you drop it Just sit down Hey its no big deal All that commitment and talk about free theater and now what Youre prostituting yourself You sold out for peanuts You ruined everything Even worse you did it on purpose And d do it again Why Because always practice what preach If youre going to screw things up just leave You said so yourself My how youve changed Thats right So what Some people evolve while others stay the same forever Like you Youre damn right Just shut up Dani ll never change Even if it kills me Its my only salvation Let go of me Lets go Whats wrong Our shows got cancelled Shit Hi Would you guys mind taking a photo with us later We always take pictures with people from the festival If you dont mind The last time we were all together in Alcala was very sad Its hard to accept when something you created falls apart Not only something you created but something youve lived for Signing with Eduardo Echevarria was like signing our death sentence We lost what held us together our freedom and the desire to be unique Without the one thing that made us different we had no purpose Daniel was right We sold out Eduardo was only trying to exploit the Shooting scandal It wasnt bad timing or fatigue nothing like that It was simply his extremism and radicalism His cause had been lost to the rest of us Besides at that point it was completely unviable We sold out Not only by accepting money for the first time as a group but also Well it was very painful All the things we had to change Heres an example Whenever we used to do Messiah we did it naked Until that goodygoody Eduardo came along That jerk made us wear brassieres and loincloths Imagine that In After Daniel and left the group there was no contact between us Just Pedro who came to visit once He said Alfredo was playing in pubs in Malasana But we didnt see him until Alejandro fell ill It was because of his brother Everything Alfredo did was directly related to his brother He had this recurring nightmare he dreamt that he had murdered him Alfredo at times confused fiction and reality Alfredo Alfredo What is it was at the Ministry And We didnt get the grant Open up Hi Hi When did you get home little while ago love watching her sleep Me too had to take off my shirt and wash my hands Why Because its sickening cant touch her after being in that damn bar cant go on like this m rotting away cant take it any more Then dont dont want anything to do with this Not even theater Its bullshit Alfredo What What is it Alejandro is ill He always destroyed the ones we gave him tried to stop him but Its all right mother ve missed you Would you like something to eat or would you rather rest a bit No m fine m going to lie down ll leave you then ll help your father See you later mother See you later my son Why did you do it Are you sure ve lost all interest in acting That could change dont know the business but maybe youll have better luck in a few years doubt it Think it through Youve always liked it There are worse things out there Yeah Thats not what you said when moved to Madrid Sure But got over that Your brother helped me think Those marionettes of yours were the only thing he ever liked Unbelievable What Nothing What is it No nothing never knew they mattered Nobody knows what happened in Lorca but something had pushed Alfredo to call us with the theater idea ve heard all kinds of stuff but no one really knows Alejandro Hi See who came to see you He was so excited He was inspired again The Royal Theater idea sounded like madness to me but later realized it was like going back to our roots Hi is Daniel there Dani its me Alfredo Alfredo Baeza It wasnt so farfetched The ruling prohibited us from acting in the street It didnt mention a theater didnt care much about the Manifesto said no because it was too risky It just didnt seem necessary to me at the time Shooting was enough for me said no because wanted to stay out of trouble So you defend an idea on paper but you cant defend it and make it a reality Is that it The way he said it he had such a way with words He convinced me couldnt refuse All set m off Straight to the stalls Stop for nothing See you later Okay bye Dani Dani Juan is that you Yeah its me m in here What took you so long didnt see Pedro Shit Were late Here you need a quick touchup Wait Dani Weve got to stop this What We have to warn Alfredo somehow Why Quiet What is it What is it Guess who just entered the theater Who The President Alfredo Wait hold on a sec Are you kidding just saw him go in The President We have to warn Alfredo Wait What for What for To tell him whats happening Thatll just make him nervous Good No he shouldnt know Are you nuts You know what a scene he could cause Damn right The bigger the better Youre high ll warn him Wait Let go Youre not warning anybody Let go Dani Juan Come on lets think this through Okay kids Break a leg Lets get to it Let the real show begin Hello Excuse me could you cut the music for a second If you dont mind Silence Thank you so much Come in Alberto What is it Forgive this minor interruption of this production subsidised by the illustrious Ministry of Culture But ve got a little anecdote if you dont mind We happened to decide the other day to take over this stage in order to let our voices be heard Therefore one two three and four We did it because were fed up Yes Were tired Were drained Were desperate ll check the actors Because lately theater and art in general really stinks Lower the curtain Thats right The stench of business of boardrooms civil servants commerce advertising routine comfort Ieisure boredom bureaucracy and deceit Everything except art Art Art is no more Only the art business or the art market or the business of art subsidies Just another bank account the art of adding numbers But were not part Whats he doing Still up on that swing Incredible Were freeeeee We can try the other catwalk but its far Any other way Excuse me you cant go in there Yes We believe that art can change peoples hearts Give them strength Dont touch me ll go quietly Art can make people feel alive Art can reach the spirit of every man and every woman Art can bring social consciousness make us better people Art can be universal Iimitless free of religion free of race Art can be a weapon But not a prop real gun The shot must be heard Shit The target must be hit Alfredo Alfredo Alfredo Alfredo If could be twentysomething again d do it all over again But knowing what know now So we could make it work dont know Whenever think about it it seems absurd Time has passed Its still painful and absurd waste huge waste ll never forget seeing Alfredo dangling from the trapeze Never We couldnt believe it Even now can hardly believe Alfredo died It was like a bad dream nightmare You cant imagine how much something like this can change a persons life The experience changed me forever assure you not a single day goes by that dont think about that moment We wanted to change the world We failed miserably Now just try to not let the world change me l Wl
