tongue Yeah Your button Thanks Now what would you do here Young single and hottie guy leaning in Kiss him grab him Pull him behind the stacks Sam You okay Luke Luke took me to the emergency room that

happened But now were just two professionals working together And m marrying the man that love so its all good See there he is probably confirming our meeting with the florist along with our weekly dinner at Andres Hello Hi honey It wasnt easy but did it He does interfaith Were meeting him this Sunday afternoon Honey we have a rabbi It was even better than hoped My Ben was really coming through

Come on get serious So how is next Wednesday ish Its a date Hes hot Okay great got it All right Okay See you Bye What You and Luke sure work well together Nancy its just work Right Just be careful At home we seemed to be arguing about everything Maybe should see if being a dad is something m cut out for with one kid before we start competing with the old lady in the shoe Only children are so lonely Ben Its not fair to the kid Do we have to talk about this now Why not now Well its on a Thursday and we need to plan our entire family life down to retirement Thats not what m saying thought we should discuss it but if youre too tired No no no Okay yeah yeah lets do it How about this Four kids two of each then we hit Arizona and wait out the clock Why cant you talk about this seriously Because nothing is gonna get settled while were both exhausted So just sleep on it and well deal with it later Suddenly the weeks were flying by and later became soon And by then had other things to worry about like when discovered my life seemed destined to be overrun by one thing Boxes Soon after the moving boxes were cleared out the gift boxes began to arrive Cool we got a rice cooker And a bread maker And an asparagus steamer Oh and another rice cooker The delivery guy came around so often he was almost like family Work was going well Some might say too well And living with Ben Well that was teaching me a few things Like cant stand the stench of stale beer mixed with sweat and pizza sauce Things werent all smelly though We did find a gorgeous wedding site ve seen it in the spring and its fabulous m counting on global warming to get me a dream wedding So had a honeymoon idea What Europe d love that ve never been Lets go backpacking Well get a Eurail pass and hit the countryside It was one of my biggest regrets after college went straight to work and all my friends did Europe Well was thinking more like beaches and threadcount sheets Yeah everyone does that Well theres a reason why Hey guys Hi Are you ready Yeah So are there any special requests Well d love to be dipped Oh well Thats a fabulous way to finish You got any beer Because after a couple of drinks m a great dancer Yeah after a couple drinks he thinks hes a great dancer Dont worry Well start simple Just relax Were gonna start with something called the box step all right Just stay within this imaginary box on the floor as you lead Ready And one two three One two three Good Now you try Wait for the beat Come on Okay thats like the cheesiest song ever suppose you prefer a Springsteen anthem Thatd be great Ready And one No thats a little too late Try again little late Sorry Ready And one Oh the other foot Listen One two three And then it hit me The beat and Ben had yet to be introduced He cant dance at all Not even close But wait hadnt we danced before Guess was too distracted to notice Sorry Okay Five minute break We dont We dont need a break The break is for me What are you doing Do you not wanna have a first dance What wanna do is go home order Chinese and veg on the couch okay But m doing my best Yeah well what you call your best call being difficult Difficult You know what difficult is Difficult is having umpteen phone calls from vendors with wedding questions that cant answer Difficult is having to talk about the exact same thing every waking moment mean Sam we still have to have lives Dont put this all on me You think enjoy coming home to basketball and video games Well wouldnt be home playing by myself if you werent always at work doing who knows what The biggest opportunity of my career has just happened to coincide with me coordinating the biggest event of my life Can you please try and be sensitive to that Fine How about give you one less thing to coordinate Why couldnt Ben understand that had to work late This was important It was for It was for What was saying How about a break ll go pick up some Italian What do you say say Caesar salad no dressing and lemon wedges on the side All right coming up Hey Sam forgot my keys Sam Hey Sam Sam What are you sleeping on the job Sorry got the Caesar and got the lemons Whats wrong Nothing If its about work we can take a break We got plenty of time Was glad it was a dream No its not that Then what You can tell me Its the wedding and everything and Sorry Yeah me too Come here m sorry Its okay Its all right just ve gotta go ve gotta go home Yeah gotta go home Hey m sorry For what You know all the stupid fighting and stuff weve been doing No m sorry shouldnt have walked out on you at the dance lesson Its okay You dont have to take dance lessons You dont have to do anything you dont wanna do love you love you too Okay lets think Is it that big of a deal What really happened caught myself controlled my urges Maybe should be proud of myself Or maybe should be proud of my ability to rationalize am so glad that we are finally able to all get together think having a solid blueprint for a ceremony will help us all sleep better at night Its gonna take more than that in my case Reverend Since the heart of our ceremony is the exchange of vows and in the Jewish ceremony its the exchange of rings things should theoretically dovetail nicely Yadda yadda yadda Look lets get down to brass tacks okay First the couple Any special requests Sam The ceremony Just make it nice Nice you want nice youll get Okay Reverend heres my first offer didnt think wed be quite so formal with our proposals Whatd you think were gonna wing it Take a gander couldnt concentrate mean here was with a minister and a rabbi Could have felt more guilty notice that in many of your prayers theyre both in Hebrew and English Yeah thats the norm Well it doesnt seem quite fair You see in effect youll be speaking twice as long m repeating myself m not saying anything more than you are But it will take more time Fine okay ll talk in English and Hebrew You can talk in English and Aramaic But dont speak Aramaic No one does Its a dead language Its not my problem And just as a holy war seemed about to erupt something happened to make me feel even worse Dont worry Well get through this promise Carbs were not the answer Was working out the stress Sure there was that But also had something far more worrisome coming up My dress fitting Honey while she does that think ll take another look around Great Thanks Mom Youre welcome dear have to tell you something Its important and you cant tell anyone And that includes you kissed Luke You slut shouldve seen this coming Did you sleep with him Whos Luke Look it was just a kiss and stopped it Okay so youre not interested in him then Sam No m not The weddings still on not just because bought a dress Nonrefundable by the way Turn Wait wait wait So have you told Ben said the weddings still on didnt Youre gonna tell him right Naive sweet Anne Deception is the cornerstone of every relationship Otherwise its just aprons meat loaf and How was your day honey So having a life means opening up a kissing booth in the conference room m leaning towards honestyisthebestpolicy route Leaning Do you love him Which one Ben Yes of course Absolutely No question You realize the more you say that the less sure you sound love Ben Of course you do dear youre marrying him What Come on Mom will you help me into my dress The time had come to present our ideas to Stone which meant two things My career was on the line and would have to see Luke again Luke hi So was just setting everything up for Maybe we need to You want some coffee No Look Sam nothing happened Luke m the one who should feel embarrassed mean made the mistake Not you Me Why did he have to be so damn perfect Kristin honey Hi Wheres Sam only have an hour for lunch Shes pitching the boss If its this long it must be a good sign Not for my blood sugar Thats Luke Damn So He loved it Its going to corporate and if they love it its on to production Awesome Sam thanks for making me look good in there You dont need her for that just hope corporate likes it They will Call me when you hear Right Look at that ass Kristin work with him cant help it Those buns are eye magnets ran home to channel my urges in an appropriate direction Sam what are you This is so three months ago Do you wanna complain or do you wanna give it to me Oh Sam Oh Luke Luke Luke You said Luke Did Yeah you did No it was probably just a sound like a moan Sounded like a name Luke Ben really dont know what m saying when You know kind of lose control Freudian alert Notice how had yet to mention the name of my coworker to Ben This was clearly my chance to come clean but was probably just saying look as in Look out here come decided to distract him instead Cheap know but sometimes a girls gotta use sex The only thing harder than telling your fianc the truth was designing a cereal box Corporate hated our mockups Stone was hating me which meant was working under intense pressure with Luke Yeah this would be easy What if we combine the color scheme from this one with the typeface here and the photo there What do you think like that Yeah Sam your is here completely forgot Thanks What Our wedding photographer doublebooked and canceled and our backup can only meet me today at If dont meet her now shes gone Well lets go meet a photographer shall we love your candids Thanks Its my specialty started in journalism but realized pretty quick didnt wanna photograph lifes tragedies You know this is so much more rewarding Youve got a great eye Thank you couldnt resist told you candids are my thing Here take a look How cute are you two If only were the fianc Sorry Hi Hi What what what Your feet are cold Sorry Sorry My hair You hurt me Okay Yeah Okay Sorry You okay Maybe we shouldnt you know m kind of beat Yeah m tired too Good night Good night Good night Sammy Wait We should be in the same bed Thats okay Were no longer attracted to each other anyway What We need help Okay kids whats the problem Well guess weve kind of been fighting a lot What have you been fighting about What havent we been fighting about Yeah you name it Flowers cake where to put the couch whether to take dance lessons we dont need Dont forget the missed appointment arguments Hey you said that was fine Read between the lines Ben its my wedding That was so not fine Oh your wedding see Its always about you Okay enough And dont make me blow the shofar again coach the temple softball team Lets try not to look at the specifics and instead seek out what the broader problem is dont think theres a broader problem mean these are just stupid little things Meaning you shouldnt have trouble getting past them What happens when you have to deal with an issue like children We couldnt agree on that either Oh like we even had a discussion just need more time okay Well get to it Really For when after the playoffs Okay what does that mean It means you care more about your stupid little basketball teams than What our unborn child Child Oh really so theres just one Thank you Sometimes in cases like this feel its my responsibility to suggest a postponement What What he means is you guys can use a timeout And you know what couldnt agree more Theres no shame in taking the extra time to deal with these issues Better before a wedding than after Do you know how hard it is to get an interfaith marriage annulled Twice the paperwork You know what To hell with them Should you really be saying to hell with a rabbi and a minister Okay maybe not But no one is gonna tell me who should or shouldnt marry And we can make this work You think Sam love you and thats whats important So lets fix it There he was clawing his way to the surface The prince charming had missed for so long Maybe he was still there Maybe we should go through with this Now say lets kick things into high gear Tonight we break out the serving platters invite the parents and run down the wedding checklist Yeah Of course there was one teeny detail Ben was unaware of But if he was this determined then would tell him about Luke tonight Full disclosure After dinner of course We cant put the Stillmans and the Fogels together Theyll kill each other Yeah Rich borrowed Jerrys snowplow three years ago Totally mangled it But if you do that that means the Nolfies have to sit at the rabbi and ministers table Family friends others The hierarchy Stillmans are cousins Well the Nolfies are very important business associates They handle all my direct mailings Direct mailings Lf you want us to pay for the wedding Oh youre gonna run out Mr Direct Mailing is worth more than family Enough Sam has something she wants to say Ben and had a talk this afternoon and came to a conclusion that the four of you have sadly proven to be true That youll never agree on anything having to do with this wedding So weve come up with a simple solution Ben This is what we want Get used to it For the first time in forever felt like was part of a couple Yeah this works like it Its gotta work Now who wants some pie Oh ll have some Ice cream too Come on in Nancy its open Hey Sam Sam m sorry to come over like this but you werent answering your cell Our designs were approved

feel better mean do we really not belong together was once so sure but that seems so long ago now wish could be sure about something Anything If Ben doesnt want to work it out then maybe you shouldnt What you did was questionable Thanks Need some salt for the wound It wasnt unforgivable But if he doesnt wanna talk about it then maybe you should move on Speaking of moving on Sam look it wasnt my intention to make a scene You said Wednesdays Ben goes out didnt think d be interrupting No no its my fault My plans changed Is everything okay If moving back in with my mom and dad qualifies as okay then yeah m sorry What are you gonna do How about after work take you out for dinner Let me cheer you up Whats frightening is how great that offer sounds Luke should take some time to clear my head

Your loss Night Sam think made a huge mistake Sure Ben and had our moments of conflict but at least always knew where stood Maybe Ben was the right guy for me and maybe letting him get away was the biggest mistake ve ever made Honey who are you talking to No one Honey go get him Oh just to make things clear m talking about the nice Jewish boy Ben Ben He was gone but where The movies ball game Out with some other wom Hello Alan its Sam Well if it isnt Trampy Tramperson herself Please wheres Ben Right to voice mail Hes unreal had to force Alan to tell me Unluckily for him knew where he lived Come on Alan know youre in there see your car He told me not to tell anyone and m pretty sure anyone meant you Wait wait wait Please hear me out ve made a horrible terrible mistake Alan Please help me Show mercy please Alan Alan Here clean yourself up woman Thank you so much Thats it weasel ve been listening to your crap for years Its payback time What are you gonna do If you dont tell me what wanna know will leave you dead in the street Ben went to the airport Hes gone backpacking Now like one of those fools in the movies was gonna race to the airport to try to stop my beloved from leaving the country Of course in real life when you park illegally you get towed Sam dont hurt me but Bens plane left an hour ago And the hits just keep on coming was too late Go into the living room ve got something for you Mom if this is about pie dont need to be depressed and fat Alan said you left That was the plan was originally gonna go next month but the other night was showering and the drain stopped up And this time the cause was your hair So while the plumber guy was lecturing me again realized just couldnt be around here anymore But you didnt leave early tried First started thinking about the trip and all the places that would finally see and all the things that would finally do And then thought about how happy it should make me But it didnt You see despite everything Sam missed your hair dont wanna do any of those things without you dont wanna do anything without you But why did you call off the wedding didnt You did When said didnt think could go through with this meant didnt think could go through with being apart mean when came over here wanted desperately for us to fix things You know wanted to see that fire that fight that feisty girl kick and claw to make us work But instead gave up and pushed you away Ben listen to me never wanted out Ever Really That feisty girl youve been missings right here swear have missed you so bad that would do any had forgotten what a great kisser Ben was The rest was easy Putting on a wedding that was just canceled in less than a week was difficult but it was still easy because finally we were a team a real team And then in the blink of an eye it was the big day Was it the wedding d always dreamed of Well lets see Not only did the Shaunesseys show up but they brought all five kids The peonies adored were of course out of season so had to settle for roses The string quartet lost two of its members to strep think they were dating So we had to go prerecorded But looking out at everyone assembled realized weddings arent about the bride and groom theyre about everyone else Marriages are about the bride and groom And when youre walking down the aisle all the little details mean nothing because at that moment it becomes clear the only thing that matters is who youre walking to Ben Rosen will you give yourself to Samantha Hoyt to be her husband to love her comfort her honor her and protect her forsaking all others to be faithful to her so long as you both shall live will Will you give yourself to Ben Rosen to be his wife to love him comfort him honor him and protect him forsaking all others to be faithful to him so long as you both shall live will May God bless you and keep you let no man put asunder You may kiss the bride Ladies and gentlemen it is our honor to present to you Mr And Mrs Samantha and Benjamin Rosen The day was glorious The rabbi and reverend became best friends And if Bens waltz was well a little rocky didnt care To me that day he danced like Fred Astaire So was it the wedding d always dreamed of No It was better love you love you too SkyFury
