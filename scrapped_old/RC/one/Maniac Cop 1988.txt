policewoman convinced me to do the decent thing Like remove him from prison mortuary alive He wasnt exactly alive There was severe brain damage m certain he was legally dead was telling the truth when signed that death certificate Theres no way he could function as a human being again Read the newspaper Doc Get out of my office Now You never came here m not going to pick up that phone This never
