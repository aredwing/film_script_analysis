search on your behalf Or have been artificially cultivated on the premises By members of our laboratory staff Almost all of the species have been extinct Since the end of the th century Many of the fascinating replicas of marine and animal life May appear frightening to children But we assure each parent there is no cause for alarm In fact many of these animals Although totally unproductive Were kept as domestic pets and bought as playmates For th century children These animals contributed nothing Were not a source of food Our museum houses the largest selection of flowers On this continent

overpopulation Time The time is Will all museum officials Report to their designated posts And humanity suffered the great famine And the smog blanket age Outside and to the rear of the museum You may

absorbed in huge quantities Specific times of the day Were set aside for the intake of this food And the replenishment of corporal energy Was sometimes turned into a social event These events were even conducted out of doors Without any precautions taken To shield their activities Although it seems ridiculous to us Provided as we are by the society With a calorically calculated balanced diet These people were almost criminally addicted To food These thCentury specimens Took food for granted And ate indiscriminately Although during those times Half the world population was underfed It appears barbarous to us But until the end of the th century Food was served on open plates Meat was allowed even encouraged To be hung until it began to rot Makes you shudder doesnt it Cheese was not considered a great delicacy Unless a crust of mold had formed around it Not unexpectedly these eating habits Contributed greatly To the general degeneracy of thCentury man His health was poor Disorders of the stomach And can you wonder at it Obesity cardiac strain thrombosis All the conditions arrested Corrected and finally abolished By the societys rigorous and protracted efforts On your behalf If these people seem happy to you It can only be because they considered ignorance To be bliss They allowed their addiction every license Swallowed poisons without a care for the morrow Or their fellow man Initiates of this eating cult Made great play Of the trappings you have just seen Plates were decorated painted and sometimes gilded Eating utensils were often of silver And used time and again Without the sterilization which you take for granted now Hes sick Turn down the lights Uh put the child on the table He has a terrible fever Nothing to worry about Huh Fine fine Strong
