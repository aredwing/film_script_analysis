call the police now And tell them what This guys got proof his wife died of a heart attack two weeks ago Weve got no body Weve got nothing What What Whats wrong Oh my God Oh my God Hello there How are you How are you May introduce Gladys Dalton my gal Friday This is Larry and Carol my neighbours We were watching Madame Bovary Such a sad story Yeah it is She gets killed at the end You gotta stop up for a drink before go on my trip Love to If you hear of anybody who needs an apartment think may be moving Come on Gladys What a shame Good night Good night Jesus what a day huh cant figure it out Its got to be that either hes a What Either shes a twin or hes a twin Or theyre multiple personalities Or youre a twin or m a twin Because dont know whats going on Youre nuts Look Wait yeah Let me be logical about this We know shes not a twin What are you talking about want to puzzle this out Shes a twin shes not a twin Now youre saying were twins What are you nuts Okay m calm m calm Okay Yeah m going to be logical All right The first thing is this There had been a heart attack What if they induced it Some kind of poison We never saw the body It had to be some other woman Some woman who probably had some resemblance to Mrs House The super says he saw her but hes a drunk Mrs House could have been hiding You heard a noise that night That had to be Mrs House leaving to check into the hotel cant sleep just Wait It doesnt make any sense Suddenly he murders her Whats it all about Why dont we go meet Ted and Marcia get something to eat and talk with them At a m So what Ted was taking her to a show and dinner You want to schlep out to New Jersey This town never sleeps Thats why we dont live in Duluth Plus dont know where Duluth is Lucky me You really saw his face No question m here to tell you It was Mr House No question There was no way you could avoid it He was right there Its obvious How obvious What do you mean Obvious hes committed the perfect murder What do you mean Okay look You have to start with another woman who resembles Mrs House Thats what said It was my idea said what she said Theyre with this woman Maybe having dinner They dont induce a heart attack Thats fiction bullshit She dies spontaneously They had no thought of killing her Maybe they wished she was dead Why Maybe they stood to gain if she died They see an opportunity Mrs House dresses her up in her clothes She hides This is exactly my theory She checks into a hotel We got that far with the exception of the heart attack The husbands planning to go to Paris with this young woman Hes cheating on his wife Instead of finishing this scheme he kills her taking her share of the profits Helen Moss is in on this Good chance shes aware What about Mrs Dalton He claims he took her to the movies Shes his alibi She covered for him when he strangled his wife She said he was at work He introduced her as a colleague colleague who maybe loves him Hes cheating on her too Cheating on two women This guy doesnt look the part Hes gotten away with the perfect murder There are no bodies around and all the paperworks strictly aboveboard Where did you find her Shes a genius She is But he knows that we know He doesnt care Why should he Everythings been neatly disposed of Only he and maybe his mistress know the truth Shes right Hold on We dont know this is true This is just a theory Yeah but its a great theory great theory Everything fits together think its great When come back from the ladies room ll tell you how to trap him Unbelievable Where did you find her Shes really something Its like one thing leads to another m surprised you didnt drool yourselves to death We just had a nice first date knew they would hit it off You were gonna jump into her lap What are you talking about m her editor m a father figure to her The only thing you didnt do is rub your hands together Youre joking Youre jealous of Marcia Its not that m jealous What are we doing here Look whos talking You kept staring at her like she was the Dragon Lady Youre jealous because hes interested in her am not jealous What are you Do you take all your authors to the Caf des Okay ve got it Since hes gotten away with it all we can do is bluff As long as we have no body we have no case What do you mean We pretend he slipped up The molten steel didnt do the job Its possible He saw you there He knows youre onto him Why couldnt you retrieve the body We couldnt have gotten her out wouldve wound up with a few toes and a shoulder What does he know He was probably too scared to be very lucid Hes an amateur He dumped the body and ran off and then somehow you two dug her out Now you can send him to the chair like this woman Shes lurid Let me tell you why he wont believe us cant bluff or lie without giggling No because if we really had the body why tell him Why not go straight to the police If you tell the cops you cant shake him down Shes wicked Look how this works out You go to the law what do you gain They put him in jail What have you got You havent got anything Right But if he wants the evidence and has to pay for it now hes nervous right Theres just so many fallacies in this What Name one Name one Okay The guy looks us straight in the eye and says What body What are you talking about Prove it Thats when we keep bluffing How What do we do We produce the body But where are we gonna get it Madame Tussauds Say we found someone he trusted to corroborate Like who Like his lover Say she said ve seen Lillians body They want for it Why would she do that Remember that book you recommended Murder in Manhattan Max Schindlers book Thats right the phone call You never mentioned that book to me You dont like light reading Since when What is this book Its fantastic It would be so perfect because shes an actress a wouldbe actress We could use his theatre Hes a playwright This is so perfect Your theatre is empty all the time anyhow Thank you Thats great What are we talking about here Listen to this We get her in for a fake audition and you write some lines that dont mean anything And she does them and we taperecord it Listen m listening And then we edit the tape recording up and we make one end of a phone call and play it to Mr House Is it in the book Come on This is perfect That could never work You dont know what hes gonna say In the book they use several recorders Its coordinated You base your plan on a dumb paperback This is great This is great Hes gotten away with murder Our only chance is to nab him when he kills again It provokes him to kill again They catch him the second time Hes gotten away with the first murder You know what m thinking In the book what happens is he kills the two people working the scheme on him But youre not worried about that Its perfect Either that or ve developed Parkinsons No we can handle him He knows youre onto him shake him down He comes after you we nab him Its great Youre wonderful m amazed Its either that or he walks So what youre saying is What youre saying is Oh boy Youre saying you wanna provoke Mr House into trying to murder Larry and me Yeah Perfect Youre not scared are you No m not scared m turning it over in my mind just want to
