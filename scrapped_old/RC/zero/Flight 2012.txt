them access to everything Everybodys curious about Captain Whitaker Well l flew with him in the navy and he is a great pilot ls he a drunk Hes a heavy drinker But maybe l should bring him in ln a minute All right so lets get down to it Lenny What does the union plan to do about this blood test saying Whitaker was high on booze and coke This guys a real peach lm going to kill the toxicology report The testing was done incompetently The toxicology equipment they used was last calibrated in June of lts already months past code Their log that should clearly state who labeled the blood vials

here a few days so l wouldnt worry about it too much l can handle this l like this guy Lenny Makes me want to go out and sniff a few lines and fly a jet Mr Carr were going to fight to push all the fault onto the manufacturer Jackson Ridgefield And you think theyre gonna just open their checkbook and buy us all lunch Good fucking luck Whats my exposure Jim Well the awards to the families could

about my drinking lve been lying about my drinking my whole life Those are difficult images to watch For the record lm Ellen Block hearing officer for this hearing Captain Whitaker good morning Morning What that video captures is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact However according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders at exactly after flying minutes without incident the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of feet per minute in what is considered a full pitch nose down attitude Then at according to the data recorders a decision was made to invert the aircraft The has created an animated simulation that l would like to play at this point Were going to ro it What do you mean Ro it We gotta do something to stop this dive Margaret whats your sons name Trevor Say Iove you Trevor What Iack box Say Iove you Trevor Iove you Trevor You be a good boy Mommy Ioves you Okay here we go ve got contro Oh Lord Jesus flaps Iaps Speed brakes Speed brakes Margaret Power Gear up Gear up Oh Lord Jesus were inverted Were flying Were Ieve We can maintain aItitude Iike AtIanta Center SouthJet We are inverted We are inverted SouthJet did you say inverted That audio is tragic and compelling l chose to play that part of the cockpit recording to highlight a key moment on board flight wherein you say Were going to roll it Here we go lve got control You made a very conscious decision to invert the aircraft to roll the plane upside down is that correct lm not sure if it was conscious But lt was more like instinct What led to that decision l dont recall Let me quote from an investigative summary From until the events on the aircraft are again l quote bold and remarkable By inverting the plane Captain Whitaker arrested the descent and allowed the aircraft to level off enabling him to glide the aircraft away from any populated areas and allowing him to execute a forced landing in an open field l heard a loud metallic bang We pitched nose down No control Yes First Officer Evans testimony confirms the same l want to show you something Nothings happening This remote isnt working Apologies l can do this manually This is the jackscrew on the tail assembly that articulates the horizontal stabilizer also known as the elevator As you can see the threads on this screw are almost entirely gone This part was suggested as a maintenance replacement in January of lt was never replaced lt had an additional lt finally failed Our investigators have concluded that the jackscrew snapped and the elevator was frozen in a fixed position locking the elevator in a down position which forced the plane into a dive The loss of the elevator was and l quote our report catastrophic event from which recovery was improbable and stable flight impossible Mr Whitaker l want to talk about the days leading and the hours leading up to the accident But before l do l want to remind you that you are under oath and that any testimony you give here today will be considered admissible in any subsequent hearings or criminal proceedings Do you understand what that means Captain Whitaker for the record l need you to verbalize your answer lm sorry Yes l understand On the three days leading up to the accident Tuesday October th Wednesday October th or Thursday October th did you consume any alcohol or other intoxicating elements No l did not On the morning of the accident Friday October th did you consume any alcohol or ingest any chemicals or drugs that may have impaired your ability to perform yourjob No l did not Mr Whitaker do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency alcoholism or drug addiction No Okay Mr Whitaker were about done Due to the severe turbulence in the early part of the flight you asked the flight crew to suspend the beverage service on the plane is that correct Yes thats correct l suspended the drink service on the plane Are you aware that our investigators found two single service vodka bottles in the galley trash bin Yes lm aware of that There were five crew members on board that would have had access to the beverage trolley Less than an hour after the accident blood was taken from each of these crew members yourself First Officer Evans Flight Attendant Margaret Thomason and posthumously from Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez Toxicology analysis was performed and three of these tests came back negative one was disqualified for technical reasons and one tested positive for alcohol lt registered a blood alcohol level Are you aware of that Yeah lm aware of it now Miss Marquez was not only a colleague but you knew her outside of work is that correct Outside of work No not really Did you know Miss Marquez had a drinking problem No l did not Did you ever see her drink to excess No l did not Were you aware that she was twice treated for alcohol addiction The last time was months ago and paid for by SouthJet Airlines No l did not ls it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight Could you repeat the question ls it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight lm sorry my what Your opinion Captain Since her toxicology report is the only toxicology report that is admissible in this hearing and she in fact tested positive for alcohol is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank those two bottles of vodka on the plane God help me lm sorry Mr Whitaker l couldnt hear you What did you say l said God help me Yes well however is it your opinion lts my opinion Trina did not drink that vodka Excuse me Mr Whitaker She saved the boys life thats Could you speak louder Captain Whitaker Trina Marquez did not drink the vodka because l drank the vodka What the hell Objection Please be seated sir Sir Captain Whitaker misspoke l drank the vodka bottles Didnt you hear me l said l object Please be seated sir This is not a courtroom Well l object anyway l drank the vodka bottles on the plane Captain Whitaker on the three nights before the accident October th October th October th and th and th l was intoxicated l drank all of those days l drank ln excess On the morning of the accident l was drunk lm drunk now lm drunk right now Miss Block Because lm an alcoholic That was it l was finished l was done lt was as if l had reached my lifelong limit of lies l could not tell one more lie And maybe lm a sucker cause if l had told just one more lie l could have walked away from all that mess and kept my wings kept my false sense of pride And more importantly l could have avoided being locked up in here with all you nice folks for the last months But lm here And lll be here for at least the next four or five years And thats fair l betrayed the public trust l did Thats how the judge explained it to me l had betrayed the public trust The they took away my pilots license And thats fair My chances of ever flying again are slim to none And l accept that lve had a lot of time to think about it all of it lve been doing some writing l wrote letters to each of the families that had lost loved ones Some of them were able to hear my apology Some of them never will l also apologized to all the people that tried to help me along the way but l couldnt or wouldnt listen People like my wife you know My exwife and my son And again like l said you know some of them will never forgive me Some of them will But at least lm sober l thank God for that lm grateful for that And this is going to sound real stupid coming from a man whos locked up in prison but for
