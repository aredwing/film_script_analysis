used with him Do not deviate from them for any reason whatsoever And youre to tell him nothing personal Believe me you dont want Hannibal Lecter inside your head Just do your job but never forget what he is And what is that Oh hes a monster pure psychopath So rare to capture one alive From a research point of view Lecter is our most prized asset We get a lot of detectives here but cant ever remember one as attractive Will you be in Baltimore overnight Because this can be quite a fun town if you have the right guide m sure this is a great town Dr Chilton but my instructions are to talk to Dr Lecter and report back this afternoon see Well lets make this quick then Weve tried to study him but hes much too sophisticated for the standard tests Oh my does he hate us He thinks m his nemesis Crawfords very clever isnt he using you What do you mean sir pretty young woman to turn him on dont believe Lecters seen a woman in eight years And are you ever his taste So to speak graduated from Doctor Its not a charm school Good Then you should be able to remember the rules Do not touch or approach the glass You pass him nothing but soft paper No pencils or pens No staples or paperclips in his paper Use the sliding food carrier If he attempts to pass you anything do not accept it Do you understand me Yes understand sir m going to show you why we insist on such precautions On July he

student body Busy hunting that new one Buffalo Bill What a naughty boy he is Do you know why hes called Buffalo Bill Please tell me The newspapers wont say It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide They said This one likes to skin his humps Why do you think he removes their skins Agent Starling Thrill me with your acumen It ex cites him Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies from their victims didnt No No you ate yours You send that through now Oh Agent Starling you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool No thought that your knowledge Youre so ambitious arent you Do you know what you look like with your good bag and your cheap shoes You look like a rube wellscrubbed hustling rube with a little taste Good nutritions given you length of bone but youre not more than one generation from poor white trash are you And that accent youve tried so desperately to shed pure West Virginia What is your father dear Is he a coal miner Does he stink of the lamp How quickly the boys found you All those tedious sticky fumblings in the back seats of cars while you could only dream of getting out getting anywhere getting all the way to the You see a lot Doctor

about this You dont have to feel any way about it Lecter did it to amuse himself Look know it got ugly today but you mentioned a name at the end Mofet Any followup on her Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patients histories so theres no record of anyone named Mofet but thought the yourself reference was too hokey for Lecter so figured hes from Baltimore and looked in the phone book and

is now believed to have been kidnapped by the serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill Police indicate that the girls blouse has been identified sliced up the back in what has become a grim alltoofamiliar calling card Young Catherine Martin is the only daughter of Senator Ruth Martin the Republican senator from Tennessee Her kidnapping is not considered to be politically motivated but it has stirred the government to its highest levels Reached for comment on the ski slopes of Vermont the president is said to be and quote intensely concerned Just moments ago Senator Martin taped this dramatic personal plea m speaking now to the person who is holding my daughter Catherine is very gentle and kind Talk to her and youll see You have the power You are in charge know you can feel love and compassion You have a wonderful chance to show the whole world that you can be merciful as well as strong that youre big enough to treat Catherine better than the world has treated you You have that power Please My daughter is Catherine Boy thats smart Jesus thats really smart She keeps repeating the name If he sees Catherine as a person and not just an object its harder to tear her up Release my little girl Youre coming into my hospital to conduct an interview and refusing to share information with me for the third time Sir told you this is just a routine followup on the Raspail case He is my patient have rights understand that sir Look am not just some turnkey Miss Starling This is the number for the attorneys office Either you discuss this with him or you let me do my job do you understand If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill in time to save Catherine Martin the senator promises you a transfer to the hospital at Oneida Park New York with a view of the woods nearby Maximum security still applies of course Youd have reasonable access to books Best of all though one week of the year you get to leave the hospital and go here Plum Island Every day of that week you may walk on the beach you may swim in the ocean for up to one hour under team surveillance of course And there you have it copy of the Buffalo Bill case file copy of the senators offer This

there Theres beautiful Terns If help you Clarice it will be turns with us too Quid pro quo tell you things you tell me things Not about this case though About yourself Quid pro quo Yes or no Yes or no Clarice Poor little Catherine is waiting Go Doctor What is your worst memory of childhood The death of my father Tell me about it and dont lie or ll know He was a town marshal One night he surprised two burglars coming out the back of a drugstore They shot him Was he killed outright No he was very strong He lasted more than a month My mother died when was very young My father had become the whole world to me and when he left me had nothing was ten years old Youre very frank Clarice think it would be quite something to know you in private life Quid pro quo Doctor So tell me about Miss West Virginia Was she a large girl Yes Big through the hips Roomy They all were What else She had an object deliberately inserted into her throat Now that hasnt been made public yet We dont know what it means Was it a butterfly Yes moth Just like the one we found in Benjamin Raspails head an hour ago Why does he place them there Doctor The significance of the moth is change Caterpillar into chrysalis or pupa and from thence into beauty Our Billy wants to change too Theres no correlation between transsexualism and violence Transsexuals are very passive Clever girl Youre so close to the way youre gonna catch him do you realize that No Tell me why After your fathers murder you were orphaned What happened next dont imagine the answer is on those secondrate shoes Clarice lived with my mothers cousin and her husband in Montana They had a ranch Was it a cattle ranch Sheep and horses How long did you live there Two months Why so briefly ran away Why Clarice Did the rancher make you perform fellatio Did he sodomise you No He was a very decent man Quid pro quo Doctor Billy is not a real transsexual But he thinks he is He tries to be Hes tried to be a lot of things expect You said that was very close to the way we would catch him What did you mean There are three centers for transsexual surgery Johns Hopkins the University of Minnesota and Columbus Medical Centre wouldnt be surprised if Billy had applied for sex reassignment at all of them and been rejected On what basis would they reject him Look for severe childhood disturbances associated with violence Our Billy wasnt born a criminal Clarice He was made one through years of systematic abuse Billy hates his own identity you see and he thinks that makes him a transsexual But his pathology is a thousand times more savage and more terrifying It rubs the lotion on its skin It does this whenever its told Mister my familyll pay cash Whatever ransom youre asking for theyll pay it It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again Yes it will Precious It will get the hose Mister if you let me go wont press charges promise See my mom is a real important woman guess you already know that Now it places the lotion in
