flow of discussion Willie must be a great boon Oh yes Yes he is So what does the Big Man make of the new novel Youre right Its not fair to ask you should ask him No no no He loves it He just loves it Naturally he has notes Naturally Willie has not asked to read one single page has he Hes very busy with his screenplay Ah yes the adaptation Hows that going Terrific Oh its going terrific Iy You dont know do you He doesnt discuss it with you Whats your point Hes using you Thats rich coming from you Come on its common knowledge he wouldnt be adapting Happy Ending if you hadnt insisted Willie Scotts writing career peaked sometime around Hes a talentless hack without a brain or a conscious who doesnt give a damn about your or your novel Yeah Behind you Hey Willie Is that fruit cake Oh yes Its frozen brought a couple of spares Its for your nose Look m sorry about Willie He shouldnt have hit you Even though you did deserve it He caught me off guard Usually dont go down after the first punch

more ebb and flow Thats not a bad idea You know the scene in the book where her father goes on a bender and doesnt turn up for the mothers funeral Yes remember Would you miss it What What You cant Willie think we need to talk this through know what this is about Janey You havent written a word in two weeks So you want to talk instead of dealing with your blockage How many times am not blocked There was this writer knew got stuck on a Long Lost Sibling story arc Thought it was going to end his career but but he beat it Do you know how How He wrote naked Yeah Yeah right Seriously The idea is you release yourself from the restrictions of the everyday so that you can express your ideas in an uninhibited fashion Oh okay think you just want to be able to sit there and write while you stare at my tits They are great tits Its not a weapon Jade Theres some blood on this stick Tom ve got some business to take care of want it on record that this is going too far okay Shes only just started

coming from a neverevenhasbeen owner of a thirdrate publishing company d have to say thank you Naturally have a few notes Naturally For instance The first page dont get it m just going to get the phone Willie Hi Janey Hi Hows the trip going Did you meet Soderbergh There was no meeting ve been stuck in the arse end of nowhere couldnt get a cab ve been walking for nine hours in the rain my phone died ve only just now found a phone Oh Willie m cold and wet and feeling so so miserable You know the funny things is even though the trip turned out so badly You know it made me realise a few things miss you Janey Youre the best thing in my life and love you Janey lets get married There we go Hes sick Oh come on hes just taking the piss now He said he loves me You heard him Actually didnt Maybe it was in your vivid imagination And love Willie too He makes me happy Any chance of that cup of tea doll Hes a sweetheart Priscilla Listen sweetheart get out the big pen Time to bill the bastards for my first draft just finished the script lifetime with Willie Scott If that doesnt make her miserable nothing will Look know things havent worked out for the two of you but Surely you dont really actually totally completely want her to be unhappy Of course dont mean Oh tu comprends pas Its tricky okay Whatever which is why Shakespeare never left New York again Okay chapter twentyone Read it or be punished Yo Hes only gone and changed the ending Wow All you did was to change the title and she thought you were a complete wanker Thats Juan Kerr He was a nineteenth century South American revolutionary This is going to break her heart Yeah well great Now all youve got to do is make sure she reads it Mission accomplished Yeah Youve given it a happy ending And your point The point is Janes novel doesnt end happily Well who the hell wants to walk out of a movie feeling miserable You have to change it back Oh dont think so That script says more about my love for her than could ever put into words She doesnt know yet does she Do you have any idea what this will do to her To both of you made a mistake and cant take it back But Willie if you truly love her Change it Whats going on here You just dont get her do you Oh get her all right Every night get her Any way up fancy Hit a sick man would you Watch this Remind me does the bridge explode in the novel Hi Janey m home Any chance of a wee cup of tea Willie just dont understand how you can do this over a dumb ending No No you dont Well if its any consolation Janey dont think you and me would have worked out anyway just dont get all that worshipping your pain stuff Daddy issues Tom if she hasnt delivered you have to take Pandemic Medias offer Mark my words never going to happen Well ll have no option but to declare you bankrupt and call in a Receiver Youre my Relationship Manager right Yes So So what should do about my relationship Oh for Gods sake Do you love her Tom Jane Hi Toms not here He should be back any minute of you want to wait No dont think so m heading off for a bit of a break just came to drop this off Its my new novel finished it Thats a relief Between you and me your books the only thing stopping this place going tits up So where shall leave it Just put it on his desk Okay Bye Hold it Jane Jane Bastard Oh Should still be seeing you finished it Leave me alone All want is to be alone

ll go Its eight miles to the nearest village dont expect to see you when wake up Goodnight What the hell were you thinking About the plant About me you idiot Heres the thing You go to some dark places when you write You bring out stuff most people prefer to keep locked up So thought that if made you miserable d be able to finish my novel Well thats genius Yeah well was wrong Of course you were wrong You dont have to be miserable to write You do it because you have to Because it gnaws away at your insides if you try to ignore it Because if you dont write then you might as well be dead What do you mean you were wrong You got the novel didnt you In Tom and Roddyworld the plan was a roaring success Not exactly The last chapter It doesnt work It needs a rewrite How much of it All of it You all right No m bloody not all right and want my chocolate Maybe it would help if we talked it through What have missed think the problem might be that you dont really get to choose your ending It has to follow naturally from what comes before or it doesnt feel true Oh hes so insightful want to start with Darsie Goody dont understand her No kidding mean whys she in love with a man who betrays her so utterly Hes emotionally crippled has an uncomfortable tendency for meanspiritedness He has nice hair Okay so yes maybe there is an element of autobiography Which means youre the reason cant write Me At some point during the last few weeks it dawned on me that when finished this novel we were finished too And some insane part of me doesnt want that to happen Youre my block Tom But want you to finish it Yeah of course you want me to finish it but for what So you can turn a profit ve sold it What ve sold the business No you cant have sold it That stupid company is you Get it back You cant do this to me m on the moral high ground here and m not getting off now You sold it Yeah And you can take all the time you need for the last chapter made it part of the deal Tom didnt sign With Klinsch and McLeish couldnt do it Jane ve spoken to my Relationship Manager If hear the words sad beautiful or music youre a dead man Apparently block you And block you too What What could possibly be more important know how it ends m just going to get my laptop dont care You are on fire Youre pretty hot yourself baby Err Tom Tom what are you doing Tom Oh my God Tom Tom Tom Why is it that the saddest endings always seem the truest In the stories told myself was always the heroine always reaching for my happy ending It didnt turn out that way wont get to spend the rest of my life with him But was
