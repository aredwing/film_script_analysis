The war between sorcerers was fought in the shadows of history and the fate of mankind rested with the just and powerful Merlin He taught his secrets to three trusted apprentices Balthazar Veronica and Horvath He should have trusted only two Veronica and Balthazar witnessed the savagery of a sorcerer beyond evil Morgana le Fay Merlins most deadly enemy We are but servants Merlin Horvath You betray me am no ones servant Well done Now get the spell And so it was Morgana gained sorcerys most dangerous spell known as The Rising giving Morgana the power to raise an army of the dead and enslave mankind Veronica sacrificed herself for Balthazar by drawing Morganas soul into her own body But Morgana began to kill her from the inside To save Veronicas life and to capture Morgana Balthazar trapped them both in the Grimhold an inescapable prison Over time Balthazar fought many sorcerers who tried to free Morgana trapping them in layer upon layer of the doll Eventually he captured Horvath as well As Merlin lay dying he gave Balthazar his dragon ring saying it would guide him to the child who would one day grow to be Merlins successor the Prime Merlinean The Prime Merlinean is the only one who can kill Morgana Balthazar would search for centuries And never it is said will Balthazar waver from his quest for mankind will never be safe until Morgana is destroyed

most dangerous Morganians in history each one locked up in a layer of the doll Horvath wants to free his fellow Morganians and destroy the world This must not happen Yeah For sure The truth is you

missed me m going to give you the basics Strictly Sorcery Put on the ring Nothings going to happen Yeah Kidding Youve heard how people use only of their brains Sorcerers can manipulate matter because theyre born with the capability to use the entire power of their brains Which also explains why molecular physics comes so easily to you So wait Is sorcery science or magic Yes and yes For now all you need is a basic combat spell Making fire What causes molecules to heat up They vibrate Everything we see is in a constant state of vibration thus the illusion of solidity But how do we take that which appears solid and have it burst into flames We will the vibrations to go faster Step one clear your mind Step two see the molecules Step three make them shake Got it No definitely dont got it Trust
