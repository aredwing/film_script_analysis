Corporate the professional way of conducting business The owner of a corporate entity can either be a sole businessman or a lot of shareholders together The sole objective of every business is the same profit Also called the bottomline in the corporate world To improve upon their bottom lines professionals of these corporates often resort to a lot of unprofessional methods too Our story revolves around two corporates who are traditional rivals in the food products business The Sehgal Group of lndustries and the Marwah Group of lndustries Theyre always launching new Products to upstage each other ln the recently concluded elections the party backed by the Sehgals romped home to power While Marwah was dejected Mr Vinay Sehgal was obviously overjoyed The Finance Minister has personally invited him to New Delhi after all Navin my contestant was right We backed the right horse Ashwini has bagged the finance Portfolio thats a plus Poor Marwah lts gonna be difficult for him After the State hes going to be kicked out of the Centre too Congratulations Thank you Thank you very much for your support l am very happy The party has entrusted a huge responsibility to me Oh yes Vinay theres a nice proposal for your company Yes Theres going to be a major change in the Foreign Direct lnvestment policy The American food giant Friscon lnternational are looking for collaborators

coffee go on ln your gain lies our gain Make as much gains as you can and also make the state and the nation gain in the process Thats the objective of our party There was so much disagreement over the disinvestment programme But what will the opposition do lf not disagree with us l had a simple argument The government must provide the industrialists a proper atmosphere to set up industry For example the Maharashtra Bottling and Confectioneries a publicsector undertaking What does it do Makes cakes biscuits and soft drinks And the Maharashtra Twowheeler Ltd Another publicsector company The government l believe ought to show the way to people making scooters and motorcycles is not the governments job ln any case government officials prefer to travel in fourwheelers what good is the manufacture of twowheelers And thus our government has decided to sell all publicsector units to the private sector l will not waste any more of your precious time Else you will accuse me of delivering a speech even at the Cll meeting Glory to lndia Glory to Maharashtra What did your State Finance Minister say He made great promises for the corporate world Will he keep them Whether its lndia or America Steve politicians are politicians This will benefit our companys expansion plans immensely Right sir And their productline matches that of ours Good evening This is Devyani Bakshi from Corporate News and lm here at the Cll meeting tonight with Steve Jones from Friscon lnternational in an exclusive Hi Steve Hi how are you today Very well To start with could you throw some light on your tieup with Sehgal Foods Well Friscon is world number in aerated drinks And we control nearly per cent of the international market So even in lndia we feel like the soft drinks segment will provide a huge per cent of benefit Thats exactly what we are working at with out with Mr Sehgal This Maharashtra Bottling and Confectionary looks like a good proposition Huh Nishi ln fact we qualify in all criteria sir Will you take the last page Thats the criteria of corruption We emerge tops at that too What is that saying corruption is an infallible symptom of a constitutional liberty We are truly liberated Cheers to that lll just come Okay Work on Gulabrao because l have a feeling Marwah is going to move in big time on this piece l dont see you at the club nowadays l was out of town Singapore right How was the trip lt was nice lm told the Sehgals are starting a regional office there Parvez l thought you were doing well as the of Marwah lndustries Since when have you taken up

with you now Exactly why l tell you Nishi Always mix a bit of pleasure with business Believe me lts a highly potent mixture You sound like a confused scientist to me Kumar everybodys drinking And having a great time its such a shame for us Do you drink Yes Also eat nonveg Sure Hey you come here You know who we are right Of course sir Heres what youll do Two bottles of Black Label Two or three grilled chickens Keep it in the van behind that Guys car there hurry it up Kumar you know your way around Just keep watching So youre coming with me tonight lts difficult to make it Mukesh My husbands returning early tonight Make some excuse My wife has also left for Shirdi today Theres nobody at home But my husband Say you have a presentation That You have to work all night ln any case lm giving you an out of turn promotion l know Okay lll wait for you What Marwah Your rival Has entered into a tieup with such a big company The Sehgals are in the habit of taking big strides From the very beginning we have always moved at our own pace So you want to be a tortoise Slow and steady wins the race What Hello Gulabrao Joe How are you l was good Till now Have you met Mr Marwah Mr Marwah Chairman of the Marwah Group of lndustries This is Joe Rajan Hes into corporate surveillance and intelligence Hes a very useful guy in your line of work My card sir Nice meeting you sir Well keep in

such a huge one if you could involve him too Why doesnt your brother talk to me directly Maybe hes afraid of you Dont you think we ought to give him another chance Lets see Yeah okay Everyone deserves a second chance And hes my wifes brother lll have to do something about it Dont worry lll fix it lakh bottles per day huge water reservoir Believe me sir This is worth every rupee we spend Sir happens to be in a backward area The state government is bound to give tax and excise concessions to the company that takes over this unit The price of a soft drink will come down from rupees to rupees And our margin will be more than double Thats true ln addition to that if we acquire this we dont need to set up a new bottling plant Our capital expenditure will be reduced to half The valuation of the plant and machinery alone is about billion l want an accurate valuation of this in Maharashtra Remember there is acres of land around this That too in the industrial belt l have details in this report sir Of the acres of land about acres of land is agricultural Jhunjhunwala and Bajaj are bound to bid for the no doubt But Anand Dahiya will be a very strong contender And above all he is very close to Mr Gulabrao This is very critical for the further expansion of the Marwah Group Get cracking Hansa Okay sir Parvez lmmediately Right away sir The Minister Gulabrao announced a benchmark price of billion That means the minimum bid will be billion Right And there are several requirements for the bidding companies l think only six companies in lndia will be able to qualify Come to think of it sir lf theres anyone who can compete with Sehgal Group its the Marwah Group But after Friscon we are far ahead sir Folks put things in the right perspective Friscon is prepared to spend an extra million dollars on this project if we can pull off the Thats awfully sweet of you Steve l am sure theres an incentive for all of us here Now with your kind permission ld like to make an announcement

been asked to strictly keep off stripping them lll have a word with him Theres an exhibition at Anita Jaitleys artgallery this evening l hope youre coming lll try to When you called this morning l was with Deepa She suspected it was you l was talking to Lobo you see that mare Tanaaz What about her Earlier she used to play along with just about anybody But now shes seen only in Tyagis company What do you think is cooking Jhandu looks like l need to explain it to you at the corporate level Earlier she was a public enterprise So she went with just about anyone Shes now in the private domain So she goes only with Tyagi okay Know what lve heard the bosses say it so often at meetings Lets sleep over the issue What issue they come up with after they sleep l have no idea Now pin it up quickly Else therell be another issue per cent of the soft drink market is concentrated in the western region So this is strategically located Okay what plans do we have for statewise product launches Well first launch wafers and crunchies and later soft drinks Which means well first feed the public fried stuff and when they feel thirsty we sell our softdrinks to them You could say that sir Okay whos our closest rival in this acquisition The Marwah Group Our traditional rivals At the moment theyre thinking of making mineral water at the l see when is the public issue of Friscon due With the product launch ln another six months March Yeah just about The shares are much sought after The bookmakers are quoting to in the gray market Okay so Navin Whats next on the agenda Theres a meeting

into all the aspects And our government treats everybody equally There is no favouritism But go ahead file your bid do not worry lm here lll take care Hail lndia Hail Maharashtra Does business need politics more Or does politics need business lts a question worth pondering As soon as the disinvestment plan in the public sector unit was announced business groups were desperate to acquire it The executives of Marwah and Sehgal began working out the profits the would yield ln order to strengthen their positions all business groups got together to make their best bids But Gulabrao represented a different political party in the state lt was difficult to gauge from his mood as to whom he would entrust this to Sir weve offered Jhunjhunwalas billion for a complete buy off Plus distribution in the south Have they agreed Of course Perfect Please have the agreement ready Parvez will take a look tomorrow and we have a meeting the day after tomorrow Shirley Yes sir this deal file of Jhunjhunwalas is very important Put it away safely lll need this file tomorrow morning Okay sir Hi Nishi Hi Pervez Youre getting more and more beautiful with every passing day Whats the secret Keep

drink ln just six months lf that happens the launch of our product Hl will be postponed by at least a year or two The project might probably not even take off This Parvez is a thorn in the flesh Yeah l must say hes quite sharp Bloody Parvez But he uses his sharpness at the wrong places Nishi youre really nasty okay Nasty with a cause Jokes apart if we launch our drink before Marwah can this could be a major turning point for us Totally sensational lf we can prepare a plan and present it to the boss overnight it wont be very difficult to get his approval Lets make a report Nishi The report l can make But l want you to be the one who presents it But youve done all the hardwork No Ritesh This is a golden opportunity for you This launch is going to be a very big success story And l want you to get the credit for this information and report as far as the boss is concerned Only you ln a nutshell our drink will hit the market in three months That is three months before Marwahs Well launch our drink and capture the market Well get a huge huge first movers advantage lts fine but how is it all going to happen Well import the concentrate of our drink just chill And well pass on the concentrate to our bottlers across the country Whereas Marwah is manufacturing the concentrate of his drink here in lndia Thatll take him six months But Marwahs per bottle cost works out at rupees and ours will cost Agreed Should we increase on our volumes the cost can be cut by per cent atleast And if we launch it on time we can easily achieve our targets Thats okay but that Marwahs about to launch a mintbased soft drink how reliable is this information lts wholly reliable So Marwahs been misleading the market with stories of mineral water bottling What else is he capable of By the way lve already had a word with Steve Jones for the import of the concentrate Hes okay with it Very well sir So what date do we launch the product Ritesh teaser campaign in August And the product launch in October Which means our soft drink will be launched in the market in or months Navin well come out with a public issue with the product launch We can raise atleast billion from the market What dyou think That will be good sir Nishi Ritesh great job Brilliant work Thank you sir Start preparing for the launch Value creation for my shareholders Thats my only priority Although l depend a lot on my

taking the competition by surprise Ladies and gentlemen the countdown has begun lts believed that youre making this announcement only because you did not bag the business leader award Look one does not get emotional in business lts a hardcore business decision After our tie up with Friscon we feel this is the time to launch our product lts got nothing to do with the award Youll get the brochures and all publicity material wait for it Thank you all So this was Mr Vinay Sehgal chairman of the Sehgal Group of lndustries Though he completely denies to have any personal reasons for the sudden announcement of the soft drink launch its now quit clear that the simmering war between two corporate giants is now out in the open With cameraman Prem Mishra this is Tanya Khanna Times Now Mumbai Mr Marwah the Sehgal group was about to launch their product next year right Yes but this is a mintbased drink The plant and machinery has been bought from our own suppliers We were about to send advances to the bottling plants And theyve gone ahead and cracked deals with them Such a lot of coincidences l cant digest it Joe ls there anyone you suspect Nobody except my coreteam knew about this project of ours Obviously theyre the source of the leakage Very well Mr Marwah Give me all the details you can give me on them lll give you a confidential report in just two weeks Dont worry Just Chill is a massbased product Every agegroup ought to identify with it Sir media coordination how will we be able to manage all that in just days One works best under pressure That has been my experience Well do it All well have to do is work hours a day Sehgal was terribly offended at not getting the award What else could explain the announcement to launch a softdrink in days without any preparation or strategy Ad campaigns marketsurveys sampling tests efforts were on in fullswing to give the product a nationwide launch On the other hand Marwah was taking a suspicious look at his own top brass with the help of Joe Rajan He wanted to know how the secret of his softdrink project had reached the Sehgal group Parvez how well do you know Nishigandha Dasgupta of Sehgal Foods Well sir socially Thats it Like one competitor knows another thats it When you were in Delhi recently for the branch office meeting did you meet Nishigandha there Pardon me Well no sir You had dinner at Delhis Shangrila Hotel with Nishigandha you then met this model in the discotheque and she subsequently followed you into your room That model was spotted with Nishigandha the very same evening You were

control guys from our plant saying that they have found heavy traces of pesticides in our soft drink The has refused to provide us the license sir the pesticides are in the water source which makes it hard to detect Despite having a water treatment system at the plant Sir our water treatment system is not equipped to filter these pesticides Consultants say that insecticides and pesticides are indiscriminately used in the fields of Panvel and Khopoli Due to prolonged use these chemicals have penetrated the water table These are very dangerous chemicals sir Studies say it can even lead to cancer lt could also affect the immune systems What do we do Navin what would you suggest What should we do Sir we must find an alternative immediately Thatll take some time too The product launch is
