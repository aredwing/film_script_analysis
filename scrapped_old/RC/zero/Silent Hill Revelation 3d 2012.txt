was originally a prison colony built on ground taken from the native Indians They called it The Place of the Silent Spirits Never build on ancient Indian burial grounds thought everyone knew that It says here Religious zealots called The Order of Valtiel secretly ran the town for the last hundred years They were waiting for a child to be born to be a vessel for their god Who would then be resurrected and make the world anew It sounds like one of those crazy doomsday cults Yeah Sounds like it Theres a newspaper article Fire in the coal mines got out of control The whole place is still burning deep underground Everyone had to leave My dad doesnt believe that though No He says the town was cursed by the power of a demon child Her names Alessa This Order tried to cleanse her with fire but they failed And Alessas revenge was to summon a world of darkness filled with terrifying creatures This one it says is her guardian and executioner We should stop No want to keep going m tired need rest You need rest You think theyll find us Someone will eventually Do you think were far No No think were really close And dont think you should go What think your dads right You shouldnt go to Silent Hill need to find him He wants you to run Vincent No listen to me The Order they want you think thats why they took Harry To make you come back dont have a choice Dont you understand that

our damnation You all got what you deserved Yes And became the mother of the demon But you are her daughter What are you talking about Alessa didnt die in the fire And she suffered so much The pain was only matched by her rage And with that rage her power grew beyond all comprehension Alessa knew there was a pad of her that could still be free from pain So she took the best innocent pan of her soul placed it into a newborn orphan child You You were secretly taken from here to be raised by loving but unaware parents Youre the only pad of Alessa that feels love You balance her hate But you should never have come back because now youve given the Order what they could never have way to destroy Alessa and you Where is my father There is nothing you can do to save him without damning
