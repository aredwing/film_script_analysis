by chi chi boo Song Title Real In Rio All the birds of the feather i Do what they love most of all i We are the best at rhythm and laughter i Thats why we love Carnival i All so clear we can sing to i Some adventures reborn i Dance to the music passion and knowledge i Show us the best you can do i Everyone here is on fire i Get up and join in the fun i Dancing with strangers dont mess with danger i Magic could happen for Rio i In Rio all by itself itself Your dancing and knowing i You cant find it anywhere else i Yes Rio in Rio i You know something else You can feel it happening i You can feel it all by yourself i Its okay its okay Shhh ll take care of you Stupid clock Good morning Blu You Tyler Blu Gandersen You know these vitamins are good for you Uuh whats this Gotcha Arghhh Enjoy the
