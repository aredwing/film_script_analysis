proud of that Listen to me carefully have got an idea Larry found out who The Snake is He was trying to get him was caught bumped off How does that sound Sounds fine It has one great advantage Before this The Snake had always left the messy work to others And when they asked for a greater share of the lolly or if they got to big for their boots he rubbed them out In that case it is the first time he has been forced to do his own work Yes but dont forget Lomm Every criminal makes at least one mistake Yes what is it Lets have it The analysis is ready Sir Go on then Go on Its a case of poisoning

how lovely Inspector Elford of Scotland Yard Madam Show him in James How do you do Forgive my intruding have to ask Mr Sutton a few important questions Oh dear Mr Sutton shall we talk here or m sure Mrs Mulford will not mind if well remain here Wouldnt it be much nicer if we sat down We will be more comfortable Please Inspector Thank you Mr Sutton Inspector wont you please be seated My aunt really meant her imputation Thank you Mr Sutton would you mind telling when you last saw Thomas Leslie When did see him last That was mean alive You mean to say Leslie is dead An hour ago at Mulford Quay one of your packing crates was accidentally smashed Into that crate someone had packed a python and a dead body Thomas Leslie was hoping you could explain what Leslie was doing in that packing crate What sort of a question is that Inspector If could tell you that had also known who murdered him Did you say murdered Mr Sutton didnt say anything was trying to Just a moment ve got a question too Is this an official inquiry or what must first know what function you are m a friend of this lad m afraid that wont do In point of fact we have every reason to suppose that my colleague Sergeant Leslie was murdered You really mean that you have sent one of your men into this ladys house Thats outrageous Youll pardon me Sir Our methods complain to your superiors As you wish have good influence on the government Very useful Sir Mr Sutton one more question and thats all Is it reasonable to suppose that the python that attacked Sergeant Leslie crushed him and caused his death No Normally speaking no large snake like a python will compress its prey until its ready to eat it must add Thank you thats all Thats all need for now Mr Sutton Please forgive me again the intrusion Goodbye Sir m happy to have met you Goodbye Mr Sutton is not here Madam know Thats why came Can rely on you Brownie But of course you can Mrs Mulford There is every likelihood that an inquiry will take place here An inquiry Yes Scotland Yard is convinced that someone among us murdered Mr Leslie But Mrs Mulford Whatever anyone may ask you remember dont want any scandalous reflections on my husband Brownie His name is never to come into it Depend on me for that Mrs Mulford Thank you Brownie Youre a good man And of course you havent seen me Good day This time ll take things into my hands And nobody is going to anticipate us No Sir Nobody Take this please The riddle of the death on Mulford Quay Thats much better Thats perfect Sir Continue One of the finest young officers of Scotland Yard was found dead in a packing crate this morning All in capitals giant python curled around its poor victim and crushed young Leslie to death What No complement you Sir Thank you What are you reading there Harras Give it

this morning Just one day ll Thats hardly worth it obviously suspected that my th husband the Duke Candy had one single hobby murder And when saw the open grave in the cellar realised that the next victim would be myself Yes me the only person whose evidences could take him to the gallows Oh its exciting Beryl Whats in the next chapter Revealing that would spoil it What will you title it Did you decide The Red Killer The Red Killer enchanting At least tell me one thing How does your red killer gets hunted down m not sure yet Very likely ll shoot him What You bump him off No thats too good for the this creature m sure have a better idea My plan for him is to saw him into little pieces Aunt Nancy Who is that in the middle of the night m sure that its your red killer Auntie you cant open the door No Who will then James is asleep and see you are anxious to do so Please dont go Call Frank How nervous the young ones are these days Its curious Yes yes yes m coming What was that Who fired that shot Shot You really are nervous my dear But m sure heard it The wind snatched the door out of my hand found this under the door Read it for me Frank more hours Sutton and then you will die Another cheerful would look for you is it Mr Sutton Do you think that maybe all this is just an unpleasant joke Its unlikely this would be a joke Its quite certain The Snake took your mamba You couldnt be positive of it And how do you say that Thats my secret Mr Sutton But whats bothering me now is the question of your security How are we going to protect you You think thats really necessary Yes Would you please let us know every time you decide to go anywhere mean to or from your office or your home Naturally We will be watching you from now on As the saying has it watching every move you make That will be all for the time being Many thanks for your visit and please not a single word to anybody that you have been here Is that clear Its perfectly clear Inspector Goodbye and thank you Goodbye Mr Sutton Now whats up Here is Mr Green with some curious information on Leslies death Tell me hope you to help us By the way Mr Green pathologists always have the last word Agree In this case yes You see if you wish to be exact we should say Leslie died times bit to many what Yes First through a fracture of the spinal column then through a snake bite lastly through a compound fracture of the skull Inspector But or hours before rigor mortis had already set in Do you mind explaining how a man dies of a snake bite when theres no snake present By forcing the poison through the epidermis and thereby into the blood By forcing it you said With pressure Yes Is that what you mean Yes that could be it Yes And the only one who kept calm was Frank mean Mr Sutton Yes men seem to like playing the hero Maybe But he still thinks this whole thing is nothing but a ridiculous joke But he did go to Scotland Yard Miss Stedman Thats Mr Sutton Miss Stedman is here Mr Sutton Thank you Well Beryl What a surprise Please come in here To what do owe the honour of your visit have appointed myself your guardian Oh Yes want to keep an eye on you m afraid you come a bit late Inspector Elford has taken the

But you have told her about it She told me that you where there What Yes Just a minute please Did you want to see me No No Well d like to find out how you learned that ve been to Scotland Yard From Miss Stedman What But Miss Trent you told me about that now You must be making an error How could have known about it Frank assure you Its all right Beryl Just stay calm You must believe wasnt lying m

with you Yes want to and Aunt Nancy agrees Oh Frank m frightfully happy Mr Sutton may speak to you How did you get in that state slight mishap at work What do you think of The Snake threatening you Mr

manuscript were typed on one and the same machine That must be an error This is unbelievable Unbelievable or not m certain But besides the matter of the raised there are other characteristics that support my proposition Look here If these are really May complete my analysis Sir m sure the manuscript and paper you gave me to verify were taped by two completely different persons What did you say The person who typed the manuscript was a touchtypist The strokes are extremely light Each stroke was hard hammered down Something like the hunt and picksystem used by police constables beg you pardon
