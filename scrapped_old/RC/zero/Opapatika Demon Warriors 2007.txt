The world where we live is in fact overlapped by another world where humans live together with Opapatikas both bad and good like humans was just a human in the middle of a war wondering when this war would end Humans cannot repress their desires Mr Detective Why do you want to know about us Techit Or do you want to know how to go beyond your capability Humans curiosity is infinite The desire never ceases The question is what can desire get us If you want to start a new life you have to forget everything in the past Do you believe in the next world According to traditional beliefs people can be born into this world in one of four forms Sungsetacha born from sweat and dampness Untacha from hatching of an egg Chalaputta from the womb And the sudden birth out of nowhere is called Opapatika Demon Warriors The fourth form Opapatika doesnt happen to everyone Only special ones can cross the boundary What is my desire To chase my dream To chase my dream of eternal bliss Welcome to the next world What you dont see doesnt mean its not there This world has existed before Earth and its evolving at its pace And the Opapatikas Iive among humans When one becomes an Opapatika he unknowingly signs a contract with death Every human has hidden potential For humans who have become Opapatikas their hidden powers will be multiplied to the supernatural level Its all your fault Jiras m sensing your feeling Its full of hate and pain Is this my power reading peoples minds It has been a long time since ve met a person like you Atchatikayan or intuition is your power The sixth sense that comes in exchange for the other five senses Exchange Yes In exchange for losing each of the five senses each time you use this ability Everything in this world comes with a price Nothing comes without an exchange This is the sin of suicide It is not the way to truly be free What m asking you to do is to find four Opapatikas and follow a woman named Pran Its a deal If what you asked me will lead to what am looking for Dont be wasting time finding out what my power is One day you will know Techit Techit may introduce you to Thuwachit He is a human He will give you advice Your task is to find the Opapatikas Just leave the rest to Thuwachit Master Sadoks long lifespan allowed him to be able to tell who could be an Opapatika His name Sadok means a hundred years And his life had that much time too He wanted to live a hundred more years Or if possible to eternity Instead he only had eight days left During this time was ordered to capture all Opapatikas After Master Sadok turned Techit into an Opapatika the great war between humans and Opapatika started Paison was a contract killer He killed like a devil He killed to release sufferings inside If you wanted someone dead just drop the order into his wifes skull Every time he killed someone the wounds he caused would return on his body Aruth was weak and sensitive in daylight At night he was vicious and ruthless like a monster He woke up every morning with blood all over his body never remembered what he had done the night before Ramil lived a wild and reckless life Iike the specter shadowing him But the more he used the specter the more his body became like it Jiras a demon who possessed the ultimate power which caused him eternal suffering Because it was the power of immortality Techit who yearned to discover the secrets of life after suicide dared to sell his soul and humanity He was proud of his mindreading ability But the more he read peoples minds the faster he would lose his five senses The past is eating all of us It is the first thing we have to cope with to start anew But there is nowhere in the world could live too live in this world the Opapatika world which humans try to enter It is the world where animals humans monsters demons and angels live together peacefully But those who enter through suicide will be tormented by the sins they commit Techits task was to search My task was to hunt have lost many of my men trying to hunt Opapatikas for Master Sadok Even though people can be reborn into Opapatikas each Opapatika has a different lifespan They might have a new life and power but they can die and be killed His power is seeing each enemys death spot with perfect killing skills Once he fires at you your life will end in an instant repeat the target is highly dangerous Be very careful Paison was gifted with the power to see each enemys death spot But the death mark and the pain he caused would painfully turn up on his body as well Paison Paison Just one person can change your life forever And even though he knew the consequences of his killings he seemed to be willing to torment himself Do you like to play games Lets play a game Youre not scared For us what you do is a curse If its like what you said will think of it as a game Whatever happens will play to the end Only the Opapatikas could distinguish their kind While we were chasing them the Opapatikas contacted and warned each other For Techit what he desired and searched for was utterly nonsense cant take the honor Only special people can capture the Opapatikas Keep your power to use when it is suitable for a suitable cause Because your superhuman power could destroy you too Ramil knew the more he used his power the more hideous he would become But he never shied away from this selfdestruction as if he wanted to exit this world as soon as possible Quick Fire Get down Fire Take him away Like he said He came to warn us about these scumbags Theyre really going after you and me Who are they dont know but ll kill them all Thank you for the loyalty youve always given me In the past had been worrying that one day would be gone like them But today it doesnt look like that anymore will serve you the best that can That was the last voice he heard Whats the first damage The first damage caused from your mind reading has started hasnt it What sense have you lost What is it Only people like us can meet each other It is fate This is another form of Opapatikas They didnt realize that the sin of suicide is having to live in hell Miss Duangkamol Mhaichee May this merit be spared from my relatives May my relatives be well and at peace Our loved ones even though they are gone we still miss them every day Our lives go on Someone once told me if you need revenge or want someone dead just write your wish to the devil And the devil will make your wish come true Sometimes revenge gets us nowhere You also want the devil to help you ve lost someone Were people with nowhere to go Stuck in this world with no way out Like souls in limbo Cant get away from all this nonsense shit Why are you saying that for dont want you to get involved with that woman And l have to obey you Its not easy for you to forget the hell youve been through But if you dont listen to me ll do everything to stop you In daytime Aruth would be haunted by the vicious acts he did at nighttime At nighttime he would contemplate whether his weakness would allow him to live another night His viciousness and kindness Ionged for one another Like my dream is becoming reality Or is it reality dont know what want want to get away from what am now The world doesnt disappear only when we close our eyes cant remember my feelings at night Only that its a nightmare Its so real So scary m scared want to freeze time at this moment want to stay with you like this dont want you to change Hey Huh In case you need it Get them before sunset Maybe should finish you here Get away Who knows This nonsense can be fun too Guess you dont like being alive Even though youre not humans maybe you should think about your lives Hey The question is whos quicker You or my gun Let me pull the trigger and see if the specter can stand it You can read minds right Why dont you read this pricks mind why hes after me To sacrifice us to his master Pitiful His last smell was the smell of blood know cannot lie to you But this is what we believe and it works It is what keeps me alive until today This time its smelling The sense of smelling Your intuitive power exterminates your other senses Now you only have three senses left In fact you either cant smell or is it because you are adapted to being one of us Would you like to try some Maybe it might bring back some of your lost senses Peoples minds are hard to understand Techit You must know what m thinking right now You Youre the devil Isnt love powerful enough Please release me ve warned you Immortal Silence might be the sweetest sound for us now Emptiness might make us think hardest Does it have to be like this Youll never understand It might be the only thing we do without reasons Knowing what others think is painful It is better not to know anything Have we met before You lie Your eyes lie too This would be the last thing he saw And his eyes went blind by the thing he thought beautiful What you think youre doing think hard What the hell It is fate that they found one another Theyre scars They happen after kill someone The death mark will appear on the same spot on my body It the law of karma You do something unto others it comes back to you Why dont you stop it Why are you being like this Paison Paison Just one person can change your life forever People can change Its just how we cope with our change Its sad that we have to be stuck in this world But it might be better than being reborn indefinitely Its a long time since we last met Jiras am so jealous of your pathetic immortality The dead world and the living world are not so different How many lives does one have Whats the truth You want to know my pain Jiras had been an Opapatika forever He didnt know the beginning or the end From darkness to the twilight of time You have to forget everything in the past Do you believe in the next world At that time Master Sadok didnt foresee that the power he attained would not be worth seeking It came with suffering from the gravest sin If we have to start anew after a mistake it means we have been living in failure You will have to stop using your power Or else you would suffer like this Will my weakness in the daytime allow me to live on dont know But wont leave you When was the last time saw sunrise Do you even remember your last breath as a human No You want to say something to your other side Sometimes we are not aware of our desires This is life We cant get everything we want must be the unneeded side think you are the deep side of him At times was unsure of my duty have lost many of my men hope this would be the last war of my life was ready to die but only as a human will never understand what Opapatikas think cant see why they want to be immortal But wished could release my master from pain What you have done for me is invaluable would be long gone if not for the life you gave Same here Without you would have been rotten in this body Thuwachit my eternal conqueror Is this the last day Well find out soon if this is the beginning or the end The war that was going to happen would determine whether this was Master Sadoks last day What about Pran There are so many secrets in the Opapatika world And this one of them Anyone eating the heart of an Opapatika will recieve that Opapatikas power The desire never ceases The question is what can desire get us If you want to start a new life you have to forget everything in the past Do you believe in the next world Isnt love powerful enough It is heartbreaking to know what you have been fighting for doesnt exist Life is a pretense We often pose as people who doesnt exist What youre seeing here Do you not know or are you pretending to be unaware that this woman is a charade The past is eating all of us It is the first thing we have to cope with to start anew Knowing what others think could be painful Maybe it is better not to know anything dont like not knowing myself not knowing my desires want to get away from what am Revenge gets us nowhere The devil will make your wish come true It was too late for them to realize the deception Love is such the easiest trap woman called Pran was Master Sadoks secret Master Sadoks power was creating illusions Its the secret Techit had tried to discover He lured all of you to the trap He played with your weaknesses so you could become the sacrifices for his rotting body was never attracted to that woman ve tried to warn you but you didnt listen If you dont believe me now ll kill you all so he cant eat you to break the curse Its all your fault Jiras You made me like this ve been suffering with this rotting body and must eat other Opapatikas to survive You did this before too You did it to break the curse of being immortal dont believe this It doesnt make sense This is all nonsense You can read my mind can read your movements too What youre about to do is worse than what you hate Opapatika Its your speaking this time isnt it ll never become one of you You never valued being human long time ago a devil tried everything just like what m doing now to give hope to the hopeless But now the devil is rejecting what he has done used to revere you gave my life to you Now its your turn to sacrifice your life for my immortality Do you think am contented being an immortal wouldnt want to be had known how excruciating it would be Paison Just one person can change your life forever never believed a human cant kill an Opapatika What kind of man were you before you became an Opapatika Do you believe in the next world At least got to know what kind of life have to face after being an Opapatika For me the war has ended fully realize that living a human life is the most wonderful thing But for Jiras he must endure eternal suffering in this world The real immortality can only be born out of righteousness There is no other way Kitsho Manusapa Patilapo lt is of great difficulty to attain humanity Human life is valuable Committing suicide is thus a sin
