how hungry am Eat Youll find out Speaking of sex Weve been married only weeks Barely weeks Everything is barely weeks We have minutes to live We dont want to start counting the times do we And having solemn discussions on the subject No we wanna do it And we will We shall We wanna have it Sex Yes Because there isntime not to have it Time is a thing that grows scarcer every day What you dont know this like that bookshop Do you know why Because its semiunderground You feel hidden You like to hide From what Sometimes only noise Youre one of those silent wistful children glued to the shadows And you dont know dont think about it Think about one thing and tell me what it was Alright one thing When was four figured out how much weight on each of the planets in the Solar System Thats nice like that Such science and ego combined When are we going to the lake Fuck the lake thought we like it there after all the planning the construction To get away to be alone together Its quiet at the lake Its quiet in town The way we live yes suppose High enough far enough What about your car Not so quiet surely You spend a lot of time there had the car prousted Yes The way they build a stretch is this Take a vehicle base unit cut in half with a huge throbbing saw device And they add a segment to lengthen the chassis by ten elven twelve feet Whatever desired dimension Twentytwo feet if you like While they did this to my car sent the word that they had to proust is Corkline it against street noise Its lovely actually love that The vehicles are armored of course This complicated the corklining But they managed in the end Its a gesture thing a man does Did it work How could it work no This city eats and sleeps noise Makes noise out of every century Makes the same noises that were made in the seventeen century along with other noises that where developed since then No But dont mind the noise The noise energizes me Important thing is that its there Cork Thats right The cork This is what finally matters Is this what wanted Tell me what you wanted Duck consomm with an herb twist Its true you know You do actually reek of sexual discharge Its not the sex you think ve had Its the sex want thats what you smell on me Cause the more look at you the more know about us both Tell me what that means Or dont No dont And the more wanna have sex with you Because thats a certain kind of sex that has an element of cleansing Its the antidote to disillusion The counterpoison You need to be inflamed dont you This is your element Where are you going after the bookstore Because theres a hotel was going to the bookstore Period was in the bookstore was happy there Where were you going To get a haircut Do you need a haircut need anything you can give me Be nice need all the meanings of the inflamed Theres a hotel just across the avenue We can start over Or finish with intense feeling thats one of the meanings To arouse a passionate feeling We can finish what we barely started Two hotels in fact We have a choice dont think want to pursue this No you dont You wouldnt Be nice to me specter is haunting the world specter is haunting the world specter is haunting the world We want to think about the art of moneymaking The greeks have a word for it Chrimatistikos But we have to give the word a little leeway Adapt it to the current situation Because money has taken a turn All wealth has become wealth for its own sake Theres no other kind of enormous wealth Money has lost its narrative quality the way painting did once upon a time Money is talking to itself want this car which love The glow of the screens love the screens The glow of cybercapital So radiant and seductive understand none of this Does it ever stop Does it slow down Of course not Why should it Its fantastic But you know how shameless am in the presence of anything that calls itself an idea The idea is time Living in the future Look at those numbers running Money makes time It used to be the other way around Clock time accelerated the rise of the capitalism People stopped thinking about eternity and began to concentrate on hours Measurable hours man hours using labor more efficiently Its cybercapital that created the future What is the measurement called a nanosecond Ten to the minus nine power What One billionth of a second understand none of it But it tells me how rigorous we need to be in order to take adequate measure of the world around us There are zeptoseconds Good m glad Yoctoseconds One septilionth of a second Because time is a corporate asset now It belongs to the free market system The present is harder to find It is being sucked out of the world to make way for the future of uncontrolled markets and huge investment potentials The future becomes insistent This is why something will happen soon Maybe today To correct the acceleration of time and bring nature back to normal more or less You have to understand The more visionary the idea the more people it leaves behind This is what the protest is all about Visions of technology and wealth the force of the cybercapital that will send people to the gutter to retch and die What is the flaw of human rationality What It pretends not to see the horror and death at the end of the scheme it builds This is a protest against the future They want to hold off the future They want to normalize it keep it from overwhelming the present The future is always a wholeness a sameness were all tall and happy there This is why the future fails It can never be the cruel happy place we want to make it What would happen if theyd knew the head of Packer Capital was in the car We know what the anarchist have always said Yes Tell me The urge to destroy is a creative thing This is also a hallmark of capitalist thought Enforced destruction Old industries have to be harshly eliminated New markets have to be forcibly claimed and old markets have to be reexploited Destroy the past Make the future This is the thing about genius Genius alters the terms of its habitat Technology is crucial the civilization why Because it helps us to make our fate We dont need God or miracles or flight of the bumblebee but it is also crouched and undecidable It can go either way Youve been talking about the future being impatient pressing upon us That was theory am your chief of theory deal in theory Its not original Whats original He did it didnt he Its an inappropriation He poured the gasoline and lit the match All those Vietnamese monks one after another in all their lotus positions Imagine the pain Sit there feel it Immolating themselves endlessly

cigars know everything thats ever said or written about you know what see in your face after years of study You worked for me doing what Currency analysis worked on the baht The baht is interesting loved the baht But your system is so microtimed that couldnt keep up with it couldnt find it It is so infinitesimal Then began to hate my work and you and all the numbers on my screen and every minute of my life One hundred satang to the baht Whats your real name You wouldnt know it Tell me your name Sheets Richard Sheets Means nothing to me Tell me do you imagine that stole ideas from you Intellectual property What does anyone imagine hundreds things a minute Whether imagine a thing or not its real to me have syndromes Where they real From Malaysia for example The things that believe become facts They have the time and space of facts Youre forcing me to be reasonable dont like that have severe anxieties that my sex organ is receding into my body But its not Shrinking into my abdomen But its not Either it is or not know it Show me dont have to look There are folk beliefs There are epidemics that happen men in the thousands in real fear and pain Alright Alright People like you cant happen understand this believe it but not the violence No the gun The gun is all wrong Youre not a violent man Violence is meant to be real based on real motives on forces in the world that what make us want to defend ourselves or take aggressive actions The crime you want to commit is cheap imitation Its a stale fantasy People do it because other people do it Its just another syndrome its a thing you caught from others It has no history Its all history the whole thing is history You are foully and berserkly rich Dont tell me about your charities have no charities You dont resent the rich thats not your sensibility Whats my sensibility Confusion This is why youre unemployable Why Because you wanna kill people Thats not why m unemployable Then why Because stink Smell me Even when you selfdestruct you have to fail more lose more die more stink more than others Inin the old tribes the chief that destroyed more property than the other chiefs was the most powerful What else You have everything to live for have nothing and neither Thats another reason to kill you Richard want to be known as Benno Youre unsettled cause you feel you have no role You have no place But you have to ask yourself whose fault you that is Cause in fact theres very little in the society that you have to hate Think Think Violence needs a cause truth Theres nothing in the world but other people had this thought one day It was the thought of my life m surrounded by other people Its buy and sell Its lets have lunch thought look at them and look at me Light shines through me on the street m whats the word pervious to visible light thought all these other people thought How do they get to be who they are Its banks and car parks Its airline tickets and their computers Itsrestaurants filled with people talking Its people signing the merchant copy Its people taking the merchant copy out of the leather folder and then signing it and separating merchant copy If m the customer copy and putting the credit card back in their pocket this alone could do it Its people who have doctors that order tests for them This alone m helpless in their system that makes no sense to me You want me to be a helpless robot soldier and all could be was helpless o Its women shoes Its all the names they have for shoes Its all those people in the park behind the library Talking in the sun Your crime has no conscience You havent been driven to it by some oppressive social force hate to be reasonable Youre not against the rich Nobody is against the rich Everybody is ten seconds away from being rich or so that everybody thought No Your crime is in your head Another fool shooting up a diner because Bullets flying through the walls So useless and stupid Even your weapon is a fantasy What is it called What are the attachments mounted on the barrel What are they called what do they do Alright dont have the manhood to know these names Men know these names You have the experience of manhood cant think that far ahead Its all can do to be a person Violence needs a burden It needs a purpose What are you doing dont know Maybe nothing My prostate is asymmetrical So is mine What does it mean Nothing it means nothing Its harmless harmless variation Nothing to worry about At your age why worry You should have listened to your prostate You tried to predict movements on the yuan by drawing on patterns from nature Yes of course the mathematical properties of tree rings Sunflower seeds The limbs of galactic spirals ve learned this with the baht loved the crossharmonies between nature and data Youve taught me this Youve made this form of analysis horribly and sadistically precise But you forgot something along the way What The importance of the lopsided The thing thats skewed a little You were looking for balance Beautiful balance equal parts equal sides know this know you But you should have been tracking the yuan in its ticks and quirks little quirk misshape The misweave Thats where the answer was In your body in your prostate But still have to shoot you Dont you ever walked through the park behind the library and see all those people setting in their little chairs and drinking at those tables on the terrace after work and hear their voices mingling in the air and want to kill them No m having my Korean panic attack Thats from holding in my anger all those years But not anymore You have to die no matter what can tell you my situation has changed in the course of a day have my syndromes you have your complex Icarus falling You did it to yourself Meltdown in the sun You will plunge three and half feet to your death Its not very heroic Is it Even if theres a fungus between my toes that speaks to me Even if the fungus told me to kill you Even then your death is justified because of where you stand on Earth For your apartment and what you paid for it For you daily medical checkups This alone Medical checkups every day For the limousine that displaces the air that people need to breath in Bangladesh This alone Dont make me laugh Dont make you laugh You just made that up Youve never spend a minute of your life worrying about other people Alright But the air you breath this alone the thought you have Is there a fungus that speaks to you m serious People hear things They hear God Anyway youre already dead You look like someone already dead Someone dead a hundred years Many centuries dead Kings dead Royals in their pajamas eating mutton Have ever used the word mutton in my life Came in my head out of nowhere Mutton wanted you to heal me Save me wanted you to save me Subtitle by ramirez
