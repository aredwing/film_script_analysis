He can channel the energy Hes the best medium ll do it Are you as strong as Takayama Yes That doesnt mean youll be better than the boy What if saw the video All right All we need now is water Water Sea water doesnt permeate as well We need fresh water to absorb Sadakos bitterness Guide the energy into the water It will dissolve there And Sadako will disappear All right Yes Take your places Remember that m on your side Begin Close your eyes Remember what you saw What did you see Yes Your father and mother are dead Youre all alone What did you see Its that womans fault your mother died
