The Professor No not yet ll tell him as soon as he finishes Mans greatest new hope is the recapture of physical youth This hope is afforded by the heterograft But the heterograft that is to say the transplanting of living tissues or organs from one human being to another has hitherto been possible only when the two subjects in question demonstrate a perfect biological compatibility What we must now do is modify the organism receiving foreign tissues One method is to use heavy radiation bombardment to destroy the antibodies which form an obstacle to the heterograft To achieve this end however the intense radiation required is such that the patient cannot survive So exsangunination is practised The patient under radiation is drained of the last drop of blood There was a call for you Professor The forensic people you know the morgue Youre to go right away Your paper was a perfect tonic Thrilling wasnt it Carlo What a wonderful future you showed us As to the future Madame we cannot wait that long Hes changed since his daughter vanished he makes strange remarks Its a strange business but thats how it looks to me Gnessiers daughter vanished from the clinic her face an open wound The lack of facial tissue of course confirms your supposition The car crash the facial burns then prolonged immersion in water And the rats dont forget the rats True Yet the description of this drowned girl fits Simone Tessot asked the Tessot girls father to come in something doesnt sit right Its odd that the body should have been naked but for a mans coat Why should Gnessiers daughter disfigured in a car accident feel the need to strip naked before drowning herself in her despair And that vast open wound in place of a face is odd too The edges are so clean that it might have been done by a scalpel Here he is Doctor Lherminier Inspector Parot from the Missing Persons Bureau deeply regret the unfortunate circumstances occasioning this meeting Please explain This morning two bargemen retrieved the body of a girl from the Seine The period of immersion tallies with your daughters disappearance The description also tallies facial tissue destroyed the eyes undamaged It is her
