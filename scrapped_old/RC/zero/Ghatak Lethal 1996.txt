were told that names of your party members figure in the Jain diaries So whats new Let the other diary be opened and see the names popping out what Are we going to have another scandalous diary lts not the diary lts politics Politicians have all been exposed All politicians will be imprisoned now for the bribes theyve taken Then what are we to do about it Lets form a Corporation Everybody else is doing it too That will even help your unaccounted money be effectively invested Lets make movies and serials we can always find good stories Never mind that Lets wrap up this story first Godbole lm prepared Sir lm only waiting for the violence to begin we will not given in we will have our land what is your name Sachdev lve met you times in the last months And you have asked me my name each of those times You always managed to remember my name during your election campaigns You have forgotten everything now including our problems l remember your problem You want possession of a land somewhere that Not a land somewhere Mr Patel lm only talking of Gol Chowk The place where we have earned our livelihood for the last years lt feeds no less than a hundred and fifty families And what was the place earlier Dumping ground of the citys refuse where snakes and scorpions bred People were even scared to venture out there we have toiled to give it the respectability of a marketplace we have ourselves cleaned the place of the dirt and refuse Hes right And now were being uprooted from there and driven out Only because Katiya can make a huge shoppingcomplex there why cant you understand the problem The Government will have do make inquiries So whats wrong And what do you wish to inquire about lf youre really so keen go and take a look in our homes we havent cooked for days we survive on our dailyearnings Mr Patel And our shops have been closed for days now Katiyas thugs flex their muscles in broaddaylight making it difficult for our kids and womenfolk to move about freely Had we helped you win the elections and voted you to power only to face the polices caning without even being heard Do you want us to remain silent when your people pelt stones lt was your goons and not our people who pelted the stones Understand Now wait calm down Theyre all with Katiya They have a share in the shopping mall Katiya will build there Come to your senses lts you who has to be brought to your senses lnspector Listen carefully Mr Patel we have our roots deep in that place You just cant evict us from Gol Chowk ln your very presence we shall go on a hungerstrike with our wives and children lf death is what were destined to get we will choose how we die The rest is for the Lord to decide we have a problem indeed we must meet Katiya soon who the hell is Katiya to decide our destiny we own the shops the land and slog on them Then why must we grovel before anyone wheres the question of groveling You simply dont understand this l suggest we settle this without a fight if thats possible lts because of your attitude that weve reached this stage when Katiyas brother first came here to collect protection money l was against it even then l had strongly advised them against paying up But they said then that it was a question of only two Rupees and it was better to settle it peacefully But it wasnt just a question of Rupees lt had to do with acknowledging Katiyas authority we were bowing to his mightand that is what eventually happened Their demands for money continued to increase So much so that he now wants to uproot us from our dwellings But do you think a hungerstrike will serve the purpose were not political leaders wholl be offered limejuice to end the agitation Hes right well only rot here and eventually die So go ahead and die we must prove to them that we are prepared to die That they cannot scare us with threats of impending death we will not vacate this place come what may l think we must Thats a special soldier from Katiyas force Stopping getting scared its here only to escort us to Katiya The mans fond of many such things How can l tell you of everything This way theres a special program underway in there lls it a cabaret Or is it a notchgirls dance Youre lucky the soldier didnt hear that Or hed have mauled you The fights and thrills of movies and videos just dont excite Katiya Then what does He gets a kick out of seeing death from handing it out to a live person He sets man against man animal against animal And sometimes an animal against man too He gets a kick out of seeing blood being shed He rewards those who emerge victorious and enrolls them in his gang what about the ones who lose This thug of yours has lost to me Katiya Do you still have someone strong enough to challenge me Hold it Havent l often told you not to use these weapons of the cowards to call yourself lionhearted Have you seen for yourself the might of my brothers Theyre lions all my six brothers are lions You have dared to challenge me in my den and lose a duel Have him thrown in the panthers cage As for you You have surrendered to the enemy inspite of being my own man You have considered your life to be more precious than my honor And l have no use for such a meaningless life ltd be terribly difficult should they really go on a hungerstrike Theyve always stayed there Mr Katiya But if l am pressurized any further lll be helpless too we have used threats and intimidation but Sachdev doesnt seem to buckle under the pressure Youve had a stroke of paralysis brotherinlaw what nonsense are you talking Thats not nonsense lts true The Law and the politicians have always been his strongarms when they both refuse to work doesnt it mean hes paralyzed Stop him please whats the rot hes wishing for He stays with us for one And then acts smart too Had we the good sense to throw you out when your sister died we wouldnt have had to put up with your nonsense lll kick him out this very moment and throw a party to celebrate it Brotherinlaw l wont leave my brotherinlaw alone My sister told me before she died to always serve my brotherinlaw and to find my place at his feet wont you get lost then Stop it thats enough what did you say his name is why must you alone take the lead in this matter whats wrong now well face the same fate as others do why must you try and be the leader lm not trying to be the leader but someone will have to bear the mantle well have to speak up l dont like this Do you just dont like it or are you afraid for me lm afraid too lf one has to live in the world lm not bothered about the world All l know is that my world revolves around you alone And lm always worried about you And the Lord above worries about everyone Dont worry do you think Hed spare them should something happen Hell make them account for their deeds As for me lm only doing my duty Malti Lets leave the rest to the Almighty Hurry up and drop the stuff home they mustve already started it And make sure to have lots of water before you come This is no ceremonial fast its a hungerstrike we will not vacate this land we own this land it belongs to us No No Dont No This cant be Save him somebody Hes dying Hear me Listen to me please lts

father ls it a sin to wish to live with honor and dignity All we want is to lead a life of respect we had only come here to have my father treated And they made a dog out of him They revere him back there in Benaras they salute him And what happens here Out here No Kashi Dont cry Hes a very nice man lnspector Please let him go Let him go is not the problem The problem is that when youre in love with him why didnt you drill some sense into him why did he have to mess with Katiya at all This is what he gets out of messing with Katiya right Had he worked for Katiya he could have quietly enjoyed himself Quietly Like you isnt it Shedding all his shame in the process right Great You dance in a seedy joint and talk of respect Of course l dance that too in a club l earn my money with sheer hard work and dont earn my livelihood from sin like you do You earn your bread and butter from the Government but youre a slave to Katiya Just you wait Now where is my register Once l file charges against him hell be thrown in for years Very well then go ahead and file the charges Just you open that register and start writing Go on The constables attached to your station held my held Your constables got drunk and misbehaved with me They not only grabbed my hand they even tore my clothes Look They even ripped open my clothes write that Open your register and record my statement You will record it You certainly will lll assemble some women here who will stand witness File the charges Go on what are you staring at me for Theres no problem there lm the one with problems Hey let him go weve even tamed that muscleman you got from Benaras we publicly made a dog out of this chaps father lnspite of all this your shops are still open and business goes on But the Courts what Katiya says is the law My brother had his special mans finger cut all because of you Could you still dare do this lts not a question of daring its our necessity Cut the dialogue Tell us your name Ambikaprasad Satyanarayan Tiwari How much does your shop measure lts feet by Pay him But it has stuff worth lts then Quietly take whatever Katiya is giving you and just get lost Dont worry boss lm keeping a watch on them Anyone who opens the shutters of his shop will have to lose his life You dont wish to be a dog at my feet But look your father is very much a dog for me Hes even licking my boots Your father is a dog for me Your fathers a dog for me Hes licking my feet Your fathers wagging his tail before me Hes licking my feet Learn to contain your temper my son You came to see whether l was still alive right So that after lm dead you can finish Katiya and go to prison But you must learn to nurture your temper when Gandhi was thrown out of a train in South Africa he didnt waste his fury on the Ticket Collector ln fact he preserved all his rage and turned into the foundation of his struggle for lndias freedom He eventually won lndependence for his nation That is exactly what you will have to do Kashi Killing Katiya is not the solution to our problems Because Katiya is not our enemy lt is actually the terror he strikes in peoples hearts which is even more lethal than the cancer that has struck me lt is fear that has stifled all voices lts rendered them hollow You will have to instill confidence in the people and make them so brave that even a child may take on Katiya when the need arises Katiya will die on his own and well never have another bully again Just learn to contain your anger my son what are you doing here at this hour Are you drunk Lock the shutters Have you had
