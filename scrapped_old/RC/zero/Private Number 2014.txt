know any Valerie Washington You didnt hear anything Honey you gotta trust me think you need to take a break from your book think the pressures getting to you Its okay Now my reasons for drinking were almost occupational was a psychiatrist And being a psychiatrist listened to peoples problems all the time every day all you know on top of my own Then of course my alcoholism All felt that drinking was um my escape um that deserved it And so started to drink And got lost got very lost and lost many things lost everything lost my job lost my wife lost my reputation lost my dignity was humiliated beyond any reasonable measure lost my kids Did that stop me No See couldnt accept the fact that loved the next drink more than loved my own children But did then And we all know that getting sober is just half the battle Its staying sober staying sober Ladies and gentlemen staying sober is the hardest thing Its the hardest part and its the hardest thing ve ever done and it is We can all come up with an excuse to have a drink for Gods sake You feel good You feel bad You feel sad You feel happy Hey theres always a reason to have a celebration with a dry martini but the problem with people like us is that one martini leads to another martini It leads to a scotch on the rocks It leads to a in my case the crystal methamphetamine and then its over Many of you know my journey to sobriety in these last years and d be less than honest if were to say to you that havent wanted to have a drink many many times have But think sit down and think about what ve been through and all my family and my friends and the people that love and that stuck by me have been through So every time think that might be slipping Are you okay Yeah m fine Whos there Whos there What the fuck Fuck Okay be strong Where Oh Michael Michael Stop it Stop it What are you doing Its not in my head thought we were past this saw her saw it again And something happened here Ah fuck And And And Maybe its the house Maybe it wants to thought we were past this Maybe it wants us to leave Maybe the Realtor lied to us What are you doing You know something shes not telling us you know Because you know who lived here dont know who Who lived here before us and maybe Why did they leave you know Why did they have to go You are insane These people These people these things they want us to know They want us to know whats going on What are you doing Do you know who lived here before us dont know why they chose me but they did and You drank Uh fuck You drank m not gonna give them the house m not gonna You fucking drank m not gonna leave Thats not whats important Youre saying you never drank Thats not whats important Fucking asshole Listen to me Listen m just trying to protect you From what The bogeyman thats trying to get us All of the secret messages that are hidden in the phone calls ve tried everything can do to help you m done No No Katherine need you to believe me ll come back to get the rest of my stuff when youre gone No Well m sorry maam didnt mean to scare you Its okay Well tried calling but it seems youre not answering your phones Sorry about that Ah its no problem We got some information back on those private calls Now you say the phone was unplugged but it was still ringing No that was a mistake Thought that sounded a little crazy Even though what we found was a little crazy in itself What do you mean Well normally we can easily trace these types of calls because all numbers including private ones have a What was weird was every time we tried one of your calls our systems crashed It worked with every other number we tried but yours kept causing our equipment to fail Thats weird So we called in some tech guys and they said the problem is the trace route was connected to a What do they call it null number Null number Meaning it doesnt exist like an empty data set as if it appeared out of nowhere Well it had to have appeared from somewhere What is more that name your husband gave us Valerie uh Valerie Washington Yes yes Now she died four years ago victim of some serial killer Now her murder along with four others were never solved There are no witnesses no leads Case is now closed was right Mr Lane didnt see you there was just telling your wife About the phone calls and and Valerie Washington Did Did she or any of the other victims live in this house Well you dont think shes calling you from beyond No no no no None of the victims lived here as far as know Why do you think they chose you ask myself that every day Well even though m skeptical of all sorts of paranormal activity what do know If she calls you again maybe you can ask her who killed her move a couple of our cases to the solved column Well gotta be getting back to the station Sheriff Stance turned the matter over to me so if anything else comes up just give me a call What happened with the Sheriff His plate is full He loves me That may have something to do with it too You folks have a good evening m sorry didnt believe you Lets go inside Valerie Washington Next message Haley Sandee Haley Sanders Next message Mary Ann Sanders Mary Ann Sanders Next message Larry Osmand Vicki Johnson End of messages You know think the deputys onto something found four more names And get the feeling that they want me to help them you know like they want me to bring them some justice to find the guy that did this Why they picked us dont know but Babe gotta get some rest cant even keep my eyes open Okay Well just let me know if you need anything okay ll leave you the towel Okay baby Baby you want some Baby Baby Katherine Whats happening baby Sweetheart Give her a couple of these twice a day Plenty of rest Usual plenty of fluids and Okay okay fine but what happened Because a couple days ago she was fine and then she was taking her meds regularly was making sure of that and all of a sudden this didnt Look you never really know with these kinds of seizures Youre telling me she took all her medications Absolutely No drugs No Not too much alcohol No no no m telling you everything was the way it should be My best guess is she might have some kind of an infection and and she may be fighting it and her body What kind of infection Went into overdrive dont know dont think its meningitis but we could run some tests to find out later But she needs her rest And if her temperature goes up or she has another seizure we may need to admit her okay Okay But just keep an eye on her Okay Larry Osmand Vicki Johnson Yep thats the rest of em at least what can tell What do you mean Dont you have the records Not here Just a single folder on some basic information The name age birth date a brief description and date of death No proper files How can that be Well newer deputies dont get access to confidential files only had whats already on public records But you can get access right Only with the Sheriffs permission and hes not gonna grant that Look even if he did let me see them theyre confidential cant tell you whats in them But can solve these murders Lets not get carried away Now Sheriff Stance doesnt want to go through this anymore and and he pulled me off Hes advised me not to have any more contact with you What Hes afraid youre gonna give the families false hope Now could lose my job just by having this conversation Now m sorry Michael wish there was more could do And my advice to you for what its worth let the past stay that way Yeah They wont let me You can run but you cant hide m gonna bury this son of a bitch Good morning baby She said its middle of the afternoon

Lucas Connor Lucas Connor Lucas Connor Lucas Connor Lucas Connor Lucas Connor Lucas Connor Lucas Connor Lucas Connor Lucas Connor Lucas Connor Lucas Connor Lucas Connor Lucas Who is Connor Lucas Is he Is he the sixth victim Or is he the murderer September September September Son of a bitch Theres a pattern Theres a pattern Each of these crimes is completely different but they all share one thing in common Each fits one type of serial killer and he covered this with meticulous detail Like this one this is when the killer takes something valuable from the victim This is the only victim that had something taken Look what it says Gain Gain This is his signature Each one fits a type But this one here this ones missing This ones missing from the pattern visionary Well maybe he got scared wised up moved away No no Hes not scared Look at the crime scenes Does this guy look scared to you Well can certainly run it by the Sheriff see what he says Thats uh dont dont Thats not a good idea Well what are you saying Look the last two deputies who went poking around were fired okay dont want you to lose your job Nah theres no way the Sheriff will protect a killer Yes but he would protect himself Okay now youre losing me And you gotta be careful making these types of allegations Now if you wanna get along in this town you gotta watch who you offend Look all m trying to say is that the two local murders were investigated by the Sheriff and they were not investigated properly and the two deputies who said something were fired Then the mayor makes this generous contribution to the Sheriffs road safety campaign and a month later the Sheriff buys a a brandnew home So now the mayors involved No Mayor or no mayor dont know but the Sheriff is involved and am am this close to finding the truth Okay wanna help ll look into it see if can find some more information on the sixth victim Okay Until then lets keep this between us Absolutely Just pump the brakes until you hear from me
