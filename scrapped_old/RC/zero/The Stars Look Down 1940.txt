This is a story of simple working people such as there are the world over in all countries at all times Here are their hardships their humour and above all their heroism The unconquerable heroism of men who take heroism for granted as part of their daily lives Neither plaster saints or romantic rebels they live lives far from the limelight without publicity and with no spokesman save when some great crisis or disaster lifts them into the headlines Yet these people are the backbone of nations the stuff of human destiny Simple working people such as there are the world over in all countries and at all times Fenwick do the men work tomorrow Not on Scupper Flats Mr Barras Against your union The union isnt being asked to work there Theres a million tons of floodwater ready to wash down on us You dont think d chance flooding my own mine Show us the plans of the workings then No plans never existed Theres two opinions on that Its you whove put the wind up the men And the union should be backing us up Davey This your lad whos after the university scholarship d like to help him The men wont work Scupper Flats The unions made the drill test We wouldnt send you down if it wasnt safe

us the plans Show us plans It isnt dangerous is it Father ll teach them a lesson hear them sound their trumpets First angel sounds then follows hail mingled with blood The angel sounds a great

lesson and it ended with me marrying your father could marry Joe Gowlan tomorrow just by raising my little finger But m not going to raise it Not just yet The case for private ownership varies according to what it is The case for public ownership varies according to who puts it ll put it this way If private ownership of coal mines why not lighthouses Because theres no profit in a lighthouse Please its taken dont believe that everything under the sun should be publicly owned but coal mining is not something under the sun Hear hear Thats not my point Mr Nugent Theres a fundamental difference between coal mining and most industries It is that coal like iron and other natural resources was not invented manufactured or even cultivated by man it is put there by nature for man to take These natural resources ladies and gentlemen national resources are not the basis of a few industries incidental to our nations structure They are the basis of all our industry The life blood of every industry They are the very foundation upon which our nation is built The material with which our nation is built without which our nation could not flourish resent that this great buried treasure this source of all our nations wealth this vital national heritage should be dispensed to this man or that good man or bad to exploit this mine or that willy nilly as and when he chooses To use it as a pawn in price manipulations cost evasions middleman transactions and as a pabulum of his selfaggrandisement resent it as would resent a foreign flag on the cliffs of Dover Favourite won

thing wish you wouldnt waste all your lovely brain on these things ve had a great idea Have you darling ve been thinking about you not having a job and thought that you could go along to Millingtons and have a talk to Joe Gowlan m sure he could get you in there and he thinks a lot of you Does he You know he does Dont lets have any silly jealousy m only thinking of you getting on Joe would give me a job Yes But youd have to give up the silly ideas about miners People dont have any patience with it Did Joe say that Yes of course Youve always loved Joe havent you cant blame you blame myself for falling in love with you Go ahead Ton after ton further and further into that barrier holding back a million tons of floodwater Have they taken drill tests Drill tests Youve all been working miners and you know that without plans you cant tell if your drill tests are deceiving you We cant inspect the plans because the mine owner insists that they never existed My father insists that they did and still do and d like to know why they cant be inspected We cant listen to just anyone who may have seen some plans The men in Scupper Flats listened and starved for three months to avoid it Anyway Barras wouldnt risk flooding his own mine There are owners who will take a gamble There are few miners who dont This gamble beg you not to be a party to You may deny you intend to be a party to anything just to do nothing Like the man who sits and watches a child drowning Hes not a party to it Theres no crime he can be accused of certainly not murder If these men drown in Scupper Flats nobody can accuse you of murder Youll say you were not a party to it So will you and you But what will your conscience say And yours and yours It is in your hands today to decide whether these men should enter that death trap Your hands and yours Today Theyre stripping it now that barrier holding back a million tons of water Mr Chairman Yes Mr Wilkins Weve all been swept off our feet by the eloquence and sincerity of this young man Hear hear But is he as sincere as we think Please tell me when you decided to come here today Last Saturday night Aye Scupper Flats had been going for three years and it wasnt till last Saturday that you decided to put this before us Thats when heard about the new contract Aye contract which you knew was of great value to Mr Gowlan What are your personal relations with Mr Gowlan We used to be friendly Aye Up until last Saturday night The night you decided to try to put a stop to this contract of Mr Gowlans You and Mr Gowlan quarrelled That has nothing to do with my coming here today Was it a bitter quarrel Mr Fenwick It came to blows It had no connection with my coming here believe it was your wife you quarrelled about Mr Fenwick Your wife has left you as a result of it Hasnt she Whats that to do with Scupper Flats If Scupper Flats is dangerous now its been dangerous for three years yet you didnt do anything about it till last Saturday The night that you had this violent quarrel with Mr Gowlan put it to you Mr Fenwick that you were determined to do anything you could to revenge yourself upon him and thats why youre here today Thank you Mr Chairman Its obvious whos behind this and why Mr Fenwick Hes given you a false impression beg you not to be stampeded into it Mr Fenwick Come on lad Youre wasting your breath Thank you for the trouble
