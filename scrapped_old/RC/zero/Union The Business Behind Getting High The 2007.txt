host Marijuana History Or should say extremely brief Marijuana History Its big complicated and well only be able to scratch the surface so lets get started The first thing that strikes one as odd when looking at the history of marijuana which is also known as cannabis is how very much legal it once was In fact it wasnt only legal it just happened to be one of the largest agricultural crops in the world including the United States You see cannabis can also be hemp and just what is hemp Well its by and large the most robust durable natural soft fiber on the face of this planet Up until and for thousands of years before cannabis hemp was the largest agricultural crop in the world It had thousands of uses and products The majority of fabric lighting oil medicines paper and fiber came from hemp The first marijuana law to exist in the United States was a law ordering farmers to grow hemp Benjamin Franklin used it to start one of Americas first paper mills The first two copies of the Declaration of Independence were written on cannabis hemp paper Up until the s most of the textiles in the United States were made with hemp last half of the th century was made from cannabis Even Queen Victoria used the resin extracts from cannabis to alleviate her menstrual cramps But the funny thing about industrial hemp was you couldnt get high from it yet it was lumped in with the following which also made little sense Reefer Madness In the early th century yellow journalism had surfaced Articles depicted blacks and Mexicans as frenzied beasts who would smoke marijuana play devils music and heap disrespect and viciousness on the readership a majority of which happened to be white Some offenses included looking at a white woman twice laughing at a white person or even stepping on white mens shadows and this ended up leading to a law in the form of a tax stamp a tax stamp that would not only include marijuana but also hemp and cannabis medicines It speculated that hemps potential for an abundance of new products was going to be in direct competition with other sources And this added to the Reefer Madness led to the eventual downfall of all forms of cannabis Popular Mechanics magazine had actually prepared an article entitled New BillionDollar Crop Hemp was touted as being able to produce more than textile products from its threadlike fiber and more than products from its cellulose ranging from dynamite to cellophane Its superiority as a source for paper was also becoming known especially with the development of hempprocessing equipment Now the new Marijuana Tax Act was all fine and dandy except for one thing If you wanted to grow hemp you needed to buy a stamp but they werent giving any out to anybody And so in effect all forms of cannabis became illegal Things pretty much stayed that way until World War when the government decided that hemp once again was a good thing and produced a video Hemp for Victory But by the time the war was over hemp again became bad and in when the Marijuana Law once again came into question Congress recognized that marijuana was made illegal for the wrong reason It didnt make people violent at all It made them pacifists The Communists would use it to weaken Americas will to fight Congress now voted to keep marijuana illegal for the exact opposite reason they had outlawed it in the first place And all through the years report after report commissioned by everybody from the mayor of New York to the president of the United States has come back with the view that marijuana should have no criminal penalty attached to it Yet marijuana remains as illegal today as it did nearly years ago Marijuana Its become big business a multibilliondollar business both in Canada and the United States but why has it become such a big business Here in British Columbia alone its speculated that the illegal marijuana trade brings in upwards of billion annually and up to of that product heads south to the United States Having become an international issue when do the lines blur How does a massive underground market like this survive while remaining illegal Why is marijuana illegal in the first place And if Prohibition is meant to protect us guess the most obvious question is does the Prohibition work man If Prohibition worked okay If you could just wave a magic wand and say This is gone away d be all over it you know But the fact of the matter is that Prohibition has never worked man You know weve been here before You remember the first Prohibition right Which was host Prohibition of alcohol No no m talking about thefirstProhibition Thou shalt not partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge And who was the big cop And how many people did He have to watch Two What are the goals of this Prohibition man assume the goals of Prohibition are to reduce the amount of drugs available and to reduce the demand for those drugs In both instances cannabis Prohibitions an utter failure Has the Prohibition stopped people from using marijuana man You get a phone call and it says m from the federal government wanna know whether youve been using cocaine or marijuana recently Presumably you might be getting a little bit of an underestimate In there were estimated to be marijuana users and now there are estimated to be more than million of them Thats a increase Seems to be quite a few of them Yes m afraid there are Whether the drug is criminalized or decriminalized does not affect the rates of smoking of cannabis either of uptake or of discontinuation host So what are the dangers of using marijuana dont know dont know It gives you like a rapid heartbeat woman Smokers cough m sure it has some effect on your brain function memory dont know is there something unhealthy about moving slowly Its just not good for you Youre not fully conscientious of what youre doing Thickens some membranes in your brain or something Well its been science guess its m being told its been scientifically proven that marijuana kills your brain cells Ahh thats one remember marijuana kills brain cells thought the same thing You know didnt start smoking pot until about five years ago thought pot made you stupid bought into it just as much as anybody did realized when was like was like You got to be fucking kidding me Ronald Reagan announces the most reliable scientific sources say permanent brain damage is one of the inevitable results of the use of marijuana Monkeys pumped full of marijuana apparently joints a day had begun to atrophy and die after days Brain damage was determined after counting the dead brain cells of both monkeys who had been subjected to the marijuana and ones who had not The study became the foundation of the government and other specialinterest groups claim that marijuana kills brain cells Heres what they didnt tell you After six years of requests how the study was conducted was finally revealed Instead of administering Dr Heath used a method of pumping through a gas mask within five minutes over three months man They suffocated the monkeys What they did is they put these gas masks basically on their face and they pumped pot into it but without additional oxygen so after amount of time the brain shut down Well if you suffocate the first thing thats gonna happen is your brain cells are gonna die with lack of oxygen So what they did is they suffocated the monkey showed all these dead brain cells and then went on to associate it by saying that cannabis use causes your brain cells to die And how many people not knowing the origin of the study have gone on to quote it and requote it and now people believe it Studies since have shown no signs of any braincell damage In new research suggested that marijuana could possibly stimulatebraincell growth That study hasnt received the same attention Another common belief marijuana causes lung cancer In the study by the Institute of Medicine that was paid for by the United States Government they had to use words like may and should cause cancer Weve been hearing for years them trying to say that it causes lung cancer and we say Really Thats interesting because you cant even show us one case of cancer being caused by cannabis use alone You definitely have to do it moderately because it does paralyze the cilia but if its not radioactive youre probably not going to get cancer from it man Smoking it can be harmful because of the properties of smoke Not as a result of anything in the cannabis plant but because theyre intaking heated plant matter into their lungs People said Well you dont know We havent been smoking it long enough Look what happened with cigarettes Weve had about four decades more than four decades of experience If this was gonna show up it should have shown up by now Finally a study came out just in the last month verifying that cannabis smoke does not cause cancer Its different than nicotine and the elements in the tobacco smoke do cause cancer and elements in the marijuana dont Theres no cases of marijuanaonly smokers getting brownlung syndrome Theres no cases of marijuanaonly smokers getting emphysema Strange for a plant thats so dangerous How come none of that Marijuana is as bad for you or worse than tobacco Impossible If they had the evidence theyd be putting emaciated bodies or emphysema lung cancer black lungs they would be parading them throughout the media They dont have one yet people somehow or other think that it might cause the same thing In fact if you look at the straight deaths from substances a different type of picture starts to appear The numberone killer in the country it beat out heroin crack cocaine alcohol car accidents fire and murder combined Tobacco Thats a nasty dirty thing to say sir lovely pure white cigarette causing cancer It gets me right here coughing With an average of deaths per year considering its the numberone killer its interesting to know that tobacco receives government subsidies and is grown with radioactive fertilizer Now get out there and sell cigarettes Number two on the list If we dont include poor diet and physical inactivity with well over deaths a year alcohol As we look much further down the list there are others that may surprise you Caffeine comes in with one to deaths a year And some of our most popular pain relievers nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as aspirin still make an appearance with over deaths annually Where does marijuana lie in this What kind of staggering number do we find dont know From marijuana would probably say then would say it would be hundreds of billions Get ready for it here it comes There are no deaths from cannabis use anywhere You cant find one Joe In years of known use of marijuana theres never been a single death attributed to marijuana Theres deaths in America alone every year that are directly attributed to tobacco ve heard that you have to smoke something like to get a toxic amount of delta tetrahydracannabinol challenge anybody to do that And even in the animal studies where people have loaded the animals up with doses that would be hundreds of times what a human could possibly be exposed to no animals dont die The seems to be astronomical You can die from ingesting too much aspirin You can die from ingesting too much coffee The drug warriors who say We have to protect society save these people are being just a little bit disingenuous Not one university or medical facility has ever recorded a single death directly attributed to marijuana But never mind that Theres other problems other reasons to fear it Take addiction for example There are more kids in addiction clinics for marijuana than any other substance This must mean that marijuana is the most addictive substance today Its undoubtedly true that there are more teenagers and kids in treatment for marijuana than all the other drugs combined What the never tells you iswhythats true Lester kid is caught possessing or smoking marijuana Hes taken to court hes given a choice Either you you know some horrible penalty or you go to a treatment center Obviously chooses to go to treatment and goes to treatment there hes considered an addict But then the gets the point of that stat and says Look at all these kids in treatment for marijuana God it must be because todays marijuana is not the marijuana that your parents were smoking As far as understand only of the people in treatment for marijuana are there voluntarily The other were told to by their guardian or told to by a judge You can choose between jail or treatment lot of people choose treatment It provides no basis for speaking about addiction Anybody who is at all sophisticated about marijuana would rate them the way two researchers were asked to rate drugs in order of addiction Nicotine was one alcohol was two Then heroin then cocaine then coffee and then marijuana There may have been a couple of other drugs but marijuana was at the very bottom Below coffee man This narcotic unlike the opiates the synthetics and cocaine is nonaddictive man What do you mean by nonaddictive By nonaddictive it is meant that the user of marijuana when deprived of the drug will not experience the agonies of withdrawal It is habituating but its use can be discontinued Then what is its danger Its used as a scapegoat for covering up underlying problems in people especially young people Here am dont ignore me If you use marijuana on a daily basis for a year or so and you stop using it youre gonna notice some differences but nothing like the kind of withdrawal people will experience withdrawing from either tobacco or heroin But why would the government and the wanna put a statistic like that out there Well learn more about that later The Gateway Theory host Is marijuana a gateway drug Yes think it is If you havent How do you know dont exactly know why but know it is It opens the doorway to other drugs It makes you wanna experience more It makes you feel good Yeah People wanna experience something else and you know have a guess more dreams man Its greatest danger lies in the fact that it is a steppingstone to the harder drugs such as morphine and heroin Thats why there are people that wanna legalize marijuana They think if they can get the young people of this country onto hard drugs they can destroyyourgeneration during this generation You know in the days of Harry Anslinger it was called the Steppingstone Hypothesis If you stepped on this stone marijuana you were bound and determined to go onto the next stone which would be one of the socalled hard drugs Every time its been studied and looked at and so on they have never ever found that theres certainly nothinginmarijuana that makes you want to go to anything else There is no inherent psychopharmacological property of the drug which pushes one toward another drug ll smoke a joint want a bag of chips and fucking junk food dont wanna go out and get ripped drink alcohol thats my drug of choice It could be said started on milk mean this is crazy If use marijuana why does that automatically make me a candidate to blacktar heroin Its a nonsensical argument In fact only one out of every and less than one use heroin The black market throws the dealers of soft drugs together with the dealer of hard drugs So if you have a black market and you have a dealer thats dealing in marijuana and and everything else and the dealer might say to you Hey you wanna try something stronger Well in that sensebecause of the black market because of Prohibition people may be more susceptible to seeing these other drugs and being willing to try these other drugs Kirk And so what you see is that there is a gateway effect but its a gateway effect caused by Prohibition and the blending of the hard and softdrug markets host Where does this leave us Oh wait what about laziness You will be useless to society if you use marijuana But if thats true well there are about million people who smoke marijuana in America and over half of the Canadian population whove tried it And yet both societies seem to flourish And just look who some of these people are man Steven Jobs developed Apple Computer smoking pot Ted Turner developed News smoking pot still smokes a joint every day You go through every musician you like from the Rolling Stones to the Beatles to Led Zeppelin They all smoked pot man Snoop Dogg Willie Nelson Come on Bill Clinton for fuck He didnt inhale man scoffs Dont be so naive Norm Virtually every presidential candidate has now copped to using marijuana at some time in his or her life few times in the Army tried marijuana It was not a significant part of my life had a senior lawenforcement official tell me that in his judgment up to a quarter of the White House staff when they first came in had used drugs in the last four or five years The people that have personality problems and the people that are gonna be lazy and gonna lose their job theyre gonna lose their job anyway Theyre not losing their job because of marijuana Thats just a lie Todd love Tommy Chong think that a lot of the Cheech and Chong episodes that people believed not knowing that Tommy wrote and directed the movies thinking that you know thats what a stupid stoner looks like No actually thats what a really brilliant creative genius looks likeactinglike somebody you thinks a stoner And none of this is borne out in the research or when you look at people who are longterm users And there happen to be lawyers judges doctors and you know writers But what about the potency of the drug Marijuana is dangerous Theres higher levels than ever before Ian Any time you got a bag of Columbian dope years ago it was way better than the Mexican shwag that you normally got so theres always been a range of in plants And the fact that we can now grow stuff thats equivalent of what Columbian was years well it doesnt mean that were boosting to unheardof levels It just means you know Hi there are some nuances in this discussion that people should be aware of Todd And actually think that its a real stroke of our own ego to think that for the or so years of Prohibition that weve improved upon varieties that have been cultivated for drug use in places like India and such for thousands of years People say Well you can abuse marijuana Well shit you can abuse cheeseburgers too you know You dont go around closing Burger King because you can abuse something can take a fucking fork and jam it in my eyeballs Does that mean forks should be illegal You know could jump off a bridge Should we outlaw bridges lets Nerf the world But what about all the crime and violence associated with marijuana From beat cop to police chief saw ample evidence of the harm caused by alcohol and the absence of evidence caused by marijuana use And mean the complete absence cannot recall a single case in which marijuana contributed to domestic violence crimes of theft and the like You wanna know what a weed smoker looks like Youre staring at one You know like m a weed smoker m not like crazy or you know m not stabbing you right now Most of the violent crime thats committed or most of crime period thats committed or having to do with drugs is people who are on drugs committing violent crimes If you make it legal if you make it cheaper you make it more available youre gonna have more violence more Tom that is not true stop lying to us Oh now come on Stop lying to us That is not true You know dont tell me that ve smoked pot Tom ve admitted it ve done it ve done all of the big three ve done tobacco ve done alcohol and ve done marijuana Tom guess what Marijuanas the least of the three pal You guys prove me wrong or whatever want to hear someone that has smoked too much weed and went home and beat his wife and beat his children or whatever like you see on booze Stephen The only big issue around alcohol is drunken driving and binge drinking among college students Otherwise you can drink to your hearts content There are far more crimes committed under the influence of unadulterated if you will emotions Anger rage jealousy lot of our understanding is driven by whats in the paper and on the television and the radio these days And we get extremes and the blackandwhite thinking is reinforced think by that If only there is something to compare it to something that was prohibited at one time but is now regulated so we could see what the difference might be Hmm what could that be what could that be Jack Under Prohibition of alcohol everythinggot worse Everything Kirk Alcohol Prohibition really birthed and gave rise to massive organized criminal groups within the United States It led to a general disregard for the law and a general disregard for police activity because it was a law that most people didnt obey Would you have supported the Prohibition of alcohol Well m glad you brought up the alcohol example mean as a governor you must have known firsthand the cost of alcohol hear this argument a lot of times like alcohol That isnt what asked you Tom asked you a specific question dont give me spin said would you have supported the Prohibition of alcohol dont think would have Why Because alcohol for better or worse and a lot of times for worse its a close call is longentrenched and ingrained part of our culture and our society mean you go back thousands of years the first writing is about alcohol the Bible everything else Really well Tom wait a minute Let me inject something then if you believe that God God also made the marijuana plant m talking about society m talking about our culture and our society Wait you just said the Bible Jack Alcohol poisoning went up by during Prohibition There were more speakeasies in large cities like New York City under Prohibition than there are taverns and liquor stores today John Sure one can point to alcohol as being a continuing social problem but we dont have people shooting each other over alcohol man When alcohol was prohibited people lived at that time to know the difference between Prohibition and nonProhibition They could see that the Prohibition of alcohol caused the emergence of gangsters and the underworld that took control of these substances Alcohol then was no longer in their control Could this be the same for marijuana It strengthens organized crime without a doubt because you have to be a criminal to sell it Its that simple This brings crime into it Thats why the benefits and the ability to make money is so huge in it Weapons were used to intimidate people and we seized approximately sawedoff shotguns and most of them are loaded Wheres all this competition weve heard so much about You call these prices low Marijuana is just a weed And marijuana is worth more ounce for ounce than gold You dont find legal commodities you know at an ounce You dont even find them at a pound Heck most things are aton for corn and grain and barley Neil Thats why when you walk ten pounds of marijuana across the border into the United States it becomes worth pounds You create an artificially inflated value for that drug that is so huge that people decide its worth murdering people in order to control this market Kirk think the Fraser Institute called cannabis Prohibition a gift of revenue to organized crime But what do growers and dealers think of this Would you like to see the government in the future legalize marijuana here in No its stealing money from us know wouldnt like to see it legalized The government would control and regulate the product and that could potentially hurt a lot of people in the industry man How can you compete with factories of perfectly rolledout doobies Theyd perfect it and wed all be out of money It makes for strange bedfellows Youve got the police and the highlevel drug dealers both agreeing that we should maintain this Prohibition Well when you got highlevel drug dealers saying Prohibition is good you might wanna scratch your head a little and think Well shoot why would they want to continue Prohibition cant imagine why a grower whos making or a year would ever wanna see marijuana legalized mean the last thing a grower wants is sensible policy The madness continues and they continue to get rich You know Betty m going to bring this up at the business meeting tomorrow You make the penalties stiffer You know what good For those people who are not getting caught price goes up Jack See so not only do we allow them to tell us how much drugs are gonna be supplied or the potency of those drugs who theyre gonna sell it to where theyre gonna sell them just to make sure they get it all right we let them keep all of the profits John So youve got essentially a Wild West Youve got an unregulated market in which anything can happen It certainly may work for things that people generally accept but if you try to prohibit something thats in demand that the people want then its pure folly And without control its hard to regulate areas of concern like keeping it out of the hands of our children There have been some studies that suggest heavy sustained longterm use from adolescence to adulthood has the potential to exasperate symptoms of those with a genetic predisposition for schizophrenia And although there is strong evidence that refutes this it does lead one to question Could there be a better way of deterring children from using rather than letting dealers decide what age is appropriate Jack For the last ten years our children across the United States have said that its easier to buy illegal drugs than it is to buy beer and cigarettes Kirk Its harder to get beer because you have to go through a regulated establishment thats going to check thats gonna have those safeguards in place that isnt just gonna sell it to you cause you got Jack Guy down on the street corner he doesnt want to know how old they are He doesnt wanna see an he says Show me the money And if they get the money it doesnt matter if that child is four years old Theyre gonna get the dope Kirk If you cant control the sale of the product how on Earth are you gonna keep it out of the hands of kids Could we be the creators of what we now see as some of our biggest problems Have our solutions been prelude to our worst fears The use of the criminal law for the basis of public health is a wholly bad idea no matter how you cut it It doesnt work you cannot legislate morality One person can say its immoral to legalize it just as much as someone can say its immoral not to legalize it It doesnt get you anywhere You have to have a rational policy debate by talking about the consequences Now ve had young people tell me that Well your generation had a martini and that was your crutch and why cant we have our own kind of crutch You know what Why dont you be a generation that doesnt have to have any kind of crutch Neil Its a lot easier argument if you just say Oh its immoral Then you dont have to debate why it is that alcohol kills so many more people than marijuana or why it is that tobacco takes seven years off your life and we cant establish that marijuana does anything particularly If people do do drugs and they commit crimes around those drugs they should in fact be punished But you cant punish someone for something that hurts no one We should legalize marijuana tax the hell out of it and put every dime back into the healthcare system record scratching Taxation and legalization Doesnt that seem a little extreme Wouldnt it be better to just decriminalize The distinction is simple Legalization of marijuana makes it a product that is legally available to adults That doesnt mean that theres unregulated distribution unregulated sale and unregulated use The decriminalization of marijuana still makes it an offense Youre not gonna go to jail for it under a decriminalized model but society is still saying No no no no It doesnt address the problems of organized crime and it doesnt create a situation where you have retail sales Jeffrey Decriminalization is just kind of a goofy concept To say that its legal to own something to use it to possess it but not to produce it or sell it just seems like this illogical position because where did this stuff come from Larry Its the worst of both worlds It sends out an incredibly bad message It should be controlled like alcohol like tobacco Jeffrey The total impact for the budget from legalizing marijuana and taxing it at rates like alcohol and tobacco is somewhere in the to billion range Kirk It can be used to pay for healthcare costs it can be used to rebate to lower taxes and give people lower tax rates It can be used for highways for hospitals for national defense Its billion and it can be used for whatever its best use is Norm The production or the harvesting the packaging the sales of marijuana could be handled essentially the way we handle alcohol You sell to a kid you sell to somebody under the influence your license is in jeopardy That license ought to be hard to get and easy to lose It seems to make sense Its a little jarring but nowhere are these issues more relevant than here in Yes marijuana is illegal here and yes police actively pursue growers and dealers but that doesnt stop the market from thriving Its believed that the illegal marijuanatrade industry employs anywhere from to people and the product is now known around the world Its even been given its own name bud Bud host Bud British Columbia bud dont know what you are meaning bud Bud host You guys know what bud is No You guys know where British Columbia is No isnt it in Britain No its in Canada When say is famous for Pot Weed and hippies Mountains sea Marijuana usually think of The Beachcombers back in the days but now just think of that bud host Do you know what bud is No Oh its really wellknown bud is bud that comes from British Columbia And thats why they call it bud or beasters Dude you got the beasters Yeah got the beasters which means you got bud from host You know what the word growop is d say its pretty common knowledge here what a growop is People do them in their houses in their basements m surprised its not in our dictionary growop is something that happens inside somebodys house like one of our friends or something and they just grow weed inside their house host Do you know anybody thats growing marijuana dont well no Kelowna my hometown With a population of only Kelowna is said to house well over growops police officer stated in the local paper If they were to bust one growop every day for a year they would still be nowhere near getting rid of them And Kelowna is not alone Where are they in theyre everywhere Theyre in every single corner of the province There is no community in the province that doesnt have grows and hasnt had an increase in grows The fact is that theres thousands and thousands and thousands of growops all over British Columbia and the most common thing you hear when they raid a growop is from the neighbors is had no idea they were growing pot on my street You know if you actually took my estimate seriously that there were growops in British Columbia in the year if you took that seriously youre looking at roughly one out of every dwelling units in British Columbia We need to have a sense of that Not bad for a province with a population of only million people Its certainly changed a great deal from the s and s when it was an import export business to the domesticproduction business of the s and beyond That would make us Columbia North Were talking a lot of production The reality is that theres a huge range of people involved in the marijuana industry in British Columbia Its not a hierarchy People dont beat you up if you go into the marijuana industry It ranges from people growing a few plants to members of motorcycle clubs and others possibly being involved in the business Darryl Police at one time used to attend to every single call that came to their attention Somebody would call and say think theres a growop Police would do an investigation do a full investigation Well that has dropped over seven years to where its only about half the time But is seems to me that if we look around and talk to people who are living in the real world one of the things we discover is that we dont understand it very well And when we see these numbers like of all dwelling units potentially are involved in marijuana growops it certainly ought to give our politicians perspective on what it is theyre trying to do So how does one find these growops For police it involves the use of forwardlooking infrared cameras that can detect the abovenormal heat radiating from a growop or the sniff test But if all else fails this Grow Watch Communities have become so flooded with growops in that some neighborhoods have started their own watch programs This one set up by the Chilliwack even has an education package with phases training neighborhood cooperation certification Once certified you are able to hang this sign which shows that you are a neighborhood that does not approve of marijuana grow operations There are questions provided to citizens in order to aid them in identifying a growop Questions like Do the residents keep to themselves Was the sound of construction heard coming from the basement soon after occupants took over the residence Is there condensation visible on the windows Is the yard unkempt The education package does state that a positive response to one or some of these questions does not necessarily indicate that the residents are involved in criminal activity Maybe thats a good thing But why is it that growops are popping up in virtually every neighborhood of How much money can actually be made by simply growing some plants in your basement And what do these growops look like anyway We finally got a grower Right now were driving to meet them Its around eight lights its not a huge huge show This is what they use for clippers and stuff like that When they hire clippers to do a show you put these on and if people are looking from the outside it just looks pretty much like youre wearing sunglasses But when youre on mean cant put them on right now because m driving wont be able to see Everyones getting glasses director other producer Wheres my phone We just wait for the phone call so keep in line for when this comes to oh see a vehicle pulled up Maybe thats them Hello Okay so put the glasses on Okay man Now can you tell them were just gonna have the camera running but were going to have the lens cap on is that cool Hey Diggs were going to have the camera running but were going to have the cap on so theres no video Shit Yeah just do it just keep it on Just put the cap on How are you guys feeling Feel that heart rate increased You want the camera Yeah cool Youre not feeling motion sickness Oh yeah now am feeling m feeling sick man Were just gonna hold peoples arms and kind of guide them inside Yeah yeah yeah thats what was saying so dont fall on my face here real growop The grower admitted that this wasnt the biggest of growops In fact it was probably on the small end of the scale in terms of size but really didnt care There were just so many things to see The lights the tools the power the pots and of course the marijuana What do you guys do for the smell noticed theres a big Well we got this carbon filter here whatever it just kind of filters the air in there and then it goes underneath the house and we have it so it goes into like a dog shed m in the beginning stage and m learning Over here theres also another room in there So you have a total of is it eight lights Eight lights yeah they go on hours This one runs hours in the daytime This one comes on at at night Would you say a majority of the guys you know are just growing to earn some extra money Yeah yeah they have normal jobs and you know theyre normal The grower told me he cropped out about every two months and every crop was worth about Thats a year Even though this was a small growop the numbers didnt seem small at all If those kind of numbers are coming out of a setup of eight lights what kind of numbers are coming out of the big ones And where do you find them Well it would seem just about everywhere Barges semi trucks man Whether it was for the mobility of it or whether it was an attempt to disguise the smell of growing marijuana in any event its unusual for that reason Even in train whistle train cars Yes it seems as though even our beloved caboose cannot escape growop fever When we read that train cars were buried underground to grow marijuana busted or not we had to see this so we set out But not before asking our sound man if we could use his and coaxing him with a little free gas Where we were going we would need it Were in the boondocks way up here Wouldnt wanna go over that puppy This is what they brought up diesel fuel to power the generators in With how much they were growing and how much the generators needed mean thats a full truckload there And finally after a few hours on the highway and climbing up the side of a mountain we get there We had to go into fourlow just to get up here and you can see m dressed right m in jeans and frickin sneakers Fuck My feet are cold Theres no neighbors like look to the right Theres nobody there Nobody here nobody there mean imaging theyre probably laid this way Theyve been obviously following you like where are you getting your diesel Where are you getting the tanks Where do you buy ten train carts Where do you buy lights These are diesel pumps and it looks like theres still diesel leaking in these things here This is how you got down there Just wanna make sure its okay to go down here Feel like m going into a cave All right watch your feet there Not as cold under here About eight train carts down that way m guessing cant even see to the end And then two deep each one is two deep Down here two deep down the next one two deep Three four theres numbers on the wall And then what they did is they cut them to make doorways and thats how you have your hallways going into each one There are water reservoirs here and you see one two three Youre like Okay thats quite a bit But then theres this one and that one and another one at the end Look at these things Like no wonder the cops just left it Moving this shit would be a pain in the ass These train carts see why they bought them They got a deal Theyre all rusted in the bottom We could start growing here tomorrow Theres still dirt and fertilizer ready to go Oh here who wants a little leftover plant there Look at this Look at all this wiring right here You can see the cops have come severed everything man What are those chains for Chains are where they were hanging the lights Reason why they use the chains cause then they can adjust the height Actually you wanna get me a run all the way down to see how far away am So m going to go the end here to show you how deep this is and this was all filled with plants Whoa m at the end can hardly see over there its just like lights to me This is how far away like to give you an idea just how big this is God its a trek just to get back to where you guys are Now youre gonna see a lot of repetition because here it goes again Bang all the way down When it said in the paper its probably its gotta be ten long and two deep each one cause then youve got your carts Man wish we could have seen that while it was still rolling That is crazy You wouldnt know theres a law here Check this out Cannabis Day An actual day dedicated to marijuana And take note this takes place on one of the busiest hightraffic blocks of s largest city Vancouver Marijuana Its everywhere Consumed and sold in every imaginable way Pipes bongs joints baked goods It was hard to imagine that nearly every person attending this event was breaking the law and yet no one seemed to care The police were there but not to bust people They held traffic for the band to play for Cannabis Day Now they went back to their side of the street Sure no problem brother man Thank you very much No problem complying with the One of the organizers told me that in all the years this event has taken place theres never been a violent incident except once by a man who was believed to be under the influence of alcohol We heard there was a jazz festival happening at the same time on the other side of the block It wasnt doing quite as well but there was one group doing all right Right up there as you can see is still Cannabis Day going on but right here not even a block away is a church retreat and theyre selling doughnuts was like Well what do you guys think about the rally And theyre like We need to pray for them Then was like You guys are selling food for them right m sure theyve sold record amounts today guess too so well see Well get an interview here shortly hopefully The interview never came There was so much marijuana it was unbelievable think we almost all got contact highs just from being around the smoke But did get a doughnut did purchase some of these on the way out Those church girls got me culture of marijuana has been established in from paraphernalia to cafs from seed selling to its very own political party the Marijuana Party Even bakers Hey everybody m Watermelon and welcome to my vaudeville cooking show Baked and Baking where were gonna revolutionize the cooking show and were gonna let you guys in on the action Meet Watermelon Girl Shes made a name for herself as s only drugdealing nudist comic pinup baker Did get all that in She was arrested for selling her cookies down on Wreck Beach a nude beach is this for real Watermelon Girl m like the Heidi Fleiss of weed tell everybody like lawyers doctors like theres no proverbial Yo you know Like none of those Like all professionals come in through my house you know lot of people with money a lot of people in politics You dont wanna know who comes through here you know My mother was a baker and her mother was a baker and we just we just bake So made these pot cookies and started selling them Its hard to ignore such a large demand So you got arrested one time on Wreck Beach right Yep yeah ve been arrested more than once Allegedly trafficking gingersnap cookies Allegedly trafficking gingersnap cookies So m assuming not regular gingersnap cookies right The one that packs snap crackle pot But even the judge was like Uhhuh You know what mean like hes just Hes seen violent crime after violent crime and then along comes the cookie girl Cops are supposed to come and remove undesirables from communities and clearly was not an undesirable person in my community phone rings Uh somebody else needs cookies Actually just got picked up by the National Speakers Bureau so actually go on speaking tours to universities and talk to kids about marijuana Oh really Yes like the most genius m like You want me to talk about marijuana Okay and they pay me to do it Lock up your kids this is a heinous crime So at some point one might ask oneself how does an industry of this size function while remaining illegal Where does the money flow Whos profiting off of it Is there really billion floating around the province unaccounted for Maybe people are feeling the effects and they dont even know it Turns out there seems to be a system Some have even given this system a name Well a lot of people here in town and stuff consider it a union Union Yeah a union and you know its like a different term for pretty much industry Its this underground thing where theres so many different tradesmen and different people all working together You have to work together with people that you trust because its illegal to do what people are doing here So this is how the socalled union breaks down and of course there are many exceptions to this but this is the typical setup First you have a home or landowner He doesnt take on much responsibility He is simply the legitimate owner of where the grow operation will take place All he has to do is pick up a briefcase every three months and pay off his mortgage His hands are clean because he can claim ignorance if the grow operation is busted Oh m sorry Officer didnt know they were growing marijuana there Then you have his partner the contractor who will provide the equipment and hire the grower or grow himself The grower is known as the fall guy Why the name Because thats exactly what he is If the operation is busted he takes the fall Once the crop has matured clippers are then hired They prep the weed for distribution by cutting away the excess leaves and stems What a lot of people dont understand is the part of the marijuana plant that people smoke is the bud which in essence is the plants flower Its not the leaves Clippers are generally hired on an hourly wage starting around taxfree of course Once the marijuana is ready in steps the weed broker Hes not always required but sometimes the partner with the equipment needs a broker to buy his product and then sell it for him In the event that a broker is required it usually means the weed is headed south to the United States In that case the broker will buy the pot for somewhere between and a pound Hell then hire a border jumper a risktaker someone who has the balls and hopefully the wits to get the product over the border Some of the most common ways The border jumpers fee varies with each trip but theyre always wellpaid Once the product has reached the brokers connection it will earn about a pound The farther south it goes the more it makes If it manages to make it all the way out east to areas like New York the price is driven even higher somewhere between and a pound Stricter laws demand higher prices and in turn provide more profits In Miami seven to eight pounds of bud will trade for one kilo of pure yayo cocaine That in turn makes its way back up to Canada eh and sells for anywhere from to a key If the marijuana manages to stay in the province it will usually sell for around to a pound depending on how flooded the market is This is just the tip of the iceberg The union embodies a slew of businesses and services generating profits both directly and indirectly for the province Some know they are involved and others choose not to acknowledge the benefits they gain from it Carpenters build tables rooms sheds and anything else thats needed for a grow show Brandnew homes are being built expressly for the purpose of housing a marijuana grow operation Electricians set up lights wire the electrical components divert power if necessary Hardware stores provide construction materials to build rooms and growoperation structures Hydroponics stores supply lights nutrients soil and other equipment needed to grow Seed sellers provide well seeds Clone growers create clones from other marijuana plants to aid in quicker growth cycles Realestate agencies market houses to growers unknowingly but they profit all the same There are some Realtors though who are directly involved in the union and will actually cater to growers needs finding houses in secluded areas with big basements and power that can be spliced and stolen Mortgage brokers and lease brokers who help growers with poor credit get the houses they need to start up Banks who have minimal security to prevent illegal money from being deposited The way it works now is deposits over are sometimes questioned but are left up to the teller to decide whether the deposit is suspicious If they believe it is they may put a note on the account It isnt until a deposit that a mandatory form is filled out and sent away but it is possible for deposits to go through with little question Oh you sold some motorbikes cool Oh you sold your boat neat thanks for the business You get the point Lawyers and law firms provide counseling on how to make grow money legit They help set up and incorporate companies and holding companies to launder money They also provide legal counsel to keep busted growers out of jail The electric company who makes money off of enlarged electric bills due to excess lights The only time they seem to get involved is when they think someone is stealing the power Law enforcement receives budgets to fight the cultivation They create special task forces like the Green Team to specifically target marijuana Canadians spend to on law enforcement and the justice system to enforce marijuana laws Police also receive the benefits of seizing growers and dealers assets And last but definitely not least everyday businesses bars restaurants clothing stores boat dealerships car dealerships the money funneled indirectly through various everyday businesses Growers and dealers like to spend money on everything These growers after they crop out its like they won the lottery You can tell the ones who are selling it The more they sell the more blingbling they have on them You think they just hold it themselves and tuck it away somewhere No they buy houses they buy cars they buy boats Theyll purchase restaurants theyll purchase you know mean whatever theyre into Maybe thats why we got busted got too carried away You can tell yourself youre not gonna let it go to your head but said the same thing But when the money comes in so easy you get accustomed to that lifestyle and before you know it you become a steamer you become a hot rod And thats what it comes down to Yes organized crime moves a majority of the product once its available on the market but there arent a lot of bikers out there watering plants Its maandpa operations its young guys who see opportunity Its not easy to make that type of money doing anything especially if youve been going to school for the past four years and you see this random other guy you know watering plants in his basement coming out of it with an extreme amount of money Interesting you had your degree Yeah And then youre in the Yeah made the choice to put that aside and start growing weed could be making which is a great wage but really Why would wanna do that when have the knowledge to make in a whole year in two months What have we learned so far Well one the Prohibition hasnt reduced the demand and it certainly hasnt reduced the supply Two its a steady source of revenue for organized crime which in turn attracts young people because the money is so easy And three being an underground market actually creates crime and violence And yet the only one paying the costs for all of this are the taxpayers people like you and me Even further this whole deal is over a drug that seems to pose no more of a threat than the substances we already regulate At the very least why isnt this up for debate Dwight Eisenhower once spoke of a militaryindustrial complex Have we built up a marijuana Prohibition complex The real war on marijuana didnt start until and President Nixon he said its all the Jews smoking pot mean he really said that Jack When Nixon got into this with his War on Drugs he had things that he wanted to do He had an agenda Todd lot of the information that was kept and warehoused in the Library of Congress and also at major universities was actually recalled and destroyed The Nixon report that came out through his administration was called the Shafer Report It was by a Republican governor and when he studied it and gave an ounce for it You can pick this report up pick up any page open it and if you actually have experience with cannabis youll realize theyre telling the truth Dana And then when it came back saying that marijuana was essentially harmless he totally ignored it said Were going to launch a War on Drugs anyways Todd They didnt even print as many copies that Congress and the House would have been able to see the War on Drugs detectives was one of them They designated of us undercover happened to fall in that Thats where spent the next years of my life What we were targeted on was the pot smokers There was a very good reason we were targeted on the pot smokers Most of them were protesting against the Vietnam War If you could arrest that whole group of people because they were smoking pot you didnt have to have a Vietnam War protest which Mr Nixon thought was a pretty good idea So when President Nixon declared this civil war that were living in right now the drug war in it was really a war on marijuana It really didnt kick in until the s when Reagan you know took over his presidency of the man Ronald Reagan he said These young people they get together they read books they smoke marijuana and they talk Like these three elements were a recipe for disaster How do feel about legalizing marijuana Am for it or against it am totally against legalizing marijuana applause Make no mistake the government the focus of their War on Drugs is cannabis The focus of their rhetoric is cannabis Greg Its certainly used as a poster child for all drugs When you see an ad for drugs its always the marijuana leaf that goes up Its almost like a religious jihad More powerful than going for the gusto It causes people to think when people think they question they question things like say the war in Vietnam or race separation of blacks and whites like they did in the s in the jazz clubs or womens rights or the Gulf War or oil wars Joe Its real simple You put your loafers on you put your black socks on you get in your car you have your briefcase you say hi to your neighbors He mows his lawn just like you do and things keep moving along in the same direction they always have been Thats why marijuana laws exist Norm There are in my opinion people in government at all levels of government who know that its not a winnable war and yet they continue to pursue it Acceptance of drug use is simply not an option for this administration Often we go to debates and its a police officer debating us Okay the police are supposed to enforce the laws They should not be arguing for or against laws Thats not their job Well what is their job Is it to enforce laws that exist on the books or to determine the policy of the laws that are made The way to justify the policy is to create a lot of fear and then spend a lot of money combating that Quite frankly if you took the using population of all the other illegal drugs combined and you eliminated cannabis from that equation there wouldnt be a big enough drug problem in either this country or the United States to justify the massive expenditures that go towards fighting the war The amazing thing is a small amount of enforcement is necessary million is spent annually in Canada arresting and prosecuting marijuana crimes The total budget in Canada for all drugs is million That means of the drug budget goes towards arresting and prosecuting marijuana users leaving for crack heroin coke crystal meth the daterape drug whatever Norm The drugenforcement industry is big business Its selfperpetuating it relies on taxpayer dollars Marc And so its an endless battle that the doesnt win they participate in Its like doing a bigbudget movie you know You get million to do a movie and then the movie comes out and it doesnt make any money but someone made million Every once in awhile theyll show a guy posing beside a big bunch of marijuana You know This is the money at work It would be like asking loggers about saving trees you know what mean This is where their mainstay of their cash flow comes from The campaign will continue until every available known plot of marijuana has been eradicated Weve got to live with it doing the best job we can Even if its a bad job Were all carrying a pretty impossible load Ms Gibson Norm There are many many police officers however who believe that it ought to be legalized regulated and controlled They see the hypocrisy between our existing laws relating to alcohol and marijuana in their daytoday life shift after shift after shift and they get it But they dont wanna lose their jobs They dont wanna lose that promotion to sergeant or the assignment to detectives They wanna be a chief someday and they dont wanna piss off the people in power Judges lawyers prosecutors defense lawyers prison guards Theres all of those people in the criminaljustice industry Are their interests being protected Well in a sense yes they are Defense bar similarly we make money The more things they prohibit the more money we make Sorry m late Kent was delayed in court John You still have large numbers of people being busted for simple possession If you look at the stats in terms of drug offenses the largest group are still simple possession of marijuana Every time you blow a marijuana cigarette you take a chance on blowing your future Oh come on Pop all my friends smoke pot Theyre not criminals Only because they havent been caught yet If you do drugs you will be caught and when youre caught you will be punished Ian are charged with pot possession Thats nearly a million people and whether you go to jail or not your life is in serious trouble And that number of annual arrests for marijuana now rivals the number of arrests for murder rape robbery and aggravated assault combined You willnever get over a conviction conviction will track you every day for the rest of your life For instance you remember that guy that used to smoke but didnt inhale former President Bill Clinton This is not a big issue with me never even had a drink of whiskey till was Now if Mr Clinton handed me that marijuana cigarette when he was standing in a circle with us it wouldnt have mattered whether he had inhaled or not he would have become a dope dealer wouldnt he Just like all those other people that went to jail never to be an attorney much less the president of the United States But the marijuana laws protect us They make our lives safer They send us the correct moral message Thats how out of nations have gone down the drain before us Internal decay The breakdown of moral ethical and religious principles If youve been caught a young person in the with so much as one marijuana cigarette you cant get a loan or a grant from the government to go to college If youve been convicted of murdering somebody or raping someone no problem you go right down theyll give you the loan guess the message is its okay to rape and murder and pillage just dont smoke a joint afterwards Tod First thing that John Ashcroft did after sent out a strike force to take down the Cannabis Buyers Coop That really helped national security a great deal And what else helps national security Taking down top criminal targets In the government put aside money to do just that of Osama bin Laden million each for the whereabouts of Uday and Qusay Hussein Saddams sons and a million budget to go after one of the most dangerous men of all this man host Can you tell us what exactly you were charged with was charged with conspiring to sell paraphernalia Operation Pipe Dreams was a brainstorm of Attorney General John Ashcroft The Internet has been illegally utilized to sell these illegal products and to facilitate large illegal businesses operating in the open sting operation that busted people for selling paraphernalia to a particular county in Pennsylvania where they were willing to prosecute Tommy Because theres two states Pennsylvania Iowa Void where prohibited Well it was prohibited to send it to Pennsylvania and Iowa man like yourself that is an established actor comedian youre not a criminal Why do you think they targeted you Well because our movies were numberone rentals in America What our movies did was really show the hypocrisy of the pot laws In fact when went to jail they added in the transcript that our movies have influenced children for years and will continue to do so forever Therefore should go to jail You gotta remember they were going into Iraq and they needed some diversion as far as headlines go and they equated the billiondollar paraphernalia business with aiding terrorists This was a legitimate company paying taxes was just the face on the bong They chargedme had nothing to do with the company never shipped anything to anybody Craig It wasnt even his company he just loaned his name to it Operation Pipe Dreams Only one person Tommy Chong went to jail But if didnt plead they threatened my son and my wife Tommy stands up and volunteers to go to jail Says Yeah okay thats my paraphernalia Leave my wife and kid alone hes protecting his family What kind of force was used in the day you were arrested There was over Visors automatic weapons helicopters overhead They had news trucks Fox News trucks outside They had the media on the ready This was a photoop for everybody They asked you know do have any drugs said Yeah got pot you know And they wanted to know where it was so told them They said Well its not really a drug bust said Well then what the are you doing in my house Then they said Its about bongs Were bringing down all the bong companies in America And with Tommy safely behind bars for nine months the United States drug war reset its sights this time across borders In downtown Vancouver just outside the consulate a bunch of people had gotten together and were having a rally for this guy named Marc Emery He had evidently been selling seeds marijuana seeds to the wrong people Let me tell you the wants me because am very good at what do Well obviously m the most dangerous man alive Like really No wonder m facing life imprisonment without parole for something that no ones ever gone to jail for here in Canada No ones ever gone to jail for seeds not even for a day Marc and two of his employees are facing life in prison in the United States not Canada the United States for selling marijuana seeds over the Internet Vancouver Police came in here with a warrant for an extradition but we were taken then to North Fraser Correctional Center Correctional Center of the Year Beautiful facility Marc Emery has gotten in the face of the United States Kirk The sees Marc Emery as a major political threat to its anticannabis agenda Dana In a press release from Karen Tandy head of the she said that this is not only the end of marijuana trafficking but its a blow to the marijuanalegalization movement gave just under million away over years to Supreme Court challenges ballot initiatives political parties you know drugaddiction clinics Well if youre the who the hell do you think youre gonna go after first and foremost and as viciously as you can do it think they even admitted it themselves on the day of the raid The announced you know Hes a legalizer Were shutting down one of the biggest legalizers The legalization movement wont have a pot of money to draw from Ha ha ha ha Marc Emery has never gone to America and sold a seed He does it all from here by mail order and its akin to Canadians ordering you know a machine gun from somewhere in America Its against the law and if we receive it here in Canada they come and arrest us for receiving the machine gun They dont go to America and say to Colt Hi were arresting you cause you sent a machine gun to someone in Canada No ones been sentenced to any time in jail in the history of Canada in years weve had this law Two people me and Ian Hunter in Victoria were fined Theres all sorts of seed businesses still open Marcs the only one out of about businesses in Canada thats been charged Marc has been paying the Canadian federal government taxes on income he has made from selling seeds The government relied on the existence of these Internet seed sellers so that patients who had qualified for medical marijuana exemptions who were bugging them for seed were being directed to these Internet seeds and Marc Emery specifically in some cases as the place to get their seed It puts Canada and our government in a very difficult position because theyve either got to hand over a Canadian citizen to a foreign government for activities that were entirely done in Canada for which our own government and our own police are not willing to charge him If the Canadian authorities who rubberstamped this shit think that what ve done is so bad then charge me should be tried by a jury of my peers m not about to be tried by my peers at all m about to be tried by foreigners At a time synonymous with smoking marijuana everyone lit up and for those who didnt have marijuana to light up Again the police were close by and again they didnt seem to care One officer mentioned she was bothered by the smell of the smoke It was kind of confusing How could we be sending Marc Emery to prison for life in the United States if even our own police arent finding it worth their while to bust people smoking it right in front of them Thats not the only thing thats confusing The marijuana thats consumed in the United States how much comes from Canada dont know much about Canada dont either Maybe ll go with host And a quarter would say about Yeah At least of it Whoo dont think its all that much Most of it is here Were getting the drugs and are saying Oh you know bud This was when some of the people in Canada were trying to get marijuana legalized John Walters went up there and said What youre talking about is passing a law that will allow you to export poison to my country When we talk about poison exporting poison what do we export to Canada Cigarettes the United States every year from ingesting cigarettes Five million around the world So whos exporting the poison here Of the six million people who could benefit from treatment that need it in the United States today on marijuana man Lies lies lies You know they invitedme m sorry wasnt sure who invited him and why he came here yet again Hes been here before He needs to shake his head So how about him shutting down the cocaine thats coming across the border How about him shutting down the guns Sometimes you feel like youve stepped into Alice in Wonderland youve gone through the looking glass In fact more Colombians die from tobacco than Americans die from Colombian coca products So whats the drug war really about Because if you dont want American tobacco in your country America will go to war in a trade sense with your country You have Canada engage in cannabispolicy reform and taxing and regulating cannabis and all the scare stories havent come true you have an awfully hard time sustaining your own domestic policies host What do you think would happen between Canada and the if Canada were to legalize marijuana Theres been rumors that theyre like Well shut down the border dont think so ve heard that too but then my question is do you want you know in the dark and thirsty If you do that then were not gonna ship oil were not gonna ship water were not gonna ship electricity Its not gonna happen Were too important to each other Greg The softwoodlumber people gonna stop doing business The fishing guys gonna stop doing business Are the people who manufacture stuff back and forth across the border gonna stop doing business cause pots legal here Kirk Business interests arent gonna sit still for losing millions of dollars a day because of borderwait times simply because Canada takes a different domestic social policy on cannabis Yes business interests Sometimes they just seem to pop up and every so often in the most unlikely of places We have seen an explosion in prison construction that lags only slightly behind the explosion in incarceration There are more people in jail in America now than ever before In the United States its one of the fastestgrowing industries Darryl Some major investment companies at one time described private prisons as one of the best investments you could make So you could make more money building prisons than any other type of investment Norm Theyre extraordinarily expensive to build Theyre even far more expensive to operate and maintain Right now in the United States of America the biggest growth industry is the privatized prison complex Japan for instance incarcerates at people per population The United States incarcerates at a rate of people per population In a year period the prison population in the United States quadrupled Norm We have just shy of of the worlds population and almost Even South Africa at its worst didnt have as many prisoners per capita as America has now Texas just built prisons in about the last years Norm We find state treasuries on the verge of bankruptcy as a result of prison construction Some think there wont be room for them in jail Well make room Were almost doubling prison space Some think there arent enough prosecutors Well hire them with the largest increase in federal prosecutors in history In the late s there were about five privately run prisons in the United States By that number had reached over As soon as youve accumulated a certain amount of capital from building prisons you can start investing that in ensuring job security ensuring therell always be more prisoners around to require more prisons We have private prisons What the fuck is that How did that happen How can you profit over people going to jail Thats scary thats a bad bad sign Our society is in deep deep deep trouble if nobodys looking into that Correctionalguard unions have become powerful lobbying groups pushing for longer sentences on lessserious crimes Californias has become one of the most powerful in the state The California Department of Corrections budget rose from to billion in Between and overall local and state spending on corrections across the country grew almost times the rate in which spending on education increased And prisons arent the only thing moneys being spent on Stephen There are millions of drug tests per year Theres money to be made on that its huge It started off with people saying We really need to test people in dangerous occupations Things like police officers should be tested pilots in airplanes Then somebody said Well our athletes we should probably test them for drugs too Then somebody came along and said Well its not just the professional athletes How about the athletes in colleges and high schools They need to be tested too And then they thought a little harder and they said Well suppose we just test everybody that goes out for an extracurricular activity That should be constitutional because they dont have to do that So now if you want to join the chess club at school or the French club you gotta pee in a bottle Now theyre pushing to make laws to test all children at school All the studies show this doesnt have anything to do with whether kids use drugs or not so it looks to me like this has a lot more to do with the money thats being made for drug testing Can you imagine how much money will be involved if we can randomly test every child in a school Greg lot of these places that have been urinetesting have refused to continue to do it because the only thing that these urine tests are finding is marijuana The other drugs that people take dissipate from their systems fast enough to not be found Jack If they smoke a marijuana cigarette pee in a bottle theyre gonna show that theyve had a drug But if they use a hard drug heroin cocaine methamphetamine in a long weekend nobody can tell that theyve used that drug So what does that say to our young people It says if you dont wanna get caught dont use the soft drugs use the hard drugs Stephen Its not just urine anymore its hair and saliva Theyll do blood testing Theres industry there this is money Theyre not doing in it for free The most profitable industry in the United States is pharmaceuticals Dollars involved is just staggering Can it really be Has medicine really become that profitable The fact is it has In prescriptiondrug sales rose to billion and global pharmaceutical sales rose to billion Now why would pharmaceuticals be threatened by a plant The answer may be as simple as one word natural because a significant amount of research to date has confirmed or suggested that marijuana in its natural state is still the most effective form Can you imagine a world where you or wouldnt have to pay for certain medicines After dealing with about patients over the last years would say that over different medical conditions respond favorably to cannabis John It appears to have benefits that we never ever knew about Glaucoma Epilepsy muscular dystrophy Arthritis Multiple sclerosis Wasting syndrome Nausea chronic pain Depression anxiety hepatitis cancer Chemo patients host Is there a product out there today that provides as many medical benefits as cannabis No It remains an unutilized major resource Lester The way to riches in the pharmaceutical industry is to have a drug which can be patented Todd Cannabis is problematic right from the start because its a multimolecule drug Paul In it wasnt possible to patent plants and thats the reason that Pharma never picked up on this because by synthesizing and owning compounds thats where the profit motive comes into the pharmaceutical industry The patent in the United States lasts for years You can charge whatever you want at that time and thats where you make the killing Theres no money to be made off natural plants If you can use a natural medicine that you can grow in your own home which costs pennies to use youre gonna do that Joe You need water and dirt Not only that you have that plant forever James Prime motivation behind any drug company is to make money and as much money as possible Joe Theyre corporations and corporations everybody knows its like that diffusion of responsibility thing Theres so many people working for corporations that they lose their humanity Dana So those potential customers for these pharmaceutical companies that are not there if theyre using a natural plant Its unlimited Grow more you get more medicine Pharmaceutical companies dont want you growing your own medicine The government supported a small drug company by the name of Unimed to take a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol and to put it into capsules to be used as a oral medicine This became Marinol This in Marinol is exactly the same carbon molecule thats in herbal marijuana But its not the same as medical marijuana Its not a crude mixture of things and theres no guarantee that you get the same results Paul You can make a synthetic delta tetrahydrocannabinol in a test tube Itll have exactly the same number of atoms in the same arrangement but how in the test tube can you put the electron spins together the subatomic quirks and quarks if you like of that compound in the same way that a biologicalenzyme system will put it together it cant happen James In the case of a synthetic compound if its only an ingredient from the cannabis they can formulate that as a drug and make a lot more money out of it host Were confused that if you know you keep hearing that theres no scientific proof to medicinal benefits of marijuana why are there drugs like Marinol on the market Why do they even exist Lester Well thats part of this doubletalk about it If we take and change it a little bit so youbelieve it isnt marijuana then its okay its a great medicine You know theyre trying to make marijuana into medicine because itismedicine Why did the government actually grow marijuana mean the government has had marijuana programs that existed since the s Its impossible for me to believe that the government even believes their own propaganda What do believe is this that you can fool some of the people some of the time and theyre doing an excellent job of that And for all the claims of these drugs being a more viable medicine because theres no high we checked some of the side effects For Marinol dizziness feelings of exaggerated happiness drowsiness Last time checked those were signs of getting high If it is indeed side effects of marijuana that are preventing the pharmaceutical world from accepting marijuana as a viable medicine then they better start paying more attention to the products theyve been marketing for years Every year prescription medicines kill over people Tod The pharmaceutical industry has been excellent at convincing the public that they need their potions If you watch any kind of commercial for drugs theyre always using the third person For example Where does a headache come from It comes from out there somewhere Dont sell the steak sell the sizzle How many people in this country alone are addicted to antidepressants How many people who are on antidepressants really have imbalances and how many of them just got off a bad relationship and theyre depressed John It seems to be acceptable to give people something as long as youre wearing a white smock or youre giving them a legal prescription It doesnt matter how deadly the particular drug might be in terms of side effects Paul What we call modern medicine is actually alternative medicine because its highly experimental Its often dangerous often toxic and it kills a lot of people To me its crazy Theres a lot of stuff out there that will affect you in different ways Look at aspirin heroin both invented by Bayer host thought heroin came from opium seeds and was Just natural effective opium You keep making it more and more concentrated No you have to add certain chemicals to it and tweak it a certain way It doesnt just come from opium itself What was heroin made for As a cure for morphine addiction and coughs Heroin the sedative for coughs Pseudoephedrine Thats the main ingredient in methamphetamine is to cure the cough the cold You get a cold Oh think ll do some meth When you look at it from a large perspective like whats weed Even Francis Young the s own judge who took medical testimony for over two weeks made this statement Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man Yet despite this and the evermounting number of realworld patient success stories cannabis remains listed as a Schedule narcotic Under that category marijuana is classified as having no known medical value have mmmultipple sclerosis When we first met Greg his shaking was so severe he informed us that he would need a few puffs of marijuana in order to participate in the interview The difference was night and day host What do you say to those that say marijuana needs to be tested and regulated and have the high taken out for pharmaceutical companies to consider it a valuable medicine Huh Thats a pretty and only mean this as a measurement as to how much it is actually a pathetic thing to say mean just look at me Is it not blatantly obvious that have just enjoyed however many tokes look happy Greg has been using marijuana for years and stated to us that hes never experienced any negative effects m never fake panting need need my marijuana Thats stupid It takes away my discomfort lets call it It does enhance my very being Where do think youd be if you didnt get to smoke it like dealing with your pain Huh would have found a way host How does the training and education of medical doctors today work against the acceptance of prescribing marijuana as medicine Well it works against them because theyre brought right from the beginning right into the fold of the pharmaceutical industry Reading journals reading these advertisements or theyre reading papers on drugs that were financed by the drug companies or theyre being seduced by the companies Fancy dinners a trip for a weekend Would you like to have rounds of golf And some of them get outright money from the drug companies Rielle ve met doctors who said when they first came out of medical school they didnt know what to do It was really overwhelming They had live patients in front of them who needed help They were very happy to have representatives tell them what medicines would be best for their patients Lester So doctors have a bias toward the products of pharmaceutical industries They do not readily accept the idea that a simple plant or herb may be useful dont know if they think its hocuspocus just think that they dont feel that theres the kind of testing that theyre used to James Thats the problem we have What try to impress upon these people is were trying to put the science into it and yet some people are very resistant to even attempts to do that All of the funding is coming directly or indirectly from the drug companies and these people obviously for obvious reasons are determining the agendas Paul Now think of the lobbying potential behind the most profitable industry in the United States Think of the power and do they get their way Why cant we explore its medicinal potential Why cant we use it to make more products To myself and people involved in this business it stopped making sense a long time ago The common response is really that medical marijuana is a stalking horse for legalizing it And so what What do they want We should be making use of this plant and really thats all can say The restriction the Prohibition is all in my mind just stupidity and dont condone stupidity And thats a problem how do politicians after years of promoting claims of marijuanas harms pushing for larger drugwar budgets constructing political platforms based on a stance that vilifies marijuana and being lobbied by Big Business how do these same politicians now reverse their stance What politician can come before their constituents today and say marijuana should be decriminalized when yesterday they said it was evil and dangerous Their constituents are gonna wanna know why you changed your mind Were you lying to us or were you stupid Either way youre not getting elected next time Lester Whoops we made a mistake You million people should not have been arrested some of you jailed some of you fined some of you lost the handle on your career One way to bypass this problem in the face of evergrowing empirical evidence is to divert attention Add a word medicinal Put the word medicinal in front of marijuana and you are now talking about something completely different if youre a politician Why is there a perception that healthy people are affected differently and unable to fend off the detrimental consequences whereas a person with a lowered immune system or terminal illness seems to experience none of these effects Neil Some people go home at the end of the day and they drink to kind of wash away the day You know just like Oh that was a hard day need a few drinks relax kick back So is that relieving pain Maybe or is it pursuing pleasure dont know So if you think about this in the context of cannabis it also has relevance The governments lot more likely to forgive cannabis use if its for relief from pain If its in pursuit of pleasure thats a problem and think that points to something about our culture thats a little bit odd What works for one doesnt necessarily work for another man The fatherson confrontation Mom smokes like a chimney And you have a drink every day and smoke too Its not the same Why not You can get cancer your liver can rot away They believe today and m disappointed in the media that it hasnt brought this information this new information to the people of this country more than it has they believe that marijuana could well turn out to be the most dangerous drug that is in use in our country today If youre a politician you can get elected on a gettoughoncrime platform Were gonna lock up all the marijuana cultivators for a long time cause youre preying on the fears of the public Spokesmen for giant specialinterest groups whether those specialinterest groups be law enforcement or whether theyre private prisons or whether theyre pharmaceutical companies or whether theyre oil companies we have spokesmen for gigantic corporations that are trying to calm us and get us to press the right button in the voting booth Todd Everybody that gets in has their own agenda Theyre beholden to their own lobbyists so they dont go in and check the work of anybody before them Thats not their job because God forbid somebody come in there and check what they do afterwards understand why politicians may be reluctant to act on their principles but our politicians need to read their own polls because this is one of those cases and it happens a lot in life where the people are ahead of their leaders host Hempfest the largest event for cannabis in the world a showcase of modernday hemp Sure they used the stuff but what good is hemp in a world like today world that appears to have everything it needs It opens a whole new market It opens a whole new market on every level Dana You can harvest off the seeds you can harvest out the inner pulp and the longstem fibers The fiber itself is the strongest natural fiber in the world Todd All the clothes m wearing today for this interview are hemp All the clothes actually always wear are made out of hemp Been so since probably when realized could buy clothes made out of organic fibers that lasted longer than cotton Joe You can eat hemp seeds and it contains all the essential amino acids and fatty acids It makes fuel you can make biodiesel out of it Hemp is an excellent source for biofuel When you grow hemp for fuel every crop unleashes a huge amount of oxygen into the environment and in fact the same amount of oxygen that you lose when you burn it off you gain back so its a closed cycle ending the greenhouse effect Steve There are so many hundreds of strains of industrial hemp that you could grow hemp almost anywhere in the world Not everywhere in the world but almost everywhere in the world so just that alone makes it a resource for fuel David That is a solution is to stop using fossil fuels and nuclear energy stop using them entirely and using wind and wave and sun more and these biofuels Steve People will get it especially as the gas prices go up Its the highest quality paper there is mean its archival quality The words treefree paper dont make sense to people Hemp paper that you find in the museums that are hundreds of years old havent even yellowed To supplement the wood we could solve the deforestation problem host Why isnt it costeffective to use hemp versus the forest industry right now The simple answer is because you cant grow the hemp in the United States Joe As far as human beings are concerned its probably one of the most useful plants ever if notthemost useful plant ever And its illegal Industrial hemp is not a drug Though it is of the same species as marijuana it is a completely different variety of plant similar to comparing a Chihuahua with a St Bernard You cant get high from industrial hemp but you can get high from marijuana This is the only industrialized country in the world that doesnt grow industrial hemp mean think how crazy it is that we can eat the product we can sell the product we can wear the product we can export the product import it manufacture it everything but grow it We cant grow this thing its criminal And there you have it After two years of research our quest for answers has only left us with more questions And the only thing that really seems to make sense is that none of it makes any sense Its a weird thing that you do when you make nature against the law Were worried about things going extinct and yet the policy on the most useful plant in the world is that they should all be eliminated and driven to extinction Absolutely they should still be concerned about youngsters using it But were concerned about youngsters using alcohol tobacco driving automobiles whatever But that it should be the kind of Prohibition that it is now rather than regulation It cannot be sustained in a rational society believe that it would be more ignorant of me to listen to somebody whos trying to oppress me than it would be to just ignore the ignorant and go on with what think is right Even now this interview is being conducted and smoked pot all morning This is what look like high Theres a great quote that Life is a tragedy to those who feel and a comedy to those who think And if you are a thinker and you look at the marijuana situation and youre not laughing youre fucking dumb host Do you think marijuana will ever be legalized in Canada or the United States Yes dont know about the United States but it will be legalized in Canada wont be alive to see it used to believe it was right around the corner back in the s Check out the gray hair confess to being believe it will happen didnt used to As recently as two or three years ago was convinced it was not gonna happen in my lifetime wish you didnt ask me that question but would say think it will be Its always a possibility There can be breakthroughs to reason All we have to do to end it is get of Congress plus one human being to say its over and its over Theres a movement in this country and some people have more faith in it than do Maybe from hosting Fear Factor all those years ve lost my faith in human beings and their intelligence think its inevitable believe that the truth will set us free and think the truth is infectious And think that while cannabis per se is not addictive learning about it quickly becomes When published Marijuana Reconsidered in the last chapter predicted that once people understood these things about marijuana the Prohibition would be gone and it would be gone in ten years Carl Sagan who was a very good friend of mine read the manuscript and he said Lester youre so pessimistic ten years You know well here we are you know and nothing has happened Nonetheless it cant help but happen mean you cant sustain a lie like that forever
