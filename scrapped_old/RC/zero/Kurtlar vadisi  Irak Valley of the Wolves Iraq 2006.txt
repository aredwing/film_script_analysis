that l cannot kill them Let me tell you something l dont kill them l dont abuse them lf l did that what would be the difference between you and me Let me tell you the difference You cannot sacrifice

honesty Dont ever be afraid Human beings are born free with the right to live freely Youre wonderful it was great Everybody strip now ld like to see you all naked in one minute Everyone take your clothes off Everyone will be stark naked Now Welcome to hell You cant survive here Youll burn here for eternity Youll only find pain here Do you want to ease your pain Sorry for you terrorists You ought to think about it before you became terrorists God dont let anything bad happen to them Let them arrive soon God dont let Abdulhey sit on the wrong chair Dont leave me alone here in this place God lt didnt explode Boss lt did Abdulhey you werent clumsy as l usual l hope l want to stay alive and fight my Sheikh Only the Allah wills are important not yours The ones who have religious faith do not lose anything when they die However as long as they are alive it remains unknown what will happen The only thing you can do now is to pray for others Those prayers will all come back to you as Allahs mercy Leyla Allah witnessed all that happened lf only l were killed too Stand up my daughter Stand up You the groveling cannibal What are you doing Kissing the ground l will show you how to pray now Come on Hurry up Where are you taking me to Go Go Dont you have fear of God Arent you afraid Kill these disgusting men Show them what torture means Allahu Aqbar The God is the greatest My husband has died for Gods sake lf l shed even a single tear for him let God damn me But why did they kill Ali Why him l swear l will walk towards them with bombs tied around me to blast those murderers Then they will understand how many of them are worth of one Leyla Dad please let me kill them all together with myself How can you think l could approve such an action How could one who has chosen the way of Allah wish that How could one who comprehends lslam desire this But what else can l do Leyla choosing to be a suicide bomber means revolting against Allahs will in two ways by a single action lt means first giving up your hope and committing suicide and then accepting the risk of sacrificing innocent people together with your enemy Can you know how many will die when youre a suicide bomber You cant And since it not possible to know that killing innocent people is like killing the whole humanity People who instilled this idea into the minds of Muslims and recruited them as suicide bombers are the ones who recreate Hasan Sabbahs wickedness again This is a sign of domesday my daughter and is certainly evil l see your grief However l feel sorry to see your desire to be one of the suicide bombers who make the world think that Muslims are terrorists Never forget that Allah isnt helpless my daughter our current helplessness and weakness is due to our deviation from The Quran and our Prophets way and also due to our failure to be united Each suicidal act increases this weakness and helplessness Thats why our enemies desire the number of such acts to increase Moreover they may have already organized these actions themselves already Our only hope for survival is to commit to Allahs way We must to pray Allah in order to wite and be free Selaam Alaikum Alaikum Selaam Welcome its nice to see you Hasan Agha Here are my comrades Polat and Memati And this is Abdulhey Glad to meet you He worked for Turkish Special Forces and had many assignments out of the country On his last mission he had to have facial plastic surgery to infiltrate the Turkish Mafia causing it to collapse And he did it almost singlehandedly What about the others They are his team also Special Forces Are they on assignment for the government No not officially Of course its not officially What is wrong with you They allocated the mountains to the Kurds the deserts to the Arabs and the oil to themselves Theres nowhere left for us to go This wasnt planned today He doesnt even let us see each other independently Weve got to hold our meetings under his supervision Do you have an upcoming meeting Yes Where At the bazaar Have you gone out of your mind lm here to save peoples lives You are trying to save the rich lf you leave me no chance lll report you to the authorities you know l can do it You are my friend but we should never forget why we are here l have always been here before risking my life for your safety l set the Kurds Turks and Arabs fighting one another But youre complaining about a cheap kidney to me Are you kidding How could you be so selfish Could you stop putting pressure on me Leave me in peace Do you know how l can hardly handle it all Do you Dont bother me with such minor details l only want your men to behave well to the convicts l need them l dont ever mind whom you kill lt doesnt interest me how many you kill or why you kill them l only ask you to order your men not to shoot convicts on the way as long as they bring those people to me l need their organs alive lll do it l understand lts all right Youll go out sooner or later Havent you started yet How could we before you arrive Very kind of you Have you found the hotel bombers yet Unfortunately not sir Were investigating the matter to the smallest detail l dont think you get me l have a single aim which is to hold lraqis together And then to form a permanent government as proof of the fact that you could all live here in peace But as long as you continue your alliance with Turks and you with Arabs and you insist on establishing an independent Kurdish state peace can never be established on this land l only object to this polarization gentlemen Can l have a cold orange juice please But you dont treat us as equals We are guilty because we created Saddam Were all terrorists to you Why are the people at the wedding declared terrorists Just because they fired through the sky No The real reason is that you keep on training terrorists and bombers All right Tell me about your problems lll try to find the solutions Look Our villages are not being evacuated due to labour as mentioned before Villager families are systematically forced to migrate by madeup excuses And not only ours but also Arab villages are being evacuated too ls that true Abu Tarik Unfortunately yes And there is only one reason for that Oil We are being forced out of oil sites in Mosul and Kirkuk one by one Oil is the greatest value of this land Dont we have a right to it Of course you do But we must ensure security first Then we will address economic matters You cant expect me to share this wealth among you in the absence of stability How are you Well lm fine Now lets move on to concrete demands as you wish lm listening to you Unfortunately there are a lot of innocent Arabs who were arrested or taken into police custody due to alleged connections to terrorist organizations There are many families who lost their close relatives in these custody cases lll take care of this personally Our demand is clear and apparent We want the families who were forced out of their villages to come back safe and sound From now on Kurds must also give up treating us like a minority l will take care of the migrated families lf any problems exist about their present accommodation lll do my best to ensure their safe return We need more financial support for security and stability reasons and more educated men for the development of the region ln fact there isnt a single trainee in the Cl who hasnt memorized the Kurdish translation of such sentences over the last twenty years Hey Abu Ali Where are you going To Ali l beg you for Gods sake Dont do that Leyla leave this place Please stop For Gods sake Gentlemen thank you very much The meal was wonderful Can l speak with you for a moment please Privately ld also like to speak to you indeed Thank goodness Lets go This may hurt a little lf it does we can use morphine How dare they lt is pure insolence Considering the life they have here there are people dying to go to heaven with the aim of reaching that life of happiness beyond the veil No l dont understand those who have a dream of going to heaven and yet do not embrace our Lord Jesus Christ So you can go to heaven but l cant ls that what you mean Christ bequeathed this world to you when he died We were chosen by him in order to set up His kingdom lve no objection to it But my folks are the only ones who can bargain with God Thats why they wouldnt leave Heaven to anyone else l suppose What do you say Morphine Sir One of Polats men disguised as a bodyguard was reported to be at the scene Well bring that Turkmen leader to me Yes sir Anybody coming No Boss Any news from Agha Thankfully he is good boss They took him to hospital for examination Who was the bomber We dont know boss Go and get the news then This way Stop Well wait here Dont tell anything l havent told All right Agha Hasan you asked to talk to me in private What was it about Were you going to say Sam a bomb is going to go off in a few seconds or was it Sam the men that l hired from Turkey will open fire on you and your men after the bomb explodes Which one was it Where have you been The road was not clear boss Weve got to leave this place lt is not safe Agha But you are treating us unfairly again We were all there that is to say we all were in danger Hasan lm going to ask you one more time Where is he Polat Alemdar Polat Alemdar Where is Polat Alemdar Surround the house quick They are runnig away hurry Come on to the trucks Quick Which direction are we going boss Well see Abdulhey Keep whats in the briefcase ready People live in these houses boss l didnt mean to blow up the houses

trying to trap us is she Well if its a trap then we will fight What the hell Go go go Move on Quick There is only me and my daughter What do you want from us Arent you ashamed for breaking into the house of a widow like me Can l help you Are you hiding anyone in your house There is no one except my grandma and me Where is your husband He is in Heaven Do you know what kills the Arabian men No What Their wives All the houses are clear Lets go You can go to hell for all l care They have left come up Whats your name Does it matter l would like to know the name of the person l owe Youll learn when you return it You have saved our lives Youve welcomed us into your home and showed us great hospitality But weve got to leave Americans are everywhere You have to wait some more time lf we wait for the Americans to leave we grow old here Leyla We need information from outside and move accordingly What information do you need Let me get it No you cant do it Maybe Abdulhey can but they will recognize him Here is the meal lf you go out with Erhan will you be able to walk around freely Sir Sometimes l want to revolt against you because you dont want me by your side Then l realize that my duties to you are not complete yet Blessed is the man who endures temptation or when he has been approved he will receive the crown of life May you glorify the souls of heroes departed and heroes yet to come May you give us peace May you always guide us These are sacrifices in a high calling the defense of our Lord and the peace of the world l try to fulfill my duties to you with all my might Sir This world was created so that l might prove my devotion to you through my deeds Before you return to this world grant me the ability to resolve the conflict in Babylon as you promised in the Holy Bible And as the next generations show their gratitude to their heroes who build the Kingdom of God what a great honour it would be for me should they remember me in their prayers When St Petrus left Rome my Lord you asked him Quo vadis Where are you going This is Babylon my homeland And you will never ask me where l am going to l promise l will fade away here my blood will water the soil of this land My blood will flow till the promised day comes that is till you return and that is till the promised land is ours When the promised land is ours peace will reign And the one who sets the peace will be Gods child Before you all l would like to share a surprise that l am not supposed to tell about actually We can never forget what Mr Marshall did for this country and for us As lraqis we have informed Baghdad of our gratitude to Mr Marshall And our honorable president has returned this gratitude by a small gift Mr Marshall You can call me Sam please Sam l would like you to accept the piano which is a gift from Saddams palace and is currently on the train coming here as an expression of the lraqi peoples gratitude to you Thank you Thank you very much l am honored honored very much Whats that Holly smoke Look Thank you very much Hey listen Turkmens are done with Now its the Arabs turn Take a photo of us together Allah weve heard your call and obeyed it Allah is always victorious However the situation seems whoever the winner or the loser is you are the only victorious and the only sovereign who rules it all Allah youre the one who even let our Prophet Mohammed take the test of defeat You never behave cruelly we have believed in and affirmed your clemency We have tormented ourselves by not uniting in your path the desires of our egos oppressing ourselves in the end Because we behaved cruelly to each other now our enemy is oppressing us My Allah Give us shelter from the oppressors and from your wrath as well We have been ignorent have become sinners then convicted and finally defeated We werent awoken by the wisdom of the Quran and The Sunna Prophets Way so youve awakened us with the assaults of our enemies Now grant us the ability and power to repel these assaults and confer us conscious patience and perseverance my Allah Allah ln reverence to our blessed Prophet who brought us the religion of peace lslam do not let us abandon his jurisprudence and morals that he remained true with utmost care even in times when he had no choice but to fight Tell them that we have guests You must not sit here lts not safe You can be spotted l am stuck in here because of Sam He is oppressing people and l cant do anything Sam is doing nothing new His oppression has nothing to do with you Nobody could want him killed more than me However we have no choice but to show patience How did you learn to be that patient The life has taught me the unbearable part of patience and my Sheikh taught me the bearable part of it Sheikh Abdurrahman Halis Kerkuki He brought me up What about your parents l have never seen my father And when my mother died l was too young to remember anything He brought me up just as he did all the orphans and the homeless What is your greatest ambition in life Leyla Before l had only one dream l used to close my eyes and imagined breathing my last breath in this land while staring at the stars That was my only dream then Now Now my only desire is to stab this dagger into that scoundrels heart Only then will l be able to understand if hes also got a heart or not And then l can die in peace lf l prevent you from realizing this desire will you be angry with me Chief how will we get on a moving train When it slows down well jump on Memati ls there nobody in charge of the piano lf there is well shoot him down What about the guns noise Then we will not shoot him but throw him off the train No we cant They would realize it then Hopefully nobody is there lf God wills lts coming Keep a protective eye on our visitors Dont get distressed over the high number of requests and complaints and dont get annoyed lts neither your nor my home But belongs to the homeless All right Sheikh Remember Patience doesnt mean to bow but to struggle lm sick of this Sheikh The Turkmens the Arabs they all go to him to ask for help And his closest men are Kurds Who is this Sheikh for Gods sake He descended from the Prophet All people respect him l dont care about his descendance lf he is trying to spoil all that l had done here then he is the chief of terrorists to me Please dont say so sir lf Abdurrahman Halis Kerkuki werent here who would look after the orphans and the widows Who would help the unemployed helpless people Then everyone would be terrorists lf he is that good then he shall be the president of lraq l have been telling you for years that this man is dangerous But you have always defended him Now tell me Who do you side with Me or him What do you benefit from him l dont benefit from anybody Get your men ready now The Sheikh will be arrested Yes sir l am not going to take part in this sir Excuse me l cant hear you Speak slowly My father my grandfather and his father even my grandfathers grandfather got our bread there He freed us from the tyranny of Saddam l cant point a gun at him He would paralyze us Paralyze you You mean this man is a wizard No no sir You know nothing about him

well behead them all one by one Lord please save me l dont want to be killed What are you doing here Whom are you imitating Whom Are you trying to act like the puppets who work for those oppressors Our Prophet never committed such acts Then who taught you about this This guy is a henchman of those murderers he is a journalist He is not innocent What Are you Allah to know who is innocent and who is not He may be cruel could be a liar as well lf your heads are to be chopped off he might even say that Muslims are butchering each other while taking your photographs with a great enthusiasm But
