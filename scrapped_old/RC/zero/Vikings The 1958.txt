The Vikings in Europe of the th and th Century were dedicated to a pagan god of war Odin Cramped by the confines of their barren icebound northlands they exploited their skill as shipbuilders to spread a reign of terror then unequaled in violence and brutality in all the records of history The greatest wish of every Viking was to die sword in hand and enter Valhalla where a heros welcome awaited them from the god Odin The compass was unknown and they could steer only by the sun and the stars Once fog closed in they were left helpless and blind After all the earth was flat Sail too far off course and the black wind would blowthem across the Poison Sea that lay to the west and over the edge of the world into limbo Their abiding aim was to conquer England then a series of petty kingdoms each one the jealous rival of the next Thus when the Vikings set forth to rob and plunder England they never sailed out of sight of land They confined their attacks to swift overnight raids It was no accident that the English Book of Prayer contained this sentence Protect us Oh Lord from the wrath of the Northmen Ragnar The king is dead Long live the king For two months we have mourned the good King Edwin who by the cruel Viking Ragnar was foully murdered and still lies unrevenged The council of the kingdom now declare that Aella is of the true royal line and welcome his succession to the throne Your Majesty Thank you my gracious lady You may rest assured that the barbarians that murdered your husband my cousin will soon feel the weight of my anger And though your union with Edwin was fruitless feel confident that you retain the respect of us all You may retire Queen Enid We Thurston Bishop and Matthew Bishop ask you will you take Aella as your king You need not fear my lady His words cannot hurt you He has no right to the throne There is no direct heir my lady There is an heir What Brother Godwin am with child but not Edwins The child is that of the Viking Ragnar bad omen The holy sword Requiter the sword of kings Long live the king Hes the son of a barbarian but love him as if he were Edwins child There are already rumors of his birth If they were to reach Aella Where are you sending him To Italy To be tended by monks who will not know his identity But his life will be safe and yours too Father Godwin The pommel stone of the sword Requiter It is his by right If you hope to identify him in years to come by means of this stone so can his enemies Twenty years passed Queen Enid had died but the rumor that she had given birth to a son continued to plague King Aella Although his castle became the stronghold of all England Aella was unable to stop the Viking raids Now let it be known throughout the kingdom of Northumbria that l King Rhodri of Wales bestow on King Aella the hand of my daughter Morgana will consent to this l too King Rhodri of Wales consent Praise be to God Amen Please rise child On the first day of Spring you will become my bride trust Lord Egbert that you approve of this alliance With all my heart sire Then why do you spread tales of an heir to the throne left by Queen Enid Tis common knowledge sire The queen on her deathbed spoke of a son sent off to Italy with the pommel stone of the sword Requiter tied about him Your Majesty is it wise to speak of things so long in the past hope soon to silence these wagging tongues This beautiful child will present me with an heir to the throne And this marriage will combine the strength of Wales and Northumbria and protect our people from the depredation of the Vikings That is not enough must also expose a traitor in our midst Surely there are no traitors in this hall sire Cousin Egbert why have your lands never been attacked by the Vikings What do you mean sire Neither your lands nor the lands of your fellow conspirators have ever suffered any real harm For years you have schemed against me ll not be made a scapegoat for your failure to stop the Viking raids You have conspired with the foes of England to unseat me from my throne What foes The Vikings Take him out Lies will not sustain a tyrant Use skill It must appear as if he took his own life Hes gone sire Hunt him down Bring me his head Hail Ragnar Youre late Weve been waiting half the night nearly didnt get here at all Aella knows of our meetings barely escaped with my life Take me with you He is no more use to us Send him back Thats no way to reward a man whos guided our raids No well find good use for him Come aboard Make sail for Long Sound Make sail for Long Sound Ragnar Come on Hail Ragnar Hail Ragnar Hail Ragnar Hail Einar drink to your safe return in English ale wish that it were English blood Hold your mouth This is an Englishman Englishman Lord Egbert An ally Then drink to my fathers return Englishman Do you want the English to think were barbarians This is Einar my only son in wedlock Hes so vain of his beauty he wont let a mans beard hide it He scrapes his face like an Englishman Hail Ragnar And hail Ragnars beard want you to teach Lord Egbert our customs ll teach him Remember live by brains not brawn Yes my lord Then fetch him a horse Now Why not Einar Gently gently know Brains not brawn Hes got to draw us maps of the English coast What man ever had a finer son Odin could have sired him But did Come Dont be frightened Shes forbidden to hunt Englishmen Too much for her to swallow We have the same sport in England With hawks like this Watch Kill You call that a hawk think we have hawks to equal that one Here Bring up Long Claw Look nowtheres a hunting bird You again Whose bird is that Its mine slave with a hunting hawk found her frozen to a tree Whered you steal it Sandpiper was with me when found her The perfect witness deaf and dumb Perhaps youd like your own tongue cut out Then youll tell no more lies m not a liar Is this the way slaves talk to Vikings Tell the English lord that youre a liar Kill Kill him No Dont kill him Odin Bring in the slave Look how he glares at me If he wasnt fathered by a black ram in the full of the moon my name is not Ragnar What would you do with him in your country We have a special reward which is rather entertaining in a noisy way Whats that Its nothing much just a pit full of wolves halfmad with starvation and trained to appreciate the flavor of human blood You see The English are civilized Can you think of anything worse can think of something far worse guess you can with your pretty dainty face spoiled But he was a good slave Kill him quick No No quick death for him What do you suggest do with him Nothing Nothing want this slave alive You want him to live after tearing your face apart Yes The sun will cross the sky a thousand times before he dies And youll wish a thousand times that you were dead Kitala You cant kill the slave What do the runes say If Odin willed that Eric should die Thors hammer would sound his death knell But the sky is silent The curse of Odin waits on him who kills the slave Then no man shall kill him Let the tide of the sea do it Bind him Cast him into the slop pool at lowtide Take him out Youll not kill him but you throw him into the slop pool to be drowned and eaten by crabs Then let the crabs be cursed by Odin Thats my decision If he survives the pool what then If hes still alive when the tide turns then any fool who fishes him out can have him Survives Odin send a wind and turn the tide Put her in the testing board think ll go and watch that slave drowning Stay here Youll see something more interesting It does look rather an interesting game Its not a game Its Odins test for unfaithful wives Is she an unfaithful wife Ask Einar Her husband says she is Which is he Hes throwing the axes But if shes innocent Her husband will succeed The braids will be cut Supposing he misses the braids and hits her Well then shes guilty Oh see But what happens if he misses both the girl and the braids Three misses and we drown him One Youre too drunk Youll split her wide open Drunk am havent had enough You missed her didnt you What a son Kitala Kitala my legs Move your legs Eric You must move them Where did this slave boy come from Bjorn brought him here from a raid He was taken from a ship on the sea And this was found about his neck Yes Its the only possession he ever had He has no need of it now Hes going to die Listen to me little slave Einar is in the hall celebrating your death Einar is laughing at you Live Eric Fight the cold Live and fight Einar Fight Einar Fight Einar Odin has answered you They were only flying clouds You are blind They were Odins daughters heard the singing of their battle swords as they rode across the sky They bring the wind They bring the wind Listen The North wind Its turning back the tide Cut him loose Tide is going out Your job is done ll take the slave Hes mine Einar The wind turned the tide and pulled him out ll take him Englishman If your fathers word means anything hes mine Why such a sudden interest in the slave my lord Shall we say an English passion for converting the wicked to the paths of righteousness Well youre not in England now And you never will be unless draw maps of England for your father All right You can keep the slave for as long as you live Odins thanks for saving him And at no little risk to myself Do you know what this is Some day ll tell you what it is and youll remember then that saved you m still a slave You wont be when we get to England ll never get to England Youre like a wounded animal You trust no one Good day my lords Hail Egbert Hows the boat coming along Shell be ready in a week Well shes no Sea Dragon but shell do for a toy Does Einar still bear me a grudge still think youre a fool to anger my son Hell kill you one day Youre not

all King Rhodris daughter Morgana Rhodri couldnt raise enough to ransom a skagerrak moose No but Aella could Hes to marry her in the spring think our Englishman has a good idea Shes leaving soon and must go round this point Here Youre sure d stake my life on it You already have Let me intercept her and bring her back here How many men would you need One boat Only one boat No more What about him without the collar Youll take him along Naturally ll take along my slave You stay here and draw maps ll kidnap the girl Ragnar try to get him to draw maps thatll guide a ship through fog and then maybe hell be worth having around There is no map of any use in fog Then what use are you to us Think of that while m gone And dont let anything happen to that slave Its a strange metal that fell to earth from the North star Sandpiper brought it from far away The price he paid was his ears and his tongue No matter how you hold it it always struggles to return homeward to the star from which it fell It always points to the north Not in the fog It cannot see the stars in the fog Watch Can it see the star through these walls This could lead you to many places Even to the land beyond the Poison Sea Valhalla You will go there one day Only great heroes have ever reached it See what the runes say Will this take me there woman will point the way What will she look like You will know her when you see her When will that be Soon enough Will she love me or hate me Love and hate are horns on the same goat What woman would ever look at a slave This one will Youre lying Kitala All your tales are

Morganas out there After them The Great Snake is sunk You want to wreck this ship too Ragnar Wheres Ragnar At the bottom of the fjord Curse of Odin on that slave If have to cross the Poison Sea ll find him swear it By the sacred blood of Odin Still afraid No m worth more alive than dead Are you No But value my life much more now Of course m grateful to you for saving me and Aella will certainly reward you Why should take you back to Aella But you must Why m pledged to him on my fathers word didnt steal you away just to give you to another man Aella isnt another man Hes a king And m a slave And loved you the moment saw you loved you even before then Kitala saw it in the runes Thats just Kitalas silly talk Do you love Aella belong to him by my fathers word as a Christian king Whats your fathers word compared to Odins will Do you know which of all the oceans is the widest The Poison Sea No The ocean between a Christian and a heathen Our hands can reach across it as easily as that But thats just a joining of the flesh What else is missing Joining of our souls If our hands are touching our souls must be touching But your soul is heathen If my soul is content to be heathen and yours content to be Christian lets not question flesh for wanting to remain flesh Youll be in England soon Suppose Aella releases you from your pledge Then d be free But why should he ll find a way How can make you understand What would be the worst thing for a Viking To die without a sword in his hand and never enter Valhalla For me to break my pledge to Aella would be as bad as that ll find a way You captured Ragnar singlehanded We all owe you our thanks dont want your thanks want Morgana This barbarian is under the illusion that you desire to be released from your pledge Do you release me Surely you dont want to be released Yes do That is absurd Sire you gave your word Of course But first things first Father Godwin take the Princess Morgana to the chapel that she may meditate before making a final decision Yes sire Gentlemen let us proceed to the kennels The royal pets are hungry Take him That stone my lady where did you get it Eric gave it to me Where did he get it He said it was tied around his neck when the Vikings captured him as a baby Since you brought him here the pleasure shall be yours Push him in claim the right of a Viking to die with a sword in my hand And deny you that right Go ahead Push him in Cut my bonds and give me the sword Why should Would you deny me the right to enter Valhalla What are you doing You dare give him that sword Odin And Einar is his brother Eric has surrendered his own father to Aella Father Godwin we must try to stop him Yes Come You have dared to defy a king You shall join Ragnar in the pit want all here to see the reward for such defiance Your Majesty would ask you to bear in mind that made good your promise in the name of Holy Mother Church Thank you Father Godwin You are the watchdog of my fury But if a common slave can rob me of a queen and slay an enemy too cunning for a whole nation to defeat then the day must come when he will be a deadlier foe to England than Ragnar ever was With or without Gods sanction tell you as your king this cannot be Yes my dear will keep my pledge to you Dont kill him In that case nothing could distress me more than for you to think me cruel Then let him go Hold out the hand that has defied me Let this serve as a lesson to all Vikings Take him to his ship and cast him adrift Why do we wait Because of a slave my fathers bones lie now at the bottom of the fjord Ragnar was your king but he had no Vikings burial have sworn by the blood of Odin to avenge my fathers death Why do we wait We must mourn Ragnar Its revenge Ragnar wants not mourning Every Viking wants to revenge the death of Ragnar Then lets go to England now for the girl and the slave We dont even know where they are Where else would the slave go but to Aellas castle to be rewarded for his treachery Perhaps but what chance would we have Aellas castle is the strongest in all of England know Aellas castle well Here are the maps Einar has studied every stone and beam To reach the castle we must hug the English coast They will have days to prepare for our attack We dont hug the coast We sail across the open sea And if theres fog Cant we do what a slave did The slave used witchcraft His eyes sawthrough the fog to the stars Are you afraid Bjorn Do not confuse fear with caution Odin has sent no sign Then you can stay here But we go to avenge Ragnars death Who sails with me Not even enough to man one ship Odin Odin must have answered me Wheres Morgana In Aellas castle You dare to come back here just to tell me this No need you and your men to take the castle and you need me to guide you across the open sea Why should you want me to free Morgana Because she shall be my wife All right slave you live until Morganas free Vikings Vikings Odin has sent us a sign Kill him Kill him Listen to me Make no mistake hate this slave more than any living man but he can guide us to Morgana What matters more to you foreign wench or vengeance for Ragnar Because of him your father lies at the bottom of the fjord Thats not true Ragnar died in England In the fog he swam to my boat took him there How did Ragnar die Aella ordered him bound and thrown alive into the wolf pit Ragnar bound like a sheep and thrown to wolves cut his bonds He died fighting with the sword gave him And this was my thanks from Aella for letting Ragnar die like a Viking Now you know how Ragnar died His eyes can lead us to Aella Now who sails with me will Strange isnt it was going to take you to England and now youre taking me Do you still have that stone you wear about your neck No Its gone Just as well Why used to think it would bring me luck Now neither of us will have any use for it Arthur the Vikings Its the Vikings The Vikings Egbert where would Morgana be The safest place the tower chapel Odin Be assured sire The second drawbridge is much stronger than the first Take your magic elsewhere holy man The chapel is a sanctuary Father Godwin Go ahead Jump You will be my queen knew it the first moment saw you You knew it too You knew it that night on my ship Its not true Yes it is true dont love you You must love me exactly as love you hate you Its Eric love Where are you taking me To see Eric for the last time Dont kill him You cant Look at this Its from the pommel of the sword Requiter It was given to Eric by his mother Enid the Queen Listen to me Ragnar was his father Lies wont save him Its true swear it is He is your brother Eric Look at him how he hastens to his death He cant wait to die If cant have your love ll take your hate Why did he hesitate Odin Prepare a funeral for a Viking
