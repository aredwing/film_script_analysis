perverted tendencies What if play dumb Then its the funny farm or boot camp Why did you return the typewriter Well since couldnt sell it or anything got scared dont know why returned it Just like that hear you stole francs from your grandmother She had invited me for her birthday thought she is old and doesnt eat much She doesnt need the money She was going to die soon So since knew where she kept her dough took some knew she wouldnt notice And she didnt She gave me a nice book that day But my mother she used to go through my pockets That night while was asleep she must have found the money in my pocket cause next day it was gone Later she mentioned it and had to confess where got it And then she took the nice book away One day asked for it back and found out shed sold it Your parents say youre always lying Oh lie now and then suppose Sometimes if told them the truth they wouldnt believe me anyway So prefer to lie Why dont you like your mother Well she put me in a foster home and then when they had no more money lived with my grandmother But then she got old and she couldnt take care of me anymore So when was went to live with my parents could tell Mom didnt like me She was always yelling at me for no reason There were fights at home and overheard that my mother had me before she was married And she had a fight with my grandmother once thats when found out that she had wanted to have an abortion Its thanks to my grandmother that was born Have you ever slept with a girl No But some friends of mine have They told me where the hookers hang out And so went and tried to pick up some girls but they yelled at me So got scared and left went back several times Once a man asked me what was doing there He was North African So told him guess he knew a lot of women He said he knew one a young one who liked guys my age So he took me to the hotel where she was only she wasnt there that day We waited an hour or two She didnt show up So left Dont look for your father came alone Over there Your personal letter hurt your father deeply and of course he showed it to me Whatever you may think we get along well went through a difficult time but you didnt need to remind him of it He gave you his name after all We were willing to try again and take you back but the neighbors would talk You probably complained to the entire neighborhood didnt say anything Mom m used to this
