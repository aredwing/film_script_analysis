sooner we pay So far your information is useless Cheap peddler stuff Nothing Shall we try a little harder Its not a question of trying told you what know Make your own deductions Very well Lets make some deductions together What would you as an experienced intelligence officer deduce from the few facts you gave us about Rolling Stone Then let me offer my conclusion first Control himself was running an agent He paid him christened the operation personally supervised the case Do you consider that fanciful Its possible Anythings possible Can you deduce the nationality of Controls agent How could How could anybody Who chose the name Ziebold Who chose it Control German alias and Control chose it wonder why So what He could still have been a bloody Tibetan Oh come on Leamas You dont give a Tibetan a German alias if you want him to be able to visit a bank inconspicuously and draw out large sums of money You give a German alias to a German And what kind of German If Control ran him an East German And if Control ran him somebody very very big Do you see what m after Yes Your last agent was Riemeck Karl Riemeck never had a chance to interrogate him Mundt shot him How did you first approach Riemeck We didnt He approached us Offering what Offering a roll of microfilm which when we developed it turned out to contain photographs of the minutes of a weekly meeting held by the Praesidium of the East German Communist Party After that the information got better and better Never handled stuff like it Did it ever occur to you to ask him how he got his information Why the hell should He worked in the Praesidium Did Control ever ask you how you got it No Did Control meet Riemeck Yes once was against it for simple security reasons but uh yes he did Control came to Berlin last spring He asked to meet Riemeck to uh to thank him Were you present at the thanksgiving Of course was introduced them But were you present all the time No introduced them and then left Control insisted on that He wanted to be alone with Riemeck Yes Suppose it gave him a kick How long were they alone Five minutes minutes What are you trying to prove m not at the proving stage Youre going down a blind alley Fiedler You forget ran the Berlin station ran all the agents in East Germany If Rolling Stone had been an East German agent d have known about it He couldnt function any other way Youre wasting your time ran all the agents in East Germany Karl Riemeck was the last Would you like some fresh air What are you going to do with the money Oh dont know Settle down in some sunny spot on the Caspian with one of your flaxenhaired discus throwers cant go home Dont you mind giving up your country What the hells my country done for me worked for the service for years and they kicked me out as if it had been minutes Why did you work for them Well the money Only money It was a job You would have done it anywhere for anyone m a technician Fiedler Just a technician But not a Communist technician Oh for Gods sake Christian then dont believe in Father Christmas dont believe in God or Karl Marx dont believe in anything that rocks the world But how do you sleep You have to have a philosophy reserve the right to be ignorant Thats the Western way of life couldnt have put it better myself You think ignorance a valuable contribution to world knowledge You fight for ignorance Go to hell Look all want to know is why Whats the motor As a matter of fact invented the combustion engine and the twoway nappy m a hero of the Soviet Union wear the Order of Lenin on my rump m a man you fool Dont you understand plain simple muddled fatheaded human being We have them in the West you know Thats what its all about Is that why you became a spy Look your job and mine permit us to take human life If want to kill you and can only do it by putting a bomb in a restaurant then thats the way ll kill you thats what ll do Innocent people die every day They might as well do so for a reason Afterwards may draw up a purely academic balance men killed women nine children and an advance of three yards What about you If ever have to break your neck promise to do it with a minimum of force Now when do get my bloody money Look could lie to you could say you get your money in a month just to keep you sweet But m telling you dont know and thats the truth You have given us indications Until we have run them to earth cant think of letting you go But afterwards if things are as think they are youll need a friend Youre bustling about bloody early Is Mundt back want you to sign something The couriers waiting Letters to the banks in Copenhagen and Helsinki asking for a statement of any recent withdrawals by your two partners The letters will be mailed from Switzerland Where will the bank send the statements To one of our accommodation addresses in West Berlin Control will find out that ve written Hell have forgotten by the time you next meet Will you sign with your aliases please Let me have the pad Here you are The Copenhagen letter The Helsinki ones easier wrote it in my own handwriting Now what Within a week we should at least know the dates when Rolling Stone was last in Copenhagen and Helsinki to draw the money Is Mundt back Not yet Until we hear from the banks theres nothing more we can do We shall be constantly in one anothers company If thats distasteful to you apologize thought we could go for walks again or drive around in the hills for a bit while we talked Incidentally we have some facilities here for people who for people who are spending some time with

east behind the curtain should very much like to go Miss Crail ll speak to Brigadier Blantyre but think d better just tell him Germany not East He doesnt hold with the Russians Thank you Blonde or brunette Do you know Mundt Well we have talked about him He shoots first and asks questions afterward The deterrent principle Its an odd system in a profession where the questions are always supposed to be more important than the shooting Its an odd system unless you are frightened of the answers That telephone call Yes What about it The money in Copenhagen The bank answered your letter The managers very worried that there has been a mistake The money was drawn by your partner exactly one week after you paid it in The date it was drawn coincides with the twodays visit Mundt paid to Copenhagen in April The same goes for the bank in Helsinki Mundt took the money from there too Youre out of your bloody mind ve told you again and again they couldnt have done it London couldnt have run him as their man without my knowing about it Youre trying to tell me that Control was personally directing and operating the head of counter espionage in the Abteilung without the knowledge of the Berlin station Well m telling you youre mad Shut up and drive us home You have driven us home Leamas Mundt is a traitor tell you they eased his escape from England London let him go because they wanted him to go They found him bribed him turned him tell you they couldnt have done it Control couldnt have run him without my knowledge Youre mad Dont tell me youre that sorry to kill Mundt suppose you ought to write to the banks and tell them everything is quite in order Comrade Fiedler Yes We want to talk to you What do you want We are from Berlin Go to your room Come in Close the door Undo him Get up Take him upstairs Whisky London sent you didnt they Wheres Fiedler Under arrest as you are for conspiring to sabotage the security of the people Youll be a witness at his trial We shall want your confession That means you dont have any proof We shall have proof We shall have your confession Who sent you Control Smiley No one sent me Theyre looking for me dont you know When did you last see Smiley ve never met Smiley Where did you go after lunch with Ashe Chelsea havent the vaguest recollection had two scotches and half a bottle of punishing Greek wine All remember is wandering about In a taxi Was in a taxi Our man reported you took a taxi outside the restaurant Where did you go in the taxi told you was too drunk to know that was in a bloody taxi mean if your man followed me why dont you ask him whwhwh Did you go to Smileys house in Chelsea dont know dont know Smiley Why did you shake off your followers Why were you so keen on shaking them off Hans Dieter Mundt have a warrant for your arrest by order of the Praesidium of the German Democratic Republic You all know why were here This is not a trial but a tribunal convened expressly by the Praesidium and it is to the Praesidium alone that we are responsible The proceedings therefore will be secret We shall hear evidence as we think fit Comrade Fiedler you may begin You can see from the report ve already given you that we ourselves sought Leamas out in England induced him to defect and finally brought him to our republic Nothing could more clearly demonstrate the impartiality of Leamas than this that he still refuses for reasons will explain to believe that Mundt is a British agent It is therefore grotesque to suggest that Leamas is a plant The initiative was ours and the fragmentary but vital evidence of Leamas provides only the final proof in a long chain of indications reaching back over many years You will see on page seven that in Mundt was posted to London ostensibly as a member of the East German Steel Mission Actually he was engaged in intelligence duties In the course of this he killed a man By doing so he exposed himself to countermeasures by the British Secret Police Since he had no diplomatic immunity for Britain does not recognize our sovereignty Mundt went into hiding Ports were watched His photograph and description were distributed throughout the British Isles Yet after two days in hiding Mundt takes a taxi to London Airport and flies to Berlin Brilliant you will say and so it was With the whole of Britains police force alerted her roads railways ship and air routes under constant surveillance Mundt in British eyes a dangerous political murderer takes a plane from London Airport and flies to Berlin Brilliant indeed Or perhaps you may feel comrades with the advantage of hindsight that Mundts escape from Britain was a little too brilliant a little too easy that without the connivance of the British authorities it never could have been possible at all The truth is this Mundt was taken prisoner by the British and released on condition that he become their paid agent It is beyond all doubt that he was paid through the medium of the banking operation called Rolling Stone whose procedure you will see fully described in Annex to the report Leamas played an unwitting part in this operation Bring the witness forward please What is your name Alec Leamas assistant librarian You were formerly employed by the British Secret Service were you not Yes Is it your opinion that they could have recruited Mundt as their agent No it is not How can you be so sure ve told you a dozen times m not a performing seal was head of the Berlin section for nine years If Mundt had been our agent d have known about it d have run him dont you see Not to know would be an administrative impossibility Quite In you had in your capacity as Berlin station head approached and recruited the late Karl Riemeck formerly secretary to this Praesidium He approached me With microphotographs of secret Praesidium documents Yes Was his later work for you equally spectacular More so He gave us a complete breakdown of the Abteilung Control was delighted Control was so delighted that he actually came over to Berlin to meet Riemeck Did you approve of that No Riemeck was my man Control should have left him to me That was the rule Control broke it You introduced him but were not present at the meeting That is correct And they were entirely alone How should know wasnt there What do you think Control said to Riemeck Uh well he wanted to thank him so he told me and give him a medal Mutual admiration Can you tell the tribunal how Riemeck obtained his information never bothered to ask Then you may sit down and will tell them Who in The year after Mundt escaped from England remember Who coopted Riemeck onto the Committee for the Protection of the People that vital committee which coordinates all of our security measures Who proposed that Riemeck should be appointed secretary to the Praesidium with access to all its secrets Who at every stage in Riemecks career since has singled him out for posts of exceptional responsibility The same man who was uniquely placed to shield Riemeck in his espionage activities Hans Dieter Mundt Mundt by deliberately raising Riemeck to higher and higher posts made it possible for him to amass all that information which he passed on to Leamas Mundt Riemeck Leamas Control That was the chain of communication But Leamas never knew for it is a rule in intelligence technique the whole world over that each link of the chain be kept as far as possible in ignorance of the others Leamas never knew that Mundt was Londons man Then why did Mundt kill Riemeck if Riemeck and he were both working for the British He had no alternative Riemeck was already under our suspicion If had been given the chance to interrogate him could have incriminated Mundt But was not allowed to interrogate him Mundt shot him He killed the bird before it could sing Had it not been for the defection of Leamas Mundt might be practicing his treachery still There is your saboteur There is your terrorist Theres the man who has sold the peoples right When you come looking for your recommendation to the Praesidium do not shrink from recognizing the full bestiality of this traitors crime For Hans Dieter Mundt death is a judgment of mercy Comrade Karden you are speaking for Comrade Mundt You have heard the accusations of Comrade Fiedler Do you wish to examine the witness Leamas Yes should like to in one moment One moment The contention of Comrade Mundt is that Leamas is lying and that Comrade Fiedler either by design or ill chance has been drawn into a plot to disrupt the Abteilung and thus bring into disrepute the organs for the defense of our peoples democracy We do not dispute that Karl Riemeck was a British spy There is evidence for that But we do dispute that Mundt was in league with him and we dispute that Mundt accepted money for betraying our democracy For these charges we say that there is no objective evidence and that Comrade Fiedler is intoxicated by dreams of power and blinded to rational thought We maintain that Leamas was dismissed from the British Secret Service so that he should exhibit those symptoms of uh physical and moral decline which would deceive our London agents into thinking he was a potential defector But we also maintain that once our London agents had contacted him he was used by Control as a weapon indeed as a spearhead in Controls plot to incriminate Comrade Mundt But Comrade Fiedler on whose ambitions the British so accurately counted accepted the evidence as true and thus became party to a monstrous plot to destroy to murder in fact for Mundt now stands to lose his life one of the most vigilant defenders of our democratic republic said vigilant comrades For do you really suppose that all this time Comrade Mundt has been in ignorance of Fiedlers feverish plotting It was Mundt who took one crucial precaution while the British with Fiedlers aid planned his murder He caused scrupulous inquiries to be made about the witness Leamas He was looking you see for one minute human error in a scheme of almost superhuman subtlety Now Mr Leamas Let us see whether we can assist Comrade Mundt in his search Do you still refuse to tell us where the taxi took you

Mundt lives It was a foul foul operation but it paid off Who for What the hell do you think spies are Moral philosophers measuring everything they do against the word of God or Karl Marx Theyre not Theyre just a bunch of seedy squalid bastards like me Little men drunkards queers henpecked husbands civil servants playing cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten little lives Do you think they sit like monks in a cell balancing right against wrong Yesterday would have killed Mundt because thought him evil and an enemy But not today Today hes evil and my friend London needs him They need him
