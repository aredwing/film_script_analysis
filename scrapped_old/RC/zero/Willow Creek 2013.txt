Visitor Center for the last years How are you Nita m doing well Thank you Well good have a question for you Do you know of anyone or do you know personally the exact site of the PattersonGimlin Uh no do not And um has there been any recent sightings of Bigfoot or Sasquatch in the area No not to my knowledge Are you a believer Not at all No huh Is it safe to camp here Uh you have to be on the lookout uh for bear mountain lions rattle snakes um but its its safe mean you take your chances Have you ever heard of anyone being attacked by a mountain lion or a bear out here Uh yes havent heard the uh bear attacks Uh basically they get into the garbage uh and come in to steal your food The mountain lions uh will attack What would you do if you saw Big Foot Nita dont expect to see one Um really wouldnt be surprised um because just dont believe in it Were rolling got really lucky Um were here at Bigfoot Books with the owner Steve Streufert Whats up Steve The usual thing Bigfoot every day out here in Willow Creek Yeah nice heard you had a little uh you were just out there Yeah we were out of Bluff Creek Yeah Bluff Creek Uh it is about miles north of here you come to the bottom of Bluff Creek there Hmmhmm And that was where the Patterson film was shot Yes of course Also these uh footprints that you uh may have seen before Yeah These were cast out in Bluff Creek in Sure Wow So these are the Jerry Crew cast That is from the same track way of Yeah the famous Jerry Crew track was taken from Thats incredible And thats where obviously you know they coined the name Bigfoot Yeah The contractors on the road building project out there and the loggers um had very strange activity going on out there Yeah They were cutting a new road into this virgin timber so um they started finding these footprints out on the dusty plowed road and they called it Bigfoot Apparently there were some that saw it out there so uh you know the big feet were connected with a creature that was didnt realize that that was also throwing a big gallon fuel drums and uh spools of metal logging wire down into the creek uh vandalizing their camp in general So thats where that name came from in Right This is the model that was used by Roger Patterson He rented this and came out here and you know its very heavy Yeah He he this is what he used to film while running across a a regular gravel bar and rocks in the Yeah in the creek They were also used for uh making home movies and uh amateur films like pornos Oh thats awesome Wow thats so heavy Tell me a little bit about um the PattersonGimlin site and just how to get there man Oh well um you can take this road can show on the map and you go down that road Its probably easier that way That would be great You come down to the bottom and theres an old camp site there you know and uh when youre at that camp site you basically just take a right You have to bushwhack and go through the forest My girlfriend is with that But its not you wont get lost Just follow the sound of the creek on your left and look at the hill on your right You just keep going straight between those until you come to a big gulch and youll see it all blasted out with rocks and log debris and uh thats the bottom of the film site area Wow So you go youre going to have to go down in the creek Be careful not to twist your ankle you know Just getting to the site is it kind of dangerous or would you Uh well there is the thing we called The Curse of Bluff Creek Whats that Uh wait thats sort of related to The Curse of Bigfoot but The Curse of Bigfoot usually means that you know like youre going to get divorced your friends will all think youre crazy uh youll be uh impecunious and youll spend all of your days searching for something that you never find Um thats kind of a classic thing with the old researchers you know Hmmhmm But um thats sort of a joke The the um the real truth of it is that youre out in the middle of nowhere you know so you you dont really want to uh just go out there unprepared you know Right Theres no food and theres no water unless you want to drink the wild water and hunt the wild animals you know There are some berries and things which you have to know the wild plants so d say you know go prepared and have the tools you need to survive right Yeah lot of people arent ready for that They think there should be a a campground there with a like porter potty or something You know youre not in the Its still the wilderness mean its Yeah Its not technically a wilderness but its still pretty wild you know and weve seen many many bears uh out there um so watch out for that We are going to go see Tom Yamarone Hes the Bob Dylan of the Bigfoot Community Where does he live Mordor No jokes around him all right So can look him in the eye No jokes All right great Were rolling This is like Christmas in July uh because m here with Tom Yamarone and uh Tom know you know Bob Gimlin do So uh why dont you tell us a little bit about um the PattersonGimlin site Yeah Well ll tell you its a site thats so remote and what youre going to love about it is when you get in there its a steep canyon theres a running creek theres forest thats thick and youre going to feel how isolated they were They were really truly in the wilderness How do you think those guys were feeling that day when mean theyve been theyve been searching for a little while and to finally to finally come across what was you know there by the riverbed Yeah Well you know ll tell you they were bored not bored but they had they had no success up to that point and boom they come around that log jam and theres this big haircovered creature standing there starts walking away from them and they knew right then they had won the prize you know if they could get it on film and so Patterson scrambles Gimlin watches him and they they think they got it So they were couldnt have been more excited You know the only thing that would be better if there was a song about it just so happened to have written one Ladies and gentlemen Tom Yamarone with uh Roger and Bob Rode Out That Day yeah Roger and Bob rode out that day fill that log jam got in their way They got lucky on Bluff Creek that day Yeah they got lucky when she walked away Roger and Bob rode out that day Roger and Bob were gone a week Just riding them forests around Bluff Creek They made maps Sorry Blew it Thats all right man Thats Thats all right They shot some film They shot some film of a Bigfoot there She walked on two legs and was covered in hair Roger and Bob had quite a week Yeah Al got a call on the telephone Roger and Bob they stopped by his home They told him about their good luck And Roger said filmed that son of a buck Al got a call on the telephone Here we go Hi m here with uh Shaun White Guy Sr Shes uh a resident of the Hopa reservation And Shaun understand you have a Sasquatch story that youd be willing to share with us Um yeah just have a small story Its uh me and my dad uh went on a camping or you know a a Christian cut Its Hoopa Hoopa Yes Hoopa Okay good Thank you Hi m here with Shaun White Guy Sr and uh she is a resident of the uh Hoopa Reservation and understand youd be willing to share a Sasquatch story with us Um yeah Um when was little about eight years old uh wanted to go on a camping a Christian like camping trip with my dad Hmmhmm And so asked to go and he said could go and um we were heading towards like Ferndale Garberville area wasnt too sure but know was going And so um were following my Uncle Tiny and then all of a sudden um a big black image came inbetween the cars and my dad turned the steering wheel and we flipped into the like the gutter and we looked up and there was Sasquatch walking in front of us up towards the the like field a big huge it was a big square open field and there was the tree range and we actually got to watch him uh walk in front of us and he was tall and he was like longhaired Were you scared Uh yeah was was scared couldnt believe that it you know always heard rumors and everybodys talking about that theyve seen it you know and and when actually looked up and saw him he was just big and he was hairy and he made like this weird like snorkeling kind of sound d never heard it before And then when he turned around and looked all could see is his little brown eyes with like right here is like skin around his eyes There was no hair right there just skin and he just looked back and made this little noise and then just looked away and just closed my eyes and was like Oh dont come back dont just dont believe in Bigfoot Do you know how many new species are discovered every single year Twenty thousand species every single year Right And what do you think thats including Do you think thats including animals and creatures Thats plants plankton uh microscopic organisms Oh yeah Not what were talking about And and m talking about mammals too Monkeys All right Do you know last year they discovered a snubnosed monkey Thats a brand new species they never even knew existed but they found it Yeah but And they never even found a body dead or alive but they found it Not finding a tiny monkey in a giant rainforest the size of a continent is not the same as not finding a pound hairy biped roaming around a very highly populated Pacific Northwest area Thats not the same babe So youre a
