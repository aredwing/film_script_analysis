the boys like you Excellent You see heres our problem We have such a wonderful school and all the best families in Germany are proud to have their children come here but the common people especially the peasants here you see they are so crude and uneducated that they dont want their children to attend our school They even hide them from us Bravo Abel Now we want to give everyone the benefit of the Reich And thats why want you to help us Abel You yourself are an ordinary fellow So its simply ideal All right my boy m relying on you Cover the entire countryside And dont worry about insisting

Yes yes smelt them too How old is your little boy Oh no no no no Dont go in Dont be scared At first inspired fear in people Guten tag But soon they were to recognize my secret affinity with children They looked up to me they respected me Mommy who is the man And they entrusted me with their boys And was happy with my new mission Splendid Absolutely splendid Perfectly Dont change a thing Typical of the pure Nordic The nose Is leptorrhinian Neck Leptorrhinian By this point ought to be able to guess his blood type Rhesus positive bet you Mmm pure odor Smell him Do you know that can spot a black or a Semite with my eyes closed just because of the essence they secrete Theres an unmistakable impurity about their smell you cant fail to notice Slow reactions Not very bright But solid Dont worry Brightness is not a characteristic of the German race We dont want brightness People say Oh soandso is so bright He has such a clear mind No We mistrust this brightness this clarity Let the new African races cultivate brightness Our sources are in darkness That is what drives us to unparalleled creativity Wagner Nietzsche Bruckner boys brought back from the lake in a single catch but now as my list grows longer and longer have to pick them up one by one in the villages and forests Young boys are so bold and courageous No living creatures are as noble or as beautiful and yet so heartbreakingly awkward love nothing like love the young boys What a privilege to gather them all in a castle they can call their own Mostly they trust me But sometimes they dont And then can feel the part of me that is made of stone Hard and pitiless force them to come with me Anything goes You bring anything you run into Nothing but eastern characteristics Short pale testicles poorly hung What do you want me to do with him Get out Now Uhoh Where are you off to Home Home Whats going on Nothing Go Are you insane We cant disqualify anyone now Look at him marvelous physique Blond as can be So what Genetically hes worthless We are here to train these boys We create men here This is a crucible of men Thats all it is For you too my boy The world is wide open Come on One day he wont let us stand One day hell betray us Because his deceitfulness is endemic Its inscribed in his genes race is something homogeneous Its coherent and pure There cant be a nation mixing the races leads to disasters Look at the Americans stupid country which no amount of education can save We can make a champion out of a lad like him With his miserable upbringing he never had a chance yet You see the Bolsheviks too think that education is the key and you are just like them So then if you fail to treat every rat like a prize racehorse thats a social injustice And they think you can take any pig from the pen and educate him until he becomes a greyhound Its utterly absurd Enough Rubbish All right Colonel thats enough m in charge here and were keeping the boy Thank you Thats Nice work Abel Keep it up Come

boy is so heavy Whenever begin to let myself sink In the frozen mud remember a story Once upon a time that Our priest had told us in school Once upon a time there was a a sailor who was in this storm at sea He was afraid to die a sinner and he took upon his shoulders a young boy and hoped that by saving the young boy he would save himself That the the childs innocence would serve as a recommendation to Gods favor So he told us remember always You are under the sign of St Christopher You are a childbearer Hinei ma tov Remember as long as you carry a child you will be able to avoid harm by taking shelter under the mantle of innocence And you will go through rivers and you will go through tempests and you will go through even the flames of sin and then
