mean duchess If had a gun or a sword would be even more so Moko Serve the ladies Would you like some wine Here Your men seem to be more of a nuisance than servants admit that But when attacking a ship theyre great Evidently Your wine glasses and dinning utensils are exquisite From whom did you steal them The Spanish m just taking back what they took from me Please for a moment forget our backgrounds You are very beautiful dont recall the last time dined in such lovely company What happened Is a storm brewing No That is no storm How lucky didnt reveal your true identity Why consider it fortunate Your name among pirates is the most despised Who knows what might have been had he learned youre Wan Ghoulds daughter dont think the name Wan Ghould would affect his behavior towards me No brother Antonio Not quite it Oh it is you archduke In my opinion the color of her eyes is a bit faded Dont you think In reality my daughters skin is more pale little romance might add rosiness to her cheeks And her nose her nose to say a bit impertinent Understand what mean understand above all that you love her More than anything in the world And still received no news about the ship taking her to Maracaibo We must trust in God He should trust in me Its in His interest to be my ally Whose sparrows are these Oloneses If you like them ll sell them to you How much Youre lucky Theyll cost little on the condition that you can eat them all in one night as once did Who is she Black Corsairs Dont you know him Which black corsair The count That defender of the weak He doesnt fit among us he prefers to play the righteousness He doesnt even want many dealings with us Dont touch this lady or else Who is this man challenging me Spanish count from Herbe One of oldest Castile families His ransom was just paid he is free If hes paid for figure could kill him now My dear chap you are so stupid d love to whip some sense into you with my foil Unfortunately m disposed of my equipment But no matter just lend me a sword and ll give you a free lesson Unless youre afraid of an armed man Give him a sword From now on this man is under my protection Olonese Try your tricks on me Catch Forgive me for interfering so loudly in such tranquil Tortuga but doesnt seem appropriate for two pirates to fight amongst themselves on a night before a major undertaking What are you talking about Important Did you not speak with the Emir With Emir Who can understand him Try yourself if you dont believe me More languages one speaks further one gets So what did he say That perhaps you are strong as a lion but your head is empty You conquered his sailing ship with crew but his cargo ship sailing behind him headed for Maracaibo with treasures you let slip away What did she fare He said approximately kilos of pure gold and kilos of silver He was overthrown and so he was fleeing to America with the national treasure And who are you My name is Morgan Never heard of you Give me time What land are you from England Have you heard of it And what they call you Milton Morgan No one will remember that Maybe yes Thank you Your hand is no doubt the hand of aristocrat Blue blood knows its own can confidently lean on it You are mistaken my lord My hand is ordinary like Oloneses It became corsairs hand for the time being fear it is the only kind have to offer for support Lean on me Free this woman she belongs to me paid for her Jean dAvignot as governor of Tortuga acting on behalf of the French king need to learn more about your plan to attack Maracaibo Before giving my assent wish to hear views of those present Decaiuno speak and kilos of silver would go after the devil into the fires of hell to retrieve it The gold or die trying such is my view have two ships and hands all can be ready in days Montbars and you Wont be easy who knows how many will lose their lives Perhaps even you Olonese But its an opportunity dont wish to waste If you die thatll prove m the bravest among all corsairs But will go with all my men Van Horn go Under the condition Olenese will allow us to work out the plan together Martin Hoffere Why do you ask me Though m an expriest it wont bother me to send some Spaniards back to their Maker If He loves them as much as love woman He will thank me forever Count from Ventimiglie We are not going Me nor my men You Are you pirate or Spaniard You are more on their side than ours You dont even know what you are anymore We must conquer Maracaibo Theres lots of gold and want it am in charge you must obey me You must go as well wont go to Maracaibo with your flotilla Olonese Because will be there first think you are mad Our goals differ Yours is gold Mine is Wan Ghould If you attack Maracaibo and Wan Ghould is not able to repel you he will flee must be there first If remain alive when you arrive will join you then You made it to Maracaibo alone once Tempting fate trying for a second time only need to ensure the archduke wont escape alive Even if you make it to Maracaibo how do you expect to find him will find him made a bargain with a potent ally Good luck Emilio Aim straight And hold firm Excellent Moko bring me the man waiting outside Which one the one playing the flute No the other one You Come here What manners Why do you follow me So that you would call for me But why am just beginning my pirates career and need to be hired as a captain d rather have my own command but that seems unlikely at this time What did you say your name was Morgan See even you cannot remember it need to do something noteworthy for people to remember my name Back to matter at hand what do you want from me Take me to Maracaibo As secondincommand Why should Because we have overlapping interests on which rely as you upon your honor Nice speech But not enough of an incentive Perhaps will think of more Wan Ghould managed to find his servant among the prisoners He mentioned certain monastery the archduke frequents alone Offer the chap freedom and he will take you there And where is this man Waiting outside You heard me Satan at last Have you ever seen a ship like Lightning captain uhm Morgan My name is Morgan Yes captain They will never remember the name Dont give up hope What is your name Yara am Jos Why do you hate me Yara Who said hate you see it in your eyes hate all Spaniards Did the Spanish do something horrible Yes But not all Spaniards are bad Just as not all are good You shouldnt hate all just those who hurt you Why should Yara say These hate those dont They came from the sea from Spain to kill us Stole our land made us slaves They didnt ask themselves which of us are good and which are bad If could would wipe them all off the face of the Earth But you are already making distinctions Because you are speaking with me shows you hate me little bit less Sometimes we just need to talk and no longer are we Indian or Spaniard just two ordinary human beings m no longer anything anymore Nothing How did you get here asked Carmauxi and Wan Stiller to hide me Carmauxi Wan Stiller Come here immediately We must say our farewell now Carmauxi Seems so Wan Stiller Dont punish them This is my fault begged them so much Commander Gentlemen Thank you Now go Could you believe we werent particularly eager to answer your call was thinking day and night how to say no to your farewell how to persuade you how to resist you The only solution came up with was to disobey you would never demand your obedience only ask for your love Sailors raise the big sail and lets celebrate for another attack When lived in Italy with my brothers and family believed honor was based simply on what one learned adhering to rules laid down by the nobilitys social duties maintaining the family honor as old as the world Then discovered thats not the only way to live In Tortuga found new life New rules new sense of honor Not always better not always worse just different And then you came discovered a new life totally different life Then for a moment my determination for revenge seemed to wane If could only erase entire past from my memory But cannot made a vow must keep understand My family my father all taught me honor is all in life without it we are nothing Had suffered what you have too would vow revenge understand perfectly That is why feel closer and love you all the more This is why As God is my witness desire to partake in your destiny forever Regardless to remain with you What is the matter You look upon me with ever greater sadness Why Because see what will happen And it will be very distressing Not through my fault hope This is my first officer Captain Morgan m very pleased Attention All together now Hurrah Holy Mother of Guadalupe never would have thought to see Wan Ghoulds daughter on this ship How do you know she is Wan Ghoulds daughter saw her picture once while in dukes service At least she resembles it But could be mistaken Are you daughter of Wan Ghould If you are dont lie Yes But that is no crime It is here Men listen The night we buried my brothers at sea vowed to wipe out Wan Ghoulds family even invoked Satan for help And he answered me In his usual diabolical style He delivered into my hands the daughter of Wan Ghould The only woman could ever love And now my heart trembles in horror want to annul the terrible vow Commander You fought years against Wan Gould with us faithfully by your side Dozens of us have been killed Each of us lost a friend or even own brother or son You taught us to hate Wan Ghould with same intensity as yours You dont decide alone We all want to take revenge on that accursed scoundrel Death to Wan Ghoulds clan including her daughter Death Its decided Death An eye for an eye Execute her Death Its decided Revenge Yes its decided Honorata Van Ghould For crimes of your father you are sentenced to death The execution is to be carried out immediately If you have something to say speak now else forever be silent If devil is punishing you for your vow God is punishing me for mine Excuse me commander m here only for a short time but the only one not directly involved in your vendetta realize you must keep your vow but please let me speak Hear me brothers dont wish to challenge your judgment but exercising my authority as the ships first officer invoke the laws of the sea recognized by all sailors and flotillas wish to suggest leave the execution of your judgment to fate Al right agree Agreed According to laws of the sea And so it will be So let it be But how will you live Lower the life raft Behold even the black pirate weeps If the accursed pirates come we are ready to receive them Guards were doubled Your plan was truly ingenious archduke Wan Ghould We let the pirate ships approach but offer little resistance And when in reach of our cannons then we let them have it Are you even listening to me No am thinking of the news a friend is to bring me anytime now If you wish you can receive him here in the palace No in the monastery instead Jos where are you Where are we supposed to go Dominican monastery The archduke goes there to pray every day by himself He has established an alliance with the priests But think we should split up Why Our number might arouse suspicion Would be best if the two of us would go alone In short you take care of Wan Ghould and ll take care of emirs gold and the silver Leave a little for Olonese Yara Goodbye Yara Wait We will return shortly Why are you bidding me farewell when m going with you What The black pirate and made the same vow too must avenge my brothers Your eyes dont seem clear today Because worry about you Yara Dont come with us d rather die than break my vow Lets go Were wasting time Dont stop Jos Which way Perhaps here Why dont you say what you see in my eyes What is the meaning of this That betrayed you all was to lure you into a trap Wan Ghould is waiting with his soldiers For this you pay with your life am ready Kill me Could you take me to the duke without him suspecting Of course But be warned will never betray you again Just try and you die wont learned to admire you fell in love with the people of Tortuga All your people especially Basically all your people Can trust him now his eyes are clear again Perhaps luck abandoning Wan Ghould is a good sign Praise the Lord Repeat Praise the Lord We lost their trail Wait What is this comedy of yours Wait youll see Forgive me stranger Uh dear foreigner just Wanted That is mean what the hell are you doing Maracaibo is threatened by dangerous epidemic If you please How did it get here Emirs treasure brought it Its infected And this is the only cure Its from the Orient Being the only doctor here it is in peoples interest that be saved first Please tell me what to do Similar incident happened years ago in Damascus and this powder cause when they were hiding it someone must have touched it understand Dont scream if you hold life dear Move over there have no intention to harm you Dont force me Force you On the contrary Please dont hurt me Put the candlestick down drop of hot wax on your hand and you might not resist a scream And you please put aside your sword What if were to sneeze Alright but promise you wont scream Agreed Even if you might not believe my word assure you have no intention of dying truly wont scream Thats better Do you intend to stay long Until he comes surmise you are very secretive and enchanting But know very well who you are You are whom they call the Black Corsair And you wish to confront Wan Ghould On his account sold my soul tore out my heart at a time it beat the strongest for my beloved May the Lord have mercy on me saw the archduke kill your brothers It was a cowardly murder He killed them treacherously know a lot of people very important people but nobody like Wan Ghould He is obsessed as if consumed by unquenchable fire came to extinguish it once and for all What is happening am returning from my watch saw sails on the horizon They are pirates At last Give marquise a message not to wait for me tonight Then come to the fortress well be there Yes sir Very well First night spent looking a man in his eyes Might be a nice story to tell my grandchildren if ever have some But they would never believe me The archduke No The archduke would knock more discretely have a message for the marquise from archduke Captain What Manolo Moments ago thought heard voices and footsteps in the marquises room We must investigate My lady Yes Manolo Captain Mannere has a message from archduke m not feeling well have a headache Go away all of you and leave me alone Your servants seem very obedient Much too much would say Shame to have to kill some What Have any idea how much each one costs these days Could you please escape in a less expensive manner would need your help You have it To start embrace me Gladly must admit wanted to all along Dont shoot hell kill me Allow him to pass Prepare a coach Quickly the coach Put down the guns for goodness sake One shot will kill me Its the black corsair Dont shoot Let him escape for her sake It didnt move all night long It is a ploy Feigning an attack from the sea The real battlefield will be the fortress That is where we wait for them We give the order then attack from behind Lets go wish to inspect the fortress walls If someday will have grandchildren will tell them of tonight and you Better go The sun is rising That is the hour when fairytales end Archduke and his officers keep inspecting the fortress Shall we go Yes After so many years so many deaths we finally meet face to face Perhaps your sword is faster than mine but surely is not faster than Shutz He is with me and is going to show you now Perhaps you are a honorable man but your archduke sent you to certain death this time They attacked Mannere back into the fortress Ready all your men to fight Follow me Archduke is retreating will stop him These are your final moments mercenary Stop them The men are ready Olonese Half a ton of gold waits for us on the other side of these walls Lets take it Attack Lets kill the dogs More than half our men will be killed before they reach the walls Who said so Remember the tiger is a successful animal because he is ruthless sent Hoffer to take care of something Walk Walk And here he is Why do you need all these friars To pray for you No Spaniards wont dare shoot at them Order your brothers to take the ladders and raise them against the walls Never May the Lord have mercy on you Carry the ladders or ll boil you alive Quickly Carry the ladders Forward Forward Hold your fire Those are our Dominicans Dont spout nonsense captain Open fire Order your men to fire Be brave Reinforcements are due any time Quickly the pirates are surrounding the fort Get ready quickly Thats the black corsair Come with me Kill the dogs Climb up Shoot them Where are those reinforcements Hold it This one is mine No he belongs to the archduke Retreat its all lost here To the boats We must reach our galleon Fight the dogs Maracaibo is ours Kill them Kill them This mans will to survive is strong In a few days he will be healthier than either one of us Waiting for my recovery to execute me Dont worry if possible we will kill you sooner Were waiting for archduke Wan Ghould Youre aboard his ship May we go now doctor In my opinion you have bad luck Would be better for you to die sooner Remember me Arent you the count of Laerma Yes And was a prisoner of pirates long enough never to forget to loathe them Dont doubt wont get even You will spare me from agonizing death by hanging thank you did not forget owe you for saving my life You saved me unfortunately Unfortunately have maybe a year to live at best Blood disease they say sickness which afflicts aristocracy when it becomes old and tired sickness that is the sum of all my lifes choices New blood must replace the old Who knows perhaps even pirates And you count of Ventimiglia known as black corsair what blood have you Corsairs or counts Perhaps only the blood of a man searching for truth The difference between justice and injustice Not that obvious Pablo Pedro Your escape wont be comfortable hope you can adapt count of Ventimiglia realize you cannot offer me an entire ship Correct Will a barrel suffice Next time we meet ll return the favor No this makes us even m Spaniard therefore your enemy If we do meet it will be in battle hope you win Rather lose my blood quickly in battle than drop by drop May say have profound respect for you sir And for you We escaped in time Maracaibo just fell We are glad to see you alive am pleased to inform you we have a prisoner you deem highly valuable The Black Corsair Then it is true Where is he In the gallows tied up Take me to him want to see him right away You two leave the barrel and come with me instead Move Idiots You captured a man ve been hunting for years all over the seas an enemy of the Spanish throne And what did you do You let him escape Find him Search everywhere He may still be on board These lazy Spaniards dozing at their posts Letting him escape right under their noses If you cannot find him on board lower the rafts and all after him But the ship will be defenseless What means more to you Dont you understand the black pirate is worth galleons Well see if the Black Corsair will be as dangerous once hanged Lower all rafts Can you see him No Row Head for shore See him now No not yet We must catch him before he makes it to land We were following the archduke and by chance found you raft from the Lightning will be waiting for us in the lagoon quickly There he is See him After him hurry Follow me They are escaping There they are Shoot Wont you rather tell us where the gold is dont know dont know anything The mercenaries hid it ask Wan Ghould What are they shouting Morgan What is that Famous name No name is more famous than mine Look Who would have thought Morgan would seize emirs treasure with handful of dust bet he will become the most famous pirate in all of Tortuga Hope he remains on our side would hate to have him for enemy Hey you who might you be am Jean Davidnol Olonese Olonese Never heard the name m joining him bye Olonese Me too Bye should remind him to return to the Lightning The commander will need us Do you hear anything Nothing Strange thought heard something Dont move be calm Let him be If youre not his enemy neither is he yours They were ours Did you find them Finding anyone in this jungle isnt easy Now what Lets go the other way Now that one he was his enemy See The Lightning is waiting for us My beautiful ship Its me my count Wan Stiller My trustworthy Wan Stiller Yara Jos All on board The raft is ready That is why was waiting here You dont have a sword Take mine dagger is enough for me They discovered us quickly Commander Fire Excellent Carmauxi They were too far away for your knife so you used a canon That may be a good time Still thinking of her If my heart would beat would do so for Honorata What is that That is Wan Ghoulds galleon What is Morgan doing Why doesnt he move They are still out of cannons reach Why doesnt she head for open sea Perhaps hes afraid to lose you But risks to lose my ship Sail to open sea Away from shore Morgan must have gone mad Hes making human targets of them by sending them to the bow Captain fire another round Fire Carmauxi My Lord why arent dead instead See he moved Complete massacre Raise all sails The rudder is blown to bits My ship is lost Their ship is crippled Shall we go after her No she is unimportant Just blow her up Count look The current is floating the bodies towards the galleon We wont even be allowed to give them a proper funeral Soon we will join their fate We cannot go back soldiers are waiting on shore rather go to my death fighting Perhaps might die aboard their ship Forward Row More gun powder They dont have firearms Use swords Stop know your brave men could easily defeat the wretches but likely by killing them While would rather hang the black pirate alive We are with you commander You pretended to be drowned Was Morgans idea How genius told you count of Ventimiglia we shall meet again in battle Please dont force me to kill you Hope you will Its my last chance to die in battle owe you for my life We are even Dont belittle me Fight After me nobody Into the sea Yara knows the question which denies your heart peace Because now so close to death Yara understands many things You too saw what saw Why did they restrain my hand They only did what your heart desired Once in you love entered hatred departed think we are close to the th parallel That is the Gulf Stream The same place we abandoned Honorata to fate The same currents that will carry us to death How ironic and diligent is fate Let it carry you and you will see what Yara now sees what Yara now sees Commander come see who made it back see you are alive and well as ought be Seems we share similar fortune It seems so Maybe the devil fears us So he doesnt want us Just as he didnt want you he doesnt want our Lightning Here he is not These are fresh footsteps leading to the beach They took the small raft Couldnt have gone far Though cant see them Why did they leave think they saw the Lightning Another reason to wait Or to go His ship Lightning represents a way of life to him which now is ended even though is still ours my friends The small raft is carrying them towards a different life a new life
