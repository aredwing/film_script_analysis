know you do You know came up through sales One of the reasons was a great salesman was never made a promise couldnt keep knew that if ever broke my promise d suffer the consequence Is that a threat We worked together for what was it three years Now the work we did here is confidential not for public scrutiny any more than are ones family matters Youre threatening my family now too Now dont be paranoid Jeff About the direction of research here we may have had our differences but Research You declare as a badge of honor you dont even know what makes water boil Well thats why we hire scientists Okay dont believe that you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements was paid well for my work the health and welfare benefits are good the severance package is fair have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which said wouldnt appreciate all that Jeff but upon reflection weve decided to expand our zone of comfort with you so weve drafted a supplement to your agreement It broadly defines and expands in more detail what is confidential Nobody will be able to say Well hells bells Margaret didnt know that was a secret Were very serious about protecting our interests Wed like you to sign it And if dont If we arrive at the conclusion that youre acting in bad faith we would terminate right now payoffs under your severance package you and your familys medical benefits and initiate litigation against you Mr Wigand Dr Wigand Dr Wigand If youve examined the document youll see its in your own best interest and youll sign it What youre saying is it isnt enough that you fired me for no good reason Now you question my integrity On top of the humiliation of being fired you threaten me you threaten my family It never crossed

it Theyre afraid of you arent they They should be Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement Like what Like uh whered you work before Brown Williamson Johnson Johnson Union Carbide in Japan was the general manager and director of new products speak Japanese was a director of corporate development at Pfizer All healthrelated What else outside the zone dont know Do you think the Knicks are gonna make it to the semifinals Just give me an example Okay For example um James Burke Of Johnson Johnson Yeah When he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles he didnt argue with the He didnt even wait for the To tell him He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America instantly And then he developed a safety cap Because as a sure hes gotta be a great businessman right But hes also a man of science Hes not gonna allow his company to put on the shelf a product that might hurt people Not like the Seven Dwarfs Seven Dwarfs Seven of Big Tobacco They got in front of Congress that time It was on television Yeah yeah yeah Swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction It was on Yeah Okay so here you are YouYouYou go to work for tobacco You come from corporate cultures where research really creative thinking these are core values You go to tobacco Tobacco is a sales culture market and sell enormous volume go to a lot of golf tournaments The hell with everything else What are you doing Why are you working for tobacco in the first place cant talk about it The work was supposed to do might have had some positive effect dont know Could have been beneficial Mostly got paid a lot took the money My wife was happy My kids had good medical good schools Got a great house mean what the hell is wrong with that Nothings wrong with that Thats it Youre making money Youre providing for your family What could be wrong with that always thought of myself as a man of science thats whats wrong with it Then youre in a state of conflict Jeff Because look heres how it lays out If youve got vital insider stuff the American people for their welfare really do need to know and you feel impelled to disclose it and violate your agreement in doing so thats one thing On the other hand if you want to honor this agreement then thats simple you do so You say nothing you do nothing Theres only one guy who can figure that out for you and thats you all by yourself gotta go pick up the girls They only had a half a day ve heard virtually all the We touched on it Yes or no do you believe nicotine is not addictive Congressman cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic definitions of addiction There is no intoxication Well take that as no Again time is short think each of you believe nicotine is not addictive and just would like to have this for the record believe that nicotine is not addictive too believe that nicotine He referred to this the Seven Dwarfs What Seven Dwarfs The seven Of Big Tobacco referred to this Said they should be afraid of him assume afraid of what he could reveal Now you tell me What does this guy have to say that threatens these people Well it isnt cigarettes are bad for you Hardly new news No shit Whats this What that is is tobaccos standard defense Its the we dont know litany Addiction We believe not Disease We dont know We take a bunch of leaves we roll them together you smoke em After that youre on your own We dont know So that tells me nothing Besides youll never get what hes got Why not Because of this guys confidentiality agreement hes never gonna be able to talk to you Thats not good enough This guy is the top scientist in the numberthree tobacco company in America Hes a corporate officer You never get whistleblowers from Fortune companies This guy is the ultimate insider Hes got something to say He wants to say it want it on Minutes Doesnt matter what he wants Am missing something here What do you mean Mike Hes got a corporate secrecy agreement Give me a break This is a public health issue like an unsafe air frame on a passenger jet or some company dumping cyanide into the East River Issues like that He can talk we can air it Theyve got no right to hide behind a corporate agreement Pass the milk They dont need the right They got the money The unlimited checkbook Thats how Big Tobacco wins every time on everything They spend you to death million a year in outside legal ChadbournePark Ken Starrs firm Kirkland and Ellis Listen And Ford they get nailed after or pickups blow up right These clowns have never mean ever Not even once Not even with hundreds of thousands dying each year from an illness related to their product have ever lost a personal injury lawsuit On this case theyll issue gag orders sue for breach anticipatory breach enjoin him you us his pet dog the dogs veterinarian tie em up in litigation for ten or years m telling you they bat a thousand Every time He knows that Thats why hes not gonna talk to you Okay lets look through the looking glass the other way What do you mean We got a guy who wants to talk but hes constrained What if he were compelled to talk Oh torture Great ratings What do you mean compelled mean compelled by a uh Justice Department State courts Be a witness That would cut through any confidentiality agreement wouldnt it What does that do What do you mean what does it do What mean is like how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement Because he has to uh reveal it in a court of law Its on record Its out Its no secret anymore So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate Its out in the world If you could engineer it into the court record you might have something They would have a hell of a time trying to restrain his speech then wouldnt they Yeah but what venue And where does he get Does he have killer attorneys dont think hes got any attorneys Hes gonna need attorneys who arent afraid of risking years of litigation and millions of dollars of their own dough in legal costs What do you say Mike What do you think Even if he gets the defense team will he go for it Youre awfully overqualified Dr Wigand m trying to start a new career believe could be a good teacher Let me give it some thought And not a lot of companies in the health care field hire extobacco scientists Thats it Its where our babies were born Debbie took her first steps right there on In the grass didnt plan on this

preliminary You didnt tell her we were taping What did she think she was coming to New York for Talk about it think about it had a plan to uh ease her into it but really dont know how to do that Oh man Who are these people Ordinary people under extraordinary pressure Mike What the hell you expect grace and consistency Five four three two You heard Mr Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive believe Mr Sandefur perjured himself because watched those testimonies very carefully All of us did mean there was this whole line of people whole line of s up there swearing Part of the reason m here is that felt that their representation clearly misstated at least within Brown Williamsons representation clearly misstated what is common language within the company We are in the nicotine delivery business And thats what cigarettes are for Delivery device for nicotine delivery device for nicotine Put it in your mouth light it up and youre going to get your fix Youre gonna get your fix Youre saying that Brown Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix not by artificially adding nicotine but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia The process is known as impact boosting While not spiking nicotine they clearly manipulate it There is extensive use of this technology known as ammonia chemistry It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system The straw that broke the camels back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called coumarin When came on board at they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste and had been unsuccessful wanted it out immediately was told that it would effect sales so should mind my own business constructed a memo to Mr Sandefur indicating could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew we had documentation was similar to coumadin a lungspecific carcinogen And you sent the document forward to Sandefur sent the document forward to Sandefur was told that we would continue to work on a substitute We werent going to remove it as it would impact sales and that that was his decision In other words you are charging Sandefur and Brown Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously Most certainly And on March Thomas Sandefur Of Brown Williamson had you fired And the reason he gave you Poor communication skills And you wish you hadnt come forward You wish you hadnt blown the whistle Yeah there are times wish hadnt done it There are times feel com compelled to do it If youd asked me would do it again do think its worth it Yeah think its worth it Hi Hi My name is Jeff Wigand You can call me uh Mr Wigand You can call me Dr Wigand have a Ph In biochemistry and endocrinology You can call me Jeff Anything else you want to call me youll have to do so

to meet you Dr Wigand Mikes our attorney general down here was just explaining to Jeff they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today Right Now they tried to get the Mississippi court to honor it but the judge threw it out However for you there is a more perilous effect of the gag order Dr Wigand you do understand what can happen dont you m not free to testify

compromised held hostage do know how it is You attract a crowd Yeah Great heard about the Kentucky gag order dont know what to do Hold on a second Would you please ask Mr Motley if he expects his

morning No mean since whenever Fuck it Lets go to court Dr Wigand would like to leave now Okay Jeff m gonna sit you down at that table over there want to start as fast as possible dont want to give them a chance to get another restraining order Okay Lets go Good luck Doc Please stand Raise your right hand Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God do You may be seated You understand Dr Wigand you are under oath This is a sworn deposition Theres no judge Its not a trial Will you state your name for the record Jeffrey Wigand Got any idea whats going on in there No dont have a clue That is correct In other words it acts as a drug Object to the form of the question It acts as a drug Object to the form It acts as a drug Object Is there an echo in here Your objections been recorded She typed it into her little machine over there Its on the record So now ll proceed with my deposition of my witness Does it act as a drug Dr Wigand am instructing you not to answer that question In accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown Williamson Tobacco Company And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you by the court in the state of Kentucky That means you dont talk Mr Motley we have rights here Oh youve got rights And lefts Ups and downs and middles So what You dont get to instruct anything around here This is not North Carolina not South Carolina nor Kentucky This is the sovereign state of Mississippis proceeding Wipe that smirk off your face Dr Wigands deposition will be part of this record And m gonna take my witness testimony whether the hell you like it or not Answer the question Doctor Yes It produces a physiological response which meets the definition of a drug Um nicotine is associated with impact satisfaction It has a pharmacological effect that crosses the bloodbrain barrier intact Thank you Doctor Thank you One of the reasons m here is that felt that their representation clearly Run that Sandefur piece on nicotines not addictive Run that on camera then cut right to Wigand with believe they perjured Then go wide to the all taking the oath Then back on Jeff and play the pause after the word felt on the side Hell of a show Mike Explosive material It went great in Mississippi Mike Good heard Wigands deposition got sealed Yeah They argued that he was going to reveal the secret formula of Kools to the world Sealed doesnt hurt Scruggs litigation and since were the only ones with the story believe were sitting on an exclusive like that Corporate has some questions Weve got a meeting at Black Rock first thing in the morning Whens the air date Lowell Sharons on line three Tell her ll call her back in ten Here we go That they had long known that the nicotine in tobacco is an addictive drug despite their public statements to the contrary Like the testimony before Congress of Dr Wigands former boss Brown Williamsons chief executive officer Thomas Sandefur believe that nicotine is not addictive believe Mr Sandefur perjured himself because watched those testimonies very carefully All of us did There was this whole line of people whole line of s up there all swearing Part of the reason m here is that felt that their representation clearly misstated what is common language within the company We are in the nicotine delivery business There is extensive use of this technology known as ammonia chemistry It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system Thats what cigarettes are for Delivery device for nicotine delivery device for nicotine Put it in your mouth light it up and youre going to get your fix Youre going to get your fix Shall send for coffee Sorry m late No were fine Are you sure Yeah All right thought wed get together because theres a legal concept that has been getting some new attention recently Tortious interference If two people have an agreement like a confidentiality agreement and one of them breaks it because they are induced to do so by a third party the third party can be sued for damages for interfering Hence tortious interference Interfering Thats what we do think what were trying to tell you is that it happens all the time This is a news organization People are always telling us things they shouldnt We have to verify if its true and in the public interest And if it is we air it And after we corroborate it Thats why weve never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show Anything else And Minutes verification is exact and precise And dont think it would hurt to make sure youre right on this one Why You think we have liability Whats the News position Eric Theres a possibility Its rather remote But one we have to check on Mike ve retained outside counsel to do exactly that on a segment might add thats already rife with problems What does that mean Rife with m told unusual promises were made to Wigand No only that we would hold his story until it was safe for him And m told there are questions as to our star witness veracity His veracity was good enough for the state of Mississippi Our standards have to be higher than anyone elses because we are the standard for everybody else Well as a standard ll hang with is this guy telling the truth Well with tortious interference m afraid the greater the truth the greater the damage Come again They own the information hes disclosing The truer it is the greater the damage to them If he lied he didnt disclose their information and the damages are smaller Is this Alice in Wonderland You said on this one What about this one If this holds up And it very well may not Mike But if it did and we aired this segment and was sued by Brown Williamson think we could be at grave risk How grave Well at the end of the day because of your segment the Brown Williamson Tobacco Company could own Oh You know am sorry but m due upstairs Is Corporate telling News Do not go to air with this story Youre getting ahead of yourself Were all in this together Were all Well find out soon Thank you gentlemen Tortious interference That sounds like a disease caught by a radio Lunch Sure Dont worry We call the shots around here Hello Debbie its me want you to check some filings and give me John Wilsons number at BearStearn What now Klusters coming over Hello Lowell Mike Don There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand ve decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview ve decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview So what happened to Ms Caperellis checking with outside counsel first All that crap Thats happening Hopefully we wont have to use the alternate but we should have it in the can m not touching my film m afraid you are No m not Were doing this with or without you Lowell If you like can assign another producer to edit your show Since when has the uh paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on Minutes Its an alternate version So what if we have an alternate version And dont think our being cautious is so damned unreasonable So now if you will excuse me gentlemen Mr Rathers been complaining about his chair again Before you go discovered this Filing for the sale of Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation What Yeah heard rumors Its not a rumor Its a sale If Tisch can unload for a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion dollar lawsuit from Brown Williamson that could screw up the sale could it not What are you implying m not implying m quoting Uh More vested interests Persons who will profit from this merger Ms Helen Caperelli general counsel of News million Mr Eric Kluster president of News Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money No no of course theyre not influenced by money They work for free And you are a volunteer executive producer does not do that And youre questioning our journalistic integrity No m questioning your hearing You hear reasonable and tortious interference hear potential Brown Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of to Westinghouse hear Shut the segment down Cut Wigand loose Obey orders and fuck off Thats what hear Youre exaggerating am You pay me to go get guys like Wigand to draw him out to get him to trust us to get him to go on television do deliver him He sits He talks He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement And hes only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue maybe the biggest most expensive corporate malfeasance case in History And Jeffrey Wigand whos out on a limb does he go on television and tell the truth Yes Is it newsworthy Yes Are we gonna air it Of course not Why Because hes not telling the truth No Because he is telling the truth Thats why were not gonna air it And the more truth he tells the worse it gets You are a fanatic an anarchist You know that If we cant have a whole show then want half a show rather than no show But oh no Not you You wont be satisfied unless youre putting the company at risk What are you Are you a businessman or are you a newsman Because that happens to be what Mike and and some other people around here do for a living Lowell Put the corporation at risk Give me a fucking break These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do on the line Lowell What m with Don on this Whats wrong Theyre killing

On the dating back to The most recent trouble for Wigand occurred here And in local news Louisville has gained access to a page dossier on former Brown Williamson research head Jeffrey Wigand detailing charges of shoplifting and failing to pay child support Wigand is currently teaching chemistry and Japanese at the DuPont Manual High School Maria Thousands of documents from inside the tobacco industry have surfaced over the past year Documents that appear to confirm what a former Surgeon general and the current head of the Food and Drug Administration have been saying We learned of a tobacco insider who could tell us whether or not the tobacco industry has been leveling with the public That insider was formerly a highlyplaced executive with a tobacco company But we cannot broadcast what critical information about tobacco addiction and public health he might be able to offer Why Because he had to sign a confidentiality agreement with the tobacco company he worked for The management of has told us that knowing he had that agreement if we were to broadcast an interview with him could be faced with a multibillion dollar lawsuit The fact is we are not allowed even to mention his name or the name of the company he worked for And of course we cannot show you his face And your confidentiality agreement with Is still in force Yes it is So what are they gonna do Sue

reason m here is that felt that their representation can be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system Hello Jim its Lowell Hey where are you Remember

a segment that allowed a tobacco giant to crash this network Does it give someone at my time of life pause Yeah Mike in my You and have been doing this together for years This is todays New York Times In it is the whole sordid story of what went on inside our shop And in the editorial it accuses us of betraying the legacy of Edward Murrow They conclude most of it seems pretty unsubstantiated Youre

Yeah hold on Dons looking for you Good The subheading is Brown Williamson has a page dossier attacking chief critic It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistleblower close look at the file and independent research by this newspaper into its key claim indicates that many of the serious allegations against Mr Wigand are backed by scant or contradictory evidence This news division has been vilified in The New York Times in print on television for caving to corporate interests The New York Times ran a blowbyblow of what we talked about behind closed doors You fucked us No You fucked you Dont invert stuff Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand You bought it The Wall Street Journal here not exactly a bastion of anticapitalist sentiment refutes Big Tobaccos smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination And now even now when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the state of Mississippi the cat totally out of the bag youre still standing here debating Don what the hell else do you need Mike you tell him You fucked up Don Its old news
