adulthood and slowly maturity to old age Using the latest medical imaging and computer graphics we embarked on an extraordinary voyage through the body This is not just the story of one life it is the story of all our lives told from a unique perspective depth inside the living body and a new life was created single cell has developed into a fully formed baby We are about to be born It is impossible to know exactly what it likes to be born even though weve all been through it Its certainly surprisingits probably painful What scientists do know is that at the moment of birth we experience a surge of adrenaline even more intense than during a heart attack This surge of adrenaline helps us live It kicks start our lungs into during the first breathe Our lungs have never breathed before they are still filled with amniotic fluid were in danger of drowning On top of the kidneys the adrenal glands flood the blood stream with adrenaline muscles we need to breathe suddenly going to spasm and we take our first breath It is the most important breathe of our life the first of million air rushes down the trachea through thousand of branching tubes into nearly million tiny air sacs the alveoli these absorb oxygen into our blood and draw out the carbon dioxide we exhale with every breath Now the umbilical cord the physical link between mother and baby is cut we are on our own a babys organs must adapt to life outside the womb It is a challenging and risky time Our heart no bigger than walnut has already being pumping for months but in the first days of life there is a problem with it It has holes one in the aorta and one in the heart In fact these holes are not defects they are remnant of life before birth when blood circulated through a system of blood vessels to the placenta the holes used to divert most of blood away from our inactive lungs but now the lung is fully functioning they seal up forever Now the heart is working normally it pumps blood through the tens of thousands of miles of blood vessels our other organsre also coming online too The liver performs over very jobs from generating body heat to processing toxins The kidneys function is to maintain the balance of water in the body Our digestive tract must clear itself out ready to take its first meal our bowel is full of digested amniotic fluid and dead cells a sticky green black tarry material called meconium It is corrosive stuff In some babies meconium can end up in the lungs and attack the delicate lining though here in the gut meconium is harmless and is flushed out within hours The first gulp of breast milk accelerate this process The turmoil of birth might now be over but the bussiness of adapting to life outside the womb has only just begun newborn baby in a first months of life This is the time when we start to make sense of world around us and began to explore it infancy is a period of rapid growth both outside and in The human body is a miracle of microscopic design tiny perefectly formed orgams each made up of billions of perfectly functioning cells These cells are the building blocks of the body they make us what we are inside every cell is the same extraordinary engine a machine that tells each cell how to grow and what function it must perform it s and it s unique to every person is the chemical blue print of who we are the instructions that create each new person and sends among the journey of life not only determines our looks and character but also sets out the timeline of our lives it decides when we grow when we develop when we age and even when we die But our life is also shaped by environment around us and the people we share it with Our life outside the womb is still a challenge Even though our mother keeps us warm we cant regulate our body temperature It was degrees in the womb Here at home degrees room temprature is a shock to the system The problem is the region of the brain we use for temprature control the hypothalamus is immature Our infant brain is under pressure it is Already making trillion simultaneous calculations every second our hypothalamus just cant cope with additional task if keeing us warm as well right now were in danger of hypothermia The infrared camera shows the struggle to keep warm we are losing precious body heat The yellow area show where we lose the most Luckily we were born prepared We have a special layer of tissue that keeps us warm it s fat normaly found in hibernating animals Much more than just a insulating layer this fat is packed with special cells which actively generate heat eventually most of this fat melts away as the hypothalamus matures and takes over the job of temperature control just days old we know almost nothing about her world Everything we do we do by instinct even breast feeding our mothers milk gives us all the nutrients we need And we drink half of liter of it every day it is much more than a ultimate super food it also protects us from hidden dangers Outside the womb there are bacteria everywhere invisible and potentially deadly Our skin is under constant attack There are times more bacteria than human cells in and on our body Our immune system is under develop and we cant fight infections of our cells amazingly our mother fights them for us through her milk The close contact between mother and baby means she absorbs the same germs theyre attacking us her Mature immune system creates antibodies to kill off these bacteria Then in masterpiece of natural design she passes those antibodies to her baby in breast milk until our own immune system develops she will keep us safe Breast feeding builds a deep bond between mother and child a bond that will guide us through infancyand into the outside world At this age even a simple trip to the supermarket is a sensory overload Its noisy bright and smelly High up inside the nose the specialised olfactory nerves in the stream of air we breathe they detect chemicals and send an electrical signal to the brain Our brain interprets these signals as smells Our sense of smell is very sensitive we quickly learn to recognize smells and can identify our mother with our nose The strange new world is also very noisy Were bombarded with hundreds of strange new sounds sound waves make the eardrum vibrate On the other side of the eardrum these tiny bones the ossicles vibrate in sympathy Theyre the smallest three bones in our body Theyre so small that can fit on a fingertip get any bigger they stay the size all our life But without them we would never hear a thing the ossicles are the air amplifiers they amplify the volume times The amplified vibrations enter the inner ear the cochlea its lined with delicate hairs When vibrations pass through the hairs vibrate at the top lowfrequency hairs at the base fragile hairs to high frequency sounds Each one times thinner than a hair on our head Over time loud noises will damage these hairs but at this age they are perfect our hearing will never be this good again for eye sight the story is different The world is blurred and without color Our eyesre around the develop we cant pointerize where we and a imature lenses can not focus The lens flips the image it receives our brains corret the image later Babies cant yet see in color because the retina the screen in the back of the eye is also immature the retina has two types of special cells rods and cones They turn light into electrical signals the ones to detect color the cones are still developing so we see almostly in black and white From the retina the signals travel along thick nerves to the back of brain where we process visual information When the image arrives the real challenge begins Our immature brain has not yet learned to interpret the data thats changing fast by months we can distinguish colors and shades At months we can identify facial patterns and by months we have vision babys eyes undergo another amazing change When were born our eyes are blue but gradually cells of the iris begin making pigments the iris changes into striking pattern of color a pattern that is unique to each of us Were changing in other ways too over the first months we grow by of our orginal body weight every month fortunately that growth rate slows If it didt we would all wiegh a frightening tons by th birthday around the same as a blue whale At months all our sense is working properly were begining to explore the world and the sense we use most is touch When we touch something receptors in our fingertips send the electrical impulses through sensory nerves in our skin upon arms along the spinal cord and in to the brain The impulses travel fast km hour Sometimes even this is too slow the body reacts to painful sensation like a exteme heat by a taking a shortcut The spinal cord intercepts pain messages and immediately sends back a reflex response and we move out away We have sensory receptors all over our skin but some areas are more sensitive than others The hands face and mouth there are sensory receptors on the tongue alone this is why babies use their mouths to explore the world There is another reason for all our gnawing our baby teeth are coming through milk teeth formed deep in the gums while were still in the womb Now one by one they are bursting through Its painful but it is progress at last we can eat solid food Digestions start in the mouth The teeth grind up the food next special glands under the tongue pump out saliva it Helps break down food Saliva also lubricates the food on its hours meters journey through the gut itll Pass from the stomach into the small intestine and finally the large intestine waves of contracting muscle keep up food move through out journey in a process call peristalsis The contractions are so powerful we can even eat upside down This is a unique view of where the food is heading For the first time a new camera shows a high definition view of the journey through our stomach Food enters the stomach through a hole at top The stomach is a bag of muscle it churns squashes and squeezes the food into liquid At the same time acid breaks down the food The acid is so corrosive the stomach continually coats its interior walls with mucus for protection Without it stomach ulcers would form After about an hour the stomach squeezes the broken down food through a tiny hole called the pyloric sphincter The food enters the small intestine a and half meter coil of tube This is where we absorb most of nutrients First the pancreas pumps out juice that neutralizes the stomach acid then bile from the liver breaks down the fat into tiny droplets Smaller droplets are easily for intestine to adsorb The interior wall of the small intestine is lined with million of microscopic projections called villi These increase the surface area of the gut making it easy to absorb nutrients After an hour and a half the small intestine has absorbed most of the nutrients from the food Whats left enters the large intestine through this the ileocecal sphincter its a valve that prevents our food going back there are few nutrients left to absorb Now the large intestines main job is to extract water What remains is a mixture of waste food dead cells and lots of bacteria these bacteria in the large intestine arent infection they produce enzymes that break down complex carbohydrates in our food carbohydrates we couldnt have Finally after about hours we expel what remains of the meal by the age of one we start to interact with our world Were more independent from our mothers and now we can crawl we begin to explore the world on our own We can crawl because our bones have got stronger they need to be were getting pretty heavy at birth our skeleton is mostly cartilage the same material our earsre made of Cartilage is flexible it what ables us to squeeze through the birth canal But after birth our soft skeleton is a problem cartilage is too weak to support the growing body and protect vital organs so it gradually hardens into bone Cells called osteoblasts minerals that turn soft cartilage into hard bone Some bones also fused together When we are born we have gaps between the plates of our skull These allowed the skull to deform during birth gradually close until our skull is finally complete As a skeleton develops so these desire to get around Were about to hit one of the major milestones in our life learning to walk The key to walking isnt strength its balance and the secret to standing is hidden deep inside the ears Behind the ossiclesthe bones used for hearing there are looping structures Each loop is about the size of small coin and oriented in planes These semicircular canals are part of the ear but have nothing to do with hearing theyre filled with liquid and they work like a spirit level they Tell us whats up and whats down the hair send data to our brain about how we are oriented and our direction of movement they help us balance and stand on two feet And once weve mastered balance were one step closer to learning to walk Now there is no limit on where we can go and what we can do From a baby to a toddler Were about to begin our formative years time when well put our growing brain and developing a new system to the test From infancy to childhood were still growing fast and learning to stand on our own two feet next is a uniquely huge challenge learning to speak Most of us learn to talk by our first birthday but by years old were learning new words a day This is the Brocas area With it you can create sentences and communicate complex thoughts Language is what separates us from other animals By talking we can exchange thoughts and ideas We can teach our children not just by showing but by telling As our brain develops we gain other uniquely human qualities Were aware of our own identity and individuality we learn to think for ourselves We become concsious of ourselves as individual and Were forming memories that will last a lifetime human childhood is unique Few other mammals spend such a huge potion of their lifes preparing for adulthood to do so would be a costly waste of time by the equivalent age in their life span most mamal like dogs would already be reproducing a timeline set by our clock puts a delay on our sexual development to give us enough time for one thing learning it takes well over a decade to learn complex skill we need to become adult and evetually parents ourselves through our childhood were prime to learn Our brain is a mass of billion nerve cells called neurons Between themthey generate enough electricity to keep a light bulb burning for a day the Neurons communicate using electric impulses Each impulse is a tiny fraction of a thought and memory When we hear a new word our ears convert the sound into electrical impulses in our brain The brain can learn because the connections between the brain cellthe neurons arent permanent The brain revise itselfs the Neurons send out tentacles constantly forming new connections where they meet is a synapse Chemicals called neuro transmitters bridge the gap to allow the impulse to continue the chain The new connections form a pattern a new memory We learn by making new connections between brain cells and then reinforced them through repetition The stronger the reinforcement the more likely the memoryll stick And when later someone asks us to recall that memory the same pattern of brain cells and we remember the answer Because the brain grows quickly in childhood millions of new connectionsll be made all the time making this the prefect time to learn Learning takes many forms Not only in class room but also in the world at large We learn by experience and sometimes these experiences are unpleasant because were programmed to try out new things when were young we take risk with our body Fortunately capable of repairing itself when injure cut knee is part of childhood As soon as skin is broken the bodys repair mechanisms swing into action blood capillaries can constrict to reduce bleeding next platelets a type of blood cell make the blood in the cut become viscous and clot Eventually the clot forms a plug that stops blood leaking out Our cells multiply at profilic rate not only to increase their numbers of cells in the body but also to replace worn out tissue with newer stronger bigger versions Its the same process of cell growth that heals wounds In fact were so good at healing in our youth even the scar disappears Childhood is also the time when our horizons expand we Interact with more and more people But this increased sociabiliy exposes us to an incresed risk of infection Fortunately our body has a arsenal of defenses against germs Eyebrows eyelashes ear hairs and nasal hairs catch airborne bacteria Sweat tears mucus wash them off And skin constantly sheds its top layer of cells taking bacteria with it The mouth is especially vulnerable recent discoveries have shown that pathogens found here are so potent that if they ended up in vital organ like heart they can even prove fatal Fortunately the body has a secret weapon saliva contains lysozyme an enzyme specially develop to destroy bacteria though tiny saliva glands create nearly liters of saliva every day When a pathogen like chicken pox does break through these external defenses our immune system must react to prevent serious infection Thousands of tiny viruses travel through the blood The virus hijacks a cell Then the infected cell ruptures spreading yet more vireses around the body The outward signs of chickenpox are rash and high temperature The fever that comes with the infection is a sign that the body is fighting back The heat slows down the spread of the disease viruses dont reproduce so well when its hot The immune system kicks into action White blood cells latched onto the infected cells and pumping poisonous proteins it kills the cell but it kills the viruses too The crusty skin pustules theyre remnants of the battle between the immune system and the chicken pox Each one contains cell debrid and thousands of dead viruses It may be unpleasant but getting diseases like this when were young is vital for our developing immune system Our body creates memory molecules against the viruses antibodies we use to rely on antibody form our mothers milk now we make our own If we catch the same disease when were older the antibodies enable our body to recognize the virus instantly white blood cells wipe it out before it ever takes hold this makes childhood the ideal time for vaccination Vaccines are harmless doses of certain types of virus like rubella mumps or polio they prompt the body to create antibodies just As it would if infected by the age of childhood is nearly over and Were about to change like never before Were on the brink of adulthood But firstthe hormone surge of puberty Puberty doesnt stick to a schedule it begins at any time depending our clock our lifestyles even our diet whether female or male for all of us it begins in brain At the base the hypothalamus the same region that controls our body temperature Puberty starts when the hypothalamus releases the protein Kisspeptin into the brain the Kisspeptin triggers the release of other hormones throughout the body This stimulates the sex organs to mature In girls that means ovulation For the first time on television a high definition view of the ovaries these off white organs This unique footage from Gold Coast fertility Centre shows some thing incredible An egg inside a protective blister of liquid At ovulationthe blister ruptures the egg inside will travel down the fallopian tube or lost in menstruation From the onset of puberty ovulation occurs once a month But the ovaries begin another equally important role they start release in hormones into the bloodstream including estrogens they Have dramatic and lasting effects on both emotional and physical develoment Both boys and girls experience a growth spread and each day when we look in the mirror we see a new face looking back And the entire body changes beyond recognition girls become women boys become man male brains also release kisspeptin during puberty the flood of new hormones stimulate the testicles to stop producing sperm The testicles also generated fold increase in testosterone the hormone that turns boy into a man The larynx opens upon to its forward the vocal cords stretch wider the longer cords vibrate at a lower pitch The voice deepens Testosterone also stimulates the growth of body hair and doubles muscle mass These are changes we can see and hear but were changing inside too In the brain nerve cells undergo extensive The result is a transformation of our mood and character Both sexes suffer of torrent of new emotions and one new emotion bigest them all For the first time both sex is finding other sex attractive From the inside out our bodies are overwhelmed with new sensations our pulse raises our blood pressures rises Our lips gorge our cheeks flash with blood Thesere all signals that we desire someone And sometimes that desire turns out to be mutual In adolescence another major life milestone our first kiss In the first decades of life the human body accomplishes something close to miraculous Were nearly times our orginal height Were times heavier weve digested nearly tons of food our heart has beaten over billion times and our lungs have drawn million breath Finally were ready in mind and body to become an adult From teens to twenties the rapid growth of childhood and puberty gives way to a new phase of life adulthood The s are our peak years both outside and inside Our body stops growing taller but itll never stop changing trillions of cells make up Our organs and tissues over time these wear out or get damaged New cells grow and divide to replace old ones Over time whole organs are renewed we get vaguely a brand new body every years Some tissues regenerate even faster Thats why we need to come herefor our hair and nails hairs are made from modified dead skin cells Each hair grows from a hair follicle embedded in the skin the Modified cells grow here then die as new cells push them up we grow an incredible km of hair over our whole body every year Our hair grows whether we want it to or not However other parts of our body are partially under our control choices we make now like taking exercise affect us for the rest of our lives exercise strengthens the heart its the bodys hardest working muscle Exercise also makes our heart muscle more efficient each contraction pumps more blood so the heart can beat slower its a similar story in the lungs Exercise stimulates extra capillaries to grow so we absorb more oxygen with each breath we Also inhale bigger breath so every tiny air sack in the lungs gets filled The surface area of all these sacks is huge if u lay them all flat they would cover a tennis court working out also strengthens our skeleton exertion puts pressure on the bones that encourages the bone cells to renew bone fibers Specialized cells called osteoclasts eat out way all the damaged bone other cells osteoblasts rebuild it with newerstronger material The result dense strong bone At the same time Our muscles also build This is a new imaging technique that combines the highest resolution ctscans with cutting edge computer power its called Volumedic And it shows how over skeletal muscle make up to a thirth of our adult body weight muscles are made up from bundles of fibers a good work out rips these fibers apart When our cells repair the damage afterwards they add extra material The muscles grow back bigger and stronger through choices we made unfortunately some choices are less beneficial Some choices expose us to damage that even our youthful cells cannt repair parties are part of life in your twenties we all know smoke can damage the lungs But the smoke is not the only hazard here From the day we were born our ears have been gradually damaged by loud noise The problem is deep inside the ear past the ossicle bones inside the cochlea These fine hairs the stereocilia turn sound into nerve impulses they are very fragile Loud noise destroys these irreplaceable cells the hairs that respond to high frequencies almost affected possibly because loud high pitch sounds shape their foundations more violently The effects still too small to notice but the frequencies range of our hearing is already shrinking Another source of damage is alcohol though social drinking is very much part of growing up alcohol is a poison As we absorb it into our bloodstream it affects both our organs and our state of mind afew drinks raise the heart rate and blood pressure it makes us feel relaxed we lose our inhibitions and our fine coordination These sensations are the result of chemical reactions inside the brain especially in this region the cerebellum the region responsible for the coordination and balance Alcohol causes a chemical imbalance in the neurons While some synapses except signals more often others become blocked and the more we drink the more the synapses are affected Alcohol also fools the brain to thinking weve drunk too much water it senses the kidneys into overdraft expelling valuable liquid into the bladder we may not feel dehydrated now but the next morning is a different story After a party its the liver that clears up the mess The liver is the bodys biochemical control center it Performs over functions One of thems to convert poisons into harmless chemicals one of the poisons is alcohol The process demands water and the liver doesnt care where it takes it from the brain is water When the liver demands water its the brain that suffers Water and essential minerals are sucked out and the brain shrinks away from the skull We experience a very particular kind of headache a hangover The best cure drink some water Time passes and we get to know our limits now new challenge is around horizon It is time to find love and have children of our own Many of us meet our future partner at work We may think the attraction is social or physical but alot of it is biological too We use our eyes to date but looks arent every thing attraction is also about smell Inside our nose the olfactory nerves do more than detect smells They also detect chemicals we cant smell pheromones odorless hormonal messengers we release in our sweat Pheromones are much more than the bodys natural perfume they carry detailed information about our genetic health and our ability to resist disease Our brains detect these signals and help us choose a partner with the best possible genes But love is not just an emotion Its a bond chemistry When we see a partner we release adrenaline into the blood our heart pounds we cant sleep And then as we get closer and more involved with our lover another hormone comes into play our brain floods with dopamine The feelgood hormone As potent as cocaine it induces euphoria and its addictive it leaves us on thing more eventually after a time together we start thinking about the final stage of love commitment marriage and even kids Love both chemical and emotional wins the Its a relationship we hope a last lifetime and the process of longterm bonding is chemical too Sex isnt just about procreation or recreation It also strengthens the bond between lovers During orgasm both partners pituitary glands flood the bodies with oxytocin the bonding hormone Its the very same hormone that binds us to our mother as new born baby The more sex we have the more oxytocin we produce the stronger the bond between us Some anthropologists believe oxytocin could be evolutions way of creating a bond the strong enough to keep parents together through the trials of parenthood And the time for parenthood is now An egg the largest cell in the human body ripens and bursts from the ovary it begins the same monthly journey hundreds of others made before it While were lost in menstruation this ones destined to become a baby the smallest cells in the body enter the vagina during ejaculation They have a tough journey front of them First they must survive the hostile environment of the vagina its secretions to prevent bacterial infection but they also kill sperm Most of sperm are killed before they reach the cervix the Surviving sperms swim on into the uterus and fallopian tubes Muscular contractions in the walls of the fallopian tube helps the sperm towards the egg Only a few hundred make it this far And only one will succeed in fertilizing the egg This truely is survival of the fittest only the most viable sperm with the best will survive to pass on its genes so far there is no sign of what is happened Were totally unaware that were about to embark a new chapter in our life over the next weeks a single cell will develop into baby Often the first symptom is morning sickness No one knows for sure what causes the nausea but one theory is that it protects the fetus from toxins in food these could harm its tiny organs during this critical phase of development Another theory is that nausea is side effect of the mothers immune system as it weakens to avoid attacking the developing embryo The fetus is effectively a parasite It the mothers energies as it draws what it needs from her body it has its own life support system the placenta Here the mothers blood passes nutrients across a membrane into the fetal blood Thanks to this constant nourishment The baby grows over grams in weeks and the uterus expands up to a times its normal size just to hold it The story of human life continues form the peak years of early adulthood to the joy of becoming a parent As our children grow older so do we Our body is about to face the next challenge by this time of life our body has already peaked We have been aging for many years but it is only now in our s we really notice out changing appearance Our body is changing and begining to show its age The cumulative effect of years in the sun causes the first symptom Our skin is getting wrinkled since birth we have been replacing our skin at astonishing rate We can make up to new skin cells every minute these replace the dead cells with constantly sheding by weve created more than kg of dust from old skin cells Our skin cells are never more than a even at middle age wrinkles are not caused by damage to the cells The problem is the stuff that binds some together collagen Ultraviolet radiation in sunlight triggers a molecular chain reaction which degrades collagen the fibers get thiner and break our middle age skin loses its elasticity become saggy and wrinkly as we enter our s our bodys metabolism may be slowing down but our lifestyle isnt We have a growing family and a demanding career And this can create another killer stress We all recognize the outward signs of stress sweaty palmsa shortness breath a dizzy feeling but the real damage takes place inside our body When weve stressed the body instinctively shifts into the fight or flight mood hormones adrenaline and cortisol flood from the adrenal glands into the bloodstream This makes muscles contract arteries constricts and heart pump faster increasing blood pressure We evolved the fight or flight reflects to respond to attacks from predators But we cannt escape our predator The pressure of being a working parent and our body has no release Its the constant triggering of fight or flight that can be damaging to our body Stress make cause irreparable harm to our cardiovascular network speeding up the aging process in blood vessels the High blood pressure damages cells in the artery walls they Become stiff and thick Especially here in the biggest artery the aorta arteries with stiff walls restrict blood flow around the body our Blood pressure rises so our heart must work harder Its a vicious circle The more stress we exprience the more we damage our blood vessels And more damaged of our blood vessels the less able we are to deal with the effects of stress If stress gets out of control the heart can become enlarged as it struggles to force blood through our narrowing lessy elastic blood vessel High blood pressure can also rupture blood vessels in the brain causing stroke Most of us learn to manage stress but for women at s another factor compounds the problem menopause During menopause the ovaries run out of eggs they Also stop producing the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone Its signals the end of womens reproductive life As the supply of hormones winds down it upsets the balance in regions of the brain responsible for mood sleep and temperature control when the hypothalamus is turned off course hot flushes occur moment when the body cant its Not just the brain that affected bones and muscles tissues also weaken a womans bodies spend its whole life getting accustomed to these hormones no theyre gone and the aging process accelerates as children leave home and we retire from work our body enters a new phase of life old age has arrived in years we have grown from a tiny baby to an adult from child to parent to grandparent the Aging process began several decades ago Now we are on the of old age Its the final chapter in the journey of life When we retire from work our life style begins to slow Our bodys slowing down too The outward signs of aging are only part of the story our senses are affected We have been losing the sensory hairs we used to hear from our cochlea since birth Now most of higherfrequency hairs are gone Were even losing hairs in lowerfrequencies theyre slowly seizing up These days we struggle to hear our sight continues to worsen The lenses in our eyes become stiffer and even change color from clear blue to frosty yellow brown the result of lifetime exposure to ultraviolet light most of usre never aware of this change our brain just works harder to compensate for it Aging also has a dramatic effect on our skeleton Bone cells still hard to work destroying old bone and replacing it with new bone But old day between them osteoclasts destroying bone faster than osteoblasts can build it What remains is Our bones slowly crumble And broken bones become a very real danger it happens in both sexes but hormonal changes of menopause accelerate bone loss faster in women ageing is one of the great mysteries of life Why these our appears change so very much between the ages of and It is more than wear and tear its a process affecting every cell in our body Every day cells clone themselfs in the billion the inside is also copied as old cells die off the new ones take that place The trouble is this cloning system isnt perfect Any imprefections in are also replicated in a lifetime we make so many copies of our cells that even the tiniest errors accumulate with time Its just like using a photocopier Copies made from copies degrading quality In our face we have totally replaced the bone every years since we were born Our year old face is copy of our babys face The imprefections get exaggerating with each copy so by the time we reach old age our face looks very different indeed Another cause of aging is in the very air we breathe We need oxygen to live But throughout our life it is slowly poisoning us inside each of our cells our Mitochondria are like tiny power plants combining nutrients with oxygen they create the energy we need but just like the power plant they also produce pollution In this case the pollutant is a form of oxygen itself the Oxygen molecules change into unstable forms called free radicals Over a lifetime these free radicals slowly suffocate the mitochondria and damage our cells Our cells and become more and more damage and cant replicate themselfs Our body cant repair its organs properly eventually they fail Death like life is an amazing biological process engineering to the cells of the body Just as our the timeline of our development it also puts a cap on how long we can live Each time a cell copies itself behind the tiny piece of After billions of divisions so much is lost the cells eventually lose the ability to divide all together Death is not instantaneous It is a gradual winding down of tissues and organs Its thought that the hearts final pump flushes the bloodstream with endorphins the bodys natural pain killer now starved of oxygen tissues can not function within seconds our brains electrical activity drops within minutes it is damaged irreversibly our Hearing is the last sense to die Even after death some cellsre still alive it can take hours for skin cells to stop dividing And the amazing hours before our last brain cell fires its final impulse there is a sane the life goes on For some of us it could even go on for some time Current trends suggest that children born in the West today can expect to live into the and beyond and Even after weve gone we live on through our left ones Our children and our childrens children carry our genes in every one of their cells They also carry memories of us too the moments they have share from our extraordinary story All journeys must oneday end and what a journey it has be
