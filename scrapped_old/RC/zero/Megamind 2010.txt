to this you ask My end starts at the beginning The very beginning Yes thats me had a fairly standard childhood came from what you might call a broken home Literally broken was eight days old and still living with my parents How sad is that Clearly it was time to move on Here is your minion He will take care of you And here is your binky You are destined for didnt quite hear that last part but it sounded important two one Destined for what set out to find my destiny Turns out a kid from the Glaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea That was the day met Mr Goody TwoShoes and our glorious rivalry was born Could this be what was destined for dream life filled with luxury Apparently not Even fate picks its favorites No big deal much different fate awaited me baby How thoughtful Oh yes Yes saw it and thought of you Luckily found a lovely little place to call home Can we keep it place that taught me the differences between right and wrong Mr Goody TwoShoes on the other hand had life handed to him on a silver platter Our baby can fly Yes yes nothing but the best for you darling The power of flight invulnerability and great hair But had something far far greater My amazing intellect and knack for building objects of mayhem After a few years and with some time off for good behavior was given an opportunity to better myself through learning at a strange place called shool It was there that once again ran into Mr Goody TwoShoes He had already amassed a gigantic army of softheaded groupies He bought their affections with showmanship and extravagant gifts of deliciousness So too will make this popped corn and win over those mindless drones Lights out Thats when learned a very hard lesson Good receives all the praise and adulation while evil is sent to quiettime in the
