My name is Joe Harmony This is my stamping ground m a scout for the Army Had my work cut out for me for a long time Behind that pass there is the whole Apache nation They used to come swarming out of that pass killing everything in sight Then we built a fort Fort Invincible Plugged up the pass just like a cork in a bottle Things was fine for a while But them paches is pretty smart One day the bottle blew the cork plum apart Just as figured Thats Tucsos Hes the boss of all the Apaches the fella that started this whole business You step aside Corporal The Army doesnt shoot prisoners Joe m a civilian Well take him back to Fort Winston with us You crazy This aint no common injun Hes just about as near to a god as a fella can get If you shoot him now things will quiet down Without Tucsos stirring them up the rest of them injuns would get reasonable just as fast as they can If you take him in alive youll have every Apache in the territory coming after him We had three years of this You can stop it right now Well take him back to Winston Joe Suit yourself Dick Come on Lieutenant Underwood Yes sir Detail the men to return to Fort Winston Have them inform Colonel Drumm that were bringing Tucsos in Yes sir And put a burial detail to work want this place looking like a cavalry post before we leave Yes sir Thats all he ever cares about Leave it looking neat Cavalry post Attenhut Eyes right Present arms Send the prisoner over to the guard and dismiss the detail Yes sir Detail dismount tell you aint never saw the likes of it Mike rack that up for me There were million Indians million of them tell you And theyre running through that pass like a bunch of crazy jackrabbits Oh stop that noise And right there stands this fella Tucsos waiting to be shot Just waiting to be shot And what does our captain do He says Men want this place cleaned up and looking like a cavalry post the first thing you do And thats all he said By golly its enough to drive a man to drink This is the last time ever go anyplace without this Did he have any orders to go through the pass or to shoot Tucsos How do know Well if he didnt he wouldnt Orders was made to be broke Rutledge Not with Captain Lance ought to know that better than anybody Whats the matter with Saxton Oh that one Hes tired of tooting his bugle Wants a carbine You should have seen the poor lad up there Shaking in his boots he

these settlers on the parade ground Theyve been coming in for three or four days now looking for protection but its blasted little protection theyve got Were understrength The relief column wont be here for at least ten days Theyre sending men which is enough to handle anything But if the Apaches make a sortie to free Tucsos as they undoubtedly will this can be another Fort Invincible Weve got to get Tucsos up to Fort Grant right away The first thing tomorrow morning Yes sir Have the adjutant write out orders for a detail Il ll leave it in your hands to choose an officer and and have him

Take care of him soldier Yes sir Arent you going to tell me how it happened guess youve got a right to know They jumped us about three hours after we left here Me and them two soldiers only got away cause we was riding rear guard They took Bill alive Me and the two soldiers rode circles the next three days trying to catch up with em He was headin back here this afternoon when we found him Was he still alive guess you might call it alive They was sending him back deliberate as a warning When are those men coming Another week Thats what figured didnt think Tucsos would be sending us a warning unless he was dead certain he could wipe us out Now hes gotta get even with us for capturing him My guess is theyre up there behind a pass beatin their war drums right now Is that a guess or is that a sure thing lived with the Chiricahuas for ten years You can learn a lot about injuns in ten years When do you think hes coming Thats hard to say Might be three days might be less Only thing sure he aint gonna wait for that relief column to get here Another things for sure Tucsos got a look at this place Right this minute he knows our strength better than the sergeant major Let me know what you decide Dick Thanks Joe Captain Lance they want you back at the gate sir m sorry about Lieutenant Holloway sir There wasnt a finer officer We know what he was to you Thank you He was a good officer and a good man And say the Army aint got too many like that Give me a hand with these boots Rutledge If it wasnt for Lance Holloway would still be alive and hed be dead Thats whats wrong with the Army The wrong guys always get killed First time in four days those toes have seen daylight Yeah m gonna miss Lieutenant Holloway Thats a lot of talk Murdock If the truth were known youre probably glad that Holloway got killed It just gives you another chance to apply for a commission ll never get a commission as long as Lance is around And would you say that was his fault or your fault Or maybe they were afraid they might not find another sergeant Shut your mouth you dirty Reb Well ll say this much for the captain He can tell the difference between a soldier and a tramp and if you can do that youre a good officer ll leave it up to you Rutledge You went to West Point And Lance had him kicked out Well is it Lances fault if Rutledge does something and is foolish enough to get caught at it Rutledge must love him He come way out here to serve under him Sure thats what it is love Youre all sore because he knows you for what you really are bunch of fleabitten bellyachers And you talk about bellyaching What did you do when the captain took away your liquor ration What did do Well quit drinking m just wanna ask you one question Suppose you found yourself in a dark alley one night with Captain Lance What would you do What would do ll tell you what d do d sneak up behind him and d put up my hand and grab him by the throat and d whirl him around and d say Captain have you got a drink on you Spit and polish thats all he is If it aint in the books its wrong Get him in a bad spot and hed run Yeah run just like a dirty Reb You no good dirty son of a Yankee mule Come on down Rebel came out here to fight injuns not sergeants You come out here because you were sent from a Union prison Well what about it Then you deserted after you got here Youd still be running if Lance hadnt have caught you and brought you back Thats right would Are you coming down Rebel got no call to fight with you Sergeant What gotta drag you down Let it alone Murdock Leave me up on my feet Why dont you get up Onstot Murdock you wanna twist somebodys leg aint occupied for the next few minutes Use mine If Lance had hung you could forgive him a lot Kebussyan Wheres that Arab The captain threw him in the guardhouse Aint you heard him yellin No aint The crazy gorilla He cant stand the guardhouse Just makes him crazier Burial formation for Lieutenant Holloway in minutes Any man missing gets three hours latrine duty You got it Yeah sure Sure All right hop to it Load Aim Squad Fire Aim Squad Fire Order arms Man dieth and wasteth away Yes man giveth up the ghost and where is he Though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground Yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a plant As the waters fall from the sea and the flood decayeth and dryeth up so man lieth down and riseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep All right Lets take Harmonys word for it Lets assume Tucsos is going to attack That means hell do it before the relief column gets here And that way we dont stand a chance Before he attacks hell have to assemble west of the Flintheads That means hell have to come through the pass to get here so d like to take a patrol out to Fort Invincible and try and hold him off up there No cant spare you Richard and cant spare the men only need a small patrol six or seven men Six or seven men Tucsos will have hundreds He can still only get through that pass a few at a time It didnt look so invincible last time you were up there did it The way figure it you can hold Invincible with a small party but only for a short time If can hold Tucsos off up there until a relief column gets here well be out of trouble What about the water supply up there Well we can carry enough to last two or three days If were up there any longer than that we wont be needing any When would you want to leave Right away Tomorrow morning All right Richard guess its that or nothing ll give you the best men left on the post d rather pick em out myself sir Certainly take anyone you want Have the adjutant write out the orders Thank you sir want to apologize for my attitude last time we spoke wasnt

Rebs dont need water anyway Give me some of that horse water Yeah Come to think of it it ought to suit a deserter What about the extra canteens Captains saving them for tomorrow Sure aint saving us Dont it seem funny to you theres no news of Joe Harmony Nothing seems funny to me Its because you got no imagination Maybe you got enough for both of us Maybe have Got enough to be nervous anyway Hows the Lieutenant How do know He put me out there to die Thats why he gave me the carbine Stay where you are Whats the trouble Captain Somebody fired a couple of shots in here It was not effendi have no carbine Are all the others accounted for As far as know sir Well check on it Yes sir came to watch over you effendi see no harm come to you That was very thoughtful of you Everything all right up at

hold of finally got a hold of it Tucsos knows everything Hes in no hurry Dick It makes no difference if the relief column does come Yes Joe Because he knows the whole relief column was made up of only men Just men All right Kebussyan For the moment think we can assume that by this time tomorrow some of us will be dead never permitted men to risk death in a combat detail under my command without explaining why Also d like to straighten out any misapprehensions you may have as to why you were picked for this detail In each case my only consideration was the defense of Fort Winston The fort is undermanned and picked the men that thought could best be spared m prepared to give you my individual reasons if you want them If not the detail is dismissed Very well Sergeant Murdock As for you your record as a noncom is full of nothing but bullying and brutality Thats why you havent been offered your commission The result is youre a malcontent Your absence from Fort Winston is no loss Yes sir Trooper Onstot a man who will desert once is a man who will desert again given the slightest opportunity Here there wont be any opportunity The desert would be a much worse enemy for you than any Apache you might have to face Trooper Rutledge you came miles to serve under my command with only one motive Revenge With your intelligence and your training you should have been promoted many times But your record shows nothing good or bad At Winston they need men who are more than adequate Yes sir Trooper Kebussyan the reason for your presence on this detail wont be found on any record book Its impossible to transcribe the feelings that a man carries in his soul Here the dark thoughts that you carry will be less harmful dont think any other explanation is necessary No sir Trumpeter Saxton you have long and publicly made known your wish to trade your trumpet for a carbine Last night gave you one However both you and know that youre a coward and have no such wish No sir Corporal Gilchrist yours is a record of drunkenness brawls and destruction of Army property that is unequaled in the United States Cavalry Somehow youve managed to keep your stripes But in the event of an attack on Winston the proximity of the forts whiskey would see you end up inevitably in front of the firing squad Youve omitted me in your analysis Captain Your rank entitles you to privacy Lieutenant wish to know why was included in the detail Very well Youre here Lieutenant because youre an extremely ill man needed an officer There was nothing to lose by selecting an off You see what mean Any questions Yes sir What is it m sure we all appreciate having our little faults and weaknesses pointed out to us sir But imagine the captain has a reason for being here too You think so Yes sir think so We all think so And just to even things up a little bit d like to have the pleasure of telling the captain what think that reason is Go ahead You were supposed to take Tucsos up to Fort Grant but you had the orders changed Lieutenant Holloway went out and got himself conveniently killed in your place Then you began to feel guilty about it so you figured out a suicide mission and fixed it so you could take every one of us that you hated along with you Thats all Captain Thats the way it is So thats the way it is Yes sir Detail Tenhut Dismissed Rutledge Yes Captain You disappeared for a while last night Where were you went down to the corral to take a look at the horses Youre lying arent you Thats an enlisted mans privilege Captain Any sign from Onstot No sir He hasnt showed himself for about minutes You better go out there and see if hes all right Yes sir You think you can handle a carbine now without getting careless think so sir Here Thank you sir Captain Dont get any No Do you want to know why No Indians are on the other side of the wall Corporal Why didnt you shoot you fool thought better of it Shoot him wed all be done for Hes the only man can keep this outfit going Where are you Onstot This is Murdock Five years ve been in the Army and get captured on account of a dirty Reb Captain What is it Theres Murdock coming back Wait a minute Captain Thats Murdock No trooper ever carried a carbine that way Therell be coming now Fire at will Hold your fire Let them carry back their wounded Winters do you know the trail to Arahawa Rim do Yeah Yes know it Why Well as near as can figure it the relief column ought to be at the Rim sometime tomorrow want you to ride out there and tell Captain Conrahan to get here as fast as he can Do you really mean that just said it didnt You might be dead when get back ll take my chances on that How do you know d ride to Conrahan How do you know wouldnt ride for the fort It would solve all my troubles you know Yeah know And also know that whatever your faults are youre still an Army man You can take my horse if you want to No thanks got a good one Good luck Dick Good luck to you Jerry How big a column does Conrahan got men Nice round number Cease firing All ready Captain Kebussyan open the gate You all right Saxton Yes sir Fine sir d like to try to get through sir Arab what do you think about when youre thirsty Water Water Sometimes melons Youre a great help a great help Gilchrist Yes sir Sometimes blood You got a cigar Corporal Sir said have you got a cigar Yes sir in my saddlebag Go get it And take the pennant off the guideon and put this on it Well sir youre going to surrender No Corporal Were going to have a little talk with Tucsos But whats the cigar got to do with it You just go and get it and youll find out And take that pistol off your belt Yes sir charge of dynamite is under the rocks All you have to do is light the fuse with your cigar when give the signal Yes sir If you have any trouble call my name out once then get back to the fort immediately Yes sir Time short hard one Why you come out under pale flag came to offer you a chance to surrender You have strange courage dog soldier Do you command mighty party that you can speak such words Or is it because you think no army but your army no warriors but yours By waiting half day capture your men with bag of water Your warriors have great thirst hard one My terms are simple Your men will lay down their arms and come through the pass on foot Scout send back to you he able to speak before he die He spoke Still you make terms to Tucsos You heard Help you have sent for will do no good and men Our chieftains have promised men It is not their way to promise much and send little know what say is true Youre a liar There is no more to hear Wait do not speak foolishly or surrender have brought with me strong medicine medicine that will make these mountains tremble and leap from the earth can destroy this pass and all of your warriors with it Watch You will see All right Corporal Captain Lance Very well Corporal go back to the fort This medicine is controlled from the fort Soon you will see You lie hard one Your medicine fail You who know all things know nothing Tucsos is growing old and foolish No more time for talk dog soldier Return to fort soldier With no water you will soon be as dust under hooves of our horses What happened dont know Captain The fuse was gone and that little cap thing too Somebody tampered with it Thats what d say Looks like the fuse was gone out of that demonstration charge Thats funny could have sworn put it in Makes me wonder about the charge up in the pass Maybe the fuse is gone out of that one too Well Captain why dont you take a run up there and see Why did you do it Rutledge Were all of us caught up here together Where did you expect to go With you Captain And just remember this m not committing suicide m killing you No Rutledge you are committing suicide because m going back up in that pass with a new fuse the first chance get and blow it skyhigh And whatever you think didnt bring this patrol up here to get every man killed m going to get out every one alive that can and especially you Rutledge m going to get you back to Winston and have you courtmartialed m going to have you hung with the strongest length of rope in the whole New Mexico Territory Allah Leave it alone Leave it alone ll need some bandages from my quarters Yes sir This what you wanted Captain It was in Rutledges pocket Yes exactly what wanted If can reset these fuses this mission may still be a success Judging from the ruckus hear out there our red brothers are too busy at the moment to pay much attention to us ll need somebody to cover me ll go Captain am ready effendi No you cant go with that shoulder Kebussyan will not let anyone else go All right Come on Before they kill me d like to get my hands loose for just five minutes Yeah it looks like youre gonna get your wish Reb You always had me tired with your dirty Yankee stripes Why you fight so soon before you die Because hes a no good son of a Yankee mule Your hate is strong dog soldier Yeah Turn me loose and ll show you how a dirty Yankee soldier oughta die ve waited a long time for this Sergeant Just dont run away Rebel Kebussyan Hurry Hurry effendi Go Go effendi Saxton anything moving No nothing Everythings quiet Captain Well Corporal looks like they cut us down a bit Yeah kind of figured they would Next time they come theyre gonna cut down the rest of us Looks that way dont it You tried to shoot me didnt you Sir Aimed your carbine at me the other night Well guess got nothing to lose now if admit that that idea might have flitted through my head a little Why didnt you do it cant rightly answer that Captain Unless Unless maybe got the sudden notion that it might kind of spoil things for you not going down in the line of duty which youre so fond of so to speak No Youre a soldier Gilchrist professional one You may be creations worst mule son of a soldier but thats what you are Thats why you couldnt do it knew that Thats why didnt have you shot five minutes after saw you point the muzzle of that thing at me You couldve had me shot for what did to them canteens Well In both cases didnt have enough men for a firing squad anyway knew that Captain Meanwhile wonder if youd do something for me Anything you say sir Down in my quarters youll find my loose tobacco and cigarette papers m not quite certain where left them but they might have been under one of those canteens you understand need a smoke
