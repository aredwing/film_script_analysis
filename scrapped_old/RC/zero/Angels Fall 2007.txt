restaurant that got shot up in a spree killing Shes the only survivor Jesus Lead investigator said he stayed in contact with her for almost a year but then she disappeared Obviously its something she doesnt want people to know about When people go through a trauma like that they Hallucinate Well no but they react in ways we cant understand So you think shes lying about the murder No No absolutely

before in Boston No wonder you ran away Nice job LindaGail Why What did say So who knows Now how d approach that question is who doesnt know So guess then they also know that Rick didnt find a body yet Doesnt mean he wont think whats got most people concerned me included is how youre doing wish youd told me about Boston Its not something like to talk about Fair enough You leaving town now m a stubborn bitch most of the time but know damn well what its like to pick up and leave a bad situation It takes time to find a place of your own How did you know Angels Fall was yours didnt It was just

just scared Its all happening again What is Lost time Doing things dont remember Like last night packed up everything but didnt go anywhere m sure thats a big minus on my mental health chart but

Didnt run yesterday Didnt run today Thats big for me Good girl Yeah So have something to tell you started your book like it mean like Jack the screwup And hope he doesnt end up dead you know cause m

Oh God Oh it wont come off Come on It wont come off Its not coming off Reece Reece Its happening all over again What is This Doing things dont remember like food in the closet Packing Reece when did this start happening After the murder It started happening right after the murder Just like after the shootings need need to get back to the hospital You just need to calm down No No No This is what crazy people do Youre not crazy Youre not You didnt do this Yeah then who did Someone who wants you to think youre crazy What is this Scotch Drink it Oh Okay who would want to make me think m crazy And why would someone want to do that to me You ever seen the movie Gaslight Oh this is why m attracted to you m regressing to a fugue state writing all over my apartment and you mention a yearold movie Is that a yes Charles Boyer tries to drive his wife Ingrid Bergman crazy Does that sound familiar But why Who would be the most invested person in wanting you to seem crazy Who would want the whole town not to believe a word that you say dont know How about the killer Come on crime of passion is committed in the wilderness where no ones supposed to see it but theres a witness Then all the way across town the gossip starts The witness has a history of psychological problems caused from a previous violent crime But damn if she isnt plucky She insists she saw something So if youre the killer you got to make it seem as though shes lying or nuts Why not just kill me Cause if you end up dead then everyones got to take you serious Its better to push you into insanity have everyone doubting you You actually make it seem plausible But wait theres more The map the shoes in the refrigerator the things on the wall no one else was supposed to see them They were intended for you and for you alone You know think its easier to believe that m relapsing than to try and swallow your mystery writer plot You dont make anything easy Thats an odd thing to say to a woman whos been trying to survive woman who survived after all her friends were killed She was left in the dark bleeding to death Everything was taken from you for no rhyme or reason Its a miracle you have any shred of sanity So stop feeling sorry for yourself Start fighting back dont know how Youre one of the strongest people ve ever met Thank you Brody painting your apartment How do you know these things Well Mac came in for a cup of coffee Said he saw Brody filling up for gas on his way to get paint Now Brodys car is out front Okay Hes doing me a favor Dont recall Brody doing the same for any other woman You

So you had an affair with a married woman It was all so mysterious Shut up LindaGail month ago he disappeared for days Then as fast as it started heard it was over No name no details whatsoever Except someone saw them riding horses across the river once Brownhaired girl What you laughing at Pete Huh Nothing It was a mistake LindaGail The affair or getting caught So what happened to the woman Guess she got saddle sore Something like that Hey Hey Wow Its Its blue Youre a regular Van Gogh Well it isnt blue actually Its azure Its the color of the Caribbean Its soothing Its warm Its calming Youre a very odd man But thank you That was sweet ll meet you back at your place Where are you going If someones trying to do this to me hes not gonna be stopped until hes found and shes the key to getting him So youre gonna put those up No m getting a facial So does everyone in town know ve been in a psychiatric hospital Pretty much And now they think m imagining seeing someone killed Not everyone Hey

paint all over and he siphoned the gas out of Brodys car And he put all those s on the photographs Actually did that Before see your point Thank you Sorry scared you Reece Are those the pictures Theyre not easy to look at so take your time She was in the woods for a couple of days before the kids found her day or two Its been weeks since she was killed Thats if she was killed the day Reece saw her She could have been taken some place killed later She was younger Reece you were a long ways away This is not her Its not the woman saw killed heard about the woman they found With your history it must be a little rough on you lot rougher on her d say At least you know they found her It isnt her Have you ever tried aromatherapy Cause nothing soothes me like a little lavender oil after a hot bath m sure it would help with the confusion Anything else Reece think ve had about all can take Lunch is slow Take your break No owe you time Plus were low on potato salad You know Joanie we should really use some fresh dill Customers dont give a rats ass about fresh dill Well they should And you should No were in the makedo business Not makebetter makedo Oh m tired of settling for

too Lo had an affair with a married woman and it ended badly Doesnt make him a killer What about the hat Everyone in town has that hat Okay After the killing he wasnt as nice to me Okay ll chalk that one up to being the town loony But theres still the fact that saw Lo cleaning out one of Joanies cabins And even Rick said it You know the killer might have put the woman somewhere Maybe Lo took her there and then cleaned up all the evidence Okay what if it was Miss Scarlet in the library with the candlestick Its not Lo How do you know know Lo know Lo Reece Reece Hes out there Who Reece Hes out
