done and Peyrac was taken through tunnels to the Seine Trustworthy soldiers put him on board a boat headed downstream out of Paris gave Peyrac back his life but not his freedom When he realized he was being taken into captivity he took advantage of a momentary lack of attention to attempt to flee Joffrey alive He is free No The strong currents carried him away His body was found and identified the
