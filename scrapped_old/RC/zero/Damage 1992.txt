breakfast together d like that Youd like it if we lived in the same house read the papers together What would you gain if you left Ingrid d gain you Youd be gaining something you already have When can you see me Thursday Thursday at five oclock feel very optimistic about these new developments We set some new targets in the area of industrial waste These are not just talk These are targets which are sensible and realistic Are you saying that some serious commitments actually emerged from the Brussels talks Brussels was good It laid out a European agenda We have to face the fact that toxic waste is no respecter of national frontiers Problems such as acid rain ocean pollution the diminishing ozone layer cannot be tackled by one country on its own There must be cooperation between the member states of the community Are you really trying to make out that for once Britain isnt dragging its heels dont think we ever were Its an image we became saddled with but when is an image ever the truth That was pretty good Dont tell me you were watching Of course never miss a performance You are extraordinary So are you Its a real gift Being good at things Somehow remember what first saw in

like Thank you wont intrude any longer m sorry didnt mean to bust in Not at all Very nice to meet you Nice meeting you hope we all see you sometime Thank you for the book What was that all about Who is that man was with Peter the night Aston died Peters someone ll know forever Our parents were friends Wed had the same life One evening he took me out dancing was Peter brought me home in his car and he started to kiss me didnt know Aston was watching Aston was watching from a window upstairs When went in he started to go mad Youll let him fuck you Theyre all going to he said Its the end for us He came to my room He wanted to sleep in my bed All knew was had to get him out locked the door heard him outside He started imploring me begging me saying he was sorry would forgive him just listened For hours listened Then it stopped went to sleep Next morning woke and heard crying went down the corridor They all told me not to go in but did and saw Aston Hed cut his wrists took his head in my arms His face had been under the water and the water was red They said we had to leave They took me and my mother to stay with Peters parents They wanted us out of the house Peter was waiting He took me upstairs My nightdress was still covered with blood It was then had to knew had to asked him to fuck me Fuck me said Its all right dont mind her being there really dont mind Its just wish

surface of things Everything was fine no questions It isnt healthy Thats all m saying Its not a big issue But its good to have roots But roots arent that great unless something else comes with them

morning sir Do you know what think of that Sir before we start d like to apologize This is supposed to be a final draft a ministry position paper and its full of major factual errors But what really
