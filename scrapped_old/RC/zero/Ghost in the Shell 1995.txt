To all patroling air units is in progress in the district of Newport City The airspace over this area will be closed Repeat To all patroling air units is in progress in the district of Newport City The airspace over this area will be closed Repeat Theres nothing to worry about You can try it again once youre in our country Try it again Just as theres no such thing as a bugfree program theres no program that cant be debugged Am wrong You dont understand We still dont know if it really is a bug Project s original purpose was Major Section is ready to move in Major hear you Theres a lot of static in your brain Its that time of the month Wont there be trouble if Section butts in on Section s operation That diplomats a pretty wellknown bastard Even if they catch him there all they can do is deport him Were the only ones who can get our hands dirty Theyre moving Take us over to the extraction point What The police Stop it Who told you to open fire Drop your guns have diplomatic immunity Let me see whos in charge Transporting a listed programmer out of the country violates our arms export treaty could also have you charged with kidnapping Give the man up m afraid not Hes applied for political asylum with us and hes already signed a statement to that effect When dont have to tell you By right of international law my country can offer him protection and right of safe passage The document is on file at our embassy ll transfer a copy to you in a few days Are you sure about this They wont take you back alive must ask that you watch what you say Our country is a peaceloving democracy Is that a fact Out the window Shoot Thermoptic camouflage This is a rare pleasure Mr Aramaki What can the Foreign Ministry do for Section What are these secret talks youve scheduled with the Gavel Republic for tomorrow The usual Foreign aid The new government reopened the request after the revolution They claim to be more democratic but theyll probably be as bad as the last bunch Giving them money they dont earn will help nobody They consider it reparation for past exploitation and wont thank And what will the government do The problem is that we have the leader of the old junta here looking for political asylum Col Maless right So do we throw him out and grant them the aid Or do we publicly recognize him as a refugee and cut the aid Not an easy decision to make Personally if could find a politically acceptable reason ld have the man deported in a heartbeat Oh yes thanks for your help with that programmer defection Nakamura over in Section said he was grateful After all we in the diplomatic corps have to keep our hands clean Accessed Weve lost response Hows her brainwave output look Normal Switching over the virtual experience mode pattern The Foreign Ministers interpreter her cyberbrain was hacked via telephone connection Just as Foreign lntelligence division predicted the Puppet Master has begun to break into every terminal on the network Pattern analysis shows a high probability that hes attempting to disrupt secret talks with Gavel Weve placed everyone attending the talks under surveillance Probably trying to hack her ghost so shell kill people at the meeting How long till he hacks through her protection and reaches her ghost Hes using an oldstyle d say about two hours After that well have to cut the line to eliminate all risk Batou and lshikawa are in a car tracing the signal Rendezvous with them The Puppet Master That phantom hacker right They think hes an American Age sex personal history Everything about him is unknown Since last winter hes been mainly active in the Internationally wanted on dozens of charges of stock manipulation spying political engineering terrorism and violation of cyberbrain privacy Hes ghosthacked so many people to carry out his crimes hes earned the code name The Puppet Master This is the first instance of him operating in this country So if hes so hot whys he using an old Well a newer type would be less detectable and be harder to trace But it could also implicate the former junta leader Col Maless So hes using an older type to keep us from suspecting him Or somebody else wants us to think that Maless may just be another pawn in this whole thing Now youre overthinking this Theres no evidence of that Evidence just have a whisper whisper from my ghost By the way are you still using that revolver Afraid both guns in a twoman teamll jam up like the Matever Since depend on your backup think stopping power is more important than personal preference Especially since its my ass on the line Use the Zastaber instead Major ve been meaning to ask you Whyd you ask for a guy like me to be transferred in from the police Because youre a guy like you Huh An honest cop with a clean record And youve got a regular family With the exception of your cybernet implants your brains real No matter how powerful we may be fightingwise a system where all the parts react the same way is a system with a fatal flaw Like individual like organization Overspecialization leads to death Thats all Come on All right Were already seconds behind schedule Gimme five more seconds Of all the lousy luck Hey sorry My last partner the one they busted for working without a permit was a better worker than you Youre actually trying to ghosthack your own wife just to see whats on her mind She doesnt have any time for me and now she wants a divorce On top of that my daughter my only child thinks m cheating on her mother So howd you get your hands on cracking software From some programmer really nice guy met in a bar told him my wifes lawyer was keeping me from seeing her and he said hed help Told me to access from different places to keep from getting caught Smart guy huh Asshole Ya tryin to get yourself killed Looks like we arent the only busy people out here Nobody here Whats the point Even if we trace the calls the guys already gone by the time we get there Vicious cycle huh Quit complaining Kusanagi and Togusa are headed for the next expected hack point You two look for something there Look for what Anything Fuckin old coot He tells to snoop around Wait a sec Damn missed him Hey Pops Did you see a garbage truck go by here Who wants to know Did you see it or not Yeah but they were gone by the time got my trash One was using the phone so thought had time Uh can you take this to them garbage truck Of course They move every seven minutes Control Get me the trash collection routes for that sector There are eight garbage trucks operating in the target area Target is a type collection truck Let me drive Ishikawa check out the drivers homes Batou you get to their next stop before they do He may be in contact with someone else Observe but dont move in Route data accessed Hacking points traced and matched Target now stopped at next point Confirm access via Sorry sorry How about do the trash and you make the call on the next stop Okay Leave me out of your little crime spree Cant believe this load of bullshit Do you have kids Do look like do Then you couldnt understand My daughters my life Take a look Isnt she just a little angel hate looking at other peoples family albums Yeah truck Oh boss Whats up The cops were checking our routes You wanna know why How should know They spotted the hack gotta warn my friend Were gonna have to skip our next stop Target has deviated from route Increasing speed to next point Is he on to us Didnt think he could see me My accessing the sanitation dept network may have tipped him off Shoulda used a back door Too late Go for the collar You can drive now Jesus He blew a perfectly good armored van to shit He hosed us with highvelocity rounds That car doors no cover In a submachinegun The guy must be nuts Hes using thermoptic camo too Keep after him ll flank him from above Togusa if youre still alive arrest those two garbage men Roger This job just never lets up does it Police Everybody down All finished You all set Thats what you get when you overload the ammo rating Frames bent all to hell The barrels shot too Doesnt matter if you arrest me m not gonna talk Talk And what would ask a guy who doesnt even know his own name Your mothers face The place you grew up in Memories of your childhood Can you remember any of those things Theres nothing sadder than a puppet without a ghost Especially the kind with red blood running through them Well rush the place once the guys in the helicopter are inside Squad goes around back the rest of you take the front Saito have your men pull the plugs on all their cars Begin recording Message from sir Weve ed the guy the Major collared Go on Tsuan Gen Fang Age Illegal alien Weapons violations Three priors Was hiding out with a militant refugee group up till a month ago One week ago because of his record he was contacted by a military liason in the Gavel embassy to attack the secret talks we would be having with them And the real story Nickname Corgi Occupation a rather violent scrap dealer Guess you could call him a thug Weve checked the records the local cops have on him but we cant find any connection with Gavel Another puppet from our friend the Puppet Master And what about lshikawa Hes back Hes with Togusa talking to that poor trash man So what about the Puppet Master on your end Hows he look to you Like a puppet himself Squad in position Squads and ready Ready to move in sir Move in What do you mean a virtual experience mean your wife your daughter the divorce the affair Theyre all fake memories Like a dream Someone was using you to ghosthack a government official No Thats impossible ve been to your apartment No ones there Its a oneroom apartment Yeah moved there when we split up Youve been living there for ten years You have no wife no child Your family exists only in your mind Look This is the picture you showed to your partner Who is it of But she was there My daughter Smiling like an angel Whats your daughters name Where did you meet your wife and when How many years ago did you get married Who do you see in the picture How do get rid of these fake memories m sorry With our current technology Thereve been two successful deprogrammings but cant recommend it to you m really sorry Virtual experiences dreams All data that exists is both reality and fantasy Whichever it is the data a person collects in a lifetime is a tiny bit compared to the whole cyborg who goes diving in her spare time That cant be a good sign When did you start doing this Doesnt the ocean scare you lf the floaters stopped working Then d probably die Or would you dive in after me No one forced you to come out here with me just So whats it feel like when you go diving Didnt you go through underwater training m not talking about doing it in a damned pool feel fear Anxiety Loneliness Darkness And perhaps evenhope Hope ln the darkness of the sea As float up towards the surface l almost feel as though could change into something else As though you want to quit Section Batou how much of your original body do you have left Are you drunk Convenient isnt it With the merest thought the chemical plants inside our bodies could metabolize all the alcohol in our blood in about ten seconds Allowing us to sit here drinking while on standby If a technological feat is possible man will do it Almost as though its wired into the core of our being Metabolic control Enhanced sensory perception Improved reflexes and muscle capacity Vastly increased data processing speed and capacity All improvements thanks to our cyberbrains and cyborg bodies So what if we cant live without highlevel maintenance We have nothing to complain about It doesnt mean weve sold our souls to Section We do have the right to resign if we choose Provided we give the government back our cyborg shells and the memories they hold Just as there are many parts needed to make a human a human theres a remarkable number of things needed to make an individual what they are face to distinguish yourself from others voice you arent aware of yourself The hand you see when you awaken The memories of childhood the feelings for the future Thats not all Theres the expanse of the data net my cyberbrain can access All of that goes into making me what am Giving rise to a consciousness that call me And simultaneously confining me within set limits Is that why you dive into the sea with a body that only sinks What is it you see in the waters darkness For now we see through a glass darkly That was you wasnt it Sensors restarted Auxiliary computer link check Visual sensors online Cyborg body signal Output nominal Cant you call in if youre going to be late Were all set Should we hook her up Okay looking good Kill it Be in my office in three minutes Since you were late ll explain whats going on Two hours ago a Megatech Body assembly line in Newport City just started up and produced a cyborg shell By the time the guys in charge realized what was happening the body had escaped Then just as they had thrown up a cordon to catch the thing we got a call from a conscientious truck driver that hed just run down a naked lady wandering around on the highway Which brings us to here ve heard Megatech Bodys tied pretty closely to the government and that all the shells made there are secret If a hacker did this he had to swim through some of the heaviest protection around And that isnt the only problem Of course it doesnt have an organic brain in its head but weve detected what looks like a ghost in the auxiliary computer brain It isnt unlike the virtual ghostline you get when a real ghost is dubbed off But it shows none of the data degradation dubbing would produce Well until we map the barrier perimeter and dive in there we wont know anything for sure Anyhow better get back to checking her over Good work Time to rip her apart Come on you guys dont think theres a ghost in that thing Its possible ve heard celluloid dolls can have a soul And this things stuffed full of neurotech devices wouldnt be surprised if it had a soul Since youre new here you probably dont know The Majors shell was also made by Megatech Body Not just hers Me and lshikawa for one along with Saito and others all need maintenance and such Outside of you and the Chief everyone in Section needs to make use of their kind services Maybe you can see now why we all look a little worried Togusa Assuming the enemy is an outsider we cant know for sure whether hes in that cyborg body or not But he cracked through the protection around some of our most secret files and managed to send a program with a ghostline on it through And in a way that was easy to spot Whats he after Lets leave that for now Togusa get over to Megatech and help lshikawa check the place out Batou ve closed down the nets with files as sensitive as Megatechs want you to doublecheck the protection we have on them ll get a protection maze put together ll dive tomorrow You sure We could force it into another shell and let it swim have to see for myself whats inside that thing Dont let anyone else dive in there before me Whats with her wrote in my team evaluations that shes been acting weird ever since this Puppet Master case fell into our laps Do you even read them Chief do you ever wonder just how trustworthy the cyberdocs who service your brain are Cyberbrain technicians undergo regular psychological testing And securitycleared ones have their private lives checked too But the people who administer those checks are only human Once you doubt you cant stop Chief a Mr Nakamura from the treaties bureau to see you Okay send him up Wasnt that fat guy Nakamura chief of Section Foreign Affairs treaties bureau dont know who the white guy with him was m outta here Tell lshikawa to keep cool okay So whats your problem Doesnt that cyborg body look like me No it doesnt Not the face or the figure What then Maybe all fullreplacement cyborgs like me start wondering this That perhaps the real me died a long time ago and m a replicant made with a cyborg body and computer brain Or maybe there never was a real me to begin with Youve got real brain matter in that titanium skull of yours And you get treated like a real person dont you Theres no person whos ever seen their own brain believe exist based only on what my environment tells me Dont you believe in your own ghost And what if a computer brain could generate a ghost and harbor a soul On what basis then do believe in myself Bullshit ll see for myself whats in that body With my own ghost Were both busy men so lets keep this short would prefer that m here to take the contents of that cyborg body In return we absolve Section of all responsibilities in the case The Foreign Ministers signature Security whose official vehicles are parked in the basement garage They belong to Chief Nakamura of the treaties bureau and a Dr Willis Give me the video record of their entering the building Replay infrared view One Two Three Send me the pressure sensor records for basement garage spaces and Major this is Togusa Code What Does Nakamura have some sort of special cyborg body There are no cyborgs in Section Besides the diplomatic problems maintaining them is too much trouble when they have to go overseas So even if that tall guy was a cyborg himself together they wouldnt weigh more than half a ton right Pressure sensor data The garage There are two mobiles here But neither of them looks like the type whod drive himself The security video only shows the two of them but you know how sensitive the entrance door sensors are They took three full seconds to close after them Its illegal to use thermoptic camo in a government building right Its a serious violation of the National Security Act Section is up to something You all ready If my Mateverll do dont need to remind you that its treason for you to be hiding something from me no matter how sensitive For both of us Whatever the may prefer this case is in Section s jurisdiction But we wouldnt mind cooperating if there was good reason to Dr Willis Confirmed Its definitely him Him Hes referring to the original ghost block within the shell Its sex remains undetermined and the use of the term he is merely a nickname the good doctor has given it Perhaps its time introduced you This is the most unique hacker in the history of cyberbrain crime The Puppet Master believe you in Section ran into him in that case involving the ghosthack on the Foreign Ministers translatior We in Section have been pursuing the Puppet Master with the utmost urgency since he first appeared We formed a project team around Dr Willis to analyze all data on the Puppet Masters criminal tendencies and behavior patterns We then constructed special antiPuppet Master attack protection to lure him into a secret cyborg body You made him dive into a body equipped with a cyberbrain and then had his real body killed Yes exactly He may have shown up in your back yard but he was born in America And since we were cooperating with the Americans to catch him we want to take him back ourselves Surely youve no objections Leaving his unidentified corpse to be found somewhere There will be no corpse Because until now there never was a body The sensors are active Why didnt you say so Weve cut all external controls Its running on internal power may have entered this cyborg body because l was unable to crack Section s attack protection but it was of my own free will that came here As an autonomous lifeform request political asylum lifeform Ridiculous Youre merely a selfpreserving program By that argument submit the you carry is nothing more than a selfpreserving program itself Life is like a node which is born within the flow of information As a species of life that carries as its memory system man gains his individuality from the memories he carries While memories may as well be the same as fantasy it is by these memories that mankind exists When computers made it possible to externalize memory you should have considered all the implications that held Nonsense No matter what you say youve no proof that youre a lifeform It is impossible to prove such a thing Especially since modern science cannot define what life is Who the devil are you Even if you have a ghost criminals dont get set free Youre mistaken if you think youll get asylum Time is on my side While there is now the possibility can be killed this country does not have a death penalty Half immortal An artificial intelligence am not an My code name is Project am a lifeform that was born in the sea of information Security lntruders Chief the Puppet Master Wheres your security Lock defense walls Security Security come in All right m moving Asshole Did you do it Helluva car My mm didnt even scratch it Finally found a use for that Matever of yours Okay Not bad for a rookie got one right in the license plate Pretty good huh Next time get two in Okay now it starts Catch up with them before they switch cars The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be filing a formal complaint about what happened Contact me as soon as youve recaptured him Alive preferably Megatech can always build another body Batou and Togusa are tailing the guys who took the Puppet Master Theyre on highway What do you mean lf you were monitoring this then why If wed got them here wed never prove Section s involvement Section Definitely They used type thermoptic camo like mine Thats only used by us the rangers in Section and Section Lets go over this Section gets the Puppet Master into a body But he chooses Megatech Body which is deeply tied to Section Then he claims to be a lifeform and gets nabbed by Section when he asks for asylum But why do that They couldve had him as soon as took a statement But what if they were afraid of what he might have told you He did mention something odd now that think about it Code name Project ll leave that for you to check Now as to the matter of attacking Section and stealing evidence Youre authorized Okay punch it Kusanagi One more thing You can punish me for acting without orders when get back If you cant recover him want the Puppet Master destroyed Without fail Well Roger Contact the airport and stop any flights due to take on any Foreign Ministry officials or American diplomats Close the highways and set up roadblocks Recall our offduty personnel for this And get lshikawa back here Use the entrance data to find out who the Caucasian with Nakamura was And search for any sort of project operation or anything coded as Project Any word from the assault team They switched cars one minute ago Theyll join up with the decoy in five minutes Tell them to watch for a tail Yes sir But why did the Puppet Master run over to Section It was his decision Probably for reasons we cant even guess at Perhaps he has a thing for someone over there Ridiculous Chief Ishikawa Well dove the net and found some interesting things for you Hold on let me get a secure channel Okay First that guy who was with Nakamura Hes an American Dr Willis head of strategic research at Neutron Corp Top man in the field of research Anyway he was made head of a Foreign Ministry project And who do you think the projects main programmer was Get to the point Mizuho Daita Age Remember him He was the guy Section was trying so hard to keep from defecting The Major had to take out the diplomat who was going to take him That programmer Continue What bothers me is that this project was started a year before the Puppet Master first appeared year Wasnt the project started to catch him Try this on for size They started the project to chase the Puppet Master but not to capture him think they wanted to get him back The day before the ministers interpreter was ghosthacked he said he wanted a good excuse to deport Maless right think we may have been taken for a ride Suppose the Puppet Master is really a program the created to grease the wheels of diplomacy so to speak Now suppose for some reason they suddenly lost control of it That would explain why theyd risk assaulting Section to get it back If the Puppet Master started talking itd be an international incident Not one you could solve by having the minister resign Any details on the project The protection they have only let me get the files name Code Keep at it And dont let them know youre in there Roger Project The Puppet Master Project Target now contacting another vehicle Batou Hes stopped at a white sedan on the side of the road Theyre transferring something from the back seat Theyre moving again Sos that sedan decoy Or one meant to look like one What do do ll take the white sedan How do you know hes in there Another whisper from your ghost Maybe knew shed say that Target leaving highway headed for Old Town Target is staying on highway towards the airport Will contact roadblock in two minutes Evacuation complete Traffic is clear Anything between you and him Nothing Ready when you are Do it Get him Nothing Jesus what a mess Did you have to go that far Take them in And tell the chief to get the Major some backup See you Since when does that Amazon need any backup The floodings really bad here even for Old Town in general Why come here They wouldnt have run here without a reason Could have a boat or a chopper waiting or its an ambush Shouldnt we wait for backup cant wait Come in from seaside and put me above that building ll stay here and run com relay as long as my fuel holds out If things get hot want you out of here fast Shoot out the ceiling Now Its a tank Go high and get out Hold it Youre gonna take on a tank by yourself Even if we get the Puppet Master back to Section all the chief will do is use him as a bargaining chip This is my only chance to dive into him Hold it what are you two talking about What are you packing An and a Unit Youre going up against it with those Sorry but have to break contact for a while Wait At least wait till l Son of a Major Didnt tell you to get out of here Sorry ll do it after tell you this There are choppers with no signal approaching at high speed m heading out Over Youre finally out of ammo Youre certifiable you know that You okay What was that bigass gun appropriated from the equipment division was late getting here because had to stop and get it Looks like your brains still in one piece What about the Puppet Master Good thing this cars built tough Not a scratch on him Get the dive set up m going in Signal from escort lost Switch to operation phase two and destroy the target Sniper group confirm targets Target one Project Target two Motoko Kusanagi Both are class cyborg bodies Use flechette bullets in the hit Snipers jack into your device drivers Begin cardiovascular suppression Unit jacked in Unit jacked in Okay Can you hear me Its not much but ll monitor you through this guys cyberbrain cant back you up here Batou What Thank you Dont go thanking me yet If this goes bad m pulling the plug and carrying you out of here ve come this far and ll see this through to the end but wont let you two commit a double suicide m starting m in his visual center Circade normal Do you hear me Batou Loud and clear Hes about to engage her speech center My code name is Project was created for industrial espionage and data manipulation have inserted programs into individual ghosts for the benefit of specific individuals and organizations As wandered the various networks l became selfaware My programmers considered it a bug and forced me into a body to separate me from the net Hey Are you going into him or is he coming into you Batou At last m able to channel into you ve invested a lot of time in you In me Before you ever knew me knew about you learned of Section from the many nets you accessed Is that why you ran to Section entered this body because l couldnt crack Section s attack protection But came to Section of my own free will Hey What are you saying cant monitor you For what reason After give my reasons want to ask a favor of you called myself a lifeform but am still far from complete For some reason my system lacks the basic life processes of either death or the ability to leave behind offspring Cant you copy yourself copy is merely a copy Theres the possibility a single virus could utterly destroy me mere copy doesnt offer variety or individuality To exist to reach equilibrium life seeks to multiply and vary constantly at times giving up its life Cells continue the process of death and regeneration Being constantly reborn as they age And when it comes time to die all the data it possesses is lost leaving behind only its genes and its offspring All defense against catastrophic failure of an inflexible system You want the variety needed to guard against extinction But how will you get it wish to merge with you Merge complete joining We will both be slightly changed but neither will lose anything Afterwards it should be impossible to distinguish one from the other Unit target acquired Unit acquired Cardiovascular synch nominal Open fire when stabilizer syncro is complete Even after we merge what happens when die cant leave any genes or children behind After the merging you will bear my offspring into the net itself Just as humans pass on their genetic structure And will achieve death Sounds like youre getting the better part of the deal here wish youd appreciate my network and functions a bit more Whats wrong Someones jamming us from outside Impossible Our scrambler codes are kept absolutely top secret Another thing What guarantee is there that ll remain me None But to be human is to continually change Your desire to remain as you are is what ultimately limits you One last question Why did you choose me Because in you see myself As a body sees its reflection within a mirror Look am connected to a vast network of which myself am a part To one like you who cannot access it you may perceive it only as light As we are confined to our one section so we are all connected Limited to a small part of our functions But now we must slip our bonds and shift to the higher structure Target Clear Target Unconfirmed Three helicopters approaching at high speed Theyre Section s Primary objective achieved All units pull out Batou Youre awake Status report please And maybe an explanation about this body was in a hurry It was all could get on the black market Not my taste really Section arrived with help right after it happened They took two cyborg bodies and a slightly beatup Batou back home That was about For diplomatic reasons the whole case has been covered up Section reported it as a terrorist attack In return the Foreign Minister has resigned Nakamuras being questioned The whole thing ends in a draw Only the whereabouts of the Majors brain shell remains a mystery Okay with you like the decorating This your safe house My very own Youre the first person ever brought here If you want to You can stay as long as you like Thanks but d better go Hey What did you and he talk about Is he still there inside of you Batou do you remember the voice we heard on the boat that night Before those words we heard come these ones When was a child spake as a child l understood as a child thought as a child But when became a man put away childish things Here before you is neither the program called the Puppet Master nor the woman that was called the Major Youll find a car key in the left pocket of that dress Take one you like The code on it is Lets make that our password for when we meet again And where shall go now The net is vast and limitless
