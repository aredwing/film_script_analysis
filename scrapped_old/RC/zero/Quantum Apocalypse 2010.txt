Dr Zulkowski heres the testimony for the budget hearing As long as the changes were made dont need to see it Did we get the increase in the Mars Exploration Program The additional funding could mean a new structural support hope the White House backs this Whats the status of the comet Dr Sadoughian should have a full report for you Good good Morning Peter Morning Stan Morning Ali How goes it The images from the Hubble were clear as a day enough to do the modeling Good work Close enough for a texture map if she passes near the Rover The comets orbital path travels closer than we anticipated How much closer couple thousand miles Close enough for us to get a few pretty pictures Lots of pretty pictures Keep Senate hearings at a minimum think you should see this Hes talking to you Morning Rhodes What you got This doesnt make sense The comet made a turn turn It completely shifted its orbit Comets dont shift unless the sun shifts Let me see that Switch screen to Rover images Rotate all cameras positive My God Cups of flour teaspoons Brown sugar Nutmeg Why dont you use the mix Mines better But you never made it before Yes have times Hey Dad Good morning son Can you pick me up at joined a new club No Drive your car or ask your mother m not driving my car Smells like mildew Suck it up young man Youre lucky to have any car Whipper snapper Mr President We have a situation Just use the mix Mines better What are you guys up to now Nothing told him to use the mix Clean it up before mom returns Its good Oh What Dja v Whos that Brain perceives events and processes them as memories What did he say Terry have to go earlier today Can you take Sam to the bus please can get myself on the bus Terry Okay Your uncle is an insurance policy can do it myself Pipe down tater tot Wanna go Yeah Bye sweetie Eggs were amazing Terry Better than the mix Thank you What the hell is that dont know but ll find out Wicked was on the phone with Washington and officials are coming We need every monitoring device Every astronomer looking for debris that could be a problem Any aftereffect that could cause a danger The Russians Japanese and Chinese are also on the same program What do we know so far Aftershock and radiation waves are approaching our planet Worldwide problems with devices cell phones satellites Make sure landlines and fiber optic connections are functioning properly We cant tell how bad the impact is just yet Were repositioning the Hubble As long as the System works well pull good results without waiting for the planet to rotate Did you run any debris and impact simulations piece the size of a house would impact at km per second Thats big enough to destroy any major city Rhodes Were missing the point comet just slammed into Mars The debris is likely to enter the Earths gravitational pull and cause a massive extinction m trying to find a solution What is not clear to you Rhodes What caused the comet to change course Something out there is capable of altering the path of a fiftykilometer body This comet reaches its perihelion every years Whats out there that wasnt there years ago Nothing is worse for your rep than driving a stinky car When get out smell good You dont smell like cheese Cause you do a little bit It never stops Oh crap Theres Lindsey New girlfriend Let me see Dad stop stop Can you just pull forward Youre the man Just pull forward mon Leo gotta get to work Get out get out Just please pull forward ll tell you when they turn Okay You ready Go Dad Dad you swear Youre gonna lose your window Lindsey Be good Anyone home Samantha why arent you at school Did you miss your bus Terry says the bus isnt safe What Said it made a strange noise Timing chains sounded off School bus needs repair He can teach me more in a day than they would in school Thats a very sweet offer but Sam has to go to school Grab your stuff m taking you Go go go Good morning lady Good morning Mr Mayor Is that for me The economic development plan Which has made me look smarter than am hope tried Just give me the final final We covered the main points and trust you with it ll work on it See you at the council meeting Okay And then well go in with it Thanks Erica Youre welcome Morning Roz Morning Ben Anything pressing before the council meeting People want to know why the sky is freakydeeky Did you see that Mr Dudley thinks theyre aliens Tell them to watch Fox and have something on it In this town everybody comes here to solve their problems pledged to fill potholes and lower taxes not handle extraterrestrials ll see what can find out The satellite tracks its orbit updating every minutes The anomaly had to either rotate or move into position to directly affect the comets path Why did it have to move Couldnt it just have been there If the force was omnidirectional it would have influenced Mars or its moons think theres a gravity funnel which exerts force in a limited direction Where did it come from And where is it going We plotted some potential paths and orbits look at it In hours itll exert full force upon its landing In hours itll affect the moon therell be huge tidal shifts Tsunamis typhoons hurricanes And after that who knows Were in uncharted territory here dont know what this is let alone how to stop it The guys from Washington are here dont like living them such news Before the cell phone network goes to shit we should call in the experts who specialize in this What experts We put a man on the moon We need the unified theory We need the string guys Well then get them Do you know where to find them Well compare notes Well get them sir Thats weird Theres never traffic on the Shouldnt take Should take University Whys that Sams bus takes The bus has problems People drive too fast on Johnston We need to put a stop signal Mr Dudley this is the rd time you brought up this issue Theres no reason to put the stop sign there Bring a motion forward next time to lower the speed limit Thats a great idea Ben Thanks Proposed remodeling of the library on Pinhook Theyre here Wanna speak with them first Absolutely Great Come in Hey How are you doing tried to call you All the phones are down You got time for lunch Lets do that Grab a jacket Trish Zane Tom Lively This is Dr Zulkowski Thank you both for coming Weve had an anomaly We hope that you can help us stop it Stop it That sounds dangerous Representatives from the military and the are on their way We hope to have some answers by the time they arrive Well be asking a lot of you in very short a time Anything we can get for you to move the process along name it need some no pencils and some wideline paper No notebook no college ruled Loose leaves of paper Okay Trish Energy drinks and cigarettes Any particular brand Surprise me None of that generic crap They need to be menthol Can you keep the drinks warm Room temperature anyway Please Well have that brought over Thank you Thank you ll have Rhodes here get you up to speed No pencils and energy drinks Is this some kind of joke Those two are the rock stars of theoretical physics out of for proposing theory Her hypothesis was confirmed by research months ago Theyre brilliant Well certainly hope so Go home See your family ve got work to do Besides its the end of the world ll be fine That quiz was a real ball buster He loves springing staff on us m probably failing right now You should sit next to me What does that mean Youre making me smarter by osmosis The tests are multiple choice Yes We can create a secret language like scratch my head the answers if sneeze the answer is need your test results before start copying your answers Make sure youre not trying to impress me Suit yourself but got a secret weapon And what is that My uncle Your uncles a math teacher No Better Hes a savant He has a kind of autism He has no good motor skills He lacks the brain part that filters out useless information Yes he knows everything You lie No swear What like Rainman Better than Rainman would not lie to you Thats pretty wild Well its pretty true Oh man Whats his problem Dont get me started You broke up like last summer Tell me about it right He shouldnt have a problem with your new boyfriend New boyfriend huh Did just say that Yeah Margaret ve seen that face before Another story to hit the Internet What do you regret this time No its not that Well what What is it An extinction level event We have a day Maybe two Before what They dont know We need to get back to Washington Mr President Carson Members of the Cabinet are ready to reconvene Good just told Margaret we need to get back The Secret Service thinks its unsafe for you to fly dont care what they think Were going back This is a national crisis The American people deserve to have their president in the White House not hiding out in some secret location The American people need their president sir The has suspended all travel until further notice Set it up here in the hotel But keep the vice president in Yes sir My God What are we going to do Jumping into a readymade family is difficult Can you talk to him Samantha is too young to remember her mom but Leo misses her Hes a great kid but he wont respect me Take him fishing or take him to Hooters do something to get him on my side Well do Well Terry sure misses you Still gets letters from Houston Emails them every day think thats kind of cute Till the Feds send a team to bust him for stalking Yeah He needs something to do We need global coordination want briefings every minutes We have a few hours satellite telecommunications left Then fire up the old Cold War infrastructure We cannot do this alone Mobilize the National Guard We need to maintain law and order want every governor kept in the loop as long as possible There is no plan for any of this We need to act from our gut and just hope and pray we made the right decision Please dont sit there Please use a chair Youll mess up the sheets ll have to make the bed Sorry What are you working on have a friend Reflex He works at the Space Agency wanna work there and use my computer Those guys have computers even better than yours No has a superior operating system Lynne and wanna give you some stuff to do around the house Maybe work on getting you your drivers license dont wanna drive Youd make a great driver d make an excellent driver Other drivers are bad You have a point wanna work there The Atlas Space Agency They need me know you do Well talk about this again tomorrow Okay Bye Love you love you too Leo said the Internet was down rerouted my terminal through another terminal It works Good thinking My talk with Terry went bad Well as usual Its like talking to a wall My dad was frustrated with him Like father like son m not frustrated hes frustrating Its like having another kid Were doing with the other Should we send him for treatment No he belongs with his family Putting him in a nut house isnt doing him any favors Who talked about a nut house Thats where those centers are Hows your blood pressure dont wanna tell you Sweetie over Still pretty high ll call the doctor tomorrow and adjust my meds We determined that what you say is not only unlikely The clearance process for people who are already working on this is underway but obviously we cant wait ll inform our team in Washington Okay As long as theyre the best Sorry for the interruption General Rodgers Ms Taylor Greetings Hello Ms Taylor please take a seat General over here please Thank you Stan Any updates for us Update Like what Whats the situation Right Of course We worked on some calculations Thanks for getting so much time Thats what we came up with sir General General Super cool suit by the way What we came up with is that we are screwed One hundred per cent It might not be that bad Might not Really Go on To minimize its impact we need to identify it Know exactly what it is It takes scientists decades to work this stuff out All resources of the govt are at your disposal Until all the satellites go down all the power is gonna go Could it be a sort of weapon Al Qaeda Possibly the Chinese No This is an incident to remind us how insignificant we are in the universe You have a name for it Yeah Nothing Down since yesterday dont think so If your cell phone doesnt work you can use mine Thanks sweetie Wheres Terry Hes been out there all morning What time He was out there when got up Were taking the kids to school Well see you tonight Theres Hot Pockets for dinner Bye Pumpkin We made some progress Its not progress We just have an idea of whats to come You better prepare Go ahead The anomaly is a gravitational vacuum black hole No thats omnidirectional This has a focal point Think of a flashlight Instead of emitting light it sucks everything in We do mean everything Everything Matter antimatter Light gravity time Hold on Time It sucks time Time is one of the dimensions Itd take us hours to explain Time is a quantifiable object like space Matter And gravity You go It will impact Earth in hours And thats it When it hits us its zero time We are gone We are going down to crunch town Well be done before that For humanity anyway Soon itll exert gravitational pull on the moon and the planet It will affect weather patterns The water cycle will be slowed up water canopy may be created Thick atmosphere keeping moisture closer to the planet surface Weve depleted the ozone enough that its not gonna be catastrophic but its gonna be be rough Its gonna be rough Gravity will be affected and things will grow lighter As it nears the perihelion its gonna create a large vacuum On the st pass its gonna maybe kilometers deep It will reach its perihelion and impact the Far East first Somewhere between Australia And Japan Depending on the time and the exact point As the Earth rotates its gonna rotate right into the vacuum Even if we survive the first days come day three the entire planet will be consumed How good is this assessment This is the real deal sir ll call the president Think All of you Any chance of stopping this thing Thats what we try to do But it doesnt look good You wanna do me a favor and take it a little easy on your mom Shes my step mom And she can take it easy on me Itd be nice if you call her mom now and then Thats never gonna happen Shes not my mom Can borrow a hundred bucks Its not gonna happen Shes not my mom Can borrow a hundred bucks What the hell Remember the girl you saw yesterday at the school Lindsey The clouds part all becomes clear Yeah remember Lindsey want to take her to dinner this weekend Take her to the FleurdeLis FleurdeLis Why not just fly her to Paris You dont need to take her there ll pay you back With what You dont have a job This summer m gonna work Wait Stop the car What Dad just stop the car All right What Whats that You see that Have you ever seen that No Never Hey Roz Another day of weirdness Very strange Any calls The governor called first thing Wants you to call him back Okay thanks Back from the dead Stanley m sure youve come to the same conclusion that we have We must detonate our nuclear assets at the poles to reshape the planets axis This is our only solution This Russian plan is a bad idea Agreed Long lasting effects on the planet would be catastrophic Launching the worlds nuclear arsenal at the Pole to knock the planet off a few degrees sounds genius to me Itll never work No dice Really Never Man no dice you guys No game no guts no game off Who is this kook You cannot smoke in here Didnt you get the email The worlds about to end Dr Medev was Russian cosmologist Yuri Zelnikov think his name is Hes still alive Hes such a hack You know him Everybody knows that Soviet dude We need to tell our people not to go with this plan Rebound That ball Jump Get it Get it That ball Jump Get it Rebound That ball Jump Jump Get it Get it Rebound That ball Whoo Hey Good practice today See you Thursday Of course Bye Lindsey Jump Jump Get it Get it Rebound That ball Stop hate practicing indoors Its so hot in here Whats going on with the weather thought you had all the answers Are you getting sassy with me Maybe What was that So weird Think its a hurricane didnt see that on the news Didnt see any news No Thats true Good point Its a very good point Can talk to you for a second Shes already talking to me But thanks for interrupting wasnt talking to you Stop it okay Really Theres nothing to talk about deleted your Facebook messages Its over so just forget about it and move on Its not that simple Yeah it is Hey Terry Wheres Ben need distributor caps need spark plugs need truck batteries Phone call line Governor No Earl over at the auto shop Okay Hey Earl Your brother Terrys here Hes buying a bunch of stuff Shall put it on your account Well whats he buying Spark plugs and distributor caps The governors on the phone gotta take this Let him take whatever he wants All right Hello Richard how you doing Okay m sitting down We worked out calculations and the anomaly may be dark matter We need the missiles to create a chain reaction to stop this thing The Russians and the Chinese are putting their plan in motion They want the to come on board They say their plan can work They have always been We cant use our missiles We may need them later For what Were working on a counter offensive for when the thing comes close ll inform the president Well save them ll try to convince the Russians and the Chinese that were not taking any strategic advantage by withholding our arsenal Wheres your car didnt drive today Want a ride My dad will pick me up You could call him and tell him youve found a ride but the phone lines are down Hed be worried if wasnt here Isnt that cute Shut up You better dont ride in my car The inside smells like mildew So ll see you Okay Okay Bye All right Bye Your dad could give me a ride Can kiss you mean ll give you a ride While were waiting we could Yeah really like Bet could still pick you up Yeah m not that strong Quick get in Can we give Lindsey a ride Sure lets go Is everything all right Well talk about it Did something happen to Terry No Nice to meet you Mr Marshall Sorry theres a lot going on What was that Looks like an earthquake Come on Is anybody in there Please help me Pull her out We should wait for the paramedics How can we call them Get it off of me Other side quick The gravity Leo Please help me Major damage across the country The polar shift triggered chain reactions Weve got massive earthquakes along the San Andreas Los Angeles San Francisco both badly hit Word about the anomaly No immediate reaction cant believe it all comes down to Avril Lavigne and Poindexter Youd better start believing Find some religion am pleading with you Hey Lindsey dont worry My dad will find a solution We got a call from the governor Theres an anomaly headed our way The gist of it is weve got about hours Our broadcast is now reaching most of the countries We have a little official word from the White House on the last cataclysmic events we expect a news conference in the next few minutes We are getting some images from that earthquake in Southern California Thousands are feared dead In London an earthquake reaching a magnitude of left a wake of destruction We now go to the for a full report Okay Lets do this These weather changes have brought loss of life and destruction to London Citizens are advised to stay inside and await further instruction The will be reporting from Downing Street on American plans to stop what scientists are calling gravitation Lets get to work Lindsey dont worry Dads gonna make sure everythings dont know what happened to my parents want to go home ll get my dads truck ll take you back You gotta talk to Terry ll explain it to him want to take Lindsey home but he wont let me take the truck Why not He says you need it dont need my truck know but need it Where does he think m going He says youre going to Houston Will you please talk to him Ah yeah imagine youre upset You overheard us talking No So what are you doing You have to take me to Houston The Space Agency needs my help The National Monitor Service Weve got tide shifting typhoons and tropical storms over the Eastern seaboard think this is the end Oh Jesus If its dark matter its completely unstable This could double in intensity Not if the math is right We dont have the computing power to pull this calculation off What are you talking about strangelet Whats that cosmology witchcraft Its multidirectional quarks Its a form of dark matter It could stop this thing Strangelets turn every particle into other strangelets It could cancel this thing out At least dilute it Where can we get one Particle accelerator We could somehow transplant it We dont even know if they exist Theres no suitcase for that If it goes wrong the planet will turn into antimatter a big cloud of dust and gas Youre thinking inside the box Keep thinking Were out of time You think this is some game But people are dying tsunami is hitting Manhattan Now get to work Leo Yeah Take her home Well talk later Okay Can he have the keys Hurry back will Come on Whats going on Terry wants to go to Houston To the Space Center Why He thinks he has the solution You think hes got the solution Maybe dont know Your brother is sweet but he has a mental disorder You cant take him seriously What if hes right He taught Samantha how to read And he figured out hot to make a generator out of car parts Remember the story about the bus What if we can prevent disaster if we just listen to him Let me bring him in there Let him explain it to you Thank you Youre welcome Will ever see you again Of course promise Oh my God Lindsey What are you doing Stop Damn it Lindsey Mom Dad Oh my God Justin Come on We have to go Go ahead Tell her think we got it The anomaly is dark matter Its a collection of quarks Quarks are generic particles There are different types Dark matter is formed when strange quarks bond into a new form of matter because they dont decay as they should It creates an unnatural gravity that deconstructs everything Matter is attracted to the center and time slows down Its existence is caused by a variety of factors Random chance really Thats the only way to stop it Creating a dark matter cluster This will cancel each other out Create a wormhole a bridge between the two This sounds good How do we do it We need supercharged accelerated particles The ones at in Geneva How do we get them into space Wed have to move it somehow How much time do we have st wave of destruction in Asia About hours Final destruction hours We cant even get a shuttle off the ground in that time We thought youd say that An option is a nuclear reaction Launched at the right velocity the right angle the detonation could give us what we need What type of device thermal nuclear weapon One thats reliant on fusion Not fission Wed have to launch more than They can collide At the same time We got it Its multiple devices can be targeted separated The Peacekeeper It has warheads If you give us the coordinates we can launch it immediately Thats the hangup We need time to calculate the sweet spot Thirty someodd hours Lets get started We have to try And thats what we have to do dont know what youre saying What makes you think the govt hasnt already thought of this Cause if they did they would have already done it We have to go to the basement Whats going on Tornadoes come on Come on Come with Daddy Here we go sweetie Get in the garage sweetie Quick as you can Terry come on See this Leave it on for twominute intervals How we looking Trish Thats all of it How long According to the counter thing about hours What are the alternatives Its a complex formula that only your computers could decipher It would take me years to solve it by hand dont know if you have enough paper for me to write on Right Okay Youre here for a reason Just keep me posted Leo Come on Lets go Jesus We dodged a bullet Somebody up there likes us You wanted to see me sir Are and radio still working Yes sir want to address the nation Yes sir The Interstates out All the tornadoes and earthquakes Many will try to leave town To go where Well anywhere They probably think its local So rural roads and highways Itll take longer to get there It only took us hours to get to Houston for the reunion Its gonna take more than Havent seen weapons in a while Traded it for a wedding gown Dont forget to take those Youre gonna save the world thats bad for your blood pressure love you love you too See you later You watch your back you hear will Good luck Dad m not gonna wake Sam You better Come on Lets go You have minutes The Secret Service wants to move you to a more secure location No matter how powerless we are we gotta give people some hope Well leave after we get that message out all right All right sir Give me one minute Sure Margaret There are many apologies and thank yous that owe you know ll wait This is one more of those things that we look back on test of our strength that you and me overcome Dont waste all that talk on me The world needs to hear it now Thats why took this job Its easy to forget sometimes Thank you Margaret Lets go get them Theyre gonna make it know Get ready Mr President And five and four Ladies and gentlemen my fellow Americans and anyone who can hear me This is an international crisis global crisis One that no one expected It appears impossible to stop Theres no plan to prevent this impending disaster Weve been caught off guard powerless to the whims of nature My words can only offer inspiration to carry on if and when this has passed To rebuild To aid each other To treat every stranger as a member of our own family This event has shown us that the divisions that separate us be they race religion or status are insignificant We will all need each other if our species is to survive Thank you Good night And God bless us all Cut Very nice Mr President That thing is causing all this Yeah This is bad m glad you get it because sure dont Is it getting much worse dont know Its not good It breached the st safety zone Well feel the effects in hours Come on Where are you going Terry what are you doing Electromagnetic impulse created It destroyed everything electronic can fix it Looks like were walking You need to take your pills dont think its time yet It is What am thinking Glad to see you are okay Wheres Ben Houston Randys in charge till he gets back Houston Yeah Long story Sit down baby Whats the situation lot of people lost their homes We dont have radios Deputies are on foot patrol to see what they can do Anyone on the North Side No We worked our way up south Have you seen my parents No Lindsey havent Its gonna be okay We have to find them Leo My brother must be so scared ll check out the North Side think you should stay here To pass out crackers and waters We can help people At least try to find her family Emergency situation Take it You know how to use it All right was years in law enforcement Dont go being a cowboy All right Just have it in your hand ll be right back know Come on Whats that line by the river Bridge Thanks Bridge is out What No cars for the last miles The bridge is out Damn it Its okay know gravitys screwed up but whats your plan To carry the truck on our backs and swim Its okay Stop saying its okay Why are you yelling Cause youre frustrating Youre a genius but you cant communicate Once there you cant just tell people its okay People have to understand you understand If explain its just a waste of time Its okay You hear that Hold on for a second Somebodys in trouble Stay in the car m gonna see if anybodys hurt Okay Are you all right My car died Can you jump it What are you guys doing Sean Hands down Hes no cop What are you doing here Baby the worlds over Why not party Get the hell out of here This is McGuires house dont care Okay Its my house now Get the hell outta here All of you get out Turn up the heat huh Forget it Sean lets go love it love it You forget about it You forget about it This is outta control Lets go Shut up All the electronics are out We can give you a ride to Houston But your car works cant explain Its funny Sorry man We aint going to Houston Dont do this man You dont know whats going on You dont understand We need your car You wanna steal my girlfriend Dont point that at her Think youre gonna pull a gun on me Calm down dont want You think m afraid to die dont wanna shoot anybody Put your gun down and go You couldnt just leave her alone

No No No Go get help What help You asshole go get help hate you Shut up hate you m taking good care of her Please Leo Leo Hastings Is Leo back havent seen him How long has he been gone At least an hour m gonna go find him Damn it What is it The computer crashed Fix it please please Somethings gone wrong Yeah Terry dont feel good m having another heart attack Hang on Leo Leo have to go inside This areas closed to civilians What happened to him He got hit He needs his pills dont think can help you have to go inside He needs my help Reflex What did you just say Reflex He needs my help have to go inside Whats that Dr Rhodes verbal pass code You must know someone Let him in ll check it out Stop Stop Take him to medical Hes stage hypertensive He suffered a mild heart attack This isnt working Try again This man wants to speak to you He knew your password Reflex m sorry do know you Terry Marshall email you times a week Monday Wednesday Friday have it on this computer Its safe Hi Terry Can talk to you Ross Hes an autistic physics buff He wants to get a job here He shouldnt be here right now Yes sir Uh Terry Yeah Its not a good time to talk Okay All right Goodbye Terry Lets go People have to understand you Nobody knows what youre thinking Reflex youre doing it wrong Missile Peacekeeper Its fusion Its not fission Wait stop stop stop Dark matter is a strangelet Stop stop stop How do you know that did calculations Theyre on my computer What kind of calculations Sound waves Resonant energy Unique frequencies Thats it Thats it We need a monitor No got a monitor Superior operating system Did you get it to them They need a cable Weve only got a cable You did good littler brother love you And Lynne We love you too Mom Mom m so sorry His calculations they look correct His approach is unconventional but his science is sound How did we miss it This is the frequency There goes everything Whats gonna happen With quantum physics and the chaos theory you never know what to expect It could make it disappear be absorbed and do nothing It could create a wormhole That can be used as a faster than light travel mechanism Or a time machine Could we find ourselves on the other side of the galaxy Or chilling with dinosaurs m gonna miss you guys Hes going into arrest Charge the defibrillator Give me the pass Going on Clear Marshall guarantees that everything will be put back to normal Why dont you use the mix Mines better You never made it before Yes have times We need a cup of milk No you havent Use the mix Mines better Careful What are you guys up to Nothing told him to use the mix Pretty good Better than the mix Better clean this up before mom gets home Dja v Can you pick me up at was taking the day off anyway You take the day off Yeah why not We should go out and have fun They must put something extra in those blood pressure pills Not to concern yourself Carry on Oh nice Pancakes Good morning Peter Good morning Stan How goes it Ali The images from the Hubble were clear as a day Enough to do the modeling Close enough for a texture map as she passes near the Rover These eggs are good Hello Hey honey Moms home
