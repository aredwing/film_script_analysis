no right to tobacco Go on Grandpa Please take it After my paper route was in front of Wonkas There was this strange man there think he was a tinker He was standing behind me looking up at the factory Just before he left he said Nobody ever goes in and nobody ever comes out And right he was Charlie Not since the tragic day Willy Wonka locked it Why did he Because all the other chocolate makers were sending spies dressed as workers to steal Mr Wonkas secret recipes Especially Slugworth That Slugworth was the worst Finally Mr Wonka shouted ll be ruined Close the factory And thats just what he did He locked the gates and vanished completely And then suddenly about three years later the most amazing thing happened The factory started again full blast And more delicious candies were coming out than ever But the gates stayed locked So that no one not even Slugworth could steal them But Grandpa someone must be helping Mr Wonka work the factory Thousands must be But who Who are they That is the biggest mystery of them all Charlie Bucket Yes Mr Turkentine need an assistant Give me a hand We have nitric acid glycerin and a special mixture of my own Together its dangerous stuff blows you up But mixed together right as only know how whats it make dont know Of course not Because only know If you knew youd be teaching me instead of me teaching you And for a student to teach his teacher is
