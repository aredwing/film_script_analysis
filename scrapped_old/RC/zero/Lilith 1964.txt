play gin should enjoy playing cards for a while if you have the time Good ll be out in a little while You wanna deal Yes Cut please She plays quite magically She made it herself Quite remarkable isnt

like playing cards anymore ll be back in a minute Wanna play Yes Thank you Thank you very much Vincent Try to get her down here will you Are you going on the picnic May carry it dont know May he Mr Bruce Sure Youre very perceptive m glad you came here What nationality are you m an American No mean what descent are you Mostly English guess Would you marry an English girl mean of English descent dont know m Would you think was Jewish It never occurred to me Many think am but m Polish My grandfather was a priest might get out of here soon m almost well might even get married Should bring them back No Stay where you are unti it lets up He says we can stay never knew you could paint like that simply with grasses and things of that kind They fade but there are no colors like them while they last d love to paint or do anything like that How do you begin What is it that you do dont do anything My hand just moves and follow it Thats it Your hand moves mine doesnt cant trust my hands You must learn if you want them to lead you to things you love No m afraid have a scholars mind not an artists Its a very different faculty you know You have the gift of tongues Thats a great gift But its nothing compared to you ve studied them know the grammar but youve invented one of your own Thats the greatest gift didnt invent it It was taught to me by my people You actually hear it then mean you actually hear them speaking it Oh d love to hear it m fascinated by languages you know Do you think they would speak it to me Perhaps you would teach me wouldnt be allowed to teach you without approval Its a language very few are permitted to speak But what would have to do m sure could persuade them You would have to demonstrate great courage and a great capacity for joy But can But can You dont understand me Eat this then They might make me sick They could be poisonous Dont do that Spit it out Have made you angry Mr Bruce He was right It might be poisonous It wouldnt hurt me if it is You worry about me then m responsible for you Yes then ll be very good promise not to get sick wouldnt want to embarrass you You hurt my hand Let me see You have exquisite hands bite my nails If learned to trust my hands would they really lead me to the things love Vincent come on Were leaving Mr Bruce you havent said anything about my painting Do you know what you almost did What You almost killed a boy How can you let a paintbrush fall yards in front of you was shaking the paint out of it Whyd you make him go after it Because hes a fool If hes a fool why do you lead him on Because m mad Perhaps she was testing him Demanding a demonstration of courage from him Or an act of worship dont know what she was doing If she wanted to kill him why didnt she simply push him off the cliff All know is shouldnt have left him alone Look that was my mistake not yours gave you the assignment You didnt have enough experience yet thought it would be good training for you The hard way huh When brought her back tried to get her to admit what she did It was like trying to get her to admit shes insane She makes you forget shes a patient Yes she does Shes very clever You still want to resign Could it be that youre afraid of failing Do you remember told you we never issue a set of keys to a worker unti we think hes ready If you didnt feel so deeply wouldnt have this much respect for you Hi Hi Have you seen her Is she all right Did she ask about me She say anything about last week havent seen her havent either or heard her playing either You dont suppose shes ill No no dont think so You ought to realize it wouldnt be right for me to act as a gobetween understand yes of course beg your pardon thought youd understand my being anxious do And when see her ll tell her that you asked about her Will you Thats very kind of you dont mean to embarrass you but it means a great deal to me know suppose you think its foolish rather absurd this attachment of mine dont think theres anything foolish about it You dont No Not even under these grotesque conditions No Well still its possible to think of it as a rather foolish thing Shes so proud you know Such a delicate creature And yet she allowed me to touch her hair for a moment You saw that You see really have nothing else to live for Fourteen So many of these people have such extraordinary minds Such extraordinary sensibilities Too extraordinary think sometimes This is not a scientific theory Maybe its romantic but often compare them to fine crystal which has been shattered by the shock of some intolerable revelation have the feeling when talk with them they have seen too much with too fine an instrument That they have been close to some extreme to something absolute and been blasted by it That they have been destroyed one might say by their own excellence Regarded in this way they are the heroes of the universe Its finest product and its noblest casualty Schizophrenia however is far from an exclusive affliction of the superior mind As a matter of fact by using a substance from the blood of humans schizophrenia has been induced in dogs spiders as well as men As you will note the web of most normal spider species is as distinctive and invariable as their coloring But the mad ones spin out fantastic asymmetrical and rather nightmarish designs most unsettling fact Whats that What language is that Its mine What do you mean your own language Why did you come here needed a job You could get a job in a butcher shop Grocery store gas station You were in the Army Were you a hero didnt think so Did you come here for excitement Excitement Adventure m not an adventurer think you are Why Youre ill at ease Adventurous people are always a little ill at ease Theyre shy They arent bold the way people think they are They go stumbling around breaking things being scolded Always looking for a place they feel theyll belong They have that crooked look The crooked look Of not really matching anything d like to go for a walk now didnt think theyd let me go on any more trips after the picnic Well theres some pretty smart people here My people punished me How Whatd they do to you They wept Thats how they always punish me They come and kneel at my bed and sob Have you ever heard someone that you loved weeping Sometimes hear my mother cry Do you Is she unhappy Not now At least hope not What was your mother like Hands lie so still in death Youve killed with these hands Why Thats the business of a soldier You must love your god a lot to kill for him and still go on loving him d never ask that of a lover d only ask his joy Look at her She wants to be like me Shes lovely My kisses kill her Shes like all of them Destroys them to be loved Can go farther Lilith Lilith You call me Lilith Well at least thatll be a very unusual kind of cloth huh You think its beautiful Yes You gonna cut your hair There are scissors there on the table Will you hand them to me Nope You wont Whatll you do Leave me chained here by my hair unti starve Gonna set you free Thatll be difficult This was to be a present for you throw for your bed made it especially for you To make you dream Youre very gentle m glad youre not leaving think you do a great deal of good here think the patients trust you Itd be very foolish if you were to leave These reports of mine are not completely accurate Theyre factual but they dont express what really happens The atmosphere of your relationship is different from what the reports say Right Are you disturbed about it Let me put it quite candidly Do you feel shes trying to seduce you Well its not that simple Well you could call it that But its not Its not just a physical thing Its much more than that m not sure what it is that shes trying to offer Its almost like she wants to share this magic little world of hers And Does that all sound strange to you No that doesnt sound strange It isnt unknown you know for patients to seduce personnel and vice versa unfortunately Do you ever feel inclined to accept Yeah Yeah sometimes do And You see dont really think that Lilith is unhappy Most of the patients are But dont think she is Shes got some dont know shes got a kind of a Rapture What was the word Rapture Rapture Thats a good word for it Yes it is In Shakespeares time it meant madness as the words ecstasy and innocence often did think all of us here are concerned with rapture in some way And when a man devotes himself to studying the nature of rapture he may find himself dispossessed by it Thats one of the risks we take Does she ever talk to you about her delusions Yeah Oh yeah In her case its seldom possible to tell what is fantasy and what is fact Has she ever spoken to you about her family No dont think so She had a brother who was killed accidentally in a fall Shes never mentioned him suppose Well you know never try to question her No wouldnt Thats apt to be disastrous How long did you say that shes been here Since she was What do you think of her chances Very small Still you never can tell Shes been doing very well lately m particularly pleased with the influence you seem to have on her This is a girl that since shes been here has had no contact with any world except her own think youre doing a damn good job Its a very small chance that were talking about You saw Dr Lavrier last week didnt you You talk about me Among other things Whatd you say Tell me You think should huh You think would invent all sorts of stories for him about my childhood You think he believes them Hell believe anything about me except that m happy Its all he exists for inventions and confessions m sure hed love to hear yours What would tell him Dont you know Excuse me Good morning Miss Arthur m making something for you in the shop They told me next week was your birthday and wanted to give you something wonder if should tell you think its going to be quite nice ve been spending a lot of time on it It should be finished in a day or two Are you going bicycling

anymore dont know why was born to do it was born to move was born to be free was born to express to create got nothing left anymore m drained know do know Love it But it seems to me that that love that have can easily hate Destroy because it possesses me Who gave you the right to destroy Who gave you the right to destroy Nobody gave me the right chose the right You have no such right You have no right to destroy the gift God gave you It belongs to us all dont accept that Its my gift do with it as please Who do you think you are How dare you take such a prerogative into your own hands Really Yes Yes You have no right What do you mean who am Who are God gave you a great gift It was for us that he meant it Its for us to judge if you have the right Its not for you to judge anything What you lack is a sense of reality Whats so wonderful about reality Why dont you tell me you love me Why dont you tell me you want me Because love you cant be saved by honor To make you dream To make
