being given the first tickertape welcome in the history of Britain But Steven Shorter is not a president or a politician He is a pop singer The reason given for the extreme violence of the stage act

being prepared is based the sentence he once served in prison And so successful has this violent act become that Steven Shorter now finds himself the most desperately loved entertainer in the world

the commercial purpose of todays advertisement Thats really quite straightforward What weve got is the largest national apple glut ever and unless something drastic is done in the next weeks So the object of this commercial and the others which are planned is to get every man woman and child The winds changed direction Can you move the fog machine down to the water please That is babes in arms and old age pensioners excepted to eat apples a day for the whole of the summer Now Mr Arbutt how would you describe your technique in shooting this commercial Well ve been very inuenced by the work of the Moscow ArtTheatre and certain of our modern philosophers would describe my approach as existentialist Would you care to elaborate on that a little Well for example today the actors must all think apples be apples and ultimately become apples You see one must remember that there are millions of viewers sitting captive in their sitting rooms who are yearning for for the reality and tranquility and the beauty of the countryside Right thank you Dave Head up head up Alvin One more Steve Can you get rid of them please All right fellers Fellers Steve Thank you Alvin Get rid of them Fellers ease up Thats it All right everyone lets have some quiet please Were going to have a few words from our sponsor Our sponsor Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen This morning received a

all going to be apples reckon the directors a bleedinnut Right Standby ducks Stand by swans Stand by early morning mist Stand by Sylvia Camera Mark it National Apple Marketing Board Scene One Take One Running on a Guide Track In this girls ears the clangour of war About her the smoke of her burning childhood Her country has been raped ravaged and rapined We see it in her eyes the ugliness of war Mans inhumanity to man But then a glade a glade of peace The tortured hunted look in her eyes becomes soft Peace Beauty Freshness The soft touch of morning dew The gentle lull of blossom But what is in her basket And why does she stand as though in expectancy Are we eavesdropping on a secret tryst in the midst of war And then a twig snaps in the forest To the minute To the hour Steve has returned Hes been riding for days His eyes are rimmed with fatigue Caked with the dust of war With his own hands he has wrenched open the gates of Jerusalem With his own hands he has crushed an infidel army of He has fought the mighty fight He needs sustenance He needs apples Now we know whats in the basket He wearily stumbles after her his whole body demanding one thing in his eyes a desperate desire She leads him she leads him into the glade of apples It is this that has given him his inner strength Now we know what enabled this man to fight the mighty fight We know what it is that has succoured him what it is that has sustained him what it is that makes his eyes lose the ferocity of war It can only be one thing Apples Apples Apples Apples Apples Apples Mr Jackman how did you manage to get Steven Shorter for your commercial just had a few words with his manager Mr Crossley They must have been very persuasive words Mr Jackman Steve Andrews been very worried about you lately He was saying to me that he thinks you seem much too nervous think hes wondering if theres anything that might be upsetting you Is there Is that why suppose thats why theyve brought you in So they can keep tabs on me Whose idea was that Crossleys suppose No it wasnt Bastard If you and Martin dont like each other why do you keep working together Very simple answer to that as far as hes concerned He takes Youll probably find thats why Andrews What is it Concerned about me Steve what do mean Well you dont think hes chairman of Shorter Enterprises for nothing do you wonder if youd be kind enough to ask Steven to come in think he ought to hear what were now going to discuss Steve would you come in please Are you well Steven Yes sir Good Miss Crawford gentlemen we come to the central point of todays meeting ProfessorTatham We live in difficult times We face on every side the danger of overthrow by the forces of communism and anarchy We must now for the sake of national cohesion and survival lock together into a single mould We must become one unit to resist these forces And to ensure this move we must of necessity subdue the critical elements in the countrys youth This is why we first made Steven Shorter more violent than anyone else because we knew this violence would have a more direct appeal to the youth of the moment Now we are going to use that appeal by changing it Gentlemen in accordance with our planned campaign and because weve reached commercial saturation point In days time were going to make Steven Shorter repent Were going to make him say m sorry for what ve done Were going to make him say Now want to go back into society Now will accept law and order No longer will criticize or rock the boat Were going to make Steven Shorter say these things because we want as weve always wanted the youth of Britain to say them also This is excellent very exciting Now for clothes and new designs Miss Crawford Now for clothes and new designs Miss Crawford August th Item on

the most dramatic changes of popular image ever seen The only problem that remains is will the public en masse accept it We believe so because of Stevens power But to make sure my research team and suggest that when you present Steven in his new image for the first time you do so in conjunction with an Establishment event We have compiled a shortlist from many dozens of applications We have compiled a shortlist from many dozens of applications The Central Office of Information the Board of Trade the Ministry of Defence the British Tourist Board ve sounded out the Foreign Office and

cant reach it There Now can you reach it May the love of God be always with you Amen What you are now watching is the largest staging of nationalism in the history of Great Britain Now is the beginning of Christian Crusade Week and praise be to God Led by a section of the Durham Queens Scouts detachments of Christian bodies from all over the country pulse with eartingling music and breathless precision into an unequalled expression of national solidarity We calculate that the gate money from each of these performances will gross on average approximately The coalition government of Britain formed because of the complete lack of difference between the policies of the Conservative and Labour parties has given both its blessing and a state subsidy to the mounting of Christian Crusade Week because as the official pamphlet states we need no longer have any disturbing political differences When we are all of one faith and believe in one God and one ag This black card will be issued to you as you leave the Stadium tonight On it there are three words They are simple words but they are vital words They are words which we must now all of us begin using because since the end of the War we in Britain have become apathetic slack loose in our morality National cohesion has become unimportant to us We must fight this We must Now all of us begin to use the words on the card We will conform Those are the words We will conform And when say the word conform want all of you to shout in one clear voice in reply We will conform Now conform We will conform Above all we must follow the example of a young man who found repentance who found faith who found God who found all of these things who found the Word And now he is here with you tonight To our shining example To the light To the path To a way And did those feet in ancient times Walk upon Englands mountains green And was the holy lamb of God On Englands pleasant pastures seen And did the countenance divine Shine forth

of fire will not cease from mental fight Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand Til we have built Jerusalem In Englands green and pleasant land Now it has been suggested that Steves song which was specially written for this occasion may have certain autosuggestive qualities to it from which the sick may derive some internal benefit Therefore those less fortunate than us will be brought before Steve in invalid chairs which we shall be providing if may say free of charge see it all before me My past of restless wander An evil heart within me An evil head to hold But in my hour of darkness sun began to shine sweeping spirit moved me shining light was mine see a pasture All green and gold shepherd walking brave and bold congregation All on their knees His arms outstretching To you and me You and me We need His hand to guide us Along this chosen road We need His love to save us And bear our heavy load His pain was not for nothing His tears were not in vain What can a man believe in If not in Jesus name see a chapel High in the sky Someone is waiting tear in His eye see Him calling see Him smile And in His arms little child His door is open To everyone kneel before Him My time has come Father Father Your children call Defend our mothers Forgive us all Forgive us all In one evening in the National Stadium people gave themselves to God and Flag through Steven Shorter Conform We

keep your distance On September th with public endorsement Steven Shorter is barred from this and any further appearance on television just to ensure that he does not again misuse his position of privilege to disturb the public peace of mind The public knows what it feels Its love for Steven has turned to hate That we must accept like an act of God What about your business interests in Steven Shorter ll sever my connections with Steven Shorter Enterprises Do you not feel thats rather abrupt Not at all My main responsibility is to my investors and think it would be quite wrong to keep their money in a concern that now consider to be a bad investment Mr Butler do you think its possible that Steven Shorter could ever win back his popularity dont think so Perhaps in time to come after hes dead he may be remembered with affectionate nostalgia Within about a year all that remained of Steven Shorter were a few old records and a piece of archive film with the sound of course removed Its going to be a happy year in Britain this year in the near future
