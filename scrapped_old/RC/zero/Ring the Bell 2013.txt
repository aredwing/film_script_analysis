with daisy Now that Daisy shes pretty protective of those boys out there Youre lucky you came back with your skin on She was actually cordial ll tell you what man The boys ranch is a special place The Cookes out there give them boys hope and man thats something they dont get a lot of especially Shawn Hey have you ever seen Shawn play in a game in person or is tonight going to be your first time Whats tonight Tonight the alumni game The whole town is going to be there Will Daisy be there Oh yeah shell be there Well then ll be there too Well youre either very brave or very stupid He is no fool Hey Rob Whats that about Well you know us preachers Were always looking for the catchy phrase to get peoples attention but actually this comes from a quote from a guy named Jim Eliot and he was a missionary back in the s He went with four other guys to the remote jungles of Ecuador to try to take the message of Gods love to a very dangerous tribe of natives All of his friends of course thought he was crazy for going to such a dangerous place He was a young guy bright had a great future ahead of him In fact he was a great athlete as a matter of fact As the story unfolds he and the four missionaries with him were in fact all attacked and killed by the very people that they were trying to help So it looked like a pretty tragic end to that story but then amazing and pretty miraculous things started to happen as a result of those five mens deaths Many of the people in that tribe actually became believers and followers of God and some of the very men that killed those missionaries became missionaries themselves if you can believe that and the whole tribe really became a very peaceful and kind people So how do they explain that Well thats a great question Even the anthropologists that had studied this tribe for years couldnt believe it and couldnt explain it So anyway after he died this quote was found in Jim Eliots journals where he had written these words He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose So he is no fool Well guess theres more than one way to define foolishness actually have been feeling a little foolish ever since got to town You know you and everyone else knows why m here but m actually not a bad guy feel really do know whats best for Shawn but m getting nowhere guess just need to spend some more time with Daisy and get close to Shawn Well Mr Decker dont think youre a bad guy at all and in fact think itd be a great idea for you to spend some time with Daisy and with the boys And heres an idea You

dollar bills or not dont know but he knows where it leads and God knows where Shawn is going And with all due respect Mr Decker dont think you know where that boys been Okay what do need to know That young man youre looking at not the same boy that showed up here He was ten years old harder than any kid ought to be at that age He was angry broken Dad left him the day he was born His mom had her troubles Yeah he probably doesnt have a memory of her coming around sober So by the time she was killed in that car wreck the kid was far too used to having to take care of himself m sorry Yeah he hated those words Tired of hearing m sorry for this and that Couldnt hardly say them himself Its sad to see a kid like that So we just had to let him know he was loved and valuable Taught him to trust in God as a good father That wasnt an easy road So when he rang that bell that was something So the tradition of the bell is is what Accepting God Yeah well its kind of our tradition you know but its more than that Its about accepting that God has accepted you So yeah Yeah Shawn discovered baseball here real quick God smiled on him with that as you can tell Now baseball is going to give him an opportunity to reach far beyond that outfield fence Hes going to get a good education Mr Decker hes going to make a real difference in peoples lives m asking you Mr Decker move on Dont interfere with Shawns decision cant believe m saying this think youre right Baseball huh What a game Its a great game Whod you watch growing up Man used to love the Cubbies but will say my favorite team of all time

over mostly third world countries spreading the gospel grew up stealing bases And And Watching my parents live out that gospel You were on everyones radar and then you just disappeared That all depends on whose radar See played all through the mission fields The thing is Mr Decker you could throw a ball miles an hour youre going to get peoples attention when you bring them something more powerful than that Did you ever think of the platform you could have standing on the mound in Yankee stadium Of course all the time still do All have to do though is look out there See Joey Shawn and

Yankee stadium Look at Right beside Shawn every step of the way Little red this is his last stop after six failed foster homes Six He doesnt want to leave They all came here with a lot of hurt Theres

youre running on empty and you cant find the remedy Just come to the well You can spend your whole life chasing whats missing But that empty inside it just aint gonna listen When nothing can satisfy and the world leaves you high and dry Just come to the well Yeah yeah And all who thirst will thirst no more And all who search will find what their souls long for The world will try but it can never fill Just leave it all behind and come to the well So bring me your heart no matter how broken Just come as you are when your last prayer is spoken Just rest in my arms a while Youll feel the change my child When you come to the well And all who thirst will thirst no more And all who search will find what their souls long for And the world will try but it can never fill Just leave it all behind

come to the well Yeah God is good So want you guys to know that before you got here tonight all the tour all the bands all the crew we all gathered in here and we walked through these chairs praying for you before you got here praying that this would be more than just another Christian family fun night Because some of you know as good as do you know a song might change your afternoon but its not going to change your life Its going to take something way more than feeling good and feeling better to change your lives cant live by what feel but live by the truth Gods word reveals And when stand before God one day hes not going to ask me how felt Hes not going to ask me what church went to Hes not going to ask me how many good things do and how many bad things stopped doing What hes going to ask me is what did do with Jesus Because were all in the same boat down here No ones here any more of a train wreck than the guy standing up here with a microphone right now Were lost were broken were fallen and we cant fix ourselves So dont come to a concert and hear this and then think need to go get good and come back to God because you cant Its way too late to get good Yeah ve gotta realize m broken and ve fallen and need Jesus And God says in his word that if we confess with our mouths that Jesus is Lord and believe in our heart God raised him from the dead well be saved Listen confess with my mouth that Jesus is Lord Lord is not a nickname for Jesus Lord means King To be his is to confess with my mouth that Jesus is the Lord and King of my life forever and will follow my King forever and believe in my heart that the same God that raised Jesus from the dead can raise me from the dead Thats so much bigger than trying to be better Its realizing Lord need You m desperate and lay my life at Your feet turn from the sin in my life and m following You to be Yours Thats good stuff You can do that tonight If you feel like youre still on the outside looking in when it comes to a friendship with God Jesus himself said No one comes to the Father unless the spirit draws him So if its even on your mind and in your heart right now to take a step towards the Father please know this is very personal Hes not waving his hand over a crowd right now Hes calling you right now and you can lay your life at His feet tonight Can we just pray together Lets just bow our heads and close our eyes Theres nothing magical about it Were just getting our mind off everybody else and asking God to show his truth for us Father if anyone in here needs You they already know it Youve been moving in their lives long before they got to this room So now that were here it would be a tragedy to come this close to the well and go home thirsty Lord if anyone needs you let them lay their life at Your feet now Draw them to You Guys if youre here and you want to know Jesus just tell Him Say Lord m Yours Take my sin take my junk take all the garbage lay it at Your feet and ll follow You If youre here tonight and that is what your heart is crying out want to pray with you Theres some pastors in the area that have been praying for this event long before you got here and theyd love to meet you down here in the front just pray with you before you go Because as cool as this moment is in here life isnt like this all quiet and tidy while we get our thoughts together Weve got to leave this building

For Scooter and that choice felt more like a calling Scooter was only He had his whole life ahead of him but we grew up watching my parents help people Whoever wherever all the time My parents were missionaries even here This place was their dream didnt know that You couldnt have known just like Scooter and couldnt have known how one moment one phone call would change our lives forever In an instant we went from helping orphans to being orphans My parents died in a plane crash and what could have destroyed our hope in God only taught us to trust in him more wouldnt have known what to do We didnt either but we learned We had to This this place felt like our calling Were home Shawns home And that bell to hear that bell ring and to know what that sound represents to hear what just happened to a heart to know something that that person cant keep to themselves dont think could ask for anything more This place This place is amazing How do you even get by By faith We walk by faith and we pray a lot We pray and we share whatever God provides And He does provide The people in this town they really come through for us They support us And you know you cant be around these boys and not be inspired And that inspiration comes from watching you and Scooter And our inspiration comes from God Maybe thats what it is That concert last night felt something there that ve never felt
