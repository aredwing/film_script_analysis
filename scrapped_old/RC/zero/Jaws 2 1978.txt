half meters Seven and a half meters Correct You better check the bite radius The what The shape of the mouth Whales mouth Sharks mouth What shark The shark that did this We dont know that do we Thats what were here to find out And we will cant hear you if youre going to whisper centimeters have had some experience with sharks Oh have you Yeah And think a think a great white mightve done this Carcharodon carcharias Right What makes you think there might be one in these waters Well its obvious that uh That a big fish took a bite out of this big fish This is a mammal not a fish Dont quibble with me Is it a shark bite or isnt it Possibly Then again this is a killer whale It would have to be a shark of considerable size Look we know that that sharks are attracted by blood And thrashing about And sound Sound Sound like sonar radar They hone in on unusual sounds irregular sounds almost any rhythmic lowfrequency vibration That means that there could be one around Not necessarily These wounds could have been inflicted miles out to sea or more None of them were immediately fatal Currents could have carried the body ten miles further We got a hell of a tide this month Will you just take care of the crowd please Dad Mr Hendricks will you take this down please No more sailing today okay And d like you to come back with me We came out in my boat Yeah but Andy will take it back got

for me to tell when the bodys like this This animal has been ashore for or hours and drifting for a day at least Every little nibbler in the seas taken a bite know that dolphins communicate mean they send signals You dont think that if a shark was destroyed that another shark could could come and Sharks dont take things personally Mr Brody Dad can please have my No Hey look dont worry about it ll
