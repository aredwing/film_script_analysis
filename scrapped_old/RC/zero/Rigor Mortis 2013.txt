that Vampires are afraid of glutinous rice Eh In the old days all successful Vampire Hunters had special relationships with the best rice shops They get discounts for the glutinous rice they needed Rice was really worth something back then Vampire hunters carried glutinous rice with them at all times This relationship was passed down from generation to generation And subsequently to me All the Vampires have miraculously vanished along with all the Vampire hunters So what do Vampire Hunters do when there are no fucking Vampires left They cook Thank you for saving my life this morning You

loves fish How is he Hes good He is coming home should get back to work now Auntie Mui Pak You cant come here anymore Run along now Be a good boy To preserve the body we must choose a dark place within the place where he was last living In order to be discreet We bury his body in soil in the bathtub Later we move the body into a coffin in total darkness suspended off the ground We will use crows blood instead of chicken blood which will work with the amulet on his chest collecting the essence of his yin spirit Clouds of the spirits open against the gods will Remember never take the mask off How much longer until Tung comes back In seven days Tungs spirit will come back It may be the perfect time then May be What if it doesnt work If it doesnt work theres another way What is it Its very extreme last resort We will talk later Clouds of the spirits open blessed by the ashes spirits grant me the power against the gods will Mommy The roast pork is nice They are gone now They wont come back Just walk against the wall at this hour every night Good luck to you Good luck to you Good luck to you Honey The dying plant you brought home last week it blossomed last night Please dont misunderstand m seventytwo If werent looking after the two of them would have retired long ago didnt want them sent away Theyve been asked to leave many times So found them a place to stay Why is that woman hanging around all the time She lived in for years She was reserved and didnt speak much She had a warm smile Her husband seemed like a nice man He was a tutor to two twin girls in the neighborhood Feng goes back to every day She gets scared then leaves and returns the next day She doesnt dare to go inside but she cant stop herself from going back Her kid is a good boy She gathers the food offerings her neighbors leave outside their doors He just gobbles it all up without a word Is the bike yours How about fix it for you Dear you dont like the food You havent touched your plate at all Its been getting windy lately Its harder for me to go up and down the stairs Maybe gained weight Maybe did Maybe its a conspiracy Yau and that fat pig Its a big conspiracy Yes it is yes it is Gosh that mouth of yours Dear we are not young anymore We will be a hundred years old sooner or later If you get cold you have to bundle up Take care of yourself If youre not happy you have to speak

me if did Please dont leave me alone You said you would come back Why arent you eating You dont like the food You shouldnt smoke too much need to get one more pair of chopsticks Take a seat You expecting company Nah just my flat mates You can see them Sometimes And you still stay here Do you think they are all haunted They are attached to the land itself not to the house have stayed here for decades but they have been here for centuries will probably be living here when die It makes sense to develop a good relationship beforehand need your help Its about apartment Do you think any museum will want this stuff Should sell them to one of those places that collects scrap metal Are these things from your father Yes from many generations The brown stains thats blood Its so deep that it cant be washed away No matter how hard tried Back in the days there were a lot of eerie things in my village We took care of them with these tools Where is your family now In this business no one gets a happy end Five hours Five Hours will return before midnight Five Hours Four hours just remembered my father would leave me at our neighbors place whenever he went to work Being a Taoist monk he really didnt earn much The money he earned wasnt even enough to pay the babysitting fees Thanks For many generations my family called wherever home But there was never a fucking home This was the last place my father brought me He planned for us to stay for a few days We ended up living here for decades How come will come back for you before midnight He went out one night and never came back After all its all fate Pak drew this So what did all could the last time If you are scared thats your problem Its not their fault Feng is mentally ill She should go to a doctor After all m just a cook You can help why dont you Why the hell is it your business How do you know can help You dont even know me Do you even fucking know them Cut that shit are you helping or not Are you even capable of helping others Look at yourself Youre a fucking mess Whats that supposed to mean Thats obviously drawn by a kid The inks already faded and youre still keeping it Couldnt let it go could you If you really didnt care you wouldnt bother keeping all these things would you In humans there are both the good and the bad It is with spells as well The darker the color of the amulet paper the greater the power of the spell To ask for power from the gods this way is evil It is an extreme measure that endangers yourself and others Trust me this is not that simple Thank you You son of a bitch You used his life as bait for the twins ve asked for your help before but you refused didnt have a choice might as well have done it on my own You know how powerful those twins are You forced me to get involved At

you get your clothes repaired by Mui Yeah Has anyone seen Uncle Tung lately Nope How about you ask Uncle Yin Feng told me that some guy killed Tung She said that the guy had a lot of kids with him Kids Here Feng is nuts You believe what she says The railing on the stairwell is all bent and screwed up Look at this found this tooth beside it What Is there a name on it It looks like Tungs gold teeth Every night at eleven he opens his eyes His feet bang the top of the coffin As if he wants to jump Did you take off the mask This is normal Dont take off the mask Everything will be fine How much longer do need to wait Besides the growth of his hair and his nails it doesnt seem like anything is happening ve been feeding him crows blood every day Should get some blood from a black dog The blood of black dogs is useless Trust me just go home Gau you said that there was another way What is it Please tell me What need is the blood of a virgin Do you know how to get it Dont draw any attention to yourself Tung will come back for sure Just remember never ever take the mask off Uncle Yin what do you want Sorry to bother you Gau received some complaints Someone said there are kids

Their yin for my yang Its the choice ve made The smell coming out of Auntie Muis apartment was from the preservatives You were in the process of turning Tungs corpse into a vampire The twin ghosts were needed to bring him back to life At eleven every night you must scatter a packet of this onto his body This will get rid of the smell of rotting flesh will come over tonight The twin ghosts are different from the unborn child Two lives as one They are more potent need a body that was big enough as a vessel to hold them If we didnt use the mask and the oil Tungs corpse would have been out of control never thought it would turn out like this Iran out of time Pak Pak Pak Pak where are you Pak where are you Tung was the body without the spirit The twins were the spirits without the body ll
