Presented Produced by a Jiyoung Film th Judge Bongju want you to confess why you overrode the law What the hell are you doing Heres a news fash former Univ professor Kyungho has allegedly shot the presiding judge with a crossbow after losing a professorship reinstatement case in Court The disgruntled suspect sought the judge out at his home and committed a lifethreatening offense against him using a dangerous weapon The Supreme Court held an urgent judges meeting and declared to take severe legal actions against him for challenging constitutionalism and attacking the Judiciary Hey Just pay my outstanding fees for helping you win this lawsuit It took me years to stop the company from firing you Youll get paid when union members are reinstated You might as well join in the fight Lawyers like you should take a stand Its your fight not mine Stop it Just give me my money Mr What Miss thanks for the coffee See you later Union Chairman Mr What is it what fights one thing and paying up is another Our office is really in a rut you know How can it be worse than our members being laid off Awe fuck Give me my money What fuck What did you say What How old are you What How old are you Every goddamn sentence of yours ends with money Whats your deal Huh If youre a lawyer act like one Shit Hey Youll never see a penny until were all reinstated m quitting this shitty job anyway you sonofabitch This case is so high profile m sure other attorneys will be interested That said what brings you all the way down to Changwon Its you whom my husband wants used to be the best in defending wrongly dismissed university professors Especially earned my fame through the Prof Dongho trial And participated in drafting the revised private school law He said you dont care much about what other people say And that youd be a good match with him read about the case in the news But first give me details about his dismissal My husband was on the university entrance exam evaluation team January and can only be parallel But the question should prove how they are perpendicular and cannot be parallel and perpendicular at the same time So this question itself cannot be valid Mo wonder coudnt sove it Who presented this question Prof Prof no need to take everything so seriously We can either grade it as a no score or the highest score You mean we should admit it was an error Our Mathematics Dept will all look like fools But if we hid the truth itll make things worse There he is What have you decided to do Weve decided to create another official answer sheet and regrade the exam papers by it What But that will change who passes or fails Prof You need to put the universitys reputation above your principles But shouldnt the schools reputation be based on trust If trust means so much to you why raise such controversy Prof you need to learn to embrace a colleagues mistake Thats enough Well just close this issue before word gets out Lets do that Right Its just like lying to the students As their professor wont accept this Are you clueless or just too selfrighteous Enough You think a good thesis will get you a full tenure Thats how he became the faculty outcast and the following year he failed to receive tenure That really hit my husband hard He eventually filed a lawsuit to reinstate his position But Reissuing tenure status is the schools right Its the reality of private schools Sonsofbitches still have a hangover from yesterday need some water Please excuse me Hey Why do my hands always shake when m starting to sober up Its so humiliating Honey we can now return to Korea Whats dad saying They passed a new law permitting university faculty excluded mom a tenuretrack to have another chance for reevaluation Look here s Prof Minsu has been reinstated If apply for a reevaluation ll be able to return to my university m not going back Whatre you talking about dont want to go back You were always right but where did that get us But cant you see theyve changed the law These letters of validation confirm that not just local mathematicians but also prestigious mathematicians from overseas also confirm the plaintiffs claims are justified right Yes your Honor So why did he lose The judge graduated mom the same school that dismissed him Its nothing new that private school foundations and the Judiciary are close So you never appealed We appealed immediately and thats where we met Judge Bongju They blamed my exclusion from a tenuretrack on my lack of ability as a scholar Yet they havent presented one single piece of evidence would like you to treat this case strictly by the law Youre constantly telling me to stick strictly to the law which absolutely will At first we had high hopes for Judge Bongju but This is a petition filed and signed by the students This clearly proves the plaintiffs lack of ability as an educator would like to submit this as court evidence Submission permitted d like these students to be summoned as witnesses This is fase evidence fabricated by the school will make that conclusion Therefore there is no reason to overrule the original ruling and accordingly the plaintiffs appeal is defeated Wait just a moment Bongju Wait Wait wait Would you like some water No its okay guess you like to drink Uh yes uh no Anyway ll take the case and try to do my best ll call you when return to Seoul Good day Whys she just leaving Its not a profitable gig for us anyway But its a high profile case Win and youll earn success but even losing will bring fame We probably wont be earning a dime During the

truth and integrity Mr he is the Prosecutions witness You can crossexamine him on matters only related to the case Mr do you acknowledge this Mr are you challenging me Why wont you let me ask

that we live in a constitutional state and that our Criminal Law was made well And that includes our Criminal Procedure Act The law is nothing but crap okay Take a good look at our history The law is

rights lawyer whom the laborers wouldnt hire He was unable to get work and debt kept piling up Subsequently he resorted to alcoholism But why didnt he participate Its not like him He was traumatized by the Bupyong Daewoo Motors protest But he wasnt hurt then Thats what m talking about saw the tapes shot by the labor force media group While everyone else was being miserably beaten and injured he was unscathed just because he was a lawyer He blamed himself for everything He was the one who incited the protest in the first place One day he drank himself silly and started balling like a baby How could leave after seeing him like that And look wheres it got me Do you have those tapes Tapes This is the courts preliminary injunction declaring that all actions interfering with any labor union

trial So would shoot arrows at the shooting field Did you take it with you that day to shoot Bongju You think m stupid To shoot another man like that Including Bongju was determined to teach every foulplaying judge a lesson just wanted to scare him to confess his false judgment Okay Then shall we start Arent they getting hungry Its been hours Want me to ask when theyll be done And get an earful mom that sick bastard Hell be demanding visitation and inmate rights Itll just give you a headache Right Here is a statement of grounds for appeal Okay ll type and polish it up No want you to submit

serve the client Hence you just need to do as youre told should get going Be well prepared and stop drinking so much ve quit drinking wont be drinking until the end of this trial the entire trial will be recorded and dictated Lets hear the accusers statement of grounds for appeal Your Honor as you may know this is an extremely particular case Right as it happened a national judges meeting was summoned There the case was announced as a terrorist act against the Judiciary which declared to take severe legal actions like we all know Even before a trial Dont you find this somewhat odd Furthermore the victims been changing his statement mom the first police investigation to the original trial The Defense wonders on what grounds the original trial court stands to undisputedly accept such unreliable statements In conclusion the Defense requests for sufficient examination and proper investigation based on evidence and reasonable judgment Nothing further your Honor Now its the Prosecutions turn to make your statement Recently during the politician Keunhaes campaign trail a man slashed her face with a paper knife The man was sentenced to years Attacking the Judiciary as the last fortress of democracy with a lethal weapon due to a disapproving sentence is a serious crime no different from the attack on Keunhae Thus the State disputes the lenient sentence of years and would like to appeal for a heavier sentence Mr you did well today Youre a good partner for Prof Really Yes really Okay Lunch is on me Wow really My shoulders been bugging me ever since stopped drinking That shoulders still hurting Now what shall we order Sit sit Bro hes passing by Yo crossbow man My name is Kyungho was just transferred here while you were in the hospital heard you went on a hunger strike for two weeks Anyway Where did you get such good connections heard you missed court the first day of your appeal My hand It has nothing to do with that just wasnt feeling well Who gets just years after shooting a judge with a crossbow He must have great connections Shit Yongchuls got years or for cursing the judge Now look here Hey The correctiona officers tfid me youre a stubborn bastard and that youre driving them crazy Why dont you share a bit of those benefits youve got Okay why not ll share my connections What kind of problems have you got Wow nd th The Defense wants to call Bongju to the stand Explain why when hes already testified at the original trial Because he is a key witness in this trial As his statement conflicts with mine a crossexamination is necessary Then this request will be determined ater Are you repeating the original case again Whenever Lets just get this over with first The Defense motions for a bloodstain verification We would like to verify whether the bloodstains match s Are you suggesting they arent the victims You accept everything presented by Prosecution without a doubt while questioning all our requests Mr Please dont cut me off when m speaking According to Article in the Rules of Criminal Procedures when a prosecutor enters a request for evidence the correlation between evidence and fact must be specified But Then are you saying the blood on the clothes evidence cannot be verified Bloodstain verification is basic forensic procedure Counsel why are you bringing this up now and not during the original trial wasnt there at that time This trial can proceed without a bloodstain verification According to a written experts opinion Thats why we should confirm if that man is Bongju or not What is the Prosecutions opinion Since its clear the victim was wounded by a crossbow the State considers this procedure unnecessary Mr would like to ask you a question Wasnt the victims injury inflicted by your crossbow No Your Honor Then how did the victim get injured The hospital clearly verifies the injury and treatment he received Are you saying the paramedics doctors and others are all lying Yes your Honor has originally stated the broken arrow as evidence But Prosecution has presented an intact one instead Cant you see someone is lying Then well probably get some answers when witness Jongguk is crossexamined in the next trial Then what about summoning and the bloodstain verification Those will be postponed Youre postponing both further consideration wi be given to this matter The first paramedic to see the wound Changduk The patrol officer who collected the arrow Jongguk The police officer who filed the police report Sukjun The doctor who treated the victim Jaeki These four are confirmed as witnesses to take the stand Requests for Bongju and the bloodstain verification are postponed This court is adjourned hate being cut off when m speaking know The presiding judge keeps cutting people off No mean you Mr Who me But we had great teamwork back there Speak for yourself Prosecution summoned Dr Jaeki to cover up s conflicting statement Theyll argue that clearly had an injury Dont worry m great at crossexaminations Leave it to the expert The only real experts in this country are conmen Just remember dont cut me off again when m speaking What an asshole Therere no experts in this country because of guys like you Perfect teamwork doesnt come all at once Youll have to work hard at it What an asshole Good job Thank you The lawyers before had a hard time with my husband But you seem to be doing well Would you like to join me for lunch have to leave for Changwon right now Now Yeah ve got something for you Anything good Youre not even watching m changing the channel to my favorite drama Just leave it Who the hell gave you this cumbersome gadget Who is it None of your business Strange It must be a woman Awe come on shes no woman to me So whos she Didnt tell you about this journalist met Auch Hey What do you think youre doing Give them back to her What for She must think shes your wife What kind of woman gives a gift like this to a married man Its not normal unless somethings going on Are you out of your mind Who wouldnt go crazy in a situation like this Did or didnt you You did right Awe shit fine Okay m not using this m getting rid of them Hey Okay m getting rid of them Shouldve just slept with her before being accused like this What was that Who the fuck Someone mustve been hit Light out quick Quick clear everything Destroy all evidence ve submitted the preparatory pleadings you wrote me My attorney was happy you made his life easier Managertype attorneys are all like that m just showing my appreciation So please accept But dont smoke Its per cigarette Stop trafficking illegal goods like this Refund this cause just quit smoking rd th Witness On the day you were dispatched to the crime scene how many paramedics were there in the ambulance Seungmin and myself just us two Wheres the patient There hes coming out Hes coming out Whats going on Are you okay Hes okay Did you get to see the victims injury with your own two eyes Yes have According to this log Bongjus words have been written down Did you hear them directly from Yes have asked him in the ambulance how he got his wound He shot me from meters away The arrow struck me in the abdomen and bounced off Bounce off How could he get wounded when it bounced off m not sure really dont know In the Prosecutions report he stated he pulled out the arrow lodged in his abdomen But youve never heard this have not Nothing further your Honor Prosecution your witness for crossexamination It will be unnecessary your Honor According to the medical diagnosis filed by the witness the victim was hospitalized for which required weeks of medical treatment Is this correct Dr Yes it is Have you seen the wound for sure Dr Yes have Nothing further your Honor The paramedics log indicates the victims wound was cm before he reached the hospital But the diagnosis states cm Was the depth of the wound No it was the width the width of the wound The width But stated you told him the wound was cm in depth So you never said that couldnt have said that It is difficult to accurately determine the depth of a wound Nothing further your Honor Are you the policeman who retrieved Yes According to the deposition security guard Dukhwan stated he had placed the broken arrow at the garden threshold where the driver already placed the crossbow and two other arrows When you bagged the crossbow and the three arrows did you see the broken arrow Officer No havent Wouldnt that make the arrows a total of and not Then are Bongju and Dukhwan lying That m not really sure The accused shot the victim in front of the elevator inside So the arrow mustve broke as the victim wrestled the accused after being shot Since the witness retrieved three arrows from the garden outside and there was an arrow broken inside this broken arrow couldnt have been found at the garden Isnt this why you never discovered a broken arrow Your Honor The Prosecutions question is way too odd cant understand Wait No it is a good question m not finished Just be quiet for a moment Cant you see m speaking What do you two think youre doing Go on go Then wheres the broken arrow that the witness never found What Could the Prosecution have put it away somewhere What do you mean by put away mean could they have destroyed evidence Mr Prosecution answer the question Mr Are you the detective who bagged the victims clothes Yes am Are these clothes exhibits in the exact same state as when found They display the same state Can you confirm whether this shirt exhibit also is the same Yes Then why does this undershirt have bloodstains on it while this shirt has none despite an arrow penetration Can you explain m not sure guess It didnt seep that far out Then can you explain this This thick padded vest exhibit was worn over this shirt Why does this vest have bloodstains on it cannot give you an exact explanation Whys that Because it requires a scientific opinion Nothing further your Honor Your witness Prosecution Your Honor the State will not pursue a crossexamination Then would like to ask a question to the Prosecution advise you to place that question to me Every witness has revealed s statement as entirely false Yet the Prosecution is refusing to crossexamine witnesses Have you just given up Or are you admitting m innocent If nothing is proven then that means youre innocent Youll get your sentence at the end of this trial ve been through numerous judges who repeatedly postponed judgment calls that led to quack sentences and then told me to appeal if was dissatisfied Preposterous So please request Prosecution to prove their point right here right now Prosecution please respond The State believes sufficient evidence have been presented The witnesses testimonies have been suggesting that all the Prosecutions evidence are fase So what do you mean by sufficient If Prosecution cant prove their point then you will definitely be acquitted Therefore it isnt a matter you should be concerned of But cannot help but be concerned Whether s wound was sefinfict or fabricated by the Prosecution or if the witnesses are committing perjury dont you want the truth Okay What do you mean okay All m asking the Prosecution is for a proper explanation Next The bloodstain verification Dont change the subject Mr do not disrupt the order in this court Prosecution has stated they have presented sufficient evidence and it is my job to decide if this is true or not bloodstain verification calls for a judicial officer on site who confirms evidence in person But we cannot get the victims blood sample at this point Its just a simple request to confirm whether the bloodstain on the clothes exhibit matches with s blood There is no need for a judicial officers scene inspection All we need is a blood verification Then how will we acquire the victims blood sample What do you mean The court can request a blood sample And if the victim refuses a warrant can always be issued Because it is inappropriate Inappropriate Are you saying you undoubtedly accept the bloodstained clothes as evidence without proper confirmation The Defense strongly motions for a bloodstain verification Motion dismissed What do you mean dismissed Your motion is dismissed Summons for Bongju will be determined after the evaluation of all witnesses Judge Taewoo Its hard for you to take this court seriously right Mr Youre way out of line You hold no intent to follow the provisions in this book right will abide by the provisions Have you read the preparatory pleadings sent you on the th Which pleadings are you referring to Judge s court strategy and ulterior motive titled one Yes ve read it When did you testified during the original trial that the arrow which struck him in the abdomen had broken But none of the three arrows presented here are broken Mr The evidence presented by Prosecutor fully conflicts with the victims testimony Mr understand what youre trying to prove Let me finish Order in the courtroom If Prosecutor Saemin has destroyed evidence he should be held accountable by Article of the Criminal Law or Bongju for perjury according to Article Either one has committed a crime in court According to Article of the Criminal Procedure Act a public servant must press charges against those who have committed a crime Therefore you are required to act upon this responsibility while exercising your judicial duties Mr Only the judge has authority to preside the court But isnt it your duty to abide by the law Are you imposing your opinion m just urging you to listen will now decide the next public trial date So youll press charges on the next public trial Please make sure you do at the next trial Wait just a moment constitutional appeal The dismissal of a bloodstain verification request is unconstitutional as it violates the right to be tried by law Submit this to the Constitutional Court You should discuss these things with me in advance How am supposed to discuss it with you when the verification request was dismissed today It sounds like you were waiting to be dismissed ve been through this so many times had to come prepared m not sure whos the attorney here anymore Just make sure you discuss things with me in advance Prof how was the trial today Exactly as you have witnessed yourself You call this a trial Its just a bunch of bullshit Professor you did the right thing Be strong How can you say that when he shot a person What the hell is your problem Are you crazy Jackass One two three four Professor Thank you just told

Taewoo has resigned Really Now Mr drink up No no This is just water My boss here hasnt touched a single drop of liquor since the trials begun just dont want to be fired by the missus here Why dont you stop for good That cant do But you have to Just for this trial The trial is still in session but well broadcast the case as well as raise points on all suspicions surrounding this trial Okay cant believe a viceminister status Judge has just resigned It means hes got a conscience Actually there are cases which judges did good Ruling against prohibition of rallies for causing traffic problems or antihome demolition fights for obstructing business In that sense lets drink to a fair judgment There was a highranking court officials meeting just now decision was made for severe legal actions against this case declaring it as a terrorist attack against the Judiciary The Judiciary shouldnt back down because of this Chief Judge Jaeyeol has been reassigned to this case Hes a wellknown ultraconservative bastard Then hell be a good match Since m conservative and my nicknames bastard Hell be tough on you So well be tough back at him How Leave it to me Here we go again Now lets get back to work All rise in the courtroom th th Starting from this trial all audio recordings or court stenography will be prohibited Why are you prohibiting recordings authorized through proper legal procedures When a new bench is assigned a motion is required days before No motion has been received The Defense motions to compel a bloodstain verification Appeal must be judged within the parameters of the original trial As its outside these parameters motion is dismissed During this trial its been proven that has been making false statements Accordingly we need to summon again to confirm the truth hope this summons will be accepted Summons dismissed Are you approving s statement despite its discrepancies Do not question the bench on the truth of this case What do you mean by the truth of this case What are you saying Just one moment fine then Then according to the properties seizure report the accused voluntarily submitted the crossbow and arrows Fact is these items were seized instead of submitted by me filing a false police report is a serious Criminal offense which hope you are aware of your Honor m listening was asking if you were aware of this Just proceed with your argument am not making an argument but an inquiry Then will take that as a yes According to Article of the Criminal Procedure Act a judge who acknowledges a crime is required to press charges against the offender Therefore you must press charges against the police for filing a false police report will do nothing of such nature Mr You refuse Yes Prosecution Yes will press charges against Judge Jaeyeol for dereliction of duty Whore you pressing charges against Prosecutor Junbok Yes According to Article of the Criminal Procedure Act press charges against Judge Jaeyeol for refusing to abide by his duty to press charges when required And it will be in a manner of verbal accusation Satisfied Wait Your Honor were the crossbow and arrow seized with a warrant Please ask the Prosecution According to Article of the Rules of Criminal Procedures would like to enter a request for elucidation Request permitted What do you mean permitted want you to do it Are you refusing to preside this court The crossbow and arrows as stated in Article of the Criminal Procedure Act were not acquired through proper legal procedure And therefore cannot be accepted as evidence will accept them as evidence in this court Then ll file a constitutional complaint for judicial review Secondly request elucidation of the victims shirt Why arent there any bloodstains on s shirt Please demand an explanation from the Prosecution Arent you going to ask about the shirt Are you refusing to preside this court am presiding this court So continue your statement Mr m not making a statement here Cant you see am requesting an elucidation Demand for an explanation from the Prosecution At least nod if you can Prosecutor Junbok placed a request for eucidation to Judge but was denied Accordingly press additional charges against the judge for dereliction of duty Order in the courtroom order Does anyone wish to be placed under detention You may request an elucidation at the next public trial The Defense requests Bongju back have already dismissed this summons Next public trial will resume at pm of March th m Prof s attorney Wait wait Prof what is it you want to get out of this trial Do you want to win this trial or pick a fight with the judge Are you saying was wrong today No you were great You really drilled Judge hard At times he couldnt even respond to your version of the law you occasionally threw at him Thanks to you were further away from winning We need to choose and focus in order to win You shouldve help me summon Bongju back to the stand But youve seen how judges wriggle out of tight spots Theyll never give us Bongju Thats what m talking about Look outside Weve got a whole bunch of reporters We shouldve shown them how hard were fighting to summon back to the stand But what theyve seen today is just your own victory Prof Dont rely too much on the Press What do you mean by rely We need to use the Press fair and square Please leave the prison bus Dont ever forget that our adversaries are cunning Were moving you to another cell Get your things What for There are way too many applications for solitary cells Youve been in this one far too long So now were moving you to a shared one But therere a lot of things need to prepare alone Get your things and go Hey no Hey asshole Hey Hey Hey asshole Come here and massage me Look here young man Thats too much Shut up asshole Lets try to get along whie were here What happened to you Guard Help We couldnt visit you What happened during the past week Bastards were just trying to tame him We should press charges against the prison warden Honey Sangjuns coming to Korea Its the first time ve seen him so demoraized Want to emigrate to another country What do you mean by that You really want to raise our kids in this wretched country Whats wrong with this place Its gotten much better than before If we were living in the past d be wasting my entire life bringing home cooked meals to your prison cell Bullshit Is something bothering you Whats your dream Well guess its surviving as your wife until the day die That sounds horrible Media exposure as the crossbow case attorney has improved your looks Honey Huh Is a crossbow really that dangerous Cause it looks like it is What are you talking about Rambo was on cable today and the hero killed hundreds of people with a crossbow Dont be so naive Its just a movie movie Wow how powerful What happens if this missed its mark Miss its mark Yes The police asked the same question last time The police Grab it Struggle Move to this side And shove Move th th Is the accused absent today Yes your Honor The accused is in serious physical condition With the accused absent well just crossexamine witnesses Fine Are you Sergeant Inshik who ran the crossbow firing test Yes am Your Honor Court officer present the witness with a crossbow Sergeant show us the difference between a perfect loading and an imperfect loading Okay This is a perfect loading When experimented with a thick piece of pork the arrow penetrated it by a depth of cm Are you saying that perfectly loaded the arrow can penetrate that deep even from a far distance Yes Then explain the nd test with an imperfectly loaded crossbow Because the victims wound couldnt have been by a crossbow have been inflicted by an imperfectly loaded Its not working So the arrow could not be properly shot with an imperfect loading and thus couldnt reach its target Is that correct Sergeant Yes it didnt shoot out It didnt That is correct Nothing further your Honor As reveaed in the witnesss statement there are too many loose ends surrounding the victims wound In order to solve these issues the Defense has visited the crime scene and reenacted the alleged circumstances d like to submit this video recording for examination And what is it you want us to examine Itll reveal why the broken arrow had mysteriously disappeared That will be unnecessary Submission unaccepted Why wont you accept the material Crime scene inspection was done and we have sufficient material from the Prosecution final public trial is scheduled for the th of next month Final public trial your Honor We still have many areas to debate on enough of it Why did Bongju tell such a sloppy lie guess as he was changing he began feeling angry and spiteful Thus sefinfiction a wound to teach Prof a lesson He may have realized later it would be nonsense to have been wounded by a blunt tipped arrow and may have told someone to get rid of the broken arrow Can have the tape the judge unaccepted Of course Here it is Here Take it Mr Yes Then whose bloods on the clothes the police seized from the crime scene He must have realized as he reached the hospital that he needed bloodstained clothes and may have told his family to

permit recordings in this court There are no grounds in the Criminal Procedure Act It is stated in Article of the Rues of Criminal Procedure Rules of Procedures cannot have priority over Procedure Acts According to Criminal Procedure Acts all circumstances are ruled to be accepted unless there is a special circumstance But here we have a special circumstance Why did you distribute the trial records on the internet Court stenography is necessary for filing trial records and should not be publicized But you prohibited all court recordings and left us to deal with a mere page statement of the th trial Theres no way of knowing what was exchanged at the trial If you look close youll know Not really Crucial information was omitted Defense motions for a recording Motion dismissed What kind of quack trial is this Remove that woman from this court immediately Let me go Let go All quiet Your Honor You call this a trial This is tyranny Other notorious judges of the original trial Judges Sunoh or Taewoo werent like this Officer motion to challenge the bench Great Professor be strong Hang in there professor Youre wonderfu Order in the courtroom Honey you did well Thats how you should be Youve grown son Dad Be strong Your Honor motion for permission to withdraw appearance Motion denied Proceed with the trial The trial cannot proceed This case cannot proceed without a Defense Counsel This is a case that clearly requires proper Defense The court is in recess It will resume in minutes They wont be able to resume without a Defense Counsel They hired a Stateappointed one In any case they are trying to end this trial today Court resumes will represent the accused Then the Stateappointed Defense Counsel shall be cancelled The Defense cannot end things like this As you never responded Then well just listen to the elucidation As per the accusers request three matters were requested to the Prosecution for elucidation Prosecution please elucidate We will start the elucidation Firstly the crossbow and arrows have not been voluntarily presented by the accused Secondly where this broken arrow is now no one knows Thirdly why there are no bloodstains on the victims shirt truly have no idea So that means theres no proof What the hells going on Order in the court hereby close all examinations But you cant end crossexaminations your Honor You should determine the validity of the Prosecutions elucidation Why are there no bloodstains on the victims shirt Is this blood actually the victims And was the wound inflicted by a crossbow These points should be clarified dont you agree But the Prosecution clearly stated they have no idea Then dismiss all evidence presented by the Prosecution The bench will determine the validity of circumstances Then Defense will help determine the validity of circumstances The Defense motions to summon Bongju back to the stand as well as motion for a bloodstain verification Dismissed on the grounds that theyve already been dismissed But you must accept your Honor Defense Counsel Explain what accusation the accused is admitting to Are you saying that he had no intention of harming the victim No need to determine intentions as there was no injury Then do you admit that the accused went to Judge s place The Defense admits that this is true Did he have a bow and arrow with him He did your Honor And it was loaded correct That is correct your Honor Did the accused shoot the victim But it was accidental your Honor Did the arrow penetrate the victims abdomen No it didnt your Honor The accused admits it was wrong to threaten him with a crossbow But the shooting was accidental Then do you admit the arrow shot by the accused penetrated the victims clothes Not at all your Honor Are you claiming s wound and the hole in his clothes are irrelevant to the arrow shot at him They are absolutely irrelevant your Honor What about the bloodstains on the victims underclothes That is why we are motioning for bloodstain verification Why are you asking when you already dismissed this motion With this conclude all examinations Your Honor You shoudcodeftend the trial like this seriously advise order in the court Order in the court Look your Honor How can you run a court like this You call this a trial Arrest him Did you go through all that trouble to pass the bar just to run a fucked up court Arrest that man as well Do you all wish to be arrested for disorder in the courtroom Disorder in the courtroom The only one whos causing disorder in the courtroom is you You assholes couldve done a better job than you Guard from now on anyone who throws objects will be arrested Prosecution how does the State sentence this trial Prosecutor Junbok Sir What say you The State maintains the sentence as ruled during the original trial We call for a ten year sentence Counsel whats your final argument Counsel arent you going to give your final argument have given you your chance but if you wish to relinquish this right of yours so be it Your Honor would like to present my final argument The Defense clearly states that all evidence presented for examination proves the accused innocent am sure the bench is aware of the year old Dreyfuss case which framed an innocent man as a spy at a French military trial At that time despite the fact the real offender was arrested Dreyfuss was sentenced to life in prison Just to maintain governmental authority But now in st century more than years later a more absurd trial is being run by the Korean judicial system Even before the trial was held the Judiciary defined the accusers actions as a serious challenge against constitutionalism and publicly announced it as a fact would like to ask who is actually posing a serious threat to Koreas constitutionalism It is the Judiciary itself Judge Jaeyeol You should be ashamed of yourself This trial will end like this but humiliation will last forever Remember the Dreyfuss court eventually succumbed to great resistance from the French public Accordingly one day this judicial systems arrogance will have to stand judgment in the Korean publics court All crossexaminations will be cosed The sentence date is scheduled for April th at am th The accusers appeal holds no cause therefore it is dismissed filed an appeal to the Supreme Court Good job This is a constitutional petition If a judge is involved in a case a fellow judge cannot preside its trial Exactly Such cases should be subject to surveillance by a public court Anyway you look much better It must be tough on you to have a client like me right Yeah tell me about it What turned you into such a difficult man It started when was in elementary school Our teacher gave us a really difficult math question and told us the first student to solve it had to raise their hand After was done looked around to see that no one had raised their hand just waited with my hand down By the time the bell rang three had raised their hands which gave me enough courage to raise mine as well was a really different child back then And now theres no turning back No need to turn back Of course not Were gonna see this to the end Shout your number as you get off One two three four five six six Shit Do it right Six seven eight Hurry and walk straight All be seated Move fast Sit Stand Sit Whats your problem Are things still being run this way What do you mean by this way This is a breach of human rights Breach of human rights cant believe m being reprimanded by a criminal Whos that crazy dude Hes the crossbow professor who just got the Supreme Courts sentence Wait Can borrow your pen for a moment You must be kidding me Jang su Youngrak What the would call this an arrogation of a public servant No rules are stated as such in correctional management
