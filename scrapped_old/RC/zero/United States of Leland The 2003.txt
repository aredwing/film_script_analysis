Knicks His name was Earl Monroe His nickname was The Pearl Earl the Pearl Earl the Pearl right Well my parents were in Queens then My mom was a dancer She hated sports But somehow my dad talked her into going to check out a game at the Garden It just turns out that its Earl the Pearls night Cat went off dropped points on the Celtics After the game all my mom could do was talk about how watching him play was like watching a dance recital because he moved like poetry Hey Hey Break it up Outta my way man Anyway when was a kid that was pretty much all the story got But a couple of Christmases ago m knocking a few back with my dad And he embellishes So after the game they went back to Queens Well thankfully my dad spared me the details here But um the condom broke And nine months later whoops Here comes Pearl Here comes Pearl Trust me the sock know what they want from me They want a reason something to tie up with a little Bow and bury in the back yard Bury it down so deep its like it never happened They want me to say how m so sorry and it was my moms fault or maybe it was my dads fault or it happened because of or movies or some junk like that Or maybe blame some girl Not even when you were a little kid You never thought about whether there was angels or not Maybe when was a little kid My grandmother died when was real little And after that every time stole candy or fought with my mom or played with myself or something d get this real bad feeling d picture her from up high with this big frown on her face looking down on me dont think that they frown on us think that they look after us You know like guardian angels They take care of us make sure make sure nothing bad happens make sure everythings Well how come everythings not most of the time Well maybe theyre lazy What No its just kind of funny lazy angels It makes me think of these big fat guys with wings drinking beer and playing darts want you to be my guardian angel Lee want you to float over me make sure that everythings gonna be Your hair smells like strawberries Its my shampoo dodo its not my hair Well still like it Look at me m serious want you to say that youre always gonna be there Sometimes m somewhere else Just tell me that everythings gonna be Well cant really make sure everythings know but Sometimes you say things that arent totally true But you say them anyways because you want it to be true you know maybe maybe thats good enough Just Just tell me everythings gonna be Why dont you whisper it in my ear soft Everythings gonna be Yeah well if they extend the run you gotta stay right Course you gotta stay recognise that m not thrilled about it but you know recognise it Its water Miranda No it is its water Listen Ah Sweet Yeah No its fine The writings going fine The truth Um The truth is whenever sit down to write think m coming out of the gate with something fresh and just it winds up being a different spin on Boneyard Yeah ve basically been rewriting the same story for three years and still cant get the damn thing published Thanks honey No appreciate it but youre not really a writer unless people are reading your shit So Miranda look um m excited for you really am m fired up about all this love that its going so well for you This might be that big break youve been looking for When that comes along youve gotta tear into that shit like a rabid dog recognise that Itd just be a lot easier if you were here Fitzgeralds arrest Right now any connection between the two teens is unclear Well have more news right after this Nobody enjoys shopping for auto insurance but try and do it when youve had three speeding tickets Or an accident recall when our lives were unusual and electric when we burned with something close to fire But now we sway to a different rhythm Lives lived without meaning or even directed hope The passage of time measured only by loss Loss of a job loss of a minivan a son Hi Beth Are you What Sorry what did you say asked if you were Yeah Am Am about that guy right Kinda seemed like he was bothering you Thats Er it happens all the time think its the uniform have to wear it at this school that go to And its supposed to be really plain The whole point of wearing it is so you dont stand out think all it really does is turn on horny old guys Is it a Catholic school No its pretty much the opposite For people who messed up Messed up in what way All kinds of ways different ways Well what way did you mess up Did you really come over here to ask me about my screwedup life No came over here cos thought that guy was bothering you And because think youre really pretty People dont really say pretty any more They say stuff You know girls or whatever they say stuff is beautiful or cute but like pretty like the way it sounds Its Its a cool word Thanks for calling me pretty m Leland Leland Fitzgerald Becky Becky Pollard dont blame Becky guess m supposed to be upset about what happened with her m supposed to cry and all that junk But m pretty sure ve cried all the tears had out of me by now The last time cried was Grandmas funeral Heres another one of those things that sticks remember this other kid Some cousin of mine or something Seem there real polite with his hands folded up in his lap figured that was the way you were supposed to be didnt want that kid to see me crying But the tears came anyway Thats when figured out that tears couldnt make someone who was dead alive again We were given some time Theres another thing to learn about tears They cant make somebody who doesnt love you any more love you again Uhhuh Its me its Beck Its the same thing with prayers wonder how much of their lives people waste crying and praying to God If you ask me the devil makes more sense than God does can at least see why people would want him around Its good to have somebody to blame for the bad stuff they do Wha Whats wrong Nothing sh Its just that this is going kinda fast m not saying thats bad or anything This just isnt normally how operate Oh Particularly not with somebody from work Well how long does it normally take you to seduce one of your coworkers didnt seduce you No No Oh come on Youre beautiful Youre beyond that You have no idea how beautiful you are Youre deadly Youre deadly m powerless before you So you hanging out for a while m staying Cool Thats cool you know That makes me happy Cos kinda wanted to kiss you had no light to follow wanna kiss you real bad to say it right So can kiss you tell you how three days tried To wake me up oh but no My flesh had turned to snow And thought had died missed you always miss you have seen the face of God And was not afraid have seen the face of God So youre a writer Mmm Youre not really a writer unless people are reading your shit m an aspiring writer What do you write about Did you hear about that kid The one who stabbed that retarded kid Yeah m gonna write about him m gonna write a book about Leland Fitzgerald Maybe Gods there because people get scared of all the bad stuff they do They figure that God and the Devil are always playing this tugofwar game with them And they never know which side theyre gonna wind up on Boo You know youre a real goofball sometimes Hey speaking of goofballs Um this is my little brother Ryan Sing a song Byebye Ryan See you tomorrow Thanks Its nice nice to meet you Sing a song Its about all he says but watch Itsybitsy spider No no As soon as you start singing he gets all mad at you You dont really know what you want do you goofy guess that tugofwar idea explains how sometimes mean when people try to do something good it still turns out bad Dont use that young lives on me Madison Why does this minor deserve special consideration recognise youre wanting to preserve the whole treat everybody equal thing But this kid is different You cant deny that Weve never seen a case like this before Nobody has The answer is and will remain in perpetuity no will not have you meeting with any minor outside the classroom Am clear Very clear So your lawyer Charlie Its Charlie right So he explained how all this works You dont have to enter a plea or say a word here m not gonna enter a plea Good m just

you going to work No No mean just for a minute a couple of things Why did you do it got it Check the door Stop here Is that all counsel Yes your Honour The minors lack of a criminal record and the exemplary school performance are irrelevant matters here due to the severity of the charges And am denying your request that the minor be remanded into the custody of his mother Is there something youd like to add young man No Your Honour So do you live at the Pollards Yeah know what youre thinking Its a little strange No You dont think its strange No its just not what was thinking think its

Thats precisely what plan to do Oh have you ever read Proust know what you want from me Yeah just just want you to have somebody to talk to Its the same thing they want from the trial Whats that You want a why Well maybe there isnt one Maybe Maybe this is just something that happened Excuse me Isnt the game on What game Could you please just change the channel Yeah Its depressing me too like that title Its not supposed to mean m the President or anything Mostly its just a joke Well what do you write about guess how see the world How do you see the world Pearl Full of possibilities think that good things abound positive things What about you Theres two ways to see it One is like what you said where life is Where maybe stuffs wrong but you just dont see it Whats the other way When you see whats really there He didnt give you any idea what that might have meant He didnt say much When got home all he said was that hed made a mistake saw his hand and drove him to the hospital He didnt make a sound on the drive Its always there Even when stuff looks good When kids are playing couples are kissing and junk Its in all of that stuff But mostly people just look right through it Whats the it mean what dont they see Just how everythings always slipping away How everyones always kind of dying inside How sad everybody really is And seeing things this way makes you feel sad It doesnt make me feel much of anything Did you notice anything different about him Today When he visited Nothing unusual Ever since he got back this time from the moment picked him up at the airport something wasnt right with him figured maybe the two of you had a fight No Perhaps he was just upset about that girl Sometimes things dont work out between people And its nobodys fault Thats a very mature approach dont know Well you tell me Hows your girl Miranda Oh Mirandas great meant the other girl Oh thats just something that happened Would it hurt Miranda if she found out about this something that happened Yeah So why did you do it Shes not gonna find out Does that make it Look Mirandas been gone for a long time now m not even really sure where we stand And m only human man Its funny how people only say

m just a teacher there Visiting days next Sunday if you wanna You dont think m aware of that Did he do it m not really allowed to talk about that outside the facility Perhaps he told you something Yeah Yeah he says he did it But dont know why dont think he knows why either You know your son hes very detached Most of the time he seems completely disinterested in his own fate Uninterested in his own fate Look if you think m gonna be able to provide some insight into Leland youre wrong There are no private spaces in my sons heart reserved for me There never have been You moved to Paris Americas Too Loud that was what So Leland was Chronologies have never been my strong suit Well was he angry with you for leaving for moving away m not really that adept at gauging peoples emotional reactions to events disagree ve read your books Mmm so have They havent helped Well he still visits you out there right He said he gets out there a couple of times a year so What are your visits like Chapter Two right m sorry Fiction Youre not here out of some selfless devotion to my son or your admiration for my work Youre here because you smell a good book And m Chapter Two wanna write about your son But dont wanna exploit him Theres no distinction Good luck with your novel Maybe ll pick it up in the supermarket checkout line one of these days Well the truth is havent actually seen my dad since was six dont understand thought you travelled with him Well Hes sent me plane tickets one in the spring one in the winter every year since was But you never went to Paris never really talked to my dad after he left Sometimes hed send me money for my birthday junk like that One year he just decided he wanted me to come visit him for Christmas But had to fly to New York first then catch a plane to Paris Once got there though just kinda decided to stay in New York told my dad about how there was this sort of electricity in the air there and how wanted to stay He was with it He even said something like was a real neat kid for doing it Once got there couldnt find a hotel Noone would give me a room They were all so worried to give a kid a room But it didnt seem to bother them to send that same kid onto the street with no place to go So decided to hide out for a while And found this movie theatre And after the first movie this family came and sat down next to me And the dad guess he noticed the two big duffel bags that had next to me He made some corny joke about whether was staying for a while told him how came to be in New York That got the Moms attention Her names Angela But called her Mrs Calderon then She was worried about me She said could come stay with them for the holidays said it sounded pretty good You could tell her place cost a fortune And her daughter She was kind of snobby but She just kept trying to kiss me and wasnt into it then They were all really nice to me but particularly Mrs Calderon just loved looking into her eyes It was like they reflected the electricity of the whole city didnt feel lonely at all when was around her She kinda made me feel like everything was Or like stuff was wrong but you couldnt see it When my dad sent me another ticket that spring kinda figured maybe d just go back to New York instead But this ticket was for Italy And my dad said should fly to a new place each time see the world that way It could be our little secret Where did you go the last time Well my dad said should see New York in the spring Did you see the Calderons Did something happen Well its a big city Somethings always happening in New York What the fuck dude Where is she Wheres who And who are you Allen Come on lets go Where are we going Go where Here get dressed m gonna take you home Come on Look man Hey listen m not gonna beat

even fucking care Stop kicking him Stop Youre destroying her family Stop You fucking junkie Stupid junkie fuck dont think know what the definition of love is You know in your heart if you love somebody But its not in your heart Loves on your tongue Its a word thats all did you tell Becky you loved her She said she loved you But she still broke up with you right m not angry with her was never angry with her Its to be angry mean youre practically entitled to it Why Youre only human mean you are human arent you Well if you say so Pearl Thank you for what you did today think we should talk know that this doesnt seem like the best time but Julie found that letter found the letter to Iowa And er If youve changed your mind understand But why didnt you tell me Or ask me or something you know Its Its because can go out there with you and ll ll apply to school there next semester This isnt about where go to school its about us Oh Well you know what think So If you have something to

together for a really long time really close like were married since you moved in And everythings so set Sorry to interrupt but er wanted us all to talk about tomorrow well be right there dont know it just doesnt really feel right to me any more and Maybe it was just too much too soon you know Or that we both changed No havent changed havent changed Then ve changed And what want has changed dont want you to go out with me to Iowa m really sorry No wait Julie Hey Julie Julie heres the definition Love is when you cant get somebody out of your mind When theyre your first thought in the morning and your last thought at night Maybe its not in your heart but it is in your head So do you think about Becky All the time You dont have anything to worry about promise If you have to wake me up in the middle of the night to tell me that dont have anything to worry about it kinda makes it seem like do have something to worry about just wanted to see a familiar face just wanted someone to talk to Talk to at two oclock in the morning Look m really sorry didnt show up today but it just sort of came up you know didnt Look youre my guardian angel right can count on you Do you love this guy No You dont have to be afraid to tell me the truth dont know You dont know No Look m sorry just m confused and dont dont really mean Maybe we shouldnt talk We should talk tomorrow you know Its just really

Leland come on just wanna know if you fucked her Thats not relevant to what were doing here Well what are we doing here Were talking Mostly m talking m trying to help you Maybe m trying to help you m not the one who did something wrong to get here Just because what did is wrong doesnt make what youre doing right No never said right never made that distinction Right You only said you were human That explains it m a bastard Does that do it did it cos m a bastard And you wanted to mean you wanted to fuck that other girl Yeah wanted to wanted to dont see whats wrong with me asking you that Just talking right We went to my place And er There was a message on the machine from Miranda There was just this earthquake in And she woke up scared just terrified And instead of calling her back instead of calling my girlfriend back fucked some other chick knew it was wrong but did it anyway You know what the funny thing about earthquakes is After an earthquake you see people pulling other people out of brokendown buildings people hugging and junk because they saw a little girls shoe in the road and no little girl around Then a couple of days later they forget all about it It still shows you that theres goodness in people Well during earthquakes at least People make mistakes People are fallible We are fallible Leland Even with the best intentions most people dont have the inner strength it takes to do good all the time guess Look what happened with Becky dont blame Becky know you think thats why but it isnt Its not about why Look just hurt somebody feel terrible fucked up d feel better knowing that m sitting with somebody who fucks up too Well you know what happened She broke up with me for that other guy dont wanna hurt you So dont Sometimes things dont work out Its nobodys fault Thats bullshit Thats bullshit Its her fault She lied to you dont see it that way But at some point you did m sorry get confused you know m not like you You say its hurting you but it doesnt seem like it matters one way or another It matters At some point you got angry Prove it to me Show it to me How do show it You said things and you did things that it didnt make any sense to say and do It didnt change anything but you did them anyway Yell at you Should scream at you Hit you Is that how show you it matters If hit you it matters love you What else can say Nothing say is gonna change anything Cos you love somebody else didnt like being the kind of person that did that What kind of person Like everybody else didnt like the way it felt But you liked how it felt when you were in love with her right Its all part of the tradeoff man Loves only such a great thing because you know what it feels like to get your heart broken what it feels like to be alone There was something said before something that was kind of a lie About what Its about how it doesnt make me feel much of anything Mostly keep it out but When you cant dont know It covers my eyes Its just all can see Say theres some kids playing baseball All see is the one kid they wont let play because he tells corny jokes Noone thinks theyre funny Or see a boy and a girl in love and kissing you know just see that theyre gonna be one of those sad old couples one day who just cheat on each other and cant even look each other in the eye And feel it feel all of their sadness feel it probably even worse than that sad old couple or that corny kid will ever feel it Do you feel like that now Well mostly keep it out Did you feel like that after you fought with Becky dont know maybe After you got back from New York It doesnt matter Cos telling you about it and getting you all sad and junk well it never changes anything Cos nothing can make what happened unhappen Excuse me Mr Pollard sir Oh please this isnt the time We were hoping that you might just m asking you aa a favour please Sir respect your situation Well thank you for that But we were hoping that you might Hoping might what Hoping might what Were in grief

If you want a fucking story you go talk to that kids parents Harass them Ask them how they raised a monster Theyre the ones who did something wrong not us m sorry want it to be over know But its never gonna be over Its never gonna be over You ever think the whole thing doesnt make sense mean they take all this stuff away from you Freedom girls and sunshine Because its supposed to make it so when you get back on the outs you never wanna screw up again All it really does is get you to thinking that youre so small you know Like youre this small thing that doesnt matter for anything By the time you do get out you dont even feel like a human person any more Damn devil boy they cant even make a layup out there Its important to me that she knows that didnt know Promise me youll tell her didnt

and come out there Because wanna make this right you know wanna make this right between us Cos love you love you very much Its all for you Shit Hey Allen think there are two ways you can see the world You either see the sadness thats behind everything or you choose to keep it all out wasnt lying when said dont blame her It was a couple of days after all that stuff with Becky that got the plane ticket to New York from my dad was excited to be back in the city around Mrs Calderon too But as soon as saw her could tell something was different She was divorced It turns out Mr Calderon cheated on her for almost the whole time they were married That night told her about what happened with Becky It happens at different times for different people but it happens to everybody The worst part about growing up heartbreak But its a part of life It seems like a pretty big part Thats why you have to believe that life is more than the sum of its parts kiddo kind of felt my heart breaking for her but knew that was no good wanted to do something for her but there wasnt anything There wasnt one thing could really do Open the box What is in there There are no tears to be wasted How can climb On a shoulder to cry If only this night Could just take us away The electricity wasnt in her eyes any more Her eyes were still reflecting what was there but now it was the sadness started to see it everywhere Every face was different but the same saw in Ryan worse than anybody All the words they were teaching him were things to stay away from There werent any words like strawberry or kiss You could tell he really liked this girl who worked there but she just smiled at him started to think that he knew He knew that nobody looked at him like a normal kid People either laughed at him or felt sorry for him He couldnt do anything about it He was trapped couldnt sleep hadnt slept since New York was lying there and d think about Mrs Calderon and d think about Ryan and felt things tight in my chest felt like was drowning Theres all this sadness and theres nothing you can do about it and all wanted was for it to go away When say dont remember that day m not lying wish could remember but dont At least not the stuff they want me to Christ Jesus Oh God Its over Its over now Maybe it makes sense now Maybe somewhere in all of this there is a reason Maybe somewhere in all of this there is a why Maybe somewhere theres that thing that lets you tie it all up with a neat bow and bury it in the back yard But nothing Not getting angry not prayers and not tears Nothing can make something that happened unhappen You know m sorry dont you Pearl do know you are It doesnt change anything m sorry The worst part is knowing that there is goodness in people Mostly it stays deep down and buried And we dont have God because were scared of the bad stuff Maybe were really scared of the good stuff Cos if theres no God that means its inside of us and we could be good all the time if we wanted So when we do bad things itd Be because we want to or because we have to Or maybe we just need the bad stuff to remind us what the good stuff is in the first place What are you doing you goofball Just go around Uh Come here Come here Come here Everythings Everythings gonna be promise Dont go racing When youre on your own Feet down and raining See the jewel flow Now that the years Seem like memories Broken dreams How can turn back around Slip back and join in the crowd If could love you now Dont go racing With the world in your head Theres no generation Who Now let the fear Be memories Broken dreams How can you turn back around Slip back and join in the crowd Forces keep pushing me down Yet would love you If you could love everyone around If could love you Ballroom lips On the way home You made up my mind And Well remained sort of sick Now that know What was written in stone Dooh doohdooh dah Doohdooh doohdooh dah Dooh dooh Ballroom lips Fell on the floor You made up my mind But didnt die Well remained sort of sick Now that know What was written in stone We used to talk about If everything was right The way we spent our time Its hard to believe Gloat on the design Glory and laughter Hold my entire world Believe Tumbling Out in the yard We were given some time Subtitle for BluRay releases titler
