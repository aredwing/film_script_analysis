The growth of the Internet has changed small startups to some of the most influential companies in the world Behind these companies are more often than not young visionary entrepreneurs who grew up with the Internet and now seem best positioned to direct the future of the web Who are these new entrepreneurs and what drives them really great founder seems to be building a groundswell even if there is nothing there and so he in effect is a magician He creates something from nothing You are always kind of just on the edge of your comfort zone and everything you are doing is basically something you are just barely qualified for or not qualified for it is like jumping off a cliff and having to build your own parachute think an entrepreneur that is difficult one how do you define an entrepreneur think an entrepreneur is a person who dares to have a dream that not that many people have and even more importantly dares to chase it with their money where their mouth is and their time and their career and dares to take the risk to going out there to realize that vision Entrepreneurs are some of the craziest people you ever meet they are people who have a dream or an idea something that keeps them awake at night and they get the opportunity to hopefully solve that problem or do something about it So the best entrepreneurs are often either solving their own problems or solving some huge things and they can really Entrepreneurship at the moment is kind of like the new smoking its cool to be creative and it is cool to be making something and just love that energy Over the last couple of years the cost of starting a webbased startup has decreased dramatically think over the last couple Of years it has changed dramatically If you think back to the turn of the century two thousand what you had was very large companies often creating websites like Yahoo these were much bigger companies creating new kind of products on the internet With the crash those went away but the Internet didnt go away and what actually happens was that new initiative young innovators came along looked at the web and said we can do Ten years ago if you wanted to startup a company you got to pay a lawyer to tell you weather you should do a Corp or a Bam that is a Google search done free in like five minutes You know by that time you would not even gone past the lawyer secretary ten years ago It is really interesting to see What entrepreneurs will look like ten years from now Before they were managers maybe little engineering but now they are young tech people and hackers Anybody now with a laptop and a WiFi connection can build anything Today a lot of people will be able to start companies who never could have before This applies specially to younger people They are willing to put in the long unpaid hours and have nothing to loose As you get older you get certain ways and certain patterns and you recognize them and behave in certain way but think that the young entrepreneurs see things differently in a way that is often times refreshing and therefore groundbreaking One of the great benefits of starting young in business is that you have less to lose than you know once you have four kids and something where you have to remortgage your house in order to finance your company that is a bigger risk to take then if you come straight out of university and all you kind of have to choose between is either you take up a job or you start a crazy company to do crazy thing have met kids out here who are still teenager and starting companies and all the way down to sixteen years old which is pretty crazy when you think about it Younger people have been affected by less and they are often times more idealistic and they have bigger dreams and bigger vision because they do not know necessary It doesnt really matter to me could be fifty for all care because removing the age element is really what think what makes the Silicon Valley area so fascinating That know so many people that could be really young or really old they still take you seriously they will still listen to you And that is why there is culture of listening that is so conducive to entrepreneurship which is why this area is so valuable to people Brian Wong grew up in Vancouver Canada At he had raised million dollars in funding for his company Kiip a reward network where you play games on your phone and get real rewards through Kiips network My parents at one point thought was addicted to my computer and wanted to take it away from me and m glad that they ended up not doing that but spent like eight to ten hours a day on my computer this was at a point when was very addicted to Counter Strike Source which is a first person shooter game which was extremely popular when was young and still very much is and spent hours and hours playing that game to maintain my top of server status and was at the top of like three servers and it takes a lot of time spent a lot of time on Photoshop taught my self how to design because figured it would be pretty fun to learn how to do that taught myself through forums and tutorials and all that fun stuff It was all about wanting to create something out of nothing studied marketing and also did a minor in politic science wanted to study something that was completely unrelated to tech that was in liberal arts so that could learn how people on the other side of the table were thinking and it was very enlighten was able to learn a lot about perspectives around politic theory and one of the things it helped me do was to understand power structures and politics is inherently turn around power and if could learn how to navigate these power structures could be successful in other areas and so that is what political science really made me do started a web design company like every other web entrepreneur ends up doing at some point and called it a design consultancy and we basically charged people to make layouts and it was really me and my buddy like hammering out code and then sending it off to someone on a freelance website to make it all work and then send it off to that client and charging a lot of money for it Wasnt work at all It was just me spending time to have fun and it happened to pay us well We were able to pay most of our college tuition from it that was great but other then that didnt think too much of it After skipping four grades in school and finishing college at only he decided to move to San Francisco realized if were to do something meaningful for the rest of my life it had to be in a city that was larger that had more money in it and more people could relate to and knew that Silicon Valley was the place to be so m going to go check it out and see it with my own eyes was it really Nerdtopia as they called it is it actually that awesome So flew down and cold emailed just people figured you know what is the worst thing could happen if email all these people and they say no great was not even going to meet with them in the first place By emailing people in Silicon Valley Brian managed to get meetings with some of the worlds most respected venture capitalists and entrepreneurs He got a job at a startup named Digg a popular social content website Digg had to lay off of their staff and after only a year Brian was fired had like dollars left on my bank account was about to go bankrupt bed was like fifteen hundred it is not cheap to live in the city and remember talking to some of my friends that made over the last few months and was like hey have got this idea and they were like hey know this Adam And met with Adam for coffee and Adam was like well this is cool you know cool pitch bla bla bla Usually you never hear back from them ever again but then Adam the next day called me and he said hey you want to do a partners meeting didnt even know what a partners meeting was at the time you know what is a partners meeting And realized it was a very important meeting clearly because that is where they were making the decision and the week after that had a term sheet and as a nineteen year old sitting looking down at that many zeros you are freaking out because this is the most amazing thing you have seen in your whole life then realized it was my ticket it was a very chance thing got very lucky True Venturess investment made Brian able to start the company he had dreamed about He was years old at the time which makes him the youngest person to ever receive funding by a venture capital firm beating founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg by one year Next months was very clear to me beyond that couldnt see anything but didnt really care because knew we had six months or less to prove a lot out so it was just a race against time to make things happen and was so determined to sit down and be like m not leaving this room until something happens and this is going to make the world a completely different world in the next few years and you are going to help me change that and people were there to be a part of this vision and couldnt thank them more there were lot of very early supporters that believed in this crazy Asian kid and his random idea about real rewards and virtual achievements it is like the people who have supported me thank them and they are part of their lives even till this day Being an Internet entrepreneur is hard work The freedom of not having a boss comes with strings attached Vacations disappear into the mist of long hours money problems and sleepless nights Bootstrapping the art of building a business with little or no money is the most common way to start a company today Sometimes get worried about these young entrepreneurs who spend years trying to be the next Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg and they are sitting in a dark room coding and they miss out of the best years of their lives You need to When was an entrepreneur and think still now it was go to sleep after a long night of coding you wake up late usually because you just need to sleep You drink a lot of soda eat a lot of junk food you dont dress necessary that well didnt dress that well and you kind of just work all the time and that is your entire life It is always a rollercoaster ride you know every time hang out with one of my entrepreneur friends it is always like lets just get it out of the way are you on like are you on a high part of the cycle or are you down in the depths because it is pretty much going to dictate how the dinner or the meeting goes you know a lot of times people are like we are killing it we are going to change the world and you like talk to them tomorrow and they are like dude dont know why am doing this should have just been a banker This is the most manic depressive way you can possibly live life right you are never having a good day you are either having the best day ever or you think youre about to die know people who run a startup who manage to balance things and do other stuff in life as well m not one of those people Alexander Ljung is the and cofounder of SoundCloud an audio platform that enables anybody to upload sounds on to the web SoundCloud is one of the fastest growing companies in the music world The companys headquarters are in Berlin but because of their fast growth they have opened an office in San Francisco so Alexander splits his time between Berlin and Silicon Valley Alexander grew up in Sweden and went to the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm where he studied human computer Interaction didnt have the typical entrepreneur background of you know opening up a lemonade stand and you know selling magazines to the neighborhood but realized in hindsight like that was always doing these intense projects would come up with an idea and then you know cut out everything else in my world and only focus on that idea so in that way was very entrepreneurial in terms of doing projects and creating things but it wasnt in business sense but definitely always had the tendency to go you know over the top with project that was doing weather it was installation of interactive shoes that made noises or ping pong table that you could make music with or what ever it might be so had a strong drive to create things but it wasnt didnt think of it as business quality or anything like that Alexander met his cofounder Eric Wahlforss in college when they bonded over being the only ones using Mac computers They both had a background in music and were familiar with the problem of collaborating with other musicians They decided to create SoundCloud to solve that problem In the beginning we were really excited but think it was we were more excited about it because like we wanted this product and we were like this has to exist because then we can do this and we can do that think we were so obsessed with what it would do for us that we didnt necessarily see the full potential of how big of an impact we could actually have on the web and the world outside of it After graduation in he and Eric decided to move away from Stockholm to be able to focus totally on building of the company They traveled around Europe looking for the best place for a tech startup We went on a trip to London Barcelona Vienna and Berlin Berlin was the last stop and the idea was just to feel out the city a little bit and see if it would be were we wanted to move We were in Berlin and we were there for about a day think and we immediately thought okay this is the place There are so many creative people here Its a good tech scene so actually that same evening when we got back to Stockholm we were like you know what screw it we are moving to Berlin next week We took one week rented out our apartments packed a big suitcase and then moved over to Berlin and the next week we set up an office at a local caf there and yeah it turned out to be even better than we thought so we stayed You know a lot of people talk about bootstrapped startups but that was like should be in the dictionary of bootstrap mean we literally moved over with a rucksack each and that was it We were in a caf and then our next office was a conference room of a friends startup think we lived there for a couple of days then they kicked us out We found our own office which was this almost like an old abandoned attic were we pulled the cable outside the window to get internet in there We had five good chairs in Stockholm we had gotten them from another entrepreneur for free so those we decided to bring down from Stockholm to Berlin so think we had a friend who took them in his car or something and then we were rolling them around Berlin The music scene in Berlin is fantastic so on the weekends we would be out clubbing at all these fantastic Berlin clubs from Friday until Sunday evening and then you know back on Monday just like coding you know the whole week through and thing that went on for like half the year or something just no break what so ever In October SoundCloud launched their product after being in private beta for more than a year When we decided to open the site for the public we thought well we are in Berlin so the right way to do that is at a club so we actually threw a launch party at a club that our friends have called Picnic We actually launched at twelve oclock at night at the club like we had Sean our chief architect was sitting upstairs in a small room with a laptop deploying the site and we were like Eric and were behind the desk launching the site on the dance floor and we were just like okay its going to crash its going to crash but it survived it survived the whole night and the morning after was a bit tired but first thing when we woke up were just like is the site online and it was online We started seeing we had signups through the night and from there on we were open and full on Alexander drew attention to his company in a creative way It involved a leather jacket and some spraypaint Every time was doing a talk at a conference made sure that had some point in the talk were could turn around so that people could see this jacket the back of it Its good like there was pictures of this jacket all over the web and people were talking about it because it looked kind of cool and know so many investors that remember that jacket so that was actually a good thing for us to you know to get the Cs who see tens of new startups every day to actually remember ours and so you know a jacket some spraypaint and a cheap jacket it was probably you know a pretty good euro marketing stunt SoundCloud now has more than million users and million dollars in funding Their users include such high profile musicians as Rhianna and Kylie Minouge You know almost everybody in the company knew about it had this thing that the day that Bjrk signs up m going to take the day off then we are done and it was probably about months ago that she signed up in preparation for the new album and started posting this really awesome little sound bites where she was talking about the new album and that just made my day and then was just okay have to take the day off and ten minutes later realized that the only thing wanted to do at my day off was to work so then ended up going back to the computer and actually ended up working that day anyway To turn an idea into reality the entrepreneurs often need to meet additional costs Thats where the investors enter the picture They give the entrepreneurs funding in exchange for a part of their company Venture capital firms and angel investors are attracted to startups because of their potential to grow rapidly for a limited investment Well think that angels tend to be private individuals people who have probably had successful businesses themselves in the past and now they are looking to invest some of their own capital into early stage companies and they are usually doing it partly to get a return to make some more money but partly also because they enjoy doing it they see it as a great way of mentoring and working with young people in early stage companies a venture capitalist is someone who is really doing that as a job so we have typically raised money from bigger funds like pension funds like government and we are doing it to basically return money to our shareholders If m loaning money to someone kind of want them to succeed but mostly just want them to pay me back In the case of making an investment in a business want them to succeed really big The process of venture capital is either we find you or you find us and generally when we are looking for you that is a good thing When you come to find us it is more of a shot in the dark fiftyfifty First and second time you start a company it is very difficult to get money instantly you have to know some angels and it is also a very good education to have some angels to help you out who can then take you to the Cs because if you are just fresh out of school you do not know the Cs you dont even know what a mean maybe you think it is a toilet You give your pitch and you meet all these different investors and visit the venture capitalists at their offices down in Menlo Park You give maybe a half hour fortyfive minute pitch and you talk to bunch of different investors and after a series of more meetings then they decide if they will invest or not We raised about a million dollars and the feeling until we finished raising was the feeling of fear would any investor buy into this and would we actually be able to raise the money Jessica Mah is the founder and of InDinero a company that creates software to help small businesses better track and manage their finances Jessica has been building businesses since she was years old She finished high school when she was and at she had raised over a million dollars for her own startup was pretty bored in school when was young so was always trying to find a way to make more money on my own so was doing stupid stuff like lemonade stands or going to neighbor houses to try to rake their leaves or anything to make my own money got my first computer when was in third or four grade and started programming when was think thirteen years old and just really wanted to make my own game and websites so picked up some books from the local book store and did that in my spare time My mom is an entrepreneur so she told me why not take your programming skills and make a business out of it and that is when first started thinking about building my own company when was working on my first company when was thirteen had at least a few hundred customers and all of them were paying me recurring revenue every single month was selling stuff on eBay and was selling my programming services made some money didnt make big money but enough was making like high five digits Jessica went to Berkeley where she studied computer science there she met her cofounder Andy Su At first we were just doing homework with each other but after we do our homework we thought why dont we do other fun things when we are not doing our homework so we started brainstorming startup ideas and just programming project ideas and we started building stuff in our spare time and then that ultimately led way to us wanting to build a real company together In college Jessica and Andy started to build what was to become InDinero She and her team lived together in a small apartment in Silicon Valley thought it was so much fun to live in an apartment with my cofounder and with our early team because you are just You are literally eating and sleeping and breathing your startup when you do that and it was just a few of us in a small tiny room the living room and we got our computers there and just wake up roll out of bed and build our startup and then we cooked meals and then just went back to working again It was a lot of fun The first version of InDinero was really bad it was just my cofounder Andy and going to a hackathon and we had a weekend to build a project and present it to about a hundred people We didnt really care about product quality or anything We just programmed all weekend long to build it InDinero launched in She and her team needed more money to build the product She initially set out to raise thousand dollars for the company but received so much interest that she eventually had to turn investors away Our launch went really well and think it went well because we took our time to build our product and we didnt just launch it when we felt ready but we knew we were ready because we demoed it with dozens of entrepreneurs We saw them signup and we knew which common problems they had so we knew that it was ready for the public and then people started offering checks and it all rolled in and then it was the feeling of optimism and excitement and finally when we had all the money we decided to spend it really slowly We didnt just spend it over night on random stuff We were really cautious about it because had never seen that much money in my life and all though it not that much for a company it was a lot for Andy and think about the business almost all the time try to not think about on Saturday but every other day think that if you are not thinking about your startup then you are not doing a good enough a job if you are the founder at least Because you are going to come up with your best ideas at the most random moments when you are driving in your car or thinking in the shower or just walking to work and so think you have to think about it all the time The Lifestyle is hectic you have to be working long hours and you have to be enjoying that So why are they doing this Is it about walking away with millions of dollars Or is the ultimate goal having satisfied users and a good product was supposed to be unemployed was supposed to have no money And here am m able to eat sleep live under a roof and have an office It is already amazing for me so could live on sustenance right and couldnt care less think a lot of people jumps out of them how wealthy some tech entrepreneurs get Look at Bill Gates or Larry and Sergei in Oracle or you know Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg and you think it is all about the money but if you ask them it is really not If you talk to those guys who are entrepreneurs they are not in it to make big money and it turns out if you think about how much you are going to make of money you might make money but it is not really a good indicator So think the primary motivation really is that the best entrepreneurs try to change the world think that it is always very different and think it is sometime very personal too what drives them think we have certain entrepreneurs that really want to change the world others just realize that this is incredible way to build a lot of wealth and others are really just passionate about their product and are really not thinking about the business itself think too many entrepreneurs are in it for the wrong reasons think they are in it for the money for the fame for the glory and a lot of them are going to say they are not in it for any of that but they are just cheating themselves The first time entrepreneurs when they first get funded they at first are really thrilled that they got funded and then the weight of the money is on their shoulders and they say ohh wow we really got to do this and we are going to make sure it works because we have now raised money from somebody else from other people think that a lot of entrepreneurs are spending their twenties working all the time because there are a few different reasons One a lot of them see the opportunity for fame and success and more than that the best ones just really have these great ideas and realize they can do something right now its cheap to do it you can just come up here and do something and potentially really alter the way the world works m not building software to build a business and make a ton of money and get rich of it Leah Culver is the and cofounder of Grove a realtime group chat service for teams She started her first company in when she cofounded a social network site named Pownce which a year later got her selected as one of the Most Influential Women in Web by Fast Company So first became interested in programming and sort of doing little bit more with computers when was about fifteen it was kind of trendy at the time to make your own webpages and everyone wanted to have their own homepage so got one of these free Angelfire GeoCity homepages and started to learn wasnt quite sure that that was wanted to for a job think it was kind of always thought was really fun but actually wanted to be a graphic designer when was younger because my mother was a graphic designer and think it is easy as a kid to just want to do what your parents do because my mother always loved her job and thought that it would be so cool to love what was doing She graduated from college in and decided to move to San Francisco After graduating from college really wanted to move someplace warm because grew up in Minnesota which is very cold and got a job at a startup in San Jose and worked for startups for a little while and then realized that wanted to do my own wanted to work on my own projects That is why got into programming because wanted you know to work on my own things Leah needed a new laptop but couldnt afford it She came up with a unique way to generate enough money to buy a new one when she sold ad space on her computer to several companies by laseretching their logos on the surface of the computer So said Buy a space of advertising on this laptop and made like a corny webpage for it like hey if you buy an ad on my laptop show it off on all this San Francisco cafs and things and didnt actually think that anyone would pay attention to this stupid website did it kind of as a joke and out of the frustration that didnt have enough money and people ended up actually buying ads on it and paying for these cute little ads and it was fun It was a lot of work to get people to buy the ads but ended up getting enough money to buy the laptop and etched it and made a video of it and made the whole thing a production and tried to really get the most value to the people who actually did buy the ads and felt a little bad you know somebody have to get something good out of it but it was a really interesting experience and probably like really good lesson in marketing and sort of following through on a project Leahs first startup began as a hobby when she started playing around with sending messages and media to her friends She got two of her friends involved and they turned it into a social network The site got a lot of attention and at some point invitations to use the service were being sold on eBay My first startup was actually Pownce and it is sort of a funny story because most people will go through several big failed startups or little failed startups that no one ever heard of before they end up making a product that is fairly popular Pownce was very popular for a first startup It is not really the traditional way that startups are built most of the time you will have some small startup that dont work out that well but was lucky enough to work with Kevin Rose on Pownce who is fairly well known and ended up getting a lot of publicity for my first startup Your first startup is really really exciting Everything is a big deal and everything matters and you get shirt and stickers and it is so exciting to have sort of your own startup year later the company was struggling due to a lack of revenue The team decided to sell Pownce to a software company called Six Apart Two weeks later the site got shut down How did it feel to sell the company It was interesting Its kind of exciting because you are like someone wants to buy my company and its exciting but at the same time it is kind of sad because you lose sort of the independence and freedom to work on the project They ended up shutting down the site which wasnt super happy about so that wasnt a great experience Things can go wrong You can end up blaming people You can end up having a lot of fighting when things arent going super well and they never go super well dont know why anybody thinks that startups are rainbows and sunshine Its a lot of hard work mean if you want rainbow and sunshine work a job and have a hobby on the side because hobbies will always be rainbow and sunshine cause when they dont work out you dont want to work on them think there is a part of our generation my generation where you need to be perfect and good in everything and part of being an entrepreneur is You will fail you will mess up and do things wrong mean even Pownce the site got shut down like acquired and shut down because we ran out of money that is kind of a failure but you need to be able to say that is okay and move on from that Or something might not work out in the way you expect and think that is hard for a lot of people to know that they are going to do something wrong Failure is a part of the startup culture In the news we only hear about the successful companies but what about all the others of all startups will fail You cant have everyone be a success its just not a tenable situation so most startups still do fail but the good news is that when those startup do fail it is a great lesson often times for the entrepreneurs and you usually see a lot of them come back and try again What is really important is to make sure that you know m not really putting my whole identity in this startup and realize that this might fail In our experience about out of out of the investments we make fail and we lose all our money and maybe out of float along and maybe we make our money back or maybe two times our money so really one or two of those ten investments that make it a huge success that make venture capital worth pursuing and those are the one or two that make us many many times our money Yeah failure is totally accepted here It is actually even better if you failed in your profile people value a lot that you failed and its totally okay fail every day in something Guys who do really well they are guys who have crashed another company before and the guys who havent crashed another company yet this is the company they need to crash made million dollars when was and lost it all by the time was and that experience really made me realize that in life the most important thing is the people around you and it is easy to forget that and get caught up in the hype You only get one life You got to live it Dont forget to actually enjoy it Ben Way is an English serial entrepreneur He grew up in England and was early fascinated with building businesses He started a computer consultancy at age At he had raised million dollars making him one of the first dot com millionaires By twenty he had lost it all was always very different in school m severely dyslexic was told at years old that would never read or write because was pretty useless still have trouble spelling business and entrepreneur is a word couldnt even possible hope to spell but was very lucky and one of the reason why got into computers and technology is that was actually given a laptop at years old to help me with my dyslexia and was one of the first of kids in the whole of to be given a laptop for education My first semi proper business was at twelve years old bought some chickens and sold their eggs and had a proper cash flow where used to look after the fee and check the sale of the eggs You know eggs have very good margins at twelve years old After my chicken business started my first computer consultancy on my th birthday charging pounds an hour and that was really how started a proper business think at the time was the youngest company director in the country and it wasnt until few years later raised twentyfive million pounds for what was back then the first ecommerce search engine At after the Dotcom crash in Bens company went bankrupt When failed failed in spectacular fashion lost twenty million pounds lost my car the girl loved my house couldnt even buy a tube ticket in the same day was in the rich list But even after this experience he decided to continue building businesses In he started Rainmakers an innovation and venture company So after failed it did take me a while to get back on my feet After losing everything it was very hard time in my life ended up doing a reality show and traveling the world But entrepreneur is such a deep part of me It took about months years to start my own business again but never any second does business leave me m always thinking of business so even after failed was thinking of ideas for new businesses could do Sometimes wish could quiet my mind a bit more often But every second by every day is consumed by the thought of making the world a slightly better Its been a you know a very Long and challenging time had some great successes during that time and great failures also just dont fear the failures so much any more Even tough so many companies fail entrepreneurs continue to start new businesses in the hopes that theirs will be that one in ten company that succeeds What does it take to build a successful startup Successful startups needs a lot of things They need a great idea They need a great team and they need to be there at the right time and they need the right level of funding There is a lot of luck in the success of all business that have succeeded There were search engines funded before Google was funded There were Friendster and Linkedin and Myspace and about others before Facebook became the big winner in that area There is a little bit of luck that just happens where somebody gets it just right That could be skill that they figured out what the user really really wants and thats the thing that makes those big businesses Some of it is that you are at the right place at the right time and you get lucky think with any company there is a lot of luck involved You can have great idea and work really hard and be really smart but the one thing that is out of your control is timing Absolutely team is super important you know big market dont know its magic its totally magic its all of that stuff and out of times they fail and the one time it does work it happens in a totally unexpected way Look at Twitter right how big was micro blogging when Twitter started Look at Facebook how big was social networking when that started Those werent huge interesting markets but that is what you hear from all Cs That is really what we look for in those investments These werent really big investment at the time Starting a company often feels like series of miracles and you have to have one set of really good thing happen right after the other So it really does feel like a lot of luck but at the same time if you really work hard and try a lot of things and really experimental you can create your own luck And you can make these miracles happen When was young didnt know what a entrepreneur was understood it as a catchall word to define any independent small business person that is just what thought but it sounded pretentious to me cant even pinpoint where it all came from but just always had the impression that was going to invent things Zach Klein is a year old entrepreneur He is the cofounder of Vimeo a popular video sharing site visited by million people each month He started his career working on website called College Humor Two of his friend from college started to post silly pictures of themselves on the Internet in Pretty soon the site was getting a thousand visitors a week and Zach joined them while he was still in college never thought about quitting college loved college The clich think it was some of the best times of my life It was a really nice intersection of innocence and independence and it was lovely And went to school in North Carolina where love and would give anything to have four more years there After graduation in he and his three partners moved the company to New York We were having a hard time taking seriously by anyone in the industry because we werent in San Francisco and New York and think all of us sort of were attracted to the romance of moving to New York City so we decided to move there instead The four friends rented apartment together and ran the website out of their spare bedroom For the first three or four months it was just the four of us so we sort of just got out of bed walked yards over to our office and just worked until we got tired and then we put on clothes and go get dinner remember it was a big shock when we got our first employee and we had to start wearing clothes to work and having normal business hours In The New Yorker published an article named The Funny Boys about College Humor and the guys behind it It certainly made clear that this wasnt fluke That we were very ernest business people very ernest entrepreneurs who thought very carefully about the things we were making Within a few months of the article being published they had a bookdeal and a movie in the works Our office grew think until we were like or people it stayed in our apartment and then when we could afford it we got the next floor above our apartment so we would take an elevator up the building to our office and dont remember what the exactly the count was but think we had something like people before we had our first person above thirty and we had to hire that person because we needed an accountant and that was the youngest accountant we could find Vimeo started as a side project by Zach and one of the cofounders of College Humor Jakob Lodwick After hours they built the site and began experimenting with uploading short videos for their friends Vimeo is definitely my proudest work it is certainly the thing that took the most time designing actually havent had desire to design something since Vimeo remember having an office and having a door and sort of shutting my self off for six months while sort of iterated on this constantly We werent very sophisticated making websites then We didnt have any best practices We didnt know how we should be building the site collectively Jake and still considered very much a personal project and so he gave me a lot of space and time to make something was really proud of remember writing letters to my friends and family saying m sorry you dont know me anymore and that sort of thing because just sort of let all of my relationship go because nothing was important as this remember breaking broke up with a girlfriend cause had no time or interested really it was really more of an interest thing Nothing was exciting to me as this thing Knowing that there were tenths of thousands of people using the service and in love with it and waiting to see what we could do next In a big Internet company acquired both College Humor and Vimeo After being a side project for a time in Zach and Jakob got the goahead from Vimeo became a fulltime fully funded startup The website user base was growing steadily but in Zach decided to leave the company think what it was there was something the entrepreneurial spirit had been sucked out of the company because we were know own by such a massive company that was making a lot of decisions for us and felt myself being squeezed into this role of just a designer and didnt really learnt design because that was just the easiest way to make myself useful to the process of building those companies but wanted to learn so much more and had money for the first time in my life and never wanted to work on the Internet just for the sake of working on the Internet There were a lot of things that wanted to do so left to do them So buying some wood and building cabins with my friends here is something wanted to spend time doing so thats what left to do Zach now spends most his time living in the woods without electricity and unreachable by phone ve lived in this cabin behind me for a year for about half the year spend three or four days of the week down in New York cause m still involved with Internet and then another three or four days m here and there is usually dont know to people with me just to sort of make a little place that we all can spend time doing whatever we want to do came to this place think primarily because love the outdoors have always wanted a place like this but keep coming back because it is in this place feel the most creative recently My entire career have just been spent online pushing pixels around and there is something novel and thrilling for me to build with wood and stone with my friends To iterate with these materials To make physical things we can use that we can be inside of and other people look at them cant recreate that sense of pleasure working online cant explain it dont think it is permanent It is just right now this is where m most inspired The most interesting place to be is the place that allows you to become very singularly focused and when you are that way you are really at your peak and think it is when you are the most comfortable with your self think it when you are the most attractive to other people that you are bound to be interested in and you sort of become magnetized You just find other people who are also driven to make or to think the same things and it puts you in a really creative place where there is no fear Where people are just really happy about the things that you are making together and it is in this space that think you achieve the greatest things creatively Success is what you make of it mean know some of the most successful entrepreneurs can be unhappy So think for me to be a successful entrepreneur is both having a work and life balance You know want to be successful but at the same time want to live life Dont be indirect about how you think Dont take a job to go somewhere else If you want to be in Silicon Valley and you want to do a startup go to Silicon Valley and do a startup and dont let anyone stop you because when you get out here it is a whole new world of all kind of possibilities So many people have the wrong idea that they have to follow some kind of path Do your Build your initial prototype and then pitch it and have a initial customer It doesnt matter Everybody start a company in a different way If you are to follow another guys path you arent being a true entrepreneur The most comforting thing to me again was just the fact that all these people that are on magazine covers they started out just like you in their twenties with no experience and they were able to figure things out That think should give comfort to anybody who is excited about starting a company You cant teach entrepreneurship you either are an entrepreneur or youre not think if you are youre going to end up doing it and that is just who you are You cant change that As long as you have passion for something and some fundamental core idea think that you should just hone in on that and really do everything you can to explore that Follow your heart Follow the things that really matters to you If you do that you will become a big success There has never ever been a better time to do it than today You know youre only young once Life is too short to give it up If you got the opportunity to do something like this you owe it to yourself you owe it to the world owe it to your children to take this as far as you can Not say you are going to wait until after college or prepare yourself to become entrepreneur or to take classes even about entrepreneurship but just to it while you are still taking classes and to not give any excuses for building a company because no matter what you could come up with excuses The hardest thing is just to start
