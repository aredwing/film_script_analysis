should have stayed home in bed Good morning ladies and gentlemen of the radio audience This is Mike Frankovitch speaking to you directly from the central observation point for the most extensive army maneuvers ever attempted by the United States in peacetime Just remember youre being watched by umpires by staff officers whose duty it will be to report on the conduct of every company Unofficially can tell you that the company receiving the best report will be named top company of this regiment How can the umpire figure out the right answer if we dont really shoot the other guy Thats easy Everybody knows that All you do is you tell him With a book of rules For example if of our men of the white army catch up with men of the blue army we outnumber them so weve captured them They cut loose five of their tanks against one of ours our tank is destroyed We have a plane that drops a flour sack that is supposed to be a bomb If it lights on a battery of field artillery the battery is wiped out You understand Yeah but how do know if get killed The umpire hangs a sign on you reading This mug is as dead as he looks You see thats the only way they could All the latest developments in mechanized air and land equipment are being employed in this extensive maneuver Present here to observe these maneuvers in addition to commanding officers of the two opposing armies are high ranking officials of the War Department as well as military observers from Central and South America Take cover over here on signal men All right up Wait a minute Wheres Herbie Wheres Herbie how did you get up in that tree How did get up in the tree sat on it when it was an acorn Mmmmmmmmmmm Mike Latest reports from the front indicate that the blue army is rapidly approaching the Schuylerton Reservoir and it appears certain that they will gain control of that vital spot and be declared the winner of these maneuvers Men three miles west of here is a blockhouse Thats a marker for the Schuylerton Reservoir Our section has been given the vital job of getting to that blockhouse and blowing it up before it can be surrounded by the blue army Weve got orders here to split up into three patrols of four men Each patrol will attempt to gain the objective from a different approach One must get through and blow up that blockhouse before its captured by the blue army Now the first patrol Corporal
