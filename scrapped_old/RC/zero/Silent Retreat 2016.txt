Children could you come back to the table All of a sudden came the thunder of hooves rushing up the path dark figure in a black cloak rode its horse toward the porch The old man walked down the front stairs And the cloaked figure stopped his horse just outside the pool of light that was being cast by the lanterns hung above the porch The old man staggered back Shot twice once in the neck and the other in his chest The dark figure rose up onto his horse and fled down the Lane disappearing into the night Friends rushed to the old mans aid but it was already too late The first shot had bored a quarter sized hole Nows your chance To a chamber What the hell are you talking about Chicks get super turned on when theyre scared Like you would know Trust me Both times scored the chick was either drunk or scared think one of the times she was both Alright Hey hey Zac Just in case Thanks Tedi Do you guys mind No Sorry It was just getting really good Dale Please continue Thanks Now as was saying so much blood poured from the old mans wounds that a thick pool formed underneath his head He coughed once And then again the second being a hideous gurgling sound as though two invisible hands were choking the old man to death squeezing the very life out of him The sound sent a shiver up the spines of everyone who heard the old mans last dying breath Hey Dales ghost story getting to you Oh yeah

Have you told Dale No didnt want to spoil his fun whole hell of a lot of fun Should we go back in If we have to From that day on the servants couldnt keep the porch clean Every few weeks a damp pool of blood would appear in the same spot where the old man had died They tried repainting the porch several times but the blood stain would always bleed through One night one of the servants saw something that caused him to go mad Folks said that the house was haunted by the angry spirit of the old man The house was sold several times but each time the residents were driven out by the horrible gasping breaths of the old mans ghost and the hideous blood stain that could never be removed The house was eventually abandoned until just last year One year ago today in fact When it was completely remodeled and turned into Tearlon lodge Youre so full of it Dale had you going dont know thought the story was pretty good Up until the end because think heard that one before Yeah Good one
