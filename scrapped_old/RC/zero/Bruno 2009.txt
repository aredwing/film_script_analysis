most famous stars in the world Tom Cruise John Travolta Kevin Spacey they all had one thing in common They were all straight To become famous would have to quit guys Ich just needed to find a cockaholics anonymous Things have got to change want to become straight Awesome Once m straight can still play the clarinet If it doesnt remind you about some of the behaviour that you engaged in when you put your lips around it If it doesnt remind you of that then say go for it and play the clarinet with everything inside of you If it does remind you of that then say put it down give it away let a friend hold it until you know in your mind youre ready to pick it up again and it wouldnt remind you of that Und what about if put a flute up my stinker That wouldnt do that either because it would remind you of the former lifestyle So you dont put any woodwind instruments up your Arschwitz Absolutely not You know why Why Because that would harm my body That would hurt Only if you lose the reed Okay Well that would That would be bad Is there any music that shouldnt listen to Any bands Sinead Connor The Indigo Girls Of course the Village People When become straight you know a Kuntmeister are there any new hobbies that should take up Do you enjoy hiking Lifting weights Sure Man theres nothing like just working out and lifting weights and building your muscles around some other men who are not gay m totally irresistible to gay guys They see me und they want to schtupp me Right So how do protect against those guys If they get close to you hit them and leave the situation How do you spot the homosexual Very hard to do Because some of them dont even dress no different than myself or you Amazing You know Its kind of like terrorists If a terrorist has infiltrated a police department and he dresses like the policemen how would you know thats him What are obvious things that we can look for Obvious is a person thats being extremely nice to them to start with So if someone approaches you in the street und is being very very nice to you you know that they are a homosexual Most likely How should protect myself from being attacked by homosexuals They probably would attack from behind So again if am a homosexual and m just trying to run in und kiss you Boom You done moved in the wrong range Right Lets say the homosexual has got you on the ground Okay Und the homosexual you know has got you down here Right go to pull this down want to lock this lock this leg here Touching Yeah Hit with the elbow Boom As roll across How do you protect yourself from a dildo So lets say m trying Here you know Like that You know Und disarm the dildo Yes Is it harder to defend against a black dildo No Great One is just as easy as the other to defend against So m attacking Boom Like that Lets say go down and Trap it work the knees Work the elbows How do you defend yourself against the man with dildos Coming in Here Boom Depending on his range Boom Then to his face Boom Okay Kick around boom He cant do nothing from there And if hes just running with his pants down Here Boom And then to the eyes Homosexual attacking your bum Leg here And then come in and break his arm Take it here take him out Break his arms Boom break his ribs Break his arms Okay Thank you very much Fantastisch Okay Its very useful Thats just totally different than what ve ever tried to you know work with So
