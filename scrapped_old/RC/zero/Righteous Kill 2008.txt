Spider So Did he Yeah he got him down on the ground The guy was handcuffed And he just started kicking him in the gut And then he gets down on the guys chest and he really starts smacking him hard in

Okay there was a gun found on Charles Randall when he was arrested Yeah Now in all the other shootings the gun was left at the scene but there are a lot of similarities So l mentioned it to Perez and

Teddy where the fuck were you man Anything else you want to tell us Lieutenant Baum l got something for you in my pocket Huhuh passport credit card receipts boarding passes The day Brady was killed l was escorting a client to Brazil Judgment is the dominion of the Lord And if this person this worthless rapist or murderer as you describe him if he is truly repentant and seeks absolution it must be granted to him Your name doesnt ring a bell but lve had so many altar boys over the years So many altar boys that its hard to remember their names My name is David Fisk Detective First Grade You may not remember me now but l guarantee youll remember my name for the rest of your life Father Connell may he rot in hell White underwear below the knee Briefsstyle Large tweezers l am removing a card

you What about Spider Yeah And for looking in on me at the hospital and the encouragement Why would he want that After a while getting away with it isnt enough So is your daughter on the team No she used to play but now shes living in California five years sober and working as a nurse And her mother Her mother died when she was very young He wants everybody to know that he got away with it to show everybody just how brilliant he is Most of these killings were criminals in Roosters and his beat right And then he all but threatens to kill Van Luytens in front of hundreds of witnesses And then he sends us on this crazy wild goose chase after Lieutenant Baum didnt he Yes he did Why would he do that Why You gotta show me more than that So far you got shit Give him more man You want more How about the church records The very ones that Turk was so diligently pursuing How about that lt turns out our most recent victim the late Father Connell was moved all over the place eight parishes in years Why would they do that with a Catholic priest lts obvious Hes giving the children more than communion behind the altar Now Turk already admits to knowing this guy as a child lts very plausible This priest this Father Connell he gave you your first holy communion eh He did Did he every try to do anything inappropriate l mean l know what you mean No never Okay fine ls there any reason why somebody out there might think that he did No Am l a suspect here Lieutenant No but these bodies are starting to smell lot of it is drifting in your direction Drifting or being pushed What
