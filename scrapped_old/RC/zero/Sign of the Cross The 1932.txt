Christian girl Tell me Even this girl who parades as innocence and purity and is the scum of Rome Poppaea Why youre angry You misunderstand have no serious interest in the girl Oh dont be stupid All Rome knows that shes in your house and Rome is laughing about it Well Sit close to me Marcus ve loved you Youve never returned that love Youve hardly been friendly Oh know You havent wanted a vile court intrigue with me havent either particularly But what else is there So ve waited thinking youve kept away out of loyalty to Nero and that finally you would comfort me in spite of it So ve waited being jealous and hurt while you played with a dozen less admirable women But this is different Knowing cared for you youve preferred to make a fool of yourself over this Christian outcast Yes you are right am loyal to the Emperor Too loyal to aspire to an intrigue with the Empress Is that evasion No its the truth Then shall go on hoping to make you forget that loyalty If cant someday to my shame may command you to forget Your pardon Empress Marcus Marcus Do you love this girl Answer me Well then dont know That says you perhaps do could laugh with Rome about it if didnt care so much Marcus Superbus caught at last by a Christian wanton Youve no right to call her that Oh very much in love Well why not Its not so impossible so laughable Shes young beautiful virtuous find m sick of patrician women who havent heard of virtue Thats a direct enough insult couldnt avoid it never saw a man who held his life so cheaply That sounds like a threat ve never threatened with you shant unless you drive me to it The game is dangerous enough without my threats Tigellinus knows what youve done No citizen can protect a Christian from the law Well in this case cant stop to remember the law Then shall make you stop to remember me Youll give up this girl Marcus Will Yes Youll forget about her entirely ve stayed too long Empress They were meeting openlyconspiring openly against your life and Marcus wouldnt permit them to be killed Do make myself understood Caesar Yes My head is splitting The wine last night the music the delicious debauchery Caesar will Marcus go so far as your overthrow and your death Why are you always frightening me like that Plots against my life Death rides in the street with me he eats out of my plate Marcus took them to prison and there released the most dangerous of them That cant be true How much further will he go ll stop him right here ve been too lenient ll make an example of Marcus order him to be seized shant rest until hes dead Until who is dead Poppaea Do you know what Marcus has done Yes think its very amusing You m telling you hes turned traitor Hes released some dangerous Christians Oh just one pretty little Christian girl not dangerous to anyone except Marcus himself But beloved Marcus is just a man with a thrilling weakness He took this girl to his house Hes such a willful energetic boy Rome is amused and youre alarmed Shame on you Caesar the edict was not obeyed Yes Can you be amused at that Poppaea can because it was the girls fault Destroy the girl not your most devoted reliable officer Simply give Tigellinus an order to take her out of Marcus hands Nero beloved dont listen to everyone when you have me Youll make a blunder someday that will make people laugh at you the same as theyre laughing at Marcus now m not at all well Poppaea know You had such an exciting night There now relax Caesar if How can you disturb our beloved Emperor when hes feeling so badly If its the order for the girl youre concerned

honor that she shall never menace the people of Rome nor your own most sacred life Only let her live It must be love that has made Marcus so lenient of Christians Yes do love her If this one Christian life will make our Marcus happy Is Nero justice in the Roman world or merely a puppet Emperor What If he is justice then not even one Christian can be spared if Christians are to be killed Empress have mercy Poppaea is right Marcus m afraid its impossible It must be possible Caesar This must be made possible to me No faithful subject would ask it do ask it And Nero has no more loyal subject than You Empress who knows better than you that have been faithful to the Emperor have the right to ask have obeyed and honored you have risked my life in your service And all that shall ever ask for
