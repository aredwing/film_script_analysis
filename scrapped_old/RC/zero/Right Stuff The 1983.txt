There was a demon that lived in the air They said whoever challenged him would die Their controls would freeze up Their planes would buffet wildly and they would disintegrate The demon lived at Mach on the meter miles an hour where the air could no longer move out of the way He lived behind a barrier through which they said no man could ever pass They called it the sound barrier Then they built a small plane the to try and break the sound barrier And men came to the high desert of California to ride it They were called test pilots and no one knew their names Okay Whiskey Kilo prepare to drop Roger Ground Control This is Whiskey Kilo lowering and launching now Mach Hit a mild buffet there Mach do you want to declare an emergency Negative is not Go away was looking at the pictures on your wall How come a fancy pilot like Slick there doesnt have his picture up there What do you have to do to get your picture up there You have to die sweetie Well Yeager you old bastard Dont just stand in the doorway like some lonesome sheepherder Get your ass over here and have a drink got you something Come here You could be the first The man who breaks the sound barrier will be on top Youd be the one they remembered Youre the best civilian pilot around Good afternoon You get that helmet It might work ll look like the Galloping Ghost in it Some people say the sound barrier cant be broke An engineer will tell you its an absolute like the firmness of the earth The sound barrier is a farm you can buy in the sky The controls will freeze up You cant budge the stick Anybody tries to break it will auger in Well now maybe it cant be broke Then again maybe it can Maybe it can only be broke for a specified sum How much Come on Slick give us a break Nonnegotiable as usual What do we do now That guy in the corner Yeager is his name Hes some kind of a war hero Shot down five Germans in one day Hes a naturalborn stickandrudder man Hes pressliaison man for the Air Force think Any problems with him Only one Whats that Holding him back Major Hey there Yeager Sir We were just talking to Slick about the sound barrier Is that right We feel that the is ready to have a go at it We think the s got the answer to go beyond Mach If there is any beyond So what do you think ll tell you Half these engineers have never been off the ground They might tell you that the sound barriers a brick wall Itll rip your ears off if you try to go through it If you ask me dont believe the damn thing even exists Waitress a drink for Mr Yeager No thanks got one So do you think you want to have a go at it might But since as you say this sound barrier doesnt really exist how much How much you got Just joking The Air Force is already paying me Right Why sure Yeager So when do we go How about tomorrow morning ll be there See you there How much are you paying him think its week month Well thats not bad First fellow to break the sound barrier gets a free steak with all the trimmings ll have mine medium rare please Honey you ever been caught on the desert alone never have dont think ever will Never met the man who could catch me out there m half jackrabbit Forget it flyboy Youd never catch me

to Los Angeles Who are you calling The press This is big news The sound barriers been broken No sir No press No word of this is to go beyond the flight line Whats going on This is big news We need coverage of this No sir Sorry no press Those are orders National security But the wars over Look pal maybe they dont want someone to know Who The Russians maybe But theyre our allies Well anyway someone figured it out that way and thats the way it is Chuck youre our man Youre the fastest man alive We want you to fly more planes for us We want you to fly all our planes What you been doing hedgehopping Word will get out Major Maybe not to the press or the general public But soon every fighter jock rocket ace and ratracer in the country will be headed this way wanting to push the outside of the envelope and get to the top of the pyramid Edwards Air Force Base This is the place to be hon Theyre going faster farther and higher here than anywhere else ll tell you something else too Well climb right up that ladder just like we did at Langley We You mean you Hon were a team move up you move up Right to the top of the old pyramid Slow down Gordo Come on now youre scaring the girls Youre scaring the girls You are Come on Trudy Whos the best pilot you ever saw Whos the best pilot you ever saw Youre looking at him baby Come on cheer up Hey have ever let you down Hi there pops Panchos eh Damn look whos here Deke thats men in the last weeks You know what that averages Is that Gus Grissom from Langley Field What is an ace like you doing in a place like this Well if it aint Hot Dog Gordo Cooper right Yeah Gordo thinks hes one of those hotdog pilots you hear so much about You got a short memory am not one of them hotdog pilots am the Hot Dog Man himself guess youre too shy to tell this guy how used to wax your tail Wax my tail Hot Dog you were just in my shadow Thats where youll always be What are you two rookies going to have Rookies Now hold on sis You are looking at a whole new ballgame here now In a few years bet youre even going to immortalize us by putting our pictures up there on your wall Did say something wrong ll tell you We got two categories of pilots around here We got your prime pilots that get all the hot planes And we got your pudknockers who dream about getting the hot planes Now what are you two pudknockers going to have Scotch You know what happened The machine broke It didnt its the man He was dead before he went up Dont talk about it here Good one Now fire it in here Look at old Yeager On top of the pyramid for five goddamn years Every time somebody goes faster he just goes up again He stays the fastest man alive You know sometimes all it takes is just the sound of a truck starting think Thats the crash truck Anyway m really glad we could talk thought was the only one who had these nightmares Yeah Me too Nobody ever wants to talk about anything around here Everybodys always trying to maintain an even strain Well you marry a fighter jock and you marry the military ll tell you one thing The military owes me for all this One day expect the military to make good Well it sure aint your average dull life went East for a reunion and all my friends could talk about was their husbands work How dogeatdog and cutthroat it was on Madison Avenue places like that Cutthroat wondered how they would have felt if each time their husband went in to make a deal there was a one in four chance he wouldnt come out of the meeting m going home to my folks in San Diego What did Gordo say He maintained an even strain Look at them Youd think they were talking about sports Men Sometimes theyre just such assholes Sometimes they sure are handy assholes though Yeah sometimes Sometimes You want a hot dog m leaving Gordo Look at that Yeah thats the Phase Two Scott Crossfield It sure as hell is Jesus He scorched that one didnt he Hes pushing the outside of the envelope He must be going for a record Hes shooting for Mach heard On the th anniversary of the Wright Brothers historic flight another historic flight takes place as Scott Crossfield streaks across the skies over the high desert in California Mach Almost miles per hour and a new world record Its a field day for the press Congratulations come from a previous record holder as he shakes the hand of the fastest man alive Scott Crossfield And theres a comradeship of speed To Scott Crossfield the fastest man alive To the Phase Two ll tell you a quick one The one about the newlyweds who didnt know the difference between Vaseline and putty All their windows fell out Compliments of Panchos Scotty The real test wasnt Mach guess that demon lives out at about on your Mach meter Yeah but Mach was the magic number Like homers like batting like the fourminute mile The press likes a nice round number After that they dont care until the next magic number You need more than speed records You need coverage Coverage You mean them root weevils that crawl around popping off cameras Those root weevils write history Let them write the history and let the pilots fly the planes Pilots You know what really makes your rocket ships go up The aerodynamics would take so long to explain to you that Funding Thats what makes your ships go up ll tell you something And you guys too No bucks no Buck Rogers Whoever gets the funding gets the technology Whoever gets the technology stays on top Flyboy lets dance ll drink to that Hell be going after Crossfield soon wont he No he wont Hell be going after that demon that lives in the thin air You got any Beemans Even before you hit Mach shell be unforgiving on you So take it easy Wring her out a little bit this time You got any gum Yeah got me a stick Loan me some ll pay you back later Fair enough Thank you Okay drop her All right here we go again Drop Number coming on Got seven seconds on right now ve got you in sight Chuck Going out of sight now Mach Number Here goes Mach Sorry Scotty You got her now buddy You can ease it back Bring it on in m pushing the envelope See where that demon lives Come in Chuck Say again Over Do you read Over Damn Hes uncorked it Mayday Mayday Alert all ground crews Talk to me Mayday Mayday Alert the ground crews Come in Do you read me Over m fighting bad here m down to over Tehachapi dont know if can make it back to base or not What happened Think must have bust the canopy with my head m getting okay now We sure chased that old demon this time Thats as fast as a man can go Whats next Ridley Its called Sputnik We know Sit down And as was saying whoever controls the high ground of space will control the world The Roman Empire controlled the world because it could build roads Later the British Empire was dominant because it had ships In the air stage we were powerful because we had the airplane Now the Communists have established a foothold in outer space Soon theyll have space platforms to drop nuclear bombs on us like rocks from a highway overpass How the hell did they get ahead of us Gentlemen think were ready Is there a loose plug over there anywhere Here it is ll get it Senator Johnsons right This is Armageddon The decisive battle between the forces of good and evil Were engaged in a struggle for survival This footage was assembled from sources operating under deep cover at great risk Very great Were fortunate this material did not perish with a couple of men This is secret footage of the Russian Korabl rocket and these are the German scientists that they captured after the war Was it their German scientists who got them up there first No it was not Senator Our Germans are better than their Germans Thats Titov on the right and on the left is Gagarin No Titovs on the left Gagarins on the right They bear a great resemblance to each other If the Soviets ever do put a man up there it will be one of these two Most likely the one on the left Gagarin Titov Isnt that their chief designer We know very little about him Let us see him again Heres some more of him Theyve developed a program of stupendous dimensions and he is clearly the genius behind it for one do not intend to go to sleep by the light of a Communist moon Get that moron off of there We could have orbited a satellite a year ago if we had been given a green light Now we must get something up there quick and dirty any way at all Well what By combining our available rockets the Redstone the Atlas agree that we could launch a pod pot pod capsule Now we will be in full control of this pod It will go up like a cannonball and come down like a cannonball splashing down in the ocean with a parachute to spare the life of the specimen inside Spaceman Specimen Well what kind of specimen tough one Responsive to orders had in mind a chimp Jimp Well what the hell is a jimp chimp chimpanzee Senator An ape The first American into space is not going to be a chimpanzee Who would you put into space Mr President We have film of some people we think are strong candidates Wed like to run it by you and stimulate some thinking These are people we felt would be excellent in the splashdown We like the one on the right No on the left On the right Dont embarrass me These people are very experienced with machinery and have their own helmets Is that a factor As youll see theyre quite comfortable in conditions of flame Now this is personnel who have very welldeveloped equilibrium Good middle ear Also very nice people Very easy to work with With some work they could be very responsive to orders This is my first choice The man with the hood Since he works without eyesight his other senses are sharpened In space therell be little need for eyeballing at any rate The cannonball effect you mentioned We were basically thinking about putting a couple into orbit Possibly adds emotional stability This individual combines many plus factors that we mentioned Ease with flames comfort at heights and agility in the splashdown phase Also he is available as of the th want test pilots Test pilots No you cant deal with them m sure we can do better with another type of man any other type of man more manageable type It will only complicate things With a man we must guarantee a safe return Mr President think youd be wise to reconsider No Lyndon Test pilots Well be heading for some air bases Not just some air bases The one with the great test pilots Theres only one place to go was there once before and hoped d never have to go back Its a godforsaken spot on the roof of the high desert in California prehistoric throwback of an airfield called Edwards Theyve got a weird madmonk squadron They live in rat shacks terrible conditions Corrugated tin bare bones low rent This is the joint they hang out in Panchos Happy Bottom Riding Club Its called Happy Bottom Riding Club Howd it get a name like that Ask Pancho Lock up Yeah Were meeting the Liaison Officer They are expecting us They Whos they The best Give me that The best test pilots in the world Here They got some kind of brotherhood They think they got the right stuff What stuff Heroism bravery There any snakes around here Yeah In the bushes Heroism and bravery are part of it But seems to be more to it What do they say it means They dont say anything They dont talk about it They dont talk about it to outsiders To each other To outsiders they say even less Anyway theyre all here Including the ace of aces himself Whos that Yeager Never heard of him These must be our gentlemen from Washington scouting for astronauts Welcome to Edwards Scouting for lab rabbits more likely didnt quite hear you said Lab rabbits Whats that mean It means you dont need honesttoGod pilots What you ought to get is a lab rabbit to curl up in your damn capsule with its heart beating and a wire up the kazoo dont hold with it dont either You want a pilot to be a ballistic missile And then splashdown Possibly get lost at sea Theres some things you cant change Some peckerwoods got to take the beast up And some peckerwoods got to land it And that peckerwood is called a pilot Youre mighty right The boys smell panic in your program Thats one thing they dont respond to Now maybe if we talk privately to Yeager and some of the other boys Thats Yeager Anybody goes up in the damn thing is gonna be Spam in a can ll drink to that Yeager doesnt fit the profile Yeager doesnt fit He didnt go to college Were only taking college personnel Forget about Walker and Crossfield and the other civilian pilots too The security clearance just takes too long with those people Besides they seem a little too independent You mean for this space race you dont want our best pilots didnt say that We want the best pilots that we can get all want some whiskey No thanks Fred Just a little coffee d like a CocaCola Coke In a clean glass Theres an old saying Never refuse a combat assignment Well there sure is a long line of shithot rocket aces around here Hey Hot Dog What the hells astronaut mean anyway Star voyager Star voyager Gus Grissom like the sound of that Now your name is My name Jos Jimnez Who are we gonna get to take on the Russians Have you seen this Jos Jimnez Hes a crackup am the chief astronaut of the United States Interplanetary My name Jos Jimnez Now see you have some of your space equipment with you What is that called The crash helmet Oh hope not Get that guy off The countrys already laughing at us This is the show wanted you to see Who that kid Winner of five Distinguished Flying Crosses and holder of the coasttocoast nonstop supersonic flight record from the Marine Corps Major John Glenn That guy Can you tell us whats that song Straighten Up and Fly Right Its Straighten Up and Fly Right Hes not dumb Major Eddie here has a little problem with his girlfriend Did you ever have a problem like that when you were ten Yes did Bob liked a girl in my class but the other guys liked her too and she didnt pay attention But kept after her Eddie Did you finally get her to notice you Yes did In fact finally got her to marry me They love the guy Delta Charlie you are clear to land at degrees Jos Jimnez on approach My name Jos Jimnez Yeah Shepard forgot You are clear at degrees Some boys here want to talk to you about being an astronaut They want to make me an astronaut Oh hope not Are you sure the Navys got good pilots They call them aviators in the Navy They say theyre better than pilots Gentlemen d like you to meet Alan Shepard What d like you to meet Alan Shepard Just the man we came to see Well Pleasure Youve heard about our project Were going up against the Russians Its got the highest Priority Its a hazardous undertaking In fact its extremely hazardous Its so hazardous that if you decide not to volunteer it will not be held against you in any way Sounds dangerous It is Count me in Theres nothing to worry about Absolutely nothing Why are you doing this to me m afraid theres no simple way to explain that to you Thank you Number Number please Youre gonna love it Please Sit right there Put your arm right up here Excuse me are you John Glenn Scott Carpenter recognize you from those shows like them had a good time doing them guess were both here for the same reason You know what theyve got planned No Let me check it out What have you got scheduled Were not really free to reveal all the testing dont get this Sending us down here disguised as civilians Come on Gus cut it out What the hell Hot Dog this entire operations supposed to be hushhush We got topsecret orders to blend in with the patients So shut up There might be Russian agents here They dont look very Russian to me Gus All we got here is your local gentry and then you got Navy and Marine pilots over here None of these guys is up to Air Force standards hear they got some some guys trying out for seven spots After they pick us three theres only gonna be four spots Sounds right to me Where do we go next You go in that door Who are you My name Jos Jimnez You talking to us buddy All Air Force pilots go in that door When they all go in they all look the same But when they all come out they all look different Hows that Fellow said hows that When they all come out they all look scared Buenos das Gonzlez Buenos das yourself Would you come this way That guy didnt fool me a bit That Mexican guy That guys Navy all the way Theres another swabbo ll open the box a little so you can see Dont put your fingers in there This thing will bite them off Its vicious Real swabbo sense of humor Lets see what there is to be scared about back here The ball must be maintained in the position between these two lines You may begin now The record is seconds Ninetythree seconds Read it and weep Terrific Scott Darn good You were probably just getting warmed up Next time doubt d win dont know about that Were competing with Archie and Jughead Let me out of here Let me out Gus got this whole thing figured out The drill here Number The drill here is to see who can drill the brains out of Nurse Murch Nineteen Youre nuts She thinks were all just miserable pudknockers This is one fighter jock who is not a miserable pudknocker Shes a woman susceptible to charms like all of the rest You want what in there Sperm What for Sperm motility factors Yeah but Nurse how am supposed to The best results seem to be obtained through fantasization accompanied by masturbation followed by ejaculation That sounds easy enough ll tell you what If get stuck you mind coming in and helping me out a little bit Please return it to the lab Hey cut out the humming in there Okay knock it off in there Okay Glenn know thats you Just knock it off because m trying to concentrate in here That was quick Theres plenty more where that came from You want to see me again d like to meet your wife My wife Youre married arent you Yeah sure m married all right Happily Yeah real stable relationship too d like to meet your wife Youd like to meet my wife Tomorrow Tomorrow Tomorrows no good Tomorrow need you Trudy m talking about a whole new ballgame Fresh start This astronaut thing is the best way for us to move up that ladder If we play our cards right we go all the way to the top We You mean you mean we Were a team Have ever let you down Yeah Whos the best pilot you ever saw Youre looking at him Youre all set told her you were stable well adjusted attentive persevering lied That a girl Whatd she say She laughed She knows you too well Gordo Lets face it Some women just have a problem with men Yeah know At secret locations throughout America fiftysix of our greatest pilots are at this moment vying to be one of the first men to go into space These are the most uptodate tests imaginable This is the most rigorous physical testing ever done to human beings Theyre being subjected to every stress our doctors and engineers can invent These men are preparing themselves for the ordeal of capsule life They will be guiding a new machine through a hostile environment They will be faced with emergencies no man can foresee Many are called but few will be chosen These are men who will have to face any danger for their country No individual will have ever been so adequately prepared for an event Each man knows that whoever survives this competition is destined to become a legend in his own time Here hold this And hold this like this When the clamp is released the balloon inside you deflates Deflates Wheres the john Two floors up Gonzlez will take you there but wait here with him Hows it going Gonzlez Faster Good day Commander You prick Push the button Me and my friends think your Jos Jimnez imitation is okay But what youre doing with it is bad Youre right youre absolutely right Open You ever have any explosions doing this All the time Its a mess Tell me something else Mr Gonzlez How am doing think youre gonna make it think youre gonna be an astronaut After a long and unprecedented series of evaluations which told our medical scientists of their superb adaptability to their upcoming flight it is my pleasure to introduce to you seven Americans gentlemen all Virgil Gus Grissom Leroy Cooper Donald Slayton John Glenn Junior Malcolm Carpenter Alan Shepard Junior Walter Schirra Junior Americas Mercury astronauts Holy shit Smile Gus Were heroes Yeager ought to see this Seven rookies being installed as the hottest fliers and they havent done a thing but show up for a press conference Following the distribution of the kits those of you who have pm Deadlines better dash to your phones Now well have some questions from the press please d like to know whether your wives and children had anything to say about this Mine think its fine Theyre all for it dont think any of us could go on with something like this if we didnt have pretty good backing at home My wifes attitude towards this has been the same as its been all along through my flying If its what want to do shes behind it And by golly my kids are too percent dont believe this But look at them out there Theyre eating it up was brought up believing that you are placed on Earth more or less with a proposition This is what still believe Were placed here with certain talents and capabilities and its up to each one of us to use those talents as best we can And if we use our talents properly think there is a power greater than us that will place the opportunities in our way When think of Orville and Wilbur Wright standing on a hill at Kitty Hawk North Carolina tossing a coin to see which one would take the first airplane flight and then think of us here today thank God live in a country where the best and finest in a man can be brought out d like to second some of the things Mr Glenn has said here think that we are all very very fortunate that we have been should we say blessed with the talents for something like this And think that we would be most remiss in our duty indeed if we did not volunteer for something as important as this is for our country and to the world in general right now One of our Air Force boys Dont you agree Deke absolutely agree with Gordo But were not saying anything new Were just saying the same things that need to be said again and again with fierce conviction Can you tell us if any of you go to church regularly As far as church goes attend regularly Which one of you will be the first into space The best will be first Share it brother Fucking bubba This is for Americas Life magazine These are the greatest pilots in America How much do they make a year Tops At the most With this one deal m giving them split seven ways over three years How does that sound Now want them all to meet my people who will write their true stories These stories will appear in Life under their own bylines For example by Betty Grissom or by Virgil Grissom Or Gus What was that Gus Nobody calls me by that other name Gus An astronaut named Gus Whats your middle name Lvan Maybe Gus isnt so bad Might be something there All right you can be Gus bet for all that money they could call you Virgil They sure could me Well whats with her She seems snobby dont get it get it Shes Mrs Clean Marine m going to the Cape tomorrow wish to heck it wasnt offlimits to wives Theres so much work to do anyway More tests training studying What about after After hours ll run a lot m going to get up to five miles a day Theres a beautiful long beach there Its called Cocoa Beach You can run forever Scott Carpenter will run with me Hes a good guy Hes real philosophical What about The others want to get the job done and keep the Mickey Mouse to a minimum Theyre good men Good men Theyll give percent when the time comes Guess they think m kind of a gungho type Eddie Attaboy Harry Hairshirt What you agree You agree My own wife Do you think m a Dudley Doright Thats me guess lonely beacon of restraint and selfsacrifice in a squall of carcrazies Its important to America to get a man up there first plan to be the first man to ride the rocket Four three two one Ignition What is the most important thing in rocket travel To me the most important thing is the blastoff always take a blast before take off Otherwise wouldnt go near that thing He loves Ed Sullivan Four down three to go dont want anything to put this program in a bad light We have the opportunity of a lifetime and m sorry but wont stand by and let other people compromise the whole darned thing You know and know this could lead to something very unfortunate m talking about the playing around thats going on m talking about the young girls m talking about the cookies m talking about keeping our pants zipped and our wicks dry Mr Glenn you are way out of line advise you not to try to foist your moral views on anyone else in this group Each man here has volunteered to do a job Each man is devoting long hours of training and doing many things above and beyond the call of duty such as morale tours of factories Such as bringing girls up to your room And forgoing any orderly family life Mr Glenn as long as a man uses good sense what he does with his wick is his own business m from Life magazine m not with these people You cant go in Theyre discussing scientific problems Johns right Whether we like it or not were public figures Whether we deserve it or not people look up to us We have a tremendous responsibility You cant tell a pilot what to do when hes not flying Wait a minute You got it all wrong The issue here aint pussy The issue here is monkey What Us We are the monkey What Gus is saying is that were missing the point Gus is saying that we all heard rumors they want to send a monkey up first None of us wants them to send a monkey up to do a mans work What Gus is saying is that what theyre trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkeys work Us bunch of collegetrained chimpanzees What Gus is saying is that weve got to change things around here Hes saying that we are pilots We know more about what we need to fly than anybody else So what we have to do is alter the experiment It comes down to who is going to control this thing from here on What Gus is saying here is that weve got to stick together on this These tests were designed to decondition to desensitize to adapt out fears Since we have developed a fully automated vehicle all we seek from the occupants of the capsule is data The socalled astronaut would merely be a redundant component And here you can see these chimps are capable of many of the same tasks as men And they are much more cooperative They are being put through every phase of the astronaut training As far as we are concerned the question still remains Which one will be first The man or the monkey We shall see Take it easy with that Where are you putting the window Window There is no window No window What about the hatch We need a hatch with explosive bolts that we can open ourselves Theres something you dont understand This is the final form of the capsule No hatch What would happen if the automatic controls went out With backups checks this would not happen said what would happen if it did The pilot would have to fly it back This is the way it is wonder how the press will feel about this The press What does the press have to say about this Do you boys know what makes this bird go up Funding makes this bird go up Thats right No bucks no Buck Rogers And the press over there They all want to see Buck Rogers And thats us Buck Rogers You see those fellows over there have been making us out as the seven finest and bravest pilots in all America If the story would come out in the press that we are not allowed to fly as pilots We want a window There could maybe be in future capsules a window here No thats where the hatch with explosive bolts goes The hatch with the explosive There could be a hatch with explosive bolts on the capsule That is a spacecraft sir We do not refer to it as a capsule Spacecraft hatch with explosive bolts on the spacecraft And there will be pitch and yaw thrusters to enable the occupant The pilot Astronautpilot The astronaut pilot to have some To have control of the reentry procedures We appreciate it You wouldnt mind if we had the press take a few photos of us would you Which one of you is going to be the first one to be launched into space Here he is Captain Ham Grinning like a possum eating a sweet potato Does he look like the kind of guy whod put doodoo in the capsule Ham in a can Americas first astronaut Look at him You take a monkey like this you can make him a democrat a politician think hes better looking than Crossfield How would you like to go up with this guy as your copilot Theyve got a man up there Its Gagarin We know Sit down All right give them a break Is it true you were ready to go and the flight was cancelled Is it true we couldve beaten the Russians Why didnt we send a man up instead of a monkey think we ought to be forthright gracious and magnanimous and say the Russians beat the pants off us No sense in kidding ourselves about it But the space age has begun and theres plenty of work Who will be the second man in space You mean who will be the first free man into space We know itll be Glenn Just tell us when Thats a secret m tired of being forthright gracious and magnanimous m tired of stupid questions from the press m tired of smocks of engineers telling us what we cant do m tired of everybody saying we are not pilots m tired of monkeys Most of all m sick and tired of being second to those those darned Russians Its time we Got someone up there Fucking bubba Exactly Lets talk to them Lets get this thing on the road m tired of messing around Well just tell em were ready Were ready to go In these three weeks since the Russian Gagarins flight surprised everybody one wretched event has followed another People have begun to say our rockets always blow up our boys always botch it Some say this is not the time to try desperate deeds to beat the Soviets The question really is Are we actually ready to launch a man into space And yet out here at this very moment sits a rocket waiting in the night Soon one American astronaut will climb atop that rocket in what may be the greatest deathdefying stunt ever broadcast The identity of Americas first astronaut has been kept a secret until almost the final moment The question everyone has asked is Which one will be first Not very funny John But do appreciate it John surely do Vaya con Dios Jos Dear Lord please dont let me fuck up didnt quite copy that Say again please said everythings okay Well thats what thought you said He said everything is okay He says everything is okay And there you have it Roger Auto retrojettison switch Retroheater switch off Retroheater switch off Landingbag switch auto Roger Landingbag switch auto This is it ladies This is for Life magazine My God Theyre going after the diaperservice man Stop that Stop it We dont have a diaperservice man Get back from the door dont know them really Oh Louise your lawn Leave those diapers alone Shut that door Why are they here What do they want We are here live at the house of Louise Shepard wife of Astronaut Al Shepard who is about to go into space Wanted to keep you informed Mrs Shepard Everythings okay Nothing to worry about Just some delays What kind of delays Theres another hold from another delay And Alan Shepard sits there patiently waiting What can be going through a mans mind at this moment have to urinate Urinate Urinate No We did not think of that This is only a minute flight The mans been up there for hours Could he do it in his suit It might be dangerous To introduce liquid into the pure oxygen of the capsule and the pressure suit might cause a short circuit It could start a fire No Tell him he cannot Listen old buddy they promise well stop at the next gas station Request that you remain in a holding pattern till then You sure you just want a little smidgen About a half a cup And nothing in it Thats fine All right Alan had four cups of coffee before he went to work this morning All this waiting is driving me crazy had a little accident Request permission to relieve bladder Look the man has got to go Its either that or we get the lug wrench and pry him out Do it in the suit Jos permission granted to wet your diapers anytime son Suit thermometer says Freon flow jumping from to Left lowerchest sensor No shortout Moving up back Well m a wetback now It is questionable if we can proceed m cooler than you are Why dont you fix your problems and light this candle Hes right Lets light this candle He surely is Light the candle Resume the countdown All systems go minus ten seconds nine eight seven Ignition Youre on your way Jos We have liftoff and the clock is operating think well be able to talk to one of the astronauts wives if not to Louise Shepard herself He has reentered the Earths atmosphere and the gforces should be building up Louise hes coming down We almost missed this Eight Thats nine m okay The Vice President who is Chairman of our Space Council and who bears great responsibilities in this field the members of the House and Senate Space Committee who are here today to award you this decoration which has gone from the ground up What was Jackie like Shes very nice We talked about all kinds of things My Gus goes up next cant wait to talk to Jackie after that Youll love her Shes so nice We talked about the kids Mr Shepard

America You proud boys Hey look They filled up the refrigerator Pretty good huh Pretty good full refrigerator can see this afternoon is shaping up just great And the rest of the day Tomorrow too What

recap yesterdays dramatic events here we see Americas newest hero Gus Grissom He is shouting to save the capsule first Pull that in flight test its all over for him He screwed the pooch partner Plain and simple Sometimes you get a pooch that cant be screwed The Presidents got his own problems with the Bay of Pigs He doesnt want the astronauts image tarnished Nothing these guys do is going to be called a failure These astronauts are our Davids Youd think the public would know theyre just doing what monkeys have done You think a monkey knows hes sitting on a rocket that might explode These astronauts know that ll tell you something It takes a special man to volunteer for a suicide mission Especially when its on Old Gus he did all right Though the capsule was lost our new hero Astronaut Gus Grissom was saved Now President Kennedy has started an even more ambitious space program Those who came before us made certain this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolution the first waves of modern invention and the first wave of nuclear power And this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space We mean to be a part of it We mean to lead it You know always hated flying When met you you were already a pilot so never had a complaint coming When you went up in those planes me and the kids We never had any insurance except a couple months pay always hated all that talk about insurance The government spends all kinds of time and money teaching pilots how to be fearless But they dont spend a penny teaching you how to be the fearless wife of a test pilot But guess liked it guess liked the kind of man who could push the outside of the envelope Flyboy But never could stand a man who was one of those rememberwhens Those bitter guys that just sit around thinking about old times If ever see that happen m going right out the front door And youll never catch me m a fearless man but m scared to death of you No youre not But you ought to be What is it The Russians have sent Titov up Titovs up How long day day whole day Hes orbiting over our country right now We need a man in orbit or its all over Were scrapping the Redstone and going with the Atlas You know what that means We havent had too much luck with that rocket We cant take all the precautions wed like Itll be dangerous Were ready said itll be dangerous said were ready percent Thank you Inside this trim modest suburban home is Annie Glenn wife of Astronaut John Glenn sharing the anxiety and pride of the world at this tense moment but in a private and crucial way that only she can understand The Vice President would like to see Mrs Glenn Hes asking for you again Tell them no m sorry she says no You dont understand It is very important The Vice President must see her We are told after the missions success the Vice President will come here and speak with Annie Glenn Meanwhile John Glenn waits for the weather to clear so he can undertake this historic mission You know what the Russians want They want our peckers in their pockets She still says no Didnt you tell her ll bring in Her words and mine will be heard by millions Where are they going think the flights been cancelled Cancelled Thats perfect will go in and console her on nationwide ll pay her a sympathy call The Vice President would like to make a sympathy call if he could No What do you

Presidents head of the program You must think of the program You are out of line m out of line Yes sir run the show here Well see about that And m thinking of changing the order of flight assignments Who will you get You heard what he said Take it easy fellows Step aside pal Pilots Pansies Cows Gladiolas Isnt there anybody who can deal with a housewife Waltzing Matilda thought Hank Williams wrote

fly overhead Up in outer space And ll be talking to him on that dish Fly over You blokes do that too You do that yourself Not me mate See that old bloke there He know He know the moon He know the star And he know the Milky Way Hell give you a hand He know Were gonna need all the help we can get Stand by for final tensecond count The clock is operating Were underway Good Lord ride all the way Godspeed John Glenn Zerog and feel fine The capsule is turning around The view is tremendous can see clear back a big cloud pattern towards the Cape Its a beautiful sight Roger Friendship You have a go at least seven orbits Roger Al Understand go at least seven orbits This is Friendship Speed is miles per hour and were moving into night Full moon rising can almost touch it Friendship come in Do you read Friendship come in please This sure was a short day Say again please Over That was the shortest day ve run into Kind of passes rapidly huh Yes sir can see some lights down there in Australia Gordo Where are they from All of Perth and Rockingham have turned their lights on for you And we have a few other lights turned on here and there They show up very well Thank everybody for turning them on will you We sure will John We sure will Heading towards daybreak Lot of cloud coverage today Man its beautiful Possibly its the heat shield Its loose If it comes off If the heat shield comes off hell burn up Hell fry when he tries to reenter Muchea this is Cape Were showing some trouble Weve got a warning light Possibly a loose heat shield Check your status lights immediately Hes coming John can you hear me Friendship come in please Try something Anything Friendship come in This is Friendship Do you read me Wait a second see something strange out here Oh My goodness what the heck is that Sparks and needles of some kind all over the sky Hey let me tell you what m in up here m in a mass of very small particles that are brilliantly lit up Like theyre luminescent never saw anything like it shower of them coming by me now Theyre bright yellow They swirl around the capsule and theyre brilliantly lighted Do you think they could be alive It sounds ridiculous but they look like fireflies or something Maybe some Air Force experiment went amuck Could our astronomers have been wrong Hello CapCom do you read me This is miraculous Could it be those fireflies or whatever they are Of course not Fireflies Roger Friendship Will you correlate the actions of the surrounding particles with that of your control jets Negative do not think they were coming from my control jets ll tell you what ll try to do ll try to get some pictures of these little guys Sounds like a good idea You guys probably think m nuts Theyre very beautiful Look like fireflies on a summer night They just dance around Get out of here Get out of here you gadgets Heading into daybreak now Another day Leaving the fireflies behind have no idea what they were This is Friendship That was some night That was really exciting Hes going into his third orbit How much longer are you going to keep him in the dark What do we tell him Hes a pilot Tell him the condition of his craft Glenn is in his third orbit and the flight is going pretty much as planned No human individual has ever been so well prepared So far the keyword on this textbook flight is operational Everything is okay We havent been too lucky with the Atlas rocket Some say we havent taken all the safety precautions wed like to Is this true No its absolutely not true The only critical point is the reentry If the capsule is not at the correct angle with the blunt end and heat shield down it will burn up There is only one hope It might be possible to leave the retrorocket package which covers the heat shield on The straps may be strong enough to hold the heat shield in place But if this fails John youre going to flybywire for reentry We recommend you do the best you can to keep a zero angle Over Reentry only three orbits Over That is correct Over Do you have a reason for this Over Not at this time This is the judgment of Cape Flight Roger Do you have a time for going to jettison retro Over We are not sure your landing bag is deployed We feel it is possible to reenter with the retropackage on We see no difficulty at this time with that type of reentry Do you read Roger Understand ll start lining up as carefully as can in a minute See whether scanners will pick up and correct it for good retrofire attitude If not ll correct it myself Roger Friendship Were lined up Here we go Whats that sound Humming Its him Its all right He does that John He cant hear you Hes hit the ionization blackout No communications are possible for a few minutes Then well know Friendship this is Cape Do you read This is Cape Do you read Friendship this is Cape Do you read Automatic systems are not functioning Hes in flybywire Finally showed up The one with the big engine Boy if wed only had one of those a few years back The bad news is the entire programs probably going to be scrapped From now on the astronaut boys in Houston have got the only ticket Barring of course some unforeseen event The Russians set a new record of feet going straight off the ground Nobody cares about that kind of record anymore All they want now is capsules up in outer space get a feeling this plane might be able to beat that Russian record You might be right And here they come Looky here what brought you Mr And Mrs John Glenn Alan Shepard Gus Grissom Scott Carpenter Deke Slayton Wally Schirra Mr And Mrs Gordon Cooper Smile hon My fellow citizens Americas Mercury astronauts Welcome to Houston your new home Your neighbors here and wed like to give you this little barbecue Texas style Since youre relocating here to show appreciation for

coming through the window Oh Lord what a heavenly light The Mercury program was over Four years later Astronaut Gus Grissom was killed along with Astronauts White and Chaffee when fire swept through their Apollo capsule But on that glorious day in May Gordo Cooper went higher farther and faster than any other American Twentytwo complete orbits around the world He was the last American ever to go into space alone And for a brief moment Gordo Cooper became the greatest pilot anyone had ever seen
