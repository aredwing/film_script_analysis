This is Forbes Field in Pittsburgh And this is our national pastime the game of baseball as played by the Pittsburgh Pirates didnt know a thing about baseball My usual job was writing the Household Hints column on the Ladies Page but the paper was running a series of articles Whats Wrong with the Pirates The Sports editor wanted the womans angle All knew was that Pittsburgh was losing This learned was quite normal Hes out The manager of the Pirates was a large man named Guffy McGovern who was always coming out to discuss things with the umpire was too far away to hear but he seemed upset irritated Maybe even angry Whats the matter with you He was safe by that much Do you hear me All right Watch your language or ll throw you out of the game There was certainly something wrong with the Pirates Take that time when Cincinnati was batting and that Pirate player got hit on the head with the ball That didnt seem right You couldve catch the ball Later in the game when the Pirates were hitting and had a good chance to score well even knew three runners on one base was too many Youre out Youre out Great thats the first time you three guys have been together all season The score at the end of the game was Cincinnati Pittsburgh You through Jenny havent even started How do you get a story You hit them on a bad day Yeah Yeah they had a good one back in Hey maybe should talk to McGovern Now Yeah thats a wonderful idea Everybody should talk to McGovern once How do get down there You see that second tunnel there Yeah Go down The door on the right is the Pirate clubhouse Thanks Thanks for letting me sit here Anytime And Jen give Guffy our best regards will Bye Bye What a dirty trick So ends another holocaust in Forbes Field The Pirates exhibition this afternoon reducing their standing to seventh place in the National League By the way ll not be with you for the balance of the season In the course of my sportscasts have somehow offended the great Guffy McGovern

time to send me dont know the game and havent any story But can tell you whats wrong with the Pirates that McGovern person Of all the loudmouthed offensive And all those nice cleancut young men and the way he bullies them No wonder they make mistakes anybody would If you ask me the Pittsburgh Pirates would be a lot better off without him And so would the city of Pittsburgh Hey write it Write

What a depressing job Think about me have to write about Guffy McGovern Now theres an obituary d like to handle Mr Kirney must have liked the story He even put my byline on it By Jennifer Paige Household Hints editor He wanted more of the same personal stuff about McGovern realized d have to do a little sleuthing found out where he lived one furnished room and kitchenette near the ballpark He had no known relatives never any visitors Every morning about he left for the field There were plenty of empty cabs cruising around but McGovern wanted the one without the driver He would Hail a cab Hail a cab This is the only hack in Pittsburgh You like the color You know the law sonny Youre supposed to stay with your cab Are you with it Forbes Field and make it snappy The bums dont start

Mindens and Beggs its the same right through the whole batting list Whered you gather this information Tim Durney helped me Hes the Obituary editor What do you hear from Want Ads Well realize figures

knew We did a lot of talking and made some big plans but they didnt include a certain shortstop the one she finally married It was quite a blow can imagine guess ve been taking it out on everybody else ever since Good night Good night Sister Is it always right to turn the other cheek Certainly Why Well Mr McGovern did last night and he got sloughed something awful The meek shall inherit the earth never missed a game after that In September the Pirates met the Giants in the final series They needed three straight games to win the pennant Stay there boy Make him pitch to you Two and two boy Make him pitch to you Guffy How do you feel Its nothing dont feel a thing Did it again didnt Why did have to go and wave at you Its nothing We won didnt we Where am having dinner mean where are you having dinner mean us Youre not going anyplace except home ve got a cab Hi Guffy Nice catch You okay Any injuries No no ve been hit in the head times feel fine Did you see any angels ve never seen an angel but talked to one What did you say You speak to angels Certainly Can we quote you Why not An angel sits in back of me in the dugout Oh Guffy Where they running Oh lets get out of here Sister Isnt it wonderful see them and Guffy talks to them Believe me gentle listener there is more to this than meets the eye Mr McGoverns antics on the field and off are no longer a source of amusement but a basis for serious inquiry His latest peccadillo an admission to the press that he converses with angels For heavens sakes you were hit on the head You could say anything is unworthy of the high position he now commands Proof beyond doubt that Mr McGovern is to put it charitably emotionally unstable and guilty of conduct detrimental to organized baseball Mr McGoverns supporters claim his peculiar statement was made after being hit in the head with a line drive therefore he is not responsible He admits it would like to ask Mr McGovern a question Was he responsible seven weeks ago in Boston How about it McGovern Seven weeks ago were you or were you not of sound mind and limb Beside me in the studio tonight is a man who can answer these questions Would you tell us your name please Patrick Finley What is your occupation Mr Finley m a groundkeeper at Braves Field up in Boston Will you please tell us what you saw in Braves Field about seven weeks ago Well see Mr McGovern What time dont know After the game Where was he Sitting on second base And what was he doing He was talking Talking to whom dont know There wasnt anybody there And when he was sitting on second base talking to somebody who wasnt there where was he looking Up What did he say dont know exactly couldnt hear everything was in the dugout But one thing he said was have a right to know the name of my own angel He said that my own angel Yes sir Then he said again Dont go away mad Thank you Mr Finley ask you ladies and gentlemen and Mr Commissioner is this the act of a normal reasonable man to hang around second base at night and talk to angels Much as hesitate to say this think that Mr McGovern should take a long long perhaps permanent rest The Pirates chalked up a victory today squeaking through by one lone run Playing uninspired ball they came to life in the final frame to sneak a run taking advantage Nice going boys Whats eating you So we won a ball game so hooray tell you its making me jumpy Angels Angels Every time go after a ball m afraid ll trip over something For two cents d quit right now Shut up You watch McGovern looking over his shoulder every two seconds Its scary For all we know this guy is off his rocker He might even be dangerous Lay off Lay off McGovern dont care hes trying to be a right guy Your job is to got out and play ball Keep your mouth shut understand Okay Saul Okay Watch it here he comes And heres a flash that was just handed to me Arnold Hapgood commissioner of baseball will arrive in Pittsburgh tonight He is here to investigate Guffy McGovern Well that sounds like bad news for Pittsburgh With the pennant hanging on tomorrows game m afraid the Pirates and Mr McGovern are in a pretty tough spot The Pirates played mighty shaky ball out there this afternoon With this hanging over their heads theres no telling what theyll do Its about my boys Theyre getting nervous Not that blame them but if it keeps on like this theyre apt to come apart tomorrow thought maybe you might have something to suggest Nervous huh wouldnt worry much about it Its only natural at a time like this How are you doing Me Oh great m in the pink One game away from a pennant theyre trying to throw me in the loony bin dont sleep nights dont eat Just to make matters worse m fresh out of pitchers Oh that so You know used four this afternoon Who do start tomorrow Yeah Well wouldnt worry about it Excuse me you got nothing to worry about Youre all set With me its a little different Yeah Yeah Martins got a bad arm Clarkes on the sick list Hellmans old he wouldnt last two innings

around next season What Were signing him up in the spring Saul Yeah Everybody gets to play up here sooner or later But Saul We were friends At least we used to be Hellman was a great pitcher once He pitched a twohitter in a World Series you know Yes know was there Excuse me Good night Good night Guffy This way commissioner Gentlemen have an appointment with all parties concerned tomorrow at Until hear all the evidence have nothing to say The Pirates are playing their last game tomorrow for the pennant m aware of that Think this is the proper time for the investigation My dear lady any times the proper time when the situation warrants it Baseball is for the people who support it My desk is piled high with letters From New York sir New York and other places Yes You think that Guffy McGovern has flipped his lid right Gentlemen the hearing takes place tomorrow morning The hearing was like a courtroom trial The investigation hinged on two points One are there such things as angels And two is it possible to talk to them How long have you been practicing psychiatry Dr Blane Eighteen years Youve just heard Mr McGoverns account of how a group of angels helped his ball team As a psychiatrist how did his story impress you Belief in celestial beings is a carryover from mankinds ignorance and fear of his environment Originally man worshipped the sun the moon stones trees But with the rise of religion as we know it today man felt the need of a closer alliance with the Supreme Being and so he invented the angel Invented Precisely Just as a hurt child will run to its parent so will a man turn for comfort to a belief in angels And when this belief takes the form of actual conversation with angels what is your professional opinion Well prefer not to say but d be happy to see you Mr McGovern in my office think thatll be all doctor and thank you Mr Commissioner Yes d like to introduce three witness for the defense Yes yes of course Gentlemen Mr Commissioner do not know any of these gentlemen My name is Guffy McGovern Dr Eustace Danforth Trinity Church How do you do Rabbi Allen Hahn Temple Israel How do you do Father Houlihan Church of Our Lady queen of the angels Gentlemen just make yourselves comfortable Mr Commissioner suppose you gentlemen know the general idea in the back of this inquiry Well what do you think Do you suppose there might be angels Right to left Lead the way Dr Danforth To deny the existence of angels is to deny the word of the Holy Bible which is specific on the subject From the ancient Hebrew text we have the words benei elohim the sons of God Kedoshim the holy ones and mala Mala How do you pronounce that Malachim Thank you Rabbi Malachim the messengers All of these may be translated angels Youll check me on that Rabbi Hahn It was an angel who guided the children of Israel to the promised land Behold send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way In Psalms again we find an angel the protector of man The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them Father Houlihan Seeing as how there are coveys of angels flitting through the pages of the Holy Scriptures Old and New Testaments dont see how can get out of saying believe in them imagine the commissioner does too Oh please just leave me out of this Mr Commissioner Yes Father would you also believe that they play baseball Whats that Mr McGovern has testified that angels helped his team Well now considering all the great wonders that angels have performed Id be much surprised if they couldnt play baseball providing they had a mind to But would they With all respect to your cloth is it likely one of your angels or a group of angels would lend support to a man like Guffy McGovern Is it possible that angels would aid and comfort such a man If a man have sheep and one of them should go astray doth he not leave the in the mountains and go and seek that which has gone astray Matthew And besides the Lord isnt as smallminded as some of us mortals And now Mr Commissioner had a short talk with Rabbi Hahn in the elevator we both discovered were seeing a ball game at So if you dont mind No of course not Youd better hurry Thank you sir Thank you gentlemen Thank you If Dr Blane would care to see me in my office d be very happy indeed Hey fellas where are you sitting Anything further that you would like to add Mr McGovern Nothing Gentlemen have listened to both sides of this argument and frankly m baffled m sure wed all like to believe in angels know would But if only had just one tiny bit of concrete evidence However Mr Commissioner Yes This is Bridget White She wants to testify for Mr McGovern Mr Commissioner you were set to make a decision Lets get on with it dont want anyone hammering away at this kid Sister will you please get her out of here If the commissioner wants to hear about angels he ought to ask someone whos seen them Mr McGovern what are you afraid of All right You just sit right down here What is your name little girl Bridget White years old Oh yes And where do you live Bridget St Gabriels Home for Orphan Girls You believe in angels dont you Doesnt everyone No No they dont But saw them twice And where did you think you saw these angels In the ballpark They were helping the Pirates Youre quite sure about that You wouldnt just make up a story would you Oh no Its bad to lie about anything But if you lied about angels guess thatd be real trouble Mr Commissioner may question the witness Certainly certainly certainly Now Bridget when you saw your angels what were they doing Well there was one standing behind Mr McGovern But you didnt see him talk to Mr McGovern No But know he must have Why Because Mr McGovern said so You think that one of your angels one of these heavenly messengers would talk to a man like Mr McGovern Of course Any angel would be proud to talk to a nice man like Mr McGovern Quiet Quiet please Is that all sir hope were not going to accept this as testimony The child is prejudiced What are you talking about will decide what is evidence here Isnt it true that you tried to adopt this child Havent you recently made a declaration of this to the Orphans Court Suppose did What about it Why Mr McGovern Nothing definite dont know if the court will let me have her You dont just walk in and adopt a child Theres problems Theres no problem here Guffy Nevertheless you wanted to adopt her Oh thats nice Its touching The little girl who saw the angels now stands up to testify for Mr McGovern But isnt she actually testifying for papa Guffy Come on stop that Stop that Order said order Dont do it Guffy Guffy stop it Guffy Guffy dont Make him stop Guffy dont Gentlemen think in view of the facts all things considered this case is dismissed Hey fellas whats with Guffy Read about it He got all his marbles Sure sure Sure He was okay all the time He aint no more crazy than am Hey Guffy Here you are That was a nice little fracas you staged McGovern Quite a show
