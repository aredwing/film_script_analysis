the station Miss Deverell Theo Gilbright Dont worry Please sit down It must be your first time in London Yes have to say was really expecting someone a good deal older You mean now youve seen me you wont publish my book No not at all Your age is a delightful surprise Although do have to say that the style and imaginative skill of your novel had all of us here guessing Some of us thought old lady in rural retreat others were more inclined towards baldheaded man in his fifties Do look like a man No its just that uh ahem we get a lot of submissions under pseudonyms Well mine wasnt ve got nothing to hide m very proud of my book Absolutely And do you think youll write another one Oh yes can let you have it in a couple of weeks Oh And what will the new book be about Its about an actress Are you interested in the theatre Miss Deverell Not really ve never been Well imagine you must be a great reader No dont have the time prefer writing The minute start my heads full of ideas But you must at least have some favourite authors quite like Shakespeare Except when hes trying to be funny Miss Deverell personally find your very special style totally compelling And m sure many readers will too Which is why as wrote to you wed be delighted to publish your novel Given one or two minor adjustments What adjustments Well for example chapter nineteen your ahem description of childbirth is a little on the shocking side m not sure the pints of blood passage is strictly necessary Then you clearly dont know anything about having babies No but am a father and can assure you childbirth is an extremely beautiful thing Thats because youre not the one bleeding Now chapter twentyfive Lady Iranias dinner party Just a detail but you dont actually need a corkscrew to open champagne think youre wrong dont think am wrong actually Well look its nothing hugely important But what do you say give you back the manuscript you make these changes and then we publish No m sorry wont change a single word or comma of my book Final boarding Final boarding background chatter Miss Deverell Oh Mr Gilbright Whatre you doing here came to apologize for what happened just now It was clumsy of me Thats

effects of drunkenness remarkably well know do Theos read me parts of Lady Irania You mustve done a great deal of research Oh no made the whole thing up in my own head see Which is presumably why some of it seems the fruit of a somewhat youthful imagination Miss Deverell and have already discussed all of that Hermione Some of Miss Deverells descriptions are well to say the least daring didnt

Theo m so sorry Allow me to introduce my niece Nora most fervent admirer Come on now Nora Up off the floor Homage from one writer to another and so on Uncle youre not to mention my feeble scribblings in front of Miss Deverell Youre a writer too write a little verse yes Under what name My own Nora HoweNevinson Its nothing compared to your own astonishingly beautiful work Miss Deverell Thank you youre very kind May also present my nephew Mr Esme HoweNevinson So you must be Noras brother Exactly It was Miss Deverell Esme who gave us the Watts Most generous Presented a very fine painting by Watts to the City Art Gallery One of the towns great treasures Another of course being Miss Deverell herself m sorry to say wasnt acquainted with your work Miss Deverell Oh well the play is just an adaptation It hardly does justice to the complexities of the novel And why Watts m sorry Out of all the painters in this world why would you choose Watts d always wondered how these awful pictures found their way into provincial galleries Now understand Esme What It mustve cost a great deal of money in a few years itll be worth nothing m simply letting Miss Deverell know the facts Well in future must ask your advice Please do To offer it would give me great pleasure You must forgive my nephew Esme is a painter himself you know Such miserable pictures Back streets in the pouring rain No sparing the sordid details That was quite a compliment Miss HoweNevinson paid you m always pleased to see writers being appreciated The brother though Rather rude Goodlooking though Stop What Stop the car What is it Turn off to the right Splendid old place you know it Yes Is it empty My aunt used to work there but the family lost everything and had to move to London Did you go there as a child Never When was little used to think would live at Paradise House It was all ever dreamed of Everyone told me my dreams were lies because said out loud the things shouldve kept secret But all wanted was to make it true To wish and to wish and to wish and to make it true gift from Paradise Thank you Its getting rather cold Perhaps we should go Come on Dont you think its too big for us Angel Of course not It just needs furniture Just to think of your aunt Lottie being a servant here Well m not a servant m the mistress You should be proud of me Oh of course m proud of you Angel Its just so big Round to the left Yes madam Be careful theyre very expensive Oh Oh good Come on Lovely Oh excellent Yes be very careful Oh did you see your bedroom Oh yes yes its beautiful Its playing some notes She knew from the first moment in her short Angel Miss HoweNevinson is here She wants to see you Who think shes the sister of that young painter you talked about And he is here No just the sister brought you the poems like you asked me to Oh yes of course Please dont be too critical Theyre really just first attempts Oh no doubt But the real reason wanted to see you again Miss Deverell is that have the the hugest hugest favour to ask Mother thought told you not to do that It is the servants job But you know how like to help It would be much more helpful if you went upstairs and rested You know what the doctor said Alright sweetheart You were saying Nora wanted to offer you my services Services mean as personal secretary could help with all the trivial things a great novelist like yourself should be protected from But already have all the servants need But not someone who understands your genius Not someone who really respects you Do they even read your books No suppose not Then please take me on To work for you would be the most beautiful beautiful way to serve literature There are so many things Miss Deverell could do for you You still havent told me anything about your brother Dont talk to me about Esme Why ever not When my uncle paid for the two of us to go to Italy my brother behaved so badly m ashamed to mention it In Italy What do you mean Seducing women of course There was one who was only too happy to let herself be ruined on his account until her husband found out He threatened to kill Esme and we had to pack up and rush back to London What was this woman like Beautiful a countessa but with Esme she had absolutely no shame Was he in love with her Oh Love My brothers never loved anyone other than himself that is And it was all such a horrid mess was forced to sell my own jewelry to pay the fare home You mustnt be too hard on him Nora One day hell find his feet and live from his painting just as live from my writing But youve never even seen his paintings No but ve imagined them Well well Miss Deverell This is unexpected was in the neighbourhood and seeing as your sister had given me your address just thought Absolutely Please Come in Forgive the mess but ve only just got out of bed If d known a lady was coming d have cleared some of this up Oh you mustnt worry m something of a Bohemian myself And hows my sister Nora is very well and very happy can imagine Shes always had a gift for living in another persons shadow Please Well she certainly doesnt live in mine ve always encouraged her to share in the brilliance of my success So to what do owe the pleasure of this visit ve come to see your paintings Really Well since you were so cruel to me that time about the Watts thought could make amends by having them hang one of your paintings next to it laughing Well theyd never let you Anyway dont think youd like my kind of work Thats what m here to find out Ah Italy cant paint Italy Its too much colour Yes Of course Italy is so banal Youre much more inspired in England m so pleased you say that didnt think youd like my smudgepaintings as Nora calls them My favourites the uh levelcrossing Mine as well Thats why showed it first d like to buy it if its for sale dont know Would you be prepared to accept pounds Well paid for the Watts and m sure your paintings are worth at least as much if not more Considering all your kindness towards my Nora you can have it for shall we say Fourhundred pounds m glad you didnt like the Italian one Theres something about Italy which brings out the vulgar in all of us Dont you think And what are your fees for a portrait For a portrait dont paint portraits Not even mine wouldnt want to be accused of making a smudgepainting out of you Maybe being smudged is nicer than it sounds Lets see Very beautiful eyes Very clear skin And hair that glistens in the light laugh shyly Dont tell me youre not used to compliments Miss Deverell really should be going Of course And shall we say tomorrow at the same time You dont mean to paint the portrait here Why not like the light d just imagined somewhere more Trust me this is perfect And what about clothes was thinking something lowcut with lace Or maybe something completely simple like like a Greek toga scoffing No come just as you are today But this dress is so drab Its not the dress m interested in its you read one of your books by the way Oh really Aspasia My landlady lent it to me read it straight through From cover to cover Angel laughing slightly And realized what your secret is My secret think the secret of your power over people is that you communicate with yourself not your readers Am right Yes Possibly Are are you tired No The thing is Angel find you utterly surprising and delightful But how can paint you if dont know whats really going on inside Because you give me little hints about yourself about your childhood growing up but none of it connects Somethings missing How can paint you if dont know what it is Maybe dont know what it is myself What happened to you in Italy ve never been to Italy Alright maybe not in Italy but to do with Italy What was it Was it love m sure it was something to do with love It was jealousy knocking sighing Who is it Its Nora Oh Nora What a wonderful surprise Come in come in The doctors very worried Angel really think you ought to consider coming home Its very sweet of you to be so concerned about my mother but ve lots of professional commitments here particularly now As soon m finished ll come home alright Youre seeing him arent you Seeing who Theo No my brother What makes you say that Be careful He could hurt you laughing Hurt me m not a child Nora And hardly see Esme as lifethreatening was pleasantly surprised by his pictures They may not match my own ideas of beauty but they have a definite m not talking about his paintings m talking about him Youre not jealous are you Jealous Of my interest in your brothers paintings But its not just his paintings Its true do like Esme But in the same way that like you Come hated being an only child would have loved to have had a sister Nora sister like you But what did the doctor say He says her condition is more dangerous than hed thought Hes not sure shell recover especially if she cant eat Well whats he doing about it There must be some kind of medicine she can take m just telling you what he said Youre here Angel My darling Your hands are freezing Have you told Aunt Lottie Of course Nora sent a telegram Why isnt she here dont know It is a long way m frightened ll never see her again Dont say that used to love it when she could come and visit us so often at the grocery Remember Of course But youll get better and youll see her again Youre so sweet to me Angel Yes want you to forgive me for bringing you up the way did know it was hard for you and even harder when your father died You were such a pretty little thing So cheeky and clever He worshipped you crying You know what regret most No Its not having the time to see you marrying and have a child But dont have time for a child Mother have my work Your work your books exhaling Oh Oh no Oh no sobbing No No dont leave me Oh please dont leave me sobbing No please dont leave me Well Its over Oh my God crying crying On behalf of the Norley Gazette would like to offer my sincerest condolences on the death of your mother a woman well known by us all for her excellent grocery shop My mother was above all else a very great artist Was she She played the piano She was considered to be one of Englands finest concert pianists see Thats something wasnt aware of Her natural humility prevented her from advertising her exceptional musical gift And like yourself she was born here in Norley My childhood is wrapped in mystery Its true was brought to Norley at a very tender age but from where nobody knows always thought had noble blood perhaps from my fathers side But my mother passed away before she could divulge the true secret background chatter laughing mockingly Well wonder when we can expect her to make an appearance She should be already here Shes probably anxious Oh think shes more irritated about the people who havent come did explain nobody stays in London for summer Its not personal Anyway theyre just snobs They resent the fact that shes popular Have you seen my brother Oh yes Excuse me Certainly Mr HoweNevinson Theo Gilbright Of course Will you excuse me Well think its wonderful that your sisters working for Angel She seems absolutely devoted In love with her you mean In love with her Oh yes Passionately Are you by any chance Miss HoweNevinsons famous brother whose talents Miss Deverell never ceases to impress on us am actually Then allow me to introduce myself Hermione Gilbright the publishers wife Delighted to meet you My wifes a great devotee of painting Shes extremely keen to see your work Particularly your portrait of Miss Deverell cant wait to see it Angel made off with it

pleasure Thank you Thank you Tell her wasnt feeling very well So kind Thank you so Angel youre beautiful Wheres Esme Drinking should imagine Actually think he left Wasnt looking at all well How incredibly rude Angel arranged all this for him specially When did he leave Just a moment ago Angel crowd reacting Whatevers got into her Could it be love Esme Esme Esme Why did you leave wanted to surprise you The painting Why do you want to humiliate me hate those people thought it would make you happy Make me happy Make yourself happy more like it No thats not true love the way you paint want everyone else to love you too Youre wasting your time Angel My paintings are worthless Nobody cares Dont say that Youre an artist Esme You just need someone to believe in what you do When look into those eyes of yours could almost believe it You have to believe it Esme you have to believe it thunder crashing could make you happy could pay off all your debts Youd be free from all the horrible sordid things that keep you here Come with me to Paradise House Marry me Esme Marry you Isnt that what the mans supposed to ask Who cares love you You love me ve loved you since the moment we met and ll go on loving you until the day die Continue please Nora crowd shocked Oh donkey braying Oh m so pleased youre back was so worried with all this talk about war Its not because of that nonsense just

Hello Oh Sultan have you forgotten your poor mistress laughing dog whimpering Thats not Sultan m sorry Angel didnt want to spoil things when you were away But Sultan unfortunately died No But tried to find another one the same Esme laughing Oh well Thank you Nora whispering Is it ready whispering Yes the workmen finished this morning Come my darling How exciting Angel giggling My word Well youve never really had a proper studio Esme whistling Extraordinary Youre happy Leave us alone Oh but havent shown you what ve done to my bedroom Later So What do you think Its wonderful Angel laughing But

of course am This is where youre going to paint your masterpiece Nobody has ever given me anything like this before Thank you Angel Can come in Not yet Ready Almost You can come in now Oh What is it Water from the sacred spring at Delphi Legend says it has magical powers and it used to inspire the greatest of the Greek poets laughing brought it back especially for you Oh thank you Angel Oh breathing deeply Good night sweet sweet Nora Good night Angel Good night Esme m not sure theres room for me and Nora under the same roof Of course there is Paradise is big enough And need you both

defenceless creatures Take care m about to attack a defenceless little creature right now No Esme Dont Dont Stop it giggling Oh no let him stay Weve all got to be friends dog whimpering Not in front of the dog Dogs are used to it Her pale eyelids fluttering down over her huge blue eyes and the great love of her life slumbering sweetly at her side she whispered these immortal words This is the most beautiful day of my life Together forever living in Paradise And how are my lovely flowers Why do you have to make everything so dark Whats wrong with using colour But these are colours Look grey burnt umber This part heres violet But its ridiculous They dont look anything like that all faded All m doing is painting what see In which case what you see has nothing to do with reality Since when was my darling Angel so interested in reality Everything you writes a complete fantasy But m not interested in whats real but whats beautiful As far as m concerned my flowers are beautiful Do you know where Esme is think he is with Marvell In the grounds Maybe or at the races knocking What is it Excuse me madam Did tell you to come in No madam Sorry madam But something terribles happened Well What is it War Theyve declared war Oh my God is she ever going to stop crying Angel show some compassion Her fiances joining the army John the gardener Yes Well hope he doesnt come crawling back here wanting his job back in a couple of months couple of months war can last for years Oh my darling Please forgive us weve started without you Dont worry ve just come to collect my things To do what m going to London m enlisting Esme When are you leaving This afternoon You cant You cant do this to me Weve just moved into the new house Angel please dont This is not personal Not personal The countrys at war cant stay here cut off from the rest of the world It wouldnt be right Oh So killing animals isnt enough for you You need a war to satisfy your thirst for blood Dont be so ridiculous You dont know what youre talking about Its got nothing to do with it Youre all the same violent destructive needing to kill just to prove youre a man Well if men are so disgusting youll be much better off with my sister You have no right to do this You cant Yes can warn you If you walk out that door youll find it slammed in your face Please Angel sobbing thats enough Take care of her Shes not as strong as we think Of course will m proud of you Esme m doing my duty thats all God knows how shed go on if he was killed Youre not to talk like that Esme will be back sobbing Good afternoon Is my niece at home Oh m sorry sir but Miss Noras just left Oh Dont tell Miss Deverell but shes helping out with the warwounded in the infirmary Well good do so wish d seen Esme before he left for the front Oh really See thought he was an idle degenerate that you disinherited had no idea his uniform made him a hero What a wonderful thing the war is m simply saying Miss Deverell that m glad to see Esme finally becoming a man You must miss him a great deal Yes If theres anything can do Theres nothing anyone can do have my work Theres a great loss to literature every time we drag you from your desk Miss Deverell But do believe that by helping us in the war effort you might feel that in your own small way you were fighting at Esmes side What do you mean the war effort Well for example you could allow us to set up a second hospital here in Paradise Paradise hospital Yes It would be extremely useful to us This war has separated me from my husband It has been the cause of our first disagreement do not allow Nora or anyone else to mention it in my presence And will never let Paradise fall into the hands of warmongers and criminals More tea Lord Norley think perhaps it would be as well if were to go Better for the war effort certainly Madam Yes m leaving crying in pain Oh gasping How advanced was it Less than three months If only my brother had been here suppose it couldve made a difference And what should do now Once shes over the shock shell start to recover She just needs rest Youre feeling better Not bad Do you want me to write and tell Esme Tell him to come home even if its just on leave Tell him that miss him and that forgive him But nothing about the baby He has a right to know Angel He has no right to know He deserted me He didnt desert you He just for the first time in his life made a grownup decision Hes ruined everything Everything He hasnt ruined everything m still here And weve just got to wait for him to come home Esmes desperate to become a father If he finds out lost his baby hell never come home Please promise me you wont tell him promise train whistle blowing Oh darling background chatter Mr Gilbright Miss HoweNevinson Did you have a good trip long one but at least m here Very good of you to come feel bad lied to Angel said was visiting an elderly aunt in Kensington chuckling had to lie to my wife as well Thank you dont know what were going to do Her last book m afraid was a terrible disappointment thought that was because of the war No m afraid it was because of the book Her readers are disturbed by this newfound pacifism They dont see what place it has in a romantic novel And frankly agree with them ve said this to Angel naturally but she wont listen But shes still a great writer Nothing can alter that What she needs to do is to get back to the way she used to write and give people something to distract them from this wretched war If she doesnt ask myself whats going to happen And m not just saying this as her publisher but as her friend Miss Howe are you alright Look behind you Carefully Who on earth is she Shes an old acquaintance My God what if Angel finds out he was on leave How could Esme do this to her m going to talk to him No no no Nora Nora Nora Leave him be Really Well Whats it like Not wonderful Such a shame Dont tell me youre feeling sorry for Angel Now everybodys criticizing and rejecting her do feel a kind of pity for her Perhaps understand you more Understand me Yes Because you had the courage to publish her when no one else would And you were right m pleased to hear you finally taking her side scoffing cant take her side as a writer Theres not one of her books could ever enjoy But ve come to admire the woman Despite all her bad taste and absurdities she fought for her dreams and got everything she wanted success fame Even the man she loved The man she loved Are you still in love with her scoffing What makes you say that Your eyes Angel telegram Well open it Oh my God hes been killed Hes wounded Theyre sending him home Theyre sending him home Oh Oh And what will you do now youre home Esme Paint d love you to paint my peacocks You should see them when they fan out their tails m not sure Esme is going to want to paint your pet birds Not after what hes just been through But we have to forget all that None of it matters now Thingsll be just as they were Just as they were Yes Youve lost your leg but its not like youre dead And ll buy you a wheelchair and then you can go wherever you like Do you want me to help you No Good night Whatre you doing What is it sighing heavily ve missed you Angel Are you sure this is a good idea With your leg Esme breathing heavily grunting Actually dont think Angel could bear it if you left a second time So what do you expect me to do here in this mausoleum Try to bury me alive No expect you to use the studio to paint Paint what Sultan Angels cats Paint what you saw in the war Nobodys interested in that Theyd rather forget was looking at your Greek sketchbooks and there were some loose drawings So what Throw them away Whats the point liked them laughing Come on Nora Spare me your pity Youve never liked a single thing ve ever done You saw me in London didnt you Yes Did you tell her No Angel giggling Dear madam having had personal experience of the horrors of war would ask you to spare your readers those sadistic descriptions and stylistic mannerisms As a lover of literature feel the Angel laughing Oh stop Thats enough Burn it Thank you my darling Angel Mmhmm Theres something have to ask you Oh Its about money What do you mean ve got none left and m drowning in debt m very very sorry realize how much you must regret having married a gambler chronic one at that ve never regretted it Have you Youre the one who has every reason to Nora always said married you for your money dont have any money Thats it then m finished Of course not can get money Its just a case of giving the public what they want feel despicable asking you like this How soon How soon do they want it Well with gambling debts can always stall for a little while but eventually Dont worry m going to start writing and m not going to leave this room until ve written The End Oh Angel its magnificent Theos going to be so pleased Going to make even more money out of me you mean whispering words of what he had Marvell Marv Just in time panting You write too much Oh get off You stink of alcohol Oh What are you doing Giving you a little present for writing all your lovely romantic stories Angel screaming screaming No No little baby little baby boy grunting With one little leg Angel screaming and crying little baby Oh my God Esme stop it Stop it Esme Angel screaming You Get off You pig sobbing How could you be such a fool Cant you see what hes doing to us Angel crying Its alright Hes gone Gone What do you mean With Marvell First thing this morning To the races Hunting dont think so He took his suitcase What did he say Nothing He wouldnt talk You alright sir Were leaving Oh my darling Oh you came back You came back knew you would Nora said youd be gone forever but knew she was lying You wont ever leave me again you wont desert me No And look what came for you today liquid gurgling door opening and closing dog barking Sultan Whats the matter Hey gasping screaming and when our bodies still burning with the indescribable desire of starcrossed lovers were at last sundered Esme lifted my heavy hair from the pillow and whispered like voluptuous caresses these fatal words May this infinite love join us body and soul even beyond death and may our hearts be forever united Thank you Miss Deverell Grant Esme eternal peace Let us reflect upon psalm verses four and five Angel crying sobbing Thank you Right this way Ah so this will be a whole article devoted just to Esme Yes absolutely think his work deserves to be more widely recognized And think the public are really ready for this kind of restricted palette Restricted palette Whats that Not a criticism Uh no nnot at all simply mean painting using very few colours In this case mainly browns and greys Ah yes Poor Esme never liked painting sunshine or bright colours He much preferred scenes in pubs or factories For the time that Esme lived at Paradise he was completely happy That is my one consolation now that he has passed on And how how did he die exactly heart attack It mustve been a great comfort having his sister here with you So unlike her brother But then she always has been What is this flower called ve forgotten its name Uh m afraid cant help you ve never known very much about plants Esme wouldve known Ah Here is Esmes dictionary of wild flowers His favourite book after mine of course Oh Thank you Heres the flower Go away Sorry Go Leave Um we we were going upstairs to photograph the canvas Leave this house Go now nor could you and ever be as ecstatically happy together as we were on that last leave Dont try and write to me again dont understand He didnt ever have leave It makes no sense Unless he lied to me Unless he came back from France but he lied to me Came back to England but saw someone else Is that what happened Listen Esme was never given leave m sure
