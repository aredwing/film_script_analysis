Um okay this is the Houdini house And On a dark night around a full moon was gazing down upon the Hollywood Hills On a rugged hillside stood a Gothic castlelike mansion that had been built several years before by the wealthy owner of one of the citys largest furniture stores And on one of the night er on Halloween they were having a party And all of these people were like costumed and going And his son decided to escape the party so that he could go up to the back balcony so he could hang out with his lover And it was a time when obviously gay men couldnt Yeah be known And They were having a romantic moment and then for some reason an argument ensued The orchestra had just taken an intermission when a scream filled the air The heir to the furniture fortune had pushed his young lover off the balcony and his body now lay in a pool of blood There was no question as to who had killed the man but the father nevertheless hired the best lawyer that money could buy In an effort to save his son he spent nearly every dime that he had paying off policemen prosecutors and event and the event he paid off the trial judge himself Finally it was ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the furniture heir How convenient and the man and the family name were saved But unfortunately the house was sacrificed to save the sons life And this was not the first tragedy or this was the first tragedy to occur that could be connected to the Gothic mansion but it would not be the last In fact it has been said that the place is cursed and that all those who have occupied the house were plagued by bad luck and disaster Okay In addition to the murder other strange events have taken place here over the years Many of those have involved the man who purchased the house from the furniture store owner His name was Harry Houdini and he lived in the mansion during his short career with the fledgling movie industry in the s Thats so cool While he lived in the house and became a frequent host to sances strange experiments and more some say this cursed castle may have finally cost the famous mag magician his life Thats the word When youre holding sances Not mmhmm Well
