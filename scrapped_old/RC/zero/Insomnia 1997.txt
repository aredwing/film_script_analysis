been here before lt reminds me of a hotel on the west cost where we stay when we visit my inlaws One morning we woke up with a couple standing in our room l tried to get rid of them but they insist that its their room Eva got really upset Yes They insist that its their room Room What interests did she have What dreams Who did she associate with Who did she want to associate with Which teachers did she like and dislike Which boys did she like Or maybe she didnt like Everything is equally important lts absurd that Tanja is gone lts hard to understand that she wont be sitting here tomorrow Or

bag may reveal him hell come and get it lt was the same school bag the murdered Tanja Lorentzen had with her when she left the party on Sunday morning lts not been found lf you see or find such a bag then please contact the police lt may contain clues which will lead us to Tanjas killer Maybe he doesnt watch Oh yes Theres nothing else to do around here Am l upsetting you You probably hear jokes like that all the time No Hes here Wait till he picks up the bag then we follow him Quietly Freeze Police He went into the shed Lets get him You cant get anywhere now Please come out Zakariassen Down to the sea and follow the waterline Erik you take the hillside and when you reach the bay you go left Here here here Which way did he go There You said to the right You said to the right Then l found Zakariassen laying between the stones and He pointed l ran in the direction he pointed Then l saw a figure disappear behind a stone Then l slipped l heard a shot and saw him running towards me First he shoots Vik and then he runs straight towards you What After he shot Vik Did the perpetrator run straight towards you l suppose he didnt see me lt was foggy And then When he saw me he turned abruptly and ran back l ran after him down towards the sea Then he turned again Shot at me missed and ran further Thats when l spotted Erik and stopped to help him Describe the man you saw lts that fucking maps fault Every stone is marked on it but not the bunker below the shed Yes most unfortunate lf ld known about that tunnel ld had a man down there We should always be armed like you do in Sweden When will the autopsy take place Tomorrow The bullets in his spine The bullet is no good without the weapon Dont worry One of your detectives will handle the Vik case We need a special permit to be armed and there was no reason in this case as we couldnt imagine We heard you were the first to arrive at the crime scene What did you see lt was very foggy l was the first person to reach the beach and found Vik lying there There was nothing l could do How does it feel to lose a colleague like that Damn sad Does it hurt What Youve been on the all night Did you work together for a long time Just over a year Weird What He was standing there yesterday l wish ld been nicer to him Dont worry You could say anything to him He was Do you have masking tape Masking tape Masking tape How does it

his arms around before he shot Did you see him shoot Vik No l didnt see anything lt cant be easy He was a nice chap Have they removed the bullet lt went straight through Just a flesh wound Good We need you He knew it might be a trap Thats why he was armed Hes cold calculating and thinks hes more intelligent than the police His arrogance will lead him to make a mistake Tanjas bag contains something that may convict the killer or at least the killer thinks so We have to check its contents more thoroughly We have to confront Tanjas classmates with its contents and knock on all doors between the house of the party and the crime scene Tom your preliminary conclusion Tanja Lorentzen died of a cerebral hemorrhage We assume that she didnt die instantly No sexual assaults No sperm Nothing He worked with Erik for a long time lll be handling the Vik case Good Well just have to do our best Of course We shall remember Erik Vik as a sociable and proud policeman with one minutes
