outlook of life then can say yes It happens sometimes Or at least once With a goodlooking lady that is It happened another time but rather not think about that Whew Anyway was finishing the installation when she walked in Contrary to popular belief Beg your pardon Kittens love taking showers contrary to popular belief Yeah Do you mind if try out the shower and make sure it doesnt have a leak The showers not gonna leak No My work is guaranteed Oh Oh Yes Oh hate awkward silences know what you mean You are a very difficult man to read Eugene Am Because Oh could mean several things It

started wondering how late was gonna be for my next appointment It was clear this woman was in no emotional state to throw herself at me Plus the nineteen orgasms given to her by her husband were looming over me like a monster and that Russian tramp had hypnotized him and he had blown all of the missing cash on her How many days Excuse me How many days were you in Cabo Two why No reason Oh

Hypothetical Yeah You meet a young lady Yeah Shes adventurous You mean like Betty Keep Betty out of it Why do keep here talking to you Jim Different sort of adventures Maybe youre not up to her You cant be a mountain climber What Nothing Shes singing Whats that Thats Spanish What m driving at is this All men agree on one thing and that is that man needs variety Oh agree with that This is a deeply flawed argument Is this the way Betty taught you the story See glass halffull mentality right there The way see it if you dont get action every day thats the win You dont know why any woman in her right mind would let you anywhere near her holiest of holies but lets say you get lucky somebodys willing You protect that guy comes along and says you like beer But you gotta like beer every day of your life Well why not love football That means gotta watch it every day Sure Arent gonna get tired of watching football drinking beer day after day all my life Maybe But am willing to do the work to find out that truth And if it turns out that thats the case trust myself to find other interests Jim you know this feeling that youre feeling right now Contentment in the sacred bond of marriage This restless fever of romantic delusion you know its not got lost dont you You know what you are Yeah m a cynical bastard Or m a curmudgeonly naysay who calmed you out should receive a compliment It must be hard work being you but mark my words Youll meet a charming young woman Its the hardest thing to find in American life Youll jump on that train gladly youll go off Good old Jim always trying to drag me down to his level of misery What he couldnt possibly foresee is that this charming young woman he was conjuring for me was presently right next door Hello Hi Otto m taking a bath Of course m alone may catch a cold if dont put something on But ll be ready for you dont you worry You just come on over ll see when you get here Bye Whoa you look weird If you had a lick of sense youd grab your stuff now and get out of here dont have a lick of sense This experience could make a decent chapter in an autobiography Chapter was born of modest means so ve always had a fascination with buff God its a lame excuse for liking money have no selfesteem My father was a misunderstood poet my mother was a masochist Does everybody think all this nonsense to themselves Is everybody as bad inside their head as me It cant be mean some people must have wonderfully perceptive epiphanies that trickle down like rain water and make them feel all cozy inside Why cant think of stuff like that Why is my brain so boring Why is it anything But can change right mean have to at some point Grow up take charge Make something good out of all this misery Subvert the codes Oh God Theres a dead giveaway written all over your face do not trust words Language is a disease of the throat What am thinking now Am thinking of not thinking Its like concentrating on your breathing It can drive you crazy Petrie Savorin said so Dont play the word game m not doing this This is not me m not impulsive m pragmatic The meandering the waiting The not doing anything or getting anywhere Gives me kind of relief Like m finally dropping the charade Theres a second life underneath the real life Like a subway underneath the city Oh my imagination is working overtime dont care what people do behind closed doors Or open doors dont care Yeah this is what m talking about This is what a youthful nonconformist was born to do own this world and feel all tingly inside surge of excitement pulsing through my entire being Like the man said m a street walking cheater with a heart full of napalm The worlds forgotten girl What was that Sounds like she fell Where is this scumbag m going in What the hell are you talking about Ottos due here any second have had feeling about this Dont you dare go in that room Have you ever saved anyones life before Its not pretty Theres sticking your fingers down their throat and when that fails pumping of the stomach peculiar kind of animal gurgling noise they make No matter how fetching they are in person theres this infantlike smell when youre pushing their face down the sink or running them a bath and their knees keep going and theyre falling all over the place you know what mean do now But all of it goes away the second you realize theyre alright Hi Hi This isnt real must wake up now No youre awake Get some clothes on her And get rid of the deadbeat At this point things get a little screwy That was just a warmup This ones gonna hurt Who are you trying to convince Yourself Or your little playmate He had a point It hurt Funny what neardeath experiences do with people dont think Mary and ever discussed being together We just suddenly were This wasnt as easy as it sounds and compromises were made on all sides Otto hadnt killed me because a cop is still a cop But was yanked from the case Hell pretty much destroyed the case So was put on extended leave Jim came around once in a while but otherwise Mary became my nurse and my cook and my obsession Lest it all sound bleak and dreary rest assured we found ways of entertaining each other Not that we had that much in common like jazz like comic books like westerns like riproaring tales about singing pirates What do you make of that Personally singing pirates never did it for me No mean the fact that we had nothing in common dont think people look for a copy of themselves in other people think they look for someone theyre compatible with At least they should Never thought of it that way Is that what you do What are you drinking My whole life never thought of anyone but myself think youre just saying that You strike me as an unselfish person Trust me wouldnt know what an unselfish act looks like suppose the one thing me and Mary did have in spite of anything else was compatibility Tell me a secret Ladies first m a terrible driver Honestly cant believe havent run somebody over Something personal secretly wish were a superhero thought we were being serious think about it all the time My life is so unexciting just hate the everyday world wish had a secret identity and went around beating up bullies Thats what you do Not exactly We both have victim complexes Were just different sides of the same coin Where do you get this stuff You ask because it makes sense or because its weird ask because youre a girl Girls dont need to be that smart You ever wonder what superheroes are like in the sack No Never No You never wonder what it might be like to be with a woman if youre Superman Supermans an alien How can he altogether be interested in a lady He is so into the ladies mean the poor guy can barely speak to Lois without getting all flustered Walking around with all that power between his legs This conversation is a little weird Youve never thought about Tiltawor Whos Tiltawor How old are you Grandpa Tiltawor she wears the black mask and carries around the ray gun that her scientist father bequeathed her on his deathbed Say bequeathed again And she spins like this and she can drive vault through concrete mean shes my favorite What took you so long Mary Dont get excited Who did this to you He didnt mean it provoked him Otto What have you been doing talking to him Its not like have a choice Why not Dont make me spell it out Try me He still owns me Felix Nobody owns you Thats a pretty postcard Where do you think go after work when come home late Why are you doing this dont enjoy it but its part of the deal Were not children Lets not pretend What does this mean m sorry but youve known all along If knew then why did let you Because youre like me Theres this sickness inside of you that needs to hurt Or to be hurt Because were the same From that moment my life changed Or should say my death sentence was signed You like the love story so far Sure kid real kick in the head What happened next Next Next put a sixweek plan into motion that came to fruition only a couple of hours ago Details are tedious take my word for it but the basic premise is simplicity itself received inside information that Ottos crew was to rob DeFalcos steel factory payroll and stash the money at a safe location and return to claim it next morning when the coast was clear All had to do was wait and walk out rich That was the plan anyway But plans do what plans always do They go wrong While was busy improvising my inside mans only task for the evening was to keep Otto drooling over her at the Vixenville You know theres a moment in the current review where she goes backstage to change before other dancers come out right on time before she rejoins fifteen window while she changes Just enough time for her to slip out the back jump in a cab and join me in the station And She didnt show What happened Either she changed her mind or shes dead This makes no difference for the outcome Youre drunk My God it took a lifetime to happen What if shes in danger You dames are all the same youre always looking out for their sister Have you not been paying attention ve played my cards Maybe had a lousy hand you know It looked good enough at the time by the way

sociopath was there watching his favorite girl But there was something off about her performance tonight Something undetectable to most but very apparent to Otto The girl seemed nervous aloof Sure enough five minutes into her routine she twisted an ankle and had to leave the stage Well Otto sick with worry he rushes back to the dressing room and somehow they get into a fight and she stabs him in the right eye with the heel of her shoe She what You know how they say its all fun and games until somebody pokes an eye out Well thats just what happened And on the way to the hospital Otto gets news that a few of his associates had been gunned down And some money happens to be missing Normally theres only one person whose expertise trust in putting all these disparate elements into a cohesive whole Normally enjoy hearing you piece these strands together m not enjoying myself tonight Felix Let her go Jim did this She poked the mans eye out Hes got another one Somehow when woke up

What money The money was never here The trail went cold is that the play You tell me You came here wouldnt tell you where the money was hidden Refused to be tracked to the gallows And then what Then

simply a supporting player in somebody elses movie Oh my God
