Federal prosecutor Sam Ellis is widely expected to run for higher office With a not guilty verdict But a resolution is expected shortly on federal charges That Ellis plans to seek higher office For Ellis everything is riding on todays decision Todays decision will either launch his political career Presumably beginning with a run for Attorney General Mr Ellis Yeah couple of us arranged this little drinks thing at blend Were kind of all assuming that Youll be there Dont we have to win first Theres no way Youll lose All rise Do you think sheriff Haussler should be given a lesser sentence given his record of public service As said at the trial Jim this is a blackandwhite issue legally and morally There should be no special treatment After todays victory do you intend to pursue corruption charges against other officials in the mayors administration No decisions on any further action have been made at this time Any chance youre gonna run for Attorney General Sam Well have my hands full at the attorneys office right now While Haussler is expected to appeal todays decision all eyes will be on whether the attorneys office plans to seek charges against mayor Jonas Stiegel So

build a list Highprofile public officials mostly state All of whom are clients and many of whom and many of whom were social friends of a colleague of yours here Kirkland Mmhmm We think maybe they asked him to hold up the investigation Has he ever mentioned the case to you Uh no Not at all He ever mention the agency or prostitution in general Maybe the occasional offcolor comment Were using an escort as a witness on an unrelated identitytheft case but believe she worked for a different agency And you yourself have never had any contact with the agency or any of its employees Not that m aware of You were in the hospital on Tuesday Is that correct Yes was hit by a car crossing the street Then you passed out four blocks from the Saint regency hotel m not really sure where passed out

could assist the investigation wed be extremely do you have a case We suspect that someone tipped the agency They started rolling up destroyed all their records Thats why we moved in But we think we
