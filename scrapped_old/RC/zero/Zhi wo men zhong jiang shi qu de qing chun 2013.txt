fall so much in love with another If we changed places even for just one day youd understand what mean Since ve been with you m no longer my old self Why is it that you keep your eyes open whenever kiss you Because want to see and remember it all To remember Am too small Maybe a little But since ve never seen bigger ones its good enough for me Hey student Please return to the shop theres a

human rights Insulting your character You wouldnt be a thief il you cared about your character Youre accusing me of theft Ming search her Are you throwing a fit you little punk didnt steal anything Why couldnt you have worked this out amicably You should have reported it to the Security Office right away and let the authorities handle it Why deal with it in such a barbaric way What the Security Office for One small misunderstanding and you blew it up into a fracas This is a university not a street market One small misunderstanding They trampled on my human rights They insulted my character They have to apologize and compensate me Why are you shouting Arent we investigating it rig ht new will deal with this fairy Of course they will apologize but youll have to pay fur the damage Why should pay anything What You want to make even more of this Even if youre right dont be unreasonable Ms Zhu please let us know it you need any help with anything Xiao Bei always talks about you girls She says you treat her like a sister Youve really looked after her thank all of you for that Xiao Bei will always be like a sister to us Ms Zhu wed like to see her off Dont Shell feel worse if she sees all of you Ever since she was little Xiao Bei has been very proud Were going to miss her Work hard on your studies girls ll be off dont come with me What were you two up to Let me guess Little Ms Dragon is jealous Not at all couldnt care less Silly girl Shes also here to look for a job We were on the same team in the graduation project We disagreed about some of the details So we were discussing that Were only looking for male candidates no females Never mind Hes great isnt he He is So hes your boyfriend Yes so you and both think hes great Were in complete agreement Thats true hear that big companies like yours are all worried about the talent drain dont think building corporate loyalty or raising pay will solve it To best solution would be to employ couples And then You should hire both of us We can both work heart and soul for you Dedicate all our youthful enthusiasm and strength to the company Zhang Wei youve always wanted to go to the aquarium right So m taking you there Really Count your conscience It costs yuan to get in Do you have your student with you No Then forget it were not going Be quiet d take you there even if il cost wish could touch a dolphin Xiaozheng What did you say to the guy persuade him to let me touch the dolphin Thats a secret Zheng Wei This is not good ve just heard some terrible news You pick up some major item of gossip every day whats new Youre being taken for a ride and youre the last to know The College Council just told me that your dear Xiaozheng was given one of the two skatesponsored places for study abroad They say he already has his visa Hes really something keeping this huge secret from everyone Who told you this nonsense Why didnt he ever mention it to me m his girlfriend dont you think d know Youre the eye of the storm everyone knows except you Why have you come with your hair still wet was missing you just thought d come by Li Weijuan just told me something hilarious She says youre going abroad To the isnt that hilarious Zheng Wei come with me Lets find a place to talk Its okay here is fine Zheng Wei m sorry Why are you sorry Did you do something wrong again What youve heard is true China State Construction was just a fallback option never thought the visa would come through so quickly So actually am the last person to know about it ve been agonizing ever this for some time couldnt think of a way of telling you without hurling you Without hurting me Youve kept me in the dark all this time And now youre finally forced to come clean You think thats not hurling me Chen Xiaozheng what kind of logic is that once told you that my life is like a building that can be put up only once So cant afford to make any mistake Even if that mistake is just an error of one centimeter So youve now concluded that you need to fix that onecentimeter error which is me by going abroad to study sure did fall for the most ambitious guy around But dont quite understand why our futures have to be in conict If youd told me might not have said anything But it seems that it never occurred to you to include me in your lifeplan Xiaozheng need an explanation Anything Tell me you had no choice Tell me youre doing it for my sake Tell me anything and ll accept it Zheng Wei Some day youll understand that people sometimes have to love themselves grew up poor How can impose that on the girl love Why do

We write biographies of people who have passed away Many people live very full lives but leave no real trace in the world So their families feel the less very keenly In point of fact every persons life is remarkable in some way Worth remembering Isnt that so As it says here The bird has flown by Leaving no trace in the sky My late husband did have a full life My ask how much you charge For less than words yuan without publication costs For more than words yuan with publication costs Then ll think about it My numbers on the namecard Think about it can give you a discount You want a biography Theres fierce competition in the design and architecture fields in the But youve accomplished a lot in a short time You must feel proud is your ego inflated If your success is built on things youve lust dont think pride or an inflated ego are much of a problem You can play the big shot all you want but you know deep down that your pride is hollow Well we live in an era when everyone dreams of quick success think many people would like to know the secret of yours Success is a harmful word used to think that lived my life exactly how d calculated it My calculations didnt allow even one centimeter of error Not allowing that one centimeter invalidates my success On those terms d rather not be successful Really Why not Because my success was built on my failure as a person It wasnt worth it Got any topclass knockoffs of big brands need some leather shoes and a nice bag Then youve come to the right place Who are all these people Hello classmates Hey Zhang Miss me Youve dressed up

selfdeprecating Youve got everything you ever wanted Zheng Wei You have good reason to hate me Youre too full of yourself dont hate you just despise you You can despise me as a man driven by selfinterest Even my marriage was a transaction did it just to get my green card But if still have a residue of good conscience admit that youre the only one lever truly loved It feels as if ve walked

Kaiyang Arent you Zhu Xiaobei You have the wrong person m Liu Yun m sorry That Woman is definitely Zhu Xiaobei m not mistaken Then why did she deny it Why change her name Chen Xiaozheng The university

to go to waste Do you know what babys breath symbolizes It means ready to stay in the background Nobody knows that always loved you kept all that love for you inside Like a thief concealing stolen treasures whos afraid of showing himself in the daylight m glad theres someone who truly loved you You were the one who taught me how to drink Now the two of us will drink together again Youre the only one wholl be forever young Zheng Wei asked you to come today because have one question Can love you all over again Chen Xiaozheng We spent Together Neither of us owes the other anything Youth is
