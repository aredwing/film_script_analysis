convict Ms Hannah Gebowski fleetingly As a paramedic have received several awards cant explain why violated my duty and left my workplace on that day lt must have been due to my state of exhaustion This negligence had nothing to do with my acquaintance with the convict Jenny never finished anything She ended up on the street There or in some public restroom she met this cute little hustler The cheapest kind And then this boy killed his father Its nice here According to the files your daughter did it Thats not true Then why is she in prison Because she was convicted not because she did it She incriminated herself to cover this loser He dumped her and got free She rejected any kind of help because urged her to testify against the hustler He got her pregnant did you know Yes Then she got
