very devout boy Our Mansoor If you give your consent will talk to him for your marriage Marriage dont want to marry Baba Why Ma When was eight years old you found me at the fair lost and alone Since then you have given me shelter Now if you again send me back out into the world It will be very difficult for me But Ma our ashram is for spiritual practice in order to live here you will have to learn all that And without a Master you will not be able to learn Whatever you say Baba Since your childhood you have been to so many ashrams Do you have anyone in mind that you want as your Master You are everything have Baba have no one in my mind except you You be my Master Oh So this is what you have in mind You have already decided everything on your own Baba Listen Ma Those of us who are in the Fakiri tradition and practice Dehotathya believe that God is in the body You have grown up listening to so many of our songs All this is written in those songs understand a bit Baba In our fakiri tradition it is said that at the birth of creation the subtle and formless manifest itself am the present form of that Because have evolved from there can say that was the formless too But in the course of evolution the subtle has become gross And moved very far away and forgotten its own formless subtle self Now by going reverse in the creative act can move up my gross self closer to the subtle self will be again be reunited with the formless Do you understand Ma The one who is worshipping and the one who is being worshipped are both one and the same me That entity is formless and this one has form That is why man is at the same time form and formless known and unknown On the path to the subtle self the biggest obstacle is sexual desire Worldly people fall into the trap of sexual desire and are never able to break free Baba is it sexual desire that prevents us from becoming our real selves Yes But then you cannot attain your true self by running away from sex Then how it is done Baba In our body amongst the six senses the main one is sexual desire Sexual desire is the main force for creation Because sexual desire is energy it cannot be destroyed But it can be transformed You can through spiritual practice transform your gross sexual energy into abstract love Only then will you be able to reach your real formless self The battle with lust is very difficult Ma Dont ever forget from today you have joined this battle too Ruhul baba are you home Mansoor has again brought fish Mansoor have lunch here today Ok By practicing the tradition of the four moons the

body dont fall pray to desire Sadhana Ma In our practice of the body the woman is the Master And the man is her disciple It is by holding your hand that will be able to move up If you lose patience will become directionless Do some breathing practice Take in the breath from your left nostril and breath it out from the right The most important aspect of our Dehotathya is the breathing practice Breathing techniques can help us stop our body juices from flowing out As our sexual juices come down we can control its descent with breathing techniques In the sexual act by controlling the heat to the body we can purify our juice and move it upwards This is the skill that you have to learn Ma Only then you can transform From the one who has sexual desire to the one who is in the bliss of eternal love Otherwise how will you meet the eternal lover the God inside you It is you who are the eternal lovers of the universe Will the Master allow me to be at his feet Day and night make mistakes Will the Master allow me to be at his feet through the pangs of birth came into this world through the darkness of the womb Which have now forgotten after coming into this world Will the Master allow me to be at his feet failed to recognise the worth of my Master could not understand his practice have to again repeat the cycle of rebirths Will the Master allow me to be at his feet One whose self is immersed in the image of the Master has no fear of death One whose self is immersed in the image of the Master has no fear of death Lalon says Oh my mind Lalon says Oh my mind Please help me to stay focussed Will the Master allow me to be at his feet Sadhana Ma please come here Whats happened Baba have just received news of my wife Aminas death As am a Marfati fakir so the Shariat people have given a fatwa that Amina has no place in the villages burial ground They have also said that whoever tries to bury her anywhere outside the village they too will be thrown out In this way they are threatening the villagers This is what you get if you become a fakir But Baba But you always told me Amina Mother had followed the Shariat Then whats her fault Fault Her fault is she hasnt given me Talaaq on the Moulavis orders On the contrary she said in a meeting of the Shariat people that she does not have any allegation against me Amina Ma said that in their meeting Yes Yes Ma There was no other human like Amina Then lets go there now Lets bury her somewhere else No No one will come with me am punished for my faith have to take the responsibility of my punishment alone dont give anyone permission to go there Else they will also be victims of such punishments But Baba where will you bury her took fakiri out of my own volition But why should she be punished for my faith ll bring her from the village ll bury her in front of our ashram Baba your village is five miles from here Sadhana Ma dont argue now on this now Go to the ashram and bring a shovel and spade to keep under the tree Tell everyone not be worried about this Everyone should stay inside They must not come out to help me ll enter the ashram after burying her alone Dear Noor Can you give me a cloth please One whose body has been burnt fine by the Gurus touch This body cannot be destroyed by the soil the earth does not have that power The body has already been burnt and turned fine Allah made man from the earth The Master made the man finer more true Now the energy flows only upwards and never comes down The Koran says there is no death now The body has already been burnt and turned fine One whose body has been burnt fine by the Gurus touch All beings other than mankind their nature remains the same as the Creator made them But man is different such a creation cant be seen anywhere in this world The body has already been burnt and turned fine One whose body has been burnt fine by the Masters touch By only doing good deeds will one find God dont think so Hassan has not yet been able to fulfill his master Israel Shahs expectations The body has already been burnt and turned fine One whose body has been burnt fine by the Masters touch Mansoor Ruhul Babas last wish was that his face be turned towards Ma Amina What are you saying Sadhana Ma He was a Muslim Many renowned Fakirs have been buried with their heads turned towards the Kaba in the west Its impossible We cant go against traditional rules Mansoor You tell them what our Masters last wish was But Sadhana Ma Was our ailing Master in his full senses when he said so think we should follow the time honoured tradition Mansoor and all who are here listen to me My Master was only a human being for you but to me he was God He had taught me that human beings are actually none other than God The poor and low caste people like us have always been kicked around and beaten in the name of religion And insulted by people My Masters last wish was his burial should be a symbolic protest against this religious torture If anyone of you wish to bury my Master as per his wishes please help me or else go away Sadhana Ma forgive me Let us place his head as he himself wanted in mother Aminas direction Kripa Shankar Roy age fathers name Dr Sudhangshu Sekhar Roy fair complexioned height ft inches This person is missing from last night If anyone has information regarding the missing person please contact us at You were

worry eat now After you finish eating wash the dishes and come to my room Why are you running away Why are you so silent Say something No mean Let me go to the other room Look at me Come and sit beside me Do you feel sexual desire know you feel desire Isnt that so Then why are you so far away Come close fulfill your desire and be happy You are keeping your desire suppressed Inside you feel desire On the outside you show that you are cool whats the use What are you saying Ma This sexual desire which is rising in you can you tell what is the source Source First you feel it in the mind then the body Your mind is your main faculty without addressing the problem in your mind If on the outside you pretend all is well what is the use If had been wearing clothes the feeling of sexual desire could still have come Dont you masturbate Dont you have wet dreams Yes It does happen Ma Thats why Baba you are wasting away destroying yourself with clothes on and also without them How are you free Yes Baba you are a slave to your desires And in the race to fulfill these desires there is so much hatred and bloodshed amongst humans Where will you run away from here Ma Please save me am tired of running away If you wish to save yourself you will have to know Dehotathyo What is that It is to engage in the sexual act direct the sexual fluids in to the body rather than outside this game This is what we call Brahmacharya You are talking like Mahatma Gandhi He used to say that to understand non violence One should practice Bhahmacharya What is that Brahmacharya Gandhiji used to sleep naked with women Because he wanted to raise himself up beyond sexual desire What was he doing sleeping naked with women He had so much self control that he never got excited You have to give up sex to became a Brahmachari Is that possible Baba There is a certain kind of Brahmacharya which is recognized by society By giving up women and wealth and by wearing a loin cloth that Brahmacharya has to be protected But the practice of Brahmacharya along with women is disliked by them That is why they hate us You are talking of Mahatma Gandhi Ok Did he learn from a Master And then practice Brahmacharya with a woman in the sexual act How did he see woman That is the real essence You cannot be in Brahmacharya by giving up woman We say that the Womens energy flows inwards and the males energy outwards In the sexual act by acquiring the ability from the female energy to direct energy inwards Brahmacharya can be learnt Kripa If you waste a drop of your sexual juice then know that death has occurred to you You killed your own self That is the beginning of your violence will sleep now have to rise at dawn Sadhana Ma am sleepy Are you feeling alright have never felt better Can go upstairs How many times should tell you not to fall in the trap of desire Dont forget am your Master Your Mother Imagine your body as a cooking vessel In which sugarcane juice is being heated With the heat the sugarcane juice swells up It begins to overflow and thats when the fire is reduced In this way by repeated heating and lowering of temperature the sugarcane juice is condensed After this stage even with heating the juice does not overflow anymore This is how am heating the juice in your body Now it is coming down Kripa keep looking into my eyes or you will drown in desire your semen will drop out Oh Ma This is how stop heating your body and the flow of the juice recedes If you worship the Mother you will know about your Father You asked me to meet you if loved you and did so this is the hidden truth we learn If you worship the Mother you will know about your Father If we do not learn this secret truth we cannot know the mother either The one upon whom Allah has put the responsibility of the world If you worship the Mother you will know about your Father If you worship the Mother you will know about your Father It is said that the woman was made from the mans body The female is the real nature of the world from whom we learn about Creation have learnt from my Master there are three channels in the body On the left is Ira On the right side is Pingala and at the centre is Sushumna All these three channels converge at a point in the human body at the door from where life emerges the Vagina This is what we call in our songs the confluence of the three rivers This Ira Pingala Sushumna are the three holy rivers Ganga Jamunaand Saraswati And this is where there is high tide Ira is the path of high tide to move up Pingala is the way of low tide to come down During the sexual practice the man has to bring down his juices through the Pingala channel and then take the juices up through the Ira channel with regular practice at one time it is possible to discard both these channels and through the Susunmna channel at the centre take the body juice upwards One who can do this he is the Ascetic During our menstruation after three days when the blood flow begins to reduce due to the pull of the low tide the creator descends down to the confluence of the three rivers After long years of practice the Ascetic is able to see the Creator whom we in our songs call the formless one the one who is in our heart the simple one the one who steals our heart so many names we have for him The first three days of our menstrual cycle is the dark phase or no moon and the creator descending down is the appearance of the moon Kripa Please come back home Dont misunderstand me Wherever you are come back home Look am ok Kripa haven t forgotten you for a moment That night
